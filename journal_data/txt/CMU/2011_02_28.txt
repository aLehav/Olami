This past Saturday, the Carnegie Mellon women’s tennis team took on the Kenyon Lords at Kenyon College in Gambier, Ohio. The Tartans, ranked No. 8 in the nation, started off quickly as they caught the Lords off guard with their intensity. At the end of the day, none of the Carnegie Mellon women lost a match, and the team members went home feeling good about themselves after their last match before the all-important Indoor Nationals, which starts next weekend.
In the indoor athletic sports complex at Kenyon, the first doubles team of juniors Laura Chen and Courtney Chin got Carnegie Mellon on the scoreboard, handling their opponents easily with a score of 8–1. The reunited team of senior Jennifer Chui and sophomore Alex Tapak put the Tartans up 2–0 with another routine win, until Carnegie Mellon completed the sweep as the third doubles team of junior Cze-Ja Tam and senior Ashley Herrick posted a methodical 8–5 victory.
With the 3–0 lead going into singles, the Tartans were able to relax and play their best tennis. After fighting through a tough first set, Chen was able to pull out the first singles win for the Tartans by the score of 7–5, 6–1. With all the momentum in their favor, the women won every match, with singles wins captured by Chin, Tapak, Chui, and Tam. Also winning at the sixth singles spot was first-year Madison Rabson, who fought in the closest singles match, winning the ninth victory in a match tiebreaker.
From here, the Tartans will travel to Gustavus Adolphus College next weekend, March 4–6, for the annual ITA Indoor Championships. Just two years ago, this team took home a surprising first place, which got the team to as high as No. 2 in the nation. With a convincing win under their belts, the Tartans are looking to make some noise in the tournament with their deep lineup and great team chemistry.

What will the late months of 2011 and early months of 2012 be like if there is no football to be watched? 
Unfortunately, if NFL owners and players do not figure out a collective-bargaining agreement (CBA) before March 3, NFL fans across the country could witness the NFL’s first play stoppage since 1987. With limited progress in talks between the NFL Players Association (NFLPA) and the league owners, it seems almost inevitable that we could be on the edge of our seats this whole summer, wondering whether or not our team will be on the field starting in September.
The most baffling disagreement between the NFLPA and the league owners is the argument over whether or not there should be 18 regular-season games instead of the normal 16 games that are currently scheduled.
The owners and Commissioner Roger Goodell seem convinced that the NFL will greatly benefit if the season is prolonged to 18 games, giving fans more of what they want and, of course, creating more revenue. 
However, Goodell has also stressed the importance of player safety this past year, which makes for a bit of a predicament. If Goodell is so much for player safety, he wouldn’t be pushing for an extra two games that the players have to go all out for. Just this past season, the New Orleans Saints were down to their fifth-string running back in the playoffs, putting them at a severe disadvantage. In such a high-contact sport, adding more games is anything but caring for “player safety.” It doesn’t take a rocket scientist to know that.
Although the push for 18 games may be the most baffling of the arguments, the whole collective-bargaining agreement is based on both the revenues that the owners make and the salaries that the players make. The NFL estimated $9 billion in revenues last year, and the split of the revenues seems to be the main disagreement between the two sides. It seems as if the owners are asking for a much greater proportion of the revenues than the last CBA detailed, which is obviously meeting heavy resistance from the NFLPA.
Since the sides have such distinguishable differences, the NFLPA and owners have agreed to have a U.S. Congress mediator become the “messenger” for the two sides. Just yesterday, the mediator came out and was fairly pessimistic about the talks, saying that there was some progress, but not enough to get a deal done by the end of the week — which is when the owners will either lock out the players or the player union will decertify. That would prevent the owners from locking the players out and essentially continue on with the season.
Other than the grave statement from the mediator, we have not heard much from either side of the negotiations, most likely because of all the media hype it has already garnered. People are tired of hearing that negotiations were contentious, or that the two sides are no closer than they were the week before.
So, what will those football months be filled with if football is locked out? Major League Baseball would definitely be “happy,” considering that the MLB playoffs happen during the NFL mid-season point, which definitely increases the number of viewers. For the fan who likes contact, you may have to settle for some Arena Football League, or you may even have to watch a different sport, like hockey. 
Not only does a lockout provide a huge problem to the fans, but it obviously has a greater effect on players. Coaches will not be allowed to be in contact with anyone on their teams during a lockout, hence leaving the responsibility of “offseason practices” to the captains of their respective teams.
Just last year, New York Jets quarterback Mark Sanchez organized a “Jets West” camp in California, which allowed him to get to know his wide receivers better in an effort to continue his growth in the passing game. 
However, a potential lockout will not only affect training camps during the summer, but also players who are being drafted in 2011 along with the 2011 “free agent class.”
Depending on the length of the lockout, the rookie class will have to wait until they sign big salaries, which is always a high risk for a bust. Also, those who are free agents will almost surely be signed to one-year contracts, because there will be a shortened free agency period once an agreement is reached.
The NFL lockout could be the biggest thing to happen in sports since Lebron James decided to take his talents to South Beach. Not only this, but the NBA and MLB also seem to be working on new CBAs at the moment, and it does not seem too optimistic that the NBA will be able to agree with any association on any financial prospect. 
Here’s to hoping that we don’t have to eat our chips and salsa while watching the first season of Roseanne instead of Week 1 of the NFL regular season.

Spring training games began this past weekend, giving fans a teaser of events come April.
Some games were even broadcast by teams’ local stations, making them feel even more real.
As a Mets fan, it was nice to hear Gary Cohen, Keith Hernandez, and Ron Darling — the best broadcast team in baseball (as agreed upon by ESPN.com) — getting back to narrating games again. 
As a baseball fan in general, of course, it was just nice to see nine uniformed players on a diamond and a guy in a different uniform at the plate.
Spring training games are a time for recently injured stars to prove they’ve still got it, for backups to shine, and for Oliver Perez to show he’s not a complete waste of the $12 million remaining on his contract.
Chipper Jones, who had initially planned on retiring at the end of 2010 before a season-ending injury, will use spring training as a gauge of how ready he is for one more go-round.
Carlos Beltran, Jose Reyes, and pretty much the rest of the Mets’ roster will use spring training to prove that they are healthy and rid of their many ailments.
Justin Morneau, who missed most of the Twins’ surge to the playoffs at the end of last season with a concussion, is no doubt eager to show that he’s finally fully recovered and free of any post-concussion symptoms. 
Unfortunately, though, proving that you are healthy during the spring doesn’t do anything to prove that you can stay healthy throughout the regular season.
Spring training games are also a time for teams to showcase their rising stars.
For a top prospect like the Braves’ Freddie Freeman, it’s a chance to reward his team’s faith and give them confidence in their decision to make him an everyday Major Leaguer. 
For other top prospects, like the Nationals’ Bryce Harper, it’s a chance to beat their teams’ expectations and force their way onto the Opening Day roster.
For the fans, it’s a chance to see all that develop right before their eyes.
That said, much of the excitement of spring training games stems solely from the fact that they are indeed baseball games — Major League games being played between Major League teams by Major League (and Minor League) players.
For the true baseball fans, spring training games are like the Star Wars prequels.
They are, for the most part, entertaining, they showcase what happens before the things we really care about happen, and they are hyped up to be far more awesome and important than they end up being.
Sorry, journalists, no spring training game will ever have a playoff atmosphere, even if it’s Red Sox-Yankees after the 2004 playoffs. 
Unfortunately, though, reports indicate that upon finding out that he’d lost Adam Wainwright to surgery, Tony La Russa did not continue the prequel analogy by screaming, “Noooo!”
As a Mets fan, I’ll be watching these spring spectacles, scouring for positives and excitement and eagerly awaiting Opening Day.
When I can begin watching A New Hope, The Mets Strike Back, and Return of the Collapse. Oops, I mean, Playoffs.

The No. 8 Carnegie Mellon men’s tennis team traveled to Gambier, Ohio to take on the No. 12 Lords of Kenyon College last Saturday, but fell 6–3 after missing the opportunity to clinch a few vital matches. The Lords also had home court advantage, with dozens of fans yelling and rattling the stadium after each point the Lords won. This match puts the Tartans at 7–5 for the season.
The first point the Tartans won was from the No. 3 doubles team of sophomore Harsha Rao and sophomore Jooho Yu, who topped Kenyon’s Kevin Ye and Jake Matthews 8–6. At No. 1 singles, senior Alex Nemerov rebounded after losing the first set 6–2 to win the next two 6–3, 6–2. 
Both junior Jeremy King and Yu put up fights during their respective matches, but lost in three sets. The final point came from Rao, who handily beat his opponent 6–4, 6–2.
Another honorable mention goes to Yu, who came within two points of taking down the Lords’ Austin Griffin, losing 6–4, 3–6, 10–8.
“We beat them last year, but then again both our teams lost two vital people from our lineups,” Nemerov commented. “If we had been playing a bit sharper then we could have won, but that’s just something we need to work on during practice. We have the rest of the season to redeem ourselves.”
The Tartans will play their next dual match at home against Walsh University on March 19 at 10 a.m.

First-year Soleil Phan has certainly made quite a splash this season on the varsity swimming and diving team. Phan hails from Irvine, Calif., and chose Carnegie Mellon because it was the best of both worlds. “I loved the academic rigor it offered and, at the same time, I really wanted to swim at a competitive [Division III] school,” she said.
She has yet to decide her major but is looking to pursue something in the realm of public relations.
Phan’s season highlights came from the annual training trip to Miami and the 200-yard individual medley swim-off at the University Athletic Association (UAA) Championships. It was a swim-off for the eighth-place spot at finals later that afternoon, about 40 minutes after her first swim. “I honestly didn’t know if I was going to do well and beat my opponent,” Phan remarked. When describing the event, Phan said, “During the swim, I thought she had me because she pulled ahead on the backstroke and the breaststroke leg, but on the last freestyle turn going home I felt like I could catch her, and I did. The time I swam [2:06.24] would’ve landed me first place going into finals and qualify me for NCAAs. Hopefully at NCAAs I can have the same type of performances!”
Phan enjoys being part of the swimming and diving team because she likes the mental and physical test of the sport and the unconditional support of her teammates. 
In future seasons, Phan would like to make the finals at NCAAs with a time under 52 seconds in the 100-yard freestyle, a time under 1:52 in the 200-yard freestyle, and a time under 55 seconds in the 100-yard butterfly. 
Lastly, she would like to have one relay team beat Emory.
Phan will compete in NCAAs March 23–26 in Knoxville, Tennessee.

The Carnegie Mellon University women’s basketball team lost its final game of the season on Saturday, 65–40, to the Spartans of Case Western Reserve University. The game was close early on, as juniors Nicole Vaccarella and Jen Larsen both knocked down three-pointers within the first ten minutes of the game.
Unfortunately, Case began to pull away as the first half came to a close, with the halftime score favoring the Spartans, 30–17. Junior Jacki Cortese said of the first half, “We had a good defensive first half, but we couldn’t put the ball in the basket.” This early lead by Case proved to be insurmountable as the Tartans failed to come back in the second half. The women end the season 2–23 overall and 0–14 in University Athletic Association (UAA) play.
Even in the loss, the Tartans got strong performances from sophomore Emily Peel and juniors Jacki Cortese and Jen Larsen. Peel had eight points, four rebounds, and two steals. Cortese recorded eight points, while Larsen also had eight points, including two three-pointers. All three of these women have had solid seasons for Carnegie Mellon; Jacki Cortese led the team in points (11.7 per game) and was second in rebounds (5.8 per game), Emily Peel led the team in rebounding (6.3 per game) and was second in scoring (11.2 per game), while Jen Larsen was second on the team in making three-pointers with 16 on the season. 
The Tartans also saw strong play all season from first-years Gina Tudi and Jacquie Shaw, giving the women’s basketball program something to look forward to in the future.
The Tartans didn’t meet their expectations this season, but fortunately there is much promise for next year, as the team didn’t have any seniors and can build on a strong core of younger players.
Cortese summed up the season in this way: “We were a bit of a young team this year, so now everyone has some experience under their belts, which is good.” This experience will make the 2011–12 season more successful for the Tartans, as they will turn this year’s lessons into wins.

The controversy over the new Transportation Security Administration (TSA) scanners has recently been a popular topic of conversation on many news networks and in newspapers, and opponents claim that the new scanners are too intrusive, even for airport security. However, many of these discourses fail to address how exactly this technology works. Social ramifications aside, the new scanners are the result of the $42 billion the TSA has spent on upgrading security over the past 10 years.
The new scanners, officially called the Advanced Imaging Technology (AIT), purport to make the jobs of the TSA employees easier by revealing if the person being scanned has any potentially dangerous objects concealed on their person. This is useful to the people doing the scanning, as they have to spend less time individually checking each person, and the computer is more accurate than humans. The main point that critics of this technology like to raise is that such a device is an invasion of people’s privacy; the scanners can show people without their clothes, information some people feel uncomfortable sharing. The scanners accomplish these objectives using two main types of machines: the millimeter wave unit and the backscatter unit.
The millimeter wave unit, which resembles a gray cage, uses high-frequency radio waves to accomplish its task. These waves are bounced off the body of the person being scanned to create a three-dimensional image on the computer. 
The backscatter units instead bounce low-level electromagnetic X-rays off the body to create an image on the computer. The milllimeter wave unit creates pictures that look like fuzzy photo negatives, with ghostly gray pictures visible on a black background. The backscatter units produce white drawings with faint etchings to show features on a gray background. Both these pictures can help TSA employees identify if the person in question is attempting to carry potentially dangerous items on to the plane.
The TSA has not been deaf to the complaints people have raised over these technologies, which is why it has been trying to calm the public by establishing measures to make sure people’s privacy is not invaded. 
First, it assures passengers that the pictures are not saved after the person has been scanned. Second, it has begun testing new technology that eliminates the need for TSA employees to have to look at the images individually. Instead, this technology uses a generic human silhouette to pinpoint where a person might have harmful objects stored or hidden. The computer is given the ability to look for the harmful objects instead of the human employees having to look at each picture. If the technology using generic silhouettes reaches widespread popularity, it might ease some of the controversy that has been raised.

It’s midterm season again, and with these special two weeks come countless hours spent in the library trying to memorize facts, such as which Chinese dynasty most exalted Daoism or which conformation results in the least ring strain for cyclohexane. To partake in such fun studying activities, one may also need an intake of caffeinated beverages. Modern technology and lax FDA regulations have allowed a flood of new energy drinks to enter the market, so instead of simply drinking coffee, one can also drink energizers that promise insomnia for a full two days. However, one must proceed with caution to avoid becoming reliant on the core ingredient of these beverages: caffeine. 
Caffeine addiction is a serious and often-ignored problem of many students who have rigorous work schedules or just like staying up playing video games. The withdrawal symptoms alone are cause for concern and can negatively alter one’s behavior, and according to www.medicinenet.com, substance dependence involves a build-up of the body’s tolerance, withdrawal symptoms, excess consumption, and failed efforts to cut down usage, among other factors.
Caffeine consumption has been around for thousands of years, although not in the forms we are used to today. Caffeine is a chemical found naturally in cocoa (between 30–50 milligrams (mg) per serving) and coffee beans and tea leaves (anywhere from 80–120 mg, depending on the type and brew intensity). In contrast, most sodas have the same amount of caffeine as cocoa, while energy drinks such as Red Bull and Monster contain 160 mg for 16 ounces. In its purest form, caffeine is a white powder with a unique taste, and is often found in sodas such as Coke or root beer. The health website www.livestrong.com suggests that caffeine has been around since 3000 B.C., when the Chinese emperor Shen Nong discovered the art of brewing tea, and Aztecs drank coffee during the 1500s. Coffee became the drink of choice for British colonists in America when they refused to drink tea after the British passed the Tea Act in 1773.
According to www.medicinenet.com, the caffeine in these drinks is absorbed into the body’s nervous system after 30–45 minutes and is good for a three-hour spike in energy and mental alertness. There are receptors in the brain which bind with a chemical called adenosine, which causes drowsiness and induces sleep when active. The chemical makeup of caffeine is similar to that of adenosine, so when caffeine is absorbed into the body, it binds with the adenosine receptors to block this process from occurring. As a result, one’s brain operates more quickly and induces the pituitary gland to release epinephrine — more commonly known as adrenaline — which is a hormone and neurotransmitter known for the “fight-or-flight” effect on one’s body: increased heart rate and blood pressure, dilated pupils, and tightened muscles according to www.howstuffworks.com. There is also an increase in dopamine, a hormone known for stimulating the pleasure centers of the brain. These effects explain why one often feels awake but also nervous or anxious after consuming caffeine. After repeated consumption of caffeine, one’s body begins to add more adenosine receptors to  compensate; one will require more and more caffeine intake to achieve the same alertness and concentration. This is the body’s way of building a tolerance, and the first step to becoming a caffeine addict.
After the body has processed the caffeine and the effects wear off, usually after six hours, one may begin to experience withdrawal symptoms, which include fatigue, dizziness, headaches and a sour mood. Caffeine is also a diuretic, meaning one will need to urinate more frequently, which results in dehydration. 
Many experts have compared caffeine addiction to substance abuse. After all, caffeine binds to receptors in the brain to create an artificial reaction and engineer various chemical releases; drugs such as heroin or cocaine follow the same process. However, to overdose on caffeine, one will need to consume around 100 cups of coffee in a single day, a feat which seems humanly impossible. Although an article from howstuffworks.com suggests that around 90 percent of adults consume a caffeinated beverage every day, one must also consider the health ramifications in the short run.
Although coffee can have negative short-term side effects, an 18-year study done by Harvard University in 2001 suggests that daily coffee consumption (generally black, with little to no cream or sugar) decreases one’s risk of diabetes by approximately 9 percent. After compiling results from over 130,000 volunteers, Harvard researchers have concluded that there are no serious health effects in the long run. Harvard’s website suggests, however, to not disregard all caution for caffeine intake: “Often people think of coffee just as a vehicle for caffeine. But it’s actually a very complex beverage with hundreds and hundreds of different compounds in it. Since coffee contains so many different compounds, drinking coffee can lead to very diverse health outcomes.”
Although caffeine can be alluring to the struggling college student by offering powers of beating drowsiness and increasing mental acuity, one should not become dependent on such a drug. For those who wish to cut down their consumption, the best way is to slowly decrease usage and have the willpower to use alternative methods of finishing work.

Facebook quickly disables ‘Breakup Notifier’ app
An application released on Feb. 20 which informed Facebook users when a chosen friend changed their relationship status was shut down by Facebook just three days later. The social network contacted the application’s creator, Dan Loewenherz, 24, and informed him that although the application was not breaking any Facebook policies, it received very strong negative feedback from users. While Facebook continues to look into the situation, Loewenherz is confident the social network will lift the ban on his app.

Cell phone usage affects brain activity
The National Institutes of Health recently published results showing that a 50-minute cell phone call alters brain activity. The study involved 47 volunteers who received two brain scans: one in which a cell phone was attached to the participant’s right ear, and one that was phone-free. The scans involving the phone showed an average increase in the rate of glucose metabolism — a proxy for brain activity — of 7 percent. These findings show that the brain is sensitive to cell phone use, but do not determine if the effects are harmful.

Moderate drinking associated with healthiness
A study from researchers at the University of Calgary shows that having an alcoholic drink every day may contribute to cardiac health, though excessive drinking will still lead to harmful consequences. The findings show that moderate drinkers are 14 to 25 percent less likely to develop cardiovascular disease than those who abstain from drinking. Moderate drinkers also had more heightened levels of high-density lipoprotein, or “good” cholesterol, than non-drinkers. These findings indicate that drinking in moderation may have health benefits.

New drug attacks main cause of cystic fibrosis
There is now a new drug on the market to combat cystic fibrosis, the disease associated with a buildup of thick mucus in the human digestive tract and lungs. Vertex Pharmaceuticals of Cambridge, Mass. performed a study in which 161 people with cystic fibrosis showed that when combined with one other medicine, VX-770 helped improve lung functioning by about 20 percent. Rather than attacking the symptoms of the disease like drugs in the past, VX-770 attacks the defective protein called the cystic fibrosis transmembrane regulator, the main cause of cystic fibrosis.

Space shuttle Discovery makes final launch
The space shuttle Discovery successfully launched its 39th and final flight on Thursday. Within one hour before takeoff, problems arose with an Air Force tracking system computer that caused many to doubt the launch. With about five minutes left before launch, the problem was successfully repaired, and the shuttle launched with only three seconds left in the day’s launching window. The space shuttle delivered supplies and equipment to the International Space Station three days later.

Researchers create the world’s smallest computer
Researchers at the University of Michigan have created the “first true millimeter-scale complete computing system,” according to a professor at the university. The computer covers just the “N” letter on a penny. With a solar cell, it can reach full power in just 1.5 hours of sunlight or in 10 hours of indoor light. The computer was built to monitor eye pressure for glaucoma patients, but the technology has other applications like monitoring pollution, performing surveillance, and tracking structural integrity.

The 2011 Carnegie Mellon International Film Festival: Faces of Migration celebrates the art of filmmaking and will run March 17–April 10 with a special screening on Wednesday, March 2. The Carnegie Mellon International Film Festival brings independent and foreign films spanning multiple genres, from documentaries to short fictional films. The theme of this year's festival is Faces of Migration. The collection explores migration as an individual issue as well as a socio-political issue with humor and intensity through the eyes of international filmmakers.
The Carnegie Mellon International Film Festival has been organized by a body of students led by Jolanta Lion, the assistant director of the Humanities Center, and David Shumway, the director of the Humanities Center. This year’s theme was chosen to align with the Humanities Center’s lecture series, Identities in Conflict: The Recognition of Migrants, and to get viewers to think about how migration relates to them. Caitlin Cowley, a graduate English student who has been working on the festival, explained, “Migration is becoming a bigger issue. In the United States, we’re bombarded with these images of Mexico and [the] United States’ relationship. So the goal of this festival is to get people think[ing] about migration and what it means in the contemporary world, to us as individuals. People, I don’t think, have asked themselves enough about how important this issue is to the global community.”
Putting together the festival has been a highly involved process. Once they chose the theme of “migration”, the festival’s organizational team researched new movies, looking only at films released within the past year or two. They contacted directors, researched other film festivals, and looked at award-winning films from around the world, trying to find films that would best fit the theme of Carnegie Mellon’s festival. Cowley explained that the festival’s team was looking for innovative films with “poignant, controversial, [or] rousing depictions of migration.”
One of the team’s challenges was to find films that represented all parts of the world. Cowley said, “One of our biggest struggles was trying to find an African film about migration from an African director.... You’d think, oh my God, with all these conflicts that [have] been going on in Africa, [it would be easy].... [But] we literally could not find a good, decent film about migration in Africa.” In the end, though, the festival managed to represent most regions fairly well, other than Africa and Australia. The team watched over 50 movies, eventually narrowing its list down to 14 films to show in five theaters throughout Pittsburgh.
Picking the films was only part of the process — the film festival organizers then had to secure the rights to show every one of the films. Furthermore, a major cost in running a film festival is transporting the actual physical film from international locations to Pittsburgh for screening. Transportation costs can go upward of $600 and screening fees can be as high as $1,000.
There will be a special screening of Separations this Wednesday at 8 p.m. in McConomy Auditorium as a sneak preview to the festival. The film’s director, Mieke Bal, will be attending the screening to host a panel discussion about the identity of Jewish migrants. Sababa, a Middle Eastern grill in Squirrel Hill, will be providing authentic Middle Eastern food prior to the screening, and there will be a raffle during the event for a dining gift certificate.
The food, panel discussion, and raffle will not be specific just to the Separations screening. Rather, the Carnegie Mellon International Film Festival will incorporate these different elements into many of its screenings. As Cowley explained, “They are not just about these films; they are event screenings. We’ll have hip-hop dancers, panel discussions with professors from Carnegie Mellon University and University of Pittsburgh, and local leaders.” When attending the festival, one will not just be going to see a movie, but will also be taking a journey to see different cultures and points of view.
Genre-wise, the festival should have something for everyone. Norteado (Northless) is an “artistic meditation on ... migration; [it’s a] visual story,” Cowley said. “In Norteado, there is a story there but just as much as the actual content or plot, part of the aesthetic is the visual of the deserts of Tehuana.” Norteado will be screened on March 19 at the Melwood Screening Room.
Les Arrivants (The Arrivals), showing March 16 at the Melwood Screening Room, is a French comedy that focuses on two very different women who are both social workers that manage immigrants coming into France. At the screening, there will also be a Skype session with the directors of the movie, Claudine Bories and Patrice Chagnard, as well as French pastries from Paris 66.
The Carnegie Mellon International Film Festival will also celebrate the art of filmmaking by showing short films that have been made locally in Pittsburgh. The entries represent a wide range of views and experience in film making.
The Carnegie Mellon International Film Festival: Faces of Migration will show a wide range of films that cannot be seen elsewhere in the area. The selections to be presented include award-winning films from film festivals around the world. These unique experiences come at a bargain for Carnegie Mellon students — for only $20 for the Full Access Festival Pass, this festival will transport you around the world and back.

There are just a couple of days left until spring break, and excitement about going home is building up. In dorm rooms around campus, students have their travel bags out again, while back at home parents are eagerly anticipating the arrival of their college-aged children and figuring out how to spend as much time with them as possible during the ten days of break. However, for many people, spring break doesn’t entail being able to go home. Whether you have some obligation keeping you on campus, you’re an international student, or you just didn’t get a flight back — the point is, you don’t have any spring break plans. There’s no need to mope around or be down in the dumps and glare at anyone who mentions the word “break” — here is a list of options to choose from if you aren’t returning home.
Make travel plans with your buddies
If you know a couple of people who are in the same boat as you are, then get together and plan a week-long holiday to a warm, sunny place. Go hip and chic while shopping in Los Angeles, take a cruise to the Bahamas, or just party it up in Mexico — the possibilities are unlimited. Adhip Sacheti, a sophomore majoring in economics, plans to go to Cancun with a few of his friends. He insisted, “Cancun is the place to be simply because it has all you can ask for from spring break: beaches and good weather, plus we’re legal there.” Eshan Chordia, a sophomore electrical and computer engineering major, added, “A vacation is a great way to bond with friends. The fun factor is enormous too.”
Visit a friend
Always wanted to catch up with your old friend from high school   but never had the time? Maybe you both could meet up and talk about each other’s lives. Make a few calls and decide on a place to meet, or visit your friend’s campus instead.
Ride solo
Just want to get away and be by yourself? Maybe this is the perfect time. Get into Orlando Bloom’s shoes and roar off toward your Elizabethtown. Rent a car or a bike (for those who are extra adventurous), make a personalized CD for the stereo, draw out a map, and go on a road trip. If driving isn’t an option, then utilize the public transport system (check out Megabus for great deals) and head out on your own adventure. Keep an account of your journey by carrying a journal with you, and update it every night before sleeping. It’s an amazing way to do some soul searching or to just meet a bunch of new people.
Community service in Pittsburgh
Working on a community service project is a great way to learn more about the community of Pittsburgh. Projects typically include a variety of service opportunities during the day as well as communal dinners, discussions with a range of topics, and activities all focused toward building a better community. This will also be a great way to visit many different locations in Pittsburgh, get to know people in and about Pittsburgh, and become familiar with local service projects that one can continue working on throughout the semester.
Explore vibrant Pittsburgh
Spring break is a wonderful time to truly experience what Pittsburgh has to offer. Here are a couple of things that top Pittsburgh’s to-do list:
Go try out Pittsburgh’s local restaurants which have been around for ages. Some top choices would be breakfast at Pamela’s and some Pittsburgh-style lunch at Primanti’s.
So what if Pittsburgh doesn’t have a Six Flags? It has a Kennywood! As a National Historic Landmark, this amusement park gives its rides an old-world charm and leaves its visitors screaming for more.
If you’re the artsy type, then go to one of Pittsburgh’s many museums, most of which are free for students. Don’t forget to visit the Cathedral of Learning for its great architecture and view!
View the marvelous Pittsburgh skyline while traveling in a wooden cable car on the Duquesne and Monongahela inclines.
Spend an evening at Southside — go shopping, take pictures of the trendy bars, eat food at the Cheesecake Factory, and watch a local band perform to top it all.
If none of the above are appealing to you and you had hoped for something more exciting, then you can still plan ahead for next year. Anisha Vyas, a sophomore mechanical and biomedical engineering major, is extremely excited to spend her spring break working with Carnegie Mellon Panama Business Brigades, which helps underdeveloped communities achieve their economic goals. Vyas said, “It’s a great way to apply all the skills one has learned at CMU to help other people in the world.” And for all those who just wanted to go home, she adds, “I went home my freshman year, but it can get boring too, which is why this time I chose to utilize my time in a more efficient way.” Regardless of what your plans are this year for spring break, the key to having a great break is to just put down the study books, relax for a while, and enjoy these ten stress-free days.

Many people were very surprised by this year’s winner of the Best New Artist award at the 53rd Grammy Awards. Jazz vocalist, bassist, and composer Esperanza Spalding not only astonished many with her extraordinary talent, but also made history as the first jazz artist to win the award. Another shocking element of her success is that Spalding was not as widely known as some of the other nominees for the award, especially popular artists Justin Bieber and Drake. Spalding only recently made her debut in 2008 with her self-titled album Esperanza. Although there were a number of disappointed Bieber and Drake fans, it is hard to ignore Spalding’s talent and say that she did not deserve the victory. Her most recently released album, Chamber Music Society, is a strong verification of her musical skills.
Chamber Music Society was No. 1 on the Heatseekers Albums Chart of Billboard as well as No. 3 on Billboard’s Top Contemporary Jazz Albums Chart. The album features many classical-style jazz songs while producing a world fusion theme in some of the pieces. Many of the songs are wordless, giving the music an abstract quality and leaving the meaning open for interpretation. Spalding utilizes many different aspects of traditional jazz music, while creating her pieces in a way that is still fresh and contemporary. She uses rhythm sections and improvisation, scatting, and piano and violin solo sections in which the leading instrument seems to be improvising over the other instruments. She also uses vocal techniques influenced by folk and world music.
“Chacarera,” the fourth track on the album, is quite an interesting composition. It incorporates elements from 20th century music, especially during the song’s periodic sections of dissonant tones. Then it flows into an upbeat rhythm with a haunting melody as Spalding’s smooth voice is accompanied by the piano, percussion, and strings. It embodies one of Spalding’s qualities as a musician — the ability to bring new and different aspects to jazz music to develop a contemporary and eclectic style.
The song “What a Friend” seems like a story painted through music. As the beautiful melody and harmony line weave together, they create a feeling of happiness and companionship. The song begins at a rather slow pace, but builds to a faster pace with cheery scatting as the accompanying instruments follow in upbeat stride. The song then alternates between the two tempos as it continues.
The album includes many more songs that display the innovation that Esperanza Spalding possesses and that Billboard magazine recognized. Spalding’s third album, called Radio Music Society, is due to be released in the spring of 2011, and it is very likely that she has many more innovations to bestow upon the world of music.

Proving that winning isn’t everything and that losing is not the same as ‘bee’-ing a loser, Carnegie Mellon’s School of Drama presented The 25th Annual Putnam County Spelling Bee Feb. 17–26 at the New Hazlett Theater. The musical follows 10 spelling bee competitors, four of whom are audience members, as they battle to win the titular competition.
This light-hearted yet poignant musical centers on the pivotal moments where the contestants must stand and spell or go home. Told through the medium of flashbacks interwoven throughout the competition, the audience learns about the life and times of these eclectic participants and hosts.
The costumes and stage set the tone of the story. The cast wore patches on their jeans, sparkly barrettes, Lipsmackers chapstick necklaces, and Baby-G watches — one cast member even had a Saturn-ring retainer in her mouth. The set itself was bright and cartoon-ish, with colorful signs advertising different Putnam Valley events.
The costumes and set matched the characters’ vibrant, quirky performances. As the story began, the actors started by playing exaggerated stereotypes of their characters. Then, as the story progressed, they narrowed in on the very real insecurities, hopes, and dreams that the characters faced.
Mitch Mahoney, played by Donovan Mitchell, arrived on stage dressed in baggy jeans, a white tank top, and excessive jewelry. Mahoney was the bee’s official “Comfort Counselor.” He handed out juice boxes to the losing contestants. Audience participation was a large component of “Spelling Bee,” and Mahoney seamlessly integrated the audience into the story when he began the bee by leading everyone, including the audience, in reciting the “Pledge of Allegiance.”
Chip Tolentino, played by Pattrick Dillon Curry in Friday’s performance, was a minor-league baseball player and last year’s spelling bee champion. He wound up before spelling his words. Leaf Coneybear, played by Darren Bluestone, only took third at his regional bee, but made it to county finals because the first- and second-placed spellers had to go to a Bar Mitzvah that day.
Logainne Schartzandgrubenierre, played by Kailie Torres, wanted the voting age to be 10, was pro-choice, and was the head of her elementary school’s gay-straight alliance. Marcy Park, played by Gabriel McClinton, claimed to speak six languages. Olive, played by Mimi Gianopulos, read the dictionary in her house on the toilet. Finally William Barfee, played by Kyle Rotter, whose last name is pronounced “Bar-fay,” not “Barf-y,” has a rare mucous-membrane disease and a talent for spelling with his foot.
Spelling Bee is a commentary on life. No one knows the luck of the draw: While one contestant could be given a hard word to spell, another contestant could randomly be assigned an easy word. The spellers complain that the element of luck makes the bee unfair. They erupt in the song “Pandemonium,” singing: “Life is random and unfair/Life is pandemonium/It is such a calamity/Where should we begin?/The best spellers don’t necessarily win.”
When one of the characters misspells a word, she must cope with societal pressures and more directly parental pressures of losing. She sings, “America you hate losers/So do I. I’m a loser, so goodbye.” One realizes that there is more to the musical then spelling. It is about knowing that there are six contestants and only one can win. What about the other five?
Win or lose, the characters must come to terms with their inadequacies and unique quirks and embrace themselves in order to find self-actualization.
Mimi Gianopulos, who played Olive, explained that the process of making Spelling Bee was “really fun, but challenging because [the cast] had to be children with authentic hopes and dreams, not just actors playing children. That was the biggest challenge,” Gianopulos said, “Remembering what it was like to be a child.”
Gianopulos thinks that the charm in Spelling Bee lies in “embracing its simplicity. It is not Shakespeare and that’s okay. The beauty of the production is the children’s wants and needs. It’s beautiful in that simplicity.”

An eccentric con man commits the largest art fraud of the 20th century, fooling the biggest players in the art world as he sells over 200 counterfeit works. Although this is the plot of a recently published thriller, it isn’t fictitious. Provenance, a nonfiction book written by husband-and-wife journalists Aly Sujo and Laney Salisbury, tells the story of John Drewe, a British con man who eluded capture for nine years as he managed to sell counterfeit art.
The story begins in 1986 with John Myatt, an artist and single father struggling to make ends meet. After he begins to sell “genuine fakes” of famous paintings, he meets John Drewe, who claims to be a physicist and art collector. Impressed by Myatt’s abilities, Drewe begins to commission works from Myatt in the style of famous 20th-century artists and persuades Myatt to help Drewe market them as original works, promising the cash-strapped Myatt an economic opportunity he can’t refuse. Drewe begins to sell Myatt’s paintings, claiming them to be genuine works by artists like Alberto Giacometti and Ben Nicholson, and accumulating hundreds of thousands of pounds in the process.
Drewe knows, however, that art dealers will not be convinced of the paintings’ authenticity unless the paintings have provenance. Provenance is the documentation for an artwork, providing evidence of the artwork’s past ownership and authenticity. Drewe is later able to infiltrate the archives of esteemed British art institutions to create provenance for his forged artworks, forever tainting the legitimacy and accuracy of the archives.
Sujo and Salisbury’s journalistic backgrounds shine through in Provenance. They meticulously researched Drewe’s art fraud scheme, traveling around both the United States and Europe to interview nearly everyone with whom he had interacted or who had inadvertently been affected by his elaborate con.
The book, however, does not read like a news report. Rather, it reads like a crime-thriller novel, weaving together information that the authors gleaned from interviews to create a fascinating narrative. The tempo of the book increases as Drewe begins to get ensnared in his web of forgeries, while his more sinister and eccentric characteristics reveal themselves as Scotland Yard begins to close in on the con man.
The authors were able to paint vivid portraits of all the characters, from the lying Drewe to the greedy and misguided dealers who help perpetuate Drewe’s fraud, to the persistent Mary Lisa Palmer, director of the Giacometti Association, whose suspicions eventually help bring about Drewe’s downfall. Not only did they provide descriptions of the characters’ appearances and quirks, but they also speculated about the possible psychological reasons behind the motivations for the main characters, making the characters seem even more real.
In addition to the narrative surrounding Drewe’s actions, Provenance also provides the reader a fascinating glimpse into how the art world operates. It reveals the relationships between art dealers, collectors, galleries, and museums, detailing the actions of those eager to seal the deal on pieces of art worth hundreds of thousands of dollars.
Whether you’re interested in the art world or merely interested in the true story of an elaborate fraud, Provenance will have you hooked from the first page to the last.

Plain is boring. White is safe. Tees are never in vogue. But when you put those three together, you get the Plain White T’s, who are anything but boring, safe, and unfashionable. The Plain White T’s are on their “Wonders of the Younger” tour, and they performed in Pittsburgh at Mr. Small’s Theatre last Thursday.
Mr. Small’s was a perfect choice for the concert’s venue. The walls are decorated with stage curtain paintings and suspended, tilted wooden doors. This décor goes well with the adventure theme of the Plain White T’s’ latest album, Wonders of the Younger, especially since the stage boasted a big red and white façade of a circus tent. But more importantly, this cozy theatre provides an intimate setting, making the experience even more enjoyable.
The Miggs and The Parachutes have been touring with the Plain White T’s. The Miggs opened the night with a spirited performance. This almost-famous three-member band did a great job of warming the crowd up slowly but surely. The Parachutes, who seemed to have an already-established fan-base in the audience, followed. By the end of the group’s gripping performance, the shrieking fans were more than ready to welcome the Plain White T’s. Unfortunately, the transition between the bands was slow, and the audience was forced to wait for a while. In the end, though, the wait was worth it.
The Plain White T’s made a grand entrance and had already started playing “Irrational Anthem” even before the audience could spot them in the fog and bright yellow light. Much of rest of the performance, though, was focused on music rather than performance or showmanship. The Chicago-based band took advantage of the cozy setting and got to know its audience members by asking them questions, trying to figure out how many were first-timers and how many had actually heard its CDs before.
The five-member band kept the majority of the audience happy by playing hits like “1, 2, 3, 4” and “Rhythm of Love.” However, the band also performed the 10-year-old sublime track “Radios in Heaven” for the old-timers. For the much-awaited “Hey There Delilah,” the band members decided to mix things up. Tom Higgenson, the lead vocalist, explained from a small stage at the back of the room that this 2008 Grammy-nominated song was originally supposed to be a private song, hence his choice to sing it in this intimate setting. Soon after that, the group closed the night with the thought-provoking “Wonders of the Younger,” the title track of its latest album.
Since the Plain White T’s are going to be on tour for most of 2011, Higgenson said that they might be back to perform in Pittsburgh. After that concert, Pittsburgh is surely yearning to hear more of them.

If you are contemplating whether you should study abroad, then I have one line of advice for you to make your choice easier: Just go for it! Studying abroad affords you the opportunity to do something totally different and extraordinary. An international education really allows you to challenge yourself in a different educational system, immerse yourself in a new culture, learn new things, and explore opportunities you’ve never had before.
I studied abroad last semester at Oxford University in the United Kingdom, and it was one of the best experiences of my life. From the moment I hopped onto the bus from London to Oxford, I knew that I was in for a great semester. As I first set foot on the stone streets of Oxford’s City Center, the town buzzed with life as tourists, students, and scholars bustled their way through the narrow streets and alleyways to go about their busy activities. As I explored many of Oxford’s 38 different colleges, I was surrounded by the rich, scholastic tradition and history of the colleges and their respective campuses.
I studied through the program IFSA-Butler (Institute For Study Abroad). The program gave us a great sense of the culture and history of England. In the beginning, there was a four-day orientation in London, and then we went our separate ways to the various Oxford campuses. IFSA-Butler also planned excursions to Bath, Keswick, London, and Stonehenge for its students.
What differentiates Oxford from many other universities is its style of teaching, known as the tutorial system. As opposed to the traditional lecture or seminar classes, students were assigned about 20–30 books to read and were expected to compose two analytical papers every week, each 2,000 words long, arguing the critical topic assigned. Students would then have to sit down with their tutors for an hour and discuss the arguments they made in the essays. The Oxford tutorial system challenged me to take on new perspectives in my studies, and even though I only attended class two hours a week (one for each tutorial) and spent the rest of the time reading and constructing my papers, I felt intellectually challenged every minute. As a visiting student, I had access to the world-famous Bodleian Library. I never had to purchase any textbooks because the Oxford library system seems to hold just about everything that has ever been published!
At Oxford, there is a tradition of “bop parties” every term, in which students dress up according to a particular theme. This might sound like a typical school dance, but the British take their costumes seriously. For instance, during the term I was there, the theme for the bop was “Disney.” Students came in elaborate costumes ranging from Pinocchio to Buzz Lightyear to Ursula from The Little Mermaid. At Oxford, I also noticed that many students dashed off to the pubs and nightclubs to relax just as often as they went to the library — even in the middle of the week. Interestingly enough, a lot of pub conversations were more philosophical than I initially expected, and sometimes these intellectual conversations would turn into passionate debates.
From studying in the Bodleian Library to debating philosophy in pubs, Oxford continuously presented me with opportunities I never would have dreamed of. While there, I met my Bollywood idol, Preity Zinta, as she was giving a speech at the Oxford Union. I also met my social entrepreneurship idol, Roy Bunker, while I was attending the Oxford Social Entrepreneurship Conference. I also took the greatest risk of my life by being adventurous and doing via ferrata — which is like climbing a rock wall, except it’s up a mountainside — up the second-highest mountain in the United Kingdom.
After my Oxford experience, I had the opportunity to travel to Paris and Barcelona. It was definitely one of the best experiences I’ve ever had. Some general advice I would give to those who plan on studying abroad: Be safe and open to trying new things, and you’ll have the time of your life. Take advantage of the cheap airplane flights to neighboring countries within Europe. I remember my plane ticket from Barcelona to London was $20, tax and service fees included — talk about a good deal! If you study abroad, you’ll return to the States a changed person — guaranteed.

So, there’s this hip hop producer in Los Angeles that goes by Bei Ru. He’s doing some magical things.
Similar to many producers nowadays, Bei Ru mixes together chunks of music that would appear to be impossible to hear on the same album. The difference? This guy has one refined sense of taste. His forte lies in mixing contemporary hip hop sensibilities with the obscure soul and funk of the 1970s that he grew up listening to.
Try to imagine Lil Wayne laying down raps on top of laid-back psychedelic funk, and you’re halfway to understanding the splendor of what Bei Ru is doing in Los Angeles.
Last November, Bei Ru put out his album Little Armenia, aka L.A. It is an album that captures, using samples of Armenian music, the sound of a diaspora that settled in Los Angeles. To make this album, Bei Ru searched record stores in Los Angeles, Lebanon, and Armenia for gems from the late ’60s and ’70s. To Bei Ru, the album is an encapsulation of the state of mind created by growing up in L.A. among friends in his family’s own Little Armenia.
The album is the perfect cocktail for the cultural persecution that Armenians around the world have suffered. The work by Bei Ru is particularly relevant because it stands out as a cross-ethnic testament to the greatness of music and an homage to the collective past of Armenians. I’d go so far as to saying that it pulls back the heavy shroud that the Armenian genocide has laid down upon the face of Armenian American culture.
If you’re a fan of the seamless meshes that Blockhead, DJ Shadow, and the Avalanches have created in the recent past, Little Armenia is an album that you simply need to get into your brain.
To hear some of Bei Ru’s productions, visit his YouTube channel Musaler Music. You’ll be glad you did.
Hugs and kisses,
Juan

Dear Hoskins Brothers,
Wooooooooooo! Spring break! Wooooooooooooooo! Do you have any tips for getting the most out of spring break?
Sincerely,
Woooooo!
Dear Woooooo,
Sleep. Seriously, get some sleep. Sure, spring break’s a great time to go on trips, have adventures, and try to get on MTV, but, really, you’re exhausted. When was the last time you had a good night’s sleep? Spring break is your chance to get even. When you come back, you’ll look less like a Carnegie Mellon zombie, with bags under your eyes and grunting about how much work you have, and more like a fresh-faced Carnegie Mellon student who has no idea about the horrors that await him or her.
Now, just because you’re getting sleep doesn’t mean you’re not having fun. You can still go out at night — just sleep in afterward. But what’s important here is to get out of Pittsburgh. You need sun and warmth — two things Pittsburgh doesn’t have. A great spring break spot is the beach. You have the sun, the surf, the sand, and beautiful people to gawk at. You can’t do that at Carnegie Mellon. 
Only two months till summer — two long, long months,
Patrick Hoskins
Dear Hoskins Brothers,
I write a column for my school’s paper, and, frankly, I’m all out of ideas. I have no idea what to write about. Do you have any tips or ideas? How do you do it?
Sincerely,
Writer In Need
Dear WIN,
What kind of column do you write? If you’re a music writer and desperate, just write about some band selling out. They all do it, so you’re sure to have material. If you do news commentary, just look at the top headline and make up a position. The more outrageous the better. For example, “The Wisconsin protests are just a ploy to get Hitler back in power!” Watch Glenn Beck for ideas.
The real problem is if you don’t have a defined topic, and you’re stuck writing something really broad, like an advice column. An advice column may seem easy — just answer people’s e-mails. But some less popular advice-givers out there (not me) often just make up questions! No one even bothers e-mailing questions. In that case, just start making up more and more ridiculous questions, like about comic books or bears. If you still can’t come up with anything, then do something meta. People love meta.
Please send in questions,
Brian Hoskins

A man who allegedly robbed the PNC Bank in Forbes Avenue was arrested on Forbes in front of Cyert Hall earlier this afternoon. Both Carnegie Mellon and Pittsburgh police responded to the incident. According to WTAE, the suspect used a taxi to escape from the scene. He then boarded a 58 Port Authority bus at the Forbes and Morewood stop, at which point officers were able to apprehend him.

In a Carnegie Mellon tradition going back nearly 15 years, Hillel and the Department of Student Affairs are organizing a reading of the names of young Holocaust victims to be held on March 22. The reading will last 12 straight hours, from 7 a.m. to 7 p.m., and will cover the names of children who died. A Holocaust keynote speaker will follow the reading.
Holocaust names readings have been held on the Carnegie Mellon campus sporadically since 1997. Anne Witchner, the assistant dean of student affairs, was involved in the first reading and is one of the organizers of this year’s event.
“The first year I did it, I was astounded,” Witchner said. “I grew up with many friends whose parents were in the Holocaust in my hometown. So it wasn’t unfamiliar territory, but it was really moving.”
According to the original press release, the 1997 reading lasted 24 hours and was accompanied by speakers, art installations, a monologue, and a candle-lighting ceremony.
“[The student who organized the first reading] did it her senior year, and somehow, she and a bunch of her friends really got together, and it was amazing,” said Witchner. “They went to [the Undergraduate Student] Senate and got money, and got [a student undergraduate research grant]. We’re really just recreating that.”
In the past 15 years, organizations such as Alpha Epsilon Pi have run the event, but the readings have been much smaller. “We’re trying to revive it,” said Sarah Pfeffer, a senior material sciences and engineering major, who is helping to organize the reading.
Witchner had been interested in recreating the original reading for years but held off until she saw student interest. “It takes students who want to do it, and Sarah was interested,” she said.
Participants in the reading will each speak for ten minutes. A microphone will be set up on the Cut, and readers will use a set of binders containing a list of children’s names for reference. “They’re three-inch binders,” said Pfeffer, “and every page has a huge list of names on it. They’re only going to read children’s names, but I hope we can get through it; it’s so big.”
Witchner and Pfeffer are inviting prominent students and faculty to participate, hoping that they can help the event grow into a yearly occurrence. “As soon as you get the higher-up people in the university, I think they’ll come back every year,” Pfeffer said.
“I do like the idea of growing it,” said Witchner. “It’s the kind of thing where maybe eventually [the Activities Board] could get involved. I was the director of student activities, and there’s all kinds of tie-ins, things we don’t have money to bring.”
Witchner would like to get more students involved in the future of the event. “[Student Affairs and Hillel] wouldn’t want to do something unless there was student interest, because then it takes on a life of its own,” she said.
In the future, Witchner hopes that students in art and design classes could create installations for the event. If enough interest is generated, programming could be expanded to include discussions of other genocides.
“One year they did the reading, and then a group of students got up and read names of people who had recently been massacred,” Witchner said. “So if that happens that’s fine, and that could happen. That’s why we want to be out in the open about it, have merit behind why we’re doing it, and bring awareness.”
Names readings like the one Witchner and Pfeffer are organizing are part of a larger tradition of Holocaust remembrance. The country of Israel established a national holiday, Yom HaShoah, known in English as Holocaust Martyrs’ and Heroes’ Remembrance Day. According to Hillel’s official website, “In Israel, a mourning siren sounds, stopping all activity; people stand in honor of those who died. Jews around the world hold memorials and vigils, often lighting six candles in honor of the six million Holocaust victims. Many hold name-reading ceremonies to memorialize those who perished.”
There is also a strong tradition of remembering the approximately 1.5 million children who died in the Holocaust.
Witchner’s son participated in an act known as twinning. “What happens is you can either go to the local Holocaust center, or if your city doesn’t have one ... you [nationally] identify a young person who died in the Holocaust,” Witchner said. “If you’re a boy you would find a boy who died and never had a chance to be Bar Mitzvahed. And then you share that day with that young person.” Witchner’s son shared his Bar Mitzvah with a boy from their family who died when he was 12. 
In Witchner’s experience, names readings are captivating. “People will walk by, and usually people will stand and just observe,” she said. “People generally, when they know about [the reading], want to do it. They’re moved by it.”
Witchner is also glad to have a way to showcase Carnegie Mellon students’ compassion.“A lot of people are excited that students are doing this,” she said. “Because, you know, neighbors hear about Beeler Street and all of the wild stuff, and I think it’s great to have this thoughtful program. It’s small, but I think it’s important.”
Students interested in reading or volunteering at the event are encouraged to contact Sarah Pfeffer at sarahp@cmu.edu.

Celebrating their ancestry and culture, students of the Armenian Students Association of Pittsburgh organized an Armenian-themed event last Wednesday evening in the Dowd Room of the University Center.
The event began with a detailed presentation on Armenian history by Movses Musaelian, a sophomore statistics major. Musaelian’s presentation aimed to narrate an abridged version of the Armenian nation’s full history, spanning nearly five millennia.
Musaelian began his presentation by describing Armenia as a country that is often caught in the midst of conflicts among its neighbors. The nation has survived a long history of bloodshed and unrest and yet has thrived as a cultural melting pot.
The presentation also covered some aspects of the pre-Christian kingdom of Tigranes the Great — when Armenia saw its borders stretch from the Caspian Sea in the east to the Mediterranean in the west — and the medieval kingdom of Cilicia, which was a bastion of the Christian crusaders and which, as the presenter pointed out, was to be pronounced idiosyncratically in Armenian as “Kili-Kia.”
An important feature of the presentation was that Musaelian did not shirk from touching upon several controversial issues, such as the topics of Stalin’s divide-and-conquer tactics in Nakhchivan, the Armenian genocide of the early 1900s, the status of the Nagorno-Karabakh Republic, and the deep-rooted rivalry with neighboring Azerbaijan.
When asked by a member of the audience about the Russian designs in the South Ossetia region of Georgia, one of Armenia’s strongest allies, Musaelian replied, “Well, we cannot afford to apply the same [strategy] uniformly everywhere. We need to make compromises as we treasure our alliance with Russia deeply.”
The presentation switched its focus from past history to the current political and cultural issues plaguing Armenia.
“The neo-liberal economic policies adopted by the main political parties [have] led to the mere creation of a few hyper-wealthy Russian-styled oligarchs in Armenia,” said Musaelian, commenting on the socio-economic beliefs and predisposition against neo-liberal economics that currently pervade Armenian politics.
The concluding section of the presentation focused on the current geo-political game being played in the oil-rich Eurasian Caucasus, which represents the most coveted piece of strategic real estate in the world, according to global strategists. Musaelian addressed the complex and overlapping interests of the regional powers — namely Turkey, Iran, and Russia — which, along with the United States and Europe, have resulted in an extremely volatile atmosphere pervading the region.
The historical presentation was followed by traditional Armenian cuisine, hand-cooked by one of the event organizers, Alana Yoel, a senior mechanical engineering major. The most popular dish was the cheese boerag, which Yoel described as “basically an Armenian version of the Greek dish spanikopita. The filling is a blend of cheeses — many different versions, but I used a blend of ricotta, mozzarella, cheddar, and muenster — [as well as] parsley, egg, salt, and pepper.” There were also Armenian string cheese and Armenian squash patties to accompany the Ararat sour cherry and apricot jams, which are typical dishes of the region.
After the presentation, conversations were hosted by the other event organizers, Keghani Kristelle Kouzoujian, a fifth year senior computer science major, and Sandra Kalanyan, a sophomore architecture major. They gave students firsthand accounts of their experiences of being part of an Armenian diaspora. When quizzed about their desire to visit Armenia in the near future, the organizers nodded in unison, commenting how excited they were at the very thought of revisiting their homeland.
All of the organizers could read the Armenian script and still spoke the language fluently, portraying how they have remained in touch with their ethnic roots and culture.
As the curtains came down and the event ended, the attendees seemed to have learned a lot about Armenian culture and society.
The documentary and dinner was an enriching event for both those of Armenian heritage and other students alike; according to the Armenian Students Association’s website, “the club is for any student who is interested in learning about and experiencing the rich culture and history of Armenia.”

Chef Aldo Ramirez, an executive catering chef who works for Carnegie Mellon’s dining service CulinArt, is one of 10 chefs across the mid-Atlantic region to be selected to compete in the National Collegiate Culinary Challenge. Ramirez is the first chef from Carnegie Mellon to participate in this event.
This culinary competition — which is best described as “the Grammy equivalent of collegiate food service,” according to Shelby Cole, director of CulinArt student activities — is scheduled to run March 6–9 at the University of Richmond, in Virginia. If Ramirez does well, he will go on to the national competition, which will take place later this year.
For the competition, contestants will have 75 minutes to set up, cook, and serve a recipe of their choosing.
There are additional rules that make the competition much more interesting. For example, there is a required special ingredient that all cooks must use in their dish. In this competition, the mandatory ingredient is called Beef Tri-Tip, which is a cut of beef, similar to sirloin, often used to make steaks.
Another point of interest is that the competition is trying to promote healthy eating. There is a rule which requires that “The entrée recipe should be nutritionally balanced.” Competitors will be judged based on criteria such as cleanliness, organization, taste, and creativity.
On Wednesday, Ramirez participated in a trial run of the preparation session for the dishes that he will be preparing during the competition. He will be competing with Beef Ménage À Trois, or beef three-way.
It is named so peculiarly because it is a combination of three differently prepared cuts of beef, each with distinctive flavors. During his trial run, he had to utilize creative methods of preparation in order to make the dish within the allotted time frame.
For example, in one part of his preparation, Ramirez filled a glass up with smoke, using a smoker gun, and put it over the beef to add flavor to it in a quick way that would otherwise take a long time to do. One might think that the process of preparing a full meal in such a limited time period would appear frantic and messy. It was quite the contrary; Ramirez’s style of cooking was very precise and methodical.
Although this will be his first time cooking at the competitive level, Ramirez has had much cooking experience.
Ramirez says that he “originally wanted to become an engineer,” but he went into cooking instead. He started cooking when he was 15 by working at his father’s restaurant. 
Over the years, he has performed many cooking demonstrations, so he will be well prepared for the competition. Throughout his career he has worked at a resort and casino, and as a personal chef.
He has currently been working at Carnegie Mellon for CulinArt for a year, and his favorite part about his job is “the variety and challenges.”
All of the recipes that the competitors are using will be released to the public. So if students are looking for a new beef dish to try out, they might want to try out Ramirez’s Ménage À Trois, or one of the many other professional recipes that will be made available.

Campus services hosted a Mardi Gras event last Thursday with food, raffle prizes, and more in order to gain feedback about their products and services from students. Hosted in Wean Commons in the University Center, the event started at 5 p.m. and lasted until 7 p.m.
Students who registered at the event with their student ID cards were given a map of the different booths that were set up. They were then told to go to each booth and participate in surveys or answer questions in exchange for tokens that could then be used on some of the fun activities, like airbrush tattoos, fortune tellers, and palm readers.
“The event was fun — a tall lady gave me a hat,” said Marcia Solorzano, a junior mechanical engineer, after a stilt-walker had given her a balloon hat. Upon registering, students were also automatically entered into the raffle, with prizes ranging from an iPod to a $250 Visa gift card.
“Campus services provides a multitude of products and services to the community at large. All of these service providers were represented at the event including ... Copy Centers, Parking and Transportation Services, Postal Services, Printing and Mailing Services, the University Center, and the University Store ... as well as FedEx Office and PNC Bank,” said the director of campus services, Ryan Wolfe.
The theme and structure of the Mardi Gras event was designed to bring students out in a fun and personable way in order to gain constructive feedback and allow some of the “less visible departments like Copy Centers and Printing & Mailing Services the opportunity to interact with students.” 
This strategy seemed to have worked, with over 270 students participating in the event and over 500 responses to departmental surveys. With the event, campus services made an effort to improve themselves and strengthen their relations with students.
“Typically [we] just interact with students to hear complaints, but this way we can have a fun and relaxed way to get feedback,” said Parking Services Manager Michelle Porter. Parking Services, as well as other campus service organizations, had surveys that students could take on iPads at their booths. In addition, open discussions about how to improve certain services were initiated and facilitated by departmental managers.
Many students were surprised by the number of services available, as well as the time dedicated to getting student feedback.
“It looks like they put a lot of effort into [the event],” said Paul Carboni, a sophomore in H&SS. “I came in for the free food, but it’s actually a very effective and streamlined way of getting feedback.”
Campus services are also working on improvements for their existing services.
“We were able to talk to students about these ideas during the event, including a new system in the bookstore that will allow us to host used textbook classifieds for students,” Wolfe said, “as well as new websites for Copy Centers and Printing and Mailing Services that will allow students to submit documents for professional printing and copying.”
Wolfe also commented on how it was “clear that students were not fully aware of all the services available on campus” and were therefore not utilizing them to the fullest extent.
He hopes that events like this one will increase helpful interaction between campus services and students and generate an awareness of all the available services, allowing both parties to benefit from a respectful and communicative relationship.

Aron Ralston to be speaker at 114th Commencement
At Carnegie Mellon’s 114th Commencement Ceremony on May 15, Aron Ralston (E ’97) will speak about his life and his inspiring story of survival.
His story began in April 2003 in a Utah canyon, where he was trapped for almost a week by a half-ton boulder. Faced with this near-impossible situation, Ralston made the decision to amputate his right hand and escape. Afterward, he rappelled 65 feet and hiked seven miles to seek rescue.
His story is the focus of the movie 127 Hours, starring James Franco and directed by Danny Boyle. The movie is based on Ralston’s New York Times 2004 bestselling autobiography, Between a Rock and  Hard Place. 
At Carnegie Mellon, Ralston majored in mechanical engineering and French with a minor in piano performance. 
Ralston was a resident assistant as well as a member of seven honor societies. Ralston partially credits Carnegie Mellon’s training and education with helping him, in addition to his main source of inspiration: his family.
“He turned grave adversity into a learning and teaching experience for all of us. I know our graduates will enjoy and greatly benefit from hearing Aron speak,” said said President Jared L. Cohon in a recent press release.

Spring break starts this week for Carnegie Mellon University. Students are excited for their various vacation plans, whether they involve traveling to a tropical resort or just relaxing at home. However, spring break plans can often be taken too far. Drinking and excessive partying can all be dangerous factors in a student’s break plans. Here are some facts about spring break drinking:
10: average number of alcoholic drinks consumed per day by college students while on break
91%: percent of parents that want to stop spring break marketing that promotes dangerous drinking
75%: percent of college males who were intoxicated daily while on break
40%: percent of college females who passed out at least once from intoxication during break

House Rep. Tim Wahlberg (R–Mich.) succeeded in passing an amendment that would cut $20.5 million from the National Endowment for the Arts (NEA) this year, the largest cut to the NEA in 16 years. The amendment will work as part of a larger bill targeting AmeriCorps, PBS, and the National Endowment for the Humanities. The government is targeting these public programs instead of focusing on larger expenditures, such as defense. While sinking more than $950 billion into military defense, the government is attempting to trim down cultural services in order to stabilize its budget. Wahlberg stated that the private sector should be responsible for arts funding, and that the focus should be on building a better economy to allow that to happen. In the meantime, it looks as if Republicans want to push the arts aside for a couple of years until the federal budget gets back on track. Democrat Rep. Jim Moran (Va.) pointed out that Wahlberg’s amendment would be on top of a $22.5 million cut to NEA proposed early last week.
The bill, H.R. 1, would almost entirely eliminate nonprofit arts and humanities organizations, and force many larger organizations into filing bankruptcy or folding. The NEA serves as the largest grantmaker for the arts in the United States, and its current budget is roughly the same as Canada’s Council on the Arts, despite the difference in population. Many of the smaller arts organizations receive funding through museums and other local arts programs. With a total of $43 million cut across the NEA, many of these museums and programs would be in danger. Locations such as the Pittsburgh Children’s Museum, Carnegie Mellon’s own STUDIO for Creative Inquiry in CFA, and programs such as the Pittsburgh Arts Council have received generous grants from the NEA and may be in serious danger of extinction if the bill is passed.
The arts cuts pale in comparison to some of the rejected options, which included a $1.5 billion cut on spending on Iraq, the elimination of the Innovative Research Fund, and eliminating government sponsorship of NASCAR. It seems that the proposed cuts to the Defense department were all rejected, while many important organizations came under attack.
President Obama has threatened to veto the latest bill, stating that it will “sharply undermine core government functions and investments key to economic growth and job creation.” We hope that his threat turns into action, as many of us have enjoyed the great programs that have been made possible by the NEA. NEA grants normally require matching funds from non-federal sources, in an effort to promote partnership agreements. Many individual events and artists are frequently sponsored by the NEA, and these will likely be much more difficult to accommodate after the bill takes effect.
Americans for the Arts, a large national nonprofit organization, sent out a message urging readers to take a few minutes to contact both Senators and House Representatives about the bill. The group’s website, http://www.artusa.org, has links to alerts that can be sent out to Congress and local media outlets in an attempt to prevent Wahlberg’s amendment from passing. The Carnegie Mellon School of Art shared this information with staff and students, and we urge anyone interested to take a look and help in the fight.
Editorial Dissent
Celia Ludwinski
In our continuing recession, it is important to tighten our belts and sacrifice our luxuries. 
Investing in the arts is great for cultural development while the nation is riding a wave of success. However, it seems a little extravagant to spend our money on museums and performances while the job market, the housing market, and most of the economy is in the dumps. 
In fact, it seems almost negligent to use our national budget for superfluous indulgences during these tough times, especially since it requires that we either neglect other essential programs or go further into debt. 
I would much rather have a stable job waiting for me when I graduate than have government-funded art programs. 
Once our economy is back on track, it will be appropriate for funding of the arts to be reinstated. But for now, this cut seems appropriate and promises a quicker recovery of our economy.

President Obama might have bitten off more than he can chew during his administration. Multiple issues such as the economy, health care, and the ongoing war have been tackled in one way or the other. While many of these issues have taken top billing in the president’s agenda with hallmark legislation being passed, the president has still tried to ensure that education is a top priority. Obama established the “Race to the Top” program in 2009, aiming to improve children’s education nationwide. The program awards funds to schools based on a number of different criteria, including “great teachers and leaders, state success factors, standards and assessments, data systems to support instruction and interventions the lowest-achieving school.”
Despite its worthy goals, we take issue with this program. At first glance, this is a great program. “Race to the Top” seeks to solve some serious issues facing public education in America, something everyone can support. Obama’s program has good intentions, but it fails to actually solve the educational issues at hand.
Obama has praised his program endlessly, but without merit. Under “Race to the Top,” only a handful of states have actually received any funding. The “Race to the Top” inspires competitiveness by requiring state schools to fill out a detailed application before obtaining funding from the program. According to CNN.com, rural states were at a disadvantage in receiving aid because they could not gather the resources needed to fill out the government application. Indeed, the application for “Race to the Top” was so competitive and required so many governmental changes that only 12 states ended up receiving any aid.
A bigger issue with Obama’s program is its vagueness — what exactly does raising student achievement entail? Furthermore, what is the point in giving more aid to already innovative and high-performing schools? The money could be better spent on schools that have a history of low graduation rates, low retention rates, and the like. What this program should be focusing on is how to help low-performing schools succeed.
The “Race to the Top” program also creates serious issues for teachers and faculty administration. The program encourages states to evaluate teachers in relation to their students’ performances. There is a plethora of reasons why students succeed and fail academically — reasons that are completely independent of the teacher. This type of teacher evaluation seems to put the sole blame on teachers when their students receive low scores.
It is obvious that “Race to the Top,” like “No Child Left Behind,” has good intentions. However, there are inherent flaws in the program’s policies that, no matter what, will not solve the problem it hopes to address. If Obama really wants to make improving education a priority, he needs to drastically change his approach and formulate a plan that allows more struggling schools to receive funds.

In mid-February, the Libyan people, inspired by the successful revolts in Egypt, took to the streets to protest Moammar Gadhafi, who has controlled the country for over 40 years. 
Gadhafi’s response to the protests, however, was far more violent than anyone had anticipated: He ordered the military to fire upon protesters, had them shoot civilians from helicopters, and hired mercenaries from neighboring countries when he couldn’t find enough Libyan men willing to slaughter their own people. Photographs of five-inch bullets, the same bullets reportedly being used on Libyan citizens, circulated the Internet, as did gruesome videos of the military shooting at protesters.
The mainstream media’s coverage of Libya, however, has included none of these images, and instead of discussing the events in Libya has focused on other events. A Google News search about Libya brings up little about the conflict. Instead, one learns from  The Washington Post that the crisis in Libya has sent stocks sliding. The Guardian informs readers that Gadhafi’s Ukrainian nurse, with whom he was rumored to be having an affair, has returned to Ukraine, and adds that Gadhafi has a “fear of staying on upper floors, dislike of flying over water and love of flamenco.” The New York Times speculates about the power vacuum that might develop if Gadhafi should lose power. None of these articles includes any information about what is currently happening in Libya.
Granted, it may be difficult to obtain information about the current happenings in Libya — Gadhafi has barred foreign journalists from entering the country and has attempted to place a blackout on all communications within the country. 
However, a quick search for “Libya” on social media sites Twitter and Tumblr brings up a plethora of images, videos, and information from Libya, all of which are valuable primary sources that the mainstream media doesn’t seem interested in covering.
The violence in Libya is horrific, but it is the media’s responsibility to inform the world of what is happening. These revolts are history in the making, yet newspapers seem more concerned with Gadhafi’s love life and interests than with the hundreds, if not thousands, of citizens that have died because of him. 
Hopefully the Libyan people will be able to continue relaying information to the outside world via social media sites, and hopefully they know that, despite the failings of mainstream media, there are plenty of people working to gather as much information about the events in Libya as they can.

It is no stretch of the imagination to say that multiculturalism is important to Carnegie Mellon. Our school strives for diversity on every level and has had great success. There are students and faculty from around the world learning and teaching a variety of subjects. Multiculturalism is a part of our school’s identity.
Recently, Prime Minister David Cameron of Great Britain gave a speech that essentially stated that multiculturalism has failed in his country. France’s President Nicolas Sarkozy and Germany’s Chancellor Angela Merkel have echoed similar sentiments in their own countries. The most salient point of Cameron’s speech was that multiculturalism fails when it is allowed to manifest itself in disparate communities that have little contact or connection.
Cameron’s speech wasn’t necessarily intended to be about multiculturalism and its advantages and disadvantages. He was talking about the problem of terrorism in Britain and its roots. Cameron argued that Britain’s codified policy on multiculturalism allows for segregated communities and that British youth born into these communities may not feel like they belong. Because there is no larger sense of a British identity, these men and women turn to extremist groups, in what Cameron calls a “process of radicalization.” 
The change he calls for in Britain is for its citizens to stand against groups that support Islamic extremism. He believes it is every citizen’s duty to protect certain rights: freedom of speech; freedom of worship; democracy; the rule of law; equal rights regardless of race, sex, or sexuality. Any group that has values or practices counterproductive to these rights must be stopped. As a start, he proposes reforms such as ending public funding of any group that does not support these rights and promoting English as the language of all citizens. 
When I first read the text of Cameron’s speech, I thought it made a lot of sense. My take-away was that a country can have many cultures, but they have to meet certain overarching rules. If these rules are not met, the group will be punished. I also strongly believe in the importance of a national identity so that people feel connected to their fellow countrymen. I don’t think a country can function if its citizens feel no shared ideologies with their neighbors. But recently I’ve realized how complex this problem really is. It’s nice to imagine Cameron’s Britain, where everyone believes in certain freedoms but can have separate cultural identities apart from the larger national one. In practice it might not be so easy. Even in the United States there are conflicts between the national standard and cultural groups.
For instance, this week in San Francisco there has been significant interest in proposing a ballot measure to ban male circumcision. Let me be clear that this is not being voted on and as of now does not have the required signatures to be brought to a vote. 
But even the idea of banning circumcision has brought about a reaction from the Anti-Defamation League, the local Jewish Community Relations Council, the Board of Rabbis of Northern California, and the American Jewish Committee in San Francisco. While proponents of the ballot argue that this is a human rights issue, the joint statement from the Jewish community stated that the initiative “would interfere with the rights of parents to make religious decisions for their own families.” Proponents of the bill counter by saying that the practice is male genital mutilation and propose that only men over the age of 18 can opt to have the procedure. Failure to comply with the regulation would carry a $1,000 fine.
It’s already easy to see why Cameron’s rules and divisions are more effortlessly discussed than implemented. A similar measure on a grander scale was seen in France. Recently, President Sarkozy pushed forward legislation that banned the wearing of burqas or other full-body robes in public. No religious affiliation was singled out or exempted in the bill, although some groups, such as surgical robes for doctors, were allowed work exceptions. Certain politicians supported the bill by saying that active citizenship requires face-to-face contact. However, critics believe the bill is a manifestation of Islamophobia in France. So how are the lines drawn? Do parents have the right to choose if their son is circumcised? Is wearing a burqa truly an impediment to being a French citizen?
As cultures continue to mix, countries will be forced to address these questions. What we should remember throughout this process is that there is value in multiculturalism: We see it every day at Carnegie Mellon. You’re reminded that there is not only one way to think about a problem, not only one way to express an idea. 
So although the questions are hard to answer and complex, they are worth considering. Without thoughtful consideration, cultural identities will be marginalized or lost. And that is a loss that everyone would feel.

The Appropriations Committee in the House of Representatives has recently proposed a slew of cuts in its budget proposal for the 2011 year. One of these cuts will eliminate AmeriCorps as a part of the continuing resolution to fund the government for the remainder of this fiscal year. Luckily, these cuts are currently only proposed, and they would have to be approved by the Senate and the White House in order to be enacted. These proposals, however, represent an increasing apathy toward national service — an apathy that I, for one, am disgusted by.
Eliminating AmeriCorps will not only effectively cripple the volunteer work of individuals participating in the program, but will also cripple non-governmental organizations that rely heavily on the manpower of AmeriCorps participants. These participants, who are paid a small stipend to cover basic housing and food costs, save organizations from the costs of hiring employees outside of AmeriCorps. A recent Wyoming study published in the Casper Star-Tribune cited that national service programs provide $220 million in direct services to Wyoming annually at a cost of $3.7 million to the federal government. The study estimates that if AmeriCorps were eliminated, 862 jobs would be lost in addition to more than $850,000 in higher education money.
Like Wyoming, Pennsylvania also relies heavily on national service programs. In 2011 AmeriCorps will provide more than 3,700 individuals the opportunity to provide what Americorps.gov calls intensive, results-driven service to meet education, environmental, health, economic and other pressing needs in communities across Pennsylvania. AmeriCorps organizational funding in Pennsylvania generally passes through the governor-appointed PennSERVE: the Governor’s Commission of Citizen Service, which in turn awards grants to nonprofit groups to respond to local needs.
In Pittsburgh, AmeriCorps participants are actively working in education, health, and community-building organizations across the city. Pittsburgh AmeriCorps programs include KEYS Service Corps, Pittsburgh Health Corps, Public Allies, JumpStart and Literacy*AmeriCorps — all of which would be affected negatively by the elimination of the national program. Funding cuts to AmeriCorps, which would lead to the eventual end of the program, will severely damage the state of service in our nation. Potential participants and the organizations they would work with will be rendered useless by funding cuts.

Though few remember it, iBurgh, a smartphone application that allowed users to document potholes on their way to work, was released last year. While it seemed popular at the time, with over 3,000 downloads within its first week of release, it appears now that the iBurgh has ceased to exist, leaving Pittsburgh residents to use the city’s outdated manual pothole reporting website.
We are saddened that this innovative application was only temporary; we would like to see our city embrace technology as a solution to its problems. The forward-thinking mindset that brought about the iBurgh app is a great way to address many of the complaints Pittsburgh residents seem to have.
We have but to look to the citizens of Boston, who have set a great example for such a groundbreaking new technology. Their idea builds on the goals of the iBurgh app. The city’s new app is slated to automatically detect and report Boston potholes. Every time a user’s car hits a bump, his or her phone will be jostled too. By using the built-in accelerometer, the phone will be able to detect any road anomalies and will be able to automatically transmit the GPS-determined location of the potholes to the city.
Boston’s new app improves upon all the downfalls of the iBurgh app, which included glitches that stopped the data from being reported to the city and the absence of a method for users to track their complaints. 
Users who were previously unlikely to take the time to document and report every pothole to the city via the 311 system most likely found that the iBurgh app required less effort, but inferior results. However, the new app being developed in Boston will not demand user input, and it is much more likely to be successful.
We believe this new app is an innovative and (we hope) glitch-free step toward more efficient government services. Automatic transmission of civic problems is a great way for the city to gain input on where it needs to focus its attention and resources. 
The city of Boston is setting a great example; we can only hope that this merging of technology and civic services will expand to other cities and to other programs and applications.

Let’s talk about how video gaming used to be. Games were works of art — they held their own. They had memorable characters and engrossing storylines, but most importantly, they connected us emotionally to a different world that we could become a part of. For a second now, let’s just remember how we wanted to live in Hyrule, how we wanted to be in the realm of the Final Fantasy series, and — even further back — how we found depth in the simplicity of Super Mario and Sonic. What happened?
Technology and video gaming have an interesting relationship. Increases in processing power and graphics capabilities of newer consoles have allowed for the creation of larger, more immersive worlds. However, it often appears as if these popular new games have replaced imagination with technology. Instead of a deep story line with multi-faceted characters, it’s a great depth of field and multi-faceted textures that are touted. And with the number of sequels that have been released in the past few years, it seems that companies are just squeezing out the successes of an older series to the last penny. 
How many games of Call of Duty do we need to play before we realize how unremarkable the impact of the game really was? Granted, it’s fun to shoot your friends, but that sometimes seems to be the game’s only appeal. Perhaps technology is stepping on the toes of creativity. Take Guitar Hero as an example. What was the number of sequels and spin-offs? If you answered “more than enough,” then it comes as no surprise that Activision has finally closed the division responsible for the series after reports of falling sales. Guitar Hero was once renowned for its challenge, competitiveness, and innovative style, but the novelty of the game declined with increasing varieties and prices of controllers and song selections that only seemed to worsen with each series. With new sequels and game expansions being released within the same year, it is no wonder that the interest in Guitar Hero began to decline.
Furthermore, Activision has recently announced the revival of Spyro the Dragon — a name that anyone growing up in the ’90s would recognize. Skylanders: Spyro’s Adventure is the newest title in the series. So, great, another sequel that only leads us to wonder what the improvement will be. Will it be more polygons, or maybe some interactivity with a sensor bar? Hold on to these two sensors and flap your arms to make Spyro fly! As it turns out, Activision will also be releasing a line of plastic figurines that will act as a sort of portable save file for a player’s character. The player can carry around this figurine and put it on a stand that will recognize the save file stored in the figurine and convert it into a playable character in the game. 
Wait a minute — this seems similar to something else far more common. Being able to play as your own character with your friends without having to start a new game if you’re not playing on your own system? Having some sort of save file that can be accessed anywhere? Aha! These are just your standard Internet login accounts, commercialized into plastic gimmicks, with the anticipation that they would seem like an innovation to video gaming.
Maybe Activision is targeting younger audiences by combining video games with toys, but the figurines do not seem to add anything to the game itself. What fans of gaming don’t want are more components that may not enhance the gaming experience. The figurines themselves say nothing about the game. It could very well be the most captivating and enjoyable Spyro game in the series. But this is a time when technology does not exactly equal improvement.
There was once a time when video games were promoted for their playability, rather than the auxiliary items that one would have to purchase in order to play the game. There was also a time when games, even within a series, had distinct qualities that made them memorable. Of course, nostalgia is a cunning troublemaker to the companionship of memory. 
But in the world of video games, I’d soon trade a tangible object for another chance to say goodbye to Saria. Admittedly, we are in an experimental period in gaming technology, as we try to bridge interactivity with video gaming. It may seem as if companies are hanging on to older franchises, but the future of video gaming is something we will always eagerly anticipate.

Remember: What happens during spring break stays on the Internet forever.
If you're not going anywhere for spring break, then turn the heat up in your room and pretend you're somewhere tropical.
Your Megabus ride to your spring break destination will be interesting — and by interesting, I mean terrible, because you thought it was a good idea to party before going on a long, bumpy bus ride. Great idea huh?
I know what you did last spring break, and all I can say is "ew."
You will make a new friend in a complete stranger. Make sure you do a background check before you invite him over.
Staring at the clock on your cell phone will not make time go faster. It will, however, cause your depression to grow at an exponential rate.
Don't get mad — get Glad. If that doesn't work, then get even.
No prediction could be better than knowing that you can sleep soon.
Your mid-semester grades will surprise you. I'm not saying whether it will be for better or for worse, but it will be a surprise nonetheless.
Someone you don't always listen to will become the one person whose advice you will seek this week. The scary thing is, that person is you.
You should start to prepare your spring hibernation kit. Make sure you have a warm blanket, a charged cell phone, ready-made snacks, and ear plugs.
Four more days, four more days, four more days.
