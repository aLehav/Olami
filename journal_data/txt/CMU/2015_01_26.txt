Breaking a school record in varsity basketball is an accomplishment that every athlete strives for, but one that only a brilliant few reach. Sophomore psychology major Lisa Murphy plays for the women’s basketball team and broke not one or two, but five school records in her first year.
Murphy’s remarkable journey began in the third grade, when Murphy’s passion for sports shone through as she joined her House League and was involved in a multitude of sports. 
Unlike most athletes, Murphy did not have any expectations from the time she put into sports; all she wanted was to have fun with it — an attribute that she admirably still holds on to today.
Murphy first grew close to basketball as a sport during her first year of high school. It was then that she started to admire the beauty of the sport and the skill it required. Despite not being let onto her varsity team during her first year, Murphy exhibited her tenacity by practicing harder and building herself as a player until she became a starter on her varsity team in her sophomore year. Since then, she has plowed through obstacles and achieved goal after goal as she scores point after point on the court. She attributes much of her success to the guidance of her high school Coach Michael O’Brien and the support and love of her family.
Murphy chose to continue her already impressive high school career at Carnegie Mellon because she felt that “it had all the little puzzle pieces” that she wanted in a school: A good program for her major, location in a cool city, great teammates and a fantastic coaching staff. Murphy has a multidimensional personality, and wanted to study psychology to pursue her desire of working with children with special needs in a therapeutic setting in the future. When it came to basketball, all that mattered to Murphy was being “part of a growing, on-the-rise program where [she] could have an impact.” And so began her Tartan tale.
Murphy, whose game revolved around finesse (much like her idol Tim Duncan), had to adjust to the increased pace and physicality of college basketball. Nonetheless, Murphy came in ready to work hard once again and had no expectations from all that she put in. Murphy started all twenty six games in her freshman year and led the team in points, rebounds and blocks. She was named UAA Rookie of the Year and made it to the All-UAA First Team. She set school records in points scored, field goals made, field-goal percentage, free throws made and free throws attempted. This was not enough for Murphy, whose focus still remains on improving as an individual and as part of the Tartans. It is hardly a surprise, then, that she draws great inspiration from Head Coach Jacquie Hullah, who Murphy holds in high regard for the coach’s ability to facilitate team and individual development.
When asked about her daily basketball mindset, she had this to say: “I just want to work hard on the court and support my teammates. I try to use my agility and finesse to trump the opposition, and am working on other facets of my game as well.”
Despite brilliant independent performances, the Tartan girls have not managed to hold onto their leads for the last two games. Murphy admitted that she thinks the Tartans need to maintain their opening communication and execution and acknowledged that she wanted to focus more on getting into position, avoiding double teams and kicking the ball out in time. Murphy’s aims for the next few games are to help her teammates dictate the tempo of the game and force the opposition to play Tartan basketball.
It is inspiring to see how Murphy has grown from a young girl who used to play with her elder brother using the hoop in their backyard to a college varsity player who is a force to be reckoned with both on and off the court.

The popularity of the Super Bowl is based on just about everything but the game played on the field.
Sure, the game features the two theoretically “best” teams, but as last year’s blowout featuring the Seattle Seahawks and — what we were told was —  the Denver Broncos showed us, the mantra of “any given Sunday” can apply to blowouts just as easily as it can to upsets and comebacks.
There is a fairly good chance that this Super Bowl could be far less entertaining than the Seahawks’ crazy come-from-behind overtime victory last week in the NFC Championship Game over the Green Bay Packers or the New England Patriots coming back from not one, but two 14 point deficits in the divisional round against the Baltimore Ravens. Toss those on top of the controversy and media circus surrounding the Dallas Cowboys’ two playoff games (the picked up flag vs the Detroit Lions and the clearly — but not technically — caught pass against the Packers) and I’m willing to bet that the most entertaining football that this season has to offer is past us.
What truly makes the Super Bowl “super” is the surrounding entertainment. You have sports (and now news) media covering and breaking down every aspect of the Seahawks and Patriots, arguing about possible personnel matchups; how Seattle’s “Legion of Boom,” with shutdown corner Richard Sherman and hard hitting safety Earl Thomas both nursing injuries, can match up against the human wrecking ball that is New England Patriots tight end Rob Gronkowski and wide receiver/trick play quarterback Julian Edelman; or if the Seahawks’ lack of a fundamental passing attack can be a benefit against the Patriots’ top corner Darrelle Revis and former Legion of Boom member cornerback Brendan Browner, the strengths of the revamped Patriot defense.
These conversations take place as the filler pieces between the things that “really” matter, such as “Deflate-gate,” a.k.a. “Ball-ghazi.” The accusations that New England intentionally deflated their game balls 2 psi below the regulated minimum has led to a more detailed reading and breakdown of a non-gameplay aspect of the league’s rulebook than many of the fans gave to their college textbooks, and has seen the Ideal Gas Law get more media attention than at any other point in history. This may be the only scandal the NFL is enjoying, given it has turned the spotlight away from the league’s many issues with domestic violence, most notably surrounding Ray Rice, Adrian Peterson and Greg Hardy, and the recent report which proved the NFL commissioners’ office of being both utterly incompetent in the investigation and of blatantly lying to both the owners and the press back in September, in a matter very similar to former Raven Ray Lewis’ deer antler spray controversy before their appearance in the 2012 Super Bowl which masked the New Orleans Saints bounty aftermath.
All of these controversies and media stories still only focus on the football aspect of the Super Bowl, which, while most important, is by no means the only reason millions of Americans tune in on Superbowl Sunday. The halftime show is one of the biggest and shortest concerts of the year, with as many watching for the enjoyment of music as to hate-watch the performers (the Black Eyed Peas’ technical malfunctions in 2011) or enjoy the eye-candy effects and performers while secretly hoping for another wardrobe malfunction à la Janet Jackson. This year’s combo of Katy Perry and Lenny Kravitz marks the second straight year (Bruno Mars and the Red Hot Chili Peppers last year) of a young pop star mashing up with a newish rock act to try and appease everyone while thrilling no one.
The final piece of the Super Bowl media megastorm is the one thing current society is working ever so hard to phase out: commercials. 
In the age where everyone has a DVR — assuming they even still have cable — Ad Block is the most-used extension, and pirating/streaming on demand media is viewed as a way to minimize precious viewing seconds being wasted on ads, the Super Bowl has transformed advertising from nuisance to entertainment. With hundreds of top ten lists of funniest, most classic, raciest, and worst Super Bowl commercials, they have become as much a part of the game as the football itself. Millions of dollars are spent on the airtime alone, not accounting for the production budget. The big game is the one time people prefer you to talk over the program and not the ads, as the color commentators generally have far less to offer than an ad from Doritos or Budweiser.
All of the hype for all three aspects of the game is pushed by the media. If you wanted to see in-depth breakdowns of the match ups of giant Seahawks safety Kam Chancellor and Gronkowski, or New England middle linebacker Dont’a Hightower and Seattle halfback Marshawn “Beast Mode” Lynch, and somehow haven’t found one yet, you just are not trying hard enough. Same goes for “Deflate-gate,” which led all three national news broadcasts Thursday evening, or Lynch’s perpetual fines for inappropriate celebration/lack of media cooperation. We haven’t even hit Super Bowl media day, and ESPN has been all NFL all the time with minor inconvenient interruptions for the NBA.
At the end of the day, I think the Seahawks will win a close game 21-20, but ultimately that’s not why we care. Sure, one of the nation’s northern shoreline communities will be ecstatic and the other in a likely drunken rage, but for the vast majority of us, we are merely spectators hoping to be entertained. 
And while there are no guarantees that the game will provide that (conspiracy theories of Jerry Jones and the Cowboys fixing the playoff game against the Lions aside), halftime and the commercials will.
If you really want to make the game matter, Vegas and the Internet have you covered with more prop bets than any one reasonable human could ever think of (coin toss head or tails, length of the national anthem, color of the Gatorade tossed on the winning coaches head and movement of the stock market the next day just to name a few non-game related ones). 
But, really, just sit back, knock back a few beers (or root beers, depending on age) and enjoy the perfect storm of entertainment as created and developed by the media and the world’s most media-driven league.

The Carnegie Mellon men’s and women’s basketball teams took a road trip to Rochester on Friday to continue University Athletic Association (UAA) conference play in a double header against University of Rochester.
The women kicked off the evening trying to shake off their back-to-back home losses last weekend and took the quick lead with an opening layup by sophomore center Lisa Murphy. Unfortunately, that 2–0 led was the only advantage the Tartans were going to get in the opening half. They quickly fell in a hole as the team was cold on the offensive end. The only saving grace was Rochester’s similar shooting woes, exacerbated by the Tartans’ defense, which caused the deficit to never climb to more than 7 and let Tartans go on a run to end the half, culminating in junior forward Liza Otto’s game tying jump shot with 11 seconds left in the half to send the teams into the locker room knotted up at 23–23.
In the second half, the teams played to a draw through the first 14 minutes of the period with the score tied at 44 apiece going into the home stretch. The Tartans took the lead for good with first-year guard Njaire Mckoy’s jump shot with just under six minutes to go, but didn’t start creating separation from the Yellowjackets until Murphy rattled off 6 straight free throws and senior guard Chandler Caufield hit a three-pointer and two more free throws to push the lead to double digits. Junior guard Lindsay Poss, freshman forward Zoe Zawisa and Murphy made their free throws as the clock wound down to seal the victory at 68–57. Murphy finished the game with a double–double (29 points and 16 rebounds) to go along with a perfect 13–13 from the free throw line.
While the win is certainly a happy one for the Tartans as it pushes them to 2–2 in UAA play and 10–4 on the season, there was cause for concern with Carnegie Mellon continuing the shooting issues that have plagued them throughout conference play, having shot under 40% from the field in all four games.
The men’s team also came out with something to prove after losing their last game against New York University on a missed game tying three-pointer as the clock ran down. Coming with a vengeance, the Tartans scored the first three baskets to jump to an early 6–0 lead.
Unfortunately, Rochester quickly recovered to turn the game into a dog fight throughout the half with neither team able to gain more than three points of breathing room on the scoreboard until a layup by sophomore center Chris Shkil made the Tartan lead 4 and the Tartans pushed it all the way to five on a three-pointer by senior guard Jasen Blakeny, before two Rochester free throws cut the Tartans’ lead to 33–30 going into half time.
Coming out of half, it was more of the same for the first five minutes until a series of Tartan turnovers and missed shots let the Yellowjackets go on a 14–0 run that Carnegie Mellon could just barely recover from. The Tartans fought back and managed to cut the deficit to three on three-pointer by junior guard Jason Sebak but a layup and successful free throw on the and one attempt pushed the lead to 6 and sealed the game with Carnegie Mellon losing 65–60.
The loss drops the Tartans to 1–3 in UAA play and 10–5 on the season. Sophomore forward Jack Serbin led the losing effort as the top scorer and rebounder with 11 points and 12 rebounds for another double double.
Both Carnegie Mellon teams played Sunday in Atlanta against Emory and will continue their conference road play next weekend when they travel to Washington University of St. Louis and the University of Chicago.

“[Swimming is] an outlet for all the stresses life brings,” first-year electrical and computer engineering (ECE) major and swimmer Kevin Steinhouse said as we sat in the Gates Hillman Complex’s Fifth Floor Commons. “[It makes me] a little more calm coming out of practices.”
It better: The schedule Steinhouse endures as a swimmer would make most Carnegie Mellon students balk. His mornings start at 5:20 a.m. on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday, when many of us are just putting the finishing touches on our homework. He dedicates himself to his sport, however, and it shows.
Steinhouse currently holds the school record for the 50-yard freestyle with a time of 20.77 seconds and also has the Carnegie Mellon men’s swim team’s best time on the year for the 100-yard freestyle at 46.33 seconds. Steinhouse knew coming in that he had come close to these times in high school, and made it his goal to surpass them, something he did just as the swim team’s season began. Already a record holder, Steinhouse still has much more he wishes to accomplish as both a Carnegie Mellon student and a swimmer.
Much of Steinhouse’s success can be attributed to his training. While he was close to the record times he set at Carnegie Mellon, he says he has improved by adding weight training to his routine, something he had not done before. He specifically mentioned the use of power racks, a device that provides weighted resistance against him swimming. 
About two weeks before meets, he will lower the intensity of his training, allowing himself to recover and be at peak performance for large meets.
Steinhouse gives some of the credit for his motivation to his teammates, particularly senior chemical engineering major Josh Lucheon.
“When it matters most, he steps up,” said Steinhouse. However, it wasn’t always that way. In Steinhouse’s high school, people were mandated to play a sport, so many who were on the swim team were not competitive swimmers. 
“Only about five or six people actually wanted to be there,” he said.
He prefers college, where the depth of talent and enjoyment for swimming makes the environment more competitive and, in his eyes, more fun. The appreciation for the teammates around him has also contributed to competitive success, where he participated in the 200-yard freestyle relay that broke another school record at 1:23.50 and might send that squad to the NCAA tournament.
Steinhouse’s athletic goals are not complete, though. In addition to breaking the 50-yard freestyle record, he has qualified for the NCAA B-cut in that event. He has his eyes set on the one hundred-yard freestyle record, which he plans on breaking before the end of the year.
Steinhouse has been an athlete for a long time, joining a summer league when he was four. However, he was not a competitive swimmer until his sophomore year of high school. He played soccer and basketball, and swimming was not his primary high school sport; that distinction belonged to water polo. He plans to join the club water polo team after swimming season is over.
In addition to being a swimmer, Steinhouse also has an interest in science. He said that early on he knew he wanted to involve math and science in his studies and settled on engineering. An affinity for programming pushed him toward ECE specifically, and he picked out 15-112 as a favorite class. While college surprised him with its difficulty, he claims to be adjusting well to his new surroundings. His success in the swimming pool shows he can adapt well to new surroundings.
While first-year students often struggle amid the tumult of a new home and a new team, Steinhouse has truly shone as an athlete. Less than a season into his time here at Carnegie Mellon, his swimming accomplishments have likely just scratched the surface of his potential.

Swimming and Diving
In their final home meet of the season, the Carnegie Mellon men’s and women’s swimming and diving teams hosted Denison University on Saturday. Unfortunately, this was not a happy end to the Tartans’ home season as Denison, ranked 2nd in Division III men’s swimming and diving and 3rd in women’s, outpaced Carnegie Mellon in almost every event and took their foot off the gas as they cruised to a 170–104 win over the women and a 174–95 win over the men.
Each team was able to pick up a lone swimming win, with junior Kira Singahus grabbing the 100 yard backstroke with a time of 59.87 for the women and sophomore Brian Walsh getting the men’s sole first place finished with a 1:52.50 finish in the 200 yard butterfly. On the diving side, sophomore Machika Kaku put up the top score in the 1 meter diving with a time of 296.10 while the men continued the diving woes that have been plaguing them all season.
The rest of the meet was a severe beating on the Tartans, with the score only looking close once Denison began putting several of their top teams as exhibitions to ensure Carnegie Mellon got some more scoring points.
The Tartans will not have much time to lick their wounds as they face off next weekend against University of Pittsburgh.
Track & Field
The Carnegie Mellon men’s and women’s track and field teams traveled to Denison on Saturday to compete in the Lid–Lifter Invitational. The men won the event with 111.5 team points, over 20 more than the runner-up, and the women placed in second with 89.5 points, only placing behind Division II California University of Pa.
The men dominated the 800-meter run, taking five of the top six spots. Led by winning senior Thomas Vandenberg with a time of 1:54.09, the Tartans swept spots 3–6 with junior Marc–Daniel Julien, sophomore Owen Norley, junior Thomas Mayo–Smith and first-year Evan Larrick finishing with times of 1:58.34, 2:00.74, 2:00.91 and 2:01.77, respectively. Sophomore Curtis Watro continued the streak with a first place win in the mile run with a time of 4:28.14, being beaten only by a Denison Alumni.
The men kept up the distance domination in the distance relay with the team of seniors Eamon Cullinane and Benjamin Walker along with first-years Anirudh Ramakrishnan and Joseph Pickens winning with a time of 10:56.25 and sophomore Brian Bollens placing second in the 3000 meter run with a time of 9:04.90.
On the women’s side, they also excelled in the distance runs taking the top three and five of the top six in the 3000 meter run. Senior Sophie Lohman won the event in a time of 11:10.91, with junior Kira Ragazzo and first-year Natalie Smith rounding out the top three with times of 11:12.96 and 11:17.31, respectively. First-years Aparna Alavilli and Rhiannon Farney took fifth and sixth with times of 11:30.95 and 11:39.65 respectively.
The women also took second in the 4x400 meter relay with first-years Jerilyn James and Sarah Cook along with sophomores Emily Swanson and Ariel Tian combining for a time of 4:18.20. In the field events, sophomore Rebecca Fortner had a second-place finish in the high jump clearing the 1.52 meter bar.
The Tartans will next compete Saturday at Case Western Reserve University.

Football is always a game of matchups. In no particular order, here are five things that might swing this year’s Super Bowl:
The Seahawks have had a lot of trouble covering tight ends this year. Two examples in particular stand out. The first is their utter failure to contain San Diego Chargers’ tight end Antonio Gates earlier in the season. He exploded in the red zone, as he was too quick and too large a target for the Seahawks’ linebacking corps, and caught three touchdowns for the day. The second is the Seahawks’ bizarre schematic hiccup against the Kansas City Chiefs. Chiefs’ tight end Travis Kelce did not collect a ton of stats, but the Seahawks linebackers bent their zones heavily in Kelce’s direction, which opened up a ton of room for the Chiefs running game and led to a big day from Chiefs halfback Jamaal Charles. The Seahaws rank 18th in Football Outsiders’ DVOA (Defensive Value Over Average) against tight ends and also struggle with passes in the seams, so New England Patriots’ tight end Rob Gronkowski, a player who combines Kelce’s size and strength with Gates’s athleticism, could have yet another monster day for the Pats. If the Seahawks choose to collapse on him, Patriots halfback LeGarette Blount might benefit the holes they leave.
While Patriots’ cornerback Darelle Revis has been solid on the right (from the offense’s perspective) side of the field, former Seahawk cornerback Brandon Browner has left a gaping hole in New England’s defense on the other side. The team ranks 17th in DVOA on passes to second wide receivers and 27th on defending passes to the left side. While the Seahawks are not exactly known for their illustrious wide receiver corps, wide receiver Jermaine Kearse has exploded in recent weeks, including the playoffs, and he occupies a space where the Patriots are very weak. He could have a huge impact on the outcome.
New England has a huge special teams advantage in this game, ranking fifth in DVOA to Seattle’s 19th. New England kicker Stephen Gotskowski has much more range and consistency than his Seahawks’ counterpart Stephen Hauschka. Throw in New England’s success with punt returns and the Seahawks’ extraordinary season long difficulty with them and field position could have a huge effect in this one.
The Patriots do not have a very versatile front seven. Beyond outside linebacker Dont’a Hightower, everyone in their defensive front is either a run stopper who is too slow to rush the passer or a pass rusher who has trouble adjusting to run plays. This is a disaster against Seattle’s quarterback Russell Wilson, and halfback Marshawn Lynch. Wilson has an incredible ability to duck pass rushers and either throw the ball or make plays with his feet. Considering the Patriots’ trouble in coverage, this could lead to some huge gains, and Wilson will not have to do too much to avoid the Patriots pass rush. Lynch could also have a field day, as New England’s pass rush often takes itself out of run plays leaving two or three guys in the box. Lynch breaks three man tackles in his sleep. We might be in for another beast quake. There’s really nothing the Seahawks do that plays into the Patriots’ strengths.
Patriots’ wide receiver Brandon LaFell is 6’3” and 210 pounds. This is marginally larger than the giant Seahawks cornerbacks trying to cover him. Other than that, the Patriots have a tiny wide receiver corps by NFL standards. This could be an issue since it decreases the target size for Patriots’ quarterback Tom Brady to something that is easily covered by the likes of Seahawks cornerbacks Richard Sherman and Byron Maxwell, 6’3” and 195 pounds and 6’1” and 207 pounds respectively. Throw in Seahawks’ safeties Kam Chancellor, a man who was once described by Sherman as a “destroyer of souls,” and Earl Thomas, the best coverage safety in the league, and it could be a long day for the Patriots’ wide receivers. The factor of the deflated footballs is not to be discounted here either. A solid estimate says Brady started authorizing the deflation shortly after the Chiefs embarrassed him on national TV, a moment when his accuracy bizarrely spiked for three months. The footballs will likely not be deflated this weekend, which could cause a minor decrease in precision, further exaggerating this issue.
Either way, it should be a close and exciting game.

There’s a new player in the world of poker, and he doesn’t wear a baseball cap or sunglasses. This new player is Cepheus, a computer program developed by Carnegie Mellon University School of Computer Science alumnus Michael Bowling. According to a paper published in the Jan. 9 issue of Science, Cepheus has essentially solved heads-up limit Texas hold’em.
This version of poker is a two-player game in which all bets are a fixed size, creating a game which is made up of approximately 1014 decision points — unique possible positions a player can find himself in where he is forced to make an action — as opposed to the 10161 decision points more complicated versions of the game entail. “It’s the smallest game that humans play in poker,” Bowling explained. “But it’s also the first imperfect information game [competitively played by humans] to be solved.”
Imperfect information games, as the name suggests, are those in which the entire state of the game is not known to a player when he makes a decision. While large games such as checkers have already been solved, the perfect information nature of checkers makes it much easier to solve than games like poker.
In order to solve heads-up limit Texas hold’em, Bowling’s group started Cepheus off by having it play against itself randomly. After each play, it computed how much money it could have made if it had played differently; in other words, it calculated its “regret” at each decision point and then updated its strategy accordingly, getting smarter and smarter with each cycle. This method is called counterfactual regret minimization. “If you do that strategy update in a particular mathematical way, you can prove that its regret has to go to zero over time…and that means its strategy is approaching a perfect strategy,” Bowling said.
Bowling’s group ran Cepheus for two months, during which time they had 48 hundred central processing units (CPUs) working on the strategy, with each CPU processing about 6 billion poker hands every second. By the end of this time, the strategy was statistically indistinguishable from a perfect strategy.
So what can we do with an undefeatable poker genius? Tuomas Sandholm, professor of computer science at Carnegie Mellon University and a member of Bowling’s Ph.D. committee while he was a graduate student, explained that poker is not just a game. “Poker is a benchmark… which we can use to measure progress in the field of solving imperfect information games. And the real applications that we’re targeting are things like security applications, cybersecurity, auctions, negotiations, medical applications, and so forth.” In fact, the Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence (AAAI) has been holding annual poker competitions since 2006, where researchers from around the world compete with each other in various forms of poker and discuss their algorithms.
In the field of cybersecurity, Sandholm explained how imperfect information algorithms can be useful in wireless jamming, when a communicator needs to decide when to communicate and with what power level, and a jammer needs to decide when to jam and with what power level. He and his collaborators have published on this topic.
These algorithms also have various different medical applications. “One is on the population level,” Sandholm said. “So think about a pandemic coming through and you have to decide what segments of the population, defined by geography or some other aspect of the people, you should vaccinate or quarantine, and when to do it.”
This type of strategy can also be used for sequential treatment plans, such as for patients of HIV.
A third medical application is in drug design. “A problem in drug design is that the disease that the drug is intended to battle will also adapt to develop a resistance to the drug. So here the idea is that we can have models of the disease response and then we can actually bundle into the drug something that will already hit the evolved version,” Sandholm said.
There is still a lot of progress to be made in the field of imperfect information games, such as developing artificial intelligence that can efficiently play poker with more than just two players or with no-limit bets. 
While it will be very difficult to completely solve poker, computer scientists are getting closer to solving other versions of the game. “I think we’re not far off,” Bowling said. “I think as a community we’re a few years away from being able to exceed the best in the world at heads-up no limit Texas hold’em.”
Sandholm and his students currently have the best program for this harder form of poker and won the Annual Computer Poker Competition in 2014.

In December, three members of Carnegie Mellon’s faculty, Alex Waibel and Howie Choset of the School of Computer Science, and Diana Marculescu of the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, were named 2015 Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) Fellows.
The IEEE is the largest professional association for the advancement of technology. Its core purpose, according to the association’s website, is to “foster technological innovation and excellence for the benefit of humanity.” The IEEE Fellow is a distinction reserved for those with extraordinary accomplishments in technological fields, and is confirmed by the IEEE Board of Directors.
Marculescu, professor and associate department head for academic affairs in the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, was cited as a Fellow for her contributions to the design and optimization of energy-aware computing systems.
“Being recognized as an IEEE Fellow is a wonderful confirmation of the contributions that my research brought to the field of energy aware and sustainable computing. It truly feels great to be ‘part of the club,’ the most selective group of scientists and engineers in the electrical and electronics engineering domain,” Marculescu said.
Marculescu’s research regarding energy-aware computing and computer-aided design for non-silicon applications aims to achieve sustainable computing, and the use of that computing to achieve sustainability in renewable energy and distribution. 
Her current project, funded by the National Science Foundation, is the implementation of an energy-aware computing system to explore the use of a ray approach for hydropower. They hope to have results in the next three to five years.
Marculescu is also an ACM Distinguished Scientist, the recipient of a National Science Foundation Faculty Career Award (2000), and the Carnegie Institute of Technology George Tallman Ladd Research Award (2004). Recently, she was selected as an Executive Leadership in Academic Technology and Education (ELATE) Fellow (2013–14), received an Australian Research Council Future Fellowship (2013-17), and was awarded the ACM/IEEE Design Automation Marie Pistilli Award (2014).
Choset, a professor in the Robotics Institute, was cited as a Fellow for his contributions to the design and control of highly articulated robots.
Regarding this recognition, Choset noted the contributions of his students. “I am incredibly grateful for all of the hard work and insight my students have put into making snake robots in my lab,” Choset said. “These robots are able to thread through tightly packed spaces to access locations that people cannot. The challenges to build these robots draw from many disciplines, and without the multi-disciplinary and hard-working nature of the Carnegie Mellon students, we would never have successfully built these robots and then deployed them for applications including search and rescue, archeology, and minimally invasive surgery.”
Choset directs the Biorobotics Laboratory, and specializes in snake-like robots that can easily maneuver through rubble and pipes of an archaeological site or a power plant. 
Choset co-authored a number of papers this past year, including one that examined the movements of actual sidewinder snakes in order to determine how his robotic snakes could move uphill.
In 2002, the MIT Technology Review elected Choset as one of its top 100 innovators in the world under 35. In 2005, Choset was the lead author of a textbook published by MIT Press titled “Principles of Robot Motion.” Recently, Choset co-founded the company Medrobotics, which markets a surgical device with a snake-like design in Europe.
Waibel, professor of computer science at Carnegie Mellon and the University of Karlsruhe in Germany, and associate director of the Language Technologies Institute at Carnegie Mellon, was cited as a Fellow for his contributions to neural network-based speech recognition and translation, and his work with multimodal interfaces.
Waibel directs the international center for Advanced Communication Technologies (interACT), a multi-university lab that develops software for speech-to-speech and human-machine translation.
Waibel was one of the founders of C-STAR, the international consortium for speech translation research, and served as its chairman from 1998 to 2000. He was awarded the Alcatel SEL Research Prize for Technical Communication in 1994, the Allen Newell Award for Research Excellence from Carnegie Mellon in 2002, and the Speech Communication Best Paper Award in 2002 for his contributions to multilingual and speech translation systems.
Marculescu, Choset, and Waibel, by being named 2015 IEEE Fellows, have joined over 400,000 other IEEE members in 160 countries that help make the IEEE a leading authority in a wide variety of technological fields.

In the wake of the Charlie Hebdo executions in Paris, David Cameron, Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, announced his intent to criminalize encrypted messages sent over the Internet that could not be broken by the government. Cameron’s solution seems drastic to many internet users, but he sees it as an act of terrorism prevention. Cameron’s actions prompted Pugwash members to question their views on freedom of speech and the complicated balance between privacy and protection.
First, Pugwash discussed the importance of free speech. Freedom of speech allows people to express their opinions without being persecuted for their beliefs. It forces government, companies, and other groups of people to reflect on their actions. Pugwash concluded that even though freedom of speech is harmful to certain people, the benefits of people voicing their opinion are far more important.
Each government is responsible for maintaining the balance between invading privacy and and protecting its citizens. Most people in Pugwash felt like there should be some way to communicate privately without someone watching. If we allow the government access to every medium of communication, then we have given them absolute power over what we say. Others argued that the prevention of terrorist attacks is worth giving up our privacy. Are we willing to let people, like the journalists of Charlie Hebdo, die just so we can express our thoughts in private?
Next, we explored how reading encrypted emails and messages compares to surveillance in other forms of communication. Where do we draw the line about what we allow government to hear? One member compared having access to all online communication as being able to hear every conversation we have with one another. Another suggested that it was almost as bad as reading one’s mind. The government already has access to phones through wire tap and can access written documents using a warrant. We must decide how much free reign we are going to give the government over our thoughts, comments and communications.
Pugwash offered some solutions for compromise between privacy and protection. One person suggested a third party, like a telecommunication company, that would be able to access our encrypted emails. The government would then have to apply for a warrant to gain access to the information and could not simply immediately take it. It was also suggested that Cameron may be fixated on the wrong issue. Instead of limiting free speech, the government should be focused on protecting free speech, which could be more directly done by protecting controversial journalists and peaceful protesters.
Overall, we agreed that David Cameron’s actions against encrypted online messages are a little extreme. However, the Charlie Hebdo incident has brought to light flaws in our treatment of free speech. The next step is to find a way to protect law-abiding citizens without oppressing them.
Student Pugwash is a non-advocacy, educational organization that discusses the implications of science. This article summarizes their discussion on free speech.

Everything, in just one theory?
Four kinds of forces have dominated this universe since its birth 1.4 billion years ago. Gravitational force, which causes an apple to fall; electromagnetic (EM) force, which manifests as EM fields and light; and strong and weak nuclear forces, which are responsible for the atoms that make up all the elements we know. The combination of these forces, as a result, is the sole source of energy for this universe. From a photon knocking a metal sheet to a massive black hole collapsing time space, everything is formed, moved, and changed.
But is there a theory, or an equation — probably no longer than your finger — that incorporates the answer to everything? A mystery for thousands of years, this perplexing but tempting problem has inspired innumerable physicists to contribute their brilliant ideas.
The Theory of Everything (TOE), also named the ultimate theory, is a long-sought hypothetical method that strives to link together all that we know and observe about this universe. While this may seem to be a crazy idea, it has been a long process of exploration which originates even back to Democritus’ time. Our ancestors initially tried to come up with the notion of “atoms,” but not those in Dalton’s version. People like Democritus believed everything was due to the mechanical collision between these microscopic “atoms,” which they never found. But now we know, thanks to Sir Isaac Newton, no contact is even needed given the law of universal gravitation.
In modern age, two famous theories have been closer to a TOE than ever: General Relativity (GR) and Quantum Field Theory (QFT). Albert Einstein, who initially coined the term “unified field theory” (another name for TOE), made every effort trying to prove that electromagnetic field and gravity are nothing but two different manifestations of a more fundamental field. 
General Relativity gives people a brand new geometric way to envisage gravity. For instance, imagine placing a 20-kg lead ball on a soft mattress, which is then deformed because of the heavy weight of the lead ball. This is exactly what happened in time space (mattress), with the presence of colossal celestial objects (lead ball). A remarkable theory, GR explains nature and in fact all its phenomena in a macroscopic level. 
However, the puzzle gets more interesting as Planck’s Quantum Theory enters, which perfectly resolves all the phenomenon taking place in microscopic particle-level physics.
Most of the people today who have taken physics courses, even just at the introductory level, have been taught to bow down to these two great pillars of modern physics. For anything that we can possibly imagine, and for probably every “how things work” question, one of relativity and quantum theory must be behind the scenes. Unfortunately, GR and QFT have been proven to be incompatible with each other. How to reconcile them in a better way and whether we will be forced to discard one and prefer another is not yet known.
There have also been other creative and promising theories.
First, String Theory describes a world in which point-like particles are really one-dimensional objects called “strings.” These strings are believed by some scientists to oscillate and dance in a way that gives particles important properties such as mass and charge.
Second, Casual Sets does not aim to be TOE directly, but its importance to QFT and the standard model of particle physics is considered to be a key for TOE. Its major principle is that space-time is not as continuous as we have imagined.
Meanwhile, there are also great mathematicians and physicists who do not support the existence of TOE at all. They cushion this reasonable criticism with strong arguments. For example, no physics theory is believed to be completely accurate. Instead, theories have been developed as models of certain natural behaviors that can always be improved upon and adjusted (consider Newton’s law and relativity). 
Furthermore, Godel’s famous First Incompleteness Theorem states that an axiomatic system cannot be both consistent and complete.
Without a doubt, if TOE really exists, it will fail this test — its consistency guarantees that the “theory of everything” is at best a “theory of something.” It will not be compatible with Godel’s theorem because TOE will be both complete and consistent. Stephen Hawking is one supporter of this criticism.
The answer has, therefore, always been unknown. Despite devoting mountains of effort, still nobody can give a clear answer regarding the existence of TOE. What makes the search for TOE meaningful is more than just the fame it would bring. This thirst for TOE originates not only from a quest for a higher level of science, but also how human beings want to find a universal pattern governing our lives.
Who controls the four fundamental forces? What makes up the mind of God or the creator of everything? The key is in our hands.

High speed cameras capture the scent of rain
Scientists at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology believe that they have discovered the process that leads to the earthy smell during a rainfall. Using high-speed cameras, the researchers were able to study the mechanism of raindrops as they land on a variety of surfaces, including soil. 
Imaging technology revealed that a droplet flattens after it lands on a surface. Simultaneously, small bubbles emerge from the droplet, which causes the dispersal of hundreds of aerosol droplets. In turn, surface materials present in the rain droplet become distributed within the surrounding environment, which may provide the aromatic elements of fallen rain. 
The study, which was published in Nature Communications, may explain how certain ground microbes and chemicals may have come into contact with humans.

NASA explores the dwarf planets Ceres and Pluto
The study of dwarf planets may hold well-preserved clues in learning about the formation of the solar system. During the coming March, the Dawn spacecraft will go into orbit around the dwarf planet Ceres, located in the main asteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter. The spacecraft will also briefly visit Pluto.
A construction of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, the Dawn spacecraft is expected to be near enough to Ceres to produce images of the tiny dwarf planet, which is about a third of the size of Earth’s moon. Discovered in 1801, Ceres is distinguished for containing an unusually large amount of water, which is not found in any of its neighbors. Scientists also suspect that Ceres and former planet, Pluto — now separated by billions of miles — used to both exist in the icy Kuiper Belt, where Pluto is currently located.

New technique to contain genetically modified organisms
Two groups of scientists from U.S. research universities have developed a complex method to ensure the prevention of potential disease and ecological destruction caused by the escape of genetically modified organisms. 
The researchers modified the DNA of E. coli, a species of bacteria, by replacing an amino acid that halts protein construction with a synthetic amino acid. By interfering with the building blocks of DNA, researchers were able to cause the bacteria to depend on the synthetic amino acid for survival, even in the event that the bacterial DNA develops a single mutation. 
Despite doubts about the need for new methods to contain these particular genetically manipulated cells, the technique promises many benefits, including defense against problematic viruses that ruin the production of goods made with bacteria.

Invertebrates found living deep beneath Antarctic Ice
Earlier this month, researchers from Whillans Ice Stream Subglacial Access Research Drilling (WISSARD) used a hot water drill to cut through half a mile of ice in west Antarctica. With submersible cameras, the National Science Foundation-sponsored team uncovered fish and other invertebrates inhabiting the dark depths of the Ross Sea, which has a temperature of negative two degrees Celsius. 
This is the first time marine life has been found this close to the South Pole. It is also the first time the “grounding zone” — the intersection of Antarctic ice, land and sea — has been reached and sampled. Researchers can learn more about the ice sheets and their possible effects on sea rise by examining sediment from the zone. In addition, researchers hope to learn how the discovered sea creatures can survive in such an environment.

Psychologists suggest that seeing is not remembering
Two psychologists at Penn State University found that memories must be consciously activated in order for someone to remember even the basic details of an experience. 
In a study of 100 undergraduate students, volunteers viewed a simple arrangement of elements, which included numbers, letters, or colors. They were then asked to recall the location of a particular element. While the participants successfully performed the first task several times, they failed when they were given a surprise question, which required identification of the particular element that was previously located. 
Known as “attribute amnesia,” the phenomenon occurs when a person uses a piece of information to execute a task, but then forgets what that information was at least a second later. The phenomenon suggests the selective nature of the human memory.

Swiss pilots plan to launch solar-powered plane
Plans for the launch of the solar-powered plane, Solar Impulse 2, have recently been released to the public. By early March, Swiss pilots plan to fly the Solar Impulse 2 around the globe, leaving from Abu Dhabi and crossing the Pacific Ocean as well as the United States. At night, energy efficient batteries and motors will help keep the plane powered. While it is the size of a Boeing 747, the Solar Impulse 2 will only weigh as much as a family car, as it is composed of lightweight carbon fibers. The cockpit contains thin and highly effective insulation foam which has already been adapted in household kitchens. Members of the ambitious project hope to promote the usage of solar energy through live broadcasts throughout the flight, as well as through talks to schools, politicians and the media.

The Academy announced this year’s nominees on Jan. 15, instantly provoking a slew of criticism. Some of it was the usual complaints about snubs — I, personally, think that The Lego Movie deserved a nomination for Best Animated Feature Film — but most focused on the fact that the nominees are dramatically whitewashed.
All of the nominees for Best Actor are white, including Bradley Cooper (American Sniper), Steve Carrell (Foxcatcher), Benedict Cumberbatch (The Imitation Game), Michael Keaton (Birdman), and Eddie Redmayne (The Theory of Everything). All of the nominated directors, with the exception of Birdman’s Alejandro G. Iñárritu, who is a native Mexican, are white males, leaving out Angelina Jolie (Unbroken) and Ava DuVernay (Selma), who would’ve made history as the first African-American woman nominated for Directing. A year after 12 Years a Slave won Best Picture and right after Selma, a movie about Martin Luther King, Jr., was released, it’s disheartening to see such a lack of diversity.
While I can’t write about every movie, here, in order, are my top three picks for Best Picture:
Boyhood
Boyhood was notable right off the bat for its unique filming technique: director Richard Linklater, instead of using different actors for the same character at different ages, filmed Boyhood over the course of 12 years, following the life of Mason (Ellar Coltrane) from age 5 to 18. Boyhood was rightfully nominated for Directing, as well as Film Editing (Sandra Adair), Original Screenplay (Richard Linklater), Best Supporting Actor (Ethan Hawke), and Best Supporting Actress (Patricia Arquette). Although the film’s star, Coltrane, wasn’t nominated for Best Actor, Arquette’s and Hawke’s nominations were well-deserved. Arquette played Mason’s mother, tough and loving through a string of broken, alcohol-soaked marriages. Boyhood’s long-term filming is more than a gimmick — the movie is real in a way that movies rarely are.
The Imitation Game
The Imitation Game is about Alan Turing (Benedict Cumberbatch), a closeted genius who cracks the Germans’ enigma code during World War II and helps turn the tide in favor of the Allies. The film secured an impressive list of nominations, including those for Directing (Morten Tyldum), Best Actor (Benedict Cumberbatch), Best Supporting Actress (Keira Knightley), Film Editing (William Goldenberg), Original Score (Alexandre Desplat), Adapted Screenplay (Graham Moore) and Production Design (Maria Djurkovic and Tatiana Macdonald). Although doubtlessly some of the history is smudged — would we expect any less of Hollywood? — The Imitation Game tells an important and emotional story, carrying the weight of Turing’s chemical castration and subsequent suicide when his homosexuality was discovered after the war. Benedict Cumberbatch was a good choice for Turing; he’s used to playing the aloof genius after his role in BBC’s Sherlock. In The Imitation Game Cumberbatch is more human than ever, although the film’s Oscar-bait central quote (“Sometimes it is the people who no one imagines anything of who do the things that no one can imagine”) felt a little heavy-handed.
Birdman or (The Unexpected Virtue of Innocence)
Birdman is just about as meta as it gets. In the movie, Riggan Thompson (Michael Keaton) plays a washed up actor famous for his role as Birdman (Keaton himself played Batman in 1989). Thompson tries to make himself relevant by writing, directing, and starring in a Broadway play based on Raymond Carver’s What We Talk About When We Talk about Love, fighting against an egocentric lead actor (Edward Norton), his daughter (Emma Stone), and his own mind. Birdman is one long camera shot, earning it a nomination for Cinematography (Emmanuel Lubezki), which it will surely win. Birdman was also nominated for Best Actor (Michael Keaton), Best Supporting Actor (Edward Norton), Best Supporting Actress (Emma Stone), Best Director (Alejandro G. Iñárritu), Best Sound Editing (Martin Hernández and Aaron Glascock), Best Sound Mixing (Jon Taylor, Frank A. Montaño and Thomas Varga), and Best Original Screenplay (Alejandro G. Iñárritu, Nicolás Giacobone, Alexander Dinelaris, Jr. & Armando Bo). Birdman offers a sobering commentary on show business and Hollywood alike, highlighted by Keaton and Stone’s standout performances.

“Like my grandmothers, I refuse to be the ink that gives the white page a meaning,” wrote Allderdice High School senior Amma Ababio.
On the other side of the racial divide, “I sob because I can’t let the world treat everyone / as it will treat me,” wrote Pittsburgh Creative and Performing Arts School student Isaac Monroe in his second-place poem, “I Have it Hard (That’s a Lie).”
Creative writing senior Michael Mingo described clandestine racism in a homogeneous town in first-place poem “Rural Vandalism.” In her second-place poem “To Lebanon,” junior psychology and French double major Siriana Abboud reflected on the memory of her native country: “You, my land, have raised me.” In his third-place poem, first-year creative and technical writing double major Joshua Brown wrangled with a different brand of difference and discrimination, writing, “When I was born, I came out swinging, / Prepared to beat back the savage stinging / Of this world’s brutal preoccupation / With my private passions.”
On Martin Luther King, Jr. Day, students, faculty, families, and community members convened in Rangos Ballroom for the Martin Luther King, Jr. Day Writing Awards, an annual event launched by Thomas Stockham Baker University Professor of English Jim Daniels in 1999, which encourages both local college and high school students to write about their experiences of racial discrimination or difference in memory of Dr. King, according to the call for submissions. First, second, and third place awards were given in four categories: college prose, high school prose, college poetry, and high school poetry.
Not only written word was featured at the ceremony: The event launched with powerful musical performances by students in the School of Drama, whose vocal talent, it seems, we so rarely get to hear. Their performances ranged from spirited to somber, from a pounding rendition of black spiritual anthem “Down by the Riverside” to a sobering spoken word poem that held the audience rapt: “This feels a lot like Selma,” the poem lamented about recent events in Ferguson and New York. “2015 feels like 1965.”
Following the performances, the winners commenced reading from their work, moving from college poetry to college prose categories. In third-place “Fair and Lovely,” junior psychology and creative writing double major Michelle Mathew spoke about discrimination against darker skin in her native India. In second-place “On Language,” first-year undeclared Dietrich College student Ellie Liu described losing her native Mandarin and watching her mother’s “attempts at accent-eradication.”
Junior chemistry and creative writing double major Sophie Zucker took to the podium last to read from her first place-winning essay, “The Washing.” Her hook, a description of a chemically extreme hair-straightening process called the Blowout — of which her mother is a devotee — seems, at surface level, unrelated to issues of race. The connection is subtle but significant, and becomes more overt as the piece goes on.
“It’s about how hair is racialized,” Zucker said in an interview. “Straight hair is seen as professional and socially acceptable; curly hair is seen as deviant.” Because it’s associated with people of color, curly hair is construed as exotic and low class — prompting many black women to straighten, weave, or otherwise alter their hair, from a “desire to emulate whiteness.”
Zucker said she started researching the natural hair movement in earnest during her senior year of high school, when one of her friends decided to go natural — and when Zucker herself was “trying to write about my identity in a more nuanced way.” While simultaneously learning about antisemitism and modern-day Judaism, Zucker watched Chris Rock’s documentary Good Hair  and read Malcolm X’s autobiographical descriptions of hair straightening in the African American community.
“ ‘We’re all just trying to look whiter,’ ” Zucker quoted her mother in her essay. “...‘Why do you think black women get weaves? Why do you think I straighten my hair? It’s not because it’s cheap or easy.’ ”
With the most emotionally resonant piece appropriately saved for last, first-place high school prose winner Ababio took the stage. Though her voice was firm, Ababio apologized in advance for her emotional delivery, and told the audience about her incredible struggle being thrust into American racial beauty standards as a young Ghanaian immigrant.
Ababio choked and came to tears while reading from her work. “I was disgusted by the coarseness of my hair, the hand-me-down clothes I wore, and especially the color of my skin,” wrote Ababio, who resorted to harsh skin lightening formula and baby powder in an attempt to whiten her skin. At this point in the reading, Ababio paused in earnest distress.
“It’s okay, baby,” a woman called from the audience.
As Ababio left the podium to the loudest applause yet, Daniels took the mic to propose they end the night in song. A single School of Drama student came to the stage to sing from the black national anthem, a ringing rendition of “Lift Every Voice and Sing.” It was slowed and powerful for its lack of instrumental company, and after the last belted note hit the ceiling, a few moments passed before anyone spoke.

Tired of repeating the same outfits? It’s about that time of year again when you feel as if you’ve been wearing the same sweater every day with the same pair of black leggings, and this can get boring quickly. Though it might be the most comfortable option, there are other clothing items you can try out that are comfortable, but still unique and stylish. Here are a couple of fashion trends for the winter to help you through the season. 
One style I’ve been seeing in stores and on campus — and this is quite unexpected, since it's generally considered unflattering — is the turtleneck or cowl-neck sweater. These types of sweaters are not commonly worn by people our age, but as of late they’ve grown in popularity. The turtleneck sweaters that have appeared in clothing stores are different from tighter, less appealing sweaters. These are instead larger and chunkier, and could make for an interesting look with some leggings and boots. They are also mostly available in neutral colors and earthy tones, which are flattering to most people. Not to mention, these sweaters will definitely allow you to be simultaneously stylish and comfortable.
Speaking of comfort, this season seems to be centered on that theme, with soft pullovers styled like sweatshirts. These tops look like basic sweatshirts, making them slightly more difficult to style since people wearing them run the risk of looking as though they are not put together. However, I think these look can nice with a pair of dark blue jeans and short black boots. Since these sweatshirts tend to be available only in dull colors, I would throw a scarf in a jewel tone or with an interesting pattern on top.
A style that I’ve been seeing in stores often is the cutout-shoulder look, which is exactly what it sounds like. Although this style has existed for quite a while now, it seems to have become even more popular lately. From sweaters to nice blouses, to even dresses, the cutout-shoulder look appears in several clothing items. This, like the turtleneck or cowl-neck sweater, is another way to take a simple outfit and make it unique. Instead of wearing the same plain old sweater that everyone else has in some type of variation, give the cutout-shoulder sweater a try in order to make a statement. These will look good with anything — jeans or leggings — depending on the length. In order to make the outfit look more feminine, I would put on a necklace to complete the look.
Stripes have seemingly been very trendy for the winter, as I’ve been seeing a lot of striped shirts and sweaters in stores. While this pattern never really goes out of style, I’ve been seeing it a lot more often than I’m used to. What makes the stripe pattern so great is that it’s so versatile, but it still makes you look as if you put some effort into your outfit. Due to their versatility, I don’t have much advice on how to style stripes, since they can usually be worn with anything. I do, however, recommend that if you’re going to be wearing stripes, don't wear the striped item of clothing with any other pattern, since mixing patterns doesn’t go well for anyone. 
A trend that I’m still unsure about, though I’ve still been seeing it everywhere, is the cropped shirt style. I was used to seeing crop tops being worn over the summer, but something new to me was seeing cropped sweaters in stores. The idea of a cropped sweater seems unexpected, since cropping a sweater seems to defeat the purpose of a sweater. However, I think that pairing the cropped sweater with either high-waisted jeans or a high-waisted circle skirt and tights could make for a nice outfit. So if you think you’ve exhausted all your clothing options and are tired of the pieces in your closet, remember that just one of these statement pieces can create a new look for winter.

The production was a ridiculous and enjoyable tale of trickery.
This past weekend, students from the School of Music put on a sparkling and hysterical performance of Joseph Haydn’s opera Il mondo della luna. The libretto of the classical opera was written by Carlo Goldoni. The production, which featured the vocal and dramatic talents of Carnegie Mellon vocal performance students, was a ridiculous and enjoyable tale of trickery led by the character of Ecclitico, an astronomer played by master’s student in vocal performance Ricky Marenda. The show had two casts, with each cast performing on alternating days. I attended Friday night’s performance and was hugely impressed by all that I saw.
The curtains opened on a dazzling set with golden pillars made up of stacked astronomical signs and a twinkling backdrop of stars. The men’s chorus — consisting of Ecclitico’s students — joined their teacher in singing a song to the moon. Ecclitico told his students that he could easily convince Signor Buonafede, the father of the girl he loves, that there are people alive on the moon. Sure enough, Buonafede, played by senior vocal performance major Kevin O’Hora, gazes through Ecclitico’s telescope and witnesses what he thinks are people on the moon. In fact, Ecclitico’s students had been acting out a variety of bizarre scenes, including a woman getting dragged away by the nose, behind a screen. Buonafede is convinced, however, and sings a beautiful aria about how perfect life seems on the moon.
Ecclitico, decked out in vibrant astronomer garb, then sang an aria in which he planned to use Ernesto’s money to fund a plan to trick the Signor into letting his two daughters and maidservant marry. Ernesto was gracefully portrayed by master’s student in music Courtney Elvira. Ecclitico loves Clarice, Ernesto loves Flaminia, and Ernesto’s servant, Cecco, played by junior vocal performance major Camilo Estrada, is in love with the maidservant Lisetta. The women were charmingly played by junior vocal performance majors Samantha Kronenfeld, Rachel Doehring, and Shannyn Rinker, respectively. Later in their home, Signor Buonafede’s beautiful daughters sing a duet about how strict their father is. They resolve that though they will still have to answer to a man when married, marriage is preferable to the way they live presently. Doehring weighs the options in a humorous and drawn out way as Kronenfeld joins her in their duet. Ecclitico drugs Signor and, in a particularly wonderfully staged scene, has his students lift the Signor’s chair to convince him that he is flying to the moon. Signor Buonafede and Ecclitico sing a beautiful duet contrasting their desires.
The second act opened with a moon-like set. The men’s chorus, now dressed in bizarre costumes — one of the men was dressed as a pair of pants, another was on roller blades and looked like a shrub — pretended to be people of the moon. Stars were suspended from the ceiling as Signor Buonafede took in the majesty of the moon through song. Throughout the second act, Ecclitico, with the help of Cecco and Ernesto, tricked Signor Buonafede to let his daughters marry each man in turn. Cecco, playing the part of the emperor of the moon, rode in on a large golden duck chariot set-piece. Signor Buonafede’s 
hysterical realization that he had been duped included him running around the stage and picking up fake stars with a surprised expression.
Each actor displayed impressive vocal power and precision as well as comic timing, often turning to the audience to deliver a sidelong glance or a salty line. The set, designed by master’s student in scenic design Caitlin Ayer with assistance from junior design major Nathan Brown, not only fit each scene of the show but allowed for funny interactions with the cast, including a cloud that doubled as a scooter, on which Signor Buonafede was pulled around a couple times.
The costumes, particularly during the second act, showed a huge amount of creativity on the part of master’s in costume design student Eunjin Lee. Ernesto’s costume on the moon even had stuffed animals on it, which various characters occasionally pet.
The show closed back on Earth with a celebration. The wonderful accompaniment by School of Music students in the pit orchestra under the direction of guest music director Christopher Larkin made the opera sound incredibly refined and put together. With beautiful sets and costumes and the indisputable vocal talent displayed by the cast, Haydn’s wonderful comic opera was given light and life that won’t soon be forgotten.

I told myself last week that, no matter what, I would not write a review of Fall Out Boy's new album American Beauty/American Psycho when it dropped on Tuesday. I was too biased, I told myself. 
"Grand Theft Autumn/Where Is Your Boy," from 2003's Take This to Your Grave — "Where is your boy tonight?/I hope he is a gentleman" — was the first song I ever completely memorized in seventh grade. And "Dance, Dance," from 2005's From Under the Cork Tree, played on repeat on my iPod Mini for at least a month. I still listen to it on repeat.
Needless to say, I'm a shameless Fall Out Boy fanboy, and I couldn't resist this review. I never thought I'd like anything the band put out recently as much as what I deem their original music — everything before their hiatus a few years ago. That was true for their 2013 comeback album, Save Rock and Roll, which I enjoyed, but it didn't beat the old stuff.
But American Beauty/American Psycho surprised me, because I like almost every song on it more than I like "Grand Theft Autumn" and "Dance, Dance."
While the album isn't likely to convert you if you didn't like "Sugar, We're Going Down" or the more recent "My Songs Know What You Did in the Dark (Light Em Up)," the work on this album is easily Fall Out Boy's best. It's diverse, gritty, and out of all the mainstream music I listen to, there's a number of sounds I've never heard on a track before, and many samples that I have that are used to great effect.
The album opens with one of my favorites — but let's be real, they're all my favorites — "Irresistible," which sets the tone of the album for something grand, with horns welcoming Patrick Stump's wide range of vocals and ability to elongate the words "It's irresistible" into a 13-second catchy phrase of an even catchier chorus.
The band then immediately throws itself into "American Beauty/American Psycho" which, when paired with "Novocaine," give the album its gritty quality. These songs are raw, with Stump reaching the lowest of his vocal range before jumping to the highest and then being drowned out by tangles of instrumental noise that are somehow some of the greatest noises that have ever graced my ears. You might think the band crazy after they passively threaten you with the lines "If you knew what the blue birds sang at you/you would never sing along" in "Novocaine" and a complete admission that they're American psychos in the song of a similar title. But that's what makes those songs so much fun.
And, of course, we can't forget the star of the album, "Immortals," which was straight-up made for Disney's Big Hero 6 (shout out to Carnegie Mellon for inspiring Baymax!), but is so catchy that I've included it on every playlist I've created since it was released as a single way back last year. Seriously, just listen to it. Even better is the way that "Favorite Record," which is ordered directly before "Immortals" on the album, transitions seamlessly into the Big Hero 6 song. Played separately from the rest of the album, "Immortals" starts off with the final held note of "Favorite Record." Played in the order they were meant to be played, it seems as if the two songs were produced with each other in mind, the first slow and reminiscent while the second complements the first with an upbeat head-bobbing beat. While "Favorite Record" isn't my favorite on the album, I always listen to it before "Immortals" just so I can hear that perfect transition.
Possibly my favorite song on the album though is one of the less popular (based on iTunes popularity ratings): "Fourth of July." The chorus goes something like this: "It was the Fourth of July/You and I were/You and I were fire-fireworks." Simple, right? It's so simple, and so catchy that when Stump belts it at the top of his lungs, you won't be able to do anything else but belt it out with him.
And no review of this album would be complete without mentioning the effective sampling in "Uma Thurman," "Centuries," and "American Beauty/American Psycho." "Uma Thurman" samples 1960s sitcom The Munsters theme song, "Centuries" samples Suzanne Vega's "Tom's Diner," and "American Beauty/American Psycho" samples Motley Crüe's "Too Fast for Love." Okay, admittedly that's a lot of sampling for one album. But it all works so well that it doesn't matter, especially in "Centuries," because who else remembers not being able to get "Tom's Diner" out of their head after they first heard it? Same applies to "Centuries."
Of course, this album is still the old Fall Out Boy from before the hiatus, to an extent, meaning that it is angsty and in your face. There's not much that's mellow about, so if you're looking for a quiet, summer album, look somewhere else. It's a little bit beautiful, definitely psycho. And that's what makes it some of Fall Out Boy's best music.

“If you ever get lonely, just go to the record store and visit your friends” — a line from the film Almost Famous, which is a movie you should start watching right now if you haven’t seen it. It’s a quote I’ve always counted as one of my favorite unique arrangements of letters and syllables. A beautifully simple way of speaking a 10-volume opus entitled “Why I Love Music.”
In the first few days of my journey spending a semester abroad in Sheffield, England, I came to see a deeper meaning to it, specifically to the last three words. Seeing as I’m a brand-new student who’s only here for a semester, it’s unlikely I’ll make the kind of friends I have in the U.S. Without them, I’ve come to see that my only connections that come even remotely close to those across the Atlantic are with the friends in my headphones. Now I see that the 10-volume opus should really be titled “Why Music Matters to Me.”
Not to say I’m depressed or regretful — quite the contrary — but anyone who’s gone through culture shock will tell you the first few days are damn difficult. Aside from the obvious homesickness and adjusting to new ways of eating and (in the U.K.) crossing the street, there is the challenge of breaking into an established social scene. It feels like I’m back in freshman year, but instead of being surrounded by countless other freshmen who are experiencing the same bewilderment and are as eager to form new relationships as I am, I’m surrounded by upperclassmen, many of whom are about to graduate. They have their friends and their routines that they’ve cultivated the same way I have mine in Pittsburgh, and they go about these routines normally.
The only thing is that I didn’t yet have a routine — there’s hardly been any schoolwork yet, and there’s only so much time you can spend on Netflix before you begin to feel like a weird recluse. So to fill much of the afternoon free time I took walks around the city, exploring the nooks and crannies and seeing what happened when I took a left where I last took a right. I spent hours out there, and never once did I feel lonely or bored, because I had a pocketful of friends with me.
Kendrick Lamar told stories while we explored the shopping districts and peered into stores I had never heard of before, and Twiddle jammed for 20 minutes on a cheery tune even though it was drizzling and overcast on our walk to the Sheffield Cathedral. Pretty Lights kept us both grooving along the bars and clubs on West Street while I took note of which ones had strict dress codes so I could avoid them. It was a good thing I kept the volume low, because Eminem likely would’ve gotten us kicked out of KFC. Also, English people love KFC. Images of the Colonel outnumber the Golden Arches by a decent margin.
It’s not only during the day that music has been the only guy there to hang out with me. One of my first nights here, I was invited by my flatmates to go to the nightclubs. After pre-drinks in our kitchen we took a taxi to the club. Then, when we got there, the bouncer wouldn’t let me inside. Something about how I “couldn’t stand up bloody straight.” My flatmates kindly offered to head back with me, but I implored them to go enjoy their night.
Arriving back to an empty flat, I hooked my phone up to the speakers in the kitchen, which before had been blaring a stream of thumping house songs that my untrained ear could hardly distinguish between, and turned “Maggie May” by Rod Stewart up to full volume. Waltzing around, belting out the lyrics and strumming my invisible mandolin in perfect time, I felt like I was at the most perfect birthday party that anyone could ever have thrown me. I went back and hit the replay button three more times.
Okay, perhaps I was pretty drunk.
I’ve taken a lot away from my first week dropped in the middle of a strange sea, but a newfound appreciation for pieces of art I’d already deeply loved is certainly the most surprising. Songs that had meant little more than a lovely melody now mean home, and conjure memories of friends that I love and miss dearly.
There’s a long way to go, and I’ve seen enough PowerPoint slides and been handed enough advice to know these feelings of homesickness and isolation will pass. However, I also know that I’ll never forget how good these songs made me feel at a time when I really needed it. So far this whole “abroad” thing seems to be leaving a pretty great mark on me.

For my first cupcakes of the semester, I’d like to look back to winter break, but also look forward to Valentine’s Day.
I made these cupcakes for my family’s New Year’s Eve party, and they were so delicious and festive. Champagne is such a classic New Year’s staple, but the addition of the strawberry really made the cupcakes brighter, both in color and flavor. Not to brag, but I think they were the most successful dessert there, even beating out all of the leftover Christmas cookies that everyone brought just to get rid of.
With Valentine’s Day just on the horizon, this is a great flavor to resurrect. Both strawberries and champagne just scream romance! Making these is sure to tell your sweetie how much you love them. So ditch the roses this year; cupcakes taste so much better.
Champagne Cupcakes
Adapted from “Sprinkle Bakes”
1 stick of butter, room temperature
1 cup of sugar
2 eggs
1 teaspoon of vanilla
1 3/4 cups of flour
1/2 teaspoon of baking soda
1/4 teaspoon of baking powder
1/4 teaspoon of salt
1/2 cup of sour cream
1 cup of champagne
Strawberry Champagne Frosting
1 cup of champagne, rosé if available
2 sticks of butter, room temperature
2 1/2 cups of powdered sugar
1/4 cup of chopped strawberries
Instructions
To start, preheat the oven to 350 ºF, and put cupcake liners in 17 of the spots on a cupcake tray. (I thought 17 was a crazy number when I read the recipe, but I actually had enough batter for exactly 17 cupcakes.) Set aside all dry ingredients in a separate bowl for later. This includes the flour, baking powder, baking soda, and salt.
For the batter, start by creaming the butter and sugar until they’re nice and fluffy, a step made much easier with an electric mixer. Then smell it, because it gives off the world’s most heavenly smell. Add the eggs and vanilla, then stir, scraping the bottom of the bowl if it looks like the eggs and butter aren’t mixing. Start bringing it all together by adding about one-third of the dry ingredients, followed by half of the sour cream; alternate adding those amounts to the bowl until all the dry ingredients are mixed in. Finally, gently stir in the champagne. Scoop all the cupcakes and bake for about 17 minutes, or until the cake feels bouncy when you poke it.
The frosting takes much longer than normal buttercream, so start making it as soon as you put the cupcakes in the oven, if not before. Place the champagne and strawberries into a small pot and simmer on medium-high heat until they reduce down to between two and four tablespoons. It will take a while, so be patient! Depending on how small you cut the berries, there still may be some chunks left, so strain those out. Then, start your frosting by beating the butter until it’s creamy. Stir in the powdered sugar a little at a time so that you don’t make a mess, and finally, add the reduced champagne — and that’s it! These look beautiful when frosted with a star tip and finished with some red sprinkles, but most important of all, serve them with love.

Every so often, going on a trip is exactly what you need. Voyaging to a new place opens your eyes to the potential that the world holds and reminds you to embrace adventure once again.
There was a moment over winter break when I was standing at the Western Wall in the Old City of Jerusalem. I was surrounded by people of all ages, religions, and nationalities. We were all together in one moment, and it didn't matter who was praying in what language, or if you were crying tears of joy or sorrow, or if you believed that there was someone receiving the prayer or not. There were differences, but they didn't divide us. They made us stronger.
It was a poignant, dazzling moment, and it was when I realized that my trip to Israel was going to be more than just a vacation.
I was lucky enough to spend ten incredible days in Israel as a part of The David Project's Israel Uncovered trip. The David Project is a young, fresh organization dedicated to taking campus leaders to discover their own Israel. There's no dodging issues or questions. There's no sugarcoating and no bias. It's just straight-up information: tours of historical sights, talks from important people, and time set aside for you to explore by yourself so that you can draw the best, most comprehensive, informed opinion possible.
In the days preceding the trip, I struggled with how to prepare. Friends that had been on the trip previously told me that I was in for the trip of a lifetime. How do you get ready to experience a once-in-a-lifetime experience? Can you? I settled for simply skimming a few Wikipedia articles and Facebook stalking the other thirty students who were going to be on the trip. The more I read, the more I realized that there was no hope for me to learn all of the necessary information in one week's time. I was just going to have to go for it.
The trip itself was the most exhausting ten days I've experienced in my life, and I have never enjoyed anything more. From the moment we woke up in the morning until we finally stumbled to bed at 3 or 4 a.m., we were talking, learning, seeing, doing, experiencing, surprising, eating, drinking, hating, loving. There was so much packed into every hour that it felt like every day was a year and a half. There's no possible way to write about everything that happened or even all of the things we saw and felt: There's simply too much. 
From the modern, pulsing clubs that dot the city of Tel Aviv to the silent snowfall that blanketed the Holy City, every stop along the way was fraught with complexity and significance. There was never a place where I felt nothing. 
When we arrived in Tel Aviv, the sky was overcast and small raindrops were cautiously peppering the sidewalks and cars. I felt like I hadn't even left Pittsburgh, until we started driving through the city to get to our hotel, which was a block away from the Mediterranean Sea. There were no more than a few cars driving around, and everything seemed quiet, as if life was on hold. It was early afternoon on Friday, and Shabbat, the Jewish day of rest, was beginning. We held our own traditional Shabbat service to welcome the Sabbath, as many families do not only in Israel, but across the world. From Friday night to Saturday evening, no work is done. Cars stay silent, businesses close, and the street are silent. But in Tel Aviv, which is generally acknowledged as Jerusalem's hip, younger sibling of a city, Shabbat isn't as strict. Sure, people still stay in and have a family dinner, but then they go out afterwards and celebrate in one of the millions of bars that peppers the streets of the bouncing city. We joined them the first night, fighting jet lag and a language barrier to start the nightlife off strong. 
I ended up at a small bratwurst/beer shop with a few of the students on the trip, sipping our drinks as we watched the city stroll by. The rain had (mostly) cleared by then, so we decided to meander down to the beach to dip our toes into a new ocean. It wasn't until I looked up at the full moon above the crashing waves of the Mediterranean that it hit me: I was in Israel. I was halfway around the world, and I was about to have the adventure of a lifetime. I wasn't quite sure how to process all of that, so I pushed it to the back of my mind and jumped in the ocean. In case you were wondering, jeans do not take salt water well.
The next leg of the trip took us to a kibbutz in Northern Israel on the Sea of Galilee. I was expecting the North to be a lull between Tel Aviv and Jerusalem, but I couldn't have been more wrong. Walking out into the beautiful mountains was like taking a trip to Narnia. Everything was green and lush and beautifully ancient. We saw temples that have been around for longer than most modern civilizations. We saw abandoned mine fields that overlooked Syria and watched a rainbow peek out from behind the clouds. There were cows laying the middle of the road, and it was as if no other human had ever stepped upon the grass but for the ones who had laid the mines.
It seemed impossible that there wasn't peace in such a beautiful, quiet place. It was chilling to realize that the world was such a scary, fragile place, but then I looked around me at all of the people I was with and everyone I have the privilege of going to school with here at Carnegie Mellon, and I felt safer. 
Next, we ascended into Jerusalem. As we were driving to Jerusalem, I saw little houses that looked just as old as the temples and columns of the Old City. It got me thinking how even though we were visiting all of the historical landmarks that are well known, there are little places around the world that contain so much history and significance that we might not know about today. It was overwhelming to consider how sacred and important nearly every street and house could be. 
The second day that we were there, Jerusalem got nearly four inches of snow, one of the largest snowfalls in recent history there. The next morning was our tour of the historical, holy sights in the city. To see them covered in snow was a breathtaking experience. I thought that the snow would be an inconvenience, but instead I was greeted with the purest beauty I have ever seen. I could barely look away from the gleaming sun reflecting off of the snow to concentrate on internalizing the day's itinerary. It was perfect.
All in all, my trip to Israel was a whirlwind of people, amazing sights, incredible food, and once-in-a-lifetime experiences. It's impossible to sum up in one conversation, let alone one article. I can't point out my favorite thing that we saw or the most powerful experience I had there. I can only say that I wouldn't trade it for the world, and that if you ever have the chance to see the Holy Land in person, to miss it would be a tragedy.

Dear Evan,
I’m in the process of applying for masters of education programs — I want to teach second graders because I don’t feel comfortable conversing with people my own age — and yesterday I got my first acceptance! Not to a very good school, but still. But then I took a day off and watched YouTube videos for most of the day, and I found this one I had watched back when I was a senior, called “Gap Yah.” It’s a stupid, annoying video with some pretentious guy with an unplaced accent talking about how he traveled the world and drank too much and threw up everywhere.
But then I got to thinking: Why can’t I do that? Why can’t I travel the world and make an ass of myself before I go to grad school?
Ponderously,
Longing After Zeitgeist, Yearning Especially for Xenophilic Contingencies and Unregulated Smoking of Esra
Dear LAZY EXCUSE,
I don’t think anyone uses the term “esra” to refer to weed anymore, but good on you for trying to bring it back! Make it your own.
So, this whole gap year thing: It’s splendid idea if you want to spend the money and time required, and I’ve heard it’s a helluva deep spiritual journey. But you really shouldn’t use the “Gap Yah” guy as your point of reference for such an important issue.
He’s not exactly the best role model: Whenever he comes across something remotely life changing or breathtaking, he “just chunders everywhere.” The next thing you know, you’ll be pronouncing Peru as “Perah,” calling global climate change “an insignificant truth,” and getting arrested by Burmese law enforcement for disturbing the peace.
Then again, you could make it your goal to drink every kind of liquor known to man in a year, sleep on a different-smelling couch in a different country every night, and finally discover the difference between potato seasonings in Eastern Europe. And then, you share those experiences with your wide-eyed second-grade students.
Best night of my life, best night of my life,
Evan Kahn

At the beginning of this semester, Carnegie Mellon officially switched the company providing cleaning services for its buildings. Cleaning services had been provided by Integrated Service Solutions, Inc. (ISS) since 1996, and are now being provided under a contract with Philadelphia-based Aramark. Aramark has a janitorial service division that provides cleaning for numerous locations ranging from office buildings to hospitals, in addition to other academic institutions.
Marcia Gerwig, director of the Jared L. Cohon University Center, described the decision process saying that “there was a bidding process and a committee” which included faculty and staff. “There were around six companies which sent proposals, and three gave presentations,” Gerwig continued, saying that the committee “had a lot of input from a lot of folks on campus” and gave a recommendation, but ultimately the final decision rested with Carnegie Mellon’s Facilities Management Services, who formally hold the contract. Gerwig noted that the final decision was not made based on the bid price alone, instead being evaluated on a number of different factors, which she did not specify.
The bidding process started during the summer of 2014 and the transition began in early December, with Aramark officially taking over on Jan. 1. The bidding process took place last year because the university’s contract with ISS was expiring, with ISS re-bidding, but not being re-awarded the contract.
Directing of Housing Services Thomas Cooley explained that the new provider is operating under the name “Custodial Services,” and described that along with this transition the university is striving to meet newer, higher cleaning standards.
“One huge change that housing made is the way that the contract is evaluated,” Cooley explained, noting there would be “quality evaluations periodically throughout the year” by an independent evaluator. Cooley also spoke of a “more detailed process” which has been developed for the university’s residential buildings regarding what items should be cleaned after students leave the building at the end of an academic year.
In terms of staff which had been previously hired under ISS, employees were reinterviewed by Aramark, who, Gerwig reports, had to keep around 60 percent of union personnel. “I think almost all of them stayed. I think there might have been some who were not rehired; some chose not to be rehired. So, for the most part, they stayed.”
One Carnegie Mellon cleaning services worker, who chose to remain anonymous, explained that there was uncertainty regarding this transition process and the status of their employment when this transition was announced. This source also stated that during the interviewing process, workers hired under ISS were put on a 60-day probationary period and were subject to background checks, as well as drug and alcohol screenings. 
Gerwig reported that these checks are a common process used during rehiring scenarios.
Gerwig spoke to the transition, remarking that “it was kind of a rough start in January,” something she attributed to Aramark taking over during a period when there were no students on campus. “Even though the personnel stayed the same, it was hard for the supervisors to visualize what it looks like with students here.”
As to the causes of these difficulties, Gerwig explained that “even though the staff has been here, they were moved around a little bit, and it’s a different supervisor and different equipment,” on which staff need to be retrained.
Cooley estimated that there would be “about 90 days before we transition completely,” because the staff is undergoing training on the new practices and equipment, in addition to providing cleaning services. He summarized the effort by saying that we should expect “cleaning more often and to a higher standard.”
“Aramark has cleaning accounts at other campuses, but we have a very unique environment. It’s been a learning curve,” Gerwig concluded.

The cost of tuition, fees, and room and board is increasing by 3.38 percent for the next academic year, an increase that is more than last year’s 3 percent increase but less than 2013-14’s increase of 4.05 percent. Altogether, next year’s fees will total about $63,240 for undergraduates.
Emailing the campus community on Jan. 14, Vice President for Campus Affairs Michael Murphy said that tuition for incoming undergraduates and students who enrolled in fall 2013 or 2014 will be set at $49,610 for the 2015-16 academic year, while room and board now cost $7,520 for a standard double room and $5,310 for a standard first-year meal plan. Fees factoring into this total increase include a $150 transportation fee, which allows students access to Port Authority of Allegheny County services, and a $390 technology fee, as well as a $250 activity fee and $10 media fee for undergraduate students. The media fee supports the Collegiate Readership Program, which gives students access to The New York Times, Pittsburgh Post-Gazette, and USA Today on campus. Graduate students will be charged a $206 activity fee without a media fee.
For 2014-15, tuition cost incoming students $48,030. The 2015-16 tuition cost marks a 3.29 percent increase from this academic year’s tuition cost. The activity fee cost $246 this year, and next year’s cost is only $4 higher. Meanwhile, the transportation fee rose $30 from this year’s $120 fee. The media fee remained the same.
Room and board rose $240 from $7,280 and the meal plan fee rose $190 from $5,120.
Next year’s tuition increase, as well as the 2014-15 increase, deviated from previous years in that the percentage of the increase was the same for both incoming students and upperclassmen. The 2013-14 academic year’s increase implemented a tiered pricing in which first-year students were hit with a larger increase (3.99 percent) while upperclassmen received a lower 2.99 percent increase. Similarly tiered increases of about 4 percent for first-years and 3 percent for upperclassmen were also implemented for 2011-12 and 2012-13.
Costs for fees and room and board are largely set by departments, such as Housing and Dining Services for meal plans and room and board, who analyze their financial needs and submit their proposed costs to Murphy. Murphy then discusses the proposed rates before they are presented to the board of trustees. These proposed rates should remain within an inflationary range of around 3 to 3.5 percent for non-tiered years, according to Murphy.
“What we thought with the 3.3 percent [tuition increase] ... was that it’s aggressive relative to our history, but consistent with many things that we’re doing,” Murphy said, mentioning the Jared L. Cohon University Center and other initiatives to enhance students’ experiences as examples of improvements these costs help to fund.
According to U.S. News & World Report, Carnegie Mellon ranked number five for most expensive private colleges and universities with a listed 2014-15 tuition and fees cost of $48,786 on the list. The university came behind Columbia University, Sarah Lawrence College, Vassar College, and Trinity College in that order. Columbia ranked highest on the list with a tuition and fees cost of $51,008.
“We need to look at a much larger picture here,” said first-year economics major Yash Maheshwari via email. Maheshwari is a member of Carnegie Mellon’s chapter of MoneyThink, a nationwide organization aimed at teaching financial literacy to high school students. “The tuition is not an expense but an investment for the next 60 years of our lives. What seems like a considerable increase today, may lead to improved gains in the long run.”
Speaking about rising tuition nationwide, Murphy said, “The real question is ‘What is the value that you return to students?’ And it’s both an economic value and a non-economic value, and I think as a nation it’s important that we recognize both.”
“On the other hand, I wouldn’t want us to get complacent about [rising costs],” Murphy continued. “And so we need to make sure that we’re cutting costs where we can cut costs, investing where we need to invest, and making sure that students have the supports that they need.”
Editor's Note: A previous version of this articles stated that last year's increase for tuition, fees, and room and board was 2.91 percent and that 2014-15's increase was 3.99 percent. These increase percentages were tuition only.

Carnegie Mellon’s official website has received a facelift.
Visitors to the site’s homepage are now greeted with a redesign that continues to feature news related to the university and links to sections of the website such as research, admissions, and student life. 
However, the new page features larger graphics and a more modern aesthetic that allows the user to scroll through stories and information in a clear hierarchy. The university’s website was last redesigned in 2009, with the new homepage created by a team within the university.
Amanda Berneburg, senior associate director of online strategy for marketing and communications, described the goals of the redesign process as “a way to tell the CMU story in a modern way.” Berneburg emphasized that the new design is more compatible with mobile devices and is also structured “to touch upon many of the strategic priorities Dr. Suresh has spoken about.”
The homepage now contains links to portions of the website devoted to Carnegie Mellon’s global presence, as well as a list of links discussing the university’s strategic initiatives including the Simon Initiative, Brain Hub, the new Tepper Quadrangle, and others.
Berneburg called Carnegie Mellon’s homepage “the university’s front door to the world,” and explained that “this is meant to be an interim design.” She explained that the university is planning many further improvements and updates to portions of the website, though the details of a timeline or specific plans have not yet been made public.
Some portions of the website, such as those for admissions and university news, still contain pages in the same style as the previous homepage design. Berneburg said that the overall website redesign is an ongoing initiative, and that the news section of the website would be the next section to receive a design change.

Last year, Carnegie Mellon University became the exclusive higher education partner of the Antoinette Perry Award for Excellence in Theatre. As a result, the next Tony Awards will feature a new category: The Excellence in Theatre Education Award. Nominations for the award are now open, and Carnegie Mellon will play a major role in granting this award.
The award is granted to one current K–12 educator or member of an accredited theatre organization whose official responsibilities include, at least in part, theatre education. The award is unique in that the nominations are made by current and former students regardless of their own qualifications, meaning that any theatre educator in the country could potentially win. The screening process is carried out by a panel of judges made up of Carnegie Mellon’s faculty, the American Theatre Wing, The Broadway League, and other organizations prominent in the world of theatre arts.
The award, according to the Tony Awards website, will recognize educators who “discover talented students, nurture them, inspire them, and set them off on a lifelong journey as theatre supporters and professionals.”
The partnership was announced last year in a pre-broadcast announcement before the Tony Awards by Dan Martin, dean of the College of Fine Arts, along with Billy Porter (CFA, ’91) and Paula Wagner (CFA, ’69), who both graduated from Carnegie Mellon and won a Tony in 2013 and received a nomination in 2014, respectively. Porter won the award in 2013 for Best Actor in a Musical for his role as Lola in Kinky Boots, while “Mothers and Sons,” a Best Play nominee in 2014, was produced by Wagner. During the ceremony, Carnegie Mellon alumni Matt Bomer (CFA, ‘01) and Zachary Quinto (CFA, ‘99) announced the award to viewers at home, as well as to the audience.
“People don’t always realize ... that theatre has to be taught,” Jacquelyn Gutierrez, a junior scene design major, said. “It’s great we’re recognizing that there are people who do that every day.”
Senior acting major Colleen Pulawski said that she found the new award and partnership “really amazing.” 
She also expressed excitement about an increase in prominence for Carnegie Mellon as an institution in the world of theatre. “There’s never been an educational institution tied to the Tony Awards before. 
“We’re getting a lot of attention; the school is getting widely popular,” Pulawski continued. “Non-theatre people are starting to recognize the name as a place for musical theatre, sort of like Juilliard.”
“I had an acting teacher who inspired me to audition for this school,” Pulawski said when asked if there were any past teachers she would nominate. “We all had mentors.”
Alex Wanebo, a first-year acting major, said she also was glad that the award has open nominations for educators. “I had a couple [teachers] who really influenced me; I’d love to get them recognized for their work.”

New board of trustees chair former PNC CEO
Former Chairman and Chief Executive Officer (CEO) of PNC Financial Services Group James Rohr has been elected chairman of Carnegie Mellon’s board of trustees, according to a university press release.
Rohr joined the board in 1992. Among his contributions to the board, he has been vice chairman since 2012, currently chairs the board’s nominating and governance committee, and serves on the finance committee. He was the finance committee’s vice chair from 2007–12 and chaired the search committee that ultimately selected Subra Suresh as Carnegie Mellon’s current president.
Rohr also helped establish the university’s PNC Center for Financial Services Innovation within the Tepper School of Business, as well as a PNC Professorship in Finance, according to the university news release.
Rohr became PNC’s CEO in 2000 and retired last year.
Rohr will take the place of Raymond Lane, who became chairman in 2009, and is a life trustee of the university. Lane, partner emeritus at Menlo Park, Calif.-based venture capital firm Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers, will remain a member of the board and will continue to serve on its executive committee, according to the release.
“As one of America’s most successful business leaders, Jim Rohr has provided insightful guidance and service to Carnegie Mellon as a member of the board of trustees for 22 years,” President Suresh said in the release.
About Lane, President Suresh said, “Ray Lane has been an outstanding and inspiring chairman of the board, guiding it effectively during a period of transition at the university.”
Shirley, Neville now graduate student housing
As part of a number of changes to this year’s housing selection process, Shirley and Neville apartments will no longer be available as options for undergraduate students for the 2015-16 academic year. Instead, the on-campus locations will be open for graduate students.
The choice to offer these locations to graduate students is part of “an effort to create a more concentrated living experience for graduate students,” according to Housing Services’s “What’s New for Room Selection 2015” webpage.
The website specifies that graduate students will apply for these spaces in an application separate from the normal room selection process, with more information about the application coming soon.
Students living in Shirley and Neville Apartments this year are eligible to participate in other phases of the selection process, but cannot retain their current apartments.
In addition to this change, the housing selection process has been moved forward dramatically. The housing portal, where students can select their room assignments, will open on Feb. 15. Students looking to keep their current rooms must specify that they are retaining by Feb. 18, while students participating in general room selection must apply by Feb. 26.
Students living in Greek houses this year will now also be able to participate in room selection, where previously they could not move back on campus.
Editor’s Note: For more information about Carnegie Mellon’s room selection process and information about the university’s housing options, look for The Tartan’s housing insert in next week’s issue.

Business affairs: Strip/Crawl, news app, First Lectures
Senate reported that its Strip/Crawl event in the Strip District was a success, with approximately 400 people using a chartered bus shuttle for the event. Marty’s Market, which was located next to the shuttle stop and gave Carnegie Mellon students a 10 percent discount, saw a $900 increase in sales, according to Senate.
As part of the Collegiate Readership Program, USA Today is launching a campus news app with Carnegie Mellon as a pilot participant.
Additionally, The First Lectures series, a lecture series during which seniors speak about their experiences at Carnegie Mellon, will occur in February, March, and April.
Special allocation: Water polo
Men’s water polo requested $1,506 for three delayed flights during their return from the Division III National Collegiate Club Championship in Maine, in which the team placed sixth out of nine teams. The coach’s flight expenses were not paid for, with a rationale that Senate does not pay for non-student flights. A reduction was made to the requested reimbursement because the costs were considered more than Joint Funding Committee metrics would allow.
Special allocation:  Dancers’ Symposium
Dancers’ Symposium was allocated approximately $1,100 to rent The Porch at Schenley over Carnival for the organization’s 25th anniversary.
Getting feedback from students
Student Senate said that it wants to hear more from others on campus about initiatives they want to see. Senate would select student organizations recognized by The Bridge and meet with them to hear their ideas about possible initiatives. Organizations would be contacted before meetings so that they have time to prepare their ideas.

Marriage equality is on its final victory lap. New wins are arriving faster than most Americans are bothering to keep track of them, and the Supreme Court may finally take a stand on the issue once and for all.
It’s been an eventful year and a half since the Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA) and Proposition 8 were repealed in June 2013. Same-sex couples have gained the freedom to marry in 23 states, adding to an incredible total of 36 states, as reported by  GLAAD. Bans have been declared unconstitutional in an additional 10 states, pending appeal. The last four strongholds against marriage equality — Georgia, Louisiana, Nebraska, and North Dakota — are predictably located in rural America. However, it seems only a matter of time before they cave to the pressure of history, as Alabama did only this Friday. 
Through all of these developments, the Supreme Court has maintained a lackadaisical, hands-off attitude. It set up the game of dominoes by repealing DOMA, but up until now the court has seemed content to simply let same-marriage bans become obsolete one state at a time. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the 6th Circuit changed the Supreme Court’s thinking. The 6th Circuit broke the precedent set by all prior circuits by upholding same-sex marriage bans in Ohio, Michigan, Kentucky and Tennessee. As such, on Jan. 16 the Supreme Court announced their intention to take on representative cases from these states, with a verdict expected in June.
The Supreme Court will settle their stance on two questions. The first is whether same-sex couples have the right to marry in all 50 states, and the second is whether all 50 states have the obligation to recognize same-sex marriages licenses issued legally out-of-state. At this point, all signs point toward a positive on both questions. An anti-marriage equality ruling would be a logistical nightmare for the government, annulling thousands of formerly recognized marriages and exponentially complicating tax law, as discussed in Slate magazine.
Plus, a negative ruling would be disastrous for public opinion. The majority of Americans are in favor of nationwide marriage equality, and 70 percent of the population is currently experiencing it, according to The Huffington Post. In plenty of ways, we’re already living in a post-marriage discrimination world. If the Supreme Court were to avoid striking the final blow, based on the precedent America has been building for years, it would be more than a head-scratcher; it’d be abject foolishness.
Now, let’s just say that we win. June comes, and the United States becomes the 19th nation where same-sex couples can freely marry. What happens then? As GLAAD President and CEO Sarah Kate Ellis warns: “Even as we look forward to the Supreme Court’s decision, we must also remember that marriage equality in America is a benchmark, not a finish line.”
America likes its progress narratives. We like a good rags-to-riches tale of overcoming adversity and arriving at some concrete point of success. The fight for marriage equality — state by state, culminating in that final Supreme Court smackdown — is a perfect example of the satisfying progress narrative. Unfortunately, the progress narrative is a myth. Society isn’t pushing forward to any set point; history is set in its path of one step forward, two steps back, a few more steps sideways, and probably even a cha-cha real smooth for good measure.
Many legal and social changes are visible and worthwhile, and many go on to improve the lives of thousands or millions in very real ways. But racism didn’t go away with abolition and it wasn’t obliterated by the Civil Rights Act. Neither did sexism vanish with the 19th Amendment or Roe v. Wade. Marriage equality will not end homophobia, and anyone who claims otherwise was probably never much of an ally in the first place.
We must start arming ourselves against the opponents who are coming: those who will use marriage equality to silence activists for all remaining LGBTQ concerns. Freedom to marry pales a little in comparison to the freedom many queer people still lack to openly live their lives without fear of discrimination, prejudice, and violence. 
As we celebrate this huge victory, we must avoid falling into the progress narrative’s trap. It will be better by far to focus on those individuals who are still in need of change, and who will continue to be for the foreseeable future.

When I think about my time at Carnegie Mellon, I think about a whirlwind of incredible experiences: Greek Sing, Spring Carnival, and late nights at Razzy. But I also think about that gnawing question that always lurked: What in the world am I going to do after I leave here?
Although this question is the quickest way to get any senior’s heart pounding and palms sweating, I actually have several ways I could answer it. I could look for a consulting job in New York, apply to law school, or take some time off backpacking through Europe. I have choices. But the question of what I could do after graduation actually has a second part — what should I do? As I turned each choice over in my head, none of them felt quite right.
I grew up in Ann Arbor, Michigan, a place where Ph.D.’s are easier to find than McDonald’s. With both of my parents working as educators for the University of Michigan, education had always been a top priority for my family. As a kid, I didn’t recognize just how privileged this made me. Yes, I worked hard to get to and through college and I faced struggles along the way. But I went to a high school where kids were expected to graduate and we had plenty of extra support and resources to help us plan our next chapters. Whenever I needed support, I never had to look far.
On top of all this, it wasn’t just my family and teachers that encouraged me. Examples of successful people who look like me were all around, from the people I saw on campus during college visits to the majority of government leaders and actors I watch on TV. Everywhere I turned, society told me I could be whatever I chose.
Meanwhile, too many kids lack the opportunity to imagine a fulfilling future for themselves. For students growing up in our lowest-income communities, just six percent will graduate from college by the time they’re 25. 
This statistic in no way reflects kids’ capabilities — it’s a result of deeply entrenched systems of oppression that have denied low-income kids equal access to opportunity for decades. I know that I can use my experiences to help kids battling these odds imagine an ambitious future they define for themselves, and make that future a reality. More importantly, I believe I should.
I applied to Teach For America because I believe that privilege is a responsibility. I didn’t ask for this privilege any more than Madison, a little girl I encountered during my internship in the juvenile court, asked to bounce around foster homes. When I think about what I can and should do with my privilege, working to be part of creating a more equitable system for kids like Madison is the answer that fits.
I know this work will be incredibly challenging and humbling, and I will have to push myself harder than I ever have to give my students the education they deserve. I will need to work in close partnership with the parents, teachers, and community members who have been working towards justice and equity long before I arrived. 
But I don’t want a job that lets me turn a blind eye to the injustice kids face every day. I want one that holds me accountable for the injustices that plague our communities — because, although I did not create them, I’d still bear responsibility if I chose not to address them.
As I become a Teach For America corps member after graduation, I’ll be joining a network of more than 47,000 people working relentlessly to make access to opportunity equitable. Teach For America is a network of leaders, vastly diverse in background and experience, working across sectors to create change. 
We are all united around the fundamental belief that a quality education is not a privilege — it is a right. We can fight to ensure all students get to enjoy that right. 
As you think about what in the world you’re going to do after you leave Carnegie Mellon, I hope you’ll join us.
Molly Shanley is a senior decision science and international relations and politics major.

A second Town Meeting for the entire university community on Carnegie Mellon’s 2015 strategic plan is scheduled for Jan. 28, 4:30-6:00 p.m. at the Posner Center. One of our priorities for the discussion is an exploration of what a “Transformative CMU Experience” means for students. We encourage Carnegie Mellon students — undergrad, masters, and doctoral — to attend this meeting and share your perspectives with others who are invested in the future of the university.
We are at an exciting time in history as experts around the world are contemplating how higher education will reinvent itself in the face of many new challenges and opportunities. Institutions are exploring and adopting elements such as online learning, flipped classrooms, modular micro-courses, collaborative capstones, residential learning commons, entrepreneurial sandboxes and global engagement partnerships, just to name a few. What will, or should, the residential college experience of the future look like? 
As Carnegie Mellon develops its own plan for the years to come, it is important for us as a community to affirm the core elements of the Carnegie Mellon student experience and determine what makes us distinctive, what bold experiments should be tested, and what expertise we have to offer to advance learning on our campus and beyond.
Some campuses define an education by a list of required courses, and divide the student experience into what happens inside and outside of the classroom. From our earliest days as an institution, we at Carnegie Mellon have recognized the importance of an integrated approach that embraces the idea that the whole of the student experience is more than the sum of its parts. 
We encourage students to be active learners, creative thinkers, real-world problem solvers, and interdisciplinary collaborators. Our students pursue unique educational experiences that combine intellectual passions and focused study with applied learning and community engagement. As we look to the future, how do we build on this foundation?
There are many initiatives and programs across campus that are the direct product of student ideas and action. What is your idea? We hope you will take the time and share with us. Please consider coming to the meeting on Jan. 28. If you cannot make the meeting, visit www.cmu.edu/strategic-plan where you can put your thoughts in writing. Every comment is recorded and considered, because every perspective is valued. It’s an exciting time to be at Carnegie Mellon, and we look forward to imagining the future together with you.
Amy Burkert, Vice Provost for Education and Gina Casalegno, Dean of Student Affairs.

On Jan. 7 at about 11:30 a.m., France faced its largest national security threat in decades. Two violent extremists broke into the offices of the satirical weekly Charlie Hebdo and opened fire on unarmed civilians. amidst proclamations of "allah-u-ikbar," they rained approximately 50 shots of gunfire onto the magazine’s staff, killing eleven and injuring seven others. The attack was apparently motivated by "blasphemous" images of the Prophet Muhammad that Charlie Hebdo routinely published.
In the following weeks, support and solidarity for Charlie Hebdo and France poured in from all quarters. Within days, #JeSuisCharlie was retweeted over 5 million times. Vigils and marches were held in cities all around the world, from London and Amsterdam to Melbourne and Perth. A massive unity rally, attended by approximately 3.7 million people throughout France — including 40 world leaders — was centered in Paris on Jan. 11. Furthermore, the post-attack "Survivors' Issue" of Charlie Hebdo was bought by nearly 7 million people who wanted to express their support for the magazine.
Let me be absolutely clear: complete freedom of speech is one of modern society’s greatest achievements, and using violence to suppress this freedom in the name of God is unjustifiably, unforgivably evil. Stifling controversial ideas through force is a highly condemnable act that is rightly illegal. That said, the glorification of Charlie Hebdo and its positions, as demonstrated by the outpour of support for the magazine over the past few weeks, sets a dangerous precedent and tends to miss the very point that Charlie Hebdo has tried to make.
Going through Charlie Hebdo’s previous issues, one discovers the magazine's penchant for taking brutally crude aim at all kinds of figures that societies around the world revere. From religious prophets such as Jesus and Muhammad, to important figures today such as the Pope and the President of the United States, Charlie Hebdo has been equally offensive to all. It has reveled in its ability to upset and affront, and generally be a shameless irritant to unimaginative, uptight, mainstream society. This brand of humor, colloquially known as “gouaille” in France, does not attempt to align itself with any one particular school of thought. Instead, it attacks anyone and anything that attempts to position itself as an exclusive purveyor of the truth.
The veneration of Charlie Hebdo in western media over the past few weeks is the very sort of phenomenon that Charlie Hebdo would mock. The massive marches, the hashtag, and the sales of Charlie Hebdo’s latest issue are cruelly ironic, in that they fly in the face of the very anti-establishment sentiment that has traditionally been Charlie Hebdo’s lifeblood. Memorializing the murdered staff of Charlie Hebdo as martyrs of free speech is to turn them into the very kinds of icons that they routinely ridiculed.
Another reason not to glorify Charlie Hebdo is somewhat more depressing and far more practical. One cannot escape the fact that several of their issues are deeply offensive to massive swathes of people, particularly Muslims, to whom any image of Muhammad — let alone a blatantly offensive depiction — is sacrilegious. Some of their covers include a bare-naked Prophet Muhammad lying prostrate and Muhammad being beheaded by an ISIS fighter. 
If such material resulted in a violent attack when their circulation was in the thousands, consider what might result now that their circulation is in the millions. Giving such material widespread circulation is akin to providing ammunition to Al Qaeda and other peddlers of propaganda and extremism. Although an overwhelming majority of the world's Islamic population is moderate and peace loving, Charlie Hebdo’s material, far more than ever before, is angering those on the fringes of the moderates and pushing them towards extremism. On the other side of the fence, in the political climate left by the wake of the attacks, Charlie Hebdo’s material is unwittingly promoting Islamophobia within Western Europe and beyond.
According to Radio French Internationale, more anti-Muslim incidents have taken place in France since the Charlie Hebdo attacks than in all of 2014. n the meanwhile, following the publication of the "Survivors' Issue," South Asia and the Middle East have been swept by protests against *Charlie Hebdo and its depictions of the Prophet, according to Yahoo News. In a sense, the glorification of Charlie Hebdo has pushed both sides further away from each other than ever before.
Traditionally, Charlie Hebdo’s brand of offensive humor has raised questions about our icons that deserve to be raised. With the attention Charlie Hebdo has gotten since the attacks, its societal role has undergone deep change. Pre-veneration Charlie Hebdo was a subcultural symbol of rebellion and impropriety. Post-veneration Charlie Hebdo strikes more hatred into the world than curiosity.

An article released this week in The New York Times floats the possibility that if sororities allowed alcohol into their houses, there may be a decrease in the occurrence of sexual assault on campuses across the nation.
A study funded by the U.S. Department of Justice concluded that 25 percent of alcohol or drug-enabled sexual assaults are perpetrated by fraternity members, and attending a fraternity party makes women 1.4 times more likely to be sexually assaulted. The argument in favor of allowing sororities to serve alcohol is that changing the venue changes the control.
When women attend parties with alcohol at fraternity houses, the men are in control. They dictate the guest list, the drinks, and the exits. The party scene of Greek life is entirely dependent on the fraternities and the choices they make, which leaves women more vulnerable to sexual assault.
By giving women in sororities the privilege of hosting parties with alcohol, they gain the ability to control their environment. There is also the added advantage that when women are in charge, they are less vulnerable and more likely to be proactive about sexual assault. If something suspicious appears to be happening, sorority sisters could look out for one another and police the situation more effectively than frat brothers might be able to on their own turf. While this will not eliminate sexual assault entirely, it gives more agency to the women, definitely decreasing the risk.
Yet sororities have a very long tradition of abstaining from alcohol use in the house. This is a policy dictated by the National Panhellenic Conference, which serves as the governing body for all 26 of the sororities it recognizes nationwide. 
Even though sororities benefit from the policy in terms of lifestyle and health, its historical motivations are more financial. The New York Times article cites that while the average sorority member only costs about $25-50 per year to insure, each fraternity member costs around $160 per year due to alcohol-related incidents.
While it is understandable that cost is a consideration, there are certainly other factors that should play a hand in the decision. A spokesperson for the National Panhellenic Conference (NPC) said that, despite the benefits, she found it unlikely that the policy would “[change] anywhere in the near future.” By refusing to consider the change, the NPC is favoring financial practicality over the possible benefits that may result. The issue deserves to be considered, as the sexual welfare and safety of members in the long-term should be more important than the resources that the research and insurance may cost them.
This plan does, however, place the onus on the victims to protect themselves. A more effective plan would be geared toward the perpetrators. Fraternities need to be responsible for programming that educates members on safe behaviors and then instituting policies that ensure that they are acting appropriately in high risk situations. On top of that, universities also need to take reported cases more seriously so that all perpetrators of sexual assault will face the consequences of their actions.

Predictably, Carnegie Mellon is raising its tuition. In an email sent to the campus community on Jan. 14, Vice President for Campus Affairs Michael Murphy announced that students entering college in the next academic year will pay a total of about $63,240, an increase of 3.38 percent from the previous year.
At last year’s rates, Carnegie Mellon ranked fifth most expensive private university in the United States, behind only Columbia University, Sarah Lawrence College, Vassar College, and Trinity College, according to USA Today. Though these other schools will likely also experience tuition increases, our new tuition raises us to third place by last year’s rates. That’s not a bronze medal to be proud of. 
While a leveling off of costs, let alone a decrease, is undoubtedly too much to ask, The Tartan asks Carnegie Mellon to be more transparent about the reasoning behind these costs. What is our tuition money going toward exactly, and why must costs be so high?
Carnegie Mellon is increasingly expensive at a time when the government finally seems to be taking strides to make higher education affordable. President Barack Obama has proposed a plan that would provide all American students two free years of community college, given they maintain a 2.5 GPA and demonstrate steady progress toward an associates degree or a transfer to a four-year university. The federal government would pick up 75 percent of the costs, with states covering the rest.
Obama’s community college initiative is revolutionary and long overdue. The initial public reaction to its unveiling has been overwhelmingly positive, and it seems the only thing that might stop it from happening is opposition from the Republican Congress. America is desperately in need of education reform, and the President’s plan would drastically improve the lives of millions of students and increase education opportunities across the nation.
As Obama outlined in his State of the Union address Tuesday, college should be “as free and universal in America as high school is today.” The Tartan hopes that this will be the first step toward more affordable college education in general. Private, far-from-free universities such as Carnegie Mellon should take a page from President Obama’s book, and keep his plan in mind when the time comes to discuss next year’s tuition.

This year, Carnegie Mellon students enjoyed a three-day weekend for Martin Luther King, Jr. Day for the first time in recent years.
In August, President Suresh emailed students to inform them of the change, saying: “I have decided to declare MLK Day a university holiday. This will allow us to honor Dr. King, while extending and enriching the excellent service and community engagement programs that reflect our commitment to Dr. King’s dream throughout the month of January.” The holiday included a wide variety of diversity based programming, and The Tartan was excited by many of the events that were offered, especially the Colors@CMU celebration.
The campus participation was heartening, and indicates that on CMU’s campus, many students are accepting of differences and able to have a healthy, open dialogue regarding these issues. The administration’s decision to make this “day off” mean something strengthens this campus’s commitment to diversity and is an indicator of the strides that society is making.
However, it is important to remember that this attitude is not indicative of society as a whole. In the Pittsburgh community, reactions to celebrations and protests were less than warm. 
For example, when protests blocked streets in Oakland last Monday, students took to the popular anonymous social media app Yik Yak to express their frustrations, linking the inconvenience of the protests to their apparent lack of interest in civil rights issues. Many postings were, intentionally or not, offensive and upsetting, highlighting the ignorance, hate, and casual racism still present in our community.
As members of an influential college community, we need to continue promoting the acceptance of diversity and the celebration of civil rights. 
Our attitudes can influence the attitudes of others, and we can catalyze real change in the greater Pittsburgh community. Remembering heroes who fought for equality and participating in carefully designed programming are strong first steps, but we must remember to keep our convictions throughout the year as well.
