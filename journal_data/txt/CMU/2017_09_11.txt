On Saturday, the Carnegie Mellon football team scored their second win of the season, and first at home, with a dominant first-half performance against the University of Rochester Yellowjackets, opening the 2017 season 2–0. The offense was propelled by a four-touchdown game from senior running back Sam Benger, and by the defense, which forced a punt or turnover on downs in each of Rochester’s first half drives.
The Yellowjackets opened the game with the ball first, slowly making their way to midfield. After the Tartans’ defense stalled them at the Carnegie Mellon 47-yard line, the Yellowjackets were forced to punt. On the next play, the first of the game for the Carnegie Mellon offense, Benger broke free for a 92-yard touchdown. After another defensive stop near midfield by the Cardinal and Gray, the Tartans were back on offense. Powered by a pass interference penalty, the Tartans quickly found themselves deep in Rochester territory. With three minutes left in the first quarter, Benger added a second touchdown to double Carnegie Mellon’s lead with an 11-yard pass from junior quarterback Alex Cline. The first quarter ended with the Tartans leading 14–0.
The start of the second quarter was more of the same for the Yellowjackets, who turned the ball over on downs less than a minute into the quarter. The Tartans capitalized with Cline throwing his second touchdown of the game, an 18-yard dart to senior wide receiver John Prather, putting the team ahead 21–0. The Tartans’ dominance continued when sophomore Willie Richter returned a punt 86 yards for a touchdown after a Rochester three-and-out. On the next Carnegie Mellon possession, Benger returned to the score line with a third touchdown, this time for 65 yards. The final drive of the half for the Tartans, after another Rochester three-and-out, saw Benger score a 21-yard touchdown, marking the game the fifth time in his career he scored four touchdowns. The half ended with the home team leading 42–0.
The Tartans started the second half with the ball, this time in the hands of senior quarterback Scot Beumel. Many of the team’s starters, including Benger, Cline, and Prather, rested during the second half. First-year quarterback JD Dayhuff and senior quarterback Andrew Nickell also played minutes in the third and fourth quarters. With six minutes left in the third quarter, Dayhuff fumbled the ball, which was recovered by the Yellowjackets in Carnegie Mellon territory, their very first break in the game. On the ensuing drive, the Yellowjackets scored their first touchdown of the game, putting points on the visitor side of the scoreboard, making the score 42–7.
In the fourth quarter, the Yellowjackets finally started to show some life, though far too late, scoring a second touchdown after another Carnegie Mellon turnover. However, the Tartans maintained their 42–14 lead for the rest of the game.
The Tartans finished the game with 511 yards of total offense, dwarfing Rochester’s 263 yards. The Carnegie Mellon defense recorded 7 sacks of 31 yards for loss, and forced 7 punts. The Tartans did commit more turnovers, three to Rochester’s one.
Benger played only in the first half, but amassed 208 yards off 8 carries, 3 rushing touchdowns, and 1 passing touchdown. Prather had 76 yards from 5 catches and a touchdown. Cline went 9-for-14 passing for 146 yards and 2 touchdowns. First-year wide receiver Alex Oshita saw action during the second half, catching 4 passed for 46 yards. On the defensive side, junior linebacker Quinn Zsido recorded 9 total sacks, 5 of them solo. First-year linebacker Mason Tolliver made 7 total tackles and also caught his first career interception.
The Tartans will next play against Waynesburg University on Saturday, Sept. 16.

With the new year in football comes the revival of fantasy football leagues across the nation, as millions return to the game that manages to get people to care about even the worst teams like the Cleveland Browns: fantasy football. Last year, Editor-in-Chief India Price defeated my team by two points to take the championship in The Tartan’s first year of fantasy football. This year, the league has reconvened as Tartan FF 2017, featuring returning veterans and two newcomers to Tartan fantasy. Here’s a recap of our league’s draft as all teams dream for the championship (or at least hope not to fail miserably).
Justin Tucker Must (not) Die
Tartan staff member Lula Beresford returned to fantasy football hoping to avenge last year’s eighth place finish. The randomized draft order allowed her to pick first overall this year, and she decided to put her trust in Pittsburgh Steelers running back Le’Veon Bell. Bell is a solid player who comes as both a ground threat and a quality receiver who could be her most reliable player, provided he stays out of persistent drug troubles.
Past this point, any semblance of a typical draft strategy went out the window. At the end of the second round, Beresford reached for New England Patriots quarterback Tom Brady, and soon after selected Green Bay Packers quarterback Aaron Rodgers at the top of the fifth round. While it’s understandable to want two quality quarterbacks, she would have been better off shoring up her roster with better running backs and wide receivers. Added to the fact that she was earliest to pick a defense, opting for the Denver Broncos defense, at the end of the eighth round and the earliest to pick a kicker, choosing Baltimore Ravens kicker Justin Tucker, and there is a fundamental mismatch between Beresford’s strategy and fantasy victory. At least since this year only has six teams competing, she literally can’t place worse than she did last year.
Third-String Team
Assistant Sports Editor Marika Yang groaned when I asked her to join our league since she was already taking part in two other leagues. Still, she agreed to participate, aptly titling her team as third-string. The quality of her players, however, are anything but that. Yang first picked Arizona Cardinals running back David Johnson, fantasy’s top running back in 2016. Her second pick netted Cincinnati Bengals wide receiver A.J. Green, one of the most reliable receivers in fantasy.
In the third round, she made a somewhat risky move by selecting Oakland Raiders running back Marshawn Lynch. Lynch decided to come out of retirement to play for the Raiders. Though he may have some rust, the Raiders offensive line and quality passing attack may afford Lynch enough breathing room to make plays. In the fifth round, Yang got Kansas City Chiefs tight end Travis Kelce, fantasy’s top tight end in 2016. She then waited through a run on quarterbacks and grabbed Atlanta Falcons quarterback Matt Ryan, the second best quarterback in 2016. Overall, Yang’s team looks to be a contender for the playoffs, especially since she actually knows stuff about football.
Team Andah
As evident by the current lack of a special name for his team, SciTech Editor Josh Andah decided to try his hand at learning about football and participating in fantasy. Unfortunately, he didn’t show up for the draft, throwing himself to the mercy of autopick. Andah ended up with a strong core of starters, headlined by Steelers wide receiver Antonio Brown. Brown’s status as the league’s deadliest catching threat is one of the biggest reasons why the Steelers offense is a nightmare for opposing defenses to plan for, and it translates well to fantasy performance as Brown finished as 2016’s number one fantasy receiver. Andah supplemented his receiving corp with Tampa Bay Buccaneers wide receiver Mike Evans, one of the strongest receivers in the league.
Chicago Bears running back Jordan Howard was a waiver wire star last year, and Andah may have himself a good workhorse at running back. He only has one quarterback: Seattle Seahawks quarterback Russell Wilson. Wilson will be fine, and there are many quarterbacks available on the waiver wire. The biggest threat to Andah’s chances of victory is his own activity or lack thereof. Evans, for instance, won’t play this week because the game has been postponed due to Hurricane Irma. He has not yet changed this slot at the time of this writing, which may serve as a precursor to him losing easy points by not changing to players who are actually playing. While his roster seems fine, it’s up to Andah to keep making it work as the year goes on.
Drop it Like it’s Crock
Publisher Jade Crockem finished in third place last year, but she’s still bitter about missing the finals and eager to claim victory this year. She first chose Packers running back Ty Montgomery, a surprising rushing and receiving threat who emerged last year as a shock to teams he played against. Another early pick landed her Packers wide receiver Jordy Nelson, the second best receiver in 2016. She reached a bit for Carolina Panthers tight end Greg Olsen, but it may be worth securing 2016’s third best fantasy tight end.
Getting ahead of the sixth round’s quarterback run, Crockem selected Dallas Cowboys quarterback Dak Prescott, showing bias for her family’s team but still getting someone who should be a solid quarterback. Taking Cardinals wide receiver Larry Fitzgerald was a move that cut me from one of my most valuable players in 2016, which was a good call. Time will tell whether this year will belong to Crockem or not.
Easy Breesy
This year will likely be my last for fantasy, as my interest in football has been dropping out. In deciding what receiver to take, I found myself spooked by New York Giants wide receiver Odell Beckham’s poor performance against the Packers last year as his decision to take a vacation with the receiving corps rather than practice resulted in tons of dropped balls. The offseason did not suggest that he had learned his lesson, pushing me to opt for Falcons wide receiver Julio Jones instead. Buffalo Bills running back LeSean McCoy should prove to be a strong running back as the focal point of Buffalo’s offense.
Tennessee Titans running back DeMarco Murray reliably averaged 20 points per game last season outside of the final two single point performances. I reached a bit for both Patriots tight end Rob Gronkowski and New Orleans Saints quarterback Drew Brees, but I believe in both players’ power to dominate games. While things went well for me last season in terms of a lack of crippling injuries, I’ll need to stay alert if I want to return to the championships.
Yes We Cam
Price began her title defense with a strong draft performance. Taking Beckham after I passed on him, she later picked up Falcons running back Devonta Freeman and Cowboys running back Ezekiel Elliot. Elliot in particular was a steal since he had been rated lower on the board due to the NFL’s six-game suspension on him due to domestic abuse allegations. A judge blocked this suspension on Friday, setting up a legal battle that may cause Elliot to avoid missing any games this year, which is advantageous for Price. Compromised morals mean nothing when it comes to fantasy football.
Evidently, Price believes that Panthers quarterback Cam Newton can make a comeback this year after he fell off stat wise last season. One strange move Price made was picking the Steelers defense in the fifth round, even before selecting Newton. In the long run, the opportunity cost of picking a defense so early probably won’t have too much of an effect, but it remains curious that the championship winner last year would make such a move.

On Friday, Sept. 1 and Saturday, Sept. 2, the 22nd-ranked Carnegie Mellon women’s soccer team opened the season by competing in the Carnegie Mellon DoubleTree Tartan Cup.
Against Frostburg State, the Tartans put three shots on goal through the first 45 minutes. All three came in the final 10 minutes of the half, but Frostburg’s goalkeeper, Jenny Bullers, was there to stop each one.
The Tartans took control in the second period with their first shot coming 32 seconds after the whistle when first-year midfielder Kristen Chong fired a shot on net that Bullers stopped. Less than a minute later, senior midfielder Tori Iatarola had a shot turned away by Bullers.
In the 61st minute, a shot by senior forward Haili Adams hit the right post before junior forward Katja Bracklemanns-Puig’s shot in the 63rd minute was just high.
Less than a minute after entering the pitch, junior forward Kaily Bruch connected on a left-footed shot to the upper left corner, giving the Tartans the goal they needed. First-year forward Ashley Akin collected the ball to the left of the 18-yard box and centered a pass to Bruch who took a controlled touch to her left before curling the shot past Bullers.
Two more shots for the Tartans were stopped by Bullers, as the Tartans went on for the 1–0 win.
Against Bridgewater College, the Tartans put three shots on frame in the first period but all were turned away by their goalkeeper while the Tartan defense didn’t allow a shot by Bridgewater (0–1–1).
55 seconds into the second half, senior midfielder Morgan Kontor deflected a corner kick by Iatarola into the near post and in goal for the Eagles.
In the 57th minute, sophomore forward Ryan Casey won a ball on the left sideline and poked a pass to Adams in the central part of the field. Adams dribbled into open space and laced a shot center and high from just outside the penalty arc that sailed over goalkeeper Davis and into the net for a 2-0 lead for the Tartans.
A similar play happened in the 65th minute when Casey challenged a defender along the left side. The ball bounced off the defender and to the foot of senior forward Sienna Stritter in the midfield. Stritter dribbled into open space and lofted a shot high over the outstretched arms of Davis and into the net for her first goal of the season and the Tartan 3-0 lead.
In the 88th minute, Casey found the back of the net herself after a long throw in by senior defender Katie Strycharz bounced over a defender where Casey then chipped the keeper for the score.
The final goal of the night came off the foot of Chong in the 89th minute. Iatarola played a low free kick toward the near post that Chong finished with her right foot at the near post.

The 20th-ranked Carnegie Mellon men’s soccer team scored five unanswered goals to open the home season with a 5–0 shutout against Denison University on Sunday, Sept. 3. The Tartans moved to 1–1 on the season while the Big Red dropped to 0–2.
Senior midfielder Jimmy Jameson and junior midfielder Zack Masciopinto accounted for all five goals as Jameson put three in the back of the net, including the game winner.
The scoring came early as Jameson first scored in the sixth minute. Following a corner kick to the near post by junior forward Anthony Gulli, Jameson got around the keeper on the endline and poked the ball around the goal post.
Less than four minutes later, the Tartans were in the box again and Masciopinto scored off a volley from the ground after the Denison defense failed to clear a corner kick by junior defender Philip Petrakian.
Another corner kick by Petrakian set up the third goal by the Tartans. Jameson again was in the play and headed home the service at the near post in the 13th minute.
The fourth goal of the first half came via a Jameson penalty kick. Petrakian was fouled at the edge of the 18-yard box by the keeper to earn the penalty attempt in the 38th minute.
Masciopinto put in the final goal of the game in the early moments of the 63rd minute when he rose above the defense to put a header in off a centrally placed free kick by Gulli.
Junior goalkeeper Alec Lam and first-year goalkeeper Alex Singh combined for the shutout, with Lam earning the victory after nearly 77 minutes played.

How do animals that hunt in packs make group decisions? African wild dogs have it  gured out: they sneeze.
African wild dogs are one of the most cooperative species on the planet. Wild dogs bond within a group more strongly than lions or hyenas, and they are extraordinarily non-aggressive toward each other. A pack of dogs works together to prevent inbreeding, raise their young, defend the pack, and hunt. This lifestyle means coming to a group consensus, which is extremely important, especially for hunting and migrating; the pack needs to decide when to get going and when to stay put.
To make these decisions, the pack holds a round of group sneezes called a rally, according to a study published this week in Proceedings of the Royal Society of London. The sneezing rally serves as a rudimentary voting process. The more sneezes, the more likely the rally is to succeed: that is, getting the pack to move.
This study is the  rst to  nd that wild dogs use sneezes to communicate. The most surprising  nding is not the sneezing itself, but the fact that the sneezing seems democratic: the dogs follow a fairly strict dominance hierarchy, so scientists previously thought that the highest- ranked dogs made decisions for the group; yet, it turns out, even the dogs at the bottom of the hierarchy have a say.
While groundbreaking for dogs, the vote-by-sneeze process isn’t really democratic by human standards. Any dog can initiate a sneezing rally, but the lower a dog’s social rank, the more sneezes it needs for its rally to succeed. And some dogs have been observed to “vote” more than once.
Study co-author Reena Walker hopes that the modest media attention to the study’s findings will raise public awareness of African wild dogs, an endangered species. “They’re absolutely gorgeous animals,” she told National Geographic. “The more people who are aware [of] how amaz- ing these animals are, the better.”
African wild dogs are highly endangered, because their natural habitat in sub- Saharan Africa is being rapidly replaced by human settlements. They are also frequently shot by farmers hoping to protect their livestock.
There are about 3,000 remaining African wild dogs, including those in parks and reserves, and this population is decreasing. Conservation groups like the African Wild Dog Conservancy in Kenya and Painted Dog Conservation in Zimbabwe are work- ing to reverse this trend — they collaborate with local communities to monitor the dogs, combat poaching, and raise awareness.

An up and coming Uber competitor recently launched its service in London, then took it down a mere three days later. The Estonian ride- hailing app has been marketed as a much cheaper rival to Uber; it’s fares average half of those on Uber.
Taxify, founded by Markus Villig, failed to register itself as a private-hire operator. The
registration is required by law in England for ride-hailing companies to operate within the country. Taxify paused its London efforts to clarify its legal standing amid an urgent investigation launched by London transport regulator Transport for London (TfL). In fact, TfL ordered Taxify to stop accepting rides; the app says no drivers are available in the city.
As Taxify sticks to its goal to supersede Uber as the go-to ride-hailing app, this turn of events is sure to hurt business. Taxify’s inability to check with England’s transport laws pins the  rm as either negligent or callous. Nonetheless, Taxify labels itself as a London- based private hire company, something TfL certainly disagrees with — hence the investigation.
Taxify shared with Business Insider that 30,000 people in London downloaded the app since the announcement of its arrival. 3,000 drivers signed up for the service as well. There certainly is much excitement around Taxify’s low fare rates, which best Uber’s, and its introduction into a new market. Furthermore, Taxify only takes a 10–15 percent cut of the fare, whereas Uber takes a 20–25 percent cut, something its drivers vocally complained about.
Taxify has successfully operated in up to 25 cities thus far, not including London. The
 rm certainly shows promise, and a working business model. Villig founded the company at 19 years old, only a high school student, in 2013. Since its founding, the company has raised $2.4 million in investments and venture capital.
All its drivers undergo criminal background checks, as safety of passengers is a top priority for Taxify. Rider safety has been an issue for Uber, with numerous stories of assault and rape.
Once Taxify clarifies its legal standpoint in London, hopefully its operations will be back up in London. The city is a great market to determine the startups rigor against giants like Uber and Lyft. Who knows: Taxify’s much cheaper prices may force their competitors to drop their prices as well, a consequence of ecomonic competition, making things better for us — the customers.

Anupam Datta, associate professor of electrical and computer engineering at Carnegie Mellon, is taking on the challenge of adding fair- ness to automated tasks. With a $3 million fund from the Natural Science Foundation, Datta hopes to improved automated tasks that affect healthcare, criminal justice, and advertisement. This would be done by making these systems, in a sense, more fair.
Datta said in a Carnegie Mellon press release, “A key innovation of the project is to automatically account for why an automated system with arti cial intelligence components exhibits behavior that is problematic for privacy or fairness.” 
For example, some arti cial intelligence systems were recently found to show prejudice and partialness as a result of the content they were fed.
The potential for these is- sues to affect industries and consumers, especially as machine learning software becomes more widespread, is what brought this research team together.
The team is made of Assistant Professor of Computer Science Matthew Fredrikson, principal systems scientist in electrical and computer engineering, Ole Mengshoel, Professor of Information Science at New York University Helen Nissenbaum, Associate Professor of Computer Science at Cornell University, Thomas Risten- part, and senior researcher at the International Computer Science Institute in Berke- ley, California Michael C. Tschantz.
De ning privacy and fair- ness for these systems is one of the initial challenging tasks the team faced. “Doing so is critical, since these methods are increasingly used to power automated decision systems.”
For example, Datta and Tschantz’s prior research found that women, on average, are shown less online ads about high paying jobs than men are. Their current research will also focus on ways to uphold and promote intellectual property and copy right laws online; Fredrickson commented, “This project will be great opportunity to... improve machine learning to be more privacy-friendly.”
Fairness and objectivity is especially needed in tech. Many videos have surfaced online of black people unable to use soap dispensers because sensors cannot detect their skin.
Moreover, sexism is still rampant in the Silicon Valley. The Google manifesto, for example, is a prime example of the tech industry’s closeted or pseudo-intellectual sexism.
Women at companies like Uber have expressed how much of a boys club the companies are.
It isn’t shocking that the automated systems these tech giants make will have evidence of their workplace culture in them.
This research is a step in the right direction. Ameliorating the fairness of automated systems will offer the same user experiences for all consumers, regardless of gender or ethnicity.

Hurricane Harvey inundated much of Houston in several inches of water in a matter of days. This week, Hur- ricane Irma’s 185 mph winds are devastating the Caribbean and heading for Florida next. We’re right in the grips of hurricane season, so it seems like there’s a storm every other week. In fact, there are two others forming in the Gulf of Mexico right now: Hurricanes José and Katia.
I found myself asking what exactly causes such power- ful storms, and why they occur at this time of the year, every year. I wonder if these storms are getting stronger and more disastrous with time (Irma is the strongest recorded hurricane), and if climate change is to blame. Is such a quick succession of storms normal, or are we see- ing something that has never happened before? Some of these questions have de nite answers, and the others are more ambiguous, so let’s begin from the top.
A hurricane is a rapidly rotating storm system with a low pressure center (called an eye). These storms are characterized by heavy rain and strong winds. Hurricanes are always born over oceans in tropic regions. They can range in diameter from 100 km to 2,000 km (about the width of Brazil), packing more energy than several nuclear bombs combined.
Large bodies of warm water cause hurricanes, acting as their energy source; the tropical regions of the Atlantic and Pacific oceans are most opportune. Angular momentum imparted by the Earth’s rotation, along with ocean currents and temperature changes along latitudes and longitudes drive the swirling winds. All three of these factors are needed to sustain strong storm systems, which is why hurricanes quickly dissipate upon landfall.
So many other factors affect hurricane formation. For example, the southern hemisphere experiences fewer hurricanes because of its high rates of vertical wind shear and low number of oceanic jets.
I've always thought hurricanes have interesting names: Katrina, Ike, Harvey. It turns out these aren’t randomly selected, or the names of the meteorologists who first spot the storm forming (a false claim I believed for years). They're names chosen from a register controlled by the World Meteorological Organization (WMO), which meets annually to discuss the storms of the season and retire hurricane names. If more than 21 storms strike in a season, names are then chosen from the Greek alphabet.
Hurricanes aren’t all doom and gloom. They disrupt harmful weather patterns, preventing susceptible areas from prolonged droughts. They also carry thermal energy away from the tropical regions and distribute it to the higher altitudes, helping to regulate global climates.
What I want to know is if the 2017 hurricane season is unusual. I don’t ever recall seeing such strong hurricanes strike in such quick succession. Moreover, scientists have always warned that severe climate change will exacerbate natural disasters. Is that what we’re witnessing right now?
Firstly, it turns out 2007 saw the greatest number of hurricanes in a single year, so 2017 has competition. Secondly, scientists and news outlets have concluded that unusually warm oceans gave Hurricane Irma its record-breaking strength. Hovering over waters at 29 degrees, Irma has access to leagues of energy.
Interestingly, hurricanes aren’t unique to Earth’s atmosphere. The most well known extraterrestrial storm is the Great Red Spot, found on Jupiter. This swirling cloud of red gas is larger in diameter than the Earth itself, and is essentially perpetual; it has been observed continually for 187 years (since 1830). The high pressure zone below Jupiter’s equator is ample for forming what’s called an anticyclone.
Hurricanes are a natural consequence of classic physical principles like conservation of energy and angular momentum. Even though they deliver unimaginable damage and destruction to coastal populations, hurricanes also regulate the atmosphere and dissipate energy concentrated at the equator.
Perhaps, the most unfortunate aspect of hurricanes is that they devastate regions that do not greatly contribute to global warming. The Caribbean islands and coastal towns, for example, will bare the brunt of even more powerful storms in the future, as large industrial nations like China, India, Russia, and the United States continue to pump large amounts of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere.
There is no quick fix. Agreements like the Paris Accord might not do enough or act fast enough. Until we change our relationship with energy and fossil fuels, natural distaters will only increase in strength and category.

23,000 year-old evidence of homo sapiens discovered
A rock shelter in Santa Elina, Central Brazil is now the interest of archeologists and historians. It may have just provided evidence of the  rst people to live in North and South America. 
Excavations of this site reveal that it is one of the earliest occupied regions in the area; however, it seems people also migrated away from the shelter during certain seasons.
After exploring the three layers of sediment at the site, researchers discovered clues of human interac- tion with the now extinct sloth species Glossotherium. They unearthed remains of hearths, bones, and sloth skin ornaments. 
After using three different dating methods, scientists say that humans were present at this site nearly 23,000 years ago which is well before the presence of Clovis hunters — commonly thought of as North America’s first culture.
The National Museum of Natural History in Paris was responsible for dating the bone ornaments and an article was published in Cambridge University’s archaeology journal Antiquity.

Hurricane Harvey reduced Houston elevation by 2 cm
Hurricane Harvey dumped nearly 33 trillion gallons of water on the area of Houston it hit, pushing the city’s elevation down by 2 cm. Chris Milliner, a post-doctoral fellow at NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory, shared a tweet showing the depression the land underwent.
This change in elevation could be because of the soil compacting under the immense weight; yet, stations located on bedrock also reduced in height, which suggests the depression was caused by crust deformation. This may have also elevated areas outside Houston.
The effect of water’s weight on the crust isn’t permanent or unheard of. It will be interesting to see how fast the Houston’s elevation rebounds, given that it was already sinking — a result of humans channeling groundwater out of aquifers under the city.

Startup Lilium just secured $90 mil to develop its flying car
Munich-based aviation start-up Lilium published a press-release that announced the completion of its $90 million Series B funding round. Lilium intends to use this funding to build a commercially  ying, a five- seater Lilium Jet, and expand its team beyond 70 employees.
This announcement comes after the successful test-run of their two-seater prototype aircraft. The electric “mini-jet” can hover, land, take-off vertically, and  y like an airplane. Lilium’s vision is to someday transport passengers, who would using a ride-hailing app, across cities and specified buildings. It is valuable to note that these air mobiles are no louder than an average motorbike and can fly at speeds of 187 mph on a single charge.
The investors include Skype co-founder Niklas Zennstrom , Tencent — the largest internet company in Asia — and Obvious Ventures — Twitter cofounder and former CEO Ev Williams’s venture  rm. With this fund- ing, Lilium’s total backing for its car surpasses $100 million.

The process of learning has baf ed scientists for many years. Previous approaches to studying how the brain works involved monitoring processes, such as synapse action and neuron firing, at the cellular level.
Scientists from Harvard University and the University of Pennsylvania are developing a relatively new field of neuroscience — network neuroscience. It focuses on study of the brain at a larger scale, looking at interactions between the neurons on a macro level.
Previously, scientists believed that connections regions of the brain formed amongst each other were relatively fixed and stable. New research, on the other hand, suggests that this connectivity might be far less fixed. The switching of connections, repeatedly and quickly, is called flexibility and is now considered indicative of how fast and well a person learns.
Danielle Basset, a network neuroscientists at the University of Pennsylvania, says brains that learn well also switch their connections quickly. This suggests that connections switching is the brain’s mechanism of accommodating more information.
This  eld is in its infancy, so scientists have yet to fully understand how exactly the brain’s  exibility corresponds to learning and other basic functions of the brain.
This methodology relies heavily on applied mathematics. Scientists use models to and exact numerical values to map individual neural pathways; the method is borrowed from other neural network  fields.
Scientists are already racing for ways to boost brain  exibility. This would in turn
improve people’s abilities to learn and process new information. This may even improve our understanding of mental illness, concussions, and age-related illnesses like Alzheimers.
It’s always been said that learning expands the mind. In a way it does, since the brain physically recon gures its neurons. More studies from this new sub  eld should be expected over the coming years. It may even provide a much-needed cure.
The brain is hard to study. Studies have made much headway in mapping billions of neural connections, and determining which parts of the brain perform specific functions; yet, we do not know much about how the brain develops over time, and how it does so with respect to new information and novel mental connections. It is arguably the most misunderstood organ in the body — but, perhaps, not for long.

**Hi Ruth,
I’ve been dating my sweet, wonderful boyfriend for two years now. He’s funny, caring, and head over heels for me. The problem? He’s NOT HERE. We’re only three weeks into a long-distance relationship, and it already sucks. College is supposed to be the best time of my life, but I’ve spent most of my time here sulking. I’m sad and touch-starved. My favorite part of Orientation was Play Fair because I got to actually touch people. That’s a special kind of sad. 
There’s also the practical concerns. Being in an LDR is like 20 extra units with all the time that goes to texting and Skyping. When all my friends go out on Friday, I end up staying in so we can have a “date,” which was cute the first couple of times, but I want to experience college life, too!
On one hand, I really do love him. On the other, I’m young and the drama boys are cute. What if he’s “the one”? What if he’s not?
With too warm regards due to my lonely state, 
Seriously In Need of Good Lovin’ E’rryday**
Dear SINGLE,
Have you ever heard of the “turkey drop?” It’s a well established phenomenon where couples from high school break up over Thanksgiving. Out with the old, in with the potatoes and pie, right?
I was a participant in a turkey drop, so I’ll admit I don’t have the best experience in LDRs, but I outsourced for tips. There’s all the usual advice for keeping non-LDRs together, but there are three main things specific to your conundrum.
1) Plan communication. 
A nice thing about dating someone in the same city as you — especially at the same school — is that you’re more or less guaranteed to see them regularly. Relationships thrive on intimacy and company, so you’re just going to have to try a little harder than normal to make sure that happens. Plus, you can schedule Skype dates for a time that actually works for you. If you keep having to skip hanging out with friends to talk to him, then you’re going to start resenting him. 
2) Think about them.
It is really, really easy to forget about things for days at a time if you’re not in regular proximity. The same goes for people. If you want to continue being in a relationship, remind yourself that you are! LDRs aren’t all pining and loneliness — ideally, there should be some benefit to being in one at all. Remind yourself of why you are happy being with this person and why you’re willing to put in all this energy.
3) Set a time limit.
You have to have a time limit. Otherwise, life is always going to look like this endless, indefinable stretch of time before you can be physically together again. If three weeks is making you this upset, the idea of “forever” isn’t going to keep you happy. Because that’s what it’s about, in the end. Being happy. 
Does dating him from afar for the next four years (at least!) make you happier than it upsets you? Only you can decide that, and you should reevaluate as frequently as you need — but if what’s holding you back is a fear of wasting time or being alone? Remember that there’s no shame in letting go of something that used to make you happy when it stops doing so. If you’re thinking you just need to hold out for four years and then you can be happy together again? You deserve to be happy right now.
Be happy,
Ruth

As someone who is in constant flux between days when I feel overwhelmed and incompetent and days when I feel in control and impossibly content, I wouldn’t necessarily say I’m qualified to give advice on how to survive (let alone thrive) at Carnegie Mellon. 
What I can say is I love it here, but it took some time to learn how. 
So, here are a few lessons that turned Carnegie Mellon from my school to my second home. Hopefully they help you feel the same.  
Find Your People
From classmates, to lab partners, to roommates, to the assortment of people you end up seeing at random parties, you will meet so many people at Carnegie Mellon. The key is to figure out which ones you really want to get to know. 
Find that person or group that makes you laugh, makes you excited, and makes you think. Find the other nerds that care as much as you do about the things you love. Take advantage of the strangers in your new classes, or start a conversation with that person you keep eavesdropping on. Be willing to reach out and push through the awkward first moments of introductory conversation for the chance that once the conversation gets started you won’t want it to end. It might take a while but eventually you’ll find them. 
Stay Close to Your People
When you do find your people, stick by them. It’s easy to make friends, but the further into the year we get the more difficult it becomes to find time to maintain them. Make an effort to hang out, to get lunch or grab coffee or just talk. And along with your new people, don’t forget the old ones. Basically, don’t forget to call your Mom. Or your best friend, or your brother, or whomever it is that means home to you. 
Stay Healthy
Eat vegetables. Not only are they good for you, but also they can taste really good!
Get sleep. Not minimal sleep, but maximum sleep. The kind of sleep that’s a 10- to 12-hour blackout. Because why compete for who can get the least amount of sleep when you could be the one who sleeps the most?
Drink water. 
Wash your hands and avoid all people that make the slightest coughing or sniffling sound. Invest in NyQuil, Vitamin C, and copious amounts of cough drops and tissues. 
Exercise. Do whatever you’re comfortable with, whether it’s walking on the track, going to a Group X class, riding a bike, or getting swole in the weight room. Consider using your daily Group X class to try something new like Zumba or kickboxing, and convince your friends to come with you so you can all laugh at each other. 
Stay Happy
Find a balance. Work hard and reward yourself. Don’t be afraid to ask for help. You have RA’s, advisors, friends, and organizations such as CAPS, the Center for Student Diversity and Inclusion and so many more that will always be there to support you. Don’t let labels get to you. You are not your major or your grades: you are so much more. Try to feed your passions by taking advantage of the places, experiences, and people Carnegie Mellon and Pittsburgh have to offer. Try getting off campus to eat, see a show, or visit a park or museum. Or just find a place on campus to soak up as much sun as possible while it’s still shining. Check out the mindfulness room if you’re looking to take a break or pet some puppies. 
Speaking of puppies, take advantage of all dog sightings. Seeing a dog (or the BXA cats) should be the first step in your journey to petting that animal and eventually rolling around on the ground with it. You will feel so much better after a dog gives you a slobbery smile.
And most importantly, don't judge your insides by other people's outsides.
What I mean is, you will have tough times. But so will everyone else. There will be moments when you find yourself comparing yourself to others or holding yourself to impossible standards. In those moments remind yourself that you are here for a reason, that you deserve to be here, that the tough times are worth it, and that in the end, everything is going to work out just fine.

With the superhero team-up of Daredevil, Jessica Jones, Luke Cage, and Iron Fist, Marvel’s Netflix universe has come full circle with The Defenders, a lean but occasionally bombastic eight episodes.
The Defenders brings together the characters and storylines of the four series to fight The Hand, a 100 percent evil ninja organization, led by Alexandra, played by the iconic Sigourney Weaver. 
While none of the previous series are required viewing, lingering threads from Iron Fist and the second season of Daredevil come to fruition here.
The first two episodes establish the characters in their own distinct worlds, and how they’ve changed and remained the same since the end of their respective shows. We see Matt Murdock (Charlie Cox) in the court room, winning a multi-million-dollar case but still struggling with giving up the vigilante life. Jessica Jones (Krysten Ritter) is still her typical self, putting whiskey in her morning coffee and leaving her apartment/office door unfixed. Luke Cage (Mike Colter) is out of prison, immediately having table sex with Claire (Rosario Dawson) and trying to save the people of Harlem. As for Danny Rand (Finn Jones), well… he’s off chasing The Hand, only to come back to New York and find that they’ve come to him.
One of the thematic characteristics of the Marvel/Netflix universe is the ambiguity of good and evil, the shades of gray of morality and heroism. In The Defenders, the line is clearly drawn between black and white. The Hand is merciless, deadly, and powerful. Their motto, “We serve life itself” is eerie, but it is also accurate. They choose the lives to preserve and the lives to end.
One of the reasons The Avengers was such a massive hit was the interesting dynamics of the very different characters. The Defenders uses the chemistry between the heroes to the show’s advantage. From Jessica’s sarcastic wit bringing out the lighter side of Matt to the pairing of Luke and Danny that seems so wrong that it’s right, everyone gets a moment to shine. Iron Fist is considered the first (and only) Marvel/Netflix misfire, but each episode of this series brings out the best side of Danny — the kid at heart who doesn’t have any social skills, the man-child who balances out Jessica’s cynicism and Matt’s reluctance to work together in the first place.
There are times during the eight episodes when I wished that the series was even shorter, because of slow pace and the inevitability of what happens next. We know that Matt, Jessica, Luke, and Danny will eventually team up. We know that they will fight The Hand for the future of New York. But perhaps that was the fault of binging all eight episodes in one sitting. When I went back to watch the individual episodes, I found myself appreciating the smaller moments, particularly the ones with the supporting characters like Claire, Colleen (Jessica Henwick), Karen (Deborah Ann Woll), Foggy (Elden Henson), Trish (Rachael Taylor), Misty (Simone Missick), and Stick (Scott Glenn). Some of these scenes may not have driven the plot forward, but they grounded a story that tackles a diabolical, mystical, ninja organization.
The action lives up to expectations. The sequence in the trailers — the company boardroom brawl — is everything audiences could’ve hoped for. We get to see Luke take ten rounds of gunfire, Danny obliterate a sword with his fist, Jessica’s blunt but effective fighting style, and the others’ confusion with Matt’s abilities. In later episodes, the fight choreography is sprinkled with some truly organic moments, but it soon became muddled with uninspired and repetitive martial arts moves. I found Iron Fist’s fight scenes to be messy and unoriginal, even though he is supposed to be the best fighter. His style wasn’t uniquely characterized like Daredevil’s, Jessica’s, or even Luke’s.
In the end, The Defenders is exactly what it’s supposed to be, nothing more, nothing less. There isn’t the deep exploration of abuse and PTSD like in Jessica Jones. There isn’t a multi-layered, nuanced portrayal of a villain like Daredevil’s Wilson Fisk or Luke Cage’s Cottonmouth. We get a great popcorn show, a well-acted, action-packed, funny, and above all, entertaining story of good versus evil. The Defenders won’t be winning any awards, but like the team, it gets the job done.

The terrain in the southern central Highlands of Iceland appeared both terrifyingly remote and otherworldly beautiful in all directions. The green and blue bodies of water glistened in the sun in hues unimaginable to the Monongahelan sensibilities of Pittsburghers like yours truly. Spread over the mountainous red, brown, and grey desolation, such watery pools and rivers provided a calm reminder of nature’s power in carving such voluminous expanse of rock — that and the lava fields and ubiquitous scattered volcanic remains that exhibited the natural history of how Iceland was formed. This was the place where the astronauts trained for the moon, but such notions might be conjured without knowledge of that trivia.
Driving for miles in my family’s specially equipped SUV rental on bumpy, narrow dirt roads in the middle of a nowhere called the Fjallabak Nature Reserve, I get the back-of-the-mind fear and thrill of wondering what could happen in such a godforsaken, almost anarchic place. I try imagining how life would have been for a supposedly historical mountain man and his wife who in the 1700s settled in the region and went through 30 years of absolute isolation until some other people managed to run into them again. Obviously their situation was much more harrowing than mine, cruising along on what was a warm day for Iceland when I went this past August, which means it was like a cool, spring day in the high Fahrenheit 50s or low 60s.
The few vestiges of civilization I came across in the Fjallabak area were structures belonging to off-limit hydroelectric or geothermal power stations that look like the secret hideout or works of a Bond movie villain. There were few other travelers on the road: just the occasional hearty hitchhiker and an apparently organized caravan of Jeep or Range Rover type vehicles that kicked up tremendous dust in its military-like pursuit of tourism. At the end of the nebulously long dirt road, we hoped, was supposedly Landmannalaugar, because if we were going to nowhere, it was better to at least end up at a named destination in nowhere rather than to end up in absolute nowhere without even the benefit of a stupendously tongue-tying Icelandic name to denote it.
After miles of twists and turns on the dirt road revealing one great view after another, around the bend suddenly appeared, well, a dirt parking lot. Where did all those cars come from? We certainly hadn’t come across that many on the long ride to Landmannalaugar. And really, what was this place in the middle of nowhere with an unpronounceable name? Hike over a hill from the parking lot and there it was: a base camp with the Icelandic flag waving high and proud above it. I breathed a sigh of relief for sweet, sweet government, no side-of-the-road serial killers or dying of exposure for me, thank you. In Iceland I was generally a bit glad to get away from any flag that inspires football players to kneel or that rednecks mythologize as representing the lost cause of their supposedly proud heritage, but there’s something to be said for the comfort of a national flag in the wilderness.
Landmannalaugar, however, was not just any base camp. The main attraction was that sitting in a valley surrounded by some of the most aesthetically diverse natural wonders of mountainous, volcanic terrain was a naturally occurring hot spring, safe for human entry. Although I hadn’t earned it remotely as much as the alluring European hikers that I encountered and by whom I felt mildly emasculated, I took a soothing dip in the mountain’s rejuvenating waters and wondered whether I had stumbled across what the Viking ancestors of the Icelandic people called Valhalla.
Iceland’s bizarre and gorgeous natural wonders were an undeniable highlight of my trip. Sitting atop a hill that overlooks Reykjavík, Iceland’s capital and main city, is the magnificent glass dome of the Perlan Museum, which serves as a testament to the conservation of Iceland. After a tour of an ice cave made from real pieces of Icelandic glacier that is housed in the museum, guests exit to a high-tech exhibit that depicts the melting of glaciers and the extreme threats that climate change poses to Iceland as an island nation. 
The emotional combination of viewing the wondrous ice cave and then being hit with the bleak, concrete facts on the climate filled me with a jolt of rage and shame at being an American living under the sociopathic Trump regime that has highlighted in a particularly egregious and overt way how the institutions of my country’s government and corporations have long been the biggest perpetrators of crimes against the environment. Once I was done viewing the environmental exhibit at Perlan, I walked up to a level that had an outside rotunda with breathtaking panoramic views of Reykjavík and the Icelandic coast. I hoped that in 200 years the place would not be totally under water. I had dinner at the lovely restaurant at the top of the Perlan and watched the sun set from quite a view.
The Icelandic people, who are one of the world’s most literate, are very conscious of environmental concerns and climate change being that they are on the frontlines of rising water and melting ice. With regard to climate threats, many Icelandic people tried the “Veganuary” challenge in January and have even turned to the diet full time being that the environmental costs of meat are much greater than those of plant-based diet production. The restaurant at the Perlan Museum and many restaurants in Iceland had vegan options, which, due to me being one, was quite desirable.
I would be remiss if I did not mention the music of Iceland. At the Reykjavík Record Shop and Lucky Records I perused the crates and snagged some obscure Icelandic pop/folk from the 60s and 70s alongside the “classics” of the Beatlesque Hljómar, the prog-rock of Trubrot, and the iconoclastic singer-songwriter Megas. On the way back to the airport in Keflavik, I stopped at the Icelandic Museum of Rock ‘N’ Roll and enjoyed the informative experience of the quirky little tourist trap that convincingly advocated Iceland’s place in the rock world.
Iceland was truly a majestic destination with its awesome nature and beautiful people. The trip made me think about the importance of preserving our environment and not allowing tourism to overrun the environmental, economic, and cultural capacities of small nations. Moreover, I appreciated the wonderful privilege of being able to travel in safety to such an incredible place as so many poor souls in the world are stuck or forced to flee.

This week, I decided to take a friend down to get a last taste of summer before the school year went into full swing. We decided to avoid the regulars on Walnut and take a turn onto Ellsworth Avenue to visit the Tipsy Cow.
The location: Ellsworth is a walkable distance from Walnut Street, and while it is a little out of the way, it has a quietness to it that makes sitting outside a delight. The temperature outside was perfect, and the music was just loud enough to hear and just soft enough for us to enjoy normal-toned conversation. The Tipsy Cow is the sister restaurant to Stack’d, a rowdy bar just off Walnut that’s a hybrid of a sports bar and college bar. Unlike Walnut, Ellsworth isn’t super packed, even on the weekends, which makes it great for people who want a Stack’d-like restaurant with a little more of a low-key feel.
Ellsworth also boasts restaurants like Harris Grill and The Elbow Room and bars like Element, which means it has a little life in the area that keeps it from feeling completely out of the way, and the crowd was new and fun to be around.
The drinks: Again, we’re going for the typical Stack’d vibe here, so drinks are priced pretty reasonably, and there’s a great selection for those who like their cocktails. For the summery vibe we were craving, my friend and I went for the Summer Red Sangria Pitcher and then a couple glasses of the Merlot. The joint also has a great selection of Mules. The Sangria itself wasn’t too sweet and wasn’t too potent, and a pitcher was definitely not too much for the two of us to finish. It had a nice aftertaste and warmed us up just enough to keep the chilled evening air from making us shiver.
The food is also great. You’ve got your typical build-your-own burger menu and finger foods to munch on with whatever drinks you end up getting, and, as far as I can tell, they’re pretty satisfactory.
The vibe: Low-key and very chill. The wait staff were incredibly laid back, and the bouncer kept a sharp eye out to ensure that anyone capable of causing a ruckus stayed out. Everyone present was snacking and taking it slow with their beverages, which kept the place from feeling a like a full-fledged bar. One of the waitresses had also brought her puppy to visit, and we had a great time playing with her outside while her owner was wrapping up for the night. I could definitely see myself vibing with the waiters if I came more often.
Lit or nah: I’m going to go with lit on this one. The experience that we were going for was exactly what we got, and the quality of service made the entire experience incredibly enjoyable. If you’re looking for a place where you can have conversations, grab a bite, and even just hang around, making the hike up to Ellsworth is definitely worth it. I will say, however, that The Tipsy Cow is definitely more a part of the restaurant scene than the bar scene in the area, so if you’re looking for a wild time, this is probably not the best place to make a pit stop.

Last summer, I was in the small town of Beaufort, North Carolina, studying marine biology at the Duke Marine Lab. The entire island that housed the Nicholas School of the Environment had a total of 40 people living on it at any given point of time, and all the students were living in “dorms”. These dorms were basically cabins, and at night things went pitch dark. It was like being in the middle of nowhere. I remember when a thunderstorm hit the island during the middle of the summer session. A few friends and I went out to the dock, and couldn’t see the mainland anywhere. The horizon disappeared, as did the bounds of reality.
It was in this environment that I decided to start reading Stephen King’s IT. I had read The Shining for a class the semester before, and was excited to start his next big novel. I love scary things. Scary movies, scary books, scary houses, the works. This book, however, beside being a brick, left a LOT to the imagination. Being in the middle of nowhere did not help the shadowy figures stay out of my mind. As a result, I only really made it through half the novel, and upon coming back to campus, never really had a chance to finish it.
I’m definitely a “read the book before watching the movie” kind of person, but when I heard of the remake coming out this September of the classic adaptation of the novel, I couldn’t have been more excited. So, naturally, when I saw that there was a pre-screening of the film being held at The Manor in Squirrel Hill the night before the official release, I couldn’t resist.
The film was, to say the least, tasteful. The novel jumps between parallel story lines, and having not seen the original film adaptation, I was scared that the movie would either be too long or too confusing. The writers, however, stuck to the earlier timeline of the novel to create a solid background for further iterations, and as a result crafted a film with strong child heroes and a truly terrifying villain. Most of the film stayed true to the plot elements of the novel, which may be why Stephen King gave the film his stamp of approval.
What was slightly bothersome was that many of the jump scares were revealed in the trailer. There was an air of ambiguity regarding the exact timing of each instance, but, nevertheless, it made the film more predictable. The CGI red balloons used in the film were also a bit visually unappealing but aided in crafting an eerie supernatural atmosphere. Pennywise (Bill Skarsgard), the villain, was a new kind of terrifying. Skarsgard’s portrayal of the clown had an edge of stoic enthusiasm that Tim Curry’s lacked in the original. Pennywise looked less sentient and more broken-down, which made him easier to despise.
Like in the novel, the inexplicably brave children were the perfect balance of goofy and mature. From the difficult to digest home-life of Beverley (Sophia Lillis) to Ritchie’s (Finn Wolfhard) loud mouth, the cast was an absolute delight to watch on-screen, and pulled the story along incredibly well. The film also boated some beautiful footage of summer in Derry, Maine, which gave a much-needed touch of childhood innocence to an otherwise dark film.
If you like horror movies and haven’t been satisfied by one in a while, I would recommend IT. The plot will pull you in and it’s got its share of shockers to keep you on the edge of your seat. Do beware though — you may have trouble looking at red balloons for a while.

As we all start to settle in for the new semester, aesthetes and culture-curious newbies alike might be wondering where to go to get their fix of art and entertainment. Pittsburgh, as you may have heard, is a city rich with music, theater, and the arts. Although it is not as big as an arts hub as New York or L.A., the low cost of living and rich history leads to a diverse and exciting art scene. Whether you are looking for activist exhibitions, underground music events, or beautiful gallery settings, there are tons of venues to explore in Pittsburgh. I am always learning about new ones, but here are just a few that I recommend. Follow these galleries on social media and look out for Carnegie Mellon School of Art events. Opening receptions and leisurely strolls through galleries will be your new (often free!) favorite thing to do on weekends.
Squirrel Hill/Oakland
Pittsburgh Center for the Arts
6300 Fifth Ave, Pittsburgh, PA 15232
Pittsburgh Center for the Arts (PCA) is a beautiful space. It’s a great example of the mix of pop up and well established art communities, in that it is a non-profit education and gallery space. In addition to summer camps and classes, it has a professional gallery space that hosts the local contemporary artists including faculty painter and multimedia artist Devan Shimoyama. Did I mention it’s a beautiful space? PCA consists of two mansions and a carriage house, which makes for a lovely viewing experience.
Ellis Gallery
Carnegie Mellon University
The Ellis Gallery is kind of an unintentional secret of the School of Art. Its location isn’t super ideal, in that it is a small room tucked around the corner from the men’s bathroom on the third floor of the College of Fine Arts building. With that said, it is the place that shows student work most frequently on campus, so if you are looking to keep up with what all the talented creators in our school are making it’s a good place to do so.
Miller Gallery 
Carnegie Mellon University
The Miller Gallery here at Carnegie Mellon is both conveniently located and a great space for the arts. You’ll see it as you walk along Purnell, just past Walking to the Sky. They host a variety of shows — mostly by professionals, but also student thesis shows — on art, architecture, and design. The work there is usually exciting and cutting edge because of its presence on the Carnegie Mellon campus. Look out for end of the year thesis shows from Carnegie Mellon students and for interdisciplinary exhibitions. Also, last year they hosted small music performances in the gallery space, which were definitely worth attending.
The Frame Gallery
Carnegie Mellon University
Located across the street from the Carnegie Mellon soccer fields and near The Hill, the Frame Gallery is another gem of Carnegie Mellon-owned art space. This gallery is entirely student run and it hosts several student artists each semester. Look for the neon sign as you walk down Forbes on the Thursday or Friday gallery openings to see what fellow students are creating. There’s serious talent at this school, and it’s always worth it to keep an eye out for what young people are creating. Also, opening nights the artists are almost always there, and student artists have a lot to say about their work, so ask questions!
Carnegie Museum of Art
4400 Forbes Ave, Pittsburgh, PA 15213
The Carnegie Museum of Art was founded in 1895 by Andrew Carnegie, and is now a beautiful museum near Schenley Park down Forbes Avenue, a short walk from campus. With free admission with your student ID and its connection with the Natural History Museum, it is definitely a must see. Although its collection is relatively small, it has a pretty thorough expanse of modern and classical art with rotating special exhibitions that are almost always very, very cool. They also do free special events like yoga or dance parties where you can observe Pittsburgh’s uber hip population congregating for a good time and overpriced drinks. Until the end of the semester they have a collaboration with The Studio Museum in Harlem called 20/20 which is a powerful show on racial politics and prejudice.
North Side
Mattress Factory
500 Sampsonia Way, Pittsburgh, PA 15212
The Mattress Factory is another space that has been converted to a stunning and quintessentially Pittsburgh gallery. Its goal is to encourage emerging artists and site-specific installations, the sight being a giant old factory building. With that said, both James Turrell and Yayoi Kusama have installations in the gallery (which you may see on just about everyone’s Instagram). Don’t miss out on the satellite galleries in buildings around the corner from the main building — Second Home, for instance, is an incredible installation that feels like a maze through an odd dollhouse. You have to book ahead for this one, as it fills up like crazy. This gallery is another must-see. It is really a one of a kind contemporary art space. Make a day of it, the neighborhood around the Mattress Factory also is pretty and has great food!
Randyland
1501 Arch St, Pittsburgh, PA 15212
Randyland is special. When people ask me why I love Pittsburgh, Randyland is what I think of. Randy, the artist and namesake of Randyland, is best described as a folk artist. He bought two houses several decades ago and converted them into what can only be described as a magical space. Promoting love, diversity, inclusion, and fun murals, signs from around 150 countries line the brightly colored landscape. It’s connected to the Mattress Factory, so you can see them in same day if you like. But make sure you get a selfie with Randy himself and get free hugs from the robot that hangs outside.
Downtown
Future Tenant
819 Penn Ave, Pittsburgh, PA, 15222
The Future Tenant gallery is located in a strip of galleries downtown, and it’s another gallery space supporting rising and student local artists. The gallery space is a reflection of Pittsburgh culture at large, working with ideas and concerns we collectively are wrestling with.
Andy Warhol Museum
17 Sandusky St, Pittsburgh, PA 15212
If you haven’t already heard, Andy Warhol went to Carnegie Mellon, albeit for just one semester. Also, we get free admission to the museum! It’s a beautiful space. Go to see the groundbreaking work in the Pop Art movement. It’s a sometimes over the top celebration of celebrity, capitalism, and wealth. Fun permanent installations include a room with floating silver balloons and a cloud couch. Although things like the $49.99 Warhol Barbies it sells seems like a terrifying shrine to consumerism, the special exhibitions are often very cool and powerful. Last year’s Firelei Baez’s exhibition, for instance, remains one of my favorite shows.
Wood Street Galleries
601 Wood St, Pittsburgh, PA 15222
The Wood Street Galleries are special. They’re located right above the Wood Street light rail station and are home to multi-disciplinary and new media installations by artists from international and local artists. Funded by the Pittsburgh Cultural Trust, the space is unique and tucked away in a way in the heart of downtown. Keep an eye out for upcoming exhibitions, it’s frankly one of the coolest spaces in Pittsburgh.
SPACE
812 Liberty Ave, Pittsburgh, PA 15222
One of the galleries downtown, SPACE is another community-oriented exhibition space. Working with multiple disciplines and local artists, it’s a place to find interesting new pieces and emerging artists.
Southside
Silver Eye Center for Photography
4808 Penn Ave, Pittsburgh, PA 15224
This is a gallery dedicated to photography, as you might gather from the title. I personally believe it’s important for everyone to understand the power of images, especially in the social media era, and the best way to do it is to start going to see the work of professional photographers and the way they put forth a narrative. The current exhibitions are The Notion of Genesis, which tells the story of the North Braddock neighborhood and On the Making of Steel Genesis: Sandra Gould Ford, which details the life of a groundbreaking artist of color from Pittsburgh.
Garfield/Bloomfield
Mr. Roboto
5106 Penn Ave, Pittsburgh, PA 15224
The Mr. Roboto Project is known as one of the hotspots for local artists and the DIY community in Pittsburgh. It is run as an art cooperative, and declares itself a “safer space” and a place to combat hate and bigotry. Look out for art exhibitions and music performances here!
Assemble
4824 Penn Ave, Pittsburgh, PA 15224
Assemble is a community oriented gallery space that focuses especially on connecting creators with youth. It’s a nonprofit working to promote creativity and learning through exhibitions, talkbacks, and workshops. These community oriented spaces in the art world are so important so, if you can, check it out!
Artisan
5001 Penn Ave, Pittsburgh, PA 15224
Artisan is a coffee shop, tattoo parlor, and art gallery all in one. Grab some coffee, see some art, ink some art onto your body. Sounds like a delightfully hipster day.
Boom Concepts
5139 Penn Ave, Pittsburgh, PA 15224
Boom Concepts is a community focused space working to move beyond simply being a gallery. In addition to being a space for music and arts, it hosts classes in wellness, finances, and other workshops targeted at helping the community. Boom Concepts collaborates with local organizations, as well us people here at Carnegie Mellon. It’s really easy to get stuck in the bubble of college campuses when you’re here in school, and this may be one really cool way to be more immersed in the Pittsburgh community at large.
Irma Freeman Center for Imagination
5006 Penn Ave, Pittsburgh, PA 15224
Part of the Penn Avenue strip of galleries, the Irma Freeman Center for Imagination is all about green energy, diversity, and creativity. It’s big on working between arts and STEM fields. If you’re at Carnegie Mellon that’s most likely your jam.
Point Breeze/North Braddock
Mine Factory
201 N Braddock Ave, Pittsburgh, PA 15208
Even though Carnegie Mellon feels like the place for all things tech and growth, it is hard to spend any time it Pittsburgh without feeling the industrial history of this city. The Mine Factory is an interesting space that kind of exemplifies this place in its history, in that it is literally a factory that was converted into cultural space. Studio and exhibitions spaces open to local artists mean that the shows work to reflect the diversity of the community. It’s also right across from a food cooperative, so it’s fun to make a day of.
The Frick Collection
7227 Reynolds St, Pittsburgh, PA 15208
The Frick is a more formal space, as it’s a mansion converted into a museum. This is another museum created by a wealthy industrialist family, in this case Helen Clay Frick. If you like art history (or would like to learn more about it!), it’s beautiful and a good thing to check out. They also have lectures and special exhibitions in addition to their permanent collection.

With three new restaurants on campus this fall and several new additions to existing menus, Dining Services is moving forward with a focus on health and wellness, and is expanding the range of dietary options at Carnegie Mellon University.
In an interview with The Tartan, Mandi Semple, Director of Marketing for Student Affairs, highlighted the goals that have driven these new dining choices. “Healthy options and international cuisine are the main themes for Dining Services as we go into this new year,” said Semple.
One of the new options is Nourish, Carnegie Mellon’s first allergen-friendly kitchen, which offers meals prepared without gluten, wheat, milk, egg, soy, fish, shellfish, peanuts, and most tree nuts (except coconut).
“It’s been a goal of our program to open such a kitchen for a few years now, after collaborating with students, faculty, and staff who have a need for allergen-friendly cuisine,” said Pascal Petter, Director of Dining Services. “We hope that this facility satisfies that need around campus.”
Menu items from Nourish can be customized and ordered for pick-up through GET, the university’s online and mobile food ordering service. Pre-packaged items from Nourish are also available at grab-and-go locations throughout campus, such as Entropy+ and Maggie Murph Café.
In Resnik House, another new dining choice available is Garden Bistro, Carnegie Mellon’s first 100 percent plant-forward vegan menu. “A community that has been very vocal with me has been our plant-based eaters. We wanted to create locations that really cater to those students and community members,” said Jessica Tones, Dining Services’ Registered Dietitian, Nutrition Educator, and Marketing Coordinator.
Garden Bistro’s menu includes sandwiches and build-your-own sauté bowls, with many different choices of vegetables and beans, plant-based proteins, and meat alternatives to create a personalized bowl.
Other health-based changes on various existing menus include new smoothies and breakfast bowls at Carnegie Mellon Café, which are made from several “superfoods” such as chia seeds, quinoa, dates, and kale. Also new this fall are superfood bowls at Evgefstos, which can be customized at lunch.
Carnegie Mellon has an extremely diverse and international community, which has motivated Dining Services to implement a wider variety of cuisines in campus dining. Some returning students may have noticed that Tartan Express has been revamped with a completely new menu. As a result of a Request for Proposal (RFP) process on campus, Dining Services has switched the concept of the popular food truck parked outside the Cohon University Center. It now serves Roti Wraps, a fast, fresh, and flavorful twist on Indian food.
Although the items from last year’s Tartan Express menu can be purchased at iNoodle in Newell-Simon Hall, a new, ramen-only restaurant is now open in the Cohon Center Marketplace: Ramen Bowl. The menu includes tofu, chicken, and pork noodle soups, and allows students to create their own ramen with toppings like scallions, bok choy, and house-made kimchi.
The Pomegranate at Tartan’s Pavilion in Resnik House is now certified Orthodox Kosher, supervised by the Vaad of Pittsburgh. To achieve this, Dining Services partnered with the Chabad of Carnegie Mellon University and the Hillel Jewish University Center of Pittsburgh. This expansion of kosher options has been in the works for the last few years, and Dining Services is excited that the project has come to fruition this semester.
The many new restaurants and menu revisions follow the strategic plan set by Carnegie Mellon for a campus-wide focus on holistic health and wellness. Petter believes that by developing traditional dining spaces that are interactive, social, and healthy, Dining Services is doing its part for promoting a better environment and community.
In addition to these changes, Dining Services is also continuing Andy Eats, which was launched last year. Andy Eats consists of campus dining events and awards, which are held throughout the year. This year’s first competition will be held during the Taste of the Tartans event, on Tuesday, Sept. 26, where students, faculty, and staff are welcome to sample food from dining vendors and vote on their favorites.
Dining Services has plans in the coming years to continue the expansion of healthy and diverse dining options. “I hope that our community continues to share with us what other dining options they want to see and how we can continue to improve,” said Tones. “We know we still have lots of work to do, however we are focused on making our program best-in-class.”

This fall, Carnegie Mellon University named Scott Dodelson as the new head of the Department of Physics.
Dodelson, a distinguished scientist from the Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory (Fermilab), specializes in particle physics and cosmology and conducts research examining dark matter, dark energy, inflation, and cosmological neutrinos. He was also previously a professor in the Department of Astronomy and Astrophysics at the University of Chicago.
Currently, Dodelson serves as the co-chair of the Science Committee for the Dark Energy Survey (DES), an international collaboration that maps hundreds of millions of galaxies, detects thousands of supernovae, and find patterns of cosmic structure in an attempt to reveal the nature of dark energy. He also works with the South Pole Telescope and the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope to gain a better understanding of inflation, dark energy, and neutrinos.
At Carnegie Mellon, Dodelson is enthusiastic to add to the work already accomplished by the Department of Physics, such as the work being done to conduct cosmological surveys by the department’s McWilliams Center for Cosmology.
“Within the McWilliams Center, I found kindred spirits in the faculty who are leading scientific projects aimed at understanding the universe, but I was equally attracted to the department’s strong groups in biological physics, condensed matter, and nuclear and particle physics,” Dodelson said in a university press release. “I’m excited to learn about these diverse fields and connect with other departments throughout the university.”
Dodelson added that he was also attracted to the university’s enthusiasm for foundation research and has plans for the Department of Physics to collaborate with and spread this excitement to other communities such as other departments in the Mellon College of Science, other universities, and through international research initiatives.
Dodelson succeeds Stephen Garoff, a Carnegie Mellon Professor of Physics, Chemical Engineering, Material Science and Engineering, and head of the Department of Physics from 2013 to 2017.

President Donald Trump decided to end the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, known as DACA, this past week, making the announcement through his Attorney General, Jeff Sessions, thus fulfilling one of many campaign promises. The president left a six-month window before officially ending the protections from deportation the program affords and allowed holders of work permits through DACA that expire through March 5 of next year to renew them before Oct. 5.
DACA was created by President Barack Obama in 2012 via an executive order because of Congress’ persistent inaction on immigration reform. The program allowed undocumented people under 31 years old in 2012 who came to the U.S. as minors (usually brought by parents) and who met certain criteria — like being a high school graduate or being enrolled in school and not committing a crime — to come out of the shadows and apply for work permits and other benefits without fear of immediate deportation. It did not, however, provide a path to citizenship for these young people, commonly known as “Dreamers.”
The rationale was that it was cruel to deport these young people, who did not come here of their own volition, away from the only home many of them have ever known.
While the administration has stated that Dreamers are not the primary deportation targets, it has not lessened the worries of Dreamers and immigration advocates because of the hardline stance against illegal immigration that the president has taken in the past.
Because DACA was created via an executive order and addressed a controversial topic, it became a lightning rod for criticism from many on the right, even from some who agree with the premise of the program. Aside from the premise, many of them believe that President Obama overstepped executive authority in passing immigration reform without Congress.
On the other hand, President Trump’s decision to end the DACA program has also become a lightning rod for criticism from Democrats and some Republicans, many of whom called out the decision as inhumane, contrary to our values, and a move that uses vulnerable young people as pieces in a political game. It prompted hashtags online such as #DefendDACA and #HereToStay, as well as several rallies and protests in front of the White House and in different cities across the nation.
President Trump’s announcement has prompted many college presidents, politicians, and business leaders to release statements in support of Dreamers, and Carnegie Mellon was no exception. Acting Carnegie Mellon president Farnam Jahanian joined these other leaders and released an open letter urging Congress to “act quickly to find a solution for the children and young adults whose futures are in jeopardy.”
While Carnegie Mellon has a fairly low population of DACA students, Jahanian called the ending of DACA, an action that could “deny even one of our students a Carnegie Mellon education and membership in our community”, a “deeply distressing” thought. He described Dreamers as a population with “so much to offer” whose potential deportation “is morally troubling to all of us” in the campus community.
“So let us take this occasion to restate: A diverse and inclusive community is the foundation for excellence in learning, research, creativity and human development,” Jahanian writes in the statement.
He goes on to detail the commitments the university has previously made in regards to immigrants. First, the university does not discriminate based on immigration status. Second, University Police will not ask about immigration status in routine policing. Third, Carnegie Mellon will not provide information on students’ immigration status to federal agencies or other third parties unless it is legally required to do so. Fourth, the school will provide legal counsel to help students understand their obligations should federal agencies need to contact them. Jahanian also refers students to Linda Gentile if they need to inquire more information about their own statuses.
“We will do all within our power to help ensure every student can finish their [Carnegie Mellon University] degree,” he states.
He promises more updates on the website for the International Office of International Education and held a question and answer session this past Thursday, Sept. 7.
He concludes by reaffirming the school’s commitment to its students, including those who are DACA recipients. “As a community, we stand united and determined to support DACA students and members of our community from all walks of life, across the globe,” he writes.

On Sept. 1, the Carnegie Mellon University School of Drama held the event Stand Up to Hate, an inclusivity forum intended to gather students and faculty together to discuss both recent events and systemic problems related to race, xenophobia, and hostility.
In recent years, Carnegie Mellon has become an increasingly proactive and driven institution in addressing social justice issues, spanning disciplines and generations. The School of Drama has been no exception to this initiative — for good reason. A quick survey of the room revealed the wide range of races, all concerned and eager to raise the discussion and contribute to the conversation on the changing landscape of American values and beliefs. Some students were seen lined up nearby the podium, ready to present their own personal takes on the conversation.
Peter Cooke, the Head of the School of Drama, was first at the podium and kicked off the event with a welcome statement and opening remarks. Quickly moving to address the Charlottesville protest that occurred a few weeks ago, he emphasized the university’s stance on the Unite the Right group that led the rally. Cooke stated, “I want you to feel very confidently that the management in this university reject utterly what’s happened in Charlottesville.” The message is clear, and his speech condemning the rally played into a larger statement of grievances of the actions of hate that have occurred around the world. He offered condolences to individuals affected by the terrorist attack in Barcelona, and sympathy for those affected by Hurricane Harvey, a Category 4 storm that tore through South Texas and left at least 70 dead.
But the event was not intended to solely grieve for the recent tragedies. The agenda quickly moved forward for action items, as Cooke asked, “What can we do?” He brought forward the Diversity and Inclusion Committee, a group within the School of Drama which has been “a proactive force” and will be “helpful across a whole lot of platforms.” Its initiatives are to: continue efforts to diversify across department levels, diversify within the season, and keep improving health and safety of the community as a whole.
Extending the expressed commitment of diversity, Cooke repeated that, “there’s not a decision made that does not think about the inclusion and diversity” of that decision. He continued to state that increasing representation in every area is of constant concern. His speech ended with an encouraging message to, “be good to people. Do something every day that is good.”
Talented students showcased their personal concerns about these subjects through their creative channels. Timiki Salinas, a senior majoring in musical theater, performed a reading of Maya Angelou’s poem “On the Pulse of Morning.” Javier Spivey, a junior majoring in Music Theater, performed his own ironically-titled composition of the spoken word piece/song, “Thank you Letter to the KKK.” Patrick O’Shea, a first-year Drama major, talked about a mural on the Community Chalkboard in Charlottesville, Virginia he completed after the attack on the Charlottesville counter-rally.
Every student had a powerful reason as to why they chose their piece to perform. We spoke briefly with Spivey, whose performance received a standing ovation and resounding acclaim after the event. His thoughtfulness about his heritage runs all the way to his social media handles, which are all under his penname LH Gonzalez which pays homage to the Afro and Latino parts of his family, particularly to Leonard Henry Spivey, his grandfather, and his mother, whose maiden name is Gonzalez. When asked about what someone should do to change the tide of hate, Spivey stressed encouraging everyone, when they hear any form of racial aggression, to speak up right then and there. Even if it is a small circumstance that doesn’t sound quite right, and even though you can’t realistically affect the nation, anyone who speaks up can do something that affects their municipal community. Lastly, he asks people to be brave and to not get scared. “If Trump can be president, you can raise your voice.”

This past Tuesday, Donald Trump’s administration announced the end of Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA). This  Obama-era executive order was created in 2012 to allow people brought into the United States illegally as children to remain in the country so long as they arrived before 2007, were under 16 and in school, and had no serious criminal backgrounds.
DACA was the result of Congress and President Obama’s failure to agree upon passing the Development, Relief, and Education for Alien Minors (DREAM) Act, which would have offered those who qualified for DACA the ability to gain permanent legal residency. This led to the term “DREAMers” which stuck for DACA recipients as well. Around 800,000 people have applied since its inception, with a 200,000 person spike since Trump's presidency began. 
Several protests have broken out across the country following Attorney General Jeff Sessions’ announcement regarding the change. Colleges, including Carnegie Mellon, have strongly urged Congress to find a solution, with the University of California (UC) going as far as to sue the Trump administration “for wrongly and unconstitutionally violating the rights of the University and its students.” UC has a large undocumented population with many Dreamers that could be greatly affected by the repeal of DACA.
Trump’s repeal of DACA, while upsetting, doesn’t really come as a surprise to those who know his immigration stance. Sessions called “an unconstitutional exercise of authority by the Executive Branch.” Only permits set to expire before March 5, 2018 will be eligible to renew their status, leaving many others stranded with no real solution.
With the decision to cut DACA looming in the horizon, Congress has six months to solve the issue before the government stops issuing permits. Time sensitive ultimatums between the executive and legislative branches are often stressful, and with the left and right more divided now than seemingly ever, many Dreamers could be facing deportation.
This is not the first time a U.S. president has left Congress in a time crunch to act. Back in 2013 the government was shut down after Congress failed to pass a budget because of Obamacare. Many government workers were either furloughed or asked to work without pay. For 16 days, the country was left in a standstill as we waited for Congress to finally pass a budget. Congress’ solution to the shutdown however was only an extension, suspending the debt limit until Feb. 7, 2014.
Another instance of Congress’ response to the pressures of time is the most recent attempted repeal and replacement of Obamacare. With a dramatic vote this past summer to pass a replacement, Republicans can’t seem to find a solution for the bill that, according to Trump, should just be left to die. As Republicans try to take a stand and make their distaste for Obamacare clear, the healthcare of millions of Americans has been put on the backburner, leaving them to suffer.
This repeated history of Congressional inaction makes the fate of DACA much more serious. Will a solution be found, or will it just be phased out, leaving hundreds of thousands of people with an uncertain future? It is not fair for a population of people who didn’t choose to come here to be left in the dark about their future. Congress has been playing a game of gridlock, and the losers are once again the American population.
Failure to replace DACA could cause a significant number of working employees to lose their jobs, and there’s no telling how the loss of this large population of Americans could impact companies all over the country. DACA recipients would also lose their ability to obtain drivers licenses and in-state tuition to public colleges. An entire talented and able population would be removed from the job population, and it is not certain if companies will be able to fill their void.
Without DACA, we’re punishing people for a decision they didn’t make. The act allows people to make the best out of a situation they have no control over, and with Congress’ current track record, Dreamers could be left without any reasonable options.
The time for Congress to act is now. DACA didn’t somehow create a population of criminals like Trump makes immigrants out to be — rather, it created a talented population of people brought to the U.S. for a better life. Do not let it end without something in place to protect those affected. The precedent of Congressional inaction needs to end before countless people who have called America their home since childhood are put more at risk of being sent away. We as a people can’t constantly be left wondering if our own government will let us fail, the same way it lets legislation like DACA.

Unifying our campus community is one mission inspiring concerned students of color at Carnegie Mellon to take action against racism. Last October in The Tartan, students stressed the importance of faculty engagement and expressed disappointment in the lack of support and compassion on issues regarding racial justice. While some faculty members actively challenged systemic racism, marginalization, and discrimination across the university, students called on other members of the faculty and administration to help create an academically honest and equitable environment for Carnegie Mellon University’s students of color.
Nationally, the horrendous events in Charlottesville are an-other stark reminder that we must condemn hate, racism, anti-Semitism, and discrimination that exists on college campuses. As such, we stand by Student Government’s statement to support one another. Hate must never be tolerated. Beyond this, we call on the entire Carnegie Mellon community to recognize and counteract implicit biases in our everyday actions that drive larger systemic inequalities experienced on campus and across the country.
In spite of the fallout following recent social and political events, we can look to our own leaders and peers to see who stands strong when the foundations of our society are shaken. We commend Acting President Farnam Jahanian, Vice President of Student Affairs and Dean of Students Gina Casalegno, and Vice Provost for Education Amy Burkert for their unwavering student support, attendance at our rallies and forums, and roles in developing the new Center for Student Diversity and Inclusion. From the Fence to the Point, we Carnegie Mellon University students, along with faculty and staff, stood together against racism and discrimination on and off campus. We stood with our University of Pittsburgh colleagues against the federal immigration ban. We stood with the greater Pittsburgh community in a city-wide Summit Against Racism, and marched with the country at the International Women’s March in Washington, D.C. Our collective actions clearly show that individuals at every level of our community can unite to support each other and make a positive societal impact, both locally and globally.
Taking a look back to last year’s call to action, Carnegie Mellon University has engaged in crucial conversations and efforts to combat social injustice and promote inclusivity. CIT, Dietrich, and Tepper followed CFA’s model and all held deliberative discussions about systemic racism. “Racism Is Real” lectures shed light on the consequences and possible solutions to the problem of discrimination in higher education. Looking to Carnegie Mellon’s future, addressing disparities in the representation of scholars of color between our student body and faculty is paramount. Moreover, those continuing efforts must be intersectional in order to meet the needs of students with diverse personal and educational backgrounds and identities.
Every single person at Carnegie Mellon University can contribute to an inclusive, unified, and compassionate community and culture. Each member of Call to Action deeply believes in this vision. As allies, we aim to amplify the voices of underrepresented and underserved individuals and groups at Carnegie Mellon. We seek to raise awareness about the myriad social injustices that many of us face. As advocates, we seek to educate others about injustice through our events and programming. We will protest to bring about social justice, equity, and positive change. Regardless of where you are from and when you set foot on campus, we call on you to join us in that work.
— Call to Action and the Black Graduate Student Organization Executive Board

There may be no place on the internet more representative of the sentiment of Carnegie Mellon University students than Carnegie Mellon Memes for Spicy Teens. The Facebook Group consists of over 5000 members and countless jokes on various topics related to the Carnegie Mellon experience. A common theme throughout much of the group’s content in recent months has been mocking Dietrich College, the home of the humanities and social sciences at Carnegie Mellon. These memes often joke that Dietrich is not a “real college” and that the work done there is not as valuable as the work done at Carnegie Mellon’s science, engineering, and computer science colleges and schools.
While many of the sentiments expressed in this space are not meant to be taken seriously, there is likely still some anti-Dietrich sentiment among many science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) students at Carnegie Mellon. However, what these STEM students fail to recognize is that despite the college’s name, many students, faculty, and classes in the college of humanities and social sciences have as much or more to do with STEM than with the humanities and social sciences.
If the premise of the anti-Dietrich memes is that Dietrich College students and faculty ought to study STEM fields, then the students creating the memes have already largely won. In Dietrich College you will find very popular majors like Information Systems and Statistics. There are researchers applying computational methods to  neuroscience, English and history. You can take classes like Modeling Complex Systems and Technology and Policy of Cyber War. Even the Dean of Dietrich College, Richard Scheines, has courtesy appointments in the Machine Learning Department and Human-Computer Interaction Institute on top of being a philosopher. And it’s not just Dietrich faculty who blend STEM with the humanities and social sciences. Computer Science Professor Luis von Ahn now leads Duolingo, a company which exists at the intersection of computer science and language acquisition.
To be clear, traditional research and education in the humanities and social sciences are very challenging and valuable. But there are thousands of colleges doing only the traditional kind of humanities and social science work. It is okay if one liberal arts college takes a different path. More than that, it is great that Dietrich College specializes in interdisciplinary studies and plays to the strengths of the university in Computer Science and STEM in general.
So before mocking Dietrich College, understand that it has already been influenced by the pro-STEM environment of the university, and while the traditional humanities and social sciences are important, the “STEMification” of Dietrich College is actually a good thing.

What’s that? Taylor’s back? Watch out, because it looks like she’s on the war path — except it’s less like war, more like whine, and a whole lot like that teenage scene phase we all had in seventh grade (except that she’s 27).
Taylor Swift’s newest attempt to reinvent herself is in the form of her chart-topping single “Look What You Made Me Do” off of her latest album Reputation, which has yet to be released. Yet even though she may be singing a different song, she is still playing the same old victim-esque narrative that she just can’t seem to get away from. This time, however, she truly outdid herself by producing, despite the catchy beat, one of her worst songs yet — and even so, she’s still topping the charts. Ah, the beauty of fame, drama, and slightly manipulative marketing.
Do not be fooled by the bold, grungy lettering on the album cover — you need not look further than the actual song title to instantly find Taylor still slyly giving off victim vibes by effectively redirecting blame onto everyone but herself. While she does make a few jabs at herself throughout the song, which is refreshing for a change, there are not nearly enough of them and too many hidden references toward people who have wronged her to consider it a revolution against her old self as opposed to an angsty lamentation. Rather than asserting her own independent power, it lets her adversaries appear to continue to influence her path as an artist.
If she truly wants to revise her image and assert her dominance, she should focus on creating stronger music that resonates powerfully rather than relying on a music video amiss with glitz and glamour lacking any substance.
The music video accompanying her new song is impressively kitschy to the point that its kitschiness is catchy. I just wish the song was any good — without the visuals, the song doesn’t have a life of its own. Thirty-six out of seventy-one total lines of lyrics in her newest song are the same spoken, monotone, repeated phrase “look what you made me do” — a little ridiculous considering that’s over half of the song. A good video has a story, but there is no story to accompany the visuals. She is, it seems, falling into the trap of the contemporary trend of glitzy music videos lacking in substance: those that have a large budget but no direction that make us abandon any logic, suspend any thinking, and be subjected to a cacophony of images. This phenomenon is not specific to just Swift, however, but a lot of artists in the pop industry, where the trend has become to compete for novel and sexy images at the cost of not conveying anything meaningful and lasting.
I don’t see her as the powerful rebel being reborn at the end of the video commenting that her old self is dead. Instead, I see her losing herself in having coined so many personalities to attempt to please the crowd. Taylor Swift’s attempt to reject her previous image of the love-stricken girl-next-door has come at the cost of compromising her artistic integrity and losing her core and the very qualities that once made her unique and stand out when her music could once stand on its own. And on a final note, I’m still wondering — what did we make her do?

On August 27 at 8:51 AM, a man on a 61D bus allegedly photographed students riding the bus. One passenger asked if he was a photographer, to which the man replied that he “[didn’t] like what he [saw]” at Carnegie Mellon, which he claimed he attended in the 1960s. When other passengers intervened, the man claimed he would “send these [photographs] to Trump when [he got] off.” Although no charges have been made thus far, detectives and both Carnegie Mellon University Police and Port Authority Police have been made aware of the situation.
This man’s reaction to Carnegie Mellon today, coupled with the political environment that the White House has arguably sanctioned, calls us to once again ask ourselves: why does diversity scare us?
Disagreement over diversity, especially racial diversity, is a topic that we can never seem to overcome in America. Our country was built on the notion that all men are created equal, and the U.S. prides itself in being a massive melting pot of various people and cultures. Recently, topics from affirmative action to voter suppression laws to Trump’s decision to end DACA, the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, make us constantly cognizant of the diverse nature of this country — and those who might oppose it, whether that be through explicit opposition of diversity or supporting policies that would hinder diversity.
Diversity in the context of college campuses is not a new topic. Policies such as affirmative action have had their fair share of criticism, some from high school seniors rejected from their dream schools who claim that such a policy gives students a disadvantage from a facet of their life that they cannot control.
However, it is imperative for us to not shy away from a topic simply because it is controversial or because it has already been discussed. The current Trump administration  is seeking lawyers who are interested in working for “investigations and possible litigations related to intentional race-based discrimination in college and university admissions.” Furthermore, the removal of DACA would make higher education even less accessible for those who came to America as children, thus further reducing racial diversity in institutions of higher learning. Many powerful figures are making strides to end efforts for increasing diversity; still, many universities, especially top-tier schools, remain dedicated to expanding diversity.
Nobody can deny that the world in the 1960s is different than the world we live in today. With technological advances that might have been unimaginable 50 years ago globalization has been made significantly easier. Communicating with others regardless of geographic location has become more accessible. Today’s workforce requires people to be able to work with diverse groups of people, thus mandating people to be able to be respectful and considerate of other cultures, norms, and customs. Organizational behavior is increasingly important in the business world, and knowing how to work effectively in groups and teams is absolutely vital for the workforce. College should prepare students for whatever they wish to pursue after graduation, and if we cannot produce students who can work in diverse groups because we deprived students of such a necessary skill in the name of a desire for a white college student body, we would commit a great disservice to white students and an even greater one for non-white students who are not given the opportunity to pursue college experiences.
Additionally, the U.S has also seen vast societal changes between the 1960s and today. Although Brown vs. Board of Education had been passed in 1954, there was still a division between the quality of education whites and non-whites received, thus placing non-whites at a disadvantage. In 1960,just over 40 percent of whites completed at least a high school diploma, which heavily contrasts to the 20 percent of African-Americans with high school diplomas. Although the education level gap between whites and non-whites is still significant, it is clear that it is closing. Education should be accessible to those who are willing to pursue it regardless of ethnicity, and universities across the states have caught up on that notion.
Now, let’s approach racial diversity on a much more personal level: here at Carnegie Mellon. In the 60s, this university was noticeably different from the university we proudly call home today. Every year, the incoming freshman class surpasses that of the class before, and admissions become tougher. We have seen our acceptance rate decrease every year and there is an increase in both competitiveness and diversity. Of course, we are not arbitrarily selecting students merely based on ethnicity, despite criticisms of those who claim affirmative action is implementing a sense of "entitlement in blacks." Former president Subra Suresh made it a priority to encourage Carnegie Mellon to grow as a diverse community, which he recognized as a massive strength, and current interim president Farnam Jahanian continues this legacy by “reaffirm[ing] that diversity and inclusion have a singular place among the values of this university.”
“A diverse and inclusive community,” he states in his letter following the Charlottesville incident in August, “is the foundation for excellence in learning, research, creativity, and human development.”
More imperatively, each recipient of an acceptance letter receives it because of merit. To deny students of that because of a wish to revert back to white America would be a disgrace to America and a complete disservice for each student who had rightfully earned a place in this community. Excellence does not care about heritage: excellence is accomplished through hard work, passion, and fulfilling potential. This is a university with countless innovations, from soft robotics to well-known apps such as Duolingo and GroupMe.We continuously push the boundaries of technology and change the way this world functions, and without the help of diverse students who provide unique insights, creativity, and determination, we would not be the world’s top leaders.
Diversity is merely one of many facets that make Carnegie Mellon University such a special place for higher learning. Students from over a hundred countries put their hearts into their work both inside and outside the classroom. Just as Earth does not stay constant, neither does this university.
To all students who are racial minorities: you belong here.
