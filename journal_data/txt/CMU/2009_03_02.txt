The Carnegie Mellon women’s tennis team, ranked eighth in Division III, pulled off a stunning upset yesterday, defeating fifth-ranked Emory University 6–3 to claim first place at the ITA National Team Indoor Championship at Gustavus Adolphus College (Minn.).
The win topped off an incredible weekend of exciting victories for the Tartans and kept them undefeated at 9–0 in dual matches.
On Friday, the Tartans, ranked fifth in the tournament, kicked off the weekend by beating fourth-ranked Pomona-Pitzer (Calif.), 6–3. The doubles team of first-year Courtney Chin and sophomore Kelly Hart won its match, 8–2, setting the pace for the Tartans to sweep the doubles. After dropping a straight set victory at third singles, the Tartans won the match with two straight set victories at first and fourth singles. First-year Laura Chen won 6–3, 6–2, and Chin won 6–3, 6–1 to clinch the victory.
A Saturday semifinals matchup pitted Carnegie Mellon against heavily favored second-ranked Denison College (Ohio), but once again, the Tartans pulled off the upset in a thrilling 5–4 victory that came down the last match. The doubles team of sophomore Jennifer Chui and Amanda Wu gave the Tartans a 1–0 advantage with their 8–4 win at third doubles, but the Tartans dropped the other two doubles matches. However, Chen won her match, 6–3, 6–1, and Chin won her singles match, 6–1, 6–7, 6–3 to tie the score at 3. After the two teams exchanged points once more, first-year Cze-Ja Tam clinched the victory for the Tartans, defeating Denison’s Kara Zdanowski, 6–4, 2–6, 6–3.
That led to Sunday’s matchup against University Athletic Association rival Emory Eagles, ranked third in the tournament. The Tartans had never in their history defeated the Eagles, posing an even greater challenge. The doubles team of sophomore Ashley Herrick and Chen began with an 8–5 victory to claim the first point for Carnegie Mellon, defeating Emory’s Tshema Nash and Sabra Rogers, a doubles team that is ranked second in the nation. Chui and Wu won their doubles match as well before Hart and Chin won to complete the doubles domination. Chin then won her singles match 6–1, 6–3 for her third individual match win of the weekend before Wu clinched the match, getting the Tartans their fifth point with a 6–4, 6–1 victory against Emory’s Zahra Dawson. Tam won 7–5, 6–3 to get the Tartans their final point.
“We’ve worked hard all season and had nothing to lose, so this was a pretty exciting win,” Chin said. “We had some close matches, but in the end we pulled it out. Awesome!”
“We were very tough from the beginning to the end of the tournament,” Wu said. “When we go to California next week for spring break, the other teams have to watch out because this is a talented up-and-coming tennis team who will show everyone what we’re made of.” 
“The team fought so hard and stayed focused even when things weren’t going our way,” said coach Andrew Girard. “Our positive energy and enthusiasm was a main key to our success. It was a true team effort, every player on the team played an important role in winning our first national championship. I can’t say enough about how proud I am of how our young team handled themselves all weekend.”
The Tartans will travel to Claremont, Calif., for a series of five matches over spring break.

The Carnegie Mellon men’s basketball team traveled to upstate New York to wrap up its regular season play with a tight 59–50 victory over the Yellowjackets of the University of Rochester, heading back to Pittsburgh with an improved record of 19–6 overall and 9–5 in University Athletic Association play. The Tartans concluded the season third in the standings within the UAA conference and await their postseason fate later today.
If the Tartans do not make it through, Saturday will have been the final time seniors Terrance Bouldin-Johnson, Elliott Curtis, Ryan Einwag, Corey O’Rourke, Rob Pearson, and Jon Wolleben lace up their sneakers and throw on their Carnegie Mellon jerseys. The six seniors have contributed so much to the team’s success over the past four years, and their first year of collegiate play marked the greatest season in school history with appearances at the UAA Championship and a berth in the NCAA Division III Tournament. Last year, the seniors helped win the school’s first ever ECAC South Championship.
The seniors played an integral role in Saturday’s matchup, as a Bouldin-Johnson jumper opened up the scoring for the Tartans and started a  7–0 run. The team continued to edge on the Yellowjackets, but in the 14th minute, Rochester held on for a back-and-forth lead exchange with a jumper from Anderson and ended with Carnegie Mellon sealing its advantage at the break by nine. Einwag and junior Jack Anderson each contributed eight points to the scoreboard during the first half.
Carnegie Mellon dominated the second half, never relinquishing its lead, only increasing its edge over Rochester to as much as 12 points. In the middle of the period, the teams went back and forth between tallying points, but the Tartans still came out ahead regardless, with a jumper from Anderson and a three-pointer, followed by a jumper from Einwag. The Yellowjackets were unable to close the gap significantly and only came within five points of the Tartans in the last four minutes. With two free throws from first-year Matthew Pettit and three from O’Rourke, the Tartans closed out their final regular season game with a solid victory to surpass the hosting Rochester side with a nine-point edge. Carnegie Mellon shot 38.5 percent in comparison to Rochester’s 25 percent in the second half.
Einwag contributed 18 points and seven rebounds, Anderson chipped in 14 points, O’Rourke added 10 points and four assists, and Pettit grabbed eight rebounds and dropped in six points.
“I am very proud of our team’s accomplishments,” said head coach Tony Wingen. “We have gotten great leadership from our seniors and have improved throughout the season, and we are hopeful of making a long run in the postseason.”

The Carnegie Mellon women’s basketball team finished the season at the University of Rochester this past Saturday and fell to the Yellowjackets in a devastating 52–103 loss. This moves the team’s record to 5–20 overall and 0–14 in the University Athletic Association. The team graduates three seniors, Corey Innes, Stacie Aleski, and Colleen Light, who conclude their collegiate career in the last standing of the conference without a win against UAA competition for the past two years. Senior Rachelle Roll redshirted her sophomore year, so she will still be eligible for next season as she finishes up her architecture degree. Despite the dry spell, the seniors have played an integral role in shaping the program’s history and have prepared the underclassmen for future success.
The sixth-seeded Yellowjackets started with a 16–2 run as Johanna McNelis hit her first four attempts, including a three-pointer. On the other hand, Innes was the Tartans’ spark as she scored the first seven Tartan points. Roll then converted two straight three-point plays to bring the Tartans within 25–13 at the 11:48 mark of the first half. Rochester, however, hung on to its lead with its hot shooting. The Yellowjackets shot 50 percent from the floor, made nine three-pointers, and sank 20 of 24 free throws.
Innes led all scorers with a career-high 26 points as the Tartans’ main scorers Aleski and first-year Jacki Cortese sat out due to injury. McNelis led the Yellowjackets with 22 points, while Jodie Luther scored 17 and Alex Porter put in 11 and grabbed 13 boards for Rochhester.
Saturday’s game against Rochester was the final time Light and Innes will represent Carnegie Mellon on the basketball court, as Aleski finished her collegiate playing at Chicago last weekend before enduring an injury that kept her out of this past matchup.
Throughout her career as a Tartan, Innes has proven to be a contributor of both points and rebounds. She grabbed a career-high nine rebounds against New York University last season and scored a career-high 14 points twice in that same year.
Light has had a successful career over the past four years, as she started most of the games she played. She had a spectacular game against Thiel College (Pa.), scoring a career-high of 23 points and grabbing 10 rebounds last season.
Aleski has proven to be a great force for the Tartans, starting all 25 games in 2006–2007 and 2007–2008, and scored a career-high 29 points against Lynchburg College in the 2006–2007 season. She also grabbed a career-high eight rebounds in two games that same year, and dished out a career-high nine assists in another game. That year, she led the Tartans in assists and three-pointers made. Last season, Aleski continued to prove herself as she led the team in scoring, steals, field-goal percentage, and three-pointers made. She was also named second-team All-UAA.

Last swim season, junior Gates Winkler showed vast improvement, most notably dropping 10 seconds in his 500-yard freestyle and getting ninth place at the University Athletic Association championships after not making the meet the year before. This season, Winkler outdid himself, dropping 11 more seconds and getting second place at the UAAs with a time of 4:30.96, automatically qualifying him for the NCAA Championship this March.
The Tartan: Would you say there was anything different about this year than previous years to warrant such improvement? 
Winkler: I didn’t really do anything or train differently from previous seasons. I think that my improvement is just a natural following from the increasing intensity of the practices and our coaches’ continuing to push us. They keep working to make us better, and I think the entire team has improved because of it.
T: What is your favorite aspect of being on the swim team? 
W: I really like that it gives me a break from the rest of school and allows me to focus on something different. Being in the pool with the rest of the team is a great way to decompress after a hard day of class.
T: What are your plans after you get your degrees in electrical and computer engineering and technical writing? 
W: Probably graduate school, and I’m not sure what after that. I think I might like to look into some sort of job in the movie industry (the technical side, of course).
T: What is your favorite way to procrastinate? 
W: The usual — playing video games, watching TV. But always make sure you get your work done, kids!
T: What is your favorite event? What is your least favorite? 
W: I’m a big fan of the 500 free, just because I’ve been swimming it the longest, and I still feel like it’s sort of my specialty event. As for a least favorite event, I try to avoid anything that isn’t freestyle. The breaststroke or IM events are particularly unpleasant for me.
T: Do you have any idols, in the pool or out? 
W: I try to do my own thing, but there are people whose examples I try to follow. My fellow distancer, [Tartans teammate senior] Tom McConnell, sets a great example in terms of intensity and attitude about swimming. On the academic side, I try to be like my dad, who I’m convinced actually does know everything.
T: Do you plan to keep any connection with swimming or Tartan athletics after you graduate? 
W: I think I’ll probably keep swimming, at least on my own, after I graduate. And I’d like to be able to come back and visit the team.
T: Do you have any nicknames? 
W: During Homecoming my freshman year, one of the alums thought that I was a Swedish or Scandinavian foreign exchange student, so my nickname is Sven.
T: What is the air speed velocity of an unladen swallow? 
W: What, African or European?

At  Microsoft’s annual TechFest conference, where researchers from Microsoft Research (MSR) labs all over the world presented their ideas, the software giant clearly showed that it is committed to innovation. 
As one of the two student reporters invited to the event, I was able to experience the latest demos of the Microsoft Researchers as well as have a quick chat with the senior vice president of MSR, Rick Rashid.
Rashid completed his undergraduate studies at Stanford, majoring in comparative literature and math, and then taught as a professor of computer science at Carnegie Mellon.
Rashid described Microsoft Research as an institution that resembles an academic institution more than a commercial research lab. Thanks to the stability of Microsoft in its field, researchers at MSR are able to explore the field with a freedom usually found only in academic institutions. 
In the same vein, Rashid added that MSR works with more academic institutions than any other organization in the field, supports the largest number of fellowships, and publishes the highest number of papers. “[Compared to us] they publish next to nothing,” Rashid said of Google Research. He said that MSR publishes papers just like an academic institution would, rather than publishing papers with only commercial interests.
Rashid, in fact, pointed out that many of the key values at MSR are inspired from his years at Carnegie Mellon as a professor. 
One specific example he gave was the “reasonable person” principle, which gives the researchers virtually endless financial freedom to explore their ideas as long as they are reasonable people.
He added that the relative stability of Microsoft gives MSR a freedom that academic research institutions have not experienced since the ’80s, especially with regard to how research money is allocated.
When asked about the value of MSR to Microsoft at large, especially in light of the credit crisis and some shareholder concerns over investment returns, Rashid said, “Long-term survival of Microsoft relies on basic research.” The reservoir of technology and the bright minds are what will keep the company one step ahead of its competitors. He said many of Microsoft’s current products in such fields as multimedia, gaming, and natural language processing are results of research done at MSR.
The demos presented at TechFest added more credibility to Rashid’s words. One of the demos presented was called “Situated Interaction.” Developed by Eric Horvitz and Dan Bohus, who studied at Stanford and Carnegie Mellon, respectively, the project aimed to create a robot front-desk receptionist for Microsoft, similar to Carnegie Mellon’s own Tank, the receptionist located in Newell-Simon. In the demo, the receptionist was able to detect groups and individuals separately and engage in natural conversation.
The receptionist could understand when it was being talked to and could attend to other people waiting in line whenever the members of the main group it was interacting with were engaged in a conversation within themselves. 
The smooth integration of many different technologies, such as speech recognition, natural language processing, and interaction, was remarkable in this project.
Another presentation was called “SecondLight.” This project was somewhat based on the highly publicized “Surface” technology, which employs a multi-touch display that can support many inputs. In SecondLight, the researchers created a system in which images could be projected onto surfaces hanging in mid-air, right from the display underneath.
In a rather puzzling effect, the display essentially seemed to show one image and project another. The researchers achieved this feat by including a second projector underneath the screen that was switching on and off so fast the switch was imperceptible.
Another project, again developed by a Carnegie Mellon Ph.D., Mihai Bidiu, focused on automating monitoring tasks in the cloud computing systems. Cloud computing systems allow users to access information from a remote cluster. 
The researchers developed a proof-of-concept system that they hope will be implemented in future cloud computing systems to make monitoring of the systems a lot easier and cheaper.
Another project, code-named “Viveri,” was about creating a new user interface for search engines to help users find what they really want instead of bombarding users with search results. The project aggregates content from multiple search engines. Viveri changes the way information is presented based on interaction with the user. The research presented at TechFest, as many researchers at the event pointed out, stands as a testament to Microsoft’s commitment to innovation and pushing for state-of-the-art technology. Readers can check out many of the other cool demos from the TechFest website.

Getting nosebleed seats at the Penguins game won’t seem so bad with the recent launch of a new mobile video service known as the “Yinz Cam.” The Yinz Cam was developed by Priya Narasimhan, an assistant professor of electrical and computer engineering and computer science. The project, which was started about a year and a half ago, aims to bring free, live, close-up video footage from Penguins games to fans through Wi-Fi–enabled devices. It was launched at the Mellon Arena on Feb. 6. 
According to a Carnegie Mellon press release, Narasimhan included the project in her capstone course on embedded systems. The final result of the project was installed at Mellon Arena. The system works through a Wi-Fi network, which was installed by Narasimhan’s group inside the Arena. The network enables the Penguins to provide the system with feedback through cameras placed at various locations around the arena. The system then sends the feed to the fans’ Wi-Fi–enabled devices, including the iPhone, iPod Touch, Samsung Omnia, Nokia 95, Blackberry, and phones running Google Android.  Thus, the system enables users to obtain video footage from various camera angles around the stadium, such as near the goalie, the bench, and unique tight shots. 
Since their product launch, Narasimhan and her research group have been reviewing the feedback received from users. “We’ve gotten great feedback on our Facebook group,” Narasimhan said. “People have gotten very excited about it. We’ve even had fans start posting their own photographs of what they saw, which is really nice. It is really great to have a fan capture what they saw and post it.” The team plans to use this feedback to make further improvements in the system. In addition to providing live-action footage, the system also has many other features, such as On-Demand, which enables users to view video clips from previous or current games; player rosters, which provide player statistics; and schedules, which allow users to find out when the next game is. As an added bonus, the system also has two unique features known as “Restroom Cam” and “Food Cam,” which give the users information on how long the lines are at concessions stands and restrooms. 
The team had to overcome several challenges during the development of the Yinz Cam system. The Wi-Fi network needed to cover the entire arena and also needed to be able to handle up to 17,500 users. Security was also a concern, since content could not be taken out of the arena due to conflicts with broadcasting rights with the television networks airing the game. 
Despite the challenges, the team has had a lot of fun developing the system. “It has been a great learning experience to develop technology for a professional sports team, especially since I get to go watch Sidney Crosby play,” said Michael Chuang, a Ph.D. student in electrical and computer engineering. “For a sports fan, life doesn’t get better than this.” 
Approximately 100 people used the system during the first day of its release. Since then, the number of users has been increasing with every game. Narasimhan and her group are currently making efforts to advertise through their Facebook group as well as by handing out instructional brochures for using the system at the Penguins’ games. While the initial launch of the system has proven to be extremely successful, Narasimhan and her group are still making efforts to improve it by adding new features. Upon request of the users, the team is currently working on integrating audio into the system.
Narasimhan also hopes to make the system more dynamic by adding more social networking features, such as allowing users to provide their own feeds so others could view them.  “Right now you’re getting the feeds and you have access to it,” Narsimhan explained. “But wouldn’t it be great if you could see what that other guy in the front was seeing too?” She also has hopes that this kind of system could be used during campus events, such as commencement. 
For Narasimhan, the best part of the project is being able to work with such a great group of students. “I am very, very, very lucky to have these students,” she said. 
“They go in assuming nothing is impossible. They’re way smarter than I am and they know it. It’s the most amazing feeling to work with people like that.”

Aubrey de Grey, a  Cambridge, U.K.-based​ biogerontologist, visited Carnegie Mellon on Feb. 12th to give a talk, titled “Prospects for defeating aging altogether.” The lecture, sponsored by AB Lectures, centered around a collection of techniques he dubs Strategies for Engineered Negligible Senescence (SENS), which de Grey claims holds the promise for potentially limitless extension of life. “People like to characterize me as an immortalist,” reflected de Grey. “What I’m interested in doing is helping people from getting sick.” Life extension research is a controversial topic — partly because the National Institutes of Health (NIH) does not classify aging as a disease. According to Danith Ly, assistant Professor of Chemistry here at Carnegie Mellon, there is no known “aging regulon,” no molecule whose presence unequivocally means that aging is taking place.
According to de Grey, “Aging is, without a doubt, a side effect of being alive in the first place.” Metabolism, the complex series and cycles of processes involving chemical energy that define life, produces various types of damage. 
When enough damage accumulates, a large-scale problem surfaces, which is then called a disease. When considering strategies for the intervention of elderly-onset diseases, one might look to the study of metabolism. 
If it were understood how metabolism and, more specifically, its by-products, negatively impact individual cells, it would be possible to make therapies targeting those damaging pathways. Unfortunately, metabolism is not understood very well, and what is already known paints a complex picture. 
Since we have little hope of understanding metabolism, de Grey contends that we have much less of a chance at improving it. Another strategy, then, might be to investigate better treatments of the diseases associated with old age, the study of geriatrics. The problem is that “[treatment] gets harder as the patient gets older, because the precursors of the targets of the geriatric approach are continuing to accumulate.”
The hope of successful treatment dwindles as the patient ages. As de Grey claims, geriatrics is a short-term strategy, merely “slowing down the rate at which damage converts into pathology.” Metabolism is not understood well enough to be improved upon, and so it is not possible to prevent damage from occurring. The disease, resulting from large concentrations of damage, can only be reined in for a while — some time can be bought — before other problems stemming from the still-present damage become apparent. 
Given that it is difficult either to prevent the damage from occurring or to control the effects of damage, de Grey offers a third strategy: limit the damage. As long as damage is kept below a certain threshold, he claims, we can indefinitely postpone the corresponding disease, a process that de Grey calls “the engineering approach.” He claimed that all types of damage have been isolated and that there are only seven of them. For each of these types of damage, de Grey outlined treatments in various stages of development that hold the promise to moderate or negate the damage.
These treatments are what de Grey collectively refers to as SENS, which he opines may lead to “robust human rejuvenation,” the total circumvention of the aging process. The Methuselah Foundation, of which he is a co-founder, offers a cash prize to the research team that extends the life of the common laboratory mouse, Mus musculus. 
The ultimate motive of the prize is to develop techniques for robust mouse rejuvenation, which de Grey believes could be translated to human application within 10 years of discovery. His beliefs have stirred up passionate debate among biologists. In February 2005, the MIT Technology Review published “Do You Want to Live Forever?” In his article, Sherwin Nuland, a professor at Yale University’s School of Medicine, portrayed de Grey as a well-meaning scientist, but whose “grand design will almost certainly not succeed. Were it otherwise, he would surely destroy us in attempting to preserve us.” According to a piece written by Jason Pontin, then the editor-in-chief and publisher of Technology Review, in his blog, many readers of Technology Review were not satisfied with Nuland’s treatment of the topic. In response to the criticism, the publication issued the SENS Challenge, offering $20,000 to the team that could convincingly demonstrate the infeasibility of SENS to a panel of independent judges. No team was successful, and in “Is Defeating Aging Only a Dream?” — published in the Technology Review in July 2006 — the author related the opinion of the panel: “SENS is a collection of hypotheses that have mostly not been subjected to [the scientific] process and thus cannot rise to the level of being scientifically verified.... SENS exists in a middle ground of yet-to-be-tested ideas that some people may find intriguing but which others are free to doubt.” 
Regardless, there have been some indications that de Grey’s hypotheses may not be as far-fetched as is thought. Lysosomes are the waste disposal sites of the cell — if these are not working properly, then toxic waste builds up and damages the cell. In a study published in August 2008 in Nature Medicine, Cong Zhang and Ana Cuervo of Yeshiva University reported that liver function in rats can be maintained for longer when additional copies of certain genes related to the function of the liver cells’ lysosomes are introduced. 
By showing that the age-related dysfunction of a certain organ can be postponed, they give hope to the possibility that other gene therapies may be able to target the aging of other organs of the body. When asked what the common person could do to spur research on the aging problem, de Grey responded “evangelization.” 
According to de Grey, society is experiencing an “aging trance” — a hypnosis that has us bound to the idea that aging is inevitable and moreover a good thing, and that therefore we should not fund life extension research. He suggests that a younger, less entrenched audience may be able to change attitudes toward the inviolability of the aging process.

The year is 1918. The world is relieved, as the Spanish Flu epidemic has just ended. All of a sudden, thousands of cases around the world emerge with new, strange, and unsettling symptoms. The case, reported in the New York Herald Tribune, had the medical world extremely perplexed with no real explanation for the disorder. Soon after it was first encountered, the disease was named encephalitis lethargica, meaning an inflammation of the brain that causes lethargy, but it was commonly known as “sleeping sickness.”
The disease starts with a simple fever, a headache, and a sore throat. Almost reminiscent of the common cold, initially it seems as if it is nothing to worry about. However, within only hours, double vision and weakness set in. According to bbc.co.uk, later stages of the disease are characterized by bodily tremors, piercing pain, extreme restlessness, and abnormal body movements. The eyes are sometimes fixed in their extreme range of motion, locked in a blank gaze. As the disease progresses, the condition of patients only worsens, both physically and mentally. As their bodies gradually enter into a comatose state, they become more and more afflicted with hallucinations and other forms of psychosis. The Herald Tribune wrote that nearly a million people were afflicted with this illness when it first struck and almost half of those affected lost their lives. Many of those who survived remained in the same catatonic state, unmoving and unresponsive for years. There were only a handful of full recoveries, and for the rest of those who improved, most developed problems that would last for their entire lives, like vision problems, continued psychosis, or permanent temperament change.  
It was common for recovering patients to develop shaking symptoms similar to Parkinson’s disease and mental slowness. Around 10 years after the epidemic struck, it suddenly disappeared. Afflicted patients were left to live in institutions, as they had their intelligence and hearing, but could not respond to external stimuli. They were simply normal minds trapped in a paralyzed body. The cause of encephalitis lethargica is still unknown, but research is being continually carried out. A common thread has been found between modern cases and historical cases: Patients usually complained of a sore throat before the disease became severe. 
As explained on bbc.co.uk, researchers hypothesized that a type of bacteria that causes sore throat symptoms may be the cause, and it is the body’s overreaction to the bacteria that causes the immune system to destroy neurons in the brain. While further evidence supporting this theory exists, such as the presence of antibodies that attack the brain in patients, many scientists still believe a virus causes the disease, as the bacteria explanation, while plausible, is far from being proven. Encephalitis lethargica, while one of the uncanniest diseases to appear in history, has gone largely unnoticed by the general public. 
In 1990, the movie  Awakenings, based on the book by the same name written by Dr. Oliver Sacks, was released, tellingthe story of Sacks and his groundbreaking research in encephalitis lethargica patients. His insight was the use of L-Dopa, a drug used for Parkinson’s disease, to cure patients who were in a catatonic state. 
Response to the drug was remarkably rapid; many made full recoveries. Unfortunately, it was also short lived; as the patients began to fall back into their original state, they became more and more agitated and less in control of their bodies. Dosages of L-Dopa were increased, but after a certain point, the amount of L-Dopa had no effect on the patients. Since then, no effective cure has been found. Treatments involve stabilizing patients during the onset of the disease, and administering steroids. 
However, none of these are fully effective on every patient. While this disease is extremely rare, research is still being conducted and may lead to insight on how the brain is structured and eventually a cure for this destructive disorder.

OpenCL is an emerging standard for taking advantage of the varied processors available on most computers today. This can be seen as a product of efforts being undertaken, particularly by scientists working with large datasets, to leverage the common PC for difficult calculations.
Gamers are one reason that PCs have so much computational power today. The task of providing millions of high-precision, shaded pixels to the screen tens of times per second is challenging to any hardware, particularly the CPU, which historically operates on one piece of data at a time. Specialized pieces of hardware called video cards were developed to meet this processing need. The appetite for realism has driven development of video cards’ capabilities and gross computing power, and now they can be viewed as processors streamlined to handle large volumes of data easily. The result is that in all desktops and most laptops on the market, there are two or more high-performance processors available, which are optimized for different kinds of work. For example, the CPU is designed for general purposes and system management. The modern video card, or GPU as it is sometimes called, is designed to perform a large number of high-precision calculations at a time. These devices have completely different interfaces: It is not possible today to write a piece of code that will run on either device. 
OpenCL is able to harness all of the processors in a system, both general and specialized, in a way that lets the programmer abstract away from the specifics of the hardware. So now code can be written that will execute on whatever processor is available. The structure of an OpenCL task is a chunk of data paired with a piece of code written in a low-level but portable language. The code is applied to every datum, and this occurs in parallel to whatever degree possible. In scheduling tasks, the platform views the host as a collection of computing devices, each with certain capabilities (such as high parallelism) and limitations (such as precision). For example, the CPU is not as good as the GPU at doing a lot of floating–point operations quickly, but it can usually access a much larger amount of memory than the GPU. At run time, OpenCL decides according to capabilities and availability how to split up a task over the available computing devices, scheduling a segment of the task to each device. 
As an example, we will consider an n-body simulation — tracking the position of n physical bodies according to the gravitational forces they exert on each other. One implementation may, for each time step t, store in a separate data structure each body’s new position and velocity (as a function of the gravitational constant, the current position and velocity of the body, the position of every other body, and the amount of time elapsed), and then copy over.  This is very amenable to parallelization — in fact, the update to a body’s position and velocity can be computed independently of all other updates for each time step. 
The equivalent in OpenCL may proceed in this manner: First, a list is created containing the position information of each body. A kernel, which is responsible for managing communication between hardware and software, uses this to compute the distance between all possible pairs of bodies. Then, another list loads containing the mass of each body. The kernel uses the list of masses with the distances between each pair computed earlier to calculate the force exerted on any of the bodies by any of the other bodies. Fianlly, the kernel uses the position, mass, volocity, and force information to find the new position of each body at the next time step. 
Further details of how OpenCL is used can be found in Aaftab Munshi’s presentation “OpenCL: Parallel Computing on the GPU and CPU,” given at SIGGRAPH 2008, a popular conference for computer graphics research (http://s08.idav.ucdavis.edu/munshi-opencl.pdf.)
The upshot of all this is that when you have a data-intensive problem that would benefit greatly from parallelism, OpenCL aims to provide a way to write a solution that will run on whatever parallel computing resources are available on the machine.

Anti-social children prone to depression 
According to a new study, anti-social behavior and anxiety among young elementary school children tends to predict adolescent depression. The researchers studied 800 predominantly white children for seven years. The study followed the children from first or second grade to middle school. 
Children, parents, and teachers were all asked to answer questions regarding the anxiety and depression levels of the children. 
An interesting observation from this study was that young children were able to distinguish between anxiety and depression and actually understood what they were feeling.
The study also showed that reactions differ depending on gender — boys usually continue with anti-social behavior and girls usually develop depression and other health problems.

Gene that controls tooth growth found
While animals like sharks have several rows of teeth, humans have only one row.
Researchers have discovered that there is a single gene is responsible for preventing the growth of additional teeth. When this gene was removed from mice, an extra set of teeth appeared in the mice’s mouths.
All mice without the gene, known as Osr2, were born with severe cleft palates. Since teeth start developing in the embryo, the knowledge of Osr2 could be used to prevent birth defects. 
The Osr2 gene works like a control switch and works with two other genes to make sure that the teeth form in the right spot.
Scientists want to find out exactly what spurs the growth of a new tooth so that they can regenerate teeth lost by disease or other causes in adults.

Study links hostility to weight gain
A new study shows that hostile men tend to put on more weight than men who are friendly and laid-back. Studies showed that the more hostile the personality of men, the higher the Body Mass Index, or BMI (height/weight). 
Data was collected from over 6000 men and women who were measured for hostility and BMI from four points over 19 years.
The BMI for women remained constant despite the hostility level, but for men, hostility seemed to accelerate weight gain. This can be explained by the fact that hostile people tend to be unhealthy or depressed, and prior studies have linked hostility to high blood pressure and mortality risk.

Weight loss found to not rely on diet type
The largest controlled study of weight-loss methods showed that it didn’t matter how calories were lost. Whether the calories were lost through a reduction in carbohydrates, protein, or fat,  it still resulted in weight loss. The diets tested were based on popular diets, such as the Atkins diet and the Mediterranean diet. 
Frank M. Sacks, professor of cardiovascular disease prevention at the Harvard School of Public Health and the study’s lead author said that now people are free to choose whatever diet they can stick to and still manage to lose weight.

Scientists find ancient footprints 
Footprints discovered in Kenya show that nearly 1.5 million years ago, the ancestors of humans had developed the foot structure and walking gait of modern humans. 
Researchers believe that the footprint belongs to Homo erectus, one of the earliest ancestors of humans.
The findings, reported in the journal Science, are special because this is the first time footprint trails for members of the genus Homo have been discovered. 
The only other time such footprint trails were discovered was in 1978 for the species Australopithecus afarensis.

NASA sets date for next launch
NASA set March 12 as the date for the launch of the space shuttle Discovery. The launch is the first of this year and was initially on hold due to concerns that a fuel valve could crack, damaging the entire shuttle. NASA decided to replace the valves with new ones that would be safer for the shuttle. 
The space shuttle will carry the last set of solar wings to the international space station, which is a $100 million project that has been under construction for over a decade. 
If the shuttle is unable to launch in March, the next date of the launch is scheduled for April. Before retiring these shuttles, NASA still has to carry out eight missions to take parts up to the space station.
Apart from these eight missions, a final mission will be carried out for servicing the Hubble Telescope. All of these missions are slated to take place by 2010.

Space dust found to be very pervasive
Scientists have discovered that cosmic dust expelled by different galaxies is present throughout space in significant quantities. 
Also, the study revealed that the dust is able to scatter through larger distances in space than previously expected. The dust could interfere with planned experiments that use supernovae to investigate dark energy.
Scientists were able to make these discoveries by studying the light patterns emitted by quasars. Quasars are present at the center of galaxies and emit streams of radio waves, X-rays, and gamma rays. Dust interferes with light of quasars and shifts light toward the red end of the spectrum.

10-million year old bird fossil found
Paleontologists in Peru have discovered a fossil of a bird that lived approximately 10 million years ago. The fossil was discovered in the Ica region of Peru’s southern coast and was from the bird’s cranium. It also reveals that the bird had teeth at the tip of its beak. Reserachers believe that the teeth helped the bird catch its prey. 
They also believe that the presence of the teeth indicates that the bird flew while it held its prey in its beak.
The bird, of the Pelagornithidae family, had a wingspan of 19.7 feet and first appeared 50 million years ago. Researchers believe that the large wings of the bird made it harder for the bird to take off from the ground. Researchers presume that the bird had to move to elevated ground to take off.

“I’ve never seen a place like this!” exclaimed first-year design student Susana Del Castillo at the Waffle Shop’s Grand Reopening on Friday night. With a newly refurbished interior and prime location in a revitalized area of East Liberty, the Waffle Shop displays an eerie resemblance to Edward Hopper’s painting Nighthawks from the outside. Inside, however, is a cheery restaurant and, of all things, a talk show platform. “Anyone can go up and be a guest on the talk show,” explained Terry Boyd, senior art major, as well as Waffle Shop staff member and talk show host.
The idea behind having a talk show forum and creating the Waffle Shop was to increase community participation. The shop is the product of an interesting Carnegie Mellon art class called Contextual Practices, where the aim is to “engage students in the production of art that has a direct, conscious, and sometimes catalytic relationship to the place it exists in and the audience it relates to,” as described by the School of Art’s website. And when inside the Waffle Shop during its shop hours (11 p.m. - 3 a.m. on Fridays and Saturdays), you definitely feel part of a unique social atmosphere where anyone is welcome.
In order to understand the talk show platform of this restaurant, it is important first to be aware of where the Waffle Shop came from. As a 2007 class project, the Waffle Shop was originally called “The Waffle Shop: A Reality Show” and began when students rented out an empty storefront that used to be a tuxedo shop. With the hope of increasing community participation and interaction in the East Liberty and Shadyside areas particularly, the Waffle Shop filmed agreeing customers in a reality TV show style that was broadcast on the restaurant’s own street-facing TV.
But this environment resulted in some major reality TV drama, particularly when the area’s bars let out and some party-goers would wander to the shop for some food. Some of the conversations were hysterical and interesting, reminisced Boyd, but “some were awfully boring.” In true reality TV, there is no control over who comes on the show or what happens at all, Boyd went on to explain. With a talk show, there is more of a controlled setting. Anybody can still get up on the stage and say whatever they want to, but Boyd hopes that the talk show host can prompt the guest when the conversation becomes dull.
As for the restaurant component of the Waffle Shop, staff member and first-year design major Frances Soong points out that “after all the renovation, we’re starting to look like an actual restaurant [or] TV set — so people get angry when we run out of waffles or forks and knives.”
Although the Waffle Shop staff may be adjusting to the project becoming more of a restaurant, currently, the waffles come out great. Not afraid of experimentation, the Waffle Shop serves classic style waffles along with “debuts,” such as peanut butter waffles. Another attraction on the menu, the banana choco-chip waffle, was a definite success.
The renovation of the store has also allowed the customers to distance themselves from the talk show aspect of the project as the colorful stage is set up in the corner of the shop. “People can visually see that they don’t have to be on TV if they don’t want to,” Soong explains. In the old design, customers would walk in and be surrounded by cameras. 
Boyd, a Pittsburgh native, is excited about the recent renovations and “get[ting] to know this really diverse community area” of East Liberty and Shadyside during the setting up of the store.
The general consensus among Waffle Shop staff and certain devoted Waffle Shop customers is that the shop is becoming a “permanent artist project” and that it hopes to be around for a long time. We now have a “really comfortable front,” mentioned Boyd as he described his aspiration for the shop to stay in its current restaurant and talk show form for a long time to come. With its professional and interesting design, quality waffles, and a number of satisfied customers, it’s easy to see that The Waffle Shop is on its way to becoming a long-term part of the East Liberty neighborhood.
From a Carnegie Mellon perspective, the project is also worthwhile and interesting as it is a premiere example of cross-collaboration between departments on campus and Pittsburgh culture off campus. Randi Smith, a senior architecture major and Waffle Shop staff member, explained the excitement of “starting this business from scratch” and seeing the shop grow, as it was forced to combine “departments across schools” and outsource creatively in order to stay alive.
Of the 13 staff members of the shop, there are two art majors, eight design students, two masters students in arts management, and the aforementioned Smith. Hoping to acquire a SURF grant this year, Boyd and Smith both cited the importance of coming together across campus and having at least some business skills to get their project’s message out while keeping it funded. Smith sees the next step of the Waffle Shop being to “convince people it is a real restaurant.”
An exciting aspect to the Waffle Shop is that you never know who is going to walk through its doors. Opening when most businesses are closed for the day or weekend, the shop is a convergence of many different people and lifestyles coming together for the simple goal of having a waffle and enjoying some company. Smith explained the shop’s atmosphere as a converging place “when all those paths cross.”
One devoted Waffle Shop customer who is currently struggling to find a job while trying to apply to colleges comes for the creative and social atmosphere. Earlier in the night, he volunteered to be the guest on the talk show where he and Boyd started playing a game of Monopoly. Talk shows and former reality TV shows from the Waffle Shop can also be found on YouTube. While these are the current two media for the Shop’s footage, they are hoping to gain some access to local television and cmuTV to spread their message to a larger portion of the public.
Of the shop’s customers, at least a third is composed of Carnegie Mellon students. “It’s neat that people from the community come; it gets the students involved in community events,” said first-year flute major Elizabeth Talbert.
Del Castillo noticed the intricacy and friendly design of the space and appreciated the work many art and design students put into the project. “[It’s a] cool way [of getting] involved with the community,” she said, excited about the cross-disciplinary example the Waffle Shop sets and how “it allows all of the students to be here and participate.”
The Waffle Shop may resemble Nighthawks from the outside, but the interior is a lively social atmosphere that is only enhanced by tasty waffles. The shop is on the rise with aspirations for the future, such as hiring local artists to perform in the space during designated variety hours. The impact of the Waffle Shop comes in the waffles it produces, the freedom of speech it encourages, the community involvement it sponsors, and the unique personalities that come through it; there really is no other place quite like it.
The shop is located at 154 South Highland Avenue and is open between 11 p.m. and 3 a.m. on Fridays and Saturdays. Customers traveling from Carnegie Mellon can make the journey easily by catching the 500 at the Fifth and Morewood bus stop and disembarking at the Highland Ave. and Baum St. stop.

“A por ellos” was a chant that I grew to know very well this past summer. The words translate to “go defeat them,” a sort of Spanish equivalent to Pittsburgh’s “Here We Go” for the Steelers, but in this case, these words were meant to inspire the Spanish National Soccer Team in the 2008 Euro Cup. Much like Steelers paraphernalia during the Super Bowl, “a por ellos” was everywhere, as were pictures of Spain’s “heroes,” such as Torres and Casillas. But my study abroad wasn’t focused on the excitement of Spain’s success in the Euro Cup; although as a big soccer fan, I was ecstatic to be in the country at the time.
During my seven-week stay, which included six weeks of class and one additional week of travel with family, I learned a lot — and not just in academics. I attended New York University in Madrid with my twin sister. It had been one year since we had been separated for the first time in our lives, so we thought, why not reunite in Spain, explore a new country and a new culture together, and also get a course or two out of the way?
Upon arriving in Madrid, my sister and I headed to our homestay to meet our “señora,” or our homestay mother. Once we reached the apartment, we were happy to find our señora, Maribel, ready and waiting for our arrival. She was a very kind, warmhearted woman, who spoke so fast that my sister and I felt a little dumbstruck after she had explained her policies and showed us around her apartment. Although we had both studied Spanish for six years, we were amazed to find out just how tongue-tied you can get when put in a real-life situation — we were no longer in a classroom where the safety net of speaking Spanglish could help you; I think it was at that point that my sister and I really understood where we were.
As Maribel prepared dinner for us, she introduced us to many of Spain’s specialties. Spanish tortilla, a type of omelet with potatoes, was my favorite. Other nights, she prepared fish or chicken with rice. Staying with Maribel was a great experience. During dinners, she would sit and talk to me and my sister. Being able to talk to her was a great way for us to practice using our Spanish — we talked about many things, from school and soccer to recipes and Maribel’s daughter’s upcoming wedding.
As far as classes went, both of my classes were in English. One was called “Masterpieces in the Prado Museum,” which focused primarily on the influence of Spain’s vibrant culture and customs, and on artists whose work had been displayed in the Prado. What was really unique about this course was that every Thursday, class was held in the Prado Museum, where what we learned in the classroom and observed on the slides came to life. The second class I took was called “Media Ethics, the Law, and the Public Interest in Spain.” This course explored censorship, politics, the judiciary system, terrorism, women, minorities, and other issues that relate to ethics in Hispanic nations. I found this course interesting since it helped me develop a better understanding of what influences daily life in Spain as well as what makes the Spanish people who they are.
Aside from academics, I learned a lot about the Spanish culture and lifestyle. After class, my sister and I explored Madrid, stopping in different neighborhoods before returning to our homestay. During the weekends, we had the opportunity to travel with some friends to various cities all over Spain, including Segovia, Toledo, Salamanca, Granada, Cordoba, and Barcelona. We traveled by bus and Spain’s high-speed train, the “AVE,” meaning bird, to get to each of these cities. By traveling this way, we were able to observe the unique landscapes of Spain. Some areas were very mountainous, others very flat, and still others were very hilly. Through our travels, we quickly learned that Spain is a very diverse country that holds tremendous educational, religious, and artistic significance.
If the opportunity had been available, I would have liked to spend an entire semester in Madrid. Being abroad is a great experience that opens you up to the language, culture, and lives of others. It is through experiences like these that, as Youssou N’Dour, a Sengalese singer once stated, “[people can] see that, far from being an obstacle, the world’s diversity of languages, religions, and traditions is a great treasure, affording us precious opportunities to recognize ourselves in others.”

Opportunity and freedom are taken away from death row prison inmates, but through Thirty-Four Kites, Kristen Lukiewski and Reina Takahashi, both Carnegie Mellon ’08 alumnae, give Pennsylvanian inmates a chance to express their creativity. The book is a combination of 34 pieces of art, poetry, and prose from prisoners on death row.
Working closely with these prisoners, Lukiewski and Takahashi were able to pick up different bits of information about their lives, including the lingo used. The word “kite,” for instance, is used to refer to the letters exchanged between prisoners. The inmates sent their kites out in the form of art, and despite limitations on size and color, Lukiewski and Takahashi wanted to include at least one piece from everyone who submitted, even though some submitted more than one. The book was published in May 2008 and gave everyone a chance to hear the silenced voices of the prisoners.
“I’ve always been taught to ‘write what you know,’ and I think that extends to write to who you know,” says Lukiewski. Since most of the pieces came from a prison in Waynesburg, a borough in the outskirts of Pittsburgh, the audience for this publication was extended to the whole Pittsburgh area. Originally, the audience was restricted to the students of Carnegie Mellon, but after completing the project, the authors realized that the scope of the book was much greater and extended far beyond the boundaries of just the university.
The funding for Thirty-Four Kites came from the Charles Dawe Publishing Award, which was created to help fund a unique publication created by a student. Lukiewski, affected by the murder of someone close to her, began to explore the idea that everyone has a nice side or a soft spot. With this in mind, she came up with the idea to work with prisoners and teamed up with Takahashi, who served as the editor and a partner in communication design.
The project adviser, creative writing professor Jane Bernstein, helped the authors get in touch with creative writing professor Jim Daniels and retired English professor Dave Demarest. Daniels and Demarest led Lukiewski and Takahashi to two prisoners, Mumia Abu Jamal and Robert “Sugar Bear” Lark, who helped them build the rest of their prisoner list.
The authors spoke with some of the inmates and built a more “earnest correspondence,” and then they began collecting the pieces that were going to be published. Almost all of the men they talked to were excited. When it comes to the prisoners and how they felt about contributing, Lukiewski said, “I really believe the book gave them an opportunity to feel valued, if only in some small way, and I think it made them happy, which is no small thing.” She feels that some people may have feelings of hatred toward Thirty-Four Kites because of the origin of its content, and that there would be a variety of reactions toward the death row prisoners who contributed their work.
In order to state her position, Lukiewski assures that “the goal of the book wasn’t to proclaim innocence, refute judgments and sentences, or to reject the government. You could say the goal was a lot more personal: we wanted to give some fellow human beings a voice. This book is just a small way of granting some men the freedom of speech, free of judgment.” Some of the pieces included in the book are religious, some about life in prison, some anxious, and some peaceful.
“In the end, I think Reina and I accomplished something really wonderful, and more than anything it convinces me to move on and begin another project,” Lukiewski said.
Editor’s Note: Kristen Lukiewski was the 2006 Pillbox Editor for The Tartan.

Billy Joel’s Movin’ Out reinvents the way musicals are put together. 
Musicals are usually thought of as goofy, jaunty little pieces where, in the midst of calamity or joy, the characters will all of a sudden break out into song and dance. While this is not how life always goes, it’s still a fun to watch people at the height of their emotions set their feelings to music. Movin’ Out, the new musical playing at Benedum Center, is something a little different.
Movin’ Out is a musical that relies on its music: That is, while there are dancers and actors, none of the people portraying any of the roles actually do any speaking, except for the drill sergeant. The piece is instead carried by Joel’s lyrics, which are woven around the scenes. While this might seem a little strange at first, the audience soon gets used to it, and finds fun in learning to read the dancers’ moves for clues about what their characters are feeling.
This musical leaves a lot up to the audience. While a synopsis is listed in the playbook, making it easy to track what the dancers are doing, it’s still fun to sit back and figure out what’s going on. The caliber of the performance was excellent. The dancers performed aerials with ease, and the choreography combined modern moves with classical backgrounds for a neat twist.
Plot-wise, Movin’ Out is a story about a group of high school friends from the ’60s who has its share of breakups and drama. Initially, Eddie and Brenda are a hot couple, while James and Judy, who are high school sweethearts, hope to spend the rest of their lives togekther. Tony, the odd man out, is comfortable and easy-going, and the group gets along well.
Then, things start to get messy. Eddie and Brenda break up, and Eddie tries to win Brenda back, but with no luck: Brenda has gone her own way and starts seeing Tony instead. James proposes to Judy and the two begin to plan their wedding for the month after graduation. Everything seems just as it should be until the Vietnam War begins and Eddie, James, and Tony are drafted.
What is intriguing is how all the songs carry from one scene to the next. “Uptown Girl” plays when Brenda starts looking for a new guy and “We Didn’t Start the Fire” blasts across the stage as the scene switches between Judy worrying about her fiance and the boys fighting in the jungle. All the songs are performed live by a band on the second tier of the stage, and on occasion a musician or a dancer will look above or below and nod or wave. These simple gestures tie the configuration together neatly.
It is also admirable how well the props and the costumes are used. In a string of bar scenes — every one of the main characters finds himself or herself in a bar (or dancing on the bar) at some point during the plot — with each of the bars set up differently. While Eddie is drowning out his sorrow over the death of one of his companions with drugs, the bar scene becomes surreal, with the dancers swaying in strange outfits that they’d been hiding underneath their day clothes. Later, Eddie and Judy, having met while out jogging, dance classically in their running outfits. It’s a tribute to the dancers and the musical itself that somehow it manages to incorporate the classical, established skills with new, more modern forms of dance.
While the scenes are simplistic, they are also very poignant. At the height of his despair at James’ death, Eddie is surrounded by three dancers with out all look like Judy, harshly striking out at him and accusingly making circles around him. This scene portrays how trapped Eddie feels, his guilt, and how he feels like he can never get out from all the stress surrounding him. Appropriately, “Pressure” is the song that goes along with that scene.
In the end, though, everything comes together: Judy gets back into the dating scene, Eddie comes to terms with himself, as well as with Tony and Brenda’s relationship, which has had some troubles of its own. While its way of being a musical is unconventional, Movin’ Out is perfect for the adventurous theater-goer or Billy Joel fan. It promises to excite and keep the audience members on the edge of their seats all the way to the grand finale.

Taiwan Café, located on the corner of Forbes Avenue and Oakland Avenues, serves non-Americanized Chinese food. Being third generation Thai-born Chinese who grew up in Thailand, where there’s a massive Chinese population, I saw the street-side stir-fried dishes as ones my Cantonese speaking grandmother would make. At Taiwan Café, the foods are comforting and delicious.
Along the narrow hallway leading down to the café underground, various photos of dishes along with their names are shown. The pictures consist of an array of common dishes like General Tso’s chicken, which are served in many Chinese eateries, or dishes like stir-fried Chinese vegetables you rarely come across elsewhere.
Once you get into the café, you can place your order at the counter, which is usually staffed by the same woman. She is always willing to talk to you about whatever you want, and you can ask her about the dish without fear of making her mad, a refreshing gesture lacking in some Chinese places. If you are not sure about any dish, you can take a look at two full photo albums with the dishes and their names, reducing the chance of an unexpected surprise.
Beef tripe with ginger is probably not a dish you will find on a menu of your regular Chinese take-out place. For those who are curious, beef tripe is actually cow’s stomach. The idea of eating an animal’s stomach may seem exotic, but tripe is really about as exotic as bratwurst or pasta. Tripe dishes can be found from German or Italian cuisine to a Zimabwean kitchen, and everywhere in between.
Beef tripe with ginger is a hot stir-fried dish with strips of tripe, onion, ginger, and chilies. The dish can be made more or less spicy based on your personal preferences. Tripe itself doesn’t have any flavor, but it has a unique earthy aroma and crunchy texture, so it takes on the sweetness of onion and heat of chilies. Ginger binds everything together without overpowering the dish. Those who are not big fans of ginger can still enjoy the dish as long as they avoid the actual ginger strands. The mild spiciness of the dish can be tamed with your choice of milk tea or bubble tea.
If the dish is not very spicy, a hot black tea with milk and tapioca can warm you up. Just be careful while drinking a hot drink from a large straw.
For fans of seafood, Taiwan Café has mussels with black bean sauce, or salt and pepper shrimp with shell on, that will satisfy your craving. the latter is a deep-fried shrimp in pale batter lightly tossed with salt and black pepper. Coarse salt and pepper really bring out the simple seafood-esque flavor from the shrimp. And yes, the shrimp are not peeled; they are deep fried with shells as the name says. When properly done, the crispy batter goes well with the whole shrimp.
With two meaty dishes, our group chose stir-fried fresh oriental green. Here, the oriental green is Chinese broccoli, also known as Chinese kale or kai-lan. In Thai, they are called ka-nah. The Chinese broccoli is stir-fried with chopped garlic and either some soy sauce or salt. Here, the sauce is not the usual salty thick brown sauce, but rather a light, clean sauce with a soup-like consistency. The Chinese broccoli has a thick stem at the bottom and large, flat leaves with smaller stem — imagine large, flat leaves instead of tiny broccoli florets. In each plate of stir-fried Chinese broccoli, the large stems up to the smaller leaves and occasional flower are served on the same plate. That way, you get different textures and slightly different flavors in the same dish.
Each dish is served with rice. You serve yourself either cold water or hot black tea from the small corner next to the counter, which goes perfectly with every dish. Before leaving, make sure to order either hot milk tea or a red bean milkshake smoothie to warm you up or cool you down on your way home.

One of the few men in today’s sports media who offers his honest opinion without any hint of a hidden agenda or ulterior motive about all things sports is Will Leitch, founding editor of   deadspin.com. Through the website, Leitch has been bringing the world “sports news without access, favor, or discretion” since September 2005, until his recent departure from the site in June 2008.
Recently, Leitch wrote a book titled God Save the Fan: How Preening Sportscasters, Athletes Who Speak in the Third Person, and the Occasional Convicted Quarterback Have Taken the Fun out of Sports (and How We Can Get It Back). The title may be a mouthful, but it gives you a clear sense of the kind of book you’re about to experience. Leitch is not hesitant to speak out about some of the most controversial subjects in sports today, including steroids and God’s place in the sporting world. He goes on to bring up his own controversial opinions about each and every subject, and does so with wit and humor.
The book is divided into four sections: Players, Owners, Media, and Fans. You don’t need to be a rocket scientist to determine who he discusses in each part, though he does have a distinct method to his madness. For example, Leitch initially focuses on disgraced former Atlanta Falcons quarterback, Michael Vick, who was jailed after dog fighting charges surfaced, but doesn’t discuss the charges or Vick’s career. Interestingly enough, he focuses on Vick’s use of an alias, “Ron Mexico,” when he allegedly went in for STD testing. It’s this type of information — news that falls behind the main headlines — that is all over deadspin.com on a daily basis.
Leitch brings up ESPN quite a bit too, though not in the “good” sense. He has been “blackballed by ESPN,” meaning that ESPN employees have been notified never to credit any breaking news stories to deadspin.com or the man behind it. He blasts virtually every single commentator employed by the “worldwide leader in sports” and makes the very well-founded claim that, due to ESPN’s near monopoly over the sporting world, they are able to pick and choose which stories they believe should be “hot topics,” some of the time without regard to actual newsworthiness, like the “Who’s Now?” series.
But before you go thinking that Leitch is just a random, mindless drone preaching his ideals over the Internet, and who lacks any kind of true passion for the game, there’s an entire section of his book devoted to his experiences during the St. Louis Cardinals 2006 World Series push and eventual victory. He lives and dies with his team. Having grown up in the small town of Mattoon, Ill. before finding sucess in the Big Apple, Leitch has a “rags-to-riches” story that gives him a more relateable appeal. 
The main idea of the book is indeed laid out in the title. Leitch’s basic opinion of sports is that they exist as an escape. As human beings, we all deal with stresses, major and minor, but the fact that some of us know exact statistics like the 40 Time of Jerricho Cotchery, the wide receiver for the New York Jets, or the statistics for every season of Pirates’ shortstop Jack Wilson’s career, is actually quite a fine means of relieving that stress. We choose to live and die with every pitch, pass, and shot of our favorite game because it gives us the utmost joy. As Leitch writes in his closing statement: “Because if you can’t let yourself go and enjoy sports, you can’t enjoy much of anything.”
Even the Steelers are not left out of God Save the Fan: Steelers quarterback Ben Roethlisberger is pictured at a party in the book in a photograph of a scene not usually made into news, a scene in which Roethlisberger is letting loose and having fun.
Nowadays, people can catch Leitch’s rants and raves about everything sport-related in New York magazine, where he is currently employed and holds the title of “Intelligencer.”
This book is definitely a must-read for the sports fan that everyone harbors inside. Leitch’s viewpoint is both humorous and refreshing, and he provides a different kind of insight into the world of sports.

Many bands can thank the blogosphere for their 15 minutes of fame, but although Tapes ’n Tapes are now well into their second hour, they still seem a bit dumbfounded by the whole thing. While they may be reluctant to notice, it is clear that they have traveled a ways since they exploded onto the scene in 2006. Now after three years of touring, two albums, and one arguably memorable sit-down at the WRCT studios, the band retains their sense of humor and humility about their lives, on and off the road.
WRCT: You guys are from Minneapolis. How has it been to grow up as musicians in an area with a lot of musical history but maybe not as much contemporary hype?
Matt Kretzman: Jeremy and I are the only ones that actually grew up in Minneapolis. I guess I wasn’t too plugged into it all growing up. My first show ever was at First Avenue. I saw Weezer on the Blue Album tour, but that wasn’t really part of the local scene. I don’t know, I’ve watched Purple Rain around 40 times, at least.
W: Have you purified yourselves in the waters of Lake Minnetonka?
Jeremy Hanson: I think I did that daily, except that I can’t really swim.
W: Talking about the music now, there’s a nice translation that occurs between your albums and your live shows, which I understand is something that you were conscious of when making Walk It Off. Do you ever think there is something in trying to obtain that translation that might preclude you from using certain instrumentation or trying things that you might want to experiment with, but you feel doesn’t fit into your sound?
Josh Grier: I think we used to be more conscious of that, but we’re messing around with things a lot more on this tour. In the last year or two I think we’ve been playing enough with each other that there’s less of a questioning of whether something’s going to come across or if it’s going to work. We just have to make it work.... When we were making The Loon, we weren’t really conscious of how we were going to do things live, so when we went in to make this record, we learned that if we do things a certain way, it might be difficult to do it live or it might just be a pain.
MK: In terms of playing songs off the different records, ultimately they take on a life of their own after we play them a hundred times. Since we don’t go back and listen to the records very much, it’s really only a figment of our imagination what it sounds like.
W: Specifically speaking about the songwriting, many critics have talked about you coming into your own as a songwriter. It seems like the lyrics on Walk It Off are more straightforward, almost serious in the sense that there’s less play with words. Obviously you were approaching this album from a very different place in your life and in your career — how do you approach writing an album from this totally different perspective? What sorts of things were you conscious of?
Josh: When I was writing lyrics for The Loon, a lot of it was stuff that had been pieced together over a long period of time.... When it came to Walk It Off, I think most of the lyrics were actually written while we were in the studio.... I was trying to make it so that people could maybe understand what was going on. I’ve never tried to be intentionally obtuse about things, but I definitely like leaving things open-ended.... None of it for me has ever been total nonsense; it’s always just pictures that I have in my head and sometimes I talk funny and sometimes I ramble on for hours....
W: Has there been anything you have expected from yourselves that you might not have accomplished?
Josh: We are so far past anything we ever expected that any level of lack of success would still be way beyond. When we began it was just like, “So Matt, you used to play trombone so you’re going to play bass and I’m going to play guitar and I don’t know how to sing and we don’t have a drummer, so, here we go!” Our first show, there was blood everywhere. We drank a lot of whiskey....
To hear Tapes ’n Tapes talk more about life in the shadow of Prince, bloody concerts, Battlestar Galactica, and more, tune your radio dial to 88.3 FM on Tuesday, March 3, at 6 p.m. to listen to the full interview, or stream it online at wrct.org.

The third annual Carnegie Mellon International Film Festival, Faces of Realism, began with a bang on Thursday, Feb. 26, with the showing of Paolo Sorrentino’s Il Divo. The creator of the festival, Jolanta Lion, a special faculty member at the Humanities Center, put together a group of lauded films that interpret their own version of realism through the medium of film. 
This collection of cinema, which has been given prizes from such prestigious festivals as the Cannes, deserves all the recognition it can receive. The directors and films may not sound too familiar to the mainstream film industry in America, but this festival gives students the opportunity to see many notable international films from this year.
Il Divo is the gripping story of seven-time Italian Prime Minister Gulio Andreotti. During the opening night, Tony Buba, an internationally acclaimed director from Braddock, Pa. (a suburb of Pittsburgh) introduced the movie by claiming that “it was the movie Oliver Stone wishes he could make, if he had Paulo Sorrentino’s talent.” Sorrentino weaves many characters together and paints the character of Andreotti with a masterstroke. This suspenseful tale is visually gritty and instantly appealing, and the heavy dose of wit and humorous remarks provided by Andreotti only heighten the many precarious thoughts over the man’s innocence or guilt. As the film’s climax occurs, the director masterfully leaves the viewer without a definitive answer, with the intention of letting the audience members decide for themselves. The film won the Jury Prize and received a Golden Palm nomination in the 2008 Cannes Film Festival.
The festival continues through this week with intriguing movies that are definitely worth a watch and a second screening of Il Divo at the SouthSide Works Saturday March 7.
The Mother (March 4, McConomy Auditorium): 
Antoine Cattin’s and Pavel Kostomarov’s movie chronicles a woman, Liubuv, in her rural, farming community. The directors spent three years chronicling Liubuv’s life, attempting to weave a complicated yet realistic expression of her story.
It’s a Free World (March 5, SouthSide Works): 
Ken Loach’s film is wonderfully thought-provoking and describes the life of a woman who is fed up with being used. The film received the 2007 Golden Osella Best Screenplay and a 2008 BAFTA TV Nomination for Best Actress. The film also won awards from the 2008 Sevilla Festival de Cine Europeo and the 2008 Festival Internacional de Cine.
Momma’s Man (March 6, SouthSide Works): 
With awards from the 2007 Vienna Film Festival, 2008 Off Camera Film Festival, and the 2008 Independent Film Festival, Momma’s Man needs no further encouragement to watch the film. However, as an added bonus, Lion was able to schedule an appearance of the director at the screening of the film.
Marcela (March 8, SouthSide Works): 
The festival finishes with Helena Trestikova’s Marcela. This movie is a true story, and follows a woman, Marcela, through her engagement, life with her in-laws, her failed marriage, and the subsequent erosion of her life. The film does not take a hands-off approach as it attempts to confront the conventional director roles and the function of the audience. The film won the Best European Documentary at the 2007 Seville Film Festival, and the Best Czech Documentary at the 2007 Finale Plzen Film Festival.
The 2009 International Film Festival, Faces of Realism, is presented by the Humanities Center of Carnegie Mellon, and finishes on March 8. Tickets are $7 general, $3 students.

Even 100 years ago, math humor still existed on our hallowed grounds. A joke in this week’s edition of The Tartan describes a man who says his mind “isn’t large enough to reach infinity.” Another man then tells him, “Draw it to 1/4 scale, maybe you can reach it then.”

Inside Carnegie Technical, the scientific magazine of Carnegie Tech, one article is based on the rings of Saturn, while another describes how a nuclear reactor works. The most impressive article is a rigorous chemical decomposition of “vitameatavegiman,” an elixir featured on I Love Lucy.

A student writes a glowing review for Phil Collins’ album, No Jack Required, calling it “enchanting” and “jazzlike.” However, a bad review is given for the album cover, which is just a huge picture of Phil Collins’ face. I guess you can’t blame him. Who else can rock so softly?

After a wave of resignations from Student Senate, student activities take the back burner. Several groups requiring funding have found it hard to locate the appropriate Senators to get approval. This means that some student groups have to face having no funding to carry out their normal practices. Evidence of this can be seen from The Tartan issues in 1999, where budget cuts have forced staffwriters to omit vowels from their articles.

The men’s water polo team hosts its first tourney in the main pool of the University Center. Winning several games before finally losing to Army, the Tartans held a fine showing of their talent in their first serious year on campus. In fact, their performance went so well that the “Fish Out of the Water” league, headed by Marco, wishes to merge the two clubs.

Carnegie Mellon proudly announces that only nine other colleges in the entire country have higher tuition. With a measly 6 percent increase to just over $35,000 per year (without room and board), students couldn’t be happier. One student proudly claimed that the money was well spent. Thankfully, no one reacted negatively to the increase, as everyone here has plenty of money to pay for tuition. On another positive note, this year’s pleasant economic news will make tuition even easier to pay than last year.

Recently, I have been put on a blog that put me in a bad light. There’s no libel on it, but I don’t like being misrepresented by someone who knows almost nothing about me. What can I do to change this?
—Blogged in Baker
Dear Blogged,

There’s a very effective process to take care of this problem. If the blog is currently on your web browser, find the small “x” located on the top right of your screen, and then click on it. By doing so, you have probably stopped all views of your blog article.
Blogs offer painfully horrible articles written by those who have an opinion about everything. Ask a blogger about his or her opinion on the price of cheese in Spain in 1954, and you will get a 15-page report filled with absolute nonsense. Chances are either cheese, Spain, or the year 1954 will be called “ignorant” during the process. Bloggers like to use that term to sound worldly.
Please don’t take offense if you’ve been a victim of blog hate. Remember, these are the same people who fill YouTube with cynical comments. To them, even instructional videos on gardening are “photoshopped,” “quote unquote anti-intellectual per-se,” and of course, “ignorant.” If gardening can take a hit from bloggers, then so can you. The best way to deal with them is to ignore them.
Zero Comments, 
Joe
Dear Joe,
I recently found a $100 bill lying in a grocery store. I waited around for a long time to see if anyone was looking for it, and even gave it to a manager just in case someone asked where it was. After two weeks, the store called, and said that no one had claimed it. Now I have $100, and I don’t know what to do with it. Any suggestions?
—Rich in Resnik
Dear Rich,
First off, nice job on doing the right thing. Hopefully, the person who lost the money was loaded. In fact, chances are he or she was. Who else carries $100 bills?
Now, about the spending part, you have several options. Of course, one of them is charity. And that’s not a bad idea. I’m sure there are thousands who need that cash more than you. If you don’t want to give it away, that’s fine too. I’m not here to guilt you, Rich.
Personally, if I had to spend $100, it would be on a large amount of something that’s relatively cheap. This way, you can feel the effects of your money for a long time. For instance, I would buy 50 pounds of ground beef. If properly refrigerated, this can give you months and months of quality dinners. Vegetarian? That’s alright. Just fill your cabinets with lentils or tofu.
Of course, you can always get a new pair of shoes, some DVDs, or even invest your money. But why choose the lame option? This money was found in quirky circumstances, and that’s how it should be lost as well.
That'll be $80, 
Joe

Dear Arthur Russell,
Let’s pretend it didn’t happen. That it just… didn’t. Don’t get me wrong, it was a good documentary and all. I enjoyed the whole thing — the flannel, the fluorescence, the frustration. Your parents and boyfriend are adorable and the clips of you playing guitar in that puffy winter jacket — black and white bliss, my man. But I’d rather wipe the mnemonic slate clean.
Let’s pretend that I’ve never known anything about you, that my first and last encounters with you are Another Thought spinning humbly in the dark. That I know nothing of your beatnik exodus from Iowa, nothing of your camaraderie with Allen Ginsburg, nothing of your disco prowess, nothing of AIDS, nothing of nothing. That all I know, not just of you, but of the whole world, is this supine posture — lying face up — is this cello echoing and squealing into the shadows, is your voice lilting and reverberant, sure as soft cotton on bleeding skin.
Let’s pretend that there is a city even Italo Calvino, the famous writer, hasn’t conjured, one where your lyrics are law, where your melodies are weather, where your atmospheres are public housing policy, where your four-track is the key to the courthouse. Let’s pretend I’m bedding down in the tenement of your sadness and hope. Let’s pretend the headline of the “Russell Daily Register” says “Lucky cloud in your sky, Brother.”
Let’s pretend I still listen to music more than I catalog it. “The birth of the moment is never ending.” Let’s pretend I believe that because it’s you saying it, singing it in loops of noise. Voltaire said that the only things too stupid to be said are sung. I want to be stupid with you.
Let’s pretend it’s the ghosts who have to believe in us for us to be real. Let’s pretend it’s you listening to me. Let’s pretend it’s you reading this letter, you smoothing the creases of this with your palms, you smearing newsprint into the whorls on your fingertips.
This is how we walk on the moon.

Carnegie Mellon lost nearly $50 million to two money managers who spent a chunk of the cash on teddy bears and other luxuries, according to a Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) lawsuit filed last Thursday. The potentially irretrievable 5 percent loss to the endowment’s value hits the university in a year already expected to produce significant financial setbacks due to global recession.
“We do not yet possess sufficient information to estimate with confidence the likely timing or extent of our potential recovery of our investment,” said Carnegie Mellon President Jared L. Cohon, in an e-mail statement last Thursday.
Federal authorities arrested and charged Manhattan’s Westridge Capital Management firm operators Paul Greenwood and Stephen Walsh last Wednesday for misappropriating over a half-billion dollars from Carnegie Mellon, the University of Pittsburgh, and other investors, according to the SEC complaint. Carnegie Mellon and the University of Pittsburgh, who together invested over $115 million with the firm, had already filed a lawsuit against Westridge with the United States District Court for the Western District of Pennsylvania on Friday, Feb. 20.
“This investment [with Westridge Capital] was ‘highly recommended’ to the university by one of our external consultants, Wilshire Associates Incorporated,” said Teresa Thomas on behalf of the university’s Media Relations in an e-mail.
The Wall Street Journal reported on Thursday that, in addition to Wilshire Associates, Cambridge Associates and Mercer Investment Consulting also offered “glowing” reports about Westridge Capital Management Inc. to their clients, including universities, public school systems, and retirement foundations across the nation. Kim Shepherd, spokeswoman for Wilshire, told The Journal that her firm undertook typical diligence in Westridge’s case, reviewing audited financial statements, regulatory filings, and bank account records before recommending the firm.
“These consultants are retained by the university to, among other things, provide expertise and perform substantial due diligence, including with respect to operational, systems and strategic aspects of the investments they recommend,” Thomas said.
According to the Commodity Futures Trading Commission lawsuit, filed in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York on Feb. 25, Greenwood and Walsh misappropriated approximately $553 million of approximately $1.3 billion in overall pool participants’ funds. They used new pool participants’ funds to cover up prior losses, and used over $160 million for personal expenses, including rare books at auctions, horses, collectible Steiff teddy bears bought for as much as $80,000 at various auctions including Sotheby’s, and a $3 million residence for Walsh’s ex-wife, Janet Walsh.
“He’s done wonders for the town; this is a very tragic situation,” said Cynthia Curtis, chairman of the local planning board in North Salem, N.Y., of Greenwood to The Wall Street Journal. Greenwood serves as the affluent, rural, 5000-strong Westchester County town’s supervisor, the equivalent of mayor, according to The Journal. He and Walsh are also ex-owners of the New York Islanders hockey team.
Westridge Capital’s malfeasance follows months of mounting and interrelated financial catastrophes contributing to a gloomy investment climate for the university, from Bear Stearns’ collapse to Bernie Madoff and Robert Stanford’s billion-dollar Ponzi schemes, through bailouts and stimuli, multi-trillion-dollar budgets, credit crunches, and housing crises. Cohon predicted in a Jan. 23 statement to the campus community a 30 percent decrease in endowment value due to global recession, with slow recovery thereafter.
The message came three weeks before the National Futures Association (NFA) alerted the university that it had suspended Greenwood and Walsh’s membership to its regulatory organization due to their failure to cooperate with an audit. Carnegie Mellon then contacted the NFA, the SEC, and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission for assistance, and asked Westridge for full redemption of its $49 million investment with the firm. The Pittsburgh Post-Gazette reported on Friday that legal experts expected the university to be unable to recoup its losses from Greenwood and Walsh.
Robert Strauss, professor of economics and public policy at Carnegie Mellon, told the Post-Gazette that he expected the endowment to take beyond the rest of his career to recover, characterizing its downfall due to fraud and recession as “radical.”
The loss assails Carnegie Mellon as a salary freeze looms for the July 1, 2009 through June 30, 2010 fiscal year. The university will also implement campus-wide department cutbacks to adjust to the global downturn.
“It is more likely that the impact, if any, will be felt in future years,” Cohon said in his e-mail statement, referring to the $50 million loss.
Despite circumstances, Carnegie Mellon economics professors, officials, financial aid administrators, and trustees expressed near-unanimous confidence in the university’s financial stability throughout a series of interviews with The Tartan over the past two weeks about the school’s fiscal well-being. It was unclear by press time how much Cohon and other officials who spoke with The Tartan knew about the suit with Westridge, which the Post-Gazette first reported on Wednesday.
“Westridge is an unrelated matter,” Thomas said in response to questions about Carnegie Mellon officials’ recently expressed optimism in the face of a global recession now colliding with a one-time $50 million loss.
“[President Cohon] has reassured us all, via the [e-mail to the campus community], that we are moving quickly and aggressively to protect the university’s assets,” Thomas said.
She did not clarify the extent of officials’ knowledge of the Westridge situation, although several top-level administrators had spoken with The Tartan about the school’s fiscal health one week after the NFA first alerted the university of potential problems with their Westridge investment. 
She did reaffirm the confidence expressed by several officials, including Cohon, prior to the Westridge suits in the university’s financial well-being.
She added that, “unlike others on our campus, [President Cohon] has not engaged in speculative comments,” about the combined effects of a global downturn and the Westridge misappropriation on the university’s fiscal stability.
Not including the Westridge losses, a potential 30 percent drop predicted for the year in the endowment’s annual draw would result in a 1.8 percent annual operating budget hole (30 percent of 6 percent), according to Thomas.
“At some other institutions, a comparable 30 percent drop in their endowment draw might generate a 12 percent annual operating budget deficit that is far more challenging to fill,” she said, not indicating whether an additional 5 percent loss to Westridge would be addressed through further cost cutting, in addition to the 5 percent cuts to academic units by 2012 with a minimum reduction of 2 percent in 2010, and 10 percent by 2012, with a minimum reduction of 2.5 percent in 2010 for administrative units that Cohon described in his Jan. 23 e-mail.

Although numerous education programs have felt the adverse effects of the current economic situation, it appears that study abroad programs for Carnegie Mellon students may still be a feasible and even favorable option.
According to Emily Half, the coordinator of study abroad and international programming at Carnegie Mellon, the Office of International Education has seen “no decline in study abroad numbers.” She noted further that “the 43 sponsored programs offered by the university allow the student to study abroad while paying Carnegie Mellon tuition costs and maintaining all of their institutional, state, and federal aid money.”
Half advised that students who did not have a large financial aid package from Carnegie Mellon might be better off, at least from a financial standpoint, if they applied directly to the university through a third-party adviser, such as IES or SIT, both of which offer independent study abroad programs. These U.S.-based companies can help students search through the various programs being offered, find housing, and have an easier transition period.
A direct application has the advantage in that the student would be able to pay the costs set by the foreign university, which are often much lower than those at Carnegie Mellon.
She explained that “although this option does not allow students to transfer their institutional aid over to the foreign university, they would be able to use their federal and state aid money.”
From this standpoint, according to Half, study abroad could potentially be a money-saving option for many students.
Melissa Deschamps, the director of international education at the Qatar campus, agreed, stating that “because the college provides assistance to the students, they find it easier to travel abroad even though we are currently in an economic recession.”
She pointed out that the Qatar campus “has actually seen in increase in the number of applications we have received. In particular, we have seen an increase in applicants to our summer program and have received over 20 applications, the highest number we’ve seen in recent years.”
Although the costs of the programs themselves have not been overtly affected, many students have been feeling the financial strain associated with the costs of living and travel expenses. Half stated that she knew of at least one student who had been debating about changing his study abroad destination to a place where the U.S. dollar has more value.
According to the Carnegie Mellon study abroad website, approximately 56 percent of the 370 students who chose to study abroad last year attended universities in Europe, a percentage that may drop in the coming year due to the poor exchange rate.
Sruthi Reddy, a sophomore electrical and computer engineering major who is currently studying abroad on the Qatar campus, noted that “the bad economy has definitely been taking its toll on traveling costs; flying has become much more expensive recently.”
It is also possible, according to Half, that there may be some negative effects on the scholarships offered by outside organizations as well as those offered by Carnegie Mellon in the year ahead, although no changes have been confirmed yet.
Despite these additional outside expenses, the guarantee that the tuition costs will be the same if not less than those at Carnegie Mellon is a welcome sign that study abroad is still a feasible option.
Studying abroad could even provide the necessary edge on a student’s résumé when competing for internships and full-time jobs. The recent introduction of the Senator Paul Simon Study Abroad Foundation Act of 2009 highlights the premium many officials place on expanding opportunities that allow college students from all backgrounds to gain a global education.
Senator Roger Wicker (R-Miss.) promoted the legislation and study abroad programs in general, stating that “it is important that our country prepare our young people for the challenges of competing in an increasingly globalized marketplace.”
When considering the possibility of increased federal support and the tendency of many foreign universities to have a lower tuition than Carnegie Mellon, it is possible that study abroad programs can provide both a new cultural experience and reduce costs, a definite “win-win situation,” according to Half.

University of Pittsburgh faculty member Arif Jamal spoke last week about the roots of Islam within the African-American community to help commemorate Black History Month at Carnegie Mellon.
The lecture was a collaborative effort between the Muslim Students Association (MSA) and the black awareness organization, SPIRIT. While an acknowledged presence of Muslim communities across the U.S. exists, “not many people are aware of the diversities among Muslims,” Jamal said. He also said that a large segment of the Muslim population in the U.S. is actually from the U.S.; that is, they are American Muslims.
According to a Newsweek report, there were an estimated 7 to 8 billion American Muslims in the U.S. in 2008, excluding residents who do not have U.S. citizenship. Since the U.S. Census Bureau does not classify citizens according to their religions, it is less likely to obtain an exact demographic.
“African-Americans make up a large percentage of the people who convert to Islam,” Jamal said. But for the Muslim African-American, being Muslim goes in hand in hand with “not leaving being black,” he added.
“I always had an affinity for Islam,” said sixth-year chemical and biomedical engineering major LaToya Williams. “I found it so beautiful, but I was never able to investigate the tenets the way I wanted to. Through this lecture I realized that the sense of communion in Islam is so similar to that in African culture,” she said.
During the first half of his presentation, Jamal walked his audience through the corridors of African-American history, focusing on the spread of Islam in Western Africa well over 1000 years ago. “Islam is not a new religion, even in Africa,” Jamal said. Contrary to the popular belief that Islam was brought to the Africans by Arabs, it is a part of a very “early metaphysical declaration” in the African continent, Jamal said.
“Islam became intertwined with African culture, and was incorporated into the African society.... Archeologists have dug up Muslim sites in Western Africa,” he said, displaying photographs of African-style mosques and pyramids, some shaped like large beehives.
The lineage of present-day African-Americans can be traced back to diverse entities in Western Africa that were funneled to the New World via the passage of slavery. “As an African-American, it made me curious about my own genealogy and heritage,” Williams said.
Jamal transitioned into the second part of his lecture, during which he emphasized the importance of the Muslim identity to African-Americans, and argued that the present-day notion of brotherhoods and sisterhoods were born out of the slaves’ experience of the “Middle Passage” — the slave trade route that brought Africans to the New World. “These are Muslims trying to preserve their identity by practicing their religion,” Jamal said of modern-day brotherhoods.
Punctuated with evidential primary documents, the second half of Jamal’s presentation illustrated the Muslim origins of numerous African slaves who were imported during the slave trade, which lasted almost three centuries.
Common Muslim names like “Mohammed” and “Mustafa” in their Arabic forms, as well as their African variants, were printed on the slave import documents. The documentation consisted of legal texts and autobiographies, including details about mosques, Islamic attire, and dietary restrictions like “refusal to eat pork.” Physical problems of Africans, such as broken limbs and missing body parts, were also indicated in the documents.
“The use of primary documents was very assuring,” said Khalid Harun, a Carnegie Mellon alumnus and MSA member.
He also demonstrated how Africans were classified by their slave-owners. “Africans were used because they had particular skills that were needed in the slave-based economy,” Jamal said, and that the demand for Muslim slaves was an increasingly conscious one due to their “devotion, literacy, and organizing capabilities.” He then produced an early slave document titled “Cotton and Rice Negroes.”
According to Jamal, the significance of education and language is usually underplayed when referring to African Muslims. He also pointed out that the first slave narrative was written in Arabic, revealing both the literary and cultural roots of the African slave. “The rich Muslim tradition of learning, embodied in Islamic scholarship in medieval libraries that have been handed down, is something people aren’t aware of,” Jamal said.
Representing MSA in organizing this event, electrical and computer engineering Ph. D. student Rozana Hussin said that the lecture was an excellent primer for “someone who did not know much about African-American history or its connection to Islam.” She continued, “It was very engaging, and now I want to know more about the relevance of Islam to African-Americans. It really broadened my mindset.”
Jamal brought the lecture to a close by relating the contributions African-American Muslims made to various fields like literature, science, religion, and politics.
“Today, despite the emergence of several models of Islam, the African-American Muslim can say, ‘I’m American, Muslim, and African-American, and these are not at odds.’ ”

Last week, North Korea announced its intention to prepare and launch a satellite, using a two- or three-stage Taepodong-2 missile. The missile is said to have a maximum range of 4300 kilometers, according to publishing company Jane’s Information Group, and has the ability to carry both conventional and military payloads. According to the BBC, previous tests of the Taepodong-2 in 2006 ended in failure as the missile crashed within 45 seconds of launch.
Defense officials in the United States and across the East Asian region are concerned, however, as they view the satellite launch to be a smokescreen for circumventing a military missile test ban North Korea agreed to as part of six-party talks on denuclearization. Additionally, the successful development of this missile would place a number of American bases and allied populations — including the state of Alaska — within the missile’s range, according to the Council on Foreign Relations. Accurate information on the Taepodong-2’s capabilities is hard to come by, as the missile is both classified and still under development.
Only days prior to North Korea’s announcement of the missile launch, Secretary of State Hillary Clinton made it clear in a conversation with South Korea’s foreign minister Yu Myung-hwan that she did not support the region’s decision to launch the missile, calling it “unhelpful” and “provocative,” according to a Feb. 24 article in The New York Times. She also stated that such action would be viewed by the Obama administration as “antagonistic.”
North Korea has responded to allegations made by the U.S. government by stating its right to develop a peaceful space program, a term the republic first used to justify its testing of the first such missile, the Taepodong-1 ballistic missile, in 1998.
The announcement, a world away, does not seem to concern most Carnegie Mellon students.
Philip Brown, a first-year general CIT student from Virginia, stated that “the missile poses little threat to the United States, as Alaska is at its most extreme range … and that distance most likely makes the missile’s payload lighter than normal, as well as reduces its accuracy.”
Christopher Tomaszewski, a first-year in general CIT and dual citizen who has lived in Eastern Europe, agreed, arguing that the United States and its allies already have some counter-measures. “In Poland, despite being an unpopular proposal, America previously received permission to deploy an ABS [anti-ballistic missile] system for defense against non-ICBM [intercontinental ballistic missile] missiles. Such systems have also been deployed in East Asia. At the beginning of the Iraq war, these systems shot down 100 percent of the 11 missiles that were fired.”
Students familiar with the region report that those closer to the situation are understandably more concerned.
Risa Masuda, a junior business administration major, speaking on reactions in Japan, said that “people in Japan are concerned with the harm that could happen if something went wrong with ongoing negotiations and North Korea had developed a missile that was capable of hitting targets within the country.”
Ultimately, North Korea’s true motivations in this launch remain unclear. What is certain, however, is that a launch at this time, as Clinton has clearly stated, the Obama administration does not approve of North Korea’s use of such tactics.

Efraín Amaya, a faculty member at Carnegie Mellon’s School of Music, celebrated the release of his two chamber opera CDs, Phantasmagorilla? No! Phantasmagoria and Clepsydra with a CD signing at Borders Books in Penn Circle on Sunday. The CD was officially released Feb. 1. Special performers at the event included opera singers Jeanne Wentworth and Douglas Ahlstedt, associate voice professor at the School of Music, as well as the Point Chamber Orchestra, founded and directed by Amaya.
Phantasmagorilla? No! Phantasmagoria is a children’s opera featuring Latin and hip-hop sounds. The opera's main character, a little boy named Henry, attends The Ghosts of the Opera with his parents and drifts into a deep sleep. The performance details the intensity of Henry’s daydreams and the ways in which they combine with the opera that he is currently watching. Phantasmagorilla? No! Phantasmagoria is a family creation, as Amaya’s wife wrote the libretto and his son stars as Henry.
Clepsydra is a more philosophical opera described as a journey through time in the fusion of sound and visual arts. It first premiered at Pittsburgh’s “First Night” celebration in 1999 and, like Phantasmagorilla, was written by Amaya’s wife. 
Amaya’s compositions have been featured at several international festivals, including the Seattle Symphony’s Viva La Musica Festival and the Annual National Flute Association Conventions. 
On Feb. 23, Carnegie Mellon announced its lowest tuition increase since 1975 — just 2.94 percent. The university's main motivation for the low tuition hike was to help ease the economy’s effect on students and their families, according to a University press release. 
Each year, the university has raised prices in a tiered manner, with last year’s increase just over 6 percent, according to a University press release.
Incoming first-year students in the fall of 2009 will pay $40,300. Tuition will be $36,832 for students who came in 2004 and 2005, $38,088 for 2006, $39,650 for 2007, and $40,300 for 2008. 
The university has undertaken several projects in the past few months to sustain and cut down costs on existing programs, including departmental budgets, the School of Computer Science Complex, and other university-wide projects.
The $1 billion Capital Campaign publicly launched at this year’s Homecoming has already raised about $565 million.
Carnegie Mellon Vice President for Campus Affairs Michael Murphy said that the university was careful to consider all of its available options and weigh input from parents and students to determine where to cut the budget and how to raise the tuition prices.
Rising tuition costs have not affected the volume of applications received for the fall: as of Feb. 1, Carnegie Mellon received 22,780 applications for 1,360 spots in the incoming first-year class.

Sometimes, I take things to their extremes.
I don’t just stay up late; I pull two all-nighters in a row. I don’t cheer patiently at the finish line on race day for Buggy; I scream louder than anyone else standing along the side of the course on Frew Street. And I don’t just self-define a major; I take on a disparate secondary major and an involved minor as well.
Good or bad, many Carnegie Mellon students are like me in this way. We balance rigorous course loads with seven extracurricular activities and community service on the weekends. We do graduate-level research as undergraduates while combining three majors between H&SS, MCS, and Tepper and found three service-oriented student organizations. It’s always challenging, and it’s always over the top.
But one combination that is not so over the top — and yet is so uncommon on this campus — is studying both art and architecture. These fields are implicitly related: Stronger architects have an understanding of and preferably a background in fine arts; better artists have a constantly evolving understanding of the constructed world. It seems obvious to me that art and architecture are interrelated, but if this is true, why are the curricula of each so divergent? In this vein, why is it so rare for students of each school to dabble in the courses of the other?
Now, I’ve written about the importance of respecting and promoting interdisciplinary study before (please forgive my shameless plug for an article I wrote with Contributing Editor Claire Morgenstern last February, “Interdisciplinary Students Ignored,” which is available at www.thetartan.org). What we argued then, I will reiterate now: Students with several distinct academic interests should be encouraged and aided by advisors, professors, and academic departments to combine those fields of study, so long as the fields of study can be at least remotely related to one another. Uniting two fields of study can make a singular academic career infinitely more dynamic and productive.
But for the Schools of Architecture and Art, this benefit of interdisciplinary study should be obvious, and implemented with much more frequency between the two schools than it is in reality.
Like a significant number of students in the School of Architecture, I have a background in fine arts. Throughout high school, I took several painting, drawing, photography, and digital media courses. While my interests have grown toward the direction of urban design and development, rather than the mixed media paintings I used to create, I still want art to continue to be a part of my academic life. Yes, architecture is art, and perhaps the inverse argument could even be made as well. But, strictly speaking, I wish my architecture courses had been supplemented by at least a painting or a drawing class in the School of Art, along with a mix of students from all schools in the College of Fine Arts.
My suggestion of this combination — either supplementing a degree in architecture with a painting or drawing class or supplementing a major in art with a class in architectural theory or urban design — is not meant simply for those of us with self-diagnosed academic attention deficit disorder. The curricula for both majors, as they stand, are created to be as multi-disciplinary as possible and, for the most part, succeed in this endeavor.
While I cannot make this argument from the perspective of an art major, as a student in the School of Architecture, I believe that the lack of inter-school coursework between the Schools of Art and Architecture depends on coordination from both parties. That is, the School of Architecture should provide incentives for its students to take a painting course, but for this to happen, the School of Art should create media-based courses for non-art majors within CFA or other creativity-based majors. More media-based studios — an acrylic and oil painting course that explores a variety of themes, particularly those relevant to architecture or other majors in CFA, for example — should be created and easily accessible to those of us whose art, whose canvas, is the physical environment around us.
This is also not to say that partnerships between the two schools are completely unheard of. On Jan. 22, Peter Fend, the founder of the Ocean Earth Development Corporation, lectured to both the Schools of Architecture and Art on campus. While Fend was a special breed of over-the-top (I don’t want to accuse anyone of being crazy, but… all right), he did bring together faculty and students of both schools in a discussion about the environment, explaining his perception of how each field should influence the other. More lectures of this sort (or, at least, lectures with this emphasis but with more lucid presentations) should become the norm. An art-architecture collaboration should be seen and felt more frequently on campus.
Jessica Thurston (*jthursto@) was 2008 Forum Editor of The Tartan, and is a senior urban design major. She can’t wait to graduate — and have time to paint again.*

At Carnegie Mellon, “diversity” is a word that we hear all the time; some might even argue that we hear it too often. It seems like it’s a word that has become almost meaningless, as we read it on every glossy pamphlet and booklet describing our university and the people who attend it. Maybe because we have become so accustomed to it, we forget that not everyone puts such an emphasis on diversity, and thus not everyone is so open to it. This is a fact I was rudely reminded of recently.
Last month, the BBC children’s show, CBeebies, hired a new team of hosts. This may not seem like breaking news, and really, it shouldn’t be. Parents have taken to the show’s website, however, to express their indignation and doubts about the new team that was chosen to present the show, and not because they miss the old hosts and are unhappy about the quick-change act that the show pulled. No, parents are complaining about one of the new hosts, Cerrie, because she was born with only one fully formed arm.
While the comments are no longer visible on the show’s website, as they were recently removed by the site’s moderators, one of The New York Times’s blogs on Feb. 23 showed a number of posts that littered the site before they were removed. The posts complained that the show was trying to be too “politically correct,” and one post stated that the children’s show was not the right place to be highlighting people’s differences, while another complained that her child was “upset and confused” by Cerrie’s disability. While not all posts were negative against Cerrie, the sheer number of them that were was what really surprised me.
Excuse me if I don’t believe that it is a desire to be “politically correct” that caused the station to choose Cerrie to be on the show, but rather the fact that maybe, just maybe, she was the best candidate for the job. I fail to see what, exactly, is only “politically” correct about allowing someone to chase her dreams, have a job, and live her life. I don’t see what place could be better than a television show to highlight people’s differences in a subtle way — the show didn’t morph to one that only discussed topics about disabilities just because one of the hosts has one. Rather, it is a way to show children that everyone is different, but that doesn’t mean that similarities don’t exist as well.
Furthermore, I could not disagree more with the posts that stated that the children who were watching the show were “upset and confused” about Cerrie. Confused, yes, certainly; children are confused about a lot of things. And inquisitive, definitely; kids will continue to ask “why?” to every answer you give them. But upset? That I highly doubt.
Children are usually the most open and accepting when interacting with people with disabilities. Little kids will still come up to me, in the mall or in line at a store, and ask me why I’m in a wheelchair,  what happened, and how long I’ve been in my chair — but it is always a youthful, innocent curiosity, and I’ve never seen a kid get upset by seeing me in a wheelchair. Kids are not the ones who will whisper comments to their friend about “that girl in the wheelchair” running them over when I am less than two feet away from them (and traveling at a snail’s pace with no chance of collision, might I add).
And in response to the viewer with user name brightroddydoddy, who posted on the show’s discussion board that “There’s a time and place for showing kids all the ‘differences’ that people can have, but nine in the morning, in front of a two-year-old, is not the place,” I am in complete accord with a different user of the site. Kath1970 explained that her three-year-old daughter “has a congenital upper-limb deficiency just like Cerrie’s. It’s there at nine in the morning, it’s also there at pre-school, it’s there at the supermarket, and it’s there when we go on holiday.” People with disabilities live with them 24/7, not just when they’re convenient, and whether or not some parents want to deal with explaining to their children what a disability is at nine in the morning doesn’t mean that disabilities need to be pointedly ignored.
The show provides a way for children to learn about disabilities, and to see the many differences that people can have, but also provides a way for people to see that these differences don’t have to stop someone from having a normal life. By seeing the host act just the way any other host would, the kids watching the show get to see that, though Cerrie might look a little different from other people on TV, that doesn’t mean she can’t do things that other people can.
Instead of getting flustered, confused, and upset, parents of the kids watching the show should take this golden opportunity for what it is and use it as the chance to explain to their children that everyone is different, whether it’s because they have blonde hair and blue eyes, are in a wheelchair, or only have one arm.
I hope that the station keeps Cerrie as a host for CBeebies long enough for the parents to realize that maybe it’s they who are the most uncomfortable with the change on the show, not their children. I also hope that the parents are able to change their opinions before their negativity and discriminatory comments do start affecting their children’s thoughts and actions.

Last week, during a routine set of crunches in the UC gym, I was unsuspectingly assaulted by a complete stranger, otherwise known as a fellow member of our campus community. While I was sprawled out on that germ-laden mat in the corner of the room in between two similarly sprawled-out fellow gym-goers, a male student doing a brief walk-by stopped, stared at me, and cocked his head to one side so he could get a better look up my shorts.
There is no one more aware of the chronic shortage of women at Carnegie Mellon than women themselves. But gentlemen, please. We know that fighting for women-only gym hours at a place like Carnegie Mellon is a losing battle, but try to keep the UC gym a gawk-free zone. Tighten that slack jaw. Eyes on our sweat-laden faces. Shooting a glance in the direction of a member of the opposite sex that isn’t met with a dirty look is a delicate operation. So, male patrons of the UC gym, as in any athletic activity, remember that it’s important to play by the rules.
1. Don’t make us regret paying for cheap workout gear. Although less fashionably challenged, we too are poor college students. Dick’s and Target are two of our favorite stores. Don’t enter the gym planning to capitalize on a poorly fitting sports bra or see-through T-shirt.
2. Remember that we feel ugly. Being sweaty and out of breath does not make us feel attractive. Some of us may keep gym clothes in our lockers that we unwrinkle and wear over and over again, without washing them. The last thing we want to concentrate on in the midst of a workout is how cute we look. Please, let us slip out unnoticed if we wish.
3. Stop with the sound effects. All we want to do is work out next to you, not have your children. We see that you’re benching a lot of weight and we’re not impressed. Letting out strange orgasm-like grunting noises is only going to make us more determined not to think about what you’d be like in bed.
4. If you see something, say something. It worked for the Metropolitan Transit Authority after the 9/11 terror attacks. If you’re going to have the nerve to cast sideways glances at us, at least have the balls to come up to us and ask us something meaningless, like how we think the Pens are doing. Otherwise, we’ll just think you’re sketchy.
5. Things jiggle. Get over it. No one really wants to see their brain on drugs, as the campaign goes, but we know it’s hard to resist watching a girl’s butt on an elliptical trainer. Sometimes we have fat. It moves independently of us. It’s beyond our control. Try walking in front of a mirror sometime.
6. If you wouldn’t do it to your sister, don’t do it to us. This is where the looking-up-the-shorts incident fits in. This is not seventh grade. We will not wear shorts under our dress. We will not cross our arms over our chests. We trust you not to exploit us.
7. What we don’t know won’t hurt us. So make sure we don’t know. If you’ve gotta sneak a peek, at least be discreet about it.
8. We might not even be looking at you. We’re probably looking at the clock above your head. Especially if you happen to be checking yourself out in the mirror at the same time.
9. We’re people, too. The next time you see a girl you could be interested in, try talking to her. Ask her what she’s reading. Offer her an extra disinfecting wipe. On a good day, she might even talk back.
Claire Morgenstern (*cmorgens@) welcomes all reasonable responses. If you see her in the UC gym, stop looking.*

The night that the Steelers won their sixth Super Bowl is not likely to be one that many Pittsburgh students forget. Not only was the occasion momentous, but the celebration, namely the rioting, that occurred afterward had people and papers alike buzzing for weeks.
You’ve heard the stories. Couches were burnt and bus stops vanished — the list of mob madness goes on. Still, it’s old news. It was a crazy night, and the results are visible, but it’s not as exciting as it initially was. At least we have the memories.
Two suspended students at Pitt and a third facing the same punishment for their participation in the night’s rioting might wish that’s all we had.
According to The Pitt News, Pitt’s Division of Student Affairs used Facebook, YouTube, and other sites “as jumping points for investigations.” While it states that arrests haven’t been made solely on evidence from Facebook, etc., the sentiment is nonetheless disconcerting.
Information put on the Internet has always been out of our control. Whether the students who were investigated in those photos posted them themselves or were tagged by their friends doesn’t matter: They were identified, and that identification was used to hold them responsible for their actions.
You’ve heard this countless times before: be careful of what you post online. Are University of Pittsburgh officials or police to blame for being able to effectively use computers? No. Is it an invasion of privacy to look into what students are posting? No. Information is free.
Gone are the days when we can commit damnatio memoriae. We have to assume that once we’ve posted something on the Internet, it’s going to stick around long after the profiles have been deleted. Sound paranoid? Sure. But it gives us a clearer picture of reality than assuming that we can keep our online musings private.
Information is traveling faster than ever, and privacy is becoming something that you have to seek out rather than lapse into. Even holing up in a cave somewhere, while extreme, holds little charm anymore: with Google Maps, your refuge is just a few clicks away.
This is the loss of privacy on a much larger scale, signifying a drastic change in the way we live our lives. Cell phones allow us to be reached at a moment’s notice. And as we have seen above, revelry gone riotous is documented not long after to online friends and acquaintances.
The suspension of the two Pitt students is not an invasion of privacy, but rather an invasion of high-speed information into our lives. We were not always bombarded with information or constantly pestered for updates over Internet sites like Facebook. Technological advances are a wonderful thing, but we must also be aware of how much it impacts our lives.
While we can chose not to post certain information online, how much of our lives can we truly call private any more? With every new advance in technology that occurs, the concept of anything being “private” is eroding. It is slowly vanishing, but it is vanishing nonetheless.
Alex Yuschik (*ahy@) strongly recommends against becoming a hermit. Getting takeout delivered is a pain.*

In the United Arab Emirates (UAE), maintaining the integrity of the press comes with a price.
The government of the UAE, the country home to such headlining emirates as Dubai and its more civic-oriented, conservative neighbor Abu Dhabi, is considering legislation that would make it illegal to publicize reports that could damage the country’s economic reputation in any way. In the UAE, the government is a federation through which particular powers are delegated to the federal government and the seven emirates. Dubai is the seemingly untouchable fairyland of tourism, real estate, economic power, and immunity, yet as it is plagued by the world’s economic downturn, journalists are coming under fire.
This drafted media law would make what the government sees as economic libel or slander punishable by fines of up to 1 million dirhams, or about $272,000 in the United States.
While the emirate’s outlook may not be pretty, or even predictable, it is imperative that freedom and integrity of the press be protected. Moreover, the UAE can only regulate internal media; external journalistic sources — such as this university newspaper — will be able to continue to acknowledge the economic weaknesses and strengths impacting Dubai, largely acknowledged to be the country’s most liberal and economically successful emirate. In this vein, the ban will have limited functionality in protecting the image of the UAE’s economy while causing damage to its international reputation as one of the more liberal Middle Eastern emirates.
Dubai’s image may be that of untouchable and unstoppable growth, but its reputation is not — and the government shouldn’t further tarnish its image by squandering journalistic freedom. Expatriates recently out of work due to economic woes are being hit hard in the region; Dubai has a law that foreigners who lose their work visas must leave the country within one month of doing so, which is causing a widespread frenzy in the increasingly empty global city. These out-of-work expatriates came to Dubai looking for successful lives of splendor and instead found lives of squalor due to the poor economy. This scenario, however, tarnishes Dubai’s perfect image, and it is stories like these that the government in the UAE hopes to censor. 
Some journalists and economists theorize that the UAE’s government, based in Abu Dhabi, is attempting to centralize the government and to downplay — and possibly eliminate — the liberal policies of Dubai in comparison to the rest of the country and Gulf region, and that it is restricting journalistic freedom as part of this centralization. Whatever the cause, though, Dubai must ensure that this policy is reversed. As intimidating as it may be to admit that Dubai — the seemingly protected city of upper-tier commerce and elite tourism — is also affected by the global recession, the UAE cannot hide behind the typically restrictive journalistic policies of the region. 
On the other side of the spectrum of freedom of expression, however, is Carnegie Mellon, which is the first of the top 25 American universities to receive a green-light rating in free speech by the Foundation for Individual Rights in Education (FIRE). In FIRE’s The Torch, Samantha Harris explained in a Feb. 3 article titled “The State of Free Speech on Campus: Carnegie Mellon University” that, while there is still room for improvement in several of the university’s policies, FIRE “found no policies that seriously imperil student speech on campus.”
While this university is by no means on the same scale as the internationally recognized city of Dubai, and its population is not affected by the economic downturn as extremely as are Dubai’s recently out-of-work expatriates, we are happy that Carnegie Mellon respects the freedom of speech, unlike the government of the UAE. We hope the university’s protection of free speech will extend to our campus in Qatar, and that students writing for the All-Around, the Doha campus’s student newspaper, are spared from the looming ban.

The Oscars aired last Sunday with Hugh Jackman playing host, singer, dancer, and overall entertainer of the night.
Even with his amusing antics, the show proceeded in a very orderly fashion with much more organization than the Golden Globes. Perhaps the Academy saw that debacle in January and decided the Oscars would do a better job by hiring a director for their ceremony for the first time. 
This simple change to the format of the long-standing awards show led to a much cleaner-run show. Just as this change positively affected the show, we believe that there is another change that the Academy should put into place as well.
With Slumdog Millionaire raking in a grand total of eight Oscars, we can’t help but wonder if any of the other films in consideration even made it close to winning an award. 
We think the Academy should take after the Obama administration and give viewers a little transparency — when a winner is announced in a category, the other four nominated films could be displayed, in order of number of votes. Or even better, the exact number of votes for each movie could be shown, rather than just ranking them.
This transparency in the voting for the Oscars would fix a number of misconceptions people have about the award show. While the Academy is composed of over 6000 members who are involved in the process of selecting Oscar nominees and winners, they sometimes come off as a very exclusive, selective board of people who choose movies that they like to watch and give them awards.
Just as statistics saturated computer and television screens during this past election season, they could also bring a welcome source of transparency and insight to the Oscars, a process historically shrouded in elitist secrecy.

On Feb. 10, a professor of economics and finance and of engineering and public policy, Lester B. Lave, testified at a hearing of the U.S. Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources in Washington, D.C. Lave primarily discussed the importance of reducing carbon dioxide emissions during the generation of electricity. He also suggested that the committee allow alternative technologies to compete in order to achieve a reduction in carbon dioxide levels and also to improve the overall quality of the environment.
We think it’s great that Carnegie Mellon’s voice is being heard outside of our campus community and that the university is contributing in some way to the policies that the government makes.
Lave’s contribution at the hearing was not only important in terms of developing sustainable technology, but also served as a token of pride for the entire campus community. This shows that Carnegie Mellon is now fighting on a national level for ideals that we already uphold on our own campus.

Hey Tartans,
Hope that midterms are going well! If not, remember that spring break is only a few days away!
With only 10 weeks left in our term, Pooja and I are beginning to narrow down the final projects that we’d like to accomplish this semester. In the coming weeks, we will be finalizing our safety task force report, working on some policy changes for student government, and looking into lobbying efforts. This week, I’d like to talk about an initiative that Pooja and I have been working on — the StuGov Loop Bus.
Originally discussed in our platform last spring, Pooja and I have received the funding and approval to pilot a weekend, nighttime Loop Bus for Carnegie Mellon students from March 20 through May 9. The Loop Bus, which is somewhat mirrored off the old Port Authority UV Loop and a shuttle service called the SGA Loop sponsored on Duquesne’s campus, allows all undergraduate and graduate students of Carnegie Mellon to ride free of charge on a nighttime shuttle to explore other Pittsburgh neighborhoods.
While the long-term vision of the bus is to expand to a number of neighborhoods in Pittsburgh, the pilot program will include stops at Forbes and Grant (downtown), Station Square, two stops along Carson Street in the South Side, and the SouthSide Works. Because of the current unreliability and nonexistence of Port Authority buses, students who go to Station Square or the South Side are forced to take taxis or pay $12 a person for DDLimos, which frankly doesn’t make sense. This, in addition to safety concerns, is the reason why we think that the StuGov Loop Bus will be a great service for students.
The bus will leave hourly from the UC turnaround on Friday and Saturday nights from 7 p.m. to 9 p.m. and on the half-hour from 10:30 p.m. to 2:30 a.m. The last ride will arrive back to campus around 3:15 a.m. Watch out for our LOOP campaign in the coming weeks and check out our newly revamped website: stugov.andrew.cmu.edu/executive, the first permanent Executive Branch website, for more information.
In closing, hopefully many of you have noticed that petitions to run for Student Body President, Student Body Vice President for Finance, or Student Senate are available at the UC Info Desk and due tomorrow at 5 p.m. Yes, they are due tomorrow — but you still have time! I promise, filling out a petition won’t take you more than one night. Having a represented voice for students is that important — and the sky really is the limit on projects that you can work on!
