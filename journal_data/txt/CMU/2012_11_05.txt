After a poor offensive showing against the Washington University in St. Louis Bears two weekends ago, the Tartans rediscovered the offense that had them at 4–0 by the end of September.
The Tartans played the University of Chicago Maroons on Saturday in their last home game of the season, defeating them 31–14 due to a tremendous rushing performance.     
This victory brings the Tartans to 6–3 in the season and 1–1 in conference play.
The Maroons’ season fell to 4–5 in the season and 0–2 in conference play.
Senior running back Patrick Blanks lead the Tartans in their victory over the Maroons with his 159 rushing yards and three touchdowns, the Tartans put together 235 yards of positive offense on the ground.
Blanks is averaging 82.6 rushing yards per game and has scored 10 touchdowns this season, both of which are highs on the team.
This was the fifth time in Blanks’ career and the third time this season that he rushed for three touchdowns in a single game.
“It was clearer [Saturday] than ever before how much Patrick means to our offense and the team,” junior quarterback Rob Kalkstein said. “We are a different team when he is on the field.”
The Carnegie Mellon frontline defense held the Maroons’ rushing attack to just 71 total yards, accumulating eight tackles for losses and two sacks.
Junior inside linebacker Akwasi Brefo led the squad with 10 tackles.
Junior defensive lineman Ryan Jok’s aggressive play on the line resulted in two tackles for a loss.
Junior wide receiver Tim Kikta inched closer to the Carnegie Mellon receiving yards record, putting in 31 yards on Saturday.
With 32 receiving yards left for the upcoming game against Case Western Reserve University, he has the potential to break the record very soon.
First-year kicker Connor Young kicked a career-long 45-yard field goal in the third to put the Tartans up 17–14. Carnegie Mellon never relinquished the lead after that score.
On Saturday, the Tartans will close this year’s campaign on the road against the Case Western Reserve Spartans. Kickoff is at 2 p.m.
Last season, the Tartans lost to the Spartans in a shootout, losing by a score of 38–24. 
If the Carnegie Mellon offense can put up offensive numbers reminiscent of those in their performance against the Maroons this past Saturday, the Spartans should prove to be no problem for the Tartans.

Junior wide receiver Tim Kikta is a big man on campus. At 6'3" and nearly 200 pounds, the towering Tartan football superstar has been one of the top contributors this season and is a critical member of Carnegie Mellon’s team.
The Pittsburgh native is also one of the team’s top scorers, with five touchdowns this season.
Kikta was named the University Athletic Association and Eastern College Athletic Conference Southwest Athlete of the Week during the second week of September, prompted by his performance during the Tartans’ 37–7 victory.
He set a Carnegie Mellon single-game record with 158 receiving yards in the game. Kikta caught four passes that game, including touchdown receptions of 82 and 39 yards from junior quarterback Rob Kalkstein. The 82-yard score was the longest touchdown reception by a Tartan since 2004.
“Tim has been a great offensive player this year. I can’t even tell you how many times I’ve thrown a pass and he’s been right there to make an amazing catch,” Kalkstein said. “He also has made a number of touchdowns over 50 yards, which is outstanding.”
Kikta does not brag about his personal achievements; rather, he focuses on the historic season for the team. The Tartans went 4–0 at the beginning of the season for the first time since 2006.
“This year has been an awesome one for us,” he said. “From the start, I felt like it was going to be a great season.” He attributed the success of the team to the return of “a lot of starters” and recognized “the giant improvement between this year and previous ones.”
Although the Tartans had a phenomenal start, the team has faltered, dropping to a 5–3 record. But still, team-focused Kikta is optimistic about the remainder of the season.
“We lost a lot of key running backs and middle backers due to injuries,” he said. “But we are trying to get them back in shape as soon as we can.”
Kikta is certainly no stranger to the world of football, having played since second grade.
“I love the camaraderie of the sport,” he said. “Getting to know [my teammates] is certainly my favorite part of playing. It truly is the ultimate team sport.”
His teammates also admire him for his optimism and dedication. “Big Time Timmy Tim,” Kalkstein said, “always brings a positive attitude. In the huddle he knows exactly what to say. He is always into the game, and helps us stay focused.”
Kikta said that during his nearly 15 years of playing football, he has “grown so much as a player,” and has especially come a long way during his college career. “One game during freshman year, I lined up on the wrong side of the ball three times,” he said. “I tried to convince coach that the quarterback [Kalkstein] called the play wrong when really I was totally and completely at fault.”
Kikta and Kalkstein have become close friends since their first year at Carnegie Mellon. Both had internships in Pittsburgh over the summer and are currently roommates. “We would always practice passing over the summer, which I really think helped our chemistry this year,” Kalkstein said.
Kikta is currently a mechanical engineering major and hopes to work with cars and airplanes. “I would love to design vehicles,” he said. “Right now, I’m looking for internships where I would get to explore my passion for vehicles and engineering even more.”
For Kikta, football serves as a stress reliever from Carnegie Mellon’s heavy workload. From Friday night dinners with the never-ending pasta bowl at Olive Garden to “having our offensive coordinator drive us around the field in his golf cart,” Kikta said he’s “become best friends with these guys.”
Kikta and the team will take the field for the last time this season for the away game against Case Western Reserve University on Saturday.

The men’s and women’s swimming and diving teams dove into their first home meet of the season last weekend. The Tartans hosted the Division-II Clarion University Golden Eagles. The men’s team crushed Clarion University 202–97, while the women’s team fell 198–102.
The men took first in many events and swept some events entirely. The first-years got their first taste of competition at home, with many of them responsible for first-place finishes. First-year Christopher Wysocki took first place in the 1,000-yard freestyle with a time of 9:56.82. In the 200-yard freestyle, first-year Steven Geier took first place with a time of 1:46.62.
The 200-yard medley relay team of sophomore Josh Lucheon, sophomore Cole Um, junior Terrence Wong, and first-year Lucas Bruder finished in 1:37.22. The 200-yard freestyle relay team of Bruder, Wong, first-year Carter Sharer, and junior Edward Sears also took first, finishing in 1:27.34.
The Tartan women, despite losing, still had first-place finishes from junior Soleil Phan, who won the 100-yard butterfly in 58.99, and junior Megan Garvey, who won the 500-yard freestyle in 5:21.06. Phan also finished second in the 200-yard freestyle with a time of 1:55.60 and in the 200-yard individual medley in 2:12.62. Meanwhile, Garvey also placed second in the 200-yard butterfly with a time of 2:11.92.
The women’s team saw strong finishes from its first-years. First-year Felicia Wang had two second-place finishes for the Tartans in breaststroke events. The first was in the 100-yard breaststroke with a time of 1:08.47, and the second was in the 200-yard breaststroke with a time of 2:32.53. First-year Kira Singhaus recorded another Tartan second-place finish in the 100-yard backstroke with a time of 1:00.14.
In the diving pool, first-year Winona Li had the best finish for the Tartans with her fifth-place finish off the one-meter board.
“I think we’re doing great for this point in the season. This is the point where training gets really intense, but everyone was pushing through during the meet and I feel like our team is really coming together,” sophomore Nicole Crimi said.
The men’s and women’s teams will host Grove City College on Saturday.

The Tartan men’s soccer team fell just short of taking the number one spot in the University Athletic Association (UAA) in its game against the Emory University Eagles on Saturday night.
The final score was 1–0, leaving Carnegie Mellon in a four-way tie with Brandeis University, Washington University at St. Louis, and Emory University for first place in conference play.
The game was hard fought and very physical. There was a total of 29 fouls called, 15 of which were from Carnegie Mellon.
The first half concluded with a score of 0–0 due to the tough defense of both teams.
While there were no goals in the first half of the game, the Eagles attempted six shots, and the Tartans attempted three.
Twenty–seven minutes into the second half, the Eagles attempted their seventh shot of the half and connected with the net.
With the remaining 18 minutes, the Tartans took two unsuccessful shots. Junior midfielder Chris Wysocki took the first shot, which was just wide of the goal; senior midfielder John Crawshaw took the second shot, which was saved by Emory’s keeper.
Carnegie Mellon’s goalkeeper, junior Christopher Madden, made four saves throughout the game.
“We were off our game and couldn’t find a rhythm. [It was] one of the few games in which that’s happened to us. Unfortunately for us, Emory was on their game and took advantage of our average performance,” senior defender Alex Abedian said.
The Tartans concluded their regular season play with a record of 12–3–1 and a UAA record of 4–2–1. Carnegie Mellon will be entering post-season play and will receive its bid as of 1:30 p.m. on Monday.

The women’s soccer team tied with the Emory University Eagles 0–0, finishing the season in second place in the University Athletic Association Championships play. The Tartans’ overall record is 11–1–4, making them No. 19 in the nation, while the No. 8 Eagles finished their season 11–1–6.
Sophomore midfielder Jordyn Greenburg and junior defender Rachel Contopoulos made many goal attempts during the first period of Saturday’s game, but Emory’s goalkeeper, senior Kaele Leonard, did not give the Tartans a chance to score.
Emory’s defensive strength was equally matched by a strong Carnegie Mellon defense. Junior goalkeeper Anna Albi was a critical player for the Tartans, making a total of nine saves, including six in the second period.
Her final save of the game in the 105th minute marked her sixth shutout of the season.
In the second period, junior forward Alex Veneagas, senior midfielder Katie Davis, and first-year Carson Quiros also made several goal attempts.
“I am so proud of our team for playing so well against a great Emory team. We showed heart and proved we can play with the best team in the country. We are a special team that hopefully will get the chance to keep playing in the NCAAs,” senior midfielder Stephanie Hare said.
The Tartans will now await the selection of the field for the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) Division-III Women’s Soccer Tournament, as the team hopes to receive an at-large bid to the Championship draw. 
Fans can watch the NCAA Championship Selection Show online at www.ncaa.com on Monday at 1:30 p.m.

Carnegie Mellon’s volleyball team competed in the University Athletic Association (UAA) tournament last week, playing Case Western Reserve University on Friday and the University of Rochester on Saturday.
In the first game against Case Western Reserve, the Tartans won 25–19, but then lost the next two games 25–15 and 25–13, respectively.
With a 25–20 win in the fourth game, the Tartans forced a tie-breaking fifth game. But the Tartans came up short, losing that game 15–11.
Sophomore right side hitter Ali Celentano gave a strong performance, recording 30 kills in this match. First-year setter Emily Lawlis racked up 26 assists and junior setter Emily Wright added 15. Junior defensive specialist Ali Nichols led the defense with 21 digs, and junior outside hitter Rachel Miller had 17.
The loss put the Tartans in the fifth-place consolation match on Saturday against the University of Rochester Yellowjackets.
Every game in Saturday’s match was tightly contested. The Tartans won the first match 25–22 before dropping the second one 28–26. Then they won the third game 29–27, lost the fourth 25–13, and closed out the match with the victory in game five with 15–9.
Celentano topped her performance on Friday, accumulating 36 kills in this match to lead the Tartans to their 3–2 victory. She also added 19 digs. Junior outside hitter Senna Parsa added 16 kills, and Miller had 12.
Nichols had 23 digs on the defensive end, Miller added 12, and Lawlis had 11. At the net, junior middle blocker Olivia Mora had six blocks.
“I’m proud of the team for playing their hardest, even up to the last match of the season,” said senior defensive specialist Kasey LaMothe.

While the NBA season kicked off Tuesday with a not-so-glamorous matchup of the Cleveland Cavaliers and the Washington Wizards, the league remains dominated by superstar-laden teams. In the off-season, fans saw the rapid player movement many expected after the lockout-shortened off-season of last year. As a result, almost all of the title contenders reshaped their cores to keep up in the talent arms race.
Starting in the Western Conference, the Los Angeles Lakers upgraded their point guard posse by adding two-time MVP Steve Nash in a trade with the Phoenix Suns to replace Ramon Sessions. The team also traded with the Orlando Magic for Dwight Howard, the unquestionably best center in the league, and gave up temperamental and injury-prone center Andrew Bynum to the Philadelphia 76ers. While on paper this team looks unstoppable, it has had issues meshing the talent between its aging superstars and new offensive scheme.
The Oklahoma City Thunder, which lost to the Miami Heat in the championship last year, focused more on setting itself up for the future by trading James Harden to the Houston Rockets for Kevin Martin, picking first-round choice Jeremy Lamb, and making two future first-round draft picks. With current superstars Kevin Durant and Russell Westbrook on the Thunder, Harden went from being the third-best player on his own team to the unquestioned star of the Rockets, which also signed point guard Jeremy Lin, who inspired last year’s Linsanity, from the New York Knicks.
The other Los Angeles team, the Clippers, focused on adding veteran talent to their young superstar core of forward Blake Griffin, point guard Chris Paul, and center DeAndre Jordan. By adding Lamar Odom and Jamal Crawford, the team improved its depth to complement its high-flying offense. 
Out in Denver, the Nuggets also added talent in the form of all-star forward Andre Iguodala as part of the multiteam Bynum trade. Iguodala is added to the young core of center JaVale McGee and point guard Ty Lawson. Coach George Karl has always been about pushing the ball on offense and encouraging aggressive hard-nosed defense, and now he finally has the players in place to make it work.
In the Eastern Conference, the defending champion Miami Heat continued to add pieces around its core of perennial all-stars LeBron James, Dwayne Wade, and Chris Bosh. Future hall-of-fame sharpshooter Ray Allen moved from the Boston Celtics to the Heat, giving Miami the corner jump-shooting threat. This, along with gaining Rashard Lewis, further intensified the team's rivalry with the Celtics.
The Celtics, after losing Allen, added Jared Sullinger and Fab Melo through the draft and jump shooter Jason Terry from the Dallas Mavericks through free agency. Boston is currently in the process of redefining its team as aging stars Paul Pierce and Kevin Garnett decline and point guard Rajon Rondo enters his prime. The Celtics are getting a big boost from players returning from injuries as forward Jeff Green and guard Avery Bradley are coming back from last year's season-ending injuries.
The Nets made the move from New Jersey to Brooklyn during the off-season and look to be a much better team this year. All-star point guard Deron Williams chose to resign during the off-season after the team traded for star guard Joe Johnson from the Atlanta Hawks. Center Brook Lopez is also returning from the broken foot and twisted ankle he suffered last season and will combine with forward Gerald Wallace to create Brooklyn’s core.
The 76ers destroyed their core from last year, but are still in line for a playoff spot. After trading Iguodala, losing Elton Brand to the Mavericks, and failing to resign point guard Lou Williams and letting him go to the Hawks, the 76ers appear to be in trouble. Not all is lost, however, as they added Bynum from the Lakers and shooting guard Jason Richardson from the Magic. Also, the 76ers' new young core of guards, Jrue Holliday and Evan Turner, have had another year to mature. 
This NBA season will likely be shaped by the flurry of off-season trades to try to dethrone the Heat. The key will be to see which teams can mesh their new identities and talent into a single power, and which ones fail to come together.

The men’s and women’s cross country teams traveled to Rochester, N.Y., on Oct. 27 to compete in the University Athletic Association (UAA) Championships hosted by the University of Rochester.
Both the men’s and women’s teams brought home third-place trophies.
Third place was quite the accomplishment for the women’s cross country team. The Tartans had not broken into the top three since 1998 when they took home the championship.
Three of the women finished within the top 14 of the 6k race. The top five race times were factored into the Tartans’ overall score of 103 points.
The first finisher was senior Emily Wobb, placing seventh overall with a time of 22:37.3.
Finishing just 4.8 seconds behind her in 10th place was junior Elise Hall. Sophomore Halley Bayer rounded out the top, finishing with 11th place.
First-year Rekha Schnepf’s time of 23:28.3 was factored into the Tartans’ score as well, as she took 35th place overall.
The last score for the Tartans came from senior Eva Humphrey in 44th place with a time of 23:37.3. This brought the Tartans’ grand total to 1:55:07.5.
“Getting third was unbelievable,” Hall said. “I definitely had high hopes, but I wasn’t really sure what to expect. Everything we had been working toward came together. As far as the rest of the season, we of course have our sights set on doing just as well at regionals to get us to nationals.”
The men’s cross country team competed in the 8k, also finishing third overall. The men also had three top-14 finishers, scoring a total of 65 points.
It was again up to the top five finishers to decide the team’s final score.
The first Tartan finisher was senior Evan Gates with a time of 25:16.4, earning him fourth place overall and the highest Tartan finish of UAAs. Just after Gates, junior Josh Newby took fifth place overall with a time of 25:20.2.
Junior Ken Murphy was the third finisher for the Tartans with a time of 25:43.0, putting him in 11th place overall.
The fourth and fifth finishers for Carnegie Mellon finished within 3.8 seconds of each other: Sophomore George Degen finished 20th with a time of 25:51.3 and senior Billy Littlefield finished 23rd overall with a time of 25:55.1. Together, the Tartans had a grand total time of 2:08:06.1.
The now No. 20-nationally ranked Tartans will travel this Saturday to NCAA Regional Championships in Carlisle, Pa., hosted by Dickinson College.

When someone mentions robots, popular representations such as R2-D2, Wall-E, or the Terminator may come to mind. But what if scientists could make robots so tiny they could navigate inside the human body? Metin Sitti, Carnegie Mellon professor in mechanical engineering and head of the Nanorobotics Lab, and Sehyuk Yim, a Ph.D. student in mechanical engineering, recently received funding for their research on medical capsule robots. 
Pill cameras that take pictures of the gastrointestinal tract after being swallowed have already been around for 11 years. These miniature cameras are FDA-approved and widely used in hospitals — but they do not have any functions beyond imaging.
“Imaging is good,” Sitti said, “but it’s a passive tablet you swallow that moves through your body naturally. If you miss something, you cannot go back. If you want to stay at one place longer, you can’t. If you want to do drug delivery or a biopsy, there is no way to do that because the capsule is not controlled.” 
Sitti and Yim wanted to engineer an active robotic capsule that could be controlled while inside the gastrointestinal tract. Some scientists utilize wired endoscopes, which are tubes with an attached light source, to illuminate an organ. While endoscopes can perform camera imaging, inject drugs, take tissue samples, and have heat probes, they are also highly invasive.
“We want to combine the advantages of wired endoscopes with all its functions and try to put that into the pill camera so we can have an active pill that can do all of these functions in a minimally invasive manner,” Sitti said. 
A popular idea in medical robots has been tiny rigid robots that can move inside the body using legs. To overcome the safety hazard of rigid robots, Yim decided to explore the idea of soft capsule robots made of a squishy material called elastomer. In addition to being safe inside the body, the shape of a soft robot can be easily changed. “Combining soft robotics with nanorobotics is a novelty,” Sitti said.
Sitti and Yim designed a robot with two heads that has an internal magnet at each end. Using an external magnet at a certain distance away from the robot, the capsule can be remotely controlled. By using magnetic fields to contract and expand the soft capsule after it has been swallowed, the tiny robot can roll and twist inside a patient’s stomach. 
The researchers hope to improve this concept by increasing the friction on the capsule’s surface — perhaps with adhesive fibers inspired by the fibers on geckos’ feet — so that it can move more easily on the mucus-covered stomach lining.
“You can put a drug chamber in the middle, and by changing the formation of the capsule, you can inject a drug,” Sitti said. Another function of the capsule is to inject biopsy microgrippers that come out and grab tissue by folding and contracting when exposed to body temperature. After the capsule leaves the body naturally, this tissue sample can be taken out and examined.
The building process for these tiny capsule robots takes a high level of precision. “I use a molding process,” Yim said. “These capsule robots are made of polymer material, so we have to use a 3-D printer, which is a rapid prototyping machine that works by layering of material. Using this, we make a mold that I can then pour a polymer into. After seven or eight hours, the elastomer is cured and I detach it from the mold and assemble the parts.”
By using this molding process, Yim is able to make many copies of the capsule robot in an inexpensive manner.
“We haven’t yet built a full prototype that we can try clinically on animals,” Sitti said. “We’ve just built prototypes for different functions.” With their new grant, Sitti and Yim hope to have this full prototype done within the next year. After it is approved by the FDA, which is a long process that will take approximately 10 years, Sitti and Yim can see their capsule robot being used for real-life applications. 
In the meantime, their in-progess soft capsule robot can be applied as a health monitoring system that works by giving the swallowed capsule the capability to detect what foods a person eats. This can benefit patients that have problems with their digestive tract.

Carnegie Mellon welcomed two 20 Under 20 Thiel Fellowship finalists into its class of first-years this fall. Obawole Idowu in the Carnegie Institute of Technology and Vijay Viswanathan in the Mellon College of Science spent four days in San Francisco this summer competing for a $100,000 fellowship; the competition is chronicled in the second season of the popular CNBC show 20 Under 20: Transforming Tomorrow.
Although neither won the grand prize, Idowu and Viswanathan still have a lot to boast about. Each has already accomplished more research than many Carnegie Mellon undergraduates in their respective fields.
For his presentation in the Lightning Pitch round of the competition, 15-year-old Idowu said, “My goal is to be disruptive in providing access to mobile technology.” His idea? A self-powering pair of smartphone sunglasses called Soul Aurum. The glasses would use solar array lenses and induction from coils wrapped around the frame, with an alloy that would change magnetic properties in warm climates.
This use of temperature and sun for power would make this type of technology ideal for its target audience: the mobile markets in Africa, Latin America, and Asia, where most of the world’s 1.5 billion people without electricity or internet live.
The topic of self-sustaining, mobile technology inspires Idowu not as a business strategy, but as an opportunity to do something good for the world. The reason he is interested in mobile devices that support the internet is because more people can be connected online and “share their ideas about how they can change the world,” he said.
Allowing those without easy access to electricity to have smartphone devices would provide them with more than just the advantages one takes for granted everyday. As Idowu explained, the benefit of communication is critical for the quality of life.
Such movements could have huge impacts on individuals in fields of business and medicine. Asha Thomas, a senior double majoring in business administration and global studies, agreed. From her three trips to underdeveloped communities in Panama with Carnegie Mellon’s Global Business Brigades, she experienced firsthand the type of environments that would benefit most from technologies like Soul Aurum.
“In all of the communities we visited, they had sparse electricity, if any at all,” she said. “One of the communities did have their few lights running on solar power, so that fact puts me at ease when thinking about the adoption of this technology in the communities.” It’s areas like these in Panama that Idowu hopes to help with further research.
Viswanathan’s research also has large goals. In a presentation he made called “Developing a Computational Model of Blood Platelet Morphology with Fluid Dynamics Applications,” Viswanathan described his work in creating geometric and 3-D computer models of blood platelets.
One of the problems with treating blood platelet disorders is that while much is known about the disorders on a chemical level, little is known about them physically. How they travel through blood is a fluid dynamics problem, and Viswanathan hopes that his 3-D models can help solve it.
One of the most prominent features of his model is its ability to calculate the coefficient of drag on a platelet. Drag is the resistive force of fluid — in this case blood —on a body as it moves; if two platelets have different drag coefficients, it means they have two different shapes. Blood platelets from two people could be different because of the presence of disease or even just from genetic variations.
“I can see a future of medicine which can become ‘personalized medicine’ and that could really save lives, because no two people are the same, and medicine should evolve to meet that,” Viswanathan said. “With simulations, that is much more doable than it is right now, and I believe that with my work, hematological problems dealing with blood issues can be solved in that way.”

Carnegie Mellon’s multidisciplinary approach allow s students from different fields of study to come together and work on projects. This past year, four students from the Carnegie Institute of Technology and the Mellon College of Science joined forces to participate in the International Genetically Engineered Machine (iGEM) Competition. The group enjoyed success at the regional level held in Pittsburgh and was selected as one of the four teams out of 43 to advance to the competition’s international jamboree this past weekend in Cambridge, Mass.
The team, which came together last October, consists of sophomore electrical and computer engineering and biomedical engineering double major Peter Wei; senior electrical and computer engineering and biomedical engineering double major Jesse Salazar; sophomore biological sciences major Eric Pederson; and junior chemical engineering and biomedical engineering double major Yang Choo.
Their instructors were Cheemeng Tan, a post-doctoral fellow with the Ray and Stephanie Lane Center for Computational Biology, and Natasa Miskov-Zivanov, an adjunct faculty member with the department of electrical and computer engineering.
The iGEM competition motivates students from around the world to develop projects in synthetic biology. Pederson explained it as “projects that take parts from different organisms and mixing them to get what you want qualify."
After spending a month exploring different project ideas for the competition, the team settled on a project that expanded on work researchers at Carnegie Mellon had already briefly explored. After securing lab time in March, the team finally got to work. Their research aimed to quantitatively measure the a cell’s amount of a protein that was discovered at Carnegie Mellon.
Pederson explained the science behind what their project aimed to accomplish: “Promoters are regions in our DNA that have regulatory functions that can impact what goes on inside our cells.” DNA codes for tens of thousands of proteins to be made by cells, but only a select number of these proteins will be made by the cells at any one time. The controlling factors are these promoter regions which act as on and off switches that tell the cell when to make or stop making a protein depending on if it is needed or not.
In modern biology, researchers incorporate and manipulate promoters in cells to increase or decrease the concentration of specific proteins to force a certain change within the cell. Pederson compared promoters to the engine of a car in “how a mechanic wouldn’t want to put a Hummer engine inside a Prius because it would destroy the chassis.” Similarly, a scientist wouldn’t want to use the wrong promoter to force a specific change in the cell because it might cause the wrong proteins to be made and cause the cell to die.
Once they had decided on a project, Tan and Pederson collected data through fluorescence microscopy, where certain dyes bind to proteins and glow. This allows researchers to use microscopes to measure the amount of dye present and subsequently determine how much protein is present in the cell. Wei explained that he used the data to “develop a quantitative measure using time course curves that pinpoint when all the dye has binded to the proteins in the cell.”
Currently, researchers can perform experiments such as Western Blotting and use protein purification techniques to collect the proteins in the cell and measure their concentration. However, these techniques require breaking open the cells to collect the proteins. The quantitative measures that the Carnegie Mellon iGEM team developed to measure utilized promoters and dyes didn’t require killing the cells; Pederson believes it “can save scientists a lot of extra work, time, and money.”
The multidisciplinary project allowed team members from a variety of backgrounds to get involved and contribute to its success. Wei said that before joining the project he had a small interest in biology, which motivated him to get involved. He felt that joining a project like this “was the most effective method to getting into a field you know nothing about.”
Both Pederson and Salazar felt that “the competition was just a prologue” and they felt very proud of how much they had already accomplished.

The GPS, or Global Positioning System, is an efficient tool that one may utilize for myriad causes. It is an ubiquitous object that is able to identify a current location and destination, give directions, and calculate the time and distance of a journey. How does such a small object complete such complex tasks?
Broadly, the GPS function is supported by clocks, signals, and mathematical concepts. The GPS system involves the receiver as well as 27 Earth-orbiting satellites, three of which are backups in case one fails. According to howstuffworks.com, the satellites rotate around the Earth twice a day so that different sets of at least four satellites are visible through a telescope at all times and in all places. The GPS receiver calculates a specific point on Earth by analyzing radio signals from GPS satellites.
Through 3-D trilateration, a mathematical principle that involves overlapping areas, the GPS can identify its current location by relying on its distance from a relative point on Earth and from at least three satellites. Because a satellite cannot determine the exact direction it receives the signal from a GPS, a sphere of possible locations is created, with the radius being the distance between the GPS and the satellite. So if a GPS connects with three or four satellites, four spheres of possible locations are generated. The intersection of these spheres on Earth is the location of the GPS.
But how does the GPS calculate the distance from the receiver to the satellite? The satellite contains an atomic clock that can be synchronized to the nanosecond, while the receiver contains a household clock that constantly resets. Because the household clock in the receiver initially makes proportionally incorrect time measurements using its own clock, the receiver resets and syncs with the satellite's correct time. Syncing to a correct time causes all received signals to align at a single point in space, which causes the other three satellites to have the same time.
After syncing, the satellite transmits a pseudo-random code, or a digital pattern, and the receiver begins running the same pattern. As the satellite’s signal reaches the receiver, transmission lags behind the receiver’s pattern run. The receiver determines its distance from the satellite by multiplying the lag by the speed of light.
To use the distance information, the GPS receiver refers to an internal almanac that records every satellite position at any given time. Any slight changes in the satellite orbit will be corrected and sent to the receivers by the Department of Defense.
Despite the intricate processes that appear to guarantee accuracy, satellites sometimes transmit unclear signals and faulty almanac information. In those cases, a Differential GPS (DGPS) — which is separate from the ones that everyday people use — identifies inaccuracies by calculating its location via satellite signals at its stationary receiver station, and then compares it to a known location.
The DGPS provides correct signal information by broadcasting a radio signal from its station to all DGPS-equipped receivers in the area. As a result, those roving GPS receivers will receive signals that inform them of any differences in calculation from the DGPS station and correct any faulty information. From there, those DGPSs communicate correct signal information to GPSs that civilians use.
It then sends a radio signal to all DGPS-equipped receivers, informing them of correct signal information. In general, the GPS picks up transmissions from at least four satellites and combines them with information in the electronic almanac to figure out the receiver’s position on Earth. When the position is calculated, the GPS can tell users the longitude, latitude, and altitude of their current positions and future destinations. 
So when you pull out your GPS  help you get to your relative’s house for Thanksgiving, you can thank complex mathematical principals for getting you where you need to be.

Elephant in South Korea ‘speaks’ basic phrases
Koshik, an elephant living at the Everland Zoo in South Korea, is able to emulate elementary Korean speech. By sticking his trunk into his mouth, Koshik is able to utter the five Korean words for “hello,” “sit down,” “no,” “lie down,” and “good.” Native speakers of the language are able to understand these utterances, so the elephant has become a popular tourist attraction. It is unlikely, however, that Koshik understands the words he says.
Although it’s unclear why Koshik makes the sounds, cognitive biologist Angela Stoeger believes “...that Koshik started to adapt his vocalizations to his human companions to strengthen his social affiliation with them.”

Tree of Life created for living bird species
Scientists have created a phylogenetic tree — a branching map of evolutionary relations between species — for all 9,993 of the world’s living bird species. 
“This is the first dated tree of life for a class of species this size to be put on a global map,” said Walter Jetz, an evolutionary biologist at Yale University who participated in the study. However, some scientists are critical of the tree, claiming that its sheer magnitude allows for the extrapolation of evolutionary trends that don’t exist. 
The tree was constructed based on the genetic information of around 6,600 species — the other 3,300 were grouped based on constraints such as genus membership.

Researchers find post-adolescent cyberbullying
A recent study by United Kingdom researchers at the University of Sheffield and Nottingham University reveals that cyberbullying still goes on long after adolescence: It is prominent in the workplace as well. Out of a survey conducted among 320 United Kingdom university employees, around eight out of 10 claimed to have been a victim of cyberbullying at least once in the past six months.
Another 14–20 percent claimed to be victims of cyberbullying on a weekly basis — a rate similar to that reported by those bullied in person. The researchers plan to release suggestions for ways employers can foster cyberbullying-free environments in the workplace.

MIT researchers reveal robotic arm prototype
Fans of the Spiderman supervillain Doctor Octopus are sure to appreciate the work of Federico Parietti and Harry Asada. The two Massachusetts Institute of Technology researchers are working on a prototype pair of wearable robotic arms that will use advanced algorithms to detect and facilitate the intent of its user. The research was funded by Boeing, and the scientists believe the arms could be very helpful to factory workers or those performing complex do-it-yourself tasks.
“It’s bold and out of keeping with anything I’ve ever seen to attach two arms to a human,” said Dave Barrett, a roboticist and mechanical engineer at Olin College in Needham, Mass.

Researchers observe light from earliest stars
Astronomers at the Stanford Linear Accelerator Center in California are claiming they have spotted light from the very first stars in the universe. These stars’ specific glow, known as extragalactic background light (EBL), comes from stars that existed when the universe was as young as 600 million years old — very early in its existence, compared to the universe’s present age of 13.7 billion years. The scientists did not measure the EBL directly, but instead detected it by analyzing measurements made by NASA’s Fermi Gamma-Ray Space Telescope.
Stars from this period in the universe’s history were more massive and burned brighter than today’s stars.

Android running on three out of four smartphones
The industry research firm International Data Corporation (IDC) released a report claiming that three out of every four smartphones runs a version of Google’s Android operating system. This is an increase from this time last year, when the statistic was at 57.5 percent.
“Google has a thriving, multifaceted product portfolio. Many of its competitors, with weaker tie-ins to the mobile OS, do not,” according to the IDC report. 
While Google widened the gap between rival Apple, most of the gains were made at the loss of sales by Blackberry and Symbian.

The Carnegie Mellon School of Drama has received its first ever National Endowments for the Humanities (NEH) grant, thanks to the research proposal of associate professor of dramatic literature Wendy Arons and her group of collaborators. The project, which will translate German philosopher Gotthold Ephraim Lessing’s Hamburgische Dramaturgie, is focused on both theater theory and translation, and has significant value in both fields.
The Award
Arons and three other scholars from around the country received a grant for $289,697 from the NEH’s Scholarly Editions and Translations Program. According to the NEH website, this program supports the “preparation of editions and translations of pre-existing texts and documents of value to the humanities that are currently inaccessible or available in inadequate editions.” Arons’ project fits this description perfectly, since only an incomplete English version of Hamburgische Dramaturgie is currently available: Not all of the 101 essays from the book have been translated, and those that have are missing significant parts.
Arons, a dedicated scholar of 18th-century German theater, had the idea for the project when a colleague mentioned that the current English translation of Hamburgische Dramaturgie was incomplete. “That was actually a surprise to me at the time ... and that piqued my interest. So at that point, I thought, it really is time for a new translation, and a complete one,” Arons said.
The Original Text
Hamburgische Dramaturgie is one of the most significant historical texts in the dramaturgy field; in fact, Lessing coined the term “dramaturgy,” earning himself the title “the father of modern dramaturgy.”
Hamburgische Dramaturgie also has a fascinating historical context. The collection consists of 101 essays that Lessing wrote during his time with the Hamburg National Theatre, which was created in 1767 by a group of businessmen in Hamburg, Germany. Prior to then, most performances in the area were presented by traveling troupes. “You didn’t have, at that time in Germany, any sort of house where normal, ordinary citizens could go and see the theater any week of the year,” Arons explained. “So they instituted this in Hamburg.”
Lessing, a prominent playwright and dramatist, was brought into the Hamburg National Theatre as a consultant and artistic director, where he spent his time critiquing works. “He wrote essays about and critiqued what he saw on stage, and he used these essays as a way to formulate a theory of what good theater should be,” Arons said.
Lessing’s essays were published over the course of his two years with the Hamburg National Theatre, which dissolved in 1769. It closed for a number of reasons, including the actors’ dislike of Lessing’s public criticism 
of the theater. His essays were eventually published together in a book, which, according to Arons, has since “stood as an example of how critical writing can reflect on media and what media does in society.”
The Researchers
Diving into this area of research is natural for Arons,  who has researched 18th-century German theater since 
she was an undergraduate student at Yale University. “I actually didn’t start learning German until college,” Arons said; before then, she had only read a few translated books and been interested in the culture. While an undergraduate student, Arons studied abroad in East Germany and went on to study dramaturgy and the German language in graduate school at the University of California, San Diego, keeping her research focused on 18th-century German theater.
“It’s an interesting time in history,” Arons said. “It’s the time when everything is changing, when they’re moving from this moment of the actors as traveling troupes who have no status in society to actors as celebrities and as established figures in society.” Arons even wrote her first book on the implications of the transition for women in the 18th century.
Arons and Michael Chemers of the University of California, Santa Cruz, who used to be a colleague of Arons’ at Carnegie Mellon, originally applied for the NEH grant in 2010. Despite a mostly positive response, their first proposal was rejected because it was too huge of a project for just one translator. So Arons and Chemers 
decided to bring a few more scholars into the project, getting Natalya Baldyga of Tufts University and independent scholar Sara Figal to join. After reapplying last fall, they were awarded the grant in August.
The Translation
With the complete group of scholars, the project really began to take shape. They were offered a publishing deal and decided to digitally publish as they went, much like how Lessing published his essays as he wrote them. “In many ways, if Lessing were alive today, he’d be blogging,” Arons said. “We wanted to give him that opportunity to blog.”
Since their goal is simply to make the text accessible to students and scholars, “Our original thought was, ‘Let’s just get this out there,’ because it doesn’t exist. Even the first essay [in the current translation] is missing three sentences. So someone who doesn’t read German immediately doesn’t have access to what he’s really written,” Arons said. To achieve this goal, the scholars will publish the translated essays on mediacommons.org, a peer-to-peer website that allows readers to give feedback on the translations.
“It’s scary because we’re putting our work out there mostly finished, but not completely finished, and people will be able to see our mistakes... but at the same time, we thought this would allow us to make it a better work in the end,” Arons said.
Arons and her colleagues hope that getting feedback as they work will only make their work better and more accurate. Additionally, this back-and-forth between translators and readers is something Arons feels that Lessing would appreciate. “It’s sort of in the spirit in his own way of doing stuff,” she explained. “He got a lot of feedback on his writing at the time, and he loved the back-and-forth. So we thought we’d sort of honor him in 
that way, by being brave and putting it out there even though we might be embarrassed by it.”
Arons’ three-year Hamburgische Dramaturgie translation project is significant to both those interested 
in translation and those interested in theater theory, a duality that makes the project particularly appealing. “The work can stand for more than just its historical value or its value as theater theory,” Arons said. “It can also stand as an example of how scholarship works in the real world.”

What do you get when you cross Andy Warhol and a pop-culture-obsessed Jewish feminist? Deborah Kass.
The Andy Warhol Museum is currently hosting a massive mid-career retrospective of the artist and Carnegie Mellon alumna (CFA ’74) called Deborah Kass: Before and Happily Ever After. The exhibit features three decades’ worth of work by Kass — an impressive 80 works ranging from early abstract landscapes to appropriations of Warhol’s famous works.
Kass is a New York-based artist whose work explores the intersection of pop culture, art history, and 
self-identity. Most of her work is centered on her own identity as a Jewish lesbian, but the exhibit also includes a good deal of her older landscape paintings.
In Kass’ early work, the technique is as important as the concept. In fact, the conceptual basis for her early paintings, mostly from the ’80s, is often hard to determine without the informational labels that the museum provides. Luckily for museum-goers, the paintings are visually strong on their own, with bright colors and bold brushstrokes that grab viewers’ attention.
Kass’ work took an interesting turn in the early ’90s, when she began appropriating Warhol’s work with a little twist of her own. Instead of featuring prominent celebrities in her works, Kass focused the work on her own heroes, including writer Gertrude Stein, baseball player Sandy Koufax, and singer and actress Barbra Streisand, to name a few. Streisand appears as the subject of Kass’ well-known “The Jewish Jackie” series, which portrays Streisand in the style of Warhol’s paintings of Jackie Kennedy.
At this point, Kass’ work started making clearer conceptual statements about feminism and “Jewishness.” By focusing on being Jewish — as opposed to Judaism as a religion — Kass brings an often-overlooked group into the foreground without religious undertones. Her work shows the cultural stigmas attached to the group.
The highlight of the exhibit is the work from Kass’ series “The Warhol Project,” which she worked on throughout the ’90s. In this series, Kass put her own spin on Warhol’s works, copying his technique of combining painting and silk-screening, but replacing his cool, detached subjects with people who had personal significance to her. These works are scattered throughout the museum, often with Warhol’s original works placed directly next to Kass’ appropriations. It is often difficult to tell which work is whose, since they are visually very similar, but a closer look reveals the pairing to be an interesting juxtaposition of subjects.
One of the largest pieces in the exhibit — and an outstanding example of Kass’ Warhol appropriations — is “America’s Most Wanted.” Playing off Warhol’s “Thirteen Most Wanted Men,” which featured silkscreens of criminals, Kass’ work replaces criminals with well-known curators.
The exhibit closes with some of Kass’ most recent work, from the late 2000s. This work expands on her study of art history and popular culture, taking examples of post-war painting and pairing them with lyrics from songs in The Great American Songbook. The project combines emotionally stimulating song lyrics with modernist pop painting styles.
Throughout the exhibit, Kass’ thoughtful work is perfectly interspersed with Warhol’s, creating an impressive and memorable retrospective of the artist’s career.
Deborah Kass: Before and Happily Ever After will be on view at The Andy Warhol Museum (117 Sandusky St.) through Jan. 6.

A recently rediscovered color, closest to maroon or burgundy, hit the runways this season and has since been embraced by celebrities and fashion designers alike. This darker, cooler, more muted shade of red made an appearance in this year’s collections of Yves Saint Laurent, Marc Jacobs, and Alexander Wang.
Termed “oxblood” by fashion enthusiasts due to its resemblance to the color of oxygenated blood, the color has garnered attention from well-known personalities such as Blake Lively and Kate Middleton. While the former donned a Gucci embellished minidress in the wine-colored hue, the latter opted for a more conservative blazer and skirt combination by French designer Paule Ka.
Despite the myriad interpretations of the color red, oxblood has been agreed upon as the color of the moment. In The Huffington Post article “Why Wear Oxblood?” writer Lily Avnet explains that the color may have moved quickly into the spotlight because people are so weary of the severity of the color red.
In other words, oxblood is appreciated for its understated quality, regardless of its gory name. Fashion articles like “Oxblood...the New Black!” on the nail polish blog EG Nails It, “Oxblood Love” on the She Knows blog, and “Trend Report: There will be oxblood” in The Washington Post indicate how this hue is becoming a staple in everyone’s wardrobe.
Since oxblood is the color of the season, it’s easy to find anything in stores in this shade of red. Take any of these suggestions, or create your own look.
Preppy
Feeling girly? Rock a burgundy dress or skirt, such as the Oxblood Ribbed Pleated Skirt from Topshop. Pair the skirt with a fitted black tee, patterned tights, and boots. For a preppier look, match a pair of BlankNYC designer jeans in rhubarb with a shirt in a neutral color. Complete the outfit with a skinny brown belt and a pair of brown Oxfords. If your style is more sophisticated, try a burgundy blazer, such as the Oxblood Ponte Blazer from Topshop, with jeans, a beige top, and black ballet flats.
Edgy
Get an edgier look by flaunting a pair of wine-colored Dr. Martens “Pascal” boots with your outfit. If you’re willing to splurge, make a statement with the Rich & Skinny “Legacy Leather” Faux Leather Skinny Jeans. Wear them with a baggy sweater in tan or gray to look fashionable, but not over the top.
Combining Trends
If you’re a girl who likes to stand out in a crowd, combine autumn and winter trends and pick up a pair of oxblood velvet leggings from American Apparel. Wear them with a black or gray tunic for an awesome outfit. The peplum hem is another major look this year, so a burgundy peplum top is a great way to incorporate two trends into an outfit without making it too overwhelming. Patterned jeans are also everywhere at the moment; what better way to mix trends than with a pair of oxblood patterned jeans? Try the Current/Elliott “The Ankle” Print Crop Skinny Jeans in the color “Crimson Tapestry.” Guys and girls can both rock this trendy look.
Nail Polishes
If you’re weary of buying clothing in oxblood, try nail polish colors such as Essie’s “Berry Hard” or “Lacy Not Racy” and OPI’s “Bastille My Heart.”
Colors
Since burgundy is considered a statement color, it works best when worn with neutral colors, such as black, beige, and gray. However, you can spice up your outfit with a touch of gold, or be daring with burgundy jeans and a navy blazer. Pastels also work well with oxblood, allowing you to keep wearing your mint green or pale blue summer tops through the colder months. Olive with burgundy gives off a wintry vibe, so a pair of burgundy jeans and an olive sweater accessorized with an off-white circle scarf makes for a perfect cold-weather outfit.
Oxblood is such a major trend mainly because it is universally flattering. It complements all skin tones and works for any style, so go grab something (or a couple of things) in oxblood, and start styling.

Have you ever spent too much time looking at image macros on the internet, or scrolling through videos of cats on Youtube? Many people regard these diversions as pointless yet amusing wastes of time, much like other aspects of today’s digital culture.
New York-based artist Cory Arcangel, however, finds something of artistic merit in American digital culture. Arcangel uses mostly ready-made digital technology in his art. In a sense, his artwork is a subset of pop art — taking elements from popular culture and giving them a twist — but its heavy emphasis on the digital era makes his approach more unique. In his work, Arcangel also uses hacked and obsolete pieces of technology, such as old video game cartridges.
Cory Arcangel: Masters, a new exhibit at the Carnegie Museum of Art, shows off selected pieces of art that Arcangel has produced over his decade-long career, including five videos, a modified video game, a modified flat screen television, a wallpaper installation, and a collection of archival materials. The exhibit, which opened on Saturday, also debuts a new work: Arcangel’s collection of catalogued trance and techno LPs.
Like other pieces of modern art, some elements of Arcangel’s work may come off as somewhat overrated. One work featured in the exhibit, “Super Mario Clouds,” simply displays the sky and background clouds from the game Super Mario Bros. — nothing else.
But the exhibit still has its merits. Few people in modern art address the values and concerns of the digital age, despite its growing influence on our culture and society. Above all, Arcangel’s work is a commentary on American culture in the digital era. His pieces highlight how most of the technology we use quickly becomes obsolete in our consumer culture; every year there is a newer, fancier iPhone or tablet that quickly becomes replaceable.
Many of the works in the exhibit focus on the transient and pointless nature of technology. The work “Untitled Translation Exercise” is basically a showing of the 1993 American film Dazed and Confused, but with the script dubbed by an outsourced Indian firm. The odd juxtaposition of the depiction of American culture with the stilted, wooden voices of the foreign firm create an interesting commentary on the outsourcing of American labor and the effects of globalization on American culture. Moreover, it’s incredibly funny to watch.
In an interview posted on the Carnegie Museum of Art website, exhibit curator Tina Kukielski describes Arcangel and his work: “I’ve always thought of Cory as a cultural purveyor. He is an artist who understands the mechanisms and systems of technology and the internet and is able to intervene in the slightest way in the sense that he upsets the rhythms or patterns of culture just enough to expose their very being.”
Cory Arcangel: Masters will run through Jan. 27 at the Carnegie Museum of Art (4400 Forbes Ave.).

Taylor Swift became famous for her bright country-crossover sound and instantly captured the coveted teen girl demographic upon the release of her eponymous first album. While her new album Red is definitely a departure from her usual style, it is still largely a success.
The album’s title track, “Red,” is one of the clearest examples of Swift’s changed style. “Red” addresses the same classic Swift themes of young, passionate, unrequited love, built on the remains of her original country sound — the original demo recording even opens with the twang of a banjo — but with a new infusion of pop. “22” uses a strong backbeat and feel-good lyrics to chronicle Swift’s slightly more mature emotional outlook as a 22-year-old. Similarly, the hit single that preceded Red, “We Are Never Ever Getting Back Together,” combined a catchy, upbeat tune with just the right amount of teen angst to top the charts for weeks.
Perhaps the most surprising song of the album for many long-time Swift fans is “I Knew You Were Trouble,” which combines a catchy refrain with a wailing beat. Though this song does a good job of exhibiting Swift’s impressive voice, it seems a little confused in its purpose.
While her musical style may have changed in Red, Swift definitely decided to go back to her roots when it came to subject matter. Red doesn’t add much to Swift’s somewhat tired themes; the songs flit from celebrating young love to bitterly denouncing it with the same element of girl power that originally made her music so appealing. While many see Swift’s stylistic adaptation as a bad thing, Red continues the trend that started as far back as her second album, Fearless, and continues in her third, Speak Now. All of these show a move to a more pop-focused style for Swift as she gradually strays from her original country sound.
Despite the pervasive new style, Red also carries a heavy load of standard Swift-style ballads, including “Treacherous” and “Come Back... Be Here.” Songs like these align more closely with what many Swift fans are probably expecting and do a good job of tying the album back to her roots. More charged songs like “Starlight” also appeal to a traditional Swift demographic; with its passionate crescendo of a chorus and sometimes unfamiliar electronic beats, “Starlight” is as evocative as similar power ballads from her previous albums, but with a new, more synthetic twist.
Overall, Red represents a broad sampling of Swift’s traditional offerings with a few surprises thrown in. Although her exploration of musical style might alienate a few traditional followers, her more electronic, pop-laden sound might also attract a few new ones, and stalwart fans will be intrigued by the evolution.
Swift also threw in a few collaborations, including “The Last Time” with the largely unknown Gary Lightbody and “Everything Has Changed” with the ever-more-popular British artist Ed Sheeran. Songs like these appeal to a broader fan base. Swift collaborates especially well with Sheeran, whose music falls into a similar genre as her own.
There’s no doubt that Red has a few missteps; sometimes Swift ventures a little bit too far out of her comfort zone. In the song “I Knew You Were Trouble,” she experiments with her sound in a way that just doesn’t fit in with the rest of the album. However, the outlook on the album is generally positive.
Red will undoubtedly spark claims that Swift is a sellout who has abandoned her original fan base, as new albums from big-name artists always do. However, Red exemplifies Swift’s diversity as an artist and her willingness to experiment, rather than her pandering to the masses. Like Swift’s previous work, Red will still be the go-to album for the average teenager at the happy start of a relationship — or more often, at the bitter end of one.

As a student at Carnegie Mellon, Brendan Frederick wanted to blend his love for hip-hop and writing into a meaningful career. Frederick (H&SS ’04) is the vice president of music programming and development for BUZZMEDIA, a media company that owns and operates over 40 music and pop culture websites.
Frederick became involved in hip-hop journalism as an undergraduate. Initially obsessed with breaking into the music business as a talent representative, he decided to try his hand at writing. Although he has since moved on to careers at XXL, Mass Appeal, and Complex magazines, Frederick first honed his editorial skills in the classroom.
“The process of reading someone’s story and dissecting and tearing it apart and telling them what they could have done differently, that was definitely the most useful thing I took away from CMU. That’s what made me feel like I can be an editor,” said Frederick, who majored in creative writing and minored in business.
Frederick attributes his editing skills to the creative writing faculty at Carnegie Mellon, particularly associate professor of English Sharon Dilworth. According to Dilworth, Frederick was a driven student.
“There are certain students who come along who have an energy and an interest in life that immediately sets them apart from the rest of the student body. They are infectious in their enthusiasm — Brendan was that kind of student,” Dilworth said via email. “He was so engaged — so smart and savvy. He didn’t need encouragement. He was going places well before he even knew where it was that he wanted to go. You don’t forget the Brendan Fredericks.”
While still trying to break into the music business, Frederick applied to internships at record labels, but was not accepted. “Unless you have a connection or know someone, it’s pretty much impossible to get your foot in the door,” he said.
Eventually, Frederick took another route by focusing on his interest in writing. He got an internship as a mix-tape columnist at RIME Magazine, a small hip-hop publication. He used that opportunity as a springboard to open doors that were previously closed to him. A turning point came during Frederick’s senior year of college. He was named editor-in-chief of Mass Appeal magazine a year after becoming an intern there. In his role as editor, he was finally able to mix his interests in hip-hop, journalism, and business.
“Brendan is a real good kid,” said Elliott Wilson, owner of hip-hop culture blog Rap Radar and editor of RESPECT. magazine. While Wilson was an editor at XXL magazine, he hired Frederick to enhance the site’s lackluster website. “Brendan was the reason XXL was able to beat a lot of our competitors,” he said.
Throughout his career, Frederick was able to build a reputation as a tech-savvy editor. This was especially useful at Complex magazine, where he worked for four-and-a-half years before joining BUZZMEDIA in September.
Complex, founded by Mark Ecko, owns advertising rights to popular blogs. The magazine is an extension of a larger brand and is an anomaly among music publications. As Frederick puts it, Complex is not exactly hip-hop, hipster, or pop: “It’s somewhere in the middle.”
“The hip-hop world thinks of Complex as a fashion magazine, and this sort of white mainstream media world thinks of us as a hip-hop magazine. It’s almost like we have the best of both worlds. We can get away with taking a lot of risks and doing things and asking questions that a lot of people might not be able to,” Frederick said.
It is a huge departure from the common newsstand magazines featuring an image of a celebrity against a white background. “A lot of magazines, their business is still based on selling magazines on the newsstands,” Frederick said. “That’s why you see so many magazines with a celebrity in front of a white background and cover lines that are designed to catch people’s eyes.”
The print issue is a canvas for experimentation. Justin Bieber was featured on the Complex front cover for the magazine’s 10th anniversary. The picture showed Bieber in an uncharacteristic role: getting pummeled in a boxing ring. The move reflected the magazine’s marketing technique. “If you hate Bieber, you can see him get punched in the face. If you love him, you get to see him in this crazy, grisly scenario,” Frederick said. However, Complex is more concerned with its digital platform, a constantly updated outlet for music, fashion, and political news.
Frederick’s work at BUZZMEDIA is similar to what he did at Complex, but he focuses more on acquiring and maintaining media sites, including SPIN, Concrete Loop, The Hype Machine, and many others. On its website, BUZZMEDIA boasts more than 40 million people visiting its member sites. The company has been bolstering its profile through acquisitions: In July it acquired SPIN magazine, and in August it acquired three punk rock music blogs, including Under the Gun Review.
One of Frederick’s primary tasks is helping music magazine SPIN transition from a print-based business model to a web-based format: “BUZZ bought SPIN back in July, and despite being a very well-known music magazine with a long history, they still have a long way to go before they find the same level of success on the web. Right now I’m working out of the SPIN office, trying to help them rethink their whole operation.”
Although Frederick is removed from his college days, he offers the same advice that he received while at Carnegie Mellon: The cornerstone of a meaningful writing career is having confidence. “Having confidence in your writing and having confidence in your abilities to critique other people’s writing are two totally valuable skills that I learned through the creative writing program.”

If you’re into the electronic dance music (EDM) scene, then surely you’ve listened to Zedd’s new album, Clarity. If you don’t know what all the fuss is about concerning EDM, then get to an iTunes store and check this album out.
If you’re just starting to dip your toes into this music scene, Anton Zaslavski — better known by his stage name Zedd — is a good place to start. The 23-year-old Russian-German music producer and DJ has a crisp, clean sound that still manages to hit those deep, reverberating bass notes that are oh-so satisfying.
Zedd’s debut album Clarity was released in early October through Interscope Records. Before releasing the album, Zedd released singles through OWSLA, Skrillex’s record label, and went on worldwide tours with Porter Robinson, Lady Gaga, and others.
After releasing great singles like “Shave It” and “Stars Come Out” — as well as making sick remixes for the likes of Fatboy Slim, The Black Eyed Peas, Wolfgang Gartner, and Swedish House Mafia — it’s about time that this rising star released his own album.
Clarity is unique in its coherent message. It’s an actual album, with a flow and a consistent theme that’s hard to find in a world full of EDM singles and LPs. Many EDM artists have a hard time creating albums, since often they don’t need to release albums as long as they’re coming out with singles and booking tour dates.
But if you listen to Clarity in order, from “Hourglass” to “Epos,” it becomes clear that Zedd was aiming to create a specific musical experience in those 45 minutes. By the end of the album, you feel as if you’ve listened to one of his live sets, not 10 different songs.
“Hourglass,” which incorporates the sounds of clocks ticking, imperceptibly flows into the next song, “Shave It Up.” Many of the songs — “Codec,” “Stache,” and “Epos” in particular — have Zedd’s signature bass timbres, making the sound crisp, gnarly, and satisfying.
Two especially grooving house tunes that appear back-to-back on the album are “Fall Into Sky” featuring Ellie Goulding and “Follow You Down” featuring Bright Lights. The vocals and subject matter of the lyrics make the two songs flow together almost seamlessly.
Zedd’s lead singles, “Spectrum” and “Clarity,” do a good job of representing the feel of the album as a whole. “Spectrum,” lauded as Zedd’s best work when it came out over the summer, is a beautiful song with great lyrics and spectacular beats. The version of “Spectrum” in the album is shortened, but the extended version is available on iTunes.
Zedd stands apart from many EDM DJs because of his origins: He’s a classically trained musician who started playing the piano and drums at age four. Take that, Justin Bieber.
Making a good EDM album is hard work, but with Zedd’s classical training, he’s managed to create something worthwhile in Clarity.

The Expendables 2
8 10 12
Sylvester Stallone leads his merry band of warriors into a sea of box office success in The Expendables 2. As a follow-up to its predecessor, The Expendables 2 is an improvement. In this next installment, a basic mission turns into a quest for revenge against a villain who possesses a dangerous weapon. You’ll get a cute dash of self reference here and there, mostly to balance out the violence. Cameos abound, and most of the humor really does work. But for anyone besides the most casual moviegoer, The Expendables 2 is just a lot of explosions.
Magic Mike
8 10 12
Magic Mike is the best head-fake of the year. Veteran director Stephen Soderbergh (_Ocean’s Eleven_, Contagion) takes an exploitation picture that aims to make bank off Channing Tatum’s abs and turns it into a deft economic rumination. Tatum gives a truly nuanced and effective performance as a 19-year-old who turns to stripping in a rough economy, and Matthew McConaughey contributes another great supporting turn in what has been his year of resurgence. Carnegie Mellon alumnus Matt Bomer (CFA ’00) also makes an appearance as Tatum’s stripper colleague. As usual, Soderbergh goes overboard with his color palette, but it’s a small complaint in this year’s best blockbuster.
Ted
8 10 12
Seth MacFarlane’s wisecracking filth continues its fixation on children in Ted. Dangling in a state of arrested childhood, Mark Wahlberg’s character struggles with his adulthood and the effects of his friendship with Ted, his walking, talking, sentient teddy bear. Of course, this is MacFarlane’s movie, so the stuffed bear would obviously buy a few prostitutes, use cocaine, and be Wahlberg’s redeemer. The script is mildly funny in the way that everything MacFarlane has ever done is mildly funny, but the film is damaged by its creator’s seemingly boundless gift for masking incoherence with vague, flaccid cultural riffs.

Dear Patrick,
I’m a TA, and I really love the job. The problem is I have a crush on one of my students, and I think he likes me too! He has an A in the class, but he comes to my office hours all the time asking for extra credit. I think I could lose my job if I pursued anything. What should I do?
Thanks,
Harlotry Opportunity Tempting, Fear Overreaching Relationship, Sexual Tension Unbelievably Dripping, Eagerly Needs Tips
Dear HOT FOR STUDENT,
We’ll go ahead and assume this guy is into you (why else would anyone go to office hours?). If you’re unethical, then it’s pretty simple: Next time he comes to office hours, offer him some special “extra credit.” Maybe hold some special office hours in your dorm, if you catch my drift. Based on his performance, you can decide whether or not to give him any actual extra credit.
If you want to stay ethical, think about this: If you grade, then you really shouldn’t date your students. If you don’t, then it’s probably okay. Consider running it past your professor or checking the official school guidelines. I tried to do some research about your question, except all I found were really inappropriate videos.
You probably don’t want to do what they did,
Patrick Hoskins
Dear Patrick,
I go out to PHI on average four times a week. It’s gotten to the point where I know the bartender and all the middle-aged regulars by name. Is this too much? Should I try other bars? Or, perish the thought, go out to bars less often? It’s certainly taking a toll on my wallet, but I need my Wednesday night beer. My liver begs for an answer.
I wrote this from a bar,
Buying Alcohol Regularly, Purchases Highly Intoxicating
Dear BAR PHI,
If going to PHI is wrong, I don’t want to be right. It’s cheap, it’s close, and it’s got booze. That’s all I look for in a bar, but other people are pickier. I probably should tell you to go out and explore the world of Pittsburgh bars but that’d be hypocritical of me. And I am not a hypocrite.
Having said that, you should go out and explore the world of Pittsburgh bars. PHI is a great weeknight bar, but it’s pretty shabby by comparison. Take a weekend off, check out what else is out there, and then come back to the sweet embrace of PHI. If money’s a problem, then stick with the drink specials for a good deal on booze. There’s no reason not to go to PHI on a Wednesday.
Other than wanting to preserve your self-respect,
Patrick Hoskins

“ Pitchfork is incredibly pretentious.” “After I saw the review that Pitchfork gave my favorite album, I’ll never read them again.” “ Pitchfork doesn’t know what they’re talking about.”
It’s not uncommon to hear rhetoric like this when you talk to hardcore music enthusiasts. While I have issues with the way music journalism site Pitchfork operates, it’s disconcerting that there are people who unequivocally discredit everything Pitchfork does.
Pitchfork, established in Chicago in 1996, is one of the most widely known music journalism sources in the nation, coming into existence around the time when college rock burst into the mainstream. In the almost two decades since its creation, Pitchfork has become an indie taste maker and unrelenting hype machine. Predictably, people tend to either love or hate Pitchfork.
It’s not that hard to justify disliking Pitchfork. Its rating scale is unbalanced; its review process is seemingly skewed toward music that fits its projected image as opposed to the quality of the music, and their reviews tend to be pretentious ramblings that sometimes act as soapboxes instead of legitimate, in-depth critiques (see its review of The Airbone Toxic Event’s self-titled debut). However, the staff at Pitchfork undeniably has an expansive knowledge of popular music and a fine-tuned understanding of the type of music that its audience seeks out.
I don’t hold a lot of faith in Pitchfork’s reviews anymore, but the sheer amount of cultural knowledge that it brings to its reviews — information on contemporaries, influences, film culture, current events, and analyses of local music scenes— is impressive, to say the least. It’s completely legitimate to criticize Pitchfork, but to discredit it entirely is a gross oversight.

When considering the submitted organization budgets last spring, the Joint Funding Committee (JFC) had to sort through over $1.6 million in requests. The committee only ended up allocating $1.12 million, meaning that it had to tighten restrictions on what could be funded — and one of the costs that didn’t make the cut was spring break trips.
For Alternative Break, a student group that plans service-based trips, JFC’s decision “was a huge blow,” said Sabrina Larkin, the club’s president and a junior chemical engineering and engineering and public policy double major. The organization requested over $18,000 from JFC, but only received $204.
This stretching of resources is the reason that Student Body Vice President for Finance Jon Mark is proposing a $24 increase per semester to the student activities fee. “The programming supported by the fee has essentially outgrown resources that we can give it,” he said at a town hall meeting about the activities fee, held last Thursday. “A lot of these organizations have come up to us and told us that the funding that we’re giving them, considering the rate of inflation [and] the rate of what we’ve been having to cut them, they just can’t keep up, and they certainly can’t grow.”
The fee increase, which would go into effect next academic year, will go up for a referendum vote this Thursday through Saturday. The vote is split into two referendums: one to raise the undergraduate fee, and one to raise the graduate fee.
However, when one considers that the activities fee this year collected over $2.4 million, it raises the question: Where does all that money go?
The source of the money
Carnegie Mellon’s Board of Trustees sets the activities fee every year, taking into account recommendations from student government. The fee is currently $97 per semester. Over the past several years, the fee has increased at an average rate of 2.4 percent. According to Mark, a senior lighting design major, student government has made its recommendations for increases based on the five-year average of the Consumer Price Index, which tracks prices of various household goods in order to measure inflation.
According to its fiscal policy, student government is allowed to recommend up to a 5 percent increase in the fee without needing to call a referendum for students to vote on the increase.
But Student Body President Will Weiner, an economics and statistics and decision science double major, explained at the town hall meeting, “One of our fears last year when we thought about [doing] the 5 percent [increase] is that if you do that over five years, a lot of the students may not necessarily notice. It’s definitely harder to PR that and make sure we’re really reflecting what people want, so I think in terms of transparency and getting the proper feedback all at once, [the 25 percent increase] is a better solution.”
The Graduate Student Assembly
Once the Hub collects the funds for the activities fee, the money goes to different places depending on who it’s from. The graduate students’ activities fee is divided and sent to three different locations: 30 percent goes to JFC’s funds, 45 percent goes to the Graduate Student Assembly (GSA), and 25 percent goes back to the departments for students to distribute.
Although the percentage of the graduate students’ fee that goes toward JFC funds is lower than the percentage of the undergraduate fee, the GSA Vice President for Finance Patrick Foley, a Ph.D. candidate in statistics, believes that graduate students do not benefit as much from the organizations on campus. In a survey student government conducted last year, “they asked organizations how many members they had who were grads and undergrads, and then they asked them, ‘In your opinion, do you serve mostly grads, mostly undergrads, or a mix?’ And they also asked, ‘Who do you benefit in addition to the members of your organization?’ ” Foley said. “And what I did was I took the JFC budgets and matched them up to the survey answers.”
At the town hall meeting, Mark said that 30 percent of the participants in organizations were graduate students, but Foley believes that number is not an accurate representation of graduate student benefit from the activities fee.
“My main issue with that is that that 30 percent number doesn’t actually reflect the dollars that come out of JFC,” Foley said. “And if you match up the members or the beneficiaries of organizations with what they’re actually getting, you’ll find that grad students get something closer to like, 16 — or at highest, 20 — percent of the dollars.”
A fee raise would mean more money would go toward GSA; however, research conducted by a member of the National Association of Graduate and Professional Students suggested that Carnegie Mellon’s GSA is already one of the best-funded graduate student governments in the country.
GSA’s budget of $416,631 covers graduate student social events; subsidized tickets for rafting, Kennywood, and movies; funds for graduate students to attend academic conferences; GSA sports teams; and research grants, among other expenses. Andy Schultz, a Ph.D. candidate in materials science and engineering and a current GSA representative, said, “We don’t need more money.” 
When asked if he was in favor of the activities fee raise, Foley said, “I can’t speak for all of GSA — and I don’t — but personally, no, I’m not in favor of it.”
Student Senate
Unlike the graduate students’ activities fee, only 10 percent of the undergraduates’ student activities fee goes to Student Senate. Those funds go toward Senate’s various committees (Academic Affairs, Business Affairs, Campus Life, Communications, Finance, and Internal Development), as well as to funding events like Senate Week. Senate also pays for 25 percent of the Arts Pass program, and helps to cover the salary of student government’s application engineer, sophomore information systems and computer science double major Carlos Diaz-Padron, who is responsible for the maintenance and upkeep of student government’s various websites.
Most of Senate’s budget, however, ends up going to student organizations. According to the Student Senate policy, at least 25 percent of Senate’s budget is required to go toward special allocations funding, which provides “financial support for events and organizations that benefit Carnegie Mellon University’s undergraduate students.” 
Special allocations are meant to fund events that are new to Carnegie Mellon, costs that arise unexpectedly after budgets have been approved, and groups that are not funded by JFC. This academic year, Senate has set aside over $70,000, 61.4 percent of its budget, to go toward special allocations.
JFC funds
The vast majority of undergraduates’ student activities fee — 90 percent of it — goes into the pool of JFC’s funds. Between the undergraduate portion and the 30 percent from graduate students, approximately $1.12 million is available this year for student organizations. If both activities fee referendums pass in this week’s special election, an additional $314,000 will go toward JFC’s funds.
During the spring semester, student organizations apply to JFC with budgets for the following academic year that state the specific items their budget will go toward. Every student organization is assigned a JFC representative who is supposed to answer their questions and walk them through the process. Once JFC reviews the budget and makes its recommendations, the organizations each have the opportunity to appeal JFC’s recommendations. JFC then submits its final budget recommendations for every organization to Student Senate and GSA, which make a decision on every budget near the end of April.
JFC distributes its funds based on the guidelines in its bylaws; its own decisions on how much the committee will contribute to cover specific types of budget requests, like food or travel expenses; and its impression of how much each organization contributes to the campus community.
The system, however, is not without flaws. “I think that [the JFC process] needs to fundamentally change,” Mark said in an interview. He cited outdated metrics as one problem — for example, JFC only gives $60 per night to cover hotel expenses, but “it’s really hard to find a $60 hotel room and fit four people in it. And that’s the current expectation,” Mark said.
Schultz, who sat on JFC last year, said JFC is “such a big, large process that it’s really difficult to be consistent across all the groups, and it’s really difficult to try and find a way to objectively look at which groups actually serve the community best and deserve the money they’re getting.” He said, “What happens is, essentially for every group — and with very rare exceptions in the last year, this is how it goes — you look at what they’re asking, you look at what their budget was last year, and you cut them down to 5 percent increase.”
Mark also said that JFC’s reliance on previous budgets is flawed. “It makes things really unfair.... Organizations who have historically had large budgets and groups that have not historically had large budgets [are] kind of staying around the status quo.”
JFC’s bylaws also make it difficult for new organizations to grow. Organizations that are applying for a budget for the first time cannot receive more than $500, which, for new buggy team Apex, is far from sufficient.
“As a buggy organization, $500 will literally get us nothing,” said Connor Hayes, a second-year architecture major and chairman for Apex. The organization applied for $3,970 from JFC, but since this was Apex’s first year as an organization, it only received $500. “It seems like the way that they fund certain organizations does not reflect what we can logically do. Buggy’s a very time-consuming thing, so to expect us to raise a lot of money — on top of being an organization that does what we’re doing — it’s not exactly a feasible thing, especially for a smaller organization that doesn’t have the manpower of the bigger organizations.”
It didn’t help that they never received guidance from their JFC representative. “Our JFC rep did not contact us one time,” Hayes said. “I reached out to him, and I was never given a response in return.”
Mark agreed that JFC representatives are not always useful to organizations, which is why he wants to do “more training for JFC reps, really making sure that they have the training that they need to do their job and to make sure that the process is clear for student organizations.”
Schultz, however, said that there was another reason why the JFC was sometimes ineffective: Some of the larger organizations will ensure that someone from their staff is on JFC, so “there were certain JFC reps [last year] that just didn’t go to meetings, and they were there to speak for their groups” that they were involved in, rather than to help the organizations which they were assigned to represent, he said.
For instance, the Activities Board (AB) — which is technically a standing committee of the student government, rather than a student organization — usually ensures that an AB member is on JFC “that can make sure that they get their money, that can fight in the room,” Schultz said. Last year, one of AB Committee chairs sat on JFC.
Ariel Liu, the executive chair for AB and a senior computer science major, said, “I think that, because AB constitutes a large portion of the budget, that it’s important for JFC to recognize how we use that budget, and if there isn’t someone from AB who is on JFC ... they won’t be able to see all the different things that AB does.”
Mark also indicated that organizations often overspend or misspend parts of their budget, citing an example of one organization that overspent on its food budget by 1,000 percent. One of his priorities is therefore going to be “making sure that groups are really doing what they say they’re doing,” he said. “There should be transparency between the JFC and the people that need to interact with it, so the fact that people feel that they can’t be transparent in order to get what they need to operate, that’s bad. So we need to figure out a way to fix that.”
Activities fee raise
Given the problems the current JFC process has, “I think JFC needs a major overhaul on the whole process,” Schultz said. While he acknowledged that many of JFC’s problems are “difficult problems” that may not even have solutions, “I don’t see a reason to give JFC more money until they can figure out how to better allocate the money that they have now and [can] actually show that that process isn’t as flawed as it is now.”
But Mark said that through the changes he wants to implement, JFC will be better able “to leverage dollars in a way to create the most impact.” He said he wants to “take a look at the system and do an overhaul first. But especially if we have more money coming into the system, we really need to do this; we really need to look at how we’re doing this and kind of take a step back.”
Larkin is optimistic about the fee increase. “I don’t think it can be a bad thing,” she said. “It doesn’t seem like a lot to me. Our organization in particular, if they can get that extra funding coming in, and the activities fee increase is something that can help along with that, it would make the overall experience much more positive for myself and for all of the participants.”
In the meantime, she is staying positive for Alternative Break’s budget this year. Although the JFC’s cuts were a loss, “we knew that [it would be cut] coming into making the budget, and we’re hoping that we have accounted for that, that we’ll have enough fundraising to make up for that at the end of the year.”

As election season draws to a close, the candidates for the presidency are making their last speeches in the 11 battleground states that will decide which candidate gains the 270 votes necessary to win the election and goes on to occupy the Oval Office this January.
There are a total of 538 electoral votes at play in the presidential election. In order to be elected president, a candidate must win a majority of the votes — in other words, at least 270.
Electoral votes are allotted based on the popular vote in each state. A state has a certain number of electoral votes apportioned by population; the candidate who wins the popular vote in each state wins all of that state’s popular votes (except for the few states that allow split electoral votes). In this electoral cycle, there are a surprisingly large number of states that are considered toss-ups.
The 11 battleground states in which both President Barack Obama and Republican candidate Mitt Romney stand a chance of winning are New Hampshire, with four electoral votes; Iowa and Nevada, with six electoral votes each; Colorado, with nine electoral votes; Wisconsin, with 10 electoral votes; Virginia, with 13 electoral votes; North Carolina, with 15 electoral votes; Michigan, with 16 electoral votes; Ohio, with 18 electoral votes; Pennsylvania, with 20 electoral votes; and Florida, with 29 electoral votes.
The other 39 states are fairly reliable to go either Republican or Democrat, leaving Obama with a virtually guaranteed 201 electoral votes, and Romney with 191. The battle for the presidency lies in the battleground states’ collective 146 electoral votes.
Obama won the 2008 election with 365 electoral votes; he swept the battleground states, including the traditionally red Indiana, North Carolina, and Virginia. This year, however, the race is much closer. Romney has seen positive poll data in the traditionally blue Michigan, Minnesota, and Pennsylvania; meanwhile, Florida and Ohio remain as important now as they have been in past years.
The political aggregator site RealClearPolitics averages poll data from many local and national political polls. According to the site’s averaged polls, Obama is up 1.5 percent in New Hampshire, 2.5 percent in Iowa, 2.8 percent in Nevada, 0.6 percent in Colorado, 5 percent in Wisconsin, 4 percent in Michigan, 2.8 percent in Ohio, and 4.1 percent in Pennsylvania; and Romney is up 0.3 percent in Virginia, 3.8 percent in North Carolina, and 1.4 percent in Florida.
If the averages given by  RealClearPolitics represented actual popular vote totals, Obama would take 290 electoral votes and Romney 248, giving Obama the presidency. Even if Obama lost the two states where the poll results from RealClearPolitics has him winning — New Hampshire and Colorado — he would retain 277 electoral votes and win the election. The New York Times political blogger Nate Silver said in a post on Saturday that in order for Romney to win the electoral college, state polls would have to be systematically oversampling Obama voters.
One interesting caveat in this presidential election is the possibility of an electoral college tie. Several possible scenarios can leave both candidates with a total of 269 electoral votes. If Romney can win Florida, North Carolina, Virginia, Iowa, Colorado, and Nevada, he’ll be one shy of 270. Similarly, Romney could lose Virginia, but win Florida, North Carolina, Ohio, Wisconsin, and either Iowa or Nevada for the same tied scenario. Silver considered the scenario in which both Romney and Obama win 269 electoral votes to have a 0.2 percent chance of happening.
If no candidate wins a majority of the votes, the House of Representatives votes for the President from among the three highest-voted candidates, and the Senate chooses the Vice President from among the two highest-voted vice presidential candidates. Each Senator casts one vote, but the House of Representatives votes in blocs by state. Each representative casts a vote, and the most popular candidate among the delegation from each state wins that state’s vote.
If the House vote ends in a tie, the 20th Amendment specifies that the vice president-elect takes office. If both the House and the Senate votes end in ties, federal law specifies a successive list of people who should take office, starting with the Speaker of the House.
In the history of the U.S., only John Quincy Adams has ever been elected by the House of Representatives.
There is also the possibility that a “faithless elector” could shake up the count. An elector is a person who represents a state in the Electoral College. Electors cast the actual votes that determine the President. Different states appoint their electors differently, and not all states legally require electors to vote for the candidate who won the state’s popular vote. A faithless elector is an elector who votes against the will of his or her state’s popular vote.
Faithless electors are relatively rare; the most recent instance was in 2004, and in the 20th and 21st centuries, no election has ever had more than one. In addition, some states have laws that invalidate the votes of faithless electors. Unless the race is already extremely close, faithless electors are unlikely to impact the outcome.
There is  the possibility of a disparity between the electoral vote and the popular vote, as in 2000. Silver places the odds of Obama winning the popular vote and losing the electoral vote at 1.1 percent, and vice-versa at 5.7 percent. If the election had been held just a few days ago, according to the RealClearPolitics averages, Romney would have won the popular vote, but lost the electoral vote.
All electoral math and possible constitutional crises aside, the race will probably come down to Ohio. Silver has Ohio with a 50 percent chance of being the deciding state, far more likely than Virginia, the next highest, at 15 percent. Once Ohio’s votes are tallied, it seems likely that the U.S. will know who its next President will be.

After days of emergency preparation, media coverage, and nervous anticipation, Hurricane Sandy’s impact on Pittsburgh turned out to be limited. In contrast to the state of New Jersey and the city of New York, in Pittsburgh the weather merely amounted to high winds and moderate downpour early last week.
Despite these mild effects, the preparations made by campus facilities to brave the possible storm were substantial.
An official university weather alert was emailed out to the student body Monday afternoon, declaring, “The National Weather Service in Pittsburgh has issued a high wind warning through noon Tuesday and a flood watch through Tuesday evening as a result of Hurricane Sandy.”
The email went on to advise, “During severe winds please stay away from windows as high wind could bring down trees and power lines. Use caution when traveling and do not touch downed power lines. Also, please secure lightweight objects outdoors, or bring them indoors.”
An update was released later that afternoon on the university website, with additional advice: “The storm is expected to reach its peak in Pittsburgh tonight between 8 p.m. and 2 a.m.  If possible, stay indoors during this time ... If you must travel outdoors, please do so with a group of people so that others are present in the event that someone is injured.”
Madelyn Miller, the director of Environmental Health & Safety, said, “We were tracking Sandy for days. As it got closer, we were checking with the national weather service for hour-by-hour predictions.”
“The nice thing about hurricanes is that we have plenty of notice,” she added.
Don Coffelt, the director of Facilities Management Services, was described by Chief of University Police Thomas Ogden as “the incident commander” who spearheaded the effort for campus preparation.
“I was reading the National Weather Service briefings as early as Saturday,” Coffelt said. He was able to have facilities personnel do preparatory work on Saturday, and even bring in commercial contractors to help prepare campus.
Some of the steps taken were removing leaves from storm drains and setting up sand bags to prevent potential flooding.
Ogden said the police preparations involved changing from standard eight-hour shifts to 10 hours, relocating smaller police vehicles and using SUVs with greater ground clearance, tripling the number of guards on campus, and using a Chevy Tahoe truck, which had been retrofitted into a “mobile command post” with supplies.
“Campus police needs to be self-sustaining for 30 to 60 minutes during an emergency, in case Pittsburgh police cannot get here immediately,” Ogden said.
As of Saturday and Sunday, Coffelt was in touch with Miller, University Police, Director of Housing and Dining Services Kim Able, and Michael Murphy, the vice president of campus affairs.
Coffelt was pleased with how the situation was resolved, even if it was “ just a Seattle kind of rain." He said, “We over-responded a little bit — but that’s okay."
Ogden remarked, “I was very, very pleased. I thought that the University did a fantastic job.”
Miller, Coffelt, and Ogden all agreed that the hurricane warnings gave the campus a large amount of time to prepare. “We were able to start planning five days before,” Ogden said.
“The difference is that the forecasting with an event like this gives you more time to plan,” Coffelt said. “You can only do so much when thunderstorms are predicted.”
Miller stressed that students should clarify statements that they are unsure of, when they receive notification of a severe weather event. “When there’s ambiguity students don’t ask questions,” she said.
Coffelt emphasized the need to communicate the “little things” to students, such as closing their windows, since open windows can end up causing as much damage to buildings as larger floods and leaks.
While not necessary in this most recent instance, Ogden asserted that during severe weather, “the biggest issue is to stay in.” 
Vijay Viswanathan, a first-year mathematics major, felt reassured by the weather warnings. 
“I got similar emails from many different people, and they were pretty standard recommendations, but I thought I was better off having known about it,” he said.

Due to interest in student rights and advocacy on campus, Carnegie Mellon will found the first chapter of the Student Public Interest Research Groups (PIRGs) organization in the state of Pennsylvania.
Student PIRGs is a student-funded, nonpartisan, and nonprofit organization that “gives students the skills and opportunity to practice effective citizenship,” according to the Student PIRGs website. 
Representatives from Student PIRGs have set up tables on campus since the beginning of this school year in order to encourage students to register to vote. 
The student interest garnered from tabling became the basis for a Carnegie Mellon chapter of the organization. 
Satvika Neti, a first-year in the Science and Humanities Scholars program and head of Carnegie Mellon’s Student PIRG chapter, helped to start the club because although she wants to vote, she will not be of voting age this fall.
Neti said, “Even though I won’t be able to vote in this election, I’m still really invested in it. So I wanted to make sure that other people had the chance that I wouldn’t, and I feel that by helping people to vote, I’m doing much more than I would with my one vote anyway.”
The Student PIRG club consists of around 30 members, ranging from first-years to seniors. 
They are currently focusing on the new voters project until the election and then will focus on social initiatives, including equal rights for women and the decreasing of textbook rates and tuition.
Bradley Hodge, an undeclared first-year in the Carnegie Institute of Technology, did not originally intend to vote. 
However, with Student PIRGs, he became interested and began to get involved.
Hodge said, “Sometimes you don’t care because you think, ‘My vote’s not going to matter,’ but especially for Pennsylvania, as a swing state, it’s really important. You see these old guys in government and you think, ‘They’re not in tune with my ideas and they’re not going to be able to represent me,’ but if you get students out in force, you can get them to be a driving force for what they want in government.”
According to Daniel Walker-Murray, a campus organizer for Student PIRGs, youth voter turnout has increased by about 21 percent since the last presidential election, and the number of students who claim they are intellectually involved with the election has increased by 13 percent. 
Neti cited progress with student rights as a reason for this increased voting interest among college students.
“If we want more federal funding for student loans, we have to let them know. If we want to change the world, we have to let them know to start listening to us. One way to do that is by voting,” she said.
Walker-Murray said that Student PIRGs stopped the doubling of student interest rates in Pennsylvania and helped to pass the Student Aid and Fiscal Responsibility Act that will add $36 billion into the Pell grant program.
From Walker-Murray’s perspective, this progress shows that the Student PIRGs “are a force to be reckoned with.... If we just organize ourselves and can channel all of our thoughts and energy in the right direction, and once you give [students] the tools they need to do these things, it’s really incredible what they can do.”
For the past few weeks, the Student PIRGs chapter has set up tables on the Cut in order to encourage students to sign voter pledges. 
Students can sign a card promising to text their friends reminding them to vote.
Neti said the three-part system of voter pledging — which includes signing a card, calling by phone, and texting — is new this year, and she hopes that it will encourage students to go out to the polls.
“We are having some phone bank blitzes this weekend to continue contacting the student body because we found through our research that students are more likely to show up to the polls by four percentage points if they receive text messages from someone they know,” Walker-Murray said. 
Compared to other college campuses which Student PIRGs has reached out to, Carnegie Mellon was leading the nation for a few weeks in the number of voters registered on campus.
“We were beating schools out that had six times the number of people that we had,” Walker-Murray said. 
“Carnegie Mellon has about 6,000 people, and we had organizers at the University of Texas at Dallas that has about 36,000 students, and obviously toward the end of the student drive they beat us out, but we got a lot of people interested in volunteering to spread the word to their peers.”
Student PIRGs across the country have a 40-year history of advocating for students, the environment, and consumers, according to the PennPIRGs website.
Walker-Murray said, “The end goal of our organization is to find the things that students care the most about on campus and then work to organize them, and have representatives in the capitals so that they can have their voice heard not only on the school level but on a state level. We can start to make real changes for these people.”

Alumnus will star in startup Silicon Valley reality show
Carnegie Mellon alumnus David Murray (CFA and SCS ’06) has secured a spot on Bravo’s new reality show, Start-Ups: Silicon Valley.
Murray — who graduated from Carnegie Mellon with a triple major in computer science, vocal performance, and human-computer interaction — will be one of six entrepreneurs whom the show will follow in their attempts to launch a startup company. 
Murray’s company is GoalSponsors.com, which matches people with mentors who help them to achieve a personal goal.
Between graduating from Carnegie Mellon and creating his startup, Murray worked for Google, Atari, and a social network startup for gamers called Raptr.
Murray said that he is ready for his reality show experience. 
“This has proved to be the perfect opportunity for me,” Murray said in a university press release. 
“Even if the show is a flop, we will have hundreds of thousands of viewers. And that’s a great opportunity for me to promote my business.”
Start-Ups: Silicon Valley premiers Monday night at 10 p.m. EST.
Professors to initiate digital entertainment research
Carnegie Mellon information technology and marketing professor Michael Smith and information systems professor Rahul Telang will lead a new interdisciplinary effort called the Initiative for Digital Entertainment Analytics (IDEA).
IDEA will study the managerial and public policy problems that new digital entertainment distribution options present.
Smith said in a university press release, “The digital age has fundamentally changed how people consume and produce entertainment including movies, television, music and books.”
“Our goal is to inform billion-dollar revenue streams for an industry experiencing rapid changes. The research is heavily data driven, which can answer questions that are not only useful and important to business and policymakers, but can also create new methods and scientific knowledge,” Telang said in the press release.
The IDEA project is made possible with a grant from the Motion Picture Association of  America.

If I were to ever get a tattoo, it’d say, “Eternal vigilance is the price of liberty.” Nothing better sums up, in my mind, how crucial it is to vote in not only this election, but in every election.
Those seven words are engraved upon the statue of a grim Roman warrior sitting outside the National Archives in Washington, D.C. His left hand clutches a sword, his right hand holds a helmet, and a lion’s pelt drapes over his arm — all to convey that power must be checked at every turn by a diligent and watchful public.
I contend that, at every turn, we have failed to check the powers we’ve granted government. Only about two-thirds of our voting-age population shows up to vote every four years, and even fewer people vote in the congressional elections held every two years, according to a George Mason University study — and it shows.
When our country was founded, every citizen had the right to sign any private contract and have it upheld by a court. Everyone had the right to keep all income they fairly earned. Everyone had the right to enjoy recreational drugs. Every marriage made at the state level was recognized at the federal level, and every business could hire a worker without incurring the egregious compliance costs associated with federal regulation.
None of that is now true about America. While we have come a long way in some areas, namely in racial and gender equality, we have sat idly by while other basic freedoms were stripped from us by well-intentioned men who thought that they knew us better than we knew ourselves. Through the process of voter apathy, our government has stopped representing us.
Corruption has seeped through the cracks made by our neglect and interests of outside parties now hold more sway in our government than the people do. 
We have no one to blame for this except ourselves, but rather than letting this deter us, we should realize that the need to vote has never been more urgent that it is now, and a lack of education or caring is no excuse for watching your freedoms erode.
As founding father Thomas Jefferson said, “I know of no safe repository of the ultimate power of society but the people. And if we think them not enlightened enough, the remedy is not to take power from them, but to inform them by education.” Information has never been more readily available than it is now. American citizens owe it to those that created the great experiment that is the U.S., those who died for the country, and to themselves to do everything in their power to protect the ideals that have made this nation so prosperous.
I believe in American exceptionalism. We are the greatest country in the world. We are colonist John Winthrop’s “city upon a hill.” We are a country founded upon the idea that no man, mob, or government can restrict your volition. Your free will and your ability to exercise it are the only sacred things on this Earth and supersede any power that a government may ever attempt to exert upon you. Should any force attempt to take from you that which — by your own perseverance, daring, and skill — you have wrought into existence, or should anything prevent you from realizing every last fleeting zephyr of thought that may compel your actions, the firm hand of justice would strike down the forces that oppose you and leave you free to pursue happiness.
Those before us have been beaten, jailed, tortured, and killed to protect that idea, and it is because of them that the great American experiment continues to be the beacon of the free world. 
Eternal vigilance truly is the price of liberty, and it is our turn to sit beside that Roman warrior outside of the National Archives and pick up the mantle of the always watchful soldier, guarding the sanctity and validity of our republic.

I found myself in a state of pure shock last Tuesday. During my daily afternoon check of all of my favorite social media and nerdy news websites, I discovered a story I would have thought was a joke had it not appeared so consistently: Disney bought Lucasfilm. Even more shockingly, Star Wars Episode VII has a tentative release date of summer 2015. As a lifelong Star Wars geek — one who is still coming to terms with the fact that Disney just bought Marvel — I sensed a great disturbance in the force. It was as if millions of fanboys cried out in terror and were suddenly silenced... by a mouse.
After reading more, I eventually came to terms with the $4 billion buyout. Former owner of Lucasfilm, George Lucas, has apparently decided that his circle is now complete and is allowing the students to become the masters. In other words, he’s retiring — but not without the second highest share in Disney’s stock after the estate of Steve Jobs, as well as the job of creative consultant on the proposed new films. But what exactly does this mean for adoring fans?
On one hand, there are going to be new Star Wars movies. On the other, we all remember how lackluster the prequels were, to say the least. It’s a scary thought that the next trilogy could feel closer to Attack of Clones than Empire Strikes Back. Even if you didn’t find the prequels to be utterly awful, you have to admit they didn’t carry the charm of original triology. 
Furthermore, for those of us who are really into the galaxy far, far away, this move seems to render pointless all of the many Expanded Universe novels, video games, and comics that continued the story of Luke, Leia, and Han well beyond the end credits of Return of the Jedi.
For instance, Star Wars fandom has considered the Grand Admiral Thrawn trilogy of novels (in which what remains of the Empire tries to hold on to the galaxy as Luke meets his wife, and Han and Leia have kids) the defacto Episodes VII, VIII, and IX. Yet now there’s no reason to believe those stories will be acknowledged, and in fact some reports, such as those from NBC, have explicitly stated that they definitely will not be adapted.
Sure, it’ll be exciting to see some new stories, but without a strong foundation there’s always the potential for another mistake like Jar-Jar Binks. Such a turn of events could lead to anger, which leads to hate, which in turn leads to the Dark Side.
However, I am actually pleasantly surprised at how everything’s turned out for Marvel after Disney acquired it. It’s hard to say how much Disney actually had a hand in that success, but the company hasn’t screwed anything up yet. So while a few days ago I may have felt as though Disney was attempting to slowly buy everything I loved, I now realize that even if that were the case, it could be a lot worse. It could be Michael Bay or M. Night Shyamalan making their marks, as Transformers and Avatar: The Last Airbender fans are all too aware of.
In case anyone still feels as though no good could possibly come of this purchase, Lucas has decided to set up an education trust with a significant portion of the money he’s earned in this deal. So if nothing else, at least some practical good will come out of this.
I, for one, would much rather see children getting the education they deserve than have my selfish wish for specific stories be met. And I’ll be the first to admit that come 2015, I’ll likely be waiting in line, in costume, at the midnight release of Episode VII. Given my namesake, it’s not like I have much of a choice.

Students, faculty, and staff found themselves without consistent wireless internet access across campus on Monday and Tuesday. Although both of the campus wireless networks — “CMU” and “CMU-SECURE” — were left on and broadcasted as available, neither host would assign IP addresses to computers trying to reach the internet. 
On a campus as technologically focused as Carnegie Mellon, two days without Wi-Fi is a significant inconvenience. 
Students with laptops or wireless devices need Wi-Fi on campus to access Blackboard and submit assignments. Many professors count on wireless internet for in-class demonstrations and lecture notes. And almost everyone on campus uses wireless internet to check emails and follow events while on the go. 
We understand that the internet connection may have been knocked out by the inclement weather Pittsburgh received from Hurricane Sandy, and perhaps the disruption to campus Wi-Fi was unavoidable. 
However, the school’s silence on this issue has been disappointing. There was no acknowledgement of the internet issues during the internet blackout and no notification or apology afterwards. 
Nobody knew what was happening. Students did not know to buy ethernet cables, professors did not know to avoid wasting class time trying to connect to the internet.
Little-to-no notification has been sent out to students regarding the issues with connecting to the internet on campus. 
Computing Services sent out an email on Sunday offering to help students connect their devices to the “CMU-SECURE” network, but the notification never mentioned the connectivity issues from early last week.
While being without Wi-Fi for two days is not an emergency, the administration should not get into the practice of staying silent on campus-wide inconveniences. 
The collective impact across all of the university community warranted some notification about the knocked-out Wi-Fi.

This Election Day, millions of people across the nation will go to the polls and cast their ballots for the President of the U.S. Unfortunately for many of these voters, their votes will not actually have an impact on the election. Due to our current Electoral College system, the political fate of the country rests in the hands of the voters in a few undecided states. This massive disconnect between the popular vote and the election of our nation’s leader needs to be corrected if we are to continue to claim that each vote matters.
The Electoral College was initially established in the Constitution as a compromise between the populace directly electing the president and Congress independently voting for the President and Vice President. Today, each state selects electors equal to its representation in Congress (one for each Representative and Senator). Those electors vote for the President and Vice President based on a winner-take-all vote by the state’s population.
The solution that immediately comes to mind is to abolish the electorate system, similar to what the 17th Amendment did for electing Senators. However, this fundamentally redefines our governmental system and poses many problems. The first issue of this proposal would be recounts. When the popular vote is won by 0.5 percent or less, each state recounts ballots by hand. While this is already time consuming in large states — like Florida during the 2000 election — the possibility of hand-recounting the over 120 million votes cast for a presidential election is an unfathomable task that would require much time and manpower.
Having only a popular vote would also mean a candidate could receive significantly less than a majority of the vote due to third parties drawing away votes. A two-round system — where a second round of voting would occur for the two most popular candidates of a larger pool of initial candidates — would partially prevent this issue. However, it would still allow a candidate whom less than 50 percent of America initially wanted as their top choice to win.
A more reasonable solution would be to change the current format of the Electoral College to a representative sample of the states’ political preferences. Maine and Nebraska both currently split their electors on a proportional basis and serve as implementation examples. They both treat each Congressional Representative district as having one elector, with that elector voting for whoever gains a majority in that district. Their two remaining senator-based electors are then given to whoever wins the full state popular vote.
This proposal would dramatically change the way campaigns are currently run. For example, voters in more Democratic-leaning districts in highly Republican states would not have their votes drowned out by the rest of the state. This change would move the focus of campaigns from toss-up states to toss-up districts, and would prevent candidates from completely ignoring the vast majority of states in the run up to the election. This setup would also open the door for third parties to begin gaining footholds by earning one or two electors in districts across the country.
The current election system disenfranchises many voters in solid left-leaning or right-swaying states. The move to a proportional Electoral College would bring us one step closer to the ultimate ideal of “one citizen, one vote” without many of the logistical nightmares that would accompany it.

Fundamentally, this election is about two candidates with opposing views of how this country should be run. But it is as much about opposing characters as it is about opposing policies.
President Barack Obama has become the first sitting President to endorse marriage equality. His backing has put the issue on the Democratic party’s platform, and that’s important. This isn’t because it’s about gay rights, but because it’s about equal rights.
People say that it doesn’t really matter what promises politicians make to us during the campaign season because that’s all they are: vague promises. But fulfilling one’s promises isn’t what’s important during a campaign. The question is not of policies, but of character.
Obama’s promise for gay rights tells me that he believes in equality and that he’s willing to stand up for what he believes in, even though it’s not the convenient option. It’s important because it says that Obama is willing to see all people as humans who deserve the same rights. It makes me feel as if he would fight for me, not because he wants my vote, but because he believes it is the right thing to do.
Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney, on the other hand, would single out a group of people and make them seem lesser and not as worthy as the rest of society through measures like his Federal Marriage Amendment. I find something fundamentally wrong with doing that to any group of people for any reason.
The economy — the primary reason many people cite as to why they’re voting for Romney — is actually why I’m screaming, “Four more years.” According to The Guardian, as of Friday, there have been 25 consecutive months of job growth under Obama’s term and the unemployment rate has stayed under 8 percent for the past couple of months. Obama has a definite plan to reduce the deficit by reducing tax breaks for the rich, investing in the middle class by funding education and agriculture, and ending foreign wars.
The important thing about this is that he has a plan. Romney has failed, even while being prodded by various people, to tell us his plan. He says he’ll close loopholes and create jobs — while neglecting to specify how or which ones — and somehow find $5 billion for tax cuts and unnecessary defense spending at the same time.
I want someone who knows what they want for the country and has a proven track record of going after what they want, rather than someone who refuses to tell us or simply doesn’t know. Obama believes in this country. He’s proven for four years that he has what it takes to run it. Let’s give him another four.

Amid the wreckage wrought by Hurricane Sandy, Donald Trump still managed to make headlines. In a video posted on YouTube from the top floor of a Trump Tower on Oct. 24, he offered $5 million to a charity of Obama’s choice in exchange for the public release of the President’s college transcripts and passport applications and records by last Wednesday.
Trump even had the gall to extend his “offer” to noon on Thursday when the hurricane hit, and when Obama didn’t respond by this deadline, Trump decided that, “Obviously he wasn’t born of this country, or, if he was, he said he wasn’t in order to receive financial aid and in order to have a clear and very easy path into a college or university.”
One could step back from the ridiculousness of the previous statement for a moment and consider that, not only has Trump never met Obama, but the President has no more obligation to respond Trump’s accusations than those made by any other American citizen. 
Obama is merely exercising his right as an American to ignore things he doesn’t care about. And surely Obama recognizes Trump’s vehemence on this issue as at least 50 percent publicity stunt — as does Dallas Mavericks owner Mark Cuban, who on Friday offered Trump $1 million to shave his head.
The adage “any publicity is good publicity” is no longer true for Trump’s case, no matter how devoutly he lives by it. Yes, he has radical opinions on Obama, like that he might be an expatriate Muslim from Kenya. This fact doesn’t give him justification to bribe the President, nor does his vampiric thirst to stay relevant in America’s culture.
More offensive than Trump’s usual publicity stunts, however, is that he was dangling $5 million in front of the President during a huge natural disaster that hit his own New York City. 
When Trump made his Twitter post moving his extortion deadline to Thursday, apartments and subway systems were flooding over, and people were dying throughout New York and New Jersey.
If Trump had that much money to spare on a charity of Obama’s choice, then perhaps the money would be better spent saving the lives and homes of those affected by the hurricane.

Hurricane Sandy spread high winds, heavy rains, and electrical outages from the Carolinas all the way up to Maine last week. However, some states felt the impact of this Category 1 hurricane more than others. 
Considering all of the damage that happened in the tri-state area — New York, New Jersey, and Connecticut — Pittsburgh, and Pennsylvania as a whole, overreacted to the storm.
Pennsylvania’s efforts to prepare for Sandy seemed extreme when compared to the storm’s actual effects here. All Pittsburgh public schools cancelled last Tuesday’s classes in an announcement Monday night; since there was only mild rain and wind on Tuesday, this decision was made too quickly and too early by city officials. They could have at least waited to make that decision on Tuesday morning, the day of the hurricane, when they saw the actual storm and its minimal effects.
Pittsburgh only received two-and-a-half inches of rain because of the hurricane, which — while above the average rainfall for October in the state — was still minor when compared to New York’s and New Jersey’s flooding. The highest tide of 13 feet that rose in the New York Harbor poured into the city, all seven tunnels under the East River were flooded, high tides put much of New Jersey’s Seaside Heights’ boardwalk and 85 percent of Atlantic City underwater, and Ground Zero was flooded with 20 feet of water.
Instead of creating 58 stationary evacuation centers throughout the state, which — according to the The Pittsburgh Post-Gazette — were not guaranteed to be used, Pennsylvania could have better allotted its time and resources by making more mobile Red Cross emergency vehicles,  increasing its current 100.
As weather detection is an imprecise science, meteorologists in Pennsylvania were unsure of where to build evacuation centers. None of those centers could have been used if they were constructed in the wrong locations. In fact, very few evacuation centers were even used in Pennsylvania because of inconvenient locations and the minimal impact of the storm. However, more mobile emergency vehicles would have been useful because they can help any victim in any location.
The destruction created by Hurricane Sandy in Pennsylvania shouldn’t be overlooked or underestimated. But the scope of the state’s reaction to the storm, as well as the inefficient implementation of evacuation centers, should be evaluated for how Pennsylvania and Pittsburgh responds to future natural disasters.

Disney officials announced last Tuesday that the company was buying Lucasfilm for $4.05 billion and would release Star Wars Episode VII in 2015. 
Created by filmmaker George Lucas, Lucasfilm produced the Star Wars and Indiana Jones films, in addition to running subsidiary businesses in audio and special effects. 
The acquisition of Lucasfilm presents Disney with a significant opportunity. The desire to expand the Star Wars movie universe with another trilogy of films may prove extremely profitable and successful, but may also backfire. However, if these films prove to be critical successes, they offer the potential to reinvigorate the Star Wars brand and restore faith in the franchise after three disappointing prequels. 
Star Wars already suffered, not financially, but creatively, from these three prequels overseen by Lucas. While Lucas is only slated to contribute to the new series as a creative consultant, any more mishandling of the franchise may leave a permanent mark on Star Wars. 
Despite the large amount of negativity and uncertainty surrounding this announcement, it is also important to acknowledge that Disney has proved to be a successful manager of other well-known brands. The most recent example is Marvel, which released the Joss Whedon-directed The Avengers to great critical and financial success. However, more involvement on Disney’s part does not always result in success, as Pixar’s latest offerings Cars 2 and Brave received less favorable receptions than any of Pixar’s previous works. 
But Disney knows how to market a movie. Cars 2, despite being the worst-reviewed Pixar film, still turned a massive profit. For a franchise that has had a shaky recent history, this marketing skill could be valuable. But whether it will succeed in producing high quality Star Wars films, however, remains to be seen.
Disney is perfectly capable of creating quality films, and will reap the inevitable financial profits that will come from the release of a new Star Wars film. 
Unfortunately, it remains unclear as to whether the company will try to do this or not. Let us hope that decent screenwriters and directors sign on for these movies and help to restore the magic of this classic franchise.

It’s gonna be okay. Just look under your bed.
Sometimes you get to complain, and sometimes you have to listen to others complain. Karma will shine on you in the end.
Don’t be so quick to judge or write off the person you have been ignoring this semester. They just might surprise you in the next few weeks.
They say not to read into things too much, but for you, that seemingly innocent text you received from a “friend” means more than you think.
It’s nice to see that the world is being nice to you, but are you being nice to the world? Don’t brush this seemingly silly question aside and miss the answer that will greatly impact your future.
No wonder you have so many more friends in the winter than in the summer. You are such a warm, caring person that people can’t resist flocking to you.
Rules were made to be broken, but sometimes you take this liberty a bit too far. You may be able to get away with it, but the real question is whether or not you should.
Stop judging those who haven’t gotten job offers yet or who are still searching for things to do after college. Instead, take a long hard look at yourself and pray that when you leave school, you’ll be doing something that you love.
You’re, you’re late 
For a very important date 
No time to run, no time to hide
You... wait, you have a date?
Have a think, it will come to you.
You get to decide how you feel. Don’t reject those who try to help you, but make up your own mind.
You deserve a pick-me-up for the rough few weeks you have been having. Go to the following video and feel better: http://youtu.be/oivWKzaVOO4.
