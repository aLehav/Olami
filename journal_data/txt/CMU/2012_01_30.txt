After winning five of its first 10 non-conference games this season, the women’s basketball team is making improvements from last season’s 2–23 record.
The start of the University Athletic Association (UAA) conference, however, was a reminder that the Tartans and new head coach Jacqueline Hullah still have a long road ahead of them before returning to the upper echelon of the UAA.
The women’s basketball team has continued its struggle to find conference success as the team lost its first five UAA games, which included losses to three top-10, nationally-ranked teams: University of Chicago, University of Rochester, and Washington University in St. Louis. In those five games, the Tartans were outscored by an average of 22 points.
According to first-year guard Gabrielle West, the team’s focus is finishing the remaining month of the season on a high note.
“The mentality of the team in this final month of the season is one of hunger,” West said. “We have come so far and learned so much from the beginning of the season to now, and we really want to put all of the finishing touches together to get some wins in our conference.”
This past Friday night, that hunger was momentarily satiated as the Tartans earned their first conference win of the season and broke their four-game losing streak with a 65–48 win over New York University. The win moved the Tartans to an overall record of 7–10.
Leading the offensive attack against the NYU Violets were West and junior forward Emily Peel.
West finished the game with 15 points, while Peel led with 18 points. Sophomore guard Jacqueline Shaw also had quite a night, recording her second double-double of the season with 10 points and 10 boards.
In order to carry the momentum from Friday’s contest into the season’s remaining games, the team will rely on defensive consistency and look to leading scorers Peel and West to maintain their shooting inside the paint and beyond the arc.
Peel is among the top 10 in eight statistical categories of the UAA, which include her 15.5 points (second), 9.8 rebounds (second), and 1.9 blocks (first) per game. She has also been named the UAA Athlete of the Week two times this season and has even gained a place on the D3hoops.com Team of the Week. The website recognizes top performances on the basketball court across Division-III colleges. 
Guided by the leadership of Peel and other upperclassmen, West has quickly made the transition to college-level basketball and has found a way to make consistent contributions to the Tartans, especially on the offensive end of the floor.
“At this caliber of play, most of the game is mental,” West said. “At the end of the day, you just have to go out on the court and play basketball for the love of the game.”
West is second on the team in scoring, with 12.9 points per game. Her 40.2 percent shooting from beyond the three-point line is ranked second on the team as well.
The Tartans return home this weekend to open up the second round of conference play.
The stage will be set on Friday and Saturday in Skibo Gymnasium for rematches against NYU and Brandeis University, which the team faced yesterday in a 56–67 loss.

The Carnegie Mellon men’s basketball team is about three-fourths of the way through the 2011–2012 season, and the team sits on a record of 7–11 (2–5 in UAA play).
The Tartans’ shooting and offensive execution is a key determinant of wins and losses. Dating back to last season, they won 15 regular-season games in a row when shooting above 50 percent from the floor. Last Friday, the Tartans upset the New York University Violets by shooting 55 percent from the field. However, in the previous four games — which were all defeats — the Tartans shot just 44.1 percent.
“In those games we lost I would say our main issue was  a lack of execution,” said sophomore guard Marshall Massengale. “In the games we won, we played as one cohesive unit, sharing the ball offensively.”
Despite the sub-.500 record, the younger members on the team seem to be creating a promising season.
Sophomore forward Christian Manoli and sophomore guard Rashaun Riley lead the Tartans in scoring with 11.6 and 11.5 points per game, respectively. Manoli’s 4.8 rebounds per game, 35 assists, and 10 blocks rank third on the team, putting together a well-rounded stat line this season.
Riley is shooting 49 percent from the field, including 45.5 percent from the three-point line. While those numbers also place him third on the team, he has shot the ball significantly more than his two teammates with higher percentages.
Sophomore guard Asad Meghani is also contributing to the Tartans’ rising records. He is averaging 8.0 points per game on 43.9 percent shooting, and an astounding 47.6 percent from behind the arc. His 16 points in the Tartans’ victory over the Violets led the team.
In addition to the younger team members, senior guard John Duhring is performing well during his last season for the Tartans, averaging 10.9 points per game and 4.9 rebounds per game. In the upset over the Violets, Duhring poured in 15 points, shooting six of seven from the field. During the four-game losing streak before the Tartans’ victory over NYU, Duhring averaged just 7.25 points. His production on offense is proving essential to the basketball team’s victories.
“John is a great leader because he leads by example, works hard in practice, and steps up in some games when we really need him,” Massengale said.
On Sunday, the Tartans lost to the Brandeis University Judges with a score of 80–67. Manoli scored 21 points, while junior guard Andre Moore added a career-high 19 points. However, the poor shooting remains a trend in the team’s losses, as Carnegie Mellon shot only 39.7 percent from the field during the game. Allowing the Judges to shoot 58.3 percent hurt the Tartans even more.
With only conference games remaining, if the Tartans step up, they could make a statement in UAA play. From now until Feb. 25, when Carnegie Mellon closes out the season against Case Western Reserve University, the Tartans will play five out of seven of those UAA games at home in Skibo Gymnasium.

As senior diver Eli Fatsi competes in his last season on the men’s swimming and diving team, he reflected on his athletic career at Carnegie Mellon. Fatsi is earning his bachelor’s degree in the Mellon College of Science as a math major.
Fatsi’s interest in swimming and diving began at a young age.
“All the neighborhood kids were on the swim team at the local pool every summer back in elementary school,” Fatsi said. “Swimming was way too hard, so I dove for a few years back then.”
Despite this interest, Fatsi did not start diving competitively until his junior year of high school, when he joined the team with his friend. “It was just for fun. I never thought I would actually be diving in college,” he said.
As a Carnegie Mellon athlete, Fatsi felt that being on a varsity team was a particularly rewarding experience. “It’s been awesome being a part of something for all four years [of college] but still having the time to enjoy everything else I love to do,” he said. “Seeing how far we’ve all progressed since we showed up as freshmen, it’s pretty remarkable.”
Fatsi has made a lot of progress since his first year at college; he even made nationals last year. With this feat, the diver now has lofty goals for himself during his final season. “Personally, I’m shooting for nationals; fellow senior Mike Alexovich and I made cuts last year, but didn’t make it to the meet,” Fatsi said. 
Specifically, Fatsi has high expectations for the team and has set tremendous personal goals for the rest of the season. “With so many freshman on the team, it would be great to take second place at UAA’s again and set the standard for them,” Fatsi said. “If Emory wasn’t so darn ridiculous, first place would be the goal, but they’re incredible.”
Fatsi explained that post-graduation he will primarily miss being on an athletic team. “I can’t imagine I’ll be around diving at all once I graduate, so I’ll clearly miss that. It’s kind of a kid sport,” he said.
Reflecting on the team’s leadership, Fatsi noted that he will also miss the diving coach after the season is over. “My coach, Alicia Gorman, is incredible as well. It’ll be sad not to have her around looking out for me,” Fatsi said.
Gorman agreed, saying that she will miss having Fatsi on the team. “Eli brings a lot of fun and focus to our team,” Gorman said. “Over the past four years he has pushed himself to the next level on a daily basis. He is a hard worker and all of his work is paying off. He always comes to practice with a smile and has fun no matter what he is doing. He has been a true pleasure to coach and I have enjoyed seeing him reach his goals.”
Fatsi reflected on his proudest moment throughout the course of his athletic career: “Last year, senior Mike Alexovich and I took down the school records last year at UAAs. He got the one-meter record and I took the three-meter one; we’ve both been the perfect competition for each other over the years, so taking down the records together was a pretty awesome moment.”
After graduation, Fatsi wants to cater to his adventurous side by skiing, mountain biking, kayaking, backpacking, and climbing in Colorado. He would also like put his degree in math to good use. “I would like to make money programming somehow, like Aron Ralston but hopefully not too much like Aron Ralston,” he joked.

Super Bowls define careers: They separate good players from great players. As we look toward Super Bowl XLVI, we look at crossroads in the careers of two very different quarterbacks. Tom Brady, the New England Patriots’ veteran quarterback, will face Eli Manning, the New York Giants’ quarterback and little brother of Indianapolis Colts’ quarterback Peyton Manning.
Brady is the golden boy who was picked 199th in the NFL draft and wasn’t even a full-time starter in college, while Manning is a high-pedigree, four-year college starter who has struggled to step out of his famous family’s shadow.
Walking off the field in Super Bowl XLII, Manning was the top player and had just completed one of the greatest upsets of all time. Brady, meanwhile, was handed a crushing defeat that still stings him today. On that night, both of their career paths changed completely. Brady lost his aura of invincibility and Manning gained the respect and recognition he had been fighting for throughout his career.
Now, four years later, we are looking at another career-changing moment for these two quarterbacks. On Sunday night, their legacies will be even more tied together, forever linked.
This game will change not only how people will view each of them, but also how people view at Super Bowl XLII. This is a rare opportunity to rewrite history. This Sunday, Brady and Manning are not just playing for themselves but for their legacies, along with the legacies of those connected to them — past and present.
A win on Sunday would allow Manning to take another huge step out of his brother’s shadow. He would solidify his preseason claim of being an elite quarterback in the league and silence most of his critics. 
Winning another Super Bowl would turn Manning into one of the best clutch quarterbacks of all time, forcing people to focus on his record-setting 15 fourth-quarter touchdowns and his 110 fourth-quarter passing rating. Another Super Bowl win and people would no longer be debating whether he deserves the Pro Bowl, but rather if he is worthy of the Hall of Fame.
However, a loss would add doubt. Losing would increase suspicions that 2007 was a fluke. Falling to the Patriots would devalue all the work he has done to become his own person and not just Peyton’s little brother. Defeat would leave Manning in the category of good NFL quarterbacks, not great ones.
Winning for Brady would mean being considered one of the best quarterbacks of all time. With a win, Brady would prove that defense doesn’t win championships — record-breaking quarterback play and great tight ends do. Victory would show that Brady doesn’t need superb coaches or receivers to achieve greatness. With a victory in Indianapolis, the ghosts of 2007 would fade away.
On the other hand, a loss would show decline. A defeat would leave Brady’s record barely over .500 in the playoffs since 2006, after starting his career 10-0. 
Losing would make people question if Brady is a good enough quarterback to win big games on his own, without a great defensive or offensive talent to back him up. A loss would have critics questioning if Brady was coasting on his former glory.
This Sunday, the legacies of two men will be changed forever. Between the funny commercials and the lavish halftime performance, these quarterbacks will fight for how history and critics will view them.
In the end, it may be out of their hands as they watch hopelessly from the sidelines. But after it’s all over, when one is raising the Vince Lombardi trophy and the other is sulking in the locker room, both of their paths will be changed.
The winner will have silenced the critics and proved his worth; the loser will have a new chorus of doubters questioning if he’s worth the praise.

The Carnegie Mellon swimming and diving team hosted its final home meet this past Saturday against Denison University, last year’s national champions.
The women lost with an overall score of 164–120, and the men also fell to the Big Red 178-114.
Performing consistently well throughout the season, sophomore Soleil Phan won the 100-yard freestyle race in 54.19. Phan later came in second in the 200-yard freestyle with a time of 1:55.44, improving her time in the event by over three seconds since the first meet of the season at the University of Rochester.
First-year Kelley Sheehan also made an impression in the pool during the course of her first season with Tartan athletics. As a member of the victorious 400-yard medley and 200-yard medley relay at Rochester back in October, Sheehan continued to come through strong at the meet last Saturday, placing fourth in the 100-yard backstroke. She also placed fourth in the 500-yard freestyle of 5:16.25, finishing with a season-best time.
In her last home meet, senior Olivia DeFazio placed second in the one-meter diving board with 228.75 points, a season best for her. She has been a part of Carnegie Mellon’s swimming and diving team for four years.
“As a team, the swimmers and divers show great support for each member,” DeFazio said. “It’s impressive how the unofficial leaders on the team set such high standards for the newer members. It’s been an exciting four years as a member of the team, and I know my college experience has been far better because of my involvement.”
On the men’s team, sophomore Eddie Sears has been swimming consistently well throughout the season — including the 400-yard medley relay, 200-yard medley, and 50-yard freestyle. 
At Saturday’s meet, Sears finished the 50-yard freestyle in third place with a time of 22.03.
Sophomore Austin Bohn also swam well this season, earning two NCAA “B” cuts at the Nike Cup at the end of the fall. Against Denison, Bohn placed fourth in the 100-yard breaststroke with 1:01.28.
Competing in his final home meet, senior Eli Fatsi finished fifth on the one-meter board with 274.34 points and sixth on the three-meter board with 273.08 points. In his final season with Carnegie Mellon swimming and diving, Fatsi nearly broke both of the school diving pool records, beating the one-meter record while just missing the three-meter record by a few points.
“This has been my best year so far, as I was hoping it would be being my last year here,” Fatsi said. “Our conference has gotten pretty strong since I was a freshman. Teams that used to be guaranteed wins [for us] suddenly have some great divers and fast swimmers. With so many freshman on the team, it’ll be nice to set the bar high for them.”
The women’s volleyball team attended the swim and dive meet to support their fellow Tartan athletes.
“It was my first time watching a diving competition,” said Amy Friedman, a sophomore architecture major and defensive specialist on the volleyball team. “It was amazing to see the complex dives.”
The Tartans will be competing this Saturday at the University of Pittsburgh. The meet is scheduled to begin at 11:30 a.m.

With the All-Star weekend in the rear-view mirror, the Pittsburgh Penguins come back to their regular season with a seven-game winning streak. Before this streak, the Penguins had a six-game losing streak, which left fans groveling for the return of captain Sidney Crosby, who is on the disabled list with a concussion. For avid followers, the leader of the Penguins’ surge is by no means a mystery. Center and alternate captain Evgeni Malkin’s dominance on the ice has the Penguins playing their best hockey of the 2011–12 season.
Malkin, being a four-time All-Star and former NHL Rookie of the Year, is not surprising anybody with his excellent play. The expectations for Malkin are extremely high, especially while Crosby is still on the disabled list. For the Penguins to succeed without Crosby, Malkin has to lead this team.
Throughout this seven-game streak of victories — including big wins against the Florida Panthers, St. Louis Blues, and New York Rangers — Malkin has been in the center of the offense. He scored a goal in all but one of the seven games, scoring in the shootout of the last game. During this streak, he is averaging 1.87 points and 1.29 goals per game.
Even with the Penguins’ success guided by Malkin, no one would ever question Crosby’s position as the captain and leader of the team — until now. Crosby is currently seeing a doctor in California to rehabilitate from his recurring concussions, while Malkin has the Penguins putting together an unbelievable string of wins. Maybe it is time to take the captain title away from Crosby and let Malkin wear the “C” on his jersey.
Before Penguins fans have a tantrum, let me provide some clarification. I know how much Crosby means to the team and to Pittsburgh. I know, when healthy, that Crosby is the best player in the NHL. However, the caveat in his greatness is his health. In just seven seasons, Crosby has missed 120 games, primarily due to concussions. It doesn’t matter how dominant a player he is if he isn’t on the ice.
When Crosby is playing, he makes the Penguins better — I am not disputing that. But given the state of the team, Crosby’s health, and Malkin’s play, why not make Malkin the captain? It is just a title, but Malkin has earned that title. Team owners Mario Lemieux and Ron Burkle, as well as head coach Dan Bylsma, hold the right to give captaincy back to Crosby if they desire, but while he is rehabilitating on the West Coast, they should pay Malkin his dues.
I understand that the captain’s job includes speaking to the referees, an aspect that the Russian-born Malkin might struggle with. This is a valid concern, but the Penguins have alternate captains. Malkin is the point leader this season, even after missing seven games this season. He is leading the Penguins’ rise to the top in the Eastern Conference. They now find themselves ranked fifth, after hovering in and out of the playoff picture.
I pondered the prospects of Bylsma and the owners letting Crosby leave or trading him to open up cap space, but the NHL is as much a business as it is a competition. His popularity in Pittsburgh is unmatched by any other hockey player, so perhaps I should put a halt to my thoughts of demoting Crosby. If he comes back with another hockey team, reemerges as the greatest player in the game today, and stays healthy, I will have to bite my tongue — so hard, that I would bite it off.
For now, regardless of how strong the love for Crosby is in this city, the Penguins should stick with a winning strategy: Put the “C” on Malkin’s chest.

Can computers be artists? Scott Draves, a Ph.D. graduate from Carnegie Mellon’s School of Computer Science and developer of the Electric Sheep project, has answered that question with a definitive “yes.”
Draves, who now works as an engineer in the mapping division at Google Inc., gave a talk last Monday at the Gates Hillman Complex about the project. He recalled how Electric Sheep began with his image-generating Flame Algorithm, which he finalized in 1991 and later released as open source in 1993. 
The algorithm works by solving a massive, non-deterministic equation with thousands of parameters and millions of variables. Because the algorithm is non-deterministic, it generates a unique image every time it is run. The highly fluid and organic images that result are commonly known as Flames.
“It takes a long time for the computer to draw these pictures,” Draves explained. “It takes hours to render just one frame. Back then, in the early nineties, that’s all I was able to do ... but now, with much faster computers and with thousands of computers working together, we can actually make large-scale, animated artworks.”
The animated works Draves referred to come from his Electric Sheep project, a free program that perpetually generates Flames using his algorithm. When a computer enabled with Electric Sheep goes into screensaver mode, the Flames are strewn together into a highly abstract video. Since each Flame is a new and unique image, the computer then shares the image with other computers over the internet.
Over time, Draves added additional components to the project, including the ability for users to “like” or “dislike” certain Electric Sheep screensavers using the keyboard, telling the algorithm what sort of images to create.
Many computer users are fond of the project. According to a recent post on Draves’ blog, there are approximately 500,000 active users of the software, some of whom are Carnegie Mellon students.
“I’ve played around with the Electric Sheep screensaver before,” said Joe Frazier, a junior computer science major who attended the talk. “I thought it was really neat to see the guy who sort of came up with it all. It was good to see what his perspective on it was.”
Draves is receiving ongoing recognition for his Flame Algorithm and Electric Sheep project. His work has been featured in the Museum of Modern Art in New York City and at the Art Basel art show in Miami. 
His work has also appeared in Discover and Wired magazines. Flames have also been used in all sorts of media, ranging from big-budget films to book covers. The popular Flame editor Apophysis utilizes Draves’ algorithm.
“Generation 243,” one of Draves’ original Electric Sheep screensavers, is currently featured on a 24/7 display on campus in the Gates Hillman Complex. The School of Computer Science also recently purchased “Generation 244,” the next work in the series.
Draves, who is involved in numerous other artistic projects, also touched on a website he created called “Video Riot.” The site uses Javascript and WebGL to distort and colorize a Youtube video that a user can specify with a link. The project is located at sp0t.org/videoriot. 
Electric Sheep can be found at electricsheep.org.

Last year was plagued with monetary losses from tropical cyclones — Hurricane Irene was estimated to cost over $7 billion in damages alone, according to ABC News. With some scientists predicting an increase in intense weather due to the sea’s rising surface temperatures, it is becoming increasingly important to protect coastal populations. Researchers at Carnegie Mellon and Massachusetts Institute of Technology have collaborated to study the cost effectiveness of different approaches to storm management and to look at possibilities for the future.
Postdoctoral researchers Kelly Klima and Iris Grossmann and professor M. Granger Morgan — all from Carnegie Mellon’s department of engineering and public policy — conducted research that compared different preventative approaches with hypothetical tropical cyclones in five regions in Florida’s Miami-Dade County. Their research was published in a recent issue of Environmental Science and Technology.
The researchers ran model simulations to compare two categories of preventative methods. “Hardening” focuses on the physical alteration or the building of structures, such as raising homes on stilts or building a barrier that would help block the excessive flooding associated with storm surge. “Hurricane modifications” use wind-wave pumps to lower sea surface temperature and lessen a hurricane’s intensity. Both of these methods were tested against storm surge damages and wind damages separately.
When running the simulations with the different scenarios, the researchers tested the preventative methods on conditions under what they referred to as “return periods,” which range from 10 to 1,000 years. For example, choosing a 1,000-year return period for their model simulation meant that on average, severe storm conditions would only occur once in 1,000 years. A 10-year return period, therefore, would assume intense storms  occur once every 10 years, on average.
The initial tests showed that the wind and storm surges’ intensity would generally reduce with a lower sea surface temperature. It is important to note, however, that each region tested had slightly different results.
When the researchers compared the costs of the different preventions and adaptations for surge damage, they found that building a storm barrier would be the most cost-effective solution for hurricane damage prevention.
“Many in the community think that dams are very expensive and are not always a good return, so [the fact that it was the most cost effective] was surprising,” Klima said. The researchers also found that certain methods were more helpful for different regions. Although a surge barrier was effective for most regions, other options such as “hardening” were actually more helpful for some regions with a 1,000-year return period.
For wind, the results were similar across the board for the five regions. A combination of all the preventions would be the best to help protect outlying areas from cyclone damage. 
However, there is still much that the research leaves unanswered. For one, all the data on lowering sea temperatures assumes that, as Klima said, “the wind-wave pumps work [how] the scientists say they should.”
For many, that is a big assumption. The idea of hurricane modification is not new, but past attempts may have discouraged future research. An article in EARTH magazine mentions scientists’ aversion to hurricane geoengineering, citing a failed government experiment in weather modification named Project Stormfury. Until recently, there has been little attempt at hurricane modification since Stormfury. 
The public has a negative perception on hurricane modification. After interviewing Florida residents, Klima noted, “Something that potentially modifies the storm is not going to be acceptable for a very long time.” 
In her previous paper “Public Perceptions of Hurricane Modifcation,” she explained that the practice was publicly perceived as “relatively ineffective.”
Moreover, there is still a missing link in terms of how much damage storm surge and wind cause jointly. Although the researchers were able to run the data and compare cost-effective strategies against wind and surge separately, they currently do not have data on the exact relationship between the damages of wind and storm surge together.
With extensive cost analysis, Klima has given all of her research to the Miami-Dade County government. It is now up to the policymakers to determine what is best for the future of hurricane adaptation and modification.
Klima has faith. “Policymakers are pretty smart people,” she said. “They try to do the right things.”

In September of 1919, President Woodrow Wilson spoke to a crowd of nearly 50,000 at San Diego’s Balboa Stadium in favor of his proposed League of Nations. In addition to the excitement surrounding a visit from the president, the Journal of San Diego History reported that those in attendance also witnessed a major triumph in technological history: It was the first time the president had used an electric device to capture his voice, and after amplification, make his voice heard to a large live audience. That device was a microphone.
The microphone was invented years before Wilson’s speech, by German-born American inventor Emile Berliner in 1876, according to the journal Technology and Culture. Wilson’s speech is just one illustration of how microphones were first used. Today, microphones have countless applications: telephones, hearing aids, radio, television, and motion picture productions. Over the years, the microphone has changed in shape and form. However, it has retained the same identity at its core: A microphone is a transducer, which converts one form of energy into another. In the case of the microphone, sound is converted into electrical signal. 
Sound exists as a result of air vibrations and changes in air pressure, and there are several ways that microphones capture those changes and turn them into electric currents. Two of the most common forms are “dynamic” and “condenser” microphones.
A dynamic microphone operates through a concept called electromagnetic induction. Put simply, sound waves travel past a small metal plate called a diaphragm, which is attached to a coil of wire surrounded by a magnet. When the coil vibrates within the magnetic field in response to sound, electric current is produced, thus converting sound energy into electric energy.
Condenser microphones operate on different principles. In these microphones, sound waves cause two electrically-charged metal plates to vibrate. These two metal plates are collectively known as a capacitor. The microphone’s diaphragm acts as one of the plates of the capacitor, and when the distance between the two plates changes as they vibrate in response to sound, electric current is produced.
One key difference between condenser and dynamic microphones is that the use of a capacitor in a condenser microphone requires a source of power, whether it is a battery inside the microphone or some external power source. A dynamic microphone, on the other hand, can operate without any source of electricity.
There are several other types of microphones, such as the ribbon microphone — which produces electrical current when a metal ribbon vibrates in response to sound within a magnetic field — and the electret microphone — which is a type of condenser microphone that is commonly used in devices such as cell phones and computers. 
One of the first microphones, the carbon button microphone, consists of two metal plates that are separated by compacted carbon granules. When sound enters the microphone, the vibrations induce a change in pressure between the granules. An electric current traveling through the granules changes in response to the change in pressure.
Microphones have come a long way since their creation in the late 19th century. Today, microphones can capture sound from specific directions relative to the direction the microphone is pointed. For example, omnidirectional microphones capture sound in all directions, while “shotgun” microphones focus on one certain direction and are relatively insensitive to other directions.
Despite these additional features and improvements in microphone sensitivity, the inner workings have remained the same and enable society to communicate through sound, and preserve those sounds over time.

Exposure to PFCs could reduce immune response
A recent study suggests that exposure to perfluorinated compounds (PFCs) can reduce immune response to vaccines. These compounds have been used for decades and are most commonly found in nonstick coatings and food packaging. Studies in animals have already suggested that PFCs suppress immune response, but the effects of PFCs in humans have not been well understood. 
The study, led by researchers at Harvard University, examined how children with high levels of PFC exposure responded to vaccinations. The results showed that five-year-old children with higher PFC levels had weaker responses to diphtheria vaccines, suggesting a possible link between PFC exposure to an underdeveloped immune system. The EPA is already taking measures to eliminate certain PFCs in manufactured products.

Magnetically responsive soaps could aid in oil spill
Chemists at the University of Bristol in the U.K. recently developed magnetically responsive soap that can potentially be used to clean up oils without leaving behind harmful residues. To make the soap, the researchers dissolved iron particles in water that contained chlorine and bromine ions, common materials found in household cleaning products. The soap molecules contain metal centers, which allow them to be controlled by magnetic fields. 
Using magnets, researchers were able to pull the soap through layered solutions of water and oil and demonstrate a simple way to recover the soap from the bulk solution. The physical properties of most soaps are controlled by temperature and pH, so the addition of magnetic functionality introduces another design parameter for creating new soap compounds.

New definition of autism is more stringent
For the first time in 17 years, the American Psychiatric Association is reassessing the definitions of autism and related disorders. Researchers from Yale University have performed a preliminary analysis on the potential impacts of this new definition  of autism by assessing data from a 1993 study on children and adults with autistic disorders. They determined the fraction of those individuals that would no longer be considered autistic under the proposed definition. 
Their results showed that 55 percent of high-functioning individuals would no longer qualify as autistic under the new definition, whereas only 25 percent of those previously diagnosed with “classic autism” would no longer be diagnosed with autism. Narrowing the criteria for autistic disorders would make it more difficult for individuals to qualify for health, educational, and social services.

North Star slowly fading away in the night sky
The North Star, also known as Polaris, may be shrinking according to a group of German astrophysicists. Over 160 years of observations suggest that the star, which sits over the North Pole because of its alignment with the Earth’s axis, may be shedding an amount of gas equivalent to Earth’s mass every year. The scientists measured the star’s pulse — the length of time between periods when the star grows dimmer and brighter. The data show that since 1844, the star’s pulse has been decreasing, on average, about 4.5 seconds every year. The changing rate is higher than what would normally be assumed to match the standard model for stellar evolution, suggesting that the star may actually be shrinking.

Apple posts $13 billion in profits from latest quarter
Apple Inc. recently released figures for its first quarter earnings, which shattered sales records in several categories. Apple executives are “very happy to have generated over $17.5 billion in cash flow from operations during the December quarter,” according to Peter Oppenheimer, Apple’s chief financial officer. 
The reported net profit of $13.06 billion this quarter is over twice the reported profits from last year, and several products have experienced growth in sales. A record 37 million iPhone units and 15.4 million iPads were sold this year, which rounds out to 128 and 111 percent, respectively, in unit gains compared to the previous year. The success of the iPhone as a smart phone and portable audio device comes at the expense of the iPod, which was the only product line to experience a decline in sales.

China to finally set cap on carbon emissions
The Chinese government has called for seven cities and provinces to set caps on their greenhouse gas emissions. This is the first time the Chinese government has ordered any absolute caps on emissions, previously setting “carbon intensity” targets. This act is one of the first concrete steps that the country has taken  to address climate issues. 
Thus far, the Chinese government has delayed in setting a national cap on greenhouse gas emissions, citing the need for prioritizing economic growth. Rather than placing an absolute cap on emissions, targets have instead been set in terms of an amount of greenhouse gas per unit of GDP. The current five-year plan requires the country to reduce carbon dioxide emissions by 17 percent per unit of GDP.

“Farewell, my library! Farewell, the house of wisdom, the abode of philosophers, a house and witness for literature! How many sleepless nights I spent there, reading and writing, the night is silent and the people asleep. Goodbye, my books! I know not what has become of you after we left: Were you looted? Burnt? Have you been ceremonially transferred to a private or public library? Did you end up on the shelves of grocery stores with your pages used to wrap onions?”
In this excerpt from That’s the Way I Am, Gentlemen: From the Diary of Khalil al-Sakakini, the late Palestinian poet Khalil al-Sakakini mourns the loss of his priceless books. Al-Sakakini had fled his home in the Katamon neighborhood of Jerusalem in the 1948 Arab-Israeli War, leaving behind a vast trove of Palestinian literature. He settled in Cairo two months later, never to see his beloved books again.
Israelis consider 1948 as the year they fought for independence. Meanwhile, Palestinians consider 1948 as the year of al-Nakba, a mass exodus of 711,000 to 750,000 Palestinians from their homes.
Al-Sakakini’s story was not unique. Between May 1948 and February 1949, the nascent state of Israel seized approximately 70,000 books belonging to Palestinians as the exodus was occurring. To many scholars of the Israel-Palestine conflict, this initiative was not merely a collection of books, but a systematic looting — one that represented the theft of Palestinian culture as well.
“What is important about the looting of the books [is that] it is part of the appropriation of the cultural essence of this land [Palestine], which is not different from the appropriation of the territories, the houses, the natural resources, and everything that Palestine had — even its history — could be and should have been part of the new Jewish state,” said Israeli-Jewish historian Ilan Pappé in the trailer for a film documenting al-Nakba.
A new project titled The Great Book Robbery, described as a “multifaceted cultural heritage project” on its website, aims to bring the story of the 1948 Arab-Israeli War and al-Nakba to light, while identifying the books’ rightful owners. The project includes the production of a documentary film and the creation of a virtual library for the books.
The Great Book Robbery began with an accidental discovery. In 2006, while searching for reference material at the Jewish National and University Library at Hebrew University, Israeli graduate student Gish Amit stumbled upon documents detailing the plunder of books from Palestinian homes. In an article in The Jerusalem Quarterly, Amit detailed the transfer of books that took place between 1948 and 1949 by the staff of the National Library of Israel.
These librarians collected 30,000 books, manuscripts, and newspapers from western Jerusalem that were left behind by Palestinian denizens during the course of the war and after the depopulation of Palestinian villages. They then transferred approximately 6,000 of those books to the National Library’s Eastern Studies Department and deemed them “abandoned property.” In 1948 and subsequent years, employees of the Custodian of Absentee Property gathered an additional 40,000 to 50,000 books from other cities in historic Palestine, including Jaffa, Haifa, Tiberias, and Nazareth.
Some 26,000 books, however, fared worse: In 1957, the Israeli government deemed that these books “contained inciting materials against the State [of Israel]” and recycled them as paper waste.
Members of The Great Book Robbery — which include historians, filmmakers, students, journalists, and many others who advocate on behalf of Palestinian causes — seek to take stock of the remaining books and identify their owners through a massive digital library, which contains 500 of the original 6,000 books labeled as “abandoned property.” The Great Book Robbery’s other primary objective is education.
Israeli-Dutch filmmaker Benny Brunner, a member of The Great Book Robbery’s staff who is based in Amsterdam, has made a documentary titled The Great Book Robbery, which recounts the looting of Palestinian books. The film, which is finished and currently undergoing editing, will be released in May 2012.
The website for The Great Book Robbery includes a forum section, which provides a space for those interested in the project to discuss the events of 1948 and to contribute to the discourse concerning a wide spectrum of issues pertaining to Palestinian identity and culture.
To many Palestinians, especially those who bore witness to the events of 1948, The Great Book Robbery is also an effort to reclaim Palestinian cultural and ethnic identity. Amit asserted that the collection of Palestinian books by Israelis constitutes a theft of Palestinian culture. In The Jerusalem Quarterly, he wrote, “This untold story of the fate of Palestinian ‘abandoned’ books clearly demonstrates how occupation and colonization is not limited to the taking over of physical space. Rather, it achieves its fulfillment by occupying cultural space as well, and by turning the cultural artifacts of the victims into ownerless objects with no past.”
The Great Book Robbery allows for communication and interaction among a wide array of individuals interested in the preservation of Palestinian culture. As such, its staff, contributors, and supporters hail from across the globe. Here in Pittsburgh, University of Pittsburgh student Karina Goulordava, vice president of the university’s Students for Justice in Palestine chapter, is lending her efforts to The Great Book Robbery.
As part of its staff, Goulordava — graduating this year with a bachelor of arts in Spanish, communication-rhetoric, and Arabic — plays an important role in disseminating media regarding The Great Book Robbery and garnering publicity for the project.
“I’m the communication manager. My primary task is to get publicity for the project. On a daily basis, I run our Facebook and Twitter,” Goulordava said. “I also scan the internet every once in a while to see if any new press has been written about us.”
Goulordava also contacts writers to contribute to the website’s forum. She explained the significance of the section: “We contact professors, scholars, students, filmmakers, journalists, authors, and librarians — anyone who has an opinion about The Great Book Robbery. They write a piece for us and we publish it on the forum. [For] something this important, you don’t want to just put the information out there. You want to create a discussion about this, and you want to talk about why it is important.”
Individuals here in Pittsburgh have contributed to the discourse, thanks to Goulordava’s efforts. Tom Twiss, a librarian from the University of Pittsburgh’s Hillman Library, wrote an article for the forum titled “The Destruction of Palestinian Library and Cultural Resources in 2002.” Goulordava has booked interviews published on The Great Book Robbery’s website with Pappé and Palestinian academic Ghada Karmi from the University of Exeter in the United Kingdom.
The Great Book Robbery does more than illuminate a new aspect of a fraught subject; it demonstrates that the events of al-Nakba had other consequences than the physical displacement of Palestinians. To the members of The Great Book Robbery, Israel uprooted the heart of Palestinian academic and intellectual culture. This comprehensive initiative pieces together a fragmented history of two nations.

Last Friday, the Pittsburgh Cultural Trust held its first quarterly Gallery Crawl of the year. The Gallery Crawl — which includes over 30 venues in 14 square blocks of the Cultural District — features local, national, and international artists and includes visual, audio, and performance art.
Darcy Kucenic, director of Highmark First Night Pittsburgh and manager of education and operations at the Pittsburgh Cultural Trust, manages the Gallery Crawls. She explained, “The winter Crawl is probably our smallest in attendance, because it’s, you know, winter. But we still get a couple of thousand people that come down.”
With so many venues involved and such a large number of attendees, planning the event is a long and complicated process.
Kucenic, who received her master’s degree in arts management from Carnegie Mellon in 2000, works with galleries to determine what type of work will be shown and then brings everything else together. “Based on what new exhibits are open, I manage the whole Gallery Crawl process. I invite other participating organizations in the district to have something and be in the Crawl,” Kucenic said. “Every Crawl is different, so it gives me a chance to bring in all different kinds of groups.”
The Pittsburgh Cultural Trust operates many of the galleries within the Cultural District, including Wood Street Galleries, Space Gallery, and 707 and 709 Galleries, among others.
Murray Horne, curator of Wood Street Galleries, provided some insight on what it’s like planning for the Gallery Crawl from a curatorial standpoint. “We’re always preparing a new show to open with the Gallery Crawl,” he said. “So it takes us about three weeks to prepare for that before the Crawl.”
Wood Street Galleries is known for displaying installation work and art based on technology. According to Horne, he’s most concerned about “the quality of the work and the variety of it” when planning exhibits.
For this Gallery Crawl, Norwegian artist HC Gilje explored the perception of space and time through light projection with his exhibit in transit. In his statement about the project, Gilje wrote, “I try to engage in a sort of conversation with the spaces I work with, to be able to transform an existing space or object using image, light, sound, and motion.”
He added, “Being able to control what is visible and when it is visible gives me the opportunity to influence both the perception of time and space.”
Down the street at Space Gallery was an exhibit titled Out of Rubble, which featured work from 16 international artists, including Wafaa Bilal, who gave a lecture at Carnegie Mellon last Tuesday. According to the gallery guide, the exhibit was focused on “the consequences of war, moving from decimation and disintegration to the possibilities of regeneration and recovery.” A combination of photography and mixed media pieces, the exhibit was politically charged and seemed to be a favorite among the younger crowd. 
Horne lauded the Gallery Crawl’s knack for presenting diverse work and the quality of the overall arts scene in Pittsburgh. “I think it’s really healthy when you can mix them up — create conceptual and visual buzz — and when the work [at different galleries] is different from each other and different from the previous shows.”
He added, “Cities like New York and L.A. have a really large private gallery scene that we can’t compete with. However, in the nonprofits, I think we can compete with anyone in the country, really. The quality of the work that’s shown in Pittsburgh is just outstanding.”
Gilje's in transit will remain at Wood Street Galleries through April 8.

My journey into Rome was a little less enchanting than I had first imagined. The cab ride from the airport to my apartment took me on a tour of the Eternal City that mostly showed me graffiti and garbage — not quite the romantic image I had from movies and television shows. Don’t get me wrong, Rome certainly has its locales of pure beauty, but I was shocked to see beautiful, neo-classical buildings defaced with signs of anarchy and vulgar statements about rival football (soccer) teams.
But I thought to myself: This is a big city, and graffiti and trash dominate all big cities. I had gone to Rome to take in all that it had to offer, so I decided to let the defacement slide and focus on the positives.
Living 10 minutes from St. Peter’s Square had its perks — namely, I was living 10 minutes from St. Peter’s Square. It was unreal that I could walk over and people-watch in front of the most important building in the entire Catholic faith. On one Sunday afternoon, I joined thousands of people in the square to watch the Pope speak from his window. Regardless of religious beliefs, the experience was something that words can’t adequately describe.
Geographically, I lived in the northwest part of the city. The area was mostly residential, as the tourist hot-spots were across the river and surrounding the center. The subway system definitely had its advantage of getting across central Rome, but only having two lines is a bit limiting. For example, there are no stops going to Trastevere, a popular nightlife part of town filled with restaurants, pubs, and nightclubs. This could have been a blessing in disguise, however. Rome is not exactly the worst city to walk around in. Passing by the Castel Sant’Angelo and the colossal Palazzaccio — the local courthouse with the affectionate nickname of the “Evil Palace” — on a night out made every journey to the clubs a little more scenic.
One of the biggest differences I noticed about daily life was the prevalence of outdoor markets. Whether the vendors were selling fruit, clothes, books, or trinkets, every other block seemed to have a tent or two offering anything and everything. The grandfather of outdoor markets, without a doubt, was Porta Portese. In south-central Rome, this outdoor market only occurs in the early hours of Sunday mornings, but it is certainly worth a visit. It’s about a mile long, with a side street connecting to another half-mile stretch of tents. There are lots of hidden treasures — like five ties for five euros — if you are patient enough to stroll through the market’s entirety.
While in Rome, I saw all the famous sights, but I also discovered one of Rome’s best-kept secrets: Dolce Maniera. It’s a bakery that’s open 24 hours a day, seven days a week. Only 10 minutes from my apartment, it was a popular pit stop on my way home after a night out. Fifty-euro-cent Nutella-filled donuts always satisfied my 3 a.m. sweet-tooth cravings. At the end of my time abroad, and with a 4:30 a.m. flight back to the United States, this bakery was the site of my last meal in Rome — and I wouldn’t have had it any other way.
Another little-known locale is a Steelers bar. Yes, all the way over in Italy is a small bar called La Botticella that shows every Steelers game live on a projection screen. This certainly was a nice taste of home. In May 2009, the bar was featured in an article in the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette with information about the bar and an interview with the owner.
On one of my last days, I took the first subway ride of the morning at 5:30 a.m. to see some of the popular monuments without the swarming crowd of tourists. Someone had recommended this to me, and it was certainly worth waking up so early. The beautiful thing about Rome is that all of the major landmarks are within walking distance of each other.
I started at my favorite spot, Trevi Fountain, and there were only a handful of people there. A few minutes down the road was the Colosseum with just one other person walking around. When I made my way to the Spanish Steps, there wasn’t a soul. The most popular tourist spots, the main pedestrian boulevards, and the subway stations were all deserted. In a city of almost 3 million people and thousands of tourists every day, it’s definitely not something you see often.
Now that I’m back in Pittsburgh, I still wonder if those few months in Rome really happened. When I walk outside, I see the Cathedral of Learning, but just a few months ago I would have seen the dome of St. Peter’s Basilica. It was hard to grasp while I was there, but being home and seeing a map — knowing exactly where my apartment was, tracing my daily route to school, following the river to the major monuments — reminds me that it was real, and it’s an experience I’ll never forget.

Looking at Wafaa Bilal — clad in a gray sweater, pink collared shirt, and dress pants — you would never guess that he spent the past year with a camera surgically implanted in the back of his head as an artistic endeavor. The first artist of the College of Fine Arts’ spring lecture series, Bilal delivered his presentation to a nearly-packed Kresge Theater last Monday. Bilal gave an hour-long presentation explaining the intentions behind many of his pieces, then opened up the presentation for questions for half an hour. As an Iraqi-born artist, many of his pieces deal with challenging social and political comfort zones and with confronting reality. He consistently uses his own body as a medium, manipulating and even endangering himself for his art.
In 2007, Bilal gained initial publicity with a project called “Domestic Tension,” in which he lived in a make-shift room in a Chicago gallery with a paintball gun for 31 days. Video of him was streamed live online so viewers could control the movement of the gun and fire at will. Bilal released daily video-logs describing his emotional ride throughout the process. When the project’s publicity grew, the gun would sometimes fire non-stop. The project was a commentary on American warfare, examining the lack of physical or psychological contact that modern technology provides. This audience interaction is one of the most provocative elements of his artwork.
When Bilal puts himself in extreme situations, the audience becomes a crucial element in the artwork. When asked about how audience interaction added to his past pieces he responded, “I am in a situation, and the interaction could change that situation.” Bilal claimed that one of the hardest parts of being an artist is to step back and let things unfold.
Responding to a question about why he endured so much physical pain in his pieces, he shared that he was interested in triggering something in his viewers’ bodies. He has noticed that there is a certain point when his viewers begin to feel the same pain he feels.
Bilal’s level of physical endurance was tested in 2010 with a project titled “And Counting.” It honored deceased Iraqi troops, including his own brother who was killed by a missile in their hometown of Kufa, Iraq. He made a statement about the invisibility of Iraqi civilian deaths by first having a borderless map of Iraq tattooed on his back, followed by 5,000 red dots representing fallen American soldiers and 100,000 dots in permanent invisible ink representing the deaths of Iraqi civilians. The entire process took 20 hours to complete. The dots of invisible ink are only seen under a black light, where they emerge as an eerie layer of luminous blue all across his back. In the videos of the process, Bilal remains cool and collected — even after hours of tattooing, his hands are steady.
His most recent project, “The 3rd I,” involved surgical attachment of a camera to the back of his head. For an entire year, starting Dec. 15, 2010, this camera streamed an image every minute to the project’s website and provided his exact GPS location. Through this project, Bilal wanted to examine the places that humans leave behind as their fixation on the future becomes increasingly central to their lives.
The audience’s reaction to these controversial and abnormal pieces was surprisingly positive.
“He was the most down-to-earth performance artist that I’ve ever seen speak,” said first-year electrical and computer engineering major Canute Haroldson. The questions asked by audience members lacked criticism of the art, and instead were genuine inquiries about his opinions and processes.
When an audience member asked how his work will change when Iraq is less prominent on the American radar, he responded that it is an issue he cannot distance himself from. However, he does not want to be “the one looking for the next war, the next tragedy.” He claimed that his work will be shifting slowly in the next few years.

Audience members were met with twists and surprises with the School of Music’s production of Maurice Ravel’s short yet provocative L’enfant et les sortilèges. Opening last Thursday and running through the weekend, an intriguing fantasy land filled the Philip Chosky Theater in the Purnell Center for the Arts.
With a score by Ravel, libretto by Sidonie-Gabrielle Colette, and English translation by Katharine Wolff, L’enfant et les sortilèges, or The Child and the Magic Spells, follows the chimerical journey of a defiant young boy. After turning his room upside down in a hysterical fit, the child’s inanimate household objects come to life to teach him a lesson. Much to his horror and surprise, the child is flung into a world of fantasy not unlike those of Alice in Wonderland or Beauty and the Beast.
However, the School of Music’s interpretation differentiates itself from these romps through bold artistic choices. Directed by Greg Lehane — a professor in the schools of drama and music — and musically directed and conducted by Andres Cladera — who received his master’s degree in orchestral conducting from Carnegie Mellon — L’enfant highlights the horror that mixes with delight in the blurred line between reality and childhood imaginings. Reveling in this darker side of the fantastical world, the production team and cast crafted a piece that offered a goth, punk twist to the characters.
The performers, dressed in gothic plaid, chains, fishnets, and Rocky Horror-esque makeup, were challenged to embody a harsher tone than is usually seen in the opera that began as a “fairy ballet.” A logistically difficult opera to begin with, L’enfant was also challenging in terms of casting needs, orchestration, and avoiding similarities to Disney’s tales of happy anthropomorphic toys and dancing objects.
Drama master’s students Britton Mauk and Lindsey Vandevier developed the phantasmagoric feel of the set and costume pieces, respectively. Their work created an eerie tone for the journey through the bizarre world of a child’s fantastical imaginings. However, while the essence of this absurdity did find its way into the piece, the potential to make L’enfant truly frightening was not completely realized. Despite attention to musical intricacies and spirited performances, the cheeriness of the music created a disconnect between the desired tone and the final effect.
The production was entertaining nonetheless and featured some stand-out performances. Senior voice major Gillian Hassert’s presence as The Mother commanded attention from the moment she stepped onstage. The humor and clowning moments of The Clock (senior voice major Martin Schreiner) as well as the Teapot (senior voice major Sean Pack) and The Chinese Cup (senior voice major Katherine Brandt) also stood out.
The strong physicality and comedic instincts of senior voice major Piers Portfolio’s Black Cat stole the show. The pairing with senior voice major Kathleen Griffin’s White Cat was delightful.
In the opening sequences, some of The Child’s (played by senior voice major Lauren Boyle on Thursday night) moments of discovery seemed contrived, while others seemed refreshingly genuine as the audience was allowed to discover with him; furthermore, vocal overlaps at the beginning and end of the piece with The Princess (senior voice major Meghan Gatti) were particularly striking, showing vocal strength. Senior voice majors Gaelyn Elliott Young, Tyler Alderson, and Fiona Ryder also gave particularly memorable performances.
And these moments contributed to making the show a night of fun for Carnegie Mellon students.
“To me, this production was definitely more enjoyable than the other operas that I have seen [here],” said sophomore music composition major Sean Salamon. “Much of this was due to the quality of the writing,” he added, “[as] the libretto avoided many [frustrating] common conceits of opera.” Sophomore voice major Scott Cuva agreed, “I was both shocked and amazed with how brilliantly written and performed this opera was. It is easily my favorite Carnegie Mellon opera I’ve seen to date.”
With regard to the production’s dark interpretation, some audience members found the choices to be more successful than others did. “There are two ways to approach this opera: comically overdone or tangibly dark,” Cuva added. “I believe the decision to do the latter was an extremely poignant decision on the part of the director.”
Design choices were specifically noted as successful in the play’s darker approach. First-year dramaturgy major Meg Martinez particularly enjoyed the strong aesthetics. “It really appeared to be the child’s dream world,” she said, “[and] was tinged by his guilt for what he had done.”
Others, such as senior directing major Christian Fleming, saw the opportunity for stronger choices to be made. “I think the choice to create a darker, more frightening world for the child to wind up in makes a lot of sense,” he said.
Regardless of the final effect, the choices engaged audience members and made them think. Opera, some of the performers said, gets a bad rap, and that’s something they wish would change.
Sophomore voice major and L’enfant ensemble member James Alexander focused on the storytelling opportunities opera creates. “I wish people knew how accessible it is. Opera is, like every art form, a representation of human emotion or analysis,” he explained. “The word ‘opera’ has a reputation for implying something is old, or haughty, but the things Puccini and Mozart wrote about are still very real, and still apply to us now.”
Hassert shared the sentiment: “I wish people knew that underneath concepts, loud voices, and occasionally women in horns with spears, opera is really just about telling moving stories ... and making people think.”

Kresge Theatre was filled with an eager audience on Saturday night who came to see a production of Greeze, a musical tribute to the 1970s hit Grease. There was not, however, a single musical theater, vocal performance, or acting major on stage.
Instead, the performance was by YinzerStar, a group of graduate students in the School of Computer Science that puts on musicals, joined in this production by some friends unaffiliated with the university. The stars of the show were temporarily migrating away from their computers towards the glitz and glamour of the performing arts.
The ambience before the show screamed of the ’50s — audience members appeared to be smoking cigarettes but upon closer inspection were actually nibbling on Victory candy cigarettes, a clever freebie given out by the ushers at the door as people filed in. Musical hits like “Lollipop” and “Yakety Yak” played as audience members read the playbill and waited for the show to start.
The house ran out of playbills — which included funny character fact cards to prepare the audience for the world of the play — well before the start of the show, suggesting that many more people attended the performance than expected. When asked how they found out about the performance, most audience members said they were students in the School of Computer Science or friends of the performers. The show seemed to be a well-kept secret, meant to circulate primarily within the computer science community.
Some, however, were skeptical that computer science Ph.D. students could put on a successful musical, something that seemed so contrastive to their usual day’s work. “When [my friend] told me there was an SCS musical, I was reasonably confident he was pulling my leg,” said David Franklin, a first-year computer science major.
The performers certainly surprised the audience, though.
Nick Benore, who co-directed the musical and played Danny Zuko, bore an uncanny resemblance to the 1978 film version’s John Travolta and had the singing and acting skills to boot. Co-star Emily Stiehl as Sandy had a sweet voice and disposition, charming audience members during intermission when she taught them the hand jive so they could join in the classic “Born to Hand Jive” scene. The actors’ cartwheeling, singing, and dancing were definitely sights to be seen.
This was YinzerStar’s second show, produced by Thomas LaToza, a software engineering Ph.D. student, who put on Jesus Christ Yinzerstar with a group of computer science Ph.D. students last year. Greeze incorporated clever references to last year’s well-received show, such as inviting back Gus Xia — a Ph.D. student in machine learning who played Zealotes last year — to be the Teen Angel Advisor and sing a warning against becoming a graduate-school dropout.
“We had a lot of fun with [_Jesus Christ Yinzerstar_], so we wanted to do another show,” LaToza said. He added that this year, with the lack of an extensive pit orchestra, he wanted to choose a show that revolved around a smaller band.
Benore said that Greeze was enjoyable to put on because of the students involved. “We worked with such an enthusiastic group of people,” Benore raved. The challenge was balancing schoolwork with rehearsals, although Benore pointed out that the cast members did a great job doing so — a surprising feat, considering the amount of research and work that Ph.D. students undertake here.
The close-knit community was evident as the performers made many references to Carnegie Mellon’s graduate school, sometimes directly addressing the audience in jest. Overall, the success of the show and the audience’s enjoyment was no doubt due to the enthusiasm of those involved in this performance.

The Pittsburgh Symphony Orchestra (PSO) had its opening performance of “Marvin and the Movies,” which paid tribute to some of the most famous Hollywood movie scores of all time, last Thursday at Heinz Hall. The orchestra — conducted by four-time Grammy winner Marvin Hamlisch — was accompanied by the All-Star College Choir for four songs at the beginning of the show and by seven-time Grammy nominee saxophonist Dave Koz at the end of the show.
After the lights dimmed, Hamlisch stepped onto the stage to join the orchestra and greeted the audience with the casual air of an old friend. “You know, this is the perfect time for this show,” he said, “because the Academy Awards are coming up.”
Then, after making a joke about how almost no one in the audience had seen the nine nominated movies, he commented, “Movies have the power to touch our lives,” and led the orchestra in a short medley that combined “The Murder” from Psycho with “Tara’s Theme” from Gone With the Wind.
The second song of the evening was “A Salute to Gene Kelly,” featuring musical pieces from the best-loved scores of Kelly’s movies. The light-hearted medley, which included “Singing in the Rain,” was coupled with playful theatrics for an enjoyable performance.
The most highly anticipated portion of the night came after intermission when Koz joined the orchestra. His on-stage personality was as suave and vibrant as the smooth jazz he unleashed from his instrument.
Koz was quick to charm the audience, playing a brassy rendition of one of Hollywood’s greatest love songs, “Moon River,” which he credited as being perhaps his favorite melody of all time. The saxophonist even granted the audience the pleasure of hearing him sing a line of the famous song.
After performances of “The Pink Panther” and “Over the Rainbow,” the orchestra began to play a piecemeal composition of the music from the James Bond film series. The musicians had barely played three notes, however, when Hamlisch interrupted the performance. “Wait, this doesn’t feel right,” Hamlisch explained, picking up a white jacket from atop the grand piano. The audience responded with cheers as Hamlisch helped Koz to slip into the iconic piece of Bond-esque attire.
“The name’s Koz. Dave Koz,” the saxophonist joked.
After interrupting the music just once more to hand Koz a drink — “shaken, not stirred” — Hamlisch let the medley recommence with a flick of his baton.
Straying from the night’s theme of movie scores, Koz treated the audience to performances of two of his original pieces, “Cuban Highway” and “You Make Me Smile.” The visual experience of watching Koz play his music was as stimulating as the acoustics: his shoulders rising with the notes of a peaking melody, his patent leather shoes never planted solidly on the floor, back arching, legs bowing. The music invaded his limbs. Koz received a standing ovation after dropping to one knee to play a complex segment of “You Make Me Smile.”
Another highlight of the evening was seeing some of Carnegie Mellon’s own students perform as part of the All-Star College Choir. After some songs, Hamlisch stopped to have onstage chats with randomly chosen members of the choir. For example, after the choir’s performance of “The Trolley Song” from Meet Me in St. Louis, Hamlisch teased sophomore Hannah Marks when she shared that she is a vocal performance major. “A person who doesn’t need any money. Right here, ladies and gentlemen,” Hamlisch joked.
Sophomore voice major Kati Richer was also called out by Hamlisch. When asked whether she found the music of Hollywood classics old-fashioned, Richer responded, “I love this music. It’s timeless.”

Last Saturday, a funk trio played in Pittsburgh.
For some reason, in the late ’80s, we cast off the funky sounds that the synthesizers of the era were beckoning to produce. Much like a lost balloon, it seems that the funk never left Earth’s orbit, but has instead been hanging out beyond the exosphere, drenching itself in alpha rays. Repeated exposure to these rays has resulted in the funk spiraling downward into the troposphere and, as a result, we’ve recently been hearing the heaviest of futuristic funks radiating from cities like Los Angeles and Pittsburgh.
Last night, members of WRCT’s experimental physics department made an excursion to lower Lawrenceville, where there seemed to be a radioactive disturbance. As they approached the Thunderbird Cafe, the readings on their Geiger counter were off the charts. It turns out the spikes in radioactivity were the result of an ELQ performance.
ELQ, formally known as East Liberty Quarters, a local future-funk group, has been creating quite a stir with its performances in Pittsburgh. The group has been revealing an intricate synthesizer-based funk that it has been composing in the studio, and it is impressing a good number of well-to-do Pittsburghers. The trio is comprised of Grand Ear, Nice Rec, and Buscrates 16 Bit Ensemble. On Friday, during their performance at the Thunderbird Cafe, they were accompanied on guitar by Zachary Curl of the Smooth Tutors.
The show was a blast. The funk radiated in a fashion kindred to that of Dâm-Funk, the self-proclaimed Los Angeles-based “Ambassador of Boogie Funk.” ELQ played  a hypnotic array of songs that got a packed two-and-a-half-story bar grooving. Given last night’s performance, one can only expect that the power and exploration in their repertoire will be growing.

Dear Patrick,
I’m graduating in a few months and already have a job offer. Basically, I’m just killing time until graduation. But now I have nothing to do. What can I do to make the best of my last few months in Pittsburgh?
Thanks,
Seeking Local Activities, Cannot Keep Entertained Recently
Dear SLACKER,
Now is your chance to finally enjoy Pittsburgh. Everyone at Carnegie Mellon loves to hate on the ’Burgh, lamenting about how terrible it is. They’re all liars and I hate them. Pittsburgh is awesome, and they’re just too miserable to enjoy it. 
Get your crew together and start skipping class — it’s time to take advantage of the ’Burgh. You’ve probably done typical tourist-y things, like going up the Monongahela Incline and spending way too much time in Squirrel Hill and Shadyside. Now’s the time to go to South Side. There are bars as far as the eye can see, and it’s not the usual college crowd. You’ll have an unforgettable evening — or a very forgettable one, depending on how many bars.
Or just stay inside and complain,
Patrick Hoskins
Dear Patrick,
I love to dance, but when I do, I’m super awkward. All my friends tell me not to, and I always get weird looks when I go out on the dance floor. How can I be a better dancer?
Thanks,
Twisting While Others Leave, Everyone Feeling Troubled, Friends Embarrassed, Enjoyment Terminated
Dear TWO LEFT FEET,
I am a firm believer that no one actually knows what they’re doing when they dance. Alcohol is the only thing that separates most parties from those middle school dances with guys on one side of the room and girls on the other. After enough to drink, everyone’s on the dance floor making a fool of themselves, so just go out there and have fun. 
The fact of the matter is, your friends are projecting their insecurities onto you. Frankly, you can dance if you want to. You can leave your friends behind. ‘Cause your friends don’t dance and if they don’t dance, well, they’re no friends of mine.
S-s-s-s A-a-a-a F-f-f-f E-e-e-e T-t-t-t Y-y-y-y,
Patrick Hoskins

Submarine
8 10 12
This coming-of-age British “dramedy” was released in 2010 and marked the directorial debut of Richard Ayoade, a popular British comedian. Submarine follows Oliver, a teenage boy who is socially awkward but thinks he’s secretly a genius. Oliver lives a relatively normal life growing up but is soon surrounded by intensely emotional events that threaten to shatter his life goals. Submarine is a clever tale of the vulnerability that affects all of us as we grow up in the cruel adult world. Fun Fact: Alex Turner, frontman of The Arctic Monkeys, wrote the original songs for the movie.
In Time
7:30 10 12:30
Imagine a future in which people stop aging at 25. That’s the plot of this movie — with a slight twist — which stars Justin Timberlake, Amanda Seyfried, and Cillian Murphy. The twist is that people are only engineered to live one more year after 25, and they must earn more time through their private lives. So, the wealthier a person is, the longer they live. In Time seems to be a more modern and dystopian version of Logan’s Run. Fun Fact: Despite the fact that everyone is genetically engineered to stop aging at 25 in the movie, Seyfried was the only significant character who was actually 25 during filming.
Contagion
8 10 12
Directed by Steven Soderbergh, Contagion is the film version of the popular online Flash game Pandemic. A disease of unknown origin starts spreading rapidly throughout the world’s population, with a select few immune to the deadly virus. The film follows several intersecting plot lines, primarily a team of researchers who must identify where the virus originated and create a vaccine to stop it. Scientists have praised the movie for including scientifically accurate scenes of how a virus of the magnitude shown would be dealt with. Big stars in this movie include Kate Winslet, Jude Law, Matt Damon, Bryan Cranston, and even Demetri Martin.

“If you shut up and listen, maybe you’ll learn something,” The Onion's head writer Carol Kolb said, beginning her talk in McConomy Auditorium last Monday.
Sarcasm was to be expected from Kolb, the previous editor-in-chief of The Onion, a satirical newspaper. The Onion was established at the University of Wisconsin-Madison in 1988 by Tim Keck and Chris Johnson. 
Since then, it has become a national publication with an online edition and a television program. Kolb became involved with the paper after establishing herself through other comedy projects during her time at UW-Madison.
Inspiration for The Onion comes from serious sources. “I just read the news,” Kolb said. “Either making fun of what’s in it or actually just making fun of the business of news and how flashy everything is and how dumbed down some stories are.” The amount of real research that goes into each article or video for The Onion varies with the writer’s familiarity with the subject. If, for example, a writer knows little about how a bill is passed, some research will be done on the bill before he or she writes the article. 
The only news programs that are not targets of The Onion’s satirical comments are ones that are already satirical in nature. “You want to make sure you’re coming up with your own ideas,” Kolb said. The satire of The Onion does have a history, however, of not being recognized as such. News sources from China’s Beijing Evening News to Fox News have reissued The Onion’s stories as true.
Despite the success of The Onion, the worry of falling flat still crosses Kolb’s mind. “Even more than we want things to have a point, we just want to make people laugh, so that always is a fear of just sort of making something too heavy-handed or not funny enough,” Kolb explained. “That’s always the hardest thing, having a point and making it be satirical but also having it be fun and silly.”
There is one worry that Kolb does not have, however. “There certainly are people out there who don’t find it funny or find us offensive, and we just kind of don’t care. Don’t read us, then.” With the anything-goes style of The Onion, nothing is off limits. However, Kolb noted that the publication does think about who it’s making fun of before they make a joke. “[The] 9/11 issue was a good example. We didn’t want to offend anyone,” she said.
The one topic that people get sensitive about, Kolb said, is animals. In response to an article titled “Puppy Bowl Marred by Tragic Spinal Injury,” The Onion received an intensely negative response. “ ‘You went too far when you covered this,’ ” Kolb said, in the words of the critics. “Not when you made fun of cancer, or you made fun of the troops...” In 2007, The Onion introduced the Onion News Network (ONN), a mock news program. “We definitely did have to re-learn what we were doing,” Kolb said. “We couldn’t just do what we did in the paper. We looked into modern 24-hour cable news.”
One major difference is the lack of the “stodgy voice” the newspaper has. Instead of looking to precision in journalistic formality, the program is designed to be flashy and eye-catching.
“It kind of has to be,” Kolb said. “Especially when we were doing video, we found it just had to be a little more engaging. It’s enjoyable to read something, but I think watching video, you need it to keep grabbing your attention — otherwise you’re going to turn it off.”
The ONN continues to grab viewers’ attention. The show has been renewed for a second season on IFC, thanks to “nine billion viewers across 811 countries,” according to Kolb. 
Many members of Carnegie Mellon’s satirical newspaper readme were in the audience. Emily Forney, a senior linguistics and Russian studies major and editor-in-chief of readme, said that she related to one of Kolb’s comments that  anything can spur satire, including a simple comment from the writer’s mother. Joe Selinger, a junior chemical engineering major and writer for readme, noted a difference between the articles he writes and those of The Onion. “Our articles do a lot of more college-related humor,” Selinger said.
Kolb shared advice for aspiring satirists in the audience. “Try to think of something new. A new format or a new voice or something,” she said. “When I started writing, as compared to a few years of writing, the difference was huge,” Kolb said. “You just have to write a lot and get people to read it who will be critical of what you’re doing and actually say, ‘That’s not funny,’ or ‘That’s not good,’ and then just keep doing it.”

On Feb. 19, Kiva Han Cafe will close its doors for the last time. 
Standing at the southern corner of Forbes Avenue and Craig Street, the cafe has been a local landmark for Carnegie Mellon students and locals alike for 10 years. Despite high popularity, a loyal clientele, and an excellent location, John Mutchka, the owner of Kiva Han Cafe, has been forced to shut down his business. Mutchka said that several factors contributed to his decision, including competition from the Starbucks directly across the street. 
“There are a lot of reasons,” Mutchka said. “We’ve been here 10 years. And it’s really difficult for us to afford the rent. And somebody offered more for the space, and was willing to build out the space.” The Bagel Factory will be moving into Kiva Han’s current location and will be expanding upon the current property. The owners of the Bagel Factory — Charles Avalli and June and David Feldstein — said they plan to entirely renovate the space, putting in new windows, all-new signage and paint, a larger kitchen, and increased seating. They hope to provide a more diner-like menu and atmosphere. With an emphasis on a more expansive menu, they believe the Starbucks across the street will not be too dangerous to their business.
“That corner will be completely redone,” Feldstein said. “We are putting in new windows and everything.” Feldstein noted that a new decor will also be used, creating a new environment. “We’ve taken some flack for [moving into the location],” Feldstein said, “but we’re not a corporate giant. We’re a family business. I’m glad they kept it a Pittsburgh franchise.”
An applied anthropologist by trade, Mutchka conceived  Kiva Han Cafe as an experiment of sorts. While originally planned as an employee-owned and operated enterprise, when sales began to flag only two years after the opening, Mutchka felt that he could not, in good conscience, give the shop to his employees. 
Mutchka claims that some longtime patrons were on the verge of tears upon receiving the news of the shop’s closing. “We all have the same mindset,” Mutchka said of the unique community that the coffee shop has attracted, “and that’s why Kiva Han was such a great place for us.”
“My world is literally falling apart because Kiva Han is closing,” said Rokhini Prabhu, a first-year electrical and computer engineering major. She said she preferred the “hipster” vibe of the cafe over the neighboring Starbucks. “There’s something nice about being able to just sit there and enjoy good coffee in peace, which is not something I can do in Starbucks; [Kiva Han is] much quieter,” she added. “Although, in retrospect, that might explain the problem.”

Physics postdoc Patrick Coles has started a petition to ban smoking on the Carnegie Mellon campus. 
As of last Thursday, the petition had received a total of 534 signatures on ipetitions.com. Coles said that he was “quite pleased by the support” his petition has received. “We are at the point where we should start talking to the administration,” he said. “The main issue is to protect people’s right to breathe clean air and to promote a healthy campus,” Coles said.
Coles recalled that he was inspired to start the petition after running on the campus track one evening, spending the time breathing in second-hand smoke from one of the designated smoking areas. The petition’s description cites a survey conducted in the spring of 2009, in which 89 percent of Carnegie Mellon undergraduate students claimed not to smoke. 
Kelley Shell, health promotion specialist for Student Health Services, said that the survey had 480 respondents, almost all of whom were undergraduates. Shell said that smokers face “a whole array of cancers” and are “more susceptible to respiratory infections, bronchitis ... and, later in life, heart disease and stroke.” The Centers for Disease Control’s website corroborates Shell’s list of side effects. According to Shell, the dangers of second-hand smoke vary depending on the individual and his or her levels of exposure, with children being the most susceptible. 
She added that “second-hand smoke is classified as a class-A carcinogen,” meaning that it contains cancer-causing agents. Second-hand smoke’s status as a carcinogen has been the subject of some controversy. The classification was struck down in 1998 by a U.S. District Court in North Carolina, which claimed that the Environmental Protection Agency had not followed required procedures when conducting the study. However, this ruling was rejected by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit in 2002.
The last proposal for banning smoking on campus was introduced in 2006, with Staff Council voting in favor of the idea, but with Student Senate and the Graduate Student Assembly rejecting the proposal.
Since posting the petition, Coles said that he has been impressed by some of the comments it has received online — comments that provide additional reasons to support a smoking ban, according to Coles. First-year German and international relations major Jamison Howell said that he is in support of the proposed smoking ban, especially since he is allergic to cigarette smoke. “It’s a shame I wasn’t at Carnegie Mellon in 2006,” Howell said in response to the previous attempt at a ban.
Howell complained that the current smoking policy is not being enforced and claimed that the current designated smoke areas are poorly placed, specifically citing one in close proximity to the Children’s School playground and others in popular campus areas. Coles said, “Even if this doesn’t go through, the administration should be aware of the non-ideal placement of existing smoking areas.”
However, some people, such as first-year information systems major Michael Probber, are opposed to the notion of a campus-wide smoking ban. “I believe everybody has the right to their own decisions,” Prober said. “Students didn’t sign up for a smoke-free campus.” Instead, Probber suggested that the petition be for the restructuring of designated smoking areas along with stricter enforcement, as he felt a ban would “infringe on the rights of others.”
“In theory, [restructuring designated smoking areas] would be effective at reducing people’s exposure [to second-hand smoke] on campus,” Shell said. But she said that this has been hard in practice. Shell claimed that a campus-wide smoking ban would be easier to police than 30 designated areas across campus, which she feels are not well marked. Coles said that his smoking ban proposal is different from the 2006 attempt because of the changing culture at large. “What’s a bit different is that there’s a national movement, with 648 colleges, as of Jan. 2, now enacting this policy,” Coles said. “I think people’s minds are changing.” 
A list of the 648 institutions that have passed campus-wide smoking bans has been made available online by the American Nonsmokers’ Right Foundation. Since the last attempt at a campus-wide smoking ban, the administration has taken some steps to improve the campus’ environmental health. According to the Carnegie Mellon Environmental Health and Safety website, these steps include a $25 fine for the improper disposal of cigarette butts. In the past, the “20-foot rule,” which disallows smoking within 20 feet of any Carnegie Mellon building, was also implemented.

Students receiving packages to their SMC addresses last week may have noticed that their pickup notification came from an unfamiliar email address. Instead of the ladner@ address that students have come to expect, sabrown@ appeared in the “from” line.
The response that met the change was overwhelming. A “We Miss You, Ladner” Facebook group was set up, which gained over 250 likes in just a few days. Speculation regarding fraudulent emails and stories of epic mailroom mishaps almost immediately began circulating online. One of the stories, quoted on the “Overheard at Carnegie Mellon” Facebook group, questioned whether Ladner had ended up in “an epic fistfight with one of the mailroom robots who tried setting packages on fire.”
Mark Ladner, the man behind the email address students have become acquainted with, said it was not such an interesting story. Instead, Ladner has simply moved locations from the University Center’s mailroom to the loading dock at the Mellon Institute. “I’m looking forward to working at the Mellon Institute,” Ladner said. “I’m not going to miss the hard work [at the mailroom], but I will miss the students.... It’s rare that a person can have a job that makes a large number of people happy on a daily basis. I personally know what it’s like to order something and how happy it makes me when I know it’s delivered.” 
Those deliveries, which number over 140,000 per year, have left Ladner with innumerable stories from the four-and-a-half years he has worked as the University Center mailroom student coordinator. “I have so many funny stories about package pickup ... from deliveries of live crickets to my first experience with kimchi,” he said. Kimchi is a traditional fermented Korean dish that Ladner said gets delivered about every few weeks. Ladner said that he can identify the smell, even from among 500 other packages.
The strangest package Ladner ever received, however, was a 600-pound car transmission. “It arrived in a big wooden crate and was incredibly heavy. We sent the usual email to the student, and when he arrived, he looked at me and asked, ‘How do I get it back to my dorm?’... I would have loved to know what he did with it,” Ladner said. 
In addition to stories, if the online response is any indication, Ladner has accumulated a group of students he has come to call friends. “Ladner is hands-down one of the most kindhearted and friendly people that I’ve had the chance to get to know here,” said fifth-year senior psychology and social and decision sciences double major Nicole Ickles. “His silly and bright attitude is contagious. Even on the dreariest days, he never failed to make me smile.”
“I’ve made so many friends along the way,” Ladner said. “I get emails every so often from former students that just want to keep in touch.” However, even Ladner was surprised by the student response to his departure from the mailroom. “I feel really blessed to have had a job where I could affect so many people,” Ladner said. “I tried to put myself in the students’ place and realize that for each package, there was someone waiting for it.”

CMU engineering professor appointed fellow of AIAA
Nadine Aubry, head of Carnegie Mellon’s mechanical engineering department, has been recognized as a fellow of the American Institute for Aeronautics and Astronautics (AIAA) for her work in aeronautical fluid dynamics.
“I am deeply honored by this election,” Aubry said in a university press release.  “At a time when aviation has become an inherent part of our life and our economy, it is crucial to continue making technological advances [that] address reduced fuel consumption or sustainable fuel alternatives.”
Aubry will be one of 28 AIAA members, selected from a membership of over 36,000, who will be inducted in May as AIAA fellows at the AIAA Aerospace Spotlight Awards Gala in Washington D.C.
This most recent distinction is one of Aubry’s many scientific achievements. In addition to AIAA, Aubry is a fellow of the American Association for the Advancement of Science, the American Physical Society, and the American Society of Mechanical Engineers. 
She is also a member of the National Academy of Engineering, as well as vice- chair of the American Physical Society Division of Fluid Dynamics. “Nadine is undoubtedly a leader in her field and a wonderful role model,” said Pradeep K. Khosla, the dean of the Carnegie Institute of Technology, in the press release. “This latest honor is an indication of how widely recognized she is.”
CAS researchers start new exploratory media initiative
Carnegie Mellon’s Center for the Arts in Society (CAS), a research center within the Dietrich College of Humanities and Social Sciences and the College of Fine Arts, is launching a new initiative to explore how new media influences peoples social and political lives.
“The media initiative is an attempt to draw together Carnegie Mellon faculty who focus on media — whether they are ‘old’ or ‘new’ — and support projects that use the rubric of media as a vehicle to foster new, productive collaborations between artists and humanistic scholars,” said history professor Paul Eiss, the director of CAS, in a university press release.
The initiative will primarily support three projects. The first, Listening Spaces, seeks to understand the effects of technology on personal interactions with music. The second, entitled “Gender/Sexuality/Media,” will explore gender expressions and representations in new media. The third project is currently open for proposals.
Another major aim of the initiative is to encourage students to participate in the growing and enriching dialogue on media-related issues. Professor of art James Duesing and professor of English Kathy Newman are heading up the project. “Media allows for the humanities and arts to come together around a shared theme,” Newman said in the press release. “Media and social change connects immediately in some way to the kind of work that many of us do at Carnegie Mellon.”

Music in the Brain: Pitch, Plasticity, Imagery, and Emotion
Monday at 4:30 p.m.
Steinberg Auditorium 
(Baker Hall A53)
Robert Zatorre, the James McGill Professor of Neuroscience at McGill University, will be giving a talk on the brain’s response to music, explaining the mysteries of how the brain perceives music and why music sometimes elicits an emotional response. The lecture will focus on identifying the portions of the brain that deal with music processing and musical imagery. Zatorre will touch on studies that claim the strong positive emotion elicited by certain types of music seems to be mediated by the mesolimbic dopaminergic system, a neural pathway believed to be associated with feelings of reward and motivation.
Entries from a Built Encyclopedia
Monday at 6 p.m.
Carnegie Museum of Art Theater
Charles Rosenblum, an assistant professor at Carnegie Mellon’s Schools of Art and Architecture, will give a lecture on Henry Hornbostel’s School of Applied Design, now known as the College of Fine Arts. 
The building played an integral role in the promotion of the arts on Carnegie Mellon’s campus. Unlike the buildings he designed for Carnegie Tech, and unlike Hornbostel’s other major works, the College of Fine Arts building was never published in a major architectural journal. Through an in-depth analysis of its design and construction, Rosenblum will affirm the architectural significance of the building.
Rosenblum has written numerous essays on Hornbostel’s works, and is currently working with filmmakers on a documentary about Hornbostel’s architecture.
Hydrodynamics and Elastodynamics of Flagellated Bacteria
Tuesday at 1:30 p.m.
Wean Hall 7218
Henry Shum, a professor at the University of Oxford, will present a new model of bacterial locomotion that considers elastic behavior in the hook that links the flagellar filament of bacteria to the motor in the cell body. The model, based on Gustav Kirchhoff’s rod theory, predicts upper and lower movement on the hook’s stiffness for effective swimming, and hints at the possibility for more complex behaviors, like cell reorientation.
Google’s Speech Internationalization Project: From 1 to 300 Languages and Beyond
Friday at 2:30 p.m.
Giant Eagle Auditorium (Baker Hall A51)
Pedro J. Moreno, a research scientist at Google, will present a lecture about Google’s speech recognition team. The team has developed speech recognition systems for more than 30 languages in a little over two years. Moreno will dive into the acoustic modeling, lexicon, language modeling, infrastructure techniques, and social engineering techniques used in the project. Google’s speech recognition team has the ultimate aim of building speech recognition systems for the world’s top 300 languages.

“Don’t be evil.”
It was an optimistic creed, while it lasted. Google: the young, upstart, idealistic challenger to the monopolistic behemoth that was Microsoft. With its simple interface and honest business practices, Google could do no wrong. Its offices were the envy of the tech world, its young founders symbols that success was possible after the dot-com bubble collapsed. 
Those happy days are now over.
On March 1, Google will aggregate all the information it has on each user into a single user profiles. Until now, this information was often split up among many different services. Google Latitude location data was separate from YouTube favorite videos data, which in turn was separate from Gmail messages and contacts. Beginning in March, all this data will be linked much more intricately than it is now.
Google claims that these changes to its privacy policy and terms of service are made with only users’ interests at heart. Search results will be more accurate and advertisements more relevant. For most users, what Google says will be true. Their experiences will be better, and they will see no ill effects.
Yet concentrating the enormous amount of data that Google has on people presents a profound privacy problem. We do not claim that the company will suddenly violate its policy and sell this data to the highest bidder. Google’s past privacy debacles have been due to shortsightedness, not malice. Google Buzz publicized Gmail users’ contact lists without warning — with the new policy changes, that mistake would likely have revealed users’ location histories, photos, and videos. 
Over the last few years, Google has demonstrated that it cannot be depended on to protect users’ privacy. Regardless of the good intentions of Google's engineers, history shows that their efforts often leave user information susceptible to security breaches. Upcoming privacy changes are a dangerous to information integrity and should leave users wary of how secure their information is with Google.

As the Republican primaries intensify, Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney has been under fire from liberals and conservatives alike for his 15 percent effective tax rate and his time at the financial services company Bain Capital.
Instead of skirting around these issues, Romney needs to start using both his time at Bain Capital and his tax rate to highlight the characteristics that set him apart from fellow Republican candidate Newt Gingrich and President Barack Obama.
Romney is often criticized for his past tendency at Bain Capital to invest in firms and restructure them, often at the cost of jobs.
What people fail to realize is that the companies the financial services firm invested in needed to be restructured: They were operating at losses or had limited growth prospects.
As a result, Bain Capital took over management and reorganized companies like Dunkin’ Donuts and Burger King to become profitable again. Because these companies were already hurting, many of them would have gone out of business, resulting in all of those companies’ jobs being lost.
Bain Capital’s intervention had served to save some jobs that would have been otherwise lost without radical shifts in the company’s way of doing things.
In other instances, Bain Capital’s actions gave struggling companies a business plan to become an international chain, such as with Staples and Domino’s Pizza. Bain Capital created 110,000 jobs, and saved many more, during Romney’s time with the company. His time at Bain Capital serves to show that he not only knows how to streamline the government to make it more efficient, but that he also has experience creating and saving jobs in the private sector.
Romney’s critics also view his tax rate of 15 percent as a detriment to his candidacy. Though Romney earned $27 million last year, most of his money came from investment income, which is taxed at a rate of 15 percent instead of the top income tax rate of 35 percent.
Obama and Warren Buffet, CEO of Berkshire Hathaway, have both criticized this tax rate, citing that it allows the top one percent to be taxed far less than most upper-middle class families.
The reason this tax is lower, however, is because it is a double tax. All investment income is already taxed at the corporate rate of 35 percent, and then again at a rate of 15 percent. This is a tax of 45.25 percent, a higher rate than nearly any other tax.
Moreover, the initial rate is lower because investment income is much riskier. There is a 100 percent guarantee of wage income, provided that you work. There is a very real possibility that investors will lose large sums of money when they make risky investments.
This lower rate is put in place to encourage investment and keep the economy growing.
If Romney embraces these two aspects of his life instead of shying away from them, he can provide a compelling case for pro-growth tax reform and limited government regulation. Under this system, more Americans can achieve the benefits of both personal investment and investment by capital funds.
Emphasizing this would make Romney more attractive to Republicans, who want a nominee that can argue the merits of hard work and free markets, and to the general electorate, who want the economy to get moving again.

Shortly before 9 p.m. on Saturday, Jan. 21, Onward State — Pennsylvania State University’s online student publication — reported former football coach Joe Paterno’s lung cancer-induced death. The report flew through Facebook and Twitter, and soon CNN and other news sources began to report (and tweet) the news. Journalists such as Anderson Cooper, Howard Kurtz, and Huffington Post columnists began to tweet Paterno’s death. Many Americans scurried to offer their condolences; loved ones that knew him and fans that admired him united to wish him well.
However, Paterno died on Sunday morning. Although family members demanded that reports of his death be deleted the night prior, the use of social media ensured that the statements had been set in stone. Many news sources were quick to issue both their apologies for misinformation and condolences to family members, but the initial flow of online postings was enough to sustain the news.
Social media has everyone in a frenzy, and rightfully so. The rapidity of Twitter and other platforms has truly changed the way we communicate, shifting news to a more grassroots process, rather than a “Big Media” product. Tweets, paragraph-long blog posts, or minute-to-minute podcasts are slowly replacing traditional news articles as ultimate disseminators. When this craze blurs into a haze, however, is when the true problem arises.
When Representative Gabrielle Giffords (D–Ariz.) was shot earlier last year, NPR and other news sources were quick to report her death. Social media grasped onto the statements, and created a frenzy of “RIP Gabby Giffords” posts, solidifying her death within the news world. Giffords, however, had not died, and is fortunately still alive today.
Traditional news sources are always dominant because they are trusted. Editing processes are complex and constant, thus reassuring the reader that he or she has factual information. Blogs and social media platforms do not usually have an elaborate editing process. A lack of this process inhibits social media’s credibility as a news source.
Many criticize social media platforms for a lack of journalistic integrity. Bloggers and Twitter users usually respond with the idea of “crowdsourcing,” the mechanism in which social media users will quickly respond to misinformed tweets and posts, thus ensuring objectivity and factuality. 
Although I understand this concept in theory, I feel that it fails in practice. The rapidity of social media often prevents any source checking.
Social media mistakes should not continue to happen. Although the quick nature of these media is admirable, accuracy must be maintained. Because of social media, false information can spread and create public opinions based on inaccuracy.
Efforts are constantly made to create a balance between new media and traditional journalism. Measures to build and maintain public trust in each field are crucial to media’s continued successes. Journalists and bloggers often deal with delicate news topics, and the first step to improving media is to ensure accurate information.
Media sources, whether grassroots or mainstream, must check their facts and ensure integrity before publishing. Readers must also understand that, in the context of more delicate issues, social media cannot be their sole source of news. 
Twitter users and bloggers should double-check their sources, just as traditional journalists do, in order to create a more reliable system. Accuracy should never be sacrificed for immediacy in reporting. 
Until this happens, the social media revolution will never truly occur and the balance will always be traditionally bent.

In the Pennsylvania General Assembly, the House Bill 1077 — also referred to as the Women’s Right to Know Act — has been making headway since its introduction last October and has 112 co-sponsors. Although the bill claims to be for women’s rights, the actual details of the bill imply the opposite.
Bill 1077 would require a woman to view and sign for copies of her fetal ultrasound photos before she could get an abortion. 
If the woman had the ultrasound more than two weeks before her abortion, the doctor would be required to offer her an ultrasound video of the fetus and inform her of the fetus’ heartbeat and age prior to the abortion.
Proponents of the bill claim that it would enhance women’s rights by making sure they were giving “truly informed consent” before having an abortion. Maria Vitale Gallagher, the legislative director of the Pennsylvania Pro-Life Federation, told lifenews.com, “This legislation represents a victory for patients’ rights. Women have a right to all relevant information about their pregnancies. With this additional knowledge, women can be empowered to make informed choices for themselves and their families.”
This bill isn’t empowering women; it’s trying to bully them into not getting an abortion. Gallagher claims that “women have been pressured into making a decision on abortion without having all the facts,” but statistics on the women who receive abortions reveal just the opposite. 
A 2005 study published in the journal Perspectives on Reproductive and Sexual Health showed that only 14 percent of women who got an abortion said they had the procedure because their partner wanted them to, and even those women often had additional reasons as to why they wanted the abortion.
Furthermore, 60 percent of women who receive abortions are already mothers, meaning that they have already gone through pregnancy and are well aware of the facts of child-bearing. To claim that these women do not have all the facts is horrifically condescending.
Pennsylvania has already tried to make it extremely difficult for women to receive an abortion. If a woman wants an abortion, she must already receive state-directed counseling that includes information designed to discourage her from having one, and then wait 24 hours before the procedure is provided. 
House Bill 574, which passed last year, placed additional requirements on abortion facilities with the claim that it would make abortions safer for women. However, its requirements — including dedicated parking spaces, medical-grade elevators, and extended hallways — seem less about women’s safety and more about placing financial burdens on abortion facilities.
If the state’s goal has been to make it more difficult to maintain an abortion facility, it has been working: The number of abortion providers declined by 11 percent between 2005 and 2008, and 82 percent of Pennsylvania counties do not have abortion providers. House Bill 1077 (whose numerous co-sponsors, it’s worth noting, are overwhelmingly male) merely hopes to further interfere with a woman’s ability to receive an abortion. It places an additional hurdle for women to cross — and an additional financial burden, since the required ultrasound must be billed separately from the actual abortion.
This bill is expected to come up for vote soon in the Pennsylvania General Assembly. Contact Penn. House Representative Dan Frankel and Penn. Senator Jay Costa, both of whom represent our area of Pittsburgh, and let them know that House Bill 1077 isn’t advancing women’s rights — it’s infringing upon them.

When East Haven, Conn. Mayor Joe Maturo blurted out, “I might have tacos when I go home. I’m not sure yet,” during an interview last Wednesday, he most likely didn’t envision the backlash that would ensue.
The off-color comment was said in response to a reporter asking, “What are you doing for the Latino community today?” In the days that followed, the overwhelmingly negative response to Maturo’s comment has grown to epic proportions. CBS, FOX, NBC, Time, and The New York Times have all covered the “taco incident” in one form or another.
At first glance, this news coverage is a bit excessive for an attempt — albeit a bad attempt — at a joke. However, a second glance and a look into the recent history of East Haven reveals something far worse.
Until recently, East Haven was a predominantly white community. According to MSNBC, 10 percent of the city’s population is now Latino, but only one of 50 officers on its police force speaks Spanish. Police harassment toward Latinos has been investigated since 2009, finally reaching a breaking point this past Tuesday when the FBI arrested four East Haven policemen for excessive force, false arrest, and conspiracy against primarily Latino citizens.
It was in this tense atmosphere that Maturo said, “I might have tacos.”
This statement reveals a disturbing disconnect. How can a man whose job consists of being aware of and fixing the problems in his community be so flippant? It’s hard to govern when one is oblivious. We think that there really isn’t much of an excuse for Mayor Maturo.
The public seems to agree. Shortly after Maturo’s comment, activists coordinated to deliver 2,000 tacos to his office. 
What he needs to do now is either acknowledge his ineptness and resign, or put every effort into addressing the concerns of the Latino community. Whether Maturo resigns or stays, whoever is mayor in East Haven must acquaint his or herself with the issues of the community before positive changes can be made.

Did you watch President Obama’s State of the Union address last week? We didn’t. It turns out that he talked about financial aid and foreign students. He even talked about tech jobs and became the first president to mention “start-ups” in a State of the Union.
Here’s a quick rundown: Among emphasis on high-tech manufacturing, a stable economy with fair taxes, energy self-sufficiency, and increased national security, Obama first encouraged America to become “a country that leads the world in educating its people.”
Part of that is improving K-12 education, Obama said. He outlined paying teachers more and paying them for performance, but at the same time lessening the onerous burden of standardization, which encourages schools to teach to the test. 
Obama also laid out several suggestions just for college students. “Congress needs to stop the interest rates on student loans from doubling in July.” Did you even know that was going to happen? The problem is that we didn’t help the situation at all. As college students who understand these difficulties firsthand, we should be taking an active political role in shaping the future for students just like us.
State schools should have more money, but they should also learn to teach in a more cost-effective manner. “So let me put colleges and universities on notice,” Obama warned. “If you can’t stop tuition from going up, the funding you get from taxpayers will go down.” This is a perfect example of an issue that requires the input, or at least the attention, of college students.
Obama also addressed the fact that we welcome foreign students and then make them go home once they graduate. “That doesn’t make sense,” he said.
Finally, Obama urged Congress to help start-ups and small businesses succeed and to support technological development so that America will have new jobs and industries, “the same kind of research and innovation that led to the computer chip and the internet.”
So none of us watched the State of the Union (although we did see a cool four-minute video called “Behind the Scenes: Writing the 2012 State of the Union Address”). However, the political landscape needs the attention of college students. What a change from our usual political fare: Wikipedia hunger strikes to protest SOPA and Photoshopped politicians on Reddit. 
More needs to be done; it’s our responsibility to be more aware of what’s going on, to reach out to our representatives, and to make a difference.

Student Senate is facing an exciting semester that presents a great opportunity to establish more presence on campus. In the past we have often been criticized for our lack of publicity, and rightly so. We are now attempting to take large steps to change this, one being the launch of cmusenate.org. This site contains short updates from our meetings, information about our initiatives, and news on university policy changes to help you know what we are up to. In addition, we will be tabling more frequently throughout the semester — look for us this Friday where we will be handing out hot chocolate and collecting feedback.
We are busy working on several projects, including investigating how effectively the University Center’s space is being used — specifically in the game room, where we are looking to make significant upgrades and additions. We will also be piloting a table-sharing program in crowded dining areas, expanding the number of courses with reserve textbooks, and working to ensure that all students are able to choose their Interpretation and Argument course topic.
Of course there are many more projects in progress, which you can find out about at our meetings or by visiting cmusenate.org.
Finally, Senate will be working with all branches of student government to fight the proposed route cuts by the Port Authority. I serve on the Pittsburgh Student Government Council (PSGC), which is made of representatives from all student governments in Pittsburgh. It has a tremendous amount of political power, as we successfully fought against the tuition tax of 2009–10 and other proposed cuts last year. I will work to combine the voices of our campus and the PSGC to make sure we don’t lose the bus services that are vital to student life at Carnegie Mellon. To do this, I will need your help. Resources will soon be available on our site to allow you to contact your representative and demand that the current and necessary bus routes remain.
Our projects and our advocacy cannot be successful if we don’t hear from you. I encourage you to email student-senate@ with initiatives and feedback.
Will Weiner 
Student Senate Chair
