I’d like to think that this headline’s pun is one of the more original ones out there regarding free agent pitcher Cliff Lee. Or at least more original than the corny “Cliffhanger.”
Lee, the centerpiece in a trade deadline deal for the second July in a row before helping the Rangers to the World Series this year, can start buying new Rolls Royces by the dozen as he headlines this offseason’s free agent class. Lee is not only the best pitcher available on the 2010–2011 market, but he is a guy who has done one very important thing: He has dominated the Yankees on many occasions. That pretty much sealed his fate on getting quite the handsome paycheck for the foreseeable — and even the unforeseeable — future.
It’s not that Lee is guaranteed to sign with the Yankees. That the Yankees have entered the Lee sweepstakes — and they certainly have, with GM Brian Cashman already having flown down to see Lee at his Arkansas home — means that the bidding for his services will start high and end higher. The Yankees have the obvious advantage here in that they can essentially offer Lee anything he asks and more without truly compromising their ability to sign or trade for other lineup studs; any other team entering the Cliff contest will at some point have to consider the impact of Lee’s salary on its financial flexibility for the many years on his eventual contract. The Yankees also have the ability to offer Lee a chance to pitch alongside former Indians teammate C.C. Sabathia, who had also previously dominated the Yankees in the playoffs before they blew other suitors out of the water by offering Sabathia a seven-year, $161 million contract in the ’08 offseason. To further illustrate my previous point, though, the Yankees also added two other huge contracts to their payroll that offseason, signing pitcher A.J. Burnett to a five-year, $82 million contract and first baseman Mark Teixeira to an eight-year, $180 million contract. Not that their payroll wasn’t already huge to begin with — the previous offseason, they’d inked third baseman Alex Rodriguez to a 10-year, $275 million contract extension.
The Yankees may end up not having much competition for Lee’s services to begin with. Most baseball analysts have predicted that the Rangers will be the only team competing with the Bronx Buyers to land Lee. The Rangers, Lee’s current team, would be wise to lock up Lee for many years as a pillar to build their young rotation on; at 32 years of age, Lee still has enough good years ahead of him, barring injuries, to ensure a high reward for at least the next five years. The problem, though, is that any deal beyond five years for a pitcher is unwise and unnecessary, as most pitchers tend to fall victim to shoulder ailments and even shoulder surgeries at some point in their career, especially by their late 30s. The Rangers may be hesitant to sign Lee to an absurdly long-term deal for that very reason; however, they may be forced to, as the Yankees have proven that short-term success is the only thing they care about, and money and years are just formalities in the process of signing a big-ticket guy like Lee, regardless of the potential long-term consequences.
That said, as problematic as it may prove in the future, the Rangers would be unwise not to go all out for Lee. As it stands, they have plenty of young talent that will not enter the free agent class for a few more years. Lee would provide enough short-term reward that it would be a historically good move to keep him on the staff, and it would be good for baseball if a team not owned by the Steinbrenners signed the biggest free agent on the market. While baseball fans worldwide may ponder the possible success of a rotation that includes Lee, Sabathia, and Phil Hughes, the offseason would be boring and frustrating if the Yanks walked away again with the kind of purchase that the 29 other Major League franchises would deem irresponsible.
That said, I expect to cringe when I see Lee in a pinstriped uniform come spring training. Happy offseason!

The Carnegie Mellon swimming and diving team continued its strong opening of the 2010–2011 season with a definitive win against Grove City College last Saturday. Both the men’s and women’s teams kept up their performance after the win over Clarion University on Oct. 30. 
The women’s team started the day off strongly with a victory in the 200-yard medley relay. Senior Molly Evans, sophomore Breanna Stillo, first-year Megan Garvey, and senior Brianne Burton all contributed toward the winning 1:48.95 time. The men did not start off with a win in the 200-yard medley, but gained momentum after a victory in the 1,000-yard freestyle by senior Frank Olechnowicz. Even after the strong win, Olechnowicz did not stop thinking about ways to improve. “Our work ethic could be higher overall as a team,” he said. His goals for the Tartans include setting team records during his last year swimming here.
In the women’s 200-yard freestyle event, senior Molly Evans won the race with a time of 1:53.81. After individually reaching nationals in previous years, Evans’ goals this year are more focused on the team. “We’re swimming a lot faster in season. We’re not afraid of competition, and we’re not afraid to get up and race,” she said. “Our goal is to get a team to nationals.” 
The men’s team took both first and second place in the 100-yard butterfly event. First-years Terrence Wong and Joshua Chen achieved times of 51.55 and 51.86, respectively. As new members of the team, they contributed to the revitalized feeling of the team this year. 
“Last year, we had a lot of good seniors, with most of them going to nationals for their respective events,” said senior Josh Plotnik. “This year, we have 24 guys that have to work for each other. We have to go one to 24 to beat these teams.” 
The Tartans look forward to the upcoming Nike Cup Invitational, which will be held at Kenyon College Dec. 2–4, as well as hosting next week’s invitational against Franklin & Marshall, Washington & Lee University, and the University of Rochester.

The Carnegie Mellon men’s and women’s cross country team traveled to Cooper’s Lake Campground in Slippery Rock, Pa., to host the 2010 Mideast Regional this past Saturday. The women, led by third-place finisher sophomore Emily Wobb, placed sixth overall as a team, while the men had three top-25 finishers to take third in the team standings.
Wobb, who finished sixth at the regional last year, led the Tartans with her third-place time of 22:00.3 in the 6k, a mere 3.1 seconds behind champion Cecilia Furlong of Johns Hopkins University, whose team placed first in the team standings. The Tartans’ two senior captains finished next for the team, as Courtney Baker’s time of 22:48.0 was good for 14th place, and Laura McKee claimed 72nd with her 24:25.3 finish. Not far behind were senior Danielle Morse (24:39.0) and sophomore Eva Humphrey (24:41.6), who finished 81st and 86th, respectively.
While the men did not have a top-three finisher, they had six of the top 50 finishers, leading to their third-place finish as a team. Haverford College ran away with the competition with five of the top seven finishers, including champion Anders Hulleberg. The Tartans’ seniors outran their teammates, led by Nate Bussiere, who improved on his 19th-place finish from 2009 to take 10th overall at this year’s 8k in 25:33.9. Dan Addis was only 1.2 seconds behind in 12th place, while J.P. Allera’s time of 25:53.2 was fast enough for 23rd overall, a mere 0.1 seconds behind 22nd. Evan Gates was the first non-senior to finish for Carnegie Mellon, as the sophomore crossed the finish line in 26:09.6 before senior Justin Kurp and first-year Mike Standish rounded out the Tartans’ top-50 group at 26:29.6 (43rd) and 26:29.8 (44th), respectively. Junior Matt Jacob, who joined Addis, Allera, Bussiere, and Kurp on last year’s NCAA squad, finished 70th at the regional in 27:00.8.
This marks the last competition in the cross country season for both teams before the NCAA Championships on Saturday at Wartburg College in Iowa. Last year, Wobb was the sole competitor for the women’s team, while the men’s team placed 12th overall.

For many, getting admitted to Carnegie Mellon is an accomplishment in itself. The first semester allows recovering victims of senioritis a modest transition from high school to college. But for the first-years on the Carnegie Mellon’s men’s soccer team, coming to college meant business even before the school year began. With such a large pool of players trying out this year, it was clear that not everyone was going to make the final roster for the 2010 men’s soccer season. But if there was one name that seemed to resonate in people’s ears during preseason, it was that of first-year forward Max Tassano.
Having lost speedy forwards Ricky Griffin and Pat Lutz last season, Tassano, at an imposing 6'2", brought an extra dynamic to Carnegie Mellon’s attack — it was clear from the start that the tall and skilled Tassano was going to play a key role in the Tartans’ season. As a first-year, Tassano gradually became a starter for Carnegie Mellon this past season and impressively was the team’s leading goal scorer with seven goals.
“By the end of the year we had four or five freshmen starting. The freshmen are all a very tight group and we’re all really good friends ,and clearly this was reflected with the chemistry on the field,” Tassano said. “I think it was because of this understanding and familiarity amongst the freshmen that made it easier for Joey [Paladino] and I to get on the score sheet throughout the season.”
Like most student athletes at Carnegie Mellon, Tassano chose his university based on both academics and athletics. Having won state and regional championships with his Philadelphia-based club team Lower Merion Velez throughout all of high school, Tassano attracted a lot of attention and was able to keep his options for college open. But after visiting Carnegie Mellon his junior year, he knew early on that he would commit.
Similar to most of the guys on the team, Tassano follows international soccer. He enjoys watching London’s Arsenal Football Club and tries to emulate the style of play of English star forward Peter Crouch, whose play and body type are similar to Tassano’s. However, it was not always clear that soccer was going to be Tassano’s sport of choice. Baseball also took up most of Tassano’s athletic life. But after he broke his arm twice, Tassano started to focus more on soccer.
With his first semester already a large success here at Carnegie Mellon, Tassano has even higher aspirations for his collegiate career. 
“I really think that we will be strong contenders for the national championship in the coming years. This is our goal, and we think we can make a really strong push even as early as next year,” Tassano said. “As for myself, I guarantee you that I will be in the weight room throughout all of this winter and spring. For me that was definitely the biggest difference in college-level soccer. Definitely the physicality.”

In its last game of the season, the Carnegie Mellon football team fell to Case Western Reserve University 28–0 on Saturday, but managed to surpass the Spartans in net yards rushing 231–84 and in possession time by nearly 13 minutes.
The loss wrapped up the season for the Tartan team, which finished 4–6 overall and 0–3 in the UAA. Case Western Reserve was a strong opponent, as the Spartans finished their season 8–2 overall. A few individual performances stood out in Saturday’s game: Offensive leaders senior Justin Pratt and sophomore Jake Nardone recorded 77 and 52 yards rushing, respectively, and defensive lineman senior Mike Shedlosky bagged 10 tackles. 
The Tartans played a strong first quarter by having solid offense and defense. The Spartans were unable to penetrate the Tartan defense initially; however, the Spartans increased their level of offense in the second quarter and blitzed to the end zone, scoring a touchdown to put them on the scoreboard at 7–0. The Tartans fought back, but gave up the second touchdown of the game on a turnover. This brought the first half of the game to an end with the Spartans in the lead 14–0.
The Spartans came out on fire and proved unstoppable in the third quarter. Carnegie Mellon still did not give up, but continued to fight. Down 21–0, the Tartans stuck with their game plan, waiting for a chance to enact it. The Tartans were ahead of the Spartans in terms of rushing yards, but the Spartans were topping the Tartans in total yards, and that made the difference. The Spartans came up with a fourth touchdown near the end of the third quarter. This brought the score to 28–0 leading into the fourth quarter.
The Tartans held the Spartans off for the entire fourth quarter, and the final score remained 28–0.
The game ended the fall 2010 season for Carnegie Mellon football. It left the team fired up and ready to set new goals for next season. If the Tartans to continue to work hard in the gym during their offseason, the team and its fans can expect improvement next season.

We see it every year and in every sport. A team starts to struggle with a talented roster, and as the season starts to collapse, owners start to panic. After a while, it gets to a breaking point, and a coach or manager gets fired, whether for good reason or just to be a scapegoat. Just this past week, Wade Phillips, who was the Dallas Cowboys’ coach of almost four years, was unsurprisingly fired after leading the Cowboys to a 1–7 start. Although the firing was definitely needed, it leads to a debate over midseason coaching changes. Should owners wait out the storm until the end of the season before making a change? Or should changes be made immediately, in order to salvage some lost seasons?  
Even though I am a very impatient fan when it comes to sports, I am a staunch believer in owners waiting until the end of the year to make coaching changes. In most cases, the season is lost and there is no reason to try and turn the team around during the season. Take this year’s Cowboys, for example. Starting off 1–7 in the NFL is basically a guarantee that the team will miss the playoffs. With the firing of Phillips, infamous owner Jerry Jones promoted offensive coordinator Jason Garrett to coach the team for the rest of the year. This change just isn’t necessary. Garrett, who is basically a disciple of Phillips’ system, doesn’t seem like he’ll be able to make drastic changes. I just don’t see a point in hiring a new coach when he is put in a losing situation. Most likely, the players will give up on the season (it looks like they already have), and the rest of the season will just be a disappointing audition for Garrett’s coaching skills. When the offseason comes around, Garrett will be an afterthought in the potential coaching pool because of the rest of this season. He deserves better than this, as he knows all of the players along with their tendencies.  
Along with the bad impression that it will leave on the interim coach, there is also an extremely low chance of success in a season with a coaching change. In fact, no NFL interim head coach has made the playoffs since 1970, and no interim head coach has ever made the Super Bowl. What’s the point of changing midseason when you won’t see results?  We’ve already established that the team won’t be comfortable with the change and the audition for the coach won’t go well the majority of the time. An argument I hear in favor of midseason changes is the fact that the NFL is such a short season. Oftentimes, people say in a longer season like that in Major League Baseball, which is 162 games, managerial changes have a big chance at turning the team around. However, little do these people know that only 6 percent of managerial changes during midseason have resulted in that team making the playoffs. Long season or short season, coaching changes just don’t work.  
Either way, we all know that midseason changes will happen in every sport in every year. We’ve already seen one change in the NFL this year, and there are rumors that there will be a few more to come. Two of the coaches that are feeling the burn of the hot seat are Vikings coach Brad Childress, also known as “Chilly,” and Broncos coach Josh McDaniels. Childress has had a season-long soap opera with famous quarterback Brett Favre while also bringing in prima donna wide receiver Randy Moss before waiving him just last week for detrimental conduct to the team. In fact, three different Vikings players have voiced their displeasure with Childress, with one even saying anonymously on www.espn.com, “We win in spite of him.” Although it isn’t uncommon for players to dislike their coaches, you don’t often hear them declaring so in public. Childress, who has gotten his team to turn around a few after some tough losses, may have saved his job last week with a huge comeback victory to keep Minnesota in the playoff race.  
McDaniels, on the other hand, is not having the success he expected when he took the Broncos job in the beginning of last year. After starting the 2009–2010 season with a perfect record of 6–0, McDaniels has led his team to a ridiculously bad 4–14 mark since then, which caused Denver to miss the playoffs in 2009. McDaniels is a classic case of an unproven coach coming into an organization while overestimating his own coaching skills. When he was offensive coordinator for the Patriots, McDaniels had success coaching under the genius of Bill Belichick, who is considered by many to be the best active coach in the NFL. However, McDaniels has yet to show the intelligence and savvy that Belichick had to win multiple Super Bowls. In fact, McDaniels has driven his two best players away through heated stand-offs and eventual trades to other teams. If any team needs a midseason coaching change, it may be the Denver Broncos.  These guys need some new direction as soon as possible.
With the success rate of midseason coaching changes, it’s clear to me that “shaking the organization up” just won’t work most of the time. It’s time for owners to realize this, and to acknowledge when a lost season should just be played out by the failing coach. I’ve come to this conclusion: Unless your coach is McDaniels, you shouldn’t be happy if your favorite team just changed its coach midseason.

“What are we all made of?” asked Thomas Ferguson, a professor in Carnegie Mellon’s physics department. Scientists have yet to find a clear answer to this profound and puzzling question. Many fundamental questions have been motivating scientists and engineers for centuries to try to understand how the world around us works. How do forces work? What gives things mass? And of course, possibly the most puzzling inquiry of them all: Why does nature work the way it does?
Ferguson has been working on answering these questions for over 30 years, beginning with his graduate work at the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) in the early 1970s. This was an exciting time for particle physics research, as a particle called the charm quark had just been discovered at the Stanford Linear Accelerator Center, where Ferguson and some other UCLA researchers later performed experiments. The discovery of this quark added to the understanding of the fundamental pieces that make up matter. Through not directly involved, Ferguson was hooked on particle physics after witnessing the discovery.
“We’ve been at it now for about 30 years. We’ve made tremendous strides in understanding the properties of those particles, but we still don’t understand why nature did all of this. It’s a very complicated system,” Ferguson said.
The general goal of particle physics is to study the most fundamental particles that make up matter, and a particle accelerator is one of the most common tools used in reaching this goal. The European Organization for Nuclear Research explains that an accelerator’s general operation involves accelerating a particle, such as a proton or an electron, to speeds near the speed of light and causing a collision between it and another particle. The result is essentially a subatomic explosion that reveals all the smaller pieces that made up the two original particles. These pieces are observed by detectors and heavily studied. The most powerful particle accelerator in the world is located near Geneva, Switzerland. This is where Ferguson currently spends his summers.
This particle accelerator in Geneva is called the Large Hadron Collider (LHC), and it is roughly 17 miles in circumference, making it the largest particle accelerator in the world. Ferguson began working there over two decades ago, helping construct the Compact Muon Solenoid (CMS), a large detector that captures the products of a particle collision.
“Two protons hit each other and they can make lots of different things,” Ferguson said. “It turns out a lot of the interesting things that you’re looking at decay to muons.” The goals of the CMS are to discover particles that no one else has ever discovered and to measure particles that have already been discovered, but at a much higher level of detail. In working on the CMS, Ferguson is also accompanied by Carnegie Mellon physics professors James Russ, Manfred Paulini, and Helmut Vogel.
One particle, the Higgs boson, has been predicted to exist, but no one has been able to actually see or measure it yet — something that has kept particle physicists on their toes. It is the only particle described by the Standard Model that has not been confirmed through experimentation. The Standard Model is a theory that is useful to particle physicists, as it has predicted the existence of countless forces, particles, and interactions, thus gaining a reputation of being a theory of almost everything. The discovery of the Higgs boson would explain why certain things have mass, which would be an immense improvement in our understanding of the world around us.
“The Higgs is the last undiscovered particle in this beautiful theory. We want to complete it, and we want to make sure that the theory is as complete as can be,” Ferguson said.
The challenging part about discovering new particles is that physicists only know limited information about the particle. Fortunately, the Standard Model that predicts the Higgs boson’s existence gives physicists a few clues. It predicts that the Higgs boson can only exist under a certain range of energies, and this allows physicists to focus on this range when performing experiments. If the Higgs boson is never found and physicists have conclusive evidence that it does not exist, then the Standard Model will be flawed and the understanding of subatomic particles will be at stake.
“It would bring all of the physicists back to the drawing boards,” Ferguson said.
Although it would be exciting if the Higgs is discovered, Ferguson explains that experiments will not end there, as more questions will always and inevitably arise from new discoveries. “Each time you answer a question, you’ve got 10 more. It’s a continuing attempt to understand what’s around us. It’s a noble goal, and it’s fun.”

Pharmaceutical drugs have become so common in our lives that they sometimes appear in surprising locations. Researchers at Carnegie Mellon’s Steinbrenner Institute, which focuses on environmental science research and safe environmental practices and policies, have performed extensive work in determining the effects of pharmaceuticals in public water supplies.
David Dzombak, a professor in the civil and environmental engineering department and faculty director of the Steinbrenner Institute, expressed concern at the inability of waste water treatment plants to remove these pharmaceutical compounds. Although he has performed no specific research in this area, he has worked closely with interdisciplinary departments exploring water quality problems.
“[These contaminants are] in very small concentrations, but we’re ingesting them,” Dzombak said. “Many of them don’t break down very well, or at all.... We don’t know what that means exactly, and so people are investigating the toxicity as well as ways to remove them.”
These problems were brought to the public’s attention in the late 1990s, according to Dzombak, especially concerning compounds known as endocrine disrupters, which are present in many pharmaceuticals and cosmetics and affect endocrine systems of people and animals. In the early 21st century, the U.S. Geological Survey analyzed various sources of surface water, such as streams and lakes, across the United States and found detectable levels of many antibiotics and other substances. Because of this discovery, concern has risen regarding similar chemical water contaminants, and the U.S. Geological Survey has conducted new surveys approximately every five years to observe new trends.
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention have conducted several national surveys in which blood samples were taken from people of different race, sex, and age distributions, and researchers found that these pharmaceuticals and antibiotics were present in trace amounts in their bodies. These surveys, in addition, are taken frequently. According to Dzombak, they address questions such as, “Are some of these chemicals decreasing? Are some of them increasing?” Dzombak also wants to discover if their presence may have any deleterious health effects.
Interdisciplinary fields are working with the Steinbrenner Institute to gather data on water quality and what can be done to improve it. The Center for Environmental Implications of Nanotechnology works with carbon nanotubes and silver nanoparticles, for example, in conjunction with Duke University, and studies “how they get distributed in the environment, how these particles are moving in the environment, what their potential for exposure is to various eco-receptors — plants and animals.”
Other researchers are working to improve the quantity of technologies available now. Carnegie Mellon organic chemistry professor Newell Washburn has been working with small molecules that can digest large organic compounds, such as those found in pharmaceuticals. These small molecules, known as tetra-amido macrocyclic ligands (TAMLs), act as catalysts to oxidize and digest the impurities, but their small size causes them to move with the current of moving water. To compensate for this, Washburn adhered the TAMLs to a carbon surface so that water can pass through them more readily. However, this technology may not be ready for large-scale use. “If you want to purify 200 million gallons of water for Pittsburgh,” Washburn stated, “it’s not economically viable as it stands now.”
Steinbrenner Institute research will continue in the future, but Dzombak warned that the problems are much closer to home. “Here in Pittsburgh and in other cities, we still dump raw sewage into our rivers. Abandoned mine drainage is the biggest water quality problem in Pennsylvania,” he said. However, he remains hopeful. “What I would like to see is for us, as a society, to take more aggressive action on longstanding problems that we have not solved yet. It takes political will and money to do it, but we’re doing it; we’re making progress.”

“I’ve never seen anyone at all. I’ve never heard a word until now. I’ve never had a dream, even. Day and night are the same — blank. Precisely like death.”
Clive Wearing, a famous amnesia patient, gave this description of a severe form of amnesia, or memory loss, in a video segment by the BBC. In 1985, a rare virus infected his brain, causing damage to important brain structures. As a result of the disease, Wearing’s memory now lasts for a maximum of 30 seconds, after which he feels like he has just woken up.
One of the regions of Wearing’s brain damaged was the hippocampus. Many amnesia patients similar to Wearing have had their hippocampus damaged, which has led scientists to believe that this region is in some way responsible for forming new memories.
While Wearing can no longer remember the tastes of foods, such that every bite is a new experience, he functions no differently from a normal person in actions and speech. Before his amnesia, he was a professional musician — his skills at the piano are undiminished. His wife is the only face he recognizes, and every moment he sees her, he feels like they have reunited after decades, even though she may have just left the room for a moment.
The two forms of amnesia are retrograde and anterograde amnesia. These terms describe which memories have been erased in relation to the present time. Retrograde amnesia, according to neurology.health-cares.net, occurs when memories are removed prior to the events that caused the amnesia. Anterograde amnesia prevents new events from creating new memories. Since Wearing does not remember some events prior to the virus attack, and since he also cannot form new memories, he has both retrograde and anterograde amnesia.
It is important to appreciate how memory works when understanding amnesia. According to the book Brain and Behavior by Brian Kolb and Ian Whishaw, memory can be divided into two categories: explicit memory and implicit memory.
Explicit memory involves a conscious recollection of training, such as learning a fact. Wearing’s erased memories are explicit memories and are memories of events. Implicit memory can be thought of as unconscious memory, such as a habit or skill. Wearing’s ability to play the piano is an example of implicit memory. It is thought that implicit memory is diffusely spread across the brain, which is why destroying a region of the brain, like the damage caused by the virus Wearing contracted, will not remove the memory.
The basis of memory formation involves neurons, which can interact with other neurons via chemical or electrical signals. According to_ Discovery Health_, neurons in the brain are constantly forming new connections and removing old ones. Neurons that interact form stronger connections between each other over time. By practicing a piece of music, for example, a person  causes the same neurons to fire together. Therefore, the connections between the neurons that fire when practicing are enhanced, strengthening a memory.
Memory retrieval, such as an individual remembering specific events, is not widely understood. Studies have shown increased activity in certain structures of the brains of participants who were asked to recall a list of items, but scientists are unsure of the specific roles of the structures. Furthermore, different types of recall exist, including recognition, where subjects are asked if they have seen an item on a list before, and free recall, where subjects are asked to recall the items on the list in any order.
When someone has amnesia, part of the pathway involved in forming new memories or retrieving old ones is damaged. Neuroscientists are trying to determine what the pathway is, in order to understand how memory works and how amnesia might be cured. Studying patients like Wearing, while sometimes heartbreaking, can yield great insight into the workings of the mind.

In today’s fast-paced world, transferring money needs to be fast and secure. Wire transfer is one such method that is commonly associated with modern online banking, but its history is longer than many believe.
A wire transfer is when money is sent digitally from one bank to another, and the concept of this system actually predates the 20th century. The system of wire transfers originated with the creation of the first telegraph company. A few of these companies are still in existence, such as Western Union (WU), a former telegraph company turned financial service company. Its main service, a wire transfer, is used hundreds of thousands of times a day between individuals, businesses, and even the government, according to www.westernunion.com. A hundred or so years ago, an individual would approach a Western Union office and request a sum of money be transferred across the country. That person would pay WU, and a telegraph would be sent to the receiving end, instructing the local WU branch to deliver the money to the receiver. Nowadays, this transaction is handled online.
Online money transferring is relatively simple and quick. The transaction involves taking electronic money from a bank or financial services institution and sending it to a second location, either in the United States or abroad. Usually there is a fee for sending or receiving a wire transfer, depending on which financial services institution one uses. There is also usually a limit to how much money one can transfer — Citibank puts a cap at $50,000 per transaction. The delivery date and processing time window also varies from bank to bank.
To transfer money, one would go to a financial services company such as WU or a bank and request a wire. The sender would provide the receiver’s account information and number. The institution would then assign International Bank Account Numbers (IBAN) and Business Identifier Codes (BIC), which allow the institutions to identify the amount of money sent and where to send it.
The next step is for the sending institution to contact the receiving party using a secure online system, such as Fedwire, a Federal Reserve Bank-operated company, or Clearing House Interbank Payments System (CHIPS). If approved, the money will be relayed from the original bank to the receiving bank.
According to frbservices.org, Fedwire and CHIPS are companies that ensure secure wire transfers of information between the respective financial institutions involved in the transaction are real-time gross settlement systems, which means the payments are instant and irreversible. The only organizations who have access to these services, according to www.fraudaid.com, are Federal Reserve banks, its related institutions, and foreign banks within the United States. The Federal Reserve board website states that in 2009, there were $631.1 trillion moved within the United States using the Fedwire and its subsidiaries. Besides ordinary money transfers, a large bulk of the transactions are the collection of taxes and sales of U.S securities or federal funds. Federal funds are money a bank borrows from a second bank to maintain its reserve requirement.
Besides online wire transfers, banks have also moved a great portion of their business online. For example, one can pay bills, transfer money between linked accounts, manage Individual Retirement Accounts, or even set up credit cards through the Internet. Banking still has the same rules and regulations, however. The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), run by the government, still insures up to $250,000 per bank account with member bank institutions, and banks, depending on their size, can be required to maintain up to 10 percent of their capital physically within their vaults. The other 90 percent is loaned out to other banks or lenders with varying interest rates.
While the technology of banking has become increasingly electronic, banks still maintain some of their roots from their early history.

Supercomputers may shrink to size of sugar cubes
IBM scientists have reported that new developments in supercomputer processors could allow supercomputers to be made the size of sugar cubes. This would allow the energy consumption for the computers to decrease, a major goal for scientists who feel that supercomputers will soon be evaluated by energy consumption rather than speed. The cost of computer parts has decreased to the point that electrical consumption cost, which is mainly from cooling the computer, will dominate the cost of computing hardware.
The computer design involves stacks of computer processors with cooling water flowing between each stack. A prototype called Aquasar has been built that is already 50 percent more efficient than the leading supercomputers, but is the size of a large refrigerator. Scientists are using water because it can remove 4,000 times more waste heat than a system that cools using air. One main problem is reducing the size of the cooling equipment needed — a possible solution takes ideas from the human body by branching the water lines, similar to the body’s circulatory system. Another problem is making the circuitry waterproof.
Scientists predict that a sugar cube-sized supercomputer may be working in 10 to 15 years.

Iron Man suit being developed
Raytheon Sarcos, a defense contractor in Salt Lake City, recently showcased the XOS-2 exoskeleton, a kind of metal suit that allows the wearer to perform feats of strength. Rex Jameson, Sarcos’ test engineer, demonstrated the suit. Since the suit follows the user’s movements, it was able to imitate Jameson as he shadowboxed, and it increased Jameson’s strength by 17 times.
The suit is powered by an external hydraulic power source, and it activates by a user stepping into its boots, reminiscent of a real-life Iron Man. The suit supports its own weight and responds to forces exerted by the user’s feet, plus actuators that control the hands.
The suit is designed for use by the U.S. military for tasks such as carrying heavy boxes of ammunition and other military supplies, up to 16,000 pounds a day. It was reported that one person wearing a suit could replace up to three soldiers. However, current battery technology prevents the suit from working without an external energy source, and malfunctions can be dangerous.

Energy bubbles observed in space
Scientists at NASA’s Fermi Gamma Ray Space Telescope have discovered two bubbles of energy with diameters of 25,000 light years. The energy contained within the bubbles is equivalent to 100,000 supernova explosions, a truly astronomical amount. The bubbles extend outward above and below the center of the Milky Way galaxy. However, the researchers do not yet know what caused the bubbles to form. Some postulate that star births and star deaths promoted their formation. Another possibility is that a black hole at the center of the galaxy released the energy. Regardless of the cause, scientists are confounded by why the bubbles had not been suspected earlier, given their size.
Initial discoveries of high-energy haze of particles led to the discovery of the bubbles. The haze was thought to be composed of concentrated dark matter around the center of the galaxy, but it was then discovered that the high-energy particle haze had distinct boundaries, just like bubbles. The current understanding of dark matter shows that it does not confine itself within boundaries, so scientists are working to understand more about the energy bubbles.

These past two weeks were exciting ones for those music enthusiasts who have been tracking the most recent album releases on the indie music scene. With new albums from veterans like Michigan-born singer-songwriter Sufjan Stevens and the influential Glasgow indie-pop band Belle and Sebastian, there has recently been plenty of new music to listen to and critique.
Sufjan Stevens — Age of Adz
After the release of his third album, Michigan, in 2003, famed American singer-songwriter Stevens unveiled to his fans his intent to record 50 albums in his lifetime, one for each state within the United States. Though the musician’s ultimate goal may have changed in its specifics, the founding idea behind this artist, his love for creating new music, remains unchanged. In a feat undeniably impressive for any musician, mid-October marked the release of Stevens’ newest album, The Age of Adz, bringing the total number of albums created by Stevens to 10.
Though this newest album includes sounds and characteristics that are undeniably “Sufjan,” there are aspects of this album that seem to set it apart. Stevens has always been praised for the quirky qualities of his songs, including references to historical figures and detailed pictures of American culture within his lyrics. In this new album, Stevens seems to be focusing less on external ideals and more on the processes of his own mind — and listeners are loving it. Possibly the most talked-about song on The Age of Adz is the album’s final track, “Impossible Soul,” which at around 25 minutes comprises nearly one-third of the entire album. This song, though described by One Thirty BPM reviewer Rob Hakimian as a bit “bloated,” is an epic proclamation of love that brings listeners along on its bold journey.
While reviews of the album have been mixed, the consensus remains mostly positive. In his 10th album, Stevens has reached outside of his norm to create an 11-track album that allows listeners a glance into the inner mind of this indie-folk superstar. 
Belle and Sebastian — Write About Love
Having originally formed in 1996, it’s no surprise that Belle and Sebastian have been able to release a total of eight albums throughout their career. Their most recent album, Write About Love, released in mid-October, is the first thing listeners have heard from the group since The Life Pursuit, released right before Belle and Sebastian took a five-year break.
As a group, Belle and Sebastian have been referred to as a relatively one-man show, headed by Stuart Murdoch, the main singer and front man of the group. The greatest thing about this album, and what really sets it apart from the band’s past albums, is that several of the tracks feature not only the various members of Belle and Sebastian, but also several guest artists. 
While the album has been well-received in the typical Belle and Sebastian fashion for its elegant melodies and detailed song-writing, if you’re a fan of the group’s classic sound, be prepared for something entirely new. The songs on this album are obsessively cheery in subject and tonality. While most would assume this sound to get old fast, surprisingly it doesn’t. There is something about the album that, though pop-oriented, is incredibly enjoyable. It’s exciting to see this iconic group expand its repertoire and venture into some uncharted musical territory.

Songs about tambourine players, Bristol Palin’s boyfriend, a hallucinating music fan, and getting sleazy? You must be at a Ben Folds concert.
The last time Folds came to Pittsburgh, he performed in regal Heinz Hall with the Pittsburgh Symphony Orchestra. This past Thursday at his concert at Club Zoo, his location and accompaniment may have been less formal, but what it lacked in formality it made up for in energy and entertainment.
Folds came to Pittsburgh as part of his Lonely Avenue tour, promoting his new CD of the same name, for which British novelist Nick Hornby wrote the lyrics and Folds wrote the music. In honor of his new album, he began the show with a few of his new songs, including “A Working Day” and “Doc Pomus.” These unfortunately didn’t seem to catch the audience’s attention much, since most attendees appeared to be relatively unfamiliar with his new material. However, Folds recaptured their attention when he announced that, in preparation for the show, he had decided to do a cover of the No. 1 song on iTunes, which at the time was Ke$ha’s “Sleazy.” After solemnly explaining the song’s message, Folds broke into a cheery rendition of the song, featuring him rapping and playing the piano while his bandmates provided accompaniment with bright harmonies, percussion, and a glockenspiel.
After his Ke$ha cover, Folds started playing some older, more well-known songs, including “Still Fighting It” and “Gone,” all of which the audience greeted as though they were old friends. With each familiar song that Folds began to play, the audience members would cheer with recognition and begin singing along.
Folds was sometimes a little off-key in his singing, and his voice seemed to give out at a few moments in the show, but what he lacked in singing he made up for with his piano playing and entertaining stage presence. Occasionally he would break into improvisational piano solos between songs, or even in the middle of songs. After a performance of the song “Effington,” during which one of his band members dramatically played the tambourine, Folds started improvising a blues song about the tambourine. He also took time between songs to talk to the audience, stopping to explain the history behind several of his songs. He also confessed his love for Pittsburgh to the audience — he incorporated names of Pittsburgh neighborhoods into one of his songs and told a story about a clarinet-playing cab driver that he met in Pittsburgh. These interludes were still entertaining even though the sound system within the Zoo was not the highest quality, making it sometimes difficult to hear Folds speak.
At one point in the show, Folds’ four bandmates left the stage and Folds made up a song on the spot with a maraca and the piano. Then he played the loving ballads “Luckiest” and “Practical Amanda,” the latter of which Hornby had written for his wife.
After closing with a series of high-powered numbers, such as “Rockin’ The Suburbs,” “Army,” and a cover of Jimi Hendrix’s “Purple Haze,” Folds left the stage, only to come back five minutes later due to the  unceasing cheers of the crowd calling for an encore. Folds played a cover of “Bitches Ain’t Shit,” a Dr. Dre song, followed by the Ben Folds Five song “Underground.” Overall the show was an entertaining evening full of witty lyrics and high-energy music, both of which are concepts that Folds seems to have perfected.

¿Por qué?
That question — “Why?” — was posed to me by one of the architectural engineers, Nicolas Fernández Muñoz, from Patronato de Nutricion — a partner land-grant non-government organization with whom my teammates and I came to work. Nicolas had been working with rural communities filled with subsistence farmers in El Cope, Panama, to alleviate the income disparity between the modernized urban society and the lagging rural communities. He was our driver, as well as our guide for the community.
Stepping off the four-by-four Toyota pickup truck, I recollected how my teammates and I all first joined the Panama Project. As a first-year, in 2008, I interviewed to be part of Global Business Brigades, a nonprofit organization that aims to empower students in sustainable development, whose Carnegie Mellon chapter was started by Carnegie Mellon alumni Dhruv Mathur and Kate Edgar. As part of the Carnegie Mellon team that consisted of 10 undergraduate students and two graduate students, I felt anxious working with people I had never met before. But before I knew it, we had fundraised close to $21,000 to travel to Panama over spring break and assist a rural subsistence farmer, Don Alejandro, in starting an agricultural/eco-tourism enterprise.
In the mountainous region of El Cope, approximately 2,000 miles away from Pittsburgh and five hours away from Panama City, we arrived in a rural community  located in the National Park Omar Torrijos, named after the late Major General Omar Torrijos Herrera. I soaked up the sights of the lush green serenity, whose magnificence left us all captivated. At this point, it was just my team members, the Panama Project, and me.
My first encounter with Alejandro proved to be more difficult than expected. Alejandro’s grey hair whispered years of knowledge. His enormous, brawny hands and bare feet sinking into the muddy earth represented scars of pride. We had seen pictures of the landscape and had been told what Alejandro was like, but reality was different. Our presence in a foreign environment — where almost no English is spoken and no electricity is used — and our portable bathroom all seemed difficult and unfamiliar. Nonetheless, our energetic team began the week with hopes to connect with the family.
The idea of empowering other people who were in need of help appealed to me. As a first-year, being part of a development project where we see real growth and change in the lives of others made me feel that I, too, had something to offer to the world. I tried pulling out all of my knowledge that I had gathered in Principles of Economics and other classes to contribute to creating a business plan. Yet the problem wasn’t that we were incapable of helping. It lay in the fact that we lacked trust from the family. Alejandro told us that other students came before us to help them, but made no real change and shortly left to never come back. He was afraid that we would do the same.
In the following days, we ran a series of workshops focusing on finance, operations, and marketing that would help increase the efficiency of the farm. Aside from the workshops, other members executed immediate deliverables by building pathways and signs in Spanish and English for tourists. These initiatives, ultimately, drew us closer to gaining the trust in the family. This cycle continued on until we arrived at another dilemma.
Once the community members heard about us coming into the region to assist Alejandro and his family, they, too, came with their hands open asking for help. In a matter of days, our project went from helping a single family to an entire community. Overwhelmed but optimistic, our team decided to help them too. But by the time we had finished surveying the other community members’ projects and attractions, it had already been a week. The team left, filled with excitement and high hopes on the future onset of the project. When we returned to Pittsburgh, we evaluated what we had done and explored what we needed to do — so we decided to go back.
In 2009–2010, six returning members and seven new members made up a 13-member team that went back to continue where we had left off. But when we arrived at the farm, we didn’t just say hello to Alejandro. We rushed over to give him a hug. And instead of referring to me as Corea (“Korea”) as he had previously called me, he referred to me as hijo (“son”).
“So, why?” asked Nicolas.
Why did we raise so much money, invest time and effort, to help these people in Panama?
I simply replied, ¿Por qué no? (“Why not?”)

There’s a new exhibit in town just down the road at the Carnegie Museum of Art. Running until Jan. 9, 2011, Ordinary Madness will surely leave you with raised eyebrows and a feeling of bewilderment. 
The exhibit is divided into two parts. The first, featured on the main floor, is tucked away in an open room off the main walkway. An info panel describes the life and work of James Lee Byars, an artist who seems to be a perfect personification of the phrase “ordinary madness.” Most definitely a leader and not a follower in the world of art, Byars drew inspiration from his former home of Japan, particularly Shinto ritual and Noh theatre.
Byars blurs line between insanity and creativity. When he sent a 118-foot long scroll of addresses to Gustave von Groschwitz — the director of the Carnegie Museum of Art from 1963 to 1968 — was he not all there upstairs, or was it just too creative of a project for most to understand? When he had a woman dressed as a nun unfold a 1,000-foot roll of paper in a zigzag pattern across the Hall of Sculpture, was it artistic or absurd? Byras pioneered this sort of performance art, which he called “happenings.”
The second part of the exhibit, residing in the Heinz Gallery, features even more seemingly nonsensical works from various artists. The explorative nature of the exhibit is investigated because, as an information panel states, “The ordinary is in fact laced with the contradictory, uncanny, and surreal.”
Trisha Donnelly’s “Sea Battles” looks like ordinary pages of sheet music, with chords of notes etched in. But the music notes are strategically placed: Donnelly transposed wartime naval confrontation plans onto sheet music, where each note represents a ship.
“The Temptation of St. Anthony - The Forms” by Tim Rollins brings the characters inside a story so all spectators can see. Rollins and his students took 42 copies of a page from Gustave Flaubert’s book The Temptation of St. Anthony — specifically, a dialogue with Death — and combined blood, alcohol, and acrylic to produce a grid of emotion on the page that was hidden inside the author’s text.
In the center of one of the rooms sits Benny Le Va’s “On Corner-On Edge-On Center Shatter (Within the Series of Layered Pattern Attacks).” Composed of four piles of five panes of shattered glass, the piece was not very remarkable because glass art is something we’ve all seen before. But for some reason, the geometry of the panes, the cracks that seem strategically placed in the glass, resonates some beauty.
Among the other peculiar pieces is Edward and Nancy Reddin Kienholz’s “The Billionaire,” a hollowed-out TV set with a detonator-looking device inside, with a red neon counter increasing every second. Then there’s Peter Campus’s “Three Transitions,” which is a video that seems to show the artist “wiping” away portions of his face and ripping open his own back, only to crawl out of it.
One of the pieces that might be recognizable from billboards is a photograph of two young twin girls standing on a couch beside a creature that resembles Yoda from the Star Wars movies. Lina Bertucci’s “Haim Steinbach, 1988” features Steinbach, a fellow artist, wearing a mask of Yoda, the only oddity in the otherwise-normal photograph. The monochromatic tint adds to the haunting eeriness of the image. 
Ordinary Madness is bizarre. It’s strange. Quite frankly, it’s madness. But who’s to say: Is it anti-art, or art in its purest form?

Midnight Thursday night marks a long-awaited moment for fans of the Harry Potter series, as thousands will attend midnight screenings of Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1. Those who have spent more than a year obsessively stalking MuggleNet.com for press releases, video clips, and photos and visiting sites such as HarryPotterFanFiction.com for their Potter fix, are in a state of frenzied excitement that can only be likened to religious ecstasy. The upcoming two-part film adaptation of the final Harry Potter book, Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows, has prompted more speculation and emotion from fans than the six movies that have preceded it.
The Harry Potter phenomenon is one that has swept millions into the fold. The highest-grossing franchise in history, it has even defined a “Harry Potter Generation” — those who grew up from 1997-2007, the 10-year period during which J.K. Rowling published the seven books which comprise the series. In a manner often likened to that of J.R.R. Tolkien, Rowling has created an entire universe that forms the backdrop for her novels. This includes everything from the fundamental conception of magic to extensive family trees, innumerable spells, and wandlore, and three books detailing a new sport (Quidditch Through the Ages), an entire animal kingdom (Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them), and children’s bedtime tales (The Tales of Beedle the Bard). In a Deathly Hallows interview with The New York Times, screenwriter Steve Kloves commented on this, citing the wealth of information Rowling possesses about the Potter world. “I once e-mailed her and asked her what were the 12 uses of dragon’s blood, and she wrote back in 30 seconds what they all were,” he said.
The seventh book rightly represents the climax of all this knowledge. The 700-plus pages are dense, packed with important details, wonderful characterizations, and intense drama. The desire to justly appreciate and capture the complexity of the novel compelled the films’ director, David Yates, to split the final installment into two parts. Part one covers Harry, Ron, and Hermione’s search for Voldemort’s horcruxes, while part two essentially leads up to the final battle. There are few cast changes for the penultimate film. Well-known British actor Bill Nighy takes on the role of Minister of Magic Rufus Scrimgeour, and despite rumors to the contrary, Emma Thompson and Jason Isaacs reprise their respective roles as Professor Trelawney and Lucius Malfoy. Kloves noted that there are some plot differences between the book and the movie: the audience actually sees Hermione protect her parents by modifying their memories, and Harry’s birthday party is cut. Adjustments such as these, however, can always be expected. Ultimate faithfulness to the narrative is the reason millions of fans will be waiting to judge the film, eager to see whether the film stays true to the book that, for many, was symbolic of the end of an era.

Dr. Dog is coming to Carnegie Mellon on Saturday, courtesy of the Activities Board. These psychedelic rockers are a quintet made up of Toby Leaman, Scott McMicken, Frank McElroy, Zach Miller, and Eric Slick. Dr. Dog isn’t a bar band — some of the popular acts it has toured with include the Raconteurs, My Morning Jacket, The Black Keys, and Wilco. The band has appeared on Late Night with Conan O’Brien and Late Night with Jimmy Fallon. Currently, the group is promoting its latest album, Shame, Shame.
The band is made up of Pennsylvania natives and was formed in Philadelphia. Its first four albums were made in a home studio, an odd attribute that adequately describes each of those albums. While the band may sound at first as if it is a product of the ’60s, it experiments with altering its music beyond the typical guitar/drum/bass combination. The band has the sonic experimentation of the Beatles, the beautiful harmonies of the Beach Boys, and the electrical oddity of Beck.
Carnegie Mellon should prove to be an excellent venue for Dr. Dog, as the band’s psychedelic harmonies and jams will mesh with the small venue. Wiegand Gymnasium is small enough that Leaman and McMicken will be able to directly interact with the crowd, rather than relying on a microphone.
Toothbrush is the most jarring of the band’s albums. Its lo-fi quality sounds as if it was recorded on an answering machine. However, this quality contributes to the album’s charm — and the melodies are so good that the potential downfall turns into a positive attribute. The band members expanded upon these jam-band melodies with We 
All Belong. Lyrically and sonically, they reached the ultimate in sunny-pop. Tracks glisten with happiness, and beats implore the listener to move.
Most recently, the band released Shame, Shame. Speaking about the album, McMicken said in an interview on d.drdogmusic.com that “With our last record [2008’s Fate], there didn’t seem to be the next logical step with the general set of sensibilities and aesthetics that we’d been working from up until that point. It felt like a closed book.” And what an album they released. Shame, Shame is a dramatic shift in focus, and provides the listener a great insight into the massive energy that will come to Pittsburgh this Saturday.
Dr. Dog’s signature style isn’t meant to technically impress. Instead, the band seeks to get the crowd moving. The members employ hooks that are so infectious that they practically beg the listener to dance and be happy. On their tour with the Raconteurs in 2006, the band members nearly outclassed Jack White — a feat that most would deem impossible. There is no better way to celebrate the upcoming Thanksgiving Break than by seeing a band whose aim is to make everyone happy. The concert will be at 8 p.m. this Saturday in Wiegand Gymnasium.

Insomnia
Thursday, Nov. 18
7:30 10 12:30
Insomnia is a 2002 thriller remake of the 1997 Norwegian film by the same name. Al Pacino plays an LAPD detective — has Pacino been playing a detective for the last decade or is it just me? — who assists local police with an investigation into the murder of a young woman. Robin Williams steps out of his comedy comfort zone for a couple hours by playing a creepy crime writer who may be involved in the murder. This smart psychological thriller was well received by critics and moviegoers alike.
Inception
Friday, Nov. 19
7 10 1
Inception was this past year’s big blockbuster to say the least. Hyped for about a full year prior to its release, the movie stars some of the best names in show business today, including Leonardo DiCaprio, Ken Watanabe, Cillian Murphy, and Joseph Gordon-Levitt, to name a few. We follow DiCaprio’s attempt to perform “inception,” wherein a memory is planted into the mind of a man or woman to make them think what you want them to think... I think. The plot may be somewhat confusing, but the movie is worth it. It’s an imaginative piece of cinema from a fantastic director with great casting. Go see it.
Batman Begins
Saturday, Nov. 20
7:30 10 12:30
Before the 2009 blockbuster The Dark Knight, there was Christopher Nolan’s 2005 movie Batman Begins. Starring Christian Bale as Bruce Wayne, the movie documents the origins of Bruce’s Batman persona. After watching his millionaire parents get brutally murdered as a child, Bruce travels the globe to learn about the world of organized crime, and ends up training in Asia with the vigilante group League of Shadows. He returns to his hometown of Gotham City, a cesspool of corruption and fear, to clean up the town and become the kick-butt billionaire superhero we all know and love.
The Prestige
Sunday, Nov. 21
8 10 12
The 2006 drama The Prestige has it all: magic, mystery, romance, and a star-studded cast, including Christian Bale, Hugh Jackman, Scarlett Johansson, and David Bowie. A friendly rivalry between two young magicians soon turns vicious and obsessive as each struggles to top the other’s tricks, sabotaging and spying on one another, until their competition culminates with a violent and tragic end. This beautifully shot film was well received by critics, and the surprise ending will shock even the most careful movie watchers — and even if the magic doesn’t interest you, perhaps the lovely Johansson will.

_The Library Catalogue Music Series _is Sufjan Stevens’ label (Asthmatic Kitty) recently-created series of albums. For those of you who are intrigued by Stevens’ recent electronic compositions, you should know that much of the music in this series is part of the same lush electronic lineage. I highly recommend exploring the series, as it’ll open your ears to the goings-on of Asthmatic Kitty.
One prime example of the diversity of this series is Kristin Miltner’s Music for Dreaming and Playing. For starters, it’s warm, playful, ethereal, and devoid of lyrics. The album is all about mood. If you’re looking for some contemplative touches of digital femininity, pop this album into your CD player.
As the album’s title would suggest, the album has two distinct sections: dreaming and playing. The dreaming portion consists of the first four tracks, while the rest is play of the video game sort. Imagine that you’re listening to little morsels of music that Miltner has created for the soundtrack of some warm and fuzzy indie game, and you’re there.
“Altamont Pass” is the most outstanding track on this album for those looking for an acoustically rich experience.
To describe this song in more lush language: Harmonics pulse in and out, resonating and creating a shroud similar to muted bells. As a listener, you are now wandering through a desert in your dreams where purple and white clouds drip by slowly and the hologram horizon seems to flicker. Harmless ghosts, about your size, their auras tinged with nacreous greens, pass through you. As they pass, you can see clearly into their muted neon robes. They’ve been precisely where you are. They’ve made the journey and they’ve watched you pass.
You are neither hungry, thirsty, lonely, tired, happy, nor sad. You simply are observing.
Hugs and kisses,
Juan

**Dear Hoskins Brothers,
I have a huge man-crush on one of my professors. He's so cool! But he has no idea who I am. Is there any way I can get him to notice me? To say my name? To hang out with me?
Sincerely,
Odds Against Me**
Dear OAM,
Ah yes, the professor crush, a college classic. He’s smart, funny, and when you look into his eyes you get lost for hours. I’ve been there, my friend. The key is to try to spend time with him. For example, go to office hours. If you don’t have any homework or lecture questions, tell him you’ve loved his class and ask what courses he recommends you take next. You could reach the holy grail of professor- student relationships by doing research for him. Read up on his research interests and learn about them beforehand — if you’re knowledgeable and interested, he’ll be more likely to accept.
Or you can just stalk him. It’d be pretty easy to find his address online. Show up at his house and invite yourself in. He won’t mind. When he’s not looking, steal a family photo, Photoshop yourself into it, and then return it to its proper place at a later date. Take every course he offers, even that one-unit course for grad students. Eventually he’ll talk to you, if only to inform you of the restraining order.
Stop staring dreamily at him,
Brian Hoskins
**Dear Hoskins Brothers,
I'm visiting my girlfriend's family for the first time over Thanksgiving. Is this a good idea? Do you have any tips on ingratiating myself?
Sincerely,
Pass the Gravy**
Dear PTG,
Bad move. Thanksgiving is probably the worst time to meet the family. All that stress and fatty food does not make a good time. Her family will be making 10 different dishes, entertaining the kids, keeping the adults liquored up, and interrogating you mercilessly. It’s just too much to handle. Eventually, her mother may snap, yelling, “Dammit! Why am I the only one cooking!?” and waving around the carving knife.
If you’re still going through with it, here are some tips. Offer to set the table. It’s an easy job that will keep you out of the kitchen with all its knife-waving. Depending on the family, you may be asked to lead them in prayer or say what you’re thankful for. My go-to prayer is “Rub-a-dub dub, thanks for the grub. Yeah God!” Say you’re thankful for this beautiful family letting you into their home on this special occasion. That should get you enough brownie points for a second slice of pie.
Don't take a turkey leg unless no one else wants it,
Patrick Hoskins

Recently, many Carnegie Mellon students have expressed concern about how speed bumps will affect the university’s 90-year-old tradition of Sweepstakes. Speed bumps in Schenley Park were suggested as a traffic-calming method at a meeting hosted by the Pittsburgh Parks Conservancy regarding revision of the Pittsburgh Regional Parks Master Plan.
The Pittsburgh Parks Conservancy is a nonprofit organization founded in 1996 to address deteriorating conditions in Pittsburgh’s parks. In 2000, the organization released the Pittsburgh Regional Parks Master Plan, a 20-year blueprint for park restoration and management. 
The plan lays out restoration projects in Frick, Highland, Riverview, and Schenley parks. Now 10 years into the plan, the Pittsburgh Parks Conservancy will be updating and revising the Master Plan after collective input from residents at a series of public meetings.
“We held meetings in each of the four RAD-funded parks: Frick, Highland, Riverview, and Schenley,” said Laura Cook, marketing communications coordinator at the Pittsburgh Park Conservancy.
Attendees at the Schenley Park meeting voiced concerns about traffic around the intersection of Schenley Drive and Panther Hollow Bridge. The current version of the Master Plan calls for an ornamental roundabout to be installed at the intersection. However some attendees at the meeting at Schenley Park, which was held on Oct. 23, have suggested other devices, including speed bumps.
“After discussing these questions, our attendees walked through the park, assessing conditions from Phipps Conservatory to the Panther Hollow Bridge to Frew Street by CMU,” wrote Melissa McMasters, online and community advocacy manager for the Pittsburgh Parks Conservancy, in the organization’s blog. “After witnessing several potential accidents near the Schenley Park Café, it became even more obvious that Schenley Park (with the most roadways cutting through it of any park in our system) has a bit of a car problem.”
Unfortunately, the current Sweepstakes track passes right through that intersection, and some Carnegie Mellon students worry about how any proposed speed calming methods will affect the almost century-old university tradition.
Started in 1920, Sweepstakes is an annual racing competition between fraternities, sororities, and other campus organizations in which teams build small buggies to race down Schenley Drive and Frew Street. Since 1920, the typical buggy vehicle design has evolved into a small, torpedo shape, which minimizes air resistance. The driver usually lies prone inside the vehicle.
While the torpedo design is advantageous because it can reach the speeds of a car, some students predict that the design will pose a serious risk of injury to drivers if speed bumps are installed on the racetrack. “The buggies are going really fast, 30 miles per hour,” said senior material science and engineering major Jane Son, who is a former Sweepstakes mechanic. “If [a buggy] hits a speed bump, it will go flying.”
“Buggies roll very close to the ground and would not be able to roll over the speed bumps. Even if buggies could be redesigned to make this possible, speed bumps would be a painful obstacle for drivers,” said senior mechanical engineering major Laura Gurwitz, who will be driving one of the Student Dormitory Council’s buggies in the spring.
The risks associated with speed bumps might very well make Sweepstakes too dangerous to continue. “Putting speed bumps along the Buggy course would make it impossible to continue the sport,” said Gurwitz. “I think it would be sad to see a 90-year tradition end this way.”
Others are less worried and feel that Sweepstakes can adapt. “We can always modify buggies and put on bigger wheels that would roll over the bumps better, and somehow change buggy to have people re-pushing after the bumps,” said sophomore mechanical engineering major Lauren Milisits, who will be driving for the Sigma Alpha Epsilon fraternity.
Milisits also pointed out how the speed bumps may not even need to be installed within the current Sweepstakes track to calm traffic.
“If getting people to slow down near residential areas is the goal, then you don’t need them down towards the end of Schenley Drive because there aren’t houses there. The houses are all at the top of Schenley Drive and Forbes,” she said. “If the speed bumps are up past Tech Street and not on the buggy course, it’s not really a problem.”
Others at Carnegie Mellon, as well organizations with similar concerns such as the Pittsburgh Vintage Grand Prix, advocate for less intrusive traffic calming devices. “Stop signs and other caution signs can be an effective way to slow down traffic,” said Gurwitz. Removable speed bumps and barriers have also been suggested.
While worries about speed bumps may only grow as Spring Carnival draws closer, Cook stressed how the idea has only been discussed at meetings. 
“The important thing is that there are no proposed changes, only public discussion about ways to calm traffic in the park,” she said.

This past weekend, Carnegie Mellon played host to the annual Asian Student Leadership Conference (ASLC). The ASLC hosted a range of events aimed at promoting unity and involvement among Carnegie Mellon students. The event is a two-day affair, which, according to cmuaslc.org, “incorporates intellectual, social and political discussions about the role of the Asian and Asian-American experience in the United States.”
The conference began three years ago and has grown since its inception. Initially, the Asian Students Association hosted the event. Now, ASLC has a committee unto itself, and the conference has grown to incorporate more people and more of the Asian student organizations on campus. Members of the Asian Student Leadership Conference committee are carefully selected with the intention of creating a leadership group with a range of views and backgrounds. 
Dawn Wang, a senior studying business administration and the student advisor for the ASLC committee, said that the event “brings unity to Asian organizations on campus, where there is some rivalry. We [Asian organizations] are not that united. Yet, the conference shows that there is a lot of commonality with which to create community.”
That community is clearly growing. By last Thursday, at least 200 people had signed up for the conference, compared to the total of 150 last year. The event spanned last Friday and Saturday where initially it was simply a single-day event that included only one keynote address and two breakout sessions.
This year the ASLC featured a range of events, including several keynote speakers, many smaller breakout sessions, and two live performances. One fundamental goal of the conference was to bring an intellectual focal point to November. By bringing in keynote speakers, the ASLC hoped to engage the campus in this exploration.
This year, the program included a keynote address by Suon Cheng, global strategic real estate analysis manager for Google; a keynote address by Wong Fu Productions; and a comedy routine by Ali Wong. 
According to Shernell Smith, the staff advisor for ASLC and coordinator for multicultural and diversity initiatives at Carnegie Mellon, the variety of breakout sessions, such as “Strategies 4 Life” by Timothy Liu and “Silk Screen Festival” by Harish Saluja, allowed the conference to “address lots of aspects of Asian experiences, bridging the walls around one another.”
The emphasis on communication about real issues was fundamental to the events. 
“I didn’t expect [Ali Wong] to be so open about what she was saying, talking about controversial topics such as sex and race. During the Q & A she inspired us to take risks. She could be a role model, because there are not that many Asian comedians who address real issues,” said Sara Lee, a first-year in computer science. “The focus on stuff that actually matters is what made this different,” Lee said of the entire event.
Despite its title, the Asian Student Leadership Conference isn’t just for members of the Asian community. Members of the ASLC committee emphasized that the conference, while dealing with Asian issues, is primarily about leadership. According to Wang, the broader community’s participation is integral. “Asian student organizations, and others, are seen as a side part of student life.... You don’t see their influence every day. This comes from fear, stereotyping, and lack of community among different Asian groups. The conference is important because of those connections,” Wang said.
Among other things, the events of Friday and Saturday clearly drew in a broader swath of students than in previous years. While the conference included many non-Asian and non-undergraduate students, more remarkably, it also included non-Carnegie Mellon students. The inclusion of students from other Pittsburgh schools indicates the direction of the Asian Student Leadership Conference. 
This year, the committee made efforts to include students at other local schools such as Chatham University and Duquesne University.
The hope of the Asian Student Leadership Conference committee, as well as many of the affiliates, is for the conference to grow outside of Carnegie Mellon to become a Pittsburgh event. Other cities already have similar events, where they are able to bring schools together to address the mix of Asian issues that are prevalent today. 
“Pittsburgh is on the cusp of being a place where people could imagine something along those lines,” said Smith.
According to a promotional poster, “The vision is for students to explore issues of race, identity, the modern implications, and inspire students to craft and pursue their dreams.” The success of the event is a strong step in the right direction.

The Carnegie Mellon chapter of the Society of Women Engineers (SWE) received the gold award for “Outstanding Collegiate Section” two weeks ago at the SWE national conference in Orlando, Fla. The Carnegie Mellon SWE chapter was one of only two collegiate sections to receive this recognition for its “outstanding overall program” for the 2009–2010 year.
The highly competitive Outstanding Collegiate Section award was given based on applications submitted by each chapter. 
The application assessed several important focuses of a SWE collegiate chapter, including outreach, professional excellence, and diversity. Applicants were judged based on these criteria as a measure of the chapters’ ability to meet SWE’s strategic priorities.
Sixteen women from Carnegie Mellon attended the SWE national conference in Orlando to receive the award. Among them was senior electrical and computer engineering major Rachael Harding, president of Carnegie Mellon’s SWE chapter.
According to Harding, several things contributed to Carnegie Mellon’s SWE chapter’s recognition. Two of them are the annual High School Day and Middle School Day events, which expose high school and middle school girls to different fields of study within engineering.
“SWE has expanded its high school and middle school programs.... This past year we were able to really focus on these girls. We stood out because we’ve been expanding this program to include more women,” Harding said. “We also stand out because of our professional development.... The breadth of people we were able to get as speakers last year, and how it impacted our members, stood out.”
Harding also reflected on the opportunities that SWE members have to organize professional events such as the annual Technical Opportunities Conference (TOC). “I think that really makes our section outstanding, and it produces outstanding women.”
“I think for our SWE section it [the award] means that we are doing stuff right,” Harding continued. “We’re being successful, and we’re being recognized for that on this international stage. That’s exciting because sometimes members lose their motivation, the higher goal. ‘Why are we doing all this outreach? Why so much professional development...?’ So to have this pinnacle, this plaque, to show this award, shows everything we do culminates and integrates together to meet this mission. It’s more symbolic of our success. I think in a way this is going to inspire us to keep doing professionally managed events in the future.”
Also in attendance at the SWE national conference Nov. 4–6 was senior electrical and computer engineering major Michelle Stolwyk, the Carnegie Mellon chapter secretary. “Getting this recognition is a big deal. It lets us know we are doing the right thing,” she said.
Stolwyk shared what SWE has meant to her as a member throughout her undergraduate years at Carnegie Mellon. 
“I was completely lost as a freshman, and now I feel like I could navigate the waters of the professional life, thanks to SWE’s professional development.”
She also recommends SWE involvement for any woman in CIT. 
“There are so many things that SWE does. Even if you are not interested in professional development, there is other stuff too: mentoring, service opportunities. We have so many types of events that there is something to offer for absolutely everyone.”
Sophomore Zeinab Mohamed, a chemical engineering and biomedical engineering double major, is currently the SWE community service chair. 
She said that attending the SWE national conference in Orlando “was a great, enriching experience. We had lots of great opportunities to network. It was also my first time to Orlando — it was wonderful.”
Harding also praised her chapter. “Our SWE members are really sought after in the industry because we’re so well-rounded; we have all this exposure to professional development, [and] we’re very active in the community, which is something that companies also look for. We come from Carnegie Mellon, so we have a lot of the depth. We’re really well prepared for going out into the real world after university.”

Halloween may be officially over, but pumpkin season is still in full swing. CulinArt, along with co-sponsorship from Lipton Brisk Ice Tea and Carnegie Mellon’s AB Concerts, will introduce a new annual event, the Pumpkin Olympics, to campus on Saturday. It is scheduled to take place in Donner Ditch from 2-4 p.m., followed by free pizza for all participants in Tartans Pavilion.
Shelby Cole, student activities director for CulinArt, initiated the idea and creation of the Pumpkin Olympics. “The idea for the Pumpkin Olympics was my brainchild. When I initially pitched this to my superiors, it was going to be the ‘Turkey Olympics,’ being so close to the holiday season. We didn’t want to offend anyone, so we decided to do the event with pumpkins instead,” said Cole.
The Pumpkin Olympics will have three main events centered on the infamous squash: bowling, relay races, and catapulting. These games were designed in response to students’ assumption that pumpkins only have limited uses and that, once Halloween is over, they are irrelevant and no longer of much use. However, all of the games created for the Pumpkin Olympics go beyond the traditional uses of pumpkins for carving and eating. 
As the bowling, relay race, and catapulting events imply, pumpkins can be used as the object for a multitude of entertaining games in which they are smashed or thrown. More importantly, the event was created to allow students to relieve stress before finals week and to simply have fun. Cole further stated that “we are not only trying to provide students with quality food, but also provide them with events that will allow them the opportunity to break away from studying and blow off some steam and enjoy the college experience.” CulinArt hopes that the Pumpkin Olympics will become a favorite Carnegie Mellon tradition to relieve stress before finals, in addition to the already famous annual primal scream by the Fence.
Even though the event has not yet occurred, it has already garnered attention. Will Pettijohn-Hernandez, a senior fine arts and creating writing major, said, “Two words: Pumpkin catapult. I know I don’t need to say more, but a bunch of games based on a squash sounds pretty ridiculous and very entertaining. Halloween never gets the credit it deserves in Pittsburgh when it goes from summer straight to winter; we go from Halloween to Christmas. Punctuating the season with gratuitous amounts of pumpkins helps us take back the month of November.”
Not only will the Pumpkin Olympics offer a healthy means to relieve stress and offer students a chance to re-evaluate the use of pumpkins, but the team that scores the most points in the three events will receive a $100 cash prize, four backstage passes to Saturday’s Dr. Dog concert, and a Lipton Brisk Ice Tea prize pack. The concert, hosted by AB Concerts, will be held on the same day at 8 p.m. in the Weigand Gymnasium in the University Center.
In anticipation of the event, Anne Dirkes, a sophomore mechanical engineering major, said, “I’m really excited for Pumpkin Olympics. This is something that I think a lot of students can get into and have a lot of fun with. I especially can’t wait for the catapult event and seeing pumpkins hurled across Donner Ditch!”
Pre-registration is required to participate in the Pumpkin Olympics. The event is limited to the first 25 teams of four that pre-register. Students can pre-register by emailing Shelby Cole (scole@andrew.cmu.edu with their team name and all of the names of their team members.

Undergraduate programs now open to Indian scholars
Although Carnegie Mellon has an existing partnership with India’s Shiv Nadar Foundation to provide graduate-level education through a program in advanced software engineering, the university will soon use this partnership to make undergraduate programs in mechanical engineering and electrical and computer engineering available to Indian students.
Under the intended program, the first class of undergraduates will begin studies in June 2011. Accepted students will study in India at Sri Sivasubramaniya Nadar (SSN) institutions sponsored by the Shiv Nadar Foundation. The students will follow a curriculum designed by Carnegie Mellon and taught by SSN faculty trained at Carnegie Mellon. In addition to their studies in India, students will also study at Carnegie Mellon’s main Pittsburgh campus. According to the university, admission and academic processes will have the same rigorous standards that are in effect on Carnegie Mellon’s Pittsburgh and Qatar campuses.
“India’s engineers constitute a large proportion of key scientific and research establishments worldwide,” Carnegie Mellon President Jared L. Cohon said according to a university press release. “This new alliance enables Carnegie Mellon University and the Shiv Nadar Foundation a chance to offer India’s students a distinctive edge and international recognition.”
Video aims to encourage better choices towards sex
Julie Downs, an assistant research professor in the department of social and decision sciences, has recently received a $7.4 million grant from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. The grant funding will be distributed across five years, as Downs produces a sequel to a previous DVD she created to discourage sexually transmitted diseases and pregnancy among young females. Downs’ first video was titled “What Could You Do?” and was proven to increase abstinence for teenage girls.
“Our goal is to create a tool that will help teenagers make better decisions for themselves,” Downs said. “For the most part they don’t want to get pregnant. They definitely don’t want to contract a disease. By building on our research about what goes into their decisions, we can craft something that will be exactly what they need to avoid these negative outcomes.”
“I’m delighted to see such a strong funding endorsement of the application of quality behavioral decision research to the design and testing of key interventions,” said John Miller, the head of Carnegie Mellon’s department of social and decision sciences.
The new video is intended to help teenage girls make better decisions regarding sexual activity, as well as lower the costs of teenage pregnancies and disease treatment for health care agencies.

Last week, the FDA released 36 proposed covers for cigarette packs with intentionally graphic pictures and threatening captions in hopes of dissuading smokers from continuing the unhealthy habit. Even though the effects of smoking are widely known, the cigarette business is still a multi-billion dollar industry. Here are some statistics about the habit:
Smokers in the world today: 1.1 billion
Estimated number of smokers by the year 2025: 1.6 billion
Number of cigarettes purchased each minute in the world: 10 million
Milligrams of nicotine in an average cigarette: 8

This past Saturday, the Burmese ruling military government released pro-democracy leader and Nobel laureate Daw Aung Sang Suu Kyi from house arrest. The 65-year-old woman has spent most of the last 20 years in some form of detention because of her efforts to bring democracy to military-ruled Burma.
In 1991, a year after her National League for Democracy (NLD) political party won an overwhelming victory in an election that the military junta later ignored, Suu Kyi was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize. Despite her imprisonment, she remained a symbol of democracy and freedom for her country’s people.
While Suu Kyi’s release is certainly an event worth celebrating, the fact that it has come just days after last week’s election, which was widely agreed to be a sham — and that it follows a decades-long history of political oppression and systematic genocide of ethnic minorities — makes it only a small step toward an improved situation for much of the Burmese population. 
Suu Kyi’s release has been widely accepted as a result of an increased feeling of security on the part of the military government. A BBC correspondent in Rangoon said Saturday that “it is unlikely the ruling generals would have freed Ms. Suu Kyi unless they felt confident she no longer represented a threat to them or their plans for the country.”
Burmese media has widely reported that last week’s election resulted in a secure position in both the People’s Assembly and House of Nationalities for the military-backed Union Solidarity and Development Party. However, even before the official vote, election laws reserved a quarter of seats in these two chambers of parliament for the military. Any constitutional change will require a majority of more than 75 percent, meaning the military would retain veto power regardless of election results. On the other hand, the NLD refused to participate in, or contest the results of, the election. Many had hoped the NLD would gain a majority of votes, mirroring the country’s last election in 1990. However, election laws forced the group to disband and relinquish its status as a political entity, which, by extension, stripped Suu Kyi of her previous role as party leader.
Furthermore, until she was released, Suu Kyi represented only one of over 2,200 other individuals, according to Amnesty International, who remain imprisoned by the junta for political reasons. Amnesty International said such prisoners “were being held in grim conditions, with inadequate food and sanitation. Many were in poor health and without access to proper medical treatment and had suffered torture during their initial detention.”
The release of Suu Kyi deserves celebration, but it is primarily a public relations move by an illegal government attempting to appease the greater international community and distract attention from an obviously unfair election. Her release was not brought about by any sort of political process and was certainly not representative of a shift in policy or practice. These are key issues to remember, and while we celebrate with Aung San Suu Kyi, we must be careful not to be complacent with the current government.

San Francisco’s Board of Supervisors, a governing body similar to a city council, voted 8–3 last week to enact “Healthy Meal Legislation,” which restricts toy giveaways with any kind of purchased meal.
The legislation proposed by the board would, according to www.gizmodo.com, require the meal to contain fewer than 600 calories, have at least half a cup of vegetables, and meet sodium limits and a multigrain requirement. In addition, less than 35 percent of the calories in the meal can come from fat, excluding nuts, nut butters, and low-fat cheeses, and breakfast meals may offer half a cup of fruit instead of vegetables.
This legislation is in line with San Francisco’s recent campaign to fight obesity, particularly childhood obesity, using methods such as Shape Up San Francisco, a program to reduce chronic diseases that can be prevented with proper physical activity; Soda Free Summer, a program to encourage the substitution of high-calorie soft drinks with water, milk, and other healthier drinks; and Sunday Streets, a series of block-party-like events to promote walking and physical fitness instead of driving with free events like yoga, tai chi, and rock climbing.
However, all of the aforementioned programs offer incentives to participating individuals, unlike the Healthy Meal Legislation, which seems to favor the stick over the carrot. Though the health risks of obesity are well documented, this legislation is still seen by some as needless. Although I agree with San Francisco Mayor Gavin Newsom when he says “Parents, not politicians, should decide what their children eat,” I also believe we can draw an easy parallel between the obesity problem and another problem that is now acknowledged by the public: smoking.
In 1964, the surgeon general of the United States released the Surgeon General’s Advisory Committee Report on Smoking and Health, a document based on, according to Wikipedia, over 7,000 articles that linked smoking and tobacco use with cancer and other diseases. Shortly thereafter, legislation was enacted that forbade advertisements that obviously targeted children and required warning labels on packaging. In particular, the “Joe Camel” campaign was the subject of a class-action lawsuit, and Camel, the company behind the campaign, was pressured to end the campaign by the Federal Trade Commission, the U.S. Congress, and various anti-smoking groups. In addition, the Motion Picture Association of America is authorized to give a film that glamorizes smoking outside of a mitigating context a more restricted rating.
This response has contributed to a massive decline in the number of individuals smoking in the United States. In 2009, 20.6 percent of adults aged 18 years and older reported being current smokers, which is a dramatic decline from the 40 percent reported in 1965, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Though this is an accomplishment to be proud of, obesity has increased from between 10 and 14 percent in 1985 to 33.8 percent in 2009, according to the CDC.
This massive rise in obesity has come during a period in which the detrimental effects of obesity are being discovered. According to a RAND Corporation brief published in 2002, obese individuals suffer from a 67 percent increase in chronic conditions, while smokers suffer from only a 25 percent increase.
Though my initial reaction was to dismiss San Francisco’s legislation against unhealthy meals including toys and to support Mayor Newsom’s veto, after some analysis, it seems to me that advertising Happy Meals in their current state to children despite the known risks is not much different from advertising smoking to children, and I support San Francisco’s attempt to remove the “lure” of a toy from obviously unhealthy meal choices for its citizens. However, I also agree with Mayor Newsom’s support of programs that encourage health education, as the same children must be educated about healthy eating since their parents will not always determine their food choices.

As one of the top universities in the world, Carnegie Mellon has many things to be proud of. Its professors conduct groundbreaking research, and it draws the brightest students from countries across the globe. With this kind of success, though, it is easy to be more than a little arrogant. That is how we see Carnegie Mellon’s recent marketing campaign, “Brag a little.” This campaign offers free decals to students to declare their school pride. According to the campaign webpage at www.cmu.edu/bragcmu1, the goal is to “get the conversation started. Let the world know what university you call home.”
As much as building an effective brand is important for Carnegie Mellon’s future, we question if bragging is truly the direction this branding should take. There are plenty of ways to promote our university in a constructive tone. 
In fact, the current campaign has examples of this. Two of the three bumper stickers and decals that are offered celebrate Carnegie Mellon culture: “Got my kilt on” and “My other car is a buggy.” This is the kind of branding we like to see. It recognizes Carnegie Mellon as an experience.
It is the presentation of this campaign that bothers us. By bragging about Carnegie Mellon, we prioritize external recognition: Nobel prizes, prestigious awards, high paychecks. The third item offered is a “Future Nobel” magnet. Unlike the other two choices, this does not promote the university’s uniqueness. Instead, it makes us seem pretentious. Carnegie Mellon’s culture is worth celebrating and spreading, but bragging is not the right way to do it.
Editorial Dissent
Shweta Suresh
Carnegie Mellon is a fantastic institution; and if we put a magnet or stick a window decal on our cars to declare this, are we really being too proud? 
I don’t think so. 
Our university has been criticized for not having enough school pride — and although it may not seem like much, I think that displaying our school spirit in small ways can help improve that situation. I think this is a great first step in asking students to express their love for Carnegie Mellon. 
More expression on the students’ part means more realization of how the university has impacted their lives, and a higher chance that they will give back in the future.

A couple that had been in pirate captivity for more than a year was released last Sunday, reportedly after paying $750,000 in ransom. Piracy has been increasingly problematic in recent years, particularly in the area around the Horn of Africa. Navies from countries around the world have been dispatched to fight piracy and protect shipping. 
However, most of these efforts have been and will continue to be ineffective. Piracy is no longer the domain of deserters and renegades, which were largely eliminated in the Atlantic and Caribbean centuries ago. Instead, it has become an advanced and developed business plan. Old methods of fighting piracy will not work against these high-tech criminals.
Most pirates in the Indian Ocean and Gulf of Aden are of Somali origin. Somalia is a failed state with a virtually nonexistent government. The average Somali family lives on about $500 per year. In such an environment, piracy is an occupation with high payout and not unreasonable risk. An attack leader makes about $15,000, according to an NPR investigative report. The operations are normally funded by Somalis living outside the country, who reap the majority of the payout.
In this business environment, stopping individual attacks is completely ineffective. The only true way to discourage piracy is to punish the outside investors and stabilize Somalia and neighboring countries. These are enormous tasks, and they will require much more planning than simply sending a fleet to intercept hostile vessels. 
The small risk of capture for a Somali pirate pales in comparison to the ability to feed his family. The few times a hijacking makes the news, it is typically due to a rescue attempt, such as when the U.S. Navy took back the Maersk Alabama in 2009. But the majority of hijackings go unnoticed. The ransom is paid, the hostages are returned safely, and nobody gets hurt.
Modern piracy is not the cruel world of Blackbeard or the inventive one of Jack Sparrow. It has order and planning, and stopping it requires a reasoned response. Instead of sending ships to Somalia, we should be working with the nations of the world to lift that country out of poverty and give its citizens a better choice.

Campus meal plans are a waste of money. Required for first-years, presumably strictly for Carnegie Mellon’s economic benefit, the meal plans have little to offer for anyone else. A fixed number of meals that do not roll over after each two-week period, inflexibility in choosing meal components, and other rigid rules are all frustrating, but most damning to the meal plan is the fact that most plans actually cost more than the sum of their individual meals.
Take the popular Red Plan, for instance, with 22 meals per two-week period. Assuming that each meal is worth $8 — actually an inflated number as shown by a cursory look at the actual posted prices of most common meals — and accounting for 11 meals for each of the 16 weeks of the first semester of this year, the Red Plan’s cost (not including flexible dollars) is over $200 more than the actual value of the meals. Even the first Green Plan, which requires that one consume 38 meals every two weeks, has a value more than $50 below its cost by the same metric. This is unacceptable.
The food available on campus cannot generally be described as bad, but perhaps “underwhelming” is an apt characterization. Dining options provided by local companies are frequently good but invariable, and the recent adoption of CulinArt as the primary provider for dining services has also brought little substantive change. CulinArt’s food is mostly practical, if lacking in variety. None of the dining locations managed by CulinArt extend far beyond the comfortable sphere of standard grilled or deli food, and they provide very little in the way of ethnic diversity — the one Asian-themed location from CulinArt, Stir Crazy, silently vanished over the summer, and the promise of a new Asian location “opening later in the year” has yet to materialize.
Also highly questionable is the recent “meatless Mondays” initiative, seemingly an attempt to further Carnegie Mellon’s environmentally conscious image. Having myself at one point attempted to avoid meat one day a week, I can attest to the difficulty involved in such an endeavor. I have since converted to actual vegetarianism, which has proved to be far easier. For the majority of the campus community, which presumably has no such ambitions, I imagine the initiative will go largely ignored. I do, however, give Dining Services credit for providing vegetarian options. Almost every dining location offers multiple vegetarian meals, and most offer vegan options as well.
I hope that CulinArt and Dining Services continue to improve their service and products. Their first step should be making dining plans fair and economically sensible.

In his Nov. 8 Forum article, “Obama’s shellacking leads to word’s revival,” Patrick Gage Kelley explained that President Obama’s renewed responsibility to the populace is to not only push his legislation, but to sell it — and, I would add, to get young voters to sell it, too.
Since leaving Carnegie Mellon and moving to Washington, D.C. to work for the federal government, I’ve come to feel overwhelmed by a constant shellacking of elected officials, and the joy seemingly felt by those doing the shellacking. That is, the sheer number of current politicians, hopeful politicians, former politicians, and political hangers-on clouds the discourse of this pseudo-Southern city. They fill it with so much language, and often so little action, that it is difficult to assume the entire citizenship of the nation — not just its president — has not been shellacked.
As Kelley noted, President Obama blamed himself for the Democrats’ “shellacking” following the midterm elections and the Republican resurgence in the House. In an interview with 60 Minutes, the president backhandedly complimented himself, acknowledging that his administration over the past two years has done too much of the doing, and not enough of the talking, for the likes of Washington. In a way, he is right, as Kelley explains — a president whose 2008 campaign was so well executed and carefully articulated should have understood the need to consistently clarify the tone and language of his legislative actions since taking office.
Despite low voter turnout rates and a supposed return of young voter apathy, I believe young, politically active, or otherwise socially aware voters are tuned in to what is happening in the political realm. Whether you still wear your worn-out “Yes We Can” T-shirt to yoga on Saturdays or are considering naming your first-born child Rand, you, as members of the Carnegie Mellon community, are not shrouded in the constant shellacking of the Washington anti-activism community, and I implore you to take advantage of that fact.
It is evident that fringe groups, not necessarily political but indeed controversial in nature, will play an increasingly prominent role in the 2012 elections — so get involved early. If you have a penchant for preserving marine ecosystems on the West Coast, reach out to Save the Bay and donate your talents, even from Pittsburgh. If you believe women’s rights may have been compromised by the election of anti-choice representatives, ask Planned Parenthood where they could use volunteers. No matter what you believe, and on what side of the political divide you fall, don’t let defeat be part of your vocabulary — and proactively ensure you will not be on the receiving end of the shellacking in two years.

India has become Carnegie Mellon’s latest target for global expansion. Last week, the university entered into a partnership with the Shiv Nadar Foundation in India that allows undergraduate students to study in India based on a curriculum developed at Carnegie Mellon. Currently, the program is open to students studying mechanical engineering or electrical and computer engineering. The classes will be taught at the SSN College of Engineering in India by faculty trained at Carnegie Mellon.
As with all of Carnegie Mellon’s previous moves at creating a more global campus, this expansion has a number of benefits, and we applaud the university for taking this step. Indian students who normally would not be able to afford a foreign education will be able to receive high-quality education at a more affordable price. On the other hand, students in Pittsburgh who wish to later on work for companies in India or venture into a more global market after graduation will also benefit from interacting with faculty and students in India.
Although the vision that the creators of this program have in mind is great, we fear that it may not be as successful as hoped. The program has ambitious goals — it will start next June with around 10 to 15 students and, by the end of five years, the university wishes to have up to 100 students enrolled in India. According to President Cohon's Aug. 24 campus-wide e-mail, Carnegie Mellon is having trouble finding enough students for its programs in Australia. The same e-mail announced that the CIT degree in Greece will be suspended due to low enrollment. Similar problems could crop up in India, and this would severely limit the usefulness of the program.
A Carnegie Mellon location in India would be extremely useful for students in Pittsburgh as well as those in India, and we hope that the university takes sufficient efforts to attract enough students to the program. The university should learn from its experiences in Australia and Greece, and make sure that enough students want to enroll in the program for it to be sustainable for many years.
Editor's Note: This article was updated Nov. 16, 2010 to correct a factual error. The Heinz College program in Australia is not being suspended.
