All it took was a block at the buzzer to secure a victory for the Tartans.
First-year Chris Manoli blocked the potential game-winning basket by the 13th-ranked Brandeis Judges with less than three seconds in the game, ending the battle at a score of 53–52 and giving the Tartans their fourth win of the season for a record of 4–8 overall and 1–1 in UAA. The game ended an 11-game win streak for the Judges, providing them with their season’s first loss.
The beginning of the first period was controlled by Brandeis, as the Tartans’ cold shooting performance led to a 21–13 deficit.  The Tartans missed seven straight field goal attempts in that period.
But the Tartans would gain momentum, tying the score at 29–29 with 2:25 left in the half.  The run was led by an offensive burst from the tremendously versatile Manoli, who hit two consecutive field goals during the run that led to the tie score.
After one half, the score was 34–31 in favor of the Brandeis Judges.  It was a three-point shoot-out through one half of play, as both teams shot at an alarming rate from a distance.
The Tartans came out of the locker room re-energized after the half. They opened up a 12–3 run. With 7:12 left in the game, the Tartans held their largest lead, 46–38. But it was a strong defensive front during a 12-minute stretch that allowed the Tartans to build this momentum, where the Judges were held without a field goal.  
After two free throws by junior Joe Kromka, the Judges made a run, outlasting the Tartans over the next six minutes, 12–4, tying the game at 50 with less than a minute remaining.  
In the waning moments of the game, junior John Duhring assisted senior Shane Rife in transition to give the Tartans the lead.
That lead was quickly eliminated by the Judges’ Tyrone Hughes, who hit two free throws to tie the game at 52 with just 33.6 seconds remaining.
On the Tartans’ final possession, Manoli was fouled and converted just one of two free throws.  He would make up for the miss with a clutch defensive play.
With the score now 53–52 Tartans, the Judges held the ball for the final possession. Ben Bartoldus of the Judges curled to the elbow for the potential game-winning shot with less than three seconds in the game, and Manoli stepped up to block the shot, ending the game and securing the victory for the Tartans.
Defense was the key in this victory, as it took every ounce of hustle on the defensive side of the ball to upset the No. 13 Brandeis Judges. The Tartans out-rebounded the Judges, 39–36, and a clutch defensive play by Manoli ensured a Tartan victory in the final moments of the game.
“Our effort on the defensive end was the difference for us in a big game like this,” first-year Sean Brophy said.
The superb perimeter shooting and balanced offensive attack also furnished the victory, as Manoli, Rife, and first-year Rashaun Riley all led the Tartans in scoring with 10 points each.
The Tartans also hosted New York University yesterday at noon.

The Carnegie Mellon women’s basketball team fell three points short to UAA rival Brandeis University on Friday, losing to the visiting Judges 65–62. The Tartans fell to 2–11 on the season and are 0–2 in UAA play.
During the first half, it was apparent that the Tartans had taken their game up a notch, and Carnegie Mellon held the lead at halftime for the first time in six years. Junior Jennifer Larsen stepped up and scored for the Tartans on their first possession, starting a personal hot streak that ended with 10 points in the first half, including a three-pointer. Junior Nicole Vaccarella added to the Tartans’ lead with a three-point basket of her own in the first half. However, Brandeis took a run at the Tartans and went on an 8–2 streak to end the half, putting their deficit at 32–26.
At the start of the second half, the Judges picked up right where they had left off after their eight-point run. The Judges came out and took control of the floor, starting off with 11 points while only allowing the Tartans two, giving Brandeis a 37–34 lead. The Tartans pushed forward with a free throw by Vaccarella and two fast break layups by first-year Jacquie Shaw. Both, however, were answered with nine points by the Judges. The Judges finished the game making six out of eight free throws in the last minute.
Overall, the Tartans saw outstanding performances from Vaccarella and sophomore Emily Peel, who each came up with 14 points. Peel had another double-double this game when she scored 11 rebounds as well.
Despite the loss, the game was all about fighting for the Tartans, who played without this year’s top scorer, junior Jacki Cortese. “I think everyone played together with a lot of intensity; it was especially great to see on the defensive end,” Peel said.
The Tartans had big shoes to fill and proved that they could all elevate their game. “The way we played that game showed every team in the UAA that we can compete with everyone and beat anyone,” continued Peel.
The Tartans secured their first conference win when they played host to UAA rival New York University yesterday at 2 p.m.

The men’s and women’s swimming and diving teams hosted Kenyon College and Allegheny College last Saturday. Both the men’s and women’s teams fell to Kenyon but topped Allegheny in the tri-meet. It was the Tartans’ first competition since returning from their winter training trip to Miami, Fla., and the team’s hard work led to some impressive performances.
The Tartan women got impressive all-around performances from first-year Soleil Phan and senior Molly Evans, who were both part of Carnegie Mellon’s winning 200-yard medley relay along with sophomore Breanna Stillo and senior Brianne Burton. Phan also finished second in the 200 freestyle with a time of 1:56.79, and she overtook Kenyon’s Kati Meirs in the final lap of the 500 freestyle to finish third with an in-season time of 5:09.07. Evans finished second in the 100-yard backstroke and won the 200 back, but her best performance came in the 400 IM, when she won the event and broke her own 2009 pool record with a time of 4:29.44.
The top performer for the men was senior Alex Hanson. Hanson, a three-time participant at the NCAA Championships and a 2010 All-American, finished second in both the 200 free and the 200 breaststroke, going an in-season best 2:11.31 in the latter event. Like Evans, Hanson’s top performance was also in the 400 IM. Hanson won and, not to be outdone by his female counterpart, broke the men’s nine-year-old pool record in the event with a time of 4:06.51.
The Tartans will host another tri-meet this Saturday. The meet against Westminster College and SUNY Geneseo will mark the senior swimmers’ final career home meet. The meet will be at the University Center pool starting at 1 p.m.

As the current team leader in points scored, field goals, and rebounds for the women’s basketball team, center Emily Peel is making Carnegie Mellon history. Just last week, Peel recorded a double-double against UAA opponent Brandeis University, and she helped the Tartans pull off a near-upset before falling 65–62.
Although the team is still young with a large first-year and sophomore base, Peel said the past two games against Case Western Reserve University and Brandeis have shown significant improvement from the beginning of the season, as the team gains more experience and plays together more. 
“We’re playing with good intensity and it’s exciting. I score a good amount, but it wouldn’t happen without the help of my teammates,” Peel said. “It’s good this year because we have such a big bench and so many good and talented players, and I know it’s going to click soon.” 
Peel is a native of Long Valley, N.J., and is majoring in decision science. Like most athletes who chose to go plaid because of the university’s strong academics and athletics, Peel was drawn to Carnegie Mellon because of its programs, a great team, and the city of Pittsburgh, where she was born before moving to New Jersey. 
Peel has her mind set on working in the health field one day and plans to pick up a second major in policy management or business before hopefully completing a master’s in health and public policy at the Heinz College.
Although Peel entered Carnegie Mellon as a biology major wanting a career in medicine, she switched over after realizing one doesn’t have to be a doctor to be in a health-related field. Her ultimate goal is to help prevent diseases, get awareness out about health concerns, and help people in general.
When not in class or on the court, Peel enjoys spending time with her friends on the team and dedicates her time to the Student Athlete Advisory Committee. 
As for the future of the team, Peel is optimistic about the coming years. “I definitely have seen tons of improvement over the season, and the chemistry is building between players,” she said. “It’s been awesome how phenomenal everyone has been playing. We’ve played two tough teams so far and we’ve kept up with them. There are five freshmen and four sophomores this year, and although the sophomores are a little older, we don’t have that much experience. But the more experience we get, the better we should do.”

With the arrival of the new year come the most exciting weeks in all of sports: the NFL playoffs. Twelve teams enter the tournament, and only one comes out alive. This is where a handful of games can separate you from being a first-round loser and being the Super Bowl champion. What makes the NFL playoffs better than any others is, first and foremost, the format. Any team, no matter how good it is, can come out flat in one game and be demoted to watching the Super Bowl on the couch with a bucket of popcorn.
The 2011 playoffs have already gotten off to a great start with last week's wildcard weekend. In the first NFC wildcard game, the 7–9 Seattle Seahawks hosted the defending champion New Orleans Saints, who were heavily favored to dominate the game. Despite being the first losing team to ever make the playoffs, Seattle was able to win its division and secure home field advantage, and that's exactly what it was. Earlier in the season, Seattle went to New Orleans and got demolished by a score of 34–19. However, the Seahawks play their home games at Qwest Field, known for its unsurpassed crowd noise and for the fans’ ability to cause unnecessary false starts for the visiting team. Of course, no one gave the Seahawks much of a chance anyway, considering they could only muster seven wins throughout the regular season, and those who wrote them off were definitely shocked. In a game where they were the underdogs by over nine points, the Seahawks won by a score of 41–36, highlighted by Marshawn Lynch’s inhuman run of over 50 yards that featured an extraordinary seven broken tackles. Many consider it to be the greatest run in postseason history.
Later that Saturday, the underdog New York Jets went on to defeat the perennial Super Bowl contender Indianapolis Colts and Peyton Manning on the road in a thrilling 17–16 victory. This game was only the second time a playoff game was ever decided on a “do-or-die” field goal in the final seconds. New York Jets kicker Nick Folk, who had a shaky season this year, pounded in a 32-yard field goal as time expired to vault the Jets into a rematch with their hated rival, the New England Patriots.
The second day of wildcard weekend was a bit less exciting, as the Baltimore Ravens showcased their trademark defense as they manhandled the Kansas City Chiefs on the road. In the second NFC game, the upstart Green Bay Packers headed into Philadelphia to try and end Michael Vick’s magical comeback season. In a game mostly dominated by the Packers, cornerback Tramon Williams of the Packers intercepted a last-minute pass by Vick in the end zone to win it for Green Bay. However, with Baltimore and Green Bay joining New York and Seattle in the divisional rounds, fans got what they wanted, with all four playoff matchups featuring rematches between the two teams.
So, what else makes the NFL playoffs so great? First off, the intensity of the players seems to rise as postseason football hits. One fact many casual fans do not know is that NFL players get a $21,000 game check for each playoff game, which is almost 10 times less than what the average player makes each week of the regular season. Also, stars like Tom Brady end up making the same amount as the last guy on the bench, making the NFL playoffs the ultimate team sport. Everyone is in it to win it all, and money is not a factor. Secondly, with this added intensity, rivalries appear and bad blood fuels a whole week of anticipation. Take the two AFC matchups this week, for example. The Baltimore Ravens and Pittsburgh Steelers, both members of the AFC North, have one of the greatest rivalries in the NFL. These two teams hate each other to the core, as seen by one of Baltimore linebacker Terrell Suggs’ wardrobe choices this week. Suggs sported a “Hey Pittsburgh, F*** You!” shirt, further increasing the tension of this battle that ended with a Pittsburgh comeback victory that had all the excitement it was supposed to. In the other AFC matchup, the Jets faced the New England Patriots, and I’m not sure there has ever been that much trash talk for a game in the history of sports.
Lastly, the NFL playoffs can almost never be predicted correctly. The Seahawks' victory over the Saints was a great example of how much variance there is in the NFL. The underdog is never a given loss, as shown by the 2007 New York Giants winning the Super Bowl over the then-18–0 Patriots in one of the greatest upsets in football history. No matter what, the playoffs will give you great games, and no team is ever going to give up.
So sit back and enjoy the NFL playoff ride, as you may not even get a season next year considering the potential lockout. I expect these next few games to live up to the hype and create one of the best NFL postseasons in recent memory.

Valentine’s Day is exactly four weeks from now and folks, there’s no need to buy any gifts this year. It just so happens that Major League Baseball has already taken care of that for us. Sure, you and your hubby can spend a romantic dinner together, maybe even see a movie. But then you can go home and revel in the joy that this Feb. 14 is the day pitchers and catchers report to officially begin spring training. If that’s not enough of a gift for you, then maybe plane tickets to Florida and/or Arizona would seal the deal.
Speaking of deals, this off-season has been chock full of ’em. Perhaps most notably, Cliff Lee spurned the Yankees and surprised everyone by signing with the Philadelphia Phillies — yes, the same Phillies that traded him for Roy Halladay only a year ago and then acquired Roy Oswalt at the deadline. Although all three could be the standout aces of any major league staff, they instead find themselves joined by Cole Hamels in the most formidable rotation in baseball. Is Halladay-Lee-Oswalt going to match Smoltz-Maddux-Glavine in dominance and sheer intimidation? No. Hudson-Zito-Mulder? Maybe. The latter trio was totally homegrown in the A’s system, which made them all the more likable, especially when the A’s starters won 15 games during the team’s 20-game win streak in 2002. While the Braves’ trio was not as technically homegrown — Smoltz came in a Ryan-Fergosi-esque deal from the Tigers and Maddux had already established himself with the Cubs — by the time the trio was finished pitching in Atlanta, they’d certainly become household names. No doubt all three will go into the Hall of Fame donning Braves caps. Give Halladay, Lee, and Oswalt another five years together and maybe the comparisons will start to flow a little more easily.
The Phillies have not been the only big winners this offseason. Until the Lee deal, the Boston Red Sox were — and still should be — considered the big winners of the off-season. Within a week, the Sox traded for first baseman Adrian Gonzalez and signed the Yankees’ second-most coveted free agent, left fielder Carl Crawford. Gonzalez, especially playing in Fenway Park, could become the best first baseman in the game, even surpassing that guy Albert on the Cardinals. His fielding is already second to none, and his opposite-field stroke will no doubt benefit from a short porch in left. Crawford — whom the Yankees really didn’t need, so much as want — gives the Red Sox a legitimate speedster who can play any outfield position better than who they have already and who will no doubt benefit from a short porch in right. More importantly — knock on wood — Crawford has done a pretty good job of staying healthy over his career, which is more than Boston can say for most of its roster, and especially its outfield. With Crawford and Gonzalez in tow and leading the charge, the Sox are easy favorites to win the AL East.
But don’t worry, Yankees fans; all is not lost. The Yanks just signed setup man Rafael Soriano to a three-year, $35 million contract. Aside from the fact that they have now dedicated $65 million this off-season to five years’ worth of two relievers — Mariano got $30 million for two years earlier this winter — the move does give the Yankees a formidable setup-closer duo on paper. Whether Soriano, who wasn’t always a closer before dominating for Tampa Bay last year, can be as effective in a non-closing role as the Yanks hope he will remains to be seen. The Red Sox are hoping to get similar results from Bobby Jenks this year, but as J.J. Putz and the New York Mets can attest — and the Red Sox and Eric Gagne, for that matter — things don’t always go according to plan. While I understand that Soriano will no doubt replace Rivera once the latter finally does retire, that day shouldn’t arrive until the last year of Soriano’s contract at the earliest. If Rivera’s next two seasons are successful, it may take even longer. Other teams, like the Brewers, Rangers, and Cubs, have made big moves this winter as well. That said, the off-season hasn’t been kind to everyone. In every big trade, there is the team that is losing its star player, and in every big free agent acquisition, there arwe the teams that lose out on signing him. The Angels inexplicably barely made a peep in trying to sign Crawford and Adrian Beltre, both of whom would have filled giant holes in their lineup and put the team on the right track after a horrendous 2010 campaign. The Marlins have traded away most of their former future, most notably sending Dan Uggla to fellow NL East-mate Atlanta.
But then there are the teams that couldn’t help having a bad off-season in 2010. The Royals traded Zack Greinke because he asked them to. The Padres traded Gonzalez because they couldn’t afford to pay him what he deserved. The Rays lost Crawford to the Sox and Carlos Pena to the Cubs via free agency simply because they couldn’t afford to re-sign either, and they later traded Matt Garza to the Cubs to avoid having to pay him more than they would be able to. 
The Rays have significantly less money to work with than most teams, especially due to the unfortunate fact that no one in Tampa seems to come to their games. The Mets have made big management and front office shakeups, but their off-season plan seems hinged around maybes, has-beens, and hopefuls. Their off-season situation has a little more backstory than “can’t help it,” though; they have almost zero payroll flexibility, mainly due to bad deals of off-seasons past. 2011 benchwarmer Luis Castillo is owed $6 million this year, and bullpen forget-me-please Oliver Perez is owed $12 million. Carlos Beltran is in the final season of his expensive contract, but if things go according to plan, he could still make this year worth every penny. That said, with what little money they do have, the Mets have made some potentially good moves and some nonsensical ones, the most prominent being letting Hisanori Takahashi walk after a phenomenal (and cheap) season.
What’s another difference between the Mets and the Rays? The Rays won their division in 2008 and 2010 and have now proven that they can win with what they have. The Mets have had the big money, but they finished fourth in 2009 and 2010. As this off-season comes to a close, there’s no telling how 2011 will play out for those having, well, off offseasons. 2010 losers like the Orioles and Brewers have done what they need to in order to contend this year, while perennial behemoths like Boston and New York will look to make those moves moot. But winners or losers, off-seasons or on-seasons, there are only four more weeks until hope springs eternal for all.

With the introduction of vehicles such as the Chevrolet Volt, Nissan Leaf, and Toyota Prius, you now have a handful of choices of hybrid-electric vehicles. If the motivation for these vehicles is reducing our dependence on oil, how do they compare to one another? What about reducing greenhouse gas emissions? And on top of all of this, are the costs worth the benefits? Given the potentially harmful environmental impacts of continuing an oil- and gasoline-based automobile industry, a professor at Carnegie Mellon has been working to answer these questions.
Jeremy Michalek, a professor in the departments of engineering and public policy and mechanical engineering, has been working with colleagues to study the various effects of driving hybrid electric vehicles (HEVs) and plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs) on the environment. They are interested in the benefits as well as the disadvantages, which may vary depending on numerous factors such as battery type, distance driven, and where the electricity used to charge the car battery comes from.
Something that the average consumer may not think about is that the emissions associated with driving these electric vehicles include more than what comes out of the tailpipe. Emissions are released  many times during the life cycle of an electric vehicle: from smokestacks of factories that make the vehicles, as well as the power plants that make the electricity to charge the vehicle. Michalek explains that switching from a gasoline to a plug-in vehicle changes the types of emissions and where they are released.
“The nice thing about electricity is that you can make it in lots of different ways and in different locations. Gasoline comes from oil. Sure, you can make it synthetically, but it basically comes from oil. Electricity can be made in so many different ways, including renewable ways,” Michalek said.
Through the use of optimization models, he and his research group looked at which combination of battery properties — like type, capacity, and operating method — resulted in the best balance between greenhouse gas emissions and cost. They compared vehicles that were essentially identical in every way except for the powertrain options; thus, any effects that resulted from a change in battery properties could be assigned to that particular change.
The results of this study, which were recently published in the Journal of Mechanical Design, found that the size of the battery pack played an important role in greenhouse gas emissions and cost. Larger battery packs allow more miles to be driven on electricity, but those additional miles do not outweigh the amount of greenhouse gas emissions associated with the production of those batteries. Smaller battery packs, however, allow fewer miles to be driven on electricity, but are significantly cheaper, so there is a larger reduction in greenhouse gas emissions per dollar spent on the battery. Therefore, considering both economics and greenhouse gas emissions, a moderate- to small-sized battery pack was found to be optimal.
In an interview with the website Electric Vehicle World, Michalek explained, “It will be a good transition for people to start buying these HEVs and PHEVs with smaller battery packs because batteries will start being produced more frequently, and we can move quicker down the battery learning curve and hopefully make them cheaper.” As the technology on battery production improves, larger battery packs would therefore become more economical and have an even larger impact on greenhouse gas emissions.
Michalek has presented policy briefs to Congress members in Washington to make sure that people who are involved with energy policymaking are aware of the findings. Spreading this knowledge to make policymakers and the public more aware of the available technology is important in moving society toward a more sustainable way of living. The next step, Michalek said, will be in estimating the value of the benefits of electric vehicles. Quantifying all of the benefits will help us determine as a society whether or not it is worth the switch to a more electricity-based automobile market.

When one thinks of dialects of a language, one usually thinks of spoken variations that evolve from factors such as geographic location or social class. However, Twitter has provided two Carnegie Mellon researchers and their advising professors with the opportunity to study distinct dialects evolving from the 140-character updates of frequent Twitter users. 
Since Twitter is a conversational social medium, users are more likely to spell words as they are pronounced, thus giving Jacob Eisenstein and Brendan O’Connor, a post-doctoral fellow and doctorate student in the Machine Learning Department, respectively, the chance to study this phenomenon. Two other co-authors on their paper are Eric P. Xing, an associate professor of machine learning, and Noah A. Smith, assistant professor at the Language Technologies Institute.
Eisenstein and O’Connor provided background on the project and its objectives. “[This could tell us] what language variations mean, and if this is a random phenomena that rises and peters out — or is there some conscious or subconscious desire that people have to distinguish their communities by the way to speak, and is that inherent to language?” Eisenstein said.
Over the course of a week last March, Eisenstein and O’Connor gathered tweets from 9,500 users who updated at least 40 times a day and had no more than 1,000 users and followers. With a base of 380,000 total tweets (or approximately 15 parents of public tweets) the two then separated out messages with URLs, as they could be a source of spam, and tweets not in the contiguous United States.
After gathering data for a week and sorting the data according to geographical and subject markers, the team was able to create a rough breakdown of words unique to urban centers of the United States, such as New York City, Northern California, Atlanta, and New England. For instance, New York users often tweeted “suttin” instead of “something” whereas tweets containing the words “hella” and “koo” often originated in Northern California.
In order to sift through the tweets, the pair used mathematical models and statistical distributions to unveil the regional dialects. One model they considered was change over time. For instance, does the dialect start in urban centers and expand outward, or does it move from city to city? Change over time comes from the upper-working class and moves up, Eisenstein said, and could provide an entry point for changes in language. While children learn how to write from school, they learn how to speak from their parents.
“When you look at Twitter as a whole, it’s a lot more diverse with respect to age,” Eisenstein said. “It’s not a bunch of teenagers, but when you [first] post from cell phones and [second] post a billion messages, that may be what gives us a bias to have sort of younger people in our data.”
O’Connor added, “Because Twitter is a very informal form of writing, it’s better at getting these changes in casual language than other forms of writing, because you can spell things how you speak, and no one tells [you] how to use Twitter. You can use things like vowel changes or small stuff that don’t make it into formal writing that can quite conceivably appear in Twitter.”
Besides accounting for high-usage words, the team also had to consider which parts of their data were relevant to a sustained change over time. 
In reference to an acronym found on the East Coast, Eisenstein explained, “Here is a word that only occurs in New York or only in Pennsylvania, and you have to ask yourself, is this a stable variation...? When we look at this a year from now, is it still going to be the case that we only see it in this part of the country, or will is spread to the whole country, or will it completely disappear off the map?”
Eisenstein also accounted for random variables that do not relate to a region’s dialect. In one instance, the Oklahoma Thunder played two games against the Sacramento Kings, which accounted for why “thunder” was a dialect marker for the Northern California region. 
“If you did a more longitudinal sample over the course of the year, presumably you wouldn’t see that,” he said. Another marker that was exclusive to the Lake Erie region was “Bieber.” Whether this is an anomaly or not is yet to be determined.
Change on Twitter happens a lot faster than in other media, and could allow researchers to study changes in real time. While studies about language changes on Twitter are still early, such findings could provide further insight into linguistics and the evolution of culture.

Who doesn't remember their first time going to a 3-D movie and being astounded by the objects flying out of the screen? Now, technology has found a way to bring the same wonder into living rooms through the rapid advance of 3-D technology. The idea of 3-D pictures has been around since the invention of stereo photography in 1833, where a single picture was captured from two slightly different angles and then put together in such a way to fool the eye into thinking it was looking at a scene with depth. Technology has obviously come a long way since then, now utilizing many different methods to fool the eye into thinking it is looking at a 3-D picture. These new 3-D technologies can broadly be divided into two groups: ones that need the viewer to wear glasses, and ones that do not require any additional hardware to be used. The more popular form of displays are ones that do not require glasses or filters. These are called “autostereoscopic” displays. They have been around for many decades, but are only becoming popular now, due to the growing production of 3-D television sets.
Autostereoscopic displays use many techniques to produce the effect of 3-D vision. These displays fool the eye into thinking that a 2-D image is actually 3-D by making each eye see a slightly different image to create the illusion of depth. The two main methods to do this are called the parallax barrier and lenticular lens. In the parallax barrier method, a barrier is created between the display and the eyes. This barrier makes sure that each eye receives light from alternating pixels on the screen, so that each eye can receive a slightly different picture. These types of televisions can function as regular 2-D displays, as the parallax barrier can simply be disabled by having a current passed through it to display the pictures normally. In the lenticular lens method, small lenses are attached to the screen, and these direct the light from the television into a defined optimal viewing area where the eyes can look to see a 3-D image. Obviously, both of these methods depend upon the eyes being in a pre-defined area if the viewer wishes to see a 3-D image. However, real viewers do not always sit in the same place to watch television. This difficulty has been eliminated by the television manufacturers by including head or eye-tracking software with their televisions. 
Another way manufacturers have been able to make autostereoscopic displays more technologically advanced is by removing the need for head tracking software completely, even though this method requires more computing power to be present in the television. This extra computing power is then used to project light to several different viewpoints at the same time, allowing the eye to move around in the viewing area and not lose the 3-D picture. This method can accommodate a large number of different viewing angles. This process can be accompanied by a loss in resolution, but there is no doubt that as technology moves forward, these televisions will get cheaper and better, too.
3-D televisions are already gaining popularity among several television manufacturers who plan to make 3-D televisions cheaper and more accessible for the public. Many television shows have also started providing 3-D versions; one of the more notable 3-D television broadcasts was the 2010 FIFA World Cup. Although 3-D technology is not just limited to TVs — gadgets such as the Nintendo 3DS and 3-D laptops have been developed — their rapid technological advancement is spurred by high demand and a wave of 3-D movies in theaters. Soon enough, people will have the choice to be able to experience the magic of seeing a 3-D movie in the comfort of their own home.

As the snowy weather shows no signs of letting up, students are constantly reminded of one aspect of winter — it’s very cold outside. And even when proper measures are taken to stay warm, such as bundling up and hurrying to class, cold weather poses a health risk to those who are forced to stay outside for long periods of time.
Many people believe the human body is always at a constant 98.6°F, but the body’s internal temperature normally fluctuates between 98°F and 100°F. Various processes in the body regulate the internal temperature, but the body cannot compensate for extremely cold temperatures. If the body’s internal temperature drops below 95°F, this becomes a medical emergency known as hypothermia, according to Mayo Clinic.
The part of the brain that regulates body temperature is the hypothalamus, which both obtains temperature data from the body and sends instructions back, as stated in an article on www.medicinenet.com. For example, when we are feeling cold, the hypothalamus recognizes that body temperature must be increased. Thus, it may respond by telling our muscles to shiver.
Most of the body’s heat is lost through the skin. Therefore, as the body’s temperature decreases, blood is routed through vessels that are further from the skin, which prevents rapid heat loss. In addition, the more vital organs, such as the heart, lungs, and brain, receive greater amounts of blood, while limbs and extremities receive less. When the body’s core temperature decreases enough, blood flow, and therefore oxygen delivery, may be so limited to certain organs that they begin to fail.
Hypothermia is dangerous not only because of its effects on the body, but also on the mind. As blood flow becomes restricted, the brain’s reasoning ability decreases. Since the onset of hypothermia is gradual, a hypothermic person may not even realize he or she is in danger. Other symptoms of hypothermia include hunger, nausea, confusion, lethargy, and slurred speech, according to www.medicinenet.com. If a person’s body temperature drops too low, he or she may lose consciousness and fall into a coma. In addition, low temperatures cause the heart to beat abnormally, resulting in cardiac arrest.
Treatment for hypothermia involves moving the victim to a warm place and covering him or her. The body should be gradually heated. In many cases, frostbite occurs along with hypothermia, so heat should not directly be applied to the body.
Everybody gets cold, but certain people are more susceptible to heat loss than others. Children and the elderly cannot generate heat efficiently, and infants, who have proportionally large heads, lose heat quickly. Alcohol seems to make the body warmer, but the opposite is true; alcohol causes blood vessels to dilate, which forces blood nearer to the surface of the skin. In addition, alcohol diminishes the amount the body shivers. As a result, body heat is lost at a faster rate.
While hypothermia is a medical emergency, it has its use in medical procedures. One of these procedures is called therapeutic hypothermia, which is usually performed on patients who have suffered from a heart attack. If the body is cooled to a temperature around 93.2°F after it has suffered from a heart attack, survival rates have been shown to increase, and the patients show a greater amount of recovery.
Hypothermia is dangerous, but can easily be prevented by using common sense and avoiding harsh weather.

Facebook moves all users to new profile
While Facebook has been migrating its users to its new profile since last December, the change became mandatory for all users last Wednesday. The new profile removes the tabs in a user’s profile in favor of a category listing below the profile picture, and it no longer displays a user’s current status next to his or her name. The more controversial changes in the new profile include highlighting personal information — birth date, location, and the like — at the top of the main profile page.

Vaccine and autism study is a fraud
A study led by Andrew Wakefield and published in The Lancet, a leading British medical journal, in 1998 claimed to link the common vaccine for measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) to autism in children. Since that time, Wakefield’s findings have been criticized, and the scientific community has claimed that his research practices did not meet acceptable standards. In a new development, though, The Lancet itself denounced Wakefield’s study as a fraud. A report by journalist Brian Deer found that the medical histories of the children in the study had been fabricated.

Verizon network to add iPhone
In a move anticipated for months, Verizon Wireless and Apple Inc. announced Tuesday that Apple’s iPhone 4 would shortly be available for use on the Verizon network. This marks the first time that the iPhone will be usable in the United States on a carrier other than AT&T. It will be in stores in early February. The Verizon iPhone 4 will use the 3G CDMA network, rather than the 4G LTE network, which is faster and allows for simultaneous data and voice communications.

Painkillers receive FDA limits
The Food and Drug Administration announced on Thursday that it would limit the amount of acetaminophen contained in several prescription painkillers. An overdose of acetaminophen — which is found in Tylenol, Vicodin, and Percocet, among other medications — can cause severe liver damage. Damage is more likely when the ingredient is combined with alcohol or other drugs, such as codeine. Such prescription medications will also be required to have a warning label. Over-the-counter medications such as normal Tylenol will not be affected.

MySpace cuts staff by half
Pioneering social network MySpace announced Tuesday that 500 jobs — equivalent to almost 50 percent of the company’s worldwide employees — would be cut as it attempts to restructure itself. Though MySpace was once the premier social network, it has largely been replaced by Facebook, and in recent years the site has struggled to differentiate itself. News Corp., which is run by Rupert Murdoch, is the parent company of MySpace, and reports indicate that it is looking for opportunities to sell the website.

Earth’s orbit causes change in zodiac
A physical phenomenon known as precession has forced astrologers to add a new sign to the zodiac. Precession is a consequence of the moon’s gravity affecting the Earth’s orbit, in which the Earth’s axis “wobbles” over time. A complete rotation of the axis takes 26,000 years. This means that views of the night sky change, which means that zodiac signs change as well. The new sign is called Ophiuchus.

Today marks an important day in American history. It is Martin Luther King Jr. Day, dedicated to a man who is revered for his ideas of social justice, racial equity, and nonviolent protest. Nearly 40 years after King’s death in 1968 and more than 20 years after the holiday was first signed into law and commemorated, Martin Luther King Jr. Day holds a unique position among national holidays.
To begin with, its history is a controversial one. Although Ronald Reagan signed the day into law in 1983, it was first observed in 1986. Numerous states and their representatives resisted the attempts to make the holiday official, or chose to recognize the holiday with alternative names. Taking an extreme stance on the issue, South Carolina did not recognize Martin Luther King Jr. Day as a paid holiday until 2000, the first year the holiday was officially observed by all 50 states. Instead, the state offered employees the choice of celebrating either King’s birthday or one of three Confederate holidays. In Virginia, Martin Luther King Jr. Day was recognized as Lee-Jackson-King Day, juxtaposing the names of two Confederate heroes with that of King.
More conventional recognitions of Martin Luther King Jr. Day have since taken precedence. Former Pennsylvania Senator Harris Wofford and Georgia Representative John Lewis created the King Holiday and Service Act, urging Americans to participate in a day of service intended to honor King. First-year Arshia Ahuja agrees with this method of memorializing King. “Martin Luther King Jr. Day is an opportunity for service,” she said. “It’s a time for reflection — Dr. King’s life and efforts affected everybody.”
King’s life was indeed an illustrious one. Most Americans are familiar with his “I Have a Dream” speech, delivered on the steps of the Lincoln Memorial, and are aware of his numerous marches and protests, and of his sacrifices while in jail. However, there remain some facts about his life and work which are not widely known. King wrote several books, from The Measure of a Man in 1959, to Strength to Love in 1963 and Why We Can’t Wait, published in 1964. His books respectively explore the theology concerning nonviolent activism, a collection of some of his most famous sermons, and an analysis of both civil rights history and the next steps toward social justice in America. There is also a posthumously published collection of his speeches titled I Have a Dream: Writings and Speeches That Changed the World.
In addition to his well-known civil rights work, King was also an avid anti-war protestor, and he spent the last few years of his life speaking out against the Vietnam War. He also worked with unions throughout the country in an attempt to improve economic inequalities. The youngest person to receive the Nobel Peace Prize, King is also one of 10 designated 20th-century world martyrs to have a statue at Westminster Abbey in London.
Carnegie Mellon is giving students, faculty, and staff the afternoon of Martin Luther King Jr. Day off for service purposes. The administration has several programs planned for the day, including addresses, forums, and readings to commemorate King’s life. Local institutions throughout Pittsburgh have also planned events for the celebration of Martin Luther King Jr. Day. The Western Pennsylvania Diversity Initiative has planned a 2011 MLK Day Community Service Project, during which they will be partnering with Pittsburgh Cares, a volunteer organization dedicated to increasing community engagement, to create a fulfilling and altruistic program.
Multiple arts organizations throughout the city also will be honoring King’s accomplishments. The Carnegie Museums of Art and Natural History will have free admission and parking today. In addition, the Pittsburgh Glass Center is offering a day of free mosaic making, glass blowing, and flame working demonstrations. East Liberty’s Kelly-Strayhorn Theater is hosting a celebratory event with music and dance from groups including the YMCA Westinghouse Lighthouse Project and the Alumni Theater Company. The August Wilson Center opens a new exhibit titled Civil Rights Superheroes on Monday in honor of King. Created to demonstrate the effectiveness of comic books and cartoons in bringing people to the civil rights movement, the exhibit is based on the 1958 comic book Civil Rights Superheroes: Martin Luther King and the Montgomery Story and includes letters from King.
Local efforts and plans for Martin Luther King Jr. Day reflect Pittsburgh’s extensive civil rights history. Although Pittsburgh may not be the first location that comes to mind when one thinks of the civil rights movement, Pittsburgh was in fact involved in many key components of civil rights history in the United States. Pittsburgh was a key station of the Underground Railroad, which helped approximately 100,000 slaves escape from the slaveholding South into the North. Middle-class African-Americans in the Hill District often allowed runaway slaves to stay in their churches as they made their way further north.
The North Side, known as Allegheny in the early 1800s, was another local stop on the railroad. Black and white civil rights leaders, including African-Americans Martin Delany, John Vashon, and Lewis Woodson and whites Charles Avery, Julius Lemoyne, and Jane Grey Swisshelm, founded a school for black children and the North Side’s Avery College — both likely Underground Railroad stops — to provide higher education for blacks who were not admitted to colleges and universities.
After the Emancipation Proclamation and the end of the Civil War, many African-Americans came into Pittsburgh to work in factories in the city. Although they were free from slavery, they still had to battle heavy prejudice and racism. In response, black leaders organized several protests to try to combat the discrimination. The Pittsburgh Courier, one of the oldest and best-known black newspapers in the country, was founded in 1910 and was highly influential in rallying people to the cause of civil rights. A major battle for black civil rights was won in 1937 when the Pittsburgh Board of Education hired its first black teacher, Lawrence Peeler.
During World War II, the struggle for civil rights increased. In the years immediately following the war, protests for equality grew larger and more frequent. A member of the Urban League led pickets to force downtown department stores to hire black clerks. The Montefiore and St. Francis hospitals began to admit blacks into their nursing schools, and Montefiore Hospital allowed African-American doctor Charles Burks staff privileges — a significant step forward for African-Americans in the medical industry.
After the Supreme Court’s decision against segregation in Brown v. Board of Education, Pittsburgh began to desegregate its schools, swimming pools, and other  institutions and began to build the Civic Arena — later known as the Mellon Arena — located in the Lower Hill. Several Pittsburghers traveled “down South” with  freedom riders to press for civil rights in states like Mississippi.
In 1968, the assassination of King sparked riots in Pittsburgh, causing fires to devastate regions of the Hill District. Ultimately, however, the foundation for a platform of social justice had been laid, and the city was able to collectively move forward to where it is today. Today’s celebrations will allow all of us the opportunity to reflect on what it cost the nation and our city to be where we are today in terms of social justice and racial  equality, and to consider and act upon what is necessary to move us to where we ought to be.

Students at Carnegie Mellon are pretty lucky — nearly every conceivable form of food can be found within minutes of campus. Bakeries, whether specializing in pastries, pies, cupcakes, or all of the above, have become quite popular among students looking for a sweet treat and a break from their studies. One great option for sampling desserts is Food Glorious Food, a catering company that opens their shop in Highland Park every Saturday morning to sell their fresh-baked creations to the community.
The display at the bakery, with the grand spread of cakes, cookies, tarts, pies, and quiches, is guaranteed to make any customer’s mouth water, as well as remove the ability to choose any particular pastry. 
One customer favorite is the Apple Harvest Cake. Loaded with large apple chunks, it is a tangy cake that is sure to please. Its cream cheese-based frosting maintains the moisture and adds a creamy texture. Each bite comes close to melting in your mouth. Although it is extremely delicious, the richness of the cake makes just one slice extremely satisfying.
Another good option is the Jewish Pizza. This breadstick is very different from the usual kind, with a firm, crisp, sugar-coated exterior. The tastes of dried fruit and almonds come through to accent this addicting treat.
The Lemon Tart, with its strong flavor and nice, thick consistency, is also a great choice. The filling is glazed over, giving it a creme brulee crunch with each bite. The crust is firm and maintains the integrity of this dish to complement the lemon filling, creating an interesting but successfully dynamic bite. Instead of being acidic and sour, it is a nice, refreshing tart that has a hint of summer.
The Sour Cream Apple Pie presents a different approach to making an apple pie. In between the slices of apple are layers of sour cream. It gives balance to the pie, keeping it from being too sweet. Above the fluffy apple and sour cream combo is a crunchy top layer, giving this pie an unique combination of coffee cake and apple pie taste.
There are some exceptions to the great standard of desserts, though. The highly recommended Neapolitan cake was messy, heavy, and fell significantly short of expectations. Large pillows of cream interrupted the layers of pastry. Unfortunately, the pastry was not as soft as it should have been and the effort it took to eat it ruined the dish.
This charming little bakery is just a side note to the larger operation. The owners, Brad Walter and chef Tom Hambor, run Food Glorious Food as a cooking school, catering company, and corporate training center. They also have a small gourmet store located at their bakery. The hands-on cooking classes teach everything from making your own mozzarella cheese to organic soups and gourmet meals. Although slightly expensive, these classes teach skills that will impress anyone.
Food Glorious Food includes Carnegie Mellon as a significant part of its history. Walter was the Dean of Student Affairs here at Carnegie Mellon back in the 1980s. He was the one who brought the infamous clock to the Cut, as well as pushing for the construction of the University Center to give students a proper place to meet with each other. He eventually went to the Loretta Paganini School of Cooking in Cleveland and has since taught cooking around the world. He met his business partner in 2000 and opened Food Glorious Food shortly after.
Every Saturday, the bakery opens at 10 a.m. and goes until they are sold out. Usually this happens around 4 p.m., so getting there early is a good idea so that you can sample some of their best stuff. Customers can feel the attention to detail and quality of the food. Food Glorious Food is a great bakery that must be experienced. 
Food Glorious Food is located at 5906 Bryant St. in the Highland Park neighborhood. Reach them at 412.363.5330, or browse their website: foodgloriousfoodonline.com.

For most students, grabbing a bite means heading to one of the relatively affordable restaurants located near campus. Sometimes, though, students may have a desire to break out and spend a night in the city. If this is the case, head downtown and visit Seviche, a restaurant serving a wide variety of Latino tapas.
Ceviche is a traditional Latin American dish that, in its purest form, is fish marinated in lime juice. There are many different varieties of this dish, but the original ceviche is speculated to be from Peru. In the traditional Peruvian style, ceviche is made of chunks of raw fish marinated in lemon and lime juice, chopped onions, garlic, tomatoes, and a little bit of chili pepper, and is usually served with tortillas or tortilla chips. The fish is cooked by the citric acid in the marinade and is served at room temperature. This dish provides a quick, easy-to-make summer meal.
At Seviche, customers can sample many different preparations of the dish, and this brings in tastes from around the world. The menu gives you seven styles of ceviche that then can be made with 13 different types of fish. The two most popular styles, traditional and Asian tartare, go best with the ahi tuna. The traditional ceviche is a very simple take on the dish that is both light and substantive. The Asian tartare is equally delicious. Little rice squares serve as the base for the fish seasoned with soy sauce and accented with wasabi mayonnaise and white truffle oil. The Asian flair is well-balanced and the taste of the tuna is pleasant but not overbearing.
Aside from ceviche, the restaurant also features many different tapas. The pulled chicken taquitos show off the executive chef Yves Carreau’s inventive style. The pulled chicken is wrapped in a fluffy tortilla and then fried and served with a tomato-based mole. “Addicting” is the best word to describe them. Seviche also serves mini ahi tuna burgers. This Americanized version of ceviche features soft, yet crisp, ciabatta buns with ceviche in the middle, and is only garnished with micro greens and wasabi mayo. Simple, yet full of flavor, almost everyone at the restaurant had an order of these on their table.
In trying to recreate the South American mood, the restaurant features an extensive menu of mojitos and specialty drinks.  Caipirinha, a traditional Brazilian cocktail, is another notable drink at Seviche. It is made with cachaca (distilled sugar cane), fresh lime, and raw sugar, and the lime really comes through and dominates the drink.
The atmosphere of South America really shows in the decor as well. Customers are inclined to feel as if they have left Pittsburgh and traveled all the way to South Beach in Miami. Vibrant colors are present throughout the restaurant and accent the many pieces of Latin art arranged throughout. 
The presentation and quality of the food would lead one to expect an extremely large bill at Seviche, but everything is actually moderately priced, which makes this restaurant a prime choice for a night out in the city. The casual feel of the place makes the dining experience that much more enjoyable. Being allowed to just sit back and appreciate the food and company is a major plus.
Seviche is located at 930 Penn Ave. in downtown Pittsburgh. Learn more by visiting their website at www.seviche.com.

One of the benefits of going to school in Pittsburgh is that there are infinite dining options to save you from getting tired of having the same campus food every day, and at the top of
the list of great places to eat is Uncle Sam’s Gourmet Subs. 
With two locations close to campus, Uncle Sam’s is a convenient stop that only requires a few minutes’ walk. At the Squirrel Hill location, customers can watch their sandwiches being prepared behind a counter by the door, and a big board above the grill informs everyone about the restaurant’s perfectly sized menu — there are enough items to add variety without making the decision too diffi cult. Classic options range from the cheese steak to the turkey breast and provolone to the Italian sausage and cheese. A quick tip: If you eat at the restaurant, fries are included.
Aside from the standard fare are the Specialties and the Ultras: subs loaded with extra meat and toppings. Customers are faced with hard decisions like picking between the Ultra Philly Cheese Steak with its grilled onions and provolone cheese and the Ultra Uncle Sam’s Special, which comes with extra steak, sweet peppers, grilled onions, mushrooms, and
provolone cheese.
The service is good and the food usually comes just in time to quell the hunger built up by watching everyone else eat. On one side, the fries lie in a perfect heap with a red
peppermint candy hiding underneath. On the other half of the basket is the sandwich, cut down the middle, too big to fit into the basket as a whole. From the first bite, the flavor, the
temperature, and the texture are all just right. The soft, warm roll with its layer of mayonnaise leads directly to the meat, cheese, and toppings. It happens all at once and creates many different degrees of taste, making each bite distinctive from the next. The shoestring fries are equally good, and they help customers pace themselves on the sandwich. As the fries dwindle, a peppermint candy can be found at the bottom — this serves as a well-deserved reward for making it to the end.
Simply put, this is a sandwich joint. There are no fusses and everything is very simple. The décor only gets as complicated as old photographs of Pittsburgh and some mirrors to make the room feel bigger. That said, you need to play by their rules. It’s cash-only, which can be frustrating. They have an ATM attached to their register, but there is a service charge, so drawing some cash on the way is a good idea. Also, Uncle Sam must have an early bedtime because the restaurant closes at 8:30 p.m. every day. Drinks are reasonably priced, but there’s a nominal fee for refills. All in all, the amazing sandwiches require you to forgive the minor faults.
Uncle Sam’s Subs has two locations near campus. One is located at 210 Oakland Avenue between Joe Mama’s and Fuel and Fuddle. The other is at 5808 Forbes Ave. right near the corner of Forbes and Murray avenues.

One of the most exciting things about trying different restaurants is finding a hidden gem: a restaurant that locals rave about but is still obscure enough to retain its original charm. Point Brugge is one of those places. Located in the Point Breeze/Homewood neighborhood, the restaurant is modeled after the quaint cafés and bistros found across Europe. Although it has heavy Belgian influences, the menu combines a unique blend of dishes that gives something new to order every time.
By far the most popular dish at the restaurant is the moules, or mussels, which can be prepared in any of three different ways. The customers’ favorite is the classic sauce, made of white wine with shallots, hints of garlic, and a little cream. The mussels are full of flavor and the sauce adds just enough texture without being too overbearing. The moules frites come with Point Brugge’s famous twice-fried french fries. The extra time in the fryer crisps the outside, and the large, granular salt they are sprinkled with makes these fries impossible to stop eating. In a gut-busting move, the fries also come with basil mayonnaise for dipping. This combination of moules and frites proves to be nearly irresistible.
For those who are not fans of shellfish, the menu is full of a wide variety of different dishes to choose from. The roasted tomato and spinach dip makes a great appetizer for the table, and the cold celery served with it creates an interesting dynamic when dipped into the hot dip. The salted toast is also pleasing, as it brings out the full flavor of the dip and is sure not to disappoint. Chicken skewers show off the more eclectic side of the menu. Grilled over a flame and then marinated in a spicy peanut sauce, the chicken is tender and the peanut sauce gives a little kick at the end of every bite.
Over the past few years, the gourmet burger has challenged the country’s top chefs to reinvent a staple of the American diet while still maintaining the emotion of the hamburger. Point Brugge and its executive chef Kevin Hunninen have a burger to compete. This plump burger, grilled perfectly to medium/medium-well, was full of moisture and flavor. The Gruyere cheese, lettuce, and onions added crunch and texture while the basil mayonnaise increased the richness of the burger’s taste. Add a side of frites to complete the meal. 
The restaurant offers both a lunch and a dinner menu. The lunch menu features smaller dishes, including the moules, as well as salads and a nice variety of sandwiches. The steak au jus is a lunchtime favorite for customers. The dinner menu includes most of the lunch menu, as well as a strong list of dinner entrees. The seafood waterzooi — a soup made from fish — and the carbonnade flammande — a Belgian beef stew — are constantly coming out of the kitchen to be served to waiting customers.
Besides the food, Point Brugge features a fabulous beer list. Most of the beer is imported from Belgium, as well as the rest of Europe, and it provides a great opportunity to sample many different types of beer. The Corsendonk Abbey Pale Ale is a light beer with a fruity flavor that leaves a pleasant aftertaste. The Leffe Blonde is a traditional Belgian beer with its sweet and rich taste. Anyone interested in becoming familiar with the various beers of Europe would definitely enjoy Point Brugge.
The restaurant is good for dates, for those who love to try new kinds of food, and for anyone else that can find their way to this location. Prices are reasonable and worth the value of the experience. 
Point Brugge is located at 401 Hastings St. in Homewood, Pa. Visit their website at www.pointbrugge.com for more information.

Living in the “City of Champions” sometimes requires the breakfast of champions. Smallman Street Deli in Squirrel Hill, a kosher-style Jewish deli, is a great place for all meals, but their standout specialty is their breakfast. Whether it is pancakes, Crunchy French Toast, or the omelets, everyone walks away happy.
According to the employees, the most popular breakfast item is the Crunchy French Toast. The Challah bread is coated in a “crispy” mixture, dipped in the egg batter and grilled to a perfect golden brown. With a little syrup, this stuff is unbeatable. The little crunch on the top is followed by a warm, soft inside. No flavor is overpowered by another and it leaves the perfect aftertaste. It is easy to see why this is a customer favorite.
Among the other favorites are omelets, lox, and the two specials. The Murray Ave. Breakfast Special comes with two eggs, choice of breakfast meat (including corned beef or pastrami), hash browns, toast, and coffee. The Forbes Ave. Breakfast Special is identical except for the addition of pancakes or regular French toast. It is the perfect combination of carbs and proteins to start your day off right. Come hungry and/or hung over and you will be very pleased.
Aside from breakfast, the lunches make it a popular stop for businessmen, students, and regulars. They have dozens of sandwich meats to choose from, making decisions difficult. A customer favorite is the Reuben, which many consider to be better than that from New York City. The food is so good at Smallman Street Deli that it won first place for best deli in Pittsburgh magazine’s 2009 Reader Poll.
The menu is modeled after the old Weinstein’s Deli that used to reside on Murray Avenue. The owners Bill Wedner and Jeff Cohen had a pretty good idea of what people wanted; their goal was to bring people back to their childhood memories of going to the deli. In fact, the slogan of Smallman Street Deli is “deli the way it used to be.” They opened the original Smallman Street Deli in late 2000 on Smallman Street in the Strip District as a way to sell some of the products from their meat packing plant. Not expecting much success, it was a pleasant surprise when the lunchtime crowd made it one of the most popular places in the Strip District. Feeling the need to expand, they opened the second (and much larger) location in Squirrel Hill in 2005. Ever since, it has been a staple of the community, known for its great food and friendly atmosphere.
There are no frills about this place. The menu is written on a giant chalkboard that hangs over the deli counter that runs along the side of the restaurant and around to the eat-in counter. 
There is no point in ignoring the elephant down the street. So here is a list of why someone should choose Smallman Street Deli over Pamela’s:
Smallman Street Deli has two locations. One is located at 1912 Murray Ave. in Squirrel Hill across the street from the Giant Eagle. The other is located at 2840 Smallman St. in the Strip District.

It’s the end of the semester and free time is scarce. While studying for finals, getting final portfolios done, and finishing those term papers, it is important to make the most of that free time by relaxing and there is no better way to do that than by heading up to Squirrel Hill and visiting some of Pittsburgh’s best Asian restaurants. Silk Elephant and Sun Penang both offer a different taste of Asian cuisine.
Silk Elephant is the newest restaurant opened by the chef of Bangkok Balcony. Billed as a tapas and wine bar, there are many surprises that make customers feel as if they are in rural Thailand. The decor creates a welcoming atmosphere that finishes the Asian dynamic of the meal. Tapas are the most popular dishes on the menu.
The corn fritters, a customer favorite, are made of lightly fried corn and complemented by a sweet chili sauce. Moo and Goong steamed dumplings are another excellent choice, as they are full of flavor and texture. On the main menu, the Pad See Ew is an excellent dish for a group to share. This restaurant is definitely worth a try. It has a relaxing experience, the service is attentive, and the food comes out of the kitchen fairly quickly. All in all, Silk Elephant is a unique dining experience in Squirrel Hill that provides authentic Thai cuisine.
Sun Penang is a quiet restaurant located in the commercial section of Forbes Avenue in Squirrel Hill. The restaurant is comfortable and dark, allowing the customer to escape the dreary Pittsburgh weather. Inspired by Malaysian cooking, the menu is long and extensive. Penang Char Kway Teow is their best dish; this noodle medley combines various seafood- and vegetable-based dishes with a slight kick of spice. When dining at Sun Penang, customers should make sure to order their homemade iced tea. Sun Penang offers a very solid and rejuvanating meal.
Both of these restaurants bring a different taste of Asian cuisine to Squirrel Hill. Since it is only a short bus ride up Forbes from campus, these places make for the perfect escape from the third floor of Hunt library.
Silk Elephant is located at 1712 Murray Avenue. Sun Penang is located at 5829 Forbes Avenue.

It’s always important to have a place to go where you feel like a regular. From the bar of the same name in Cheers to the Central Perk coffee shop in Friends, every neighborhood has a spot that feels like home. The Elbow Room, located in Shadyside, is a warm restaurant and bar that fits into this category.
Located on Ellsworth Avenue in Shadyside, the Elbow Room is a great place to take a date, friends, or even parents. 
When it comes to the menu, you can expect typical American pub food. The menu includes a list of appetizers, salads, soups, burgers, sandwiches, wraps, and dinner plates that remind you of a homemade meal. The best things on the menu are the comfort foods. 
The French onion soup is unbelievably delicious. Served in a crock, the cheese is overflowing, slightly crisped in the oven, and protecting the chunky onion soup below. On a recent visit, tomato-basil soup was offered as a special and it was also quite good. The pink broth, accented by large tomato chunks, was light-hearted, and the basil was distinctive without being overbearing.
Good chili is difficult for most people to agree on. The Elbow Room makes a superb effort with its Red Chili. Although it looks chunky, it is in fact very smooth in texture and in taste. It had a bit of a spicy kick to it, just enough to add flavor. The chicken fingers are light and served with an amazing lemon mustard sauce. While chicken fingers are usually left to the appetizer or kids’ menu, they make a great dinner option alongside the French onion soup or the Red Chili. 
The theme of comfort must run throughout this restaurant. Any item on the menu that looks the slightest bit overcomplicated usually is. One burger that will grab your eye is the Johnny Apple burger. With brie, applewood-smoked bacon, and a slice of apple, it is a good restaurant burger. However, it is difficult to taste a distinctive flavor, and the apple slice ends up adding texture but little else. The sweet potato fries were disappointing as they lacked any bit of crisp. A good rule to avoid this problem: keep it simple and stick to the comfort foods.
Besides a few overcomplicated dishes, there are few negative points. The restaurant is located near the corner of Ellsworth and Maryland, which means it is a trek for those without cars. If you do drive, expect to take five to 10 minutes to look for a parking spot. Aside from these shortfalls, everything else is pretty good. There is rarely a long wait to get a table and service is usually pretty quick. The wine list (if you’re interested and above 21) is solid and the happy hour is pretty good. There is also a loyalty rewards program that gives back to customers for eating there often.
You can impress a date with your knowledge of local restaurants by taking them to the Elbow Room (unless, of course, they’ve already read this article). It is moderately priced and the atmosphere is great. The Elbow Room makes you feel like a regular from the moment you walk in the door. This place only improves each time you visit as you get a sense of the menu. With time, this will become a favorite stop for a nice, relaxing meal.
The Elbow Room is located at 5744 1/2 Ellsworth Avenue.

How often is it possible to enter a realm of mystery, to visit Wonderland and have a tea party, to investigate a homicide, or to have a party with aliens? Probably not very often, but at this year’s Winter Gala all these things, and more, became a reality.
Every year for the past nine years, the Office of Student Activities has set up the Winter Gala with the help of other campus offices as an event to welcome students back to school for the spring semester. According to Taylor Grabowsky, a coordinator of Student Activities and the mastermind behind this event, this year’s mystery theme is a “dark and brooding” contrast to the “bright and fun” themes of past galas.
This year’s gala featured seven themed rooms with an overall theme of mystery. Kirr Commons in the University Center became Tudor Manor for an evening based on the board game Clue, with all the members of the Student Activities staff dressed as characters from the game. Upon entering the gala, students were given a ticket fashioned as a board game and at each room received a sticker on their ticket. Once all the stickers were collected, the tickets were entered into the grand prize drawing for an Xbox 360 and a $50 Best Buy gift card. Each of the different rooms had its own drawings for other prizes, including games, DVDs, gift cards, and many other appealing items.
The variety of creative themes established a whole world of mystery. Each room had its own special attributes that channeled the theme of mystery in different ways. One theme was “Wonderland,” based on two of the best-known characters from the story, the Red Queen and the Mad Hatter. The Queen’s side had a Valentine’s Day feel, while the Mad Hatter’s side was boisterous, colorful, and fun. Another room’s theme was “Area 51,” which had a club atmosphere with an eerie alien vibe. The theme “221 Baker Street” was dedicated to the legendary detective Sherlock Holmes, and participants were asked to solve a mystery. The room for the “Legends and Monsters” theme had activities for the participants such as making monster masks, creating a monster legend, getting tarot card readings, as well as an open mic to voice their talent (or just sing for fun) on stage.
“Halloween Town” was a theme based on the movie The Nightmare Before Christmas. There was free hair styling, pictures with Jack Skellington, and, of course, plenty of candy. The room themed “Night at the Museum” gave participants the chance to dress up as historical characters, build a dinosaur or sphinx, or turn their friend into a mummy. Finally, the “Department of Mysteries” theme was a thrill for Harry Potter fans. This room featured a sorting hat, floating dementors, butterbeer on tap, and other interesting elements that brought this theme to life. In addition to these themed rooms, Rangos Hall was set up as a casino where students could get chips and tokens to try their luck and win raffle tickets for the many prize drawings.
There was a large turnout for this spectacular event, and it was a great chance for students to relax and have fun. “I wasn’t expecting much when I got there, but once I got there, I got wrapped up in the whole mood of it all and the themes of the different rooms,” said sophomore Tepper School of Business student Alysia Finger. “Even though I didn’t win anything, I still had a really great time.” Assuredly, there will be many people looking forward to attending next year’s Winter Gala.

Like any year, 2010 proved to be a whirlwind series of ups and downs for music. We saw the deaths of Jay Reatard and Mark Linkous, leader of the band Sparklehorse. Some artists were imprisoned, some released from prison, and one (T.I.) even managed to find himself back in prison again. A video of Miley Cyrus smoking a bong went viral on the Internet shortly after her eighteenth birthday. We won’t even get started on Kanye West, who is a story in and of himself. 
Despite the lowlights of the year, the ups were pretty high. Daft Punk created arguably the best soundtrack of the year for the movie TRON: Legacy. Pavement got back together for a reunion tour. After five years, Sufjan Stevens finally released another album, and a great one at that. Of the many album releases that defined the year, some proved more outstanding than others. 
10. Robyn, Body Talk. Body Talk manages to be weird without being off-putting, catchy without being repetitive, poppy without being overly peppy. The album is an explosion of dance-pop energy with synthetic sounds and heavy drum beats. Robyn weaves stories with her songs, talking about the push and pull of a no-strings-attached relationship in “Hang With Me,” and the heartache of a girl watching the guy she loves dance with someone else in “Dancing On My Own.” Robyn centers her songs around energetic melodies, never letting the meaning behind the songs weigh them down.
9. Vampire Weekend, Contra. A case of sophomore album syndrome clearly does not apply to Vampire Weekend. With a debut as strong as their namesake album, it’s hard to imagine the band topping their first success, but in Contra, Vampire Weekend exceeded expectations and released a sophomore album to remember. With its Afro-pop influences and synthetic sounds, the quartet manages to perfect the balance between staying true its roots and experimenting with new ideas. 
8. Bruno Mars, Doo-Wops and Hooligans. Few artists manage to make a splash before releasing an album, much less turn that splash into a tidal wave, but Bruno Mars is just such an artist. Mars lent his voice to B.o.B’s “Nothin’ On You” and Travie McCoy’s “Billionaire,” both hit songs on Top 40 radio stations. Then, he blew America away with the single “Just The Way You Are,” melting many girls’ hearts in the process. His songs are catchy without being generic, and he has one of the best male voices in the popular music industry — two key ingredients to the success of his debut album.
7. Big Boi, Sir Lucious Left Foot: The Son of Chico Dusty. “No, not André 3000. The other guy.” However unfair this statement might be, there is always the member that is the lesser known in a two-part band. After this album, there is no way that Big Boi could stay the “other member” of OutKast for long. The album is spectacular and anything but predictable. Big Boi is heavily influenced by Southern hip hop, as well as funk and dub-step. He uses clever wordplay and delivers fast-paced lyrics that leave listeners breathless.
6. Beach House, Teen Dream. Victoria Legrand’s voice is captivating, and while it is sometimes hard to understand exactly what she is saying, her melodies, along with the rich sounds of the keyboard and Alex Scally’s guitar, make the album more than worth listening to. The tracks are diverse, ranging from somber to dramatic. “Silver Soul” is gloomy and emotional, while “Norway” is ethereal. 
5. Sleigh Bells, Treats. Riding the wave of praise from their South by Southwest show, this lo-fi duo released their much anticipated album in May. Some songs are grainy, while others are screechy in an over-excitable, in-your-face type of way. The album is a combination of strength and silliness, with decibel-overloading poppy beats and quirky lyrics that appeal to the masses while still satisfying music connoisseurs.
4. LCD Soundsystem, This Is Happening. Supposedly LCD Soundsystem’s final album, This is Happening certainly leaves listeners something great to remember them by. The album touches on relationships, and has a darker feel than the previous album Sounds of Silver without actually sombering up the melodies. Single “Drunk Girls” seems all fun and games at first, but after paying attention to the lyrics, listeners will realize that the song is infused with deeper realizations.
3. Local Natives, Gorilla Manor. As far as debut albums go, Local Natives could not have done a better job. There is something inexplicably appealing about their raw, heart-wrenching vocals and clever harmonies. Among the twelve tracks is a little gem in the form of a cover of Talking Heads’ “Warning Sign.” Perhaps the most amazing part of the album is how the quintet manages to sound melancholy and lighthearted at the same time. The resulting blend is a unique sound that keeps listeners hooked, leaving the band with a dedicated fan base.
2. Arcade Fire, The Suburbs. It would seem, with this third-straight spectacular album, that Arcade Fire can do no wrong. Somehow, the band always manages to make profound statements accompanied by clever tunes without coating their songs in a layer of depression. The tracks are monumental without being heavy, inspiring listeners to consider the lifestyle of the suburbs. Perhaps one of the most memorable lines about suburban life is in “Sprawl II”: “Sometimes I wonder if the world’s so small, that we can never get away from the sprawl.”
1. Kanye West, My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy. It might seem cliché to put Kanye at the top of a best albums list, but frankly, there is no other place to put Twisted Fantasy. True to its name, the album reveals the inner workings of Kanye’s mind — the somber, the crazy, the honest, and the heartfelt. The tracks range from the aggressive — especially Nicki Minaj’s part in “Monster” — to the candid. Kanye manages to bring out his own humanity, showing us that despite his oftentimes invincible appearance, he has his faults and is well aware of his vulnerability.

“We all know the story.”
So begins the immersion into the world of Swan Lake, as performed by the New York Ballet Company in the movie Black Swan. One dancer, Nina Sayers (portrayed by Natalie Portman), has the talent and the determination to be a star. Her technique is textbook perfection, but her flawlessness breeds an inability to lose herself emotionally in the role of the Black Swan. As the pure and angelic White Swan, Nina is an undeniable choice. But as the White Swan’s evil twin, the seductive Black Swan, Nina is not as convincing.
Nonetheless, she lands the dual role, and performs much to expectation: a perfect White Swan, but an emotionless Black Swan. It’s only when Thomas (Vincent Cassel), the ballet director who does not shy away from sexuality or bold questions, shows his disappointment in her that Nina steps up her game.
Further fueling the fire is Lily (Mila Kunis), an equally beautiful dancer who personifies the Black Swan to a T. Early on, Nina looks at her with disgust, but as the film progresses, Lily tries to help Nina “relax” and show some rebellion. Through drugs, flirtation, and some very not-for-kids girl-on-girl loving, Nina begins to lose herself in the role of the Black Swan. But her goal (“to be perfect”) comes at a price: She is haunted by visions and scarred by scratches. The film’s beginning is a bit slow-moving, but this helps viewers get settled and feel comfortable in the world until, all of a sudden, they’re thrown around turns and dropped off ledges as they spiral downward along with Nina.
And suddenly comes opening night. In the first act as the White Swan, Nina dances with perfect fragility and sensitive vulnerability. However, when Nina returns to her dressing room to prepare for her transition to the evil character, all hell breaks loose.
Nina isn’t discomforted by flying solo. Her desire to be the main dancer often leaves her the subject of snide comments and spiteful glances. Further adding to her anti-fan base is Beth (portrayed by ex-sticky fingers Winona Ryder) as the former prima ballerina and face of the New York Ballet Company. Her subjectively older age has forced her to be replaced by younger and fresher dancers, though to the public, she is “choosing to retire.” Also complicating things is Nina’s mother (Barbara Hershey), an overly controlling former dancer who resorts to morose paintings when she’s not living vicariously through her daughter. Her excessive protection is initially comforting to delicate Nina, but as Nina turns into the Black Swan, this security eventually smothers her, and she rebels violently.
Director Darren Aronofsky takes us on a horrifying and thrilling journey, where the beginning is so far from the finale that you feel a bit exhausted along with the characters, but you also can’t help but thank him. There are genuine thrills in the movie as it warps and confuses the boundaries of reality and consciousness. It’s beautifully filmed (not surprising from the Requiem for a Dream director), and even though the film ends with a standing ovation, you aren’t quite sure if the applause is well deserved or incredibly tragic.

Things are confusingly scary. From UPS’s intimidatingly efficient human and technological infrastructure to the underlying motivations for military operations in the Middle East, things are weird. For something closer to home, let’s just think about the fact that the majority of the music that you’ve ever listened to has most likely been filtered by lossy data compression. Bizarre, right? When was the last time your body and eardrums experienced the real-time creation of music? Even for you audiophiles, when was the last time you experienced the simultaneity of a mallet hitting a timpani and its thunderous vibration? What about the molar-piercing shriek of a live electric guitar? I know, friends, it’s been a while.
Our lives have been devoid of the joy of the experience of music!
In my eyes, this is where live performances play such a crucial role. Shows, recitals, and concerts are great, but to really get at the heart of the matter, why aren’t we singing every day? If you have a friend who likes to sing, let him sing about his trombone sandwiches. If your other friend likes to make up spontaneous songs and funny sounds as she walks to the supermarket, let her! In my mind, there is nothing more intimate than being in the presence of the creation of music. Even if it’s your friend trying to make weird noises with his throat out in the cold while he waits for the bus, it’s absolutely beautiful. As humans, these friends of yours are interpreting the rhythmic patterns and sounds of the musical and non-musical world around them. They’re claiming the essence of those worlds as their own.
My tip to you, friend? If you’ve only been a listener, I highly suggest you try to become a music maker. Pick up an instrument. Sing a made-up song in a new language. And hey, if being a music maker is too tough, just be a noisemaker. You’ll be the better for it, I promise.
Kisses,
Juan

When I first got to Granada, it was a bit overwhelming. My host family did not speak a word of English and they spoke very, very quickly. Needless to say, it took some getting used to. My host family consisted of a mother and her three children, all of whom were in their twenties and living at home. At first this was a bit weird, until I learned that compared to the U.S., there are not many countries that expect children to move out of their houses the minute they hit 18 years of age. Fascinating. But then again, a 29-year-old woman still living with her mother is still a little too strange for me to fully support.
We visited the Alhambra, which is the last remaining Arab fortress in Spain from before the Christian Reconquista. It was really interesting, since that is where Granada gets its prominent Arabic culture and is what the city is known for. From the top of the Alhambra, you can see the entire city of Granada and distinguish its different sections, from the Gypsy caves to the center of the city.
Orientation consisted of three hours of class a day for two weeks of a Spanish language immersion program. Orientation also allowed us to get used to a very odd eating schedule and the way of dress, in addition to learning our way around Granada while still taking some sort of class. This new lifestyle was definitely hard to get used to, considering it was difficult to simply find a person to whom I could speak English.
Orientation ended with a four-day trip to Morocco. We started with the port city of Algeciras — which would make you want to go right back to where you came from. After staying there for one night, we were off to Morocco.
The first place we visited once we got to Morocco was a women’s shelter, which takes in uneducated, troubled, divorced, or abused women. This shelter teaches them a trade — working with textiles in this instance, which is a large market in Morocco — and provides them the opportunity to get a job in that particular trade. We had lunch and discussed many of the women’s views on women in general, marriage, and modernization, topics over which even the program participants disagreed enormously.
Clearly, there was a lot on the agenda. Staying with host families in Morocco was interesting because our host mother didn’t speak a word of English or Spanish (only Arabic and French), which created some difficulty when trying to communicate. Mostly, it was a two-day game of charades.
There was a lot of traveling, but Morocco was a beautiful and very accepting country, especially to a group of American students. The students we spoke to repeatedly emphasized that Morocco was the first nation to recognize the United States as a country, and was the first to have a U.S. embassy outside of the United States. It was as if they were trying to convince us that they were good people and didn’t dislike us, despite a few prejudices some people in the U.S. share. It was comforting that they were able to look at a group of American students and just see us, not what our country represented, whereas in America, we tend to do the complete opposite.
Some people in other programs made vows to only speak Spanish whilst there; however, with my busy schedule on top of the fact that no one in my house spoke English, this vow seemed redundant and unnecessary.
The most shocking part of living abroad was the difference in what was considered “newsworthy” compared to that of the U.S. Conflicts like the one between Morocco and the Western Sahara, which would not even be mentioned in most newspapers in the United States, were front-page news abroad.
I highly recommend studying abroad when given the option. I got to live in Spain and practice Spanish while traveling every weekend to various countries including Ireland, Italy, Austria, Morocco, and Portugal. I surfed for the first time in Lagos and played ultimate Frisbee in a foreign country. It is definitely an experience that I will never forget.

Is your 8 a.m. class in Wean Hall consistently ruining your mood? Perhaps the seasonal lack of sunlight is casting a cloud of dreariness over your day. Between the new semester, the cold weather, and the short days, January may feel like a fairly dismal month thus far. However, there are some methods to boost your mood during the winter season.
Wake Up on Time
As tempting as it may be to hit the snooze button on your alarm just a few more times, that extra hour of sleep may be contributing to your winter blues. Oversleeping has been linked to depression, and, according to WebMD, can make your depression worse, since regular sleep patterns are important to the recovery process. So instead of sleeping in until 4 p.m. next weekend, try setting your alarm for 11 a.m. and spending more time awake. You might be surprised by how much better you feel, and how much more you might get accomplished that day.
Go to the Gym
Exercise releases endorphins, which are neurotransmitters that cause you to feel euphoric. If the idea of working out seems daunting, try to make it a social event: Find a friend who would be willing to go jog on the treadmills in the University Center with you once a week. Not only will you get to socialize, but you’ll also get off the treadmill feeling ready to take on the world.
Turn on the Lights
One of the main reasons people feel depressed during the winter is the lack of sunlight. According to MayoClinic.com, the decrease of sunlight during the winter may cause your serotonin levels to drop, directly affecting your mood. Although artificial light isn’t a perfect substitute for natural sunlight, staying in bright environments will help minimize depressive symptoms. So, next time you’re playing Call of Duty or writing a paper, don’t do it in the dark.
Eat More Tuna
Drinking hot chocolate and eating comfort food for dinner may sound appealing, but be careful: Your comforting diet may in fact be the reason you’re feeling so down. According to economii.com, sugary treats and foods with simple carbohydrates, such as bread, may lift your mood temporarily, but will eventually cause your blood sugar to crash, leaving you feeling even more cranky than before. Furthermore, a diet consisting of nothing but carbohydrates can leave you highly susceptible to colds and the flu. Instead, try eating more vegetables and foods high in protein, such as turkey, chicken, or tuna. Not only will they give you more energy, but proteins are also high in tryptophan, which induces hormones that make you feel happier.
Having a consistent sleep schedule, exercising, and eating well should help bust your wintertime blues, or at the very least tide you over until spring break. However, if you find that the wintertime regularly causes you to feel overly anxious or depressed, you might have a medical condition known as seasonal affective disorder. If you think this is the case, Carnegie Mellon’s Counseling and Psychological Services has plenty of resources to help you feel your best throughout the colder months in Pittsburgh.

The first noticeable characteristic of “Rain: A Tribute to The Beatles” when walking into Heinz Hall was the audience. Although The Beatles are cross-generational, on Tuesday night Pittsburgh’s older generation dominated the audience. Now, a production packed with the city’s baby boomers may not sound particularly appealing, but really, there is no other way to listen to 1960s music live. Listening to The Beatles with a crowd who actually lived in the ’60s, one begins to see their younger selves shine through. One becomes privy to watching an overweight senior couple perform a cross between a Flower Child dance and the Twist and laugh at jokes about drugs.
From Jan. 11 to 16, Heinz Hall presented “Rain: A Tribute to The Beatles,” an interactive, live concert hailed by the Denver Post as “the closest thing to seeing The Beatles live today.” Annerin Productions, together with Magic Arts & Entertainment/TIX Corporation, ensured a fun concert with a band that sounded true to the originals they emulated.
Tuesday night’s show was somewhat tailored to an older audience. The music was not deafening, to the chagrin of some teenagers there. Despite these teenagers’ unhappiness, it was a good choice; being able to actually hear the performers play and sing gave credit to their work as impersonators and helped enhance the experience of listening to live, good-quality music. The set list included songs such as “Let It Be,” “Hey Jude,” and “Sergeant Pepper’s Lonely Hearts Club Band.”
The band was made up of Jim Irizarry (acting as John Lennon), Mac Ruffing (Paul McCartney), Jimmy Pou (George Harrison), and Douglas Cox (Ringo Starr). The performers were older, so the further the program went into The Beatles’ later music, the more they seemed to resemble the actual Beatles members. Irizarry was spot-on: Not only did he look like Lennon, but he sounded just like him as well. Ruffing had a tough role; while he looked just like an older version of Paul McCartney, his voice was a little too high. One of the best performers in the group perhaps was Pou, a Cuban man who was a skilled guitar player and whose love of music shone through his performance. Cox was a solid drummer, and, for two of the songs, a solid singer. 
The multimedia portion of the show was one of the highlights of the night. The images and videos that played during the show served as a historical testament both to The Beatles’ overwhelming presence in the 1960s and to the dramatic, world-changing events of their time. The program was ordered chronologically, so as the performers changed costumes, the music evolved and the projected images fast-forwarded in history. As one watched, one slowly became aware of being an outsider to a time of intense activity.
All in all, going to see “Rain” was essentially going to watch a pretty good cover band get all the applause and accolades for music written by possibly the most successful band in history. That is not to say that it was not a fun and entertaining experience, or that the musicians were somehow subpar or sloppy. It is to say, though, that no one could experience the intense and mind-boggling enormity of a live Beatles concert today.

Dear Hoskins Brothers,
Last night, I was at a friendly social event. After a few hours of revelry with compatriots, I went to the refreshments table to receive another beverage. However, upon reaching said table, two gentlemen inquired as to my knowledge of any fellow socialites, refusing to allow me to refill my glass until I answered. When I informed them they were being rather rude, they asked me to leave. I, hoping to avoid confrontation, did so. My dear sir, how should I handle such an encounter in the future?
Sincerely,
Gingerly Expecting Nice Time
Dear Gent,
You probably did something to offend them. I would suggest at your next “friendly social event” you have a little less “refreshment.” The two gentlemen in question seemed to be looking for a fight, and you provided them an easy opportunity. You acted correctly in avoiding the fight, but you probably could have stopped the conversation sooner. Either only go to events where you actually know people, or instead inform those hosts that upon entering, you had already paid the proper price of admission.
Always be polite,
Brian Hoskins
Dear Hoskins Brothers,
I’m having trouble getting back into the swing of things now that I’m back at school. I keep getting distracted by the Internet whenever I sit down to work. Do you have any tips on good study habits?
Sincerely,
Easily Distracted Dunce
Dear EDD,
Congratulations, you’re lazy. The Internet just offers you an easy way to avoid working. If you find yourself visiting a few sites all the time, there are some easy ways to block those sites. If you use a Mac or Linux, you can easily edit your host file so you cannot connect to those sites. If you use Chrome, there’s a great extension called ChromeNanny that limits your daily access to any websites you choose. There are similar extensions for Firefox. A quick Google search should bring up any number of them. 
Try making a schedule, so you know what to do and when to do it. Give yourself some time to play and time to work. If you know what you need to be doing, you won’t have an excuse to procrastinate. You just have to be disciplined.
Buckle down,
Patrick Hoskins

The Tartan offered a $10 prize for the lucky contestant who submitted the best new cover design for the paper. Drawings would be judged based on “attractiveness, appropriateness, technique, and suitableness for reproduction.” Are they looking for artwork or trying to find a mate?

The Carnegie Tech football team lost in the last 45 seconds of the General Electric College Bowl this past Sunday to Hobart and William Smith Colleges. In losing, the Tartans missed out on a $1,500 scholarship. But don’t worry, lads, I’m sure there will be plenty more bowl games in our future.

The big news this week was that Carnegie Mellon switched phone companies. Woo! Apparently, AT&T just couldn’t provide the clear and clean quality that MCI can as our long-distance service provider. Fun Fact: This was also the year we switched to the 268 phone number prefix, for you trivia buffs.

Carnegie Mellon installed the wonderful card access system this year, cutting ties with its previous policy of leaving all academic buildings open to the public 24 hours a day. Because, let’s be honest, who out there would ever want to take advantage of that?

The men’s basketball team got off to a 14–2 start this year, including an upset over Princeton University, who had been on a 27–0 run against Division III teams until they faced the Tartans. Not quite up to the recent UConn women’s basketball team streak, but we’ll take what we can get here.

The Tillman Story
Thursday, Jan. 20
8 10 12
Pat Tillman was a former football player who declined a multimillion-dollar contract with an NFL team to enlist in the United States Army following the Sept. 11, 2001 attacks. The Tillman Story chronicles his journey from his decision to enlist to when he was killed by friendly fire in Afghanistan in 2004. But what followed this heroic man’s death was a flood of lies and deceit that resulted in outrage from his friends and family. Director Amir Bar-Lev explores the military’s decision to initially report that Tillman was killed by enemy fire and cover up all evidence to the contrary. What results is a riveting and can’t-miss documentary.
Scott Pilgrim vs. The World
Friday, Jan. 21

Michael Cera as Scott Pilgrim rolls all of Cera’s previous roles into one in this 2010 comedy based on the graphic novel of the same name. In the film, Pilgrim meets the girl of his dreams (sound familiar?) and, in order to win her over, must defeat her seven evil exes, each of whom attempts to kill him. The movie is played out as an arcade game with several references that video game fanboys are sure to love. Despite being well received by critics, the movie did poorly at the box office, not even making back its budget. Make sure that doesn’t happen at Dollar Movie this week, people!
Trainspotting
Saturday, Jan. 22

Trainspotting is a 1996 film directed by Danny Boyle about drug addiction and life in an economically depressed area of Britain. Based on the novel of the same name, the film follows Renton, a man deeply embedded in drug culture, as he tries to clean up his act and get out of Dodge, so to speak. It’s a very surreal movie, with scenes of wild extremes that help push along the controversial and sometimes trippy story. Trainspotting was also recently voted the best film in Scottish history and has a strong cult following. Fun Fact: The movie has nothing to do with trains.
Paranormal Activity 2

This sequel to the horror movie of the same name (minus the “2,” of course) may be even more freaky and terrifying than the original. Dubbed a “parallel prequel” to the first film (whatever that means), this flick goes along somewhat like the first one. Strange events begin to happen to a couple, so they set up cameras to figure out what could possibly be going on. Similar to the way the original made back an incredible percentage of its budget, this sequel earned almost 60 times what it took to make it. Fun Fact: I am absolutely petrified of seeing any movies like this one, so you’ll have to see it yourself to figure out what happens.

Just the way everyone has a favorite burger place or coffee spot, they also seem to have a different opinion on which is the best sushi restaurant. Pittsburgh, being the land-locked city that it is, doesn’t give too many options to choose from, and most students either settle for the boxed sushi available on campus or go without it, not knowing that one of the city’s best places, Chaya, is right up the street.
The nondescript windows facing out onto Murray Avenue leave this place known only to people who have sought the best sushi in Pittsburgh. A small restaurant, Chaya is barely able to hold 30 or so people and is packed on most nights of the week. The restaurant is warm and cozy, and the servers are quick to get the drinks while customers decide on their main course. 
The menu is extensive, with traditional Japanese fare from appetizers to tempura to teriyaki to fish, ending with mochi for dessert. The sushi and sashimi menu is equally long and has a lot of variety. Beginning with appetizers, gyoza is a great place to start. This dish consists of pork and cabbage dumplings that are perfectly pan-fried, leaving just enough moisture to offset the crisp outside. Seaweed salad is a unique twist on the traditional garden salad and the grated seaweed leaves have much more texture than taste. 
While ordering sushi, there are two ways to go about doing it. One can either get a combination platter or order from the a la carte menu. There are many different platters to choose from: deluxe and regular platters, as well as fish-specific platters to suit all desires. One of the favorites is the sushi boat, and it is recommended that at least three people share this dish. The tuna at Chaya is renowned for its flavor and tenderness, and it only takes one bite of the fish to realize that this is as fresh as fish gets in Pittsburgh and that it is really good. For a little kick, opt for the spicy tuna. To make it hot, a mayonnaise and chili pepper mix is daubed on the fish, adding just the right amount of spice to make this one of Chaya’s top orders. 
The shrimp tempura roll is a combination of a piece of shrimp tempura, rolled in traditional sticky rice and covered in an addicting eel sauce. The shrimp is covered in batter and cooked to a golden hue, giving the roll a crispy texture, while the sweet eel sauce plays off the shrimp flavor, leaving the mouth watering for more.
Other notable rolls are the cucumber roll, California roll, and salmon roll. The cucumber roll is crunchy, and the cucumber slices are refreshing, so this choice is available for vegetarians or those who want some variety. The California roll is the standard starter sushi, and Chaya makes this combination of crab, cucumber, avocado, and fish egg well. Finally, the salmon roll, much like the tuna, is full of flavor. The salmon is easy to chew and goes well with a dab of soy sauce.
An important thing that one can tell from the sushi at Chaya is that it is fresh. Fumio Yasuzawa, the executive chef and owner of Chaya, ships his fish in from Japan and New York. He has a rule that fish should never be frozen but chilled on ice until served at the restaurant. Since the restaurant opened in 2001, word has gotten out about this place and there is usually a line waiting for a table. Surprisingly, the prices at the restaurant are quite affordable. Regular rolls cost no more than $5, and it is reasonable to expect to spend under $30 for a dinner for two. This is an unbeatable value for this quality of sushi.
Chaya is located at 2104 Murray Ave. in Squirrel Hill. Check out their website for more information: www.chayausa.com.

A lot of attention has been given to the G20 occurring this week in Pittsburgh. Stories have been written about the world leaders attending, the security measures, the protesters, and even a little about what is going to be discussed during the international conference. What may be even more interesting, though, are the cartoons being sketched about the world event. Drawn to the Summit is an exhibition of political cartoons from around the world that opened last Friday at The Andy Warhol Museum and captures the global perspective of the G20.
The exhibit features cartoons from nearly all of the countries in the G20, including some from the European Union. Going around the room, one can put together a geopolitical picture that describes themes ranging from global warming to world hunger to economic troubles. Each country has a different style of drawing used in the cartoons, yet the real art is in the message that is being conveyed.
Some countries opt for more conservative messages or issues while others freely speak their mind. The Canadian cartoon “North American Dinosaur” by Brian Gable portrays the North American auto industry as dinosaur bones while a teacher credits their downfall to “brains the size of peas.” In contrast, a French cartoon, “Prime Real Estate” by Jean Plantu, shockingly depicts a plane labeled “American Credit” flying into three towers with the flags of the EU, France, and Germany. The different attitudes reflect each nation’s view of America and its own position in the world.
“Silent Tsunami” by Argentinean artist Alberto Sabat shows a young boy starving in Africa, not afraid of an oncoming tsunami. Sabat’s award-winning cartoon is a statement about how the media ignores the fact that there are more people dying of hunger every day than did as a result of the 2004 tsunami. Another Argentinean, Sergio Langer, makes fun of the George W. Bush shoe incident by having missiles fly in one direction while shoes fly in the other. This cartoon is creatively named “Missiles and Shoes.”
Pittsburgh Post-Gazette editorial cartoonist Rob Rogers and art historian Sylvia Rhor came up with the idea to have this exhibit when it was announced that the G20 was coming to Pittsburgh. As everyone was trying to come up with a project for the G20, the two were talking with Toonseum executive director Joe Wos, who introduced the idea for an exhibit on global cartoons. Both Rogers and Rhor then went looking for support and were able to get The Pittsburgh Foundation to provide funding and The Warhol to provide the space.
Then came a frantic blur of activity as they reached out across the globe for cartoons to use for the exhibit. Rogers wanted to “show an alternative to just the leaders coming” to Pittsburgh. Rhor, who is fluent in multiple languages, was able to contact many artists from around the world in order to bring in international cartoons. After they received nearly 250 cartoons, they tried to choose those that would give a complete world perspective.
What emerged is a collage of world views on display at The Andy Warhol Museum. There are strong feelings of anti-Americanism, and Wall Street gets its fair share of jabbing, but the most prevalent theme is the unjust exclusivity of the G20. While some mock the G20 as really being the G8 plus 12 guests, others comment on the lack of participation from the rest of the developing world. One surprising feature of the exhibit is that it does not take the side of the peasant or the corporate giant. It does a good job of objectively looking at the issues and presenting them.
The exhibit, aside from representing worldviews, also presents cartoons from Pittsburgh local newspapers. One local cartoon pokes more fun at yinzers, people who speak Pittsburgh English, than anyone else. “Git Aht!” by Randy Bish shows a Pittsburgh reporter reacting to the news in Pittsburghese that Pittsburgh was chosen to host the G20.
Rogers will be posting G20-related sketches on his blog as he covers the event. Follow his blog at community.post-gazette.com/blogs/robrogers/default.aspx.
Drawn to the Summit is on display through Oct. 18. The Andy Warhol is located at 117 Sandusky Street on the North Shore. Carnegie Mellon students get free admission with their student ID.

Pinned between a rock and a hard place for six days, Carnegie Mellon grad Aron Ralston (EE '97) did the unimaginable: severed his own arm to save himself. But as incredible as his world-famous ordeal was, Ralston considers the publicity tour for the book that recounts his story, not the ordeal itself, as his greatest test of endurance. "It [touring] was the most rigorous endurance event of my life. I'd often only get three hours of sleep a night during those three months of solid touring. Forty-five cities over eight countries in 90 days, 300 interviews, 50 speeches," said Ralston in a recent phone interview.
In his book, Between a Rock and a Hard Place, Ralston recounts being trapped by an 800-pound boulder in a remote southeastern Utah canyon. He had taken an impromptu trip to the high deserts of Utah to hike, bike, and connect with the outdoors he loves, but failed to leave even a general itinerary of his destination and activities with his roommates. This mistake, coupled with an affinity for risk-taking, impeded the rescue effort that could have located him before he was forced to sever his own arm with the dull blades of a multi-use tool.
In late April 2002, Ralston was hiking through a narrow canyon when he encountered a 12-foot dropoff. Just a couple of feet down from the ledge was a boulder the size of a bus tire, wedged between the walls of the canyon. Ralston tried descending via the boulder after his initial tests indicated it was stable, but while he was hanging over its side, the rock began to shift and fall. In order to keep from being fatally crushed, Ralston threw up his arms and tried to jump out of the way. While this saved his life, it was at the cost of his right arm, which ended up pinned between the boulder and the canyon wall.
Despite almost a week of exposure, shock, starvation, and dehydration, Ralston survived. As a result of that day in 2002, he has broken into the spotlight, first as the story of his accident and extraordinary rescue became known, and then again after he published his book.
"I recognized the power of the story almost right away," he says. "All the letters and reactions people were having showed me that the miracle was not just for me and my family to enjoy." Where perhaps otherwise Ralston would have simply healed and returned to his risk-taking lifestyle, the responses he was getting from all over the world showed that he had a message people wanted to hear. 
"Life is ten percent what happens, and 90 percent how you react. You have to transform adversity into possibility."
For Ralston, the ultimate adversity he faced was in making the decision to cut off his trapped right arm. Ralston couldn't bring himself to perform the grotesque and desperate surgery until the very end, when he was literally on the edge of death, and had even carved his own epitaph in the rock above his head.
In his book, Ralston writes of the event, "Miserable, I watch another empty hour pass by.... I have nothing whatsoever to do. I have no life. Only in action does my life approximate anything more than existence. Without any other task or stimulus, I'm no longer living, no longer surviving. I'm just waiting."
It was in waiting and raging against his situation that he realized how he could escape. "I scream out in pure hate, shrieking as I batter my body to and fro against the canyon walls, losing every bit of composure that I've struggled so intensely to maintain," his book reads. "Then I feel my arm bend unnaturally in the un-budging grip of the chockstone. And epiphany strikes me with the magnificent glory of a holy intervention and instantly brings my seizure to a halt: If I torque my arm far enough, I can break my forearm bones."
Just over an hour later, Ralston had successfully snapped both bones in his forearm, constructed a tourniquet to stop blood-loss, and cut through his skin, flesh, and nerves to free himself and give him a chance of rescue.
Months later, Ralston's book hit number nine on The New York Times' list of bestselling non-fiction books, and he makes enough money to continue the free lifestyle he loves by doing speaking engagements all over the country. "It's my business now," he says. "I do a good deal of corporate and non-profit speaking. I tell young kids who are getting more freedom and responsibility that they have the power to create their reality, but also have the accountability for what they create."
Ralston spent a year writing the book, researching what happened from the perspective of his family, friends, and rescuers.
"It was difficult; I had to pour myself into those six days I spent trapped," he says, speaking about the process of writing his story. "Getting the details right was the most difficult. I had been awake for six days straight." Remembering exactly what happened at what point was a challenge mitigated slightly by the video camera he used to record scattered moments of his ordeal.
Beyond that, he had to find out what he couldn't observe while trapped. "I had to track down the rescuers and try to rebuild these branching shotgun events. It was a huge introspective detective journey." He also had to relive it with his parents. "It wasn't so hard to talk to them about it, since we had gone over it so many times by then. But watching the video with my mother was the most difficult."
In the first of many video scenes Ralston recorded while trapped in the canyon, he attempts to explain what it was he was seeking in this trip and his life. "I don't know what it is about me that's brought me to this. But this is ... what I've been after. I go out looking for adventure and risk so I can feel alive. But I go out by myself and I don't tell someone where I'm going, that's just dumb. If someone knew, if I'd have been with someone else, there would probably already be help on the way. Even if I'd just talked to a ranger or left a note on my truck. Dumb, dumb, dumb."
While hard to relive, the effort was worth it, he says. "It's very hard to move forward in your life when you're constantly having to relive the past. But while it was exhausting and tiring, it was also inspiring in many other ways. I got to see and hear other people's inspirations. For every thousand people that hear what I have to say are a thousand different messages delivered. I have a plaque on my wall sent to me by a little girl. It's made from plywood and painted silver, and says "Yo [sic] got to keep on living." Other people have told me that the most courageous thing I did wasn't to cut off my arm, but to have the courage to quit my job at Intel and live the life I want, as a ski bum."
Even so, Ralston did his best not to let the fame go to his head. "My friends became even more important to me during that time," he says. "They were my balance. I took time to see them, which is part of why I slept so little. They kept me in check when I'd slip into publicity mode."
When asked what exactly publicity mode entailed, he said, "I'd dominate the conversation, or start talking about how I was hanging out with a famous actress after the Letterman show. They'd say, 'Yeah, yeah, shut up Aron,' and we'd go back to normal."
College buddy Chris Adukaitis (CE ?97) observes that Ralston is still the active, spunky guy he was back in school. "We called him Forrest Gump. He was a very smart guy, even by CMU standards. But he ran everywhere. If you saw anyone running around on campus, you could safely assume it was Aron."
So has all the stress of fame and the crazy schedules been worth it? Ralston says yes. Talking to people and hearing their experiences "really brightens my outlook," he adds. He continues to live a life that gives him satisfaction.
But despite the pressure, he continues to promote his message by speaking and touring. Fame, it seems, is the price Ralston pays for surviving and living how he wants. "It's like that line from 'Road Runner' by Jerry Garcia: love the life you live, live the life you love."
"I wouldn't have said I could have [survived the accident] if you asked me before, but I did," he says. "It came from inside. It's the spark of the divine in each of us."

Laptops: They’re small, efficient, and currently adorn the first floor of Hunt Library. Their owners are typing, stooped over, with some biting their nails, even though it’s Friday and the first week back to school. Yet it has become a necessity rather than a luxury to own a laptop while attending college. It is the future, and Carnegie Mellon takes the lead in computer-based discovery as the No. 1 graduate program in computer science as determined by U.S. News and World Report in 2010.
One such discovery stems from Carnegie Mellon’s very own Online Learning Initiative (OLI). The OLI currently offers a slew of free public online courses, from Modern Biology to Logic & Proofs to Chemistry. The site’s headline gives its purpose as, “[…] to enact the kind of dynamic, flexible, and responsive instruction that fosters learning.” And although one may think it is just supplementary materials, that would be wrong. In fact, the OLI builds a foundation for a nationwide goal to improve learning in introductory courses. 
Last year, the OLI at Carnegie Mellon was granted $4 million from the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, Lumina Foundation for Education, and the Hewlett Foundation to develop educational opportunities.
In an article published by The Chronicle of Higher Education, the state of Washington has vowed to offer online materials as text. It comes as no surprise that the OLI’s free public materials are on the corkboard. Students who have taken Modern Chemistry II will be familiar with the Virtual Lab, a Java-based web environment to simulate experiments that one can perform in a physical lab. In 2010, over 100,000 experiments using the online virtual lab were performed across the globe.
Hannah Wirtshafter, a junior science and humanities scholar, described her experience with the virtual lab. “I would say it was both helpful and overly frustrating. The actual logistics of using the program — drag and drop, right click this, left click this, etc. — were annoying and unnecessary.”
The Virtual Lab was first created in 1999, written by Carnegie Mellon computer science undergraduates, and is currently maintained by professor Dave Yaron’s research group in the Department of Chemistry.
“Despite this student’s frustration, the Virtual Lab has been shown in studies to be very beneficial in student learning and understanding. Our goal is to help motivate students and make chemistry exciting by connecting concepts to real world applications,” said Michael Karabinos, director of the Chemcollective and part of Yaron’s group.
Another initiative of the OLI gained popularity in 2009, when Carnegie Mellon students were given the opportunity to take an accelerated (six-week) statistics course. The bulk of the course was taught through online modules and homework assignments with supplementary instruction. No textbook was required. “The main challenge with the accelerated course was the mental preparation for realizing that it was, in fact, accelerated,” said Diana Ramos, a junior history and psychology major.
With different courses come varying challenges. No individual student learns in exactly the same fashion. However, the future of learning seems to reside in the hands of instructional technologists, groups like Yaron’s that work with the OLI to develop online materials. 
Today, a direct link between Washington educators and Yaron’s group exists through letters of support for future grants with statements such as, “Your proposed materials fit in well with the goals of the Open Course Library Project and my introductory chemistry courses at Bellevue College.”
Other universities such as the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), which is tied for a No. 1 ranking in computer science, have developed over 2,000 free online courses that offer lectures, assignments, and quizzes through the OpenCourseWare (OCW) site at www.ocw.mit.edu. 
MIT is quoted alongside Carnegie Mellon in the Chronicle of Higher Education’s article as providing a “smorgasbord” of supplementary material. 
However, the two universities differ in that Carnegie Mellon hones in on interactive online modules and programs like the Virtual Lab. The OLI Dashboard also provides students and instructors with real-time feedback about progress and learning goals.
The selling point? In the article, Cable Green of the Washington State Board for Community & Technical Colleges says students pay $1,000 a year for books. At Carnegie Mellon, students taking an introductory chemistry course can expect to pay between $88 and $180 for a textbook, in addition to $20,750 for a semester’s tuition. Furthermore, textbook publishers compete with non-profit developers such as WileyPlus, which offers online supplements for courses like Differential Equations for $82.95. The article suggests students in two-year colleges in Washington will only pay $30 for access to the Open Course Library, which will provide all educational materials.
The future of education may reside in discovery, but the way in which knowledge is conveyed is yet to be determined. Yaron’s group suggests a modern alternative to learning: hybrid courses (like the accelerated statistics course), in which students participate in traditional lectures but reinforce knowledge through interactive computer-based supplements.
The question remains: How long will it take Washington to implement the Open Course Library? The website is up, with instructors working diligently to collaborate with institutions like Carnegie Mellon. Textbook publishers, beware.

“Come, come, whoever you are, come and join us” is the mantra of the Rumi Dialogue Club, a student organization here at Carnegie Mellon that centers itself around a message of love, tolerance, and respect for life. The club bases its values off the works and teachings of 13th-century poet Jalal ad-D n Muhammad Rumi, a devout Muslim and Sufi mystic who believed in the transformative and unifying powers of love. The Rumi Dialogue Club puts these beliefs into action by organizing workshops and seminars that address and resolve cultural differences. They also offer Turkish language classes in a continuing effort to “bridge cultural gaps between Carnegie Mellon students.”
The club recently had an event in the University Center on Jan. 12 where anyone interested in learning more about Rumi and Turkish culture could come and participate. UC Connan, where the event was held, was packed and lively with old and new friends chatting and catching up. 
True to their message of acceptance and tolerance, the crowd of attendees was diverse in age and ethnicity, gathered together through the commonality of a thirst for learning and a love of Turkish food. The majority of the event was dedicated to distinguished guest professor Emine Yeniterzi from Turkey’s Rumi Social Research Center and professor Nihat Polat from Duquesne University’s English as a Second Language program.
Yeniterzi spoke at length and in great depth about the inspiring namesake of the club and how the teachings of Rumi are still applicable to living a meaningful life in the modern world. Her speech addressed many aspects of life on which Rumi gave sage advice in the form of poetry, some of which included self-improvement, education and spiritual development, time management, and struggles against adversity. 
Lasting hundreds of years, much of his poetry focuses on continual transformation in an effort to become more unified with God and people. According to a famous poem written by Rumi, “Discard the old if you desire newness” (Mathnawi II: 1270). The poem typifies the college experience where, especially at Carnegie Mellon, transformation and modernization play key roles.
As Yeniterzi pointed out throughout her speech, Rumi was not really a poet, but an educator who used the medium of poetry to convey his ideas. He stressed the importance of critical thinking as a way of life, saying, “Reason is what enables one to have vision to follow on the path of transformation and self-improvement” (Mathnawi I: 2582). For those who value education, espeically students, these words are indeed potent and pertinent. To use Yeniterzi’s analogy, “If the world is a body, knowledge is what gives it life.”
Yeniterzi’s speech was followed by a hauntingly beautiful nay, or reed flute, performancwe by Serkan Imisiker, a proficient musician of the flute, after which Polat gave a speech titled “Why Learn Turkish?” Polat’s talk was a lighthearted yet sincere argument for learning Turkish as a way to get an edge on the current job market and as an expansion of one’s own worldview. 
After Polat’s speech the meeting ended with an ebru, or water marbling, performance given by Muyesser Demir, an artist proficient in the practice. Some of Demir’s work, as well as the club’s mission statement and upcoming events, can be seen online at the Rumi Dialogue Club’s Facebook page, www.facebook.com/pages/Rumi-Dialogue-Club/177832852240181.

Martin Luther King Jr. Day, falling annually on the third Monday of January, represents more than just a three-day weekend to the Carnegie Mellon campus. Observed nationwide since 2000, the holiday encourages people to reflect on the past, specifically the Civil Rights Movement, and to consider King’s messages in the context of current times. This year, Carnegie Mellon is hosting a range of events in observance of the holiday and of the legacy of Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.
With subjects ranging from King’s life to social justice along with activities encompassing both formal lectures and poetry slams, Carnegie Mellon’s Martin Luther King Jr. Day celebrations offer something for everyone. Events begin at 12:30 p.m., and afternoon classes have been canceled so that students and faculty can participate. 
“It lets people go to the events in a frame of mind that is relaxing and not stressful and to get something out of the events,” said Natalie French, a junior civil and environmental engineering major. “It is really important to be aware and able to participate.”
Today’s activities kick off at 12:30 p.m. with a School of Drama tribute to King and diversity at Carnegie Mellon in the University Center (12:30–1:30 p.m., Rangos Hall). Afterwards, there will be a presentation of the “Martin Luther King Jr. Day Writing Awards” (1:30–2:30 p.m., McConomy Auditiorium), in which students from Carnegie Mellon and local high schools will share their “personal narratives dealing with individual experiences with racial difference and discrimination.” 
The students are recipients of writing awards sponsored by the Carnegie Mellon Creative Writing Program, Student Affairs, and the Office of the President.” A more informal Poetry Slam will occur in King’s honor at 7 p.m. in Skibo Coffeehouse. “The events featuring the arts and people expressing their own experiences are what I am excited about,” said Adelaide Agyemang, a College of Fine Arts first-year. “To be honest, that is where I feel [King’s] legacy really resonates.”
The arts are not the only way that Carnegie Mellon seeks to engage the campus community with King’s memory. A keynote address, titled ‘The Economic Legacy of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.’ will be presented by Dr. Julianne Malveaux at 5 p.m. in Rangos Hall. 
Malveaux is currently the president of Bennett College for Women. According to her website, www.juliannemalveaux.com, she is “recognized for her progressive and insightful observations.” 
Laura Hammel, a first-year math major, plans to attend, “I had never really considered the economics of the civil rights movement.... It is cool to be at a school where these sorts of opportunities are available.” Presenting alongside her are student speakers Maggie Soderholm, a third year philosophy and statistics double-major, and Appiah Adomako, a Heinz graduate student. The address will be followed by a reception.
Through events such as “The Drum Major Instinct: a Social Justice Experiment,” “Community Conversation: Replacing Despair and Hopelessness with Hope and Opportunity,” and a candlelight procession in honor of the civil rights movement, participants have the opportunity to consider new ways to promote civil rights within the Pittsburgh community. 
“The Drum Major Instinct: a Social Justice Experiment” features a lunch and panel hosted from 1–3 p.m. in Peter/Wright/McKenna. The focus is on motivating community members to take action through “an interactive experience that will include an Oxfam ‘World Hunger Banquet,’ a panel dialogue with local young Pittsburgh leaders who are creating change in the city and an open discussion with students about their engagement in social justice issues.” 
Meanwhile, “Community Conversation: Replacing Despair and Hopelessness with Hope and Opportunity” also features a panel discussion relating to modern civil rights work and racial equality (2:30–4 p.m., McConomy Auditorium).
From 12:30 to 4:30 p.m., the Carnegie Mellon Bookstore and Hunt Library will also be featuring relevant literary works, documentaries will be screening in the first and second floor lobbies of the University Center, and artwork by the 4th grade class at Lindon Academy will be displayed in the first floor of the University Center. 
All events are open to Carnegie Mellon students and the greater Pittsburgh community free of charge.

Every year during spring break, students accepted into the Initiating Meaningful Pittsburgh and Qatar Ties (IMPAQT) program travel to Carnegie Mellon’s Qatar campus to interact with local students while socially and culturally experiencing the country. Through an initiative of Housing and Dining Services, however, all students will now have a unique chance to learn about Carnegie Mellon’s partner campus without even leaving Pittsburgh. Premiering in March, the Qatar Room will be centrally located in a dining space in Resnik House known as the “pod.” The room will offer glimpses of student life in Doha, Qatar and feature programs and activities between the two campuses. The room will also enable open communication through the use of programming and video conferencing.
The idea first originated when Kim Abel, director of Housing and Dining Services, listened to a talk by Renee Camerlengo, associate dean of Student Affairs, about the IMPAQT program between Carnegie Mellon and Qatar. Students who apply and are accepted into the program begin an 18-month long commitment culminating in a spring break trip to Qatar, as well as assisting in selecting the next group of students. Inspired, Abel spoke to both Camerlengo and Dean Tucker of Carnegie Mellon Qatar (CMU-Q) about the possibility of a dedicated space within the Pittsburgh campus where students could interact both visually and physically with students from Doha.
“It is our hope that when you walk in the space you will feel in some way that you have walked onto the Doha campus. We hope the furnishings, fixtures, and exhibits reflect the culture, programs, and people of CMU-Q. Renee Camerlengo and the IMPAQT students will provide ongoing assistance with creating ongoing and ever-changing displays,” Abel said. “It is also our hope that the students who visit the Pittsburgh campus from Doha will feel welcomed and enjoy seeing a part of CMU-Q in Pittsburgh.”
Turning this interaction into a reality has involved the commitment of Housing and Dining Services, students and staff from both campuses, and Media Technology Services to prepare the programming and video conferencing equipment. As part of the partner program, Tucker has also presented the idea of a partner “Pittsburgh” room to be located in Qatar. “There are hopes that this will become a joint programming space and a venue for students who are involved with IMPAQT to engage with students in Pittsburgh about life in Qatar. It should also be a comfortable reminder of home for students from the Qatar campus when they are visiting Pittsburgh,” said Bryan Koval, the housefellow for Resnik.
Mridula Nadamuni, a sophomore in biological sciences, had such a chance to meet several Qatari students on campus during the Odyssey Program for sophomores the first week of January. 
“I think it’s a great idea because it will be one more step toward bridging the gap between the two campuses. It would be wonderful for students to have a similar experience in meeting Qatari students on campus,” Nadamuni said.
Tarik Raed, an alumnus of the IMPAQT program and a senior in business administration, agreed and commented that “through dialogue and exposure, the Qatar Room will help to bridge the gap between the two campuses and allow students to understand that the CMU community stretches across the globe. The room will give students, both in Pittsburgh and in Qatar, the opportunity to hear about each others’ experiences and connect in ways that they previously could not.”

Science fellowships awarded to three faculty members
The American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS) awarded 2010 fellowships to three Carnegie Mellon University faculty members: John Lehoczky, Manuela Veloso, and Larry Wasserman.
The new AAAS fellows will be presented with an official certificate and a rosette pin at the AAAS Fellows Forum on Feb. 19 during the 2011 AAAS Annual Meeting in Washington, D.C. 
John Lehoczky is the dean of the College of Humanities and Social Sciences and the Thomas Lord Professor of Statistics. The AAAS is recognizing his “significant and sustained contributions to the theory and applications of stochastic processes, particularly to the modeling of real-time computer systems and financial markets, and for his outstanding contributions to education both in the classroom and through academic administration.”
Manuela Veloso is being recognized for her “distinguished contributions to artificial intelligence, especially advances in automated planning, multi-agent systems, and robotics.” Veloso is the Herbert A. Simon Professor of Computer Science.
Larry Wasserman, a professor of statistics and machine learning, will be honored because of his “fundamental contributions to statistical theory and statistical machine learning, to applications of statistics in astronomy and genomics and to statistical pedagogy.”
Two linguistics professors attend national conference
Carnegie Mellon professors Barbara Johnstone and Mandy Simons presented on Pittsburgh’s unique dialect at the Linguistic Society of America’s (LSA) 85th Annual Meeting. The event was held from Jan. 6–9 at the Wyndham Grand Pittsburgh Downtown hotel. 
Johnstone, a professor of English focusing on rhetoric, linguistics, and critical theory, gave a keynote presentation on “Speaking Pittsburghese: The Social History of Pittsburgh Speech.” In her lecture, she examined the individual characteristics of native Pittsburgh speech and how, in the second half of the 20th century, “Pittsburghese” has become accepted as an authentic dialect. Johnson connected Pittsburgh’s unique jargon to the city’s local identity and discussed why and how this happened in Pittsburgh and not in every American city.
Simons, an associate professor of philosophy who launched Carnegie Mellon’s linguistics major, presented her talk, “Towards a Taxonomy of Projective Content.” Simons worked with a team of collaborators collecting research on the topic. She shared the results of a National Science Foundation-sponsored research project aimed at better understanding different types of linguistically conveyed meaning, using data from a variety of languages.

A clip of Kanye West’s newest music video, “Monster,” was leaked this week, quickly attracting the attention of the public and the outrage of many of the nation’s women. Why? 
I’m a muthaf***ing monster.
The short, 30-second clip from the full-length video features, among other images: bikini-clad, high-heeled women hung from the ceiling by the neck with chains; two dead women in bed with one man, their eyes glazed over as he positions their lifeless arms around each other; a woman drenched in blood, crouching over a dead man, eating his guts with her bare hands; and Kanye West casually holding the blood-dripping, disembodied head of another woman.
Women hang from nooses, lie in twisted heaps, and are maneuvered, mutilated, and subjected to other morbid sexual shenanigans — it only takes about five seconds of the video to sense a theme. And I, for one, am certainly not exactly on the edge of my seat waiting to see how the short clip ends in the final video. 
I crossed the line.
Arguments have been made that this is West’s attempt to cross the line, and I get that. The video is primarily about shock value, an attempt to enter back into the spotlight, recharge the debate that often follows him — whether it is sparked by calling former President George W. Bush racist, interrupting Taylor Swift’s award reception, or, now, a video that highlights dead, drugged, or decapitated women.
Others have supported the video, claiming that it also plays into a history of a genre of this type of exaggerated horror that has existed since Romantic literature. It can even be argued that, like much that falls into the category of Gothic horror, there is a sense of satire about the gruesome scenes displayed.
I smell a massacre.
While these arguments can be made, it is hard to move past the fact that West did not choose just to involve corpses; he chose female corpses, which were then sexualized, as well as being drugged, beaten, decapitated, killed, and even eaten. This is gendered violence at an extreme level.
The Coalition Against Trafficking in Women (Australia), Collective Shout: for a world free of sexploitation, and Adios Barbie sponsored a petition against the release of the video. The petition states that the “music industry’s portrayals of women’s pain, suffering, abuse, objectification, and victimization as valid forms of entertainment are not acceptable,” and demands that “Universal Music Group and MTV combat violence against women by refusing to support, promote, and/or give airtime to West’s ‘Monster’ video.” 
I signed the petition, and I did so because of much more than my general frustration with the violence, nudity, and over-sexualized imagery that has become the norm in much of the modern music industry. Yes, the video is incredibly violent; yes, the women are undressed and featured as sex objects; and yes, the lyrics seem to repeat the continual references to bitches and hos, and of course include the obligatory references to male power and domination.
This video, however, crosses a line. It not only glorifies women’s bodies — it glorifies women as objects deserving of pain and suffering, deserving of silence, deserving of force and violence.
As one of the best commentaries on the video, written by Melinda Tankard Reist, read:
“Expect to hear boys singing along to it soon. This is the message they are imbibing:
‘Women are slaves and bitches who can service a man’s sexual needs, even in death. Men are brutal and dominant, and have no empathy for women. Men enjoy dead women as sex and entertainment. The female body is to be devoured, reduced to the same status as meat. Female bodies should be displayed before men as a great feast for their consumption.’ ”
Everybody know I’m a muthaf***ing monster.
The full music video can be viewed at www.youtube.com/watch?v=qyB2JvMYFfE, while the petition against the release and distribution of the video can be signed at www.thepetitionsite.com/1/prevent-official-release-of-kanye-wests-women-hating-monster-video.

It began with JuicyCampus. Suddenly, the idea of an anonymous Internet forum didn’t seem so strange, with a simple modus operandi: Give college students a place to talk about anything (or anyone) without fear of repercussions. Then in 2009 JuicyCampus closed, and College ACB moved into the void left behind. It’s been steadily growing in use ever since, with an explosion of activity on Carnegie Mellon’s board over the past three months.
The concept, on the surface, is surprisingly liberating. Students can post topics complaining about a fellow student, an organization, a class, or an RA — all without fear of being held accountable for their comments. Fraternities and sororities are also at the center of many discussions. However, College ACB’s problems are immediately visible with only a brief glance. An average post from the Carnegie Mellon board is slightly ridiculous, sometimes amusing — and sometimes outright defamatory. Topics such as “Frats that haze vs frats that dont [sic]” and “are there any hot Indians at Carnegie” are the trending fodder, to name a few. It’s a site that runs somewhere in between the humble pensiveness of Montaigne and the collective trash of a service like 4chan.
The problem for users of College ACB lies in one word: libel. Comments printed about an individual that are untrue and are defamatory can be pursued by that person in a court of law — and the site can be served a subpoena for a poster’s personal information. 
College ACB does offer an internal moderation service, but its effectiveness is questionable. “Any post that might be threatening, libelous, or otherwise illegal is immediately brought to the webmaster’s attention,” wrote Peter Frank, the site’s operator, in the site’s first press release. However, the notification function often takes days to carry through, and it can often only nominate several posts for deletion at a time. The person reporting the posts must also be the one defamed by them; simply reporting libelous posts won’t work. Despite this system, there is a very real possibility that legal action may be taken. The Communications Decency Act protects the owners of the site themselves from directly being sued; however, if they wish to avoid being complicit in a John Doe lawsuit, they’ll be asked to provide the offending poster’s personal information (including the poster’s IP address). 
Posting from the comparative anonymity of a public station such as a cluster is no safe haven, either. If asked to produce personal information for legal purposes, “Computing Services would be able to identify the account or accounts being used on the machine at a given time,” said John Lerchey, a representative of Carnegie Mellon’s Information Security Office. “On machines like the UNIX servers where multiple users access the machine remotely simultaneously, we would likely be able to provide a list of users that were on the system at the time.” The moral of the story? No place on campus — or on a personal computer, for that matter — is entirely anonymous. The price of an insult to a member of the campus community could be thousands of dollars in attorney fees at the very least, and fines at the very worst. In the interests of self-preservation, if nothing else, the potential cost seems intimidatingly large.
The important question here is simple. Despite all the negative press, is this service worth keeping? Is free speech meant to harm another a tool worth protecting or something worth inhibiting? That’s the debate that this campus’s participating community ultimately needs to have with itself. If there is one thing we must rejoice in, it is that the Internet is such a venue of freedom that sites such as this one are available unhindered. Some college campuses have called for bans of College ACB on their networks; others such as Cornell University have seen students moving to boycott the site. Even if the site were to be censored or banned at Carnegie Mellon, would that be enough, and would anything really change? 
It may simply be that, given the availability — or at least the appearance — of anonymity, human nature calls for us to exploit it to the fullest. Yet it is in each individual’s best self-interest to determine whether the price his or her words might carry are worth more than the alternative: a more powerful statement of silence.

During the past week, the country of Sudan voted on whether the southern region of the country should secede from the north. This referendum on southern independence was one of the requirements of the 2005 peace agreement that brought an end to a two-decade civil war. We hope that last week’s referendum will bring to a final close what has been a long and bloody conflict. Indeed, the vote was conducted without the violence that has often plagued Sudan and other divided countries in the past. 
Sudan was originally pieced together during the European colonization of Africa, where ethnic boundaries were completely disregarded.  Most northern Sudanese are Muslim, whereas southerners tend to embrace Christianity and animist religions. The differences between the two have led to much conflict, resulting in 50 years of near-constant turmoil.
In addition, many argue that northern Sudan is taking advantage of the abundant natural resources in the south while reciprocating with very little in terms of development, infrastructure, education, and health care. The inequality begs for a better solution; we believe this solution is separation.
Consistent with general expectations, the initial returns from voting are in favor of secession. The only impediment to the success of the independence movement seemed to be that it required at least 60 percent of the registered voters to take part. Initial estimates have indicated that an overwhelming majority of southern Sudanese voters participated in the election, and we are thrilled by this expression of popular support, as well as the peaceful way in which the elections were conducted.
Should independence be, as expected, the official outcome of the referendum, we expect to see a new country this summer. Some leaders such as Sudanese President Omar al-Bashir suggest that the separation will result in instability and slow progress toward development. 
We acknowledge that a transition to independence will be difficult for the southern Sudanese people to accomplish: Even though the majority of the natural resources in Sudan are located in the south, the region has not seen as much development in sanitation or education as the rest of the country, and its approximately 8 million citizens have a very low standard of living with minimal health care. However, the separation of the two halves of the country is the best option given their history of conflict.

In the nine days since the horrific shooting in Tucson, Ariz., Americans have tried to make sense of the tragedy. Journalists, politicians, and others have debated possible causes, trying to find sense in a senseless violent act. There are, no doubt, many lessons to be learned from that fateful Saturday. However, many public officials and media personalities have already tarnished the memories of the victims by spouting their own agendas.
Authorities’ investigations into the background of Jared Loughner — who allegedly shot Rep. Gabrielle Giffords (D–Ariz.), killed six people, and wounded 13 more — are enough to convince any observer that this attack was not the result of twisted political messages or campaign commercials taken too literally. It was, in the truest sense of the word, the work of a madman. Sarah Palin, whose commercial drew crosshairs over Giffords’ district, and Sharron Angle, who advocated “Second Amendment remedies” in the event of her election loss, cannot be held accountable for Loughner’s actions. There have been and will be acts of politically motivated violence caused by these words and those of other demagogues like Glenn Beck and Keith Olbermann. Tucson was not among them.
Instead of linking their pleas for political moderation to Loughner, public figures should instead use Giffords herself as an inspiration. She is a Democrat in a conservative district, and she has consistently put service over politics. If Giffords makes a significant recovery, which we sincerely hope she does, we do not expect her to blame some other politician or pundit for the tragedy. We expect her to continue, as she has always done, to serve her constituents and the United States to the best of her ability, without regard for media attention or front-page headlines. It is an example that others would do well to follow.

Welcome back, Tartan readers new and old.
Some of you may know that The Tartan’s leadership changes every calendar year, and, as the new editor-in-chief, I wanted to use this space to give you a preview of some of the new and exciting changes we have planned for 2011. I am not writing this simply to tell, though. I am writing because I want you, the students, faculty, staff, administration, and alumni of Carnegie Mellon University, to respond.
The biggest and most obvious change in the coming months will be to The Tartan Online. We have spent the last several months redesigning thetartan.org from the ground up to be more useful to you, our readers. 
Not only has the visual design been completely changed, but the new site will be more navigable, and it will reflect that the members of our staff are your friends and colleagues. 
You will be able to find all the columns by the TA for your physics course and all the photos from that guy you sit next to in economics. It will be easier to find information, and, just as importantly, it will be easier to interact with our staff and the rest of the university community. We expect to launch the new site within the coming months.
The new website is not the only addition coming to The Tartan. You can expect to see more profiles of faculty and their cutting-edge research. You can expect to see coverage of intramural and club sports. At the same time, we will continue to provide news and opinion relevant to our readership. This content will still be available in our weekly print edition, but it will also be accessible through instant updates to our website and social media connections on Facebook and Twitter.
Throughout our efforts this year, the goal is to be relevant to our readers — those of you who are reading this column now, and those who will join us in the next 12 months. 
I hope that you are as excited about these plans as I am, but I want your feedback. To that end, The Tartan has for the first time in several years appointed an ombudsman, Patrick Gage Kelley, to represent the concerns of the university community. He is charged not only with seeking your opinions but with making sure that they are heard. You can contact him at ombudsman@thetartan.org. 
I, and the rest of the editorial staff, look forward to serving you over the next year.
Michael Kahn
Editor-in-Chief, The Tartan

The long winter days can be tiresome — trudging through the snow with a runny nose, chapped lips, hands stuffed in pockets, and wind piercing through jackets and sweaters. The sky, always a dull gray or pearly white sheet, mirrors the layers of powdery snow below. There is not even one glimpse of the sun. The winter months are particularly trying, almost depressing.
Yet there is also something enchanting about the winter, despite its harshness. There is that excitement in the air when awaiting the first snowfall of the season — a lingering expectation. There is that sense of pure joy upon catching a snowflake on a gloved hand and watching its unique pattern wilt into the fabric. There is that feeling of warmth upon drinking a cup of coffee while struggling through the snow and the wind, clasping the hot cup in frozen hands. This is when winter is beautiful.
It is the beauty of winter that helps with overcoming its very harshness. It is the time to recall snowball fights and sledding and snow angels. It is the time for folly rather than seriousness — a brief, secondary childhood. It is the time to remember the sensation of molding fluffy snow into tiny balls, poised to throw them at others in merriment. It is the time to recollect the feeling of slipping and sliding through the soft, moist snow on a sled or on a tray or with a trash bag, with the air whooshing past with great fury. It is a time of creativity, shaping snowmen from powder and using peppers, carrots, and olives for its smiling face.
However, why is it so hard to throw off the mask of propriety, of seriousness, of adulthood, in favor of becoming a child once more? There is that lack of spontaneity and wonder as reality creeps through childhood dreams and fantasies — the reality of responsibility. It is for this reason that this is the season to rediscover those youthful notions, to become nostalgic for those enjoyments and amusements.
Memory has that strange way of dulling the unpleasant while emphasizing the pleasures of the past. It is for this reason that it is so important to live within the present, to embrace all the possibilities of a winter day, despite its seeming dreariness. A winter day — a time for a good book and a cup of tea, a hike, a meeting with friends, discovering new places, finding new ideas, meeting new people, searching for all the small, amazing things about an ordinary, mundane day. It is those tiny things that make each day unique — a smile, a thought, a hug, a look, a glimpse, a glance, a group, a friendship, a sudden recollection, the dawning of a new idea, seeing something in a new light for the first time. This is when an ordinary, hard winter day transforms into a gem, something to embrace and look forward to — an opportunity.

In December, the Port Authority of Allegheny County received millions of dollars in supplemental funding. In January, it announced a 15 percent service cut. It sounds contradictory, but represents the best financial planning we have seen from the authority in recent years.
The Port Authority has been requiring regular bailouts since long before the term made its appearance in the national conversation. Pennsylvania Gov. Ed Rendell repeatedly sent emergency funding to the Port Authority to help it survive 2004, 2005, and 2006. In 2007, the Allegheny County Council passed the infamous alcoholic beverage tax for the transit agency’s benefit. And the governor came to the rescue again last year with another $45 million.
Last year’s emergency money would have been enough to keep the Port Authority funded at current service levels until June, but then the cycle of begging and bailouts would only have begun again — this time with incoming Gov. Tom Corbett and a new state legislature barely settled into their offices in Harrisburg. Furthermore, with the state government facing its own $4 billion projected budget deficit, it is unlikely that anyone in Harrisburg would be able to address the Port Authority crisis in a reasonable manner this year. Without help, the authority would be forced to cut bus service by more than a third.
Faced with that uninviting picture, the Port Authority instead made the sound decision to stretch out Rendell’s current $45 million for an extra year by announcing a smaller round of service cuts for March. This gives both the county and the state government until July 2012 to devise a long-term solution to the Port Authority’s consistent woes.
If anything is clear, it is that the transit authority, county, and state must find a long-term solution. While any transit cuts now are certainly frustrating, the Port Authority cannot indefinitely maintain a miserable existence by subsisting on year-to-year emergency bailouts. Though we may grumble when our 71A takes longer to arrive or when the 28X goes through Robinson again come March, we should accept the inconvenience if it means our buses will continue to come at all.

Thank you for your continued coverage of the Hunt Library lighting project. We are writing to point out a serious factual error in the story published on Nov. 22, 2010 (“Hunt Library interior lighting to be addressed following exterior redesign”). That is, Bill Hunt did NOT pay for the exterior lighting.
As written, the third paragraph states, “The lights are a gift from Roy Hunt’s grandson, Bill Hunt, who pointed out that the building was only visible half the time.”
A way to incorporate the necessary correction would be to end the second paragraph with this sentence: “The lights were paid for by a grant from the Roy A. Hunt Foundation.”
And to edit the third paragraph as follows: “The story began when Roy Hunt’s grandson, Bill Hunt, pointed out that the view across campus would be enhanced if all the lights in Hunt Library were turned on. ‘Like many campus buildings, the library disappears structurally at night. All you are seeing are the fluorescent lights inside, and then you’re seeing half the building dark,’ Popowich said.”
We ask that you
Again, we appreciate your reporting on developments in Hunt Library, and there are more good stories to be told. We are actively working with students and continually upgrading University Libraries facilities in response to student requests, as projects are prioritized by our SAC and Help Hunt folks, and as funding is available. Next semester, we would like to meet and talk with you about the latest news, plans, and projects on the immediate horizon.

Everyone knows what you are capable of, but try not to burn yourself out this semester; your friends will truly appreciate it.
It has been more than three weeks since fall semester finals, so it’s time to stop loathing that one professor who prevented your SIO chart from having a slope of zero.
Yes, there is snow on the ground, and you do indeed have on your winter clothes. And yes, one of your professors just walked by you not paying any attention, but no, it wouldn’t be a good idea to throw a snowball at them.
If you’re looking for a sign of positive reinforcement about a decision you just made, this sadly isn’t it, but it’s a start. Keep looking and the answer will become clear — but if it hasn’t by Thursday then find someone to talk to, and fast.
Be bold, be daring, and get noticed as the kid in the weirdest-colored winter coat there is.
Tonight you will be having the most delicious dinner. Everything will taste great, and even though you are full, you will keep eating because it tastes wonderful. Then, reality will hit and you will sadly realize that you are at Skibo.
The weather outside is frightful and staying in your bed is much more delightful. But as long as you go to Carnegie Mellon, sleeping in guarantees you’re screwed.
Please do not file a report with Campus Police after buying textbooks. Even though a jury of your peers would gladly convict book publishers for robbery and extortion, Campus Police doesn’t have the manpower to investigate this crime.
You’re an Ophiuchus now... good luck with that. Sorry, my telescope is too cheap to figure out what the stars are saying in your part of the galaxy.
Just be frank and up front. Let your textbooks know that there is another literary element in your life called a novel, and that you like the novel more.
The sky looks pissed; the wind talks back. Sadly this is the forecast for the week, and not me singing the first lines to an Ingrid Michaelson song.
It will be okay — just 49 more days until spring break.
