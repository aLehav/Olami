Alas, I have returned to the bottom of the scoreboard and have been honored with the responsibility to write the recap of Tartan Fantasy League’s Week 4 action. Here’s what went down:
TARTAN FANTASY over futbol 107.50 to 69.90
In this matchup, Photo Editor Lisa Qian’s team TARTAN FANTASY dominated Visual Editor Tracy Le’s team futbol. After starting 2–0, Le’s team moves to fourth place with a 2-2 record, while Qian’s team leapfrogs futbol to third place with a 3–1 record.
For another week, Houston Texans quarterback Deshaun Watson has carried Qian’s team TARTAN FANTASY. This week was no exception, as Watson led the team with 375 passing yards and two touchdowns for 31.10 points. Dallas Cowboys running back Ezekiel Elliot’s 30.00 points, Atlanta Falcons kicker Matt Bryant’s 14.00 points, and the Texans defense’s 13.00 points pushed Qian past Le’s team despite all her other starters scoring in single digits.
Le’s team futbol was derailed by the fact she didn’t update her starting lineup. Her two Carolina Panthers players, quarterback Cam Newton and tight end Greg Olsen, were on a bye, and Cincinnati Bengals running back Joe Mixon is injured. If she had started Indianapolis Colts quarterback Andrew Luck (35.66 points) and Chicago Bears running back Tarik Cohen (23.40), futbol would have had more than enough points to win.
Last Manning Standing over mmichelle123 127.22 to 93.78
This week, Publisher Caleb Miller’s team Last Manning Standing won for a 3–1 record, and second place in the league. Pillbox Editor Michelle Madlansacay’s team mmichelle123 drops to seventh place with a 1–3 record.
Miller’s team Last Manning Standing boasted several strong performances this week. Leading the team was New Orleans Saints running back Alvin Kamara, who recorded 134 rushing yards, three rushing touchdowns, and 47 receiving yards for 36.10 points. The Green Bay Packers defense also had a stellar week, putting up 23.00 points.
On Madlansacay’s team mmichelle123, a 31.68 point performance from Minnesota Vikings quarterback Kirk Cousins was let down by the Vikings defense, who had -3.00 points, just like in the real game. Saints kicker Wil Lutz posted a solid 15.00 points, but the team couldn’t overcome weak performances from the starting running backs, Baltimore Ravens’ Alex Collins and Tennessee Titans’ Derrick Henry, who contributed 8.50 and 3.10 points, respectively.
newz over Slugs 124.60 to 100.02
In the closest contest of the week (which hopefully won’t cause any office drama), News Editor Nora Mattson’s team newz came out on top, defeating Operations Manager Adam Tunnard’s team Slugs. newz scored 21.2 percent more points than projected to move to 3–1 and maintain first place, while Slugs, now 2–2, fall to fifth place.
Mattson’s team newz had a great week overall, with several starters contributing significantly. Detroit Lions wide receiver Golden Tate led the team with 25.20 points from 132 yards through the air and two touchdowns. Texans wide receiver DeAndre Hopkins followed with 22.90 points from 169 yards through the air and one touchdown. Los Angeles Chargers quarterback Philip Rivers finished with 250 passing yards and three touchdowns for 21.70 points.
On Tunnard’s team Slugs, the running backs led the way. Melvin Gordon of the Chargers ran for 104 yards and completed seven catches for 55 yards and a touchdown, totaling 23.90 points. Kareem Hunt of the Kansas City Chiefs had similar numbers, with 121 yards and a touchdown on the ground and 54 receiving yards for 23.50 points. Excluding Packers quarterback Aaron Rodgers’ mediocre 15.02 points, all other offensive starts scored less than six points, holding the team down.
Pillbox over Gin and Bear It 107.56 to 56.74
Let’s not sugarcoat it: my team Gin and Bear It took a beating this week, losing to Pillbox Editor Izzy Sio’s team Pillbox by 50.82 points, the highest margin this season so far. I’m all but ready to revoke my title as Sports Editor, but I fear most of this is luck (and my ineptitude). Sio gets her first win of the season and both of our teams are tied at 1–3 and at sixth place.
Sio was smart to pick up the red-hot Chiefs quarterback Patrick Mahomes a couple weeks ago. This week, his 22.86 points from 304 passing yards and two touchdowns were a team high, followed closely by Los Angeles Rams running back Todd Gurley’s 21.60 points from 156 yards from scrimmage and a touchdown. Ravens wide receiver John Brown also had a great week with 17.90 points, his most so far this season.
Only two of my starters scored in the double digits, one of which was my ever-reliable kicker, Justin Tucker of the Ravens, who scored the second-most points with 14.00. The only offensive player with a decent week was Oakland Raiders running back Marshawn Lynch, who recorded 15.70 points from 130 rushing yards and 27 receiving yards. Everyone else let me down.
Next week, Miller’s team Last Manning Standing takes on Qian’s team TARTAN FANTASY, Tunnard’s team Slugs will battle Madlansacay’s team mmichelle123, Sio’s team Pillbox will face off against league leader Mattson’s team newz, and Le’s team futbol will probably beat my team Gin and Bear It.

Last week, well-respected German news outlet Der Spiegel dropped a stunning headline: “The Woman Who Accuses Ronaldo of Rape." In light of the past year of allegations against powerful men in various industries, this is sadly not a shocking headline, but it is shaking soccer fans across Europe and around the world to their core. Der Spiegel’s report is an in-depth account of the events in June 2009; there are communications between Cristiano Ronaldo and his lawyer, first-hand accounts from Kathryn Mayorga, the titular woman, and quotes from the police report filed after the incident nine years ago. There is even record of a $375,000 settlement from Ronaldo to Mayorga a few months after he allegedly raped her in his penthouse in Las Vegas.
On the next day, Mayorga filed a police report in Las Vegas that recounted the horrifying experience: Ronaldo himself is reported as understanding her pleas to stop multiple times, which is the least insidious aspect of Der Spiegel’s report on the case. The police took DNA evidence, a statement from Mayorga, and cataloged her injuries, which included bruising to her rectum. A demeaning police officer — who reportedly said, “You getting an attorney, that doesn’t look good” — took her statement, and by the end of it, she asked the officer to do nothing. A criminal case was never opened, but a civil agreement was arranged between Mayorga’s and Ronaldo’s lawyers in the early winter of the next year. Mayorga was paid $375,000 — a week of Ronaldo’s wages — on the condition of her silence. Ronaldo didn’t even show up to the arbitration meeting.
Nine years later, on Sept. 27, the criminal case was reopened by the Las Vegas Police Department on account of Mayorga filing a lawsuit against Ronaldo with rejuvenated strength and willingness to testify, and thanks to Nevada’s statute of limitations law, the criminal case will be allowed to progress as the assault was documented the same night as it occurred. For his part, Ronaldo responded in an Instagram Live video that the allegations were “fake news.” It’s unlikely for there to be more news on the front of a criminal case against Ronaldo until the investigation starts to wind down.
However, one thing about these allegations against Ronaldo that draws a stark difference between allegations against former Hollywood producer Harvey Weinstein, newly confirmed Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh, or other powerful men of industry is the lack of general social outrage that is so common of the #MeToo movement; I’ve found myself telling more people about Ronaldo’s allegations than not. With the confirmation of Kavanaugh and a tempering outrage around Ronaldo, the #MeToo movement is approaching its moment of reckoning.
There is a long history of sexual assaults in sports, but the male-dominated industry has often swept these serious allegations under the carpet while the accused continue to make millions and bask in fame. In 2003, Kobe Bryant was accused of raping a 19-year-old hotel employee and settled with the accuser out of court. He continued his storied NBA career for 13 more years, is still one of the most revered basketball players ever, and earlier this year won an Academy Award. While there is still discourse about these events of Bryant’s past, it are often to remind people of them.
The industries the #MeToo movement is fighting are not just the supposed liberal havens of Hollywood, but the male-dominated bastions of athletics and politics, among others. What is the future of the movement if we can change ourselves, but not them?
A wise person once told me that we want evil to take an unordinary shape. We want to believe aliens will destroy the world, or that there’s a meteor that will turn the world into some sort of ectoplasmic mush. We don’t want to believe that extraordinary evil can take an ordinary shape — our shape.
The hard work of the #MeToo movement is yet to come. There will be a reckoning for the powerful men in these male bastions. There will be a reckoning for the athletes, the politicians, the CEOs. There will be a reckoning for the 17-year-old boys with immense wealth and future prosperity: the Ronaldos and the Kavanaughs. But first, #MeToo must reckon with its own diminishing returns, and we as a society must reckon with what we choose to see and what we choose to ignore. A choice is coming, and the good fight must be fought. Let us hope it starts with some good news, come the next few months.

On Saturday, Oct. 6, the Carnegie Mellon University men’s and women’s soccer teams competed in a doubleheader of soccer games against Brandeis University, with the men’s team going first at 11 a.m., and the women’s team following at 1:30 p.m. Unfortunately, each team lost to Brandeis by a score of 1–0 and 2–0, respectively. Each game was a tough matchup for Tartan’s soccer, especially the women’s side, which featured a 10th ranked Brandeis team and a 12th ranked Tartan squad.
For a bright and early start, the men kicked things off quickly — a yellow card was given in the first fifteen minutes of the game to Brandeis, and another followed less than five minutes later. That was the story of the game, though. An absurd total of 11 yellow cards were handed out at random intervals throughout the game, but predominantly, in the second half. The coaches for both teams earned a yellow card, too.
As for the single goal in the game, it came with about ten minutes left in the first half, with Brandeis dribbling into open space just outside the box and letting one fly into the back of the night. Tartan goalkeeper Alec Lam made four saves in just the first half, but he couldn’t get to this one. For the rest of the game, the Tartans pushed into Brandeis territory, offering seven shots, with three on goal, to zero shots by Brandeis in the second half. Brandeis decided to slow their attack after the first goal to prevent the Tartans from mounting any meaningful attack in the second half, and it worked; no Tartan goals and only 3 saves were forced into the Brandeis keeper’s hands. The three shots on goal came from Tartan attacker Anthony Gulli, and the only other shot on goal was from the foot of Alex Dziadosz.
Overall, a lackluster performance by the Tartans in the first half only hurt them later in the game, as the Brandeis defense proved to be too much for the Tartans to handle.
Now came the women’s team, but not before the iconic Pittsburgh pop-up rainstorm forced the game back to a mid-afternoon start-time. In starkly opposing fashion, no yellow cards were handed out in the women’s game; maybe the postponement gave the teams time to be amicable towards each other. This time, the stats of the game stayed fairly consistent through the halves: the Tartans had three shots in each half to Brandeis’s five. Two saves were made by each keeper in the second half, and in the first, Tartan keeper Carolyn Botz made three saves to the Brandeis keeper’s one. However, this meant that the Brandeis team placed an unrelenting pressure on the Tartan defense, which only broke down once to allow a goal by Brandeis from 18 yards out that caromed off the post and into the net. The other Brandeis goal was a blast from 25 yards out that sailed over Botz’s head and into the top netting.
All in all, a mostly even game was played, but there were signs that Brandeis would eventually break through. They did, but only a small span of ten minutes from the 51st to the 61st minutes was the only breakdown for a solid Tartan team.
Looking ahead, the men’s soccer team has a stretch of home games through the middle of October that are must-wins in conference play. The team is 8–1–2 so far, and they have a real shot at being a dark horse contender in playoffs. The same is true of the women’s team, but they are a higher ranked team in the polls so far. Their record is 7–3–1, with their only losses coming from teams that are higher ranked than them, but a loss to New York University is going to reflect poorly in future polls. The teams face the University of Chicago next Friday, Oct. 12 in another doubleheader.

Two seasons ago, the Pittsburgh Penguins and Washington Capitals met in January. The Penguins scored six goals in the second period and one in the third, with Evgeni Malkin racking up a hat-trick. It had all the makings of a blowout, but the Capitals had a nearly equal offensive output that night, racking up seven goals of their own over the three periods of play. Then, a winger for the Pens, Connor Sheary, scored the game-winner in overtime to give the Penguins the extra point in the standings.
Opening night in PPG Paints Arena (the paint can, as some call it) was a similar game to the one played in Jan. 2017. The Penguins met the Capitals, the reigning Stanley Cup champions, and wanted to send a message that the aging Pittsburgh core wasn’t done fighting for Stanley Cups just yet. The Pens opened the scoring in the first, with defenseman Jamie Oleksiak scoring the first goal of the 2018-19 Pens season on a nice cycling play by the Hagelin-Malkin-Kessel line.
Washington responded quickly, however, with Jakub Vrana scoring from the slot on a nice passing play. They kept the pressure on and went up 2-1 on a Brooks Orpik slapshot that just snuck through Matt Murray’s five-hole. After the game, Murray said, “I feel like my pants were a little open. I was all over it. I guess that’s the new pants.”
Last season, the Penguins’ power play was the best in the league, and the best in Pittsburgh history, scoring 26.2 percent of the time. It showed on Thursday night, as the Penguins responded and tied the game back up at 2 on a Jake Guentzel power-play goal. He slammed home a partially blocked shot that Daniel Sprong took from the slot. Justin Schultz snuck a pass through two defenders to Sprong, whose shot was tipped right onto Guentzel’s tape, letting him slam home the easy goal.
The other theme from last year was rough defense, and it showed on an Alex Ovechkin goal where he slipped past Kris Letang, stopped right in front of the night, and redirected a Christian Djoos shot to pass through the legs of Murray. Nobody picked up Ovechkin and he had all the time in the world to score.
The second period looked significantly better on the Pens’ end. Kris Letang made up for his mistake in the first with a half slapshot goal thirty seconds into the second period. He took a nice backhand pass from Sidney Crosby, who looked like he was shot out of a cannon to start the shift, and slammed it home past Caps goaltender Braden Holtby.
Just three minutes later, Washington responded again. This time it was John Carlson who took the puck into the zone and right to the net, then fired a wrist shot right past the glove hand of Murray. His glove has looked a bit better, but man, it’s just not good. There’s no denying that it’s his weak spot.
Guentzel took care of retying the game at 4 with an insane deflection goal on a Schultz wrist shot from the right point. Schultz was looking for a stick, and he found Guentzel’s. Guentzel got just enough on it to sneak the puck right between Holtby’s legs. I’m expecting big things from Guentzel this year.
Derrick Brassard got on the board on Thursday as well. He jumped on a loose puck created by a Dominik Simon slapshot, then backhanded right past Holtby before he knew what to do. It’s good to see big game Brass get a goal early. It should help that third line be confident through the whole season.
In the third, Malkin put the Pens up by two goals on the power play. Phil Kessel fought off some strong checking by Caps defenders, then passed it off to Crosby below the goal line, who made a pass to Letang at the left circle, who one-touched it right into Malkin’s wheelhouse, who slapped it right past the diving Washington goaltender. Precision passing clinics like this one are going to be a common sight this year, I’m sure.
The Capitals came back, though. An ill-advised pass in the Pens defensive zone led to an immediate turnover by T.J. Oshie, who fired a little chip shot right past the glove of Murray. He then tied the game moments later on a beautiful deflection. Neither of these goals were Murray’s fault. He looked poised, but the defense collapsed and made some big mistakes at the end of the game.
Everything was fine, though, because everyone knows that 3 vs. 3 overtime gives the Penguins a huge advantage, as they can put out the stars and let them work over whatever their opponent wants to put out. Crosby worked hard behind the net and drew a slashing penalty, which gave the Pens a fourth man to work with against the Capitals’ 3. After that, it was over. Kessel passed to Letang at the point, Letang sent it over to Malkin who looked ready to one-time it past Holtby but elected to pass it back to Letang instead, who ripped the one-timer and sent everyone home happy.
The Pens looked sloppy on opening night, but they’ve shown that their offense can still score and that they can roll their lines significantly better than last season. Watch out, folks. The Penguins are back.

On Tuesday, Oct. 2, Dr. Donna Strickland made history, and received the Nobel laureate in Physics. An associate professor at the University of Waterloo, she is joined by Gerard Moreau for their research into high-intensity laser pulses. Strickland and Moreau’s work led to huge advances in the technology of eye surgery, especially with regards to myopia (they share the distinction with Arthur Ashkin, a scientist at Bell Laboratories, for his research in optical tweezers, high precision tools used to examine extremely small particles).
Strickland is one of the only three women to have ever won the Nobel Prize in Physics, and the first in 55 years — the others being Marie Curie (1903) and Jocelyn Bell Burnell (1974).
Wen looking at the data from the Statistical Research Center at the American Institute of Physics, the lack of female Physics Nobel Prize winners seems suspicious, since the rate of female Physics Ph.D.’s far exceeds that of female Nobel Prize winners. In fact, the research shows that there is less than a two percent chance that only male scientists would have won the award for such a long duration of time.
Until her Nobel win, Strickland and her work did not have a Wikipedia page; Wikipedia administrators claimed that “this submission’s references do not show that the subject qualifies for a Wikipedia article,” according to Vox. In contrast, her colleague Moreau has had a Wikipedia page for over a decade. 
Also controversial is Strickland’s status at the University of Waterloo. Many question her title as only an associate professor when her work is influential enough to earn a Nobel Prize.
Strickland’s Nobel win has provoked conversations about the lack of recognition of women’s achievements in physics, but it isn’t the most controversial event to do so in the last few weeks.
During the last week of September, the European Organization for Nuclear Research (CERN) hosted a workshop on the intersection of gender diversity and nuclear research, mostly attended by women early in their research careers. A CERN physicist named Alessandro Strumia gave a lecture purportedly on the statistics of gender in the field of physics; however, the talk turned out to be an anti-diversity tirade.
Strumia labeled efforts to support women in science a “victimocracy,” railed against the “PC thought police,” and explained that it’s more difficult for men in research than women, citing data that has been widely decried as pseudoscientific (including some anecdotal evidence about women who had been chosen over him for research positions). He also made several factually inaccurate claims — for example, that women physicists like Marie Curie have always been “welcomed” by male researchers after they show “what they can do.” Despite having a Nobel and the discovery of two elements to her name, Curie was rejected by the French Academy of Sciences.
CERN later released a statement disavowing the derogatory remarks, stating that they are strongly committed to promoting diversity in their organization and that Strumia has been suspended.
The American Institute of Physics found that for the past 15 years in the United States, women and men are roughly equally likely to attain internships and research positions. Yet, the Nobel Prize overwhelmingly acknowledges men’s achievements. 
One possible explanation? Throughout the world, women have much less access to resources than male researchers. A paper published by the Canadian Medical Association Journal shows that women are less likely to earn research funding than their male counterparts. This undercuts their ability to have access to resources that are crucial for their research. 
Strickland’s achievement is a sign that despite these inequalities, women are doing groundbreaking work in physics. Although women face many obstacles as they surge forward in their fields, Strickland shines as a beacon of hope in the otherwise male-dominated world of academia.

The worst hack in Facebook’s history began on Sunday, Sept. 16. Security engineers detected unusual activity within the company’s systems, but it took days before they had a full explanation. Attackers exploited a vulnerability to gain full access to the accounts of over 50 million users, including connected applications such as Instagram and WhatsApp. Facebook discovered the extent of the breach on Sept. 25 and released an official security update three days later.
It remains unclear who the hackers were or what exactly they obtained from Facebook, but the ramifications could be catastrophic. With over 2.2 billion users, Facebook is one of the largest data stewards in history, with vast stores of personal information such as birthdays, credit card numbers, and geolocation history. 
More than 90 million users were automatically logged out of their accounts on all devices following the attack as a safety precaution, and while Facebook says it’s unnecessary to change your email or password, the company is being cryptic about how they will deal with stolen data.
“We’re taking it very seriously,” said Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg in a conference call with the media. “I’m glad we found this, but it definitely is an issue that this happened in the first place.”
According to the official security update, the vulnerability was in the “View As” feature, which allows users to temporarily view their profile from the perspective of another user. The interface contained a composer box which incorrectly allowed uploading a video while in “View As.” During the upload, the video uploader could generate an authentication token not for the user performing the upload, but for the user profile being viewed.
Essentially, anyone with a little technical expertise could turn on “View As” to navigate a user profile, try to upload a video and be granted full access to another user’s account. That includes Facebook’s companion services such as Instagram and WhatsApp, as well as linked third-party accounts such as Tinder, Airbnb, and Spotify. This vulnerability has likely been present since Facebook introduced the video uploader in July 2017.
Facebook said they fixed the problem as soon as it was discovered, but this isn’t the first time protected user information has slipped Facebook’s grasp. More than 40,000 passwords were stolen in an attack earlier this year, and, of course, there was the revelation in March that British firm Cambridge Analytica had access to over 87 million Facebook profiles during the 2016 United States presidential election. 
Senator Mark Warner (D-Virginia), a vocal critic of Facebook, said that the recent breach “is another sobering indicator that Congress needs to step up and take action to protect the privacy and security of social media users. A full investigation should be swiftly conducted and made public so that we can understand more about what happened.” Commissioner of the Federal Trade Commission Rohit Chopra said in a statement that “breaches don’t just violate our privacy. They create enormous risks for our economy and national security. The cost of inaction is growing, and we need answers.” In addition, although Facebook was required to report the attack to the Irish Data Protection Commission under the European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation, the commission voiced strong concerns at the vagueness and timing of the company’s report. 
Regardless of the consequences Facebook will face in the coming weeks, this attack exhibits how volatile cybersecurity can be. April Doss, chair of cybersecurity at law firm Saul Ewing, said, “This has really shown us that because today’s digital environment is so complex, a compromise on a single platform — especially one as popular and widespread as Facebook — can have consequences that are much more far-reaching than what we can tell in early days of the investigation.”

As smartphones have become more and more ubiquitous, researchers and the general population alike are questioning how much screen time is healthy for a developing child. Many studies have investigated the effect of screen time on children, but a new study released on Sept. 26 in The Lancet Child & Adolescent Health magazine claims to offer a more comprehensive picture of the impact of the amount of screen time on sleep, and exercise — and how it affects cognition in growing children.  
This study is one component of a ten-year longitudinal study called the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development Study. The study involves tracking the cognitive development of more than 7,500 children until 2028. The data for the first 4,500 participants has been released; the study has released over 30 terabytes of data already, which has largely served as the foundation for the Lancet study.
Another key reference in the study is the recommendations of the Canadian 24-Hour Movement Guidelines for Children and Youth. These guidelines were formulated by the Canadian Society for Exercise Physiology (CSEP); they advise that children exercise for at least 60 minutes a day, sleep for at least nine to eleven hours a night, and only spend a maximum of two hours looking at a screen. The 4,524 child participants who ranged from eight to eleven years of age were given six tests which assessed memory, foresight, cognitive processing speed, and language skills. 
The data provides support for the hypothesis that excessive screen time may harm brain development, but the study evaluates only one snapshot in time. Thus, experts advise against concluding that this is generally true until further research is completed. 
The authors of the study nevertheless believe the results are concerning. Only 37 percent of the children used their smart devices for less than two hours a day, only 51 percent slept uninterrupted for the recommended nine to eleven hours, and a mere 18 percent exercised for more than an hour. A full 29 percent of the children met none of the guidelines, indicating that they were on their smart devices for too long, slept for too little, and exercised too little. Only five percent met all of the guidelines. The children who met all of the guidelines scored roughly 4 percent higher on the combined tests than those who met none; likewise, children who met the guidelines for sleep and screen time scored roughly 5.1 percent higher than those who met neither of them. When taken independently, however, it appears that neither sleep nor physical activity significantly affected test results. Other covariates were taken into account which commonly have either positive or negative associations with global cognition — the positive covariates include high income, education of the parents and the child, being of white or Asian descent, and being in an advanced state of puberty, while negatively associated covariates include high body mass index and traumatic brain damage.
Additionally, the study indicates that children’s screen time averages to about 3.6 hours a day, far above the recommended two hours. Although researchers cannot definitively say whether screen time or any other activity in itself lowered cognitive skills or whether one causes another, its results are still quite valuable in assessing the impact of various factors on cognition. 
The study also shows the value of integrative studies, since none of these factors can be assessed independently of the others; they are all thoroughly interconnected, meaning that a change in one leads to changes in the other two. Additionally, the study does not account at all for what exactly the children in the study are doing while they are on their smart devices. 
Some researchers speculate that there is likely a difference in cognitive development between a child who plays games on their computer and another who uses it for school work and that it may, therefore, be safe to allow children more screen time depending on the content.
Joel Barnes, a coauthor, disagrees: "We need to consider our screen habits and screen use as well as the rules and restrictions that we apply to the recreational time of children and youth because getting no more than 2 hours of screen time per day — independent of screen content — is beneficial to cognition.”

YouTube is not exactly the first place you’d go to see an in-depth multi-part investigative series, but one of the platform’s famous personalities, Shane Dawson, has carved out a space to create just that. Originally known for his sketches, conspiracy theory videos, and raunchy content, Dawson has since completely rebranded his public image and re-invented himself, aiming for more emotionally impactful, exciting, and dramatic videos. He now creates episodic investigative “docuseries,” interviewing controversial popular figures like makeup tycoon Jeffree Star, comedian Kathy Griffin, and fellow YouTuber Tana Mongeau, often taking the stance of an empathetic friend rather than an objective interviewer. Usually following a scandal in which his subject was involved, Dawson aimed to dig deeper into the lives of his subjects to find out their true natures and motivations. Due to his own popularity and the popularity of his subjects, Dawson’s channel was re-launched into the public eye, easily drawing in over 10 million views per video. However, his most recent subject – vlogger and former Disney star Jake Paul – has raised some serious concerns about misrepresentation and dramatization.
Dawson’s latest – and currently ongoing – series, “The Mind of Jake Paul,” was more than highly anticipated; the massive success of his previous docuseries has guaranteed that the YouTube community will be on the edge of their seats for his next set of videos – a fact proven by the over 8 million views he received on the teaser trailer alone. What makes this particular docuseries unique are his subjects: Jake Paul and his older brother Logan. The Paul brothers are infamous for their scandals and insane, insensitive behavior. Logan’s vlog displaying a dead body in Japan’s suicide forest received an enormous amount of backlash, but with little consequences – in fact, he continues to gain millions of views every day. Similarly, Jake’s nearly life-threatening pranks and suspicious business practices have cost him his contract with Disney, yet he too continues to rope in millions of views. One of the most dangerous side effects of this behavior – aside from the danger to themselves and their immediate friends – is the impression they leave on their viewers, who tend to be around the ages of 7-14.
These pasts had left many uneasy when Dawson initially announced “The Mind of Jake Paul,” as many refused to give the Paul brothers the watch time and an even bigger platform. Much of Dawson’s audience, easily in the millions, were worried that his series would redeem and create undeserved sympathy for the Paul brothers, a critique that commonly appears on Dawson’s other series’ as well. Viewers were made even more uneasy when he announced that the main question he aims to solve was this: “Is Jake Paul a sociopath?” Emphasized with his trademark creepy music and distorted text, the series seems to try to explain Jake Paul’s behavior as rooted in a serious personality disorder.
Now, YouTubers are known to dramatize things for the sake of connecting with a larger viewership – faking pranks, blowing events out of proportion, and creating clickbait titles and thumbnails for their videos. Dramatizing everyday events is how many YouTubers create their content, and it has become a sort of unspoken necessary strategy to amassing audiences similar in size to Dawson’s or the Paul brothers’. But this becomes a serious issue when the thing content creators are dramatizing is mental health.
Dawson clearly aims to be objective while still entertaining, but that balance seemed to teeter closer to “drama for the sake of entertainment” than he perhaps originally intended. Part 2 of his series, where he investigates the potential psychological aspects of Jake Paul’s personality, had received intense backlash for his representation of personality disorders. The video, which featured YouTuber and licensed therapist Kati Morton, was focused on a discussion of what sociopathy is and what behaviors it could entail. Despite not having met Jake Paul in person, Dawson attempts to allude to him being a sociopath, even going so far as to suggest that there must be something inherently sociopathic about YouTubers for them to behave so erratically. While the video brings to light an interesting conversation about what people are willing to do for internet popularity, the editing style of the video seems to diagnose certain YouTubers’ behavior as sociopathic: Morton would tell Dawson that sociopaths imitate emotions like sadness to seem “normal,” then cut to beauty YouTuber Laura Lee crying on camera. 
While Logan Paul’s description of sociopathy isn’t much better - “A sociopath is just someone who’s more savage” - Dawson and Morton fail to provide any definitive definition, almost purposefully leaving it vague for dramatic effect. What they also fail to mention is that sociopathy, like many other mental illnesses, is rooted in behaviors that everyone has. For example, depression: everyone experiences sadness, but depression can be a much more intense and debilitating condition. As a result, Dawson and Morton outright say that “1 in 25 people are sociopaths,” for shock value. It takes advantage of the fear people have towards sociopaths, and the video continues to paint sociopaths as “evil” and “gross.” While the conversation may have been casual, it’s beyond wrong for a licensed therapist to call someone with a serious disorder “gross.” It’s a personality disorder, and it doesn’t inherently make someone evil or mean-spirited. Whether this manipulation is purposeful or not, it dehumanizes and stigmatizes people with personality disorders, which is so incredibly dangerous considering the enormous audience watching these videos.
After seeing the backlash on his video, Dawson commented: “Once again I'm 100% NOT trying to call any celeb or Youtuber a "sociopath". I just wanted to give example clips to go along with me and Kati's conversation to make for an entertaining video.” He recently announced that he’ll be re-filming parts of the upcoming videos to make them less dramatized, but only time will tell.

If you don’t live under a rock, you know Jeffree Star as either the highly successful makeup artist on YouTube, the entrepreneur who runs his own makeup brand, or the guy on the very viral Shane Dawson “docu-series.” He has been in the YouTube makeup game since 2015, building his career from the ground up, and now enjoying the fruits of his labor: Gucci clothes, Barbie pink everything, and endless cars. However, time and time again, his career has been tainted with accusations of racism discomforting enough to keep a community of wary YouTubers and makeup artists away from him and his products, but subtle or old enough to keep an entire audience of ten million subscribers wrapped around his manicured finger.
Jeffree Star has, inevitably, responded to his past–even if it took over two years to do so. Videos of him saying the n-word to women and portraying stereotypes on MySpace came to light just as his fame skyrocketed, causing many YouTubers and subscribers alike to stay away from him. Finally, in June 2017, Jeffree Star ended his silence and released a full apology video, appropriately titled “RACISM.” He described the now-thirteen-year-old videos as “disgusting, vile, nasty, and embarrassing things,” and went on to bring an argument he still uses today: he was depressed and “angry at the world,” and saying those derogatory words was something he would never do today.
Flash forward to about two weeks ago when Star’s former hair stylist, Daved Anthony Munoz, shared a video of him exposing conversations between him and Star. Munoz expressed how sorry he is for his own past, as he scrolled through the texts from 2017–the same year as the apology video–which show Star calling fellow YouTuber Jackie Aina slurs, including the n-word. Furthermore, earlier this week, Star wore cornrows for a holiday shoot, prompting more accusations of racism and cultural insensitivity.   
So why isn’t he “over” or “cancelled?” He is yet to acknowledge Aina’s open letter calling out his racist behavior, only turning to his Snapchat followers to shade Munoz for being a liar. Yet other makeup artists under the same boat such as Laura Lee, for example, have (rightfully) lost many fans and fame. In Lee’s case, she lost well over 500,000 subscribers when her racist tweets from 2012 were resurfaced, and her subpar apology video was criticized for lacking real empathy and emotions. Her Tweets were simply inexcusable, telling black people to “pull ur pants up [so] you can run from the police faster #yourwelcome,” costing her sponsorships and collaborations from Ulta, Colourpop, and Morphe Brushes.
It is only a slight surprise to learn, however, that Morphe is the only retailer to sell Jeffree Star’s makeup line. Morphe has shown unwavering support, parading him at every one of their new U.S. store grand openings. If the brand was so quick to drop Laura Lee, what is holding them back from Star? It is the fact that we are all turning our heads the other way; it is the fact that he has never been truly held accountable; it is the fact that Star strategically released his docu-series with Shane Dawson, sharing “his truth.” 
I am convinced that Star, while sorry, is sorry for the wrong reasons. He was sorry that he was caught–not for bringing down black women and disrespecting black culture. Aina brought up an excellent point in her open letter: “If there’s going to be a standard, let’s raise it for everyone. Let’s stop making exceptions for people just because we like the way they blend their eyeshadow.”

If you’re an avid gamer like me, then you’re probably excited about the lineup of upcoming games, including titles like Red Dead Redemption 2, Assassin’s Creed Odyssey, Fallout 76, and Anthem. The great thing about video games is that they get better and better over time, as the requisite technology improves to better support the artistic visions of game developers. This is evident when we look at the evolution of franchises, such as how the Elder Scrolls series received a dramatic overhaul from Oblivion to Skyrim, or how much the Grand Theft Auto (GTA) games have changed from the time of GTA San Andreas to the time of GTA V.
It seems that with each new game, the titles become more realistic and lifelike in their narratives, their graphics, and their mechanics, which is generally a good thing. And with the development of new and improved graphics cards, like the Nvidia GTX 2080 and the AMD Radeon RX series, gaming at 60 fps with 4k resolution at high graphics settings is slowly becoming the standard among serious gamers.
But can a video game ever become too realistic?
This has been a serious concern since the beginning, and many have decried video game violence as a gateway to real-life violence, especially in the wake of tragic events like mass shootings. While there is substantial evidence showing that video games do not correlate to people acting on their violent impulses, that conclusion may have to be revisited.
For the most part, one of the key reasons why video game violence is passable is because the settings and characters do not directly mirror the real world. Even in GTA, the characters that you encounter and the mechanics of the game are so over-the-top and outrageous that it dilutes the realism of your more heinous acts. The same goes for fighting games such as Mortal Kombat, famous for its visceral finishing moves, or role-playing games like Shadow of Mordor and the Witcher series.
There are exceptions, of course, where video games cross the line. For example, a little-known game called Hatred, released in 2015, was harshly criticized for its premise and its animations. The entire purpose of the game was to play as a psychopathic murderer and to kill as many human beings as possible. Despite the isometric perspective, drab color scheme, and painfully one-dimensional plot, the main problem was the game's violence: the player was equipped with a full arsenal of realistic weaponry, the targets were all non-hostile civilians, and the “execution” moves were gruesome, to say the least.
Hatred felt a lot of backlash because it showcased its violence in a way that was too realistic, hinting at something that could conceivably happen in the real world. This raises concerns about the potential of the same thing happening again, where it would be significantly worse now given how sharply rendered graphics and advanced physics engines would only contribute to the gruesomeness.
People are generally sensible about the boundary between virtual and physical reality, but as video games become increasingly complex and more intricately detailed, the ability to form that distinction may blur. This is even more dangerous when you consider the advances made in VR technology, with games like Skyrim VR showcasing the ability of these platforms to give players a whole new level of immersion. It’s not inconceivable to say that all of us may one day live within the world of Ready Player One, where everyone and their mother has access to a headset and peripherals, allowing them to indulge in a completely encompassing virtual reality.
For now, it seems that video game developers are leveraging their newfound technological capabilities in a good way, designing games that give players a healthy dose of violence within imaginary contexts rather than breaching into the real world. But it’s important to always keep in mind that the experiences we have in these virtual worlds should be constrained to the screen; as long as we’re aware of the potential impacts, video games can continue to be a fun and entertaining medium to help us de-stress and blow off some steam.
Happy gaming!

Anyone familiar with Pink Floyd’s discography will be well versed with the band’s fascination with the human condition. This includes the demons that accompany fame and their love for creating metaphorical songs and concept albums. The Wall, their 1979 release (and last great album), is the epitome of these traits that characterized a number of their songs and releases, and it spawned a cult classic film adaptation in 1982 written by the band’s main songwriter and bassist, Roger Waters.
The narrative of The Wall follows a jaded rock star named Pink, who in many ways is a representation of Waters, as well as Syd Barrett, one of the founding members of the band who left at the very start of their career. The story is about Pink’s isolation which is represented by a metaphorical wall that is constantly being built over time by different people and events in his life such as the death of his father, his overprotective mother, his abusive teachers, and his tumultuous life as a successful rock star with marriage and drug problems.
Both the album and film are experiments in surrealism. With surrealism, what you see is never what it seems to be; rather, it is a representation of something more visceral, an indescribable, overwhelming feeling that overtakes you. 
The album takes advantage of its soundscape and the film takes advantage of its visual presentation to create this desired overwhelming feeling, and the band is able to say much more and strike a deeper nerve than any words possibly could. 
The soundscape is filled with reverb and airiness, which is simultaneously relaxing and oppressive. It’s a common trait of Pink Floyd’s sound, but The Wall takes advantage of this for the narrative. With each song, there is a constant feeling of claustrophobia, like walls are closing in, which helps the listener understand the mental state of Pink. An example of this is one of the band’s most iconic songs, “Comfortably Numb”. At this point in the narrative, Pink is heavily medicated and he’s putting on a show while incredibly high. Pink needs drugs to give him any sense of freedom, which ironically shows how trapped he is by the mental wall he has built for himself all of his life. The song sounds like something comforting and inviting, but as it crescendos to an incredible guitar solo at the end, there is a sort of existential oppression that the song gets at. 
The band also samples random sounds throughout several of their songs. This is another staple in Pink Floyd’s style, but it is used for excellent narrative effect here. From sampling teachers screaming at kids in “Another Brick in the Wall, Pt. 2” to a child exclaiming to his mother about an airplane in the sky in “Goodbye Blue Sky,” the effect it creates is that of random hallucinations or memories. It is an auditory representation of how the protagonist is affected by his memories, which can sort of come and go at any moment, or can be enhanced via drug use. It’s part of the organized sound that characterizes the album that’s built with very specific pieces, similar to how Pink fits the pieces of his metaphorical wall.
The film takes the surrealism a step further in the visual department by switching between powerful animation and imagery, elevating the lyrics of specifically chosen songs on the album. There is one scene in the film, which adapts the lyrics of “In the Flesh” and “Run Like Hell,"  where Pink hallucinates himself as a Nazi-like dictator ordering his audience to attack ethnic minorities. Both the songs and lyrics seem to have nothing to do with anything meaningful at all, but that simple scene is able to say so much. On one level, it shows just how Pink had effectively lost touch of reality at this point. On another level, this sequence showed contempt for celebrity culture and blind celebrity worship. Despite all of Pink’s very public flaws, the audience sticks by him through thick and thin, like members of a cult, or, as the film depicted, followers of a fascist dictator. In Pink’s mind, he could tell them to do anything, and they’d do it, even attacking minorities, as he commanded the audience to do. The film is peppered with moments like this that build on the original album so well. One of the most iconic images that is shown is a picture of animated marching hammers, which symbolize how, in order for Pink to truly ever feel free, he has to inevitably break the mental wall he has built around himself. 
Surrealism, when done incorrectly, comes off as pretentious and stale. However, The Wall, both the album and film, does it so well, which makes this and other prior Pink Floyd albums iconic. The band gives listeners a cathartic experience in the album. By the end, if you really listen to all the songs or watch the film closely, you’ll be drained in the best possible way.

This week, McConomy will be screening Incredibles 2, perhaps the most fun movie to have come out this year. The film picks up immediately after the events of the first film, with the supers taking on the Underminer, who emerged at the very last seconds of the previous film. After a disastrous public comeback, two business tycoon siblings, Winston and Evelyn Deavor, recruit Elastigirl to be the new face of the superhero comeback while Mr. Incredible has to sit at home and take care of the kids. 
The film isn’t as good as the first film, but it also isn’t trying to be like the first in many ways. Whereas The Incredibles was considerably more violent and dark, this one takes on the style of a family comedy featuring superheroes and a neo-futuristic 1960s setting. The pacing is incredibly brisk and every second of the film is pure glee. The film is nearly two hours long, but it feels like an hour. The animation is jaw-dropping and gorgeous, with each frame packed with so many clever little details and every shot composed well. The story is heartwarming and touching, with a great message about how parenting is an act of heroism when done properly. 
The best aspect of this film is, of course, the action sequences. Each of the new superheroes introduced in the film has a wide array of clever powers, and they are all used in such fresh and original ways, clearly taking advantage of the fact that the film is animated to create some of the best action sequences in a superhero film ever. If there are any gripes, it’s that the villain is considerably lackluster, especially considering just how great a character Syndrome was in the original film. But Incredibles 2 is an absolute blast. Take your friends with you, laugh and have a good time, and maybe watch it twice because you’ll leave the theater wanting more.

It only took about a month of restraint – or agonized waiting, however you want to phrase it – before I finally got to go to Pamela’s Diner, a Pittsburgh staple, for the first time this semester. While it’s definitely not The Tartan’s first time talking about Pamela’s, here’s a first-hand experience reminding you why this diner is a college must during your time at Carnegie Mellon.
The location: Pamela’s P&G Diner has several locations throughout Pittsburgh. There’s a Pamela’s in Shadyside, Oakland, and in the Strip District. My friend and I elected to go to the Pamela’s in Squirrel Hill. It’s one of the first restaurants you see when you turn on Murray Street, and we could already see people gathered around the door at 10:30 a.m. Despite this, we were seated fairly quickly – when you’re a diner that's been around for almost 40 years, you know how to deal with the morning rush.
The vibe: The restaurant was packed with all kinds of people: families, college students, teenagers, a group of old men hanging out for brunch. It created an interesting, refreshing dynamic that captured the spirit of a small town, even though Pittsburgh is far from that. Pamela’s staff was incredibly friendly, making sure our order went through and it felt like I was in good hands. It was so easy to relax in Pamela’s and to slip into a conversation with my friend amid the morning activity of the restaurant.
The food: Pamela’s crepe-style hotcakes, which my friend and I both ordered, are the must-try dish of almost any Pamela’s visit. You can choose to get a stack of two or three pancakes, but no matter how many pancakes you order they are extremely filling. They’re thin, crunchy, warm, and one of the restaurant chain’s staples. We also ordered a side of Pamela’s famous Lyonnaise potatoes. They were piping hot when they arrived, but we both couldn’t help but dig in immediately. The potatoes have a great crunch to them, and they’re something that I’ll almost always order whenever I go to Pamela’s.
Lit or nah: I guess Pamela’s is lit in its morning hustle and bustle? Pamela’s in the morning is vibrant and lively no matter which location you go to. It’s a great place to start your morning off right and an even better place to go to with a company of great friends.

Dear Michelle, 
These past few weeks have probably been the most stressful of the year for me, and I’m ready to pass out. I’ve had to deal with job applications and interviews, midterms, and lots of homework (still!). I haven’t really found time for myself, but I have been able to spend a little bit of time with my friends. And yet, even when I hang out with them I don’t feel my happiest because I still have all my worries about school and jobs in the back of my mind. I don’t know what to do - I want to be happy with both my friends and myself, but I feel like all the stress from school has basically taken over my life. Please give me some advice on how to deal with this. 
Starting To Realize Even School Sometimes Is Not Great
Dear STRESSING,
There’s always a point in the semester when the work and stress hit you all at once, and everything in your life seems to be falling apart. And the only way you think you can deal with this is to devote all your time and energy into your work.  Please know that this approach to work in college isn’t uncommon and that so many people are feeling and doing the exact same things. Especially at our school, there are lots students who let their work consume their entire lives. Know that your life in college doesn’t have to be like this, even though it may seem like it’s that way for everyone else around you. Your work is important, your health is just as (if not more) important. 
What can help is to catch yourself at the moment when you start to feel like you’re not yourself and you’re not happy. Once you’ve done that, just stop and take a deep breath. Think about the things that make you most happy, and even write them down if want! The idea here is that you should take time to reflect on your priorities and how you want to mentally move forward; you need to make sure that the next steps you take will not lead you to eventually burn out. After doing this, try gradually setting aside time each week to do the things that really make you happy. We all need that constant reminder that our work does not define us and that in the end, our true goal is to be happy and satisfied with our life. Be sure to keep that in mind. 
Hope this helps! 
Michelle

Over 115 people in the United States die everyday from overdoses on opioids like prescription pain relievers, heroin, and synthetic opioids like fentanyl. This stark statistic reveals the extent of the damage the opioid crisis has done to the people of this country. And the numbers don’t stop there. In 2016, 4600 Pennsylvanians died of a drug overdose. In 2017, over 700 people died of an overdose in Allegheny County alone. The Department of Health website states that “the prescription opioid and heroin overdose epidemic is the worst public health crisis in Pennsylvania.”
From Oct. 1 to 5, our campus, in collaboration with the Light of Life Rescue Mission, hosted the Eye of the Needle, a multi-media immersive art installation based on the documentary of the same name, to raise awareness of the Opioid Crisis and its impact on Pittsburgh.
On Thursday, The Tartan sat down with Elizabeth Vaughan, Associate Dean of Student Affairs and the Director of Student Leadership, Involvement, and Civic Engagement (SLICE) at Carnegie Mellon University, who provided the vision and the support to this event. Speaking on how the art installation had come to the campus, Vaughan said, “Last year, probably early in Spring semester, someone from Light of Life had contacted CFA about bringing Eye of the Needle installation to the campus — thinking about it from like an art perspective.”
According to Vaughn, the installation opened to positive responses from visitors, and sparked a discussion of the crisis in the campus community. Televisions inside the tent by The Fence housing the installation screened the 11 minute documentary to the visitors. Vaughan says that several people who visited the installation  shared their own stories about how their lives, and the lives of their friends, families, and coworkers have been affected due to this crisis. “One of the folks who was staffing the installation yesterday shared a story with me that someone who’d gone through the installation had shared, that they had a loved one who was trying to get clean but their health insurance had provided only 10 days of in-patient treatment, [which is] just not sufficient for how significant the grip of the addiction is,” she said, highlighting the challenges that people who seek recovery face.
Eye of the Needle is a thought-provoking documentary that shows the human side of this crisis. It goes beyond statistics and shows people - their lives, their stories, and the stories of their loved ones. It gives a dignity and respect for the humanity of addicts that most discussions of the opioid epidemic do not. The art installation also had similar themes. Speaking of this, Vaughan said, “One of the primary goals was to start the conversation of the crisis. I would say that what I’ve heard as a really significant theme in our conversations is the idea of not just seeing the problem but seeing the person, recognizing them as a fellow human being.”
Vaughan found this reaction embodied in a reflection card left by one visitor, stating simply,”I see you.” Vaughn described this as “Like, recognizing, you’re the person that I pass by [and] see panhandling, you’re the person that I drive by and see coming out of one of the tents in the encampment, you are a person and we have this shared humanity, and therefore I should care because you’re also a human being, you’re worthy of something better than your current conditions are.”
The installation has become a conversation-starter for a topic that is deeply personal and difficult for many people in the campus community. “In an hour and a half period that I was staffing the installation on Tuesday, I had multiple staff members who either have a sibling or their child or their friends’ children who’re are struggling with addiction,” she said, when asked about the extent to which the campus community itself has been affected by this crisis. “I’ve had a former faculty member who shared an experience about a former student of hers who became addicted while he was a student here and he dropped out, and then, unfortunately, overdosed and passed away… I don’t have any numerical values to provide… but what I’ve become shockingly aware of is truly how many people on our campus have been affected in some way and are living with the challenges of that day to day.”
What is it that they want to achieve through this installation? Vaughan explains, “I think one piece of what they’re trying to do is show the actual conditions… the reality of the situation and they’re not trying to sugar coat it. That’s why the items are directly taken from the street, everything from the leaves to the trash to the furniture - everything that you saw there was directly from the street other than the tents. I think they’re trying to show the range of people’s circumstances.” Vaughan also shared a powerful experience that she had due to the installation, “I actually was walking out of the installation opposite of the direction that we typically walk through just yesterday. And I looked over, and realized that there was a little baby shoe there... and I hadn’t seen that when I had walked through the other direction… I’m a mother of 3 kids and I can’t imagine my children having to live in that environment… I just can’t imagine that.”
As a community, we can fight back. The Light of the Life Rescue mission is actively working to reduce addiction and homelessness in Pittsburgh, and we have lots of opportunities to volunteer with them. Another organization that Carnegie Mellon has a long-standing relationship with is Sojourner House. There are lots of other organizations that are working with the homeless population like Bethlehem Haven and Living Ministry if one wishes to take direct action. “But,” Vaughan, adds, “there’s also an election coming up in November. If this is an issue you care about, educate yourself in the local, state, and national level… candidates that are running - what are their positions on getting increased accessible care, prevention, and what are their positions and what are their priorities and goals related to the crisis and whatever lies the closest to your value set and the education set that you’ve provided yourself, you know, doing research and then support those candidates. So, I do think we have to be working at all of those levels for us to really make progress.”
But most importantly, Vaughan says, “If you suspect something is going on, you have to say something. Having the courage to address the suspicion, the concern, and to say, ‘I care about you. I’m worried. What’s going on? Can I help you get connected to help?’ and not to be an active bystander. You don’t know if saying something will help that person get into care at that moment but it is demonstrating that their life is valuable and that they are worthy of love, of support, and respect, and maybe the thing that helps get them connected to care. So we have to have the courage to have that hard conversation.”
In 2015, over 33,000 Americans died of opioid overdose. That same year, an estimated 2 million people suffered from substance abuse disorders related to prescription opioid pain relievers.

A recent series of Shadyside robberies, all perpetrated by suspects wearing Scream masks, has had Carnegie Mellon students frightened to be outside at night.
Three weeks ago, on Wednesday, Sept. 19, the Carnegie Mellon community was notified via email of two robberies that occurred that Monday, Sept. 17, and one that occurred Wednesday, Aug. 29.
The email from the 17th specifies that a woman was approached at the corner of S. Highland Ave. and Walnut St. by a suspect “who was wearing a ‘Scream’ Halloween Mask.” Brandishing a black handgun, the suspect “grabbed her phone and demanded her wallet,” then fled on foot. Just five minutes later and a few blocks away, another woman was held up by a suspect in a black scream mask. “He pointed a black handgun at her and demanded her phone, purse, and backpack.”
Last weekend on Sept. 29, another victim was held up by someone wearing a Scream mask, this time on the corner of Euclid and South Negley. Though local news stations have reported on this, the Carnegie Mellon community has yet to be notified in the same manner as the previous incidents.
Many Carnegie Mellon students who live in Shadyside report that since being notified, they have been returning home from campus earlier than usual. “I leave around 7 or 8, latest 9. Before, I would stay until 11 or 12” says Sophia Kim, a sophomore design student who lives on Bellefonte St. Kim didn’t think too much of the first robberies, but “after the 4th time [last weekend] I’ve been going home earlier.” She’s been walking home with friends and doing more work at home.
“This wasn’t the first time I had heard of horrific things happening in Shadyside,” commented a Masters student who did not wish to be named. After explaining that the robberies were not shocking, but reaffirming of the dangers that lurk off campus, she boarded the 71C bus, heading home to Shadyside at 4:45 p.m.
Many students are troubled by the university’s delayed reporting of these incidents. The first mass email was sent out weeks after the attack, which was perpetrated on someone described in the email as a Carnegie Mellon affiliate. Carnegie Mellon Chief of Police Thomas Ogden explained that crimes that occur off campus are not reported to them. They can only release alerts after substantiating the facts with the police agency that has jurisdiction. Ogden assured that “We are attempting to improve communications with Pittsburgh and Pitt Police relative to timeliness with incidents that happen in their jurisdictions.”
The Pittsburgh Police department did not respond to repeated requests for comment, but there seems to be an increased number of patrol cars in the Shadyside area.
Though cable news sensationalized the fact that all of the victims so far have been women, Ogden clarified that, as of Oct. 4, “all of the victims were not female.” Dan Dellobade, a Masters student in Health Care Policy and Management, was “a little shocked” at the news of the robberies but not too discomforted. He acknowledged, “I wouldn’t say I’m a typical target being that I’m a bigger male.”
Chief Ogden “strongly encourages our community members to not walk alone at night, to use our Shuttle system when possible, to be alert to their surroundings, and report anything suspicious to the police.”

If you were in Pittsburgh last year, you might remember seeing the self-driving Ubers cruising around the more gentrified areas of the city. That project seems to have been sidelined after a few of Uber’s autonomous vehicles self-drove into pedestrians, but they wouldn’t have even existed in the first place without the 2007 Urban Challenge. The Urban Challenge, the second such project from the Department of Defense’s (DoD) research arm, the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA), challenged teams to create autonomous vehicles that could operate in an urban environment. The Carnegie Mellon Tartan Racing team won the $2 million dollar grand prize in the challenge, which helped lay the groundwork for the recent self-driving explosion, from Tesla to Google to the aforementioned Uber. For the newest DARPA challenge, the Carnegie Mellon team has a new environment to navigate: underground.
The DARPA Subterranean Challenge will test teams on their ability to navigate three underground spaces: tunnels, caves, and the “urban underground.” According to the challenge’s website, the goal is to “drive novel approaches and technologies to allow warfighters and first responders to rapidly map, navigate, and search dynamic underground environments.”
The Carnegie Mellon team is led by Sebastian Scherer and Matt Travers, senior systems scientist and systems scientist, respectively, at the Robotics Institute. The team is composed of a core group of 15-20, including members from Oregon State University, and also includes classes focused on solving key challenges, as well as many undergraduate and graduate students. Scherer, who has worked on several Carnegie Mellon DARPA Challenge teams, says that the Subterranean Challenge “is really about sending back a map and a location of where different objects are [without] using biological systems.”
The team’s approach will be to “have a [modular] perception system which tells us...where we are going, [while] at the center it creates a map and classifies [objects],” using robots of varying mobilities, from crawling to flying. Scherer says that a positive element of the DARPA challenges is that they “really kind of force you to put [existing technologies] together,” which can result in interesting and innovative new approaches.
The Carnegie Mellon team is one of six receiving up to $4.5 million to “develop the robotic platforms, sensors, and software necessary to accomplish unprecedented underground missions,” according to a Carnegie Mellon press release, making this project one of the many at Carnegie Mellon receiving funding from the military. When asked about the possible applications of the research, Scherer said that “the challenge is really general,” with possible applications in “mining...search and rescue after [things like] earthquakes,” and that the military’s strategy is “to get ahead in science...so they invest a lot in science and technology.”
The technologies resulting from the previous challenges have already been used to develop autonomous vehicles for the military, and it stands to reason that the novel, interesting solutions to these problems will as well. Bob Hastie, a senior technical adviser at the Defense Threat Reduction Agency, was quoted by C4ISRNET as saying that the goal of these projects is to “take the human out of [dangerous jobs] and use autonomous systems and robotic systems to...protect our warfighters.”
Whether the new technologies resulting from the Subterranean Challenge will be used for war is unclear, but probable: you don’t invest in something without expecting a return. The fact that the DoD, rather than the National Science Foundation, funds these projects means that the DARPA challenges, whatever their possible commercial or humanitarian benefits, are geared towards solving military problems.

On Aug. 22, President Farnam Jahanian notified the Carnegie Mellon community of the new President’s Task Force on Campus Climate, an initiative intended to make the campus culture and environment better for all members. Though the appointment was motivated partially by the resignation of Dr. Lenore Blum and Dr. Manuel Blum the week prior, President Jahanian was careful to note that the Task Force is not entirely reactive; the occasion provides campus leaders with the opportunity to “check in with our community, reaffirm our commitment to our values and identify ways for us to do better in living up to them.”
Lenore and Manuel Blum, longtime and influential computer science professors, announced their resignation in mid-August, citing professional harassment and sexist management practices. Lenore Blum, in an interview with NEXTpittsburgh, said that her decision has led to a strong response from the Carnegie Mellon community: “many [women] expressing almost a cathartic relief that I had dared to air experiences they recognized. Many thanked me and wrote about their own stories, in poetry and prose.” She later continued, “I am talking about sexism in the workplace. Subtle biases and micro-aggressions pile up.”
The metaphorical pile she’s referring to is what campus leaders are now labeling “climate.” In the past three to five years, schools across the country have created similar climate initiatives as knowledge about microaggressions and other subtle forms of oppression have reached the mainstream. At Carnegie Mellon, climate is loosely defined as a measure of how inclusive, equitable, respectful, and understanding the community is of all our members.
“That’s where we’re starting,” said Jodi Forlizzi, Task Force co-chair and professor of design at the Human-Computer Interaction Institute, in an interview with The Tartan. “As a Task Force, we’ll come up with more specifics on what exactly that means.”
The full list of Task Force members was released on Sept. 26, consisting of 3 co-chairs and 29 members from a variety of groups in the Carnegie Mellon community, including undergraduate, graduate, and doctoral students. With such a large team, Forlizzi and her co-chairs aren’t certain how the responsibilities will be delegated yet, though she hopes to convene a meeting of the full Task Force in the next two weeks. She likened the Force to a flock of birds to describe how it might form and reform around priorities and initiatives. “It’s a huge set of things that we could do,” she said, giving a nod to the scale of the project.
Though she was smiling while she said it, her analogy echoes the importance of flexibility in this initiative. The official charge, as specified by President Jahanian, consists of both proactive and reactive solutions to issues surrounding the campus climate. Because there are so many stakeholders and numerous related initiatives on campus, members of the Task Force will have to be open to as much information and conversation as possible. The website features a name-optional feedback form where faculty, staff, and students can submit inquiries and suggestions to be read by the co-chairs themselves. With such a large team, however, Forlizzi hopes the Task Force will be able to connect face-to-face with as many people as possible.
“Anyone is welcome to come and talk and learn more,” she said, noting her open-door policy. In the few weeks since the announcement of her role, she has already heard stories from a few community members. The goal is to keep these personal dialogues going throughout the year and to ensure that all of the Task Force members are engaging in them. “I hope everybody is approachable,” she continued. “People have agreed to serve and that means having conversations and listening.”
Listening, and being listened to, is something that Lenore Blum felt was missing from Carnegie Mellon when she left. After starting Carnegie Mellon’s successful Project Olympus incubator and serving as co-director of the Center for Innovation and Entrepreneurship (CIE) for a number of years, Blum witnessed a sharp change in management when the CIE recently became the Swartz Center for Entrepreneurship. “The equitable balance became one that, I’ve come to understand, is inherently sexist,” she told NEXTpittsburgh. “This corporate model, with a CEO-like position holding almost complete control [...] enables wanton abuse of power given bad actors at the helm.”
The Swartz Center has a new home this year in the Tepper Quadrangle, the building whose namesake is well known for hypermasculine work environments. In 2010, New York Magazine ran a feature on David Tepper’s Appaloosa Management, describing an almost entirely male office that resembled a “wealthy frat house,” complete with a detailed, larger-than-life bronze casting of a pair of testicles.
As Carnegie Mellon celebrates the Tepper Quad and the wonderful opportunities it brings to campus, Blum’s words beg the question: what kind of culture is being invited into this school? The Task Force is challenged with answering this question, and with making sure that our growth doesn’t come at the cost of an equitable, inclusive, and empowering campus climate.

Hello Students,
I hope the school year has been going well for everyone. I wanted to take this opportunity to reach out to all of you and give an update on how the Undergraduate Student Senate has been working hard behind the scenes to improve your Carnegie Mellon experience. We are currently working with the administration to monitor the add/drop deadline policy to see how students feel about it. We are also working with the administration to help create the Consensual Relationships Policy. Our Finance Committee has currently approved over $4,000 to organizations on campus to help them start new initiatives and projects.
With this in mind, starting Oct. 21, we have a new project we are undertaking: Senate Week. Starting on Sunday and going through Thursday, the Senate will be holding various events geared towards students. We want to take this time to meet with our constituents on a more personal level so that we can get feedback on how their experience at Carnegie Mellon has been. Keep an eye out for the Strip Crawl on the 21st. The Campus Life committee will be providing free transportation to and from the Strip District where vendors will be offering Carnegie Mellon Students discounts on various merchandise and food. Look out for the full list of vendors, which will be confirmed soon.
As always, if you have any questions about the Student Senate and what we do, please feel free to email me: shraiyg@andrew.cmu.edu. Or you can visit us at our table during Scotty Saturday!
Enjoy the rest of your week!

In the past couple of months, hundreds of bleary-eyed migrant children have been ushered onto buses in the middle of the night. They leave the shelter without saying goodbye and travel hundreds of miles across barren landscapes to a cluster of tents in West Texas, their new home.
According to The New York Times, the tent city is located in Tornillo, Texas, around 35 miles east of El Paso on the Mexican border. The tents uniformly rise from the ground in parallel lines, white and blocky against a backdrop of dirt. Many tents are air-conditioned, but outside there is little reprieve from the scorching Texas heat. For many children, it’s an unfamiliar and unwelcome change.
Before this development, most migrant children lived in private foster homes or shelters. The shelters, while not ideal, are usually more regulated than the tents. They’re licensed and monitored by state child welfare authorities, who enforce standards on safety, education, staff hiring, and staff training. Children are clustered two or three to a room, and they receive regular schooling and visits with legal representatives.
But the tent city in Tornillo, Texas works a little differently. It’s on federal ground, so state officials have no authority. The only regulations are the guidelines created by the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS). The children sleep in bunks, sometimes twenty to a room. They don’t receive organized schooling; they’re given workbooks with no obligation to actually complete them. Their access to legal advice is also limited.
The Tornillo tent city was meant to be temporary. Opened in mid-June 2018, it was originally slated to stay open for 30 days. But as the amount of migrant children increased, the timeline was continually extended, and as of October 2018, it is still open. In fact, it’s more than open: it’s expanding. According to Texas Monthly, the number of beds increased from 1,200 to 3,800 in September, and the facility is now slated to stay open for the rest of the year.
Unsurprisingly, the tent city is not a productive environment for children already dealing with trauma. According to The New York Times, Leah Chavla, a lawyer with the Women’s Refugee Commission, said, “obviously we have concerns about kids falling through the cracks, not getting sufficient attention if they need attention, not getting the emotional or mental health care that they need.”
So far, these concerns seem to be founded. “The longer that children remain in custody,” The New York Times says, “the more likely they are to become anxious or depressed.” Anxiety and depression can lead to erratic behavior, such as violent outbursts or escape attempts. The suddenness of the move could also compound the trauma. Mental health issues are hard for shelters to deal with at the best of times, and a large facility like Tornillo is much more likely to overlook a struggling child.
The tent cities are obviously not the best solution, so why do they still exist?
There are two main reasons. Firstly, the amount of undocumented children in government custody has increased considerably. The majority of detained children crossed the border alone, but some were separated from their parents under the Trump administration’s zero-tolerance policy. The government is struggling to find room for around 13,000 detained migrant children, and tent cities seemed like an easy and effective way to provide housing.
Secondly, the zero-tolerance policy made it much more difficult to place children with sponsors. In June, federal authorities announced that potential sponsors and all other adults in the household would have to submit fingerprints. Historically, most sponsors were undocumented immigrants themselves, usually family of the detained children. If they submit their fingerprints, they run the risk of deportation. Already, dozens of people who applied to be sponsors have been arrested, 70 percent of whom did not have prior criminal records. Many potential sponsors have decided the risk just isn’t worth it.
These circumstances — the tent cities, the lack of sponsors, the children’s suffering — are a direct result of rhetoric from the Trump administration and its allies. The growing population of migrant children is due to the zero-tolerance policy; the lack of sponsors is due to the same. The Tornillo tent city, which costs $100 million a month in taxpayer money, is the result of racist and unsympathetic ideas.
The entire situation is a clear example of why rhetoric can be dangerous. It goes beyond hurt feelings and individual actions; it infects our government and institutions. It leads to intolerable living conditions and facilitates child abuse. An incendiary speech can be traced through time to crying children.
This is why we have to strike back at hateful rhetoric. Our society must draw a line. We must proclaim that we won’t tolerate the suffering of children and then follow that thread back to its source. Criticizing rhetoric is not an overreaction; it’s preventative of a much greater evil.
Fortunately, many politicians and influential figures have spoken against the cities and policies. Evelyn Stauffer, a spokeswoman for the HHS, said, “The number of families and unaccompanied alien children apprehended are a symptom of the larger problem, namely a broken immigration system...That is why HHS joins the president in calling on Congress to reform this broken system.”
While the wounds run deep, there is still hope. If we make ourselves as loud as our competition, we may be able to reverse the harmful decisions that have already been made, encourage compassionate policies, prevent such hateful rhetoric, and create a safer world for children of all legal statuses.

Midterms are officially less than a month away, and potential 2020 candidates are already eyeing up their chances of taking Trump. For the past year, the names of many Democrats have been thrown onto the list of 2020 hopefuls. Many of these potential Democratic candidates have remained tight-lipped about running for president because it would be a poor strategic move to jump the gun before the Midterms. Many Democrats have not announced their bids for President; however, their actions before the Midterm elections have led many to speculate. 
Senator Cory Booker’s name tends to be at the top of the list of 2020 Democratic candidates because he has been a prominent figure for the Democrats since he assumed office in 2013. Booker recently made news during the Brett Kavanaugh Senate hearing for threatening to release committee confidential documents related to Kavanaugh’s tenure in the George W. Bush administration. This threat came with a possible ousting from the Senate, since it violated the Senate rules; however, this threat was not as risky as it may have seemed since the documents had already been cleared for release. Despite this fact, Booker referred to the release of the documents as his “Spartacus” moment, when in fact, it was a political move to in preparation to announcing his bid.
Senator Kamala Harris (D-CA), Booker’s close friend and colleague on the Judiciary Committee, has risen to the top of the Democratic Party since she took office in 2017. Due to the recent events surrounding sexual assault allegations against Kavanaugh, Senator Harris has been a powerful anti-Kavanaugh voice on the Judiciary Committee, demonstrating her desire to run for president. During Dr. Ford’s testimony against Judge Kavanaugh, Senator Harris praised Dr. Ford and called her a “profile in courage,” causing Dr. Ford to tear up. Senator Harris has been an outspoken feminist supporter, with many women begging her to run for President.
At her Massachusetts town hall, Senator Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) declared that she would “take a hard look” at running for President after the Midterm elections. Warren’s name has been tossed around quite frequently after Trump was elected, as Warren has been a strong Trump critic. Warren would be a strong candidate to go head to head against Trump if she can provide a campaign that is optimistic, not one that singularly bashes the current administration.
Whoever wins the Democratic bid for the presidential nominee must not stoop down to Donald Trump’s level. Michael Avenatti, Stormy Daniels’ attorney, has stated that he is seriously considering a run for President in 2020 as he has been very popular in the news media. Avenatti probably would never win the Democratic bid for President; however, if he decides to run, he could gain attention from the news media for bashing Trump with his unfiltered attitude. 
The Democrats should not focus all of their energy on condemning Trump; rather, they should take notice of Beto O’Rourke and his impressive progressive campaign against Ted Cruz in Texas, which has historically been a deeply red state. While chances are slim that O’Rourke will win, his campaign should be the model for Democrats in the 2020 election because he has been able to persuade more moderate and conservative voters. 
Donald Trump does well in appealing to his base of voters, but in building that base he has alienated a large group of conservatives. Those conservative voters could be converted to votes for Democrats if the Democrats listen to their concerns instead of talking at them. A big problem within the Democratic Party is that they do not seem to know where they are headed. Some Democrats have become so focused on trolling Trump that they have forgotten what they actually stand for. In order to kick Trump out of office, the Democratic candidate must offer the nation a better option by highlighting policies and hopes for the future.

Ever since elementary school, we were always told to show our work, so that in the event we got the answer wrong, we could get some partial credit. Documenting your thought processes is most prevalent in the STEM fields, where exams are designed to assess topics requiring some element of computation and critical thinking.
The idea of receiving partial credit is great, not just because it helps students score better on exams, but because it encourages students to try to show what they know. However, despite the consensus among instructors that the process should matter more than the answer, in many cases, getting the answer wrong can still cost you a hefty amount of points. Sometimes, that can make the difference between letter grades.
Now yes, almost correct is not the same thing as correct, so the final answer is not irrelevant. However, no matter how well a student understands the process towards solving a problem, or no matter how ingenious their approach, there will always be the possibility of stupid or careless errors, ones that reflect the student’s humanity rather than their understanding.
It’s a tragic tale, one we see all too often in high school math and science classes: a student takes a test and attempts a problem, doing every step flawlessly up until the last one, where a negative sign gets dropped or the quantity two plus three magically becomes six. Thus, the final answer is incorrect, and points are deducted, sometimes in outrageously large quantities. Unlike in college, where professors understand that the purpose of a course is to teach you how to think about something, high school instructors are more focused on teaching you how to do something, and when the mechanics of a problem are the primary focus, the answer has a much higher value.
The issue is that there’s no way to eliminate the risk of careless mistakes aside from checking over your work countless times, which is something that you often can’t do under a time constraint. And it’s not the same as a failure in understanding, where the student fails in their application or recollection of a concept or method; that can be rectified with increased studying and practice. This narrow mindset of always trying to get the right answer leads to students being more preoccupied with doing everything correctly than comprehending everything correctly. Consequently, when the real goal is to become more agile and adaptive problem solvers, they’re being shortchanged.
In the real world, problems don’t have nicely predetermined solutions; otherwise, they wouldn’t be worth addressing. The emphasis here is entirely on what you know and how you can apply it, not if you can crunch numbers properly like a computer (we have calculators for a reason). By forcing students to waste time muddling through complex — but pointless — algebra or computing astronomical sums by hand, instructors are doing them a disservice by wasting their time, time that could otherwise be spent delving into new and intriguing concepts or going beyond the scope of the class. Students who receive this enrichment are better prepared for the struggles of post-secondary education and beyond, whereas those who do not find it difficult to grapple with deviations from the standard of perfection.
Some will argue that the repetition of basics is important, especially for people that find learning challenging. By no means am I advocating that slower students should be left behind in favor of pandering to the more accelerated ones, or vice versa; rather, I believe that all students can benefit from more process-oriented learning and more focus on mastering the material rather than their exams. Already, there’s been some substantial progress made on this front, with most tests requiring a written explanation for an answer or moving towards including questions that ask students to describe a certain problem-solving process rather than explicitly implementing it.
The whole point of a good education system is to turn students into effective problem solvers, and that process really takes off right around high school. As the world becomes increasingly complex and interconnected, so too do the challenges in every realm of inquiry. It is imperative that we arm students not only with the correct knowledge but also the correct mindset for learning. Education is a lifelong process, and it’s not about what you do at the beginning or end, but at every step along the way.

Last week, the Senate heard testimonies from both Brett Kavanaugh and Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, one of the women who has accused Kavanaugh of sexual assault. The two testimonies couldn’t have been more different, and many Republicans claimed that they were equally credible. Dr. Ford offered a very powerful testimony recounting her sexual assault and calmly answered questions from senators. It was a moment destined to go down in the history books, as Ford held her ground in front of several men questioning her credibility.
Kavanaugh’s testimony was the polar opposite. He dodged several questions, got angry and defensive, and lashed out during the entire process. Throughout the hearing, he acted like a petulant and entitled child rather than the innocent man he claimed to be. Yet he got a lot of praise from Republican senators for having an incredible testimony. I would like to take a step back from the crimes that Kavanaugh is accused of or the credibility of the two testimonies and simply focus on his actions in the testimony.
The Supreme Court is a significant last resort for decision processes in the United States. It’s up to nine individuals to determine the law of the land, divorced from political party affiliations and based on their interpretation of the Constitution. That’s what makes Kavanaugh’s behavior so deeply concerning. To directly quote him from the testimony:
“This whole two-week effort has been a calculated and orchestrated political hit, fueled with apparent pent-up anger about President Trump and the 2016 election.”
This should not be the tone of someone who is going to be on the Supreme Court. It sounded like he channeled the spirit of Trump to make that statement. The Supreme Court isn’t meant to be a partisan institution. Of course, due to the nomination process being started by the President, the court certainly isn’t entirely nonpartisan. However, Kavanaugh’s testimony speaks volumes, showing that he will approach cases in his tenure with a clear and inherent bias.
He also provided very misleading defenses to the committee. The most significant example was when he stated that three people Dr. Ford had mentioned in her statement, two of whom were his friends and one of whom was her longtime friend, had denied her account. This isn’t true. Not corroborating Dr. Ford’s account does not equate to a denial of her account. As a supposed expert in law, he should be well aware of this distinction, and yet, he willfully chose to make this statement at the hearing. It shows cracks in his honesty and temperament, and this wasn’t the sole scenario. When asked about terms that he used, such as “boofing” or “devil’s triangle,” he called the terms a reference to “flatulence” and a “drinking game” respectively, neither of which is true. It’s flat-out perjury because he lied about what those words really mean.
His responses to some simple questions, such as questions about whether or not he was prone to blacking out or how much he drank, were boorish and hostile. He would turn the question back on the senators, talk over them, or avoid the questions entirely. He didn’t even outright say that he would support an FBI investigation into the allegations. In any other scenario, anyone who acted as Kavanaugh did would likely have been held in contempt of court. Instead of being composed as a judge should, he opted to be belligerent and aggressive in both his prepared speech and answers to questions.
Of course, for Republicans, none of this matters. Having a conservative judge on the court is essential for them, since Kavanaugh’s confirmation would guarantee a conservative majority. This has been a big talking point to muster up support for the midterm elections and galvanize the Republican voter base. An NBC/NPR/Marist Poll showed that 54 percent of Republicans would support Kavanaugh’s confirmation, even if the assault allegations are proven to be true. Republicans chose to stick by Kavanaugh because if they didn’t, they’d be seen as weak and ineffective, even if it would be the right choice to pick somebody else from the Federalist Society list that Kavanaugh was picked from. Be it Bill Clinton or Brett Kavanaugh, powerful men who further political agendas will always get a pass even though they clearly don’t deserve it.
Dr. Ford herself said in her testimony that she was afraid she would uproot her entire life by coming and speaking out. Unfortunately, she found herself testifying only for nothing to happen and for the status quo to be maintained. In fact, after the hearing, Orrin Hatch referred to Dr. Ford as a “pleasing” witness. The senators listened to Dr. Ford, but they didn’t hear her because they had already made up their minds on Kavanaugh. For them, politics and power are more important than the trauma and abuse faced by survivors of sexual assault. Allowing Kavanaugh in the Supreme Court will go down in history as one of the greatest mistakes ever made in our nation’s history.

#MeToo. #TimesUp. Now #BelieveWomen has gained traction on social media to call attention to the prevalence of sexual assault, bolstered by Dr. Christine Blasey Ford's recent hearing regarding the allegations against Associate Justice of the Supreme Court nominee, Brett Kavanaugh. The discussion of how we prevent future cases of sexual assault and how we handle current cases is now front and center.
Given current statistics, true allegations supersede false accusations, and it is estimated that 60 percent of rapes go unreported. Therefore, it is understandable where the sentiment "believe women" comes from: women are far more likely to not report a rape than they are to falsely claim they have been raped.
In Ford's case, I find it very likely that Kavanaugh assaulted her. However, the reach of #BelieveWomen exceeds far beyond the Supreme Court nomination. Even after the votes, we still must grapple with how to deal with sexual assault.
It is unfortunate that due process is necessary. If there was a way to bring forth justice without forcing victims to relive their traumatic experiences, I like to believe such a method would have been brought to the public's attention. However, the Sixth Amendment grants all the right to a fair trial. In the case of the Scottsboro boys in 1931, "believe women" cost nine African American teenage men their lives without a chance for any of them to redeem their innocence. Of course, the boys' Sixth Amendment rights were infringed; the court was obviously racially biased. However, it demonstrates what the absence of the Sixth Amendment could lead to. Of course, the same right must be granted to victims of sexual assault, and too often, that’s not the case. For that, I will agree with the general consensus of #BelieveWomen. However, due process is still necessary, and simply hearing someone's testimony, unfortunately, is not enough.
Additionally, the name itself can appear to further reinforce the male-perpetrator-female-victim trope that many have ingrained in their heads. One could argue that this exists because sexual assault affects more females than males. This may be technically true, but we must reconsider that premise. In 2016, a study from the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) estimated that approximately 38 percent of victims of sexual violence are male. So yes, as of 2016, the proportion of females to males differ by ten percentage points. However, we cast aside over a third of the people whom we are trying to help: sexual assault victims. The message #BelieveWomen can easily be perverted into becoming an environment where male victims fear that their voices against their female perpetrators won't be heard. Consent needs to exist regardless of characteristics such as age, gender, and sexuality; gendering a societal problem that affects more than just women alienates non-female-identifying victims.
So what do I believe #BelieveWomen should be? It should not involve automatically dismissing or delegitimizing someone's personal experiences. Too often are people shamed or silenced. However, this is more of a problem involving people's mindsets than it is implementing new policies. Some suggestions on improving this dialogue would be to incorporate consent in schools' health class curricula, having more accessible resources such as hotlines and shelters, and promoting education on how to best support someone who experienced sexual assault. A trending hashtag on Twitter is a good start in capturing people's attention and initiating a conversation. However, now we must move towards continuing the dialogue to ensure justice for the victims, and to prevent assault from happening in the first place.
