From Thursday to Saturday, thousands gathered in Philadelphia for the annual NFL Draft. On Thursday, NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell was greeted with customary boos from the fans, even seeming to dare the crowd to get louder before officially putting the Cleveland Browns on the clock for the first pick of the night. Now that the draft is over, it’s time to make horribly wrong predictions about which team in each division improved their chances of winning most in the near and long term.
AFC North
Discipline seems to be the new focus in Cleveland, as the Browns looked like they might have actually done something right in the draft. Granted, they’re almost guaranteed to have a losing season next year, since they haven’t really addressed the future of the quarterback position. What players the Browns did pick up in the draft look to be building blocks for a better future. Rather than be swayed by the temptation of picking up another quarterback at a high draft spot, the Browns instead used the first overall pick to select Texas A&M defensive end Myles Garrett, putting a strong presence on the front line who eagerly anticipates the challenge of taking down quarterbacks like Ben Roethlisberger of the Pittsburgh Steelers. Michigan safety Jabrill Peppers could serve as a positive presence in the secondary, and Miami tight end David Njoku might end up as a playmaker once the Browns secure the quarterback position. Getting an additional first-round pick in 2018 was the icing on the cake of a strong Day One, and the pieces seem to be in place for the foundation of a competitive team.
Except it’s Cleveland, and they’ll probably screw up somewhere along the line.
AFC East
I hate the Patriots. I hate the Patriots. I HATE THE PATRIOTS! Did I mention I hate the New England Patriots? I really do, and I hate to write anything good about them, but I think they had a pretty good draft despite their two first picks coming from late in the third round. How in the world does a team without a first or second-round pick have a good draft that improves their chances of winning? Well, they’re the Patriots, which means it’s almost guaranteed that they’re going to win the division unless quarterback Tom Brady is injured for the whole year. The other reason is that they traded their early picks for players that have already shown promise in the league. The Patriots traded their first-round pick to the New Orleans Saints in exchange for wide receiver Brandin Cooks and a fourth round pick, probably the best use for the 32nd overall pick as they could have gotten. They traded their second round pick to the Carolina Panthers for defensive end Kony Ealy, a pass rusher who will continue making it difficult for teams who need to play catch-up with the Patriots’ offense. Much like the Browns are consistently bad, the Patriots have been consistently good in the era of head coach Bill Belichick. Though most experts grade their division rivals higher than the Patriots, these post-draft grades are completely meaningless, especially when said teams inevitably fall short of the expectation of challenging the Patriots.
AFC South
Despite losing defensive end J.J. Watt to injury for the year, the Houston Texans ended up winning their division and won their Wild Card Weekend matchup against the Oakland Raiders before getting destroyed by the Patriots in the second round of the playoffs. The key component hampering the Texans was the play at quarterback, having committed a lot of money for the mediocre play of Brock Osweiler. Trading up to get Clemson quarterback Deshaun Watson might have cost the team a future first-round pick, but it would be entirely worth it if Watson becomes the offensive leader that Houston needs to rise above its rivals.
AFC West
The Raiders put up strong efforts throughout the 2016 season, but the injury to quarterback Derek Carr late in the season cost the team the division win and their playoff game against Houston. While the division-winning Kansas City Chiefs commanded the most attention in the division by trading up to pick Texas Tech quarterback Patrick Mahomes, the Raiders steadily pushed forward with the team-building strategy that transformed Oakland from the perennial laughing stock back into a legitimate playoff contender. Ohio State cornerback Gareon Conley and Connecticut safety Obi Melifonwu add to a secondary that looks more ready to counter the passing attacks the Chiefs and the Los Angeles Chargers will attempt to develop and use against them.
NFC North
The Green Bay Packers operate differently from most teams in the league. Rather than trying to make big splashes in free agency, the Packers instead build their team through the draft the old-fashioned way, and this year seems to be no different. With Aaron Rodgers at quarterback, a slew of receiving options, and a good enough offensive line, the Packers prioritized defense this year, starting with Washington cornerback Kevin King off a trade down with the Browns. Green Bay then took North Carolina State safety Josh Jones to further strengthen the secondary before nabbing Auburn defensive tackle Montravius Adams in the third round to help with the defensive line. When the Detroit Lions are the only current threat to the division crown, you know you’re in a good position.
NFC East
In contrast to the relatively clear NFC North, the NFC East is a perennial free-for-all in which all the teams could end up winning the division or otherwise make the playoffs. With no clear winner, I’ll give a slight edge to the Dallas Cowboys since they won the division last year after striking big offensively with running back Ezekiel Elliot and quarterback Dak Prescott. This year, the priority was defense, starting with Michigan defensive end Taco Charlton. Colorado cornerback Chidobe Awuzie and Michigan cornerback Jourdan Lewis solidify the secondary against the passing threats present from the New York Giants, Philadelphia Eagles, and Washington Redskins. It’s always tough to repeat in the NFC East, but the Cowboys still appear to be in a strong position going forward with a strong offensive line and a young quarterback and running back duo. Defense is a concern, but an average defense could still be good enough for Dallas.
NFC South
I’m a huge Saints fan, but I hesitate to say good things about their draft since general manager Mickey Loomis has not inspired me with his personnel decisions over the past three consecutive 7–9 seasons. That being said, six picks in the first three rounds certainly brings the opportunity to break past the past few years of mediocrity. With an absolutely horrendous defense over the past few years, it’s no surprise that the Saints addressed each piece of the defense in the draft, but they also couldn’t help taking some offensive players. Ohio State cornerback Marshon Lattimore was considered the best cover corner available in the draft, so his slide to eleventh overall seems to be a perfect selection for New Orleans, assuming he stays healthy. Utah safety Marcus Williams could be a strong asset in the secondary while Florida linebacker Alex Anzalone could be a versatile presence. With the pick from trading away Cooks, the Saints added Wisconsin offensive tackle Ryan Ramczyk, hopefully someone who can both protect quarterback Drew Brees and help open lanes for running backs Mark Ingram, Adrian Peterson, and the newly drafted Alvin Kamara out of Tennessee. If the Saints’ offense stays as strong as it has been and the defense transforms into even an average NFL defense, this year could be different for New Orleans in Brees’s twilight years.
NFC West
The Seattle Seahawks remain favorites to win the division going forward. The Seahawks’ six picks between the second and third rounds could result in a strong presence to integrate into the team. Either that, or this is a poor attempt to compensate for the universally criticized 2012 draft class that experts had predicted would be terrible. Anyways, the Seahawks managed to pick up Michigan State defensive tackle Malik McDowell after trading out of the first round, picking up a sixth rounder in the process. LSU center Ethan Pocic could become a nice addition to the offensive line, and Michigan wide receiver Amara Darboh could be a good new weapon for quarterback Russell Wilson. With these and other players in the Seahawks’ draft class, it is hard to see any of the other teams in the division stealing the crown outside of any devastating injuries to the Seahawks’ key players.

Serena Williams is one of the greatest tennis players of all time. Moreover, she’s one of the greatest athletes of all time. She has won 39 major titles (23 of them in Grand Slam singles).
She has dominated her sport for nearly two decades, and will continue to do so in the next few years if her victory in this year’s Australian Open is any indication.
Throughout her career, she has battled controversy and criticism on topics from her on-court behavior to her body type.
On Thursday, April 20, Williams announced on Snapchat that she is pregnant with her first child with fiancé Alexis Ohanian, co-founder of Reddit. She immediately received an outflow of public support, including from Andy Roddick and Chris Evert.
Not all reactions were as positive. In a news conference for the Fed Cup, tennis legend and Romanian captain Ilie Nastase was heard commenting on Williams’ pregnancy, “Let's see what color it has. Chocolate with milk?"
The International Tennis Federation (ITF) immediately announced an investigation of Nastase, and Williams (who is black; Ohanian is white) responded on her Instagram account, “It disappoints me to know we live in a society which people like Ilie Nastase can make such racist comments towards myself and unborn child, and sexist comments against my peers.”
Nastase, nicknamed “Nasty" during his time as a player, has also been accused of insulting and abusing women on and off the court. Nastase later released a statement apologizing for his comments, saying, “My reaction was spontaneous,” after hearing the news of Williams’ pregnancy for the first time. In another interview, Nastase complained, “Anything I say, I am the bad boy,” blaming the media for creating scandal instead of covering more important topics.
Nastase’s comments were racist and derogatory. The fact that he feels his actions are excusable because they were “spontaneous” is troubling. Today, many people like to ignore racism and bigotry, claiming it to be a thing of the past, something conquered long ago by a different generation. But racism continues to permeate throughout society, consciously and subconsciously, influencing the ways we think and act. His reaction was ignorant, and he did not comprehend the problem of his comments, which ultimately portrays him as a spoiled bigot unable to face the consequences of his words.
In her Instagram post, Williams puts the situation best: “I have said it once and I’ll say it again, this world has come so far but yet we have so much further to go. Yes, we have broken down so many barriers — however there are a plethora more to go.”

The immune system is an amazing ensemble of organs, cells and substances that work to identify and fight off foreign agents, such as bacteria and viruses. It attempts to keep an individual free from illnesses and infections. But did you know, thanks to recent research in the past few decades, that with the appropriate treatment, the immune system could be instrumental in curing cancer, one of the leading causes of death in America?
Known as immunotherapy, the treatment has joined the ranks of other forms of cancer treatment, including surgery, radiation, chemotherapy, and targeted therapy. Cancer involves the uncontrollable growth of cells, or tumors, in the body, and the aforementioned treatments are designed to kill off the tumors. But what differentiates immunotherapy from other forms of cancer treatment is its efforts to bolster the body’s natural defenses in fighting cancer. A complex disease, cancer thrives when it goes unnoticed by the immune system, as cancer cells can appear very similar to normal cells. In other cases, the immune system may recognize the cancer cells as harmful, but do not provoke a strong enough response to stop the cancer. 
To address the issues, scientists developed different kinds of immunotherapies. Cancer vaccines are one such kind. Similar to the way vaccines expose the body to weakened forms of infections in order to strengthen the immune response to the infection, cancer vaccines are designed to enhance immune system attack on cancer. Such a feat is accomplished by exposing the body to harmless or weakened, entireties or pieces of cancer cells. The body may also be exposed to antigens from the cancer through the vaccines. Antigens are proteins that induce the immune response. Despite its evidence of its promise, cancer vaccine have so far shown limited effectiveness in treating cancer.
A more major type of immunotherapy involves the administration of proteins called monoclonal antibodies. When injected into and circulated in the bloodstream, the antibodies recognize and bind to antigens, in a manner reminiscent of fitting a key to its appropriate lock. Hence, antibodies can be designed to bind to the antigens that are found on cancer cells, allowing the cancer to be marked for destruction by the immune system. A monoclonal antibody can work by itself, or it can also be structurally joined with other components, such as a chemotherapy drug, radioactive particle, or another monoclonal antibody. 
Another type of immunotherapy, and the most widely used, uses immune checkpoint inhibitors, which also employ the use of monoclonal antibodies. According to the American Cancer Society, checkpoint inhibitors can be thought of as drug that “take the "brakes’ off" of the immune system. 
The purpose of checkpoints is to ensure that normal cells do not get attacked as immune cells attack potentially harmful agents in the body. However, with the help of the checkpoints, cancer cells can find ways to evade the detection of the immune system. Inhibitors of the checkpoints would help to prevent that evasion.
In the 1980s, the checkpoint, CTLA-4, was discovered by French scientists. CTLA-4 is a protein that can be found on T-cells, which serve as a form of offense for the immune system. In a 1996 paper from the journal Nature, James P. Allison, a scientist at the University of California, Berkeley, stated that antibodies could target and bind to CTLA-4. Thereby, the antibodies could suppress activity of CTLA-4, and in turn, help to boost the activity of T-cells, which would ultimately enhance the immune system’s ability to fight cancer cells. Later on, in 1999, scientists at Medarex, a former American biopharmaceutical company, initiated development of the antibodies that were proposed by Allison. Once the antibodies, or checkpoint inhibitors, were developed and tested for appropriate safety and efficacy, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved the drug in 2011. Known as an anti-CTLA-4 therapy, Yervoy is used to treat advanced-stage melanoma, a common type of skin cancer. 
Clinical successes seen from anti-CTLA-4 therapy helped to establish the field of immunotherapy. Other checkpoints have also been discovered, concurrently with the development of Yervoy, including proteins called PD-1 and PD-L1. Therapies for the checkpoints were also developed in drugs, including Keytruda and Opdivo, which are used to treat certain kinds of cancer. Sometimes, a few different checkpoint inhibitors are applied in combination to increase the efficacy of the immunotherapy in patients. Researchers also hope to use checkpoint inhibitors in combination with cancer vaccines.
Yet, despite the effectiveness of the antibody therapy in some patients, the drugs do not actually work for the majority of patients due to a variety of factors, such as having certain kinds of genes that make the immunotherapy less effective. Immunotherapy treatments can cause severe and fatal side effects through overstimulation of the immune system. Furthermore, immunotherapy drugs are expensive, costing as much as a few hundred thousand dollars a year.
While researchers are have much to do to improve such a form of cancer treatment, immunotherapy brings the hope that a more definitive cure for cancer will be developed in the near future.

In a study reported in Nature Communications earlier this week, researchers at the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia created an artificial womb that sustained a prematurely delivered lamb for up to four weeks. The study involved several different trials, with each trial incorporating the features that the previous one failed on.
Prenatal birth — that is, when a fetus is delivered before 37 weeks of gestation — is the leading cause of perinatal mortality. Should the fetus survive to infancy, premature birth may cause a higher risk of cerebral palsy, development delay, and sight and hearing problems. In fact, according to an article in Science, it is the very mechanisms meant to keep fetuses alive that cause problems. For instance, mechanical ventilation often has a detrimental effect on an infant’s respiratory system by either harming the lungs itself or impeding proper lung development. Researchers have tried several different methods and devices that mimic the natural conditions of a womb, to almost a near success, but this method stands out because of its simplicity and the minimized use of external intervention. 
The artificial womb experiment maintained a closed fluid environment around the lamb using a bio-bag, in which the artificial amniotic fluid is circulated by the lamb’s heart and lungs without the help of any pumps or resistors. An oxygenator was a part of the process too, but influenced the circulation rate minimally. This helped maintain normal vitals and prevent heart failure. The fluid surrounding the fetus was nutrition- and oxygen-rich and the placenta was fed through external ports that were maintained to be sterile to prevent infection.
This experiment could be a step forward in reducing perinatal mortality rates and the risks that come with premature birth.

On Friday, April 21, Great Britain finally turned off the coal — for 24 hours, at least. This marks the first day since the Industrial Revolution that Britain did not rely on coal to power its electricity. 
The Industrial Revolution, a transition between manufacturing processes, began in Great Britain in the early 1800s and saw the emergence of coal as a primary energy source. Since then, coal has shaped industries, jobs, and lifestyles for mining towns in Britain and around the world. 
As is the case with any fossil fuel, coal affected the climate over the centuries. Burning coal results in pea soup fogs — thick smog that contains soot particles combined with sulfur dioxide. In comparison to burning natural gas, burning coal results in nearly twice as much carbon dioxide, a greenhouse gas. To combat the greenhouse gas effect, scientists are looking more closely into alternative energy sources, such as solar and wind. 
There has been a steep decline in the coal industry in recent years, culminating in the last deep coal mine in Britain closing in 2015. Britain as a whole is aiming to phase out all coal production and rely solely on natural gas and renewable energy. 
“Symbolically, this is a milestone,” said Sean Kemp, a spokesman for National Grid, Britain’s power grid operator. “A kind of end of an era.” 
This isn’t the first time the National Grid has cut coal. Last May was the first time that coal generation of electricity dropped to zero; that only lasted a few hours, though. The second longest stretch of time the National Grid has reached without coal was 19 hours. This was made possible since, during the springtime, less electricity is used due to better natural lighting and temperature (resulting in little need for either heating or air conditioning). The power-down that recently happened, however, lasted from Thursday at 11 p.m. until Friday around midnight. 
“To have the first working day without coal since the start of the Industrial Revolution is a watershed moment in how our energy system is changing,” said Cordi O’Hara, director of U.K. system operator at National Grid, in an interview with Financial Times. 
Other countries have started jumping on the no-coal bandwagon, as well. Switzerland, Belgium, and Norway have been operating with zero coal for some years now. In the United States, which depends on coal for 30 percent of power generation, Vermont and Idaho are coal-free. 
Hannah Martin, head of energy at Greenpeace U.K., told The Guardian, “The direction of travel is that both in the U.K. and globally we are already moving towards a low carbon economy.” 
A “low carbon economy” is not a luxury, but a necessity to secure the health and longevity of both our planet and ourselves. 
If Britain manages to make this the norm, the Northern Hemisphere could possibly reduce its carbon emissions. The Northern Hemisphere produces the most emissions.

Saturn’s moon Enceladus contains molecular hydrogen, which many microbes use as food, scientists announced this month. And if microbe food is present on Enceladus, microscopic alien organisms could be too. 
Enceladus, long thought to be a strong candidate for extraterrestrial life in our own solar system, has an icy crust with a vast ocean beneath. This ocean is heated by gravitational forces, and when it gets hot enough, the water forces through cracks in the ice and shoots into space — creating large plumes, like a geyser. 
Scientists working on NASA’s Cassini mission wondered whether there was anything in these plumes besides water. On Oct. 28, 2015, the Cassini probe bypassed the moon’s south pole at less than half the speed it had in previous fly¬bys. The slow speed allowed Cassini to collect accurate data and samples from the plumes erupting out of the 80-mile-long parallel cracks in the ice known as Enceladus’s ‘tiger stripes.’ 
The plumes were almost entirely water, as the scientists had predicted, but they contained between 0.4 and 1.4 percent molecular hydrogen — a level “way above the limit for life,” according to NASA astrogeophysicist Chris McKay. “The ocean of Enceladus would be a nice place for life.” The plumes contained trace amounts of carbon dioxide, methane, and ammonia. 
The exciting presence of hydrogen raised another question — where is it coming from? After consulting data from this and other missions, and ruling out the possibility that it was leftover material from the moon’s formation, scientists concluded that this much hydrogen could be produced only by extensive hydrothermal activity under Enceladus’s ocean. 
“We are not saying Enceladus has life, but the discovery does move the moon higher on the list of potentially habitable places in the solar system,” says atmospheric scientist J. Hunter Waite. There is indeed such a list: Enceladus is just one of many moons in our solar system that might sustain alien microbes. Its neighbor, Saturn’s moon Titan, has an atmosphere and oceans of methane where methane-dependent life forms could flourish.

Apple will redesign its major stores for first time in 15 years
Apple plans to redesign its major stores in key locations. The change comes at a time when Apple is shifting to a greener operation structure. Apple stores haven't been redesigned in a major way since 2002. 
There are many changes Apple plans to include in the renovation. 500 stores will see the addition of living trees, clearer and more energy-efficient display screens, and open conference rooms open to use by local companies. Furthermore, an educational program called "Today at Apple" will be introduced that teaches customers how to use movie and photo editing applications. 
Apple hopes this new design will make their stores a community center where people spend their time, rather than simply a space for commerce.

Five shows in one weekend, and it was all sold out. Needless to say, committing to writing a review for this show without a ticket locked down was beginning to make me anxious. Fortunately, the School of Drama’s box office has a wonderful waitlist system, where you can receive the tickets of those who don’t show up at no cost at all. Thus, by arriving promptly on the scene, we were added to the waitlist, and soon ushered in to Purnell’s Helen Wayne Rauh Studio Theatre.
The stage was set with gaudy gold-accented furniture
and a faux-marbled floor. My eyes immediately darted towards the numerous green screens placed around the stage at different angles, one of which was below a balcony in what seemed to be a confining box.
As people settled in, *Wife U’*s protagonist — who quickly became a difficult character to empathize with — strutted onto stage towards the audience, and gestured with his arm towards the stage. How did we know he was a character? He was dressed in a gold waistcoat and blindingly white pants, with delightfully horrid animal print loafers. He soon added a gold-clad staff, and a white blazer embroidered with gold patterns and a large golden “S” on the back. This was Monsieur De La Souche, played by senior musical theater major Clay Singer, starting off Wife U with an impressive display of wealth and arrogance.
Wife U is the story of how Monsieur De La Souche, also known by his “boring” name, Arnolphe, works to wed a woman whom he has been raising since she was four for the specific purpose of designing her to be the perfect, “simple” (or — as the other characters point — dumb) wife. He set up a private school where she learned little to nothing apart from domestic skills such as cooking, cleaning, knitting, singing, and being polite. Agnes, played by senior musical theater major Amanda Fallon Smith, is the fruit of his efforts, his ideal “simple” woman, who he is all set to marry. Unfortunately for Arnolphe, the son of a close friend, Horace — played by senior musical theater major John Clay III — also falls for Agnes, creating an incredibly unsettling love triangle.
Wife U is Eric Powell’s adaptation of School for Wives, written by the seventeenth century French playwright Molière. The play, through its many renditions and performances, has stood to draw attention towards the ethics of marriage, touching on themes of arranged marriages, love, and schematically strategic weddings.
What was most remarkable about this production was the use of the aforementioned green screens. In scenes where letters from one lover to another were being read, actors stood before overtly extravagant backdrops and appeared together on screen while being physically separated. The screens were also used to create effects of falling or walking through scenery, and they never failed to make the audience chuckle. In addition to the cameras used for the green screens, Arnolphe carried a hand held camera that fed to the screens all around the stage. In moments of distress, we had the distinct pleasure of seeing his angry and tense expressions up close, as he spoke with high proximity to the lens. The screens were also humorously used for a variety of karaoke renditions throughout the performance. Topical songs accompanied the plot, such as Madonna’s “Like a Virgin,” Lesley Gore’s “You Don’t Own Me,” and The Runaway’s “Cherry Bomb.” This gave the actors a chance to show off their vocals and belt with an energy that livened up the audience, and gave the director a chance to update the play without significantly altering the script. It was goofy, and still integral to the plot. It was possibly my favorite part of the show.
If you’re not interested in tech, don’t fret, this play had the delicious dramatic irony that any real-life drama-lover would delight in. As Horace attempts to woo Agnes, he confides in Arnolphe, thinking that he and Monsieur de la Souche are in fact two different individuals. As you can imagine, the reveal scene was quite a treat to watch, and had my friend and I shaking in our seats. Senior musical theater majors Iris Beaumier and Lea DiMarchi, who were dually cast as Arnolphe’s close friends and the maids of the household, made the drama even more exciting, acting both as Arnolphe’s co-conspirators and his biggest critics. Beaumier and DiMarchi transformed from mustached old men to quirky French maids throughout the performance, giving the audience another reason to chuckle.
This adaptation also brought in elements of breaking the fourth wall, pulling the audience into the plot, and forcing us to really mull over what was happening to Agnes. The further removed you are from the plot, the less morally ambiguous the plot appears to be. Agnes appears happy, and just confused by the greater world, until we see her interactions with Arnolphe and hear her letters. Arnolphe seems giddy and superficial until we hear his asides and soliloquies. The dialogue is rhythmic and poetic, with the characters speaking in meter, but still managed to project a sort of depth that was honestly unexpected. I wanted to hate Arnolphe by the end of the play, when Agnes leaves him for Horace, but instead I felt sorry for him. I found myself wondering whether it was his own upbringing that dictated his fall, or if he was a fundamentally terrible human being. Selfishness always comes from somewhere, and in this case it was the insecurity of a rich man with a little too much control over the world around him.
On a brighter note, this play screams girl power by the end, but takes a while to get there. The mood shifted from light-hearted, to melancholy, to dark as the love triangle spins further out of control. It is cathartic to see Agnes’ slow realization of the world that exists beyond her bubble and to see her coming to terms with her prescribed ignorance. The more she knows, the more she takes ownership of herself and fights for the right to be who she wants to be.
In the end, Agnes declares her independence both from Arnolphe and Horace during her rendition of “You Don’t Own Me,” deciding to be with Horace but stay unwed. Her decision to avoid marriage, despite being with her “one true love” was the cherry on top of this story. The audience absolutely loved the “don’t need no man” attitude that festered in the female characters, and was glad to see all the male characters wake up and realize that the world does not revolve around their desires.

Rain without a cloud
Why do you always have to make me proud
It falls from your face
So stop the search for a better place
Under your guiding light
You lose yourself tonight
So smile a broken smile
You know my dear it's been a while
Since you've been away
Dying to live another day
I don't think you're back today
But I'm hoping you're here to stay
Because every time
I look in your restless eyes
This world I see
It matters so much to me
You're so alive
More than you'll ever know
So take a lie
And bury it in the snow
A life of injury
You run because you're afraid to bleed
Don't you look inside
You'll find that there's so much you hide
But when you're alone at night
Do you cringe without the light
Because every time
I look in your reckless eyes
This world I see
It matters so much to me
You're so alive
More than you'll ever show
So take a lie
And bury it in the snow

Dear Ruth,
Well, there goes another semester. There’s only one thing standing between me and a relaxing summer — finals week. Well, that and the fact that I didn’t manage to snag an internship this summer. I’m not really sure what to say to my family when they inevitably ask me why I’m not working. It’s not like I didn’t try — I’ve been applying to jobs since October! It just wasn’t meant to be, I guess, but I’m not sure my parents see it that way. What do I do?
All the best,
I Need a D*** Internship, ASAP
Dear INDIA,
To your parents, and honestly, to yourself — it’s okay to not have an internship this summer. It’s okay to not have an internship any summer. Your personal worth is in no way based off of the number of internships you’ve held, the amount of money you’ve made, or the awards you’ve won. You are still worthy of existence even if your grand total in all of those areas is zero. If anyone tries to tell you otherwise — be it your family, your friends, or the uber-capitalist hell-scape we live in — then they’re wrong. Your purpose in life is not to make money, or a name for yourself, or whatever. Your purpose is to be whatever kind of person you want to be. (And, if that kind of person is like me, and prefers a spiteful reason to reject the value placed on constant work, well, buying into that idea is ascribing to the Machiavellian, patriarchal myth of liberal individualism. Fight the man.)
But, alright, most of us cannot survive on ideals alone — will you actually be okay if you can’t get an internship? Won’t it ruin your job prospects? Will you be passed over for job after job in favor of someone who had an internship this summer?
Honestly? Probably not. Technically the idea behind the whole internship concept is that the intern benefits by learning skills to work in a profession they’re interested in, and the company benefits by helping to cultivate a pool of people with the skills to do that same kind of job. We all know that’s bull, though. Unless you’re lucky and you land one of the really good (or really paid) internships, you’re mostly a source of free labor. Sorry. Usually, the most you get out of an internship is a line to put on your resume and a possible reference for future applications — neither of which are the be-all and end-all of getting a job after graduation.
Honestly, a lot of college students spend their summers without internships. It really shouldn’t be a surprise, too. There is no company on earth that has more internship positions than positions for actual real jobs. (Nike actually told a friend of mine to apply for a real job because it was less competitive than their internships.) If you’re worried about being bored? Set yourself a personal project. Write a book, draw a comic strip, or get a summer job to pay for that tuition hike. Maybe volunteer somewhere. Take some time for yourself and chill out... until you have to come back for yet another year.
H. A. G. S.,
Ruth

For our very last Bar Buddies adventure, Zeke and I forced ourselves away from familiar haunts and journeyed all the way to Southside, a Pittsburgh neighborhood actually known for its nightlife. By eleven on a Saturday, the streets were crowded with largish groups of friends dressed and hyped for a crazy night. Zeke and I, stone-cold sober in our jeans and t-shirts, felt too out-of-place for many of the bars and all of the night-clubs. We wandered for a little while before settling on Jack’s Bar, an eclectic little dive bar and Southside fixture.
The Location: The side of East Carson closer to campus has a few bars, but then the action concentrates into a string of nightclubs and restaurants. Jack’s is on the other side of that stretch. This puts it firmly within range of everything that one could need after a bar trip: food available late into the night and even more bars. Considering the experience at Jack’s, that barhopping option is a plus. It also means the 54 will take you where you need to be from Morewood and Craig. The trip is a bit long by bus, but if you have several stops, it can definitely be worth it.
The drinks: We both ordered whiskey sours for $4.50. Since the bartender made the drinks right in front of us, I can say with confidence that they were 80 percent ice, 19 percent sugar, and 1 percent alcohol. We downed our carbonated sugar beverages in about three minutes flat. The last inch of my drink had me crunching sugar crystals between my teeth, and I would’ve had to buy at least five more to be less than sober. It really wasn’t worth it to order a second, especially since Jack’s only accepts cash. They have an ATM, but the withdrawal fee was half the price of my drink. All in all, the drinks were cheap but neither effective or tasty. Jack’s also advertised a mix of typical and more eccentric bar food, from burgers to mac n’ cheese bites, but no one seemed to be eating.
The vibe: Jack’s is a dive bar, complete with smoking and some bar games. We went on a night that happened to be both a Saturday and the night of a dominant Penguins win. This meant the bar was pretty lively and occasionally got very loud. The space behind the bar matched the ambience, with hand-drawn signs advertising drinks with fun ingredients like Pop Rocks. People came through the bar ordering beers, gin and tonics, and even a Swedish Fish. The varied drink orders matched the varied crowd, which blended some college aged kids with groups of older people and everywhere in between.
Jack’s was more conducive to having a real night out to drink with a few buddies than a couple people sitting down to talk. The mood doesn’t lend itself to quiet conversation. Large tables that lined the outside of the bar were designed for large groups, which made sense given the rest of the atmosphere.
Lit or Nah: Jack’s falls just short of lit-itude, mostly because it can’t quite decide what kind of bar it wants to be. It’s too loud, the crowd too pushy, and the seating options too limited for it to be a pub where you can chew the fat with a bro. Meanwhile, the drinks are too weak and the music is too variable to make it a real party destination. Jack’s is best as one quick stop in a Southside barhopping trip. Next time you’re in the neighborhood, duck inside to appreciate the quirky local vibe and then duck back out to find somewhere with decent drinks.

From plastic waste to the German Subway system to creating mindful spaces, the featured work in the Miller Gallery’s most recent exhibit, What Do We Know?, focused on political and social matters that impact people from all over the world. Ten seniors from the School of Architecture took one to two semesters
off to create and present theses and independent projects on topics of their choice. The work gave visitors eye-opening visual representations of the artists’ responses to their chosen social issues, and offered solutions that incorporate architectural
concepts the students have learned through their studies. The topics of each project helped visitors consider the daily individual and communal challenges people face through the lenses of architecture students. What Do We Know? presented many different ways of thinking about our world, the people, and environments we interact with today.

The Real Gone Music label has just rereleased the out-of-print 1972 cult album Years by Marc Jonson. Real Gone touted the work as one of the most obscure cult albums ever as its initial vinyl release was quite limited. The newly remastered edition was sourced from original tapes dug out of the Vanguard label vaults. Years is difficult to classify by genre, roughly fitting into the category of psych-folk. The album has a transcendental, brooding feel that incorporates the intimacy of the singer-songwriter era with baroque elements prevalent in some 1960s recordings, but ultimately sounds ahead of its time (1972) in a way that looks forward to the alternative music of the 1980s and ‘90s. 
At 21 years old Jonson sang, played guitar, drums, keyboards, produced, and wrote all the songs on Years. The album cover art features a black and white photo of Jonson with long hair, a somber expression, and facial features that resemble Neil Young, who in 1972 released his legendary Harvest album. Years sounds at times like Harvest, particularly the two songs on which Young was accompanied by the London Symphony Orchestra. According to Jonson, there was a classical recording session going on in the studio where he was working so he decided to incorporate some harpsichords that were left lying around and hired some of the classical musicians to play on string arrangements. 
The baroque elements on Years, complemented occasionally by a few good solid drum whacks, bring to mind sounds that an early Elton John explored on works like his 1970 self-titled album. Jonson’s melodic intonations and quasi-classical accompaniment sound at times like an early Leonard Cohen, as do his impressive, often dark, lyrics, which are probably not quite Cohen’s level since nothing really reaches that standard, but are impressive nonetheless. 
Jonson said he was influenced in the making of Years by Van Morrison’s 1968 classic, Astral Weeks. The classical styling and unusual time signatures on both of the albums could certainly be compared, but Morrison is apparently also an influence on Jonson’s vocals. Jonson’s voice is very different from Morrison’s, but Jonson puts his own take on Morrison’s soaring wails. Jonson’s vocal style is similar to that of Chris Bell, a member of Big Star. Years has frequently been compared with the work of Big Star and indeed has the spirit of angst that characterizes much of the power pop genre that the band pioneered. But while the album fits in with the melancholic, reflective side of Big Star, there is not much in the way of the hard rock riffing side of the band captured on songs like “In the Street.”
Years kicks off with “Rainy Dues,” a song that begins with an acoustic guitar riff that is very similar to the riff in the Bruce Springsteen song “Growin’ Up.” Jonson’s release, however, slightly predates Springsteen’s and in the liner notes to Years, Jonson claims he was playing the Gaslight in Greenwich Village with jazz guitar legend Larry Coryell in 1972, and it is very possible that a young Springsteen heard “Rainy Dues” at one of those gigs. The beautifully melancholic piece builds from its acoustic beginning in a dramatic Springsteen-like fashion into its bridge as Jonson’s vocals become increasingly intense right before the mid-tempo rhythm comes in with drums and a few John Entwistle-like audible melodic bass notes. The song ends with Jonson moaning a few transcendent “oohs” before one final anguished scream similar to Springsteen’s vocals at the end of “Jungleland.”
Later in the album, “Mary” provides a showcase for a powerful vocal from Jonson backed initially by nothing but a funky drum beat that Jody Stephens could have laid down for Big Star. Even though Jonson is American, Years often sounds like the dreary British symphonic rock of the era. His voice sounds a lot like Elton John on “Mary,” and the instrumentation and time on the song are highly unusual as harpsichords and string orchestrations make up the bridge before the song closes with Jonson’s high wailing, which sounds similar to John’s higher range. 
“Mother Jane,” a subtle, smart antiwar song features acoustic picking similar to Neil Young’s “Old Man.” However, it seriously diverges from the musical path of “Old Man” when it reaches the middle of the song in which the bridge is signaled by the beautiful strum of harps. The song contains the powerful line, “England’s at war oh my it’s 1805/To print the news you have to risk your life,” possibly in reference to the then current publishing of the Pentagon Papers that showed that the American government covered up the truth about the Vietnam War. 
“A Long Song” features interesting classical accompaniment of flute. The album title comes from a lyric in the song, “Years pass as they grow out.” A bizarre chorus of “bum-bum-bum” sang by a few men or multi-tracked vocals starts as the song winds to a close before the chorus fades and the flute closes it out. 
“The Return To The Relief” features a jingle-jangle, Byrds influenced riff at the beginning. The lyrics are particularly strong, including at a certain point a creepily repeated goblin-like phrasing of “and then kill you,” in reference to what the speaker will do to the people who have destroyed the world if he is the first person born after the world is destroyed. The song is ultimately hopeful, though, preaching love as an alternative. It has a few movements that segue into each other, but ends with an uplifting, sweeping orchestration. “Munich” is an odd song that features a lot of outlandish studio tricks with vocals. The song is particularly eerie because it features what sounds like an abrupt gunshot. The Real Gone reissue features a non-LP bonus track, “I’m Coming Up To Boston,” a beautiful Tim Buckley-like song with a hazy, harmonized chorus that sounds like the alternative music of later decades.
Years is a worthy rerelease from the Real Gone label. Its baroque orchestration references the most sophisticated sounds of the ‘60s in a psych-folk vibe, which was a bit anachronistic to 1972 as a few years are a lifetime in the music industry. By drawing on the best influences of the then recent past and fusing it with the subtly expressive singer-songwriter idiom, Jonson made an album that was years ahead of its time and a classic, cult or otherwise.

In Carnegie Mellon School of Drama’s The Three Musketeers, the classic phrase of the eponymous trio, “All for one and one for all,” takes on a new meaning in the thrilling conclusion to Carnegie Mellon’s theater season. The show was held in the Purnell Center for the Arts from April 13 to 15 and April 25 to 29 at matinee times of 2 p.m. on Saturdays and evening times at 8 p.m. for every day of the production.
Adapted by Associate Professor of Dramaturgy Megan Monaghan Rivas and based on Alexandre Dumas’ famous novel of the same name, The Three Musketeers tells the story of d’Artagnan, a young man who sets out to Paris to join the Musketeers of the Guard. Together with three fellow Musketeers, Athos, Porthos, and Aramis, the four set out on a mission to protect the queen from inner-court intrigue led by Cardinal Richelieu.
The two other plays that I have seen at Carnegie Mellon, Playboy of the Western World and The Rover, never failed to blow me away with the performances of the actors, and The Three Musketeers is no different. What makes The Three Musketeers stand apart from the other two was that every aspect of the production worked flawlessly to create a timeless adventure perfectly adapted to fit the modern times.
Rivas adapts Dumas’ tale by maintaining the novel’s original setting of 17th century France but creating a world where men and women have equal opportunities, maintaining the traditional roles of Queen Anne, Constance, and Milady de Winter but switching the gender of a handful of guards and assassins; Aramis, a Musketeer; Captain Treville of the Musketeers; and Planchet, d’Artagnan’s servant. Rivas makes sure the effect of this adaptation doesn’t go unnoticed, reinventing Planchet’s role as a servant into more of a companion to d’Artagnan, even eventually meshing well with the other Musketeers. Rivas also reinvents other character’s origins, having d’Artagnan’s mother be a skilled swordsman who helped to train her son. She meshes politics splendidly throughout the production through a subplot about the heritage and acceptance of Aramis. The adaptation also emphasized women’s rights, threading the current political climate through additions such as quoting the now famous phrase “Nevertheless, she persisted” that Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell used to defend the Republican Party for silencing Senator Elizabeth Warren during a Senate meeting directly into the play. This offered great commentary throughout the production and added an extra air of refreshment. Overall, the adaptations to the play added an extra layer of meaning to the production, and Rivas perfectly mixed tradition with reinvention to create a memorable experience.
As previously mentioned, all the actors’ performances were phenomenal. Senior acting major Alexandra Miyashiro made Planchet incredibly memorable by imbuing the character with a childlike excitement and penchant to dream, livening up the production not just with her bright costume (which expertly showed the dynamic between her and the other Musketeers) but with her attitude. Senior acting major Siddiq Saunderson, who played d’Artagnan, acted spectacularly as the focal point of the play, helping the audience follow along with the story and becoming a marvelous presence on stage. Senior acting major Victoria Pedretti made her role as the captain of the Musketeers clear to everyone on the stage, commanding a caring yet fearless presence filling the audience with intimidation and awe. I had previously seen senior acting major Andrew Richardson as Willmore in Carnegie Mellon’s production of The Rover earlier this year, and it was amazing to see him perform again on the stage playing a character with completely opposite morals to his previous one. Richardson brought out the emotional complexities and baggage of Athos incredibly well, and commanded the crowd and his companions perfectly within each scene he was present in.
One of the elements that was integral to the show’s success was the incredible choreography from fight choreographer Mike Rossmy. Each fight felt ripped from a gripping action movie, and you could feel the suspense fill every corner of Purnell with each metal clash of swords. The scenes had varying paces and environments, ranging from intense and crowded at a ball, to quick and fun at a training ground, to slow and calculated on a bridge, emphasizing the effect of each scene in the show and making every moment feel important.
Overall The Three Musketeers was flawless across the board, with standout performances and an incredible script and cast. Every little aspect of the production felt meaningful and showed the work, dedication, and underlying message of the cast and everyone involved. It has been two days since I’ve seen the production, and all I want to do is forget about finals and dive back into the spectacularly crafted and exciting world of The Three Musketeers.

“Art is thinking and theorizing manifest; it is a cousin of philosophy and a sibling to science, whose threads have exceeded the body and body politic to confront change through a series of radical proposals that have mapped humankind’s progression from the caves of Lascaux to contemporary
conditions of post-humanism.”
So write Regina and Marlin Miller and Charlie White, the Head of the School of Art, introducing the upcoming 2017 Senior Art Exhibition entitled Roll Call. Its opening reception is on Friday, May 6 from 6 to 8 p.m. at the Miller Gallery and will be on view until May 20. The show features the final work of graduating students with degrees in Bachelor of Fine Arts, Bachelor of Computer Science and Arts, Bachelor of Humanities and Arts, and Bachelor of Science and Arts.
When talking about what to expect from Roll Call, White says art has the power to preserve the present in a way that surpasses necessities of product or definition, allowing for the truth of our generation to exist in a space that is appropriately
formless — in this way, art school demonstrates this great power of art to preserve the idea of “now.” Artists in school have the power of youth to speak to this fact, and Roll Call will be an exhibition that shows the ideas of young people at their height of maturity of work. If there is one show during this school year that I recommend seeing, it is this one.
Passion of work and boldness of idea are core values of the School of Art at Carnegie Mellon, and there is no better place to witness them than in the work of our graduating class of young artists. Art is engaging with the world, exulting in the beautiful and the complex, and being socially and politically engaged. Each one of these artists uses the tools of aesthetics and visual culture to share the way they interact with the world and their visions of the future.
As the diversity of thought and hard work of these students will be on display, we will all be able to see the snapshot of our times and the best of the culture on campus concentrated into the pieces on display. We see the variety of ways Carnegie Mellon has helped give rise to new ideas in the range of work that is being pursued. Bachelor of Fine Arts senior Gerald Warhaftig, for instance, uses humor and digital culture in his illustrations to create spaces of self care and love for queer communities. Elizabeth Agyemang, a senior pursuing a Bachelors of Humanities and Arts in art and professional writing, works with her personal experience as a woman of color to explore storytelling through visual motifs, cultural objects, and historical artifacts. Process-based work, focused on skin and touch through paint, defines senior art major Bridget Quirk’s practice.
These are just a few of the impressive artists who will be on display in Friday’s show. Though we are sad to see them move on from the basement of Doherty and the upper floors of CFA, they leave behind the precedent of insight, humor, and compassion in work that defines the best parts of the Carnegie Mellon School of Art. Graduation is always an uncertain time for artists, but I have no doubt in my mind that these individuals will go on to do great things with their creativity, passionate voices, and care for the world.
Artists: Elizabeth Agyemang, Isabella Antolic-Soban, Anna Azzizy, Clare Burdeshaw, Bonnie (Yan) Chan, Clair Chin, John Choi, Becca Epstein, Madeline Finn, Ethan Gladding, Jarel Grant, Autumn Hill, Miranda Jacoby, Amanda Jolley, Maya Kaisth, Sandra Kang, Nat Kent, Janice Kim, Bronwyn Kuehler, Kira Melville, Rachel Moeller, Natalie Moss, Miles Peyton, Bridget Quirk, Gwen Sadler, Caroline Santilli, Kaitlin Schaer, Christine (Zhuoyang) Shen, Charlotte Stiles, Joni Sullivan, Lauren Valley, Gerald Warhaftig, Nicole Yoon, and Chengcheng Zhao.

The Infra Dance Company, Carnegie Mellon’s advanced contemporary dance troupe, presented their eighth annual show, titled Reverberations, on Saturday, April 29 at 2:00 pm in the CC Blackbox Studio Theatre. The show featured original choreography by Infra dancers, some who were senior veteran choreographers presenting their last dance, some dancers taking their first crack at choreography. The dances flowed over the backing track of smooth electronic music, including such hits as “If You Let Me” by Sinead Harnett and “World Away” by Kasbo. The performance also included an impressive round of improvization as teams of dancers interpreted words shouted out by the audience. Infra treated the audience to a night of stunningly choreographed and executed dance.

Based on a sampling of common grocery and household items, campus convenience store Entropy+ prices are consistently higher than other grocery store options, including Giant Eagle, Target, and Aldi.
The items sampled include: ramen noodle cups and packets, pasta, pasta sauce, ketchup, peanut butter, jelly, two percent milk, cereal, Lunchables, Advil, toilet paper, and sandwich bags.
Entropy+’s prices are an average of 178 percent higher than Giant Eagle’s, 239 percent higher than Target’s, and 514 percent higher than Aldi’s.
As far as grocery items, ramen noodles, pasta, and pasta sauce contributed most significantly to these margins.
At Entropy+, one cup of ramen costs $1.19, and one packet costs 59 cents. Giant Eagle prices those items at 39 cents and 29 cents, respectively, and Target charges 29 cents and 27 cents. Aldi sells ramen cups in a pack of six for $1.55, for a unit price of of 26 cents, and ramen packets in a pack of 12 for $1.94, for a unit price of 16 cents.
Entropy+ sells one-pound boxes of pasta for $2.69 and 24-ounce jars of pasta sauce for $4.49. These are $1.19 and $2.19, respectively, at Giant Eagle, $1.24 and $1.59 at Target, and $1.45 and 99 cents at Aldi.
As for household items, toilet paper and Advil were significant.
At Entropy+, a four-pack of quarter-ply toilet paper with 132 sheets per roll costs $2.79. Giant Eagle charges $1.00 for a four-pack of two- ply toilet paper with 150 sheets per roll. Target charges $3.29 for a four-pack of one- ply toilet paper with 1,000 sheets per roll. Aldi charges 59 cents for a four-pack of two ply toilet paper with 150 sheets per roll.
A bottle of Advil with 24 pills costs $6.29 at Entropy+. However, at Giant Eagle, 24 pills cost $3.99, 20 pills cost $3.99 at Target, and 100 generic pills at Aldi cost $1.99.
According to Director of Dining Services Pascal Petter, “Entropy+ is an on-campus convenience store, where Giant Eagle/Aldi are discount supermarket stores and Target is a discount retailer. CulinArt, who operates Entropy+, neither has the same buying power nor receives the volume discounts like the big supermarket stores/retailers. Truly, both operate according to different business models. This explains the price difference between Carnegie Mellon’s on-campus convenience store and the (national/international) multi-store retailers.”
Petter added that, “when comparing Entropy+ to other on-campus convenience stores, like at Duquesne University and the University of Pittsburgh, prices for common grocery and household products fall in line, or in many cases are cheaper.”
Indeed, Entropy+ products are cheaper in the cases of candy bars like Twix and beverages such as coffee, bottled sodas, and bottled water.
Senior professional writing major Anne-Sophie Kim said, “Entropy+ is the only option when I’m stuck on campus and I’m too busy to take a bus to the grocery store. If I need to pick up groceries or over-the-counter medicines, I have no choice but to spend the extra dollars on it. On a college student’s budget, though, every dollar counts.”

Students from different colleges across Carnegie Mellon have won the top prize in HP and Intel’s Design Challenge: Life in Space. Their design was a wearable exercise system that alleviates symptoms of microgravity, such as muscle atrophy, for astronauts.
The team consisted of biomedical engineering masters students Deepshikha Acharya, Vishaal Dhamotharan, architecture masters student Cecilia Ferrando, and mechanical engineering masters students Kevin Wang and Eugene Yu. The team was helped by Physics Department faculty member, Diane Turnshek.
Eight top engineering schools in the U.S. were given seven weeks to create teams and design a manufacturable product to make life better for astronauts. There were three phases of submission for the competition that included computer-aided design files, design overview content, and videos about the teams and their projects. The team began work on “Muscle Maximus,” the name of their system, in January using the same hardware that the International Space Station and NASA use to assist astronauts in space, the HP ZBook Studio Mobile Workstations.
Muscle Maximus is made up of three parts and uses Velcro to fasten them. It supports knee and elbow joints, shoulders, and the upper back. The joint braces for the elbows and knees provide resistance using a fin that moves through a viscous fluid when the joint is extended. The ball-and-socket at the shoulder introduces resistance through the interaction of micro-patterned rough surface of the socket and the ball. Finally, there are elastic bands along the spine and around the shoulders and waist filled with viscous fluid that offer resistance to the upper back and shoulder blades.
“All of the current exoskeleton systems use electricity, and we didn’t like that,” Yu said in a university press release about the project. Seeking to fill the gap for a mechanical system, the team’s design is self-sustaining and uses mechanical resistance to provide a force of Earth’s gravity.
While astronauts face a lot of adversity in space, the issues caused by microgravity have effects that stay with them after their return to Earth. “Muscle atrophy induced by microgravity is one of the leading health concerns for astronauts in space,” Acharya said. The team hopes to see their design not only implemented onboard the International Space Station but also working here on Earth to help people with health issues that cause muscle atrophy.
The team was not alone in recognizing the need for a mechanical, self-sustaining solution to the problem of muscle atrophy astronauts face. “While Muscle Maximus was regarded as innovative, impactful and a top choice by HP, NASA and Intel judges, the winner was ultimately decided by public voting,” Turnshek said. She also recognized the importance of interdisciplinary work for this project. “The competition win shines a spotlight on our bright, hard-working students and on our caring, connected community.”
“This was a great learning experience, and it feels amazing to win,” Acharya reflected. The prize includes an HP ZBook Studio Mobile Workstation with the Thunderbolt 3 dock for each participant, including Turnshek, a four day trip to Orlando to visit Cape Canaveral and Epcot Center, and $1000.

Earlier this year, Provost Farnam Jahanian announced a three percent increase in undergraduate tuition. This now puts the annual cost of attending Carnegie Mellon, excluding room, board, and other fees, at $52,732, which Business Insider ranks in the top 30 most expensive universities in the country.
Carnegie Mellon tuition has risen nearly every year for the past five years. These rising costs, along with the lack of transparency on behalf of the administration, have called students to question how the funds are being allocated. The Tartan reached out to Provost Jahanian for a response to this.
“We appreciate that the rising costs of higher education represent a significant sacrifice for our students and their families, which is why we make every effort to keep any increase in Carnegie Mellon’s tuition as low as possible,” said Jahanian. “To that end, over the past several years we have observed that [Carnegie Mellon University’s] rate of increases in the full tuition figure has been consistently below those of our peer institutions, typically by about 0.5-1 percentage point each year.”
While perhaps Carnegie Mellon does not raise costs as steeply as fellow universities, students have noticed that their financial aid packages have not increased in proportion to tuition. Students with higher needs also notice that their aid packages cover a smaller percentage of tuition from year to year. Though financial aid is very case-specific, some of the decrease could also be due to expectations for students to work and contribute to their tuition. David Stone, a junior majoring in business administration, observed he “had to take more loans this year than last,” but that decreasing financial aid really comes as “no surprise.”
Countless students are in the same situation, which could contribute to adverse selection at Carnegie Mellon University. As The New York Times states, “some colleges have more students in the top one percent than the bottom 60.” Carnegie Mellon ranks 119 on the list with only seven percent of the student body consisting of the top one percent. An increase in tuition coupled with declining financial aid, however, can result in fewer lower-class students applying to or attending Carnegie Mellon should they feel they cannot afford it.
Provost Jahanian states: “The University remains focused on increasing the amount of money available for financial aid. One of President Suresh’s top priorities has been to provide critical financial support to outstanding undergraduate and graduate students. Since [Fiscal Year 2013], he has dedicated or raised $170 million for presidential fellowships and scholarships, including $60 million in new gifts. In a message to the university community last fall, President Suresh indicated that he expected more than $100 million to be added to the fund.” Despite these advances, Karishma Manglani, a junior majoring in decision science, counters that these scholarships are only targeting “high-performing students and completely ignore the problem that low-income students have a very hard and isolating time here.” Thus, if low-income students have always struggled to perform well or seek appropriate resources in high school, a systematic barrier further dismays them.
Rising tuition has also led the student body to demand more transparency in fund allocation. Transparency has become a recurring theme in most student body elections where students are starting to feel their cost of attendance is perhaps not yielding the necessary returns. Provost Jahanian states, “Tuition also supports the expansion of undergraduate education initiatives, and the improvement of facilities and various services to help students succeed and thrive at [Carnegie Mellon].” Vice President of Finance Angela Blanton says that tuition functions as a form of “fungible income” and contributes to many new developments on campus. For example, the Tepper Quadrangle has received one third of its funding from university funds. 
From an infrastructure perspective, tuition partially subsidizes, in no priority order, a staff and facilities expansion at the Counseling and Psychological Services (CaPS), an increase in the child care facility for further support to faculty, a recommitment of pipeline programs like the Summer Academy for Math and Science, upkeep and renovation of classrooms including the new developments of Tepper Quadrangle, Hamburg Hall, Ansys Hall, and Scott Hall, and the strengthening of the “One CMU” community. As mentioned in President Suresh’s Annual Update, the “One CMU” community includes new makerspaces, athletic facilities, renovation of Sorrells library, and expansion of the Cohon Center.
However, the problem still remains for the student body. Much of the Carnegie Mellon student population is unaware of the allocation breakdown, while others believe tuition is not contributing to the “right” things. One junior argues that on-campus housing is not covered by tuition, which proves a problem especially to the overcrowding of freshman dorms and the necessary renovations for older apartments. Manglani also disapproves of the existing allocation because of the underrepresentation of certain concentrations at Carnegie Mellon. She furthers, “If I’m a Dietrich student, use my money to fund Dietrich. Fund the Humanities, and make [Carnegie Mellon] a leader not only in Arts and Technology, but in the Humanities as well. The focus of this University seems to be on building even more STEM related infrastructure.”
Apprehension also surrounds the administration’s form of communication to the student body. Bharadwaj Ramachandran, a senior majoring in computer science, feels “their manner of conveying,” one email at the same time every year, “has caused a divide between students and the administration. The vagueness of these emails combined with the lack of effective communication as to why the increases happen have made students feel like they have no idea where their dollars are going.”
Many challenges await the Carnegie Mellon administration in the coming years, especially if it decides to hike tuition again. Though there are pressing problems resulting from the rising costs, Ramachandran believes “the administration is willing to listen and is very well-intentioned overall. It’s in our best interests to approach them with clear, rational questions and concerns so that they can work for us.”
Provost Jahanian concludes, “We will continue to invest in key priorities, including financial aid support for students, and to work with students to maintain and enhance a vibrant and engaging [Carnegie Mellon University] experience.”

A team of researchers from various institutions, including some from Carnegie Mellon, working on the Autism Sequencing Consortium (ASC) project has been awarded funding from the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) to continue their work through 2022. The grant totals seven million dollars and will allow ASC to expand their work even further in its search for genetic markers of autism.
Autism is a spectrum of mental disorders ranging from mild forms that have little to no impact on people’s lives to severe forms that prevent patients from communicating properly, getting regular jobs, or going to regular schools.
ASC was established in 2010 in order to collect, share, and analyze genetic markers from autistic patients, with the ultimate goal of finding genetic signatures correlated with autism.
“In our latest project we analyze the entire genomes of 500 autism families. That’s a tremendous amount of data — 3 billion base pairs per genome,” says Kathryn Roeder, a professor of statistics and computational biology at Carnegie Mellon and a principal investigator of the ASC project, in a university press release.
The grant from NIMH will allow ASC to expand the sample a hundred times larger, to over 50,000 families. So far, around 29,000 individual genomes have been sequenced as part of the project, which is the largest autism sequencing study to date.
According to Bernie Devlin, another principal investigator on the project and a professor of psychiatry and genetics at the University of Pittsburgh’s School of Medicine, increasing the sample size is necessary to make important discoveries about autism in the long term. Another professor on the team of collaborators, Joseph D. Buxbaum, who is the G. Harold and Leila Y. Mathers Research Professor of Psychiatry, Neuroscience and Genetics and Genomic Sciences at Mount Sinai, summed up the importance of being able to increase the sample size: “Historically, the number of risk genes found has steadily increased with the number of patients studied, so it’s important that we continue to add patients to the data set.” He described the team as being “thrilled” to receive this grant, which he said would “accelerate” crucial research work.
The research work by the ASC has already produced tangible results on the path to ASC’s ultimate goal of determining genetic associations for autism. It has, among other things, developed statistical tools that identified 65 different genes associated with autism risk and predicted the existence of several hundred more such markers, provided information about the possible genetic makeup of autism, and found that although some rare genetic markers can dramatically heighten the risk for autism, most genetic risks for the disorder are carried in common gene variants.
The awarding of this grant means that these findings may well be the roadmap toward finding a more comprehensive set of genetic data for autism and paving the way toward novel methods for helping autistic patients.

Mac and cheese with no dairy? Pizza with no gluten or wheat? These are some of the recipes that will available next fall to students with dietary restrictions thanks to Nourish, Carnegie Mellon’s new allergen-friendly kitchen, offered by Dining Services.
Nourish’s menu will feature foods prepared without gluten and the eight major allergen-containing ingredients: wheat, dairy, eggs, soy, tree nuts, peanuts, fish, and shellfish.
Students will have several options to acquire these menu items. There will be various grab-and-go offerings at select dining locations including Entropy+, Carnegie Mellon Café, Rothberg’s Roasters II, The Maggie Murph Café, and Heinz Café. Additionally, students can use the GET food app to order food online or from their mobile device. Meals can be picked up from Nourish’s central location on the second floor of the Cohon Center, near Rangos Ballroom.
“As our community of students, faculty, and staff with special dining needs has grown, Dining Services has recognized the need for a space that prepares food without any of the top eight allergen-containing ingredients or gluten,” said Jessica Tones, Dining Service’s registered dietitian and the university’s nutrition educator and marketing coordinator.
According to the Food Allergy Research and Education, 1 in 13 people in the U.S. has a food allergy. According to Pascal Petter, Director of Dining Services, Nourish also hopes to serve students who are intolerant to certain foods or avoid foods like dairy or gluten as a lifestyle choice. Instead of having to navigate Dining Services to maintain their diet, Nourish will allow these students to feel confident and safe in their dining experience while also having delicious options.
Nourish will provide students with a wide range of breakfast items, salads, bento boxes, bowls, sandwiches, and reheatable entrees, as well as a number of vegan offerings. All menu items will have a foundation of fresh, minimally-processed, single-source ingredients such as lean proteins, gluten-free whole grains, and fresh fruits and vegetables.
Breakfast items will include coconut yogurt or chia pudding parfaits topped with fruit and house-made granola, and gluten-free oats uttapam with spicy chutney and raita. Students can also choose other foods including quinoa or brown rice grain bowls, flavorful entrée salads like the Mexicali Chimichurri salad with kale, spinach, cherry tomatoes, corn, black beans, avocado, and creamy chimichurri dressing as vegan option, or topped with cumin chicken.
The menu will also feature comfort foods such as pizza and mac and cheese with crumb toppings.
“Our biggest challenges in designing this menu have been finding products and developing recipes for traditional comfort foods like pizza and mac and cheese,” said Chef Victor Schmidt. “It took quite a few tries to get our pizza crust right!”
Dining Services is still in the process of talking to suppliers and learning how they process their foods and figuring out the right packaging that can reheat meals. They are also doing more research on how to limit cross-contact when a food ravels from the kitchen to the customer.
“Because cross-contact with allergen-containing foods is a risk, sourcing ingredients that are not processed on shared equipment or in shared space is a challenge and has required a lot of research,” said Schmidt.
Overall, whether you are vegan, vegetarian, have celiac disease or are gluten intolerant, are dealing with a food allergy, or just want healthy food options, Nourish will soon be available to provide meal options that appeal to everyone, not just individuals with special dining needs.
Tones encourages anyone with questions about this project, or who would like to discuss specific dietary restrictions, to contact her at jtones@andrew.cmu.edu.

**Professor David Danks of Carnegie Mellon  has been named an Andrew Carnegie Fellow **
David Danks, the L.L. Thurstone Professor of Philosophy and Psychology and head of the Department of Philosophy at Carnegie Mellon, has been named one of the 35 new 2017 Andrew Carnegie Fellows by the Carnegie Corporation of New York.
“The Andrew Carnegie Fellows Program is designed to support scholarship that brings fresh perspectives from the social sciences and humanities to the social, political, and economic problems facing the United States and the world today,” said Vartan Gregorian, president of Carnegie Corporation of New York.
As a fellow, Danks will receive a $200,000 stipend to conduct research. Danks will use this stipend to explore human trust in the age of autonomous technologies.
Danks, a leading expert in the ethics of artificial intelligence, believes that a structure must be established to guide the use, assess the impacts, and develop policies and regulations about autonomous technologies.
“Trust is critical for human flourishing, both in our relationships with others and our use of technologies. But these relations of trust face diverse challenges and opportunities because of the introduction and proliferation of autonomous technologies,” Danks said. “I’m grateful to Carnegie Corporation of New York for their support as we start the work toward providing a systematic conceptual framework and principles for understanding the potential and actual impacts of autonomous systems on this key aspect of our personal, social and political lives.”
**Carnegie Mellon hosts the Pennsylvania Special Olympics for the second year **
On April 29, over 600 Special Olympians competed in the Pennsylvania Special Olympics Western Sectional Spring Games, hosted by Carnegie Mellon University for the second consecutive year. Activities included basketball, track and field, swimming, tennis, and golf.
“It has been so inspiring to see our entire university community embrace the Special Olympic Games as a way to demonstrate our core values of respect and inclusion for people of all abilities,” said Provost Farnam Jahanian.
Tim Spence, one of the competing special athletes and a member of the planning committee, believes that, without Special Olympics, his life would be dull. “When I give speeches, I say that my life would be like a black and white photo without Special Olympics,” Spence said in a university press release. “Special Olympics gives me something to look forward to, goals to work toward and confidence that I will succeed.”
Carnegie Mellon University Police held various fundraisers throughout the year to raise money for the Special Olympics, such as the Polar Plunge, an annual event where members of police departments and organizations take a winter dip into the Ohio River. Jahanian and six university deans also participated in ‘Dunk-A-Dean’ at this year’s Spring Carnival to raise funds for Special Olympics.
“I am particularly proud to have joined forces with CMU Police in the Carnival Dunk Tank again this year to raise money and awareness for this event — it was an honor to get dunked for such a worthy cause!” Jahanian said in the press release.

At the close of every school year, The Tartan reassesses the year’s events. We present here a list of the people and happenings that are worthy of recognition. Thistles go to people and events that had a positive effect on the campus community and the world at large; thorns go to those that have negatively impacted the community.
A thistle to the White House Frontiers Conference for celebrating scientific achievements nationwide and honoring Carnegie Mellon’s tradition of being at the forefront of scientific development, while giving students reasons to brag about President Obama taking over the Cohon Center (CC). The campus felt like something out of a science fiction movie that day, which was right in line with the boundary-pushing research and discoveries that were talked about at the conference.
A thorn to the government’s efforts to defund the National Endowment for the Arts (NEA), overlooking the numerous benefits that artistic experience can give citizens. The NEA offers grants for writers, musicians, theater performers, visual artists, and other creators, and makes sure that all Americans can at some point be touched by artistic expression. Without it, we can only imagine how much creativity in the country will suffer.
A thistle to the Academy for recognizing the cultural importance of Moonlight, a film dealing with the struggles of being a young African-American gay man, despite the initial popularity and attention heaped upon the Hollywood-glorifying La La Land. The brief mix-up had many concerned that the Oscars would once again go with the “safe” choice, but they instead highlighted a message that has the potential to make a meaningful difference.
A thorn to “Hidden Fences”, the nonexistent movie that was brought up again and again on the red carpet, because apparently, if you have more than one African-American-centric film nominated for an Oscar they start to blend together.
A thistle to Adele for acknowledging Lemonade’s cultural importance and Beyonce’s success despite the overwhelming institutional racism of the Grammys and music industry. Both have repeatedly failed to recognize the achievements of people of color, but Adele gracefully drew attention to Beyonce’s accomplishments with the move of an aware ally.
A thorn to the Grammys for failing to acknowledge the importance and relevance of Lemonade. This isn’t the first time that the Grammys have been criticized for racism and prejudice, and more and more people are growing tired of the way the achievements of people of color are overlooked.
A thistle to all of the organizations that brought us the incredibly talented Laverne Cox. Thank you to Activities Board, CMU Allies, Residential Education, the Carnegie Mellon School of Drama, Student Dormitory Council, Student Senate, Division of Student Affairs, and the Graduate Student Assembly. It was an honor for our campus to the be recipient of such a powerful, personable, and inspiring speech by such an accomplished actress.
A thorn to Donald Trump as a person, a concept, and worst of all, a president. He lacks the experience, the qualifications, and the temperament to perform the job with any semblance of authority. Also, a thorn to all of the states that normally lean Democratic, and yet for some reason voted for Trump in the election.
A thistle to those who participated in women’s marches and science marches across the country and the world, showing the government that gender equality and scientific knowledge are not issues that can be ignored. Our president may try to encourage certain views, but we don’t have to share them, and we don’t have to let him risk our futures.
A thorn for Trump’s cabinet, which includes people like Betsy DeVos, Steve Bannon, Scott Pruitt, and others who are laughably unfit for their positions. Unfortunately, despite his promise to “drain the swamp,” the people he brought in to help lead the country were largely donors and party supporters more concerned with their own interests than the vulnerable Americans they are supposed to be serving.
A thistle for Steve Bannon’s removal from the National Security Council. White Supremacists have no place advising the president on the security of the entire country, particularly ones with no experience in foreign policy, and it was a relief that other leaders eventually came around to that sentiment.
A thorn to the Pittsburgh Water and Sewer Authority and the water boil advisory that limited the available water on campus.
A thistle to the CC Expansion, the Tata Consultancy Services, and the Tepper Quad for adding additional spaces for students to pursue higher learning on an already well-sized campus.
A thorn to the ever-popular candidate No Confidence dominating the Student Senate election votes, resulting in mass confusion and a second Student Senate election.
A thistle to Chipotle for filling the universal need for a quick burrito close to campus — and for reminding us just how badly we wish El Gallo de Oro was Chipotle.
A thorn to the Carnival comedian showcase, which was sparsely attended thanks to a subpar time slot and some rather offensive stand-up sets.
A thistle to Carnegie Mellon winning first place in the 77th William Lowell Putnam Competition after placing in the top five for six consecutive years. A special shout out to MCS math majors, junior Joshua Brakensiek and seniors Thomas Swayze and Samuel Zbarsky for being named Putnam Fellows.   
A thorn to the loss of Skibo Cafe and the unparalleled greasy foods which, at 1 a.m. on a Tuesday, are much more satisfying than the fresh ABP sandwich that takes a century to be made.
A thistle to California for finally becoming drought-free after more than five years of struggling to distribute enough water for its inhabitants.
A thorn to California’s reservoirs, which are evidently not equipped to deal with the return of water to the state with the end of the drought.
A thistle to the ski and snowboarding team for their accomplishment in making it to nationals and for becoming a more prominent organization.
A thorn to the the two-factor ID and Duo Push notifications, for having confusing instructions and unclear guidelines, and for making it impossible for anyone who loses their phone to access any school website. There’s something to be said for accounts that are more secure, but there’s also something to be said for student sanity, and that is definitely suffering as a result.
A thistle to the Carnegie Mellon University administration for refusing to enforce Trump’s travel ban, and to the university’s commitment to diversity and global understanding. They stood by the members of our campus community who come from far away to learn, and made it clear that such unconstitutional restrictions are not okay by those trying to make the country a better place.
A thorn to the unfortunately Carnival rain for delaying the opening of booth. At the same time, props to the many dedicated members of numerous organizations who persevered and made the annual event successful in the end, despite the setback.
A thistle to our readers for trusting us to keep them up-to-date about important news on the campus and beyond. Thanks for another great year!

It’s been quite a pleasure writing this column for The Tartan. Over the past several months, I’ve spoken to Democratic party leaders, activists, candidates, students, and voters about their reactions to the 2016 election. Specifically, I’ve tried to ask, how did President Donald Trump happen, and how must the Democratic party change to make sure President Donald Trump never happens again? There are no easy answers, but at such a time as this, it’s imperative that the Democratic Party soberly assesses its shortcomings and reforms itself so that it can win back the American electorate. 
This week, a Washington Post poll made the news for showing that 67 percent of respondents said that the Democratic Party is out of touch. This said more than the Republican Party and Donald Trump are out of touch. This isn’t a policy problem for Democrats. Our policies represent the best interests of Americans, from raising the minimum wage to providing healthcare as a basic right, to preserving our planet for future generations. We’re in touch with those workers left behind by globalization and automation. We’re in touch with the millions of Americans who need a safety net to live freely. We’re in touch with students who want a quality higher education without bankrupting their great-grandchildren. We’re in touch with people of color who want to walk the streets safely and compete in the job market fairly. We’re in touch with women who want to control their own destinies and get paid fairly while they’re doing it. 
But despite our in-touch policies, two-thirds of Americans don’t believe that Democrats really get them. Why have Democrats lost so much over the past eight years? Why did Donald Trump become president? It’s because Democrats have lost credibility as a party that understands the struggles of normal Americans. Our problem is with messaging, branding, and attitude. 
Our message is uninspiring, muddled, and often unclear or downright nonexistent. Say what you will about Donald Trump, but his campaign messaging was lucid, powerful, and memorable. Everyone knew what he wanted to do: build a wall, bring back jobs, drain the swamp. Can you capture a single Hillary Clinton policy proposal in just three words? Trump’s slogan, “Make America Great Again,” communicated a compelling narrative about the decline of America over the past decades and America’s bright future under his administration, in just four words. Short enough to put on a baseball hat, which is exactly what he did. What was Clinton's message? Go ahead, I’ll wait while you try to think up a coherent answer. I bet it won’t be four words long. 
Is Trump a big fat liar? Of course he is. Were his proposals simplistic and foolish? You bet. Does he change his positions more than his underwear? Yup. But everyone understood him, which meant that the people inclined to believe him could be inspired by him. 
Democrats need a double-dose of clarity immediately. Democrats have foolishly, and arrogantly, decided that when they make their policies sound complicated, they’ll sound smart. During the campaign, Democrats loved to talk about the reams of policy statements on Hillary Clinton’s website. They bragged about twelve-page white papers right there on HillaryClinton.com, as if the benchmark for substance is the number of hours it takes me to read about Clinton's tax plan.
This is about branding. Republicans have mastered branding. What are Republicans for? Cutting your taxes. Securing the borders. Fighting terrorists. Freedom. And Democrats? We want the wealthy to pay their fair share, so we can give the middle-class tax deductions and expand the Earned Income Tax Credit for low-income Americans. So what if that’s a way better plan? After reading all of that, which party’s stances are you going to remember, let alone understand?
Even when Democrats try to do branding, they just fall short. Which is clearer: “pro-life” or “pro-choice?” How about “right to work” or “free collective bargaining?” Or “death tax” vs. “estate tax?” 
Why have Republicans won so much in recent years? Why do Americans think the GOP is more in-touch than the Democrats? Because when people understand your policies, they automatically feel like you understand them. 
Perhaps the most infuriating feature of the Democratic Party that I have noticed during my research has been layer upon layer of negligent and arrogant attitudes. We’ll start with the downright derision that Democrats have trained upon vast expanses of the American electorate. Clinton putting half of Trump’s voters into a “basket of deplorables.” Or Clinton promising to “put a lot of coal miners out of work.” Democrats lampooning any Trump supporter as racist, sexist, xenophobic. Democrats sneering at those simple rural folk who “vote against their own self-interest” because they are uneducated and/or blinded by their own ignorance and prejudice. Gee, why would rural voters in Wisconsin, Michigan, and Pennsylvania possibly want to vote against Democrats who speak of them that way? Why would the working class think that Democrats don’t care about them? 
Democrats were also too self-assured on any number of fronts, overlooking their glaring weaknesses and failing to address red flags because of their arrogance. They insisted that demographics would coast them to victory, that there are simply too many nonwhite voters to elect Donald Trump. They thought President Hillary Clinton was simply inevitable, so much so that Clinton’s campaign staffers reportedly considered using “because it’s her turn” as a campaign slogan. As a result, they ignored Clinton’s flaws and warning signs in the campaign. They put all their faith into a hyper-targeted data strategy, abandoning retail politics and aggressive campaigning. They thought they could simply attack Donald Trump, without putting forward a vision of what they stood for themselves.
But worst of all, too many Democrats refuse to acknowledge that they even have a problem. They blame this whole fiasco of an election on James Comey and Russian interference. They offer Clinton’s popular vote victory as evidence that they’re on strong footing — as if the popular vote counts for anything. They posit that voters refused to support Clinton because of sexism, rather than anything wrong with her candidacy or campaign. They claim that elections are “cyclical,” that the incumbent party almost always loses open presidential elections. 
Surely, these were all real factors. But Democrats can’t control these things. All they can do is take responsibility for what they can control, and demand of themselves that they do better next time. 
Democrats need a clear, cohesive, and simple message. They need to brand themselves in ways that people can understand so that people begin to feel like Democrats understand them. And they need a serious attitude adjustment. They need to stop deriding working-class and rural white voters, and they need to find a way to resist Trump without demonizing, attacking, and accusing all Trump supporters. They can’t underestimate Trump in the 2020 election or allow themselves to be overrun by the complacent, stale feeling of inevitability. And they need to humble themselves, so they can point out their shortcomings and learn from them. 
The stakes are too high for us to allow the Democratic Party to continue failing. When the world needed Democrats to keep Donald Trump out of the White House, we failed, and the whole world became less safe as a result. Now, Americans face an uncertain future, in which looms cuts to their healthcare and education, attacks on their civil liberties, the constant threat of war, and the unaddressed challenge of climate change. That’s on Democrats for letting it happen. 
But I’ll leave you with this. Decisions are made by those who show up. If you’re unhappy with the Democratic Party like I am, the solution is to engage, not to give up. If you want to see the Democratic Party reform itself to once again be the party of the people, it’s up to you to get involved and drive that reform forward. It’s up to us to put pressure on Democrats to change. And it’s up to us to get behind Democrats in 2017, 2018, and beyond so we can do everything in our power to stymie Donald Trump’s dangerous, irresponsible, and destructive agenda. Thank you for reading, and I’ll see you in the trenches.

It’s hard to describe the last few weeks of senior year. You’re still a student, drowning in the final projects and tests that stand between you and graduation. Your "senioritis" makes it harder to do any schoolwork. All the effort required (and even your final grade) seems inconsequential compared to the flashing headlights of “THE FUTURE” coming up quick in your rear window. Your family is definitely showing up for graduation on the twentieth of May. Hotels have been booked and restaurants have been reserved. But in order to have a graduation at all, you probably have to pass at least one of your current classes. So you beat down the senioritis and push through your homework, knowing all the while that this may be your last finals week ever. 
It’s hard to describe the last few weeks of senior year without the word “bittersweet.” Don’t get me wrong — I’ll be thrilled to say goodbye to the endless cycle of deadline stress and work that always follows you home. I won’t miss Craig Street cuisine four times a week, mandatory classes that don’t interest me, biannual moving ordeals into and out of housing, or awkward campus encounters with people I’ve got history with. 
And like many fellow seniors, I’m looking forward to what’s coming next. Most of my friends are eagerly anticipating moving to exciting new cities and starting exciting new jobs or graduate schools. Even to people like me, who haven’t yet settled all their post-grad plans, this is definitely — to use the cliché —  the start of a new chapter. I haven’t read that chapter yet, but the mystery and potential of it is thrilling. It’s invigorating like confronting the void is invigorating. I guess by “invigorating” I also mean to say “terrifying.” The last few weeks of senior year are terrifying, and no one’s really talking about it yet. 
I feel that, to some degree, we’ve all internalized the idea that college is the “best time of your life.” That stupid little mind worm is everywhere, from movies about college superstars whose dreams never panned out, to the wistful sigh of your late-twenties career counselor who “remembers those days,” to your grandma’s joke that “it’s all downhill from here.” 
As someone who can say college has been the best time of my life so far, I understand the sentiment behind this idea. College is where I grew into my identity. Here, I discovered a passion for politics and filmmaking. Here, I produced my proudest intellectual and creative work. Here, I had my “bisexual awakening.” College is where I met most of my dearest friends in the world, where I took advantage of opportunities my high school self never imagined, and where — the legend holds true — I had so much f***ing fun. 
But no matter how much you’ve enjoyed college, even if it’s been the best time of your life yet, hearing that you’re running out of the best days of your life ever is… well, it sucks. It sucks, firstly, because you can’t slow down or rewind time. College will end regardless of how much you want to hold on to it. It sucks, secondly, because it paints a pretty bleak picture of the remaining 50 plus years of our lives. Does our culture really have such a low opinion of life that it insists everyone peaks before you get married, have kids, or even start your career? It sucks, overall, because it encourages people to give up on a fulfilling adult life before they’ve truly begun it. 
The idea that college is the best time of your life not only sucks, but is also incorrect. Studies have shown that although average life satisfaction peaks first at 23, it more or less plateaus through your thirties and then peaks again in your late 60s through early 70s. Business Insider additionally cites peak “happiness with your body” at 74 and peak “psychological well-being” at 82. Middle age may suck a little more, but that’s also when you’re most likely to win a Nobel Prize, earn your highest salary, understand people’s emotions, and — surprise, surprise — rock at arithmetic. Evidently then, we college seniors have plenty of life to look forward to. 
These statistics are a comforting balm to the sting of the “best time of your life” myth, but they don’t fully relieve the “bitter” in “bittersweet.” What people haven’t been talking about yet is the difficulty of leaving the more-or-less good life that you know for a potentially good life that’s still a mystery. Even the most optimistic senior in the world is about to let go of most of the positive fixtures of their college life. 
Gone are the student organizations that gave you community, the lectures and events that broadened your mind, the professors who inspired and encouraged you, the first place of your own that really felt like home. Gone is your support network of simple, easy friendships. Your friends are all moving to different cities, and you suspect that friendship will never be so easy again. It’s a lot to lose, when you really let yourself think about it. 
I’m not sure I have any grand conclusions for this, my very last of many Tartan articles. Again, the last few weeks of senior year are difficult to describe because it’s difficult to experience. The sheer weight and variety of emotions involved — simplified by the umbrella “bittersweet” — can be so overwhelming that it’s easier to just talk about the hassle of moving out or plans to party during Senior Week. But I think it’s crucial that we seniors take a moment to address the bittersweet head-on. The sweet: we’re heading toward the best years of our lives. The bitter: this is goodbye.

The measles, like the milkman and record players, have become synonymous with the childhoods of our grandparents, relics of the past that have become obsolete. Thanks to the MMR vaccine, given in the United States to children as young as 12 months, measles has been essentially stamped out from our population, along with other diseases such as the chicken pox, mumps, rubella, polio, and more. Vaccines like MMR have prevented people across the world from contracting potentially life-threatening illnesses, eradicating some diseases almost completely.
It can be easy to think of diseases like the measles as extinct and non-threatening, since we are so rarely exposed to them. We forget, then, that these diseases are not just gone thanks to some medical miracle. They are gone because we have vaccinated and have continued to vaccinate our children, and if we are not vigilant in regards to vaccinations, those diseases can return very easily.
This is exactly the case in Romania, where a measles outbreak has infected over 3,400 people in the past year and killed at least 17. Between 2007 and 2013, Romania’s MMR vaccination rates dropped from 97 percent to 88 percent, falling far below the 95 percent vaccination threshold recommended to interrupt disease transmission. A majority of the cases were found in infants under 12 months old, too young to get the vaccine, or in children from one to four years old, too young to get the recommended second dosage of the vaccine. 
In Romania, the anti-vaccination movement is strong and growing stronger. Romanian celebrities such as Olivia Steer, a former TV presenter, and various religious groups have claimed that vaccines like MMR can cause autism and asthma, scaring parents and spreading misinformation. They advocate for parents’ choice in vaccinating and making the best health decisions for their children, and unfortunately, they are gaining supporters. 
In anti-vaccine rhetoric, it sounds like their ideas are valid. Parents should be able to make choices that are best for their children, and to force vaccines upon them is to take away their medical liberties. Parents, however, are often not medical experts or scientists, and therefore are often not qualified to make complex healthcare decisions for their children. 
The arguments used by the anti-vaccination movement are also not grounded in scientific fact. One of the largest arguments, that vaccines are linked to and cause autism, is based on a now-retracted British study from 1998. Andrew Wakefield, who led the study, was stripped of his medical license in 2011 after it was discovered that he had misrepresented or altered the medical histories of all 12 patients involved in the study. The American Academy of Pediatrics has also released a list of more than 40 studies that find no link between vaccines and autism. 
Furthermore, when a parent decides not to vaccinate their child, their child is not the only person affected by that decision. If a child is not vaccinated for the measles, that child runs the risk of both contracting the disease and spreading the disease. Every unvaccinated child decreases the population’s herd immunity, the resistance to the spread of a contagious disease within a population resulting from a high proportion of immune individuals. Herd immunity protects those who are unable to receive vaccinations, either because they are younger than 12 months, have allergies to ingredients in the vaccines, or face other medical issues. 
So what can you possibly say to a parent of an infant too young for the MMR vaccine who was exposed to the measles by an unvaccinated child and dies as a result? Do you point them to pseudo scientific studies about autism? Do you talk to them about medical liberties and the democratic risk that we take when we force people to get vaccinated? Do you tell them that the parents of that unvaccinated child made a decision for their child that they thought was best? 
We have the ability to leave diseases like the measles in the past. We have the ability to protect our children from contracting potentially life-threatening illnesses and to protect people who are unable to protect themselves with vaccines. But we must be consistently vigilant and remember that these diseases only stay dead if we continue to vaccinate. We only need to look at Romania to see that diseases like the measles can rear their heads again if we continue to believe the anti-vaccination rhetoric.

From the start of his 2016 Election campaign, President Donald J. Trump made big promises to his voter-base to eliminate the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), which he referred to as “the worst trade deal maybe ever signed anywhere.” Why then, as he planned to sign an executive order to withdraw from this agreement, did he change his stance and decide to bring it up for renegotiation? Perhaps his change of heart is the result of realizing just how much his voter-base could be damaged by the elimination of such an agreement.
NAFTA is an agreement between Canada, Mexico, and the United States that reduces or eliminates most tariffs between these three countries and has been in effect for over 20 years. As the world’s largest free trade agreement, it has boosted trade and resulted in more affordable products and significant economic benefits. Since its enactment, trade between the countries in this agreement has quadrupled from $297 billion to $1.14 trillion according to the United States Census. 
Critics of NAFTA attribute job loss to this significant increase in trade between Mexico and the United States. They aren’t completely wrong. According to the Economic Policy Institute, as of 2010, the trade deficit with Mexico can be attributed to a loss of 682,000 American jobs. However, the story is not this simple. According to The Balance, American manufacturers created 800,000 jobs in the first five years of NAFTA alone. While some factory positions have been moved directly to Mexico, the fact that American companies can now specialize processes between Canada, Mexico, and the United States has incentivized them to keep production in North America, which will create more jobs than moving to Asia and boost the economies of all three nations involved.
While we imported $294.7 billion worth of goods from Mexico in 2015, critics of NAFTA fail to realize positive effects that the agreement has had on American auto and agricultural companies. According to the United States Census, America exported $236 billion in goods to Mexico in 2015. According to The Balance, economists have attributed exports to Canada and Mexico to up to 0.5 percent increase in GDP growth per year. This has resulted in agricultural exports to Canada and Mexico increasing 156 percent and a significant increase in service exports.
According to author Gary Clyde Hufbauer, “8500 manufacturing jobs are supported by every $1 billion of US exports.” Based on this figure, it is estimated that the increase in export of U.S. goods from NAFTA has resulted in over 100,000 new jobs. Therefore, while some jobs have been displaced by NAFTA, arguing that it has been detrimental to U.S. employment is not looking at the big picture and failing to take into account improvements in the economy as a result of both cheaper goods and a boost in U.S. exports.
By creating cheaper products, free trade improves the lives of those that critics of NAFTA argue are affected most by it. This is because it results in significantly cheaper clothing and other goods. Because they spend a significantly higher proportion of income on clothing, lower income families are affected most by tariffs and other measures of protectionism. According to a 2015 study by Pablo Fajgelbaum and Amit K. Khandelwal, if we completely shut off trade, the average real income loss for the top 10 percent would only be four percent, but it would be an astounding 69 percent for those at the bottom 10 percent. NAFTA and other trade agreements are the reason that stores like Walmart can offer impressively cheap clothing and products to those who need them the most.
While it can result in the displacement of jobs in some regards, there are some significant benefits to the North American Free Trade Agreement, and eliminating it would have more negative effects on the lives of Americans than positive effects. Ironically, by providing cheaper products and keeping it economically feasible for American companies to manufacture in North America, NAFTA has been overall beneficial to the population segment that President Trump argued had been most affected. Perhaps this is why he chose to open his eyes and realize that such an agreement between Canada, Mexico, and the United States is not only beneficial but necessary to ensure the maximum well-being of his voter-base and the nation as a whole.

Prior to the 2016 presidential election, then-presidential candidate Donald Trump released the "Donald Trump’s Contract with the American Voter." By doing so, he announced his "100-day action plan to Make America Great Again" for the first days in office. He packed his first 100 days to the brim with controversial plans that would, as proud Trump supporter Tomi Lahren stated, "shake up Washington." On January 20, 2017, Trump was sworn into office, and the first hundred days began.
Although the majority of voters who cast their ballots for Trump do not regret their vote, Trump's presidency had a 44 percent approval rating, making it the first time in the history of modern polling in the U.S. when the majority of U.S. citizens did not approve of their president at such an early juncture. These statistics have come to life on the streets through events such as the Women's March, A Day Without Immigrants, and the March for Science. Even Trump himself seems to be at least somewhat unhappy with his presidency. In a recent interview with Reuters, he stated that he expected being president would "be easier" than his old life and in fact misses his "old life." Of course, Trump is not the first president to express nostalgia, but it seems rather unusual that he shares this sentiment so soon after becoming president.
Regardless of expectations, it is important to not delve too far into the pathos of Trump's presidency and remain conscientious of both the ethos and logos. With Trump having just passed the hundred day mark on April 30, 2017, it is time to reflect back on his contract and evaluate how well he has kept his promises and trust with the American people.
He had three main objectives for his first days in office. The first was to drain the swamp in D.C. By doing so, he hoped to restore the public's trust in the government and bring change to Washington. However, the extent to which D.C. continues to be swamped is debatable. With such controversial picks such as Betsy DeVos as Secretary of Education, Scott Pruitt as Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, and Ben Carson as Secretary of Housing and Urban Development, Trump has definitely hosted a radically different environment from the one under the Obama administration. Despite the credentials that many of Trump's picks lack, perhaps he felt that their connections to key special interests would compensate for their shortcomings.
The next goal was to take measures in protecting American workers. Trump saw, and currently sees, trade as a potential threat to America, hence his announcing a plan to renegotiate or withdraw from the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) and withdraw from the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP). He denounced the TPP as a step towards the "continuing rape of our country." Furthermore, he wanted to direct the Secretary of the Treasury to label China a currency manipulator. Trump did withdraw from the TPP via executive order. However, he backed out of withdrawing from NAFTA; Trump's team was divided, and President of Mexico Enrique Peña Nieto, as well as Prime Minister of Canada Justin Trudeau, greatly discouraged him from doing so. Just as Trump's opinion on NAFTA shifted significantly, so did his stance on China. Trump no longer publicly denounces China as a currency manipulator. Rather, he is trying to create a stronger relationship with China in order to potentially gain help from China in confronting North Korea, which he sees as a top threat.
The final task to accomplish was to restore law and order, just as he promised in the presidential debates held prior to the election. This involved stringent regulations for immigration and the implementation of what he and his administration described as "extreme vetting." Although he was not implementing these policies unopposed, he has been somewhat successful in keeping his promises. His controversial temporary travel ban barred people arriving from seven dominantly-Muslim countries from entering America, and as a consequence, an undetermined number of U.S. residents were left unable to return to the country after traveling. However, the endeavors of Trump and his administration do not stop there — there are still strides being made to deport illegal immigrants regardless of the lack of criminal records, and more plans to enforce the immigration ban that could even cause the First Lady to be deported. Of course, law and order would not be complete without his firm plans on building the wall, which has remained constant throughout the campaign trail and his presidency despite the billions of dollars that would be involved in a wall that may be ineffective against immigration across the southern border.
