Men’s Track and Field
The Carnegie Mellon men’s track and field team headed to the Dave Labor Invitational at Slippery Rock University on April 1. Due to inclement weather, only a few Tartans were able to compete.
In the 1,500-meter run, sophomore Colin McLaughlin finished third while senior Elijah Sech finished fifth with times of 4:00.96 and 4:01.94, respectively. Sophomore Cody Breidenbach placed second in the hammer throw with a mark of 53.06 meters while senior Bailey O’Malley placed fifth with a mark of 47.84. In pole vault, first-year Harrison Hayward took second after clearing the bar at 4.21 meters. 
Members of the team will next be competing at the Susquehanna Multi on April 6 and April 7 and the Westminster Invitational on April 7 and April 8.
Women’s Track and Field
Members of the Carnegie Mellon women’s track and field team headed to Slippery Rock University this past weekend to compete in the Dave Labor Invitational. Due to inclement weather, only a few Tartans competed.
In the 100-meter hurdles, senior Liz Barre claimed first with a personal-best time of 14.44. Barre also took second in the high jump, clearing the bar at 1.60 meters. In the 1,500-meter run, graduate student Kristen Seballos crossed the line third with a time of 4:53.73. In the hammer throw, senior Ola Owodunni took fifth with a mark of 39.48 meters. 
Members of the team will next be competing at the Susquehanna Multi on April 6 and April 7 and the Westminster Invitational on April 7 and April 8.
Softball
Earlier this week, the Carnegie Mellon softball team headed to Hiram College for a doubleheader on Tuesday, March 28. 
In the first game, Hiram was able to take an early lead, scoring seven in the bottom of the first. Attempting to close the gap at the top of the second, senior Piper Johnson hit a single and junior Erika Heffernen followed with a double. A ground out from first-year Kira Monji brought Johnson home while junior Kiera Boucher singled to score Heffernen. At the end of the top of the second, two Tartans would be left on base. Hiram would go on to score two more — one in the third and another in the fourth. At the end of the game, the board read 2-9 in favor of Hiram.
In the second game, Hiram once again pulled ahead early thanks to single runs in the first and second innings. In the top of the fourth, first-year Koko Sagae singled and was scored in thanks to a double from sophomore Faith Lawrence, making it 2-1. Hiram retaliated with another run in the fifth, putting them ahead 3-1. Not letting them pull far ahead again, first-year Kya Benneman brought two Tartans home in the sixth thanks to a single. However, Hiram would bring one more home in the bottom of the seventh, giving the Tartans another loss. 
Moving past these losses, the Tartans hosted New York University this weekend for a two-day, four-game series.
After a scoreless first two innings in the first game, the Tartans were the first on the board thanks to a variety of Tartan efforts. Heffernen led off with a single, sophomore Libby Eichberger followed with her own, and Monji hit another that brought Heffernen home. Boucher hit a double, bringing two more Tartans home. Sagae finished up with a single, printing Boucher home. The Tartans weren’t satisfied with a four-point lead; they scored two more and loaded the bases in the sixth inning before a lightning delay suspended play. After resuming play, Eichberger scored senior Piper Johnson with a single and Minji brought senior Emily Finger home with another single. In the seventh, NYU would score one, but the Tartans ultimately closed the game, winning 7-1.
Like the first game, the second game against NYU remained scoreless until the third inning; this time, NYU was the first to strike, earning one. However, the Tartans would bring three home during the fifth. Eicherberger led with a single, and Monji followed with an in-field home run, scoring two. Brenneman later brought sophomore Abbey Reese home for their third run of the inning. No more runs were scored in the game, giving the Tartans their second win of the day over NYU.
Women’s Tennis
On April 1, the 11th-ranked Carnegie Mellon women’s tennis team hosted the 30th-ranked University of Mary Washington. 
In the first double spot, the team of junior Danna Taylor and sophomore Crystal Zhou claimed a point for the Tartans, winning 8-4. In the second doubles spot, first-years Manuela Van Cottem and Divya Venkatarama claimed another point for the Tartans, 8-4. The third-spot team of sophomore Zoe Angell and first-year Anna Chow earned the last doubles point for the Tartans, 8-3. 
Similarly, Tartans swept in singles. Sophomore Sarah Yang claimed victory over her opponent, winning 6-4, 6-3. Taylor played second spot and also went out in two, 6-2, 7-5. In the third spot, Zhou earned another Tartan point, winning 7-5, 6-4. Van Cottem won in the fourth spot over three sets, 6-3, 4-6, 6-0. In the fifth and sixth spots, Venkatarama and first-year Anika Joshi, respectively, both won their matches 8-3. 
This 9-0 victory has advanced the team to 15-3 on the season. Their next match will be on Saturday, April 8 when they travel to Cleveland to take on the 12th-ranked Case Western Reserve University.

Friends, welcome back to another Pittsburgh Pirates season.
Let’s first deal with the elephant in the room. The Pirates suck, and they have sucked for a long time. In each of the past two years, they lost a hundred games; they haven’t finished outside of the bottom two in their division since 2016, they haven’t made the playoffs since 2015, and they boast four — just four — winning seasons since 1992. This is a city of champions. The Steelers are one of most storied franchises in the National Football League, and no team has won more Lombardi Trophies; the Penguins have not missed the Stanley Cup Playoffs since 2006, winning three Stanley Cups in that time. Yet in this city of champions, a town that thrives on sports, an exception is made for the Pirates. They are allowed to be our lovable losers. We don’t expect much from our Bucs, and for the most part, they don’t deliver — a structure backed up by dirt-cheap tickets for fairweather fans to enjoy a summer afternoon at the park, and an owner unwavering in his belief that every dollar spent on improving his baseball team could be better spent on improving his hair.
But do you remember, dear reader — do you remember when the Pirates were good? The answer is probably not, and there is no shame in answering “no,” for I too would answer no if not for the circumstances of my childhood. I was a middle-school boy in central Pennsylvania, at the very periphery of Pirates country, but culturally Appalachian enough that all but the odd sports fan bled black and gold. To fairweather fans like us, the Pirates’ 2013 run to the NLDS, and the playoff seasons in 2014 and 2015, came out of nowhere. Andrew McCutchen was in the prime of his career, Pedro Alvarez and Starling Marte were providing juice from the batter’s box, and veteran Francisco Liriano and wunderkind Gerrit Cole were letting it fly from the mound. I was too young to stay up and watch the Bucs play night games on TV, and we didn’t have cable anyway, but every morning I would bounce out of bed, log on to my dad’s old Lenovo Thinkpad, and check the score from the day before, and take note of how we were faring in the standings, both in the division and the wild-card. Those three years were electric to me, a solitary boy more than a hundred miles from PNC Park. What it was like here, I can’t even imagine.
But then the run ended, just as abruptly as it started. In 2016, the Pirates sucked again, and the Penguins won the Stanley Cup; as a fickle child with fickle loyalties, a greater and greater share of my sports brain was filled with hockey, and baseball fell by the wayside. They were the lovable losers, and I’d check in on how they were doing once in a while, but seeing loss after loss pile up from afar, for six years in a row, gradually stopped hurting. As I got into high school, I had bigger worries. Learning how to solve integrals, how to drive a car, how to talk to girls, how to wear a mask, how to apply to college.
But then, after coming to college, something funny happened. That was the year I fell back in love with baseball, even if it was with the warped Bucco version of baseball, a game in which you trade your good players for prospects, and then just as they blossom into ballplayers in their own rights, trade them for more prospects. I cheered Daniel Vogelbach, Mitch Keller, Oneil Cruz, Jack Suwinski, Cal Mitchell, Tyler Heineman, and the rest of the band of upstarts and misfits as they staggered their way to a 62-100 record.
My hope with this column — which will be weekly during the overlap of our school year and the baseball season — is that if you, too, are in love with baseball, I can provide you with a fellow sufferer, someone who will rejoice with you in every win and feign surprise at every two-hitter blowout loss. But more than that, if you don’t love baseball yet — and I know that many of you who have never, by choice, sat through a ballgame will look skeptically at the word “yet” — I hope to slowly, over the course a hundred and sixty two games of Pirates baseball, change your mind. I hope you fall in love with the rhythmic melody that is the baseball season, with the smell of freshly cut grass and overpriced ballpark hot dogs, and with the team that will jog out onto the field, seen only by the truest of the Pirate faithful, to prove that they’re more than just the lovable losers from the City of Champions.
And if they don’t suck  — if they actually cobble together a decent season — then won’t it be beautiful to behold it together?
Game 1
I have to admit that, even as an esteemed baseball columnist, I did not watch the game. I watched bits and pieces of it, but my priority was cramming for my 6:30 machine learning midterm. How did the midterm go, you ask? Let’s talk about baseball.
Pirates’ manager Derek Shelton chose Mitch Keller (5-12, 3.91 ERA in 2022) as his Opening Day starter, and Keller responded in true Pirates fashion, which was by imploding. In the bottom of the first, a single, a walk, and another single loaded the bases for Cincinnati, but Keller got out of it, allowing only one run, when catcher Tyler Stephenson grounded into a double play. He kept things together until the fourth, when he gave up a long home run to Spencer Steer, and then it all fell apart in the fifth. A walk, a single, and a long triple later, suddenly the number next to “CIN” on the board was a four, and Shelton came out of the dugout to relieve Keller. Final statline: six hits, four runs (all earned), and ten baserunners, all in less than five innings of work.
But the Pirates stayed on the board, although the bats were all but silent. In the top of the third, Oneil Cruz, the young, huge, fast, but painfully inconsistent shortstop who many expect to have a breakout season, launched a Hunter Greene fastball into the stands. In the fourth, with one out, the bases loaded, and having chased Greene from the ballgame, the Pirates scored in the most Pirates way imaginable. Bryan Reynolds and Andrew McCutchen walked, driving in two runs and taking a 3-1 lead. Then Cruz (Cincinnati) uncorked a pitch into the dirt, getting away from Stephenson, and Cruz (Pittsburgh), who was by then on third, scored before Stephenson could even collect the ball. The Pirates had one hit in the fourth inning, and were walked four times. If the only way this team can get on base and score is when the other team shoots themselves in the foot, we might be in for a long, long year.
But never mind that, because the Pirates bullpen took it from there and methodically shut down the Reds the rest of the way. Dauri Moreta, Rob Zastryzny, Colin Holderman, and David Bednar allowed no runs and only two baserunners, one of the better Pirates bullpen outings we’ve seen in a long time. Pittsburgh added only one run — a fly ball from Cruz allowing the wily Ji-hwan Bae to score — but it was enough. Pittsburgh 5, Cincinnati 4. Final.
This win was more of a relief than anything else. Keller was awful, the bats were okay, the bullpen was lights-out. But I can’t complain. The Pirates won, my ML exam is over, and we’ve got another ballgame teed up for Saturday. And I do believe that, in the NL Central, these hapless Buccos own a share of first place.

Aaron Rodgers' decision on his future has been one of the most talked-about topics in the NFL in recent months. Rodgers, who is considered one of the best quarterbacks in the league, winning four league MVP’s, has been with the Green Bay Packers for his entire career. His potential departure from Green Bay has been rumored since the 2020 NFL draft, after the Packers selected quarterback Jordan Love.
Since the end of the 2023 season, Rodgers' decision on whether he will stay in Green Bay, request a trade, or retire a Packer has been highly anticipated. Rodgers had shared that he was going to enter a four-day darkness retreat at the end of February, which was believed to be the precursor to his public decision. After his retreat, weeks passed with no news, and rumors were circulating the NFL world. Many fans, sports analysts, and television personalities became upset with Rodgers and saw his delayed decision as unnecessary and attention seeking. 
On March 15, Rodgers appeared on "The Pat McAfee Show" and revealed to the world that he wants to continue his football career, and his intention is to play for the New York Jets. Many believed that the Packers and Jets had already reached an agreement on trade compensation for Rodgers, and were simply waiting for him to announce his decision. But two weeks have passed since his appearance on "The Pat McAfee Show," and no trade has been made. 
So, what is causing the hold-up in Aaron Rodgers' potential trade?
In recent memory, it is hard to recall any situations regarding a trade that have been similar to this one. Rodgers had been rumored to the Jets since the Super Bowl and now trade talks persist weeks past the NFL Combine. Earlier this week, analyst Mike Garafolo reported that the Packers and the Jets are "far apart" on trade compensation for Rodgers. He stated that the trade will not take place before NFL league meetings starting on March 26, which was previously thought. When’s the next deadline? The NFL Draft. The Green Bay Packers ideally want to finish the trade before this year’s draft, in order to receive compensation for this year. They need to build around Jordan Love and transition into a new offense after losing Aaron Rodgers and wide receiver Allen Lazard. If the Packers can’t make a trade by the draft, they would be putting the team in a poor position for next season.
Joe Douglas, the Jets general manager, is known to value draft picks over players, and not be willing to give up much in trades. On the other hand, the Packers seem to want high draft pick compensation for their top tier quarterback. It is probable that Joe Douglas is reluctant to give up this year’s 13th overall pick, which the Packers have their eyes set on. Recently, on March 27, Charles Robinson reported that the Packers and Jets are now discussing two high draft picks for Rodgers but are in disagreement over the 2024 draft protections. These picks include a second round pick in both the 2023 and 2024 NFL Draft. The Jets are looking for protection on 2024 draft picks if Aaron Rodgers does not play past the 2023 season. They are unwilling to give up so much for a one year stunt with Rodgers. Robinson also reported there is talk of the Packers giving 2025 draft compensation to the Jets if Rodgers retires or based on the Jets performance in the 2023 season. 
Despite the hold-up in negotiations, it seems extremely likely that a trade will eventually be made. Both Rodgers and the Packers have a lot to gain from a fresh start. The Packers would rebuild around a younger quarterback in Jordan Love, and the Jets would become a Super Bowl contender with Rodgers at the helm.

So far, the Pittsburgh Penguins have gone up against three teams this week. Let’s check in on them, shall we?
On Tuesday, March 28, Pittsburgh traveled to Michigan to face off against the Detroit Red Wings. Despite putting up a good fight (and playing suspiciously close to the one year anniversary of absolutely demolishing Detroit 11-2), our beloved flightless birds were simply overwhelmed by the Wings, and they fell 7-4. 
On Thursday, March 30, the Pens returned to PPG Paints Arena to go up against the Nashville Predators. In a truly shocking turn of events which thawed the layer of ice beginning to encase my heart, Tristan Jarry got his second shutout of the season, and the Penguins pulled out a much needed Peng-win, 2-0. 
On Saturday, April 1, the Penguins went up against the high and mighty Bruins at home. In a quite ridiculous game which often saw Pittsburgh fans yelling “Shoot the puck” at the screen, the Pens were down, then tied, then down, then tied, and then down, then tied, then down once more. Before their soon to be ex-fans were able to shout loud enough to be heard on the ice, time ran out and the Penguins were once again defeated by the Bruins, 4-3. 
With only six games left in the season, the Penguins have once again fallen out of the wildcard slot. Florida is currently one point ahead. While it’s absolutely doable for the Penguins to get back in the game, there is a very real possibility that Sidney Crosby could miss the playoffs this year for the first time since his rookie season. In my opinion, the Pens really only need to try one new trick to have a shot: Have they considered actually playing well?

Pedro Pascal. Man, myth, great name for your turtle. He is your daddy when you need him to be. Your father when your friends are eaten by fungi. A fun guy all around. I mean, what can’t this guy do?
This is the question Hollywood asked itself every day, until they saw the TikTok girlies. Thirsting over this man, throats like a desert. Screaming his name as loud as they needed to, sugar. Then, they knew what had to be done. Like DiCaprio, except it’s cool if he dates me, 19. Hollywood realized this, accepting that they could not survive without, possibly, the one good man left: Pedro Pascal.
Why is he so perfect? Well for one, he’s unbearably sexy. I mean, the way he rocks that Beskar? Makes you want to put the pedal to the metal, know what I’m sayin sayin'? Not to mention the way he walks? Sheeeeesh. One leg after the other. Breathes with two lungs. Who else is doing that in Hollywood?
The icing on the cake: He cares. About you. He watches the TikToks, he said it himself. He knows how important he is to the sexual and romantic imaginations of girls, gays, and theys alike. He even makes straight men question their own sexuality. His bromance with Nick Cage? Come on. Who doesn’t want to watch "Paddington 2" with this guy?
He also, like, had a daughter in "The Last of Us." So he’s actually a daddy. Yeah, she’s not really his daughter, but daddy’s a state of mind, know what I’m sayin'? The way he rocked that gun? Cocked, locked, and loaded. And he laughs at puns — dad jokes? He’s in.
Then there’s the cowboy aesthetic. We’ve all seen the video. He looks far too fine in that hat. And the whip? Come on. He’s got a six pack of cold ones on ice and his roomie’s out all night. There’s no mar-telling what’ll happen next.
Hollywood is set to replace several male leads in upcoming movies with Pedro Pascal. One such film is "Fast X," where the notorious Dom Toretto will be played by the main man Pedro. You know he’s all about family. He is also slated to take up the role of John Wick, in the fourth installment of the series. That cold killer instinct from "The Last of Us?" Gets the people going. Moreover, he is rumored to play Harold of "Harold and the Purple Crayon." I mean, have you seen that man in purple? Enough said. Marvel even issued a statement saying they would be "open to recasting Thanos, perhaps in phase seven." Plans are already in the works to replace Paul Rudd’s face with Pedro’s, in the recent "Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania," in order to boost viewership and ratings.
Oberyn the music side of things, "Daisy Jones & The Six" have requested that Pedro Pascal join them on tour, in order to lessen the average toxicity on stage. Billy Dunne could probably use some daddy tips. Again, it’s a state of mind.
Pedro has even rocked the math world. Many have begun coining a new sex position, “pascal’s triangle,” (we’ll spare you the details) far eclipsing the French mathematician’s creation. 
He’s been under a lot of pressure to maintain this level of influence. After all, superiority over all other men is no easy task. But Hollywood believes Pedro’s up for the job. And we all know that Hollywood has the best opinions. I mean, wasn’t Jamie Lee Curtis great in that one movie?

This question has baffled smart and dumb thinkers alike since Plutarch. Before anything else, I must make one point clear. If you claim that the egg came first because amniotic eggs formed millions of years before chickens existed, or whatever the hell, you are SUCH A LOSER. What could possibly be so wrong in your Koala brain? We are obviously talking about the Chicken Egg, we have obviously always been talking about the Chicken Egg. Like many similar conundrums, this spirited debate over the answer has become dominated in recent times by STEMlords that refuse to do any thinking for themselves — “Umm actually, I’d take all six people off the train tracks” and the like. The enlightened STEMlord will of course claim that the egg came first, and that Saint Evolution evolved proto-chickens that would create a chicken egg from which a chicken hatched. This is all fine and good, except it really isn’t. Not only is this solution anti-choice, it also attempts to sidestep the real purpose of the question, in much the same way the most annoying friends of friends try to cheat on Would You Rather questions. "What is an egg? A miserable little pile of cells."
The platonic essence of “chicken-ness” is formed through the lived experience of each and every chicken. Thus, a chick may be a “chicken,” but it is not a baby chicken. This “chicken-ness” is becomed through the animal that will grow to form into a chicken, before itself laying an egg, or perhaps being eaten. Thus, we can see that the chicken grows first, and only that chicken will be able to lay an egg. This egg then does not hatch into a chicken. Thus there is only an illusion of an unbroken loop from egg to chicken to egg or chicken to egg to chicken. It is a series of parallel in construction lineages of chicken to egg, and egg that does not unlikely itself form a chicken. 
It is actually pretty simple if you pay attention.

This is a real-ass PSA for all of you goddamn food-ordering midwits. Don’t think I don’t see you, you slobbering freshmen, cursed to overpay for housing on campus while Pittsburgh rent is so cheap. Or you wretched, friendless upperclassmen. Nobody wanted to actually live with you, so you had to slink back to Morewood Gardens, or Resnik, or so on, or so forth, cursed with roommates you hate, and RAs that treat you like babies. 
I know you all think of yourselves as soooo phisticated. There are wonderful workers at the various Chartwells establishments (Nicole, Steven, etc…) that want nothing more than to feed your tired, your poor, your huddled masses yearning to breathe free. And you horrific dorm denizens scorn our oh-so-essential food service workers, instead opting to focus your patronage on a sector of work much less essential, food delivery. Because you love the new serfdom, don’t you? You Uber back and forth, ride your shitty little subscription-based scooters, and you Doordash. Evil that you are, you Doordash. Or maybe you Seamless, Grubhub, MunchPod, Trapeater, Uber Eats, or any other company fascistically turned into a verb. Because in America even words become slaves to the ever-expanding omega-companies, much as the serf gig-workers become YOUR temporary slaves every time you order from some quaint local restaurant (or Dominos) and pay $18.43 (+ tip) for the privilege of not having to step outside.
When you order your silly little food, and put it down in your silly little dorm, you doom your deliveryman to an eternity of wandering around Morewood Gardens, because nobody knows where you are, how near or how far you are from where your food-guzzling app placed a hypothetical address. My evening ritual of walking loops around campus is constantly interrupted by well-intentioned portion providers desperate to find a location provided by the dumbest college students this side of the Mississippi River. Normal people do not find it difficult to provide or follow simple instructions. How privileged, lazy, stupid, loafing, slothful, and indolent can you be to not even bother showing up in person to take the food from the underpaid, overworked prole that bothered to bring you your refried dim sum?!
I have been too kind for too long. From now on, whenever you are walking around campus, understand that I will be watching you. I will call you silly names. I will kick your food. I will be casting negative spells directly at you. For your own sake, you better not be caught lacking.

Hello viewers, and welcome to WatchMojo. Today, we’re counting down our top five poxviruses. From camelpox to variola minor, all of these poxes will leave spots on your heart. 
Orthopoxvirus Cowpox virus
Cowpox is a certified hood classic, and the OG vaccine. Milk maids may not have been huge cowpox appreciators back in the day, but they likely would’ve liked smallpox even worse. This one also got a little saucy recently by cosplaying as a vial of smallpox and rolling about the CDC. Oh, cowpox, you prankster you!
Orthopoxvirus Monkeypox virus - Mpox
This one has been really popular in recent history. The cool kid of the group, monkeypox has recently gone from nerdy loser to big time star, and even got a cool nickname to match its newfound popularity. Plus, it spreads through ~intimate contact~. How romantic.
Orthopoxvirus Vaccinia virus
Vaccinia, my most dearly beloved. Despite your fading into obscurity, I still yearn for you. Our love is a forbidden one — you’re the one that I want, but can never have. If only you didn’t present the risk of a horrifying case of EV, we could be together forever. Alas, you’ll always be the one that got away. 
Entomopoxvirinae
Ok, this one is technically a whole subfamily of poxviruses, but it’s weird and wacky because it infects bugs! Isn’t that silly? Haha, caterpillarpox :) Mothpox! LOL!
Honorable Mentions:
Chickenpox: Funnily enough, this one actually isn’t a poxvirus, as well known as it is.
Largepox: “Smallpox? What about Largepox?” Oh my god, you’re so funny! Yeah, I’ve never heard that one before, that’s so original! How did you come up with that? You’re hilarious!
Molluscipoxvirus Molluscum contagiosum virus: This one is weird because it’s pretty exclusive to humans, but mollusks are like… snails and stuff. But no one will tell me why it’s named after snails. Why is the CDC keeping these secrets? I want answers!

When you hear the word “recall,” I assume your first thought is concerning a manufacturer informing individuals to bring their automobiles into the shop to remedy a safety defect. For me, that was the case until August 2021. As a Southern California native, August 2021 was the start of a very important process called a gubernatorial recall election. There were complaints about having the highest taxes in the United States, the highest homelessness rates, and according to some, the lowest quality of life.  These frustrations coincided with the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, which exacerbated existing problems. At this point, seven total recall petitions had been launched against Governor Gavin Newsom (D). On Feb. 20, 2020, the petition which led to the 2021 recall election was served against Governor Newsom. In short, Governor Newsom won and is still the Governor of California.
This may seem a bit odd to bring up a year-and-a-half later, but we, in the city of Pittsburgh, are faced with a similar dilemma. The incumbent Mayor of Pittsburgh, Ed Gainey, has seen his relationship with the people of Pittsburgh grow sour. Since assuming office, Mayor Gainey has failed to effectively salt the roads to protect drivers against the snow. After one winter, the local yinzers had grown tired of Gainey’s use of salt with abnormally high alkalinity levels. Then, during football season, in a misguided attempt to endear himself to the city’s rabid sports fans, Gainey tried to color the city’s three rivers black and yellow like Chicago does when it dyes its river green on St. Patrick’s Day. The result was the black of the Allegheny River mixed with the yellow of the Monongahela River to turn the Ohio River into a dreary shade of gray not seen since the steel mills polluted the rivers 60 years ago. But the straw that broke the camel’s back was a Jan. 30, 2023 tweet from Mayor Gainey’s Twitter handle (@gainey_ed): “Congratulations @Eagles — Pennsylvania is headed to the Super Bowl #FlyEaglesFly.”
That seems like something Governor Josh Shapiro (hometown: Philadelphia) would tweet, not the mayor of a different city within the state — especially one with a long-held rivalry. Gainey used to be in the Pennsylvania House of Representatives, but he allegedly grew up in Pittsburgh and is the mayor of Pittsburgh, a fact that was frequently highlighted in responses to his tweet and referenced rather vociferously on many occasions. A tweet seemingly so innocuous yet also so concerning. As someone living in this great city, can I trust that Gainey is actually from Pittsburgh? Does Gainey really like French Fries on his sandwiches, or does he prefer cheese whiz on them? Is his real name even Ed Gainey?
This tweet ended up prompting a successful recall petition. Since then, a young, up-and-coming Republican candidate has come out of nowhere to take this fair city by storm.  Meet Jorge Santoso — the 34-year-old, mega-successful businessman. Santoso, a Pittsburgh native, attended Taylor Allderdice High School, furthered his education at the University of Pittsburgh for his bachelor’s degree, and received an MBA from Carnegie Mellon’s Tepper School of Business in 2013. Santoso has since started his own capital introduction consulting firm, Santoso Organization.  At its peak, Santoso Organization managed $800 million in assets.  The firm was based in Pittsburgh but registered in Florida to avoid the aggressive Pennsylvania taxes forced upon everyday people by the avaricious, gluttonous Democrats.  n January 2023, Jorge Santoso dissolved Santoso Organization to prioritize challenging Mayor Gainey in the recall election to save Pittsburgh.
It is no secret why I am voting Santoso in the election. There is something about über-successful, honest businessmen that translates into great politicians. There was one that won office in 2016 at the federal level, but his name is escaping me. Maybe you can figure that one out.
Outside of his professional success, Santoso is an appealing candidate because of how well-rounded and accomplished he is in almost every way imaginable.
Some highlights:
When Santoso began his freshman year at Taylor Allderdice High School, it was actually known as General Robert E. Lee High School. Yes, Robert E. Lee, as in the Confederate general who led the South’s attempt at secession during the Civil War. But Santoso knew that keeping a name like that and celebrating a man who fought for hatred was problematic, so he held protests and got the school to change the name.  unny enough, Santoso overlapped with Pittsburgh rapper Wiz Khalifa at Taylor Allderdice High School. Santoso encouraged Wiz Khalifa to start getting into music.  Being the multi-talented guy he is, Santoso wrote the classic Pittsburgh anthem “Black and Yellow” for Mr. Khalifa.  The song became a major hit and launched Wiz Khalifa into rap superstardom.
Santoso is Jewish. I know this one may not resonate with everyone, but Santoso’s Jewish heritage in the political spectrum is a big deal for Jewish people like me.
Santoso formed a non-profit that specialized in financial elder protection.  The non-profit was responsible for saving hundreds of thousands of seniors from falling victim to credit card and check fraud—heroic.
Now that I have covered his successful business and impressive side quests, I have yet to mention his football days. Back as an undergrad at Pitt, Santoso was actually a star wideout alongside the legendary Larry Fitzgerald.  At Pitt, they were arguably the greatest college receiving combo ever.
But Santoso knew his calling was bigger than playing football.  His eyes were set on serving the people of Pittsburgh. This guy would never allow the venerable Heinz name to be replaced at the Steelers gridiron by some internet insurance firm from Grand Rapids, Michigan! In Santoso, I know I am getting an overachieving, principled man that is fit to serve the people of Pittsburgh — his people. For that reason, I am voting to recall Ed Gainey and elect Jorge Santoso to lead Pittsburgh.

Daygame in Sorrells Library
Often, women will make known their availability by wearing large headphones and not looking at you. This is called "playing hard to get," and the only appropriate response is to play hard. You must cold approach these women by asking them their name, followed by a comment about what they're studying. Even better if you can do this to someone at a table facing a wall — these people are sure to be most receptive to your advances. 
Give an unusual name at La Prima
This highly advanced tactic is woefully underutilized in the pickup artist community, but it is well-documented that if you give an unusual name at a coffee shop, it will intrigue nearby women. Names I often use include Magistrate, Nomad, Harbinger, and Corporal.
"Where's my hug?"
This is a certified rizz classic, and can be employed with a female prospect of any level of closeness. Not only does it break the contact barrier and establish physical intimacy, but it can be employed with increasing frequency for the purposes of kino escalation. The beta might say, "Can I get a hug?" The elite pickup artist, however, will use this exact phrasing to frame the hug as something expected, not a mere request. 
Discuss the blockchain 
It is widely known that women can't resist the shrewd entrepreneurial mindset of crypto enthusiasts. Coupled with the financial status of such ruthless businessmen, it is no wonder that bitcoin boys get the ladies. Find a willing wingman, and have a loud conversation in a high-traffic area about your recent breakthroughs in decentralized trading algorithms. The entrance of Gates is particularly good for this.
Read The Tartan
Reading the news section signals to women that you are well-read and informed on the events of your university, and reading Pillbox signals that you are cultured and have a sophisticated sense of humor. I have tried this first-hand, and can assure you that reading the newspaper in public consistently garners attention from 8.5s and above.

This Friday, many queer people across the United States celebrated Trans Day of Visibility by gathering in large groups to promote the Gay Agenda. For one local man, though, Friday was something more — Oliver Christianson decided to come out as transgender to his closest friends and family. Unfortunately, his gender reveal party didn’t go quite as planned. Throughout the day, along with the overwhelming outpouring of love and support, Oliver felt something else stirring inside him. No, not in his heart — in his bowels. You see, it is a commonly known fact that girls don’t poop, they simply absorb everything using their superior stomach juices and sheer force of will. Once your pronouns change from she/her, you lose this ability. Foods that Oliver was once able to eat happily with no consequences were now working their way through his previously unused intestines. 
“It was the strangest thing,” Oliver said. “One minute I was happily enjoying my iced coffee, and the next I felt this unholy rumbling in my gut.” For someone who had never experienced the coffee shits before, this was quite unsettling. “Somehow I figured out what was going on and managed to make it to the bathroom in time, but it was a really close call.” Party attendees say they heard a “thunderous commotion” and “sounds of great distress.” Oliver went on to say that he had heard about the effects of coffee before, but previously believed that they were a myth. When asked how she felt about the situation, Oliver’s mother said that she was “so so happy that he’s able to be his true self,” but misses “the days before that ungodly stench.” Oliver, who has also gained the ability to open pickle jars and lost the ability to find the clit, has since been diagnosed with a dairy intolerance and started ordering his daily iced coffee with oat milk.

Carnegie Mellon, like any STEM school, deals with frequent accusations of supporting a "school to DOD pipeline" — implying, of course, that the main purpose of the world-class education we receive is solely to prepare us for jobs in the military or arms manufacturers. In an attempt to dispel these accusations and improve the university's branding, the Carnegie Mellon Board of Trustees decided to do away with the "pipeline" implication and allow the military to operate an air base directly on campus.
"Most of these kids are gonna get jobs in industry or the military after they graduate, so we thought it would be great to give them a head-start with the hands-on experience they'll need in a career supporting the sprawling international arms industry," says Major-General Brett Hawthorne, USAF. 
The plan is a joint effort between all branches of the military and will involve converting a large portion of the CFA lawn, the Cut, and the Mall into tarmac to allow aircraft to land directly on campus. The Fence will be removed and relocated to the top of Flagstaff Hill where all previous rules for painting still apply. Furthermore, most of Wean Hall will be converted by the U.S. Air Force into a remote piloting station for Unoccupied Aerial Vehicles, where any student who presents a valid Carnegie Mellon ID may watch the real-time operation of an MQ-9 Reaper drone.

I recently had an exam, which was held in a football stadium that was also Wean. It was not only a complete surprise to me and my classmates, but I was also not wearing any pants and my teeth kept coming loose! Even worse, I was wearing a diaper in the middle of class even though I stopped wetting the bed when I was… well that isn't important, what matters is I don't anymore. 
To be completely honest, the whole situation would have been reasonable if it weren't for the fact that the exam questions were organized by color, and that the text changed depending on which eye was reading it. I was lucky enough to be sitting right next to my younger brother who doesn't exist, but he was too busy writing his résumé for high school to be helpful.
Leaving the exam, you'd think the misfortune would end, but no! I went out to the mall where I saw my friends from class selling German pastries and mittens from a trench in front of Hamerschlag, but as soon as my friend said "the weather is so nice right now," a massive thundercloud came rolling in and lightning started striking all the buildings around us! It was so bad that my friend Tyler from high school had to come all the way from his lake house to tell me I had to leave college and get a job with him in England.
Listen, all I'm asking is that professors are a little more courteous to their students. We have many classes to deal with, and it's just an unnecessary source of stress and anxiety to take these surprise exams, especially when they always seem to be for classes we already took and passed freshman year.

Last Thursday, the Carnegie Mellon Board of Trustees approved the construction of a new building thanks to a $50 million grant from notable alumnus Jerebis Brickerdon. Brickerdon (ECE, '98), made his name working for Amazon or Raytheon or something. You think I care to find out? Give me a break.
Dubbed "Brickerdon Hall," the 110,000 square-foot facility will, when completed, be located at the intersection of Forbes and Margaret Morrison Avenue. It will feature an underground parking facility and a bunch of useless stupid nonsense you'll never use, like another Nanofab lab and an aerospace materials testing facility. Fucking whoopee I guess, right? It'll also have some makerspaces I bet, although honestly I can't act like I fully read the proposal. The pictures show that it'll have tables and trees and whatnot out front, and also a "state-of-the-art cloud-based BME lab," whatever that means. 
I mean, got damn, how many more of these do we need? The STEM kids already have so many buildings. I mean Doherty, Hamerschlag and Wean makes sense, those are the OGs right? And sure, let the CS kids have Gates for themselves, and I guess Scott hall has that nice coffee place. But ANSYS? Does anything actually happen in ANSYS? And now they're building something new past ANSYS called Scaife? Who asks for these? And don't get me started on TCS Hall. I hear so little about TCS. That site would be more beneficial to the community if it was a fucking Burger King, yet here we are continuing to extend the borders of our campus like some insatiable amoeba. I mean, these humanities kids only get Baker-Porter, which is literally one building that we pretend is two to make them feel better. When are we gonna build something for them? I just truly don't see why we need to drop a bag and a half on some shiny new STEM labs when we haven't even renovated half the residence halls in decades. 
I'm sorry, but if you wanna find out about this new building you'll have to do the research yourself because I literally can't be bothered. It looks like they're gonna demolish a couple houses at the corner of Maggie Mo and Forbes. There will be construction on Forbes Ave for approximately twenty-five years.

Waking up is spiraling; spiraling down towards a day which ought to never go the way I had foreseen. The worldly burdens placed upon me are brutally angled and curveless. My chronic trials quickly and forcefully push me to a destination I shan’t be ready to meet. In an everyday path so cruel and misunderstanding, my only solace is found in the gentle caress of my one and only, Her, the Gates Center Spiral.
I find her in the darkness of dim night; I find her in the early suns of terrifying dawn; I even find myself neglecting my midday biddings and gravitating towards her amidst the comings and goings of those around us. Her curves possess me in a way I could never speak forth by the failings of a mortal tongue; my devotion is the deepest entrenchment spanning across endless continents. Maybe if I loved her any less, the jealousy of the common man who may also grace her path anytime and on a whim would break my heart in two. But, her beauty calls me to subdue my endless rage and her every wish is to me all but a vehement command. 
I vow to be there for her. I vow to put her first. I vow to not take the far more convenient and hasteful normal staircases. Forever and always, she is seen <3.

There is no better-known phrase at Carnegie Mellon than “My Heart is in the Work.” The incessant merchandising is enough to make even the most doomer of CS workaholics convince themselves that this is what they actually want to be doing with their lives. We here at The Natrat are living nothing short of the dream in UC 314, so we know this statement rings true to us. But does the 120-year old slogan still resonate with the campus community at-large? We set out to investigate.
Out of the students we surveyed (n = 3), 97 percent said that they don’t relate to the slogan anymore — that it’s just too dated. Others disagree, saying that it’s part of the campus culture. The Natrat asked those who don’t like “My Heart is in the Work” to come up with a new one that represents the University.
“Hmm… how about ‘My Heart is in the Werk,’” sophomore Andrea Somers said. “It’s fun and quirky and it’s definitely something that little rascal Andrew Carnegie would have said. I think it really captures how on top of everything this school is.” The Natrat sent a team of elite archivists to scour decades of correspondence from Carnegie himself to verify the historical veracity of such a slogan change. In a previously undiscovered 1891 telegram, Carnegie is observed to use the term while writing to Henry Frick about the use of armed strikebreakers against the steel "werk"-ers of Homestead. Purr, Andrew!
“‘My Heart is in the Work’ encapsulates everything I dislike about this school,” senior Josh Pinkington said to the Natrat. “How about ‘Raising Tuition, Lowering Expectation?’ It’s funny because they keep raising our tuition every year yet I somehow still have to teach myself differential equations from a textbook I pirated from libgen.” While the Natrat acknowledges that tuition has been continually on the rise and disavows the use of shadow libraries like libgen.rs, we kindly ask that anybody seeking to levy such criticism consider how else Carnegie Mellon is supposed to afford their next $500 million building.
“I’ve been thinking about this for a while,” first-year Sandra Westington said. “When I first heard ‘My Heart is in the Work,’ something about it didn’t feel right. Unknowingly having to stand in the heart of the ‘My Heart is in the Work’ formation during orientation just intensified that feeling. So I propose we change our slogan to ‘YMCA.’ It’s easy to say, form with a bunch of first-years, and you can put it on a t-shirt.” The Natrat considered this, but to avoid the catching the ire of the YMCA's notoriously litigious legal department we strongly advise against such a change. 
But as the campus community is no longer satisfied with our slogan, what comes next? The Natrat urges campus leadership to hire another administrator to look into the issue, form a committee, produce a paper, and have no further change to address this problem.

Look, we've all been there. You are chatting up some fine dame or dude, and the subject of your major comes up. Often, it is the first subject, because Carnegie Mellon college students are poor conversationalists. You could just tell Patrick your major, but then he'd think less of you! A spark of inspiration, eureka! All you need to do is lie, and claim a different major as your own! But you cannot just select one willy-nilly. If your chosen major doesn't mesh with your vibes, your trickery will be quickly uncovered, and seppuku will be required. Hopefully, this here article can solve this problem.
Computer Science Major:
Okay, if you are in the CMU School of Computer Science, congratulations. You are obviously a genius, and will be paid oodles of cash once you graduate. Your peers will recognize that Carnegie Mellon is the Harvard of tech and cover you with adulation. In the meanwhile, you are seen by many as an unwashed nerd, too busy with coding your silly little assignments to make human contact. Really, you can be a bit terrifying. When you have these vibes, it can be difficult to determine another major to co-opt, but claiming an Information Systems major seems like a good fit. Still techy, but the Dietrich bend makes you appear more cultured.
Theater Major:
Everyone has figured you out the second you walk into the room. We can't help you.
Mechanical Engineering:
Look, you care about neither the Mechanical, nor the Engineering. You just looked at the Carnegie Mellon Job Opportunities widget, and saw that MechE had the highest average salary. You just want to get a position as a systems engineer at Raytheon as soon as you graduate so you can utilize the Navier-Stokes Equations for Laminar Boundary Flow to develop missiles that more effectively pierce the sides of school buses. You are the beast of CIT. You are the beauty of the military recruiters stationed in Wean. Brother, your khakis and polo shirt are glowing. At least ChemEs and CivEs have some semblance of passion in their education. Just lie and say you have an additional major in BME to trick people into thinking you care about the advancement of human life. 
Undecided:
Undecided students walk with the nervous gait of a bird with vertigo. Hunching your diminutive frames even farther inward, you are the mockery of campus. And your low self esteem and persecution complex makes you even more mockable. Look, we don't like you. Why would you go to college if you don't even know your major. Couldn't get enough of school? Are you going to be a baby your whole life? Grow up. Maybe you could pass as a Mathematical Sciences major. 
Physics Major:
You've got nothing to worry about. You are on the top of the totem pole. Hiding your major would be like double-bagging a super model, except even more silly. Physics is cool, physics is sexy. Even a man looking like Albert Einstein could get hoes, all because of his physics major. Stand tall, stand proud.

Childbirth is incredibly complicated biological mechanism. Most of us take for granted how safe it is nowadays compared to the days of yesteryear, when mothers had no access to antibiotics and children were somehow always dying between the ages of zero and five. Modern medicine provides us not only with more knowledge about birthing, but also, like, painkillers. We can monitor vital signs and take ultrasounds and it all feels so comforting. The reality, though, is that many mothers and babies still die before, during, and after labor for a variety of reasons. 
I would like to start generally: this issue has the potential to impact anyone. Mistakes and complications happen all the time, and some fatalities are due to genetics or missed signs. However, women of color are statistically more likely to die during childbirth in the U.S. And Pittsburgh has one of the highest death rates for women of color in the country. 
In 2019, the City of Pittsburgh’s Gender Equity Commission released a report entitled “Pittsburgh’s Inequality Across Gender and Race” which included a number of birth statistics for women of color in Pittsburgh. Here are a few:
So what accounts for these deaths? A report from 2022 on maternal deaths in Pennsylvania noted drug-related accidental poisoning and obstetric complications as leading causes. Pennsylvania has certainly not avoided the effects of the opioid epidemic, with our next-door neighbor Ohio leading the nation in opioid-related fatalities. Communities of color and low-income communities have been disproportionately impacted by addiction, which certainly takes a toll on the body. 
In fact, there are a number of systemic problems that can detract from the health of a pregnancy. Lack of access to food, mental health care, and prenatal care all lurk in the background of the medical terminology typically used when talking about childbirth. Many complications can be avoided with prior knowledge and care, which may be absent if a patient has less ability to see a doctor prior to giving birth.
However, there are some risk factors that can be foreseen. For example, an enormous number of birthing complications fall under the cardiovascular umbrella: preeclampsia (restriction of blood delivery to the placenta), hemorrhage (the rupture of a blood vessel), and cardiomyopathy (a form of heart failure) are all results of hypertension or high stress on the heart. You better bet giving birth to a child puts high stress on the heart. What might make that stress more likely to lead to a fatality, though, is diabetes. Diabetes raises the blood pressure by increasing blood sugar, and is much more commonly seen in black patients for a variety of biological reasons. 
This is something that a doctor could reasonably check for, as are other pitfalls like sepsis, issues with anesthesia, or a variety of embolisms (the entrance of blood in the lungs or matter from the fetus into the bloodstream). So why are these fatalities still so prevalent, especially in Pittsburgh, the home of Magee Women’s Hospital?
A lot of attention has recently been brought to medical bias and the role of the patient in identifying problems in a medical context. There are certainly things to be said about racism in medicine and medical education. Also, though, I believe we have reached the point in medicine and technology where patients can take more control over their care, especially when they feel they may be at risk for bias. After nearly dying from a birth-related pulmonary embolism, Serena Williams spoke out about standing up for yourself to your doctors, something that saved her life. Her story is a great example of the birthing experiences of Black women and the dangers they face. For the many who did not survive their complications, though, justice has yet to be brought — and the medical community has a long way to go to make birthing safe for all.
Addendum to last week’s “Period apps: tracking you or your period?” from social technologist and Carnegie Mellon Human-Computer Interaction Institute Ph.D. student Kimi Wenzel:
“The focus on period tracking apps has been sensationalized by the media. While I don't want to minimize concerns about privacy and period tracking apps, because they are legitimate, it's important to remember that (1) the menstrual data is not robust evidence, especially compared to the other types of information typically used in a prosecution and (2) the surveillance of pregnant individuals is simply not new. This surveillance, however, typically centers on women of color from low-income communities, which frankly is a group that many tech writers ignore.”

As companies continue to integrate AI into their workflow, some are questioning if it is being rolled out too fast. On Wednesday, an open letter asks for a pause on “Giant AI Experiments” for at least six months. The letter asks the readers what we should and shouldn’t let AI do. Their questions include: “Should we let machines flood our information channels with propaganda and untruth?” and “Should we develop nonhuman minds that might eventually outnumber, outsmart, obsolete and replace us?” 
A number of noteworthy signatures are included in the letter, including tech billionaire Elon Musk and Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak. The open letter calls for a six-month pause on AI development so that developers can consider the risks associated with AI. It notes that “this pause should be public and verifiable, and include all key actors.” It asks that if this pause cannot be enacted quickly, governments should step in. 
As their entrance into the realm of using artificial intelligence, Adobe has launched Adobe Firefly. Firefly is “a family of creative generative AI models” that will eventually be integrated into Adobe applications like Adobe Express, Photoshop, and Illustrator. Firefly has not yet been integrated into these apps, but can be accessed through a public beta on the Firefly website. 
There are currently two main functions to Firefly: text to image and text effects. Text to image is similar to other visual AI projects out there, like DALL-E. The user inputs some detailed prompt and the AI will return a generated image that “matches” the prompt. Users will be able to select what kind of styles they want via tags, such as lighting and composition. 
Text effects allows the user to input some text and a description, and the AI will generate the user’s text in the style of their description. For instance, the user can input “Fish” as their text and “rainbow fish scales” as their description, and it will produce the text “Fish” covered in rainbow fish scales. Users will be able to choose their base font, background color, and a few other options.
A number of features are planned to be added to Firefly as well. “Recolor Vectors” is listed as “Coming Soon.” A number of techniques are listed as “In exploration”: Using a brush to replace objects with a text prompt-generated fill, generated images based on the user’s own object or style, using text to make a vector, extending images, generating images from 3D objects, making patterns from a detailed text description, generating a brush from a text description, making a sketch into an image, and turning text into a graphic design template.
Notably, Firefly is designed “to be safe for commercial use.” To “learn” how to produce this content based on a text prompt, AI needs to be given training photos. There have been intellectual property concerns over some of the training sets used for AI-art generators, as many artists had not given permission for their works to be included in them. Firefly is trained on Adobe Stock images and openly licensed and public domain content that has expired copyright. Adobe is currently working on a compensation model for Stock contributors as well.
In an effort to increase user personalization, Spotify has rolled out an AI DJ into user’s pockets. Though currently in beta, DJ generates a continuous stream of music and commentary for the user. It sorts through the user’s current and old listening habits to provide a unique experience to the user. As the user uses it more, DJ will update itself to better reflect their taste. 
DJ is a combination of three technologies. The first is through Spotify’s personalization technology, which generates playlists for the user (like Daily Mixes and Discover Weekly) based on their listening preferences. The second is the use of OpenAI. According to Spotify, “With this generative AI tooling, our editors are able to scale their innate knowledge in ways never before possible.” 
The last technology is the use of dynamic AI voice to create DJ’s interactions with the user. In June 2022, Spotify had announced they were acquiring Sonantic, an AI voice platform that “creates compelling, nuanced, and stunningly realistic voices from text.” They are utilizing this technology to create DJ’s voice, which is based on the voice of Spotify’s Head of Cultural Partnerships Xavier “X” Jernigan. 
Users can find DJ on their mobile app. If users are not happy with DJ’s selections, they can “hit the DJ button at the bottom right of the screen to be taken to a different genre, artist, or mood.”

As of writing this article, over 2,800 people have signed an open letter asking to pause training powerful AI systems, including big tech founders such as Elon Musk and Steve Wozniak, as well as many AI experts such as Yoshua Bengio, who won a Turing award for deep learning research. Specifically, the letter, titled "Pause Giant AI Experiments," calls for "all AI labs to immediately pause for at least 6 months the training of AI systems more powerful than GPT-4."
The letter is written by "Future of Life Institute," an organization founded in 2014 that is principally interested in reducing the risk of artificial intelligence (AI). The letter proposes that as AI research is paused, AI researchers should develop a shared protocol for ensuring the safety of AI algorithms and technology, and also work with governments to develop robust AI regulations.
This comes after an AI craze that can be largely attributed to the release of ChatGPT, whose language model (now GPT-4) was later acquired by Microsoft and is being used to fuel a search-engine war between Microsoft and Google. As a result, tech companies are training even more powerful large-language models in order to beat their competitors. The open letter posits that as AI labs continue to train massive models, they are beginning to become human-competitive at general tasks, or in other words, perform basic tasks that we'd expect humans to be able to execute. 
While AI experts agree that such AI is risky, there are still many points in the letter that are disputed. For one, many believe that a six-month moratorium is simply not enough. Decision theorist Eliezer Yudkowsky explains that AI alignment researchers have worked for decades to find a way to ensure AI safety, and it is highly unlikely that what has stumped them for so long could be solved over six months. Yudkowsky proposes immediately shutting down all large AI system training indefinitely and internationally, which would require large-scale policy change. 
"Many researchers steeped in these issues, including myself, expect that the most likely result of building a superhumanly smart AI, under anything remotely like the current circumstances, is that literally everyone on Earth will die," Yudkowsky asserts in a Time Magazine editorial. "Not as in 'maybe possibly some remote chance,' but as in 'that is the obvious thing that would happen.'"
Implementing any kind of moratorium on AI would likely be difficult, and the open letter certainly does not include many specifics on implementation. As Box CEO Aaron Levie told Axios,  "It was just, 'Let's now spend the time to get together and work on this issue.' But it was signed by people that have been working on this issue for the past decade." 
"There's a lot of conversation about, 'Let's pull the plug,' but I'm not sure there is a single plug," said Arati Prabhakar, director of the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy, to Axios. The office released a "Blueprint for an AI Bill of Rights" last fall.
Others feel that the letter is focused on the wrong issues. The open letter is most focused on how we should be afraid of models more powerful than GPT-4, largely referring to human-competitive intelligence or intelligence that even surpasses humans. But it's worth acknowledging that currently, artificial intelligence is not even close to being sentient, and not quite human-competitive either. Experts like Yudowsky agree that instances of people seeing AI claim to be sentient are likely AI simply imitating sentience from their training data. 
Many AI experts argue we should be more concerned about the risks in our existing AI, such as racial and gender biases, and that the open letter shifts away our focus onto a "Hollywood-esque" future of sentient AI. Shiri Dori-Hacohen, an assistant professor at the University of Connecticut cited in the open letter, disagreed with the language of the open letter. As she told Reuters: "AI does not need to reach human-level intelligence to exacerbate those risks … There are non-existential risks that are really, really important, but don't receive the same kind of Hollywood-level attention."
Margaret Mitchell, who co-founded the ML Fairness group at Google and is also cited in the open letter, echoed similar sentiments in conversation with Reuters: "Ignoring active harms right now is a privilege that some of us don't have."
It's also worth noting that many top OpenAI researchers have not signed the open letter, such as its CEO Sam Altman. (Altman and Elon Musk were co-founders of OpenAI, though Musk stepped down from its board of directors in 2018.) Given that OpenAI has not slowed down their improvements upon ChatGPT and the GPT language models in face of sudden popularity, it seems that many don't agree with taking a pause on AI, or that taking a pause on AI would solve the issue. When they first released ChatGPT to the public, they mentioned how this was essentially a public beta (a research preview, really) in order to better train GPT-3 in a conversation format and also to test ethical issues with the system.
In a statement in August, OpenAI described their plan for AI alignment, the practice of ensuring the safety of AI. Their approach is that for every highly-capable AI they release, they will attempt to align it with human ethical principles, refining their strategies in the process. By pushing alignment ideas as far as possible with our current AI, they believe they will be prepared in the future to handle artificial general intelligence (AGI), AI that can perform tasks and learn from their mistakes the same way humans do ("sentient" AI fall in this category). Part of this will also include training AI to help do AI alignment research.
It seems doubtful that too much will change over the next six months, though the heightened public awareness of AI could fuel new developments in AI alignment research. But no matter whether there is a pause on AI or not, it's highly unlikely that researchers will be able to create a simple or quick solution to AI's ethical dilemmas.

Last week, a series of “swatting” threats were made across America and Canada, in an attempt to generate chaos and fear within innocent people. On Wednesday morning, Pittsburgh Police operators were contacted with a number of computer-generated phone calls with claims of either an active bomb or active shooter situation going on at schools, two of which were Central Catholic and Oakland Catholic, which are in close proximity to Carnegie Mellon. 
The Tartan met with one of the teachers of Central Catholic High School to give us internal information on what happened.
Q: What was your first indicator that something was wrong? How did you respond?
A: At 10:16 a.m., when the bell rang to start fourth period, we heard the Blue Point Activation Lockdown announcement come over the intercom.  I was in the faculty room since it was my lunch period.  I was with about seven other teachers and about eight boys that we grabbed from the hallway.  Since we had practiced our lockdown drills before, we knew what to do.  We pulled the doors shut, pulled down the black shade to cover the windows in the door, and secured the door with the night lock.  Then we all moved away from the doors and sat down near the desks.
Q: How informed were you throughout the lockdown? What types of communications were happening between teachers or between Central admin and the police?
A: Our administrators came on the intercom and were keeping us updated. They informed us when we were in a soft lockdown and when we were to report to our homerooms. I am unaware of the communication with the admin and the police, but the admin was coming around to the individual homerooms and informing us that we were safe and they were going to start the evacuation process.  Meanwhile, I was texting a bunch of the other teachers to see if they were okay and how they were doing.
Q: How were you feeling throughout the lockdown? How do you think your students were feeling?
A: I was terrified until I knew for certain it was a hoax.  Normally, we get alerted about having a Blue Point lockdown drill, so when we went into lockdown I knew something was not right.  Once we were in lockdown, I immediately texted my husband and loved ones informing them of the situation and that I was safe.  It was also scary to see the SWAT team outside with guns entering the school.  I am certain some of my students were terrified.  When my homeroom returned after the lockdown, they told me how nervous they were, how one of them vomited, and how they started to break down and cry.
Pittsburgh was not the only target of this scare, as several counties around Western Pennsylvania were also victim to these attacks. Schools in Fayette Country, Beaver County, Lawrence County and Mercer County were all victim to these calls. Outside of Pennsylvania, schools in Utah were also evacuated due to fake calls on Wednesday, as well as nearly 30 schools in Massachusetts the day before.

On Monday, March 20, Howard Schultz stepped down as interim CEO of Starbucks two weeks earlier than expected. This comes less than two weeks after Schultz had agreed to testify in front of the Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions (HELP). The committee, chaired by Senator Bernie Sanders, was a day away from voting to subpoena Schultz. This past Wednesday, March 29, Schultz appeared before the committee for a two-hour testimony, during which he was asked repeatedly to defend his (former) company's unwillingness to engage with unionized workers.
During his time as CEO from 1982 to 2000, Shultz oversaw the expansion of Starbucks from a small franchise in Seattle to a juggernaut in the food industry. He returned to serve another ten years as CEO from 2008 to 2018, during which time he focused on creating a corporate culture that encouraged social responsibility. Though he retired in 2018, he returned once again in April of 2022 to serve as interim CEO, until this past week, when it seems he has stepped down for the third and final time. 
During his second tenure as CEO, he crafted the image of the benevolent boss and received praise for many of his liberal policies, including healthcare coverage and college tuition support for employees. In fact, he was even reported to have been one of Hillary Clinton's top choices for Secretary of Labor should she have won in 2016. But on Dec 9, 2021, a Starbucks branch in the Elmwood neighborhood of Buffalo voted to unionize, putting Schultz's character to the test in a dramatically public fashion. 
As of the publication of this article, it has been 480 days since this first store in Buffalo voted to unionize, and Starbucks has yet to negotiate a contract with that or any other unionized store in the country. Workers at many stores have reported seeing their hours slashed, unionized stores have been closed or merged with others, and many employees who organize their stores have been outright fired. In a particularly blatant case, workers at a unionizing store in Memphis, dubbed the "Memphis Seven," were fired and then reinstated after a federal judge ruled that their termination was wrongful. Starbucks, naturally, denies that any of this constitutes targeted anti-union measures. On March 1, a judge for the NLRB ruled that Starbucks had to reinstate a number of workers they had fired from unionized stores in Buffalo, NY, claiming that the company had engaged in "egregious and widespread misconduct."
Pittsburgh, in particular, has been the site of significant clashes between Starbucks Workers United, an affiliate of Worker's United that represents unionized stores, and the Starbucks Corporation. The city is home to 11 unionized stores, including the Craig Street store. In September 2022, these stores filed a complaint through the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB), alleging threats and intimidation against union stores. The employees at the Craig street store were subject to a disinformation campaign, plus attempts by Starbucks to schedule the union vote during the summer break (when many of the Pitt and CMU students staff the store would not be present to vote.)
During his testimony in front of the Senate HELP Committee, a common point by Schultz was that his workers don't "need a union" (in fact, much of the anti-union material made by Starbucks tells workers that they don't need a "third party" to seek redress with the corporation). Schultz also repeatedly brought up his humble upbringing, appearing to even take offense at Senator Sanders labeling him as a "billionaire." He spoke about his father, a World-War II veteran who was mistreated by his employer, as his motivation for having such generous benefits for his workers.  Senator Tina Smith from Minnesota observed that Schultz seems to be emotionally invested in the idea that his workers shouldn't "need" a union. "It seems that you feel only bad companies should be unionized ... But I think, Mr. Schultz, that is not your decision to make." 
Despite the pressure from the Starbucks corporation, Starbucks Workers United represents over 278 stores nationwide, and workers continue to fight for their right to organize.

Israel is facing another week of unprecedented protests against Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his proposed legislative overhaul. Netanyahu has served as Prime Minister of Israel on-and-off for the last 15 years, recently returning to power after being ousted by a coalition government of center-to-left parties. His return to power has come with significant changes, the most controversial of which involve sweeping judicial changes. Netanyahu’s current plans would shrink the power of the judicial system. By hampering the Supreme Court, and preventing it from being able to easily overturn laws made by the Knesset, Israel’s parliament, some believe this is Netanyahu’s attempt to erode democracy in the country. According to the head of the Israeli Bar Association, Avi Chimi, “They want to turn us into a dictatorship, they want to destroy democracy. They want to destroy judicial authority, there is no democratic country without a judicial authority.”
While Netanyahu dismisses the protests as just “the left” being unable to handle the results of the November election, his government is the most far-right in Israel’s history, including several far-right, ultra-nationalist parties in the alliance. With members like Itamar Ben-Gvir, who has been convicted of inciting racism and sponsoring Jewish terrorism, being named to positions of power, Netanyahu faces opposition across the spectrum. The previous coalition government featured a joint premiership which was split between Naftali Bennett’s Yamina, a center-right party, and Yair Lapid’s Yesh Atid, a center-left party. 
Netanyahu recently fired the defense minister, leading to a string of protests, resignations, and mass action to try to sway the government’s opinion. This movement was partially successful, with Netanyahu offering to delay the decisions until the new parliamentary session, a move which could be considered a victory, though considering the far-right’s commanding presence in the Knesset, may not stop the reforms from passing. 
However, this process represents only a part of what Netanyahu is committed to — the other part is in his government’s new pivot on the West Bank towards annexation. While no government of Israel in recent memory has been charitable towards the West Bank, Netanyahu’s new coalition of hardliners is far more committed to annexing the territory altogether. With the erosion of Israeli judicial power becoming a second facet to this goal, Netanyahu hopes to expand his power and control of the state in the coming months.

Tragedy struck in Nashville, Tenn. last Monday. The Covenant School, a private Presbyterian elementary school, was the target of a mass shooting that took the lives of an eight-year-old and two nine-year-old children, alongside three staff members. It marked the 19th shooting at an educational institution and 130th mass shooting in the U.S. this year.
The shooter was a 28-year-old former student of The Covenant School, fueled by a “resentment,” according to the Nashville Police. Authorities said the shooter did not have a criminal history and purchased seven firearms from five separate legal proprietors, three of which were used in the attack. 
NBC News reported that the weapons were kept hidden at the perpetrator’s parents’ home while under doctoral care for an “emotional disorder.” Under Tennessee legal code, someone receiving “voluntary treatment for mental conditions” can buy firearms, given they have not been “adjudicated as a mental defective or have been committed to a mental institution.” The incident, once again, has brought gun laws into question. Across the country, Democrats across are proposing expanding gun control policies while Republicans wish to retain or relax gun policies in place. Some Democrats, however, are hesitant to sign onto legislation, especially pertaining to the facts of this incident.
According to the police chief, the perpetrator identified as transgender, a demographic that tends to suffer more from emotional disorders. Targeted firearm legislation towards people suffering with similar emotional distress could make it disproportionately more difficult for many trans people and other affected groups to obtain firearms. 
According to investigators, the perpetrator wrote in notebooks their plans to commit a shooting across locations in Nashville before taking their own life. A written manifesto included maps of the school and other disturbing details. On the morning of the shooting, at around 9:54 a.m., the perpetrator arrived at the school parking lot and began texting a childhood friend, explaining the plan. At 10:13 a.m., the friend contacted Nashville’s Davidson County Sheriff's Office to report what was about to happen, and at 10:14 a.m., the perpetrator shot through a set of glass side doors and entered the building. 
Released body cam footage shows that police arrived at 10:24 a.m. and spared no time making their way into the building. On the second floor, at 10:27 a.m., they came in contact with the shooter and fatally shot them. In contrast, Uvalde police spent 74 minutes on-site before breaching the classroom with the shooter during the May 24 school shooting.
Nashville, along with the country, has come to mourn the victims and the families of all affected. The city of Nashville has set up a GoFundMe to assist the affected families, and The Community Foundation of Middle Tennessee has also set up a fund to manage donations made to the school. Within 48 hours of the events, over $203,135.70 was raised from 1,982 donations. 
First Lady Jill Biden visited Nashville to attend a candlelight vigil ceremony honoring and praying for the fallen victims as well as praising the police who responded quickly and heroically put themselves in front of danger to save children. President Joe Biden also addressed the school shooting, calling on Congress to enact an “assault weapons ban” to prevent further mass shootings from happening.  
While some politicians have come into a deadlock on the matter, some support for change has come up. Governor Bill Lee (Tenn.-R), has advocated for greater school security. Lt. Gov. Randy McNally (Tenn.-R) also called for increasing armed guards on school institutions and fortifying them with bulletproof windows and doors. Tennessee's U.S. senators Marsha Blackburn and Bill Hagerty have introduced a motion called SAFE School Act, applying $900 million of state funds towards “hardening” schools and increasing the presence of safety officers.

On March 27, First Citizens Bank agreed with Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) to purchase Silicon Valley Bank (SVB) at a discount price of $16.5 billion, assuming SVB’s assets of $110 billion, which consists of $56 billion in deposit and $72 billion in loans. 
The purchase led to the reopening of SVB’s 17 branches, but now operating as divisions of First Citizens Bank. According to First Citizens Bank, there will be no immediate change to customer’s current accounts. Customers should be able to write checks, cards, and make loan payments as before the failure of SVB. 
Given concerns regarding the safety of client deposits, Peter Bristow, the president of First Citizens Bank, stated that First Citizens Bank’s total liquidity is able to back 175 percent of current uninsured deposits at SVB, in addition to $35 billion cash guaranteed by FDIC insurance. 
In addition, the acquisition only slightly transferred risks that have previously been associated with SVB’s failure to First Citizens Bank. FDIC and First Citizens Bank entered a loss-share agreement, in which FDIC promised to cover some potential loss occurring during the recovery of SVB. The deal also does not include roughly $90 billion worth of SVB securities and other assets, which are still under FDIC’s management. In facing drastic volatility in the financial markets, this additional set of assets could bring detrimental liquidity and other types of risks to First Citizens Bank. 
The market has responded positively to this purchase, reflected by 45 percent surge on March 27, and the steady growth in stock price since then. Acquiring SVB brought a tailwind to the bank since its dramatic fall in stock price at the beginning of March. 
The absorption of SVB can be a strategic choice for First Citizens Bank to expand its client base into the West coast and the technology ventures community, as this deal allowed them to gain the former technology venture clients of SVB. However, whether Silicon Valley technology business operators and venture capital investors will restore their trust in First Citizens Bank is still uncertain. Many could turn to more secured, “too big to fall,” national banks to seek for better deposit security during this time of instability in the financial markets, instead of more convenient regional banks, such as the former SVB.

Though we all know now that nobody was hurt at Central Catholic High School on March 29, I want to write this article as if someone were. It’s not that I would wish that on anyone, but that I want to enforce the idea that anything could have happened. For those who do not know, Central Catholic High School is a private, all-male, Catholic high school with little to no building security. There is no reason why they could not have become part of the epidemic of school shootings that has been sweeping our country for the last decade. I went to kindergarten with boys who grew up and went off to Central, and when I saw the first Twitter headline, I thought to myself, “dear god, not them too.”
I then got down on my knees and started praying. My phone was blowing up with all sorts of information — people saying it was a “hoax” (which I think is an accurate but sick word to use for a falsified police call), people saying six boys were dead, people saying they hoped they didn’t lose points for missing class. People were taking photos of stretchers entering and exiting the building and screenshots of sketchy Twitter news sources. I will try not to comment on the language used by some of my peers around the event, but I will comment on some behaviors that I noticed that I think Carnegie Mellon as a whole should take responsibility for.
Next, I got a text notification that Carnegie Mellon PD were calling for a shelter-in-place. Except that’s not really what the message said. It actually said, “There is a large police presence at Central Catholic High School, next door to CMU residential buildings. Please avoid the area.” I did wonder why the shelter-in-place mandate was not part of the actual body of the message. A while later I received a RAVE Mobile Safety Alert that said, very clearly, “Shelter-in-place,” which was also the subject of an email that I received from the same system. 
What happened after that was what really surprised me: nothing. Students did not observe the shelter-in-place. Neither did most professors. Classes were not canceled (and no, it’s not enough to just send people the link to the CaPS website and hope for the best). By the time the Carnegie Mellon alert system gave the all-clear, I was already in class, 30 minutes deep in a lecture on glucose because what other choice did I have? Everybody kept moving, though we did not know if anyone had been hurt, though helicopters were circling overhead. And in doing so, I believe we failed.
As a university, we failed the Central Catholic students who might have been in danger and the first responders who needed crosswalks clear and passers-by off of the sidewalks (a great reason to shelter in place even if you’re not concerned about your own safety). We failed our peers who did not have the ability to focus during lecture, who were scared and scarred by the heavy police presence and the language around gun violence. 
Most of all, we failed everyone who has ever been a victim of gun violence. By acting like nothing was happening while a potential active shooter was right next our campus, we denied the danger and severity of these types of incidents. When we behave in accordance with the desensitization to violence that as a generation we claim to hate, we keep it in perpetual motion. Thank God nobody was hurt, but if they had been, we would have been in class, probably thinking about how terrible it is that nobody cares about this sort of thing in America. If you are defiant, show it. You should be angry. You should be sad. You should be panicked. Certainly we are not to blame for the epidemic of gun violence in schools, but if we do not behave as if it matters to us when it is happening on our doorstep, how can we expect change?

On Thursday, March 30, a grand jury in Manhattan indicted former president Donald Trump for illegally sending hush money to adult film performer, Stormy Daniels. This case began in 2018 when Trump's former lawyer Michael Cohen pled guilty to making a deal with the tabloid National Enquirer to pay off Daniels, who was aiming to sell a story about an affair she alleges to have had with Donald Trump. Cohen made the payment of $130,000 shortly before the 2016 election, and Donald Trump reimbursed Cohen for this while in the White House. This reimbursement is the specific criminal act committed by Trump, as the payment was fraudulently accounted as a business expense. This act itself only constitutes a misdemeanor; however, falsifying business records can be elevated to a felony in New York if it can be shown that it was done to facilitate an additional criminal activity. In this case, the additional crime would be violating campaign finance law (based on the idea that by the hush money counts as an improper "donation" to the Trump campaign by burying a potentially damaging story just before the election).
In general, charges that are approved by a grand jury are not made public until the defendant appears in court. As such, we don't yet know what specific charges have been approved against Trump. He is expected to appear in New York on Tuesday, April 4, where he will voluntarily surrender before the court — this means we probably won't get a video of a cop slapping handcuffs on his wrists while his Miranda Rights are being read. 
Overwhelmingly, the sentiment one gets from hearing the details of this case are, "Really? This is what we got him for?" This is not to imply that the charges being approved by the grand jury aren't valid. It does indeed appear that he and Cohen committed a financial crime in this instance. However, it really seems that paying hush money to a porn actress is rather low on the list of Trump's infractions against our legal institutions.
To be clear, it is genuinely without precedent for a former U.S. president to be indicted on criminal charges. This is uncharted legal territory, and for that alone this indictment is noteworthy and historical. But ultimately, these charges are only effective insofar as they can limit his ability to hold political office again, and it really doesn't seem like that's the case here. Richard Hasen, a professor of election law at UCLA tells Time Magazine, “There is no constitutional bar on a felon running for office.” Should he be found guilty and sent to prison, while it might prove a hurdle to his campaign, he wouldn't even be the first presidential candidate to run while incarcerated.
It is certainly important to establish that nobody should be above the rule of law, including (and especially) politicians. However, indicting Trump over hush money charges which won't actually limit his ability to commit further crimes seems like a hollow victory.

Seeing Ira Glass’ face was a strange experience — kind of like seeing the real person behind the voice of Siri. The premise of the show was “7 Things I’ve Learned,” in which Glass explains seven things he’s learned in his four decades of radio experience. Let me get the review section out of the way first: the show was incredible. It blended casual conversation with more structured talk, all while Glass was mixing the show live. He had a little iPad from which he played interviews, animations, even the quirky background music listeners would recognize from the radio show. It was like watching an episode of the show come to life before you. So if anyone has the chance, I highly recommend seeing it.
I saw the show with my dad, who introduced me to "This American Life." We sat in the furthest back row possible. Sitting that far back, it almost felt like we had the room to ourselves, absorbing Glass’ lessons. Here’s the two that I really carried home with me: 
1) How to Interview Kids. The first one is a bit of a misnomer, because it’s not just about how to interview kids. During this segment, Glass discusses interviewing 14-year old Joe Kendrick who swears he will never fall in love. 14-year old Joe doesn’t understand the hype around love and vows that it’ll never happen to him. Then we see an update of Joe ten years later who, lo and behold, has a girlfriend who he has fallen very much in love with. Adult Joe apologizes for letting his teenage self down but doesn’t regret his decision, knowing that his teenage self would realize it someday. Joe pauses to contemplate this fate. Despite knowing that he would eventually prove himself wrong, Joe reflects that there was nothing any adult could’ve said that would’ve convinced 14-year-old Joe otherwise. He simply had to wait and see for himself.
2) You Have to Be Bad Before You’re Good. Here, Glass pokes a bit of fun at himself. He plays clips from the first few years of his radio experience to point out how bad it is. And he’s right, it’s not great. Which is funny, because "This American Life" was a genre-changing show, it quite literally set the precedent for all entertainingly informative podcasts to come. Glass is a staple of his field, and yet listening to young Ira, his early work is undeniably bad. Here at Carnegie Mellon, we are no strangers to impostor syndrome. And while it’s nice to hear that “No, you are not as bad as you think, you just need some confidence”, there’s a different kind of comfort here. That yes, maybe you are a little bad at this, but that’s not a condemnation to failure. You have to be bad before you’re good. So if you’re bad now, just keep being bad, there’s hope for you yet.
I’m a third-year and graduation is just looming on the horizon. I’m terrified of it, and, weirdly enough, this show made me confront some of that fear. I’m terrified of making mistakes, I’m terrified of being bad. It’s why I’m an awful driver and a worse student. Try as you like, mistakes will happen and you will be bad at something. It’s like realizing that your childhood dog will someday die — hard to face, but it’s all part of the process. That shouldn’t discourage us, in fact it should inspire us to be unafraid of failure and pet our dogs more often. Despite knowing this, it’s still difficult to process that our life is beyond our control. After all, we are all just like Joe Kendrick: We will just have to find out for ourselves.

Urho Kekkonen had a singular goal as President of Finland: to prevent further war from gripping Europe, much like what he'd seen growing up. At Helsinki, with a number of countries coming to negotiate terms for a new Europe, Kekkonen did just that. His negotiations and diplomacy set into motion the rules and order that would keep Europe in one piece, set aside unspoken rules of engagement, and bring up the concept that would become critical in future diplomacy — the neutral negotiator. What Kekkonen envisioned was that a neutral country would be the main intermediary in any negotiation between two countries. While that’s not always been the case, it’s been a good guiding principle for fair negotiations between two countries. The U.N. has acted similarly in the current day, with its large, unwieldy general assembly acting as an essentially neutral arbiter. All in all, these factors have helped create a sense for how negotiation ought to be considered.
However, China has now started stepping into the conflict in Ukraine. That is something that should be cause for concern. Last week, a colleague of mine wrote a piece titled, "China's Russia-Ukraine negotiations plan isn't that unexpected." She argues that China is just stepping into its role as a new superpower, similar to how it acted in past negotiations between the Saudis and Iran. The thing is, I don't believe that’s the natural step up. With Saudi Arabia and Iran, China had a pretty clear reason to intervene. They are a massive purchaser of oil from Saudi Arabia and a massive ally to Iran. China is friendly with both countries, and they don't have a regional military presence or other goals. They're not neutral in the unaffiliated sense, but they still follow Kekkonen's model for arbiters.
That is not remotely the case in the war against Ukraine. Here, China has a lot at stake, and the country has continued to display that. First, the issue of Ukrainian self-determination is a thorny issue for them, considering that the argument made by the Russians in favor of "liberating" Luhansk and Donetsk is based on the idea that those regions are agitating for autonomy — something China is unwilling to give Taiwan. If China were to acknowledge that breakaway states can form, that only strengthens the idea that Taiwan is a legitimate state. But beyond that, China isn’t a traditional negotiator in any regard. They are strongly allied with Russia (the two nations went out of their way to reiterate that recently), and they are neutral, at best, with Ukraine. China remains a purchaser of Russian military equipment, as well as an exporter of previously sold Russian technology. These two things, when combined, puts China as an obvious ally of Russia, an obviously biased party, and ill-fitting negotiator. 
It’s important to discuss this, because China’s only real reason to be involved in this conflict as a negotiator is if it’s trying to do what it claims the United States does. Essentially, China is saying “if the U.S. puts its nose into a bunch of international events, why can’t we.”
That’s where things get a bit complicated. While the writer is absolutely right that this would make sense if China was a world military power — this is a military conflict, not an economic one. That’s a minor distinction to most, but it’s one that needs to be focused on. China cannot park a carrier in the Black Sea and negotiate, it can’t do much of anything. The U.S. can drop a flight ceiling, shut down the air, and stop things from happening. European countries can do similar things, and use their proximity to induce control. It’s a matter of power projection. Europe projects its military onto itself; the United States, through NATO and the U.S. Navy, projects onto most of the world. But China can’t project at all into Europe as it currently stands. These negotiations lack the motivation that would make them make sense — unless China sees this as an attempt to assert power over a region it can't reasonably control.
That’s the crux of this whole thing. It’s not that China is stepping into its role, but I believe that China is attempting to expand it. By applying their economic power into Europe, without the military projection to back it up, China is acting in a surprising way.

Novel-tea is The Tartan’s literary and language opinion column, so if you like hot takes and reading about cool ideas in the literary community then this is the place for you!! If you have your own hot take to add to this column, do not hesitate to contact us.
A book has many important components, and arguably the most significant one is its plot. According to Encyclopedia Britannica, in fiction, a plot is “the structure of interrelated actions, consciously selected and arranged by the author.” This crucial narrative element has been getting some criticism online with the popularity of novels that have “no plot, just vibes.” But, what does that actually mean?
After extensive TikTok watching, I have found that these books are not actually plotless, but are simply character-driven stories rather than action-driven. This means that narrative and characterization are at the heart of these stories, to the point where plot (the sequence of actions and events) seems to take a backseat. The trend in literary fiction, in particular, seems to focus on really getting inside characters' heads rather than looking to action and movement to drive the story forward.
One such book that I recently finished is an incredible novel “Loop” by Brenda Lozano, in which not much happens, besides what’s in the narrator’s head. The whole story surrounds a woman waiting for her boyfriend Jonás to return back from a trip. The book acts as a pseudo-notebook/diary for the narrator where she describes every observation and thought she has while waiting. It’s an ode to love, loneliness, and writing. I loved every second of this book, but I honestly can’t name a single event that happened outside the narrator's consciousness. However, I felt what the narrator felt. I felt close to her, understood by her, and was fascinated by her inner dialogue. 
That closeness to the human psyche, that feeling of understanding, is what I believe people love about these books. In a world where we are all increasingly desensitized to the horrific things that happen around us, we can look to books to bring us back to our humanity. In characters, we are able to find faulty, interesting, people that make us understand our own flaws. 
Am I saying that we should stop producing books that are plot driven? Absolutely not. What I am saying is that it makes sense in light of COVID and an increasing physical distance driven by socializing online that people want to get close to characters. 
Particularly, in America, there is a prevalent culture of mental-health self-diagnosis and internal angst. This widespread feeling is driven by a desire to figure out why we are the way we are. So much happens in the world around us that it can be refreshing to read books about internal reflection and conflict, rather than external action. 
In short, no plot, just vibes has the power to help us find ourselves through others.

When I think of the most reputable newspapers in the country, I first think of the New York Times and the Washington Post. To me, those are the top-tier journalistic sources — the papers that people subscribe to across the country, not just those living in New York City or Washington D.C. They are so recognizable that they are the only two papers whose slogans I know off the top of my head: “All the News That’s Fit to Print” and “Democracy Dies in Darkness.” This just goes to show that these two papers are some of the most popular in the country.
The emergence of social media completely changed how people consume news. Today, about half of all Americans get some of their news from social media. This might come directly from accounts run by independent journalists (or by anybody, really), but big newspapers such as the New York Times and the Washington Post have also created curated news feeds on platforms such as Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, and Tiktok. Since my most-used social media platform is Instagram, I am very familiar with both the New York Times and Washington Post Instagram pages. But recently, the Washington Post has been generating some unconventional news content that is worth further investigation.
At first glance, the profile page of the Washington Post seems normal — it follows a consistent format of text style with a mix of photographs and digital art to support the headlines. However, after a bit of scrolling, some non-traditional news stories begin to appear. Interspersed between posts about climate change, politics, and culture are posts detailing what some would consider weird or wacky news. Some of my favorite posts in this category include “Life as a national mustache champion: ‘I drink a lot more stuff with straws,’” “TSA found a gun inside a raw chicken,” and “A mayor in England is fighting for his office. He’s also a pony.” This type of news is certainly not what one would expect to find on the front page of one of the most prominent newspapers in the country, leading to the question: Has the Washington Post become too silly? 
Personally, I have to answer that no, the Washington Post has not become too silly. These days, it is easy to get overwhelmed with bad news. Reports of death, destruction, and irreparable regression of the human race are almost everywhere I look. So for the Washington Post to publish a few lighthearted stories about funny goings-on is not a crime. Rather, it offers a respite from the seriousness of today’s world. 
The eye-catching headlines also help engage more audiences with journalism. For example, someone might see a more frivolous post from the Washington Post and decide to follow their account, thus exposing them to more robust journalism in their feed and helping them become informed global citizens. In a way, the Washington Post may be generating more followers with their tactic of covering lighthearted news as well as traditional news. We could all do with a little more laughter in our lives and the Washington Post is merely helping us get there.
