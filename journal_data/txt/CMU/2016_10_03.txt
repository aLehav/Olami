The Carnegie Mellon women’s soccer team took the field on Saturday against the 10th ranked Brandeis University Judges. The Tartans fought a tough battle but ended falling 2–0, putting their record at 6–3–1 on the season.
The game got off to a rough start for the Tartans. Halfway through the first minute, Tartan goalkeeper Mia Keyser attempted to pass the ball to one of her teammates but an opposing player intercepted it. The Brandeis player then sent the ball immediately over Keyser’s head and the Judges suddenly had a one score lead just as fast as the game had started.
The Tartans did not give up though. They continued to play aggressively and even got a chance to score in the ninth minute. Senior midfielder Delaney Lam made a shot but it was saved by the Brandeis goalkeeper. The Tartans were consistent in the offensive attack but could never manage to finish the job. Sophomore forward Kaily Bruch had back-to-back unsuccessful shot attempts in the 33rd minute and the Brandeis defense looked to be unbreakable. The Tartans tried their best to make something happen but couldn’t find any momentum.
The Judges finally put the nail in the coffin when they went on an offensive attack. A Brandies player sent the ball across the net to a teammate, who took the shot but it was knocked away by Keyser. Another Brandeis player collected the rebound and sent ball to the back of the net, putting the Judges up 2–0.
The Tartans never managed to find a way back into the game. Despite a couple close shots on goal in the second half, the Tartans found themselves unable to create any tangible offensive production, which is not usually the case.
If the Tartans want to win games in the future, they’ll need to be able to put points on the scoreboard. They had plenty of chances in this match, but couldn’t capitalize on any of them. This was only the first University Athletic Association (UAA) competition for the Tartans, so they’ll have plenty of time to bounce back in future games.
Even though they lost by two scores, the Tartans should be proud of the things they did right in this game. That said, they’ll also need to pinpoint their mistakes if they want to beat higher-ranked teams like Brandeis in the future.
The Tartans will travel to New York University for their next match on Saturday, Oct. 8. The game is scheduled to start at 11 a.m.

The Carnegie Mellon women’s volleyball team began the University Athletic Association (UAA) conference play on Saturday with a disappointing pair of losses. They were defeated by Washington University in St. Louis 3–1, and they also fell to the University of Chicago, 3–2. These losses moved the Tartans to 15–4 on the season, but 0–2 in UAA play.
In the match against Washington University in St. Louis, the Tartans dropped the first set 19–25 before reversing the score in the second set and evening the match at 1–1. The Bears went on to take the next two sets, 25–17 and 25–13.
Sophomore Lauren Mueller led the offense in the first match for the Tartans with 13 kills. Senior Emily Newton recorded 32 assists and nine digs, while senior Molly Higgins had 23 digs. Junior Eliza Donahue had two block assists on top of five solo blocks.
In the second match against Chicago, the Tartans dropped the first 25–22 and the second 27–25. They rallied to win the third and fourth set 25–19 and 25–17, but could not complete the performance and lost the fifth set 15–12.
Junior Heather Holton had 14 kills in this match for the Tartans, and Mueller contributed another 13 kills as well. Donahue and sophomore Sarah Jurgens each had 10 kills in the offensive performance for the Tartans, and Newton had 43 assists. Higgins led the defense with 28 digs, while Donahue and Jurgens both had two solo blocks.
These losses will surely put a damper on the impressive run that the Tartans have put together in the beginning of this season, but they can learn from their mistakes in these games to get back into normal form.
On Sunday, the Tartans wrapped up UAA round robin play with a match against Brandeis University. The 3–0 win ended the Tartans' weekend on a high note and improves their record to 16–4. The Tartans won each set decisively, with set scores of 25–13, 25–16, and 25–23.
Senior setter Emily Newton had a strong offensive performance with 18 assists, while sophomore Lauren Mueller had 14 kills. Senior Jackie Gibbons also contribute five kill in the victory. Sophomore Amanda Thiele had eight assists of her own and first-year Maia So-Holloway had six. Senior libero Molly Higgins recorded 18 digs in the win.
The Tartans return to UAA play on Saturday, October 15 as they take on New York University in the second UAA round robin. The game will be played at Brandeis University and is scheduled to start at 10:30 a.m.

The Carnegie Mellon football team took on Bethany College on Saturday. The Tartans defeated the Bison 49–26, taking their overall record to 2–2 and their Presidents’ Athletic Conference (PAC) record to 2–1.
The Bison started off with a long touchdown run that was called back due to a penalty. Junior outside linebacker Kyle Brittain recovered a fumble off a passing play, giving the Tartans the ball in Bethany’s territory. Junior quarterback Bryan Jangro returned to the field for the first time since his injury against Waynesburg two weeks ago. Junior wide receiver Alex Froimzon caught a ball deep around the goal line, and junior running back Sam Benger eventually punched it in, giving the Tartans a 7–0 lead.
Bethany called up quite a few running plays, advancing to the Tartans’ side of the field. After getting into the red zone, the Tartans managed a heavy hit that forced a fumble, though Bethany was able to recover the ball. As Bethany approached the goal line, a lightning delay paused the game for 30 minutes. The Bison came out with a running play to the right that scored a touchdown but was called back due to a holding call. A few plays later, Bethany finally completed a touchdown pass to their tight end, tying up the score 7–7.
First-year running back William Richter returned the ensuing kickoff to their 45-yard line. Benger ran the ball to the Bison side of the field. A great pass to junior wide receiver John Prather allowed him to get in position to get the ball to the goal line, and Benger brought it in a few plays later, putting the Tartans up 14–7.
The next drive saw the Tartan defense put a stop to the Bison offense, shutting down an outside run on first down and taking down a quarterback draw two plays later. Richter returned the ensuing punt to the Bison 36-yard line before the opposing punter managed to take him down. Jangro on the next play passed deep to Prather, connecting for a touchdown that put the Tartans up 21–7. Bethany started their next drive near midfield and quickly got a deep completion, scoring a touchdown but missing the extra point that took the score to 21–13. Richter took the ensuing kickoff past midfield to end the first quarter.
In the second quarter, Benger took off for 49 yards to score a touchdown that put the Tartans up 28–13. Bethany attempted to even up the score quickly, but the Tartan defense was able to stop them in their tracks. The Tartan offense was pinned within their 20-yard line, and Jangro was unable to make a deep pass to junior wide receiver Tommy Mansfield due to the pressure of Bethany’s defense. On the next drive, Bethany was able to move the ball near midfield before the Tartan defense shut them down. The Tartan offense went three and out, but the Bison returned muffed the punt, allowing senior cornerback Jonathan Dyer to recover the ball in the red zone. A few plays later, Jangro completed a touchdown pass to Froimzon, putting the Tartans up 35–13.
The next drive for Bethany saw them march to the other side of the field before a long completion resulted in a touchdown pass that brought the score to 35–20. Sophomore running back Rory Hubbard returned the ball to the 48-yard line on the ensuing kickoff, but the Tartans were unable to do much more after a miscommunication on third down led to Jangro overthrowing his receiver. Junior punter and kicker Tyler Kohman pinned Bethany to their 5-yard line, forcing them to take a knee to end the half.
At the start of the third quarter, Bethany opted to make an attempt at an onside kick, but the Tartans managed to recover the ball. Benger made a few good running plays afterward. Unfortunately, a tipped pass allowed Bethany to make an interception, but the Tartan defense was able to keep them from doing much with the turnover. The Tartans went three and out, but the Tartan defense forced a three and out against the Bison.
The next drive saw Prather haul in a pass that got the Tartans into Bison territory before Prather caught a 41-yard pass for a touchdown, putting the Tartans up 42–20. Junior inside linebacker Sean Graff intercepted the ball on Bethany’s next drive. On their next play, Benger took it to the house from 55 yards out, putting the Tartans ahead 49–20 before the end of the third quarter.
Despite the four score shortfall, Bethany came out swinging with a 33-yard run to start the fourth quarter. The Bison made it to the red zone, but the Tartans managed to stop them on fourth down. Sophomore quarterback Alex Cline took over on the next drive, but he threw an interception that was returned deep in Tartan territory. The Bison scored on the next play, bringing the score to 49–26 after Bethany missed the extra point.
Bethany attempted another onside kick, but the Tartans recovered it. The offense went three and out, but the Tartans forced one against the Bison. The Tartans once again went three and out without taking much time off the clock. The Bison tried to go for it on fourth and long, but the pass went incomplete. Junior quarterback Scot Beumel went in on the next drive, but spent his time handing the ball off to Richter. The Tartans brought the ball to the goal line before proceeding to run the clock out and end the game.
Both sides of the ball had their ups and downs during the game. The first quarter looked like the game would turn into a shootout before the Tartan defense finally began figuring out how to stop the Bison. Bethany’s defense eventually put a hold on the Tartan offense, but it was too late for the Bison offense to catch up.
Senior defensive end Brian Khoury recorded 2.5 sacks to tie the record for most career sacks in Tartan history. Richter and Kohman were both instrumental in special teams dominance. Jangro looked much better in this game than he did the first two weeks, and Benger was able to break through many times. The Tartans appear ready to take on any challenger.
The Tartans will next play at Washington and Jefferson University on Saturday, Sept. 8.

The Carnegie Mellon men’s soccer team faced off against Brandeis University on Saturday in University Athletic Association (UAA) conference play. The Tartans tied the Judges 1–1, which takes the Tartans' record to 7–1–1.
There was little action in the beginning of the game, but that changed in the 17th minute when the Tartans committed a foul and awarded the Judges a penalty kick. Sophomore goalkeeper Alec Lam saved the penalty kick attempt, but the shot rebounded to a Brandeis player who immediately took another shot. Lam didn’t give up and made a diving save, only to have the rebound be sent straight to the back of the net before he could react. The Tartans only managed to take one shot in the first half, which came in the 17th minute when sophomore midfielder Zack Masciopinto headed a shot toward the goal but it was too wide. 
The game remained stagnant for the rest of the first half, with neither team finding a way to capitalize on the small opportunities they could find. Then in the 50th minute, a Brandeis player received a red card and the Tartans were given a one player advantage on the field. This advantage allowed the Tartans to exert more pressure on their opponents, which culminated in the Tartans’ first and only goal of the game in the 76th minute. Sophomore forward Anthony Gulli shot a free kick that appeared to be saved by the Brandeis goalkeeper, but he couldn’t secure it and the ball rolled across the line to tie the game at 1–1 for the Tartans.
The Tartans had finally gained some momentum, and Masciopinto took another shot a minute later but it sailed too high. Shortly after, Lam saved a shot by Brandeis that would have given them the lead. The game would end up going into the overtime period tied at 1–1.
The extra time was much of the same as the second half. Each team had a few chances to score but neither could capitalize. The Tartans and the Judges each had a shot on goal that was saved by the respective keepers. Without any team to definitively take the lead, the game ended in a 1–1 tie. This was the first of the season for the Tartans, who also only have one defeat on their record so far. 
The Tartans will play on their home turf on Tuesday, Oct. 4 as they take on University of Pittsburgh-Greensburg at 7 p.m.

Hello, it's me. I was wondering if after all these months you've missed getting your weekly fantasy football update from your old friend Sarah.
That's right, I was the biggest loser last week. One of the Teams Foley got lucky when I made not just one or two bad bench calls, but four. Four bad calls that could have earned me an extra 50 points, saving me the humiliation of only scoring 64 points. But hindsight is 20-20, and the matchup was 86–64.
[BOLD]Team Foley over McManus’s Anus 86–64[BOLD]
Remember how Panthers' wide receiver Kelvin Benjamin was really great for two weeks in a row, raking in 21 and 29 points for me in weeks one and two, respectively? And remember how I reached for legendary Patriots' tight end Gronk in the draft, and then he was injured for weeks one and two? Well, I started them both this week, then they both scored me a hard zero. So thanks for nothing, a-holes. Meanwhile on the bench I had QB Matt Stafford with 26 points, and wide receiver Michael Crabtree with 18. But I'm not bitter. Especially not about the part where Team Foley's kicker Justin Tucker of the Ravens scored 17 points to McManus's 5. That's fine.
[BOLD]Dreamland Warriors over Masshole Knickerbockers 137-86[BOLD]
Assistant Sports Editor Ian Tanaya's Dreamland Warriors continue to make Kirby proud. Just among New Orleans QB Drew Brees, Bills' running back Lesean McCoy, and Seahawks' kicker Steven Hauschka, Tanaya raked in 64 points. Two thirds of his team scored double digits. Even though Beresford and the Masshole Knickerbockers had two awesome performances — 23 from Tampa Bay running back Charles Sims and 24 from Jaguars wide receiver Allen Robinson — the rest of her lineup kind of crapped the bed. My thoughts are with you, Lula.
[BOLD]Mr. Rodgers' Neighborhood over Plaidie Daddies 132-96[BOLD]
This was a juicy matchup. Best friend versus best friend. Jade versus India. Competition was intense. Operations Manager Jade Crockem sealed the deal as the only team with an undefeated record. She can send a major thank you to Aaron Rodgers, Green Bay QB and all-around babe, for his solid four touchdowns and 24 points, and Seahawks wide receiver Doug Baldwin who received for an actually astounding 164 yards and 30 points. Online Editor India Price's Emanuel Sanders, wide receiver for the Broncos, also had a pretty impressive week, receiving for 117 yards and raking in 32 points. But unfortunately, Price's lineup didn't have the depth we saw in Crockem's, and Crockem continues to reign. If I were a betting woman, I'd put my money on her to stay undefeated another week, as she only has Pillbox Editor Abhishek Tayal and his team Minaj And Co. to beat. We just explained to him this past week what a "down" means.
[BOLD]Team Foley over Minaj And Co. 131–119[BOLD]
I have to say how impressed I am that Team Foley has been so successful this season. And in week two, somehow four of Team Foley's players scored more than 20 points (Rams' running back Todd Gurley with 21, 49ers running back Carlos Hyde with 25, Bears' tight end Zach Miller with 27, and Falcons' running back Devonta Freeman with 31). So basically I curse whatever deities exist for the unfairness that was this auto-draft. Tayal and Minaj And Co. still had a pretty good week, though, I have to say. The Chiefs absolutely destroyed the Jets 24–3 last week, so good thing Tayal started their D/ST for a total of 32 points. Dolphins' wide receiver Jarvis Landry also brought in a solid 26 points, but in the end it didn't matter. Too bad Tayal wasn't playing the other Team Foley or he could have won, and I still would have lost anyway. Can you tell I'm bitter?
[BOLD]extremely dank team over Flaming Bears 144–143[BOLD]
I have to say this margin makes me laugh pretty hard at Layout Manager Zeke Rosenberg's expense. Last weekend his attention was pretty occupied by having to take the LSATs, so he forgot to put Green Bay wide receiver Jordy Nelson back into his starting lineup. So of course Nelson scored 28 points for the bench and Rosenberg soiled his undefeated record. I'm sorry, but ha-ha-ha-ha. Sports Editor Alex Wood's extremely dank team can thank Colts' wide receiver T.Y. Hilton for his exceptional 31 points, but the rest of his team is still just pretty great - dare I say dank? I'm thinking I should propose a trade and throw in a couple of articles for his section next week so try to get my hands on some actually successful players.
For week four, I'm excited to see how the inevitable Team Foley versus Team Foley epic matchup will go. My money is definitely on Team Foley! The only other matchup I'm really excited about is my own, against Rosenberg's Flaming Bears, because as a wise friend once told me, "The most interesting thing to talk about is your own fantasy team. The least interesting thing to listen to someone talk about is their own fantasy team."

This week at Student Pugwash, the Science, Technology, and Society discussion club, we discussed the importance — or lack thereof — of the creation of a public image by scientists and the effects it can have on both the scientific community and the public. 
Specifically, we covered the topics of liability of scientists with regards to their results and the effects that they may hold, and how to educate the public about the process of scientific rigor and what it entails.
The events that were presented with regards to this topic were the charging of scientists in Italy in 2009 with manslaughter with the misreporting of the probability of an earthquake, and the confidence of British scientists in the lack of ability for Mad Cow Disease to spread to humans through infected beef before the disease leapt to humans.
The first of the topics examined was the role that uncertainty plays in the scientific community and the reporting of said aspect to the public. 
We considered the existence of error in scientific reporting, and the characteristics of the inherent falsifiability of the scientific endeavor.
First, a member brought up the positive reporting bias in science, which led another student to bring up the topic of the creation of incorrect conclusions from poor experimental design and rigged result reporting, specifically treating such negligence as manslaughter. 
A different student proposed that scientists should be immune to the law and instead practice self-governance through rigor in the publishing of papers. 
Another student proposed the promotion of the replication of scientific studies of particular interest.
From this topic we proceeded in addressing the liability — legal and social — when it comes to publicizing the conclusions to scientific studies, specifically with comparing the reports of scientists and potential failings to infrastructure designed and built by designers and engineers.
At first, a Pugwash member proposed that similar to the punishment given out to designers of poorly constructed buildings, scientists should be punished in accordance with that negligence. 
Another participant built off of that idea by proposing that the punishment only be in the case of bad data. For example, if a bridge were to be destroyed by a natural disaster, then the scientist should only be punished if the conclusion is based off of bad data.
As a counter to the comparison between engineers and scientists, a different student proposed that it would be hard to compare the roles of engineer and scientist, as engineers have codes and lists of requirements to follow that usually result in more predictable results, while scientists are supposed to push boundaries with relatively unpredictable results. 
Furthermore, to address the subject of false reporting, the student also brought up the misreporting that occasionally occurs with meteorology scientists and whether or not said behavior should be punished as a result.
From here we returned to the reporting of the existence of scientific error and the effect it could have on societal trust in science. 
A student mentioned that the positions of celebrity scientists, such as Bill Nye and Neil deGrasse Tyson, should be used to report on how to read science with regards to the existence of such error reporting.
Another student mentioned the role of the media in scientific reporting and proposed that the media is actually a neutral entity that can and actively does mislead people. 
To be specific, the student mentioned the use of press releases and the mistranslations of scientific results in those press releases. 
Another member provided an example of when a researcher simply worked in the normalization of data in a powerline study, and the media’s exaggerated and false conclusion of the results lead to him leaving Stanford under the pressure of power companies. 
A potential solution to this dangerous misrepresentation could be as follows: the media may create a story, but other media companies must work as a check on those stories.
At the end of the meeting, the general consensus was that the reporting of science to the media and the populace is marred with flaws and misunderstandings. 
But a different view, mentioned as a closing remark, noted that a site designed for the reporting of science in a media-like fashion exists where the articles are 
written by scientists themselves. 
The existence of the site could be seen as a hopeful outlook on the relationship between scientists and public.
Student Pugwash is a non-advocacy, educational organization that discusses the implications of science. This article is a summary of last week’s discussion on the liability of scientists in regards to their results.

This year, Carnegie Mellon University has moved closer to the ideal of gender equality. For the first time in the institution’s 116-year history, women make up almost half of the first-year students admitted into science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) programs. 
The School of Computer Science is comprised of an astonishing 48.5 percent women, while the College of Engineering inches closely behind with 43.3 percent of its first-years being female.
This feat is significant because it comes amid ailing admission rates for women in science and technology fields across the country. 
The national average for women in computer science and engineering is a meager 20 percent. 
Moreover, this low percentage of American women in STEM fields in a university reflects itself in the work force; although women make up half of employees in the U.S., they occupy less than 25 percent of STEM job positions, according to a report by the United States Department of Commerce’s Economics and Statistics Administration.
Carnegie Mellon’s efforts to close the gender gap are as pertinent as ever. 
The university has implemented middle and high school student programs, judicious admission processes, and empowering organizations to draw more women into STEM at the institution. Programs such as Creative Technology Nights for Girls, Summer Engineering Experiences for Girls (SEE), and the Outreach Roadshow, ensure young girls are exposed to engineering early into their middle and high school life. 
It is this preconditioning that has allowed for more women in the class of 2020 to enroll into technical courses, including game theory and chemical engineering.
The admission process has also become far more solicitous with time. 
Looking at candidates with higher SAT scores and GPAs than ever before, admissions officers had the challenge of cherry-picking the best students while ensuring minorities were not underrepresented.
However, the most pivotal aspect responsible for this achievement is a new mindset among faculty. 
Carol Frieze, a professor in the School of Computer Science, exemplifies this. She heads the organization Women@SCS, which opens doors for women across campus through networking. Noted in the press release of the book she co-authored with Jeria Quesenberry, Kicking Butt in Computer Science: Women in Computing at Carnegie Mellon University, the increase in women in STEM is attributed to “changes in culture, not curriculum.” 
This change in culture breaks from the popular misconception in academia “that you need to change the curriculum to suit women … based on the idea that men and women relate to computer science differently.”
Diversity in all forms is crucial. Engineering requires different perspectives, opinions, and thinking to solve problems, according to Dean of the College of Engineering Jim Garrett. 
It also prevents the proliferation of male-dominated work spaces in the future, which have the tendency to turn misogynistic.
The future of women in STEM has never been more promising. 
Thanks to changes taking place right here at Carnegie Mellon, we can confidently assert women will have a larger role to play in the technological revolution that is the twenty-first century. 
With fewer women employed in STEM roles today as compared to numbers two decades ago, Carnegie Mellon’s Class of 2020 is a step back in the right direction.

At first glance, the words “soccer” and “science,” or “soccer” and “biology,” seem to have little in common. 
But for soccer teammates and biology majors Samantha Smith, Haili Adams, and Nicole Winegardner, a senior and two juniors respectively, the skills learned when playing on Carnegie Mellon’s women’s varsity soccer team help develop the skills required when working in Professor Jonathan Minden’s biology lab.
Teamwork is a skill critical on the field and in the lab, where the athletes work within a 12-person “Proteomics Platoon,” whose main goal is analyzing various protein changes, which can be applied in research on cancer and other chronic diseases. 
The research team uses two-dimensional gel electrophoresis and fluorescent coloring to detect minute differences in various kinds of proteins, and these differences could help people pinpoint properties that could signify disease. This method works by applying electricity to move the negatively-charged proteins or other molecules through the gel medium, and this separates out the molecules by size because shorter and smaller molecules move through the porous medium faster. 
In the case of the Proteomics Platoon’s research, the proteins of different cell extracts are first color-coded using fluorescent chemistry, then mixed and run through the gel medium. 
Proteins found in both samples would appear yellow while proteins in only one of the extracts would appear as red or green. 
This method has been used to detect protein changes in areas ranging from fruit fly embryo development to yeasts and cancer cells. Experiments frequently take a while to finish, which makes collaboration all the more essential — and for Smith, that’s where being together on the same soccer team helps.
“Being on the same team on the field makes our relationship off the field so much stronger,” said Smith in an interview with The Tartan.
To her, seeing Adams and Windegardner, who joined Professor Minden’s lab at her recommendation, following her footsteps in the lab and supplementing their academic work in biology by doing real-world research is an incredibly rewarding experience. Communication is an essential skill too, because ideas must flow around in order for research to run smoothly.
Besides teamwork and friendship, these three young women have benefited in other ways through the combination of research and soccer.
“We don’t have a lot of time during the day to waste, so when we get to running an experiment we want to be as efficient as possible,” Smith said.
Time management is crucial to ensuring that they can juggle classes, homework, soccer, and research all at once.
Another critical skill these young ladies take away from research is persistence.
“We need to be able to work through a lot of different problems and troubleshooting to achieve our goal in biology, so continuously trying different approaches is necessary,” Smith said. 
The presence of difficulties is certain, but how a person handles it holds the key to success or failure.
But to Smith, the most important skill she has learned from her experience doing research at Carnegie Mellon is curiosity.
“It is hard to ask questions because you don’t want to sound uninformed or feel insecure about whether your questions are ridiculous,” she said, but learning how to be inquisitive pays off because it opens one’s eyes to new perspectives in research. 
Smith says she is grateful to be part of the lab, and would “100 percent recommend” it to younger students to look for research opportunities, whether they are in athletics or not, because she “personally believes that there is a lot to gain from doing field work outside of the classroom.”

What do the James Bond series, the Star Trek franchise, and even movies like Minority Report all have in common? They all show biometric authentication.
Biometric authentication is a method of security that is used to verify an authorized user’s identity using their physical features, such as thumb prints, retinal images, iris patterns and voice and speech patterns.
It is a commonly known fact that every human has unique fingerprints and handprints. However, people can also be uniquely identified based on the patterns of their retina, which is not be confused with iris-recognition.
Iris-recognition  to uses pictures of the patterns in the colored regions of the eye called the iris, while retinal patterns are basically the patterns of the blood vessels in the retina. 
Since these blood vessels absorb light much better than the surrounding cells, they can be identified by measuring the light reflected back after appropriately shining light on the retina.
The procedure consists of shining a low-energy infrared light into the person’s eye and interpreting the received light as a digitized pattern. Then, the digitized pattern is compared to a patterns stored in the database to identify the person.
However, measurement accuracy can be affected by astigmatism, cataracts and glaucoma. 
Compared to fingerprint scanning, retinal patterns can change, even if they don’t change as often. In addition, retinal patterns cannot be altered intentionally, unlike fingerprints, which can be messed around with by burns, cuts, wounds, and sometimes even body lotion.
Retinal patterns differ in identical twins, much like fingerprints. Since neither of these characteristics are genetically determined, even identical twins who share their genetic make-up won’t break the retinal scanner.
Retinal scans are believed to be the second most secure biometric authentication method after DNA testing. As reported by the National Center for State Courts, they have a reported failure rate of one in 10 million.
Despite their high accuracy rates, retinal scanners aren’t used very widely and are relatively obscure. This is due to the fact that the retinal scanning equipment is often very sophisticated and expensive, costing anywhere from $200 to $4000.
Furthermore, retinal scans often feel ‘invasive’ to people. One reason for this could be because the preliminary scan to add someone to a database can take a long time due to the multiple images that need to be taken. Also, depending on the sophistication of the system, the retinal scan confirmation could take varying times.
A common trope, as shown in movies, to beat retinal scanners is to remove a person’s eyeball and then use that to gain unauthorized access. 
However, physiologically speaking, an eyeball, when removed from its socket and from the human body, immediately changes shape. 
If the shape of the eyeball changes, then the retinal patterns also change. Therefore, actually removing the eyeball from someone’s socket is not the best way to bypass a retinal scan based security system. 
A better way would be to take a picture of their retina, and then replicate the retina in a suitable model to bypass the biometric security system.
Retinal scan authentication systems are currently used by several government agencies, such as the FBI, CIA, and NASA. 
With enough funding and preparation, retinal scanners can become the norm for security systems, helping to make our homes and work places more secure.

Nerve implants help paralyzed patients pedal
Michael McClellan, who became paralyzed from the hip down after a biking accident damaged his T11 vertebrae in 2009, is now undergoing a two-hour daily cycling regimen to prepare for the world’s first Cybathlon this October, an Olympics-style competition for people with bionic equipment.
In 2011, McClellan underwent surgery to implant functional electronic stimulation technology. There are 16 silicon electrodes implanted near his nerve endings, and when the central stimulator sewn into his abdomen turns the electrodes on, they supply a current of electricity to his muscles.
Ron Triolo, executive director of the Advanced Platform Technology Center at the Department of Veterans Affairs in Cleveland, said, “It’s about triggering the right muscles in the right sequence to generate a pedaling motion in the paralyzed rider. It’s very simple for the user, but very complicated in a way that’s hidden in the technology.”

Universal flu vaccine designed by scientists
An international team of scientists has developed a vaccine that can combat up to 88 percent of known flu strains worldwide. The team spanned across the universities of Lancaster, Aston, and Complutense in Madrid.
The scientists have also developed a vaccine specific to the United States that combats 95 percent of known strains specific to the country. The vaccines contain epitopes, short flu virus fragments that our immune system already recognizes, that reach full population coverage.
“Based on our knowledge of the flu virus and the human immune system, we can use computers to design the components of a vaccine that gives much broader and longer-lasting protection,” said Dr. Derek Gatherer of Lancaster University, one of the principle researchers for the project. The research was published in the journal Bioinformatics.

Rosetta spacecraft lands on comet, ending mission
The comet orbiter Rosetta has landed on comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko, ending its 26-month mission. Before it shuts down, Rosetta is equipped with a camera that will gather data and take incredibly detailed pictures of the comet.
Rosetta arrived at 67P on August 6, 2014 after spending nearly 10 years in space. Three months later, a lander Philae dropped to the comet’s surface after detaching from Rosetta. The rough landing caused Philae to rest in the shadow of a cliff, and with insufficient light to charge its battery it went to sleep.
Rosetta has made great contributions to the scientific community regarding comets, such as the discovery that comets have a much more dynamic surface than many other surfaces in the solar system and that the ratio of deuterium to hydrogen in 67P’s water is three times that on Earth.

Bumblebees react positively to water laced with sugar
Although we automatically assume bees are happy when they buzz around flowers, there is now research to back it up. In a new study, scientists shook bees up vigorously for 60 seconds and monitored their actions. The bees that were more annoyed made poorer decisions when foraging for food.
The study was lead by Clint Perry, a neuroethologist at Queen Mary University of London. In addition, the research team trained 35 bees to navigate a course with tunnels; if the tunnel was marked with a blue flower, there was sugar water at the end. If the tunnel was marked with a green flower, there was no reward.
When the tunnel became marked with a flower containing both blue and green hues, the bees that were incentivized with sugar water before were quicker to enter the tunnel. Since both groups of bees flew the same distance and speed, it was attributed to a more optimistic, positive attitude. 
The study was published in the journal Science.

Mend major injuries with 3D printed bones
Recently, researchers from Northwestern University have created “hyperelastic bone” that can be 3D printed and work just as well as real bone. The bone is a scaffold made with hydroxyapatite – a naturally occurring mineral in bone, polycaprolactone – a biocompatible polymer, and a solvent.
This mixture creates the ink that is dispensed by the printer. The idea is that a patient who had a bad break would be x-rayed and a bone scaffold could be printed in the same day. Since the ink contains compounds commonly found in labs, it would be cheap to print and scaffolds could be produced quickly.
“We’re printing flexible scaffolds that will encourage bone to grow through and around them,” said Ramille Shah, a material science engineer and co-author on the study.  So far, the researchers have used this hyperelastic bone to fuse two vertebrae in rats and to repair a macaque monkey’s damaged skull.

Tree frog species has entered extinction
The world’s last Rabbs’ fringe-limbed tree frog, Toughie, recently passed away at the Atlanta Botanical Garden. He was collected in 2005 when he was an adult, so he was at least 12 years old.
The Atlanta Botanical Garden and Zoo Atlanta collected Toughie in a mission to rescue tree frogs when the deadly chytrid fungus closed in on central Panama. This death sends the species Ecnomiohyla rabborum into extinction. 
“A lot of attention had been paid to him in captivity, so he even has his own Wikipedia page,” said Mark Mandica, head of the Amphibian Foundation.  
“But there are plenty of other species out there that are disappearing, sometimes before we even knew that they were there,” Mandica said.

Dear Sarah,
Carnegie Mellon is such a mixed bag. You never know what you're going to get when you set foot on campus each day. Perhaps you'll run into two people in a camel suit to celebrate hump day, or maybe a bike will nearly run you over, or someone will even offer you a free condom.
These distractions are tolerable. They keep me on my toes or make me laugh. They are a familiar part of my daily campus experience, a small detail in my journey that reminds me that I'm at Carnegie Mellon, and I'm happy about that.
But one part of the Carnegie Mellon experience that I can't get behind is the bagpipes. Last week some guy held the entire Cut hostage with Scotland the Brave and pop culture covers like the Game of Thrones theme. While I respect the bagpiper and his hustle, he was basically the most annoying thing I encountered that day. All the way from my classroom in Baker, I could hear the horrific screech of the bagpipe. How am I supposed to focus on the nuances of Proust's seminal work when it sounds like a cow is having its tail hairs ripped out, one by one?
I'm all for tradition and the unity that having school pride will bring, but why does it have to be in the form of plaid skirts and terrible music? Why can't we embrace single malt whisky and haggis with as much fervor? I think most students would agree, these are much easier to get excited about.
Begrudingly,
Bummed About Guy Playing Offensive Overtures Proudly
Dear BAGPOOP,
Carnegie Mellon is a place full of unsuspected surprises. It can be a challenging environment, far beyond the reach of your influence. News flash: you're just one person and you have no power to change anything, let alone 100 years of Carnegie Mellon tradition.
But I like your suggestion that we embrace Scotch and haggis. Heck, even throw in some quality smoked salmon. But lets not forget the Scotch though.
My advice to you is to blaze this new trail. Lead by example. If you walk around with scotch in your water bottle all day, I can pretty much guarantee that bagpipe music will stop making you want to to shove pencils into your ear drums. In fact, it might even make you want to get up and dance.
If you set this tremendous new example, I'm sure the ranks of Tartans around you will follow suit and finally we can stop being so uptight as a student body. We're sure to embrace the fun that we can have by living life like Ron Swanson.
Scotch is without debate the best thing to come from Scottish culture. By living it up, you're basically doing Andrew Carnegie a favor. He would want you to celebrate Scotland in the most exciting possible way. It's a gift to his legacy.
But don't forget to drink water.
Happy drinking,
Sarah

°“Queens! Queens!” was the call-and-response cry heard a multitude of times from the Helen Wayne Rauh Theater in Purnell last Thursday night. Drama Queens!, organized by Wendy Arons, professor of dramatic literature, and Kristina Straub, professor in the Department of English, through the Center for Arts and Society here at Carnegie Mellon, was a gathering of six world-renowned performance artists. Beautifully emceed by Sara Lyons, a directing masters student, the show was a series of twenty minute segments in which each artist performed whatever they wanted to — from a future funeral, to a Boston sports bar, to a 17th century nun.
Erin Markey, a performance artist, comedian, writer, and composer based out of New York, was the first of the Drama Queens to perform. Markey entered the stage in daisy dukes, tweety bird leggings, and a shirt covered in drawings of designer purses. She told us that she had always wanted to sing a very specific song in front of a huge crowd with a full orchestra behind her and passed around a clipboard with a ‘legally binding’ document for all of us to sign that would require all of us to plan her funeral. 
We had a dress rehearsal of her future funeral, including such highlights as a volunteered ‘friend of the dead’ overcoming Markey’s rigor mortis to prop her up and puppet her jaw to mouth along with a practice orchestra and her pre-recorded vocals. Once we had finished practicing, Markey sang her beloved song, a truly moving club jam that told the story of a baby named Secret who was very tragically born without labia. Markey’s dry, absurdist humor was the perfect way to start an evening of challenging conventions. 
Holly Hughes, the second act, is a writer and performer who currently teaches at the University of Michigan. Hughes is know for her plentiful portfolio of work, as well as being one of the NEA Four, a group of four performance artists who were denied funding by the National Endowment for the Arts in the 90’s for ‘obscenity’ of subject matter.
Hughes spent her twenty minutes talking about her time with the Women’s One World (WOW) Café, a feminist theatre space in New York City that was a central part of the mid-80’s avant garde theater and performance art scene in the East Village. Hughes talked about her experience as an — as she says — ‘accidental’ founding member of WOW. Hughes spun a colorful and articulate story of her part in the culture of queer, feminist art. Punctuated with photographs and flyers from the original years of WOW, Hughes’ talk gave an intimately personal look into the history of counter-cultural performance art and celebrated the success of a pivotal group in the queer, feminist movement.
The third queen to perform, Desiree Burch, is a London-based writer, actress, artist, and comedian. For this event, Burch performed a section of her full-length solo show Tar Baby, a ‘carnival of capitalism and race — where no one’s a winner but everyone’s still playing!’ This segment of Tar Baby focused on two anecdotes adapted from Burch’s life. 
The first of these was an audition for an NYU student film where the audition table full of hipsters asked her to perform a single line with just about every euphemism they could think of until she realized they wanted her to perform it ‘more black’. Burch then performed that line — a simple ‘Hold the elevator!’ — in an uncomfortably hilarious stereotype of every one-dimensional black character to ever grace a film screen.
The second anecdote was about Bruch’s experience growing up as the only black girl in her suburban California town, and the anger and frustration that led her to create a racist caricature of herself. Burch’s explanation of the fact that her greatest moments of power and popularity came when performing this minstrel show version of herself, and how much she hated herself for no being able to let it go was touching and thought-provoking in a way that bordered on prompting guilt. Bruch’s performance was incredibly challenging, especially for an audience unused to such explicit talks about race, but was very well handed.
Deb Margolin, a playwright, actor, and founding member for Split Britches Theatre Company came fourth in the evening’s structure. Margolin is currently an Associate Professor at Yale University, and has authored ten full-length solo performances, one of which she began to perform for us at that night.
After giving her watch to an audience member and telling them to stop her when her time was up, Margolin performed the beginning of her play 8 Stops. The play, as Margolin puts it, is a comedy about the ways in which we answer each other’s narratives, and ‘the grief of endless compassion’. She talks about a young boy she met on a bus, her son’s obsession with the possibility of an endless death, and her battle with Hodgkin’s Lymphoma. 
In twenty minutes, Margolin made her audience laugh, groan, and verge on crying. Her erratic energy gave a possibly dark subject the layer of levity and humor it needed to keep the audience engaged over an hour into the show, and her understanding of her story lent her the gravity needed to tackle a heavy subject without seeming frivolous.
Becca Blackwell is a trans actor, performer, and writer living in New York City, and was the fifth performer that night. Like much of Blackwell’s work, their solo show They, Themself and Schmerm exploded our societal ideas of personhood and our relationships to our physical bodies. Blackwell’s stand-up styled performance began with a few stories about their experience growing up, and then shifted to a longer story about one of their more absurd experiences as an adult at the ‘least likely to hurt us looking’ sports bar in Boston. Blackwell joked about their first foray into differences between men and women’s bathrooms and the etiquette (or lack thereof) required in each.
Blackwell’s performance was a riotous, high-energy smashing of the gender binary. A solid presence on stage, Blackwell brought a physicality to their performance that recreated mess, bizarre, and strange situations in a hilarious way.
The sixth and final performer, Carmelita Tropicana, has been performing in New York’s arts scene since the 1980s. When she walked on stage the first thing to come out of her mouth was a rapid-fire back-and-forth between English and Spanish telling us about her plan to ‘channel the spirit’ of Sor Juana Inés de la Cruz, a poetess nun from 17th century Mexico. Dressed in the ever-so-traditional garb of 17th century nuns (black and white latex) Carmelita Tropicana read two of Sor Juana Inés de la Cruz’s poems — ‘Inés, cuando te riñen por bellaca’ (‘Inez, When Someone Tells You You’re A Bitch’) and ‘Con el dolor de la mortal herida’ (‘Love Opens a Mortal Wound’). 
Carmelita Tropicana high-energy poetry readings were the perfect way to end the night. She was a captivating presence on stage, and held the audience’s attention even when she was speaking in a language not everyone understood. 
Drama Queens! was a truly once in a lifetime event that we were luck to have on campus. All six of these artist had never preformed together, and likely won’t ever again, and though each of them had only twenty minutes, they all said something thought-provoking and unique in a true experience of a show.

I'm waiting patiently in line at Starbucks on the corner of Forbes and Craig. The line wraps around the small island and out the door. Students are sitting shoulder to shoulder at tiny tables. I'm wedged in between chairs and a cooler of $4 water and over-priced salads. I try to turn and adjust my footing, but my backpack slams into an over-the-top display of imported coffee and a cardboard cutout of Oprah. My jeans rub against the hand-written chalkboard menu. I'm starting to get a little frustrated. I scan the menu and think the same thought I have thought many times before, "Am I really going to wait 30 minutes just to pay $6 for an average tasting coffee so that they can inevitably spell my name wrong on the cup?" I'm sure you already know the answer. I waited.
I have to admit, I get a little excited for the fall drinks menu at Starbucks. I'm usually strong enough to walk away from your day-to-day hazelnut macchiato, but there's something about those very pretentious-sounding seasonal drinks that rope me in every time. I come running time and time again, spending money I don't have, to get my hands on the trendiest fall drinks.
The fall drinks offer up some different items than those on the summer menu. My personal favorite is the Salted Caramel Latte. This drink is arguably the best idea Starbucks has ever had, considering they charge more just to add salt to the previously-existing caramel latte. I won't lie. It's good. Really good. But as I finish my drink I inevitably find myself thinking, "Why did I pay extra for a caramel latte with some salt in it? I could have just bought a caramel latte." I feel defeated and full of remorse. But I'll inevitably be back. I tell myself I won't. But I will be.
Easily the most talked about seasonal fall drink is the infamous Pumpkin Spiced Latte. I resisted this dangerous temptress for as long as I could. I'm proud to say that I had never tried a pumpkin spice latte of any kind, until the fall of last year. I've since then had several from various locations. Starbucks' rendition is no lesser or greater than any other. So what factors of the iconic PSLs have made it a true symbol of fall? Is it the beverage's perfect pairing alongside a grey Northface and Uggs for a trendy Instagram photo? Is it just the bougie feeling you get when you say you're drinking a Starbucks Pumpkin Spice Latte? One thing is for sure: No pumpkin-flavored item will ever truly fill the void in my heart left by the absence of pumpkin pie. But I'll probably get one this fall, hate myself for it, tell people it's a cappuccino when they ask, and drink my latte in shame. 
Starbucks is adding a brand new fall drink to their seasonal menu, the Chile Mocha. I haven't had the time to try this bad boy out for myself. But what I've learned as a Starbucks customer is that the Chile Mocha will be good but $2 too expensive. 
I'd love to sit here firm in my resolve and tell you I won't post Snapchat stories of myself drinking lattes this fall, or that I won't buy the Gingerbread Latte the moment I get word that it's arrived. It'd be great if I could tell you these things, but I can't. I'll most likely have had a latte by the time you've read this. And I'll definitely post at least one tweet about how great the Peppermint Mocha is (but seriously though, it is really good).

From five thousand kids and more there rose a lusty yell;
It rumbled through the river, it rattled in the dell;
But the kids came downtown not to watch McCutchen hit the ball;
For the Wiggles, mighty Wiggles, were advancing to the hall.
The Australian children’s band drew throngs of excited children and their parents to the Wiggle Town tour’s stop at Byham Theater on Sept. 27. Children trailed by their families trickled under the flashing marquee and through the glass doors. Some rode on their parents’ shoulders and some excitedly skipped down Sixth St., thrilled to see their favorite band in person. Their parents, rather than the beleaguered faces I assumed would line the theater, seemed just as excited to see their kids watch the Wiggles as the kids were. The Byham Theater, which rose in place of a famed vaudeville theater, was set to be the new home of many family memories.
There was an atmosphere of such anticipation as families began to arrive. The temperature began to drop as the wind blew off the Allegheny River and many of the children coming through the door had been whisked from an afternoon nap. They needed the energy to match their excitement for the show. For many of the children, maybe even most of them, it was the first show they ever saw. Some hadn’t fully woken up when we went to ask them questions, but as they did, they became more eager to tell us their favorite Wiggle or their favorite song. Their parents joyfully helped them along, trying to simplify our questions — I’m not very good at talking to children — and seemed to revel in the whole experience.
One woman stood near the door, waiting for her nieces to arrive. She had seen the Wiggles before; she took her daughter at one point. She described that show as “amazing,” and though her daughter decided she was too old for the Wiggles this time, the rest of the family certainly didn’t agree.
The continuous stream of Kodak moments never seemed to stop. A woman even walked in with a Dorothy the Dinosaur costume flanked by two miniature Wiggles on either side of her. Children’s activities are often meant to be silly, but it’s hard to remember how fun that is when you’ve cast it off as childlike and immature. I never made it inside the actual show, but just a glimpse of the people coming in was necessary to know what the night meant to them.
As more people began to come down the street it wasn’t hard to tell who would continue across the Roberto Clemente Bridge to watch the Pirates’ gasping playoff hopes finally die and who would slip into the theater. More than a few of the children were decked out in the Wiggles’ signature monochromatic turtlenecks and some had even donned face paint for the occasion. Emma Watkins, also known as Yellow Wiggle, was a particularly popular costume choice among the young fans. Maybe it’s a quirk of Pittsburgh’s sports team logos that nearly every girl mimicked Watkins’ yellow turtleneck and black skirt, but it showed the power of representation that she resonated so strongly.
And it would be a natural progression the Wiggles would strike a chord with so many girls; the story of the band begins with a young girl. The tragic origin the Wiggles can be traced to the death of founder Anthony Field’s young niece as Field was trying to gain a foothold in the music industry. The heartbreak gave him a profound sense of empathy for young children, something that would later become a thread through everything the Wiggles founder accomplished. Fields went on to study early childhood education before founding the Wiggles, who continue to donate to SIDS research and prevention.
It was there, in the vaudeville house that saw its new life as a cinema and then again as a theater, that Field’s memories of his niece saw new life in the children’s music that Field creates and again in the moments the families in attendance will never forget.
Oh somewhere in this favored land the sun is shining bright;
The band is playing somewhere, and somewhere hearts are light;
And somewhere men are laughing, and somewhere children shout;
And Tuesday night that was in Pittsburgh — the Wiggles left no doubt.

Tired of college? Sick of campus food? Want to be in a somewhat more relaxing place? Go to Craig Street!
Right across from the Carnegie Museum of Art, Craig Street is a nice place to freshen up a bit, and get just a little away from the Carnegie Mellon bubble. With restaurants and stores from all sorts of places, from Asian to Irish, Craig Street is definitely the place to go when you crave a sense of home or just want to explore a different culture.
EatUnique is one of the restaurants on Craig Street. Featured are sandwiches “hot off the grill” and the fresh salads. Every day, EatUnique also has a daily special menu, and, trust me, every single item on the specials is absolutely delicious. If you’re a vegetarian, EatUnique is a nice place to get a hot freshly made sandwich, for when you’re tired of the cold and stale salads you get on campus. The incredible food aside, EatUnique also scores on convenience for Carnegie Mellon students by allowing us to use Dinex for purchases, thereby providing a wise and guilt-free way to burn away one's extra Dinex at the end of semester. Besides the regular food, EatUnique also provides affordable and tasty catering services.
Not far away from EatUnique, and right next to Little Asia, is a cute little store called Irish Design Center. While unremarkable on the outside, Irish Design Center is incredible once you step inside. It contains a large variety of Irish goods, from knitwear to decorations to candy bars. According to the owner, the store has been on Craig Street for over 40 years now. As one of the oldest Irish stores around the place, Irish Design Center probably has anything Irish you could possibly ever need. What’s even more special is that the large majority of the products are directly imported from Ireland and Scotland, with the remaining minority made at an Irish factory in the United States. The store is a nice place to check out if you’re in the mood for any Irish-style clothes (especially knitwear), jewelry and decorations, or maybe just want to experience the culture, or even just take back a box or two of the finest Irish tea. Irish Design Center also offers a collection of Irish gifts, which are all pretty and affordable. There’s going to be a special discount for St. Patrick’s Day and a side walk sale during summer time, so be sure to drop by then!
Snowlion Import, also along the street, has arguably the most exotic facade of any place on Craig Street. Like Irish Design Center, Snowlion Import is also a store that sells imported goods. That said, Snowlion Import sells items from Nepal, Tibet and India. Having been around for over 14 years, Snowlion Import is the first Tibetan store in the Oakland area, and the store with the largest collection of Tibetan goods in Pittsburgh. The store sells all sorts of items —from artifacts, jewelry and decorations to clothes, religious and ritual items for Buddhist practitioners. You can find everything here: earnings made from meteorite, gift cards with mysterious patterns, sports-wear made of the most comfortable fabric you ever touched, pillows and books for practicing Buddhism, and small spiritual items that wish you good luck. The owner of the store, a Nepalese native, schedules several trips between the U.S. and Nepal just to select the best products to bring back from Nepal. A portion of the benefits of the store also go to underprivileged children in Nepal. Even if you're not to keen to buy anything, Snowlion Import is a great place to just walk through, to feel the calm incense, talk to the owner and learn more about the history of Nepal and Buddhism. Most of the items at Snowlion Import are relatively affordable and you can always ask for a discount. Don’t hesitate if you ever do decide you want something, because as the owner says, “get them now, since they won’t stay long.”
Top Notch Art Supply, more casually known just as the art store on Craig Street, is a great place to visit if you're an art or architecture students. The art store has everything you'd need as an art student, and if you ever want something the store doesn't stock, you can ask the owner and he will be more than happy to order it for you. Compared to the campus store, the art store in Craig Street is better stocked and, most importantly, much more affordable. With a flat 40 percent discount in the back to school season, and a regular 20-50 percent discount for VIP customers, the store is a great place to restock on art supplies, or even just drop in for a chat with the always friendly and fun staff.
Besides the above stores, Craig Street has so many more places to check out. The comic store with a large collection of books and toys, Lulu’s noodles with the tasty bubble tea, the froyo place that opens 24 hours a day, there’re so many more to try and experience.
Get outside the campus and take a short 10 minute walk with your friend to experience everything in Craig Street. It will be worth it.

Note: All information contained in this article comes from an interview the author conducted with Professor Dawn Weleski, one of the creators of Conflict Kitchen, and conflictkitchen.org.
Conflict Kitchen is a takeout restaurant and performance art piece located at the forefront of Schenley Park Plaza that serves cuisine from countries with which the United States government is in conflict. It is run by Jon Rubin and Dawn Weleski, two art professors at Carnegie Mellon University. The restaurant alters themes with respect to current geopolitical events and during each iteration there are various related events, performances, publications, and discussions related to that theme. Since its original conceptualization in 2010, Conflict Kitchen aims to increase the diversity of discussion in public spaces and engender a sense of curiosity in the Pittsburgh community about the lives of people from other countries.
Both local Pittsburgh residents, Rubin and Weleski are artists who wish to make the Pittsburgh experience unique and engaging. It is their hope to help people admit their own lack of familiarity, prevent them from inheriting preconceived notions from their family, friends, and news media, challenge their own perceptions, and understand foreign lifestyles.
Conflict Kitchen launched about six and a half years ago. It is the only restaurant in the city that has represented the cuisines of Iran, Afghanistan, Venezuela, North Korea, Palestine, and the Haudenosaunee Confederacy. Prior to that, Rubin and Weleski ran another restaurant called Waffle Shop: A Reality Show, operated by Professor Rubin’s students. Weleski notes that they discovered “food was an amazing way through which one could engage with many different kinds of people from a diverse set of backgrounds and get them together to talk about potentially sensitive topics.” In an effort to establish a restaurant that complemented the experience of Waffle Shop, while occupying the unique niche of cuisine from regions that the U.S. is in conflict with, they established Conflict Kitchen.
Each iteration takes about two years for Weleski and her team to prepare and conduct research for. They travel to other countries, interview people, cook and shop with families, and work with chefs from that country and the diaspora in the U.S. After that, they select a diverse range of viewpoints from interviews that they conducted. They print this selection of quotes on posters, or 'wrappers,' that they hand out free of charge at the restaurant, which ultimately act as storytelling devices for the Pittsburgh public.
Weleski added that Conflict Kitchen is one of the very few art projects she has experienced that is almost entirely self-sustaining, with 97 percent of its revenue collected from food sales. She explains that Conflict Kitchen serves anywhere between 250 to 400 people daily, drawing visitors from all over the world. With such a large fan base, there are others around the world developing their own versions of Conflict Kitchen.
Within the short history of Conflict Kitchen, Weleski and her partners have pivoted operationally several times over the past few years based on public response, the staff's satisfaction, and their interests as artists. She says that as a socially engaged project, they need to be able to balance between many expectations: “It’s about being able to build a level of flexibility to the art project so that we can be responsive to our interests as artists, as well as to those of the public.” From staff unionizing to a death threat against the restaurant and its staff during their Palestinian iteration in November 2015, they’ve encountered and managed many challenges along the way.
Conflict Kitchen has had a tremendous impact on the Pittsburgh community. Weleski mentions that, according to a survey conducted a year ago, most people were engaging with the information distributed by the kitchen: they took the information home, shared it with others and conducted their own research.
As for the new Haudenosaunee iteration, Weleski and her team spent two years researching in preparation for it. They were able to learn the food and culture of the Haudenosaunee people while really gaining an understanding of the culture’s opinions of various conflicts they’ve encountered, including the cultural erasure that has occurred. In fact, last year they celebrated Indigenous Peoples’ Day. Weleski explains that “First Nations people are so often fetishized and exoticized, further exacerbating the level of prejudice and misinformation about their many diverse cultures and ways of life.” This iteration at Conflict Kitchen aims to create and spread awareness of the many indigenous people that still live throughout the mainland United States with thriving culture and communities. Weleski shares that there are actually over 560 federally recognized nations and tribes of indigenous people in the U.S. Their goal is to end the cultural disregard that has prevailed by introducing the six nations of the Haudenosaunee Confederacy, a group located near the Pittsburgh area. She mentions that in the near future they also plan to potentially extend to other indigenous nations.
As for the cuisine, Weleski highly recommends the Iroquois White Corn Soup. It’s a soup that needs to be cooked for 24 hours, and is made with a specific corn that is only grown by a farm in Victor, New York. The choice of this vegetable is no coincidence: by using this type, Weleski points out that they are “not only talking about the culinary history of the Haudenosaunee, but also highlighting a local indigenous product and an example of cultural preservation and indigenous technology.” Conflict Kitchen also has plans to bring a Seneca woman from the Iroquois White Corn Project to cook the White Corn Soup. 
With the emphasis on starting conversation with and about other cultures, Conflict Kitchen continues to bring together people of different backgrounds to learn over something that connects us all: a good meal. Make sure to try out the unique foods and views of the Haudenosaunee culture and all future iterations of the restaurant.

First Lady Michelle Obama visited Pittsburgh this past Wednesday to hit the campaign trail on behalf of Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton. The event took place at the University of Pittsburgh’s Fitzgerald Field House with entry lines spanning four blocks.
The event kicked off at 2:30 p.m. with rousing speeches from several Allegheny County notables.
First came Betsy Good, the Pennsylvania Campus organizer at the University of Pittsburgh who spoke about why she joined the Clinton campaign. Good described how after the 2008 recession, when her father was laid off, “working families like [hers] deserved more.” Now, her dad will be casting his first vote ever this November for Clinton.
Providing opportunity was a common theme through the afternoon. Allegheny County Executive Rich Fitzgerald spoke about how prior to the Obama presidency, the U.S. was losing 700,000 jobs a month. In response to the President being attacked in today’s media, Fitzgerald countered, “Barack Obama has kept America great.”
Most moving, however, was Councilman DeWitt Walton’s speech, which he opened with Langston Hughes’ poem “A Dream Defers.” Walton revealed that his maternal grandfather missed being a slave by just two years, following Lincoln’s Emancipation Proclamation. The African American community was able to progress under Kennedy, Carter, and Obama, and DeWitt stated that “if we do not want a dream deferred, we must elect Hillary Clinton.”
The First Lady came onto the stage at 3:45 p.m. after an introduction from the University of Pittsburgh’s band and Saket Rajprohat, a sophomore economics major and first generation American who also joined the Clinton campaign because of Clinton’s inclusive platform towards immigrants. Immediately upon taking the stage, The First Lady was met with loud applause from the audience attempting to document the moment. The elegance and confidence of the First Lady was apparent from just one look at the podium.
Michelle Obama began her speech by talking about the bittersweet transition out of the White House. There is “lots of uncertainty,” she said, a sentiment shared by most Americans. Throughout her speech, Michelle Obama never outright mentioned Clinton’s opponent Donald Trump by name, but very openly alluded to him several times. Both the President and Trump have publicly expressed disapproval of each other in the past. Michelle Obama spoke of “those who dared to question whether [her] husband was from the United States of America,” and tried very hard to “undermine [her] husband’s presidency.” She quoted her husband’s famous phrase, “I will go high when they take a low,” bringing cheers and applause from the crowd.
Like most opponents of Trump, Michelle Obama then commented on his demeanor in the public eye. She called out his often brash outbursts saying “we need a grownup in the White House” and “someone who will take the job seriously.” Such a critique is warranted to an extent, given that the president is under “the harshest light there really is.” Candidates must be able to hold their composure under pressure, because after all, the presidency is reserved for those who can make decisions under severe stress.
The rally then shifted to Hillary Clinton’s attributes. Michelle Obama pointed out Clinton’s extensive experience, her character and commitment to the country, her advocacy for kids with disabilities and quality childcare. And though she did not win the nomination in 2008, her approval rating skyrocketed as Secretary of State. As a testament to her stamina, Michelle Obama stated that Clinton “gets right back up” in the face of adversity. She also noted that only Clinton alone has visited 112 countries, negotiated a ceasefire and a peace agreement, and spent 11 hours testifying before Congressional Committees.
Commenting on the public’s vocal criticism of Hillary Clinton, The First Lady refuted, “when I hear folks saying they don’t feel inspired, I have to disagree.” Clinton’s persistence and consistency have been key points in the 2016 election. “No one in our lifetime has ever had as much experience and exposure to the presidency; no one, not Barack, not Bill, nobody, and yes, she just happens to be a woman” observed Michelle Obama as the crowd absolutely erupted in cheers. At the end of the day, experience, preparation, and temperament matter when electing our Commander in Chief.
This opportunity to vote for Clinton, as opposed to the alternative, rests primarily on whether someone can handle the opportunity to lead this country. Michelle Obama advised undecided voters to ask themselves which candidate is honestly the most qualified and speaks to the values we as Americans share. Like the common theme in the opening speeches, the First Lady also brought up the values of “inclusion, opportunity, and sacrifice.”
Finally, Michelle Obama noted that this election is not just about who votes, but who does not vote. In 2012, voters under the age of 30 provided a margin of victory for President Obama in 14 states. This year, like all elections, every vote matters. Michelle Obama revealed that “in 2012 Barack won Pennsylvania just by 300,000 votes.” This may seem like a lot, but it is only a difference of 17 percent of votes per precinct. So, if you are on the fence and questioning whether your vote matters, keep in mind that most elections are very close, and every vote counts.

When we think of standing up for what we believe in, it may seem counterintuitive to do so by instead taking a knee. However, that’s exactly what Colin Kaepernick, San Francisco 49ers quarterback, began doing on Sept. 1 when he kneeled during the national anthem to protest recent police brutality cases against unarmed black citizens. This bold move only added fuel to the ongoing cultural debate surrounding race relations, law enforcement, and the Black Lives Matter movement.
In this context, Carnegie Mellon students gathered on Sept. 27 for the inaugural event of the monthly campus discussion series, “State of the University,” to hold a conversation about “Colin Kaepernick, #BLM and how it all affects our campus.” Sarah Duncan, event organizer and Carnegie Mellon community adviser, explained that her goal with the series “is to have it really be an exchange of perspectives between undergraduates, grad students, staff, faculty and whoever else would want to be involved.” The event revolved around five chairs at the front of the lecture hall, which attendees joined and left at will. This provided a constantly rotating cast of perspectives on the night’s topic, “why take a knee?”
At first, debate ensued over the titular subject: Kaepernick’s protest, its meaning, and why it was immediately met with such visceral backlash. Students, faculty, and staff in attendance agreed on Kaepernick’s right to peaceful dissent, but individuals’ reasons for supporting this right varied widely.
Some empathized with the idea that challenging the injustices minorities face on a daily basis doesn’t make one less of an American. Others saw taking a knee during the national anthem as an assertion of citizens’ rights to freedom of speech. One student asserted that, “[Kaepernick] doesn’t have to show respect for his country if his country’s not respecting him,” a statement that resonated strongly with the audience.
Furthermore, many who spoke felt that criticizing the appropriateness of the protest’s timing unfairly ignored the gravity of Kaepernick’s message. This shifted the group’s focus to the difficulties of spreading awareness about Black Lives Matter at Carnegie Mellon specifically, including instances such as students reacting negatively to posts on the Facebook group “Overheard at Carnegie Mellon” or painting the Fence. Duncan noted that this was, “such an important shift” in the conversation that “really gave people an opportunity to speak about things that had been on their mind for a long time.”
Eventually, this discussion began to focus on the black and African American communities’ lack of representation on campus. Indeed, the majority of the hands in the room were raised when one member of the University community asked frankly, “How many [people] are wondering why we have such low numbers of black and African American professors?” This query was quickly raised in relation to the Carnegie Mellon student body as well, and many speakers expressed that efforts to expand the black community would help foster much-needed discourse about these issues campus-wide.
However, speakers suggested that students’ unawareness of social justice issues ultimately stemmed from an intense focus on career-oriented goals instead of a desire to be active in a broader community. As Duncan said, “It’s so easy for us as an institution to focus on academics, but sometimes it’s important to take some time to reflect and talk about something else important.”
Several steps to combat these problems were suggested, including offering a Black Lives Matter class or designating a forum specifically to talk about related issues campus-wide. To promote some of this much-needed discourse about social justice, Duncan hopes that the “State of the University” series “will grow a bit more and include even more diversity, so we can all learn something new at each discussion.” The night’s consensus was that Carnegie Mellon students, faculty, and staff may not be able to take a knee, but they can definitely take a seat and start engaging in this conversation.

Students gathered in classrooms, auditoriums, and dormitories, with Bingo cards and laptops in hand on the night of Sept. 26 in preparation for the first Presidential debate between Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton and Republican nominee Donald Trump.
The event resembled a party. In Stever’s TV lounge, around 70 students watched the debate.
“Everyone’s really excited. It’s like a man landing on a moon. You don’t know what happens next,” Jeffrey Zhang, a first-year in Carnegie Institute of Technology, said before the debate started.
From the start, students broke out in bursts of laughter at the sight of Trump’s dead expression while Clinton was delivering her opening remarks. Students whooped and snickered throughout the debate, especially when Trump spoke.
“Most people are here just to see what’s actually going to be talked about and how funny it is because of who the candidates are,” Akash Bansal, a first-year in Carnegie Institute of Technology, said.
Senior Economics major Michael Rosenberg watched the debate for a different reason. “I thought it would be useful to at least look on the sidelines and watch America’s traditionally resilient institutions just fall apart in front of my eyes,” he said.
At first, Trump started off with a simple message of fiscal conservatism. But, as the night wore on, his reactions to Clinton’s statements about him as well as interruptions of both Clinton and the moderator Lester Holt, quickly grew more and more exaggerated.
“When the moderator says, ‘we don’t have time,’ he says, ‘no, I’m talking’ and then he just doesn’t shut up,” Sonia Berg, an electrical and computer engineering major, said.
“I am concerned that people might have just watched the first 30 minutes and thought that Trump did a better job than I would say he did overall,” said graduate student Daniel Bork.
At first, Clinton attempted to be very aggressive in attacking Trump by using his past statements against him. Soon, though, she responded to Trump’s hyperboles simply by shaking her head and smiling, snidely expressing the absurdity of Trump’s statements.
On her own policy matters, though, student reactions indicated that Clinton wasn’t particularly memorable. In fact, when Clinton spoke, many students’ heads turned back towards laptops and homework until she criticized Trump in some humorous way.
“She didn’t close the deal,” said former Chief of Staff for House Speaker John Boehner Barry Jackson at Carnegie Mellon the day after the debate.
Even so, students felt entertained. “This is a hilarious circus of sorts,” alumnus Kevin Levin said.
In Rashid Auditorium in Gates Center, many of the 20 people had a bingo card, with each box containing a topic or a “Trumpism” — a bizarre Trump statement that he repeatedly says — that one crosses out if it is mentioned in the debate. Students facetiously filled it out, eagerly waiting for each term to be said out loud.
Comical as the debate may have been, it also raised serious concerns among students. “The fact that the debate is happening is a reminder to me that America is declining. The fact that we can have people with such snake oil trying to speak as though he’s a rational actor upsets me. And it’s a reminder to me that no one of good thoughtfulness, positive leadership qualities goes into politics anymore,” said Rosenberg.
Berg followed PolitiFact’s Twitter feed while watching the debate. PolitiFact judges whether or not a candidate’s statements are true. “Watching people fact-check stuff was hysterical,” Berg said. Both candidates made a surprising number of false claims, although Trump was certainly more guilty of saying untrue statements than Clinton was.
Clinton was declared by many to be the winner of the debate and, in national polling after the debate, she held on average a four-point lead, up from her one-to-two point lead before, according to the website FiveThirtyEight. While the debate largely is a boon for Clinton’s hopes of becoming resident, the mockery it became reflects poorly on the state of American politics.
Rosenberg, who will graduate after this year, expressed a concern shared by other students, when he said of this debate, “It doesn’t bode well for my future.”

Some people find it difficult to balance work and exercise, but Sue Lipman wasn’t one of those people.
Lipman was a dedicated athlete and social worker for the Children’s Hospital of Pittsburgh. After losing her battle with cancer in 2010, Lipman’s family founded sue’s run4kids as a way to honor Lipman’s memory and her work.
“My mom had a way of making everyone feel welcome and included,” Sue’s daughter and race director Jill Lipman Beck said in a press release. “She believed in having fun while doing good. We’ve taken these values and turned them into a fun, vibrant event.”
On Oct. 9 at 8:30 a.m., sue’s run4kids will be taking place in Schenley Park. The event includes a 4-mile race, a 1-mile race for kids, and 2-mile and 1-mile fun runs. There will be a pre-race and post-race party at the Vietnam Veterans Pavilion that will have free food and drinks from Bruegger’s Bagels, Eat ‘n Park, and Smallman Street Deli. All money raised from the run will go to the KidsVoice’s Lipman Youth Fund, which works with programs that aid teens in foster care.
“The Lipman Youth Fund enables KidsVoice to provide special projects and programs designed to help teenagers in the foster care system access assistance and resources to enable them to successfully transition to independence and adulthood outside of the child welfare system,” Beck said. “This is an extremely vulnerable, but often overlooked population. Sue’s run is the only fundraiser for the Lipman Youth Fund, so we want to grow the event so that we can grow the fund and help more kids achieve success and independence.”
KidsVoice, the larger organization that the Lipman Youth fund donates to, is extremely involved in Allegheny County. According to their website, KidsVoice helps almost 3,000 children in the child-welfare system of the County’s Juvenile Court system.
This organization’s staff is unique in that their goal, according to their website, is to focus on “the kids’ educational, medical, mental health and social security matters as well as providing representation for minor criminal citations and for expungement of delinquency records.” They also help older clients with applying to college and jobs as the prepare to live on their own.
Since December 2008, the Lipman Youth Fund at KidsVoice has helped the organization update its website to include more information about the important work KidsVoice is a part of. Additionally, the fund has helped establish the Clean Slate program. This makes sure that children facing minor legal charges are supported by a reliable adult when they are dealing with an officer or judge and their parents cannot satisfy that adult role. Also, this fund is helping the Independent Living Resources Fairs, whose goal is to help teenagers in foster care with finding programs that will help them to eventually live independently. The organization truly coincides with how Lipman wanted to impact the community.
“Sue was an incredible person,” Sue’s husband Rod Lipman said in a press release. “Although she spent her career helping young children, she also mentored a number of teens and young adults, helping them to find a path to success. The goal is for the Lipman Youth Fund to do that for kids who are aging out of the foster care system - put them on their own paths to success.”
If college students are interested in helping out with the event, there are many possible ways that they can get involved.
“They can register to run or walk in one of the events (www.suesrun4kids.org),” Beck said. “They can volunteer to help pack our awesome race bags, which we do the weekend before the race. They can even hold a fundraiser and raise money for sue’s run and the Lipman Youth Fund.”

Most students on campus could guess that the Hunt Library was funded through a donation of someone who’s last name was Hunt. Lesser known among the student body is the history behind the Hunt family and most importantly, Rachel McMasters Miller Hunt. Throughout her lifetime residing on Ellsworth Avenue in Shadyside, Rachel acquired an array of artifacts reflecting her fascination with the botanical world. By the 1950’s, the collection was well known in the academic world, and Rachel came to publish the Catalogue of Botanical Books in the Collection of Rachel McMasters Miller Hunt.
In an attempt to preserve this legacy close to its home, the Hunt family generously donated Rachel’s collection to Carnegie Tech, accompanied by a building to house both the collection and a library. For those who are unaware of the mysterious fifth floor of Hunt library, currently known as the Hunt Botanical Institute, this is where Rachel Hunt’s botanical collection can be found.
Since 1964, the institute has been working to preserve and foster further growth of the botanical arts by displaying an international exhibit. The exhibit brings together the botanical community from across the world, including the Botanical Society, which hosts a conference at the institute during the international exhibition. Currently, the 15th International Exhibition is on display.
When the exhibition first began, the world of botanical art existed with many more restraints than it does now. In 1964, the institute only accepted art that had been published. Considering the fact that many fine artists do not seek out having their art published in scientific journals or texts, this excluded a lot of talent from the series. As perspectives have become more accepting of the notion that botanical art is equally as artistic as other forms of fine art, the institute has grown to accept submissions from a wide array of artists.
The selection process is conducted by Curator of Art and Senior Research Scholar, Lugene Bruno and Assistant Curator of Art, Carrie Roy. It’s an extensive process that takes place over a two-year period, and its outcome reflects one of the most diverse and talented collection of botanical art ever. According to the Hunt Institute’s website, “Collectively, the catalogues are the most comprehensive record available of 20th–21st-century botanical artists and illustrators — the number of individuals represented now totals 1,129.”
The selection process begins with open submission of works from anyone. Some of the artists have never been heard of by the curators, while others have been, and others come recommended. Some of the art also comes from artists that Bruno and Roy have watched evolve throughout their careers, who are then asked to submit their art to be featured in the international exhibit. Roy mentioned that because an artist can only be featured in the international exhibit once, it’s important to pick the artists that they think are most ready, to avoid having someone display their work before the peak of their career.
Each artist digitally submits what they believe to be their top three pieces. Bruno and Roy select artists that will be featured in the exhibit and narrow it down from the three pieces they’ve submitted to the one that they would be most interested in seeing for the exhibit. Once it’s been decided which pieces are best for the exhibit, the artists send in the physical piece for a final approval. In preparing for the exhibit, all of the photography of the art and graphic design for the series is done in house, which takes a lot of attention to detail to achieve a quality outcome.
This year’s exhibition includes art from 15 different countries, including the U.S., England, Scotland, Ireland, France, Italy, Spain, Australia, New Zealand, South Africa, China, Japan, and South Korea. As in previous years, the submissions are heavily from the U.S. and Western Europe, but there has been a growing presence of submissions from countries in Asia as well.
The most common medium for the art is watercolor, though many artists also use colored pencils, ink, powder pastels, or powder graphite. This year, there is a lot more work featuring colored pencils.
What inspires Bruno most about the international exhibit is searching for artists that are pushing the boundaries of what is botanical art, while still showing appreciation and understanding for what the purpose of botanical art is. For example, though it is traditional for the background of the art to be white, Bruno pointed out that several pieces in this year’s international exhibit use a combination of artistic mediums, but didn’t follow the rules surrounding background. One piece resembled a photograph, with shadowing on the white background. Another implemented a desert landscape as a background, something not commonly seen in botanical art.
When asked what her favorite piece in the exhibit this year was, Roy explained that given the complexity of emotions expressed in each piece, depending on the day, one piece will stand out more than another, but she could never pick an absolute favorite. This really speaks to the beauty of botanical art, as it’s humanity’s attempt to capture the pure beauty of the organic world, something that we can relate to more deeply than the material world around us.

Carnegie Mellon hosts Family Weekend
Carnegie Mellon’s Family Weekend took place from Sept. 30 to Oct. 2. This event brought together families from all over the world to experience the culture and lifestyle here at Carnegie Mellon University. President Subra Suresh welcomed families and students on Saturday, Oct. 1 in Rangos Ballroom. Following this reception was a wide array of activities including open houses, exhibits, varsity athletic events, and student performances.
Noteworthy events included the ToBoM Demonstrations and Race, the Math & Innovation class with International Math Olympiad Champion Coach, Professor Po Shen Lo, and the Scotch‘n’Soda Cabaret. The ToBoM event took place in the Helex at the Gates Building where community members were invited to race their robots up the long, spiraling Helix. The Math & Innovation class took place in the Danforth Conference Room at the Cohon Center where Professor Po-Shen Loh discussed the innovation of math teams at Carnegie Mellon in relation to the University’s innovation and entrepreneurship. Finally, Friday night’s family weekend events ended with Carnegie Mellon’s Scotch ‘n Soda Cabaret showcasing student performers from across the colleges.
Family weekend was a unique opportunity for Carnegie Mellon families to gather and learn about the university by meeting alumni, faculty, and staff.
Faculty members attend the Andy Awards
Carnegie Mellon’s Annual Andy Award honors staff members who make a lasting impression at the university. These awards are attributed to Commitment to Excellence, Commitment to Students, Innovative and Creative Contributions, Spirit, and Teamwork and Collaboration. From writing books in Electrical Engineering to creating an independent network for the School of Computer Science, this year’s recipients worked incredibly hard to elevate Carnegie Mellon University.
Among these recipients included Christina Cowan who was awarded for her Commitment to Excellence. Cowan was nominated by the Electrical Computer Engineering Administrative Service teamfor developing a vast number of initiatives for the department. Cowan wrote a handbook based on her motto “we should all know” for coordinators to ensure they had access to all information in the department. Kevin Collins was nominated for his commitment to students. He is a career consultant in the School of Computer Science. Other recipients included Pam Wigley, who elevated the School of Drama’s community presence, Patti Steranchak, who created a welcoming environment within the Department of Engineering and Public Policy, and the Network Convergence Team, whose members developed a network-based telephony system for the School of Computer Science. The team consisted of Josh Emerson, Steve Snodgrass, Matt Nickerson, and Ronald Rack.
This year’s recipients continue the culture of progress, community, and innovation here at Carnegie Mellon University.

Editor’s Note: Dominique Escandon is the Cabinet Writer of The Student Government.
It would be unjust of Student Government leaders to pretend that current events don’t affect students’ lives on campus, regardless of the looming legacy of the Carnegie Mellon Bubble. In light of this, an official statement was posted on Vaasavi Unnava (Student Body President) and Aaron Gutierrez’s (Student Body Vice President) Facebook page as an offering of support to the members of our community who might be feeling distressed by the recent deaths of unarmed black people at the hands of the police.
When regarding matters of campus wellness, Student Government should take an active role in addressing the unique struggles each student might face during their time at Carnegie Mellon, since these challenges can’t be alleviated or resolved without being recognized first. However, we must also serve as a representative voice of our diverse community, unbiased and undeclared in political standing, in order to not stifle potential important discussions on issues or movements that could arise elsewhere on campus.
Some of the most important and relevant discussions about race relations, mental health awareness, or sexual health that I’ve engaged in at Carnegie Mellon, be it with my roommate on a Tuesday at 2 a.m. when I should have been studying (or maybe cramming is the better word), or at a casual dinner with my friends, have occurred naturally outside of the influence of Student Government. This is, in part, because we felt free to express our ideas without the weight of a superficial entity or stance placed upon us by student leaders we might have never had a conversation with.
What’s so amazing about these moments is that they indicate that our community really is invested in bettering itself and is aware of the steps it must take to accomplish its respective goals. This was heavily reflected in the most recent State of the University, organized by the Community Advisers, centered around Colin Kaepernick, #BlackLivesMatter, and how these events affect Carnegie Mellon.
Once more, it was recognized that Carnegie Mellon still has a long way to go before it can be considered a fully integrated community. Where are our professors of underrepresented minority groups? How often do we interact with campus policemen of the same, or different, race or gender than us? What is keeping our students from engaging in social discussions, or protesting for a cause they care about? Why has the discussion on Carnegie Mellon’s active role in gentrifying Pittsburgh been so sparse, despite its huge effects to our neighbors? An agreement was established: Carnegie Mellon has to do more.
The most engaging part of the State of the University was the interchange of ideas between campus administrators and students. Our faculty has incredible connections and direct experience with many of these matters and, when paired with the mass innovation of our students and the funding and organizational structure of Student Government, they can create the lasting change towards inclusion and diversity we would all love to see on campus.
So please: continue to engage in meaningful conversation about what you want Carnegie Mellon University to look like in ten years, in five years, or even tomorrow. Seek opportunities to engage with different members of our community and the Pittsburgh community at large, so we can continue to grow our understanding in how we can better ourselves.
And of course, if you ever feel like you need support along the way, you can always reach out to a Student Government Cabinet member for guidance or support.

Since the first presidential debate of 2016, the internet has been abuzz. Everyone, from media pundits to Twitter aficionados are trying to decide which candidate won the debate: business tycoon Donald Trump or former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton.
While the winner isn’t clear, the loser is; every single one of us who tuned in, hoping that bringing these two divisive candidates on the same stage would result in fascinating discussion.
Instead, there were only insults and witty comments. Entertaining, certainly, but not entirely helpful. Every single scandal that has occupied the media for weeks came up. The debate was just the same points that Trump and Clinton have been making for what seems like eternity.
At this point in the election, all of these scandals are old news. We’ve heard about Judge Gonzalo Curiel and the Khan family. We’ve heard about the comments Trump has made about women. We’ve heard about Clinton’s emails for a long time, through hearings and investigations. These aren’t new scandals that people will be weighing at home. It’s fairly likely that anyone who was going to decide how they voted based on those comments and conflicts already knew about them. Most people have already made up their minds.
Both sides have made the same points again and again. And again. And this Monday, they drove them home yet again. These aren’t bad points. When electing the person who will represent this entire nation, considering temperament and point of view and past mistakes are all important. 
These points shouldn’t be ignored. For many people, these are the issues that helped them decide their vote. But focusing so much time on them is neither necessary nor productive.
Its been many, many months since this election started. There is an unprecedented number of undecided voters right now. At this point, those undecided voters have already heard about each politician’s scandals. Those biting comments aren’t going to convince anyone of anything. The two potential leaders of this country had the chance to really talk about policy, and it just didn’t happen.
The number of witty comments you make about your opponent shouldn’t influence how we describe your performance. The next president doesn’t need to make snide remarks to world leaders. The president needs to understand policy, law, and international issues. We let politicians in these debates  command attention with these comments, and ignore actual issues.
This debate was full to the brim with buzzwords and phrases that poll well. Clinton used the ones that liberals love, like “having the wealthy pay their fair share and close the corporate loopholes,” and “strong growth, fair growth, sustained growth.” Trump focused on all his greatest hits, like bashing Mexico, making America great again, and insulting President Barack Obama.
To call what happened on Monday night a debate is, quite frankly, a stretch. It involved two people talking at or over each other. This was not discourse of ideas, but a repetition of the things that have gotten them this far. 
The same points that have made up stump speeches were regurgitated on stage, repackaged for primetime drama.
At the end of the day, many of the voters that haven’t made up their mind yet aren’t just undecided. They’re unhappy with the choices they are left with for this election. Some are struggling between voting third party or for a major party candidate. Others are wondering is voting is worth it at all. The voters that needed this debate to make up their mind weren’t give much to work with.
If the goal of this debate was to show the depth of these candidates to win over undecided voters, it didn’t happen. There simply wasn’t enough substance.
To be fair, both politicians did bring policies. They did bring up their plans for the country. But they did so in a way that was meant to be palatable, not thought-provoking.
Furthermore, the candidates weren’t the only ones bringing up old issues that garnered media attention. The moderator, Lester Holt, brought up many of them himself, including Trump’s previous questioning of the President’s citizenship.
These questions, while not unimportant, did derail from discussions about things like racial tensions in the United States. They weren’t necessary, at least not at the expense of policy talk. They certainly should not have been brought up by the moderator.
Holt also let the discussion fall apart from its structure. A segment on the Iraq war turned into a conversation about who has the better temperament. The actual issue at hand was completely forgotten. 
Perhaps more guidance would have allowed for stronger discussion. Holt’s acceptance of off-topic talking points was ultimately only a detrimental.
In the end, this was the first of three debates. We can only hope that by the next one, even the candidates will be sick of bringing up each other’s scandals relentlessly and will choose to focus on policy. 
Without concrete discussion, asking voters to change their mind is an unfair burden. 
We deserve real discourse on the future of this nation, because casting a ballot to decide that future without adequate information isn’t a choice any of us should want to make.

Editor’s note: this is part four of The Pragmatist’s Manifesto. This weekly column encourages civil discussion about politics in the U.S. Find previous installments @ thetartan.org. 
At long last, we have arrived at our current election. After discussing our two-party system with regards to history, media, and math, we can finally address the slow car crash unfolding in front of us. And for Gary Johnson and Jill Stein fans who have stuck with me this long — bear with me, I haven’t forgotten about you.
First however, we must discuss the two main party’s nominees: Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and business tycoon Donald Trump. This is the first time in history when both nominees are the most disliked candidates ever nominated by their party.
Let’s start with Clinton. As a long-serving Democrat at many levels of government, she is truthfully the most qualified person to run for president. To many, she epitomizes the party establishment.
Trump, on the other hand, is everything Clinton is not. He is a real-estate owner who has boosted his brand over the past decade with his shows like The Apprentice and buildings with his name on them. He used his outsider status to launch him over the huge GOP primary field, dominating media coverage with outrageous statements.
I would like to briefly address the idea of an outsider. Oftentimes, a portion of the electorate gets the notion that someone outside of the political realm will “shake things up” in Washington. While the sentiment of this is sound, based on the idea that anyone can become president, the last person you’d want in the Oval Office is someone who doesn’t know how to do the job.
If you were a boss hiring for a job, and someone applied from a completely different field, with no applicable skills, you would dismiss him immediately. The presidency is the most powerful, difficult job in the world. No amateurs allowed.
This brings me to my main point about this election cycle: Trump has upended the two-party balance. He has taken a major party of generally conservative opinion and molded it into his personal one-man cult of personality. While he has hijacked the presidential race, social conservatives, a minority in the party, have hijacked the party platform, turning out something similar to The Book of Revelations. The party’s many principled moderate conservatives are no longer represented. This is problematic because for the first time in many election cycles, the contest is not between two sets of values; one side is represented by a man who is not truly a Republican.
The closest anyone can come to finding a precedent for Trump’s campaign is that of George Wallace and the American Independence Party. Wallace, or Mr. Segregation as I referred to him last week, ran as a strict segregationist. His rallies drew thousands of supporters, he often encouraged violent responses to protesters, he criticized the media and political elite, and was hailed as an outsider. The similarities are striking, except that Trump has been nominated by a major party, not a protest party. This makes him even more dangerous, since his appeal is truly national and he has a chance of getting elected, whereas Wallace’s support was concentrated mostly in the South.
Many of us who watched the debate on Monday can agree that there is no comparison between our two main candidates. While Clinton has her share of campaign problems, they pale in comparison to Trump’s. She came prepared and remained fairly composed for the debate, while Trump touted his temperament through his constant interruptions and interjections. He was easily provoked and could not keep up in a policy discussion without reverting to the same, often nonsensical, talking points he has used for over a year now. It was the first time we saw these two onstage together, and Trump’s obnoxious behavior and general unpreparedness exposed yet again how unqualified he is.
Toward the end of the debate the candidates were asked whether they would honor the result of the election. Both said that they would do so, but the question had only truly been directed at Trump. He has openly questioned the validity of the election and occasionally said that it could be rigged against him. This issue transcends the partisan divide; this type of comment has dangerous implications. If history is any indication, he will probably make comments like this again in the future, despite saying he would respect the result.
Should the election be decided by a handful of states, it is within the realm of possibility that Trump would contest the election if he loses. Even if he is defeated, he will remain in the national media spotlight, perhaps preparing for his next run in four years. However, there is a solution to this potential problem.
Trump needs to be eviscerated. Completely destroyed. It cannot even be close. If Clinton wins in a landslide, he will have no justifiable reason to contest the result and his hateful, fear-mongering campaign will fade away. To accomplish this, though, Clinton will need everyone’s help. Complacency is the enemy; Trump is counting on progressives to stay home.
Now, to my conservative friends who feel abandoned by their party, I ask you for your help. If we band together and send Trump back into the abyss of reality television, perhaps we can restore some sanity to our politics. Still, some of you may be considering voting for Johnson (or for some of my friends on the left, Stein). For those who have not heard about Johnson, he is the nominee of the Libertarian Party, running a campaign that is, in a nutshell, economically conservative and socially liberal.
The Johnson campaign’s strategy is to woo voters who are equally dissatisfied with both major party candidates. This approach, called Balanced Rebellion, relies on the narrative that neither Clinton or Trump is deserving of support. This is completely misguided.
As I said earlier, Clinton has some issues, but to equate her with an ignorant, boorish, sexist, compulsive bullying liar who is also a terrible businessman, is simply incorrect. And when Trump displays his fondness for authoritarian tactics, such as encouraging violence, fanning racism and xenophobia by blaming entire groups of people or religions for complicated problems, or censoring the press, the American people need to show him that our country will not tolerate it.
Moderate conservatives, I will be perfectly honest with you. If Johnson/Weld (or maybe Weld/Johnson) were running as the GOP ticket, the Democrats would be terrified. Their ideology seeks to build a different coalition than the current Trump GOP, one that would draw voters away from the Democrats. 
Some conservatives may be unsatisfied with my suggestion, but if you can achieve a shift back to the center like the ones Democrats achieved in the 1990’s, you will be able to elect a Republican to the presidency in the future.
Johnson is by no means a perfect candidate either (e.g., Aleppo), but his ideology is the one that would allow the GOP to function as a real party again, instead of the megaphone for the religious right and the Trump family.
Now, I would be remiss if I did not mention Stein of the Green Party. I am not going to attack her or her beliefs: rather, I will tell you exactly what they are. She believes in becoming a 100 percent renewable energy country by 2030. She wants to forgive all student debt, an appealing but not particularly liberal proposal. She wants to break up the big banks, without a clear alternative to what would replace them. As a doctor, she has said that Wi-Fi is a threat to children’s health, has endorsed homeopathic remedies, and has had to walk back comments that seemed to suggest that vaccines might cause autism (they don’t). She has also never held public office.
If either the Libertarian or Green parties were particularly serious about breaking the two-party mold of our country, the presidential protest vote is not the path for them. As we have discussed, running spoiler candidates in Presidential elections has worked to hurt the overall desires of the electorate as a whole. To create a real base for another party, they would need to win local and state elections, giving them real support for being represented in Congress.
Each of these parties has its own dilemma. After this election, Libertarians should take up the cause of moving the GOP towards its ideology, making the GOP represent a more moderate (and electable) brand of conservatism. The Green Party, however, has already been mostly assimilated into the values of the Democratic Party. For all those Bernie Sanders holdouts out there considering voting for Stein, take a read through the Democratic platform. Sanders’ influence in the primary helped create the most progressive platform in history. Refusing to vote for Clinton at this point is the same as voting for Trump — don’t be the Ralph Nader voters of 2016.
To finalize our journey through my defense of the two-party system, I would like to reiterate a lesson from the Founding Fathers, who were discussed back in week one. As much as they may have disliked parties, the system they set up works best when two main parties maintain the balance of power, instituting incremental change over time. If we can join together in resisting an extreme, unpredictable demagogue, the Democrats will be happy to begin compromising again with the most-likely Republican-controlled House of Representatives.
The only conclusion regarding our election is that it is in desperate need of a decisive statement by the American people. Anything less will not solve our long-term problems. We need an election that works to put us back on the track of sanity and compromise. The two-party system has worked in the past and can work again. All we have to do now is unite behind the banner of pragmatism and prove that the United States can resist the plagues of ignorance, prejudice and hatred.

You’re exhausted. You just got done working for the day. You aren’t blessed with a desk job, your work is manual labor. The only thing that got you through today was this moment right now — waiting in line for the money you earned after a hard day. You smile as you walk up to the man, tell him your hours for the day, and watch as he drops a whopping 17 cents into the palm of your hand.
I didn’t just describe a third world country, or a western nation prior to labor laws. The exact scenario described above is an everyday reality for inmates at for-profit prisons. The United States prison system is inherently flawed, both with mass incarceration and inhumane living conditions.
With the United States representing only five percent of the world’s population, it is completely ridiculous that around 
22 percent of the total prisoners in the world are stationed in prisons within the United States. 
In fact, in some parts of the United States, there are more people in prison than in college. The United States isn’t within the top 30 countries with the highest crime index, so the mass incarceration speaks to a much larger problem with the American prison system.
About 1 in 5 incarcerated people are locked up for a drug offense, and drug offenses are most prominent in incarcerated people within federal prisons. With many Americans believing that the federal prisons house too many offenders, these statistics should be an outrage to the public. 
There are people whose only crime was a drug offense sharing a floor with murderers. The goal of prisons should be to rehabilitate members of society, not merely a punishment. But we cannot as a society expect those with minor infractions to rehabilitate properly when we clump them together with the worst, most deplorable members of society.
The United States prison system also has some interesting institutions within it, deemed for-profit prisons. Prisons are an extension of government, and “for-profit” should never be an adjective that can be reasonably used to describe a government institution or agency. But, shockingly, it is, and these institutions have some of the most inhumane conditions to be associated with a democracy. Last week, an inmate posted a video of maggots squirming around his prison food. These conditions are so barbaric that the United States’ won’t even let the United Nations properly investigate its prisons.
The for-profit prisons in the United States operate by having inmates complete tasks for private businesses, and then paying these inmates outrageously low amounts for their labor. For about six hours of work, an inmate could be paid only 17 cents. A part of the rehabilitation process reasonably could be requiring inmates to work, but they would be fairly compensated upon their release. And this work could be focused on bettering the public by having inmates work on the construction of public roadways, government buildings, public facilities, and many other options.
For-profits are a disgrace to our country. Fortunately, inmates within these prisons have begun to protest these conditions. The mass media has turned a blind eye, but these protests are continuing in prisons throughout the country. Whether these protests will be a success remains undecided, but there is hope for our prison system.
Many communities across the country have acknowledged the faults of our current prison system and are enacting changes. Cities across the country have enacted different initiatives focused on rehabilitating prison inmates. Rehabilitation has been proven in other countries to be successful at deterring crime, so it is refreshing to see that we’ve begun to take steps in the right direction.
But at the end of the day, the United States still has a large issue with mass incarceration and our prison conditions are downright embarrassing for a democracy. These prisoners are people, and deserved to be treated as such. 
Once the government and the public finally acknowledge the faults within the prison systems, we can begin to take steps that reduce crime and repeat offenders in America, and make the United States a safer place for everyone.

Moderate Republicans have been decrying Donald Trump’s nomination as not only dreadful for the nation, but also for the party in the upcoming election. While Trump’s candidacy may allow little hope for the country, there is a silver lining for the Republican Party; the dysfunction caused by its presidential candidate will improve the chances of its congressional candidates. In other words, Trump is good for his party because he is such a bad candidate.
This is because Trump will unwittingly free up funding traditionally reserved for the presidential race, giving a boost to candidates fighting elections for seats in Congress. Thus, the Republican Party will actually benefit from Trump’s inability to raise funds. Since Trump is so unpredictable, Republicans cannot feel secure knowing that he is the president, because he may not support the policies they do. They will be better off supporting congressional candidates with established beliefs and whom the party can at least somewhat control.
This is not to say that the Republican Party should surrender all hope of winning the presidency. Instead, Trump simply doesn’t need the party as much as presidential candidates have in years past. He gets a tremendous deal of media coverage simply by opening his mouth and, often, simply by promising to open his mouth. This means that Trump doesn’t need much funding for his campaign. The purpose of campaign funds, to make a candidate better known and to deride his opponent, is already accomplished by having Trump as the candidate. From immigration to trade, Trump and his views are widely known and his opponent’s misdeeds, whether it be with her email server or not doing enough to prevent the attacks in Benghazi, are well-documented.
Thus, the Republican Party can reduce spending on the presidential race without giving up on its candidate. This is fortunate, because the party may not have a choice, as more and more donors, like the Koch brothers, divert their money to congressional races — particularly Senate races. Sheldon Adelson, for example, recently donated $40 million to help Republicans in Senate elections, forgoing his earlier promise to donate $100 million to Trump’s campaign, as per a report in The New York Times. Since many current projections have the Republicans losing the Senate in November, this actually bodes well for the Republican Party.
By betting on multiple congressional races rather than frittering money away on one contest, Republicans are unwillingly making the smart decision, investing in contests influenced far more by money than presidential races are. This is because congressional candidates are generally not well-known, so advertisements can have more of an impact on voters’ thinking in these races. Moreover, the law of diminishing marginal returns suggests that since these contests see less total money, any money in the contest will be more effective. Thus, donors will see greater returns on their investments while assuming less risk, as they will have spread their money out over multiple contests. This has already been seen in the race for Senate in Ohio, where Republican Rob Portman has jumped out to a huge lead in polls over his opponent Ted Strickland thanks in large part to the increased funding he has received in this election cycle, according to The New York Times.
A Trump candidacy will therefore help the Republican Party preserve its hold on the Senate. The counter-argument goes that Trump will have a negative impact on voting down the ballot and will thus actually hurt candidates for congressional office. While Trump’s high “unfavorable” ratings — consistently over 50 percent in polling — would suggest that this would be the case, Hillary Clinton’s similarly high unfavorability ratings mean that Independents who don’t want to vote for the party of Trump also won’t want to vote for the party of Clinton, thus negating the impact of Trump’s unpopularity. The ability of a presidential candidate to impact votes in other contests may be exaggerated anyways, as the 2012 election showed that the electorate today is willing to split its ballot between the two parties.
So, with the lack of an insidious effect down the ballot and with a lesser need for funding, Trump gives the Republican Party the freedom to concentrate on congressional elections and protect its majorities in both houses of Congress. The Democratic Party, on the other hand, finds defeating Trump to be its utmost priority since it believes a Trump presidency will be unimaginably harmful to the country’s progress. This means that it will focus its funds on the presidential election in the coming months, providing a perfect opportunity for Republicans to win the close congressional contests.
That’s why another argument, that Trump will energize the Democratic base to donate more money, fails in this case, as Democrats will spend to defeat Trump, not congressional Republicans. Further, energizing the base will largely result in more small donations. Most money in congressional elections, on the other hand, comes from PACs and large donations from individuals. When the powerful Republican donors focus on Senate races while Democratic donors fixate on the presidential race, it will create a funding imbalance that will be hard to overcome for Democratic candidates.
Congress is supposed to be just as powerful as the Executive, and Republicans would be better off aiming to maintain that power in 2016, as they sort out how best to align the party’s two divergent economic interests: one populist and one demanding loose regulations and open trade. 
Focusing too much on the presidency risks making the Republican Party nearly irrelevant in the federal government till 2018 and, more seriously, splintering its base. Trump allows the party to reflect and reset for future elections while still controlling Congress. Trump has used the Republican Party to promote himself; it’s time the party used him to protect its future.

As much as we all love Pinterest and YouTube tutorials, there are some things that most people agree shouldn’t be DIY. Normally medical treatment, devices, and equipment are near the top of that list, but in the wake of extreme price hikes EpiPens seem to have fallen off the list all together. Surging EpiPen kit prices, which have spiked from around $100 in 2009 to over $600 today, have forced some people to start making their own, using materials that cost between $8 and $35. 
There has been a lot of outrage about the price hikes, with have been happening yearly since the pharmaceutical company Mylan bought the rights to the product in 2007. The latest price increase in May of this year brought the price 
from $461 to $608.61 and drew attention and criticism from the media and Congress. Using words like “sickening” and “disgusting,” the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee berated Mylan’s CEO Heather Bresch about the EpiPen’s pricing in a hearing that was surprisingly bipartisan. It turns out demonizing Big Pharma is one of the few things that can break the gridlock in Washington. But as much fun as it is to crucify big, greedy corporations, the situation is, as usual, a lot more complicated than that.
Firstly, it’s important to understand how that $608 price tag is distributed.
On the supplier end, Mylan claims to only get $274 from each sale, with the rest going to distributors and middlemen. Of that $274, only $100 is pure profit. Besides the long line of middlemen and the cost of the supply chain, pharmaceutical companies also have to invest in research and development, which is an absurdly costly yet vital portion of their business. Without robust research and development programs medicine would stagnate, and vital improvements and medicines might never be developed. Since acquiring the EpiPen in 2007, Mylan claims to have spent nearly $1 billion on research and development.
On the buyer side of the equation, the price to the consumer really depends on their individual insurance plan. Some plans cover the complete cost of the EpiPen so the consumer pays nothing, while people with no insurance or high deductible plans can end up paying the full price.
The Affordable Care Act helped dramatically decrease the number of uninsured people, hitting a record low of 8.6 percent in September, but a lot of people who were previously uninsured opted for high-deductible plans that leave them just as vulnerable to the price hikes. According to CNBC, in the first three months of this year 40 percent of nonelderly people with private health coverage were enrolled in a high-deductible plan. People who opt for high deductible plans usually do so because they cannot afford the more thorough plans with higher premiums, so the full $608 price tag hits especially hard.
Mylan has taken some steps to try and mitigate the impact of the price hikes, offering a $300 savings card for customers who have to pay the full price of the drug and announcing the release of a generic version of the EpiPen that will cost $300. However, the use of the savings card is illegal in programs such as Medicare and unavailable to the uninsured. Mylan holds a patent for the EpiPen’s release device that prevents other companies from producing pens that use the same easy-to-use device that can save lives. The new generic version will still be a Mylan product, perpetuating Mylan’s stranglehold on the EpiPen market. There is no reason to believe that the generic’s price will stay at $300 when Mylan has a monopoly.
The problem of EpiPen prices, and the countless other drugs that have the same story, is a sticky one with no easy solution. On one hand, pharmaceutical companies are, in the end, companies. They need the motivation of profit to function and keep improving. Pharmaceutical companies drop hundreds of millions of dollars on developing new drugs and equipment, and they rely on patent protections and high prices to make that investment worth it. On the other hand, this lifesaving medication is becoming unaffordable for the people who need it.
The solution seems to be increased negotiation and transparency. It’s worth noting that while EpiPens are used around the word, the United States is the only country having this problem. EpiPens in Canada still cost about $100. This discrepancy seems to exist because the Canadian government negotiates and regulates medicine price increases; something the United States government is prohibited from doing. 
While in theory allowing the free market to run should be optimal, judging by the current situation this isn’t working. The artificial monopoly created by the long patent period makes it impossible for the free market to function and set a competitive price for medicine.
It seems like the best solution would be for the government to be able to negotiate and yes maybe regulate prices while the patent is in effect. That way prices could be set at a level that would recoup pharmaceutical companies for their costs while making sure they aren’t price gouging people who desperately need the medicine. 
When the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee requested a breakdown of Mylan’s research and development costs for last year, the company was unable to oblige. While research and development are undeniably important, they shouldn’t serve as a reason to give drug companies a blank check. Ideally, this kind of information should be public record or at least available to the government so they can monitor the companies for price gouging.
Another commonly cited reason for high drug prices is the long line of middlemen between the supplier and consumer. These middlemen are mostly pharmacy benefit managers, who help market and sell the drug in exchange for a rebate from the drug company. These middlemen make for a long and complicated of people that siphon off the profits made from the sale of a medicine. To compensate for the money that gets diverted to these pharmacy benefit managers, the drug companies hike up prices. If the government was able to prevent them from taking this easy way out and raising prices, they would be forced to restructure the supply chains to be more profit efficient.
The recent EpiPen price scandal is a perfect example of how our pharmaceutical industry is broken. While there are several Band-Aid solutions on the table for this instance, like releasing a generic version or putting EpiPens on the list of preventative medicine insurance companies are required to cover, it’s time we looked more deeply into the problems with the industry as a whole. It’s time for an overhaul.
