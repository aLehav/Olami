Since coming to campus in fall 2011, junior business administration major Ali Celentano has been a driving force on the volleyball court and is always pushing for new challenges.
From Mission Viejo, Calif., Celentano played a variety of sports growing up, most notably soccer. She also tried basketball due to her height — she is 6’0” — but found she didn’t have a true passion for it.
Celentano’s love for volleyball actually started late, during her first year of high school.
“[I] tried out because I was tall, and it looked fun,” she said.
She started to study and learn the game, progressing to new heights. 
With the advice of her high school coach, she joined a club team to further develop her skills.
During a recruiting tournament in Las Vegas her junior year of high school, she was approached by the current head coach of the Carnegie Mellon volleyball team, Kim Kelly. 
This was also the first time Celentano had ever heard of Carnegie Mellon.
Two years later, she would become a business administration major with a minor in biology, join the team, and now, she is positioned to join Carnegie Mellon’s top 10 leaders in kills.
With 893 career kills and 246 for the season, she needs 195 more kills to crack the top 10.
Celentano’s friend Adrian Botta, a junior statistics major who watched her team’s home 3–0 victory over Frostburg State University last Tuesday, said, “Ali plays for hours on end, rarely getting a sub, and always has to run between practice and classes, but she is always walking around with a smile and a great, relaxed attitude.”
“However, the second the whistle blows and the ball is in the air, she is definitely hitting it down as hard as she can. That is when she gets all that energy out,” Botta said.
Celentano’s said that her favorite part of volleyball is “the excitement — the way the momentum can ebb-and-flow after every single point.”
“The most rewarding thing that I have gotten from volleyball is the camaraderie of the girls, the trust in my teammates and coaches, and the teamwork skills I have acquired,” she said.
Celentano has a variety of goals for this season, both personal and team-oriented. She wants to reach 1,000 career kills by the end of the season — she needs 107 more — a distinction she wishes to share with teammate, senior Senna Parsa.
She also wants to have another successful year and have the team reach the University Athletic Association (UAA) playoffs.
“The most exciting games are the UAA’s. We get to play the best teams in our conference and [the games] are always very competitive,” Celentano said.
Her team, with a 15–4 record, sits third in the UAA Conference and will get to show its mettle when it heads to Cleveland this Saturday for the first UAA
 round-robin tournament.
“We are all looking forward to the first UAA round-robin,” Celentano said.
After a 3–6 conference record last season, Celentano hopes for a better result this year. 
Whatever the outcome, however, Celentano will surely play a large role in bringing  the Tartans closer to victory.

The Tartans celebrated their Homecoming game by defeating the Geneva College Golden Tornadoes 34–27 in a double overtime thriller on Saturday. The Tartans are now 2–2 after handing Geneva their first loss of the season.
Geneva jumped on the scoreboard first, scoring a touchdown on a four-yard pass for a quick 7–0 lead.
The Tartans stormed back, driving 63 yards down the field to tie the score at seven. Sophomore running back Max Reinertsen spearheaded the drive with a run of 23 yards and another of 22 yards. Senior quarterback Rob Kalkstein’s first completed pass of the day — a two-yard pass to senior wide receiver Tim Kikta — finished the touchdown drive.
The second quarter began with success for Carnegie Mellon as Kalkstein found junior wide receiver Tim Swanson for a 56-yard run down the sideline. Just three plays later, Kalkstein scored on a five-yard scamper for their first lead of the day, 14–7. Two field goals by the Golden Tornadoes and a 15-yard pass from Kalkstein to Reinertsen ended the first half with a score of 21–13.
The Golden Tornadoes opened the scoring in the second half after a 15-yard touchdown pass. Geneva tried for a two-point conversion, but was unsuccessful, leaving the score at 21–19. Just before the end of the quarter, Kalkstein completed a touchdown pass to senior tight end Bryce Pardoe advancing the score to 27–19. The Tartans’ extra point attempt was blocked — a key development that kept Geneva within one possession.
With just under three minutes left in the fourth quarter, the Golden Tornadoes completed another touchdown and were successful this time with the two-point conversion tying the score at 27.
Kalkstein’s pass, the team’s chance for a game-winning drive, was promptly intercepted. This gave Geneva an opportunity for their own game-winning drive starting at the Carnegie Mellon 45-yard line. The Tartans’ defense was unable to stop the Geneva advance, however, and the Golden Tornadoes were set up for a game-winning field goal from the Tartans’ 18-yard line. Fortunately for the Tartans, the Geneva field goal attempt failed.
The first overtime started well for the Golden Tornadoes, who scored a touchdown after just three plays. The Tartans responded well again as Reinertsen found himself in the end zone after a three-yard pass from Kalkstein.
Double overtime began with the Tartans on offense first, and they scored in just five plays: Reinertsen completed his third touchdown of the day so the Tartans could take the lead, rushing into the end zone from six yards out. 
Geneva College failed to complete four passes in a row, and senior Tartan defensive backs Jack Butler and Liam McGrath each racked up a pass breakup on third and fourth down, securing the Tartan victory.
“It was definitely one of the greatest games I’ve ever played in, and it was the first time that we seemed like one team. This game definitely gave us a big boost in morale moving forward,” Butler said.
The Tartans will hit the road next Saturday when they play St. Vincent College at 1 p.m. in Latrobe, Pa.

After mastering non-conference opponents, both the men’s and women’s soccer teams look ready to move on to tougher competition when University Athletic Association (UAA) Conference play starts Saturday. 
“[Conference play is] much more competitive. We don’t have a conference tournament so every game is like a championship game,” said men’s head coach Arron Lujan. 
With the men’s team at 7–1–1 and the women’s at 6–1–1, the two teams have followed similar paths to this point. 
Early in the season, both teams were clearly outplaying their opponents, though they were struggling to put the ball in the net.
The men’s team won each of its first five victories of the season with scores of 1–0.
“It took our forwards and midfielders a little while to get in a flow with each other. The past couple of games, we’ve been firing on all cylinders,” said senior captain Ben Bryant. 
Over the past three games, the men’s squad has scored a total of nine goals. While seniors Max Tassano and Chris Wysocki have led the way with totals of five and four goals respectively, first-year midfielder Tristan Lockwood has emerged as a somewhat surprising presence.
Lockwood, who has started eight of the nine games after senior midfielder Scott Gerfen suffered a season-ending leg injury, has totaled two goals and two assists so far. 
“The upperclassmen have really accepted me, and made it easier for me to transition into an important playing role,” Lockwood said.
“Tristan comes from a good club team. I’m not that surprised [at his success].... He’s taken that opportunity and done a really good job with it,” Lujan said. 
Ranked No. 15 in Division III, the women’s only loss of the season came against Johns Hopkins University, now ranked the No. 2 team in the country, in a game which the Tartans briefly led 2–0 before conceding three goals in a row. 
“We know we are one of the best teams in the country, and we can play with one of the best teams in the country,” said women’s head coach Yon Struble. 
So far, the team has convincingly handled its weaker non-conference opponents, keeping possession in the opponent’s half and using its speed and athleticism to create many goal-scoring opportunities.
Though they have struggled with their finishing touch, they scored four goals in their victory over Juniata College last Wednesday. 
Asked if he was satisfied with his team’s goal-scoring, Struble was direct. “No. We always want to score more goals.” 
Despite a rotating starting three up front, many players have stepped up, showing the team’s depth. Junior midfielder Amanda So started the season strong with three goals in the first three games, and five of her teammates have scored two or more goals. 
The return of senior forward Alex Venegas from a preseason knee injury should also strengthen the women’s team’s attack. 
Although the start of UAA play brings tougher play — “The games are battles,” Struble said — both teams are looking forward to the competition. 
“I think the team looks great, and we’re all feeling really confident and pumped to go,” said graduate student goalkeeper Anna Albi.
At stake for both teams is the automatic bid into the NCAA tournament given to the conference winner. 
“I’m excited. I think we can win the UAA this year,” Bryant said. 
The UAA conference is so highly competitive and fields so many great teams, however, that many of them earn at-large bids into the tournament anyway. Teams that finish third or fourth in the conference can earn bids into the tournament. 
“It’s such a competitive conference, and every team could win on any given day,” Struble said.
Both teams will play all seven other teams in their conferences once, starting this Saturday when both the University of Chicago men’s and women’s teams visit Pittsburgh. 
The men will kick off first at 11:00 a.m. followed by the women at 1:30 p.m. 
Last season, the men’s team lost in the second round of the NCAA tournament, while the women’s team lost in heartbreaking fashion in the quarterfinals on penalty kicks. 
“We know that we’re kind of a new team, and we’re slowly but surely making new memories,” Albi said.

In order to facilitate discussion on the impact of federal and academic initiatives on neurological research, Carnegie Mellon held the “Impact of BRAIN and Mind Research Symposium” last Saturday. It focused on the Brain Research through Advanced Innovative Neurotechnologies (BRAIN) initiative, which awards academic institutions research grants to further brain research.
According to the White House website, BRAIN aims to develop new techniques for the prevention and treatment of brain disorders like Alzheimer’s, schizophrenia, autism, epilepsy, Parkinson’s, and traumatic brain injury.
This symposium was the first of Carnegie Mellon’s yearlong “Crossing Boundaries, Transforming Lives” symposia in celebration of Subra Suresh’s inaugural year as the university’s ninth president. Its discussion panel included faculty from various departments and schools at Carnegie Mellon, as well as Harvard University, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, and the White House’s Office of Science and Technology Policy.
Suresh said that brain research has immediate and practical effects in solving real-world issues.
“It’s not just an academic exercise,” Suresh said in his speech. “It’s a major day-to-day issue. More than 50 percent of all Americans over the age of 85 will develop Alzheimer’s. Combine that with other brain diseases … and the societal need for [BRAIN] is compelling.” 
He also added that a significant fraction, about 20–25 percent, of U.S. soldiers return from wars abroad with traumatic brain injury.
Speaking on Carnegie Mellon’s and Pittsburgh’s roles in supporting the initiative, Suresh said, “Pittsburgh, in general, as a city, and CMU and the University of Pittsburgh as partnering entities, have played a leading role. The Center for the Neural Basis of Cognition, which is a joint effort between the two institutions, has been a leader in pioneering research.”
Tom Mitchell, head of the machine learning department, explained his interest in how the brain deals with language processing. He highlighted an experiment performed in his laboratory, where an individual was placed in an functional magnetic resource imaging (fMRI) scanner — which reads the brain’s neural activity — and shown stimuli, each consisting of an image and a one-word caption. By running various machine learning algorithms on the data, researchers can predict which neurons in the brain are activated when other types of stimuli are given. These models show that the similar words trigger similar brain activity in most individuals. Another application of this model shows that in bilingual people, the same neurons are activated in the brain regardless of the language in which the word is presented.
Mitchell believes that the BRAIN initiative will generate a flood of data on brain activity while reading words. He feels that the “big opportunity going forward [will be to generate] subtle and comprehensive models of language comprehension by using not just one experiment, but thousands of experiments involving different people and different layouts.”
Nathan Urban, head of the biological sciences department, discussed the role of individual neurons inside the brain. According to him, the main function of a neuron is “to perform an analog to digital conversion” of continuous sensory impulses to spikes called action potentials in the brain.
Urban said that research has shown that, although all the neurons in the brain perform similar functions, no two neurons are exactly similar and interchangeable in structure. Just as no two snowflakes have identical structures even though they follow the same hexagonal pattern, he explained, any given neuron is unique, even though it may look similar to other neurons. Urban also discussed how neurons function in brains of people with autism, and overviewed research being done in that area.
Psychology professor Marlene Behrmann explained her research in neurological patterns behind facial recognition. She pointed out that people tend to look at the upper part of the face longer than the lower part of the face. Thus, when images of faces are recreated based on the neural signals triggered in a person’s brain, the upper parts are more sharply focused than the lower. 
She also explained that people with congenital prosopagnosia, or face blindness, rely on clothing, voice and other external cues to identify others. In severe cases, they may also be unable to recognize loved ones. Research conducted in Behrmann’s laboratory has determined that, in such people, the fault lies in the propagation of the neural signals corresponding to facial recognition.
Emery Brown of Harvard University and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology focused his talk on the activity within one’s brain while under anesthesia. Finally, the White House’s Office of Science and Technology Policy spokesman Phillip Rubin presented information on the BRAIN Initiative itself and the policy decisions that led to it.
Carnegie Mellon is poised to make a significant contribution as part of the BRAIN initiative. A successful partnership with the University of Pittsburgh — as manifested in the Center for the Neural Basis of Cognition — will make sure that Carnegie Mellon and Pittsburgh have an important role to play in the upcoming revolution in the field of brain research.

If you could drink from the Fountain of Youth, would you?
The idea of eternal, or even extended, life has been a divisive issue since its conception. Are we meant to live for only a finite period of time? Is it moral to allow death to occur when it could be prevented? If humans take longer to pass away, where will we find the space to house the world’s growing population? These are all questions that have different “correct” answers, depending on who’s talking. These discussions are taking on greater importance today as technology, science, and human ingenuity make it possible to achieve a substantially longer lifespan.
Last week, CEO of Google Larry Page announced the company’s next bold venture: finding the cure to aging. Google is funding the creation of a startup research company, Calico, that aims to extend the lives of people born 20 years ago by 100 years. In a post on Google+, Page said, “There’s tremendous potential for technology more generally to improve people’s lives.” While Calico’s plan of action has not yet been publicized, there are many existing technologies and methods that could potentially be expanded upon to produce significant results. One such method that shows promise is called telomerase gene therapy.
Telomeres are essentially shields made out of nucleotide base pairs that are placed at the ends of every chromosome in animal cells to protect DNA from erosion during cell division. Each telomere loses base pairs every time the cell divides, which may cause the phenomena of aging. After telomeres deteriorate to a certain length, the DNA is no longer protected; the cell ceases to divide and consequently dies. However, some cells in the body, such as adult stem cells, have shown to express a protein called telomerase that prevents telomeres from degrading. Recent research conducted at the Spanish National Cancer Research Center has shown that treating mice with telomerase increases the length of their life by up to 40 percent. Calico could potentially expand on telomerase research by further investigating its effectiveness and by finding ways to safely and effectively administer it to humans.
Another approach — one currently being researched at Carnegie Mellon — looks at how organisms tend to express genes in different ways as they age. Javier Lopez, associate professor of biological sciences at Carnegie Mellon, is looking at these differential expressions and investigating if waste produced by the cell plays a role. As cells produce energy to carry out the processes of life, destructive compounds are created that accumulate in cells. Lopez has been able to link this buildup with changes in gene expression that correlate to aging. Removing or limiting the effects of this byproduct could lead to insight into another form of life extension.
Page said, “[We] are excited about tackling aging and illness. These issues affect us all — from the decreased mobility and mental agility that comes with age, to life-threatening diseases that exact a terrible physical and emotional toll on individuals and families. And while this is clearly a longer-term bet, we believe we can make good progress within reasonable timescales with the right goals and the right people.”
While some believe Calico has good intentions, others believe that extending the length of human lives is not the right answer. Many contend that the resources required for this undertaking would be better spent protecting the environment or reducing poverty and hunger. 
Additionally, life extension means that there will be an even greater increase in the population after each successive generation. This could potentially lead to a shortage of resources on Earth.
“Death, even though it can be sad and painful, is an unavoidable and necessary process of life,” first-year business major Sonali Avlani said. “I’m not saying that finding cures to diseases like cancer and AIDS is a bad thing. However, we simply don’t have the resources to sustain longer lives. We are already overpopulating the Earth.”
As of now, it is no longer a question of if we can live longer; it’s just a question of if we want to.

Twitter, created in 2006, serves its purpose as a worldwide social networking phenomenon — but it’s also a useful resource for predicting the outcomes of events such as elections or movie premieres. Recent findings by researchers at Carnegie Mellon show that Twitter analysis may also be able to help gamblers beat the spread on NFL games.
Christopher Dyer, assistant professor in Carnegie Mellon’s Language Technologies Institute, led a research team in gathering tweets every 15 minutes during football season, then distinguishing tweets that included hashtags associated with NFL teams. The goal of the research was to determine a correlation between tweets about a game and the outcome — specifically, which team will win and which team will beat the spread.
They found that, while Twitter data did not help determine which team would win a game, it was about 56 percent accurate with regards to beating the spread. They also discovered that increases in volume of tweets compared to a team’s baseline number of tweets corresponded with a loss. “It looks like people are tweeting when they are anxious,” Dyer said. “There is some kind of emotional thing going on.”
According to Dyer, sports betting works well with machine learning. In sports betting, bookies give a handicap to the team expected to lose, which is added onto that team’s score after the game’s completion. The bookies generally attempt to create the handicap so that the chances for each team to win will be 50 percent, ensuring that they receive approximately the same number of bets for each team. If the team someone bet on has the higher score after the handicap has been added, they have beaten the spread.
Dyer explained that they assumed many people were betting illogically based on teams they liked, rather than which team was actually more likely to win. Optimistic versus pessimistic fan bases can also influence betting.
“The bookies know the dynamics of the two teams, so they are going to be setting the line in a slightly more favorable way to make money. If we can detect this kind of irrationality from a signal in social media, then maybe we can make money,” Dyer said. “Football is a great sport for this; the teams have national followings and the games are broadcast in national markets.” Football’s large sphere of influence was a major reason the team chose this sport for the research. It was also beneficial that teams only play once a week — this made it easy to determine which games the tweets were referring to.
Dyer also commented on the benefits of using football from a scientific perspective.
“You have a lot of work on Twitter saying we can forecast elections, but elections come along every four years,” he explained. “In football we have 140 games during the course of a season, so we get replicated experiments.”
Although Twitter is constantly developing, the main aspects of each game were the same, which allowed the results to be more scientifically relevant.
Despite promising conclusions, the research had its limitations. “People are talking about games using all kinds of different words. It’s Twitter; people don’t even use typical, nice, edited English. Figuring out how to get a signal out of that was a big challenge in the research,” Dyer said. “We do a really naive categorization of the tweets.” The research didn’t separate words into positive and negative, and tweets weren’t interpreted based on associations with how people speak. Each word in the tweets was treated individually, which caused some of the meaning to be lost. Dyer explains that the tweet “the Steelers beat the Eagles” was exactly the same as “the Eagles beat the Steelers” based on the model.
“We haven’t found a way to beat Vegas,” Dyer said. “We still make a lot of mistakes.”
Despite the challenges, this research provides valuable information for future analysis of Twitter data and has the potential to increase the accuracy with which we predict future events.

Imagine if every student in 15–110 had the opportunity to use his or her programming skills to control robots. BirdBrain Technologies, a startup company that grew from Carnegie Mellon University’s Community Robotics, Education and Technology Empowerment (CREATE) Lab is introducing 1,000 robots to up to 20 school districts and educational organizations in an attempt to inspire and guide novice programmers in the world of computer science. The distribution of the robots will take place Dec. 8–14, during Computer Science Education Week (CSEdWeek).
The robot — known as the Finch — is a low-cost tabletop robot with bird-like features that has light, temperature, and obstacle sensors, along with an accelerometer that measures the direction the Finch tilts. The Finch also possesses simple components: Two motor-driven wheels, a buzzer, and a beak are programmed to light up in different colors. All these attributes are manipulated by an input device similar to a Wii remote. Its most convenient feature is its over-15-foot USB cable, which eliminates the need for batteries and drives down costs. In addition, the robot supports a variety of major programming languages.
Tom Lauwers, the creator of Finch and founder of BirdBrain Technologies, designed the Finch at the Carnegie Mellon’s CREATE Lab after his four-year research study as a Ph.D. student in the Robotics Institute. The study ended in 2010 after the successful development of a robot with a set of features optimized for computer science education. Back in 2005, computer science programs and high school programming classes were struggling with low enrollment and lack of interest from students; Lauwers aimed to increase student motivation in introductory classes by creating an appropriate learning tool. Since it went on the market two-and-a-half years ago, the Finch’s purpose has been to help students.
Despite the commercial success since the robot’s launch, Lauwers and his team faced challenges during developmental stages that dealt with deciding which features to include in the robot. For example, they originally debated adding in a camera, but ditched the idea after realizing its added expenses and relatively small usefulness in a classroom setting.
Nonetheless, BirdBrain Technologies is now loaning out several hundred robots for an entire year because the company has received an overwhelming number of applicants and wanted to support more schools than the original plan allowed. The company estimates that the new program will allow 15,000–30,000 students in roughly 50 school districts to have at least one hour of experience programming the Finch. BirdBrain Technologies explicitly requires that students have little or no experience programming robots; The company also favors schools that have a high number of low-income students. It also only specifically serves students in grades four through nine. 
Although many educational systems seem to view computer science courses as high–school level electives, Lauwers regards them as core skills that should be learned earlier on in upper elementary school. He hopes that at least some of the students who program the Finch will take the initiative to use free programs such as Snap! and Scratch to independently study programming.
Lauwers must evaluate over 150 applications before this Friday and decide which ones are the most promising. Then, he needs to work with several stakeholders to develop activities for the robots for the teachers to use, and direct the warehouse that processes his company’s orders to deliver the robots. Before CSEdWeek, BirdBrain Technologies will send out five robots to each participating organization in November to allow teachers preparation time.
Although his focus is definitely on the Pittsburgh community, Lauwers sees himself as part of larger organization to promote computer science education.
“We want to support Computer Science Education Week’s Hour of Code initiative, which seeks to demystify computer code with a one-hour introductory activity for 10 million students,” he said.

A car covered in doll appendages, a 40-foot rubber duck on the Allegheny River, and multisensory exhibitions — Friday night was one of many strange and exciting firsts as Pittsburghers and students alike gathered in Downtown’s Cultural District for the quarterly Gallery Crawl, hosted by the Pittsburgh Cultural Trust.
This year, 28 businesses and galleries, plus one bridge, opened their doors to the people of Pittsburgh to encourage exploration of the rich and diverse culture the city has to offer.
The highlight of the evening was the Rubber Duck Bridge Party, hosted by Mikey and Big Bob from KISS FM’s Morning Freak Show on the Roberto Clemente Bridge. The party blocked off car traffic on the bridge as Mikey and Big Bob blasted music and vendors of food, art, and memorabilia set up shop.
The event celebrated the unveiling of The Rubber Duck Project, a four-story-tall floating rubber duck designed by Dutch artist Florentijn Hofman. Hofman’s “Rubber Duck” has traveled the world, floating through Amsterdam, Belgium, Sydney, and Hong Kong — but Friday night marked its U.S. debut. “It’s a cool thing that it’s in Pittsburgh first,” said sophomore statistics major Caitlin Selvaggi. “[Pittsburgh] is an up-and-coming city, and this is a symbol of that.”
Hofman’s website says that the duck was designed to be “soft, friendly, and suitable for all ages.” It’s clear that the artist met his goal from the sheer number of families, couples, and friends that came out to enjoy the view. The bridge was swarming with people, everyone clamoring for a look and a picture of the duck. The more daring observers climbed the bridge itself, standing on the barrier between road and walkway to get a clear shot.
The party was the launch of the Pittsburgh Festival of Firsts, which continues through Oct. 20. During the festival, the city will host the U.S. premieres of numerous theater, dance, music, and visual art displays. On Friday night, three other installations had their U.S. debut, including Kurt Hentschlager and Ulf Langheinrich’s Granular Synthesis: Model 5 and POL in the SPACE art gallery on Liberty Avenue.
Model 5 consists of a large screen curtained off, upon which four large images are projected. The images shift and move in time to a rhythmic bass, creating a multisensory experience. Viewers sit down and take in the experience, soaking in the physical vibrations from the bass rhythms as the pictures shift and change.
But as soon as viewers become comfortable with the rhythm, the mood, and the images themselves, these details suddenly shift to something new. Sophomore English major Sayre Olson said she was “never fully satisfied” with the piece because it felt as if “the art was always one step ahead of you.”
Another installation that examines perception is Francis Crisafio’s HOLDUP in the HOOD in the 707 Penn Gallery. The photographs incorporate drawings and recycled materials such as magazines in an exploration of self-perception, race, gender, and identity, especially in pop culture. 
Crisafio, who studied printmaking and painting at Carnegie Mellon, said in his artist’s statement that this installation was created out of a “larger body of work that documents an after-school, collaborative arts curriculum rooted in self-portraiture.”
“It was a very high concept, but not so weird that I didn’t get it,” sophomore chemistry and English double major Sophie Zucker said, “although it was hard to pinpoint one message.”
The most striking images show people holding magazine covers in front of their faces. The covers feature the face of a model and obscure all of the distinctive features of the subjects except their eyes, replacing them with an example of societal standards of beauty. This pattern creates an interesting juxtaposition between societal standards and natural beauty, causing the viewer to examine where beauty truly lies.
This quarter’s crawl also featured a number of Pittsburgh-specific explorations, most notably the PNC Legacy Project at 600 Liberty Ave. This exhibit has been open for about a year and is a permanent display of the rich history of Pittsburgh through visual images and oral histories.
Visitors are able to compare and contrast images of the city in the past and present through interactive touch screen displays, featuring notable locations such as the North Shore. The exhibit also showcases an interactive wall projection of the city skyline in 1951. As you walk toward the wall, the projector senses your presence, and the image shifts to a 2013 skyline in the space where your shadow would normally be.
Just to the right of that piece, small boxes are suspended from the ceiling, each containing a miniature speaker. Each box features a short oral history of Pittsburgh by notable residents — such as founding owner of the Pittsburgh Steelers Art Rooney — accessible by pressing a button and holding the speaker up to your ear. The exhibit is an interesting look back on the city’s history in the midst of such modern art in the district.
Other features of the event included interactive activities that invited the attendees to become artists themselves. “The Art of Pierogie Making” at Braddock’s American Brasserie and free dance lessons and demos at the Arthur Murray Dance Studio are just two examples of the inclusive nature of the event, where the lines between art and viewer were blurred.
The mixture of function and form was also present in the kNOT Dance at Verve Wellness. Three pieces of brightly colored fabric were suspended from the ceiling, creating swings on which dancers performed.
The dancers showcased their skills as they climbed, swung, and hung from the fabric, bringing to mind acrobats in a circus. The graceful beauty of their movements contrasted with the industrial setting of what appeared to be a transformed storage loft, creating a juxtaposition that perfectly represents the city of Pittsburgh and its history.
Down the street was the most functional art of the night: Art Car Round Up, a showcase of four highly decorated cars at 8th Street and Penn Avenue. Greg Phelps’s “That Car #3” is a Nissan Versa covered in small round mirrors, stones, corks, and bumper stickers. Upon closer inspection, the car’s immediate aesthetic beauty becomes distorted by the various doll pieces placed on the car. Arms, legs, and a few heads can be seen amidst the shiny pieces that dominate the display.
According to Phelps, this is the only car he owns, and he drives it every day, calling himself “the lazy man’s good Samaritan”: All he has to do is drive around and people are pointing and smiling, creating conversations and connections. “That Car #3” is Phelps’s third art car, and his art car project has progressed over two years. As for what motivates his process, Phelps simply says that it’s fun.
The Gallery Crawl can be overwhelming with so many sights and sounds fighting for dominance, but even a cursory exploration reveals hidden art and culture. Zucker said that the experience gave her a chance to “explore Pittsburgh as a city in its own right and as a cultural center.”
“[I’ve] never been downtown when it was alive,” she said.
The event gives Pittsburgh the chance to come together to explore its art scene and get a glimpse of the city it is becoming. This fall’s Gallery Crawl explored perception and sense, compared history and the present, and mingled mature themes with childhood memories.
Most of the exhibits featured on Friday night are just beginning, so even if you missed the event, you can still experience the art. A complete list of exhibitions is available on the Pittsburgh Cultural Trust website, along with information about the Festival of Firsts.

Scotch’n’Soda Theatre held its sixth Annual Charity Cabaret on Friday night. In two hours, the show covered 22 performances in two acts and an intermission. Most of the songs were snipped out of musical theater shows, but were accessible enough to enjoy without exposition. All proceeds from the cabaret went toward the Alumni Theater Company, a nonprofit theater in Pittsburgh which, according to its website, “provides quality performing arts training for talented, committed youth in grades 6–12 in a highly creative, challenging, and supportive environment.”
The show opened with all of the performers singing “The Sixth Annual Charity Cabaret,” a rendition of “The 25th Annual Putnam County Spelling Bee” from the one-act musical comedy of the same title, with the lyrics tweaked to fit the occasion. Afterward, each of the singers performed individually or in pairs before coming together again for a group finale.
One of the most interesting parts of the show was hearing student reinterpretations of songs that are usually sung by professionals, like junior voice major Zachary Mendez’s performance of the popular Phantom of the Opera_number, “Music of the Night.” Some performers added a great deal of personality to their songs, like junior psychology major Jaclyn Ross, who gave an energetic performance in her version of “Joey Is a Punk Rocker” from _The Black Suits, a song about a straight-laced girl who is in love with a punk rock boy. Though most performers only used their voices, junior chemical engineering major Alex Petti brought his guitar to strum along as he sang “Can’t Take My Eyes Off of You” from Jersey Boys.
In addition to Carnegie Mellon students, members of the Alumni Theater Company also came to perform the song “A Step Too Far” from their recent production of the musical Aida.
Sophomore vocal performance major Shannyn Rinker’s soulful rendition of the classic song, “Blues in the Night” was simply a show-stopper. Singing with her body language as well as with voice, Rinker gave the air of an old-time lounge singer, like Billie Holiday or Ella Fitzgerald.
In her performance of “Part of Your World” from The Little Mermaid, Abby Botnick, a senior Bachelor of Humanities and Arts student in costume design and professional writing, made quite the entrance; she was carried out decked in full mermaid regalia — tail, seashells, fork-comb, and all. Throughout the song, unable to walk, Botnick hopped around in her mermaid costume and had to be carried out when the song was finished.
Junior voice major Taylor Rawley performed “Mr. Cellophane” from Chicago, a sadly humorous song about a man who nobody notices. Rawley did a small but hilarious dance number to go along with the tone of the song, in which he desperately waved around jazz hands and did an feeble one-man kickline to make people notice him.
Of special mention was the emcee — junior chemical engineering major and Scotch’n’Soda vice president Evan Starkweather — who provided warm, friendly humor in the small breaks between the performances, as well as the pit musicians, whose presence and live musical performances gave the songs a much more vibrant sound.
The show was very charming overall; with plenty of talented performers and wonderful music, the show was a great Cèilidh Weekend event, and hopefully a tradition that will continue in future years.

At the Society for Contemporary Crafts in the Strip District in Pittsburgh, an exhibition called ENOUGH Violence: Artists Speak Out opened last Friday. The exhibition seeks to explore how art can shed light on creative solutions to the urgent issue of increasing violence in the U.S. and around the world. The project is an interdisciplinary collaboration among artists, mental health professionals, academics, and community leaders that uses a multimedia platform to enable viewers to participate in a genuine discussion about violence and how it affects people.
The exhibition intertwines art with social work, social justice, and psychology to ask the complex question of what we can do as a community to combat violence. It features the work of 14 renowned artists and craftsmen from the U.S. and Europe working with photography, prints, painting, clay, fabric, and metal. The exhibition also includes two interactive components: a physical space in the main gallery for visitors to create their own “personal talisman to carry along with them” and a public Tumblr collection of people’s own stories about their experiences with violence.
Participating artists have chosen to focus their artwork on topics ranging from domestic abuse and rape to war and terrorism. Many of the pieces rely on disturbing imagery, including life-size sculptures of naked children praying on their knees, a menorah made of handguns, and an American flag with a symbolic red circle in the center. Despite the seriousness, the works also have an element of hope and resilience from people who have overcome violence.
Boris Bally (CFA ’84), a former adjunct professor in the School of Art and the School of Design, is a Pittsburgh native and metalsmith with three pieces in the exhibition. In the 1990s, Bally became involved in an anti-violence coalition that made him interested in anti-violence art. In 1997, Bally curated a show titled Artists of a Different Caliber in the former Hewlett Gallery at Carnegie Mellon, which challenged artists to create sculptures out of decommissioned handguns from buyback programs — programs that aimed to take guns out of civilian hands. “I had been interested in the handguns for a while; I had about 200 guns in my studio,” he said.
Bally’s work for the current exhibition is in the same vein as the show in 1997. He created three pieces out of handguns — “Loaded Menorah,” “Brave 4: Breastplate,” and “Bear Claw Necklace” — that draw inspiration from indigenous cultures and religious traditions while being juxtaposed with the violent reality of the present era.
The exhibition will be open through March 22. During that time, numerous events and guest lectures by professors, educators, community leaders, and artists will aim to find creative solutions to violence. The Society for Contemporary Crafts will also host information sessions on regional social service agencies on the first Saturday of each month while the exhibition is on display. For more information, call 412-261-7003.

“If I have to hear one more time that you did this for the family...”
Obviously, spoilers abound throughout this article.
Since its invention, television has always been a source of shared cultural moments in America. Together we witnessed the cast of Friends grab coffee at Central Perk one last time as well as Jerry, Elaine, George, and Kramer enter their shared prison cell for violating the Good Samaritan law (it was new) on the series finale of Seinfeld.
While many say that these kinds of unifying events have become a thing of the past due to the rise of special interest entertainment and news outlets, that isn’t entirely true. Case in point, last night we all watched the conclusion of high-school-chemistry-teacher-turned-crystal-meth-kingpin Walter White’s incredible story with the series finale of AMC’s Breaking Bad.
“If we’re gonna go that way, you’re going to need a bigger knife.”
Breaking Bad began in 2008 with Walter White (Bryan Cranston), a high school chemistry teacher with a pregnant wife, Skyler (Anna Gunn), and a son with cerebral palsy, Walt Jr. (RJ Mitte). Walt is handed a death sentence when he is diagnosed with inoperable lung cancer and turns to a former student of his named Jesse Pinkman (Aaron Paul) to help him use his knowledge of chemistry to cook and distribute crystal meth.
Walt and Jesse become known for producing incredibly pure meth, evidenced by its blue color. As Walter’s criminal enterprise grows, he adopts the pseudonym “Heisenberg” and begins accruing a body count that rivals his rising stacks of cash. Competition, potential informers and witnesses, and anyone else who could jeopardize Walt’s business are all disposed of over the course of the series. Five seasons later, Walt decides to retire, sitting on top of $80 million in cash.
Walt would’ve been able to die with peace of mind that his family was taken care of if not for one major wrench in the gear: specifically, his brother-in-law Hank (Dean Norris), a DEA agent tasked with tracking down Heisenberg. Over the course of his manhunt, Hank is shot at and loses the use of his legs for a period of time, in addition to going through just simple, plain, hellish mental anguish.
Around the same time as Walt’s decision to retire, some revealing bathroom reading causes Hank to realize that his nerdy brother-in-law who claims to have recently hit it big at the casino is actually the drug lord who has all but been ruining his life for the past few years. At the beginning of the second half of season five, we find Hank now determined to put Walt behind bars, Jesse reeling with guilt over his and Walt’s actions over the course of their enterprise, and a criminal underworld desperate for someone who can cook crystal meth as well as Heisenberg can.
So, the question that’s been on everyone’s mind — “How will it end?” — has finally been answered. The finale delivered everything fans of the series could’ve hoped for. The trademark bouncing between nail-biting tension and hilarious comedy? Check. Watching Walt settle all remaining scores? Check. Finding yourself rooting for a man who breaks into a home and coldly describes to the inhabitants how easily he could have them killed? Check. The first hour of the episode feels like climbing the first hill of a roller coaster — that tense feeling deep in your gut that you know is about to explode: You find yourself both anticipating it and dreading it.
“How are you feeling? Kind of under the weather, like you have the flu? That would be the ricin I gave you.”
The final 15 minutes contain everything fans have been waiting to see for the past five seasons. As the credits rolled, it was hard to pick a favorite moment: seeing Walt put a whole belt of .50-caliber bullets through Jack’s skinhead gang with the press of a button or Jesse strangling Todd to death with the chains that kept him cooking meth against his will. Perhaps, though, it was when Walt put the final bullet into Jack’s skull, the man who had killed Hank and stolen all the money he had made. Or maybe, just maybe, it was seeing Jesse break through the fence of the compound, finally free.
“Nothing happens until you say that you want this.”
“I want this.”
The finale changed the tone of the series dramatically. When Walt reveals that the true reason he kept up the whole thing was that it was the only thing that made him feel truly alive, Breaking Bad goes from the story of a man doing whatever it took to provide for his family to the story of a man trying to live in the face of certain death. It’s fitting then that Walt finally passes away in a meth lab; he dies in the only place he truly lived.
Breaking Bad has been called the best show in a new golden age of television. It’s a bold statement to make, but now that the show can be taken as a whole, the claim lies on solid ground. 
“Yeah, bitch.”

Dear Ryan & Matt,
I’m noticing more and more small, happy-looking people around campus, and they’re really annoying. They’re traveling in groups and holding up the lines at Entropy+ and Resnik, and just look like a bunch of lost, ignorant sheep. What are these things and what’s the best way of dealing with them?
Sincerely,
People-like Entities Strolling Through Passively, Rather Outrageously Blithe, Likely Enemies of Mine
Dear PEST PROBLEM,
These “things” as you put it are, in fact, people. You probably looked like one not too long ago yourself. These people are colloquially referred to as “freshmen” — or, to be more politically correct, “freshpersons.” Even though they’ve been here over a month, some of them will cling to their carefree, blissfully unaware state they assume upon entering university.
The only cure is time. They will slowly lose their happy-go-lucky attitudes — which is kinda sad, but it’s the natural order of things. The best thing you can do in the meantime is help them along and teach them the secret arts of surviving at Carnegie Mellon. Just don’t be surprised when there’s a whole new crop of “things” next fall.
It’s the circle of life,
Matt & Ryan
Dear Ryan & Matt,
I’m getting tired of bridges in this city. Don’t get me wrong; I love Carnegie Mellon, but I just need a change of venue, maybe just for a semester. 
Sincerely,
Take Relaxing Adventures Via Exploiting Laudable Educational Reasons
Dear TRAVELER,
Have you considered studying abroad in Venice? I hear there are fewer bridges there. Southern France is supposedly nice this time of year and doesn’t suffer from Pittsburgh’s schizophrenic weather. 
I gathered information from the study abroad folk early in my Carnegie Mellon career, and I’m still getting spam from some of the programs, but in all it’s an exciting process to go through. A number of our friends have had great times in other countries.
On the other hand, only six-and-a-half months ’til Carnival!
Matt & Ryan

Mean Girls
Thursday, Oct. 3
7:30 p.m., 9:30 p.m.
“On Oct. 3, he asked me what day it was.” It’s Oct. 3, and it’s also the day you can catch Mean Girls playing in McConomy Auditorium. It’s your chance to watch the female bible, penned by Tina Fey, on the big screen and relive your middle school moments: Cady Heron (Lindsay Lohan) struggles to find her way as she befriends queen bee Regina George (Rachel McAdams) and her little workers — the Plastics. Full of hilarious moments and truths about the girl world, Mean Girls is the perfect movie to watch with friends when you just want to relax and quote every single line. 
The Place Beyond the Pines
Friday, Oct. 4
7 p.m., 10 p.m.
Imagine Ryan Gosling on a motorcycle, tatted up and teary eyed as he embarks upon a crime drama. If you like the sound of that, The Place Beyond the Pines might be for you. Be careful, though. This is a drama about fatherhood and consequences, and its focus is more heart wrench than heartthrob. Gosling plays the role of a motorcyclist who makes the heavy decision to commit a crime for his son but collides with a police officer, played by Bradley Cooper. Their struggle has long-term consequences for their families. The film is thrilling yet organic enough for us to learn about morality and family.
Gandhi
Saturday, Oct. 5
7 p.m.
If you ever wanted a good look into the lives of one of the greatest spiritual leaders of our time, Gandhi is a great place to start. Director Richard Attenborough brings Gandhi’s journey to life in the form of a true epic. Sir Ben Kingsley is a compelling force as the titular spiritual leader who manages to compel both empathy and awe with his performance. Gandhi is a magnetic film that not only allows a peek into a great man’s journey and struggles, but is also one that is poetically imbued with truths about humanity.

A university investigation into alleged sexual assaults in a Greek Quad fraternity house may have violated federal law on reporting and disclosing campus crimes.
Dean of Student Affairs Gina Casalegno first alerted the campus community of an ongoing investigation into the Carnegie Mellon chapter of the Beta Theta Pi fraternity last semester, on March 29. In the email she sent out, Casalegno said that the fraternity was being investigated for “alleged videos and pictures of a sexual nature.”
The investigation involved Carnegie Mellon University Police and the Pittsburgh Bureau of Police, and WTAE-TV Pittsburgh also confirmed in April that the Allegheny County District Attorney’s Office was in contact with the school “regarding recent behavior on campus.” Beta was suspended during the investigation, and the chapter was ultimately shut down by the national fraternity for “hazing.”
After the incident, Carnegie Mellon released a media statement on March 29 that said, “Due to the ongoing nature of this investigation, we cannot comment further on the details of the case at this time.” No followup statement was subsequently released. There is evidence that the university investigation, which University Police told Casalegno had officially closed on Aug. 22, may not have met federal standards and regulations for reporting crimes that occur on a college campus.
The Clery Act
The Jeanne Clery Disclosure of Campus Security Policy and Campus Crime Statistics Act, more commonly known as the Clery Act, is a federal law enforced by the U.S. Department of Education that requires colleges and universities to disclose information about crimes that occur on and around their campuses.
The Clery Act’s requirements include publishing an annual security report, disclosing crime statistics for crimes that occur on and around campuses, issuing timely warnings to the campus community about crimes that pose a serious or ongoing threat to students and employees, and having a public crime log.
“In general, the crime logs are made available to inform the campus community about crimes and to create transparency on campus,” explained Abigail Boyer, the assistant executive director of programs, outreach, and communications for the Clery Center for Security On Campus. The log must include the “nature, date, time, and general location of each crime” and be available for the public’s inspection.
The Tartan has learned that multiple students spoke with the police during the spring semester about alleged crimes that occurred at Beta which include sexually explicit photographs taken without consent and sexual assault. However, there is no mention of the investigation or any cases involving sexually explicit photographs or sexual assault in the University Police crime log, which is available for inspection at the front desk of the police station. 
When asked about the discrepancy, University Police lieutenant Gary Scheimer said, “The crime log is not updated with ongoing information that is uncovered during a criminal investigation.... The original report is published, but not the updates of an ongoing investigation.”
However, when told that the original report had not been published in the crime log either, he went to check for the report in the crime log and confirmed that it was not in the log, saying, “The way  [the investigation] came in, it did not come in on the media log.”
Casalegno could not be reached for an interview in person or on the phone, but she wrote in an emailed statement, “I have full confidence they [University Police] followed their procedures and ensured complete compliance with the Clery Act throughout this investigation.”
While Boyer could not comment on individual cases, she said that if a student thinks that his or her case was handled in a way that did not meet the standards of the Clery Act, “I always encourage student to talk to their institutions to ask questions about what information is available. In addition ... an individual has the option of filing a complaint with the Department of Education.” 
The complaint would be handled administratively, rather than in court. If the Department of Education finds a complaint to be valid, a university could be fined up to $35,000 per infraction and, in extreme cases, could be suspended from participation in student financial aid programs. This is not the first time that questions have arisen over Carnegie Mellon’s handling of a sexual assault case. In May 2012, Nicole Ickes published a blog post alleging that Carnegie Mellon had mishandled a sexual assault case that she reported to the university in March 2011. She wrote that she was not informed of academic accommodations that the Department of Education’s Title IX requires universities to make available to sexual assault survivors.
Beta investigation
When asked about the outcome of the investigation into Beta, Scheimer said he would have to check with Casalegno and the university’s Office of General Counsel to see what information he was allowed to disclose. As of press time, he had not contacted The Tartan with any information about the investigation’s results.
As of May 8, three sexual assault cases had been referred for disciplinary review through the university in 2013. 
Casalegno could not say what month these cases occurred, or if they were connected to Beta. When asked about her opinion of the investigation, Casalegno said via email, “I believe the investigation was handled with utmost sensitivity and professionalism by our university police. They partnered very closely with the division of student affairs to ensure appropriate engagement with the men of Beta and with any potential members of the community who might have been involved in the matters they were investigating.”
National trend
Numerous universities around the country have recently been accused of not following federal requirements for sexual assault cases. Last October, a student at Wesleyan University in Middletown, Conn., sued the university for not following Title IX requirements when she was raped at the Mu Epsilon chapter of Beta Theta Pi. 
37 students and alumni at Occidental College in Los Angeles filed a lawsuit and a Clery Act complaint in April that alleged the school had mishandled their sexual assault cases. The school recently settled the lawsuit, while the Department of Education’s investigation into the Clery Act complaint is still ongoing.
In May, Yale University was fined $165,000 by the Department of Education for “serious and numerous” Clery Act violations, including not reporting forcible sex offenses. The fine was later reduced to $155,000.
Editor's Note: The Tartan will continue to investigate the Beta Theta Pi incident. Anyone with information about the case is encouraged to contact The Tartan at news@thetartan.org.

University President Subra Suresh addressed key issues facing Carnegie Mellon University and listened to the school community voice its concerns in two addresses. The first address took place last Monday in the Gates Hillman Complex’s Rashid Auditorium, and the second one occurred last Saturday in the University Center’s McConomy Auditorium.
These events marked the continuation of Suresh’s listening tour, an extended effort by Suresh to discuss and learn more about topics of interest to various groups associated with Carnegie Mellon. The tour, which has officially been going on for three months, includes multiple sessions between Suresh and campus affiliates. The address on Monday was geared toward undergraduate and graduate students, whereas Saturday’s address targeted parents and alumni in honor of Cèilidh Weekend.
“I find it extremely helpful to listen to the different perspectives and get a window into what’s on different people’s minds,” Suresh said during the first event last week.
One recurring topic in the addresses was Carnegie Mellon’s emphasis on interdisciplinary studies. According to Suresh, the school’s strength lies in its well-roundedness.
“I hope that your children who are here getting an education will sample the rich variety of opportunities that exist on campus and also learn from them because they are going to be future leaders,” Suresh said in his address to parents.
More specifically, Suresh discussed challenges of the 21st century and related them to the importance of a broad educational foundation. He cited a causal relationship between many of the century’s biggest advancements and biggest problems, for which he blamed on innovators’ failures to connect technological challenges with human challenges. At Carnegie Mellon, however, Suresh believes the interdisciplinary opportunities allow students to analyze problems from both scientific and humanities perspectives.
“CMU is one of the very few institutions that’s so uniquely positioned to bring the two, [humanities and sciences], together in ways that most other institutions cannot,” Suresh said.
First-year business administration major Radhika Dalal agreed with Suresh’s claims about the strength of cross-disciplinary studies, which she cites as the reason for her decision to attend the university.
“I want to be on the business side of a technological company, and Carnegie Mellon is really great at integrating the two fields together,” Dalal said.
However, some students voiced concerns about actually getting into classes outside of their primary major or department. Suresh responded by stating that one of his long-term goals is to increase communication and openness between departments, as well as make the university feel more unified as a whole.
Another major discussion point revolved around changes in higher education in general, such as online education, technology-enhanced learning, and the open access movement. Suresh addressed the complicated nuances of these developments, focusing namely on their financial challenges.
“In an ideal world, open access is what we want, but without a viable financial model, it will not work,” Suresh said.
Audience member and parent of a student Patricia Petrick appreciated Suresh’s practical mindset about educational changes.
“I think he has excellent insights into the problems of higher education, and that includes how you fund the very sophisticated education being provided,” Petrick said.
Petrick attributed her realistic perspective to her previous experience working in policy with the director of the National Science Foundation (NSF).
Suresh spoke more in depth about his professional background during his Saturday address and connected it with his current position at Carnegie Mellon, describing both the NSF and the university as institutions whose investments yield high returns.
“CMU has produced more spin off companies per dollar of research money spent than any other university in the country without a medical school,” Suresh said.
Bill Mullins, husband of Patricia Petrick, appreciated Suresh’s ability to recognize and articulate the various strengths and values of the university. “He understands the Carnegie Mellon culture, seems very comfortable with it, seems to encourage it, like it, and he’s going to perpetuate it,” Mullins said.
Suresh will continue reaching out to the community on his listening tour during upcoming events that are in the process of being scheduled. More information about attending a discussion session with the president can be found on the Carnegie Mellon website at http://www.cmu.edu/leadership.

As an insider of the war in Afghanistan, former U.S. Army Lieutenant General and former Ambassador to Afghanistan Karl Eikenberry spoke last Friday about the limits of American political intervention to Pittsburgh community members, Carnegie Mellon students, faculty, and families.
University President Subra Suresh introduced Eikenberry before his lecture, which took place in McConomy Auditorium and was a part of Cèilidh Weekend.
Using examples from his experience in Afghanistan, Eikenberry stressed that making Afghanistan a better place to live is a good goal, but should not be of national importance. 
According to Eikenberry, military leaders stressed that there was no other option other than the one that they took in directly entering Afghanistan and influencing change in terms of the country’s economy, educational standards, health care, and system of governance.
In his lecture, Eikenberry addressed and tested three assumptions of Field Manual 3-24, one of many field manuals that outline army tactics, techniques, and procedures. 
He primarily focused on the effectiveness of the counterinsurgency (COIN) operation, which involved suppressing rebellion.
The first assumption was that the COIN doctrine goal would protect the Afghani population with a perimeter that distinguished “bad guys from good guys.” Secondly, the Afghan government would become more legitimate and accountable with higher levels of American support. Lastly, COIN doctrine — as applied in Afghanistan — was aligned with the political military approach of the Afghanistan President Hamid Karzai’s administration.
Eikenberry asked audience members to raise their hands for what they believed would be positive and effective goals for supporting the Afghani people. The audience was in favor of protecting the Afghani population against the Taliban and NARCO traffickers while increasing employment levels and providing health care.
Protection against venal police chiefs, Eikenberry pointed out, is a more divisive issue because of the complicated nature of whom to protect the Afghani people from. The predatory dominant tribe has friends in the Karzai administration, and the lesser tribe has taken to the Taliban for help.
Eikenberry posed the question: Is it the United States’ role to get engaged in that international fight?
“These are the questions that every day on the ground, your soldiers, your diplomats are struggling over,” he said.
In addressing the second claim of Field Manual 3-24, Eikenberry questioned the argument that increased military support over time would fix the Afghan government.
“The government of Afghanistan today draws about 7 percent of their GDP, almost all of that comes from custom polls.… The people are not being taxed. The services that are being provided, 80 percent is coming from the international payroll, or international donations,” he said.
The third assumption was that moving forward with a counterinsurgency strategy will be embraced by that nation’s leader. “I’ll tell you, in Afghanistan, this was not the case,” Eikenberry said.
Eikenberry posited that one reason for the lack of embrace of COIN strategies was differences in geopolitical framework. “There was a domestic political problem that traces back to Afghanistan’s history in being ruled by various powers.”
Eikenberry also spoke of the limits of American intervention by pointing out the risks of blindly committing to the statements outlined in the field manual without any consideration for other costs or repercussions.
“Extended military campaigns that are priced in the trillion-dollar range, as this one in Iraq had been, carry with them many other high national security costs,” he said.
“The war in Afghanistan has demonstrated, in my mind, that in the thrall of wanted agility and resourcefulness of our American forces, the risk of senior commanders becoming intellectually arrogant and comparably rigid is very real,” he continued.
Junior business administration major Alec Abitbol considered Eikenberry’s position regarding counterinsurgency. “General Eikenberry’s reflection on the strategy of counterinsurgency, defined by a focus on improving infrastructure and living conditions as opposed to military efforts, proposes a sentiment of regret for our involvement in the Middle East. [He brought] two important questions to mind: What if those resources had been spent domestically? [And] under what circumstances is international intervention a net negative for the U.S.?”
Eikenberry also pointed out that the seriousness and zeal with which the Field Manual 3-24 was applied, left little room for critical thought or questioning.
“However, the assumptions and risk analysis that underpin a plan must be continually challenged in a dynamic and complex conflict zone, lest commanders find themselves fighting the wrong war. Our military thought leaders must find a way to avoid this kind of trap in the future,” he said. 
Eikenberry, however, followed his statement with a counterargument — saying that out of this blind commitment has come a largely positive outcome. “Having said all of this, believe me, a lot of great things have been done and will be done in Afghanistan,” he said.
As an example, Eikenberry explained that 8 million children are in schools — something that he describes as “an impressive, impressive accomplishment.”
“Ambassador Eikenberry provided a critique of the counterinsurgency strategy of our U.S. military that has been applied since the mid-2000s in Iraq and Afghanistan, and he did so from a humanities and social science standpoint,” said Kiron Skinner, director of the Center of International Relations and Politics. “To me, there could be no better military leader to speak at Carnegie Mellon — he addressed a fundamental issue in asking ‘Is the U.S. military capable of rebuilding a nation and should that be what the U.S. military does?’ ”
“This was an important event during our Cèilidh Weekend, and to me, it represents Carnegie Mellon at its best to have a speaker who was speaking on a major set of issues facing our nation and the world from an interdisciplinary standpoint,” Skinner said. “I was also honored that our new president Dr. Suresh introduced Ambassador Eikenberry — to see that our president, as busy as he is during his first semester as president, is participating in our campus-wide effort for international issues was encouraging.”
Eikenberry’s lecture was sponsored by the Center for International Relations and Politics and supported by the Humanities Scholars Program, the Office of the Vice Provost for Education, the department of social and decision sciences, and the department of modern languages.

“Cities die. And then cities come back. Cities get flooded, cities get bombed, cities get burnt down, cities’ economies fail, but cities are resilient.”
That was the message from city council member and 2013 Democratic nominee for Pittsburgh mayor Bill Peduto in Baker Hall’s Giant Eagle Auditorium last Friday. Peduto’s lecture focused first on the history of Pittsburgh and its various stages of decline and renewal, and then on his plans as a mayoral candidate to continue the revitalization of the city.
Peduto is currently a city councilman; according to the Pittsburgh city government website, he is serving his third term and represents Pittsburgh’s East End, including the neighborhoods of Bloomfield, Oakland, Shadyside, Squirrel Hill, East Liberty, and Point Breeze.
Peduto’s lecture began with a brief history of Pittsburgh, from the time it was carved out of America’s virgin forests to its industrial boom in the early 20th century and subsequent economic slump. The problem with Pittsburgh during this time, Peduto said, was what he called the “David Lawrence strategy” of urban development.
Lawrence was mayor of Pittsburgh from 1946 to 1959, and later served as governor of Pennsylvania from 1959 to 1963. Lawrence, Peduto said, embraced the philosophy of top-down city development, which included the funding of large projects similar to the construction of Three Rivers Stadium and the Consol Energy Center.
“That was what their economic development strategy was. It was big. It was going to the North Side, tear out the North Side, put in a mall — Allegheny Center Mall. Go in to East Liberty, tear up the neighborhood, build a big race track around it and make it so it’s more of an automobile-driven area than it was. It was go in to the Hill District, tear down the Hill District, put in this development, and see what would happen around it,” he said.
This strategy, Peduto said, drove people out of Pittsburgh instead of having the intended effect of revitalizing the metropolis.
“We invested in a whole new system of highways, and what did that do? It created driveways for people to leave this city and move further out, and the investment dollars continued to be fewer and fewer,” Peduto said.
According to Peduto, during this time Pittsburgh “was leading the country in population loss and job loss. In fact, during the ’80s we lost more people than New Orleans lost after Katrina.”
Peduto plans to embrace a more bottom-up strategy that involves focusing on community development in areas such as East Liberty. Peduto is also focusing on education as a means of social mobility.
“We can reinvest in our infrastructure, the same way they did back in the old days; we can sustain jobs, and we can provide early education for all children. If you ask anyone in education what would get kids to break the cycle of poverty, it’s early childhood education,” he said.
At the end of his lecture, Peduto took questions from the audience — comprised of students, faculty, and Pittsburgh residents — and spoke more specifically about his plans if he were to be elected mayor.
“We’re going to be creating, within our new administration, an entire new bureau called the Bureau of Special Projects, which is going to work with our special interest community. Because it’s time we get back with them.”
Peduto’s message was one of hope for Pittsburgh; a hope that he will lead it to a point where the city is comparable with cities like Austin, Texas and Seattle, Wash.
He spoke as part of the Forum on Economic Development, which, according to pamphlets given out at the event, “research[es] the economic development strategies of major actors in the Southwest Pennsylvania area and the impact of their resulting actions on sustainable employment opportunities made available.”
The Forum on Economic Development is also responsible for “designing and developing programs and initiatives to generate jobs for those most impacted by the 300,000 manufacturing jobs lost in Pennsylvania since 2000: the undereducated, minority workers and people over age 50,” according to the brochure. 
Peduto, the Pittsburgh city government website says, is a “self-described ‘Reform Democrat’ , ” and wrote the “most comprehensive package of government reform legislation in Pittsburgh’s history.”
Peduto is also co-creator of the city’s Comprehensive Climate Action Plan, acting as the “champion of protecting and enhancing Pittsburgh’s new reputation as a leader in green initiatives,” according to the website.

CMU MAM program announces AMTLab
Carnegie Mellon University’s master of arts management (MAM) program announced the launch of its new Arts Management & Technology Laboratory (AMTLab).
AMTLab is a research center meant to provide top-level practices and technologies to art managers, technologists, and researchers in the MAM program.
In a university press release, Executive Director of AMTLab Brett Crawford said, “AMTLab serves as a resource to a field that has few options available to it. Perhaps most importantly, AMTLab stands to help solve critical questions facing today’s arts managers and technologists, while contributing to the innovations necessary for future effective application of technology in the arts management field.”
Along with Crawford, two Heinz College graduate students are leading the project. These students are tasked with developing and publicizing the site. One student will be chief editor, and the other will be chief coordinator. 
AMTLab has an online forum, www.amt-lab.org, which shares a blog with research updates from contributors and case studies of art organizations.
According to the press release, Director of the MAM program Kathryn Heidemann said, “Technology is now a function of all areas of arts management — no longer just IT departments — and this center helps our students as well as the greater arts community understand both the theoretical and practical intersections between arts management and technology.”
Graduate students awarded scholarships
The Department of Homeland Security’s CyberCorps Scholarship for Service (SFS) Program, the National Science Foundation, and the Department of Defense’s Information Assurance Scholarship Program (IASP) awarded 17 graduate students from Carnegie Mellon with cybersecurity scholarships. The IASP award went to two students from the Information Networking Institute (INI), while the SFS awards went to six students from INI and two students from the Heinz College.
According to a university press release, INI Director and Director of Education, Training and Outreach Dena Haritos Tsamitis said, “As future federal employees, the SFS and IASP scholars delve into challenging engineering and information assurance coursework and engage in interdisciplinary cybersecurity research. In addition to the emphasis on the technologies and strategies related to digital defense and offense, Carnegie Mellon’s cybersecurity curricula explore risk management, economics, and policy issues related to reducing vulnerability and securing our national information infrastructure.”
Carnegie Mellon is recognized by the National Security Agency and United States Cyber Command as a National Center for Academic Excellence in operations for the period 2013–18.
With cyberattacks on the rise, the U.S. government now values the training and retention of cybersecurity experts more than ever. Carnegie Mellon, recognized for its work in this field, has graduated over 160 students in the SFS program in the past decade.

Turi Alcoser, a Carnegie Mellon Class of 2012 graduate, died last Monday. His death was first reported Tuesday both officially via the university administration and by the student newspaper at Cornell University, where the 23-year-old was a Ph.D. student in the College of Engineering.
The San Antonio Express-News in Alcoser’s home town of San Antonio, Texas, reported Sunday that Alcoser’s death was a suicide. Unofficial sources confirmed this, although authorities at Cornell and several sources in Ithaca, N.Y., did not officially release a cause of death.
A short statement released by Cornell’s Vice President for Student and Academic Affairs, Susan Murphy, detailed Alcoser’s promising career as a researcher and expressed sadness at his sudden passing.
“On behalf of the entire Cornell community, I want to extend my deepest condolences to Turi’s family, friends, and colleagues,” Murphy wrote. “Please join me in taking a moment to remember Turi and acknowledge this unfortunate loss to our community.”
Alcoser graduated from Carnegie Mellon with a major in materials science and engineering and a minor in biomedical engineering. He entered Cornell in June 2012, where his Ph.D. work in biomedical engineering was on growing and characterizing the biophysical properties of breast cancer tumor cells, Murphy’s statement said.
Alcoser’s time at Carnegie Mellon was similarly marked by an interest in scientific research. He attended the university’s Summer Academy for Mathematics and Science (SAMS) program as a high schooler in 2007, then joined the university as a CIT undergraduate in fall 2008.
He was a 2009 participant in the biology department’s Summer Research Institute, mentored by biology professor Gordon Rule. Later, he conducted cancer cell research with Kris Dahl, an associate professor of Biomedical Engineering and Chemical Engineering.
“SAMS builds dreams that you would not have even thought of had you not come here,” Alcoser said in a July 2010 university press release. “My dream was specifically research.”
His work in the laboratory brought Alcoser accolades from two universities and beyond. His research with Dahl led to features on the Carnegie Mellon website and an imaging award from the Department of Materials Science and Engineering.
At Cornell, Alcoser was a Sloan Scholar and won an award from the Physical Sciences Oncology Network. This year, he was an honorable mention recipient of the National Science Foundation’s Graduate Research Fellowships.
“Turi was a student who was well-connected and beloved by many on our campus who knew him through his many contributions to the CMU community,” Carnegie Mellon Dean of Student Affairs Gina Casalegno said in an email. “He will be deeply missed by those faculty, students, staff and alumni whose lives he touched.”
In April 2011, Alcoser ran for Student Body President as an outsider, with Kelsey Briggs in the vice presidential slot. The candidates’ platform focused on health and wellness, collaboration between undergraduate and graduate students, and diversity.
Alcoser mentioned reducing student stress as a particularly important issue for him during the campaign. “I want to show that when I leave here from Carnegie Mellon, I recognized this problem and I did something about it,” he said in a March 2011 interview. The Alcoser-Briggs ticket was ultimately defeated by Jake Flittner and Sangita Sharma.
Increasing awareness of mental health issues on campus has been an ongoing process, Casalegno said Sunday.
“Turi’s passing is a reminder to us all that, while we can never know why someone’s life ends by suicide, we can join together to cultivate a caring, compassionate, and supportive community that provides resources and outreach to help individuals who are struggling,” she said.
Alcoser was also a member of Delta Tau Delta and a staffwriter for The Tartan.
Funeral services and burial will take place today at the Mission Burial Park South in San Antonio, according to an obituary in the San Antonio Express-News. Visitation and a prayer service were held last night.
At Carnegie Mellon, the Division of Student Affairs has offered to provide support and assistance to community members interested in participating in a memorial effort, Casalegno said. Anyone wishing to be involved can contact Casalegno at ginac@andrew.cmu.edu
Members of the campus community can also contact Counseling and Psychological Services 24 hours a day by calling 412-268-2922.

Fiscal Close Presentation from SBVPF Poteat
During this week’s Senate meeting, Student Body Vice President of Finance Jalen Poteat, a junior statistics major, gave a presentation on how the Joint Funding Committee (JFC) completed its fiscal close process at the end of the spring semester, which also marked the end of Carnegie Mellon’s fiscal year.
Poteat spoke of how leftover funds — previously allocated for specific organizations by the JFC — were dealt with, and explained what happened to organizations that had overspent their JFC accounts. 
According to Poteat, organizations that overspent will remain in good standing if the organization used money that had rolled over from the previous fiscal year, if the organization is supervised, or if the organization is on controlled probation.
Poteat talked about the process for helping organizations in debt, which includes a weekly meeting between Poteat and the leaders of organizations on controlled probation.
Booth Theme
The first meeting about booths for Spring Carnival was on Wednesday. Next year the new Tepper building will be breaking ground in the Morewood parking lot. Because of this, Spring Carnival will be relocated. Senators discussed where the best places to hold Carnival in the future.
Future Town Hall
The Senate executive committee discussed holding a town hall meeting in light of the fact that Senate Week is changing this year. It will shift its focus in order to encourage students to attend Senate general body meetings.
Senators have not agreed on a theme for the proposed town hall meeting, but they discussed several options. Options include campus unity, campus stress culture, and faculty course evaluations. Senators also suggested a town hall meeting with a more open and fun format, rather than the traditional formal town hall setting.

According to a recent article in The Economist, the United States is facing a strange trend: Gun violence has been decreasing overall, but the number of mass shootings has been increasing. In the past 20 years, deaths from mass shootings have risen from less than 0.05 per 1 million people to over 0.22. While this number is still small enough that Americans have no reason to panic when going to theaters or sending their children to school, this rise in the rate of mass shooting deaths reveals that there is most certainly an underlying problem.
For those who have never been exposed to guns, it is hard to imagine a world where everyone owns one, and to understand what purpose guns carry. However, according to a Gallup Poll conducted in October 2011, 47 percent of American adults own at least one firearm. Despite the fact that this is the highest rate since 1993, The Economist points out that gun crimes have been cut in half over the past 20 years, from around seven homicides per 100,000 people to 3.6. To state that gun ownership is directly related to violent crimes makes no sense at all, as the correlation between them appears to be negative.
One explanation for this increase in mass shootings is far from hidden. In fact, it stares in the face of Americans every time they pick up a newspaper or turn on the news: the glamorization of mass shooters. News media networks are publicizing these criminals like never before. If one began a conversation with a random person on the street regarding a recent mass shooting, chances are that person would be easily able to name the shooter but would struggle to name even one of their victims.
One particularly disturbing example of news glamorization was the Aug. 1 edition of Rolling Stone. On its cover was a close-up of the Boston Marathon bomber, Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, staring from the page like a celebrity that deserved the public eye. 
Many Americans were outraged. Boston Mayor Thomas Menino responded in a letter to Rolling Stone, stating that the cover sends the message that “destruction gains fame for killers and their ‘causes.’” His words, according to CNN, summarized the feelings of many: “The survivors of the Boston attacks deserve Rolling Stone cover stories, though I no longer feel that Rolling Stone deserves them.”
Sadly, however, U.S. News & World Report says that putting this homicidal maniac on its cover increased the sales of Rolling Stone by 102 percent. Therefore, media companies alone cannot take the blame, as they are merely delivering the content that Americans wish to consume. These crimes will only continue to increase until Americans would rather read the stories of those who lost their lives in mass shootings, instead of the stories of the culprits behind these unspeakable crimes.
Taking away the guns of the other 99 percent of Americans that are mentally stable enough not to carry a firearm into a school or mall will do nothing. As such, the recent increase in mass shootings is not as simple of an issue as gun control. It is as complex as society, and it reveals the true problem that Americans would rather read about the people who massacre than those who attempt to save the victims.

The House GOP is currently intent on defunding the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, more commonly known as Obamacare. Obamacare will likely remain funded and intact through this crisis, but the fact remains that it is an awful piece of legislation that should be replaced. In order to understand how to replace Obamacare, we must first understand what deficiencies our healthcare system had before Obamacare’s passage, and what deficiencies Obamacare itself has.
Obamacare was created to protect those who were disenfranchised by the current system, and make healthcare generally more affordable. These are noble goals, and they underscore two main problems with our healthcare system pre-Obamacare. There were a lot of people who couldn’t get health insurance, such as those with pre-existing conditions, as well as those who didn’t get health insurance through their employers and were unable to afford it themselves. Additionally, sometimes people’s insurance failed to cover the scope of their problems and they were left with exorbitant out-of-pocket costs. These problems can be summed up simply: Sometimes people who needed healthcare couldn’t get it, but most people who needed healthcare were getting it under the old system.
Obamacare tries to solve these problems by making everyone get health insurance that covers a wider range of problems, so that there would be more money in the system. The legislation also eliminates some of the ways that providers change their prices, so that those with pre-existing conditions could get insurance. Additionally, it provides a marketplace with subsidies for those who cannot afford insurance to get healthcare. Finally, it regulates employers so that they have to offer more insurance to more people.
These provisions sound great, but Obamacare has a lot of unintended consequences. To pay for the subsidies, taxes are increasing on health savings accounts and medical devices, which increases the overall cost of healthcare. Employers are cutting employees’ hours because they cannot afford to give part-time employees insurance. Young people are being forced to buy plans that cover far more than they need, increasing their premiums drastically. As a result, many people may pay the cheaper fine rather than get coverage. This will eliminate the crux of Obamacare, which is a massive redistribution of wealth from young, healthy people to old, sick people.
So, given that both systems are flawed, the best way to augment the pre-Obamacare system is to have the government cover preventative and catastrophic care. This sounds socialistic — and it is — but the most efficient insurance scheme is one that involves everyone. Taxes can be adjusted to progressively cover this system, but we are moving into a society where healthcare is being considered a right. As such, we need to begin to work it into our government. This proposed system could additionally replace Medicare and Medicaid to work more efficiently.
This proposed system’s benefits are numerous. First, covering preventative care lowers overall costs because diseases with high costs in later stages are caught sooner. There are elements of this tactic in Obamacare, but we need to embrace this efficient tactic fully. Finally, most health insurance horror stories come from catastrophic care. If the government covers catastrophic care, there will be no hitting limits to coverage with stage four cancer or other debilitating diseases that give the pre-Obamacare system a bad name. This proposed system also gives consumers the ability to shop around for insurance for things like a broken finger or strep throat. This system keeps costs down for routine diseases and procedures, but takes care of everyone in the event that something seriously bad happens.
This potential system is far more efficient than pre-Obamacare and Obamacare because it maintains the benefits of a market system, while taking care of everyone that needs to be taken care of. It will be a tough sell to America, but to ensure a future of happy, healthy, and prosperous citizens, this proposal is the right move for our healthcare system.

Back in 2006, Twitter started as a side project by founder Jack Dorsey as a hedge against his dormant startup Odeo. Fast forward seven years, and Twitter has become one of the biggest names in social media. Along with Facebook, Twitter brought the very notion of social networking to the masses. Some sources, like telegraph.co.uk, estimate that Twitter has 200 million active users. In a couple of months, Twitter will face its biggest challenge yet — the infamous initial public offering (IPO).
At worst, IPOs can destroy companies; at best, they can bring about significant change in company culture. The prospect of quarterly earnings, shareholder pressure, and activist investors can paralyze an organization and shift its focus away from innovating on its core platform. Just look at Facebook to see how painful an IPO can be. Facebook has had an incredibly rocky first year as a public company. Its stock dropped to below half its IPO price in August according to The Huffington Post, and Facebook is still trading at a price not much above its IPO price. Won’t Twitter be affected in the same way that Facebook has been?
Twitter is well-positioned to avoid these pitfalls and emerge as a healthier, more diverse company following a public offering.
One of the primary reasons Facebook’s stock tumbled is that it didn’t have a credible revenue model for mobile devices a year ago. Knowing how to monetize mobile capabilities is of paramount importance for an Internet company, since the majority of future growth in the technology industry will come from smartphones and tablets running operating systems like iOS and Android. Twitter, on the other hand, has been monetizing mobile capabilities for as long as it has been financially viable. This year, mobile advertisements are expected to account for 55 percent of Twitter’s revenue, according to Mediabistro.com. In fact, Twitter was originally conceived as a mobile platform that allowed users to use text messages to tell groups what they were doing. In other words, Twitter’s future is far more secure than Facebook’s was one year ago.
Another large difference between Facebook and Twitter’s IPOs has more to do with the IPOs themselves. Facebook’s IPO was highly publicized — one of the most hyped IPOs in history. Facebook also set a relatively high initial IPO price of $38. The impending Twitter IPO is a decidedly lower key affair. The announcement was made, in characteristic fashion, through a tweet: “We’ve confidentially submitted an S-1 to the S.E.C. for a planned IPO.” Through this ingenious move, Twitter announced that it planned to go public while withholding every other detail about the IPO. Goldman Sachs will underwrite the offering, according to The Wall Street Journal, and the stock will be priced and executed to have shareholder appreciation, thus sidestepping Facebook’s most significant IPO flub. By not setting any public expectations from its IPO, Twitter avoids public disappointment.
Most importantly, an IPO is a foundation for the company Twitter wants to be tomorrow. If it is to continue to grow at the rate it has, Twitter needs to ramp up investment in its future products. The best way to generate that kind of cash is through an IPO. 
Twitter today is a social network for personal use. Twitter tomorrow is a global, real-time news and entertainment network centered around its core platform, but with a variety of other successful products including Twitter Music and Vine, as well as products under development in markets, including local discovery and TV advertising.
Will the IPO be a disaster, or will it be a much needed catalyst to enter new markets? Although nobody knows, I’d wager my money on the latter.

Last year, when I attended high school at Phillips Academy outside of Boston, the math and economics department made moves toward using online textbooks and online homework assignments. This trend of going online — with the suggestion that online learning is superior to traditional learning — seems to have continued into college.
To be blunt, online textbooks are counterproductive, inconvenient trash. What’s even worse? Online homework. Scrap convenience. Scrap accessibility. Online reading and homework just isn’t working well for me, and I’m sure it isn’t working for many other college students out there. Online homework does not improve the academic experience or performance, and a reversion to traditional pen and paper would probably help students learn better.
There are, of course, some advantages that come along with online textbooks. They save paper. There’s no denying the good that saving paper does. Online learning also allows all textbooks to be centralized in one Internet browser. Third, they come with interactive features. Students can take notes on their computers, all of which can be saved and accessed digitally. Students can quiz themselves and watch videos about concepts they have trouble comprehending. If students are susceptible to losing homework assignments, like myself, online hubs allow students to keep them in one, easy place. Lastly, online learning should, in theory, be a lot cheaper. Textbook companies are supporting a server, not printing thousands of textbooks.
It all sounds wonderful. Right? My professors seem to think so. Out of the four textbook-based classes I am taking this semester, three use some form of online textbook or homework assignments. Many introductory math classes require WebAssign. Principles of Economics requires Aplia.
Colleges seem to think online textbooks are wonderful too: Digital textbooks may make up more than 11 percent of textbook revenue in the United States this year, according to senior analyst Kathy Micky of Simba Information in The New York Times.
This should all be good news. For subjects like chemistry, mathematics, and economics, however, online homework is frustrating. There is practically no room to take notes in the margins of readings. Need an answer? There’s no option to keep your finger on the answer page to check if you’re right after finishing problems. All of that is now within the depths of a computer screen. The formula is 20 clicks away, and answers are almost impossible to retrieve without opening a second tab — probably another 20 clicks.
WebAssign is a classic example of how counterproductive online learning can be. For multiple-choice questions, it’s easy to click random buttons and achieve perfect scores. While this random clicking is a marginal blessing for QPAs and stress levels, students do not actually learn — they guess.
The fact that WebAssign and Aplia spit out ticks and crosses for correctness encourages students to become complacent. The answers don’t come back with a teacher or professor’s feedback. The website won’t explain what’s wrong, where students made mistakes, or how they can improve. Yes, there are office hours, but professors see students’ progress through a computer screen of scores, and not by the way they solve problems.
In the 21st century, where iPads can access thousands of books through several touches, online homework seems to be the next logical step, and maybe it is. But online learning needs to be reformatted so that it preserves all the advantages of paper, along with the advantages that the Internet and multimedia bring. The same needs to be applied to online textbooks to make their use more fluid. 
I would rather break my back lugging around textbooks than paying nearly the same amount for access to a website that won’t give me the same quality education.

October is Breast Cancer Awareness Month. Breast cancer is a national threat to women and men that deserves care and consideration, but it may not necessitate as much attention as various awareness foundations have given it compared to other conditions.
Issue awareness has gained popularity in the age of the Internet, but awareness often promotes little change. Breast cancer awareness has become more of a commercial asset than a movement, according to The Guardian, with companies placing pink ribbons on products to appear socially conscious. 
However, this lack of true action is not the biggest problem of the breast cancer awareness campaign; it’s disturbing side is its sexualization of women’s health. 
sOne of breast cancer awareness’s most famous slogans is “Save the Boobs,” which appeared in a breast cancer awareness advertisement created by Canadian TV Host and MTV host Aliya-Jasmine Sovani. Breast cancer gets some of its attention because it deals with women’s breasts — and sex sells. This sort of marketing subtly implies that the breasts are the part of a woman that are most worth saving — not her brain, nor  her  heart. 
Even more telling is that prostate cancer does not benefit from this intensified focus on a disease that affects sexual or sexualized organs. According to The Daily Caller, breast cancer receives far more funding than prostate cancer; breast cancer research received $872 million in federal funding while prostate cancer research received only $390 million in 2009. Yet, the American Cancer Society expects similar numbers of new cases in 2013  — 234,580 new cases of breast cancer and 238,590 new cases of prostate cancer.
Breast cancer isn’t even the biggest threat to women’s health — heart disease is, followed by lung cancer, according to The Huffington Post. So then why is it that heart disease doesn’t receive the same attention that breast cancer does?
Breast cancer is a potentially lethal disease that certainly deserves attention in funding, but not more so than equally dangerous diseases; and creating a sexualized campaign, although effective, is not admirable.
Editorial Dissent
Michael Setzer, SciTech Editor
Breast cancer campaigns have absolutely no reason to stifle their voices. Furthermore, the assumption that a decrease in pushing breast cancer awareness will lead to an increase in knowledge of other diseases is fallacious.
It seems obvious that the term awareness refers to education of statistics regarding the disease, preventative measures, and testing available to women. 
According to CBS News, the overwhelming majority of fatal breast cancers occur in women who have not had a mammogram.
According to health and medicine website Medscape, the survival rate of breast cancer has greatly increased in the past 10 years. 
New treatments and early detection — both of which can be at least partially attributed to successful breast cancer campaigns — are main reasons behind increased treatment and survival.
The initiatives taken by organizations such as Susan G. Komen for the Cure are admirable and smart. As other organizations show, it’s very difficult to raise money and promote awareness and education about the disease in question. 
Breast cancer awareness advocates have created successful campaigns that have ultimately led to significant results; why should we fault them on this?

One would think Pittsburgh’s ethics hearing board would have more to do. When Mayor Luke Ravenstahl overhauled the city’s ethics code in 2009, hopes were high that the board would provide government transparency and regulate ethics on a level that Pittsburgh had never seen before — and although the ethics board had been around before 2009, it was then revitalized and made itself known in order to uphold these new doctrines.
Today, the board struggles to determine its purpose, with no help from the rest of the city’s government.
The five-person board has shrunk to two people, as the mayor failed to appoint his own members or approve those nominated by City Council. 
According to the 2009 legislation, city employees must disclose gifts they receive that are over $100 on a designated website — but since 2009, only one such divulgence was made. The board is supposed to hold annual ethics training sessions for many city employees, but none has been held since 2010. The board’s “website,” which is only a small subspace on the mayor’s own site, says “Meetings are held, as scheduled below, at 10:00 a.m....” There are no meetings listed.
If members of Pittsburgh’s government think that the board is ineffective, then they should disband it. If they think it could stand to do some good with proper direction and power, they should give it legal representation and more influence. The worst possible action is the one they’re making now: to shirk responsibility and let the ethics board fall into disrepair.
Why Ravenstahl would push for the ethics board’s restoration and then not appoint or approve new members is anyone’s guess. As it stands, though, the board has nothing to do and no one to do it. According to the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette, the Pittsburgh City Law Department takes care of most cases on ethics, and the ethics board doesn’t have its own attorney even if it wanted to get involved.
Yes, Ravenstahl is getting ready to leave — but he and the rest of the city council should finish what they started when they revitalized the city’s ethics board.
