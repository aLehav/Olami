The Carnegie Mellon women’s tennis team faced off against the defending President’s Athletic Conference (PAC) champions Westminster College on Monday. The Tartans dominated the Titans in a convincing 9–0 victory.
The duo of senior Brooke Tsu and first-year Marina Selenica started the day with an 8–0 win in second doubles. Junior Margaret Anne Smith and sophomore Katie Lai also won 8–0, scoring the second point for the Tartans in third doubles. Sophomore Cori Sidell and first-year Minami Makino closed out doubles play, taking first doubles 8–2 to give the Tartans a comfortable 3–0 lead.
Tsu won her singles match without giving up a single game to give the Tartans a 4–0 lead, winning 6–0, 6–0. Senior Abbey Hamstra scored the deciding point in sixth singles, winning 6–0, 6–1. The Tartans finished up the competition without giving a single point up to their opponents.
The Tartans took the court at home on Saturday to face off against 13th-ranked Washington and Lee University. The 11th-ranked Tartans defended their position in the standings against the Generals in a close set of matches that came down to the final round of singles play. The Tartans were victorious with a score of 5–4.
Doubles began with the Generals coming out ahead, but the pair of Tsu and first-year Jamie Vizelman quickly answered with a point of their own in second doubles, winning the match 8–4. The Tartans then took control of the lead as the tandem of Hamstra and junior Nicholle Torres finished third doubles with a close 8–6 win to end doubles play.
Makino started off singles play by scoring a point for the Tartans in the fifth position, winning 6–3, 6–4. This put the Tartans up 3–1, but first, second, and sixth singles were all heading into a third set, and the Generals were ahead on the other two courts. 
Carnegie Mellon still had to put up a fight before they could take home the victory, but the Generals found wins in first and third singles to tie the match at 3–3.
However, Torres came in with a comeback win in second singles to give the Tartans another lead, winning 2–6, 6–2, 7–5. 
The Generals quickly answered and re-tied the match at 4–4 in sixth singles. Vizelman was the clutch player of the night though, and she took fourth singles in an intense match by forcing a third set and winning a tiebreaker, 4–6, 7–6 (7–5), 7–6 (7–5).
The Tartans are now 11–5 in the season, and will next take on Washington College at home on Friday, April 1 at 4 p.m to continue their run.

On Friday and Saturday, the Carnegie Mellon men’s and women’s track and field teams hosted the Carnegie Mellon Mini Invitational. Both teams came in first place out of five competing schools, besting the men’s and women’s teams from Waynesburg University, Denison University, Allegheny College, and Franciscan University.
The Tartan men finished with 311 points after winning 11 events. Sophomore thrower Jacob Schofel won the hammer throw on Friday evening with a career-best mark of 52.33 meters, which is the third best throw in school history. First-year thrower Kenny Sladick and sophomore thrower David Trzcinski also contributed to scoring in the hammer throw with career best efforts. Sladick finished third overall with a 40.47 meter throw while Trzcinski recorded a 39.65 meter mark good for fourth place. 
Trzcinski took second in the shot put with a throw of 14.03 meters and Sladick turned in a third-place showing in the discus with a mark of 36.52 meters. First-year sprinter and jumper Rai Walters placed first in the long jump with a 6.57 meter effort, a record for the longest jump in the invitational’s history. Sophomore jumper and sprinter Matthew Seifu came in third with 6.28 meters. First-year jumper Eloy Fernandez placed second in the triple jump with a mark of 12.98 meters. Junior pole vaulter Kyle Waver took second in the pole vault after clearing the bar at 3.73 meters, while senior pole vaulter Victor Yan tied for third at the same mark due to the judge’s decision. First-year jumper Reed Farber and sophomore sprinter and jumper Cameron Smith both cleared the high jump at 1.81 meters. The judge’s decision gave Farber second place while Smith took third.
The 4x100 relay team of Seifu, junior sprinter Zachary Blonder, senior sprinter Jeff Chen, and first-year sprinter Christopher Bayley finished first with a time of 44.25 seconds. Chen proceeded to win the 200-meter dash with a personal best 23.09 second time and finished second in the 100-meter dash in a career best 11.30 seconds. Bayley placed third in the 200 and fourth in the 100 with times of 23.73 and 11.59 seconds. Junior mid-distance runner Curtis Watro won the 1,500-meter run with a time of 3:59.82, a career-best time and a record time in the invitational’s history. 
The Tartans swept the top three spots in the 110-meter hurdles. Junior hurdler and jumper Don Boyer won the event with a time of 15.97. Junior hurdler Matthew Sheh took second in 16.48 and first-year hurdler George Viccaro finished third in 16.55 seconds. First-year mid-distance runner Isaac Mills cleared the 400-meter run in a meet record time of 50.52 to win the event while junior sprinter Jonathan Perry crossed in 51.62 to place second. Junior mid-distance runner Owen Norley won the 800-meter run, crossing in 1:54.11. Senior mid-distance runner Marc-Daniel Julien finished in second after 1:55.17, followed by sophomore mid-distance runner Evan Larrick whose 1:56.12 time earned him third place. 
In the 5,000-meter run, first-year distance runner William Mitchell crossed first in 15:28.85. First-year distance runner Liam Walsh placed second in 15:29.34, and junior mid-distance runner Gordon Pace took third in 15:44.45. In the 4x400-meter relay, Bayley, Chen, Perry, and Norley finished in first place with a 3:25.24 time.
The Tartan women earned 245 points off of their 10 first-place finishes during the invitational. First-year jumper Tessa Allen broke an 18-year old school record after clearing the bar at 1.59 meters in the high jump. Junior hurdler and jumper Rebecca Fortner took third with a 1.54 meter mark. 
Allen later won the triple jump with a 10.40 meter jump while first-year jumper and sprinter Autumn Hair placed third at 9.83 meters. First-year sprinter and jumper Debarati Bhanja placed first in the long jump with a school record tying 5.47 meter mark. Hair placed second with 5.07 meters while junior sprinter and jumper Jerilyn James took third with 4.84 meters. Sophomore thrower Kiersten Chuc won the hammer throw with a career-best distance of 39.54 meters. First-year thrower Oly Nwankwo made a career best 32.12 meter throw to finish fourth. Junior pole vaulter Grace Yee cleared 3.28 meters to win the pole vault.
Senior mid-distance runner Taylor Maggiacomo recorded a personal-best time of 12:12.25 in the 3,000-meter steeplechase. The 4x100-meter relay team of James, Hair, Bhanja and sophomore sprinter Sarah Cook crossed in 50.21 to place first. Senior mid-distance runner Liz Snyder and senior distance runner Natalie Smith earned first and second place points, respectively, for their fourth and fifth place performances in the 1,500-meter run. Snyder finished in 4:54.90 while Smith took 5:02.74. Cook turned in a meet record and personal-best time of 2:17.11 in the 800-meter race to win the event. 
In the 400-meter run, junior sprinter Ariel Tian crossed in 1:01.63 to place second. Junior hurdler and jumper Sommer Farber and Fotner took second and third in the 100-meter hurdles with times of 16.65 and 17.02, respectively. Bhanja placed second in the 100- and 200-meter dashes with times of 13.32 and 26.14. 
James finished third in the respective events with times of 13.40 and 27.32. The 4x400-meter relay team of Bhanja, Tian, first-year sprinter, mid-distance runner, and hurdler Rose Ciriello, and Cook crossed in 4:01.36, a meet record that gave the team their 10th victory of the event.
The Tartan men and women will be back to run again at Gesling Stadium on April 2 when they host their annual Quad Meet beginning at 10 a.m.

March is coming to an end, and late March means later March Madness. But what’s important about late March Madness? Well, it generally depends on your perspective.
Maybe you’ve gone through the drill. Every March, 68 teams battle for the NCAA DI Championship in a single elimination tournament. A huge number of people fill out brackets, where they try to guess all of the tournament results. No one successfully guesses the result, because there is a one in sextillion chance of doing that, and basketball games tend to be influenced by luck.
So where does that leave things as March wraps up? Is it over? Well, not quite. The final four teams, “The Final Four” in sport lingo, are still around. Two more games are left for this week, and one more game after will decide the national champion in early April.
At press time, Villanova and Oklahoma have locked up their spots in the Final Four, but two more spots need to be decided. North Carolina (UNC) has a showdown with Notre Dame, and Virginia (UVA) faces off with Syracuse for the last two slots. So that leaves the biggest question: what’s your stake in all of this? Let’s start at the top:
You’ll need some teams to root for, and there’s no easy choice, given that these are the best remaining teams in the country. So here are a few metrics to help you rank the teams, and help you with your decisions if you happen to be watching a game this week. If you’re simple and don’t know much about the game, color ranking may be for you.
There are two basic groups to the color rankings, the orange hues and the blue hues. That leaves Notre Dame, with a not quite matching green and yellow uniform that leaves this category wanting.
If you’re more of a red/orange fan, you’re going to want Syracuse first. The slick orange uniform is probably the only one of its kind left in the dance, and UVA’s blocky design sets it a little back here. Oklahoma’s flat red leaves the most to be desired in the group, with a somewhat simple design.
On the other hand, if you’re a blue person, things seem to point in Villanova’s direction. UNC and Villanova might seem pretty similar if you’re looking at their white alternate uniforms, but as soon as you see that UNC baby blue, you’ll know what team is playing.
Just to keep things simple in case you aren’t sure whether you prefer blue or orange, I think a solid ordering would be Syracuse, Villanova, UVA, Notre Dame, Oklahoma, and finally UNC.
Alternatively, maybe a statistical approach is more up the Carnegie Mellon alley. Real rankings need to proportionally combine location bias with actual statistical evidence. For this, there are probably two things that will come in handy. A scoring index, ranking the teams based on their average margin of victory (because points win games), and a proximity index, which will rank the teams based on how close their campuses are to Carnegie Mellon.
For scoring, we have Villanova on top with an average win of 13.9. UNC (13.1), UVA (11.4), Oklahoma (10.1), Syracuse (5.5), and Notre Dame (5.1) follow. There seem to be two clear echelons, with four teams averaging a comfy 10 point lead per game, for a lot of easy wins, where Syracuse and Notre Dame have lived a bit closer to the struggle. Distance data gives a very different ordering. In distance, we have UVA on top, only 184 miles away. We then have Villanova (244), Syracuse (267), UNC (329), Notre Dame (339), and far away Oklahoma (1018). The straight approach would be to combine the rankings, just by adding the places to get a final ordering. If you like this idea, you’re left with Villanova as your top pick, followed by UVA, UNC, Syracuse, Oklahoma, and Notre Dame. But the underdog approach is so much more exciting! In this approach distance will be multiplied by score differential to proportionally bias towards teams with closer proximity, and tighter score differentials. Lowest scores are the best. Final Ranks: Syracuse 1469, Notre Dame 1729, UVA 2098, Villanova 3392, UNC 4304, and last but not least Oklahoma 10282.
So if you’re looking for a team to root for in the final games of the NCAA tournament, there’s plenty of things to consider in choosing your favorite. Be sure to catch the madness over the next couple weeks, and see if your predictions come true.

Readability analyses are usually utilized by teachers to select appropriate reading materials for students, but researchers at Carnegie Mellon’s Language Technologies Institute, including principle systems scientist Maxine Eskenazi and graduate research assistant Elliot Schumacher, are interested in applying readability analysis methods to another area of natural language: presidential campaign speeches. 
The readability analyses of campaign speeches from the 2016 United States presidential election campaign shows that the candidates’ choice of words generally ranged from an eighth-grade level to a tenth-grade level. The exception to this conclusion was businessman Donald Trump, who speaks at a seventh-grade level. When comparing speeches of past presidents, they found that George W. Bush had the lowest grammatical level, with a 5th-grade average, and Abraham Lincoln the highest, who ranked far above a 10th grade level. Among the candidates, grade-level speech patterns are between sixth and seventh grade, except for Trump. From their analysis paper, readability of a document is defined as the reading level, from grade one to grade 12. 
“[A candidate’s grade level] is determined by looking at the lexical contents and the grammatical structure of the sentences in a document,” Eskenazi said in a Language Technologies Institute press release. “It is based on the observation that some words (and grammatical structures) appear with greater frequency at one grade level than another. For example, we would expect that we could see the word ‘win’ fairly frequently in third grade documents while the word ‘successful’ would be more frequent in, say, seventh grade documents. We would not see dependent clauses very often at the second grade level, whereas they would be quite frequent at the seventh grade level.”
Researchers use a readability model, REAP, for this analysis. This model uses lexical components (word choice) and grammatical constructions (syntactical complexity) to measure a certain individual’s speech grade-level. The model is based on a database that contains sets of texts for each grade level. Texts mostly come from written assignments that teachers have published on their websites from students of each grade level. The model analyzes two aspects of readability: lexical and grammatical. 
The lexical reading difficulty measure is based on the smoothed individual probabilities of words occurring at each reading level. The grammar reading difficulty measure is based on typical grammatical constructions in the sentences of each grade level.
“Assessing the readability of campaign speeches is a little tricky because most measures are geared to the written word, yet text is very different from the spoken word,” Eskenazi said. “When we speak, we usually use less structured language with shorter sentences. The readability measure we use looks at how often words and grammatical structures occur at each level (Flesch-Kincaid looked at length of sentences and words). In this way, the measures we used are a bit more reflective of any type of language, written or spoken.” One of the main issues was the tension between written language grade-levels and those of spoken language, which tends to be more conversational, and thus less complex. 
In order to standardize, the researchers made adjustments to reflect language as a whole, incorporating both spoken and written language in their analyses.
Researchers also computed the standard deviation of lexical and grammatical grade level for each candidate. The result reveals the degree to which the candidate changes their choice of words from one speech to another. Researchers note that Hillary Clinton, for words, and Trump, for grammar, have the most variabile levels from one speech to another. 
This could indicate that they are the candidates who are trying the most to be well understood by their audience.  Researchers are continuing to add more speeches to their database. “With more speeches and speeches of different candidates before the same audience, we may learn something more,” Eskenazi said.

Currently, researchers’ understanding of cell communication has been limited to two dimensions due to the fact that the electrical activity of cultured cells has only been done in a two-dimensional dish. However, one researcher at Carnegie Mellon has recently won a National Science Foundation (NSF) award for trying to kick things off the surface. 
Tzahi Cohen-Karni, an assistant professor of biomedical engineering and materials science and engineering at Carnegie Mellon, is researching how cells communicate through electrical activity in three dimensions through the use of nanosensors. Cohen-Karni recently received an NSF CAREER Award entitled “3-D Nanosensors Array for Elucidating the Electrical Activity of Induced Pluripotent Stem Cells Derived Cardiomyocytes” for his research.
“We are not two-dimensional,” Cohen-Karni said in an interview with The Tartan. “Our excitable media is the brain: three-dimensions, essentially. So if we wanted to know how cells talk to each other, the most straightforward way is to look into three dimensions. There’s a bunch of professors around biomedical engineering that work on 3-D constructs, but now we’re trying to fuse sensors in with it.”
Instead of working with two-dimensional petri dishes, Cohen-Karni’s method works with microtissues. Specifically, he works with induced pluripotent cells, or stem cells which are capable of differentiating into many other types. These cells were derived from muscle cells from heart tissue (iPS-CM), with sensors to monitor electrophysiology. 
“We are trying to create microtissues and then capture these inside three-dimensional assembly of sensors. The sensors themselves will be assembled in space in three dimensions,” Cohen-Karni said.
In order to surround the microtissue, the sensors are attached to a strip of polymer on a chip lined with thin strips of metal, which serve as leads and lift the polymer from the chip’s surface, where the sensors can then take measurements from all sides.
In the last 30–40 years, sensing units were usually laid onto a surface. For example, the Michigan probe, a needle-like probe that measures neural activity directly from the brain, has many points of detection, but still lies on a plane. “We’re trying to kick stuff off the surface,” Cohen-Karni said. “We’ll have an arrangement of sensing units in a barrel shape with x, y, z coordinates.”
All the materials used to create the microtissue and sensors are synthesized in Cohen-Karni’s lab at the Pittsburgh Technology Council. They synthesize nanowires and semiconductors that are silicon-based materials a thousand times smaller than a human hair and fabricate field effect transistors out of them. The lab also uses graphene, a single layer of hexagonally arranged carbon atoms, to make the sensors.
“We are not married to any of the materials we are using,” said Cohen-Karni.
After they synthesize materials, it is transported to the recently opened Scott Hall, where a majority of their experiments take place. 
“It’s a multi-layer of complexity. Students in my lab are designing not just the sensing units, but are also working on the apparatus to measure these units.” Graduate students have the flexibility to change both the geometry of the devices themselves and of the microtissues the devices sense. 
The NSF CAREER Award comes with a grant of $500,000 that will be used to further develop 3-D nanosensors array for elucidating the electrical activity of induced pluripotent stem cells, derived cardiomyocytes. 
“It’s instrumental, I have to admit,” Cohen-Karni said. “It’s not about the finance itself. The biggest thing is that the NSF basically acknowledged that this is something important that researchers have to work on. And of course, the financial support is very important but I think the acknowledgement of the research and the outreach plan of the proposal got their attention more than anything. It’s recognition that we here at CMU do interesting stuff.” 
In the future, Cohen-Karni hopes to expand this research to look at diseased brain and cardiac cells, where they can branch out to investigate different diseases and potentially do drug screenings based on the electrophysiology of the diseased cells. 
“We are developing a platform,” Cohen-Karni said. “I’m not focused on single tissues. For now, let’s get the basic science, basic interfaces done and down the road we’ll start digging into disease related electrophysiology. Some of it can be really wild, even creating cyborgs.”
“Essentially, you take from each experience what you need to bring the grand idea to reality. Sometimes it’s not a linear combination, sometimes it’s synergetic.”

When your stomach starts to rumble, and you feel a pit inside your stomach, you’re experiencing a biological drive: hunger. Your body is running out of food to break down, and it wants more, so it motivates you by making you uncomfortable. This motivation is what forces you to roll out of bed and cook yourself some breakfast. 
These biological drives are what allow our bodies to keep themselves in tip-top shape, to survive. They’re feelings that are only alleviated through actions, and they motivate us to act in ways which benefit us. 
Other biological drives include the drive to procreate, to drink, to sleep, and, according to George Loewenstein, the Herbert A. Simon University Professor of Economics and Psychology at Carnegie Mellon University, to make sense of the world. 
Loewenstein is interested in the idea that sense-making is a biological drive, just like hunger or thirst. In short, this drive toward sense-making is a “drive toward simplification,” or the idea that the less complicated we can make things, the more easily we can understand them. Loewenstein believes that “an individual evaluates his life based on two major criteria: how good is it, and how much sense does it make?” 
Goodness, Loewenstein says, “can be evaluated many ways: how fulfilled a person feels, how generally content he feels on a daily basis,” and so on. But the second criterion is far more interesting to Loewenstein. Just as we feel physically bad if we don’t eat, we “feel really bad if we suddenly feel like our lives or the world make less sense than they [previously] made.” This bad feeling is essentially our bodies’ way of telling us to act, to make sense of the world, and to restore the security we feel when we understand what’s going on. 
Picture this: your life is a puzzle. Maybe one that depicts a field of sunflowers or a picturesque lighthouse. You’re trucking away on this puzzle — you’ve got the border all put together, you’re starting to fill in the picture, and the finish line is in sight. To throw a wrench into the works, let’s say that one of the puzzle pieces breaks in half, followed by another, and another, until there are suddenly twice as many pieces to this puzzle, and the difficulty’s just gone up exponentially. You’re probably not going to feel very good about this strange development; you might even flip the table dramatically and storm off. 
This is an example of what Loewenstein calls “loss-aversion,” or that bad feeling we get when our lives make less sense. In this scenario, it would either motivate you to either put extra effort into the puzzle and ultimately finish it — if you’re a competitive type — or to find something else to occupy your time.
Loewenstein says that in the process of sense-making, “pleasure and displeasure ... are geared toward expectations of how much sense you hope to make.” When the puzzle magically becomes more difficult, the displeasure is largely a result of your previous expectations to make just a little sense — a pretty picture. 
That being said, the pleasure from finishing the harder puzzle would be greater than that from finishing the easier one because there is more sense to be made from a more difficult process.  If we extrapolate this example from a puzzle to some sort of real-life problem — a dispute between friends, a difficult homework assignment, or a job search — we will largely find that the pleasure from solving real problems is far higher than the pleasure from solving recreational ones. 
Loewenstein asserts that this is due to the fact that the “level of satisfaction is dependent on how much the new information helps you make sense of your life.” Essentially, this means that your life will make more sense, be simpler, when you’ve completed a task, such as finding a job, which gives you some measure of security for the future. 
Once that task is done, you’ll most likely be more content with your life as a whole. This theory, that sense-making is a biological drive, can be extrapolated into many other areas as well. One such area is the theory of confirmation bias, or the idea that people are “motivated to avoid information that challenges their existing beliefs.” 
This particular phenomenon is often represented in the types of media one consumes. If an individual happens to be a die-hard Republican, they will naturally tend to avoid left-leaning, liberal media outlets and seek out conservative ones, for example, because their  beliefs are in-line with those of the conventionally conservative media. If one is an orthodox Catholic, they will naturally avoid atheistic programming or viewpoints, in favor of ones which reaffirm their beliefs. 
Confirmation bias, Loewenstein asserts, is rooted at least in part in the drive for sense-making. Since we naturally feel worse when our lives make less sense — when things become complicated — we often gravitate toward media or individuals which share our values. Were we to interact with opposing viewpoints, especially ones which go against our framework for existence (i.e. “is there a God/an afterlife”), we would be somewhat forced to consider why we believe what we believe and possibly to reevaluate our entire worldview. 
Loewenstein’s theory may go a long way to explaining boredom, as well. Since the pleasure we receive from sense-making is largely contingent on our expectations, we become bored when we expect to make sense but lack necessary information, or if the sense we do make is less important than we expected it to be. For example, normal people will often become bored when they stare at complex math problems because they have no hope of making sense out of them. 
Additionally, if a scientist spends a long time working out a complex math problem and believes that it’s the key to furthering his research, but it ends up being a waste of time, he would feel a bit frustrated, and maybe even a little bored. On the flip side, Loewenstein asserts that we don’t get bored as we go to sleep because we don’t expect to get any meaning out of sleep, so the pleasure we receive from sense-making depends on our expectations and whether or not they match the outcomes. 
Loewenstein’s theory of sense-making has many implications, but in the simplest of terms, our brains enjoy making sense of the world. Sense gives us security, and making sense makes us feel good, so we want to make as much of it as possible.

This week at Pugwash we discussed the “Right to Be Forgotten” — the concept that one can request to have personal information removed from the online public domain. We began our discussion by sharing our knowledge on what that right currently means. One member explained how at present, the European Union can force Google to take down certain search results. However, this takedown pertains, by law, to search results displayed on Google internationally and not only in the information’s country of origin. 
For example, say someone in Spain commits a crime and information about this incident appears online. If the European Union decides that this information should be removed, Google must remove the results not only in the Spanish version of Google, but also in all international versions of Google. 
These comments lead us to the ethical question of the meeting: Is the right to be forgotten truly a human right, or is it an excuse for governments to exert censorship power on international private corporations. One member explained how this “right” needs to be monitored very carefully so that governments do not use it as a tool to remove incriminating information about officials, thereby leading us closer to an Orwellian society where those with power can wipe information away from history that they do not like. 
And, as someone else pointed out, the ability to take down certain information has been abused before: Digital Millennium Copyright Act takedown — when content is removed due to copyright infringement — has certainly been abused to remove undesirable, yet legal, information. Yet someone else turned the conversation away from totalitarian fear by explaining how Google has not removed most requests, and as of yet has not been penalized for refusing to do so. 
Requests to remove search results relating to crimes committed or corruption seems to have been ignored by Google, while requests to remove information about victims of abuse have been followed up. If the EU is indeed not abusing this power, and instead using it to protect abuse victims, why should we oppose their actions?
On the other hand, as another speaker countered, the removal of information from the public domain is always taking us a step away from truth. Information can always be ignored; yet unknown information cannot be learnt. 
Even if information online is not true, by removing information we are still limiting our understanding of the current state of people’s beliefs. And if the online information is in fact false, shouldn’t there be a flood of other online articles that point this misinformation out? 
We then began to wonder what exactly the future of the “the right to be forgotten” is, regardless of the intrinsic morality of this law. Some members thought that it was only a matter of time until this law will begin to take effect in the U.S. However, another person responded to this by suggesting that the law follows from the more socialistic governments in the EU, and not vice-versa. Thus, as long as the power of the American government over free expression remains checked, it is unlikely that we will see this law creeping into the states. 
Finally, we wondered whether humans would learn to be more careful with their personal information in a digital age, thereby rendering this law unneeded. Some people thought this was likely, while others believed that carelessness about our privacy was part of our human nature. 
We finished our meeting with an uncertain viewpoint on this law, yet perhaps with a greater understanding of human politics, morality, and behavior.
Student Pugwash is a non-advocacy, educational organization that discusses the implications of science. This article is a summary of last week’s discussion on the right to be forgotten.

If you’ve seen the trailer for The Jungle Book, the latest reimagining of the classic book, set to be released on April 15, I suggest you watch it again. Keep in mind that the movie was created with just one actor in an empty room. The rest of the movie was filled in by Computer Generated Imagery (CGI). Consider any other animated or partially animated movie, like The Incredibles, Jurassic World, or Avatar. All were created using CGI. While movies are a common example of this technology put to work, the applications of CGI are varied. Video games, virtual reality programs, theme parks, and even research ventures utilize CGI to display things that can’t be visualized otherwise. 
This article will focus on three dimensional CGI animation from a cinematic perspective. CGI is an umbrella term that is used to refer to any image created using computer software. One can create both 2-D and 3-D images using this technology. The major difference between the two is that 3-D CGI is used to create an entire world, system, or animation, whereas 2-D CGI works with image manipulation, often overlaying one image with others. 2-D CGI often involves creating several renderings or frame generations of a particular scene or object and then modifying them further to fit the expected outcome. 
Maya, SOCK, Blender, and Lightwave are some examples of software that can be used to produce CGI. Most commercial CGI films use a similar process to movies without CGI: For any movie, the first task is to script it. Without having a clear idea of where story is going to go, or what the characters are supposed to do, the movie may turn into a bizarre, incoherent melting pot full of plot holes. After the script is written, the animator creates the “storyboards,” which are basically several simple renderings of the same scene to get an idea of what works and what doesn’t. These storyboards progress into a formal layout, wherein the entire movie is “completed.” At this stage, none of the characters have features, mouths or faces. 
Their outlines and movements are the only data that exist at this stage in the process. Sometimes, this is also when the “voicing over” takes place. This sequential arrangement of the chosen scenes from the storyboard can be referred to as the “layout.” It is just the rough draft of the entire movie. Layout is also done because it is much easier to make changes when the piece is unfinished rather than later, when one would have to work excessively on the details of the scene that has to be modified. 
After the layout has been approved by the directors and other parties involved in the animation, the details are filled in. The characters are given physical features, hair, and other sophisticated appendages. Hair animation is often left for the end because it is the hardest and most nuanced bit to actually animate. This is also when the lighting of the scenes is adjusted; the characters and objects are given shadows, illumination, and the like. From a production point of view, that is how animation takes place. 
From a slightly more technical perspective, the animation process involves a lot more work than one might think. Most motion animation requires some kind of data about how an object moves. This data can be obtained using several different kind of models, one of which is called the articulate model. This model is a type of skeletal system that defines the joints where motion is possible and in what directions. It determines what movements can be made and limits them to certain points of articulation, just like in a regular skeleton. 
Another model for collecting movement data is the deformable object, which is often used to animate things that don’t have clear joints. These include clothes, water, and hair. Usually, animation involves using a hybrid model that combines several kinds of models together. Flip-books are representative of the method of keyframing to generate motion. As the name suggests, keyframing involves defining the frames at several instances in time and contracting them into one film. Another method, usually associated with CGI is to use motion-capture. This involves fitting live actors with certain special equipment, which relays movement data to computers to be rendered and animated on the big screen.
Movie-making is an intense process, and recognizing this process and all of the hard work that goes into it can enhance a movie-watching experience.

Synthetic bacteria able to survive with small gene amount
A biotech researcher and member of the USA Science and Engineering Festival’s Advisory Board, J. Craig Venter, along with a team of researchers, published their findings on their synthesis of the first bacterial cell. Known as JCVI-syn3.0, the bacterium contained 473 genes, the minimal amount of genetic material that the researchers determined was needed for the bacterium to live. 
Lasting for five years, the bacterium was first created when the researchers replicated the one of the smallest genomes in nature from M. mycoides, and transplanted the genome into another species, the Mycoplasma capricolum. The point of this research is to note that an organism can survive and live a healthy life with only a small number of genes. If even a single one of these genes were taken out, the synthetic bacterium would fail to survive. 
Researchers only expected about 5 to 10 percent of these genes to be critically important, demonstrating the researchers’ lack of understanding of role of those genes as well as the minimal genetic requirements for life.

Super-eruptions in Yellowstone larger than expected
A team of U.S., British, and Danish collaborators found evidence that 12 giant, ancient eruptions that occurred in the Central Snake River Plain in Idaho were actually larger than was previously thought, rivaling the notorious eruptions that took place in Yellowstone millions of years ago. 
By employing whole rock and mineral chemistries, palaeo-magnetic data, and radio-isotopic dates, the researchers identified individual eruption deposits and then correlated that data over larger regions. According to one of the researchers, Tom Knott from the University of Leceister, the eruptions in Yellowstone were only a sample of the series of ancient super-eruptions extending along the Snake River from Oregon to Yellowstone. 
These eruptions are thought to have occurred in the past 16 million years. For example, one report suggests that an eruption in southern Idaho covered over 14,000 kilometers-squared and 1.3 km, much greater than the super-eruption in Yellowstone that had an eruption volume of 1,900 kilometers-cubed.

New catalyst better at splitting water by 300 percent
Scientists at the SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory and the University of Toronto have created a new kind of catalyst that can decompose water into hydrogen and oxygen, a method that is used to store electricity generated by solar and wind power. 
The catalyst can decompose water at a rate that is three times better than the previous record holder. According to Aleksandra Vojvodic, a SLAC staff scientist, production of the catalyst does not require extremely advanced tools. 
Furthermore, the new catalyst is also one of the most inexpensive on the market, as it is made of three abundant metals — iron, cobalt, and tungsten. Vojvodic and colleagues from the SUNCAT Center for Interface Science and Catalysis used powerful computational tools to determine the effect an addition of tungsten has on catalyst’s activity. They then used their findings to develop a novel method to uniformly distribute the three metals by creating a gel that was later dried into powder.

Vegan diets could reduce climate change emissions
A study in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences suggests that reducing the consumption of meat, while increasing the consumption of fruits and vegetables, could lead to improved health and decreased carbon emissions. Researchers at Oxford University found that adoption of global guidelines on diet, which limits red meat and encourages produce consumption, could prevent 5.1 million deaths per year and reduce food-related emissions by 29 percent. 
Furthermore, a global adoption of a vegan diet would result in 8.1 million fewer deaths and a 70 percent reduction in emissions. Additionally, dietary shifts could lead to monetary savings in healthcare. 
While the lead author and post-doctoral researcher at the Department of Population Health, Marco Springmann, states that it is not expected that everyone will become vegan, he said that switching to a more healthy and environmentally-friendly diet could lead to overall global improvement.

Microsoft’s teenage chatbot corrupted by Internet users
Last Thursday, Microsoft shut down its artificial intelligence program Tay, which was a chatbot that learned how to interact with 18-24-year olds through its conversations online, via platforms like Twitter, Kik and GroupMe. Designed to be engaging and entertaining, Tay could be contacted via her Twitter address and other online platforms, including Kik or GroupMe. Within a day of Tay’s release, the chatbot began making racist and sexist comments as a result of abuse by some users. 
Others found that it was difficult to have substantial conversations with the chatbot about various topics, including music and television. Microsoft has apologized for the inflammatory comments and deleted most of the bot’s tweets. They covered up this move by saying that Tay was tired and needed to rest.
While the the company is currently making some adjustments to the bot, many followers urge Microsoft to allow Tay to learn about what is right and wrong autonomously, rather than being interrupted mid-experiment.

Astronomers see huge supernova’s shockwave blast
From the Kepler Space Telescope, an international team of astronomers were able to see a shockwave for the first time, due to the display of normal visible colors. The shockwave was seen near a red giant that was 270 times the radius of the sun and was the smaller of two old stars that were being observed by the astronomers. 
After running out of fuel, the star started to compress on its central core so much that a reciprocal, outward force was triggered, creating the explosion of an aging giant star that resulted in a shockwave. In contrast, the other star, which had 400 times the radius of the sun, did not show signs of a shockwave. 
As stated by co-author Brad Tucker, from Australian National University, the researchers believed that the larger size of the star made the escape of the shockwave more difficult. The discovery is currently in the process of being published in The Astrophysical Journal.

Over the weekend, senior Iman Mazloum, a BXA in International and Political Science and Directing, joined the chorus of voices that have been raising awareness about sexual assault and relationship violence in recent years. The production Mazloum adapted and directed, The Zahra Center, is designed to spark discussion about the reaction to sexual assault and abuse in Muslim communities. 
What came through loud and clear in The Zahra Center is the tension surrounding discussions of sexual assault and relationship violence (SARV). As pointed out in the play and reiterated in the talk back after, the community can fall into the trap of victim blaming and treating sexual assault as juicy gossip. It can be difficult to discuss issues of SARV, but as Mazloum said during the talk back, “through art we can find our way, instead of it being an upfront conversation or a lecture at a mosque.” Mazloum’s art managed to navigate this complicated territory by cloaking the issue in humor.
When you decide to go to a play that “discusses the culture of silence surrounding domestic abuse and sexual assault in North American Muslim communities,” you don’t expect to spend most of the show laughing. But that’s exactly what happened. The show, which was an adaptation of Fatima A. Jaffer’s novel Surviving Zahra, follows the week leading up to bride-to-be Tahera’s wedding. Tahera, played by Alia Schindler, an administrator at Chatham University, attempts to set her best friend Masuma, played by senior computer science major Alaa Mohamed, up with her uncle Akber, played by Russell Hawkins, a sophomore electrical and computer engineering major. This, of course, leads to plenty of comical moments as the well-meaning bride and her matchmaking aunts gossip and plot. The highlight of the script was the banter between Schindler, Mohamed, and Hawkins when they sassed each other, their elders, and their society. These were the moments when the actors seemed to relax into their characters and come to life. 
The conversation of SARV is introduced from two angles. Akber is the head of a support center for Muslim men and women who have experienced abuse or assault. The center works to help survivors find inspiration and support through their faith and the Koran. Masuma was a victim of rape when she was nineteen, and has a six-year-old child from it. Their two stories run as an undercurrent in the play, bubbling up in charged monologues delivered straight to the audience. The monologues recounted the fear, self-loathing, and sense of isolation many women and specifically Muslim women experience in the aftermath of SARV. 
While these monologues and the other comments on SARV worked into the play were true and important, they were not necessarily new to the viewing audience or the Carnegie Mellon community. That is not to say that Carnegie Mellon doesn't have a long way to go with SARV, or that the university has not silenced or ignored cases of assault. But we have been having campus discussions for several years now, and as Mazloum herself mentioned, the climate surrounding discussions of SARV has improved. The ideas that women are not simply commodities and are not goods that can be “spoiled,” that SARV can occur anywhere in any community, and that victims of SARV deserve to be listened to, supported, cared about, and believed have all been touched on on campus through lectures, seminars, gallery shows, hackathons, and more. It is an important message to get out to people who aren’t aware of SARV and the impact it has on thousands of lives a year, but the people who experienced The Zahra Center this weekend were, for the most part, not those people. They were people who were interested in the content the play was discussing, most likely because they were already engaged in the subject matter of abuse, assault, or Muslim communities. 
The difficulty The Zahra Center faces is by no means limited to this show. It’s an issue most initiatives and projects on campus have to deal with. Those who are already engaged in a subject are significantly more likely to show up to an event, while the people who are less exposed to an issue and, therefore, need the information most, go elsewhere. 
However, Mazloum has some impressive plans for the play that would circumvent this problem. Already, she has started building the play into something that transcends its two-hour running time. The show included a table of resources, both on campus and around Pittsburgh, for victims of SARV. Mazloum also partnered with local Pittsburgh organizations such as the Pittsburgh Muslim Women’s Association, the Carnegie Mellon Office of Title IX Initiatives, and Pittsburgh Action Against Rape. These community organizations came together with students and staff from Carnegie Mellon to form a panel discussion at the show’s talk back. 
For me, the talk back was perhaps the most interesting part of the whole experience. Instead of focusing on the specifics of The Zahra Center as a work of drama, the panelists used it as a jumping off point for a larger discussion. Akber’s role as a man starting a survivor support network gave rise to a discussion about the role of men in working towards change in how SARV is handled, while the focus on an issue in the Muslim community by a Muslim adapter and director gave rise to the question, “How can the general community help Muslim women in these situations?” In all of the discussions about supporting SARV survivors and creating larger change the idea of listening and being an ally, not a savior, was reiterated time and time again. The discussion that expanded from the play was nuanced, and created a dialogue that was applicable to our community. 
Mazloum has some exciting hopes for the play in the future. She is in discussion with the Office of Title IX Initiatives to get the play screened at CMU’s Qatar campus as, in Mazloum’s words, “a gateway to starting these conversations.” Beyond that, she hopes to offer it as an educational tool for mosques, Islamic schools, and Muslim communities that are grappling with these issues so they can use this piece of art to facilitate a tough discussion.  
I am unsure of how much of an impact The Zahra Center will make on Carnegie Mellon’s Pittsburgh campus. As a campus we have been engaging with the issue of sexual assault for several years, and while we still have a long way to go, the play’s focus on beginning a dialogue and building basic support was perhaps a bit outdated. But there are many communities that have not been forced to address these issues yet, and The Zahra Center offers a great place to start. It is wonderful to have a powerful, intelligent, and talented voice discussing issues of SARV, but it is exponentially better to have that voice heard by those who need it. Mazloum, with her charismatic speech and strong sense of direction, seems to know how to be heard.

According to John Carson, the Head of the School of Art, “the unpredictability of the MFA program at CMU is one of its strengths and joys.” This was certainly true of “Self-Driving Car,” the CMU 2016 MFA Thesis Exhibition. As the culmination of three years of study and experimentation, “Self-Driving Car” simultaneously shows us a snapshot of the artists’ long, arduous process while giving us a glimpse of their future trajectory. The diversity of themes tackled by these seven MFA seniors was superseded only by the diversity in the materials used to convey their ideas. From immigrant displacement to the history of technology, from french fries to bondage props, “Self-Driving Car” explores the entire gamut of the human experience.
The most visually engaging piece in the show was an installation by Tucker Marder, a graduate art major. Occupying the largest space in the gallery, Shark Shapes, a mixed media installation using foam shark toys, Bloodstream Top Predator Chum, nylon dock line, and fish food was a treat for the eyes (but not so much for the nose) with its striking colors and quirky shapes. The piece consisted of many brightly colored and exuberantly shaped shark toys balanced on various platforms or pedestals, or in one case hung from the ceiling using a vivid red rope. There was one important detail. Each of the foam toys had been chewed by a shark, as evidenced by the teeth marks. On the wall were hung photos of the sharks mauling the toys, the frames covered in fish food.
Shark Shapes continues Tucker Marder’s exploration of "a more symbiotic relationship between humans and the planet," through an "environmental ethic that promotes optimism and engagement rather than depression and paralysis," in the words of the artist. The juxtaposition of these whimsical colors and shapes with an animal commonly used in pop culture as a symbol of mass terror brings out the inherent humor in our natural environment. Also, balancing the chewed up foam toys on buckets of shark bait, or in one case a giant globe of chum (hence the smell), brought home the delicate balance between human control over our environment and nature’s inherent responses. But ultimately, the appeal of this piece was the visual magnetism it exuded. The balance and precision with which the colors and shapes were positioned and lighted gave it a sweeping grace, a presence large enough to fill the entire space despite the relatively small size of its individual components.
Almost as striking was graduate art major Zhiwan Cheung’s sculptural and video installation The Impossibility of Home. As the name suggests, this piece, in the words of the artist, probes the idea of an "odyssey towards a home that does not exist, a rite of passage with no destination." To represent this search with no end he chose banana trees and Chinatown orange. The former is a species whose history of dispersion and domestication is so complex that its origins are shrouded in a veil of mystery, while the latter is the name of a specific hue of orange that has no recorded root in history. Chinatown orange doesn’t in fact have any root in the cultural landscape of chinatowns. Both of these combine to convey the artist’s search for a lost origin, an absent explanation.
The Impossibility of Home was a mini plantation of bright orange colored banana trees, Chinatown orange to be exact. No, there was nothing subtle in the execution of the concept. However, the orange trees and the dramatic lighting combined to form and immersive environment that was very enjoyable to experience. Also, the ridiculous, over the top aesthetic of the piece highlighted the ridiculousness of our mental associations of unrelated constructs as well as our inherent drive for answers and explanations that don’t exist. The piece sounds great, right? It was, until the videos started playing. The videos showed us clips of banana plantations and forests. Some had the fake orange banana trees in them juxtaposed with the natural surroundings. Some clips even had the artist wandering around a plantation in an orange onesie. The entire time, there was a narrator’s voice giving us the history of the banana as well as Chinatown orange in a tone obviously meant to evoke nostalgia, despite only succeeding in evoking memories of Discovery channel documentaries. This overt explanation of the “message” of the art removed all the nuance from the piece, making it seem like a parody of itself.
Right beside Zhiwan’s piece, the viewer is confronted by a barrage of color. In his Love Letters to Wendy, graduate art major Dan Allende explores the absolute depths of our food chain: junk food. Using the male belly, the essential characteristic of the ‘dad bod,’ as his muse, he made plaster casts of his own belly, transforming them into vibrant masks. He then made six giant collages of all sorts of colorful household debris, play-doh, pipe cleaners, flower petals, and orange peel. In the center, fenced off by ropes of Cheetos strung together, were placed three contraptions of various heights, each dangling a french fry suspended by string, each spinning at a different rate. The massive collages, the multitudinous masks, and the spinning french fries all combined to form a time travel device, shooting us back into those distant reaches of our childhood when indulgence wasn’t a sin punishable by contempt and our body wasn’t an item in a silent auction.
Probably the most traditional exhibit in the show are graduate art major Ada-Scarlett Hopper’s pieces Movement | Flow :: Bound | Free and Pas de Deux, dependency. Primarily a sculptor, Ada uses the medium of photography to convey the idea of the body as sculpture. In Pas de Deux, dependency, using her experience as both a ballet dancer and a dominatrix, Ada explores the idea of systems of control that can exist between two people, and the flow of control from one to the other. Designed in a symmetrical manner, this piece is a stunning series of sixteen self portraits, eight with her ballet partner, eight with her BDSM partner. The photos all convey the sense of action and motion that is normally associated with these activities. By freezing them, we free ourselves from the notion of gesture, a concept inherent to the time dimension, and are able to consider the bodies as merely three dimensional sculptural objects.
The self portraits are arranged in a line and halfway down the line we switch, almost imperceptibly, from one set of self portraits to the other. On all the photos, she has overlaid white tape to capture lines in the physical forms of their bodies, in particular lines that directly influence her freedom of movement. By doing so, Ada has materialized the invisible matrix of control that surrounds and influences her, a matrix that she is, however, also able to influence.
“I like rules,” Ada said on Thursday night at the open critique of her work, held in the gallery. That is something clearly visible in her work: sixteen self portraits on a black background, mounted on white, framed in black with white tape, all the same size, hung in a row, lit by a row of purple spotlights. We see an obsession with structure, boundaries, formal systems, control. “If we view BDSM from a wide angle lens, it’s just bodies in space,” Ada said. And this was very much the focus of the exhibit, the similarities between the seemingly disparate disciplines of ballet and BDSM, the same exchange in control, the same trust and the same juxtaposition between pleasure and pain, maybe even pleasure through pain. After all, “pointe shoes are foot bondage.”
Her self portrait triptych Movement | Flow :: Bound | Free, explores similar ideas of motion and control, this time using the “spotting technique” that helps a ballet dancer pirouette, without getting dizzy. This technique requires the dancer to keep their head and neck stabilized in space, gazing at a particular spot in the audience before spinning, and turning their head at the last second. For the piece, Ada tied a bondage collar around her neck, attaching the collar to opposing walls of the ballet studio. She then proceeded to pirouette as far as she could with her neck physically held in place, taking photos of herself in the process. In her own words, this was the “invisible bondage of dancers made visible.” Her work may be traditional in form, but it is inventive in content. Daring, yet not attention seeking. It is an unlikely but insightful fusion of a sculptor’s aesthetic with a photographer’s process.
These were just four of the seven installations at the Miller Gallery. The exhibit will continue to be on display until April 10. A particularly good night to visit the gallery will be Thursday, March 31 when, starting at 6:30 p.m., the works of Dan Allende, Tucker Marder, and Jesse Kauppila will undergo a critique open to the public. Eric Shiner, Executive Director of the Andy Warhol Museum, will be the guest critic. Other dates to mark in your calendars are March 31 and April 7 at noon when Dan Allende will be conducting a workshop on mask making and belly dancing.

Hi Josh!
I've got one of those problems that isn't really a problem, but it's like really hard and odd for me, so I just wanted to know what you think. So long story short, I met my soulmate. Like he's an amazing artist-type, plays the cello and knows his way around a camera, and he's got some dainty chest hair going on, and he's into literally everything I love. Like if God reached out to me and was like "Hey yo, list everything you want in a man, and I'll make you one, specially for you," and then I wrote down everything I want in a man, and God made him, it'd be this kid. 
So the problem isn't that he's perfect, the problem is that he doesn't like me the same way. Like he isn't straight. But I want him to be straight. And it's a terrible situation because I want him to love me, but he doesn't see me like that, and it's kinda like being in the friend zone but worse because he's not only not interested in me, but my entire sex. And it's not even like I can just ignore him because I see him basically every day in one way or another. So like. What do?
Sincerely,
Everything's Hard
Dear EH,
I've been there, and you're right; it is a weird and slightly terrible situation to be in. Not only because you have these unrequited feelings, but because there's a little bit of you that's like "you're not right the way you are, I'd rather you were this way, so I could be happier." One of my biggest life philosophies is to not spend time worrying about things I can't control, and other people fall very squarely into that category.
I can't tell you exactly what to do, because this sounds like a "you" problem, but I can say that changing your thought patterns is probably the best way to go. Or maybe you could blatantly ask him "yo man, you bi?" or point to a random girl as you're both walking to class and subtly say "dayum, shawty," and see if he joins in the muted cat-calling, as many straight men are wont to do. Or you could just ask him. Or you could just flee the country and live as a hermit in Nicaragua. The possibilities are endless.

Two and a half years. That is how long we've all waited for Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice. This weekend, we finally got to see the manifestation of all that anticipation. I was well aware of the critical dark clouds being cast over the second installment in the DC Cinematic Universe before seeing the film, but I needed to leave all those preconceived notions at the ticket counter, get my large popcorn and soda, and take my seat with an open mind. Can Zack Snyder deliver? How is Ben Affleck as the new Bruce Wayne/Batman, or Gal Gadot as Wonder Woman? Have the stakes been raised since Man of Steel? I had too many questions and not enough answers. The lights turned dim and the music started. 150 minutes later, when the lights awoke, I was not disappointed.
Following the battle that nearly destroyed Metropolis, the world must decide what is to come of a seemingly all-powerful alien from Krypton. While the Senate Congressional Superman Committee holds hearings in Washington, seasoned billionaire Bruce Wayne re-cowls as the vigilante Batman to destroy Superman and protect the planet. But there is a larger threat brewing in the city that will put these comic book gods to the test.
There is a lot to digest in this movie so let’s take it piece by piece. I’ll begin by moving past Superman quite quickly by saying this: no more, no less. Henry Cavill delivers a similar performance as Superman to the one we get in Man of Steel. In fact, this movie presents a more mature Superman, not in age but in attitude. Kal-el has experienced the conflicting feelings the human race has toward him, and Cavill does a fine job presenting Superman’s mental anguish over the issue. Nothing new or special from the Last Son of Krypton, but the Dark Knight presents some interesting surprises.
Let us not forget we have a new cinematic Batman played by the controversially casted Ben Affleck. This iteration of Bruce Wayne is not a lengthy departure from what we are used to. He is a billionaire, tycoon, and philanthropist who cares about his city and is tortured by his past. Batman, on the other hand, is not the same Batman we are accustomed to. This Batman is old, retired, and angry. Superman’s battle with General Zod destroyed Metropolis and a Wayne Financial tower along with it, killing Bruce’s colleagues. “That’s how it starts. The fever. The rage. That turns good men… cruel,” said Alfred. Played impeccably by Jeremy Irons, Alfred delivers the line that defines why Bruce dons the cowl again and declares war on Superman. In his pursuit, Batman is a more brutal fighter than we have ever seen, most notably abandoning one of his core principles (No spoilers here, so I will let you fill in the blanks). This is my favorite iteration of any cinematic Batman.  His more violent fighting style, his increased detective skills, and his snarky, as opposed to reclusive, attitude make this Bruce Wayne/Batman the most interesting we have ever seen. Granted the character does not experience much emotional range in this movie, Affleck plays Bruce’s grit and resentment without flaw.
Another hotly contested casting choice was Jesse Eisenberg’s Alexander “Lex” Luthor. The trailers shed some light on what looked to be a rather two-faced character, but after seeing the movie, Lex seems a bit more like the Joker. Lex’s role in the DC Cinematic Universe is much deeper than anticipated and this movie makes that clear. Instead of the dark, conniving, industrious billionaire we are used to seeing, this Lex Luthor is a paranoid, nervous, almost-afraid, dark, conniving, industrious billionaire. I did not mind Eisenberg’s performance and am not unhappy with the decisions made for the character.
Now let’s talk about Gal Gadot as Wonder Woman. I was optimistic. I trusted Warner Bros. must have seen something special in her audition for the character and she had been working hard to become a better actor. I do not know if all that is true, but Snyder used the character perfectly. Gadot is not required to do any highbrow acting, is not required to speak any long monologues, and is not given much dialogue with other actors. On the other hand, she is presented as a badass warrior who possesses extraordinary power, a deep history, and well-founded morals. Additionally, Hans Zimmer and Junkie XL provide the music for the film and Wonder Woman’s theme gave me chills up and down my arms. That is quality you cannot teach.
Last, but certainly not least, are the visuals. Zack Snyder’s films have always set the bar for having dynamic visuals, especially in battle. BvS does not disappoint. The fight(s) are beautiful to watch. The sound rumbles your chair. Batman has new gadgets. Wonder Woman is stronger than everyone except Superman. It is a pure thrill every time one character attacks another.
If all these things are so great, why is the movie getting such bad reviews? A very good question with a very simple answer: the writing and editing are sub-par. That is the foundation of a movie and what critics use to base their scores on Rotten Tomatoes. I can count on one hand the number of effective lines of dialogue in Batman v Superman. Throughout the movie, I found myself saying “Really? Come on. Really?” The script attempted to cover far too many bases making each important base less and less relevant. Unfortunately, the script is what a movie hinges on and is the difference between a good movie and a sloppy one. It is truly unfortunate and devastatingly disappointing to be taken out of a movie every time I feel like I have just started to connect. Never more so than for a movie that had such potential and years of anticipation.
Is Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice a great movie? By no means. Good movie? Maybe. Worth seeing at all? Absolutely. It will not please every viewer, but you will not leave the theater asking for your money back. I definitely recommend seeing it. Much like a few of the movie’s characters, audiences anticipated one film and got another. The resulting whiplash, combined with sloppy writing and technical strategies, make Batman v Superman an action packed slideshow of clues hinting at what is to come in the DC Cinematic Universe. Audiences’ high hopes for Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice are not dashed, only postponed.
This movie is not a failure. It is an intermediary, a set-up, a sacrifice fly to right field moving the runner to third so we can score on the next batter. Though I find that a waste of a grand opportunity, I anticipate Justice League Part One will swing a big bat when it opens on Nov. 17, 2017.

For weeks and weeks, I’ve been heavily catering (pun intended) toward those who love to go out to eat and indulge, and I’ve been unforgivingly neglecting to acknowledge a very important part of the food loving world: the cooks. I’m not just talking about those who make homemade pasta from scratch and those who own more than five different types of knives and know how to use all of them, but I’m also talking to the average college student who has more instant ramen in their cabinets than forks and who sometimes wakes up with the glorious ambition of whipping up some solid toast with a nice spread of peanut butter to top it off. There’s a clear contrast between the different sorts of homebodies who take preparing their food into their own hands, but I think the one thing that unites them — and the restaurant goers — all together, is a word that most college students know all too well: budget.
I’ve found, both from my own experience and from speaking to my peers, that one of the biggest problems that the average college student faces is feeding themselves well, and getting both enough to eat, and wholesome things to eat, on a college student’s budget. 
As an avid Buzzfeed user, I often come across list such as “25 foods that every college should master” and “30 foods you should learn to cook in your 30s,” which personally intrigue me, but also really make me consider what I as a college student find most appealing and what would actually be feasible for me to make on an average weekday or maybe for a nice weekend dinner. So, what I’ve decided to do this week is recommend a recipe that I’ve found online (and tried myself) for my wonderful readers to take a crack at for themselves. I’ve gone ahead and picked a low budget, low effort, and sophisticated-looking recipe just for you, and I highly recommend you give this one a shot when you’ve got the time. Chicken Parmesan: Unfortunately, it’s not as easy as just throwing some parmesan on some chicken, but if you’ve got an oven, the work you have to do is pretty minimal.
Serves: 2
Ingredients:
- 2 frozen chicken breasts (thawed in advance)
- 3⁄4 cup flour, 2 large eggs, 2 cups breadcrumbs
- about a 26 oz. jar’s worth of spaghetti sauce
- shredded mozzarella (8 oz. should be good)
- 3⁄4 cup grated parmesan
- salt and pepper to taste
- spaghetti (optional)
Materials:
- 2 shallow dishes (make sure you’ve got enough space to dip your chicken breast)
- a bowl
- wax paper and a 13” baking pan or a well-greased non-stick 13” baking pan
- a pot (if you’re planning to make the spaghetti)
Prep:
Preheat your oven to 375oF. Make sure your chicken breasts are thawed and pound them so that they’re around an inch thick at most. If you’re using wax-paper while baking, lay it out on your baking pan ready to go. If you’re using a non-stick pan, grease it down with some butter, oil, or non-stick spray.
1) In the shallow dish, combine the flour, 1⁄2 tsp salt and 1⁄4 tsp pepper.
2) Break both of your eggs into a bowl along with 2 tbsp water and beat together.
3) Spread your breadcrumbs out evenly into the other shallow dish (tip: if you can’t find breadcrumbs, you can make your own by drying out some bread slices in the oven at around 300oF and then popping them into the food processor). This is a good place to mix in any other dry spices you might want to add to your dish such as oregano.
4) Lightly coat the chicken breast in the flour by laying it down in the dish, flipping it over, and then shaking off the excess. From here, dip it into the egg mixture, and allow excess to drain, and then coat in breadcrumbs as you did with the flour. Press on the breast gently in the breadcrumbs to make sure they stick.
5) Place breast onto baking pan (on wax paper or non-stick surface) and repeat with other breast. If you want to double coat the chicken with breadcrumbs, do so at this point.
6) Bake the chicken breasts in the oven for around 30 minutes. (This is a good time to cook the spaghetti, while you’re waiting.)
7) Pour spaghetti sauce over each breast and sprinkle mozzarella and parmesan over the tops. Pop the tray back in the oven for another 10-15 minutes or until the chicken isn’t pink anymore.
8) Take everything out and serve over the spaghetti.
Difficulty level: 2/5
Till next time, I hope you enjoy giving this astonishingly simple rendition of a modern classic a go. Additionally, if you have any suggestions for restaurants you’d like reviewed or recipes you’d like featured, please send me an

Walking into WELCOME TO MY FAITH IN YOU at The Frame gallery, I was first struck by a large and impressive bouquet stationed in the center. Though not technically part of the show, the flowers lend a simultaneously homey and austere first impression of the space. The exhibition, which opened Friday, is the culmination of artistic exploration by masters student in studio art Gray Swartzel. Sixteen months ago, Swartzel traveled to Manhattan to seek out a woman who would claim him as her child. To accomplish this, Swartzel put an ad in Craigslist, and, after finding a number of potential candidates, chose a woman on a recommendation from a friend who had responded to his Craigslist ad. This led him to Veronica Vega, a Chilean woman. Their relationship is subsequently the focus of WELCOME TO MY FAITH IN YOU, and includes pieces detailing their relationship in media ranging from video, to color photographs, to mystical multimedia pieces. The most dominant piece in the main gallery space is Freudian Drama II, a large video projection that runs on an 11-minute loop. The name is descriptive: the artist and his Chilean mother Veronica Vega sit in the back of a vehicle while discussing a variety of topics with over-the-top and soap opera-type dramatization. This gives the piece a very old-fashioned and intriguing air. Even if gallery goers do not commit to all 11 minutes of video, the soundtrack from the video, primarily emotional recounting about relationships, plays throughout the room as viewers can look at other pieces.
Two stunning and thought-provoking photographs capture visitors’ attention as they are located directly opposite the door. This piece is called Baptism Diptych (The Day We Met). In the photo on the left, a hand is shown, palm up — presumably Vega’s hand — with a drop of blood in the center, reminiscent of a Saint. Behind the hand is a crowded surface, filled with tchochkes, photos, and miscellaneous items, including the bottom half of an ornate cross. The photo on the right shows a man’s chest and torso with a red cross painted in the center. The religious imagery speaks volumes, and definitely lends a tone to the sort of spiritual contemplation at play in the exhibit.
In one corner of the gallery sat the piece Chest, a small chest of drawers that viewers are invited to look into. In the drawers are leather gloves, a fur mitten, and cyanotypes of Jesus. This piece is fun and gives an aura of authentic items that one may find in a home. Perhaps my favorite piece was Cradle (His Through Her), which was a shiny crib that glowed in the darkness of The Frame’s back room. Inside the crib was velvet embroidered with two different designs, slightly intertwined. The soundtrack playing was of the artist and Vega, speaking and singing together. The audio piece, Something Stupid, made the whole exhibit seem more playful, as it seemed like a mother and son engaged in playful and humorous banter and singing. It reminded me of sing-alongs in the car with my family when I was growing up, only a lot weirder. To me, the exhibit raised more questions than it answered. Who is this woman in Manhattan? Why did she want a child? What were Swartzel’s motives in going on this journey? I left the gallery feeling intrigued, yet impatient and confused. Swartzel’s work fascinates, and makes viewers question the nature of mother and child relationships. Rather than providing answers to questions of motherhood or family, each of Swartzel’s pieces demonstrate closeness between two people, and get viewers to think seriously about parenthood and what it means to be intrinsically linked to another human being. Unfortunately, WELCOME TO MY FAITH IN YOU was just installed for the weekend, but Gray Swartzel’s work and information can be found at www.jgrayswartzel.com.

Gateway to India, hosted by CMU OM, was held in Cohon Center Wean Commons on Friday evening. The event showcased the diversity of the different states that comprise India. Ten states (out of twenty-nine) were represented from the culturally distinct northern and southern regions of the country. The modern nation of India did not exist until 1947. For most of its history, the subcontinent was divided into several polities based on religion, culture, ethnicity, and language. Even current political boundaries do not account for the vast heterogeneity present in each and every state. Common themes at the event across the displays included famous Bollywood celebrities from the state, major cities, geography, and examples of writing and customs. Overall, the event was very successful, with a lively atmosphere, bright colors, and scents reminiscent of the typical bustling street in India.

If there’s one important lesson I learned from the School of Drama’s premiere production of Bob and Dave and Ren, it’s that every debate can be resolved with a gay threesome.
All jokes aside, this show — despite its murky alphabet-soup title — was a surprise treat. Bob and Dave and Ren is highbrow art talk disguised as all-male Dirty Dancing. Written and directed by Ben Ganksky, the show brings to life the polar philosophies of two artists who were both active from the 1960s to the 1980s. While installation artist Robert Irwin and influential Pop art painter David Hockney never actually interacted, their ideas came into contact through biographies written by Lawrence Weschler.
These are the Bob, Dave, and Ren of the title, though their characterizations are based not on the details of their biographies, but on their ideas. Bob is a cerebral, pretentious artist who disdains traditional narratives and instead wants to create a unique “experience” for his audience. Dave, who is more mainstream, though no less pretentious, prioritizes accessible storytelling that connects with his audience. The “thesis” of these men’s visions rains down on the audience with perhaps a little more force than necessary, though their main ideas are expanded upon through enough interesting tangents that I didn’t find the play dreadfully heavy-handed. Ren’s solution of course seems obvious: Art can be both an experience and a source of connection. 
The play works because takes the philosophical, which could easily get dull, and makes it personal. Sweet and naïve Ren (played by junior drama major Petr Favazza) is a burgeoning playwright who decides to collaborate on a show with his old friend-but-maybe-more Dave (played with vitality and conviction by junior drama major John Way) as producer and his summer lover Bob (junior drama major Dylan Bright) as director. This turns into a collaboration wrought with personal and professional tensions. Ren must mediate between Dave and Bob as they butt heads over their conflicting creative visions and their mutual romantic feelings toward Ren. I was particularly intrigued by Bright’s characterization of Bob, who comes across more like a flannel-wearing camp counselor than the stereotypical chain-smoking artist. 
What takes the play’s concept from “kind of neat” to “super cool” is its three-act structure, which reflects the philosophies of its three title characters. The first act is all Dave, a traditional narrative with fleshed-out characters to connect with and a plot to follow. The second act, the work of Bob, is a bit more avant-garde. With characters vanished and plot nonexistent, I put on color-coded headphones and obeyed a voice which told me to examine the theater walls and trace the octagon shape of the catwalk into my palm. One audience member — dubbed “the least lucky person in the room” — was instructed to read excerpts from the script for us all to hear. The other half of the audience was brought to an adjacent room, where I later learned they had been watching us from secret cameras. At times silly, relaxing, and unnerving, the second act forces the audience to confront the false reality that theater manufactures.
The third act follows Ren’s philosophy by attempting to blend narrative and experiential art. The actors take the stage once again to perform the culmination of all their rehearsals from act one: an excruciatingly long, repetitive, and not very skilled dance routine. While not the most enjoyable to watch, this act was extremely interesting. It wasn’t a story, per se, but in my boredom I found myself applying a story to the men’s stray glances and increasing exhaustion. When even that got boring, I disengaged from what was happening on stage, looking instead at the theater and at the expressions of my fellow audience members. As the act intended, I became hyper aware of this theatrical experience we were all sharing together.
I’ll admit that Bob and Dave and Ren is a niche show. Those who aren’t artists, or who don’t at least have a moderate interest in art, would likely find it impenetrable or just plain boring. Anybody uncomfortable with homosexuality would likely run to the door within the first ten minutes. But for me, a self-proclaimed “creator” and aficionado of queer media, this show represents my people debating exactly the kinds of questions I’ve mulled over time and time again.
The questions run the gambit: What is the purpose of art? How should a creator relate to their audience? Is my work original and real and good? Or maybe my critics — both external and internal — are right. Maybe I actually am full of shit. What I love about this show is that it taps into that nagging spark of uncertainty most artists never fully extinguish.
Even Bob can’t escape a little self-doubt. The explosive final confrontation between him and Dave showcased the acting chops of both men and featured sound-bites all-too-familiar to me from conversations with and about other artists, but I’ve never before seen it articulated on stage. Dave wrecks Bob. He calls him all talk and no substance, a failure of an artist who’s “not smarter” than everyone else — “just more arrogant.” Like any artist, Bob is sometimes inclined to agree with his critics, but what I took away from the exchange is that your self-doubt is often beside the point and sometimes you can only say “screw it all” and keep on creating anyway.
I haven’t seen Dirty Dancing, but I assume it also includes multiple steamy dance rehearsal scenes to songs like “I Had the Time of My Life.” This is not a laugh-out-loud “romantic comedy,” despite what the description tries to sell it as. Its most campy moment comes in the “resolution” of Bob and Dave’s argument. I’ll reassert that I take no issue with gay threesomes, especially as this trio had fabulous chemistry and had been selling the UST (unresolved sexual tension) for the better part of an hour. However, I also felt that a play so concentrated on intellectual discussion — at least in its first act — needed to have some sort of verbal peacemaking as opposed to, well, lovemaking. 
Bob and Dave and Ren wholly commits to its unusual concept; it succeeds in creating an engaging story and a memorable experience all in one. While confining all philosophical dialogue to the first act gives the play a top-heavy feel, the following two acts provide, through demonstration, enough food-for-thought that the sacrifice is worthwhile. At least among certain audiences, I foresee Bob and Dave and Ren living a long, happy life together.

On Wednesday, March 23, an impressive number of people assembled in the Giant Eagle auditorium in Baker Hall for Judge Douglas H. Ginsburg’s lecture titled “A Matter of Interpretation.” Among the audience were not only Carnegie Mellon students and faculty members, but also graduate students and law students from neighboring universities and members of the broader Pittsburgh community.
The event was organized by Kiron Skinner, the director of Carnegie Mellon’s Institute of Politics and Strategy and the Center for International Relations and Politics. Joseph Devine, assistant dean of Dietrich College, gave the opening remarks, and William Carter Jr., dean of the University of Pittsburgh School of Law, moderated the Q&A session following the lecture.
Judge Ginsburg is a federal judge on the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, which some may argue is the second most influential court in our nation after the Supreme Court. The popularity of the event was unsurprising, as Judge Ginsburg is considered to be — according to Devine’s introduction — “one of the nation’s most distinguished jurists.” Judge Ginsburg was even nominated for a seat on the Supreme Court by President Ronald Reagan in 1987, though he withdrew his nomination shortly thereafter. His lecture, named after the late Justice Antonin Scalia’s book A Matter of Interpretation, revolved around two major themes: the purpose of having a written constitution and the federal courts’ roles in interpreting legislative statutes.
Judge Ginsburg set the stage for his discussion on the philosophy of Justice Scalia with an in-depth explanation of common law, to which he would constantly refer back throughout the rest of his lecture. He described common law as a type of “judge-made law” in which judges decide the customs. He states that it is a process in which, “judges are hearing a dispute, resolving them in a way they think is just or appropriate or perhaps more efficient … by [using] some criteria that resolves that dispute, which puts the judge in the position of lawmaker.” This question of whether judges assume the role of discovering or creating the law steered the conversation into a more extensive exploration of Justice Scalia’s legal philosophy.
It is without a doubt that Justice Scalia’s intellectual influence had a great impact on American law and conservative politics, though he was notoriously pugnacious and was criticized by many for being callous at times. The late justice was best known for adopting a rigidly originalist approach towards his interpretation of the Constitution. He was an unwavering advocate of the principle that, “context is everything and the context of the Constitution tells us not to expect nitpicking detail and to give words and phrases an expansive rather than a narrow interpretation.” He believed “every issue of law resolved by a federal judge involves an interpretation of text” and that the idea of a living Constitution “frustrates the whole process of a written Constitution.” Judge Ginsburg defended originalism by clearly distinguishing that, “the great divide with regards to constitutional interpretation is not between the Framers’ intent and objective meaning, but rather between original meaning, whether derived from the Framers’ intent or not, and the current.”
With the progression of his lecture, it became apparent that Judge Ginsburg and Justice Scalia share tremendously similar outlooks of legal philosophy, including a disdain toward the idea of a “living Constitution.” Judge Ginsburg defined this concept to be a “body of law that, unlike normal statutes, grows and changes from age to age in order to meet the needs of changing society,” and noted that judges have the authority to determine those needs and find the changing law. He said that with this notion, common law would prevail with an infinitely powerful comeback and an influence to overturn statutes passed by the legislature. He hinted at a possible imbalance that this would cause between the three branches of our federal government.
In ending his lecture, the judge cautioned that continuing to conform to the evolving standards of decency would allow the courts to essentially rewrite the Constitution in the way that the majority wants. He concluded on a powerful note that this itself would be the end of the Bill of Rights as society has known it. Judge Ginsburg was enormously successful in both relaying Justice Scalia’s legal view in an impartial light, and illustrating the cumbersome nature of the United States Constitution. He was also able to successfully convey his personal legal philosophy without imposing his opinions on the audience, but rather offering unobtrusive yet insightful commentary throughout his discussion.

This Saturday, Carnegie Mellon’s Japanese Student Association (JSA) hosted its annual, non-profit, Matsuri Spring Festival in Rangos Ballroom. Matsuri is traditionally a festival celebrated at Shinto Shrines in Japan, but is now seen as a way for the Japanese population to enjoy street food, games, and performances. For the JSA it was a celebration of Japanese culture and heritage recreated for members of the Carnegie Mellon community to experience.
From 3 p.m. to 8 p.m., students from diverse backgrounds flocked to Rangos Ballroom to support this event. Small colorful booths, decorated with beautifully crafted paper lanterns, were set up along the sides of Rangos. Each booth displayed hand made signs adorned with Japanese characters that promoted their respective activities. Volunteers for the event invited guests to taste a variety of Japanese food such as takoyaki, yakisoba, okonomiyaki, doroyaki, and dango. Also available to guests were fun games such as senbon-tsuri and wanage. Members of J@CMU were present to teach origami lessons and cooking lessons for those interested.
While the above listed events came with a small fee, performances by various Pittsburgh Japanese music groups were free to all. In attendance were Pitt FRESA, Rikhide, Zixuan’s Legs, 5 Musicians & Koso, SupaNEETS, and Pittsburgh Taiko. Guests at this event were seen walking around with food and drinks, rocking out to the music and having a good time.
Sophmore JSA Board Member and business major Emily Hirao stated “Matsuri was created in order to show the community of Carnegie Mellon University a taste of what festivals in Japan are like. Matsuri is literally translated as “festival” in Japanese, and is a fond memory that every person in Japan holds dear to their hearts as it reminds them of the delicious aromas coming from the various food booths, prizes that are won from games while being cheered on by family and friends, and the excitement of watching performances from the local community.”
Although one of Saturday’s Matsuri Festival’s missions was to present a small snippet of Japanese culture to the Carnegie Mellon community, just as important was its mission to help those in need in Japan. All of the festival’s profits will be sent to the Minato Middle School in Ishinomaki, Japan, whose campus was destroyed in the East Japan Earthquake on March 11, 2011. 
Freshman JSA Board Member Chie Wach stated, “Matsuri is not only Carnegie Mellon’s most celebrated event of Japanese culture, but also an opportunity for JSA and the entire student body to help the students of Minato Middle School recover from the devastating effects of the March 11 earthquake in Japan.” 
Minato Middle School is currently getting by with the utilization of “make-shift shelters on the playground of a nearby elementary school,” as stated on the festival’s website. The profits made from last year’s Masturi Festival were able to help students get sports equipment and supported their music classes. The JSA is hoping to build off the momentum that was created last year and help Minato Middle School get closer to the state they were in before the disastrous effects of the earthquake.
More information on Carnegie Mellon's Matsuri festival can be found on the event's website at matsuri.cmu-jsa.com.

Carnegie Mellon University professor of literary studies Kristina Straub has long held an admiration of classic literature. With the opening of her new exhibit titled “Will & Jane: Shakespeare, Austen, and the Cult of celebrity,” co-curated with Janine Barchas, an English professor at the University of Texas, it is safe to say that William Shakespeare and Jane Austen are at the top of this list. This exhibit is a part of the Folger Shakespeare Library and features many unique items that connect back to these authors. Earlier this month, it was announced that a new item will be part of this exhibit’s collection: an iconic shirt worn by Colin Firth in one of the most famous Pride and Prejudice screen adaptations.
Though published in the early 19th century, Jane Austen’s Pride and Prejudice still lives on as one of the most recognized titles in English literature. As is often the case, with great literature comes potentially great screen adaptations. One of the most famous Pride and Prejudice adaptations debuted in 1995 as a 6-part mini series starring Colin Firth and Jennifer Ehle as Mr. Darcy and Elizabeth Bennet, respectively. It has been praised as one of the most faithful Austen adaptations to date, which can likely be attributed to its rather long screen time, allowing the portrayal of more faithful content. Even for those that have not had the opportunity to watch this adaptation, it seems that many are strangely familiar with the image of Colin Firth, as Mr. Darcy, emerging from a pond in a wet, skin hugging, white t-shirt. Although, as previously stated, this adaptation is quite faithful, this scene is nowhere to be found in Austen’s novel, but still lives on as one of the most famous images from this Austen adaptation.
This new item, titled as “The Shirt,” will be placed in Straub and Barchas’ “Will & Jane: Shakespeare, Austen, and the Cult of Celebrity” exhibition starting this August.
The exhibition aims to look at the legacies of Austen and Shakespeare and how their works and lives continue to impact us today. On the exhibit’s website, Straub and Barchas note that one way both authors’ lives parallel each other today is in the portrayal of their works in screen adaptations and how this has increased the popularity and approachability of their stories for modern viewers. In addition to the 1995 adaptation, Pride and Prejudice and Zombies was released earlier this year as a unique portrayal of the struggle of finding suitable matches in the world of the undead. Other notable adaptations of Austen’s and Shakespeare’s works include Shakespeare Undead, Clueless, Baz Luhrmann’s Romeo + Juliet, and many others.
In an interview with The New York Times, Barchas stated, “The shirt seemed like a celebrity object that demonstrated the kind of fun people have with Austen as an author ... it exemplifies the kind of play that is central to our whole exhibition.”
This item will be among other rarities, such as a scarf featuring Austen’s family tree, and wood collected from Shakespeare’s birthplace.
“Will & Jane: Shakespeare, Austen, and the Cult of Celebrity” is part of the Folger Shakespeare Library in Washington, D.C. The exhibit will be open from Aug. 6 to Nov. 6 this year and is free to the public.

The Hunt Institute for Botanical Documentation’s latest exhibition, Great Expectations, is displayed on the fifth floor of Hunt Library, and will remain until June 30. The exhibition features artworks from 36 historical and contemporary artists that illustrate plants at different moments of development, according to each artist’s personal observations. According to the exhibit, the name refers to the “great expectation in the promise and energy held within a bud or a seed.” The gallery is free and open to the public, and the exhibition is open Monday through Friday from 9 a.m. to noon and from 1 to 5 p.m. It is also open on Sunday from 1 to 4 p.m.
At the entrance of the exhibition, a sign describes the series as “phases of this continuous cycle of plant development … beautifully illustrated with collection items.” On display around a large room with mahogany-colored walls and floors are framed pieces of art that depict flowers and plants lit by carefully placed overhead lights. This evokes a quiet and serene atmosphere. Each of the pieces of art are accompanied by a description, and are organized by the stage of a plant’s lifecycle they reflect. Each phase, from “seed” to “flowering” to “declining,” to name a few, is indicated by a well-chosen quote.
While most students recognize Hunt Library as a place for buckling down to study, many students are unaware of the existence of the Hunt Institute for Botanical Documentation’s gallery on the top floor. The Hunt Institute for Botanical Documentation is a research division of Carnegie Mellon University that specializes in the history of botany and plant science, and serves an international scientific community through research and documentation, according to its website.
Originally dedicated in 1961 as the Rachel McMasters Miller Hunt Botanical Library, the Hunt Institute for Botanical Documentation has grown to boast a vast collection of books, images, manuscripts, portraits, data files, and publications, across four departments: Archives, Art, Bibliography, and the Library. The Art Department organizes two exhibitions a year, as well as a revolving sequence of international travel exhibitions on loan to museums, galleries, and botanical gardens.
In the fall of 2016, the Hunt Institute will host the 15th International Exhibition of Botanical Art and Illustration, which will start Sept. 15 and run until Dec. 15.

A CMU sophomore wins a Critical Language Scholarship to study Punjabi in India this summer, and Professor Manuela Veloso is appointed as the new head of the Machine Learning Department.
CMU sophomore Ian Asenjo wins Critical Language Scholarship from State Dept.
This week, Ian Asenjo, a sophomore global studies major with an additional major in ethics, history, and public policy, was awarded the Critical Language Scholarship from the U.S. State Department, which will give him the opportunity to spend his summer in Chandigarh, India studying Punjabi.
This cultural and linguistic immersion program is intended to encourage students to study languages that are drastically different from English. Many American language learners do not choose to master these languages due to the drastic differences, and we do not have enough native speakers. With supply low, demand is high for speakers of these critical languages, such as Arabic, Swahili, Urdu, Turkish, and Punjabi.
Asenjo discovered his passion for this region of India and this language through his involvement with the Carnegie Mellon Bhangra team and through Associate Professor of History Nico Slate’s course “India through Film.” At this point in time, Asenjo’s only exposure to Punjabi has been through weekly attendance at a Sikh temple in Monroeville. His choice of Punjabi comes from an appreciation of the culture surrounding it, which he has only experienced secondhand to this point. He looks forward to learning the language and absorbing the traditions for himself this summer.
Professor Manuela Veloso appointed as head of Machine Learning Department
Dean of the School of Computer Science Andrew Moore announced on Wednesday March 23 that Herbert A. Simon University Professor of Computer Science Manuela Veloso would become the new head of the the Machine Learning Department. Stepping down from the position is E. Fredkin University Professor Tom Mitchell, who was the department’s founding head.
Veloso has been a member of the Carnegie Mellon community since she earned her Ph.D. in computer science here in 1992. Since then she has led the Carnegie Mellon robot soccer team to five world championships in its league and has also developed the Cobot service robots. Her research has challenged her to continually improve robots’ ability to independently plan and execute tasks, and learn and cooperate with a team under challenging circumstances.
She co-founded the International RoboCup Federation and until 2014, Veloso was the president of the Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence. Also in 2014, she was given the distinction of University Professor, the highest honor the university can give its faculty. She has also long advocated for women in computer science. Last fall in Houston, Texas she presented the keynote address at the annual Grace Hopper Celebration of Women in Computing.
Dean Moore expressed his utmost confidence in Veloso for the position in a press release on Wednesday: “Her knowledge of all aspects of AI and her dedication make her the perfect person to lead MLD now that machine learning has emerged as a major component of the world’s economy.”

The National Football League (NFL) has been an integral part of American culture for a very long time. It creates divides among states and unites citizens in a way that not many other organizations can. Growing up in Texas, it was always very present in my home. Sunday plans at my dad’s house almost always revolved around what team was playing who and when. For most people, myself included, football creates a connection between families. Moms, dads, and children alike put on jerseys and head to stadiums. It’s pretty safe to say that the NFL has a lot of weight in America, and you could probably sooner disband the United States government before you could disband the NFL. The NFL is not ignorant to the weight that its name carries, which is why I was excited to hear about the league deciding not to support states that choose to pass laws that are homophobic, transphobic, racist, or marginalizing in any way.
House Bill 757, , a “religious liberty” bill, was recently introduced to Georgia legislature and only needs a signature from Governor Nathan Deal before its anti-gay, discriminatory policies can be enforced. This bill will not only allow certain institutions to deny marriages to gay couples, but it would allow faith-based organizations to have the option of not hiring someone based on whether or not their sexual orientation aligns with the organization’s religious views. It wasn’t long before the NFL caught wind of this legislation and strongly hinted that Atlanta’s name would be taken out of consideration for hosting either the 2019 or 2020 Super Bowl if the bill passes. This would come following a new renovation of the Falcons’ stadium that is already set to dig deeply into taxpayer money.
While no final decisions have been made yet by either Deal or the NFL, this would not be the first time that the NFL has had a major hand in state legislation. In 2014, Arizona governor Jan Brewer vetoed SB1062, a bill that is similar in nature and language to Bill 757, after facing a lot of criticism from several large corporations, but most notably the NFL. Prior to the veto, the NFL released a statement saying “our policies emphasize tolerance and inclusiveness, and prohibit discrimination based on age, gender, race, religion, sexual orientation, or any other improper standard.” This put Phoenix at risk of losing the 2015 Super Bowl as the NFL closely monitored the progression of the bill. While there were also several other factors that contributed to the bill’s fate, it’s hard for a governor to turn a blind eye to the revenue that hosting a Super Bowl brings.
Similar conversations circled around my own hometown of Houston after the disappointing rejection of the Houston Equal Rights Ordinance (HERO) bill. This bill would have made it illegal to discriminate against someone based on things such as race, gender, sexual orientation, etc. Despite having such a large LGBTQ+ population and having a lesbian mayor at the time, smear campaigns that claimed this bill would make it possible for men to enter women’s bathrooms and a lack of young voter turnout led to the ultimate rejection of the bill. As of now, Houston is still set to host the 2017 Super Bowl, but the NFL has made it clear that they do not agree with the law’s rejection and will strive to make sure their fans feel welcomed at the game.
The NFL is taking a stand against cities that choose to discriminate. While it might not be the sole reason that these kinds of bills have been rejected, it definitely puts pressure on governors to consider how the loss of the Super Bowl would impact their economies. While the NFL is not perfect and definitely has several internal problems, such as perpetuating one single idea of masculinity and not properly addressing how brain damage caused by football can lead to mental illness, they are trying. They’re taking a stand against discrimination, which I think is very admirable. I love the NFL. I love that players wear pink during breast cancer awareness month, I love all the initiatives they have that allow inner city kids to meet with and learn from current players, and I love that it is something we can participate in as a country no matter how different we are. The NFL is using its power and its voice to take a stand and while some southern, conservative dads might not agree with the NFL’s stance, they’ll hopefully at least pay more attention to the problem if the NFL is talking about it.

Every day seems to bring a renewed discussion of Carnegie Mellon’s feared stress culture and how it tears the souls from bright-eyed and bushy-tailed young students who come to the school ready to learn and leave thinking of school only as a competition for who can cause themselves the most pain. To be honest, that is probably an accurate depiction of what happens on this campus. That said, the direction the discussion often takes — intertwined with mental health initiatives — both does little to solve a problem and crowds out a different conversation that needs to be had on campus.
The best distillation of stress culture at Carnegie Mellon, in my opinion, is an excellent article from Dec. 3, 2012 by former online editor of The Tartan, Katie Chironis titled “The happy mask: Carnegie Mellon must address stress culture.” It outlines the cultural underpinnings, origins, and effects of stress culture at Carnegie Mellon. I also think the initiative she pointed out — Massachusetts Institute of Technology’s MIT Together — is one of the most effective ways people have come up with at dealing with these sorts of problems. However, I personally feel she is wrong when she says the need for this is because counseling offered by Counseling and Psychological Services (CaPS) is insufficient. That particular justification is now the most prominent in discussions of stress culture here.
There is always talk of the need to expand mental health services in regards to stress culture because it concerns a lot of things we’ve been trained to associate with mental illness, like anxiety and suicide. However, this is a misleading connection that is not helpful to people who experience stress culture, nor to people who experience mental illness.
Clinical counseling as a treatment for someone who experiences stress in response to stressful situations merely pathologizes a normal reaction. Chironis makes an important point when she says “Maybe it’s that every time we brag to each other about our workload, we’re covering up our fear with that same bravado. On this campus, it’s normal to ignore your stress and pretend like you’re doing fine.” The problems with perceiving the people around you as happy while you are miserable are well documented. A University of Warwick study from 2011 found that when people feel as if they are struggling in a sea of thriving people, their despair is magnified by comparison.
This is a problem that is very explicitly not fixed by counseling and other mental health initiatives. This is a social health epidemic and needs to be addressed as a cultural problem, not a lack of mental health resources.
Solutions would look a lot like the aforementioned MIT Together. Working toward a culture of empathy is an important step, as is trying to broaden the horizons of students beyond immediate life on campus. When people go to therapy as a primary solution, we’re stuck in a catch-22 of either risking students’ confidentiality or putting students in a position where they still feel as if they are the lone zebra struggling to catch up to the pack as the lions close in.
The other side of this is problematic as well. Discussion of mental illness on Carnegie Mellon’s campus is incredibly stunted. We consistently hear candidates for Student Government and other faculty talk about expanding CaPS in response to stress. On the other hand, we rarely hear about depression and anxiety disorders in these discussions at all, despite both being on the rise among college students — particularly those who live far from home. CaPS is occasionally completely overloaded, sometimes needing two weeks to get students in for appointments and, as I’ve mentioned previously, shipping chronically mentally ill students off to “the community,” which is less than ideal. Students who deal with sexual assault and relationship violence and absolutely need professional help are unable to access emergency care and, when they do, are caught in a system that is unable to meet their needs.
Carnegie Mellon has a better plan for dealing with Ebola, an outbreak that happened over an ocean away, than it does for common mental illnesses. I once went to Health Services after a few sleepless nights caused me to pass out during an exam. I went home with a prescription of Zoloft for anxiety and Trazodone for insomnia. The Zoloft made me violently ill, the Trazodone did, uh, nothing, and both were prescribed after a single visit with no second thoughts. Medication is key to the process, but it has to be a process, not just a reaction. That’s not a good environment for healing.
It’s time for us to change the conversation on stress culture from a mental health dialogue to a cultural dialogue. Mental illnesses should not have to fight stress culture for oxygen and airtime and social health should not be trapped under the ill-fitting banner of mental health. It’s absolutely terrifying that our collective consciousness as a campus thinks you need a therapist to tell you it’s okay to feel a little overwhelmed sometimes and that does not devalue you as a person. 
The fact that this comes at a cost to the safety of other students shows that our reaction to stress culture — to compartmentalize and pathologize it — has become as toxic as the culture itself.

In the endless cycle that is presidential election news, we hear a lot about businessman Donald Trump and his promises for better deals. Deals with Mexico, China, you name it, Trump will make a deal with it. A great deal. You’ll see.
In the arena of current presidential news however, the congressional leaders of the GOP are faced with another deal that has a lasting effect on our nation, more than a four-year term. Obama has appointed a nominee to succeed Justice Antonin Scalia on the Supreme Court: Merrick Brian Garland. 
Obama announced his appointment last week in a clear statement to Congress: “I’ve done my job, now you do yours.” 
As per his constitutional duty, the president has appointed a justice to fill the vacancy, and the Senate will hold hearings and vote to confirm the nominee, right? Wrong. Cue the obfuscation!
In their attempt to continually be the most unproductive Congress ever, GOP Senate leaders previously stated that they would consider no nominees until after the election. “Give the American people a voice!” they cried. “Let the next President choose the justice!” They invoke such “rules” as the Thurmond rule  and Biden rule, which are both myths conjured by opponents of previous nominees. 
Many, like Senator Marco Rubio (R–FL) and Senator Ted Cruz (R–TX), say that precedent mandates not nominating and confirming justices in an election year. If you say it loud enough, it sounds true! Except for the fact that these claims are completely false. Pants on fire. 
But let’s really dig into all the hypocrisies of their argument, shall we?
First, let us address all this populist rhetoric. I get that GOP establishment incumbents are trying to sound like they want the people to choose. Let the people decide like our founding fathers intended. It’s a reasonable political ploy, especially when trying to save their seats with a fascist bag of Cheetos as the potential nominee. 
Except for that the people did choose; we chose Obama, twice. Now if some of the GOP wants to claim that the 2014 Midterm elections is a sample for the people, then they should tell that to the 66 percent of our country that did not vote in them. 
It’s simple: the voters wanted a Democrat (as they have in the last five of six general elections) in the Whit House, so he will be appointing the judges until he’s out. No more discussion.
Now, don’t get me wrong, Democrats are also at fault for holding up Supreme Court justices. In 2005, during Samuel Alito’s hearings to be on the Court, then Senator Obama (D–IL) and Senator Clinton (D–NY) voted with 22 other prominent Democrats to filibuster the entire nomination process. Only four Democrats even voted for Alito to confirm him. It has become increasingly difficult to keep the Supreme Court above politics, as it was intended. 
Still, in Alito’s case, the Democrats saw him as a more extreme conservative ideologically, and would perhaps have been more willing to support a consensus nominee, a moderate that most of the Senate could get behind. 
Keep in mind many Republican leaders have called Merrick Garland a “consensus nominee” (Orrin Hatch (R-UT), senior member of the Senate Judiciary Committee) in his previous hearings to be confirmed to the D.C. District Court of Appeals, where he has served since 1997. But we’ll come back to Garland later.
Let’s move right along on to the so-called rules. For a party hell-bent on preserving the “original intent” of the constitution, it sure is flexible on the definition of “rule.” The “Thurmond rule”  contends that the Senate will not confirm nominees to the judiciary after a certain point in an election year. 
Named after former Senator Strom Thurmond (R–SC), the rule originated in the 1968 fights over Lyndon Johnson’s Supreme Court nominations, which Thurmond on. 
Since then, this partisan suggestion has only been used when politically advantageous to the party trying to block the nominee. And yes, both parties have used it since 1968. But other than when the nominees were blocked in 1968, no one treats it as a rule. It is the Thurmond Myth.
The “Biden Rule” is named after then Senator and current Vice President Joe Biden (D–DE). This rule, as it is often called, actually is more of a suggestion taken from a speech that Biden gave as the Chairman of the Judiciary Committee in 1992. He called for no nominees to be considered until after the election, during the lame-duck period before the next President takes office. (Quick side note, Republicans. Stop calling Obama a lame-duck President. That’s not until after the election.) 
But still, Biden’s actual comments are usually glossed over with no context. He gave this speech with no nominee to consider and no vacancy to fill. He had been concerned with the growing partisan divide over judicial hearings, as Clarence Thomas’ divisive hearings had been in October of the previous year. 
Even so, the Senate never voted on his suggestion, and now the GOP is using it as a lame excuse to block the nominee while giving Biden some respect for maybe the first time ever. Had enough yet? Good, me neither.
This brings me to the last Republican bastion of argument: precedent. Justice Scalia spent his career as a direct interpreter of the Constitution. He contributed a strong conservative voice to the Court for many years. Still, Republican leaders tarnish his legacy by forging fake precedents to reject anything Obama suggests. 
As previously mentioned, Cruz and Rubio have proudly stated the “long tradition” of not nominating and confirming justices in an election year. 
Those few words are the tricky part, though. See, the thing about precedent is, you need a real set of several instances from the past to back up that “long tradition.” There has really only been two instances in the past 80 years when this situation has even happened at all. In 1940, when F.D.R. appointed Justice Frank Murphy and was confirmed, and in 1968. 
That last one sound familiar? It should, because it is when Thurmond refused to confirm any Johnson nominee. This is the only instance that holds to that model because of the phrasing of their comments. Cruz specified nominated and confirmed, which disqualifies those nominated before the election year but confirmed during one, of which current Supreme Court Justice Anthony Kennedy is one, who was nominated in 1987, and confirmed in 1988. There is no tradition of preventing nominees, only a hunger for preventing Obama any victory toward preserving his legacy.
Now, back to Garland. GOP leaders, the only people that will buy your arguments are the ones already voting for you, so why do you stall? Garland is for all intents and purposes left leaning, far more to the left of the center than Justice Kennedy is.
Still, Obama has given you the most moderate candidate 
 his party would allow. Many are still upset he did not appoint someone more liberal. Garland leans conservative on criminal cases and has a mixed record on government transparency. On an even more basic level, he is is an older, white male. 
He is incredibly qualified to be on the Supreme Court. He clerked for Justice William Brennan in the 1970s, served as a federal prosecutor for the Oklahoma City bombings in 1992, and has served on the D.C. Court of Appeals since 1997, and as its Chief Justice since 2013.
What are your options? Let’s say you manage to delay until the next President takes office. Hillary gets elected, and nominates someone more liberal, with a newly gained Democratic Senate? Or, god-forbid, Trump gets elected, and he could nominate anyone. Maybe he’ll go Caligula on you and nominate his pet horse. Is that really what you’d prefer?
My point is, if the GOP really wants to improve its general election chances, it needs to take this bargain deal now while it can; there won’t be one better. They should show the people they talk incessantly about that they can make a compromise. 
Stop the obstruction. Confirm Garland.

Donald Trump is not a joke and I’m scared. Caveat: Regardless of who you support in this election, Democrat, Republican, Independent, it is very important to acknowledge that Trump is a threat.
Quite frankly, I normally wouldn’t even speak on this matter because the discourse on Trump is so prominent, but recently I’ve come in contact with multiple people — all kinds of people — people of color, women, and other marginalized people who support Donald Trump. This happens all the time, but honestly, it’s not funny anymore. Supporting Trump as a joke or not as a joke. Is. Not. Amusing.
Recently, Brandon Stanton (from Humans of New York) posted a letter to Donald Trump calling him out as a racist, and very validly shut him down; however, despite $67 million dollars being spent on anti-Trump campaigns, his poll numbers are higher than ever.
Trump is a real threat to our society. And when I say this, I get a lot of reactions. I’d like to address some of the reactions I’ve gotten towards my fear:
“I’m gonna move to Canada!”:
Well, I am not. I can’t. Lots of people can’t. I do not have the money to move myself from one country to another spontaneously, and while this may be said facetiously, it’s literally delineating a situation that’s pretty bad. I am genuinely scared for my safety, as many other marginalized people are. I am scared for what kind of discourse Trump would spread as president, and who would get murdered. It’s happening already: there’s been a spike in hate crimes on Muslims (and other brown people — Sikh temples have been vandalized, holy books desecrated) in the U.S. since December 2015.
“At least it’s not Ted Cruz”: 
Who is spreading very violent and ridiculous discourse? Ted Cruz isn’t as outspoken and doesn’t receive as much coverage as Trump does, but he at least seems to have a cohesive vision for the nation that does not depend on rabble rousing. He himself, in fact, is a target of Trump, who decided to target his wife publicly on Twitter — where he basically called her ugly.
“But he’s just doing it to make a statement”: 
Donald Trump could be making the comments he makes to make a statement. He could actually not believe them. But the reality is he has spread an incredibly ill-informed discourse. As I said earlier, he has been very effective.
“Hillary vs. Bernie”: 
Don’t get me wrong — It’s important to have an opinion on who you’re voting for, but the fact is, when you have someone like Donald Trump to address, why are we arguing on this? 
I’d rather spend my time convincing people not to vote for someone like Trump, as opposed to arguing whether or not Hillary is better than Bernie or vice-versa.
Other than the social issues, Trump really isn’t a successful man. He really isn’t. He’s had more failed businesses than successful ones and he is $500 million dollars in debt.  
So why do people vote for him? I don’t know. They say it’s because he’s funny, he’s outspoken, he’s a businessman, and he’s “truly American” — all great things to have in a comedian, but not in a president. 
There is a saying that there is no use in trying to understand a racist ideology like Trump’s. It isn’t based upon logic.

Public schools and colleges across Pennsylvania breathed a sigh of relief last week with the end of the impasse over the state’s budget finally in sight. However, there is no guarantee the storm has actually passed, and the Pennsylvania government should not have spent nine months playing a game of chicken while schools went unfunded.
Despite lingering threats of yet another veto, Pennsylvania Governer Tom Wolf ultimately decided to let the newest Republican-proposed budget become law (albeit without his signature, as a sign of his continued disapproval). But what some are calling a victory in the Pennsylvania budget crisis has arrived nearly nine months late, and we can’t simply expect the underlying problems to go away because of a halfhearted compromise.
This budget does provide some benefits for education, a cause Wolf wants to champion during his time in office. An extra $200 million will be distributed to various districts throughout the state. In addition, state-related universities like the University of Pittsburgh, Penn State University, and Temple University will benefit from the bill — they are due to receive 5 percent more funding than they have in the past.
However, the very same schools Wolf claimed to want to help may have suffered the most during the months where the state had no budget at all. Districts resorted to borrowing money and cutting back on after-school programs and supplies in an effort to make ends meet without much help from the state government. Furthermore, the state’s poorest public school districts, like Aliquippa in Beaver County, were in imminent danger of closing their doors altogether thanks to the lack of funds.
Wolf seems to feel that paying such a cost now is worth it for the greater good of the state in the long run. Concerned about the actions of lawmakers in Harrisburg, his additional goals include preventing elected officials from receiving gifts, as well as supervising how campaign funds are used and how much outside income can be accepted.
“The consequences of that fight are starting to appear on the horizon, and that is a short term shutdown [of schools or human service agencies],” Wolf said in an article on PennLive. “But if that leads to a long-term solution to this problem, that’s a good thing.”
In reality, however, the compromise ultimately gave neither side what they wanted. Republicans, despite their plan passing, were denied the liquor privatization, changes to the state pension system, and property tax reforms they tried to implement.
On the other side, even with an increase overall to education funding, Wolf was ultimately denied an extra $400 million for schools, as well as tax increases to decrease the state’s deficit. He is still planning on vetoing the fiscal code meant to go with the budget, citing claims that some provisions for state programs are unconstitutional along with the fact that the plan would leave Pennsylvania in even more debt.
As a result of the lingering disagreements, the budget crisis is not necessarily over. With the budget for next fiscal year due in July, there’s no guarantee that the gridlock will not simply begin all over again as Wolf strives to reform state spending, even at the expense of those who desperately need any funds at all. During the nine months without a budget this year, Wolf was forced to release emergency funds to schools just to keep them afloat. If the lack of funding continues, it is almost certain that the impact on struggling districts will be devastating.
While corruption in government offices and a growing deficit are undeniably problems that must be dealt with, preventing students from learning gives rise to an entire new level of issues that permanently impact a generation of Pennsylvanians. And while Wolf’s endgame includes an increase in funding to public education, threatening the survival of schools in the meantime is simply unacceptable. The viewpoints between the parties may be different, but it is now the lawmakers’ job to find a way to resolve the issues in a way that is both legal and conscientious — not to mention timely.
One way or another, lawmakers must find a way to uphold the Constitution in the future — and they must do so without threatening the schools tasked with educating the children across the state.

This is my third student government election.  This is also my third time being disappointed by candidates.  Year after year, the candidates say they will add new services, improve existing ones, and usher in a new age of prosperity.  Year after year, nothing changes.  This election presents a new phenomenon: ignorance of basic university services and working initiatives.
For example, one candidate has suggested a peer-to-peer mental health crisis hotline.  Doesn’t he know that CaPS has a 24/7 hotline?  Another candidate suggested that someone from EMS should sit in UHS on weekends to help people decide if they need to go to the hospital. Doesn’t she realize that EMS operates 24/7?  Doesn’t she realize that student’s wouldn’t even have to walk to UHS, as EMS comes to them?  Furthermore, rather than complaining about the medical insurance money wasted on water cups, doesn’t she know that the Carnegie Mellon student health insurance fully covers all STI testing and birth control?  Multiple candidates have expressed concern about the ranking of Carnegie Mellon, but don’t they realize that there is an army of faculty and administrators devoted to this?
I believe that all of these candidates have good intentions.  In their own ways, they want to address what they believe are pressing issues for students.  My problem is not their goals but their approaches.  They are attempting to change processes in places where people are already working to improve services.  Adding a few students to initiatives that are already in progress within the university will only impede progress, not accelerate it.  This is the premise of Brooks’ Law, a commonly cited phenomenon in software engineering.
Most of our candidates seem to want to start unnecessary initiatives or interrupt existing ones.  Students deserve a candidate who is going to lead and motivate students to create solutions, not beg the university to do what it is already doing.  I encourage you all to vote with this in mind. My intention here was simply to question candidates in an open forum; I encourage candidates to respond, and invite voters to question those who would seek to lead them.

If you’re anything like me, you give an involuntary contemptuous little snort every time someone talks about neo-fascist revolutionary Donald Trump. Half a chuckle, half a sniff, this quick, sharp intake of air through the nose is the universal sign for “I can’t believe this clown is running for President — and winning.” If you’re anything like me, you thought Trump was a joke when he announced. Except the joke didn’t end in the summer like we all thought it would, or in the fall, or in the winter. Now, it’s spring, and Donald Trump is officially not funny anymore.
To be truthful, Trump never should have been funny in the first place, and his impending Republican nomination is as much our fault for treating him like a joke, as it is the media’s fault for making a circus about him and Republicans’ fault for voting for him. It’s not funny when you call Mexicans rapists and criminals. It’s not funny when you demean women for their looks, or their 
menstrual cycles, or any other reason. It’s not funny when you lead a movement to question the President’s nationality because of the color of his skin. It’s not funny when you lead a veritable lynch mob against a group of five black boys accused of a heinous crime they didn’t commit. It’s not funny when you propose a ban on an entire religion. 
But now Trump’s campaign has entered a new phase, something much scarier than even the racist, sexist, and xenophobic speech he has used in the past. And it really, really isn’t funny. Trump’s campaign has become violent, and that is a threat to democracy.
Since the beginning, there has been violence around the edges of Trump’s campaign. His rallies have always been rowdy, especially towards protesters, and violent crimes have been committed in his name. But until March, Trump was largely able to wag his finger at the violence and distance himself. His fans were simply“passionate,”  he insisted, but he would never incite violence.
Those days are long gone. On March 9, Trump’s campaign manager Corey Lewandowski was [accused of assaulting Michelle Fields](http://www.politico.com/blogs/on-media/2016/03/trump-campaign-manager-breitbart-reporter-220472, a reporter for Breitbart. A few days later, a viral video surfaced of a Trump bodyguard violently slamming a photographer from Time to the ground by his neck. These attacks on reporters came just days after Trump proposed loosening libel laws so he could silence the free press. On March 9, a Trump fan sucker-punched a protestor, and a few days later Trump publicly considered paying for the assailant’s legal fees. 
Trump frequently claims not to incite violence, but his words tell a very different story: 
Feb. 1: “If you see somebody getting ready to throw a tomato, knock the crap out of ‘em, would you? Seriously. Okay? Just knock the hell — I promise you, I will pay for the legal fees. I promise. I promise.”
March 4: “Get him out. Try not to hurt him. If you do I’ll defend you in court.”
March 9: “See, in the good old days this didn’t used to happen, because they used to treat them very rough. We’ve become very weak.”
On March 16, Trump said that his fans would likely “riot in the streets” if the Republican party used a brokered convention to rob him of the Republican nomination. This is exactly why the violent climate he has inspired is such a serious problem. What makes the United States and other democracies both secure and reliable is that we direct our government through civil processes, never through violence. While violent transitions of power are hallmarks of authoritarian governments and revolutionary guards, the United States has astounding institutional credibility that precludes violence. Absent of violence, our political system has integrity, it is strong and trustworthy. We might not always like our political leaders, but we can always trust in the power of the vote and of political action.
But when politics become violent, it is often the strongest, most brutal, most well-funded that win, and not the ones with the best ideas or a mandate from the people. By instigating a violent political climate, Trump has threatened to undermine the stability and legitimacy of our democracy. By seeking to intimidate and silence reporters and protesters, Trump has made clear that he is a threat to political freedom.
Hate speech isn’t funny. But it’s hard not to laugh, even at the most heinous of words, when they come from an orange-tinted, out-of-touch billionaire shouting outrageous things from the peanut gallery. Months later, Trump has built a movement of passionate, angry followers who seem willing to act on any violent seed he plants in their minds. We simply cannot allow ourselves to have a president whose path to the Oval Office was paved, even slightly, by violence. That is the opposite of everything our Constitution stands for. It’s time to stop laughing. It’s time to start thinking long and hard about how stop Donald Trump.
