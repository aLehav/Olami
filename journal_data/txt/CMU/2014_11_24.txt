The Carnegie Mellon University women’s basketball team received its first defeat of the season on Saturday after losing 77–71 to the visiting John Carroll University Blue Streaks. The Tartans are now 3–1 while the Blue Streaks are 3–0.
Despite shooting just 38.2 percent (26–68) from the field, John Carroll shot 13 more times than the Tartans. Carnegie Mellon shot a higher 49.1 percent (27–55). In addition, John Carroll shot 10 more free throws than Carnegie Mellon.
The Tartans had trouble getting dribble penetration until late in the second quarter, which greatly hampered their ball movement. The Blue Streaks were able to cut off several passes, ultimately resulting in 18 turnovers for the game.
With 11:32 remaining in the second half, first-year forward Kajae Jones went down with what seemed to be a hard blow to the face after getting a putback. Sophomore center Lisa Murphy, the Tartans’ leading scorer, led the defensive effort, getting a block and forcing a turnover in two back-to-back defensive efforts. However, despite great individual defensive plays, the Tartans as a whole were unable to stop John Carroll’s guards from getting into the paint and creating open shots for themselves or their teammates. Luckily for the Tartans, the Blue Streaks were unable to convert most of their opportunities.
With 5:53 remaining, Carnegie Mellon obtained its first lead of the second period 61–60 off of a Murphy steal and 3-point play. However, they were unable to solidify their lead, and with 12 seconds left, John Carroll scored the go-ahead basket, a three-pointer to put the game away.
Overall, the Tartans defended well when it came to contesting shots in the paint but also gave up a lot of open looks from the perimeter. On the offensive end, they made the shots that they got off but had so much trouble taking care of the ball that they were often unable to execute their plays. 
In the end, it was too much to overcome, and the Tartans suffered their first loss.
The Tartans continue their season on Monday when they travel to Penn State Altoona.

On a blisteringly cold Tuesday night, the Carnegie Mellon men’s basketball team took on Geneva College’s Golden Tornadoes in a white-hot battle. Despite early misses and giveaways to Geneva, the Tartans slowly but surely built up their lead before taking off in the second half en route to a resounding 82–53 victory.
The first half of the game was hotly contested. Geneva scored first after a missed opportunity by the Tartans, but the offense quickly struck back, starting a virtual back-and-forth game that lasted until Carnegie Mellon was up 25–23.
“We got off to a slow start,” sophomore forward Jack Serbin said. The slow start was due in part to the offense attempting to overextend itself and taking unnecessary risks. Forcing plays led to turnovers that kept Geneva close during the first half.
In the second half, the Tartans fired on all cylinders, making shot after shot while managing for the most part to keep Geneva from scoring.
“We just ran the offense,” Serbin said. “Our coaches had a great gameplan,” he added, saying that halftime brought the offense back into focus and gave the players an opportunity to settle down. The contest was capped off by a resounding slam dunk toward the end of the game by first-year forward Tom Kromka. 
Serbin led the team in points and rebounds, scoring 24 points and earning 11 rebounds against the Golden Tornadoes. Junior guard Jason Sebak was credited with four assists.
On defense, the Tartans dominated. Sophomore guard Matt Hillman was twice able to steal the ball from Geneva and score almost effortlessly. The team forced two turnovers more than the Golden Tornadoes, and took advantage of rebound opportunities, making 16 offensive rebounds and 31 defensive rebounds while keeping Geneva to two offensive rebounds and 19 defensive rebounds.
The win brought the Tartans to a promising 2–0 start. They kept the good feelings going, taking both rounds in the Geneva coaches vs. Cancer Tournament against Franciscan University on Friday and University of Pittsburgh at Greensburg on Saturday to move to 4–0 on the season. Serbin led the charge, putting up scores of 19 and 25. 
The Tartans continue their season Tuesday at Allegheny College.

Saturday morning saw the Carnegie Mellon women’s soccer team’s NCAA tournament run end prematurely in a heartbreaker loss to No. 20 Johns Hopkins University’s Blue Jays. The game was closely contested, with very few shots falling on net throughout the night. The scoreboard reflected this close contest, as both teams took a 1–1 draw to penalties, where Johns Hopkins prevailed 4–3.
The game started off quick as Hopkins put together an attack that resulted in a shot on goal turned away by sophomore goalkeeper Katie Liston just two minutes into the game. The play flowed back and forth from there, as neither team was able to truly gain the upper hand until ten minutes in, when first-year midfielder Tori Iatarola beat the keeper high from very deep. The goal spent most of the match all alone on the scoreboard. The only other shot on goal came from Hopkins, and cleared the crossbar. While the defensive contest seemed to favor Carnegie Mellon, Hopkins had a little more control over the flow of play. But it would take something more to overcome the lead the Tartans had already carved out for themselves.
The second half went very differently. The first five minutes saw attacks from both sides. Sophomore forward Megan Bartoshuk put the ball on net only to have it turned away, Liston added another save to her collection, and Iatarola put a shot wide all in the first five minutes. The action subsided, however, for much of the half as the teams traded the ball at midfield and struggled to put together scoring chances. With ten minutes left in the match, Bartoshuk just barely missed a chance to seal the game when her shot glanced off the crossbar. The Tartans would later come to feel that miss. With two-and-a-half minutes remaining and their tournament on life support, Hopkins put the ball in the left corner of Carnegie Mellon’s net, a stunner that revived the Blue Jays and turned the tide of the match.
If momentum affects games, a last second equalizer seems like as good a chance as any to prove it. Carnegie Mellon, however, broke the form of the match and began to dominate the first ten-minute overtime period. Two attacks resulted in shots on net by Iatarola and first-year midfielder Morgan Kontor. A third attack ended as junior midfielder Carson Quiros put a shot over the Blue Jays’ net. None of them managed to give the Tartans the win, and after a more subdued second period of overtime, the match went to penalties.
After Johns Hopkins was unable to connect on their first penalty, the Tartans seemed like they had an open path to victory, but luck was not on their side as they dropped the shootout.
The loss concludes what had been an excellent season by the Tartans which saw Liston break the shutout record, Iatarola win UAA rookie of the year, and numerous Tartans achieve all-UAA honors. Iatarola, first-year defender Keely Jelinek, and junior forward Savina Reid all made the first team, Quiros grabbed a spot on the second team, and Liston, sophomore defender Samantha Smith, and first-year defender Katie Strycharz earned honorable mentions. A penalty shootout is always a tough way to end a season, especially such a successful one.
The loss dropped Carnegie Mellon to a 16–3 record and ended their tournament run in the round of 16.

The Fédération Internationale de Football Association (FIFA) announced last week that an internal investigation cleared the organization and several host countries of any corruption in the bidding process for the opportunity to host the World Cup in 2018 and 2022. 
According to the report, Qatar and Russia won the right to have the World Cup fair and square. There’s only one problem with this investigation: it was conducted in-house, and FIFA is trying mightily to stop anyone else from having a look.
Sound suspicious to you? You’re not alone. Michael Garcia, an American prosecutor who led an investigation into FIFA’s bidding process, wrote a 430-page report on the possibility of corruption in FIFA’s bidding process and handed it to the committee responsible for investigating fraud within the organization. That committee has announced that FIFA has been cleared of all wrongdoing. They also released a summary of Garcia’s report, a representation that Garcia himself has called “incomplete and erroneous,” at the same time. Garcia has demanded that the committee release his original report in its entirety. FIFA has agreed to hand the report over to Scala, the organization’s independent monitoring body, according to NPR.
These circumstances hardly add up to a “caught-red-handed” moment for the organization. However, FIFA’s clear reluctance to let anyone else take a look at the results of their report certainly makes it look like they have something to hide. The organization and its president Sepp Blatter have been steeped in one scandal or another since the late 1990s, ranging anywhere from poor fiscal management to potential homophobia. As sports writer Dave Zirin pointed out this summer in an opinion piece for [ITAL]The New York Times[ITAL], a single entity is in charge of marketing and promoting soccer globally and monitoring that industry for graft. That arrangement is essentially an open invitation for corruption, and that’s a shame.
Soccer is one of the few things that actually transcends global boundaries. As much as people like to espouse the rise and expansion of globalization, there are few things that can make the entire world sit up and pay attention all at the same time. Even when the whole world is paying attention, it usually takes some sort of cataclysmic tragedy or violent episode to get everyone talking about the same things. Everybody most certainly doesn’t agree in soccer — because where’s the fun in that? — but we’re not being violent toward each other, and that’s a good thing. 
Soccer is a competitive sport that sparks global interaction in a productive and interesting way. 
As the purveyor of that global interchange, FIFA must be more open about its processes in order to discourage corruption.

On Saturday, the Carnegie Mellon men’s and women’s cross country teams finished their season at the Division III NCAA Championships in Mason, Ohio.
Coming off of their Mideast Regional victory last week, the men’s team was able to place 24th out of the field of 32. Senior George Degen led the Tartans with a time of 25:01.0 and 59th overall.
Filling out the rest of the field of Tartans was senior Josh Antonson with a time of 25:39.6 (157th), juniors Brian Bollens and Marc-Daniel Julien, crossing the line at 25:42.8 (167th) and 25:45.4 (174th), respectively, and sophomore Ryan Archer, who finished with a time of 25:58.6 (204th).
As a reward for their strong season, the men’s coach, Dario Donatelli was named the NCAA Division III Mideast Region Coach of the Year by the U.S. Track & Field and Cross Country Coaches Association. This was the second coach of the year award for Donatelli this season, as he received the University Athletic Association (UAA) Coach of the Year after the UAA Championships earlier this month. These are Donatelli’s third regional and second UAA awards of his career.
Representing the women’s team at the championships was junior Liz Snyder, who earned an individual bid to the race. Snyder finished with a time of 22:50.1, which was good enough for 55th out of 275 competitors. Snyder’s finish is the best by an individual Tartan since 2011.

In the vastness of space, comets hurtle through our solar system as clouds of dust and ice, producing vibrant tails when heated by the sun. Comets have always intrigued astronomers by making fleeting appearances. Ancient stargazers would only see a particular comet once in a lifetime, and originally believed them to be harbingers of doom.
On Nov. 12, the European Space Agency’s (ESA) Rosetta Mission pushed the limits of scientific exploration by making the first attempt to land on a comet’s surface. Additionally, scientists designed their probe to collect and analyze samples from the comet that could potentially provide insight into the history of our solar system and life in space. Their efforts were generally regarded as a success despite a few issues that have caused the probe on the surface to go into a temporal state of hibernation.
It is an arduous task to first chase down a comet, orbit it as the comet continues on its path in space, and eventually launch a probe from the orbiter to touch down onto the surface.
Launched in March 2004, the Rosetta orbiter carrying the probe Philae made a 10-year journey to reach the comet known as 67p/Churyumov-Gerasimenko. The comet travels in a wide elliptical orbit around the sun beyond the orbit of Neptune. Using a technique known as a gravity slingshot, the Rosetta orbiter utilized the gravitational pull of the Earth and Mars to perform multiple slingshots to provide speed boosts.
During its journey, Rosetta successfully passed by two asteroids — Steins and Lutetia — as planned, and collected further data that scientists could analyze back on Earth. Each successive rotation of the spacecraft around the sun increases the radius of its orbit. Scientists carefully calculated the journey to reach and approach the comet in orbit based on the estimated path of the comet.
Imagine having to coordinate the movement of an object the size of a few refrigerators to line up with the orbit of a cloud of dust and ice hurtling through space at remarkable speeds. Once near the comet, Rosetta uses its sensors to determine the immediate path of the comet and model its motion. When Rosetta was in orbit, scientists used the data they received to plan the ideal launching procedure for landing probe Philae. They calculated a complicated series of maneuvers to position Rosetta within just-one-and-a-half miles from the center of the comet. Previously, the closest encounter with a comet was by a NASA probe in 2004 that came within 150 miles of the comet.
Positioned in the front of the comet away from the debris of the tail, Rosetta pushed Philae out into the vastness of space to control its own destiny. Philae, named after the Philae island in the Nile River, began its lonely seven-hour trip at a speed of around one meter per second toward the surface of the comet.
At this distance from Earth, messages to be transmitted to the probe took too long to allow for any manual intervention. Scientists were forced to rely on the computer programs that they developed ten years ago to analyze the data of the spiraling comet, determine a landing spot, and accurately land there. Rosetta moved away from the comet using its cameras to keep Philae in its field of view so scientists can keep track of its descent.
Landing on a comet is very different from landing on the moon or another planet because of the comet’s non-uniform movement and weak gravitational pull that is 1/1000 of that of the Earth. Scientists were afraid that with a lack of gravity, the probe could hit the surface and immediately bounce off back into space. To prevent this, engineers developed a sophisticated landing gear to absorb momentum and fire harpoons to lock the probe to the surface of the comet.
The probe contains a multitude of instruments for collecting and analyzing the composition of the comet. A drill allows it to dig below the surface and collect a variety of samples while an alpha proton X-ray spectrometer can analyze the chemical composition.
Previous research of comet tails has shown evidence of organic compounds, which may support the idea that life originated in space and was transported on comets.
The harpoon mechanism did not launch correctly, causing the probe to bounce twice before fortunately returning to the surface of the comet. Philae landed in the shadow of a cliff, and cannot get enough sunlight to power its battery. While scientists devise a solution, they have placed Philae in hibernation by turning off all of its instruments. They are optimistic that Philae’s journey is just beginning. Regardless, this mission has been a remarkable achievement and has taught scientists a plethora about comets as we move closer to a more complete understanding of these mysterious objects.

Scientific research is generally understood to be based on well-founded reliable evidence, yet even scientific conclusions have the potential to be affected by fraud. Researchers from Carnegie Mellon University and Stanford University have created an online laboratory that has the potential to reduce fraud in the scientific community.
Conventional research structure mandates that scientists formulate hypotheses and personally test them themselves. Alternatively, Adrien Treuille, assistant professor of computer science and robotics at Carnegie Mellon, and Rhiju Das, assistant professor of biochemistry and physics at Stanford University, proposed the use of online laboratories, in which participants from the general public play online video games that allow investigation into scientific research areas.
Treuille and Das have developed their own online lab called EteRNA that focuses on the structure of RNA, a biological molecule involved in gene expression, protein synthesis, and many diseases among other functions. EteRNA participants play online games and participate in challenges to design RNA that meets certain criteria. These models are then sent to Das’s lab at Stanford where they are processed. The results of this processing are published on the EteRNA website so that participants can analyze and incorporate the results into future designs.
There are several benefits to Treuille and Das’s method of scientific research, namely the separation between research design and testing. Conventional research structure leaves space for bias, since the same individual, or group of individuals, is responsible for experimental design and procedure. In EteRNA and other online laboratories, the general public formulates hypotheses which the researchers test. This separation “makes it difficult for any individual to retrospectively adjust scientific hypotheses to match experimental results, or to cherry-pick data to reflect a scientist’s biases,” explained Treuille in a university press release.
The reduction of scientific fraud, however, is not the only benefit to this method of scientific research. By uncoupling design and testing, there is also the potential to solve the issue of immense quantities of data. In the instance of EteRNA, vast quantities of data are particularly relevant since a single RNA sequence can produce billions of data points. While this abundance of data could be overwhelming and time-consuming for a small group of researchers, when opened to the general public, it becomes less of an issue due to the large numbers of participants.
Despite the success of current online laboratories, there are still some hurdles to overcome, the largest being the legitimacy of video games within the scientific community. While the online-game style design of online laboratories has been successful in engaging the public, video games are generally not associated with scholarly research. This association could potentially cause the research to be viewed in the scientific community as less reliable. The EteRNA online laboratory was backed by the Burroughs Wellcome Fund and the W. M. Keck Foundation and can be reached through the EteRNA website, http://eterna.cmu.edu. 
Treuille and Das’s study titled “RNA design rules from a massive open laboratory” was published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.

With so many new technologies available today, from robots to responsive spaces, we have a great opportunity to make better systems for personalized learning, intelligent creativity support, and open health innovation.
“Some knowledge is sticky and hard to acquire and often you can understand that knowledge in one of two ways: A self-discovery, and a toolkit that brings about that discovery,” said Winslow Burleson, an associate professor at New York University’s College of Nursing, during a Human-Computer Interaction seminar lecture last Wednesday titled “Motivational Environments: Strategies for Personalized Learning, Intelligent Creativity Support, and Open Health Innovation.”
“If we take education broadly as being a training of individuals’ expertise for them to contribute to society and we take a perspective of time, over time we’ve had the ability to train individuals to sufficient expertise to deal with the problems of the day,” Burleson said.
As a result, people have been able to solve many of today’s problems, but as we solve these problems, even harder problems begin to appear. The difficulty curve increases rapidly, resulting in the need for a system that is able to sufficiently increase learners’ expertise to match the increasing curve. To fulfill this need, learners would have to acquire a broad range of knowledge and a deep understanding of the material. According to Burleson, this is the goal of personalized learning and teaching strategies.
Burleson said people need to be “engaged in passion-based learning” throughout their lives so that they can explore their interests and help humanity. These types of individuals are vital to solving the world’s newest problems. According to information provided by Stanford University and the University of Washington, formal learning takes up about 18.5 percent of a person’s life in grades one to 12, which is extremely rigid. Burleson argues that we can blur these lines to get a better lifelong learning opportunity.
This is the goal of Burleson’s inventors’ workshops, which are “open online and physical, peer supported and expert mentored, communities,” according to the abstract for his lecture. Focusing on the idea of Froebel Gifts, or providing gifts at the right time, such as when people need them, the workshops are designed to try to understand these gifts and toolkits. For example, one can find millions of hours of educational videos online, ranging from TED talks to online lectures from various colleges. But the problem with the workshops is that they are passive.
As Burleson critiqued, “There is no mechanism to get involved. What I want coupled with each video is a toolkit or set of toolkits.” This toolkit would provide anything from a list to the actual ability for people to manipulate some material for an immersive experience with the material. The goal of such a system for facilitating learning would be to make sure people understand nuances at many levels of expertise and views. There are many different ways to do this, such as through human-robot interaction by providing playful robotics that interact with kids.
According to the componential model of creativity, there are four main components to generating creativity. These components are intrinsic motivation, domain-relevant knowledge, creative thinking style, and external factors. As a result, we can use technology to foster each of these components. Burleson believes we can use technology such as affective computing (the development of systems that can simulate human affects), intelligent tutoring systems, creativity support tools, and context-aware systems to tackle these respective components.
At his media lab, Burleson uses a virtual learning companion to help people that believe they cannot increase their intelligence. These so-called self-theories of intelligence can be improved by allowing the companion to provide help just before the human decides to quit learning something. This help provides a metacognitive experience, which also gives the opportunity for an active experience. By linking the two, people were actually able to enjoy what they were doing. Studies show that this is the point at which people are the most creative and generate the best ideas and persevere through difficulties. Using sensors and cameras, Burleson’s lab is able to understand the experiences of various people and react to them properly.
Through studies such as the ones Burleson is conducting, we can become more aware of how people function and properly use technology to react to them. In doing so, we can further education and other fields by providing humans with better experiences. Burleson’s motivational education companion, for example, provides such opportunities and may give way to better education in the future that will hopefully allow humans to reach new creative heights.

On Nov. 3, Spotify announced that their 40 million users would be deprived of Taylor Swift’s new, platinum album 1989, and that all her previous music would be removed from their online streaming service. Swift decided to remove her music from free streaming websites with the conviction that these sites do not “fairly compensate the writers, producers, artists and creators of this music.” Swift’s actions spurred this week’s Pugwash discussion on the ethics of piracy and music streaming services.
Spotify admits that on average an artist will see between $0.006 and $0.0084 for every song streamed, and other streaming services are no better. Singer and songwriter Aloe Blacc revealed that he only received $4,000 from Pandora for his major hit with Avicii, “Wake Me Up.” Artists are making five to 10 times less per song on free streaming websites than they are from record sales on iTunes, Amazon, or directly from the artist through their website. Swift has a point — artists are not seeing as much money from free streaming sites.
Although streaming services do not compensate artists per song nearly as much as album purchases, streaming offers many alternative benefits for both users and artists. For example, music streaming is better for artists than piracy. Most music listeners are not willing to pay full price for all of their music, which leads to piracy and illegal streaming, alternatives that do not require paying a dollar every time a person wants to listen to a song. However, artists receive no royalty benefits from listeners if their music is obtained illegally. Although a seemingly insignificant amount, 70 percent of Spotify’s revenue is given back to the record labels.
Free streaming services also offer music to a wider listener base. Some people simply cannot afford to pay for music, whether in the form of a streaming subscription or an album purchase. Free streaming allows everyone to access an artist’s music legally. Free music streaming sites are also conducive to discovery. If songs were only available for purchase, you would have to value the song at a dollar in order to listen to it. That is enough of a barrier for many to not listen to a particular song for the first time. Free streaming allows users to explore genres at no cost. Smaller artists benefit from this service because they may not be discovered otherwise. This publicity can reflect in concert ticket sales.
Some Pugwash members suggested that the upswing in streaming services reflect a change in how listeners value music. Before free music was easily accessible through piracy or online streaming, people had to purchase records to own songs. A person had to value an artist’s work at about $9 to $15 to own it. This option is conducive to a small following of dedicated fans willing to invest in the artist. Now that music is either cheap or free, the listener base has expanded. However, Pugwash wonders whether the fact that we don’t need to pay as much for music suggests that music has lost its value.
Subscription-based services appear to be a compromise. User subscriptions, usually at about $5 to $10 a month, allow the company to give more royalties back to the record labels, and, therefore, to the artists. Plenty of users are willing to adopt this model. For Spotify, the proportion of users who purchase the premium service has steadily increased over the past five years. Subscription services are branching far beyond music. Websites like Scribd, Netflix, and Adobe have adopted subscription services that allow users to access unlimited books, movies, and software for a monthly fee.
Taylor Swift has brought up a good point. It is evident that artists do not make as much from streaming websites. However, free and subscription-based services are a trend that have gathered too much momentum to stop. Artists and record labels cannot contend with the ease and cost of streaming music. Subscriptions services are already a step in the right direction as a compromise between pirated music and full-priced record sales. 
People will never stop valuing music; we just need to find a platform that is both acceptable to artists and convenient for listeners.
Student Pugwash is a non-advocacy, educational organization that discusses the implications of science. This article summarizes their discussion on music streaming.

Researchers determine origin of Perissodactyla
While working in an Indian coal mine, Johns Hopkins University researchers have determined the origins of the biological group Perissodactyla, a group including odd-toed animals with distinctive digestive systems like horses and rhinos. Ken Rose, a professor of functional anatomy and evolution at Johns Hopkins, originally led the team to explore Eocene sediments in Western India due to the proposal that Perissodactyla may have originated there. The team uncovered 54.5 million-year-old bones in an open-pit coal mine northeast of Mumbai, and determined the bones belonged to Cambaytherium thewissi, an animal intermediate between Perissodactyla and more primitive animals. This discovery may also provide clues about India’s geological separation from Madagascar and collision with Asia, according to Rose.

New blood test could provide early Alzheimer’s diagnosis
New research published in the Federation of American Societies for Experimental Biology Journal suggests that a blood test detecting Alzheimer’s disease a decade before diagnosis might be possible. Researchers found a way to measure insulin resistance in the brain, which is a symptom indicative of Alzheimer’s disease. Although the sample size was small, researchers examined the blood of living Alzheimer’s patients and their blood samples taken up to ten years before their diagnosis. Based on an insulin receptor called IRS-1, researchers could tell which samples came from Alzheimer’s patients. Researchers hope to replicate these findings with a larger sample size. Commercial tests are not yet available.
The results of this research were presented at the Society for Neuroscience in Washington, D.C.

Scientists compare genomes of mice and humans
An international group of researchers has found strong evidence as to why certain processes in a mouse, such as its immune system, metabolism, and stress response, are different from those in humans while other processes are extremely similar. In a report published Nov. 19, the group detailed their findings, examining the genetics and biochemistry involved in regulating human and mouse genomes. The researchers compared gene transcription (how the genes are read) and chromatin (a protein that controls access to DNA) modification in both mice and humans. They found that there were differences in specific tissue and cell types. Now that they know which genes are conserved between mice and humans, geneticists say that a mouse is an excellent model for certain aspects of human biology.

Stanford and Brown students create biodegradable drone
Students primarily from Stanford University and Brown University teamed up with NASA to create a biodegradable drone made out of fungi. Made from mycelium, which is the vegetative part of a fungus, the body of the drone takes a week to grow in a special mold in the lab before being outfitted with motors and a circuit board. Currently, only the Styrofoam-like body is biodegradable, eventually turning into a gooey substance. However, the team is in the process of building a fully biodegradable circuit board with biodegradable motors and propellers. The hope is that these drones can be piloted into areas unsafe for humans — such as fire sites and nuclear reactors — and collect data. If the drone crashed, it would not create any waste since it is biodegradable, therefore leaving the environment unaffected.

This week, CERN physicists announced the discovery of two new subatomic particles, labeled Xi_b’- and Xi_b*-, containing three quarks bound together by the strong force, making them a part of the baryon family. The particles were discovered thanks to roughly 750 scientists from around the world and the Large Hadron Collider (LHC), which has been running proton collisions since 2008. Previously, the quark model predicted the existence of these particles, but this is the first physical evidence of their existence. This discovery can help scientists further confirm the Standard Model of particle physics, which has become the indisputable model since the discovery of the Higgs boson.

American culture is paradoxical. We seem to be increasingly health conscious and savvy, yet obesity numbers continue to rise. We seem to be striving toward a greener earth, yet gas prices continue to skyrocket. And more in the context of the Carnegie Mellon School of Drama’s production of MilkMilkLemonade, we seem to be getting a more progressive society, yet we elected a heavily conservative Congress in the latest election. Everything is not what it seems, and that was the biggest takeaway for me when I went to see this play.
Even before the play began, I could guess from the program that it would not be a traditional play. It had mazes and word searches and a whole section explaining gender neutrality in elementary language. And I knew I was right when the actors entered the colorful, farm-themed set like it was a drag show. Not to mention three out of the five male-only cast members were dressed in drag.
The play focuses on Emory (junior acting major Ben Mathews), a flamboyant fourth grader, who lives on a chicken farm and has dreams of becoming a Broadway star. Mathews plays a great version of a confident yet confused little boy whose sexuality and gender is constantly being questioned or challenged by outside forces such as his Nana (junior acting major Wesley T. Jones), a robust Bible-quoting, sickly older woman, or by Elliot (junior musical theatre major Jake Brinskele), Emory’s “creepy” neighbor.
However, Emory finds solace in his Barbie-esque doll, Starlene, and his best friend Linda (junior directing major John Moriarty), who happens to be a chicken. Together they dream about escaping to “Mall Town” where Emory can audition for a televised talent show called Reach for the Stars — a show so dream-inducing that every time Emory says the show’s name, he hilariously sings it in an overly eager pose while a single spotlight shines on him. I can still hear him singing it as I am writing this.
But his dreams are crushed by his Nana, who tells him to stop dancing and acting like a girl. Instead, she suggests Emory play with the “creepy” neighbor, Elliot, who is more butch and plays baseball. She takes Starlene away and reminds Emory of processing day, the day on which all the breathing clucking chickens are turned into frozen Tyson chicken nuggets and McDonald’s Happy Meals, also known as the day Linda dies. Emory immediately goes to warn Linda, and they hasten their plans to escape.
Amidst all of Emory’s panic, Elliot shows up on the farm and instantly starts making fun of Emory. At this point, the work of the playwright, Joshua Conkel, really shines through. The irrationality of bullying is perfectly exemplified during this exchange. Emory questions why Elliot has pyromaniac tendencies to which he responds, “Fire’s cool. You’re a faggot.”
The audience is left wondering why, if Elliot is so disgusted by Emory, he continues to stay on the farm. When asked to leave by Emory, Elliot refuses to go. Soon, Elliot starts letting his guard down and takes a rest from being on the offense. Emory and Elliot talk about their passions and fears, something Elliot is not used to as he describes his emotions being stuck in his skull and having an evil twin inside of him shifting things around. Then — get ready for it — Elliot suggests they go to the barn and have sex, presumably something they have done before. Rough life for a fourth grader, eh?
Metaphors are all around us at this point in the play. Elliot and Emory represent different experiences of the gender and sexuality spectrum. There is Elliot, whose sexuality is ambiguous; he is very confused about his feelings toward Emory. And then there is Emory, who is a confident character. But these two characters exist in the same world, a world in which society treats queer people as a different race with different rights than the rest of the population.
Coming back to the anxiety of processing day, Emory attempts to hide Linda from Nana. He insists on her hiding underneath the house, where a poisonous spider bites Linda. Linda starts foaming at the mouth and slowly reacting to the venom running through her system. Linda’s future is not looking too good, with or without the processor.
Linda runs out from the house like a chicken with its head cut off. Pun intended. Nana chases Linda down but is unable to catch her because of her condition, so she gets Elliot to do it — an action that seems to betray both Emory and Linda, though it was, in fact, inevitable; Linda would have died with or without the help of Elliot. Linda is placed into the processor, and just like that, the symbol for innocence and acceptance is turned into a Kentucky Fried Chicken sandwich.
Overall, the play was highly entertaining. It engaged with actors, music, lights, a disco ball, a fog machine — you name it — in a successful and effortless manner.

Friday and Saturday evening, Tisbert Sketch Comedy, a daughter organization of Scotch‘n’Soda, featured a variety of student-written sketches, displaying the group’s talent as both writers and actors. Joke after joke connected, aided by flawless delivery from the five actors, and made for a very entertaining show. If there was a drawback, it was that the show ended after only an hour.
The show took place in the fictional #town (pronounced ‘Pound Town,’ because of course it was), explained in a monologue consisting entirely of expertly crafted double entendre, delivered by first-year Dietrich student Brianna Hudock. The audience’s introduction to the tight community of #town was just the opener in a night’s worth of innuendo and absurdist humor that Scotch‘n’Soda is so adept at working into everything they do.
In addition to pre-written sketches, Tisbert incorporated an element of audience participation into their show. Approximately halfway through the night, junior engineering and public policy and civil and environmental engineering double major Erin Persson brought sad news to the viewers, warning everyone that the next skit “just isn’t funny.” Unsurprisingly, this statement turned out to be false as the group unleashed a patriotic bit detailing the introduction of three new members to the American Olympic curling team. After the sketch, Persson came back on stage and informed the audience that the sketch by itself was too easy; they wanted a challenge. Without context, five options to alter the sketch were presented to the audience and appeared on the screen. Bondage, one of the choices, raced out to an early lead that it unsurprisingly never relinquished.
The cast then performed the sketch again while handcuffed and otherwise tied to themselves and each other. Struggling with their new adornments, the cast tripped and stumbled their way through the scene, barely managing to recreate their version of curling as junior physics and materials science and engineering double major Yeshar Hadi ironically instructed Hudock, his fellow sweeper to “move your hands freely.”
Two sketches in particular highlighted the creative mastery behind the show.
The first, written by junior information systems and creative writing double major Chris Compendio, opened in a mundane fashion, with senior global studies and professional writing major Razghiem Golden playing a mild mannered driver being directed by a GPS. The GPS, however, quickly displayed nefarious intentions, as it instructed Golden to make illegal turns and drive on the sidewalk. The GPS began to channel its inner HAL 9000 as it directed Golden to a “shady alley” to conduct a drug deal resulting in the murder of a drug dealer played by Hadi. With the goods on hand, Golden proceeded to his final destination: church.
The second sketch featured Hadi as a recently divorced man in charge of three workers, played by Hudock, Golden, and junior BHA student Sam Riordan. Hadi came into the office infuriated by the failure of someone to refill the Brita filter in the break room. Despite his transparent references to his recently ex-wife, Hadi insisted that the empty Brita was a disgrace to common human decency, somehow reconciling his furious character with the ridiculous premise of the scene. The result was a truly hilarious scene that bordered on uncomfortable in exactly the fashion the author intended. The crowd was even left with a keepsake as Hadi slapped a banana being eaten by one of the characters into the second row.
“It was a dream come true, honestly,” said sophomore decision science major Maggie Davis, who directed the show. “This was my first directing experience with Scotch’n’Soda, and I was really nervous about the product. But seeing everything come together and seeing how everyone enjoyed it; it was so exciting.” It was certainly a successful first stop in the director’s chair.
Smart writing and an excellent cast meshed exactly as well as you would expect, and made #town an extraordinarily fun evening.

There are perhaps few days greater in the life of a Carnegie Mellon student than the first one free from the shackles of Red 9. No longer confined to the boundaries of campus eateries, a student’s tongue is allowed to wander free amongst the tasty fields of the Pittsburgh food scene. While this sovereignty will initially manifest itself in piles of Dominos boxes and a fridge half-full of spoiled food, eventually one’s leash will be gently yoked by the call of the Margaret Morrison food trucks.
Considered by some to be the best-kept secret of Carnegie Mellon student life, the Margaret Morrison food trucks are a staple of many upperclassman and graduate student diets. Serving a wide variety of eastern foods — including Indian, Thai, Chinese, and Middle Eastern — the food trucks are an embodiment of Carnegie Mellon’s international atmosphere and diverse cultural spectrum. Now, with the Nov. 17 opening of Camión Mexicana Universidad (CMU), Margaret Morrison Street has welcomed the Western hemisphere and a delicious offering of burritos to its ever-faithful stomachs.
Walking down the line of trucks, you’ll know you’ve reached Camión Mexicana Universidad when you hear the salsa music. Covered in “authentic” Mexican decorations — including red pepper lights, a picture of Consuela from Family Guy and assorted stock photographs of Mexican food — the truck is as inviting as a food truck can be. A woman behind me in line one day mentioned that she felt like she was at a party. It was 18°F outside that day, so any positive emotion was certainly difficult to elicit from a customer. A testament to the power of salsa, perhaps?
Serving a simple menu of burritos, rice bowls, and hard-shell tacos, Camión Mexicana Unversidad is the perfect option for those looking to avoid the long trek to Chipotle in Oakland. Patrons have the option of a chicken, pork, ground beef, or vegetable/tofu burrito or rice bowl for $6.50. They can add grilled steak for an extra dollar. Pinto beans, salsa, rice, and cheese come in the burrito; sour cream and hot sauce are available upon request. One taco costs $2, two cost $4, and three cost $5 and come in either ground beef or veggie.
While there are tacos and bowls, everyone knows that there’s only one choice when burritos are on the menu: burritos. And man, Camión Mexicana Universidad has some good burritos. I’ve eaten food from the truck every day since the opening and have sampled a good portion of the burrito meat offerings. The ground beef burrito is your average ground beef burrito — nothing out of this world, but certainly tasty. The chicken is much of the same.
The pork, though, is something to talk about.
I don’t know if it’s possible for one’s life to truly be changed by a burrito, but the thought had never even entered my mind before I had this pork burrito. The pork is an interesting mix of sweet and tangy, and when you throw the hot sauce in there, things just get crazy. The fact that I live just across the street from this food truck will likely be the end of my checking account. (Guess what? They accept cards!)
For those with extra dollars to burn, the grilled steak is worth the upgrade. While it does not offer the same symphony of flavor as the pork, it holds up. The steak is good quality ­­— not too tough or laden with those “mysterious” qualities that street food patrons know all too well.
There is perhaps no other food as universally loved as the burrito. Who doesn’t love a good burrito? No one, that’s who.
Until last Monday, however, there was no way that students could indulge in the people’s food. 
Until last Monday, the only way one could procure “authentic” Mexican cuisine on campus was to trudge their way to either El Gallo de Oro in the Cohen University Center or Take Comfort in the Resnik House one day a week. The introduction of Camión Mexicana Universidad has brought the Carnegie Mellon culinary scene into a new era, one where everyone is happier because they can grab a burrito before class. Carnegie Mellon should perhaps take a lesson from the food trucks instead of stealing business from them with its own food truck, the Tartan Express. Camión Mexicana Universidad has done more in a week to make this campus a happier place than a million Mindfulness Rooms ever could, and that’s a fact.
Seriously, you should go out and try this pork burrito.

Whenever we sit in a movie theater, whether we are eagerly waiting to watch the new superhero movie or the highly anticipated foreign arthouse flick, there are only a select few whose names, when floating in the trailers section on the big screen, immediately grasp the attention of a diverse array of audiences. Christopher Nolan happens to be one of the figureheads of filmmakers whose style and ideas are so compelling that his name simultaneously attracts both critical and mass audiences. With powerhouse films like the Dark Knight trilogy and Inception under his belt, Nolan again pushed film further along the edge with his space-age sci-fi epic Interstellar. The film is his largest in terms of scope and ambition, with a cast comprised of Oscar nominated-winning heavyweights. Matthew McConaughey, currently in the gilded age of his career aptly named the McConaissance, stars as the film’s reluctant hero (why all heroes in film nowadays have to be “reluctant” heroes is beyond perplexing. but moving on).
The film opens with outside commentary of elderly people reminiscing about their youth, which takes place in our own future. During their time, the world is dying. Civilization has regressed into a heavily agrarian society, with crops going extinct every year and further threatening the state of mankind. The elderly men and women talk about the storms of dust that smother their way of living.
Farmers are desperately trying to sustain crops, but to no avail. The final year of growing okra is soon followed by a sudden dependence on growing corn, which too is about to die out. In the midst of this rural crisis is the widowed Cooper (McConaughy), a former NASA pilot turned farmer struggling to raise crops, along with his two young children. While the cause of this environmental apocalypse is unknown, the situation soon becomes clear as Cooper coincidentally stumbles upon the NASA headquarters: Save the world by abandoning Earth and finding a new planet.
This is where the story takes its expected Nolan twist and gets tricky. After Cooper magically finds NASA and his former mentor Dr. Brand (Michael Caine), Cooper makes the terrifying journey with fellow astronauts by venturing through a wormhole orbiting the planet Saturn, thus giving entryway to a whole galaxy of potential worlds for the humans to inhabit. What ensues is a perplexing exploration of time relativity in space and the attempt to portray universes in multiple dimensions. It’s mind-bending, yes. But Nolan takes storytelling literally out of the stratosphere with his ability to compel the audience into immersing themselves into the journey. The adventure through the solar system is nothing short of breathtaking with resplendent shots of planets overlaid by sounds of rainstorms, heightening the idea of being displaced from our physical Earth and really experiencing what could possibly be beyond it.
Many critics will inevitably call Interstellar the Millennials’ 2001: A Space Odyssey, but it would be unfair and reductive to slap that label on the film. 2001 is the ultimate sci-fi epic with an influence so powerful that it will impact any future film made within the same genre, consciously or not. Nolan, however, is careful to steer away from such comparisons by heavily imbuing the narrative with emotion and empathy. While the film provides framework built upon complex and confounding ideas, the narrative is driven by themes of connection between love and survival, or at least tries very hard to do so. Is love a construct that’s built through years of evolution, and is it necessarily efficient? Familial love incentivizes people to protect their children and, by extension, their children’s generation.
Cooper’s one and only motivation to even commandeer a space exploration is to ensure survival for his children’s generation. It’s a utilitarian concept, so can it be quantified? The film makes a halfhearted attempt to question the validity of romantic love. Films usually like to use children as vehicles for planting unearned sentimentality, but tend to fall short by a lack of development in the characters. The films’ relationships with children end up as contrived copouts that add unnecessary melodrama. But the characters in 
Interstellar are so humanly flawed that the desire to abandon the Earth, and everything humans know, is a terrifying one.
Throughout the journey, there is still that gut-wrenching hope that Cooper gets to see his children again one last time. The idea of love in this film is solidified and thoroughly visceral enough to make the motivations of Cooper’s journey all the more powerful. Love provides intuition that traverses time and space, and the possibility that love and empathy are forces powerful enough to drive the narrative is what makes the film so fascinating. It is nearly a metaphorical exploration of existential themes of life and death, loving and letting go.
Interstellar is complex and not meant to provide answers, but rather pose very big questions. Science is what advances the human race, but how much good will it do without an endless capacity for love and empathy? Nolan’s film is an exquisite odyssey that creates appreciation for the beauty in our world and what’s beyond it.

In continuing my mission to put a human face to countries that seem far away from our daily lives, I sat down last week with two Pittsburgh doctors, one from Palestine and one from Israel. While these two men work incredibly long hours, overseeing surgeries and completing fellowships, their families live in the midst of turmoil abroad. Practically a world away, they live double lives as the doctors who heal us and as first-hand witnesses of a conflict that needs to be healed.
Nael Althweib
After he insisted on buying me coffee, Nael Althweib, 28, clad in baby blue scrubs with scholarly-looking glasses, sat down and smiled widely, ready to tell his life’s story. Born in Bethlehem, Althweib was one of six children. “It was a small town, so with a large family, we had small
adventures,” Althweib said. When it came time for him to study at a university, he accepted a scholarship to study medicine in Syria because that was all that his family could afford at the time, especially with so many children. By the time his fifth year of study rolled around, he “realized [he] needed more than that” and applied to do his rotation in the United States at Cornell University. He later returned to Palestine to finish medical school before coming back to the States to “enhance and practice” his medical training. It was then that Althweib found himself in Pittsburgh.
“In Bethlehem, there is no medical system in place. We lack simple stuff.... There are no X-rays, the hospitals are small, and if we lack it, we cannot do [surgery]. Our ICU was seven beds in a large room, all jammed in. It was like, ‘How can I pursue and learn anything there? I can’t.’ ”
Althweib described the stark differences in the medical systems, most of them heartbreaking and all seemingly-hopeless: “Most of the doctors there finish medical school in Eastern Europe and come back to practice to get experience, which they don’t have from real training. Some of them do procedures that they have not been trained to do,” he said. Althweib said that the state of the medical system in Bethlehem made him even more persistent in coming to the United States to study.
That determination carries him further than just the present in Pittsburgh. “The plan is for me to go back there. I feel that if I went back, I could achieve something and help those people in a better way,” Althweib said. “I have no one here — no family. I would miss the small things, like having a car. You don’t know how good those things are until they’re gone. But I want to go back to help my family.”
“My family is supportive even though they had difficult lives. Financially and through every aspect, their life was difficult. In five years, I can help my family. They were supportive when my sister went to France and when my sister went to the U.S. and when I did, and they are still supportive. They would like me to come back,” Althweib smiled. “But I’m addicted to the medical lifestyle. You feel that you are self-rewarded because you achieve something or at least, by trying to treat people, [cure] diseases. And you would feel it better if you went to somewhere like my country, where lots of people who are really sick feel abandoned. They are so thankful for you helping them; imagine when you give them something small.”
Though the struggles that his family and friends encounter are in his mind everyday, Althweib remembers tougher times in 2001–02. “There’s lots of fighting. But my family — they’re used to it. They say ‘What can we do? This is our life, and we can’t change it.’ ”
Althweib said that growing up in Palestine is tough. “A lot of people back there are waiting to have such an opportunity, because their routines are so troubling. Getting transportation, going to school — it’s not easy to do. It would take a lot of fortitude to do this stuff, and it would be nice if people can just realize how difficult our life is in that part of the world. I think we have a long way to go.”
Yaniv Shilo
Tall and serious, Yaniv Shilo is a urologist at UPMC McKeesport. When I met with him, he was on his way home from work to spend time with his wife and three children, Ido, Yali, and Mika. Born in Israel in Ra’anana, a suburb of Tel Aviv, Shilo did what every 18-year-old man in Israel does: served with the Israel Defense Force (IDF). He spent four years within the IDF’s intelligence units as an officer. He spent one year studying biology and then the next few in medical school, where he found his true calling. After a residency in Israel, he applied to do a fellowship in the United States and came to UPMC.
Being a doctor in both countries, Shilo noted that insurance is a key difference: “In Israel, everyone has welfare. Whenever you need a treatment, it is done. Anyone can get any kind of treatment. Here, it is hinged on who has what insurance,” Shilo said. “And the sheer volume of operations that I am exposed to or that I help with is much, much larger.”
In the midst of all of his medical work and chasing after three children under the age of ten, Shilo keeps up with Ynet, the Israeli news channel that he watched back 
home. That’s where he gets most of his news, he said, because as far as he can tell, U.S. channels are fairly biased. “I knew that even back in Israel, that U.S. news usually only shows one side of things. So I’m not really following everything from the U.S. news.”
All the same, Shilo finds that people, especially in Pittsburgh, are curious and happy to discuss Israel with him. “Pittsburgh is a paradise for Israelis and for Jews. It is so easy to be here because the community is so large,” Shilo said. “My family has made the decision to stay here, and my family back in Israel is very happy for us. They have visited and they are very happy with the success we have found here and the place where we live.” Shilo admitted, “I worry about my family, but not because I’m here. I worry about them because I am worried about them.”
Shilo, his wife, and their family, travel back to Israel once a year. Though their youngest is the only one of their children who was born in the United States, they are
all well-connected to Israel. Shilo said that his children consider it the better place, because the time they spend there is usually on vacation, being spoiled by family and friends. Shilo considers Israel one of the most beautiful places in the world: “Israel is a small country, but despite being small, it’s gorgeous. It’s sometimes unbelievable ... the extremes you can find within such a relatively small place. In the north, it’s very green with lots of water and in the south, it’s more of a desert.”
“We as Israelis are proud of how much we know every little piece of the country,” Shilo said. Beginning early in childhood, he, his siblings, and their friends would explore “every little bit” of the country and get to know it intimately. “There are so many great places — rivers, mountains, just so much,” Shilo said.
Shilo encouraged people to look beyond the media coverage of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and explore Israel. “It’s unfortunate that the entire area is implicated. It’s a lovely country to visit, and the entire region has so much to offer. I wish it was more peaceful and safe and the energy was tunneled into showing the good things rather than the bad.... Most of the time, I think it’s important to mention that things are not as bad as they look according to the media,” Shilo said. “It’s true that there are a lot of things going on ... but the media is not always showing the real picture.”
Co-existence, he said, is not such a far-fetched topic as the media makes it out to be. “There’s a lot of work that [is] being done together. There is co-existence in a very beautiful way that both sides are trying to achieve. It is sure that there is not great love, but it is certainly not as bad as it seems.”
Editor’s note: This article is part of a series called Voices from Abroad, designed to shed light on foreign affairs through profiles that show an on-the-ground perspective from the eyes of Pittsburgh people who are from those areas.

Before I bake for my friends and family, I spend at least two days stressing about what I want to make — especially around holidays. It has to be something everyone will like, something I will like, and something that will be fun and seasonal.
Since this is The Tartan’s last issue for the semester, I want to leave you with a holiday flavor. I was considering gingerbread, cranberry, and peppermint when I remembered what I made for my family last Christmas — nutmeg cupcakes with eggnog frosting. They were so perfectly seasonal and delicious that I knew this was the recipe to share with you.
Holiday flavors have such a unique, nostalgic ability to capture our hearts. With just one sip of eggnog, a whole flood of Christmases past come back. When I ate this cupcake again this week, I was transported back to my Grandma’s house for our Christmas party last year, where I sat around the dining room table with my aunts and uncles and cousins, full of that good ol’ holiday cheer. I hope to put a little of that spirit in your hearts with these cupcakes!
For the cake, I used a spice cake recipe, which typically includes cinnamon, allspice, ginger, and nutmeg. I altered the recipe by removing the other spices and increasing the quantity of nutmeg. Don’t be afraid to pump up the volume on the nutmeg; even though it can be a pretty overwhelming flavor in some contexts, it can get buried under the cake and frosting if there isn’t enough, and we don’t want that.
For the frosting, I use my standard buttercream recipe, (which couldn’t be easier) but replace some of the milk with eggnog. If I replaced all of the milk with eggnog, the 
frosting would be too thick and sticky, so the milk is important for thinning it out.
The following recipe makes 24 standard-sized cupcakes.
Nutmeg Cupcake
2 1/2 cups of flour
2 teaspoons of baking powder
1 tablespoon of nutmeg
1/4 teaspoons of salt
1 stick of butter, softened
1 1/4 cups of packed brown sugar
3 eggs
1 teaspoon of vanilla extract
1 1/4 cups of milk
Eggnog Frosting
2 sticks of butter, softened
4 cups of powdered sugar
1 teaspoon of vanilla extract
1 1/2 tablespoons of milk
1/4 cup of eggnog
Instructions
If you’re the type of person who likes to do things in advance, (not me) then I recommend preheating the oven to 350 degrees and putting cupcake liners in two trays for a total of 24. Then combine all of the dry ingredients: flour, baking powder, salt, and nutmeg. Put them in a bowl and give them a whisk.
Next, cream the butter and brown sugar together, which is infinitely easier with an electric mixer (all hail KitchenAid). Creaming means that they aren’t just combined, but they start to break down and get really fluffy and amazing. Then add the eggs in one at a time, followed by the vanilla. The final step is to add one-third of the dry mix, then half of the milk, and alternate those steps until everything is added. Once you have a delicious, aromatic batter, divide it evenly among the liners. (Pro-tip: If you use a standard-sized ice cream scooper, this will go so much faster!) Bake them for 18 minutes. You’ll know they’re done when you tap the tops and the cake springs back with no dent left behind.
While those cool, you can start on the frosting. Cream the butter like earlier until it’s smooth and shiny. Then start adding the powdered sugar about a cup at a time. When it gets crumbly, add some liquid to thin it out. Keep repeating this until all your ingredients have been added. If it doesn’t taste eggnog-y enough, add more. But counter that addition with more powdered sugar so you maintain good consistency. Also, for those of you 21+ really looking to get in the holiday spirit, try using some spiked eggnog.
If you feel comfortable with a piping bag, I think these look so perfect with a star tip. It’s so Christmas-y! If not, spreading the frosting on with a knife or spatula is still wonderful. After all, it’ll taste the same either way! You can also top it with a little bit more nutmeg for some extra color and flavor. And at long last, you have beautiful, scrumptious cupcakes that Santa himself would die for.

Dear Evan,
I started living with two girls and a long-haired guy this year. Now, every time I try to take a shower, the water backs up to my ankles because their hair keeps clogging up the drain. I have to keep a mechanical pencil in the bathroom to poke a hole in what looks like an insect’s lair, so that I can drain the water every morning.
I would take the hair out, but I’m just too disgusted to do anything about it myself. I’d also bring it up with my roommates, but I don’t want to create a hostile living environment (and I’m afraid they’ll just make me do it). Also, with Thanksgiving coming up, they all offered to make dishes, since I have to be at work that day — I’m a cashier at a … an adult product store. But I can’t go on like this! 
Help! Desperately, Hate to Ask, Instead Reliving Yesterday by Stabbing Aqueous Cocoon
Dear HAIRY SAC,
Sounds like a real conundrum! Well, not really. You’re just a wuss.
Why haven’t you quit your job yet? A workspace that doesn’t give you Thanksgiving off is a space not worth working in. Unless they give you freebies, in which case, follow your dreams. Although why you can work there and be too squeamish to clean up some hair from the bottom of your shower doesn’t make much sense to me.
You probably don’t have the time, since you go to Carnegie Mellon, but take a fork, or chopsticks, or giant sewing needles, and spool up the hair. Then, knit three braids out of them and tack one on each of your housemates’ doors. They’ll admire your ingenuity, and I’m sure they’ll get the idea.
If they don’t react, and you find another moist cocoon lounging around in your drain a couple days later, then you’ve already figured out how to remove the hair without touching it, so you might as well make some use for it. Knit yourself some mittens for these cold winter days to show off to your housemates — maybe even a sweater! A passive-aggressive sweater.
The best time for a striped (passive-aggressive) sweaterrrrrr is all the tiiiiiiime,
Evan Kahn

We’ve all heard the mantra time and time again: “If you want something bad enough, go for it. Never let anything get in the way of your dreams.” While resonant at some early point in our lives, this phrase has turned into a comfortable cliché often thrown around during commencement speeches. But, really, how bad do you want “it”? In the case of 19-year-old jazz drummer Andrew Neyman (Miles Teller), “it” is the all-too-close yet so-far-away ideal of becoming one of the greatest jazz musicians of his time (think a modern-day Buddy Rich). He’s passionate and driven, attending the prestigious and fictionalized Shaffer Conservatory of Music when, during a night of intense practicing, he unknowingly attracts the attention of renowned conductor Terence Fletcher (J.K. Simmons).
From the moment that Fletcher is introduced on the screen, it’s pretty clear that this is a man with a no-holds-barred personality. He bares the stern and unflinching presence of a military commander more than a conductor. What’s important about Fletcher is that he is no-nonsense: If musicians don’t live up to his standards, he’ll push them beyond even their own expectations. On paper, that principle sounds wonderfully uplifting. Upon execution, however, Fletcher enforces a brutal and ugly awakening that success cannot be romanticized or idealized. Suffering is paramount. And then more suffering. And more suffering. It’s part of the process to break down the musician’s soul and rebuild it again into a more formidable one.
For Andrew, he comes to this realization after Fletcher offers him a spot in his jazz ensemble. After initially encouraging Andrew to just “play his best and relax,” Fletcher unleashes his ferocious tactics of merciless screaming, face-slapping, and chair-throwing upon Andrew. Of course, Andrew cries. Even then, Fletcher doesn’t back down. He taunts him even further. While this moment was enough for the audience to cry and give up for Andrew, he simply picks up his drum sticks and awaits another grueling day with Fletcher.
Whiplash delves into the world of jazz by studying the unforgiving and uncompromising master-student relationship. Seen through Andrew’s eyes, it’s more like the tale of Sisyphus: he shows incredible perseverance in the face of Fletcher’s overwhelming discouragement. Simmons is astounding in his portrayal of the unnerving Fletcher, who ultimately tests Andrew’s desire to be a “real musician”: to serve the drums rather than serve his own self-satisfaction because, ultimately, self-satisfaction is an entirely separate idea from self-fulfillment. In this sense, their relationship is one of redemption, in which Fletcher only wants to bring out the best in Andrew. Even through the screaming and taunting, Andrew practices harder and harder. It’s through these moments of demanding cruelty in which we, as the audience and individuals, realize the depth of our desire of how bad we want “it.” If Andrew can tolerate the worst-case mentor scenario depicted by Fletcher, what else is there to actually stop him?
Through the seemingly esoteric premise focused on the lives of jazz musicians, writer-director Damien Chazelle heightens the intensity of what’s now considered a niche culture and presents the film more like a thriller. He also eschews the typically feel-good moralistic undertones that cling to underdog triumphing in a sports or arts related field. Instead, Chazelle courageously shows the ugly side of success that so many people are too afraid to consider when it comes to sugarcoating their own American Dream.

On Monday, Student Government launched a new website as part of an initiative to engage the student body.
The website, spearheaded by Student Body President Ian Glasner and his cabinet, was created by junior information systems major Jake Correa, chief technology officer, and senior design major Sam Ahmed, chief marketing officer.
"It is our hope that the website will help to gauge students' interest of different issues to better allocate Student Government's limited time and resources," Glasner, a senior electrical and computer engineering and business administration double major, said.
The website, which requires a valid Andrew ID to vote, lists on its home page five initiatives that were conceptualized by Student Government. Students can vote on which of the projects they think the cabinet should concentrate its efforts on. The current listed initiatives concern: the university moratorium policy (better known as the 'no class policy'), a tobacco-free campus policy, an internal discipline process for underage alcohol consumption, increased promotion of the cross registration program, and expanded shuttle and escort services at peak travel hours.
According to Glasner, the website, which was conceptualized in May, will feature initiatives that rotate every six to eight weeks during the year to "continuously gather feedback from the student body." After the current iteration, Glasner said, the cabinet hopes to feature ideas taken from students across campus.
The website is available at https://stugov.andrew.cmu.edu/stu-inits/ideas.

Students, staff, and faculty poured into the Posner Center last Monday, filling the seats and lining the walls, to begin a discussion about the university’s long-term goals as it develops a new strategic plan.
The town hall marks the first of three open public town halls to discuss the goals and focus of the plan. 
Future town halls are tentatively scheduled for January and March, with the rollout of the final plan scheduled for September. Additionally, as discussions continue, there will be opportunities to discuss more focused aspects of the plan with leaders guiding the planning process.
Interim Executive Vice President John Lehoczky took to the podium first.
Lehoczky stressed the impact of previous strategic plans, citing such feats as the creation of what is now the Jared L. Cohon University Center and a focus on the student experience under Robert Mehrabian’s leadership, as well as the move into biotechnology under Jared Cohon’s administration.
“We can only imagine what sorts of ideas will come up and [what] directions the university will move in the next few years and the next ten years,” Lehoczky said of the strategic planning process. “So this kind of process really can play an integral role in developing and strengthening the university.... We’re here to listen to your ideas.”
Interim Provost Nathan Urban spoke next to introduce the strategic plan’s three areas of focus, which include “Transformative Teaching and Learning,” “Transformative Research, Creativity, Innovation, and Entrepreneurship,” and “The Transformative CMU Experience.”
The leaders of the first two focus areas, or thrusts, hope to explore how they can develop the plan looking at the context in which the university is operating in terms of its relation to the rest of the world, the opportunities that the university has through its strengths and potential for improvement, as well as barriers and questions that arise as the university plans change. 
For the campus experience thrust, the leaders are asking what core values drive campus life, what key areas impact students (including professional, personal, and community development), and students’ roles within the university, both academically and non-academically, as well as their roles in the outside world.
“It’s about developing a shared vision for the future of the university,” said Interim Provost Nathan Urban. “Shared — we want to make sure that we’re getting input, getting feedback, from the whole campus community about where the university should be going. And it’s a vision. It won’t be as concrete as a plan. It’ll be something that is aspirational. We’ll be thinking about where it is we want to be over the next five years, ten years, possibly beyond.”
For each thrust there is a steering committee that will guide discussion and decision-making related to their area of expertise. For the Transformative Teaching and Learning thrust, there is an initial committee of 22 members. For the Transformative Research, Creativity, Innovation, and Entrepreneurship thrust, there is an initial committee of 29 members, and for The Transformative CMU Experience thrust, there is an initial committee of eight members. Thrust leader Michael Murphy explained that the committee will grow, but is smaller than the other committees because “we’ve got so many other groups who focus on facets of this in a way that’s somewhat unique to this pillar — that is cross-institutional groups who play in this domain space and who we think can have significant influence.” Murphy cited alumni groups, parents, and Student Senate, among others, as groups that are already involved in discussions surrounding the focus of the thrust.
After the thrusts were introduced, Urban asked the audience what Carnegie Mellon’s core values are and what makes the university distinct. He also asked those present to discuss trends in higher education that should inform the plan, and how to engage the campus community in the process before opening the floor to an hour of discussion.
Members at the town hall discussed a range of topics, from the prominence of the university’s brand across the country, leveraging alumni and their successes, the nature of relationships across the university, and the notion of looking at the university’s weaknesses in order to improve, among other topics.

The year of 2014 has seen the issue of sexual assault driven to the forefront of national debate through college student-driven initiatives and an increasingly public dialogue concerning the sexual lives of students.
In September, Carnegie Mellon University was one of over 60 colleges investigated by the U.S. Department of Education’s Office for Civil Rights (OCR) after the American Civil Liberties Union filed a Title IX Complaint against the administration, citing the school had allegedly failed to protect a first-year student from her verbally and sexually abusive ex-girlfriend. 
In late October, Carnegie Mellon students carried mattresses on campus for “Carry That Weight Day,” a national movement aiming to create awareness of sexual assault and solidarity with sexual assault survivors.
Yet real change, both culturally and physically, has only just begun. Carnegie Mellon students finished this fall semester by encouraging and extending campus dialogue on sexual assault.
Sexual assault and relationship violence prevention roundtables were hosted on campus this past week by student group Got Consent?, Student Senate’s Sexual Assault and Relationship Violence Prevention (SARVP) committee, and various members of Carnegie Mellon’s administration. The program, which began Nov. 18, includes seven separate roundtables, the last of which occurs on Nov. 25, to cover diverse Carnegie Mellon communities and issues related to sexual violence.
Beginning with the theme of “Greek Life, Athletics, and Sexual Violence Prevention” on Tuesday, the roundtables continued with the following issues: “Primary Prevention of Sexual Violence at CMU,” “Sexual and Relationship Violence in the LGBTQA Community,” “Prevention and CMU Graduate Students,” “Violence Prevention and the Law,” “Sexual and Relationship Violence Prevention: Orientation and the First-Year Community,” and “International and Underrepresented Student Voices.”
The organization of the roundtables came as a response to the OCR roundtables earlier this fall. President of Got Consent? and senior vocal performance major Taylor Rawley, and sophomore statistics major Vaasavi Unnava and junior decision science major Julia Eddy of Student Senate’s SARVP Committee, as well as Carnegie Mellon’s Coordinator of Gender Programs & Sexual Violence Prevention Jess Klein united to create a similar, yet more student-oriented conversation.
Unnava and Eddy explained that they had been wanting to host an event like the roundtables for a while. Klein expressed that she wanted “to piggyback off of what wasn’t said during what we thought were going to be roundtables.... This is the response to that, so that people can say what they want to say.”
“After the OCR sessions, where the Office for Civil Rights came in, I think a lot of students, myself included, thought that was going to be more of a discussion and was going to actually get things done,” Rawley said. “And really what it was — and I completely understand why it was like this — it was more of an interrogation, really. Because they’re doing an investigation.... And so I think a lot of students left; [they felt] like they weren’t able to get their questions answered, they weren’t able to get their voices heard, to make any positive change.”
Rawley revived Got Consent? two years ago after he completed Sexual Assault Awareness training and was encouraged by Jess Klein to reboot the organization. After hosting a sexual assault awareness-themed water pong tournament last April for Sexual Assault Awareness Month, Got Consent? plans on inviting various speakers and comedians for a Sexual Assault Awareness event this coming spring.
At Tuesday’s “Greek Life, Athletics, and Sexual Violence Prevention” session, notecards were passed around to the crowd, which consisted mostly of fraternity brothers and male athletes. The students were asked to suggest questions and comments for the room to discuss. Some issues put forward included healthy, non-violent masculinity, the responsibility of universities to respond to sexual assault allegations, making the conversation on sexual assault a preventative instead of reactionary one, opening the debate to those who are not as aware of the issue, and creating a healthier dialogue on sex for athletic teams.
“We’re really trying to highlight these sort of falling-through-the-crack areas that need to be addressed, but are sometimes hard to pinpoint when you are in a type of OCR setting,” Rawley explained.
The roundtables aimed to include, but not highlight, administrative voices. Instead, the roundtables created a space for students to communicate with the administration and their fellow students. “We all made it very clear that this was student-driven,” Rawley said. “And I think that from the turnout that we saw that’s very, very clear that students are wanting to participate in this. Students are wanting to be heard.”
Jess Klein detailed in an email to The Tartan three things she feels would benefit from further attention: “1. Education and engagement for graduate students. 2. Making policy and reporting procedures more transparent to the student body. While these things are NO secret, they aren’t necessarily put out there publicly for people to find. 3. Keeping the campus community engaged and interested in this topic, even if they feel like it has ‘nothing to do with them.’ ”
Rawley commended the administrative members in the audience. “They also see that there is a big problem with the way students view the administration — how we are required to deal with sexual assault and relationship violence reports. They’re very eager to hear what we have to say,” Rawley said. “I think [the administration’s] main goal too was to avoid giving a presentation. And I know that sometimes it can get that way a little bit, because they do have knowledge about things that we just don’t have. For example, when Gina stood up and talked about the reporting process, that is an appropriate time I think for her to take the floor. And we’re going to have another session about reporting and legal aspects, later, with the Chief of [University] Police Tom Ogden. That’s just something we don’t know about as students, and I feel like that’s something we need to be educated about.”

The Elbow Room, a longtime comfort food staple of 5533 Walnut St. in Shadyside, closed on Sunday. The announcement that the restaurant was being sold was made on its Facebook page on Oct. 9, and restaurant owner Michael DiFiore posted on The Elbow Room’s website that “after 35 years we are selling The Elbow Room,” inviting the restaurant’s former patrons to visit his three other restaurants in Shadyside: Buffalo Blues, Bites and Brews, and 1947 Tavern.
1947 Tavern, at 5744½ Ellsworth Ave., was the original location of The Elbow Room. In 2010, the restaurant moved to what was previously Max & Erma’s at 5533 Walnut St., and its first location became 1947 Tavern. DiFiore bought the restaurant in 2003 from his parents, Joe and Nancy DiFiore, who themselves bought The Elbow Room in 1983 with J.T. Waters.
The restaurant is closing, the owners said, because it is becoming increasingly difficult to staff, given Pittsburgh’s recent restaurant boom.
The Elbow Room was sold to the Trapuzzano Group, LLC, which is currently in the process of transferring over the location’s liquor license to Trapuzzano Italian Chophouse, LLC.
The Elbow Room first announced the sale on their Facebook page, posting “We will be open as The Elbow Room for another two months and would love to see you and hear your stories about your favorite Elbow Room memory. We know many of you had your first date with us, got engaged, celebrated birthdays and had family celebrations. Stop up for dinner or a drink and share your stories with us! Little Joe will be waiting for you!”
“I’m kind of upset about it,” said senior professional writing and creative writing double major Aubrey Moraif, saying that she’ll miss the “classy” ambience that The Elbow Room brought to Pittsburgh.
The closing of The Elbow Room accompanies several other restaurant closings and openings in the vicinity of Carnegie Mellon. Along the Craig Street corridor, — along with the Chipotle scheduled to open on Jan. 1 at 4611 Forbes Ave. — Sushi Fuku is set to open at 417 S. Craig St., the former location of Dozen Bake Shop. The Craig Street location will complement Sushi Fuku’s other Oakland location at 120 Oakland Ave.
Oakland’s Joe Mama’s Italian Deluxe at 3716 Forbes Ave. closed on Oct. 27 and reopened Nov. 4 as Olio Trattoria, another casual Italian restaurant. The previous owners of Joe Mama’s, Mike Hanley and Jerry DiLembo, also own Burgatory and Uncle Sam’s. The restaurant was bought by Brandon Smith, Greg Ripper, and Daniel Sutton, alumni of the University of Pittsburgh who also bought Fuel & Fuddle from DiLembo and Hanley over the summer.

On Wednesday, members of Carnegie Mellon’s Tartans 4 Israel club hosted a pop-up kitchen in the Jared L. Cohon University Center’s Wean Commons to give their own take on Conflict Kitchen’s Palestinian-themed food.
Serving kosher and halal falafel, hummus, pita, and other traditional foods from the Middle East and the contested regions, Tartans 4 Israel also had trivia relating to Israel and Palestine and distributed materials on coexistence in the Middle East, including “I [love] coexistence” stickers. There was also a board filled with sticky notes from students and faculty describing what peace meant to them.
The club hosted their CoExistence Kitchen not in an attempt to “put down any of the dialogue begun at Conflict Kitchen, but rather, an opportunity to bring the dialogue onto our campus, and be thoughtful about how we can engage in such complicated issues,” according to the event’s Facebook page.
The CoExistence Kitchen was sponsored by Hillel and a grant from the Israel Campus Coalition, with whom Tartans 4 Israel worked to put together the literature that they distributed, according to senior chemistry major and past Tartans 4 Israel President Danielle Schlesinger, who helped envision and plan the event. “The literature was filled with information about the Middle East, testimonies from different people who live in Israel regarding the peace process, and efforts for a two-state solution,” Schlesinger said.
Current Tartans 4 Israel president and sophomore chemical engineering and creative writing double major Naomi Sternstein said that she was extremely pleased with the events. “People were curious, asking questions, really seeking out new information, which made me really happy,” Sternstein said.
The analogous club at the University of Pittsburgh, Panthers 4 Israel, also hosted a CoExistence Kitchen the following day. The two joint events reached an estimated 400 students across both campuses. “We had really positive reactions,” Schlesinger said. “Everyone who came was willing to participate and thought that the conversation was interesting and important. We had a wide range of students as well.”
Sternstein was excited that people signed up to receive more information about hosting similar events and contribute to the education about these issues. “I was so happy that people were so engaged and wanting to know more,” she said.
Schlesinger said that the organization worked to make sure that all ethnic and religious groups — including Israelis, Arab-Israelis, Palestinians, Palestinian-Israelis, Christians, Druse, and Ethiopians — were included and respected. 
“We wanted to be able to work with other on-campus organizations to co-sponsor the event, but unfortunately the timeline was too short to allow for that,” Schlesinger said. “However, the Students for Justice in Palestine (SJP) club at UPitt was able to contribute some language changes, which we were happy to incorporate.”
Hadeel Salameh, senior creative writing major at the University of Pittsburgh, is the president of Students for Justice in Palestine. 
In an email, Salameh said that “SJP and I didn’t appreciate how Palestinians were constantly referred to as “Arabs” in the pamphlets and on the Facebook event page. Also, we had a problem with the Facebook page saying “Israeli and Middle Eastern food” as if Middle Eastern food is Palestinian food; it’s not, Palestinians have their own unique heritage and ethnicity although they are Arabs they are Palestinian Arabs.”
Salameh said, “SJP felt that CoExistence Kitchen failed to recognize Palestinians by failing to recognize that they are individuals separate from Middle Eastern and Arab terminology. 
However, we told them that (both before and during the event) and during the event. When SJP representatives stood with signs saying so, the coexistence organizers approached us and heard our concerns and changed the terminology.”
According to Tartans 4 Israel leaders, the main point of the event was to keep up the dialogue that was started at Conflict Kitchen’s Palestinian-themed programming. Their goal, said Schlesinger, was to “expand that conversation onto our campuses, but concentrate more in the vein of coexistence. We wanted to look and talk more about what’s actually being done to support peace in the region. A lot of people on campus are not educated about what’s going on there unless they are directly involved. When Conflict Kitchen gives out information that is in-depth and intense, if you get it without context and background, it can be very overwhelming. We wanted to provide that context.”
“We wanted to show people that there are ways to expand the dialogue and learn new things while embracing all of the differences that exist there and spark conversations,” added Sternstein.
The Tartan also reached out to the co-director of Conflict Kitchen, Dawn Weleski (CFA '10) for comment. Weleski said that she and her co-director Carnegie Mellon art professor Jon Rubin were not contacted by the organizers of the CoExistence Kitchen. 
They did not attend either of the events Weleski declined to comment on the grounds that they had no experiences upon which to comment.

SARVP update
Sophomore economics major Vaasavi Unnava and junior decision science major Julia Eddy gave an update on the Sexual Assault and Relationship Violence Prevention (SARVP) committee. SARVP is working with the Pittsburgh Student Government Council (PSGC) on campus sexual assault policies. The SARVP hosted discussions last week and this week on the university’s policy.
Chair update: alumni giving
Junior information systems major Evan Wineland and junior decision science major Julia Eddy, chair and vice-chair of Student Senate, respectively, updated the body on their ongoing initiatives. They discussed Carnegie Mellon’s push for students and alumni donating money back to the university, something that university President Subra Suresh emphasized when he spoke to Senate earlier in the semester.
Student giving, Wineland and Eddy said, reflects pride in Carnegie Mellon and adds value to a Carnegie Mellon degree, along with a host of other benefits.
A committee has been formed to make student giving a part of the university’s culture.
Special Allocation: CMU Chabad dinner
CMU Chabad requested money from Senate for a joint Chabad dinner, shared with the University of Pittsburgh and the surrounding community. 90 Carnegie Mellon students attended the event, the majority of which were undergraduates. Senate voted to allocate $1,260 to the organization.
Ex officio report: Gina Casalegno and Anita Barkin
Dean of Student Affairs Gina Casalegno and director of University Health Services Anita Barkin spoke to Senate about the university’s on-campus smoking policy, which is under review by a diverse committee.
There is a clear trend, Casalegno and Barkin said, for a smoke- and tobacco-free campus. According to last year’s HealthyU survey, 85 percent of undergraduate students reported no nicotine consumption in the past 30 days, and the committee reached a consensus that Carnegie Mellon should become a smoke- and tobacco-free campus. Students can give feedback on the proposed smoking policy online.

Last week, The Tartan carried an exceptionally long opinion piece by staffwriter Kyle Henson. The length mainly has to do with the fact that Henson spends the majority of the piece accurately and usefully describing some of the basic aspects of the Affordable Care Act, and the implications of the upcoming King v. Burwell case.
I recommend reading the article, as it explains — in detail I do not have the space to get into here — how the states that failed to create their own healthcare exchanges and instead used the federal ones will lose access to the federal subsidies. But suffice it to say that if the Supreme Court decides to interpret the law in the strictest literal way possible, Obamacare — as the ACA is referred to, thanks to the concerted effort of the Republican Party and right wing pundits — will crash and burn spectacularly.
Henson saw this as a cause for some celebration, since defeating the ACA, regardless of the tangible benefits it has for many American citizens, is a major GOP policy goal. The motivation for fighting it is ostensibly rooted in a philosophy of minimizing government regulation and spending.
Personally, I’m convinced that partisanship without regard for the welfare of living, breathing Americans was an at least equal motivator, and when last week’s article caught its breath after delivering pertinent facts, it started showcasing the mindset that has led to the least effective Congress in all of American history.
One of the reasons that Henson argues that the ACA should be struck down, over what is regarded by many commentators and lawmakers as a typo, is a contradictory set of feelings about intent. The letter of the law, Henson argues, along with the precedent it sets, is what matters most. The intent of the lawmakers should not matter, he asserts. Afterward, he puts in a quote from Jonathan Gruber, a contributor to the bill, discussing the clause the case hinges on and how it will lead to the predicted “Health Insurance Death Spiral” in states that failed to set up their own exchanges.
It doesn’t matter if the “Death Spiral” is part of a grand political scheme on the part of its writers or some sort of political dead man’s switch to protect the ACA as a whole. By Henson’s argument that is immaterial, since policy should not be based on the intent of the writers. Authorizing a ruling against the federal exchanges could actually hurt the GOP in the long run, since the subsidies will remain in place for states that did manage to create their own exchanges, as  James Surowiecki points out for The New Yorker.
Later on, Henson also grandly declares that Justice Roberts will likely side with the conservative members of the Supreme court, since he tends to favor rulings that “reflect the intent of the Framers of the Constitution to have a government of laws, not a government of people.” Why the widely-interpreted intent of men with wooden dentures who used shots of whiskey for anesthesia should matter more than the stated intentions of modern lawmakers (apart from Gruber, whose malicious intent is worth caring about) should matter on issues of modern healthcare is unclear.
This is an especially mystifying statement since the first Republican president declared the Founding Fathers intended us to have “a government of the people, by the people, and for the people.”
The government, being for the people, should probably not actively harm the people. It’s unclear what negative precedent upholding the use of the Federal Exchanges would set. While there is some cause for fear that a more liberal interpretation of any law could be dangerous, adhering to the spirit and not the letter is often the right choice, regardless of the way the political fallout might blow. This is especially true when upholding the letter will lead to direct and present economic, social, and physical harm for residents of 34 states.
Instead of rooting for the potentially fatal ramifications of this court decision, we should be calling for the Supreme Court to make the choice that won’t actively hurt many Americans in nearly every sphere of life.
Henson closes his argument by telling those hoping to become doctors to reconsider their career path in light of the complexities the revocation of federal marketplaces might bring — a poignant reminder of Right Wing attitudes toward healthcare.
The implication is that you should avoid a career in medicine because it might be complex and confusing, and it may not be as lucrative as it once was. Why would anybody want to enter a field where they can save lives and improve other people’s health and wellbeing as a result of studying subjects they likely find fascinating if there’s a lot of annoying paperwork and not immense money involved?

Coming to the end of college is bizarre. Even though I’m not leaving Pittsburgh or moving out of my house, the idea of having a future without schoolwork for the first time in my life is alien. Equally bizarre, however, is no longer writing for The Tartan as a student. The Tartan was the first club that I joined my first semester, and I’ve dutifully contributed 58 different articles to this newspaper since then, creating a library of work mostly about politics, asserting my right-leaning libertarian take on current events, but also flirting with religion, ethics, art, and music.
Reflecting on my work, it seemed fitting that my last article for The Tartan as a student would be some grand summary of all that I’ve learned in my years at Carnegie Mellon, leaving The Tartan with a Last Lecture-esque piece imparting three- and-a-half years of wisdom on the paper’s readership. Sitting down to write that article, however, proved more difficult than expected.
My experience at Carnegie Mellon has been, I feel, a relatively unique one. I’m one of the only business majors involved with either The Tartan or WRCT, and both of those clubs, especially the latter, have been the crux of my social life. I’m graduating early so that I can dedicate myself to a startup I co-founded with a group of other Carnegie Mellon students in April. I studied abroad in Dublin, and I’m self-described as being passionate about two things — music and capitalism. When I find other lovers of capitalism, they could usually care less about my passion for music. Most other lovers of music look at me like I have a second head when I tell them about my Smithian paramour.
In short, most of what I’ve learned at Carnegie Mellon would fall on deaf ears if I tried to articulate it, because my experiences have led me to a very specific way of seeing the world that’s likely not relatable to many others on campus, as would the experiences of many other graduating Carnegie Mellon students likely be foreign to me. The nature of the university (being really good at educating people in a few areas and creating a college for each area) makes the choose-your-adventure type experience of every Carnegie Mellon student incredibly different, leading each graduating class to be, in my view, far more diverse than that of many other universities.
Yet through this diversity of experience and study at Carnegie Mellon, I’m finding every day that the people who are happiest here are the ones who came into school with a vision for how they wanted to impact the world, and are honing the skills they acquire here to achieve that vision.
One of my friends, who’s a passionate DJ, is using his engineering background to design speakers that use constructive and destructive interference to create 3–D soundscapes. The research he worked on allowed him to hold a speaker right in front of my face but create sounds that seemed to be coming from 90 degrees to my right. Another friend has been working to turn her writing degree into a career in fashion by cold-calling as many potential employers in the industry as possible.
I’ve been fortunate enough to take an entrepreneurship major with a music technology minor and co-found a music technology startup, but if that opportunity hadn’t presented itself, I’d likely be working at Burger King’s Corporate HQ, where I spent my summer. As much as I loved that job, I didn’t wake up every morning feeling inspired, which is undoubtedly worth any salary cut.
At the end of my Carnegie Mellon career, I’ve gained appreciation for how well of a job the university does at shaping minds and teaching skills. While Carnegie Mellon could definitely improve in many ways, everyone who goes here will have gained an absurd level of mastery in their field, whatever it happens to be. However, while it’s easy to get funneled into typical career paths for your major, the people doing the coolest things here are usually the happiest and are usually taking the skills they’re learning here and pursuing the passions that they brought with them to Carnegie Mellon.
That can take many forms. While I would want to advise everyone to start a company because it’s been an amazing experience for me, startup life is definitely not for everyone. Passions are easily pursued by the usual major career paths for your major, or in existing industries that are outside of the usual destinations for your major. Whatever the destination is after Carnegie Mellon, the feeling of inspiration that comes with following your passion is something I wouldn’t trade for the world. In true cliché-last-article form, Carnegie Mellon has taught me that work is a gift, and no matter what work you do, your heart should be in it.

Remember the days when we were awarded a gold star for every act of good behavior? We’d feel an overwhelming sense of pride as we watched the number of gold stars accumulate. This method of awarding students for their good behavior continues, but as a part of today’s app culture.
The gold star method is being replaced by behavioral tracking apps such as ClassDojo. According to The New York Times, at least one teacher in one-in-three schools in the United States uses their app.
Each student gets a monster avatar, and the students hear a specific sound on the app when a good behavior point is awarded or taken away. ClassDojo is the kind of app elementary school students enjoy because of its video game-like structure. Many educators are also happy with the app, claiming that it’s a fun and easy way to track the classroom behavior of each student and that it results in well-behaved students.
So, why are apps such as ClassDojo controversial? Both parents and educators have expressed concern about the privacy of the data that is collected using ClassDojo. A third-party database like ClassDojo’s, one that regularly collects information on student behavior, could use the details and place the label of “problem child” on individual students. If ClassDojo distributed this data, the “problem child” label could follow students later in life.
In response to this concern, the makers of ClassDojo intend to keep students’ behavioral records for only one year starting in January 2015. According to The New York Times, co-founder of ClassDojo Sam Chaudhary said, “We are not a data company. So we have no need to keep any data beyond allowing it to be communicated between teachers, parents and students.” 
While the issue of data privacy has been addressed, the effectiveness of extrinsic rewards still merits discussion. Some parents disapprove of the point-based behavior feedback approach, comparing it to public shaming.
The purpose of ClassDojo is to create a virtual classroom where it’s easier for the teacher to keep track of behavioral points and easier for students to be aware of their performance in the classroom. However, one parent opposed to the idea of ClassDojo in the classroom wrote, “It is all a big cartoony bribe system.”
This debate over bribery in the classroom isn’t new. Before app culture reached the classrooms, educators used the “gold star” method that is familiar to many of us, since younger students have been known to respond better to points, treats, and prizes than a single letter grade.
However, letter grades aren’t significantly different from material incentives. Students at Carnegie Mellon strive for a high QPA because employers ask for it. It may not be the single most important factor that gets you your dream job, but it’s important enough for students to maintain a decent QPA. Our professors are aware of our obsessions with grades, and as a result they display the graphical representation of the last exam so that we all know where we stand in comparison to the class. Our educators use this method to motivate us to work hard. This method is a kind of bribery, but it works.
When it comes to the debate over bribing students, some parents argue that there should be a more meaningful way of giving feedback to children. The truth is, whatever “meaningful feedback” looks like, a point-based behavior feedback approach can’t be replaced.
ClassDojo does not intend to publicly shame third graders. Young students respond better to bribery. They change and, more importantly, improve their behavior based on this approach used by a majority of educators in the country. Not all educators publicly display ClassDojo. Instead, they award and take away points privately, but the students always know where they stand.
The point system upsets parents and educators because they worry about students who may be labeled as “problem” children. More importantly, the system awards those who do well in the classroom. You can’t give a simple letter grade and expect children in elementary schools to respond to it and behave in the classroom. ClassDojo creates a virtual classroom that children respond to, making it an effective method of feedback for teachers, parents, and students.

Missouri governor Jay Nixon declared a state of emergency last week in preparation for the conclusion of a St. Louis county grand jury’s investigation into police officer Darren Wilson’s fatal shooting of Ferguson teenager Michael Brown. A state of emergency allows the governor to call the National Guard to keep the peace in the case of riots.
While The Tartan understands that Governor Nixon and his administration could be profoundly concerned about potential responses to the grand jury’s verdict, militarizing the situation will only serve to escalate this conflict.
Wilson may or may not be charged with a criminal offense. If he is, he will face the court and potential conviction, thus setting a precedent that police shootings of unarmed citizens are unjustifiable. If he isn’t, there will be riots across Missouri and perhaps further. After Wilson shot Michael Brown in August 2014, the protests escalated into riots and led to the burning of a gas station and the looting of several businesses. As a cause for further concern, gun sellers claim that sales of firearms have increased dramatically in the past few weeks, according to The Washington Post. However, neither of these occurrences justify the involvement of the National Guard.
Calling in the National Guard sends the message that the Missouri government has no expectation of peaceful protests. It says that the government expects the worst of its citizens. Additionally, it suggests that the Missouri government has anticipated the outcome of Wilson’s investigation and knows that citizens will not like it.
The government and police’s long-standing habit of responding to situations with disproportionate and overwhelming force is a large part of what created this turmoil in the first place. The Missouri government should show more faith in its citizens and consideration of the sensitivity of this issue. Doing so would demonstrate a more nuanced understanding of the situation on their hands.

In May, President Subra Suresh announced that the university aimed to launch endowed “Presidential Fellowships” and “Presidential Scholarships” for graduate and undergraduate students respectively, stating that the university had previously only provided about 8 percent of the total financial aid students received.
Now, just six months later, President Suresh announced through email to the campus community on Nov. 18 that the university has established a permanent endowment of about $80 million for these fellowships and scholarships by fundraising from alumni and nonprofit foundations. President Suresh also announced that the funds will be available for students across all colleges and schools.
It is promising to see a highly public focus on student scholarships and fellowships under President Suresh’s leadership. This newly raised endowment has the potential to support students who would not otherwise be able to afford an education at Carnegie Mellon.
The total cost of attending Carnegie Mellon for the 2018 graduating class is $63,822, making it one of the most expensive universities in the United States. With rising tuition costs and a focus by President Barack Obama on making education affordable, it is more important than ever that the university has established funds for assisting prospective students. By providing students with assistance through resources like the funds generated for this new endowment, Carnegie Mellon can continue to remain a competitive institution when vying for potential students’ enrollment.
In his most recent email to the campus community regarding the endowment, President Suresh stated, “significantly growing our endowment for student support will remain a key priority for me and for the university for years to come.” A continued focus on affordability for students must remain a priority for the university. After all, students drive the university’s operations and its mission to “disseminate knowledge and art through research and creative inquiry, teaching, and learning.”
While this new endowment has the potential to make Carnegie Mellon affordable for a select number of students, the endowment will not cover more than a slice of the student population. 
With a continued focus on providing for its students, it will be possible for the university to cover a large number of students with funds that it raises itself based upon its promising efforts in the first six months of this new endowment project’s initial announcement.

The debate over net neutrality in the United States has come back into the public spotlight, with President Obama and prominent Republican figures, including Texas Senator Ted Cruz, declaring opposing views on the issue. In all the fiery rhetoric surrounding this issue, there is danger of the dialogue about what is ultimately an issue of free speech being lost in hyperbole and political jockeying.
The debate over net neutrality comes down to the issue of whether major Internet providers will have the ability to restrict connection speeds or access to certain websites. Were this to be allowed, an internet service provider (ISP) would have the ability to restrict access to sites it did not want to provide access to, slow down speeds to other websites (such as those owned by or partnered with a competitor), and introduce tiered pricing models for internet speeds and access.
Allowing this to become a reality would allow for an ISP to partner with a company such as Hulu and then slow down speeds for their customers accessing a competitor such as Netflix, offer Internet packages where consumers would have to pay additional fees to get better speed for video streaming or gaming websites. Most alarmingly, ISPs could block websites they do not agree with, which could range from negative press to websites concerning political issues. Speech and content should be free and equal on the Internet, and net neutrality is a proposal which would ensure that this remains true.
Net neutrality became a massive national issue recently after a federal appeals court struck down the Federal Communications Commission’s regulations intended to maintain net neutrality. The issue was quickly politicized, with Democrats, including President Obama, supporting net neutrality regulation, and Republicans viewing it as unnecessary market intervention.
Most notably, Senator Ted Cruz declared net neutrality to be “Obamacare for the internet,” displaying a fundamental misunderstanding of the concept, and turning the issue into an even greater political lightning rod. While the health insurance market is currently divided into plans with different levels of coverage, net neutrality would ensure that the Internet remains open and unstratified.
An open and free Internet is critical to maintaining free speech in the 21st century, guaranteeing free access to information, and ensuring that access to free speech cannot be stratified by income group. 
Net neutrality is a critical aspect of protecting free speech, and the public understanding of this issue must not be clouded by political misrepresentations of the topic.

Last Friday, Aereo, a service that promised to offer the free over-the-air television service that providers, media companies, and the government failed to provide, signed its death certificate with a Chapter 11 bankruptcy. While the company had a valid argument for its legality, it had no chance against mainstream media corporations. Like many innovative companies that have attempted to disrupt entire industries and move the world forward, Aereo was forced into bankruptcy by a long fight in court with defunct regulations and a broken system.
In actuality, Aereo did not violate copyright laws. It was simply a service that rented out tiny, controllable Internet-connected antennas to users in a visually appealing interface. Each user rented their own antenna and picked up service like they would normally legally be allowed via their own personal antenna. It was essentially a remote TiVo.
However, while young tech-savvy people rejoiced that they would be able to watch news channels or their favorite shows online, television providers and networks saw just how big of a threat the service was to their traditional model. They knew that if it became successful, it could disrupt their traditional business model, in which they rip off consumers by charging them sometimes upward of $100 a month, all while wasting minutes of their lives every hour with advertisements.
According to The New York Times, one in three millennials watches mostly online video and no broadcast television. Young people like on-demand content and are sick of the archaic model of television technologies. Views of television networks drop in the U.S. because young people no longer see the utility in paying $100 a month for something they can get for free online in a more on-demand fashion. Additionally, the free over-the-air service provided by the United States government is completely laughable.
Why is free television still over-the-air and not online in 2014? Aereo sought to add something that should have existed half a decade ago. The only reason it does not exist is because large service providers wish to keep their monopoly on any kind of service that is not terrible (as the current United States over-the-air network is).
The story of Aereo and the Supreme Court’s ruling of its illegality earlier this year is one that repeats itself in many instances. Why are there not Tesla stores in every state? Why are Uber and Lyft illegal in half of the country? There are no good reasons to any of these questions besides greed. Lobbyists of multibillion dollar corporations are the reason why many of the industries in the United States are in great need of innovation.
With every article I read about another company that has been killed by lobbying and government regulations, I begin to wonder — is the United States still the same nation that embraces innovation and creativity over all else? Government regulations are not meant to protect archaic company models from the disruption of innovation; they are meant to create the most fair and free competitive market possible. Clearly, in the case of Aereo, the court was neither fair nor in favor of the free market. R.I.P. Aereo, and R.I.P. free capitalism.
