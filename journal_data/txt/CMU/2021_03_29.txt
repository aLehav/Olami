Clarissa Liang, a second-year student majoring in business administration, is running to be the Student Body Vice President for Finance (SBVPF). Liang currently serves as the vice-chair of the Joint Funding Committee (JFC), where she works under the current SBVPF to fund student organizations. According to Liang, her work in the JFC has not only given her a unique perspective but also more experience. Liang's platform centers around increasing coordination with the Student Senate and the Graduate Student Assembly, increasing JFC turnout and participation, maintaining impartiality, and increasing efficiency. 
In an interview with The Tartan, Liang said one of her first priorities as SPVPF would be to reduce the confusion for new members who join the committee because she has experienced how overwhelming joining the JFC can be. 
“I was expected to figure everything out myself as a new member. I felt so lost, so that's definitely something that I want to work on,” Liang said. She added that she wants to “get everyone up to par and to standardize what we do to not have to focus on the administrative things.” 
But while she wants to make smaller changes to increase efficiency, she will maintain the same format of having 5 subdivisions of the JFC that all deal with different Carnegie Mellon University organizations. 
“The smaller committees offer more flexibility because it is easier to coordinate less people, so that has an added benefit and is more efficient,” Liang said.  
However, one change she proposes is to add more graduate students to the JFC to further increase diversity in ideas. 
“I may add a couple more students within the JFC members to have more graduate participation and voice because they are still part of CMU,” said Liang. She added that she will continue to prioritize diversity and inclusion in the JFC’s budget cut decisions. 
Liang said, “When we look at budgets, we have a metric that we strictly follow. Something that we have started to do is to include impact and diversity and inclusion. When we look at budgets and do final cuts, we are deciding whether to give an organization more money — something we consider is, is this organization making moves to be more diverse? Are they making moves to be more inclusive? And are they making a large impact within campus to involve more people?” 
Liang also hopes to focus on having clearer communication and transparency so the JFC and student organizations can be on the same page. 
“What the JFC does, I think is really phenomenal,” Liang said. She added, “Every organization has to have their fair share. I truly want organizations to be the best that they can, and the JFC will support that.”

Joong Ho (Joshua) Choi, a second-year student studying statistics and data science, is running for Student Body Vice President for Organizations (SBVPO). The role of the SBVPO is to oversee and advise student organizations on campus. The SBVPO also serves as the chair on the Committee on Student Organizations (CoSO), which oversees the process that formally recognizes student organizations on campus. 
As SBVPO, Choi hopes to be more directly involved in helping students pursue their interests through organizations. He believes that “People shine the most when they are pursuing their passions,” and, as SBVPO, he wants to be directly involved in “assisting them [to] shine.” 
His first priority for the upcoming year is to “prioritize CMU organizations’ ability to hold events in-person under new safety regulations.” He explained that his main goal as SBVPO is to create and maintain a safe environment on campus, where students “can make new friends and laugh together while pursuing their interests.”
Choi has served two years on CoSO. During his first year, he worked as the Director of Recognition for Student Organizations, and during his second year, he worked as the Director of Re-recognition for Student Organizations. Choi said that his experience has allowed him to understand the tasks of the SBVPO “more than anyone,” and that he knows what works well and what doesn’t. 
As Carnegie Mellon students get closer to returning to campus, Choi hopes to play a critical role in helping students connect with each other through their interests and organizations. He anticipates working with faculty to help students “regain their past lifestyles” as well as “expand their social networks in-person.” He stresses that this process will be “gradual and slow-paced” and believes students will understand this fact. 
For his commitment to creating an inclusive and diverse environment for students of all backgrounds, Choi wants to continue the high standard of evaluating the constitutions of new and existing organizations to meet this goal. This would be done during the recognition process for new organizations and the re-recognition process for existing organizations. 
He left voters with a simple final message: “Carpe diem!”

Alexis Ozimok and Catherine Taipe are running to be Carnegie Mellon's Student Body President and Student Body Vice President, respectively. Their platform is focused on improving student wages and work culture; Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) initiatives; Greek housing costs; and expanding DineXtra locations.
Out of the many facets of their platform, Ozimok says that her greatest goal is to raise Carnegie Mellon's minimum wage for student employees.
"We're still right in the middle of a pandemic, and so many people have really struggled with finances," Ozimok said. "I know there's a self-reported number, that 19 percent of CMU students have reported themselves as food insecure. And so many of them are working multiple campus jobs just to make sure that they can make rent or make their grocery bill."
Ozimok and Taipe's platform advocates for gradually raising the minimum wage to 15 dollars. "I think we already see the broad support for this initiative, so it's something we'd like to get done right away," Ozimok said, mentioning that there was a Senate white paper also discussing Carnegie Mellon minimum wage and work culture, with 47 signatories as of the publication of this article. The white paper recommends gradually raising the minimum wage to 11 dollars.
Taipe's biggest priority is supporting DEI initiatives. She has worked on DEI before, having written for Dietrich College's DEI newsletter, The Garden, and Dietrich's DEI Strategic Plan. Taipe said students working with DEI often put a large amount of time and emotional labor into DEI initiatives, and she hopes to ensure these students are compensated fairly.
"Students of color, students from marginalized communities are spending a lot of time on these committees around tables, and it's really exhausting," Taipe said. "It really does get to you. So we really wanted to prioritize kind of working with the Undergraduate Senate and maybe [the Graduate Student Assembly] and even the new [Vice Provost for Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion], Wanda Heading-Grant, on this kind of allocation of funding for students who haven't been paid for this work."
Ozimok and Taipe are working on several other policies focused on DEI. They have talked with organizations such as ABLE, a club that supports students with chronic illnesses and disabilities, and found that "Neurodivergent or differently-abled students weren't consulted on the [Disabilities Resources] Testing Center. And sometimes just extra time on an exam isn't what everyone needs," Ozimok said.
Ozimok said that she would like to "redefine how we look at diversity, and to make the definition feel more welcoming to all the communities on our group on our campus, and making sure that we don't recognize students as a monolith." She also mentioned potentially organizing invisible backpack training, an idea that "Everyone has this invisible backpack and we're all carrying different things that might weigh us down."
Ozimok says that Carnegie Mellon is sometimes seen as uninvolved in social issues and advocacy. But she has seen this change in the student body.
"I've seen this really amazing shift in the student voice of one from apathy to one that's really not only concerned with just their four-year experience in their immediate lives, but the world around them," Ozimok said. She continued, "I think that change has been something really inspiring to see. And the reason that I really wanted to be Student Body President is because we need someone to carry that momentum forward. And someone who is passionate about making these student ideas and seeing this culture shift happen."
Ozimok and Taipe believe that they can accomplish their goals during their term if elected. They hope to lay the foundation for additional long-term goals that later presidents and vice presidents can build upon.
Ozimok said, "We do realize we have high goals, but it's because we have high expectations for the CMU community. We've seen what our community is capable of when we come together. And I think a lot of our goals have strong community support. So I definitely see them as feasible."
As the COVID-19 situation improves and vaccinations continue, there is hope that students will be able to return to campus in the fall. As there will be a large number of students who have never seen campus before, Ozimok and Taipe believe that we must create a new culture of celebrating community in times of joy.
"Something that especially came to my mind after the events of last week in Atlanta, I think I want to work on placements of actual community and solidarity that aren't in response to a tragic event," Taipe said. She would like to work with DEI more to emphasize a "sense of community and togetherness that is joyful, and not just after something very upsetting or tragic happens."
Ozimok echoed that sentiment as well, adding that "We need to unite our community around joy and success and the things that make us proud to be Carnegie Mellon students, not only uniting in sadness and frustration and anger. Because if we only come together at those times, it's going to become much harder to seek each other out during the good times. And I think building a strong community means being there, through both the good times and bad."

Sun A Cho, a second-year studying electrical and computer engineering and engineering and public policy, is running for Student Body Vice President for Finance (SBVPF). The role of the SBVPF is to manage the financial affairs on campus and oversee the Joint Funding Committee (JFC), which allocates funds to student organizations on campus. 
In an interview with The Tartan, Cho said that, if elected, she hopes to balance increasing the efficiency of the JFC with creating a diverse and environmentally sustainable campus for students in the upcoming year. She has served on both the Student Senate and JFC, and she cites these experiences as helping her understand the finances “inside and out.” Cho said she is excited to be able to work with student organizations to deliver the “best possible experience to the student body in the next academic year.” 
Cho’s primary goals are to make the process for reviewing funding applications for organizations generally more efficient and to foster collaboration between different funding resources that help student organizations. She said she wants to unite the funding resources available to student organizations on campus to make the funding process more efficient. She also hopes to host information sessions for student organizations and create a compiled guide for organizations to help them understand the application process and the different sources of funding available. 
Beyond her primary goal of readjusting the infrastructure of the JFC, Cho wants to focus on improving environmental sustainability and diversity on campus. According to Cho, this includes working with student leaders and encouraging them to host events to raise awareness on the importance of these issues. However, she acknowledges that these goals can only be started by first making the JFC more efficient. 
As students get closer to returning to campus, Cho has proposed implementing a special exception for organizations in the coming school year to allow for rollover and reallocation of their funds from the past year. She said that many organizations were less active this year. If she is elected, she hopes to work with student leaders to find ways for organizations to “recuperate from the loss of membership and their general presence on campus in the fall.” 
As a first-generation immigrant, Cho said she understands the importance of diversity and inclusion on campus. Cho hopes to continue the new JFC policy of prioritizing organizations whose missions and goals are closely related to fostering a diverse environment on campus. She further hopes to have meetings with the JFC in the fall to discuss more ways for the JFC to help foster diversity and inclusion on campus. 
Her final message to the voters is that the reason her campaign platform seems “limited” is because she does not want to promise changes to the student body that are “ideal but not realistic.” She believes that her platform is realistic and that her goals will be achieved by the end of her term as SBVPF. 
Still, Cho cautioned, “This does not mean that there is no room for new initiatives and projects. I will be an accessible SBVPF. I hope to attend as many Student Senate [General Body Meetings] as possible and connect with student leaders to understand their financial needs in order to make the Tartan community better.”

Imran Hyder, a junior majoring in economics, and Sarah Abrams, a first-year studying technical writing and communication, are running together for Student Body President and Vice President. 
Hyder is currently the Student Body Vice President of Organizations (SBVPO), an elected role that involves approving and overseeing all student organizations on campus, and is also the president of the Sigma Chi fraternity. Sitting on committees like the University Student Advisory Council and Student Leadership Council, and also chairing the University Center Allocation Board (UCAB) and the Committee on Student Organizations (CoSO), Hyder has noticed over time that there were “more and more things” that “needed to be changed” within the student government. 
Based on his experience with CoSO, Hyder has found that, “Student organizations are really the conduit between student government and individuals on campus.” Hyder continued, “I think using organizations as a way to kind of gauge the student population is definitely a good way to move forward,” explaining that he hopes to work as President to facilitate increased communication between student leadership and the administration. 
As a first-year student, Abrams has experienced the university differently than those who began their studies pre-pandemic. “I've seen, firsthand, an entire grade of people who are having social troubles,” Abrams said, emphasizing that she would like to push for a “redo” of orientation when the university transitions back to in-person learning. Abrams is currently the co-director of new recognition for the CoSO, giving her experience in overseeing campus organizations. She’s also a PillBox Editor for The Tartan, is a member of the Kappa Alpha Theta sorority, and works social media for CMU Hillel. Abrams writes on the campaign site, “By combining my first-year perspective with Imran’s upperclassman experience, our ticket offers a unique blend between pre-pandemic tradition and post-pandemic prosperity.”
The pair’s platform lists “Transparency & Engagement,” “Student Life & Wellness,” “Diversity, Equity, & Inclusion,” and “Dining and Greek Life” as central issues. Hyder says that, if elected, his first priorities include “transparency and efficiency in student government, and making sure that the administration is more considerate of concerns that students have.” Mentioning issues that students have had with the employment of Richard Grenell, as well as recent Greek housing disputes, Hyder explained that there exists a disconnect between the administration and students and that he could facilitate better communication on these issues. “Acting as a voice of the campus would be my highest priority,” he said.
Abrams listed several policy positions as priorities: giving “student voices” a seat at the table on the Board of Trustees and on the Treasury Committee, DineXtra expansion, cross-campus standardization of remote testing protocols, and the creation of a Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) Committee to serve as a direct link between the administration and students’ concerns. 
The Undergraduate Student Senate DEI Committee that they are proposing would gather feedback from the campus community to produce actionable items for the university to consider. Abrams says that this DEI committee, and communications that include action items, would be a “way better alternative” to the “empty emails” and “planned talks” that she says follow campus controversies. Hyder said that he hopes to increase collaboration between student organizations and the administration in the planning of campus discussions. They also want to create an Undergraduate Student Senate Committee on Student Life & Wellness, in collaboration with Counseling and Psychological Services (CaPS), to address concerns over student mental health.
Hyder says that they want to see things like the University Student Advisory Council, which currently seats administrators, professors, students, and alumni, “blown up to a much larger scale” by seating student organization leadership and increasing overall communication between administration and students. 
Regarding student government transparency and engagement, Hyder and Abrams propose a new social media presence dedicated to hearing student feedback, and the use of weekly emails containing all student organization meetings.
“So many people are dissatisfied with the university,” Hyder said. “As long as me and Sarah are there,” Hyder continued, “we will constantly be there saying ‘this is what people want' [to the administration], and I think that's our largest obligation and our largest promise as a team.”
In a final message to voters, Abrams emphasized the importance of listening to the campus community. “Whatever it is,” she said, “we want to listen. We want to know about your CMU experience and what we can do to make it better.”
“If you feel like you're being treated unfairly on campus, or you feel like someone else is being treated unfairly on campus, if there's an injustice on campus, or something could be done better, you have a right to have your voice heard. And you have a right to have that problem fixed,” Abrams concluded.

Editor's Note: Sarah Abrams is a PillBox Editor for The Tartan. Hyder and Abrams were interviewed by Adam Tunnard, a contributing editor and former news editor for The Tartan who has not written in the PillBox section under Abrams.

Ariana Carden, a first-year majoring in chemical and biomedical engineering, has spent the entirety of her college education so far learning remotely from her home in New Jersey; and now, although she has never been to campus, Carden has decided to run for Student Body President. 
"As a freshman who has been studying remotely for the entire year, I have a very unique viewpoint onto CMU and what student government needs to accomplish. I’ve heard from a lot of my peers who say they feel isolated, not only from upperclassmen but from their peers who are studying in-person,” Carden said. It’s not just first-years who are dealing with isolation either. First-year graduate students, international students, transfer students, and others without an established community on campus pre-COVID have dealt with isolation and loneliness. Carden mentioned she would like to include those students in her cabinet. 
Carden has proposed a mentorship plan as one solution to the issue of isolation. “One issue that CMU faces currently is that there are so many undergraduate students who don’t know a single graduate student and vice versa,” Carden said. “There are so many unique insights a graduate student could give to undergraduate students.” The plan is to match graduates and undergraduates in the same department, which is already practiced in the Department of Chemical Engineering. She argued that expanding this to the whole university could tackle the disconnection of the student body that has only become more intense in the last year. 
Carden also hopes to use her position to boost mental health resources on campus. Central tenets to Carden’s campaign include making the variety of resources from CaPS more widely known, using Discord and Slack to connect people across and within colleges, and reinforcing those online connections when students return. “In order to facilitate those connections… it’s important to start now, and then move forward as we go in person and implement the same ways of connecting,” Carden said.
Carden’s focus on the diversity of student positions extends to those students with different sexual, gender, racial, and ethnic identities as well. “One of the most important things for anyone in a leadership position is to be a good role model for others and show the behaviors that others should show,” Carden said, so the easiest thing to do is to be a good anti-racist role model for other students, professors, and administrators. However, there are a number of ways that the pandemic has exacerbated racial inequality in America. At Carnegie Mellon, it’s no less clear.
“It’s incredibly important to get insight from our own students as to what their identity is and what issues they have faced because of their identity and how they think we can work to create an equitable and diverse environment for everyone,” Carden said. One way she proposed to do that is to formalize the home-grown system of anonymous reporting at cmutestimonies.site. She also hopes to use a centralized communication system to inform the student body of activism efforts on campus and locally in Pittsburgh. 
Beyond the issues that have been exacerbated as a result of the pandemic, Carden is interested in cutting down on disorganization within the student government. Carden said, “We need to create more detailed resources both to communicate within student government and to make the resources available to the student body. If the resources are disorganized and no one knows what the other individuals in student government are working on… then what student government is working on will be less effective.”
As a remote first-year, Carden has an important perspective on Carnegie Mellon. Her experience with our virtual community isn’t lacking — she is on the student government’s Committee on Student Organizations and a number of other clubs’ executive boards — and Carden, like so many others, will have to figure out how we return to in-person education.
