The Carnegie Mellon director of athletics, Susan Bassett, has appointed Todd Jackson and Sara Gauntner as assistant directors of athletics, with Jackson heading intramurals and club sports and Gauntner heading the instructional programs and recreation.
“We believe that leading an active lifestyle is an integral part of the educational experience. By adding Todd and Sara to our leadership team, we are confident we can provide the most conducive environment for recreational participation for all members of the Carnegie Mellon family,” Bassett said.
Gauntner remains the director of aquatics and assistant men’s and women’s swimming and diving coach, and Jackson will also become the director of intramurals to replace Mike Mastroianni. Mastroianni left Carnegie Mellon after a 23-year career with the athletics department to become director of athletics at Quaker Valley High School.
With the departure of Mastroianni, Bassett decided to restructure the department and create two more vital positions that will continue to develop the fitness and wellness programs set in place. 
Bassett expressed her enthusiasm for the new appointments, saying, “We are truly excited that Todd and Sara will lead our recreational athletics programming to the next level. This area of our department serves 90 percent of our student body as well as the campus community. This is a tremendous opportunity to bring fresh ideas to the department and encourage more individuals to engage in an active lifestyle.”
Jackson comes to Carnegie Mellon with three years of experience at Cornell University as the Robert D. Kennedy director of intramural sports, and has worked with recreational services at his alma mater, the University of Connecticut, where he graduated with a master’s degree in education, and Nova Southeastern University.
“I’m looking forward to working with an outstanding group of successful athletics department staff members, and I’m really excited about the opportunity to become engaged in recreational programs that involve the entire Carnegie Mellon campus community,” Jackson said.
Gauntner enters her fourth year at Carnegie Mellon with involvement with aquatics and varsity swimming. Last season, she was a member of the University Athletic Association Men’s Swimming and Diving Coaching Staff of the Year.
With a master’s degree from the School of Sports Leadership at Duquesne University, it is clear that her leadership as a coach and on the logistical side of aquatics demonstrates her keen ability to enhance the facilities, programs, equipment, and overall fitness and wellness experience at Carnegie Mellon.
“With this position, I am really looking forward to working with more people on campus and trying to get as many students involved in recreation,” Gauntner said. “The athletic department, university programs staff in particular, is very dedicated in reaching out to our campus so we can provide them with many opportunities outside the classroom.”
As she looks to the future, she anticipates expanding the fitness programs offered and hopes to “work closer with Donna Morosky [director of fitness] and Pattye Strager [operations manager and assistant director of fitness]. They bring much experience in fitness and recreation and I have enjoyed my last four years with them. We all share the same passion and can bring all our ideas together, which will certainly benefit the students.”
Since today is the first day of classes and the appointments are new as of last week, we can only look forward to the improvements in store for the spring semester.

The Carnegie Mellon athletics department has hired a new full-time assistant women’s soccer coach, filling the void left when former assistant Betsy Warren left after the end of last season. Entering her fourth season, head coach Sue Willard announced that Jennifer Myhre, most recently an assistant coach at Luther College for the 2008 season, will be the newest addition to the Tartans coaching staff.
“Jen was a very strong candidate for our assistant coaching position,” Coach Willard said. “She was excited and educated about what Carnegie Mellon offers its students in terms of academics and athletics. We also felt that Jen knows what it takes to be a successful student athlete because of her own academic and athletic pedigree.”
Myhre, who graduated summa cum laude from Messiah College in Grantham, Pa. in 2008, brings lots of collegiate soccer experience to the Tartans. During her undergraduate career at Messiah, Myhre helped the Falcons to a Division III national championship in 2005, and another trip to the finals in 2007. Messiah also made it to the semifinal round in 2004 and 2006. As a student, Myhre received a bachelor of arts in sports and exercise science, concentrating in sports management, as well as a bachelor of science in accounting.
While at Luther, Coach Myhre helped the Norse to an 11–7–2 finish in 2008. She has also coached at Northern York High School in Dillsburg, Pa., as well as at soccer camps at Messiah, Athletes in Action, and Soccer Academy Inc.
“It is an honor and privilege to be the assistant women’s soccer coach at Carnegie Mellon University,” said Myhre in a press release on Carnegie Mellon’s Athletics website. “I value Carnegie Mellon’s commitment to provide student-athletes with an unparalleled education, where learning not only occurs in the classroom, but also out on the athletic fields. I am excited to be a part of a women’s soccer program and athletic department where there is a passion and enthusiasm to pursue excellence in all areas of life.”
“Jen has a great understanding of team and individual training and will be a valuable asset in recruiting prospective student-athletes to Carnegie Mellon,” added Coach Willard.
The fact that Coach Myhre is the third assistant coach in four years is essentially a non-issue, according to Tartans senior Casey Garth. Garth, who has been through the coaching changes, said that although it takes time to adapt to a new assistant coach, she looks forward to working with Coach Myhre. “Jen brings a lot to our team; she not only has NCAA experience, but she has an NCAA championship under her belt, so she clearly knows what it takes to win. Jen was a great player and her technical ability has really been beneficial to the team thus far. I have been fortunate enough to play under three very talented assistant coaches Tony [Mohamed], Betsy [Warren], and now Jen, and I am really excited about working with Jen this year, and she has the knowledge and skills to help lead us to NCAAs.”

The popular show Dancing With the Stars pits B-list celebrities with professional dancers in an exciting dance contest of skill and grace. People we adore from a wide variety of professions practice for hours each week to so we can watch them foxtrot, tango, and samba toward the finale. However, the past eight seasons have shown athletes dominating the competition, with three former Olympians taking home the gold and three other winners being former athletes of sorts. So in a show about being creative and showy, why do athletes dominate the competition?
When one first thinks of dancing, one does not immediately compare the activity to exercise. But dancing is all about movement and body expression, kind of like a nonstop aerobic workout class. Preparation for any sport requires them to be stronger, faster, and more agile than the average person, especially if they are at the Olympic or world level. They train their bodies to last longer in competition so they can make the most out of those exhausting daily practices. Shawn Johnson, who won season eight, was an Olympic gymnast. Her superior flexibility, strength, and body control would make her an optimal candidate to quickly learn new dance moves each week and endure long hours of practice. Fourth season winner Apolo Anton Ohno was a former Winter Olympics speed skating champion with five medals on his belt. To be at the top of his sport, he would need incredible balance and agility.
In the fifth season, champion car racer Hélio Castroneves took home the gold. Already, he would have excellent motor skills, coordination, and focus. Also, in what would seem like the most obvious win, the sixth season saw Olympic medalist and world-renowned figure skater Kristi Yamaguchi breeze through the competition to win. Also, we can’t forget former NFL Dallas Cowboy and Arizona Cardinal runningback Emmitt Smith, who scored a touchdown in the final show of season three.
Seasoned athletes are also very strong mentally. Winning requires determination and a high level of concentration. In practice, athletes train to win and constantly push themselves to do better each time. Their routines must be regular and intense; otherwise they will never improve. Luckily for DWTS’s Olympians, these mental skill sets can be applied to dancing, which may be why every Olympian on the show has taken home the trophy.
Despite their training in different sports, what most of the winners of Dancing With the Stars have in common is that they compete on a regular basis, and are trained to pull out a win in the most stressful of situations. Dancing also gives athletes new challenges that cater to their abilities. During sports, many situations arise where athletes have to get creative and find unusual ways to win. Each of their added physical advantages just made them stronger competitors on the show. As Ohno reassured Johnson during week 11, “You bring a total different mentality from the Olympic games, and being a competitor [and having skills] that nobody else possesses. That’s what’s going to give you an edge over the competition.”
Dancing with the Stars seems to be a contest of athletics and style. Since the professional dancers supply the style part, any competitor who has a strong athletic background seems to be the obvious choice for succeeding. That is another reason why one can’t go wrong by becoming an athlete; skills gained from training and competition alone can help in ways one cannot have possibly imagined. I’m sorry, actors and models. Looking pretty just won’t cut it for an activity that is mainly movement. Dancing, like any other sport, requires practice, flexibility, and stamina. Perhaps why so many Olympians join the show is because the training, practice, and learning new ways to move and control their bodies can carry back over to their original sport. Finally, three-time gold medalist swimmer Natalie Coughlin will be competing on this season’s DWTS to bring the total Olympian count up to three. 
ABC will premiere season nine on Sept. 21 at 8 p.m.

During the month-long life of D. melanogaster, or the common fruit fly, the expression of its genes changes in dramatic ways to accommodate the differing needs of the organism.
In what is called a gene regulatory network, the expression of one gene may be in part responsible for the changes in the expression level of other genes. These networks, apart from coordinating the development of the organism, are also central to the functioning of certain diseases like cancers, in which the normal gene regulation of the cell is disrupted.
A better understanding of gene regulatory networks, and other complex systems, is being pioneered by the work of Eric Xing, an associate professor in Carnegie Mellon’s machine learning department, and his students.
In the July proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, Xing and his student Amr Ahmed presented TESLA, an algorithm for inferring the hidden relationships between variables over time.
In the majority of existing techniques used to understand relationships over time, a static network is inferred for each time step, from samples of the directly observable relationships.
However, in many problems of practical interest, these relationships are not observable, and “this hidden relationship is something that does exist, and has an influence on the behavior,” Xing said.
In contrast to other approaches, TESLA infers a network of evolving hidden relationships without the requirement of being able to observe the relationships.
Xing and Ahmed applied their algorithm to the voting records of the U.S. Senate. Although the accounts of individual Senators may not be complete or truthful, “if people are related, then their behavior will be similar,” Xing said. The inferred network, indeed,   showed two large cliques, the Democratic and Republican Senators, bridged by a few moderate and independent Senators.
Similarly, the ways that different sets of genes interact are not well understood, yet “the data is a proxy to the unobservable topology,” Xing explained.
Applying their algorithm to a set of samples of gene expression levels taken over the lifetime of a fruit fly, Xing and Ahmed were able to infer an evolving gene regulatory network. The network showed great changes in toplogy corresponding to the different developmental stages of the larva, pupa, and adult fly.
Such studies of life science are not new for Xing. 
“After I graduated with a degree in physics,” he said, “I decided to use my knowledge to study life systems, because there are a lot of interesting open problems, and the solutions to those problems can improve human health.”
For a time, he studied cancer and several other diseases.
However, “it wasn’t enough to let me study complex biological systems, because there is no way to complete all the experiments that you want to do with human life spans and limited resources, which is what brought me to computer science.”
Now, his formal training in biology helps him to understand the motivations and goals of computational biology.
The work in TESLA is a stepping stone to the even more complex issues in computational biology.
“For large organisms, a lot of cells have the same DNA, but act in a different way — we think that in different cell types, the gene networks are functioning differently,” said Song Le, a Lane Fellow in computational biology at Carnegie Mellon who has been working with Xing.
By extending TESLA to include not only variations in time, but variations over space, Xing’s group hopes to shed light on cell differentiation — the way that the individual cells of a multicellular organism know how they should develop, becoming neurons, liver cells, or other types of cells depending on where they are in the body.
The overarching aim of the group’s project, Le said, is “to provide a set of tools for biologists to use networks to generate hypotheses and do experiments — and to use experimental results to refine the model.”

For architects, making wooden models of their designs probably requires painstakingly hard work. One first has to cut the wood, glue it or nail it together, and then start with the painting and fine detailing. Making such prototypes of their work is tedious even for artists and engineers. It requires a large amount of time and effort just to make these small models. However, with a new technique, it is possible to create these designs on the computer and then have a model of the design in one’s hands in just a matter of hours. These new machines, aptly called 3-D printers, allow models of objects to be “printed” based on a 3-D design.
3-D printers use simulations created on a computer and produce exact three-dimensional replicas of the simulations. As of now, 3-D printing is used to create models of newly designed products, and this technique has become so refined that the printers are even able to “print” prototypes with moving parts. Considering the fact that building conventional models would require days of painstaking labor, it is hard not to wonder how these printers manage to build something so complicated within a matter of hours.
Although 3-D printers resemble ink jet printers from the outside, their working is quite different. The initial 3-D design of the object has to be created on the computer. A variety of computer-aided design (CAD) software is available for this. The software helps analyze the shape of the object, breaks it down into layers, and determines the shape of each layer. Information regarding the shape of each layer is then sent to the 3-D printer. The printer builds the object by printing individual layers and stacking them one on top of the other. The layers are extremely thin, and according to a paper from the EDUCAUSE Evolving Technologies Committee, thicknesses range from 0.0035 to 0.007 inches. This concept of stacking layers can be used to build objects of virtually any size.
The only limiting factor is the size of the box of the printer — the bigger the box, the larger the object that can be produced. Again, depending on the size of the object that has to be printed, the time taken for the process to be completed varies from anywhere from one to 12 hours. Although this basic concept is the same for all types of 3-D printers, what makes each type unique is the way the layers are produced.
Printers employing the fused-deposition modeling technique build layers using semi-molten plastic. The plastic used is acrylonitrile butadiene styrene plastic and is relatively non-toxic and durable. When the molten plastic comes out of the printer, it sticks to the layer below it as it hardens, and provides a convenient method of fusing the layers together. Since the plastic is molten, supports often need to be used to keep the layers in place, and once the plastic hardens, these are removed.
The other type of printers are the powder-binder printers. The layers are made up of a powder that is similar to loose plaster. A printer head sprays the powder layer with some sort of binding glue and then the next layer is deposited on top. This process goes on until the object is built. The advantage of this method is that a variety of different materials can be used to make the powder. Hence, if one wants to make the model out of a specific material other than plastic, the powder-binding technique can prove to be extremely useful. In fact, according to an article on singularityhub.com, a European company called Shapeways has recently created a printer that can create objects made of stainless steel. With this new development, the range of objects that can be created using such printers has expanded greatly.
Although the capabilities of such systems are tremendous, scientists are constantly trying to make them even better. An article in New Scientist reports that researchers from the University of California at Berkeley are trying to build objects as complex as light bulbs from 3-D printers. The researchers plan to do this by building layers of semiconductor and conductor materials in such a way that the basic circuits are built as a part of the main body of the device. The team has already discovered how to print basic electronic components like transistors and capacitors. If they manage to “print” such a light bulb, they might soon look at more complicated electronics like remote controls, cell phones, and radios.
With such projects in the pipeline, it is evident that this technology holds great prospects for the future. As of now, however, companies are constantly coming up with ways to make 3-D printing more accessible to the general public. Shapeways has come up with a service that enables users to submit their designs online to Shapeways and Shapeways prints out the prototypes for the users at a rather cheap cost. Such novel ideas have allowed this technology to be available for use to nearly everyone.

With the recent swine flu scare, we decided to focus this edition of Health Talk on the disease. Below you will find general information regarding the disease, tips to prevent it from spreading, and even first-hand experiences from others that have had the flu.
What is the swine flu?
H1N1 is a new strain of influenza virus currently infecting people worldwide. It was detected in the United States in April of this year and has been classified a pandemic by the World Health Organization. Since the end of July, case counting has been discontinued due to inaccurate counting.
H1N1 has acquired the “swine flu” moniker because of two genetic similarities to influenza viruses that occur normally in North American pigs. H1N1 also shares genes from viruses circulating among both birds and humans — this is known as a quadruple reassortant virus.
Who is susceptible?
Epidemiological data collected by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) suggests that susceptibility to the H1N1 virus is irregularly skewed to people younger than 25, rather than the usual high risk for those 65 years and older. This is most likely indicative of a pre-existing immunity to this strain of influenza. There is still a higher rate of seniors becoming hospitalized, though, due to flu-related complications that are not as serious among younger patients.
How does H1N1 spread?
It spreads in the same way as the seasonal flu — from person to person through coughing or sneezing by those infected. There is also the risk of becoming infected by touching an object or surface that has been exposed to the virus.
What are the symptoms?
They include fever, cough, sore throat, a runny or stuffy nose, body aches, headache, chills, and fatigue. 
When I was infected, the first three days were the worst with a temperature above 101 degrees, a bad cough, and a head that felt like it was twice its normal size. I slept 12 to 14 hours a day and ended up feeling better by the fifth and sixth day. 
People infected with H1N1 flu are able to infect others from a day before symptoms show up to five to seven days after. You should stay home for at least seven days or until 24 hours after symptoms end.
If my roommate is infected, can I still go to class?
As long as you continue to practice precautionary behavior like washing your hands and keeping shared surfaces sanitized while monitoring your own health for flu symptoms, it should be fine to continue your daily activities. 
Can I get infected with H1N1 from eating pork?
No.
Are there vaccines available to prevent H1N1?
Flu vaccine production and testing is ongoing with five manufacturers. The FDA expects to have around 50 million doses available by mid-October, continuing production to supply another 150 million doses by the end of this year. Vaccination will most likely be a two-shot process, separated by a two-to-four-week wait between inoculations.
Remember three rules of staying healthy:
Wash your hands, cover your mouth and nose when you cough, and stay home if you’re sick.

Plastic releases chemicals in oceans
According to a new study by scientists in Japan, plastic can decompose easily in oceans and release certain chemicals that could severely harm animals and even humans.
The scientists stimulated the decomposition of plastic in oceans at 86 degrees Fahrenheit, and this resulted in the production of harmful chemicals like bisphenol A (BPA) and PS oligomer.
Scientists expect this decomposition to be much faster in natural oceans, as temperatures in oceans often go above 86 degrees Fahrenheit.
The scientists also analyzed samples from oceans in the United States, Japan, India, and Europe and found traces of such byproducts of plastic decomposition.

Research gives new  insight on evolution
Recent research shows that endosymbiosis of two prokaryotic cells, which lack a nucleus, could have been the beginning of life on Earth. Through endosymbiosis, one cell can live inside another cell.
Earlier, only eukaryotic cells, cells that contain a nucleus, were known to undergo endosymbiosis.
This research, published in the journal Nature, shows that endosymbiosis of two groups of prokaryotes — actinobacteria and clostridia — led to the development of the double-membraned cell.
Subgroups of these primitive cells then developed the ability to use oxygen and eventually gave rise to the modern-day organisms.

New screens stretch across surfaces
Scientists at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign have developed LED display screens that can stretch over objects ranging from the sides of a car to the human body.
To create such screens, the scientists first fixed the light-emitting diodes (LEDs) onto a thin surface that was later dissolved using certain chemicals. The LEDs were held in place during the washing process and were later fixed onto a flexible plastic, glass, or rubber surface.
This novel technique combines the flexibility achieved by using organic materials with the durability and brightness of LEDs.
The panels thus made are also nearly transparent and could be used on windows of vehicles. 
The research was published in the journal Science.

NASA plans shuttle launch tomorrow
NASA has scheduled the launch of the space shuttle Discovery this Tuesday at 1:36 a.m.
NASA initially had to conduct tests to ensure that foam covering was staying on the tank of the shuttle.
These tests were done following the incident with the shuttle Endeavour last month in which the foam fell off of the tank.
Although Endeavour did not suffer any other damage, foam damage created a hole in the wing of the space shuttle Columbia that led to its disintegration in 2003.
Tests on Discovery, however, revealed that the foam was in place.
Discovery will be on a 13-day mission to continue the construction of the International Space Station.

Hepatitis C response  aided by genetics
During treatment for hepatitis C, patients undergo a 48-week course of the antiviral drugs interferon and ribavirin. This treatment is much more successful in Americans of European descent than in African-Americans.
A team at Duke University has discovered that the reason for the treatment’s varying effectiveness is not due to differing access to health care.
The team, led by David B. Goldstein and John McHutchison, uncovered a DNA coding site that is close to the gene for a special kind of interferon, known as interferon-lambda-3.
Some people have DNA unit T’s on both copies of the genome (one from each parent), C’s on both copies, or one T and one C.
People with the CC allele respond much better to the standard hepatitis treatment than people with the TT allele. Because the CC allele is more common in Europeans than in Africans, this explains part of the difference in response to the treatment between the two races.

Heroin cures heroin addiction
Researchers from Canada, led by Eugenia Oviedo-Joekes, reported that out of 226 heroin addicts in Montreal and Vancouver, 54 percent of those who got oral methadone stayed away from drugs and continued treatment for a year. However, 88 percent who received diacetylmorphine shots stayed on treatment and did not take drugs for the same period of time.
Diacetylmorphine is an active ingredient in heroin. Those who got the shots also cut back on illicit drugs by 67 percent, compared to 48 percent of those  who got the oral treatment (methadone). The shots were given in a proper medical setting which, researchers claim, can lower risk of overdose and seizures.

Swine flu spreads to birds
Officials in Chile reported that swine flu has now started infecting birds. Experts claim that there is nothing to worry about, as the turkeys that have been infected have only shown mild symptoms. None of the birds have died and the virus does not appear to have mutated into a more deadly form.
Until now, the H1N1 virus has proved to be highly infectious but not more deadly than the seasonal flu. However, experts worry that the virus may combine with the avian flu virus, giving rise to a more deadly form of the disease.

New drug targets cancer stem cells
Researchers from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and the Broad Institute have discovered a new compound that can destroy breast cancer stem cells, which have previously resisted treatment and are thought to be the cause of recurrent cancers.
The scientists believe that this compound could be effective against cancer stem cells for different types of cancer.
Cancer stem cells are difficult to destroy and are also difficult to study in a laboratory. The group stabilized the cancer stem cells in order to study them and tested them with 16,000 chemical compounds, narrowing down to the one compound that was effective in killing them.

This year’s Orientation, like every year, had an inspiring theme that promoted enthusiasm and teamwork among the incoming first-years. 
Unleashed, this year’s theme, saw everyone donning T-shirts that depicted Carnegie Mellon’s mascot, Scotty, breaking free of its leash; symbolic of the idea that all first-years should break away from their fears and blend into college life.
Highlights from Orientation, including annual events like Convocation, Playfair, and House Wars, are pictured.

The summer marks the separation of students at Carnegie Mellon as many go back to their hometowns and to a different culture, both musically and socially. However, as the student population returns to college, the reuniting of musical interests offers the ability for students to further their appreciation for music. 
Apart from this intriguing reintegration into the Carnegie Mellon student population, there are several upcoming musical events that are equally interesting. Be it new albums or concerts in Pittsburgh, the fall semester has several appealing events.  
Watch out before these hit stores
Arctic Monkeys — Humbug
After a nearly two-year-long hiatus, the Arctic Monkeys have returned with their new album, Humbug. Expect an album filled with vigorous energy and over-stylized British accents as Humbug hits stores Tuesday. This new album might be the perfect back-to-school affair, giving students some upbeat shoetapping as they begin to buckle down for the upcoming semester. The band’s debut, Whatever People Say I Am, That’s What I’m Not, was a high-energy album full of dance tunes, so good that it was the fastest-selling debut album in British history. Although they hit the so-called sophomore slump with Favorite Worst Nightmare, expect the Arctic Monkeys to make a statement with Humbug. 
While Humbug has me interested, there are some aspects that have me worried. The Arctic Monkeys have not attempted to truly augment portions of their sound to breathe new air into their music. This is worrisome, as The Strokes were great with their debut but quickly died due to their constant recycling of the same signature sound. 
Weezer — Raditude
Weezer’s rumored LP 7 is no longer a rumor and has entered the realm of reality, as the band releases its new album called Raditude. Weezer’s return to the mainstream last summer seems to have resulted in the return of Rivers Coumo’s writing passion. While Raditude is certainly a silly name, it definitely perpetuates Coumo’s trope, painting him as a nerdy, hopeless romantic. What is exciting about Raditude is that the new single “I Want You To” is one of the catchiest songs of Weezer’s career. “I Want You To” brings back the airier aspects of last year’s self-titled (red) album. Expect Raditude to land on Oct. 27.  
The main troubling aspect about the new album is whether the other members of the band sing. The worst songs on last year’s Weezer LP were those sung by anyone not named Rivers Coumo. As much as Weezer is a band, Coumo is the definite leader and should be the sole voice of the band. The other troubling aspect of Raditude is whether Weezer is able to put enough creative songs into the album. The very fact that other people sang on last year’s LP showed that Coumo wasn’t able to write enough great songs to fill the album. “I Want You To” is a great single, though not as good as last year’s “Pork and Beans.”

The Gaslight Anthem
Playing their last few shows before heading into the studio to record their next album due early 2010, The Gaslight Anthem is returning to Pittsburgh merely months after its previous performance here. The band is scheduled to play once again at Mr. Small’s Theatre & Funhouse on Sept. 8, and they usually put on a great show. Having seen them live, The Gaslight Anthem does not disappoint. The headman, Brian Fallon, is a very entertaining host as he tells stories and jokes with a very humble attitude.
The only worry with seeing The Gaslight Anthem is that the band’s songs do not vary widely, though this is only a problem if the signature sound is not appealing to the listener. 
Otherwise, there is no worry in seeing the group live, as their sound is much sharper and more energetic than in the studio. Fallon’s between-song banter can sometimes flesh out aspects of the songs, giving some of the more downtrodden songs much more emotion.
Japandroids
Japandroids is supporting its debut LP, Post-Nothing, by coming to Pittsburgh’s Garfield Artworks on Oct. 7. Japandroids is made up of Brian King on guitar and David Prowse on drums. 
Their sound is an interesting mix of fuzzed-out guitar, attacking drums, and laid-back voice. While Japandroids takes cues from various areas in the indie music scene, the band’s sound seems heavily similar to the garage punk of No Age’s Nouns. Japandroids doesn’t have an extensive foray into the music world. Because Post-Nothing is its first full LP, expect the band’s set to be relatively small. However, the relative newness of the band also makes its live sets oddly foretelling of its future sound. 
As bands evolve, the stage offers a place to see how the audience reacts to inner struggles with their musical style. They might cover other bands’ songs using their style, perhaps introduce new songs that they are working on for their sophomore LP, or possibly struggle on stage as they begin to receive more popularity. New bands always offer an interesting live show.

I was spending my summer in Germany, and since it was a perfect sunny day, I had decided to go the beach, have some cold refreshments, and just relax. But, suddenly, the sun was too bright and I found myself looking for sunglasses... in my dorm room at 5:30 a.m. While in Germany, the summer sun would unfailingly wake me up way before my alarm went off. And punctuality is a characteristic of not just the German sun.
In order to reach my 8:30 a.m. class on time, I would ride an overflowing 7:15 a.m. S-Bahn to Marienplatz, the town center of Munich. The school children on the train would be happy and chatty, even at that hour, comparing notes and homework, while all the adults going to work would be wearing perfectly pressed suits and reading either the newspaper or a book.
Even as I walked through Sendlinger Tor at this early hour, I found myself in the company of shopkeepers and pharmacists. Most of the shops and drug stores would be open by half past seven. Admiring the German work ethic, I would walk straight into a baeckerei for some hot tea and freshly baked bread.
Baking is not just a major profession in Germany, it is also a significant part of their culture. I realized this when the only assigned project in my class was on bread. At first, my friends and I were ready to dismiss the project as silly, but soon we were to realize its purpose and importance. My classmates and I decided to meet at a bakery across the street right after class. I am sure the locals found it amusing to see a bunch of foreigners literally studying the different varieties of bread, with pen and paper in hand. After about half an hour of inspection, we left the bakery dissatisfied with only 30 kinds of bread. We clearly needed more options. So, we spent the rest of the afternoon visiting many more bakeries, trying and testing the delicious breads.
In the land of brezel, or pretzel as we know it, there are over 300 different varieties of bread to choose from. If you want to try some, you’d better go to a bakery in the first half of the day, because post lunch, most of it is usually sold out.
Variety is offered to you not only in bread, but almost everything else as well. In magnificent Munich, you will find something to do, no matter what your interests are: food, history, sports, music, engineering, or art.
On my first Saturday in Germany, I visited Dachau. Dachau, located very close to Munich, used to be one of the concentration camps between 1933 and 1945. It was one of the bigger camps and the only one that never went kaput — until they all did, that is. As a result, a little over 2 million prisoners were here at some point. As if the statistics weren’t enough, the gray clouds and the persistent rain continued to dampen my spirits, but somehow, that felt right.
First, I went to see the concentration camp museum. It’s a good start to the tour since it presents you with a mild introduction to the harsh reality. I say it was a mild introduction since some parts of the barricade were repainted and had displays of various items. Later, when I went to see the actual prison cells and the crematory, the darkness and emptiness stunned me. There’s something in there that makes you feel shock, sadness, and freedom.
Fortunately, this tor, or door, has been closed, which brings me to the second tor I encountered in Munich.
“Drei ... Zwei ... Eins ... TOR! (3… 2… 1… Goal!)” was the only chant reverberating throughout the Allianz Arena (pictured above, courtesy of author), a soccer stadium and also the home ground of Munich’s two professional football clubs, FC Bayern Munich and TSV 1860 Munich. This imposing stadium, normally white, seats about 70,000 fans. The unique characteristic of this stadium is its outer appearance. It is lit up red when FC Bayern Munich plays and blue when TSV 1860 Munich does.
Just visiting the stadium got my adrenaline flowing. I can’t imagine how it must be to actually play there. The electrifying atmosphere, the expectation, the team spirit! What more could you ask for? Only, perhaps, a win.
That’s not the only time when I got an adrenaline rush in Munich. Other than beer and cars, the Germans are also famous for their autobahnen. An autobahn is a German federal highway, which is unlike any highway you see in other countries. Instead of having a maximum speed limit, these highways have an unofficial minimum speed of 80 mph. The lush, green, picturesque backdrop only makes the experience even more worthwhile. I still remember the thrill of driving at over 130 mph like I did yesterday.
Even though I was experiencing many firsts on my trip, toward the end of my stay, I found myself feeling comfortable in the local culture, so much so that eventually I started thinking in German. This was a big first for me, because in spite of my many travels, I have never experienced the culture of a country to have such a profound effect on me. So, although I miss the brezel, the beer gardens, and the S-bahns, I feel happy to carry a bit of Germany around with me.

The summer of 2009 was a season that gave audiences some memorable blockbusters. There were billion-dollar action scenes, a journey into the criminal mind, and the never-ending exploration of the complexities of relationships. Following is a roundup of the highly anticipated favorites and an indie film that graced the silver screen.
Transformation
Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen, directed by Michael Bay and produced by Steven Spielberg, is the action-packed sequel to this dynamic duo’s 2007 blockbuster. 
This comedic, heart-pounding film continues the story of Sam Witwicky (Shia LeBeouf) and his robotic yellow Camaro as they fight to save the world again. The frequent action sequences in Bay’s film are both easy to follow and visually stimulating. 
With two hours and 30 minutes of college parties, pushy roommates, transforming cars, and Barack Obama references, it is no wonder that Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen was one of the most successful movies at the box office this summer.    
Trigger happy
Johnny Depp’s portrayal of the notorious bank robber and outlaw John Dillinger in the summer smash hit Public Enemies was nothing less than astounding. Not only did Depp embody the criminal nature of Dillinger, but he also captured the romance and thrill that this story offers. Public Enemies — which revolves around crime in the Midwest during the 1930s — was filmed in high-definition digital, which allowed the detail in director Michael Mann’s shots to jump off the screen. Don’t be surprised if you see this technique in films to come. 
But… I love you! 
After riveting films like Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen and Public Enemies, what could be much better? A romance, of course! Well, it wasn’t really a romance. 500 Days of Summer, directed by Marc Webb, is more like a love-me or love-me-not film. This film stars Joseph Gordon-Levitt and Zooey Deschanel and explores the reason why Summer (Deschanel) dumps Tom (Gordon-Levitt). 
Though this may seem a bit melodramatic — with heart-fluttering moments and greeting cards — 500 Days of Summer is full of comedic relief. Webb’s film, which was featured in the 2009 Sundance Film Festival, was an undoubtedly remarkable tale of a relationship that led to self-discovery.
Same ol’ love story
While director Judd Apatow’s Funny People did not provide many laughs — just pity giggles — The Ugly Truth, directed by Robert Luketic, was a romantic comedy that actually evoked a genuine reaction. 
Though this film wasn’t exactly original, it is always interesting to see the story of two people — Abby (Katherine Heigl) and Mike (Gerard Butler) — who start off hating each other and fall in love by the end of the film.

Regardless of whether this summer was just a long snooze or a fast-paced adventure, getting back to the regular college grind might not be easy. The thoughts of picking up textbooks once again and midterms hovering on the horizon can be quite painful, and with the week spent with classes and the latter half of the weekend used to finish homework, enjoying a free Saturday seems to be the only light at the end of this long, dark tunnel.   
While there are numerous options open to the student population at Carnegie Mellon for how to spend these special Saturdays, one of the most attractive, and definitely the most outdoorsy, ways is to utilize Pittsburgh Connections. 
A program run by the Office of Student Activities, Pittsburgh Connections aims to mobilize students all over Western Pennsylvania by involving them in outdoor activities. 
According to the Carnegie Mellon website, the program’s main objectives are to “help students develop and maintain a physically active lifestyle, build leadership skills, and increase their appreciation for the Western Pennsylvania region.” 
The program hosts an Outdoor Adventure Series, which gives students an opportunity to travel to off-campus locations and take part in exciting activities at a partially subsidized fee. These activities take place every Saturday, and up to 40 students can participate simultaneously. 
Depending on the weather conditions, students can take their pick of which activities interest them most. Those fond of water sports can have some fun kayaking, snorkeling, or rafting. Others, who are interested in more rugged activities, can opt for rock climbing, hiking, horseback riding, caving, and wilderness survival. 
The program runs even during the cold Pittsburgh winter, and introduces activities like skiing, snowboarding, snowmobiling, and snow shoeing that prove apt for the weather. If none of these options appeal to you, there’s always paintballing or a scavenger hunt that are a little less in the outdoors and more in the fun. 
Tickets for all these activities can be purchased at the University Center Information Desk. The schedule of activities for fall 2009 will be posted soon at http://www.studentaffairs.cmu.edu/StudentActivities/pghconnections/outdoor.html, and students can contact pgh-connections@andrew.cmu.edu for more information.

This summer Pixar released Up, its 10th feature film. This film follows the story of Carl Fredricksen, a grouchy old man, and Russell, a persistent little boy, who travel to South America in a floating house.
The movie begins by showing Carl when he meets his future wife, Ellie, and how they bond over their love for adventure and their shared idol, the explorer Charles Muntz. Though their personalities are quite different with Carl being introverted and Ellie being very outgoing, they have a happy life growing old together. Throughout their marriage, the two share a dream of traveling to Paradise Falls in South America to explore like Muntz; however, they never quite make it to Paradise Falls due to Ellie’s illness that takes her away from the world.
The now bitter and lonely Carl is left alone in his house that is standing in the middle of a big city and surrounded by construction. Unable to keep his house, Carl decides to blow up 10,000 helium balloons to fly his house like an airship to Paradise Falls. As his house starts leaving the ground, Carl finds Russell, a Wilderness Explorer who is only missing the “assisting the elderly” badge. 
Russell was accidentally taken up into the sky because he had been under Carl’s front porch trying to help Carl catch a wild beast in order to fulfill the requirements of this badge. From there on, Russell and Carl travel to South America, only to realize that they were one canyon away from Paradise Falls. 
Upon arrival, Russell and Carl begin their own adventure filled with danger and a new set of unusual friends. Russell immediately bonds with an exotic bird that follows the two travelers, naming it Kevin. Carl, meanwhile, is overwhelmed to find out that his childhood idol, Muntz, is in South America. But Muntz is not what he had expected. Muntz has become a man obsessed with capturing the very same exotic bird that Russell has become attached to, and is willing to destroy anything and anyone who gets in the way of what he wants.
Unfortunately, this means that when Carl and Russell decide to save Kevin and return the bird to her babies — Russell hadn’t known it was a female bird when he named it — they are up against Muntz. On their trip, they team up with a talking dog named Dug, who should have been following Muntz’s orders and killed the duo, but decides to follow his heart instead. This crazy journey allows Carl and Russell to form a strange but loving family-like bond that Carl thought he had lost with Ellie. 
This wonderful movie is a must see for all Pixar fans and anyone who is looking for an inspirational, heartwarming story and a good laugh.

A small blurb in this issue, titled “Naming our ‘field,’” talks about christening the new field that has become a part of the campus. To avoid the default name of “Tech Field,” which the article states “suggests stubble, ash-heaps or tin cans according to the part of the country you come from,” The Tartan wishes to suggest names in its next issue so that a proper title can be given. The writer expresses concern that an unseemly name, no matter how unfitting, will stick.

This week’s issue sports one of the longest headlines ever published. Located in the Features section, the title reads: “Information Age brings rapid and radical changes with onset; issues, areas affected include computers, labor, employment.” Guess there’s really no need to read the article now.

In the spirit of the Welcome Back issue of The Tartan, this week’s A Person’s Opinion asks students what they missed most about college life over the summer. Apart from standard answers like “seeing my friends” and “the campus,” one student said she missed “the cute football players” the most, while another said “not a lot.”

Although informative, AlcoholEdu is one of the most tedious things that first-years have to do once they finish Orientation. A long list of questions about alcohol consumption and associated hazards, AlcoholEdu was first introduced this year, much to the resentment of the present and future first-year classes.

The drinking age debate now has some surprising supporters for lowering the age to 18: presidents of colleges like Dartmouth, Tufts, and Duke University. The rationale behind their argument is to legalize drinking for 18-year-olds to prevent deaths from alcohol poisoning.

I meant to write an article remembering Les Paul — rock and roll pioneer, solid-body inventor, someone for whom hokey grandiose terms like “icon” and “legend” hardly begin to suffice in description. After all, this was a man who still played a gig every Monday night in New York well into his 90s. What I didn’t mean (read: want) to do was talk about Michael Jackson. But the King of Pop has gone to sleep, and while the media is doing their best to puppeteer his post-mortem circus, the reality is he’s not waking up, and that’s a troublesome spoonful to swallow for many of us.
The incongruity between infamy and the affliction of being mortal is no news. There’s been screaming for years about “[our] idols being dead,” and while some of them may have left a legacy of literature, art, music, or what have you, the simple fact is that no one can ever really live on.
People love and hate untimely celebrity deaths because they are both spectacular and incredibly uncomfortable. Death is really the one event that brings cultural superstars back down to our playing field. As a result, we’re reminded of what French critic Charles du Bos called le réveil mortel, a concept that I think is well-described by author Julian Barnes as a “wake-up call to mortality.” Now, if you’re like me, you experience this sensation at least once a day. Thankfully, the majority of pop-culture consuming population is not, and while there is a sort of reminder in some allusive lyrics or on elaborate TV hospital dramas, those points of reference are so filtered and far removed from reality that they generally lack any ability to cull a true reminder of the inevitable end. So, when one of the largest stars falls from the proverbial celebrity sky, regardless of any bizarre circumstances or sensational rumors, there’s no denying the fact that that person is dead, as dead as all of us will someday be.
Our hope is, of course, that “someday” is later rather than sooner. Les Paul died, and while he was an incredibly famous and genius musician (etc.), his death came at a perfectly acceptable time. It’s Michael Jackson’s death that inspires that réveil mortel because he was only fifty, because he was about to do a massive tour, and because, frankly, the world wasn’t done with him yet. And that’s the same sort of unexpected “but my work’s not done here...” sort of injustice that inspires our collective fear of death. We all have our own respective sold-out tours and untouched warehouses of wardrobe. It’s just that, in the end, we are afforded one thing no superstar can have: the courtesy of being able to slip out quietly.

Dear Rohit,
I am not able to sleep for normal periods of time these days. My eyes open up just after four hours even though I am really tired. What should I do?
— Not Able to Properly Sleep
Dear NAPS,
Your problem is not uncommon at Carnegie Mellon because of the workload for students here. 
Your body gets used to a certain sleep pattern and it’s hard to break out of it, but not impossible, and that’s what I am here to help you with. 
First of all, avoid caffeine or energy drinks late at night. Try not to work out too late at night; you don’t want to be working on your muscles at 4 a.m. in the gym. 
Also, don’t do any other high-energy activities right before you go to sleep. Instead, try using whatever relaxes you. 
I use Mozart’s symphonies to drift off — there’s nothing more beautiful and calming. Also, avoid thinking about all the work you have pending for the next day. It doesn’t go away! 
Finally, if all else fails, read course material from your most boring class, and you are guaranteed to doze right off.
Snore away, 
— Rohit
Dear Rohit,
There is this boy who I have been friends with since high school. We love spending time with each other and everything was great until he started developing feelings for me. 
I like him but I don’t want to date him. How can I say “not interested” without sounding rude and affecting our friendship?
— Emotionally Messed Up
Dear Messed Up,
This really is a mess. I sympathize with you because this is not even your fault, unless you count being too good a friend and irresistible. 
There’s no easy way out of this situation, and your best bet would be to tell him directly what the problem is and get him to understand why it wouldn’t work between you. 
Throw in a few lines about how great a friend he has been and how you would always want him by your side as a good buddy. 
Things might get awkward for a bit, but in the longer run I am sure everything will get back to the perfect state of affairs they were, and then everyone’s happy.
Mess Sorted,
— Rohit

A Carnegie Mellon student died Thursday in a stairwell in Wean Hall, officials say.
According to an early article from KDKA, police believe that the student may have taken his own life, though homicide investigators are still investigating the scene.
The student, who the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette identified as Rohan Vakharia, 19, of Gainesville, Fla., was found at the bottom of a stairwell in Wean Hall. Vakharia was a sophomore in SCS.
For a full update, check our website tomorrow. Updates will be posted as we receive more information.

If you have ever felt uninterested or unsatisfied with the food selection at Carnegie Mellon, get ready to have your interest revitalized and your taste buds tingling.
For the past year and a half, the Dining Services Advisory Council, composed of students, staff, faculty members, and the director of Housing and Dining Services, has worked to improve dining options at Carnegie Mellon by compiling feedback that they’ve received through e-mail, comment cards, and surveys. They used the information they gathered about food selection, quality, and customer service, and put a plan into action to ensure the campus community would be happy with the dining options this year.
A major part of this plan was hiring a new company, CulinArt, to create all-new dining venues and options. Downtown Deli, previously known as East Street Deli, now has an upgraded sandwich station offering wraps, paninis, melts, and a build-your-own sandwich option. Stir Crazy, formerly known as Bento Bowl, now offers new rice and noodle creations and dim sum meals. 
In addition to these upgraded venues, CulinArt has created some brand new locations. Spinning Salads offers fresh, tossed-to-order salads, where you pick your favorite veggies, proteins, and toppings. Totally Juiced is an all-new fresh fruit and juice bar that offers a variety of nutritious options. But the UC is not the only place that has undergone a dining transformation.
The Resnik Café, which used to have only Taste of India, now also has Sushi Too, a traditional Japanese sushi restaurant; Take Comfort, which offers some selections that will remind you of home, such as rotisserie chicken, meatloaf, and cornbread; and Spice It Up Grill, a premium grill station that offers a variety of burgers during the day and more hearty selections at night, such as baby back ribs and jumbo shrimp.
“I wasn’t planning on getting a meal plan until I got back to campus and saw the great changes that were being made,” said Ashley Reid, a senior psychology major and resident assistant who has gotten to eat from some of these venues over Orientation week.
In order to give you a taste of the many options available this year, CulinArt is hosting an event called “Taste of the Tartans” on Sept. 8 from 11 a.m. to 2 p.m. in Rangos Hall. It is a free event that will allow the campus community to sample something from every dining location on campus.
“Our hope is to introduce members of the community to all of the dining services that are available and encourage them to not only be a customer but also to give people a chance to learn about all the places that they can find dining locations,” said Kim Abel, director of Dining Services.
All of these changes in meal options might make you wonder what changes have been made to the meal plans. There are three major changes: First is that DineX that is tied to your meal plan will last you the entire semester, rather than disappearing and refilling every two weeks. “The goal of this [change] is to allow students more flexibility with how they use that money,” Abel said. Instead of students using all their DineX on cash-out weekends because they have to, they can wait to purchase things that they actually want.
Secondly, in addition to the traditional plans — the red, blue, and green plans — and the DineX only plans, there is now a community plan. These plans allow you a certain number of meals per semester. Again, instead of eating meals because you don’t want to waste them, this plan allows you to only eat meals when you really want them.
Lastly, each of the meal plans now allows you to have two guest meals per semester. This means that you can now use your meal plan twice to take someone else out. Abel admits that this is not a lot, “but we are piloting to see how well it is received.”
Remember that you don’t just have to use your DineX on campus. DineX can also be used at the Subway on Craig Street, the Eat ’n Park on Murray Avenue, and for Vocelli’s Pizza. Coming in September, all campus-owned residence halls will have vending machines that will accept DineX also.
Another exciting addition to our dining places is entertainment. With karaoke, open mic, trivia night, and movie marathons, “these locations will no longer be just places to eat. They will be places to experience life at Carnegie Mellon,” Abel said.
When asked if she was excited for the dining options this year, Tina Robinson, a senior directing major, said, “I can’t wait! It seems like Carnegie Mellon has really stepped it up and I’m excited for the changes that are coming. The food looks great.”
Dining at Carnegie Mellon has undergone a thorough transformation and the people at Housing and Dining Services understand that often with change comes discontent. 
It is important to understand that student input is critical in decisions about dining. Housing and Dining is launching a centralized customer feedback process so that anyone can give their feedback and it can be shared with the vendors. Students who would like to take a more active role can visit the Housing and Dining Services office and ask to be a part of the Dining Services Advisory Council.

In the early hours of Sunday, August 16, a Carnegie Mellon student was robbed at gunpoint at the intersection of Forbes Avenue and Margaret Morrison Street. This is not the first time a Carnegie Mellon student has been robbed; such an event during the late hours of the night isn’t a foreign concept to Carnegie Mellon students. 
However, most robberies of any sort have occurred off campus in the vicinity of Fifth Avenue, toward the University of Pittsburgh campus. This most recent theft is the closest to campus an armed robbery has reportedly occurred.
Three men, presumably not Carnegie Mellon students, pulled up to the victim in a silver minivan, forced him to the ground with the use of a semi-automatic handgun, and consequently forced him to provide his ATM PIN after stealing his wallet and cell phone. Noel Titus, a first-year engineering student, had been with friends on Margaret Morrison Street when he happened across the victim. He described the victim as an Asian male who was alone. Around 2:30 a.m., the victim asked Titus for the University Police’s number, but Titus was unable to help him.
According to Titus, the victim continued down Forbes Avenue, and ended up at the Cut. Here he encountered Christian Aponte, another first-year. Aponte was with friends when he decided to ask some Pi Kappa Alpha fraternity brothers if he could take part in painting the Fence on the Cut. While Aponte was painting, the robbery vicitm approached him and asked to borrow a cell phone to call the University Police. Within moments, the University Police were at the Fence to report the crime. Aponte, a first-year in H&SS, described the incident as a reality check. He admitted to being naive about city robberies and the possibility of being mugged. He said he will be taking more care to be vigilant.
“This occurrence is a good lesson about avoiding walking around by oneself at night,” said Anna Goddard, a senior philosophy major and Mudge House community adviser. 
“It is indeed a wake-up call to many who believe that this type of event would never happen to them personally. Though our campus is very different from the University of Pittsburgh’s, it is still an urban campus.” Goddard acknowledged that Carnegie Mellon is relatively safe in general, but she stated that “if a person wanders around alone anywhere at 2:30 a.m., the chances of finding oneself in a compromising situation are unfortunately increased.”
University Police are assisting the Pittsburgh Bureau of Police in the investigation of this incident. Gary Scheimer of University Police, well recognized for his community and school education programming and expertise in criminal investigations, oversees the Special Services Division. 
When asked about Sunday’s incident, he said that University Police are also looking into a similar case, possibly linked to a robbery at the University of Pittsburgh about 10 days prior.
The Carnegie Mellon crime alert e-mail offered some crime prevention tips: avoid walking alone at night and use the university shuttle or escort service, as well as SafeWalk, when possible; if the suspect is after your valuables, do not resist or confront him or her — instead, try to avoid a violent confrontation and possible injury; and report any suspicious incidents, persons, or vehicles to University Police at (412) 268-2323.

At the end of every summer, Carnegie Mellon students return to a slightly altered campus: Construction projects have been started or completed, new policies and procedures have been put into place, and new students are exploring the grounds. One particular element of our campus, Greek life, experienced a multitude of changes.
Physically, the Greek quadrangle is unchanged. But two staple resident groups, the fraternities of Kappa Delta Rho and Theta Xi, are gone. 
Sisters from the sororities of Delta Delta Delta and Kappa Kappa Gamma have quickly filled the halls once belonging to Kappa Delta Rho and Theta Xi, respectively.
What resonated most with first-years and upperclassmen alike during last week’s Orientation festivities was an incorrect rumor floating around campus. 
That rumor insinuated that first-year students were explicitly banned from the Greek quadrangle during Orientation, a speculation that infuriated leaders in the Greek community and first-years as well.
Such a rule would “lower numbers on the Greek quad, and further make it harder for a fraternity to exist on Carnegie Mellon’s campus,” said Urvit Goel, the most recent president of Kappa Delta Rho, when asked how this potential ban might affect Greek life on campus. “It’s been tradition for [first-years] to get acquainted with Greek life during Orientation week.”
However, the rumor was based on a misinterpretation of an established rule that applies to all student organizations on campus. “None of that [the rumored ban] is true,” Director of Student Life Holly Hippensteel clarified to The Tartan. Student Life, Student Activities, and the rest of the organizers of Orientation week “just communicated an existing policy.... There is a university policy that all student organizations should only participate in Orientation through sanctioned Orientation activities.”
But were fraternities, which typically host alcohol-free parties that first-years can attend during Orientation, targeted specifically?
“Our expectation is that student organizations overall would follow the policy — this was not just a Greek thing,” Hippensteel explained.
Before Hippensteel and Student Life’s Coordinator of Greek Affairs Monica Bebie dispelled this rumor, however, much speculation floated around campus amid the university’s alleged reasons for supposedly disallowing first-years to visit the quadrangle during Orientation.
“I believe that the university’s [supposed] new policy that prevents first-years from going onto the frat quad is ill-advised,” said Lucian Cesca, president of the Student Dormitory Council. “From what I have heard, this policy has encouraged first-years to attend parties off campus, mainly at Pitt, rather than stay on campus.”
Rather than staying on campus to explore other social events, where they would have had protection under the amnesty program or Carnegie Mellon campus police, many first-years ventured off of the university’s grounds to look for parties. 
Added Cesca, whose student organization’s mission is to improve the quality of life of all students living in on-campus dormitories, “I feel that these risks could be more detrimental to the first-years’ Orientation than anything that could come from going to the frat quad.”
It is possible that fraternities were spooked by the removal of Kappa Delta Rho and Theta Xi into misinterpreting the university’s reiteration of this existing policy.
“Orientation is just supposed to be about Orientation, not parties. Fraternities and sororities aren’t supposed to be hosting [first-years],” Hippensteel added.
Several brothers of various fraternities on campus felt that, despite the rumored ban’s being false, all student organizations’ recruitment periods could be harmed by such strict rules imposed by Student Life and the organizers of Orientation week. “It is also a critical week for Greeks to recruit [potential] new members,” said Goel.
Several members of the Interfraternity Council (IFC), the self-governing body representing the on-campus fraternities, declined or were not available for comment to The Tartan. 
However, IFC Vice President of Community Relations Chris Niessl insisted that Greek life at Carnegie Mellon does indeed have a future. “I don’t feel like there’s a movement toward the overall squandering of Greek life, in particular, fraternity life on campus,” he said.
Hippensteel and Bebie echoed this sentiment. In fact, the university is “looking to expand” Greek life at Carnegie Mellon — “there are 76 other groups nationally that we’re going to look to” in the next two years, Bebie explained.
Hippensteel concluded, “Part of Orientation is knowing that there are these opportunities ... and that all starts once the semester starts.”
In next week’s issue of The Tartan, please look for a follow-up article on the removal of Kappa Delta Rho and Theta Xi from the quadrangle, the addition of Delta Delta Delta and Kappa Kappa Gamma to it, and more on the future of Greek life at Carnegie Mellon.

Smokers coming back to campus may be greeted with more than a hello from University Police if they are caught smoking outside one of the designated areas; they could be given a $25 fine for smoking or for littering their cigarette butts.
New and returning students have seen the signs scattered around the University Center’s Merson Courtyard, near the Cut, and other places on campus that warn of the consequences of smoking in a non-designated area. These signs are the manifestations of the changes in the university smoking policy that came about as part of the Healthy Campus 2010 program.
Healthy Campus 2010 is an initiative that examined potential strategies to improve the physical and emotional health of our campus community. It not only addressed tobacco use on campus but also discussed ways to create incentives for positive health behaviors and looked into options for healthy dining on campus.
“The [Healthy Campus 2010] Task Force examined the Carnegie Mellon environment and culture, the resources that currently exist, and the extent to which these resources meet the community’s needs,” stated Kelley Shell, a health promotion specialist at the university.
The changes to the smoking policy, which are now being fully enforced, are a product of the Healthy Campus 2010 initiative. After the designated smoking areas were announced to the campus community, a grace period was enacted where students caught smoking outside of the areas would be warned and told to extinguish their cigarettes, but not given any fine. The grace period, however, has now expired, and the final and permanent phase of the program has begun, in which students can expect to be fined if they are caught smoking in a non-designated area.
“While we do not anticipate having to rely on the use of fines, they are intended to deter people from smoking outside designated areas, as well as littering cigarette butts,” Shell stated.
Not all students share Shell’s belief that the fines will be able to keep violators from smoking outside of the designated areas.
“I don’t think the fines will really stop me from smoking. I’m still going to smoke on my way to class; I’m just going to hope that I don’t get caught,” said Simona Saracco, a junior materials science and engineering major.
In a statement sent out by Anita Barkin, the director of Student Health Services, and Madelyn Miller, director of Environmental Health and Safety, when the policy change was approved last November, they said, “While we realize that the new policy may inconvenience some smokers, it will help to make the campus a healthier place, and we hope it will encourage some smokers to quit.”
Along with the implementation of fines, the university is enacting other measures to help those who wish to stop smoking. Shell explained that Student Health Services offers a free support program as well as discounted nicotine replacement therapies for any student, staff, or faculty member interested in quitting smoking. In addition, the university is partnering with Mercy Behavioral Health to offer free group cessation programs on campus. An employee program will began on Aug. 21, and one for students is in the process of being planned as well.
Anyone interested in more information about the smoking policy can either visit [SLANT12]www.cmu.edu/smokinginfo[SLANT12] or send an e-mail with any questions to [SLANT 12]smoking-policy@andrew.cmu.edu[SLANT 12]. Those who would like to learn more about the smoking cessation program, or those who would like a friendly way to direct smokers to smoke only in the designated areas by picking up a supply of reminder cards, can e-mail Shell at [SLANT 12]kshell@andrew.cmu.edu[SLANT 12].

The Division of Student Affairs just gained its biggest student advocate. Karen Boyd, the department’s new dean, is committed to further improving relationships with students across campus.
Boyd has an optimistic view of the current state of student affairs at the school and sees her work as continual rather than dramatic changes.
“It’s not a need to fix, it’s a need to improve,” Boyd said.
Boyd applauded Carnegie Mellon for having one of the best academic and Student Affairs relationships that she has ever seen on a campus.  
Her extensive academic and work history allows her to draw such comparisons. In obtaining her bachelor's and master's degrees, and getting her start in student affairs, Boyd has had experiences at many campuses, including the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, Appalachian State University, Clemson University, Eastern Carolina University, and the Georgia Institute of Technology. After obtaining her bachelor's degree in industrial relations and economics with an emphasis on history at Chapel Hill, Boyd graduated and entered the workforce in the middle of the country’s other most recent recession.
“I can definitely understand where graduating students are coming from,” she said.
She is currently working long-distance on her Ph.D. dissertation at the University of Georgia. 
Just as Boyd spent her academic career in the South, she also spent her childhood there. She was born in North Carolina. With a father in the military who worked on the first generation of military and portable computers, and a mother as a music educator, Boyd said that she feels a unique bond to Carnegie Mellon and its fusion of such subjects. 
“It’s like I’m going to old familial stomping grounds,” she said.
Boyd expanded on her love for the campus, citing a number of characteristics.
“The type of student that comes here is different and thinks in a certain way,” she said. 
Boyd called the school an “incubator” that stimulates these students, empowers them in identifying how they can overcome challenges, and teaches them how to take and manage risks.
“It would be one thing if things were broken,” Boyd said. “My biggest challenge is to figure out how I can assist.” 
Boyd hopes to assist in bringing people together who might not have found each other, and in developing a strategic plan for the role of student affairs. 
Boyd said that in recent communications with the public, she was stunned to hear that people had never heard of the university. 
“That’s also one of my goals: Sharing the Carnegie Mellon secret more,” she said. 
Boyd had always heard of the school from her father, yet had never visited the school nor lived near Pittsburgh. 
When Boyd first came to campus, she took a student-led tour and was impressed by the interesting architecture. Living here now, she is also impressed by the city that surrounds her.
“I am pleasantly surprised by Pittsburgh,” she said. “I knew that it was making a serious turnaround, but I had no idea just what a pleasant and fun city it was.” 
Boyd said that what excites her the most about her job are the possibilities. 
“It’s awe-inspiring at times,” she said. “They give you so much more than you expected.”
Boyd hopes to get to know not only the university staff but the students as well. She hopes to host Tartan Teas at her home, in which she will have the chance to get to know the students that make up the campus. 
“Students can do anything if we do our part to help them,” she said.
Boyd looks to the future with a optimistic view for student relationships.
“I have the luxury of figuring out the next generation instead of creating the first,” she said. “My job is really in convening discussion. There’ s a lot of smart people here and that’s really all I’m doing.”
Boyd is a firm believer in the famous quote by Emily Dickinson, “I dwell in possibilities.” She hopes to bring this attitude to campus.

There are 477 dead in the U.S.; 7511 hospitalized; 51 states and territories affected. The World Health Organization (WHO) declared the situation an official pandemic in June. 
Even first-year orientation has been altered in response to the growing concern. What’s got health officials shaky? Swine flu. H1N1. The piggy flu.
The H1N1 influenza virus is the predominant influenza virus in circulation worldwide according to the Centers for Disease and Control (CDC). Carnegie Mellon’s Student Health Services has already seen documented cases of H1N1. What’s more terrifying? H1N1 is looking for you, the student between the ages of 5 and 24 years old. 
According to the CDC, a theory for why this new virus attacks the younger generation is that older adults may carry forms of immunity while younger individuals may not carry antibodies to combat H1N1. The virus is spread through human-to-human contact and H1N1-contaminated surfaces.
“Playfair was changed. There was less hand contact and students were not encouraged to shake hands at the ending portion,” said Torrey Brenner, an orientation counselor and a sophomore in the cognitive sciences department. “But I’m not really concerned. The quarantine of infected students makes me feel safe.”
Anita Barkin, director of the Carnegie Mellon Student Health Services, stated, “The issue is of high importance but exhibits light activity within the Carnegie Mellon community.” 
The American College Health Association (ACHA) drives most of the regulations for H1N1 prevention at universities like Carnegie Mellon while keeping an active dialogue with the Coalition for Emerging Public Health Threats and Emergency Response, for which Barkin serves as chairwoman. “There are two critical steps we’re taking. (A) Placing emphasis on the ‘vulnerable population’ with pre-existing conditions such as asthma or immune disorders. And (B) ensuring isolation of infected individuals to decrease the surge of new cases.”
The search for an H1N1 vaccine is underway at 11 sites across nine states. However, just clinical trials proceed while the general public must wait. “Only individuals diagnosed with influenza and those with serious underlying conditions should take Tamiflu and Relenza to prevent a shortage of supplies,” said Barkin. “Indiscriminate usage of these medications can also cause a prudent resistance amongst the population.”
While students enjoy the nice weather and greenery, H1N1 is just a moderate threat. Nonetheless, the upcoming winter months will drive students inside to keep in close quarters and may spur an increase in H1N1 infections.

Title: Pitt Business G-20 World Tour
The Basics: On each of the 20 days preceding the summit, beginning Wednesday, Aug. 26, the Joseph M. Katz Graduate School of Business and College of Business Administration University of Pittsburgh will feature a different G-20 country with presentations on the cultural and economic aspects of that country. 
For more information, please visit the website http://www.business.pitt.edu/g20/ 
When: Beginning Wednesday, Aug. 26 
Where: Lobbies of Mervis Hall and Sennott Square, University of Pittsburgh
Title: University Lecture Series — Great Decisions: Cuba after Castro
The Basics: This Great Decisions lecture is part of the Passport to Global Awareness course and will be webcast by the World Affairs Council. The lecture will discuss the challenges and opportunities in reopening ties with Cuba. 
Since Fidel Castro handed over the presidency of Cuba to Raúl Castro in early 2008, there have been mixed messages of change and keeping the status quo in terms of U.S.–Cuban relations. 
The lecture will question if Raúl seeks to reopen ties with the U.S. and what role Cuban-Americans will play in shaping a post-Castro Cuba. For more information on Great Decisions 2009, please visit the World Affairs Council of Pittsburgh website. 
When:Wednesday, Sept. 9, 6–8 p.m. 
Where: Gregg Hall (Porter 100)
Title: University Lecture Series — Global Warming: Doing what the planet needs in Washington, Copenhagen, Pittsburgh, and tropical forests 
The Basics: Doug Boucher will discuss the importance of the next four months in terms of taking action on global warming around the world. 
Washington has the Senate debating on the House-passed energy and climate bill, and Copenhagen is in negotiations for a new treaty to make drastic reductions in greenhouse gases. 
Boucher believes the G-20 meeting in Pittsburgh on Sept. 24–25 is key for both these events, since it is where President Obama and the leaders of the world’s largest economies could make a commitment to making the necessary investments to avoid the worst consequences of climate change. 
Boucher will explain why part of this commitment needs to be reducing tropical deforestation, which is responsible for about 20 percent of global warming pollution. 
The presentation will also weigh the balance of forces and the political dynamics that could lead to historic steps on climate change in the next few months — or to a failure to act that would have drastic consequences for the planet.
Doug Boucher joined the Union of Concerned Scientists (UCS) in July 2007 as director of its Tropical Forests and Climate Initiative. 
He is in charge of UCS’s work in the United States and in the international climate change negotiations, on tropical deforestation and its role in climate change. He is based in UCS’s Washington office.
He has published widely on ecology and forest management issues, most recently in Ecology, Science, Plant Ecology, Forest Ecology and Management, and the Bulletin of the Ecological Society of America. Boucher has a Ph.D. in ecology and evolutionary biology from the University of Michigan and a B.A. in ecology and history from Yale University.
When: Thursday, Sept. 10, 4:30 p.m. 
Where: Breed Hall (Margaret Morrison Carnegie Hall 103)

As college students, we all like to complain about money; namely, not having enough of it. Not only do we have a high cost of tuition, but we also have to pay for additional school-related costs, one of the most expensive of which is our textbooks.
Some people may get lucky and be able to buy their books from used books sites online, or from other friends, which are generally much cheaper options; while other people (like me) may end up having to buy new copies from the bookstore, paying close to $300 for books for one class alone.
And after the class is over, how many times do students even crack open that book again? While I would agree that some books remain useful after the semester has finished, many books, especially those for general education classes or electives, will never again be used. Try as you might to sell them back to the bookstore, you will likely receive merely pennies of the original cost you paid for the books only a few months earlier.
It is this situation that has prompted a growing number of companies to begin renting out textbooks, an idea that may seem logical and obvious but has never before been introduced. These companies allow people to rent textbooks for different periods of time — generally, either a semester or a year — for a small percentage of the full cost, and then decide if, at the end of the rental period, they would like to simply return the book or keep it and pay the remaining cost. Some of the rental companies even send you an online version of the first chapter to view immediately until the textbook reaches you.
To me, it is an idea that makes perfect sense. I mean, there are libraries where we can rent other, non-textbook books for a shorter period of time, and there are places like Blockbuster, Family Video, or Redbox where we can rent movies or television series to watch so that we don’t have to actually buy them. So why not rent textbooks as well?
People like the idea of renting before purchasing mainly because they like the ease and comfort of finding out if they like something, or if they think it will be useful, before they spend more money on it. This is even more true with college students and textbooks: Not only are textbooks exorbitantly expensive, but college students are more stingy with their money than most — hey, we need to have some money left for the weekends!
In many cases, professors assign a textbook but end up only referencing it once or twice, or only assigning homework problems from it, and instead provide their own notes, often more detailed and more applicable than the book anyway.
Another argument in support of purchasing your books is that you then can keep them forever and easily reference them any time in the future, either in your education or your career. But for students who are taking general education classes simply to fill up the required open slots, it is highly unlikely that they will ever need to reference the book in the future.
In addition, with the growing amount of material on the Internet, it is also very unlikely that students will need to find something in a book that they couldn’t find elsewhere online. I know that when I took a psychology class over the summer, Wikipedia was just about as helpful as the book itself in explaining different psychological theories and studies. And many professors from a number of universities actually post their class notes online, which can be found by a quick Google search.
Textbooks are no longer the only source of information about a subject, and they are not even necessarily the easiest way to find that information, either. Thus, if textbooks are no longer as useful as they used to be, at least after a class is over, why are they something that should continue to be held on to?
And even when textbooks were the easiest way to look up information about a certain subject, how often are those books actually referenced? My parents have boxes of old schoolbooks in our basement that are never looked at other than the occasional times we pull them out to laugh at the notes my parents made in the margins. Because textbooks can’t update themselves as the Internet can, the information quickly becomes outdated and irrelevant, anyway. 
So renting textbooks with the option to purchase them later as well seems like the perfect solution.
For those classes where the book is barely ever used, you get to pay a fraction of even the used-book cost and clear up space in your tiny room when the class is finished. Even in this worst-case scenario, you’re still paying less than you would to buy the book. If you did get a lot of use out of the book but don’t think that you’ll ever use it in the future, you’ll at least feel like your rental fee was justified. And if you use the book a lot and think it would be useful to you in future classes, you can just decide to buy it when your time is up, without having to decide before the class even starts if the book will be helpful or not.
I appreciate that by renting out textbooks, companies are looking out not only for their own interests, but for the interests of students as well, by providing a service that is beneficial to both sides.

Though newspapers and editorials have feasted upon the sad story of Michael Vick, his animal abuse, and whether his apology is genuine, it seems as though those authors clamoring for the public to accept his apology and let the guy play his season out seem to be overlooking a few key points.
First, authors supporting Vick’s return argue that though football fans and animal activists are entitled to some genuine outrage at Vick’s actions, there is no reason to bar him from playing football or make his case into a scandal. Other athletes haven’t been skewered by the media half so much for their indiscretions, especially those involving spousal abuse. If they aren’t getting as much media scrutiny for their graver offenses, then what right do people have to prey on Vick?
It appears that these authors skate over the fact that Vick, as well as other players, have committed serious crimes. In my book, justice deserves to be meted out both to those who were hurt by and those who committed that crime. If other athletes aren’t being hounded as much as Vick about their pasts, then maybe it’s time that they should be. People who are famous, whether for being an athlete, a movie star, or just for being well-known, ought to be treated the same as anyone else in the eyes of the law.
Maybe if we started to hold our athletes and idols to a higher standard, then they wouldn’t commit the crimes in the first place. If abusing a wife, child, or animal meant losing your spot on the team, no matter how much of a skilled player you were, then that might have some serious effects on how these players conduct themselves.
However, the suggestion that the public drop the issue of Michael Vick just because other abuse cases haven’t gotten the same press coverage is just ludicrous. People should be paying more attention to the transgressions of those in the limelight, not less.
A second point common to these editorials is the view that Vick has served his time, made his apology, and ought to be left alone. I disagree. When you have committed an abuse like that, either ending in the bodily or emotional harm or death of another being, then you really ought to be reminded of it all the time. It shouldn’t be an easy thing to live with taking the life of another creature, whether it’s a dog, cat, or human.
Vick does not deserve to be spared any of the spotlight; he should not be allowed to forget what he’s done, and neither should the public. Sports stars are put on high pedestals and admired, and they need to know that they don’t get special treatment just because they can play the game well.
Last, these authors appeal to their audience’s idealism, stating that Vick, though he has done wrong, has shown enough remorse and ought to be given a second chance. They also point to his efforts with the Humane Society as proof of his contrition and well-meaning.
But, this leads me to ask: what qualifies as “enough” remorse? A quick Internet search of Michael Vick will show various studies, some more legitimate than others, claiming to have figured out what percentage of “truth” or “remorse” was in Vick’s apology. Is remorse really something that’s measurable and absolute, or is it subjective for each person? If someone tells us that a man’s remorse has passed the pivotal point of believability, are we to trust them or draw our own conclusions?
Michael Vick has also had a swarm of image-saving publicists at his beck and call, to help him get out of his sticky legal situation without setting off a conflagration of fan outrage. This should set off alarm bells for those seeking to know if he’s telling the truth. If someone else has to tell you what the words coming from the bottom of your heart are, then chances are you weren’t very remorseful in the first place.
And to those saying that he deserves a second chance, I say that those six dogs he killed deserve a second chance, too. Dogs and cats — pets of all kinds — are capable of loving a human unconditionally. They often end up trusting completely those that look after them, not out of necessity, but out of love. It’s rare that love is so freely given (as anyone trying to find it knows), and to hurt or kill something that loves you just for feeding it or scratching behind its ears every now and then goes against every tenet of respect and affection we, as people, have been taught. Vick can feed as many homeless dogs as he likes; he can donate as many thousands of dollars to shelters as he wishes, but the fact remains that he has acted against something powerless and defenseless, just because it “underperformed.”
Michael Vick should not be allowed to return to football, where he’ll make millions this year and soon forget about those animals he murdered. He should not be allowed to have a pampered life, living in an expensive house and pursued by fans clamoring for an autograph.
No, Vick should make reparations for what he’s done. The course of his life should be altered as much as those of the dogs he killed: he shouldn’t be allowed to play football, get paid millions, and live the high life. Instead, he should be made to pay for his crimes.

In most areas of life, I am a snob. I listen to classical music on Deutsche Grammophon and other such labels, own two Burberry purses, and drink only the highest-quality tea picked from foreign fields. But when it comes to airlines and flying, I proudly admit to being your run-of-the-mill, average-Joe commoner.
I don’t believe in luxury air travel. I dutifully sit in coach with my overstuffed carry-on taking up any leg space, sandwiched between your average back-to-school college kid and Midwestern mother of three going to visit her sister. I scoff at the wrinkled old ladies and businessmen who sit in first class, whose ugly Louis Vuitton purses and company per diem, respectively, could feed small towns. They fan themselves in annoyance and yabber on their iPhones because they can. They usually get their own flight attendant who definitively pulls the curtain separating first class and coach, as if to say, “Yes, we do have class divisions in society. And I have to fetch wine and hot towels for these idiots who paid a whole hell of a lot more to go to the same place.”
First class isn’t all that great. I could tell already by shuffling past the suit-wearing sky VIPs as I headed to my lowly seat in coach, but just to be sure, I looked on American Airlines’ website to see what it all entailed. Domestic first class, it proudly states, offers perks such as the exclusive Bose QuietComfort acoustic noise canceling headphones. Which is really useful considering how the low hum of the engine drowns out all the tuba solos I listen to on planes all the time.
It also offers a six-way adjustable leather headrest, which was probably installed after a consultation with a chiropractor. Said chiropractor probably suggested to AA that there is only one way to sleep on a plane: awkwardly and with one’s mouth agape. So it’s only logical to install something fancy-sounding and dysfunctional, but sounding like it could provide quality cervical and thoracic support.
It threw “additional leg room” in there, although we know that’s a given. To my knowledge, I don’t think there’s an academic paper on the relationship between length of posterior extremities and tendency to order first-class tickets. Not a huge deciding factor.
One thing that is actually legitimate is that first-class customers get priority at check-in. Which would be really helpful in a time crunch since I do not have my own personal chauffeur and have to rely on public transportation to get to the airport. But these first-class divas and divos probably do. So there’s a catch-22 for you.
In the end, VIP air travel is mostly just a marketing executive’s ability to make unnecessary nothingness look really good to you. So they can charge you more to feel superior. So airlines can further ingratiate class distinctions in society. So they can give you a hot towel pre-flight to wipe from your brow the filth of the huddled, unwashed masses in coach behind you. No thanks. I’m sticking with my Lipton green tea and C-list orchestra.

It’s 2 a.m., and every bar, club, and restaurant in Pittsburgh is closing its doors. Cue the Loop Bus. Implemented as a trial run last semester, the Loop Bus was one of Carnegie Mellon’s most ingenious ideas.
Running on Fridays and Saturdays from 7 p.m. to that last 2 a.m. pickup, the Loop Bus takes students back and forth from the University Center turnaround to seven conveniently located Pittsburgh locations, including stops on Fifth and Forbes Avenues, and throughout Station Square and the SouthSide Works. It runs hourly from 7 to 9 and half-hourly from 10:30 to 1:30 from the University Center, is free for all Carnegie Mellon students, and even allows each student one non-student guest.
Its most popular run, no doubt, is that last 2 a.m. pickup throughout the South Side and Station Square. As a late-night rider, you will often see the same exact students that you left on the bus with earlier that evening. The bus is almost always filled to the door with even standing room cramped. Add to this cramped scene the sound of students sporadically singing loudly and in groups and taking bus seat pictures that they will most likely laugh at later. It all makes for an amusing ride, to say the least. The intense concentration of people on the Loop Bus ensures that you will always see someone you know, whether from a different Greek house, student organization, or someone you just had never expected to see.
Each weekend, the Loop Bus has a different most popular location, as its student population makes it a clear reflector of student culture. When the Penguins were fighting for the Stanley Cup, it made its most frequent stops to the sports bars on the SouthSide. At the end of the semester with celebrations of the end of exams, it added the new SouthSide restaurant Hofbrauhaus to its list.
All silliness of the Loop Bus aside, the bus was the brainchild of former student body president and vice president Jared Itkowitz and Pooja Godbole. Its intention was to allow students to explore other Pittsburgh neighborhoods, something it has definitely accomplished as evidenced by the droves of people who ride the bus every weekend night. The bus also succeeded in significantly increasing the safety of students coming back home from a night out on the town. There is no longer a need to assign a designated driver, to get lost on the long walk back, or to wait outside for long periods of time for a taxi to come by. This may mean a decrease in profits for Yellow Cab and DDLimos, but it is definitely a plus for Carnegie Mellon students. The only thing that you need to do is follow the undoubtedly familiar crowds to the nearest corner bus stop and pull out your student ID.
Student government should be applauded for recognizing this student need and allowing students to more easily take a break from campus without any worries of how to get back home. The bus, modeled off Port Authority’s former UV Loop and Duquesne University’s SGA Loop, is likely to become a Carnegie Mellon tradition. Its trial run last spring did not even last two full months. Yet the pictures taken, songs chanted, and unexpected late-night encounters, as well as nights made just that much easier, all because of the Loop Bus, are already treasured by the faction of campus that has experienced its magic.

As upperclassmen may notice now that they have returned to campus, the University Center has gone through a number of changes over the summer. New food vendors mean new kiosks in the second- floor dining area, and the touchscreen information screens that were mounted on the wall next to the Information Desk have been removed. But the change that disappoints us is the changing of the UC Art Gallery into a conference room.
While we understand that conference rooms are a necessity on any university’s campus, especially a growing one like Carnegie Mellon’s, we are upset that the addition of a conference room had to come at the expense of one of the few art galleries on campus.
Space for students to display their work on campus is always limited, especially for non-senior art students as well as those students who are not majoring in art. In addition, the UC Gallery was located in a common area for all of the campus community, allowing students to have their work seen by a diverse group of people who may never make it to the more out-of-the-way and less student  work-focused Regina Gouger Miller Gallery in Purnell.
A number of rooms already exist in the UC that could be used for meetings, in addition to numerous conference rooms already scattered in other academic buildings on campus. But creative spaces for students to show their work are not available in many locations over the campus, and by getting rid of the gallery in the UC, the university is limiting the available spaces for art even more.
The removal of the UC Art Gallery is also strengthening the already-existing divisions between students of different majors by sectioning off any creative displays in Purnell and not allowing the rest of the campus to be easily exposed to them.
We hope that the university will help students continue to find places on campus to display their work, and that it will not get rid of any more creative spaces on campus, no matter how important the university may think its need for conference rooms is.

On Friday, June 12, over 25 million Iranians cast their votes in their country’s 10th presidential election. The next morning, the Islamic Republic News Agency announced the results with over 60 percent of the vote going to the incumbent, President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad. The leading opposition candidate, Mir Hossein Mousavi, immediately warned Iranian citizens of possible election fraud, and his supporters began protesting.
Hundreds of thousands of people protested in Iran for the remainder of June and into July; unfortunately, the international media was not there to capture the protests, having been forcibly exiled from the country or confined to their hotel rooms. Protesters used Facebook to organize gatherings, YouTube to post videos of rallies and of the police brutality that took place, and Twitter to post information related to the election. And it was this use of the Internet and social networking that the Western media reported on, covering videos such as the widely spread and highly graphic video of Neda Soltan being shot and killed, and covering specific Tweets to provide updates on what was occurring on the ground.
We applaud the citizen journalism that blossomed in Iran out of people’s desire to bring to the international stage the aftermath of the country’s supposedly democratic elections. The power of Facebook, YouTube, and Twitter is truly realized in situations like these, in which the information is so important and so compelling that it travels across the globe despite a single government’s efforts to shut it down.
Now, two months later, the protests have nearly all ended, and most people have returned home, although some 135 people remain on trial. The result of the election as it was first announced has not changed. The world has seen that the people of Iran are capable of some of the largest and most spirited political protests of this decade.
Perhaps most importantly, we have seen that through modern technologies people will make their voices heard, something we might see again very soon, as neighboring nation Afghanistan held its elections last Wednesday, with a similar media blackout in place.
We hope that if the media blackout in Afghanistan does remain in place after the election, a similar outpouring of citizen journalism is seen, so that the rest of the world can stay informed of the happenings of the country and the results of the election.

On Sept. 24, Pittsburgh will open its arms to host the 2009 G20 Summit. The city will usher in delegates from 19 of the world’s largest economies, plus the European Union, to evaluate the aftermath of the G20 in London last April. As Pittsburgh welcomes stimulating economic discussion on behalf of the citizens of the world, the people of Pittsburgh are being silenced as many organized protesters have had their permits denied by Mayor Luke Ravenstahl’s office.
People who wish to voice their opinions on varying issues such as climate change, jobs, welfare, religion, war, and disease are facing complications as they apply for permits to protest peacefully.
The London G20 Summit brought over 20,000 protesters into the city who were able to somewhat peacefully get their messages across to the media and to government officials, although there certainly was some destruction that should not have occurred.
The summit is a chance for Steeler Country to show the world that there is more to Pittsburghers than rioting after a football win. We understand the mayor’s concern for safety, but we adamantly feel that the residents of Pittsburgh shouldn’t be denied their Constitutional right to protest, especially at such an important event. Though the mayor has currently designated an area for protesters to share with a police detail in Point Park, one day of protesting is not enough when protesting ideas of such magnitude. 
In order to protect the visiting officials, over 3000 officers have been designated to police the streets, yet even with the additional support, the city remains overly cautious about protecting its visitors while also silencing the voices of its people. Over 40 groups have become so frustrated from permit denials that they have organized to speak to the members of City Council before the summit.
We sincerely hope that in the face of such global disparity, Pittsburgh — and vicariously, America — does not lose its integral support of the freedoms of speech and petition.
We’d like to see what Pittsburgh citizens can do — peacefully — in the streets of this city when motivated by economic depression and unrest as opposed to a Super Bowl win.

As your Student Body Vice President, I would like to welcome both returning students and first-year students alike to another splendid year at Carnegie Mellon. As you embark on your studies and explore the many extracurriculars that Carnegie Mellon has to offer, it is important to remember that your Student Government representatives are here to help you and improve your experience whenever necessary.
Rotimi and I have been working diligently this summer to set the framework for our for the coming year’s initiatives and to ensure that the school year gets started on the right foot.
This year, we envision a Student Government that will keep you connected with your representatives, aim to aid you with the stresses of the current economic situation, and, of course, establish a new order and tradition of school pride in our students. Indeed, we hope that you will take full advantage of all the initiatives that we have planned this year.
On behalf of your Student Government, I would like to welcome all students into a new era of transparency and accountability. This year, Rotimi and I will stay connected with you using a variety of web-based technologies, including the Mad Minute, which will be a short clip of Rotimi and I updating you about Student Government on our website, and our Twitter account. Please follow us on Twitter at AK2010cmuStuGov. In addition, we hope that you will provide Rotimi and me with constant feedback, either by e-mailing us or coming to our office hours, which will be announced soon.
In a continuation of our initiatives to boost Carnegie Mellon spirit, Rotimi and I are bringing you the Tartan Rewards Program, which will honor students who attend various athletic events on campus. In essence, the program will reward you for being a loyal fan and dedicated Tartan. With a little more work and planning, this program will extend to events related to the fine arts and beyond!
Thanks to the support of the Athletic Department, the Career Center, and Carnegie Clan, we hope to bring you a number of exciting events this year and tons of free prizes and food.
The first Tartan Rewards event kicks off with the first football game of the season on Sept. 5 at 1 p.m. in Gesling Stadium. As the Orientation Reunion, this event will be a chance for first-years to relive the experience of Orientation while also cheering for the Tartan football team. I encourage all of you attend this inaugural event.
Until then, enjoy the first week of classes!
