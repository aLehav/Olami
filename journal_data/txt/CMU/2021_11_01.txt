There’s no other way to put it: Week 9 lived up to all the hype. In the first week of the massive Big Ten games, Michigan State continued their climb up the rankings, beating Michigan, who tumbled out of the Top Ten. Ohio State continued their roll to the playoffs and cemented the #3 spot by knocking off Penn State, handing the Nittany Lions their third consecutive loss.
In East Lansing, the name of the game was turnovers. Michigan took a 30-14 lead, but first-year quarterback JJ McCarthy fumbled twice to allow the Spartans to claw back for a 37-33 win. In Columbus, Penn State and Ohio State traded scores all night long, but at the end of the day, it was a tale of two field goals — Noah Ruggles barely hit a 27-yarder for Ohio State and Jordan Stout missed a 49-yarder to seal the Buckeyes’ 33-24 win over Penn State.
This week’s rankings:
Alabama, at #2, had a bye week, but with only four games to go — and only one against a ranked opponent, #18 Auburn — the Crimson Tide appear to be barreling right for an SEC Championship matchup against #1 Georgia. The only thing holding Alabama’s chances back is their one loss, picked up at Texas A&M. Tied in the division standings with both Ole Miss and Auburn, a loss would stick them with two conference losses. This could be a deal breaker, taking them out of the championship game and out of the playoff hunt. That said, if they win out, Alabama should be fine.
Next is #4 Michigan State, who flew up the rankings after edging out #8 Michigan, 37-33, in an instant-classic game. The 8-0 Spartans now lead the Big Ten East and, against all the odds, a game between Michigan State and Ohio State in Week 12 looks like it could be decisive. The Spartans, playing in the hardest division in college football, finally have a big win to show that they are for real.
While the top four now form a relatively obvious top tier, a second tier has formed below it, ready to jump in if one of the teams in the top four takes a loss. #5 Cincinnati and #6 Oklahoma, still undefeated, sit right under MSU, but with too many close wins and no strong victories between them; #7 Oregon is still going steady after their loss to Stanford, but not good enough to overcome it; #8 Michigan dipped in the rankings after the Michigan State loss; #9 Wake Forest crushed Duke 45-7 to give the ACC a representative in the Top Ten for the first time since Clemson fell out early in the season; and #10 Auburn knocked off Ole Miss to return to the Top Ten.
Next Week
#1 Georgia vs. Missouri
 #2 Alabama vs. Louisiana State
 #3 Ohio State at Nebraska
 #4 Michigan State vs. Purdue
 #5 Cincinnati at Tulsa
 #6 Oklahoma - Bye
 #7 Oregon at Washington
 #8 Michigan vs. Indiana
 #9 Wake Forest at UNC
 #10 Auburn at Texas A&M
No Top Ten teams play ranked opponents next week, so Week 10 should be a bit of a down week. Expect the Top Ten to run the board, or close to it, next week, and for Week 11 to bring more upsets.
The playoff picture, though, is beginning to come into view after the first day of Big Ten East juggernauts playing each other. After Michigan State’s home win over Michigan, and Ohio State holding off Penn State in a thriller, the Buckeyes and Spartans are looking like playoff contenders, while Michigan, with one conference loss, is in a harder spot. Penn State, with three conference losses, is basically out. Over in the SEC, Alabama and Georgia have both been playing great football, and no matter which team ultimately prevails in the SEC Championship, both could end up in the playoffs. As of now, although Cincinnati and Oklahoma maintain a good shot, the top four have sorted themselves out.

As the UEFA Champions League (UCL) enters the latter half of its matchdays, teams across Europe are vying for qualifying positions for the round of 16. Ahead of Matchday 4, an update on each team’s position:
Group A
PSG is sitting on top of Group A as the only team in the group that has not suffered a loss yet. Their position is not yet solidified, however, and Messi and co. will be looking to change that on Matchday 4. Any result that is not a loss in their next three UCL matches will likely see PSG through to the Round of 16 — one more win guarantees PSG a spot in the top two, as would two draws. Manchester City, on the other hand, is eyeing the top spot and will be trying to knock PSG off their perch. Club Brugge is the underdog in this group, but while a round of 16 is unlikely for the Belgian side, they’re not completely out of the picture yet. In contrast, Leipzig, who has suffered three consecutive losses, may very well find both UCL and UEL hopes dashed at the end of the group stage.
Group B
Liverpool needs just one more win to guarantee themselves a spot in the knockout stage, and from how they have been playing, their chances of progression seem more likely than not. Five points clear of Atlético Madrid and Porto, Liverpool are in a fine position going into Matchday 4. In contrast, there will be stiff competition between the former two as they fight for the last UCL spot. Unfortunately for AC Milan, they are in a position much like Leipzig — while it is not impossible for their European competition hopes to come to fruition, it seems highly unlikely for the Italians to go anywhere but home in December.
Group C
Group C has formed a clear hierarchy, with three points separating each of the four teams. Should Ajax keep up the momentum and field a win on Matchday 4, they will have a clear shot at progressing to the knockout stage. Likewise, if Dortmund keeps playing relatively well, their chances of moving on to the round of 16 are optimistic. Sporting, firmly in the Europa League relegation position, will be looking to move up the table while holding off bottom-of-the-table Beşiktaş, the latter of which will be trying to garner any amount of points to stay in European competition. Three points is not a large margin, however, and it would not be surprising to see the rankings shift in the last three matchdays.
Group D
Group D is the group to watch. With five points separating the top and bottom of the table, it’s still very much anyone’s game. Darkhorse Sheriff Tiraspol blew away expectations in the first two weeks, but a loss on Matchday 3 puts them on equal footing points-wise with Real Madrid, who recorded a shock loss on Matchday 1 against Sheriff but has managed to win on both matchdays since then. Inter Milan, two points behind the leaders, has a chance to make it into the round of 16 if they can beat either Sheriff or Real. As for Shakhtar Donetsk, they will be trying their best not to drop any more points should they wish to remain in the European competition.
Group E
Bayern Munich is still sitting comfortably at the top of Group E, and are almost guaranteed to progress to the round of 16 — the only way Bayern will miss out is if they lose all three of their upcoming matches, Benfica and Barcelona both win against Dynamo Kyiv, and Barcelona wins against Benfica. One more win will solidify their position, and Bayern will be hunting for it on Matchday 4. Benfica and Barcelona will be fighting over the remaining UCL spot in the weeks to come, as Kyiv fights for a shot at the Europa League. With just three points separating second and last, there could be plenty of excitement yet to come in Group E.
Group F
After a Matchday 1 loss, Manchester United has turned it around, winning both subsequent matchdays to claim a spot at the top of the table. However, with three points separating the top and bottom, the table is by no means solidified. All four teams still have a shot at Champions League glory, and the upcoming matchdays will be critical in deciding who progresses onwards, who is relegated to the UEL, and who will be going home.
Group G
Salzburg is doing well in Group G, sitting at the top of the table, four points clear of second-placed Sevilla. The rest of Group G is not nearly as comfortable, with there being only a one-point margin between Sevilla, Lille, and Wolfsburg. Nobody is even close to being guaranteed to go home in December, and the table will likely shift as all four teams attempt to improve and solidify their position.
Group H
Group H looks much like Group C in terms of points, with Juventus sitting at the top of the table, three points clear of Chelsea, who in turn is three points clear of Zenit St. Petersburg, who is three points clear of Malmö. Overall, Juventus has dominated Group H, and another matchday keeping that up will guarantee the Old Lady a spot in the UCL knockout stage. Chelsea, having dropped points to Juve, will be looking to make them up, while Zenit will be fighting to move up the table while holding Malmö at bay. For Malmö, it seems unlikely they will be progressing to the round of 16, but a Europa League spot is not completely out of the question yet.

A national effort to slow down aging by looking at each cell
As cells age and get damaged, they can stop replicating and cause inflammation, which, in turn, causes other cells to get damaged as well. These cells are called senescent cells, and have been linked to a variety of age-related conditions such as cancer, diabetes, Alzheimer's disease, stroke, and others. Scientists are hoping to find ways to clear senescent cells in order to prevent these conditions. Carnegie Mellon researchers are joining the $125 million national effort from the National Institute of Health to understand senescence and possible solutions. They will be primarily developing SenNet, a program in which they will generate data to feed a "navigable, 3D map of the body that offers data and analysis on cellular aging."
Innovation in farm animal tracking technology
Animals tend to be raised in large herds on large stretches of land for efficiency, but it makes it hard for farmers to track each individual animal's location and health. Ear tags developed by Carnegie Mellon WiTech Lab's Swarun Kumar, associate professor of engineering, can track biometrics, location, and acceleration of animals using solar energy and low-power, wide-area networking (LP-WAN). LP-WAN enables data to be transmitted across long distances using less energy than alternatives, which is useful across the long distances that animals can travel across a pasture.
Looking at brains of physics professors
Have you ever wondered what's going on in the head of your physics professor? Robert Mason, senior research associate, Reinhard Schumacher, professor of physics, and Marcel Just, the D.O. Hebb University Professor of Psychology, conducted research to get you closer to finding out the answer. Their study found that the brain activity of physics faculty when processing physics concepts was remarkably similar to each other, categorizing concepts as measurable (like velocity) and immeasurable (like dark matter), and using the part of the brain that recognizes rhythm in dance and music to understand periodic concepts such as oscillation.
Facebook announces new name: Meta
Last week, Facebook announced it would rename itself in order to fit its vision of building a metaverse but did not reveal the name. On Oct. 28, the company announced that the name would be Meta. In a virtual event, it depicted this envisioned metaverse as being able to allow consumers to be transported to different virtual worlds, such as workplaces, concerts, and hangouts with friends and family.
Facebook seems to have a number of motives for this rebrand. For one, the announcement comes at a time when the company is facing heavy accusations from whistleblowers on prioritizing profits over the mental health and digital safety of their consumers. The idea of the metaverse also allows Facebook to be less dependent on Google and Apple, whose platforms Facebook usually has to host their apps on, and also can potentially allow them to appeal to a younger audience, another old sore spot of theirs.
iPhone adds feature to store COVID-19 vaccination card to Apple Wallet
iPhone users can now more safely digitize their COVID-19 vaccination cards to their phone using Apple Wallet. Android users can use Google Pay and Samsung users can use Samsung Pay to do the same. 
Donald Trump's new social media app facing troubles
Oct. 20, hours after former President Donald Trump announced the creation of his yet-to-be-released Twitter-like social media app, Truth Social, hackers managed to get access to a private version of the network, posting memes and "expletive-laced rants," showing the lax security of the application. In addition, it was found that the code for Truth Social was taken from Mastodon, an open-source media framework that requires published creations based on Mastodon's code to make their own code open-source too. Truth Social's code is decidedly not open-source, and they could be sued by Mastodon if they do not make their code public within a month.

Nothing is better than gulping down a warm bowl of udon noodles or hearing the crisp sound of biting into a sushi roll. Homely and classy food fuse together at Mola, a sushi restaurant located on Penn Ave. As you enter Mola, you are greeted by a modern-looking restaurant with a view into the kitchen where the owners Alex Tang and Mimi Lee work. Alex was inspired to cook by his mother and grandmother and began creating nontraditional dishes catered to an American audience. His partner, Mimi Lee, managed her own breakfast shop for over 10 years and shares a similar interest in cooking. Together, their passion and 20-year-long dream led to Mola — a fresh, authentic, and unique Japanese restaurant of their own. On the walls just above the kitchen, the sketch of a giant black and white fish looms over the restaurant watching customers eat, perhaps making sure that they are eating well. On the walls, there are other smaller, more colorful paintings of fishes adding a playful touch to an otherwise more contemporary atmosphere.
The menu has a classy yet modern look too. The minimalistic two-page menu has a variety of options ranging from rice bowls and sushi to noodles and desserts. Although there is very little description and no images, it was easy to ask the staff any questions about anything you wanted to order. After much deliberation, I ordered a beef gyudon, which is usually thinly sliced beef cooked with onion traditionally served over steaming rice, but in this case, udon noodles instead of rice. The beef is sliced so thinly that when you lift a piece, the delicate piece of meat almost breaks away from your chopsticks. The beef is cooked in soy sauce, mirin, and dashi, so when you mix the beef and noodles together, the broth from the beef coats each noodle with a savory yet slightly sweet layer of flavor. 
The dish also came with a choice of seaweed salad, imitation crab salad, or miso soup. Although crab salads are not a traditional Japanese dish, it is served in many Japanese-American restaurants. The salad was presented in a neat pile decorated with little crunchy balls of salad topping similar to croutons. The imitation crab, also known as kanikama in Japanese, is actually made of pollock (or other mild fish) and tastes almost identical to real crab meat. The kanikama is mixed with Japanese mayonnaise, which has a stronger egg taste and is a bit sweeter than its American counterpart. The salad has a fresh taste, and, despite being called a salad, it did not have any vegetables. This appetizer fits perfectly with the gyudon and is a nice, cold dish to supplement the warmth of the noodles.
As I finished both dishes, I realized that my experience at this restaurant was the culmination of a 20-year-long dream, compacted into two simple dishes.

Wes Anderson, you’ve done it again! After a disappointing outing with “Isle of Dogs,” “The French Dispatch” is a great return to form. “Fantastic Mr. Fox” was probably the first great movie that I ever saw, and I can proudly say that it had a profound effect on me. I watched it obsessively after seeing it for the first time at the age of seven, and I consider it to be one of the greatest movies of all time. Wes Anderson has created yet another amazing film, one in a rare breed that feels both essential to watch in theaters, yet simultaneously necessary to purchase for home use, just so that one can pause, wind, and rewind to catch every intricate detail hidden in every beautiful frame of this movie. From the opening shot of a waiter delivering drinks, you are thrust into this meticulously constructed world. Poor imitators of Anderson often fail by including extended periods of downtime, believing that to somehow be an essential part of his style. In fact, the opposite is true. One can see Anderson’s touch through the truncation of this waiter’s walk. As he walks behind walls, ascending ever further towards the newsroom, you can see the extras partaking in their own routines.
As is customary with Wes Anderson films, this attention to style and detail remains throughout the entire movie. There is a real meticulousness to both the structure of the frames (both their content and their aspect ratios) and the movie itself. Centered around the death of Arthur Howitzer Jr. (played by Bill Murray), the editor of “The French Dispatch” (newspaper), four little vignettes are shown, presented as articles that had once been run in “The French Dispatch of the Liberty, Kansas Evening Sun.”
The first one, and perhaps my favorite, is Herbsaint Sazerac (Owen Wilson) giving a tour by bicycle of Ennui-sur-Blasé, the city where the rest of the stories take place. It is a heartfelt demonstration of the passage of time, intercut with revisions to the article. This segment is also the shortest, and I recommend for it to be watched, perhaps on YouTube once the movie comes out on DVD, by everyone, even those who do not like Wes Anderson movies. It is, as Herbsait Sazerac says, “supposed to be charming.”
I could go on and recap the rest of the vignettes, but I really think that you should just watch it yourself, so I’ll be brief. “The Concrete Masterpiece” by J.K.L. Berensen (Tilda Swinton) is an interesting rumination on the creation of art and its accessibility. Additionally starring Benicio del Toro, Adrien Brody, and Léa Seydoux, this vignette has some similarities to “The Grand Budapest Hotel,” with Adrien Brody again yearning for a great work of art.
In “Revisions to a Manifesto” by Lucinda Krementz (Frances McDormand), a student movement and revolt is built up and torn down to hilarious results. I cannot elaborate much upon this without revealing much of the payoff of this section. It does have a naked Timothée Chalamet if you are into that, though.
“The Private Dining Room of the Police Commissioner” by Roebuck Wright (Jeffrey Wright) is told to us on the set of a television interview that reminded me of the 1978 documentary film “Deal,” absurd toothpaste ads and all. The events that stem from the titular dining room are intense, funny, sometimes a Tintin-style comic strip, touching, and powerful. Out of the whole movie, this segment specifically feels like a tribute to French movies from the 50s and 60s. I was reminded of “Rififi” and “Tirez sur le Pianiste” during Wes Anderson’s depiction of a shootout and escape. This part also includes my favorite joke from the film. I suspect that Jeffrey Wright will be joining Wes Anderson’s collection of actors poached for future projects; he is a great fit.
The accompanying score is truly beautiful, and parts of it have been included in the album “Chanson’s d’Ennui Tip-Top” by Jarvis Cocker. “Aline” is a strong highlight, and the way it is integrated into “Revisions to a Manifesto” is extraordinarily beautiful.
The film alternates between black and white and full color for emotional or intense moments. I believe that this is meant to show the “8 pages of full color” of the magazine, which you see advertised on “The French Dispatch” magazine proper. The entire movie is a total love letter to these old magazines like “The New Yorker,” to the idea of France, and specifically to the abroad in France. All of our characters struggle with a sense of a lack of belonging and boredom, fitting for a town named Boredom-over-Indifference. The immigrant chef, the expat reporter, the revolutionary youths, the American in France — all these archetypes are given new life and beauty in this film. There is a specific part of the movie, referred to by Arthur Howitzer Jr. as the “best part,” in which Lt. Nescaffier tells us about a new taste, one that he has never tasted in his decades as a police chef. Roebuck Wright, our reporter for the segment, does not want to include it, but it truly is beautiful. What a delightful movie.

“Inside Job” is an adult animated show created by Shion Takeuchi, currently streaming on Netflix. 10 episodes are out, with an additional 10 most likely coming out next year. It is a comedy involving characters that work for the government in a world where almost every conspiracy theory is actually real, but with slight twists to each of them. This setup is rather creative, and there is clearly joy put into all the background references, although a few too many of those jokes are about reptilians for my taste. The writers are also attempting to build a larger universe in a style similar to “Gravity Falls” (Alex Hirsch, the creator of “Gravity Falls,” is the executive producer of “Inside Job,” and creator Shion Takeuchi previously wrote for “Gravity Falls”). A typical episode will focus on one major conspiracy theory like “government clones” or the “moon landing,” and follow our main characters as they act as a clean up crew to a problem that they frequently create.
The series takes a few episodes to get its groove, and the jokes in the first episode mostly miss, but once you get to the fourth episode, you can sense that the writers are comfortable with the characters. Standouts are the main characters Reagan Ridley and Brett Hand. It is truly a joy to watch their personalities bounce off each other. The voice acting is stellar for all characters, and even the less interesting characters are given a few moments to shine. On the topic of these less interesting characters, some definitely get more love than others. Magic Myc, the hollow Earth mushroom man (voiced by Brett Gelman, no relation), seems to be one of the writers’ favorite characters, and is given the most jokes out of any of the side characters. He seems to be a fan favorite, although I personally don’t think that his jokes landed very well. I prefer Dr. Andre and Glenn Dolphman myself, voice acted by Bobby Lee and John DiMaggio respectively.
The animation is also surprisingly good. There is a nice bounce to the characters that is not often seen in the genre of adult animation, and, as previously stated, the backgrounds are chock full of blink-and-you-miss-it sight gags that compliment the conspiracy theme of the show. Additionally, when the animators go all out, they really go all out, as seen in the JFK-clone-Akira standoff.
The show sadly just doesn’t take full advantage of all the possible joke opportunities that the conspiracy theory setting offers the writers. There is a sense of complacency in conspiracies targeted in the show, and I wish a few more “out there” conspiracies were referenced. There is a trend in shows now to serialize TV shows into having one continuous story, and I respect the push from “Inside Job” against that. There is an ongoing narrative, but it mostly occurs in the background, allowing interesting ideas to be at the forefront. There is a heavy focus on character relationships, and although the writers sometimes seem afraid of letting a genuine moment hang in the air, “Inside Job” has a lot of heart.
In conclusion, “Inside Job” is a good show carried by character interactions. A stronger focus on interesting situations in part two could really make it great. I commend Shion Takeuchi, Alex Hirsch, and the rest of the “Inside Job” crew for making this, and I’m looking forward to more. They might have a real hit on their hands.

Q: I hear there’s gonna be a solar flare this week. How should I prepare?
A: The Sun absolutely loathes the Moon, so if you can, dress up like its mortal enemy. Wear crescents wherever you can and make sure that you smell like a freshly baked croissant. That way the Sun’s harmful super-rays will bounce harmlessly off your stylish body.
Q. Halloween just reminded me that I never know what to do at parties. What tips do you have for fitting into a shindig?
A: Never underestimate the power of a good ghillie suit. Parties are all about blending in, so make sure you’re wearing as many dark greens, browns, and greys as possible. This tricks the eye into thinking you’re not really there, and that you’re part of the dense foliage found in most frat basements. To fool the other senses, spill some Yuengling on yourself and make hissing noises.
Q: I finally did it. I asked out my crush, and they said yes. But now that I’m with them, I’m realizing I just wanted to prove to the old warlock at the bottom of Doherty that I could get a girlfriend. What do I do now? 
A: Congrats on the gf, Stan! Now find the Key of Eternity and get a 4.0 to fulfill the prophecy!
Q: Winter is almost upon us. What tips do you have for staying warm?
A: There’s nothing quite as toasty as a Canada Goose jacket! Especially when it’s on fire! Make sure to buy about two or three of them when you make your burning pile. Dig a pit, line it with stones, and fill it with the rest of your cash when you light it on fire.
Q: I wanna stay up to date with Marvel, but there’s just so much. What should I watch?
A: I say skip the movies and pass the shows. Watch the six-hour unreleased interview of Stan Lee where he talks about his morning breath and then leaves the mic on for the rest of the day. You ever heard the King of Comics snore on a public bus? You’re about to! Oh, and "WandaVision," that was pretty good.

Carnegie Mellon has always been at the forefront of computing technology. Our databases have databases, and those databases have biceps. Which is why it’s so odd that I found a handwritten memo in Scott Hall chock full of requests from DARPA, the Department of Homeland Security, and ICE, asking for us to develop these technologies in the vein of national security. Keep your eyes peeled for the following tech updates:
“Drones that use facial recognition to differentiate between poor and middle-class targets”
“Pocket dimension tech that can be used to stick immigrants into the Phantom Zone like in 'Superman 2' (written off to the side: Would be dope as hell)”
“Robot horses that border patrol can use. Laser-guided lassos. Fire-breath maybe?”
“Really cheap insulin, but loaded with nanobots that collect user data and send ads for Dunkin”
“A self-driving car that locks its doors automatically when it’s within two miles of a weave shop” 
“Weaponized Ebola that targets people thinking about taking down Confederate statues”
“Anti-protest tanks that fire Jordan Peterson books at BLM demonstrators”
“Instagram for terrorists that gives them body dysmorphia way faster than normal Instagram"
“One of those helicarriers from SHIELD in Marvel, but it runs on diesel and refugee tears”
“Sonic the Hegemon imperialist Switch game. Make sure Knuckles is a Jingoist”
“Predictive software that can determine which kids in cages will grow up to be the best yard workers.”
“Idk...racist Iron Man suit?”
The paper ended with a stapled $100 bill and the sheet music to “Fortunate Son.”

This week, the FDA gave an Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) for children ages five to 11 to receive the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine, and shots for that age group could begin soon.
The FDA found that the vaccine caused a similarly effective immune response in children in this age group compared to people ages 16 to 25. In addition, the vaccine was 90 percent effective in preventing COVID-19 in children. The FDA has found no serious side effects in children who received the vaccine as part of their study.
The FDA's authorization means children ages five to 11 will likely be able to get COVID-19 vaccines soon, though the Pfizer vaccine is still only available to people 12 and up. The CDC's Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices is meeting Tuesday to make a recommendation on the Pfizer vaccine for the five to 11 age group. After that, the CDC will decide how to give out shots and immunizations will begin. 
The emergency authorization comes about two months after the Pfizer vaccine was fully approved by the FDA, and about 10 months since the FDA gave EUA to the Pfizer vaccine last December. 
At Carnegie Mellon, vaccination percentages remain unchanged, with 98 percent of the Carnegie Mellon population in Pittsburgh fully vaccinated. Since Oct. 26, there were five COVID-19 cases among students on campus, one case among students off-campus, four among faculty and staff on campus, and none among faculty and staff off-campus. From Oct. 26 to Oct. 28, Tartan Testing caught three COVID-19 cases out of 515 tests. 4.31 percent of isolation and quarantine bedding is in use, with 116 beds still available. 
The Allegheny County Health Department reported 835 COVID-19 cases in the week beginning Oct. 24, down from 1,691 cases the week before. Allegheny County had 12 people hospitalized last week, also down from 107 the week before. The number of deaths due to COVID-19 in Allegheny County this October increased to 106. 
All of the statistics in this article are accurate as of Oct. 31.

At their Thursday general body meeting, the Carnegie Mellon Undergraduate Student Senate held presentations on wellness at the university. “CMU is known for a lot of things. We can also be known for our wellness culture,” said Angie Lusk, program director for student affairs wellness initiatives, during a presentation to the Senate. 
Thursday’s Student Senate general body meeting saw presentations about mindfulness programs and dining at Carnegie Mellon as well as two votes that approved the proposed fiscal year 2023 (FY23) Joint Funding Committee (JFC) member slate and FY23 activities fee. 
Lusk presented about the state of mindfulness programs now as well as their future at Carnegie Mellon. Currently, she leads mindfulness workshops and has helped establish the Mindfulness Room in the West Wing, where she is also trying to bring back "Paws to Relax," a pet therapy session on Wednesdays from 7 p.m. - 8 p.m. She plans on growing and centralizing mindfulness programs at the university through implementing additional credited mindfulness courses, expanding existing workshops, and encouraging student-led mindfulness initiatives.
The Student Senate also heard from Director of Dining Services Joe Beaman about ongoing efforts to revive dining services at Carnegie Mellon during the pandemic. The university has a total of 10 independent dining partners, the newest being Millie’s Coffee 'n' Creamery, the Tepper School of Business’ new ice cream and coffee shop. These 10 partners are in addition to Chartwells, which provides many of the food options in Resnik House, as well as all of the options in the Cohon Center Marketplace. 
Beaman reported to the Senate that the university's dining services team is working to re-staff locations closed during the initial phases of the pandemic and adapt to COVID-19 restrictions. However, he said they still face challenges in hiring, and they still have 96 shifts to fill. This has resulted in less time each location can be open per day, Beaman said. 
However, he believes things are starting to get better overall: salad bars that were previously shut down from the pandemic are now up and running in Resnik House, and healthier options for sides, like side salads, are being considered. As vaccination numbers rise and COVID-19 cases decrease, dining is slowly returning to normal, Beaman said.
Finally, the Student Senate approved a 4 percent increase for the undergraduate student activities fee for FY23 with a vote of 24-5-1. For the 2021-22 school year, the activities fee is $135 per semester. The Senate also voted for the new FY23 Joint Funding Committee (JFC) slate, which is in charge of allocating funds to clubs around campus. It was approved 23-4-4.

*In April 2021, The Tartan began conducting interviews with fellow students to get a better idea of how the switch to online learning was affecting all of us. We followed up with all of the interviewees this semester so they could compare their experiences online and in person. 
This is the first in a series based on these interviews. This article is focused on the general learning experience during the different semesters, and the next will discuss the pandemic’s effect on mental health and navigating isolation and burnout.*
The academic year of 2020-2021 was an unprecedented one at Carnegie Mellon, with a hybrid mode of instruction that saw half the student population return to campus but almost everyone taking classes online through Zoom. The Tartan spoke with some students back in April, a month before the Spring 2021 semester was due to end, and again a month after this in-person semester started about their experiences with virtual and in-person learning, navigating the pandemic, and mental health.
“It’s a controlled shitshow,” said Ezra Blank, a senior studying fine arts with a concentration in printmaking, about the Spring 2021 semester. “But it’s not as bad as it could have been.” Blank had taken a leave of absence for the Fall 2020 semester. He had struggled with online classes when CMU transitioned to remote learning when the pandemic first hit in March 2020, and had not been certain whether the hybrid option that CMU offered for its students would work for him. As a printmaker, he would need access to facilities with thousands of dollars of equipment which he could not DIY for himself. He decided to come back for the Spring 2021 semester after having talked to friends from the School of Art who assured him that the hybrid option helped students go to and work on campus.
While some of Blank’s classes that semester met in-person and he had access to studios, he was still mostly learning through Zoom. “It’s a lot harder for me to put as much effort in things because it doesn’t feel like a real class,” he said. Both teachers and students didn’t treat it with the same gravity as in-person classes and art students have had to change a lot of their practice to transition to online learning — the camaraderie and constant supervision that exists during studio classes was gone and many were switching to digital art which they didn’t have much experience with which resulted in a slightly lower quality of work than usual, leading to a sense of discouragement.
Like Blank, Cindy Weiheng Qin, a junior in physics at the time, considered taking a leave of absence until things returned to normal, but decided to continue with her education after a conversation with her parents. “I was just not used to studying at home,” she said about transitioning to remote learning in Spring 2020. Qin is an international student and has lived in Pittsburgh throughout the pandemic. She didn’t have a proper workspace at home and had to work through the summer to make it comfortable for herself. Once the hybrid Fall 2020 semester started and she had an in-person class that she had to go to campus for, she thought she would be happy, but interacting with a large group of people after months of isolation was more overwhelming than she expected it to be.
Attending classes online, however, was also challenging. “My professors specifically there are some of them [who] were older, so they just don’t do really well on Zoom. And, for example, one of my professors just shows slides. And on his slides, it’s like, five or six equations squished into one slide, and they’re really hard to read. And he just reads through the PowerPoints really slowly. And I’m just like, why can’t I just read the textbook and learn the same material? And [in] less than half the amount of time?” she pointed out. “I don’t blame anyone for the decreasing quality of teaching. I know it’s a hard transition for [the professors] as well.”
Qin’s ability to focus during online classes and the motivation to attend them also suffered. “It’s always like, I can watch a recording [but] never end up watching them,” she said. However, test-taking had been made much more comfortable for Qin. “Personally, I do have a decent amount of test anxiety,” she said. Most of her professors assigned one of two styles of take-home exam: they were either open for a 24-hour or 48-hour time window and students could take it throughout that time, or the exam had a time window with a limited time and students could take it at any time of their choosing. Explaining how this helped her performance, she said, “For the physics exam, specifically, if I have more time to work through the problems, I really tried to understand like, what’s going on? Like, between the steps, how did you get from step A to step B, instead of memorizing equations and just throwing all of them onto a time[d] exam.”
Starting in the Spring 2021 semester, CMU reduced the number of weeks in a traditional semester from 16 weeks (including the final examinations week) to 15 weeks. It was also announced that there would not be a spring break that semester and that instead there would be two “break days” on which no classes would be conducted or work be assigned. The Fall 2020 semester had a Thanksgiving break for three days (five including the weekend). “One thing about this semester is we don’t have a spring break,” said Qin, speaking about the difference between the Fall 2020 semester and Spring 2021. “So I’m noticing myself, and a lot of my friends are having a burnout really early on in the semester. So yeah, there’s one major difference – you don’t get a long break in between.”
“Professors are rushing their material. There’s no spring break. So students are working harder. They’re more burned out by the end,” said Mehar Goli, who at the time was a junior studying electrical and computer engineering with an additional major in biomedical engineering. “In a lot of cases, [professors] weren’t able to plan correctly, or they just had to rush their material in order to compensate.” The lack of spring break, she said, with professors not being able to schedule things properly overall, meant students were working harder and didn’t have enough breathing room.
Mrinmayee Mandal, then a junior studying electrical and computer engineering, echoed the sentiment. She felt that the two extra break days helped but were not enough. “If I had spring break, I would have time to kind of collect myself again, look over the stuff I’ve been struggling with, and then come back and give my best shot at the finals. But right now my mental state is more like just, you know, it is what it is right now,” she lamented.
Mandal was on campus in Pittsburgh for the Spring 2021 semester but attended classes online for the Fall 2020 semester. She talked about the difficulties of doing labs while at home for her ECE classes, some of which shipped lab kits to her home: “This one time, my kit board wasn’t working. Turns out the problem wasn’t in the board, it was a cable. The professor kind of just told me to get a new cable … I didn’t know where to get a new cable and [it] was almost the end of the semester. We only had one lab left. So I just used my lab partner’s board, and she was somewhere else. So I didn’t really get to see the last lab on my board. Just because it would be too much of a hassle to send it back to Pittsburgh and have the professor send a new kit out.”
Goli, who also attended classes online over Zoom during the Fall semester before returning to campus for Spring 2021, felt that the flexibility of online classes was the only good thing about them because she can watch recordings. Blank also echoed that sentiment — “With online school, it’s a lot easier to attend class. Like, even if you’re too tired to get out of bed, you can just bring your computer into bed with you.”
However, Goli pointed out that after a while of watching professors teach on Zoom surrounded by the blank thumbnails of students with their cameras turned off, it can also lead to Zoom burnout and can harm the learning process. “You’re just constantly staring at the screen and it just feels so monotonous, the entire experience. And after it all, rather than feeling energized or something, I just feel tired. Because it’s not like I went somewhere, sat down and tried to do something, it just feels like all I did was watch. I just watched something on my computer.”
“There are less fun things you can do on Zoom, class-wise,” pointed out Qin, talking about the things she missed about being in-person. “So say, in in-person classes … there’s always this chit-chat time and someone says something funny, the professor says something funny — like these are small moments that make your day a little better. But this part is just completely taken away when we’re on Zoom.”

To say that I am excited to see the newest MCU Spider-Man film, “No Way Home,” would be a super-criminal understatement. However, when I realized that the previous Spider-Men (or Spider-Persons) would also probably be in it, I remembered something: Tom Holland is the worst of the three.
By “three,” I am strictly referring to Tom Holland, Sam Raimi’s Spider-Man from the early 2000s played by Tobey Maguire, and Marc Webb’s “Amazing Spider-Man” played by Andrew Garfield. I am not going to try and compare live-action apples to cartoon oranges, so I’m leaving it there. I shall now make my case by first illustrating what makes a Spider-Man a Spider-Man.
Historically, Spider-Man was meant to be a subversive character. Creator Stan ”The Man” Lee wanted to create a superhero that was both young and had many personal problems. Up to that point, almost every superhero was an adult paragon, and if young people did show up, they were often sidekicks (see Robin). Rather than a perfect billionaire like Bruce Wayne or a dreamboat alien like Kal El (aka Superman), Peter Parker is a social misfit who, even after receiving his powers, still struggles with eviction notices, domineering bosses, head colds, and least of all, supervillains. Spider-Man is defined by struggle. This is at his character’s heart.
Tobey Maguire was the first Spider-Man I ever knew. In fact, my second-earliest memory was stepping out of the movies, into the brilliant sunlight, having just seen the first film in 2002. Nostalgia plays a role in how much I enjoy his adaptation, yes, but let’s revisit Maguire’s wall-crawler. The first film spends about 30 minutes letting us know one thing very, very clearly: Peter Parker sucks, and nobody likes him. Not that he is merely annoying, like how the Falcon treats him in "Civil War." Not that a billionaire won’t give him a hug, like Tony Stark in "Homecoming." No. He is met with contempt and derision by nearly everyone save his aunt, uncle, and his neighbor/future love interest Mary Jane Watson. His bus driver speeds away from him. His friend Harry makes a move on his crush MJ. He’s booed by wrestling fans. He’s cheated out of $3,000. Even after he becomes Spider-Man, his very existence is condemned and challenged by his overbearing boomer boss J. Jonah Jameson. While brilliant and earnest, Parker’s life is dripping with tragedy in these films, and they let you know very early on. 
Andrew Garfield, for the longest time, was too much of a pretty boy for me to get behind. Now that I’m older and realize that in every adaptation of Spider-Man, Peter is portrayed as conventionally attractive, I’m willing to swallow this small hurdle in relatability. While both Tobey and Andrew struggle, Andrew always represented the part of Spider-Man that I’ve always adored: his ingenuity. Not only is Peter Parker booksmart, he possesses an inventiveness that often puts allegedly “smarter” heroes like Iron Man or Mr. Fantastic to shame. In “Amazing Spider-Man,” we see Garfield sneak into OSCORP, where he will become bitten by that fateful spider and steal web-fluid. He builds his famous shooters himself, and, much like an actual spider, creates a web in the sewers to track down the Lizard. He beats Electro with some quick physics, and even makes a last-minute fix to a kid’s broken wind turbine. This last point brings me to one other key feature of Spider-Man: he is a friendly neighborhood one. He talks to people, gets to know them, and helps them out in small to big ways. The only people MCU Spidey has to talk to are multi-billionaires, government agents, or super soldiers.
Now, does Tom Holland struggle? Sure. Spoiler Alert: his billionaire sugar daddy dies. Point being, Holland only, and I do mean only, has a hard time after some enormous advantage is taken away. In “Spider-Man: Homecoming,” he only sweats about catching the Vulture after his multi-million dollar spider suit is taken from him. In “Far from Home,” he only confronts Mysterio after the surveillance-state super-drones that were originally meant for him fall into Quentin Beck’s hands. Whatever blood he sheds or quick-thinking he has to do in those situations is, for me, completely negated by the fact that he doesn’t have to do that for most of the films he’s in.
Do I need Tom Holland to be the exact same hero as those before him? No. As any comic book fan should know by now, there’s more than one way to skin a multiversal cat. All I ask is that Spider-Man gets to be in a film where life punches him in the face rather than slaps him on the wrist. "No Way Home" looks promising, as his identity is compromised and he is finally labeled a “menace.” If the first scene has him run out of toilet paper, maybe then I’ll stop complaining.

Personally, I have never been a fan of horoscopes. They’ve always struck me as a desperate attempt to control the uncontrollable parts of life. Yet, I often find myself taking a sneak peek at the daily predictions for Pisces. Despite having a soft spot for my own horoscope, I draw the line at letting something as rudimentary as a 13-year-old pug named Noodle influence my approach to the day. 
In the midst of a pandemic, during times of stress and fear, people needed to look for something to believe in: a sign that they were going to be alright, a sign that they could make it through the day. Enter Noodle the pug, an adorable old dog who, like all of us, sometimes has trouble getting up in the morning. Noodle, a TikTok star, seemingly was the hero the world was waiting for to bring some positivity into their lives. Depending on whether or not the pug can stand up, owner Jonathan Graziano lets people know whether they can face the day and take risks (a "Bones Day"), or gives them permission to stay in bed and “focus on themselves” (a "No Bones Day"). 
People effectively base life-changing decisions from marriage proposals to house hunting on an old dog’s mood. People often struggle to find ways to be motivated or give themselves permission to rest, and Noodle takes that burden off of the individual. No wonder people love him so much. Yet, while I appreciate the need to look to something outside of religion and personal motivation to navigate the unpredictable nature of life, a dog seems like a desperate attempt at finding a belief system.
Some might say that this is similar to astrology readings, and my willingness to accept a Pisces horoscope and berate this particular trend makes me a hypocrite. However, I beg to differ that belief in the stars and their clairvoyant abilities has existed for years, but this feels more like another excuse for people to not take responsibility for the choices they make. Our ability to make decisions that affect the outcomes of life is one of the fundamental rights of being human. Truthfully, when we need help getting through the day, we should seek it out; instead, we seem entirely ready to give up our life choices to a dog who gives no tosses about what our needs or priorities are.

On Oct. 27, 2018, an unthinkable act of hatred struck the peaceful neighborhood of Squirrel Hill: a white supremacist entered the Tree of Life Synagogue during morning services and opened fire, killing 11 and wounding six. The effects of the attack rippled throughout the world and the national and international response was swift, with outpourings of grief, support, and mourning for the victims and survivors. From the Vatican to the White House, leaders around the world condemned this heinous act of terrorism.
It is easy to become desensitized to such tragedies when we only see them displayed on television screens, but on that horrific day in October, we were all reminded that hate was pervasive and far closer than any of us wanted to imagine. Not only were those who were lost prominent members of the Jewish community, but some were also close friends of Carnegie Mellon, such as Joyce Fienberg, a retired researcher at the University of Pittsburgh and widow of Stephen E. Fienberg, professor of statistics and social science at Carnegie Mellon. 
In the immediate aftermath, nearly 2,000 community members gathered in central Squirrel Hill for a vigil organized by the Jewish Students of Taylor Allderdice High School, where the students led the group in Misheberach, a Jewish song for the sick and healing. Carnegie Mellon Chabad, the Hillel Jewish University Center of Pittsburgh, and the Alpha Epsilon Pi fraternity also organized a vigil on campus. The group also painted the Fence in remembrance of the tragedy. The design was simple but powerful: both sides of the Fence were painted black, two subtle Jewish stars were placed on the front, and white handprints adorned the back. “The front and back of the Fence reflect for me the experience that I’ve had this past week, where I’ve been scared and I’ve been anxious, but I’ve also been overwhelmed with love,” said Jacob Meyers, one of the organizers of the painting, in an interview with The Tartan at the time. The following Monday, University President Farnam Jahanian held an event at the Rangos Auditorium to publicly mourn those lost in the shooting. 
In the years since, the COVID-19 pandemic has made it hard to gather together physically to commemorate the event, although there have been numerous virtual offerings from the university for students to engage with each other and to mourn and remember. As we pass the third anniversary of the shooting, the majority of students have returned to on-campus living and learning. Our proximity reaffirms our bonds as a community, but it also accentuates the pain of loss that has remained with us. In commemoration of the third anniversary, students organized to once again paint the Fence and to hold a commemoration for the victims. The design on the Fence proudly displays the message “Stronger Than Hate,” and features Jewish stars on the front and back. 
We will never forget that this terrorist attack happened, but with each passing day, we continue to move forward and to strive for a brighter future. The Tree of Life shooting reminded us all of the undercurrent of bigotry that exists in our society, and that we must always be vigilant to ensure that these hateful ideas do not take root in our communities. It has also shown us our resilience in the face of tragedy, and that we can band together to comfort, uplift, and work with each other to change the world for the better. Only through our collective efforts can we realize a future without bigotry and hate, one where we truly embrace diversity in all its forms.

Here’s a quick legal primer to what’s happening with SB8, the restrictive abortion law in Texas, which will be heard this week by the U.S. Supreme Court. 
As a binding legal decision, Roe v. Wade has many parts. The Texas abortion law, SB8, violates a particular piece of Roe: namely, the point at which states can legally ban abortion. SB8 bans abortion much, much earlier than Roe allows. 
Roe uses a standard of “viability,” which means states can ban, if they so choose (they are not required to ban), when the fetus can live viably outside the womb (with intense medical support), which is currently about 24 weeks. At that point the court recognizes life. Thus, states can protect that life, if they so choose (Roe makes no determination about when life begins).
The Texas law, however, bans abortion at fetal heartbeat, at six weeks, arguing this marks life.
This is in clear violation of Roe’s viability standard. But back in September, the Supreme Court did nothing to stop this patently unconstitutional law from going into effect, suggesting to other states that they too can also put in place currently unconstitutional laws banning abortion before viability, and the Supreme Court will let them stand. 
At six weeks, most people don’t know they’re pregnant, or have just learned. And the hoops that you have to jump to get an abortion, the bureaucracy, and now the backlog in appointments, take quite a while — from several days to several weeks. This means nearly all are prevented from having an abortion under Texas law. The window left open by SB8, the first five weeks, is so early, and therefore so restrictive, that it is effectively making it impossible for almost anyone to get legal abortion care. 
So that’s the first part of why the SB8 is important: it effectively bans abortion. The second part is different, but equally important. 
SB8 deputizes Texas residents to uphold the law. Then it promises to pay them handsomely to do so. At the same time, it criminalizes assisting anyone in getting abortion. So Texas residents can now bring almost any other Texan to court by claiming they assisted someone in getting an abortion, and then get paid by the state. In short, people are incentivized to round up other citizens and charge them, and drag them through lengthy, expensive court processes. 
The purpose here is two-fold: to scare people from supporting abortion in any way or to oppose SB8. Particularly when the law doesn’t explain what assistance is. Driving someone to the appointment? Donating to Planned Parenthood? Signing a petition? No one knows. Any and all are possible legal violations now. 
The other purpose of this, aside from scare tactics, seems to be to create a legal out for Texas. Texas can claim they’re not enforcing the law, the people are. Texas hopes to fend off challenges against them on that basis.
This third import for this Texas abortion ban dwells on the enforceability of laws, more generally. SB8 clearly violates the Constitution, being in defiance of Roe’s viability standard (24 weeks), which is the only legal point at which states can ban. Yet the Supreme Court initially declined to stop it, letting the law go into effect. 
If the Supreme Court is going to change legality around when abortion can be banned, that has to be declared in a new ruling (which would be legally binding). Here, the court simply said nothing, which is more broadly worrisome. Are our laws enforceable or not? The court seems to be saying, “no.”
The Supreme Court had already agreed to hear a Mississippi challenge to Roe, and many expected the Supreme Court to reverse Roe’s many pieces then (ruling expected next year), including the viability standard.
Many people argue that when the Supreme Court let Texas' patently unconstitutional law go into effect on Sept. 1, 2021, Roe died. Not the end we all expected — a big loud finish, dramatic headlines, and a definitive reversal in a majority opinion, but rather a quiet, unexpected end, with the Supreme Court not speaking. Killing Roe by saying nothing was unexpected, and many argue, including one of the justices themselves, an abdication of the Court’s own responsibility to uphold the Constitution (See Justice Sonia Sotomayor’s scathing dissent).
Meanwhile, a lower court later ruled the law violated Roe’s viability standard for banning abortion (24 weeks), and was therefore unenforceable and illegal, putting a temporary stay on the law. This is before yet another lower court let it go back into effect days later. Pressure on the Supreme Court to speak rather than pass has been intense, and so now, this week, the Court has agreed. 
Where we’re headed next, no one knows. But the stakes are high. Not just for abortion, but also for the enforceability of our Constitution, and whether citizens can and should be weaponized against one another, and paid by the state, to enforce a (unconstitutional) law.
Oral arguments start Monday morning at 10 a.m. EST and audio will be streamed live. 
This matters to us all.
