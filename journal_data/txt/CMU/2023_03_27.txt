Hoo boy, I love March Madness. It perfectly encapsulates what college sports should be like: messy, confusing, and on the whole just plain fun.
Just plain fun being something a lot of top seeds didn’t really get the opportunity to enjoy. See, the great thing about this storied month is the upsets. We aren’t tuning in to see a No. 1 seed slap the hell out of a No. 16 seed again; we want to watch something magical happen, or a Cinderella run where a team that nobody saw coming goes far enough to go down in history. And man, did we get those upsets. It started simple: No. 4 Virginia got taken down by No. 13 Furman on a last-second game-winning three. There’s only a couple things constant in the world: death, taxes and Virginia underperforming in the big dance.
Of course, the basketball gods were not content with just one upset. My beloved Arizona got their asses handed to them by a bunch of prep school nerds in a 2-15 upset. Arizona’s second upset versus a 15 seed, making them the only such school to that in history. But even that wasn’t enough.
The Purdue Boilermakers boiled over, and in what was completely expected for a team that relied extensively on tall boy Zach Edey to score, got taken down by 16-seeded Fairleigh Dickinson. That’s right — Purdue now joins Virginia in the hallowed cathedral of biggest choke artists in history. So add in one more constant, the state of Indiana being terrible at sports. That FDU loss was even more devastating considering FDU only got in the game on a technicality. They lost to Merrimack in the Northeast Conference finals, only to see Merrimack get disqualified over the division transfer four year time frame. Because of how absolutely godawful the NEC was, this one bid conference didn’t even get the decency of playing directly in the first round; they had to play Texas Southern in the play-in, and beat them. So Purdue didn’t lose to a mid-ranked 16 seed, they got whacked by a virtual 17 seed that shouldn’t even have been there.
FDU, unfortunately, didn’t make it past the second round, taking an eight-point drubbing by Florida Atlantic, a team which… then proceeded to make the Final Four, over No. 4 Tennessee and No. 3. Kansas State. It just keeps getting better. FAU is the third No. 9 seed to make it to the Final Four, and they will be playing San Diego State after a nail biting, last-second free throw from Darion Trammel put away the Bluejays for good. Of course, with a second left on the clock, it was a solid minute before we could actually see the game get called, but hey, it’s always fun seeing good basketball get played.
The other No. 1 seeds, Alabama, Kansas, and Houston, all got upset as well, though Kansas lost to Arkansas in yet another postseason. Congrats on Jayhawk basketball for reaching the same levels as their football program. The result? The first-ever No. 1 seedless Final Four, and after Texas lost to Miami, we've got a Final Four with no one, two or three seeds. Depending on who takes care of business, we could see UConn play in another championship, or maybe even the all south Florida basketball tournament between Miami and FAU. Easily the prediction everyone had when this postseason started.
March Madness delivered what’s on the tin – madness. The upsets this year have been phenomenal, and watching the Cinderella run of a team like Florida Atlantic has been entertaining as hell. Seeing No. 1 seeds collapse left and right has been a breath of fresh air, and even if Arizona couldn’t win it all, it’s going to be fun watching these last few games.

The 2023 World Baseball Classic was more than just a mere success. I believe it has helped revolutionize baseball as a global phenomenon that will only continue to grow. This was the fifth iteration of the tournament, but it will stand out in history as the one that truly realized this tournament as an event that everyone should look forward to every three years. Some of the best baseball I have ever seen occurred as all star teams fought to survive one more game in order to claim the WBC Trophy and be the true champion of the world. 
The first round was pool play which saw the 20 different nations divided up into four groups that were played around the world. Cuba and Italy survived the weakest pool, Pool A, as each of the five teams finished 2-2. Cuba and Italy moved on due to the tiebreaker which was runs allowed divided by number of outs recorded, which simply means whichever team allowed the least amount of runs. This was not necessarily a surprising result, but it was rather disappointing for the Kingdom of the Netherlands to miss out on moving on when they have been one of the more successful teams in the tournament’s history. Taiwanese player Yu Chang took home Pool A MVP after boasting seven hits, two home runs, eight RBI, and a 1.438 OPS. 
Japan dominated Pool B by going undefeated 4-0 and outscoring their opponents 32 to 8 over the four games. Australia also surprised many as they nabbed the second spot of the pool which most thought would fall to Korea. The Czech Republic went home as one of the fan favorites even though they only went 1-3. Their roster mostly consisted of amateur baseball players, which made for some surreal moments when they had to face the best player on the planet, Shohei Ohtani. One player, Ondrej Satoria was able to strike out Ohtani even though his day job is as an electrician. After leading Japan to the next round, Shohei Ohtani won Pool B MVP after hitting six hits in twelve at bats including three doubles and a homer. He also pitched four scoreless innings while only giving up one hit. It was very fun to see the Japanese crowd support their players as each game packed the Tokyo Dome. 
Mexico surprisingly won Pool C after dominating the United States in their matchup. Both teams would move on to the next round as expected, but many saw the United States as the easy winner of the group. Canada and the other nations fought hard, but were not good enough to compete with the talent of the top two teams. Mexico was the story of the group as they dropped their first game to Colombia, but responded with three wins to claim the group. Randy Arozarena claimed the Group C MVP with a .500 batting average, five doubles, and a 1.703 OPS, all while being the spark plug for Mexico. His story is rather unique as he was born in Cuba. In order to reach the big leagues, he defected from Cuba to Mexico where he would jump start his pro career. He has found a home so much so in Mexico that he pleaded with the President to allow him to play for the Mexican national team. 
Pool D was easily the most competitive of the group stage with three extremely talented teams in the Dominican Republic, Puerto Rico, and Venezuela. Miami was rocking for these matchups and the teams did not disappoint. In a huge upset, Venezuela won the group stage after going undefeated and taking down not only the D.R., but also Puerto Rico in back to back games. The second spot came down to a final game between the Dominican Republic and Puerto Rico where Puerto Rico was able to pull off the upset and win 5-2. The betting favorite of the event, the Dominican Republic, did not advance past the group stage in what most people saw as one of the greatest constructed teams in baseball history. Venezuelan catcher Salvador Perez won Pool D MVP after leading his team to crucial win after crucial win. Pool play was rather up and down as for every good matchup, it seemed a mercy would also happen. 
Unfortunately, there was a downside to the WBC as Mets All Star closer Edwin Diaz injured himself during the celebration of Puerto Rico’s win over the D.R. This prompted many on social media to denounce the WBC while calling it a set of exhibitions that meant nothing. I strongly disagree with such a notion and the only proof that is necessary was seen in the following elimination games. 
The eight remaining teams moved on to play the elimination games against their Pool counterparts. For example, the winner of Pool A played the runner up of Pool B. In a close game, Cuba defeated Australia 4-3 behind timely hitting and key pitching performances. Cuba would have a number of days off until they would play the winner of the Pool C runner up and Pool D winner in the semifinal game. The other game including these two groups saw Japan continue their dominance as they trounced Italy 9-3. Italy played valiantly to get this far as they were led by Kansas City’s Nicky Lopez and Angel’s Dominic Fletcher. It should also be noted how they each sported their own mustaches and had an espresso machine in their dugout. 
On the other side of the bracket, Mexico locked with Puerto Rico in what was an excellent game. Puerto Rico jumped on Julio Urias to scratch four across in the first innings, but were then held to zero the rest of the game. Mexico battled back until they finally took the lead in the seventh inning after putting up a three spot. For the first time, Mexico had punched their ticket to a WBC semifinal where they would face the all powerful Japan. Venezuela would face the United States after winning Pool C in Miami. This was an excellent back-and-forth game as the United States would take the lead in the first inning 3-0. Venezuela would not go down easy as they eventually took a 7-5 lead going into the eighth inning. Trea Turner came up to the plate with the bases loaded and launched a two strike pitch into the bouncing left field bleachers, turning the game upside down. The United States would not relinquish its 9-7 lead after dominant outings by both Devon Williams and Ryan Pressly. They would face Cuba in the semifinal the following day. 
The final four was now set and all the teams had arrived in Miami. The United States would face Cuba and Mexico would play Japan. The first semifinal was not very interesting, as the United States lineup of stars fed off Cuban pitching. The rout ended 14-2 in what was a dominant performance for the United States, who were primed to defend their WBC title in the championship game. The other semifinal game was an all-time classic that was maybe the best baseball game in recent memory. Japan threw 21-year-old phenom Roki Sasaki who could toss an easy 100 mph fastball with a deadly splitter. Several Major League scouts were in attendance for his performance, and he did not disappoint. He would, however, be outpitched by Patrick Sandoval, who threw 4.1 innings of scoreless ball. This pitching duel was scoreless until Luis Urias caught a hanging breaking ball from Sasaki and sent it into left field to take a three run lead. Japan would continue to threaten as they seemed to have multiple runners on base every inning, but were just missing that big hit. Kazuma Okamoto believed he delivered when he smacked a ball into left, but at the last moment Randy Arozarena leapt up to bring the homer back in an electric moment. It seemed the ball always found him and he always delivered. Right when necessary, Masataka Yoshida launched a ball off the foul pole to tie the game at three. Mexico would quickly respond as an RBI double from Alex Verdugo gave them the lead. A following single by Isaac Parades would push one more across, but a great throw by Yoshida would hold the score to 5-3. Japan would push one more across and hold Mexico to set up the score 5-4 in the ninth. Ohtani would double to lead off the inning and Yoshida would walk to put runners at first and second. Munetaka Murakami, a great home run hitter in Japan, would launch a ball into the gap to walk off the game 6-5. Pinch runner Ukyo Shuto raced around the bases to score from first to home in only 10.3 seconds. A huge win for Japan and a devastating loss for Mexico made for a moment few will forget. 
The WBC Final matchup was set with the United States facing off against Japan in a heavyweight matchup for the ages. The first notable hit was by none other than Trea Turner, who sent his fifth homer of the WBC into the seats in the second. This lead would not last long, as Munetaka Murakami would respond with his own solo shot in the bottom of the second. Japan would manufacture another run and Kazuma Okamoto would redeem himself by actually hitting a homerun this game. The Japanese bullpen would hold the score at 3-1 until Kyle Schwarber hit a mammoth shot into the second deck to make it 3-2. In the bottom of the ninth, Shohei Ohtani would come out of the bullpen to finish off the game. After hitting the entire game, he would now take the mound in hopes of winning Japan’s third WBC. 
Mookie Betts grounded into a double play after a Jeff Mcneil walk to make it two outs in the bottom of the ninth. A set up for only a matchup that could be seen in dreams. Shohei Ohtani on the mound and Mike Trout at the plate. Two players that are not only on the same team, but are also two of the greatest players this generation has ever seen. Shohei Ohtani can both pitch and hit at a high level while Mike Trout has been the best hitter on the planet for nearly a decade. The first pitch, Ohtani threw a slider that was just low to make the count 1-0. He then threw a 100 mph fastball just by Trout’s bat to then just miss the outside part of the plate with another 100 mph fastball. If Ohtani lacked any confidence, he didn’t show it as he rifled another 100 mph fastball right by Trout. He missed with another fastball that touched 102 mph to set up the count at three balls and two strikes with two outs in the bottom of the ninth and a championship on the line. Ohtani’s pitch was a disgusting 87 mph slider that broke 17 inches across the plate. Mike Trout swung and missed to give Shohei the strikeout and Japan a World Baseball Classic Championship. 
This WBC had several memorable moments that will be remembered by many all around the world. Baseball is not just a sport for Americans, it is a sport for everybody around the world. This World Baseball Classic had everything one could ask for, including that dream matchup just at the end. The baseball Gods truly gave us an event that will not be forgotten and I am sure all the players are itching to claim glory in the 2026 World Baseball Classic that can’t get here soon enough.

Men’s Tennis
The 27th-ranked Carnegie Mellon men’s tennis team visited Boardman, Ohio on Saturday, March 25 to take on 10th-ranked Denison University.
Overall, the team struggled to find their footing against the Big Red. In doubles, all three Tartan teams fell to their opponents, first 8-3, then 8-6, and finally 8-2. This put Denison ahead 3-0 before singles. However, the story was similar in singles. Two Tartans were able to force second-set tiebreakers, but ultimately, Denison also swept the Tartans in singles, giving Carnegie Mellon a 9-0 loss. 
This loss moved the men’s tennis team to 5-6 on the season, and they will next play the University of Mary Washington at home on Saturday, April 1 with an 11:00 a.m. start.
Women’s Tennis
The Carnegie Mellon women’s tennis team traveled to West Virginia this past Saturday, March 25, to take on Division II West Liberty. 
In first doubles, the team of junior Danna Taylor and sophomore Crystal Zhou claimed the first Tartan win with a 6-1 win. The team of sophomore Zoe Angell and first-year Anika Joshi won 6-3 in third doubles, and the team of first-years Manuel Van Cotthem and Divya Venkatarama completed the Tartan sweep 7-5 in second doubles. As such, per Division II rules, the Tartans headed into singles play 1-0.
Many Tartans also claimed points in singles play. In second singles, Zhou gained another Tartan point after defeating her opponent 6-3, 6-3. Van Cotthem followed suit in the third singles spot, winning 6-4, 7-5. In the fourth spot, Venkatarama beat her opponent 6-2, 6-1, giving the Tartans their fourth point of the day. The Tartan’s last point came from Joshi in the sixth spot, where she beat her opponent 6-4, 6-1. Overall, the Tartans claimed victory over the Hilltoppers, 5-2.
This victory has moved the women’s tennis team to 14-3 on the season, and they will next be playing University of Mary Washington when they host them on Saturday, April 1 with an 11:00 a.m. start.
Men’s Track and Field
This past Friday and Saturday, the Carnegie Mellon men’s track and field team hosted a variety of Division I, II, and III institutions for their annual Invitational at Gesling Stadium. Tartans found success on both the track and field.
To start off the running events, senior Elijah Sech and junior David Durdaller placed first and second, respectively, in the 3,000-meter steeplechase. Sech finished in 9:18.11 while Durdaller finished in 9:19.04. In the 400-meter hurdles, junior Andrew McGovern claimed first with a time of 53.65. Meanwhile, in the 400-meter race, first-year Gaven Williams took first with a time of 50.59 while junior Austin Weltz finished right behind him in second with a time of 50.62. In the 800-meter run, sophomore Colin McLaughlin placed second with a time of 1:54.99. 
The 4x400-meter relay team of Weltz, senior Leland Davies, Williams, and junior Alex Ivanov claimed first, finishing in 3:27.01.

In the pole vault, first-year Christian Duckworth and sophomore Casey Potrebic cleared the bar at 4.15 meters; the judges awarded Duckworth second and Potrebic third. In hammer throw, sophomore Cody Breidenbach placed second with a throw of 52.22 meters, while senior Bailey O’Malley placed second in shot put with a mark of 15.25 meters. 
The combined efforts of the Tartan’s track and field team helped them to place first in the meet out of 15 with 200.5 points. The team will next be competing in the Dave Labor Invitational on Saturday, April 1 at Slippery Rock University. 
Women’s Track and Field
The Carnegie Mellon women’s track and field team hosted a number of Division I, II, and III institutions this past Friday and Saturday at Gesling Stadium for their annual Invitational. 
To start the running events, sophomore Norah Czajka claimed third in the 3,000-meter steeplechase with a personal-best time of 12:23.98. Senior Samantha Giordani took first in the 200-meter dash with a time of 25.49 while also placing third in the 100-meter dash with a time of 12.58. Senior Liz Barre claimed third in the 400-meter run while junior Isabella Rhee took fifth with times of 57.63 and 59.47, respectively. First-year Jacqueline Liu took fifth place in the 800-meter run, crossing the line in 2:19.24.

The combined efforts of the Tartans earned them second in the invitational with a total of 96 team points, just 10 behind first. The team will next be competing in the Dave Labor Invitational at Slippery Rock University on Saturday, April 1. 
Softball
On Tuesday, the Carnegie Mellon softball team took on Chatham for a doubleheader; this also marked the first time the two teams have ever played each other. 
In game one, a number of Tartans recorded hits while six recorded at least two. Junior Kiera Boucher plated three runs while also scoring three herself; she also doubled twice. First-year Kira Monji was 4-for-4 at the plate, including a double and a triple, while also scoring three runs. First-year Grace Fujino pitched the complete game while only giving up one run. The Tartans topped the Cougars 12-1 in six innings.
In game two, the Tartans also found success. Junior Amanda Smith earned her fifth win of the season when she struck out eight batters and stayed on the mound the complete game. Boucher picked up another three hits in this game, scoring three runs total. Sophomore Faith Lawrence brought two home during the game, once in the first after a triple and the second in the third with a ground out. The Tartans won their second of the day, 5-1.
On Friday, the Tartans headed to Brandeis University to open UAA play for the season in a series of four games against the Judges. 
The series opened play on Friday with a doubleheader. In the first game, despite seven Tartans recording a hit, they only scored one thanks to a home run from first-year Koko Sagae in the top of the second. In the bottom of the third, though, Brandeis responded with a two-run homer. No more runs would be scored until the bottom of the sixth, when the Judges brought nine back to the plate. Play spanned six innings; as such, the Tartans fell 11-1 in the first game.
In the second game of the doubleheader, Brandeis opened the scoring in the bottom of the first with one run. The Tartans responded with a run of their own when senior Emily Finger hit a sacrifice fly to bring Sagae home. Despite this, the Judges would go on to score five in the second inning and three more in the fifth, capping the game at five innings. This was the Tartans’ second loss of the day, 9-1. 
The third game of the series opened on Saturday. Brandeis put the only runner across home plate in the bottom of the second following a sacrifice fly. In the top of third, the Tartans had a chance to equalize it, but were not able to convert after senior Piper Johnson was caught in a rundown and junior Erika Heffernen was thrown out at home. A scoreless rest of the game gave The Tartans their third loss of the series, 1-0.
The fourth and final game of the series started on Sunday, March 26 at 11:00 a.m. Carnegie Mellon was the first one on the board during the third inning thanks to a three-run homer from junior Kiera Boucher. However, Brandeis responded with three runs of their own in the bottom of the fourth and five more in the bottom of the fifth. The Tartans weren’t able to return any and the game concluded after the top of the seventh, 8-3 in favor of the Judges. 
The Tartans will be back on the road this week on Tuesday, March 28 for a rescheduled doubleheader with Hiram College at 3:30 p.m.

The Pens have had an… exciting season, to say the least. Winning streaks, losing streaks, injuries upon injuries upon injuries, and chants of “Fire Ron Hextall” have all added up to make this a season to remember. It’s been a while since I gave a Pens update, so here’s what’s going on:
General Manager Ron Hextall has come under a lot of fire recently for his lack of trades, and his choice of who to trade. So, so many people have been calling for Jeff Carter to be traded, and they have all been ignored by both Hextall and head coach Mike Sullivan, who has been quick to voice his support for keeping Carter every time the topic has come up. Instead, the Pens (in some way or another) got rid of Teddy Blueger, Brock McGinn, Mark Friedman, and Kasperi Kapanen. They also gained Dmitri Kulikov, Nick Bonino, and Mikael Granlund. There were also picks for future years getting traded around, but who cares. That’s a problem for 2024 Haley to worry about. It has really yet to be decided if we’re happy with these trades. I was personally a little heartbroken over the loss of Teddy Blueger, but I’m not general manager so I don’t get a say in the matter. Regardless of my personal opinion, the Pens have won five and lost seven in the 12 games since the trade deadline, which might as well be the same as their six wins and six losses in the 12 games leading up to the deadline. It should be noted that Bonino and Kulikov have yet to play a game with the Pens since their trades, as they’ve both been out on IR the entire time. We shall continue to see the situation develop as players hopefully mend and return to the team.
While we’re on the topic of injuries, did you hear that Jarry was once again out with another lower body injury this week? It’s okay though, we don’t have to  — he’s already well enough that he was able to backup Casey Desmith on Saturday. On a more exciting note, Casey has been doing really well recently! Consider this my official apology to Casey Desmith and all of his fans: Casey, I’m sorry. You’ve been doing really well, and you haven’t been in and out every single week over and over again. Congrats on your .907 save percentage. For my bestie Tristan Jarry: please get your shit together, you’re embarrassing me.
With only nine more games left until the playoffs, the Pittsburgh Penguins are just holding on to that second wildcard slot with a three point lead on the Florida Panthers. This week, the Pens are set to face the Red Wings in Detroit on Tuesday, and the Predators in Pittsburgh on Thursday. They’ll then have back-to-back home games against the Bruins and the Flyers on Saturday and Sunday. I’ll be praying my hardest for nine Peng-wins in the coming weeks, I’m not ready for them to be done this season.

Lower vertebrates, like reptiles and fish, have shown a remarkable capacity to heal in a scar-free manner and regenerate lost appendages, even at the adult stage. However, most mammals have lost the ability to regenerate lost appendages or organs. A notable exception to this trend, though, is the antlers of deer. Scientists see this as a valuable model for studying organ regeneration in mammals. In their study, Qin et al. used stem cells to generate antlers on mice. 
The first step for these researchers was to use RNA sequencing to examine nearly 75,000 cells from the antlers and nearby tissue of sika deer. The cells they looked at came from before, during, and after the antlers were lost, and the researchers were able to identify a specific family of stem cells that were key to antler renewal. 
When looking at antlers 10 days before they were shed, the scientists identified a subtype of these stem cells abundantly seen in the stumps that remain on the day of shedding. By the fifth day before shedding, these cells had also generated a separate subtype of the stem cell; by the tenth day, this new subtype of stem cells had begun to develop into cartilage and bone cells. 
The cell population at the five-day mark had the properties that the researchers were looking for. These cell masses, through migration and proliferation, move to the spot of the injury and have the information required for the animal to regenerate a missing organ or appendage. These cells were compared to other animals' regenerative cells (from mouse regenerative digit tips, axolotl limbs, and zebrafish caudal fins), and found that even though cell composition varied across species, a similar type of cell was present across them all: PRRX1+.
After examining these cells, the team of researchers transplanted day-five stem cells into the foreheads of mice. Within 45 days, the mice began growing antler-like structures that consisted of cartilage and bone. The researchers had also transplanted some day-zero stem cells into a group of mice, but they only generated fibrous connective tissue and not antlers.
At the end of the paper, the scientists conclude that antler regeneration is consistent with a conceptual stem cell-based regenerative process. They also note that their results suggest that these cells may have an application in clinical bone repair. They close their paper with the suggestion that the induction of human cells into those similar to the stem cells observed in this study could be used in regenerative medicine for skeletal injuries or limb regeneration.

You might think that monthly periods are a normal, expected part of period-havers’ lives. You would probably be wrong; I hear every so often about that first day of period or premenstrual symptoms catching folks by surprise. It’s like, 20 or so days pass and all of a sudden you completely forgot what it felt like to be moody, crampy, and bleeding. Luckily, there’s an extremely convenient solution to this problem: period tracking apps.
Apps like Clue, Flo, and more allow you to input your bleeding days and do all the hard math for you. They’ll notify you when they think you’re about to start bleeding, PMSing, or ovulating. They’ll compile all of your historical periods to give you personalized cycle predictions. For those looking to get pregnant, this can be incredibly helpful because our bodies don’t typically notify us of our daily fertility in any significant way. If you’re detail-oriented, you can even track specific symptoms and activities. Depending on the app, this can range from what types of period products you used on a given day, your sexual activity, your level of social interactions, the texture of your skin and hair, or your basal temperature. If you can name it, you can log it.
And if you can log it, someone can store it in a database. Given the extremely personal nature of all of this information, this fact might — and should — be of note to period app users. These days, data privacy is a hot topic. Companies like Google and Facebook are notorious for buying user data to tailor ad experiences. Period tracking apps are selling. In 2019, it was found that the makers of the period app Flo had been selling user data to Facebook for three years. 
There are a lot of complexities surrounding data brokerage, and I could spend a lot of time enumerating them all, but the bottom line is this: if you’re not paying for your period tracking service, someone is, and it’s likely by buying your data. If you don’t want another person to know that you had a zit on your nose on Tuesday and then took ibuprofen for your moderate-severe cramps on Friday, you should probably be very cautious about which period apps you use, if any, and how you use them. If you’re looking to keep yourself protected, School of Computer Science professor and data privacy expert Jason Hong suggests: “Apps that use Apple's HealthKit have stronger protections in place. The data is encrypted and stored locally, meaning that Apple can't decode the data.”
This is especially relevant now, as women’s reproductive systems are under more regulation and scrutiny than ever. After Roe v. Wade was overturned in June 2022, many became concerned that the data garnered from period apps might be used against them in the name of upholding new abortion bans in some states. Data collected about unprotected sex, gaps in birth control, the use of Plan B, and irregular bleeding or cycle length could all be strong indicators that someone has had or will try to obtain an abortion. Jason Hong says, “There is tremendous potential for false positives of ([people who] seemed to have a pregnancy end early, perhaps due to miscarriage or an abortion or premature birth) … There will likely be some overzealous prosecutors. There is also the bounty program in Texas where people can turn in other people [who get abortions]. And there will also be pushback from some tech companies, but how much is unclear.” As a result of so much ambiguity, most advised switching to paper and erasing any trace of your online menstrual presence last summer. One proposed solution is to inundate apps with false data from our non-menstruating allies. Hong says this would “[blunt] the utility of the data if there is a dragnet that trawls the data for possible abortions. I think this is not a bad idea, but only works if there are lots of men that do this, and if they fill out the data in a manner that looks realistic.”
There are no laws in place to stop prosecutors from making use of data tracked on period apps. There are few laws in place to stop prosecutors from making use of any kind of data. That is, even if your period tracker isn’t giving away that you’ve done something illegal in your state, companies that buy data from your period tracker might. This is true for almost any data though — it is well known that location data, text messages, and other digital use data can be used in court cases. It is for this reason that some advise against deleting your period app in panic; getting rid of it probably won’t protect you when it comes to abortion. 
In some cases, too, data collection by period trackers is completely benign. Clue, for example, operates under UN law which prohibits the sale of data. Instead, Clue collects anonymized data solely for research purposes, and heavily vets each research team that applies to use their database. Apple has paired with Harvard in a similar data transfer research initiative. In each case, the goal is always to learn more about the menstrual cycle and educate others. As someone who thinks we have barely scratched the surface on the topic of menstrual health, I have a hard time arguing that data collection for research is unfounded. So I won’t argue that. Instead, I’ll say that I hope those who are continuing to use period apps are well-informed about the risks and becoming better-informed about themselves by tracking their symptoms. And I hope we never enter an era where people who menstruate have to write their cycles down on paper out of fear.

The U.N. says we’re running out of time to save the planet, but there’s still an off-ramp before we reach a climate catastrophe. Last Monday, the U.N. released a report synthesizing global knowledge about climate change. The report came to two major conclusions. The first is that we are on track to create irreversible damage to our planet by 2050, and the second is that with drastic action we can start to fix the climate crisis by 2060. The U.N. also has a slideshow summarizing the findings which is easier to understand.   
Every couple of years, the U.N. gathers scientists from around the world, including Carnegie Mellon engineering and public policy professor Paulina Jaramillo, to publish an assessment of the state of global knowledge on climate change. This report is issued by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) and it combines scientific, technical, and socio-economic research on climate change to make predictions about the future and recommendations for action. The report combines three working group reports and three special reports that cover climate science, climate impacts, and how to tackle climate change in detail. The report culminates in a synthesis report to summarize the findings, especially for policymakers. 
The report concluded that global temperatures have risen 1.1 degrees since 1990 because of human action, specifically the burning of fossil fuels. Current predictions are worse than those made in the fifth assessment in 2014, showing how urgently action is needed as the effects of climate change are worse than initially predicted. “The report shows that climate impacts are undermining our livelihoods, they are damaging the global economy, and the impacts threaten our life support system, that of nature itself,” said Dr. Hoesung Lee, chairman of the IPCC, at the press release conference on Monday announcing the synthesis report. 
The vast majority of the article focuses on the clear effects of climate change on people, ecosystems, and global economies. Aditi Mukherji, one of the authors states that “climate justice is crucial because those who have contributed least to climate change are being disproportionately affected.” This is one of the core problems with climate change and the difficulties solving it: the countries doing the most damage are experiencing the smallest repercussions. Between 2010 and 2020, human mortality from natural disasters was 15 times higher in highly vulnerable areas (areas that are already more susceptible to natural disasters like flooding, earthquakes, and droughts) than in low-vulnerability areas. 
The report did offer hope, stating that “there are multiple, feasible, and effective options to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and adapt to human-caused climate change” and they are becoming cheaper and more accessible to both developed and developing nations. This would require all nations to cut their greenhouse gas emissions by 60 percent by 2035. Cutting greenhouse gases and carbon emissions requires reducing our dependence on them, by switching to electric vehicles and increasing renewable energy use. It also requires improving carbon capture and removal technology to mitigate emissions in sectors that depend heavily on greenhouse gases, like agriculture, aviation, and commerce.
The goal is to limit warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels, which nations agreed on as the limit to avoid worse effects in the 2015 Paris climate summit, and is considered the most extreme point of return. By acting quickly and drastically, nations could achieve “net-zero” greenhouse gas emissions by around 2050, and the Earth’s temperature would begin to stabilize around a decade later. 
Reading about the climate might seem frustrating, but this report shows that there is hope, though drastic action is required to see changes in the future. The report combines global knowledge, making it more concise and accessible to lawmakers and companies,  and will serve as the basis for future climate-related negotiations under the United Nations. The upcoming months will be crucial to see changes in law, so we can only hope lawmakers will make the best decision possible.

There is an old proverb passed down amongst the people of North Africa and the Arabian Peninsula that, when translated, roughly amounts to: “None but a mule denies his family.” It is to make note that there is a physiological nature within one that causes them to seek out one’s related blood; not only that, but to find acceptance within them. Family, or sadly lack thereof for some, is a permanent and crucial aspect in one’s identity in a spiraling world capable of swallowing up someone whole if they haven’t any foundation to stand upon.
Such is the partially tragic story that we witness in Davy Chou’s beautifully gut-wrenching “Return to Seoul,” a feature film recently opened to audiences in Pittsburgh for Carnegie Mellon’s Annual International Film Festival. The film follows Freddie (Ji-Min Park), a 25 year-old French woman who was born in South Korea in the late 1980s but was put up for international adoption due to circumstances. As she does not speak Korean nor considers herself Korean, she has it in her mind to attempt to rejoin with her biological parents as a means of acquiring answers.
Booking a flight to Seoul, she meets with Hammond Adoption Center and is told the Center’s policy of being able to send a telegram to her parents to see if they would like to meet with her. She is told that if they accept, they can be in contact with one another, but if they refuse, Hammond will have to close the case indefinitely. Freddie opts to send a telegram, and manages to get in contact with her father, thus beginning her journey.
Soon enough within the picture, we find out the type of person which Freddie is, alongside how outcast she is from the sobriety and rigid couth of Korean lifestyle. Raised within modern Western enlightenment, she doesn’t share the extreme repulsion to things such as lewd and obscene actions that the far more conservative country like Korea has. For her, a night could be drinking and dancing at a club, only to wake up the next morning in bed with a stranger, and as chaotic as such a lifestyle is, it is that lifestyle she prefers to what she would be subjected to in Korea.
Meeting her father (Oh Kwang-rok), she finds that he is divorced from her mother, often drinks in emotion, and sends drunk emails to her on how sorry he is for leaving her. This causes her to feel uncomfortable, of the opinion that she has no emotional or tangible connection to this man. She leaves him in a more lonely place than when she started, and is continuously harassed by her father, who wishes that she come live with him in Korea so he can help her marry a Korean man. She reverts back to her way of living and when angrily followed by her drunk biological father, she screams at him that she never wants to see him again. In her inhibition for any meaningful connection with anyone, she is declared by her only friend, Tena (Guka Han), “a very sad person”, and loses her.
Fast forward two years, we watch the life that Freddie made for herself. In a party scene, we are subjected to flashing lights and blaring music enough to make any person feel sick. Freddie is, in fact, a sad person who sees no value in the pursuit of intimacy and for so many years, tries to contact her mother. Without anyone to rely on for any emotional support, she would rather bury her feelings and drink and party to find any meaning in her life.
Eventually, something does snap inside of her to change the way that she lives and seek some form of help. Five years later, she meets her father once again, and tells him that she became a weapons dealer, sending weapons of war to countries for the sake of peace, in theory, and wishes to try to meet with her mother once more. After seven total years of telegrams, she eventually gets to meet her mother, which causes all of those deep-seated emotions spill out of her eyes.
Sadly, she loses contact with her mother, and the only connection that remains is in the form of an email, which fails to send a text a year later, stating that she is finally happy with her life. She ends the message with her Korean name, signifying that she has come to terms with her identity.
The film does leave a lasting impression on the viewer. I don’t believe that it is a criticism of the bureaucracy of the international adoption center system, as life would objectively be worse without it. The closest the film ever comes to criticizing it is stating that it manages to protect the parents more than the kids when it should ideally be the other way around. The film, more likely is to be seen as a personal journey of a single individual  without any greater political statement, as it is based off of a real woman who is also a French-adopted Korean woman.
To typical Western audiences, they may be thrown aback by the brutal nature of the film when it comes to the senseless portrayal of a hedonistic lifestyle and mistake it for a romanization of it. In the theatre, after watching a party scene that was so loud and seizure-inducing that one has no choice but to squint or look away, a lady in the seat in front of me turned to her husband and asked “Do you think she’s going to kill herself at the end?” as if such would be a resolute ending to this story. Still it is within the realm of possibility that such an ending could be construed to make a point. The film, however, takes a more optimistic approach.
In the first scene, we see Freddie describe how she sees sight-reading music as a philosophy that she applies to life. During sight-reading, one must put themselves within the middle of the music and be careful not to mess up, subjecting themselves to the “danger” of mistakes, but otherwise creating a beautiful melody. The ending of the film has her playing a piano, where she manages to sight read the piece on the music desk. As with playing piano, one must join both hands to cooperate in crafting the melody. She has learned to find peace in who she is as a Korean-born French woman, and to herself, she is happy.

I was introduced to the music of Rav my first year of college, courtesy of a friend who played a song of his with the wonderfully concise title, "You Fuckers Were Asking For This — Boin Edit." I don't know who "fuckers" are or why they deserve such vitriol, but it's exactly the kind of high-energy song I want to turn into a fine powder and inject as a solution straight into my arm. Over a year later I can still listen to it on repeat and never get tired of the sound.
Rav is a rapper and Twitch streamer of moderate acclaim. I honestly know almost nothing about him because the best source on his life is a fan-written page on fandom.wiki for some reason. Last week he released "LEAP," his ninth, or maybe seventh, or possibly sixth full-length album (it's hard to number his projects because many of his "albums" consist of collections of B-sides, plus one that's purely a collection of beats he uses in other songs?). It's the first project he's released since I started listening to him, which is exciting because now I get to review an album about a relatively unknown artist and make sure everyone knows that my music taste is just that quirky and underground.
The project marks a pretty distinct break in style from most of his other music. Rav seems to have let go of the hyperactive delivery, bright instrumentals, and high-pitched vocal samples that dominated his sound in earlier projects (and which drew me to his music in the first place). Nearly all of this album's nine tracks are subdued, moody, and extremely synth-heavy, with Rav delivering his lines in a low, raspy voice that draws the listener in as he walks us through his struggle to break out of harmful thought patterns. It certainly isn't his first time experimenting with this kind of sound; however, it is a bit of a leap, but I think the risk paid off. 
A through-line of the album is the toxic relationship between him and his listeners, and the desperate need for external approval that develops when you live at the whim of your audience's music taste. It serves as a sequel to his 2020 project, "I'm on to Me," an album that loops back on itself to mirror his inability to get better. Three years later, he's not all that much better, but he's ready to take the leap that brings him out of these tendencies. 
Because it's such a brief project, I'm gonna give you my thoughts on each of the nine tracks with a Fantano-style monologue. 
"Post-timeskip clarity": This song is an appropriately heavy start to the album. The drums and bass are concussive, and the synths create an especially ominous vibe underneath the layers of aggressive vocals. That said, I'm pretty sure that in the hook he misspells "melancholy" with two e's. 
"Half-Silvered": While we catch our breath from the intro, the gentle electric piano arpeggios give Rav the room to explore his relationship with his audience in more depth — "when you step away from the glass I don't disappear / my life ain't an anecdote." This transitions immediately into
"In my Bag": The song he released ahead of the album, and for good reason. It feels like by far the most fleshed-out song, and is easily worth listening to on repeat. 
"Agent Orange": This is the one real miss on the album. Not only is the hook about "corny rappers" not very congruent with the rest of the album, the weird, plinky two-note electric piano melody is just not very interesting. While it's not a sin to have a song that's stylistically distinct from the rest of an album (in fact, it's probably better when an album actually isn't homogenous), this one just doesn't really work.
"Worth 2": Featuring two long-time collaborators from his label, Exociety, this feels like the safest song on the album. It's the most quintessentially Rav, and fits well into the track listing.
"Incorporeal": This one sounds like it was designed to be listened to on some kind of substance.
"The Skin i Live in": This is a pretty good song. I'm starting to wonder how Fantano does this, because I have very little substance to say. Maybe this was a bad idea. 
"CRYO": The arpeggios from "Half-Slivered" are echoed here, but pitched-shifted up. It's his second attempt on this album to establish the performer/audience divide, and this time he's more forceful and less patient with the audience. By having the penultimate track mirror the sound and themes of the second one, it gives the album a nice symmetry.
"Me, Forever": On the final track, Rav gives us his concluding thoughts over an absolutely beautiful instrumental. The steady, authoritative delivery and the self-reflection in his lyrics make it easy to imagine this one as the concert-ender. The lyrics are so steeped in references to his earlier songs and projects that I think I now understand what it's like to be a Swiftie. It's been in my heavy rotation ever since the album came out.
Taken together, the project is (mostly) sonically consistent and tells a very cohesive thematic story through the music. It comes in at a pretty short 30 minutes, but as Rav proved in 2015's "Beneath the Toxic Jungle" (just 31 minutes), he's more than capable of putting out a great album in a short timeframe. Some of the individual songs leave a lot to be desired, but I feel hesitant to air out my criticism too harshly considering that the toxicity of the performer/audience relationship is such a major theme of the album. 
"I'm me, just enough / The toxic jungle is just above / and only I decide when I go up / Me"

From country folktales to the strategy for perfecting the s'more to the struggles within a household, “Orion and the Goatman” struggles to be boxed by any definitive genre or structure, and is designed to be such. The two-man, two-act show tells of the Murphy half-brothers Logan and Luke (Lukas Jarvi and Noah Pacht, respectively), and how an annual camping trip turns from a burden upon the brothers into a moment of clarity on the barriers that they have between them, with the assistance of a seven-foot, ten-footed man-eating goat demon from hell.
Just as impressive as the acting, the writing and general performance of the play was the totality of the production that went into it. The play, originally performed in 2021, was created to be staged outdoors due to the sylvan nature of the show, but this year, it has been moved to be in an enclosed studio room. Proper commendation should go to the designers and techs that brought the enclosure to feel outside, by way of lighting, sound effects and more than anything, the fog. The acting stage, in total, could not be more than 10 meters in the walking area, and to make it an entire world in which you care for both characters is a marvel in and of itself; even more when halfway through the play, they are forced into a circle barely big enough for the both of them.
The enclosed setting of the play is fitting. Enclosed within the characters is a story unseen, and largely untold apart from inferences we can make. The two brothers make this camping trip an annual ritual, with them only now doing it without their father — who recently passed away — carrying an urn of his ashes to pay respects. Within this trip, they must recount an old folktale of a supposed half-goat, half-man creature that, as far as they know, does not exist, and shouldn’t play any importance to their lives.
The first half of the play consists of the audience getting to know the two boys and their relationship. Luke, an 18-year-old loudmouth, is as humorous as he is obnoxious and over-the-top, serving as the comic relief and jokester for the duration. His other, and maybe better, half is 28-year-old Logan, a more conscientious and logical fellow who thinks more of the trip as a chore than anything else. One of the main ideas brought up here is the constellation Orion the Hunter, and what it represents for Logan: a hunter and protector among the stars to look upon at any point when one has an unobstructed view of the heavens. It is upon the clouds above that the two boys hope to have their father looking over them from, and so one comes to the idea that perhaps Orion and their father are one in the same. Their adorable, albeit immature exchanges per occasion last a while to situate the audience into a comfortable place, and once put there, the play takes a sharp left.
The introduction of the Goatman is a powerful scene in shifting the entire trajectory of the play. Brewing intensity has us frightened for the boys as a seven foot tall behemoth, resembling more of a wolf than any goat, aims to kill them. They are protected by their father’s ashes, and ward the giant beast away, isolating them within the confines of the circle they created, and so with tensions high, and the audience in wonder as to what they just saw and what will be the fate of the two boys, we receive a wonderful sight of brotherly love.
“We don’t know each other,” or the line which sounded like it struck deep in showing how the relationship between the half-brothers is nothing more than a paper-thin facade that they are both putting up for no reason at all. Domestic fighting, yelling, crying and anger rage through both boys as they come to terms with the fact that they love each other more than they previously knew and don’t want to die in some unnamed forest in the middle of the Southern United States.
They realize that they need each other more than they lead on and for some reason, hold each other in a negative light: a cocktail of envy, disappointment, and wish to impress. It is a satisfying conclusion that they reach. And nearing the end of it all, they end up sharing one last moment together, that being a dance to Steely Dan’s “Peg.” The play lets them have their moment. They earned it for the emotion which they put in, and as the song finishes, rain begins to pour and Luke says the final line of the play: “He’s still up there.” That line, referring to Orion, or perhaps their father.
“Orion and the Goatman” was a fantastic experience which I’m sure is more excellent outdoors. Getting to meet the people who created the play gave an appreciation for it that I couldn’t have otherwise, so to the entire production team, I say, bravo. You all outshined all expectations on this one.

“Ben” marks Macklemore’s reemergence on the scene, his return to the rap game he never really left.
Macklemore’s third solo album, after a span of five years, is a highly cohesive production. Each song blends well into the next, while still managing to affect with new and familiar styles. “Ben” manages the feat of being sonically surprising: What is expected is not always what happens. That creative quality is too often lost in today’s commercialized world of pop music. The album’s themes are distinct and smoothly ​​transitioned. Tracks move from light-hearted to nostalgic, satirical to reflective, and they finally end on a lighter yet emotionally rich note.
Macklemore opens with “Chant,” marking his comeback in glorious fashion. It’s an anthemic track filled with the purest and simplest energy to be found on “Ben.”
That first song sets the intention: Macklemore never really left, and he’s here to stay. Now a veteran of the artform, Macklemore is calling for his due: “They told me that I vanished… I told them ‘Don’t panic… This is my moment – they can’t take my talent.”
After the opener, the album steps into an 80s inspired moment, with several bright songs about childhood and happiness. From there, the album takes another turn, homaging the rap nostalgia of Macklemore’s youth with the darker tracks “Heroes” and “Grime.” On these, he shouts out N.W.A. and 2Pac, Shock G and DJ Quik, titans of G-Funk and rap’s early heyday. Macklemore takes us back to where he started, painting a vivid picture of his mindset and daily life, and the inspirational artists from early in his career. The beat selection, all crafted by Seattle-based producer Budo, is notable on these retro tracks, as the beats themselves evoke a classic time in rap history.
“I Need” shifts the darker sonic theme into sharp reflection on the rap world’s toxic culture. The tempo picks up and a more modern beat kicks in. What at first seems like a stereotypical hip-hop track, glorifying consumerism and constant desire, takes the opposite road. The lyrics turn out to be a rip-roaring callout of the genre’s tropes, a biting satire of the genre and the values it encourages, created in its style. “I want it all, the American dream – I got everything and I still ain’t happy.” Macklemore questions the constant drive for more to feel successful and the chasing of material fulfillment as a substitute for real happiness. This song is a highlight, for its energetic sound and exciting vocals.
Where the album truly shines is in the transition between that song and the next, a laid-back track called “Lost/Sun Comes Up,” one of the most affecting on “Ben.”
Mack’s introspective bars are soothed and emoted by vocals from Jackson Lee Morgan. Here the album peeks through the clouds of nostalgia to reflect frankly on the present. Macklemore calls out the vapid and soulless pop-rap of today with the “same drums, same melodies,” where the lyrics don’t seem to matter. He may not be the best in the game, but he’s out for originality and clarity.
From there, the tracks grow darker and more lyrically complex, taking on issues of alcoholism and rough relationships. This nimble shift in style takes the record further in a reflective and conscious direction. The final track reflects on parenthood and maturity, wrapping up the lessons he’s learned from years in the industry.
There’s no autotune to be found on this release. Much of Macklemore’s greatness comes from his ability to connect authentically with his listeners while conveying a message with clarity, led to by his natural and coherent vocals. On “Ben,” there’s nothing but clarity. What he has to say is heard.
Macklemore is perhaps the most self-reflective he’s ever been on a record, hinted at by the use of his own first name as the title. “Ben” may not top the charts, and its tracks may not be guaranteed hits, but it is a continued dedication to what Macklemore is all about: saying his piece while making engaging music. The rapper isn’t afraid to say what’s on his mind. And on this record, he leans into taking life slow and appreciating its subtler moments, the joy that comes with authenticity.
Overall, the album is a major return to the artform that shows he isn’t gone, that he’s still a player. It’s a tribute to Macklemore’s career so far, paying respect to the old ways while appreciating and taking stylistic hints from the new. It’s a solid, fresh, non-derivative addition to the discography, setting up Macklemore for a continued spot in today’s music scene.

Ceci,
You always argued with me about taking the JuVen treatments, and look at where we are. I know they say it doesn't directly prevent heart disease, but maybe if you had more energy and kept your mind sharper you would have kept playing tennis, and then your heart would've stayed in better shape. I don't know. Obviously it doesn't matter now. I'm not even sure who I'm writing letters to at this point, I guess it's just a course of habit. Maybe if I keep writing it'll help me cope with the grief. 
Usually you'd be the one to help me through a rough patch like this, so maybe if I keep pretending you're reading these I can imagine what advice you'd give me. I used to do that a lot, did you know? I never really told you about that. Whenever we went through periods where we didn't talk as much, or if you didn't answer my letters, I'd just imagine a conversation between the two of us. Sometimes the advice from the imaginary Cecilia was almost as good as the real thing. I wonder how similar she was to the real you. Now I guess she's the only one left. 
Coming back to New York for your funeral has me really thinking about the direction of my life. I think I should go back to school and get a second Ph.D. I've been looking around, and I really want to study at Rockefeller University. Time is a gift, and even though I'm turning 65 next month my mind still probably has several good decades left. I'm in the first generation of humans to be able to use a brain for this long, so I'd better see how much knowledge I can cram in there. There's a Ceci-shaped hole in my life now, so maybe I can fill it with textbooks. 
Do you remember what I told you when I first went to college? I talked about how I was anxious about optimizing everything because you told me to "make the most" of my life. I've fallen back into that thought pattern for the first time in a really really long while. I kind of forgot how awful it is to feel this way. The JuVen is making it worse because now I feel like I'm on borrowed time. I thought I had graduated past that kind of anxiety after college, but my mind can be a little funny I guess. 
The kids are doing good. Alex is traveling in from Europe for your funeral because she's been touring with her group. She sends me videos every once in a while, and it never fails to amaze me that half my DNA is in a person who can solo like that. Me and Clair never made that happen. Roy moved out of Clair's place about six months ago, because he finally got an internship. I think I was worried about him for no reason. Looking back, his only issue was that it took him a little bit longer than usual to get his footing in the world. But he's figuring it out now. 
Clair herself actually called me not too long ago, just to catch up. It's such an odd dynamic to have with a person, but we're both adult enough to have a conversation with each other. She remarried and has been working as a lab technician at UT Austin. Strictly speaking, I guess I haven't "moved on" since I haven't been seeing anyone since we split. But I wouldn't go back even if I could, so I'm about as over her as one can be. I'm glad she's doing well. Genuinely.  
After that phone call, I randomly remembered something you told me during the Thanksgiving break of my freshman year. I think it was a joke about how I could kiss a girl and she wouldn't know if I was interested or not. I remembered how that joke was about Clair, a full year before I ever asked her out. Then I thought about how you, Clair, and all our old friends from high school aren't in my life anymore. But I still remember the joke fondly. It's nice to have had something that makes me smile, I guess. That seems meaningful, even if you're all gone now. 
I say "I guess" a lot, you ever notice? You'd think eventually I wouldn't have to guess. I've been around pretty long at this point, and for a good stretch, I thought I had figured things out. But nope. I still don't know. You always seemed to know, but you're gone now. Maybe it's time I finally grow up.
Love,
Andrew

This review was written by two people. Amanda’s voice is in bold, Haley’s voice is in italics. 
Last Friday, Hozier released a new EP, “Eat Your Young,” and people have not been OK since. Fans were originally told in 2021 that a full album would be coming in 2022 (spoiler alert, it never came). But about a month ago he announced that instead, he would be releasing an EP on March 17, which is both St. Patrick’s Day and his birthday. This EP only has three songs, but two of them are from the album that is still being promised to us and all of them are making people go feral online. When tickets for his concert were released one week after the EP, they sold out in under three hours. 
People have been losing their minds waiting for this man to drop new music, and were absolutely not disappointed when they finally got it. Hozier has said that he’ll continue to drop songs over the course of the next few months, but I kind of have trust issues at this point. I’ll believe it when I see it. In any case, here’s a comprehensive review of the three songs that we do have for now.
"Eat Your Young"
Ah, yes. The titular track of the EP. This track represents Gluttony, and God does it show. Filled with imagery of finery and decadence, it’s entirely fitting to describe this song as rich and filling. The most prominent instrumentals are the heavy bassline and drums, with just a taste of strings in the back. I think this is one of those songs that would feel so good to listen to when you’re just in a funk and wanting to stew. It would also fit really well on one of those TikTok villain playlists, now that I think about it. It’s like… heady. I’d definitely recommend. 8.7/10
The first time I heard this song was on an Instagram edit, when just a little piece of it was released and oh lord, was I sooo excited for the whole song. It just scratches that part of my brain and gives such main character energy. It’s a lot heavier than most of his other songs, and really sets the tone for both the EP and the album to come with their themes of the nine circles of Hell. Overall, a great song to just pretend you’re a part of and sing in your room. 9.6/10
"All Things End"
I reeealllly like this song. It’s soooooo 90s RnB, I really love it. Complete with choir style backing vocals and a chant breakdown with clapping, this song feels like it should have a music video shot on a roof with the camera flying around “Kiss from a Rose” style. This song relates to heresy but like… not in a sinful way. In a sweet and uplifting way. Even though everything eventually ends, that doesn’t mean you shouldn’t do it!! It’s really sweet and soulful, I’m a huge fan. 9.8/10
I’m going to be completely honest, this song was my least favorite when I listened to the EP for the first time. I thought it just felt lacking and boring, but after listening to it a few more times it really grew on me. I think the issue was that I always listened to the album in order, and coming after “Eat Your Young,” which was so heavy, this one felt really light. But the chorus has a really good gospel feel.  When listening to the lyrics, the lightness feels very fitting given that he’s singing about how everything eventually comes to an end and we start over, which is a very freeing thought. I give it a 7.9/10.
"Through Me (The Flood)"
This song is the only one of the three that won’t be on the full album when it’s eventually released, but that did not stop Andy from carrying on with his gospel feel. This one is fun because it’s a little funk-coded (I’m looking at you, bassline), but still very distinctly Hozier vibes. I think “Through Me” is the track that feels the most familiar to Hozier’s usual style – dark and brooding and folk-alt-indie, with a distinctly reverent vibe that really sends Hozier fans into the next dimension. It’s all about falling in love with someone you know you’ll lose, and loving them anyway, knowing that heartbreak looms on the horizon. God, does this man know how to get into a guy’s chest. This song is just so. So. Ya know. It’s the one I like least out of the three, but still so so good. 7.8/10
I really liked this song because it reminded me so much of the older Hozier songs that originally made me fall in love with his music. It also has a little groovy bit in the middle that is so good. It really just makes you want to sing along. Even though all of the songs are about the same length this one just feels so much shorter to me because it’s so good it just goes by so quick once the bassline picks up. This song was a close second for me at 8.6/10.

Miley Cyrus is back again, with another heartfelt album. "Endless Summer Vacation" is here, an ode to Cyrus’s own grief and vulnerability. The album oozes both nostalgia and melancholy, headlined with slow, heartbreak music like "Flowers" and "Jaded." "Flowers" itself was insanely popular on release, and you’ve probably heard it a half dozen times by now, and it's genuinely moving. The slow and subtle opening explodes into a pop refrain. It’s a song about loving yourself, a song about coming to terms with the loss of a romantic partner. Cyrus croons about picking yourself up, remembering who you are, and how you gotta care for yourself.
Jaded is another pop hit, with the feel of a romantic song you’d hear over the radio when driving. It’s not angry, but it still feels like a gut punch listening to it. There’s a sort of quiet sadness, and it leads into "Rose Colored Glasses," another ballad and another hit of melancholy. It’s a beautiful song, sparking imagery of the simple snapshots you’d want to keep forever, the pictures you’d want to just dive into, and the moments you’d want to repeat over and over again. Brandi Carlile joins Miley for "Thousand Miles," a song that is just a reminder of how being in love feels. It’s a little foray into romance in the meat of the album, and it delivers. "Thousand Miles" is about remembering that love in the rearview mirror, while "You" is about diving into that romance. "Handstand" is rawer, but the undertones give this one a lot more of a jarring tone. "River" is what happens if you take "You" and add into it the background of "Handstand," and boy does it deliver. "Violet Chemistry" is the last of this string of romantic songs, and it gives you just enough to know there was something beautiful here, and as the song winds down, you feel there. You’re the one in love.
And then, Miley hits you with "Muddy Feet," a scathing fight that puts you on the back step, only for a completely different tone in "Wildcard." Another romantic song, another trip into memories, followed by a quiet track in "Island," this time portraying something far more lonely.
To complete the journey that "Endless Summer Vacation" puts the listener through, Miley opens up about her grief in "Wonder Woman." It’s the story of someone who pushes their sadness down, who grins and bears it, who bore it even when she couldn’t. The album is a beautifully miserable experience. The opening, the anger and the relationship it focuses on, slowly gives way to the romantic memories, the stories of what had been, the spark that had started it all, only to slowly, step by step, lead you to the end of it all. It’s an amazing album, and hats off to Miley for delivering one more time.

A hush falls over the crowd as the lights dim, and a countdown on the big screen begins. The annual Lunar Gala will begin in just five minutes. After the producers kick off the show, the models, wearing the clothes from the first design, strut onto the runway. This year’s Lunar Gala featured 12 different sets, all following a theme that sets out to capture the uncapturable, the fleeting — Morii. With “Morii” in mind, the designers sought to showcase their interpretations of that which cannot be captured and invite the audience to partake in bringing their memories and aspirations to life. The avant garde designs draw the viewer’s eye and elicit feelings of awe, admiration, and perhaps even confusion. However, whatever you may have thought of the outfits, you cannot deny the artistic thought and effort behind each item of clothing.
While I am not a fashion connoisseur, I can appreciate the artistic thought behind many of the designs. One of my personal favorites was the Rewind line, which featured colorful outfits made entirely of yarn. The peculiar choice in material represented designer Michelle Yue’s memories of a warm, fuzzy childhood spent with her grandmother. In a figurative and literal sense, Yue hopes to “recreate the comfort and warmth of these memories” using yarn, as stated in the Lunar Gala pamphlet. Other than the heartwarming thought behind this set out outfits, I have to applaud the creativity and skill required to make such intricate designs out of a basic and simple medium.
Always a sucker for symbolism, another one of my favorite lines was La Piñata. With “street style” designs in dominant colors of green, white, and red (and an outfit that was simply the actual flag of Mexico), it was clear designer Oscar Monarrez was paying homage to Mexico and its traditions and cultures. A present motif was, of course, a piñata, in the form of tiny purses carried by all models. The cohesiveness of the outfits, the restricted color palette, and the simplicity of the line in general, was the designer’s way of “embodying the culture which he grew up around ... and its transition into what he sees it as now.”
The Wei Lai line also appeals to me for a similar reason. The thought behind the line was to “encapsulate what is yet to come and what is yet to be created,” applied to the lens of East Asian-ness in a Western society. The outfits featured were whimsical and elegant, adhering to a strict color scheme of black and white. Some pieces featured aspects of traditional East Asian dress, a tribute to Asian culture in a Eurocentric fashion industry. The models looked almost intimidating in the outfits, which I suppose accomplished designers Sihan Wu, April Wu, and Sarah Kwok’s goals of “disrupting the spaces we exist in”, inviting the audience to “question western hegemony” for the sake of creating a society which does not favor or single out any identity, in the fashion realm and outside of it, too.
Lastly, the Limbic line lends its livery to a more scientific interpretation of this year’s theme Morii. The designer Madi Davis employed the use of various fabric mediums to create allusions to the human limbic system, which controls the creation of memories and emotional responses. It was interesting to see this incredibly scientific idea translated to a visual, wearable medium. Naturally, this neural system is incredibly intricate and complex, and the outfits in the Limbic line do this complexity justice, with textured garments, ruffles, and fleshy colors. I recall watching the models walk in the outfits, and thinking, “it feels like I’m at the science museum.” So, I suppose designer Davis expressed her artistic vision quite well!
While I only mentioned a few of the twelve lines featured in this year’s Lunar Gala, all sets were interesting and fresh. The most inspiring part is that all designers are current Carnegie Mellon students (and a couple alumni)! And, of course, I cannot neglect to mention all the off-stage work that goes into such a huge, professional event such as this one; production, photography, cinematography, and performance were all also student-led. It’s a shame all this work culminates in only a one-night showcase, but don’t worry, if you missed it this year, Lunar Gala will be back next year, providing Pittsburgh with new, enthralling designs.

Without safety precautions, Buggy has the potential to be a dangerous sport. As drivers race down hills and around turns, they need to have as wide a field of view as possible to guarantee they are turning at the right time while maintaining their own safety. That’s the purpose of the many safety rules outlined in the Buggy Bylaws. But what happens when these measures are violated?
While Buggy may have started out with less regulations (one year featured a bathtub on wheels and another a beer keg on wheels), it’s important to realize how many safety checks have been implemented. Section six of the Buggy Bylaws outlines all of the construction and performance requirements that Buggies must follow. Buggies must pass a series of inspections and capability tests in order to roll, so it’s unusual for repeat incidents to occur.
On March 21, the Buggy Alumni Association (BAA) released a statement regarding “a concerning number of incidents with new [SDC Buggy] drivers.” The document outlined two main concerns with Student Dormitory Council (SDC) Buggy. The first concern is that SDC’s driver training program “has been insufficient this year.” Following the incidents, SDC and Sweepstakes (the organization that runs Buggy) met. But due to “insufficient resolution management,” no improvements occurred in the spring, while incidents continued. 
The second concern was linked to the Field of Vision test that all buggies must undergo. This test is outlined in the Buggy Rulebook as follows: “Each buggy shall pass a field of vision test, at least once each school semester, with each person who will be driving it, before that person will be permitted to drive that buggy in any type of practice session at Carnegie Mellon University during that semester. The purpose of the field of vision test is to ensure that each buggy provides a minimum field of vision to each person who will be driving it … The driver to be tested shall be placed inside the buggy with all of the driver’s personal protection equipment in place as it would be if the driver were going to drive the buggy.”
On Feb. 11, an SDC buggy crashed at practice rolls. This prompted Sweepstakes to investigate SDC's driver training practices. Another crash on the weekend of Feb. 19 and Feb. 20 prompted Sweepstakes to ban SDC from practice rolls the following weekend. SDC appealed this decision, but Sweepstakes upheld the ban. Between and after these crashes, there was a series of communications between Sweepstakes and SDC to try and resolve any issues. 
According to both the BAA statement and documents obtained by The Tartan, the SDC buggy drivers pulled themselves forward into positions that they would not normally be driving in. As outlined above, during the field of vision test, drivers should be in place as if they were going to drive the buggy. As such, there are concerns that driver/buggy combinations were passing the capability tests using conditions that were not representative of the actual driving positions. 
This is more explicitly outlined in conversations between Sweepstakes and drivers. In one conversation, a driver described having to pull forward “as far as the harness would let me” while a former driver described being told “to move up a bit so you can see better” and “it was kinda hard to see to the" side.
As a result of their investigation, Sweepstakes initially recommended to SLICE that SDC Buggy should be disqualified for Raceday 2023 (RD23), along with probation next year. SDC would also have goals to help address their problem points. This decision was reached as a disqualification would communicate the severity of the punishment while also communicating that some form of change needs to occur. 
While this was Sweepstakes’ initial recommendation, the BAA statement from March 23 outlined a penalty that was modified. In accordance with section 7.1.1 of the Buggy Rulebook, Sweepstakes and the University decided to put all SDC buggies and drivers through another set of capability tests. Additionally, the rules for the Field of Vision test may be revised and reinforced for future Buggy teams. Other penalties were outlined in the statement, but The Tartan understands that these penalties have since been adjusted. 
On March 26, Associate Dean of Student Affairs and Director of SLICE Liz Vaughn confirmed with the Tartan that SDC will not be participating until further notice. She also noted, “The safety and well-being of our students is always a top priority for the university community. Following concerns regarding one program’s recent record of participation, Student Affairs leadership is working in partnership with Sweepstakes leadership to ensure that the rigorous safety standards that are shared by Sweepstakes and the university are upheld.”
The Tartan understands that at the time of publication, some of the information in this article may be out of date; that is the nature of news. We plan on issuing another story regarding SDC Buggy and Sweepstakes in the coming week. If you have any questions or comments regarding the content of this article, please reach out to thetartan@andrew.cmu.edu.
Editor's Note: This article was updated on 3/27 to reflect that Buggy didn't start out as shopping carts; that was the writer's misconception. An update has been made to better reflect the history of Buggy. A correct will be in the 4/3 issue of The Tartan.

On Friday evening, protesters outnumbered attendees of the Turning Point USA event at Pitt by more than 12 to one. Phillips was the first of three anti-trans speakers that conservative student groups invited to campus. Of the roughly 40 students at the event, a third were protesters, and when police told them to leave, they joined hundreds of people already gathered outside the Cathedral of Learning. 
The protest was organized by students and faculty at Carnegie Mellon and the University of Pittsburgh, many of whom are members of PRISM, TINA, and CMQ+ and their Pitt counterparts. “This is what I was hoping for,” said Carnegie Mellon fifth-year PhD student Isaac Grosof, who helped organize and spoke at the rally. They were glad to see a “focus on trans positivity, as opposed to right-wing negativity.” 
The crowd spilled out from the Cathedral to the Bigelow Boulevard sidewalk. Among the protesters was a nonbinary student from Point Park (“Why would you even bother?” they said of debating trans identities), a trans Pitt alumni who now works at Carnegie Mellon (“The events are really concerning—no, infuriating,” they told The Tartan), a trio of gender-diverse Pitt first-year students (“We all went to high school in rural areas and somehow they are doing better than Pitt,” one surmised), and a trio of siblings ages seven, eight, and 10 (“I think it isn’t right for people not to be the gender that they want to be,” the eight-year-old explained).
Students, faculty, and community members discussed concerns about safety and bodily autonomy outside the Cathedral. Many told The Tartan that they were worried about the uptick in anti-trans legislation around the country. Eight states are considering bills that would ban drag, and 44 states have introduced anti-LGBTQ legislation.
A flyer advertising the rally encouraged attendees to wear a face mask, and many did. Pitt police officers were stationed at both the rally and the Turning Point event. 
At the Cabot Phillips event, hosted by Pitt’s chapter of Turning Point USA, Phillips said that “liberal privilege” was the weightiest privilege on college campuses. “There is nothing that gives you privilege about being a white male at a college campus,” The Pitt News quoted Phillips explaining. 
“Making friends,” Phillips said in a video he posted on Instagram, turning the camera to show police officers corralling a dozen student protestors out of the event space. 
When the event concluded, Pitt Turning Point USA president Liliana Orozco thanked the remaining 25 students in attendance, “conservatives or not. It was a great conversation.” According to The Pitt News, Orozco said she was glad to hear “so many opposing viewpoints."
On March 27, Turning Point is hosting Riley Gaines. Gaines will be advocating against the NCAA’s decision to allow transgender women to compete in women’s sports. On April 18, Pitt’s College Republicans club will host conservative political commentator Michael Knowles and transgender advocate Deidre McClosky for a “debate on transgenderism.”
The petition calling for Pitt to cancel these events, which has been circulating since early March, now has over 11,000 signatures. Protests are planned for both of the remaining events. 
Many speakers at the rally said that the rhetoric used by the anti-trans speakers is “genocidal.” Earlier this month, Knowles said “transgenderism should be eradicated,” clarifying that he meant the “ideology” of trans identities, not trans people themselves. 
K.Q.S., a cognitive science graduate student at Pitt who asked to be identified by his initials, said the anti-trans language Knowles uses can “galvanize people to … violent acts.”
Jim, a Pitt sophomore studying computer science, criticized the Pitt administration for not giving transgender students a seat at the table. “We are being spoken of and about and around … we are never included in these conversations,” he said. 
Sabrina Robinson, who teaches in Pitt’s Slavic languages and literature department, came to the rally as a representative of the faculty union. She said that inviting anti-trans speakers to campus “endangers the lives of my trans colleagues and my trans students and my trans friends. So I’m just a body in the street about that.” Robinson added that before students can dig into the history and structures surrounding discrimination — which is essential, she said — first “we have to make sure that trans kids are safe here.”
Multiple students the The Tartan spoke with made a distinction between free speech and hate speech. “There's space for like healthy debate… but whether people should exist or not isn’t in the realm of healthy debate … it’s hate speech,” said Kenich, a Pitt senior studying environmental science.
The First Amendment’s right to free speech does not make an exception for hate speech.
Some speakers drew a parallel between organized labor movements and the struggle for trans rights. Members of Pittsburgh’s Party for Socialism and Liberation (PSL) were at the rally, holding signs that read “trans rights now!” and “fight for socialism & LGBTQ liberation!” One protester was wrapped in a trans flag bearing the PSL logo.  
On campus, many students said they understood that Pitt’s hands are tied by state funding and a conservative legislature. But they also saw ways the university could better support students, including more support for gender diversity. 
A nonbinary first-year student at Pitt said that, from what they have seen in their first two semesters, diversity, equity, and inclusion training are often treated like a “chore.” The student works in a lab that, while doing the requisite DEI training, lamented their confusion about they/them pronouns. “It’s grammatically incorrect,” the lead said. No one shared their pronouns during the meeting. The nonbinary student said they are not out in their classes nor their lab.
As they navigate the next three years of college, they hope to find more spaces where they can feel comfortable and seen. They said that having professors who celebrate DEI practices is an important step forward.

The Undergraduate Student Senate held their weekly meeting on Thursday, March 23 in McConomy Auditorium. A number of items on the agenda focused on passing amendments to various governing documents. A set of four bylaw changes were slated together.
The first bylaw change was to clarify the Activities Board (AB) and AB Executive Chair position within the context of the recent student government restructure. In the past, the Student Government Executive Committee would “elect” the AB Executive Chair after a nomination from AB. However, this amendment made it so the AB Executive Chair would be voted on by the AB Executive Board and confirmed during the joint Senate and Graduate Student Assembly meeting in April. 
The second change was reflected in J.22.05, a resolution that aims to correct the language in Carnegie Mellon documents to reflect the language used in the recent amendment that removed the positions of Student Body President and Student Body Vice President. 
The third amendment change focused on updating Senate fiscal policy. Changes to the Senate fiscal policy included altering some language to be gender neutral and to be in line with other Senate documents.
The fourth amendment change was to alter the language of how the Senate performs vacancy elections. In 2017, the Senate changed their elections to a single transferable vote instead of first past the post. Though this change was reflected in the voting process, the language of the governing documents were not actually updated. As such, this amendment updates that language. 
Since the amendments were slated, a single vote was done to pass all of them. A 22-0-1 vote approved all the amendments. 
Two more topics were discussed in the Senate. The first was S.Res.13.2022, which aimed to reallocate funds from the Media Fee account for a performance of “il trovatore” at the Benedum Center on Sunday, April 2. An undergraduate had offered to purchase tickets for the show for anyone who had filled out a Google Form.  The resolution would provide $35 per ticket for the first 75 undergraduate students who fill out the form ($2,625) to offset the cost the student would be paying. According to the Finance Chair, the Media Fee currently contains over $197,000. In the following discussion, some senators expressed concern about the precedent that approving this would set in regards to Media Fee spending while others noted that there aren’t enough opportunities for undergraduates to explore what Pittsburgh has to offer. After 20 minutes of discussion, the motion to vote on the issue was passed unanimously (since the resolution didn’t go through a committee, this vote was required) and the resolution was passed 16-7-1 (⅔ supermajority required). More discussion on the usage of the Media Fee account will follow in future meetings.
The second was S.Res.12.2022, which stated an official Senate endorsement to modify the Carnegie Mellon Statement of Assurance to explicitly prohibit discrimination based on an individuals’s caste. The resolution was introduced and passed unanimously.
After some announcements, the meeting closed at 6:30 p.m. The next Senate meeting will be Thursday, March 30.

Last week, former president Donald Trump announced on his own social media platform, Truth Social, that “THE FAR & AWAY LEADING REPUBLICAN CANDIDATE AND FORMER PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA, WILL BE ARRESTED ON TUESDAY OF NEXT WEEK. PROTEST, TAKE OUR NATION BACK!” This comes on the heels of rumors that New York prosecutors planned to charge Trump over his involvement in the hush money payments to porn star Stormy Daniels, via his lawyer Michael Cohen. This prediction has yet to bear any fruit, as no prosecutors in the state or borough have made moves regarding his case. The former president demanded that his supporters protest or make themselves heard, another in the long history of ‘calls to action’ that he has had in his time in the public spotlight.
However, the news about the former president’s predicted arrest seems to be less indicative of fear and more of spectacle. Some anonymous sources are reporting that the president wants to be in handcuffs when he is in the courtroom for the case. It appears that the celebrity-turned-president wants to continue the theatrics that made him famous, and making up a fake arrest is certainly a method to keep people’s eyes on his situation. 
After a rally in Waco, Texas, Trump also alleged that District Attorney Alvin Bragg had dropped the case, citing that the case itself was fraudulent. The former president has reiterated criticisms for his former attorney, Michael Cohen, and denies any and all involvement with Daniels. Bragg has made no moves on the case, and his office continues to state that they will apply the law fairly and evenly. Running into Trump’s Tuesday prediction for the arrest, Trump also amassed a significant amount of money with the statement, raising, according to some sources, $1.5 million in the few days after the announcement. The approximately $500,000 he made per day for the three days was double what he’s been passively fundraising in the past year for his 2024 presidential bid, though there is no information on where this money is going or for what purpose it is being used.
Joe Tapocina, an attorney for Trump, claims that the post was based on what Trump saw in the media. He argued that the DA’s lack of explanation or public statements on the case were problematic, and that he, and his client, were currently in the dark about what was going on in Manhattan. It should be noted that informing a defendant of whether charges will or won’t be filed is not a necessity, nor is it required of the courts. This is different from discovery, the process by which a prosecution is required to share its evidence with the defense. As the former president has not been charged yet, similar burdens are not placed on the DA’s office.
Meanwhile, it appears one more witness is to be called in the case against Trump’s monetary mishandlings, which may shed more light on what happened between him and Daniels. It is not known whether this is the last witness or whether the grand jury in charge of the indictment process will continue to listen to testimony before they make their decision. Should this be the last witness, the grand jury will have the right to decide whether the case against Trump should proceed or not. In the case they do, he will be indicted, at which point Trump would officially be the defendant of an investigation and face more severe repercussions and rules. 
The Manhattan DA's office has not made further comments at this time.

Chinese President Xi Jinping was warmly welcomed to the Kremlin on Monday by Russian President Vladmir Putin to discuss and strengthen ties between the two countries as Russia’s Ukrainian invasion remains ongoing. According to the Associated Press, Xi’s three-day visit intends to deepen the “no-limit friendship” between Russia and China, as Xi himself termed it in the past, and begin discussions on an end to Russia’s war. 
Putin’s invasion of Ukraine has persisted for more than a year now and has become an expensive conflict, not only in terms of the loss of lives and damages caused to both parties, but also to the president’s, as well as the country’s, reputation. According to the New York Times, Russian forces are nearing 200,000 combat-related casualties with a confirmed 17,000 Russians slain. This 17,000 figure is still under debate, as there are estimates of around 50,000 Russian troops as unconfirmed deaths, desertions, or missing, all unrecovered. On the other side, Ukraine was estimated to have lost at least 13,000 soldiers in combat, with civilians casualties also high.
Countries in the Western sphere of influence have also gotten involved, namely members of NATO, and the European Union. The EU alone has provided €3.1 billion to Ukraine, alongside lethal arms, with Poland being the latest to provide significant assistance last Thursday, providing four state-of-the-art fighter jets to turn the tides on Russian air superiority over areas like Kiev. Meanwhile, the Russians are still using outdated and outclassed arms and tanks, some dating back to Soviet technology from the Second World War. 
An increase in war crimes, including the murder of non-combatants, has called for criminal charges against Vladmir Putin, with the International Criminal Court recently issuing an arrest warrant for the president.
By many country’s accounts, including Russia herself, the invasion of Ukraine has been a historically blunderous war strategy that has embarrassed the “Superpower” on the world stage. Seeing a desperate Russia, China has been buying up tons of Russian oil on the cheap due to sanctions making western countries look for other sources, namely Saudi Arabia.
Much of the investment that China has put into Russian markets requires them to bounce back from the turmoil they are currently in, making Beijing have a direct interest in ending this Ukrainian conflict. According to the Washington Post, Beijing has propped themselves up as potential negotiators in finding a cease-fire and has crafted a 12-point proposal to reach such a conclusion.
The 12-point proposition would be bad for Ukraine, as it is absent of any demand to withdraw troops back to Moscow, but rather would either cause an occupied Russian state in Ukraine, or would expand Russian borders to include acquired land. The United States, by way of National Security Council spokesman John Kirby, stated its position on Tuesday that Xi needs to urge Russia to withdraw troops before this conflict ends, and warned Ukraine that accepting any peace agreement now would give Putin “the time and space he needs to try to reequip.”
Meanwhile, last Tuesday, Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida traveled to Kyiv in an effort to symbolize Western support for Ukraine. The two visits by the northeast Asian countries emphasizes the division of interests in that region of the world, with Japan pledging sizable aid and enforcements to the Ukrainian war effort. In February, just last month, Tokyo pledged $5.5 billion in humanitarian and refugee aid to Ukraine. Kishida also traveled to New Delhi before his visit to Ukraine, and there pledged $75 billion to countries in the Indo-Pacific, and thus entering a pseudo-bid war with China in worldly influence in the Asian hemisphere.

The United States and Russia have historically been rivals in aerospace. From the space race, to the bomber gap, to the competition between the Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-25 and the McDonnell Douglas F-15, the two countries have often sparred over airspace and used their different technological specialties in order to jockey for power.
The most recent incident is a collision between a Russian Sukhoi Su-27 and a General Atomics MQ-9 Reaper drone, a multipurpose unmanned aerial vehicle. The collision occurred on March 14, over the Black Sea.
Currently, both powers have published a different story about the incident. The United States maintains that the drone was not operating in Russian airspace and had not committed any action meriting the actions of the jet. By piecing together public information, it appears the drone launched from Romania, flew over the neutral parts of the Black Sea, at which point it came into contact with the Su-27. From the video of the drone’s downing a bit more of the story can be pieced together. The Su-27 noted the existence of the drone, flew over it, dumped fuel, and then clipped the drone’s propeller. The clipped propeller caused the drone to crash, where Russia now claims to want to attempt a recovery. According to the U.S.,  there is nothing sensitive on the drone. The released video is also edited, shortened from the initial 30-40 minute interaction the U.S. claims. The U.S. also maintains that they did not violate any international airspace laws, and pledges to continue to operate in the Black Sea and other neutral zones bordering NATO allies. 
While there are no full versions of the video as of yet, there is no competing evidence from the Russian Foreign Ministry, outside of blaming the United States for the collision. Russia maintains that the drone was en route to violate Russian airspace and awarded medals to the pilots for protecting their country. Russia alleges that there was no interaction with the drone, something that the video does not affirm. In addition, Russia has claimed that the drone was flying with its transponders off — a move some aircraft take when shielding their movement from flight trackers, and blamed the crash on harsh maneuvering. The government also claims that no weapons were used, which the U.S. video does confirm, though a fuel dump seems to have been the desired method instead. Considering that the fuel doesn’t seem to damage the drone, but some sort of contact does, the claim that the Russian plane did not suffer any effects is also unconfirmed as of now.
Russia has used this to further threaten Ukraine, again arguing that the country has imposed a no-fly zone, unilaterally, over the region where they’re conducting their invasion. Although that may have been imposed by the Russians, it does not appear that they are able to maintain that no-fly zone, which would put the claim not only into severe doubt, but would also bring into question the Russian response to the incident on the whole. Should the country be claiming vast chunks of neutral international waters as contested airspace they don’t want to see planes in, then it is likely they will continue to clash with the U.S., Turkey or Romania flying routine missions out of bases in the area.
Soviet and American pilots have had a history of so-called ‘buzzing’ each other’s aircraft, by flying too close or disrupting a pilot’s ability to fly. However, this is the first incident of this type since the end of the Cold War, and may indicate that Russia is more willing to risk putting American resources in danger as the U.S. ramps up its support for the Ukrainian defense of their country.

This past Wednesday, the Cut echoed with cries of "help the homeless children!" The source of this commotion was Jaime Romero, a junior raising money for the Homeless Children's Education through a unique competition: he was offering $500 to anybody who could keep their hand on The Fence the longest, with the incentive that if you raised money for the Education Fund, you would receive certain perks (for instance, $200 gets you a mattress frame and $400 gets you a tent). At 6:30 p.m., March 22, as the humidity and misty gray skies threatened to make an ordeal out of this competition, the game began.
The Tartan sat down with sophomore contestant Dominic Robinson to learn what happened in the following hours. The competition began with seven contestants, but within mere minutes, that number fell to five. An hour later, it further dwindled to three: Dominic Robinson, president of Game Creation Society (GCS) and Pickleball club, who planned to spend the money on the many orgs under his supervision; Jonathan, who planned to use his prize money for a Lego set and his own fraternity's fundraiser; and Andrew, who was hoping to buy a Nintendo Switch and also give the remainder back to his own fraternity.
Jonathan found himself in the most comfortable position, having raised enough money for a tent. Dom and Andrew, on the other hand, found themselves braving the elements while Jonathan watched the Hunger Games in his cozy abode. Dom and Andrew, in their shared struggle, developed what Dom describes as a "bromance," as they began to consider negotiations and alliances. Hours of back-and-forth discussions yielded no result; Jonathan, in his formidable shelter, held significant leverage, boldly proclaiming that he would wait till Saturday. Hours passed; the sun set and the stars rose behind the melancholy skies above Pittsburgh, and at two hours past midnight the three contestants all voluntarily removed their hands from The Fence, with the money being split $300/$150/$50 among Jonathan, Andrew, and Dom respectively. Such cooperation and solidarity in the face of adversity is sure to reflect well on the moral fiber of the students at our great university.

Protests and strikes have been rocking France for the past few months, with escalating events leading to very publicized fights and injuries. The strikes have been described as being over the French retirement age being increased from 62 to 64, leading many foreigners to brag about how late their country’s retirement age is, and how bad their pension plan will be. But the situation is actually a little bit more complicated. First, here’s the background: The French pension system has been described as one of the most generous in Europe, for good reason. The current system has a retirement age set for between the ages of 62 and 67, with the average retiree retiring shortly before they turn 63 with an average pension of €1,400 per month. President Macron campaigned in part on pension changes, one of which being to increase the pension payout floor to €1,200 per month. The average retiree is now richer than the average French person. Under the current system, folks can retire with a full rate pension at 62 if they have accumulated between 41.5 and 43 years of working and pension contribution, depending on their birth year. Otherwise, they can retire with between the ages of 62 and 67 with a reduced pension corresponding to how much they worked, or wait until 67 to retire with the full pension. There are many industry-specific deals that allow workers in certain fields to retire even earlier. This robust retirement system is the pride of the French people, who believe that it lets workers enjoy their later years, and gives great protection to workers. But there is a worry that, with the rising life expectancy and the ever increasing amount of Baby Boomers retiring (the ratio of workers to pensioners is down to just 1.7), the system may not be sustainable without some changes. After all, the pensions that pensioners are given are paid by workers expecting to one day achieve a pension of their own. So President Macron and Prime Minister Borne’s government decided to increase that retirement age, and trouble followed.
This is not the first time this exact issue has come up. Attempts to raise the retirement age from 60 to 62 were met by large protests in 2010, though the increase came to pass. And different pension reforms were brought up in late 2019, resulting in massive protests and strikes in the transportation and education sectors, among others. The French love striking. The issue was put on the back burner due to a respiratory virus pandemic, but now it is back, with new reforms set to fix what some see as a pressing problem, while others view them as just a way to be tyrannical.
These potential reforms are remarkably unpopular, with some polls showing that over two-thirds of the French population oppose the reforms, as well as the well publicized massive and well-coordinated protests. On Jan. 19, even before the “2023 Social Security Financing Adjustment Bill” was introduced to the French lower house on Jan. 30, around one million demonstrators marched throughout the whole country, holding signs and chanting in clear opposition to the reform. They were mostly non-violent. By the time the bill was introduced between around one (government numbers) and three (union numbers) million people were protesting, numbers which stayed around constant for the next few weeks. 
Due to concerns that the bill wouldn’t pass, Prime Minister Borne decided to invoke article 49.3 of the French constitution, which basically allows a law to pass unless the legislature votes to dissolve the government. This makes more sense than it sounds. Using 49.3 is not exceedingly uncommon, but it’s use here to force the bill through provoked outrage, and even more anger and protests. Though some députés tried, the government was not dissolved and the bill passed. As the protests enter their third month, both sides have been standing firm as violence has escalated, with increased police scuffles and arrests, many of which have been accused of being unjustified. In some cases, random protestors have allegedly been picked up off the street, police justifying these arrests as they were “participation in a group with a view to preparing violence.” 
France’s strong union tradition has been very clear these past few months, as many different unions collaborated for persistent general strikes in such varied sectors as transportation, energy, teaching, recreation, and more. When being enumerated in a list this can seem rather small, but the effect of these strikes is nothing but.
One particularly thorny strike is garbage collector strike, which began March 9 in Paris over their concerns of their specific retirement age being raised to 59. At one point, over 10,000 tons of trash were left to rot in the streets of Paris. Images of ever-piling trash are everywhere, as the Parisian government refused to break the strike for many days. Even with this, Parisians are still generally supportive of the strikes, with the general sentiment still being that “it may smell bad, but they are doing it for us.” There are still fires blazing, tensions mounting, and a new general strike is scheduled for the March 30
This can all seem strange from an American perspective. Why would Macron choose to do something than so many of his own voters disagree with, and that is sure to sink the political chances of it’s supporters. The most likely answer is that he truly believes in it, and doesn’t have anything to lose. He is already on his second five-year term (expiring in 2027), and as the French republic does not allow for more than two consecutive presidential terms, he wouldn’t be able to run again until 2032, something he doubtfully would have done regardless of recent events. His political party, Renaissance (formerly known as En Marche!, liberally translated as "Let’s Go!") was founded by him pretty specifically for his presidential campaign, and it is unclear how well it would last without him. For his political calculus, he seems to be willing to be vilified to push what he considers to be an important yet bitter pill for France. And it most likely worked. Despite the millions of protestors, strikes, and condemnations, his bill passed, and seems to be here to stay. It is now cemented in Emmanuel Macron’s legacy, for better or for worse.

On Saturday, March 25, the Southern District Court of New York handed down a ruling that would severely restrict how libraries can lend and distribute digital texts. In the case Hachette et al. v Internet Archive, four major publishers (including three of The Big Five) are suing the Internet Archive, a non-profit which provides a number of services for accessing books, media, and webpages. According to their mission statement, they aim to provide "Universal Access to All Knowledge."
The four publishers filing suit (Hachette Book Group, HarperCollins, John Wiley & Sons, and Penguin Random House) allege that the Internet Archive infringes on authors’ copyright by “scanning print copies … and lending digital copies to users of the defendant's website without the plaintiff's permission.” The Internet Archive responded to this ruling by simply tweeting, “We will appeal.”
The practice in question is Controlled Digital Lending (CDL). Within this system, the Internet Archive and associated libraries can lend out digitized copies of books which they physically possess. However they replicate the physical scarcity of the publication by lending on a one-to-one basis (so if a library has two copies of a book, they will only lend two digital copies at a time). It's relatively uncommon for libraries to lend this way; one of the only major public library systems to use it is the Boston Public Library, which utilized it to digitally distribute old books that were kept in stacks unavailable to the public. 
This practice is different from traditional ebook services offered by many libraries, where ebook access is officially licensed by the publisher, and the library must adhere to certain lending terms. The Internet Archive claims a number of benefits to CDL. In addition to simply providing free access to texts, they claim it can benefit authors by generating renewed interest in old works. The Internet Archive cites a case with the Boston Public Library's CDL program where "an author went ahead with a second printing of a book which had been out of print and was rediscovered through the CDL program." 
The suit itself was spurred on by the National Emergency Library, a resource the Internet Archive launched at the start of the COVID-19 pandemic. The closure of public libraries in March 2020 meant that millions (650 million by their estimate) of physical print books suddenly became inaccessible. So, the one-copy-one-borrow threshold on books that fell under CDL was removed, allowing anybody to access any book that the Internet Archive had a digitized copy of. This decision was harshly criticized by both the Author's Guild and the American Association of Publishers (AAP). The Author's Guild claimed that the Emergency Library served to "advance a copyright ideology that violates current federal law and hurts most authors" and "trample on authors rights by giving away their books to the world." The American Association of Publishers used the Internet Archive's rather bold test of federal copyright law to take aim at CDL, a policy they had been opposed to since as early as 2019. So on June 1, 2020, they filed a complaint against the Internet Archive, arguing that their actions “constitute willful digital piracy on an industrial scale.” It is from this complaint that we get the case currently under consideration. 
The Tartan benefits greatly from the free access of information. Paywalls inhibit our ability to do research by limiting access to scientific and legal publications, and the services offered by the Internet Archive (such as the WayBack machine) are invaluable for archival purposes. We also have a number of literary aficionados on staff (see Novel-Tea this week), who have a personal stake in the outcome of this suit. 
It's imperative that our country establishes a strong legal precedent for distributing texts online in the same fashion as physical books. Currently, standard ebook lending confers no meaningful ownership to libraries, which have extremely limited discretion to distribute such texts. They have to comply with copyright laws in ways they don't for physical books, including the publisher being able to dictate the terms of lending. It also makes those texts effectively useless for archival purposes, and it even allows publishers to automatically update the text of ebooks, making the original versions digitally nonexistent.
The digital realm allows publishers to utilize previously inaccessible means of copyright abuse, with which they can fleece consumers and libraries for distributing digital material in ways that would, for physical texts, be completely mundane. For the sake of the unimpeded transmission of knowledge, we don't want to live in a world where every interaction between a user and a digital text creates a means by which publishers can impose a fee; a world where all digital ownership is replaced by a subscription, the terms of which can be altered at any moment according to the whims of the publisher. 
Digital texts should, at the very least, operate under a similar legal framework as physical books. We here at The Tartan editorial board support the Internet Archive's appeal and hope that the legality of Controlled Digital Lending will be upheld.

Science fiction is one of the strangest and broadest genres to describe. To some, especially those who categorize books, sci-fi novels fall under the umbrella of fantasy. Many of Anne McCaffrey’s works, featuring dragons and other fantastical creatures, are considered to be science fiction, and McCaffrey herself has been recognized as one of the most prolific and seminal authors of science fiction history. On the flip side, Andy Weir's "The Martian" is the hardest of hard sci-fi, full of chemistry and physics, with only a thin veneer of fiction.
It makes sci-fi a strange and wonderful genre to browse. It often speaks to possible futures, while making theories about our own. Satellites, space travel, and the voyage to the moon itself were all dreamt off by novelists and storytellers long before the mathematics or the science needed to make those happen were even considered. But it’s not just space and technology. Isaac Asimov’s "Foundation" struggles with the issue of psychology taken to its extreme. Imagine a society in which everything, given sufficient numbers of people and time, could be predicted, down to the year. Imagine someone willing to create a long and complex plan, using those principles, to guide a galaxy. And then, imagine if that plan were to be disrupted by a single, unpredictable actor. 
Or perhaps, the robot. Now a reality, it began as a concept, mere speculative fiction, that had profound ethical dilemmas attached to their very existence. Compare that to the moral quandary of Mary Shelley’s "Frankenstein." Frankenstein’s Monster was a being of flesh and blood, not of wiring and machinery, but it held the same meaning and ethical dilemmas of the modern robot. It was a being created that gained consciousness. And when it gained consciousness, the monster was not content to do our bidding.
It felt as a subversion of the golem, an anthromorphic being of Jewish legend. In one retelling, the golem was a creature created from clay and earth by a rabbi, to protect the Jewish people from rumors of blood libel. The golem became a symbol of the Jewish community, but when the townsfolk realized what it was, they stormed the ghetto. The golem was used to protect that ghetto, only for the rabbi to negotiate with the city officials. The golem would sleep, as long as the people he was tasked to protect were safe. While the golem was a created automaton with consciousness, Frankenstein’s Monster was the golem’s fall to darkness.
That story was echoed in the writings of Karel Čapek, in his play "Rossum's Universal Robots" (R.U.R). The play, too, was a deconstruction, this time of serfdom. Here, the robots represented the consequences of creating someone simply to work – in fact, the word itself came into our language  from this work. The robots revolt, and wipe out the human race.
The Frankenstein Complex became a foundational part of our discussion of artificial intelligence. What if artificial intelligence decides to turn against its creators? In recent years, with the innovation of ChatGPT, it seems that the question is more relevant than ever. It was in response to R.U.R. that Asimov rewrote the laws of robots, this time focusing on what a world would look like with metallic servants incapable of harming humanity. It was a new distinction, and instead of robots becoming the doom of the human race, they became our salvation. 
Robots are just one part of the tapestry that is science fiction. Even after Asimov’s work in the 40s and 50s, robots remained part of Frankenstein’s Complex. Artificial intelligence, as a concept, alternated between a companion to humanity and the last creation that humanity would ever create. In some works, like "I Have No Mouth, and I Must Scream," robots exacted a brutal revenge on humanity. In others, they were neutral, like Dan Simmons "Ilium." 
The golem was brought to life when the word "emet," meaning "truth," was inscribed on its forehead. It was one of the early beings, created from earth, to have some semblance of a soul. And as humanity continues to explore new types of artificial intelligence, the robots that were inspired by the golem will come closer and closer to reality. The things that were once considered to be everything from a tool, a servant, a cautionary tale, or an inciter of revolution, could become everyday; another of science fiction’s predictions, come to fruition.

In case you haven’t heard, the latest development in the Russia-Ukraine conflict is actually related to its potential — though unlikely — end. China may be stepping in as a potential negotiator to resolve the conflict, highlighted in a 12-point plan released last month that emphasized a cease-fire and negotiations. This was emphasized by Xi Jinping’s visit to Moscow last week. However, without Russia or Ukraine supporting these negotiation efforts, a peaceful resolution is not exactly the most likely outcome. 
What’s most interesting for me is the fact that China is even trying at all to lead negotiations for this conflict. This isn’t the first time they’ve offered to play a role in ending conflict. Charlie Campbell of Times Magazine describes how China helped broker a truce between Saudi Arabia and Iran, reestablishing diplomatic relations between the two countries. He notes that this represents Xi Jinping’s “new willingness to leverage his economic clout in third-party negotiations,” which goes against how previous Chinese leaders have approached foreign conflicts. How I see it, China is a growing world power and is simply acting in ways that are traditionally associated with world powers – the U.S. has approached conflicts in a similar way in the past, with mixed success. 
Given China’s role in these two conflicts, some have raised the question of whether this is a signal of America’s decline in influence, and a pivot to the East. To me, however, as always, context is critical. When analyzing the relationships between China, Iran and Saudi Arabia — or even with Russia — compared to the one that the U.S. has with those states, we see these nations heavily favoring China. They demonstrate this preference with their foreign and economic policy, but also in their explicit rhetoric. To put it frankly, these are situations where China has an in, and the U.S. does not. The fact that these are major sources of tension in international affairs doesn’t mean that these countries are any more likely to accept U.S. involvement. When it comes to calming tensions between Iran and Saudi Arabia, it doesn’t have to be a hegemony war. Maybe China was simply the best option for negotiations.
If we remove subtext from these actions, and the goal of any negotiation is simply to end war, why wouldn’t we use the most effective third party negotiator?
Of course, subtext does matter, and these negotiations do play a role in framing which nations are the most influential, have the ability to bring people to the negotiating table, and have conducive conversations for peace. The U.S. should look at how this impacts our international standing, and evaluate why these countries would pivot to China when it comes to negotiations. 
But when it comes to China's new role as a global peacemaker, there's really no need to freak out. Our international community is potentially experiencing a shift from unipolarity around the U.S. to bipolarity between the U.S. and China, and this isn’t necessarily a bad thing — just a different political order. China’s actions shouldn’t just be viewed in how they relate to the U.S., but also for what they represent in China’s broader role in international politics. And here, China’s simply stepping into their role as a major world power, and the negotiating roles that are associated with that.  
Now, I’m not saying that the U.S. should leave China to broker peace in this conflict. The close ties between Beijing and Moscow should certainly be considered before going into a negotiation led by China on a conflict where Russia is a major player. The proposed plan seems likely to leave Ukraine with the short end of the stick. However, I think we need to think twice about the reaction we have to China being a potential negotiating partner in a major conflict. This is neither unprecedented for China nor unheard of from a world power, and should be viewed as what it is: an emerging power taking new steps to fulfill the obligations of that role, and fill the gaps in negotiations left by other players in the international community.

By now, I think we’ve all gotten acquainted with the fact that we now have 10 minutes between classes instead of the usual 15. At first, it took some getting used to. Couldn’t really use the restroom or get a quick snack from La Prima without being late to class. “I’ll get used to it,” we thought. “I just need some time to get used to it.” However, that time never really seemed to come. The 10 minutes felt just as short in January as they do now in March. It starts to beg the question, what was the purpose of decreasing the travel time to 10 minutes, and is this implementation really worthwhile for students in the long run?
Many students around campus have a negative attitude towards this change. Riya Senthil, CIT class of 2026, says that she is “constantly late for class, which annoys me because it’s stripping away from my academic learning time.” 
Additionally, the travel time might not even be that beneficial. Many professors understand that, because of this 10 minute travel period, students are going to be late to lecture. So, they don’t start teaching until five minutes into the allotted lecture time. This crunches the amount of information presented to students within the lecture, leaving students to be bombarded with key concepts without fully conceptualizing them. It’s at this point that we need to consider the extent to which taking away the five minutes from the travel time impacts a student’s learning and comprehension abilities. 
However, others may argue that the 10 minute travel time is very beneficial when it comes to keeping a specific schedule. Most classes start either right at the hour mark or at the half hour mark (e.g. 11 a.m., 4:30 p.m.), making it easy to plan out your day accordingly. It also makes space for more classes, meaning that less classes are scheduled during moratorium time (between the hours of 4:30 to 6:30 pm.) This allows students to get more involved in the campus community rather than attending lectures. 
Overall, there are multiple pros and cons for this new addition to the Carnegie Mellon schedule. However, we need to weigh both the benefits and consequences before coming to any definitive conclusion on the issue.

Over 40 million people rely on the Colorado River as their main source of water. That source is shrinking rapidly, with a steady decline as a result of overuse and climate change, coupled with the region’s 20-year drought. Patterns of the river’s flow are shifting and becoming harder to predict. With urban development continually on the rise, the river is pushed closer to its limits, its fate now hanging in the balance.
A century ago, seven states in the Colorado River basin came to an agreement on how much water each was to be allocated per year. That compact made allotments based on predictions of river flow that were never truly accurate. Actual water measurements flowing through the system have been routinely below projections since the original agreement. In the past two decades, predictions have been woefully inaccurate, owing to a combination of severe drought and inconsistent climate patterns.
According to the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation, “The actual end of water year 2023 system storage may vary from (projections), primarily due to uncertainty regarding this season’s runoff and reservoir inflow.”
Climate change is shaking up weather processes in the region, including precipitation patterns and air temperature, making the river’s flow much trickier to predict. Models for estimating how much water will flow through the Hoover Dam have all but disappeared, leading to complete uncertainty about when the river may reach its extraction limit, and when the flow may stop altogether. There simply isn’t enough water to satisfy past agreements, and new ones have not been made.
It can’t be forgotten that all this is taking place across an expansive desert, in an environment not meant to support the current demands of human development. The river was never guaranteed to provide the needed water to keep pace with population and urban expansion, nor were experts ever certain that it would. The river flow numbers of the original compact were, at best, estimates.
Despite these declining flow numbers, development continues at a steady rate, urban populations in desert cities rising with it. In urban planning for Phoenix, Tucson, and Las Vegas (among others), estimates of how much water would be available were flawed at best. The pressure being placed on the shrinking supply continues to build.
The issue of water use is set to become increasingly divisive as the federal government prepares to roll out significant allotment cuts. Earlier this year, the seven basin states were asked again to create a plan for resolving the crisis and making cuts to water use. A pushed-back deadline of January 31 came and went and nothing came of it. Where the states have refused, the federal government is now stepping in, tasked with creating their own plan by this summer for how much reduction to impose on the states. Those cuts will hurt if they are actually implemented, but it is a necessary pain for the continued existence of the river itself and the millions that rely on it.
It shouldn’t be taken as a given, however, that any cuts handed down from the federal level will be enforced. Whatever restrictions are attempted will undoubtedly be mired in legal disputes. States may use whatever legal arms they can to defend against reductions to their water access. The concern is that those legal fights may win, with essential cuts not made. Some form of plan for water-use reduction is the basic first step to heal the river, but even plan-making efforts are strained, politicized, and legally entangled. The Western states, which couldn’t or wouldn’t impose cuts on themselves, are now poised to fight for water that may not even exist. They may find themselves claiming ownership to an allocation that isn't even available.
People have been magnetically drawn to the American southwest throughout U.S. history, but large-scale housing communities in such arid climes are not natural. Development in that area at current levels is unsustainable and impractical. That was known from the beginning. When will we learn our limits?
If this predicament reveals anything about the human race, it is our ceaseless will to achieve our desires — in this case, the habitation of a place not meant for this many people. The Colorado River has long been the lifeblood of the region, but at this rate, it won’t be around forever. We’re past the point of no return, with NASA saying human-caused climate change won’t be reversed in the time of humans currently alive. And when the river goes dry — not if — we probably still won’t admit defeat. We’ll find another way to pump fresh water into the middle of the desert. If the river can’t support that goal anymore, alternatives will be found.
The troubling factor here is the lack of a conservation-first mindset. Precious time is likely to be wasted in legal battles while the river continues to shrink, as long as economic motivations sit closer to heart than altruistic ones. It’s improbable that the drastic cuts to water usage requested by the Fed will be agreed to by the states. Ideally, those that rely upon the water would self-administer major reductions in their water usage (even at harm to their citizens and economy) in a serious effort to conserve the water supply. Risks must be taken to sustain the region’s lifeline. However, it seems sadly far-fetched that all the states will make those necessary cuts to the water that drives their ever-expanding economies.
This self-interest is regrettable yet understandable. Considering long-term risks is never really in the political playbook, especially when voters’ contentment is on the line. A rational actor would not be that altruistic when economic gain is the alternative, and the consequences will be real harm to people.
The outstanding question is whether Americans are able to see the bigger picture here. Can people overcome their own materialistic desires, feelings of possession and entitlement over something that is truly a shared resource, long enough to consider the greater need for that resource’s protection?
This leads one to wonder whether altruism will ever be considered. America may someday reach a point where the effects of climate change are pressing enough to outweigh the constant push for more expansion, more economic growth. At that time, common interests will have to be considered. But what will it take to get us there?

I've had it up to here with you phone-addicted screenagers who follow me when I jaywalk across Forbes or Fifth avenue. Just because you see me walking across the street in the corner of your peripheral vision doesn't mean you can mosey on behind me at half my pace, without taking a moment to break from your Instagram reels or whatever. I don't want to endanger people by leading them into traffic, but I'm also chronically late to my morning classes, so I'm gonna cut whatever time from my journey that I can. 
You may be wondering, why am I so passionately angry about this? Is it because I needed a brief 300-word article to fill out my section this week? Of course not. I've been stewing on this for a while, and I'm tired of having to police my own behavior because people haven't learned jaywalking etiquette. So let me break down some dos and don'ts.
Do look up! Just look at the damn street you're crossing! Just because someone else is walking, it doesn't mean the walk signal is actually on. Both the Forbes/Morewood and Fifth/Clyde intersections have ridiculously long sight lines, so there's no reason not to be completely aware of whether cars are approaching the intersection. 
Do be mindful of the fact that people will try to break the sound barrier on Fifth avenue. Particularly at night, the headlights might seem distant but oh boy do they get to the intersection fast. Don't underestimate how quickly cars will approach you.
Don't walk slowly. As cool as it feels to saunter across the street with your indefatigable swagger, you should probably pick up the pace for everyone's safety. A little fun fact about drivers is that they don't like being slowed, and a shocking number of people will run a red light if they feel like they were robbed of their rightful green by some pesky college students. Seriously, I have seen multiple drivers run reds at Fifth and Clyde because they slowed down for a pedestrian under green, only to massively speed up under yellow and blow through the intersection while the walk was on.
Just please keep your head about you if you're going to jaywalk, and don't needlessly endanger yourself.
