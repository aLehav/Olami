This spring has been tough for all teams involved. Look for excitement in the chute due to the lack of practice and the quicker-than-normal ramp-up of speed by most teams. Let’s jump right into the predictions:
The women’s races will see five A teams and one B team in the top six. Starting off at sixth place will be the women of SPIRIT A. The PiKA women will barely edge out SPIRIT with a better downhill performance, good enough for fifth place.
At the line in fourth place, we will see SDC B with one of its many fast buggies. A strong women’s push team will place the SigEp women in third place. Next, the second-place trophy will be taken by Fringe A, once again falling to a stronger SDC.
SDC A women will catapult one of their quick buggies to another first-place finish.
Tenth place for the men will belong to CIA A with its moderate speed and comparatively weaker push team. Next we have Fringe, who will skate into the ninth spot with its B team.
Following close behind will be SPIRIT's B team. SPIRIT has been looking stronger than ever in both pushing and the freeroll. SDC’s dominance as of late will see its C team slide into the seventh spot for the men’s races.
Finishing before SDC C will be SPIRIT A with a sixth-place finish. Expect SPIRIT to improve on its performance from recent race days with a better roll and a quality push team. SDC B will place well ahead of SPIRIT A for a fifth-place finish, accounting for one of SDC’s three top-10 teams.
The fourth-place trophy will go to Fringe A. Fringe will see a weaker finish than in years past due to the absence of Bonsai — one of their top buggies — on the course and the teams' apparent lack of organization this year. Expect PiKA to finish at a respectable third place with its new small buggy and average A-team pushers.
SigEp A with their impressive downhill performance and strong push team will edge out PiKA and Fringe for the second spot on the leader board.
Ultimately, no one will challenge SDC A with its polished buggy, push team, and knowledgeable mechanics. SDC will take home the first-place men’s trophy for the second year in a row.
As always, I will see everyone at the races, but you will not see me.
The Field:
SDC: It’s about time they add a third win.
CIA: Are you compensating for something with your B1R?
Fringe: Where are your buggies? It’s time to start rolling.
PiKA: Tiny buggy team… tiny push team.
SigNu: If your buggy was the size of your chapter you might have a shot… for Day Two
SAE: Better at painting lions.
Apex: Congratulations for getting your training wheels off.
ROTC: Stick to drones.
SPIRIT: You won term 2, doesn’t really matter you’re still going to lose.
AEPi: Who?

Carnegie Mellon’s club roller hockey team has rolled off to a phenomenal season, currently standing at an undefeated 14–0 in the Western Pennsylvania Collegiate Roller Hockey League (WPACRHL).
The Tartans have faced off against Geneva College, Duquesne University, Slippery Rock University, Penn State Beaver, Clarion University, and the Community College of Allegheny County South in the Tier 3 division of the WPACHRL. In their 14 wins, they have scored 100 goals while only allowing 36, and the team leads the league in nearly every category.
Master’s student Ben Walfish currently leads the league in goals and assists, scoring 29 points throughout the season to become the league’s No. 1-ranked player. Junior Zach Hissam follows closely as second in goals and third in assists, ranking third overall.
“Having guys like Walfish and Zach on the team is invaluable. They’re both incredibly talented players, but they also are great leaders,” said Ph.D. student Sam Ventura. “They take it upon themselves to instruct the younger players at practice, and they help everyone become better players.”
The season started in mid-October, with all games held at the Robert Morris University Island Sports Center. Months of hard work have paid off, as the team entered the playoff rounds last week, winning its first playoff game against Geneva College 10–1 on April 4.
“We want to go as far into the playoffs as possible and try to win as many games as possible,” said Ph.D. student Jason Fox, the club’s president. “We want to finish in first place.”
Founded in 2000, the club team has grown significantly in recent years. “The team has both highly competitive and recreational players,” Fox said. “Although some players play a bigger role in games, everyone gets opportunities to play and learn the game.” The team has grown to a diverse membership of both men and women that includes undergraduate students, graduate students, and faculty and staff members.
“We now have so many players that are both fun-loving and dedicated to the sport,” Fox said.
Fox said that although many people have played some form of hockey in the past, others — including himself — are simply attracted to “the fast-paced game.”
The dedication of the team is strongly evident, with several players currently competing with injuries. “One game, our senior defenseman Aneesh Bhoopathy took a stick to the face that split his nose open. He was bleeding everywhere; it was pretty ugly,” Ventura said. “But he just got it closed up, came back to the bench, and finished the game to make sure we got the win. That kind of dedication inspires the rest of the team to give everything they have on every shift.”
“Aside from that, defenseman Mike McCord has been playing through a shoulder injury all season, goalie Kevin Liebler played through a knee injury, and forward Eric Smith has been playing with osteoporosis,” Ventura said.
Last year, the Tartans only lost one game after being moved to a higher skill-level tier in the league; however, the team lost in the semifinal round of the playoffs. In the 2010–11 season, the team only lost one regular season game and finished in second place.
“We are very hungry to win the championship game,” Fox said. “It has been something that has eluded us for a few years.”
“This season, our sole goal is to win a championship,” Ventura added. “Anything less than that would be a failure.”
For now, the Tartans continue to focus intensely on the upcoming game against Duquesne on Wednesday at 10:30 p.m.
“We’re not thinking about anything beyond our semifinal game with Duquesne on Wednesday. This entire season, we’ve just been playing one game at a time. It’s worked so far. Hopefully it works again on Wednesday,” Ventura said.
Looking beyond this week’s game, Walfish hoped that the club’s success would encourage increased membership, even to the point of being able to field multiple teams.
“Ultimately, I hope that winning the championship will secure the team’s viability going forward so that I can comfortably leave it in the hands of the future leaders of the team. I cannot retire until that happens,” he said.

The Carnegie Mellon men’s lacrosse team, which has experienced numerous setbacks and difficulties this season, lost to University of Dayton last Saturday 18–1 at home. Still, the team is keeping its head up and hoping to finish Wednesday’s game against Grove City College — the last game of the season — on a high note.
The main obstacle for this season has been a loss of experienced players.
“From last year to this year we lost six starters, and we also lost our head coach, so basically the obstacle was starting over with a new team,” said junior Kevin Malcolm.
Junior leader Craig Matturro agreed, saying, “Our season this year has really put the team and program through its trials.”
The loss of a head coach was particularly significant for the team.
“[Our] head coach ... stepped down a few weeks before our first game due to his personal life,” Matturro said. “It was at this time when myself and other leaders on the team realized how much the head coach meant to the team — not just for practices and games, but for doing a lot of the behind-the-scene things we were unaware of.”
Fortunately for the team, the assistant head coach stepped up to take a much more meaningful role for the organization.
Other issues include the team’s small size and limited practice opportunities. Matturro explained, “Our opponents are teams that typically boast rosters of 25 or more players that practice five times a week.... In a 60-minute game played on an entire football field, it is hard to compete with a 16- to 18-man roster that only gets enough field time for two practices a week most of the time.”
The team also did not get in much practice time before winter. “We’re pretty much a new team, and we didn’t really play in the fall,” Malcolm said.
The team, with a season record of 0–6, has suffered problems on the field as well. 
“Pretty much we just need to be organized and know what we’re doing on plays, so organization and communication issues [have hurt us],” Malcolm said. “A lot of the goals that have been scored against us [happen] when we’re disorganized.”
The team was hoping to pull out a win at a scheduled home game against Butler University on Sunday, but the squad from Butler was unable to come to Pittsburgh.
However, the team is staying positive.
“Spirit and team morale has not been harmed in any way,” Matturro said. “One of the best qualities of the team is that everyone is out there to compete while having a great time.”
He continued, “This is really what club sports is about, and the men’s lacrosse team embodies it fully. It’s a great group of guys who have fun competing in what I think is one of the most exciting games out there.”
The team’s next game — the final matchup of the year — is at home Wednesday against Grove City College. While Grove City is a strong squad, having beaten Dayton two weeks ago, the Carnegie Mellon team is still hopeful. 
And, though the season is almost over, Matturro has high hopes for next season, during which the men’s lacrosse team is aiming for greater unity and teamwork to start the new season out strong.

The cheer “TARTANS! WHAT IS YOUR PROFESSION?” can often be heard loud and proud from Carnegie Mellon’s swimming pool, delivered with gusto by the women’s club water polo team. Though a relatively new sport to campus, women’s water polo has grown and expanded significantly in recent years, led by the positivity and dedication of Alice Tripp, a master’s student in public policy and management.
One of the most seasoned players on the team, Tripp has watched the team “consistently move up in the league rankings and slowly declare its presence,” she said.
Water polo requires endurance and strength, as players tread water in a game similar to land-based handball.
Tripp has excelled and specialized in playing hole set and right wing. In water polo, the offense often revolves around the hole set player. Because this player has the most desirable shooting and passing position, she is often the most heavily guarded as well.
“Hole set definitely requires a lot of experience and knowledge of the game,” said junior Erica Moore, the club’s president.
Tripp fulfills a definite need as a right wing player since she is left-handed, allowing her to shoot from a unique angle; she “helps immensely, since the rest of us are right-handed,” Moore said. “We rely on her pretty heavily as both a player and leader.”
Women’s water polo is a club sport in the competitive Collegiate Water Polo Association. The club holds practices all year, three times a week, although its competitive season is in the spring. In addition to practices, the team often holds scrimmages with the University of Pittsburgh team. The women’s team shares its Thursday practices with Carnegie Mellon’s men’s club water polo team.
“We love going to Late Night with the men’s team and getting to know them too,” Moore said.
This year, the team finished off its season last week with a 4–8 record and were seventh in the league.
Most recently, the Tartans hosted a championship tournament on April 6, with competing teams from Pennsylvania State University, West Chester University, Duke University, University of Virginia, University of North Carolina and University of Pittsburgh.
“The championships went well and showed off just how much we improved,” Tripp said. “We definitely knew what we were doing.” For her, this was a “huge accomplishment, considering it was a rebuilding year where we were teaching most of the girls the game.” In contrast to many of the other teams in their league, the Tartans lack experience. “Most of our girls had never played before college,” Tripp said.
Since the team does not have a coach, the team members often rely on coaching themselves. “Alice gives us tons of feedback on our playing,” Moore said. “She’s truly a core player in every aspect.”
Tripp began her water polo career as a first-year at Carnegie Mellon, playing for the men’s team. Originally from San Francisco, Tripp said that “polo reminds me of home. Water polo is huge in Cali.” In the spring of 2009, the women’s water polo team was formed.
“We have come such a long way from having to host bake sales every other weekend,” she said. “I am just so proud to now have full practices with such a fun and dedicated group of girls. I love both the competitive aspects and our camaraderie. Everyone is here to have fun and work hard.”
“Everyone on the team is so welcoming here,” Moore said. “Alice especially is so energetic and is truly someone we all look up to as both a player and a leader.”
Moore said that Tripp is a “very positive and energetic teammate” who always greets players with a “good morning, sunshine!” and constantly entertains with trivia and stories, both polo and non-polo related.
Her dedication to the team stems from a true love for the sport. “For me, water polo is such a contrast from my daily routine. It’s high energy, and a release from all the schoolwork,” Tripp said. “Most importantly, it’s fun.”
When not releasing her stress in a polo match, Tripp also remains heavily involved in Carnegie Mellon’s chapter of Habitat for Humanity.
“Alice literally seems to do everything,” Moore said. “She’s been a huge inspiration for me and the other girls.”
Tripp’s studies in public policy and management will take her to Washington, D.C. next fall, where she plans to take classes at the Heinz campus and work for the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration in the climate program office. “It’s going to be really hard next year without Alice,” Moore said. “She’s always been there and was truly the backbone of the team.”
For now, Tripp savors her last months in Pittsburgh as she responds to “TARTANS! WHAT IS YOUR PROFESSION?” with a final “AAH-OO! AAH-OO! AAH-OO!”
“Some say that our cheer is even more manly then the men’s team,” she said.

The men’s golf team recently played in two tournaments: the Hershey Cup in Hershey, Pa., and the Edward Jones Shootout — hosted by Carnegie Mellon University — in Apollo, Pa. The team placed third at the Hershey Cup and fourth at the Edward Jones Shootout. 
Discussing the team’s third-place showing out of 15 teams in the Hershey Cup, junior Ian Bangor said, “I thought we played well. The first day was tough conditions; it wasn’t easy.” 
Bangor said, “While I didn’t play well, we had a good freshman, Ben DuCarme, play well with a 76.” He added, “We played pretty well as a team the second day, and shot 299, with a couple shots away from beating Rochester.”
At the Edward Jones Shootout, the team ended up with a 618 in 36 holes, trailing Point Park University, Allegheny College, and St. Vincent College. Bangor and DuCarme led the team at the Shootout with scores of 151 and 153, respectively. Bangor placed fourth overall, and DuCarme came in ninth.
The team has overall performed well this season, with a home win at the Carnegie Mellon Fall Invitational and a tie for second place at the UAA Championships.
However, according to sophomore standout Justin Fischler, one disadvantage that the squad has compared to other teams is the weather in Pittsburgh. “A school like Emory is able to practice all year ’round, while in Pittsburgh we can’t,” he explained.
“I think we all kind of need to get our games back in form,” Fischler said. “It’s tough after not playing outside for a while.”
As for the rest of the school year, first-year Mason Struthers said, “Basically we’re going to try and play and practice as much as we can — and the sun’s out, so we’re going to get back out there and play.”
Despite the drawbacks, team has worked to stay in shape during the winter. “We’ve been going to the gym and working out,” Struthers said.
The team has a great deal of young talent. Bangor noted that first-years have been an important part of the team. Moreover, the team is not losing any graduating seniors this year, and can retain its talent for a strong season next year, especially with four incoming recruits joining the program.
“Our goal for the season is to get a bid to the Division-III Championships,” Bangor said, “[but] the way the season works, we’re not an automatically qualifying conference.”
Fischler has similar goals for the team. “Hopefully we can get three wins in the next couple tournaments,” he said. “And it’s a long shot, but I hope we make Nationals.”
The golf team will play next at the Bearcat Invitational in Latrobe, Pa., on Thursday.

High-level athletic competition is all about pushing one’s body to the peak of human performance, trying to get every drop of ability out of one’s muscles, bones, and tendons. Unfortunately, putting this amount of strain on a body day in and day out for the many years of training it takes to play competitively also leaves athletes susceptible to gruesome injuries that the average person could barely imagine.
NBA great and Los Angeles Laker Kobe Bryant, new Los Angeles Dodger pitcher Zach Greinke, and University of Louisville guard Kevin Ware have all experienced serious injuries in the last two weeks that will take several months of arduous recovery for them to even think about practicing again, much less playing at the same level they once did. These injuries all took place on fairly routine plays and actions, and they have served to showcase the fragility of the human body when pushed to its limits.
Bryant, in his 17th season with the Los Angeles Lakers, was supposed to be reaching the twilight of his career. The cast of all-stars the Lakers have assembled has spent almost as much time in the training room as on the court. This has left the Lakers in a position not really known to them in Bryant’s time in Los Angeles: on the outside of the playoffs, looking in.
Bryant has refused to lose and has been playing over 45 minutes a game. But while this succeeded in pulling the Lakers into the playoffs, he pushed his body to the limit.
Friday night, his body gave out, and his left Achilles’ tendon ruptured with three minutes left in a game against the Golden State Warriors. It was on a step that he had taken millions of times before, but this time his body could not take the stress any more. Bryant now has to determine if it is worth the projected six- to nine-month recovery to return to game shape at age 35 for what he previously claimed would be his last season.
Greinke was the latest addition in the Dodgers’ spending spree after they were bought by a new ownership group led by NBA Hall of Famer Magic Johnson. Greinke was signed to give depth to a rotation headlined by ace Clayton Kershaw.
He is known to have bit of a temper and has had a history with San Diego Padres outfield Carlos Quentin. Quentin’s batting stance leaves him leaning slightly over the plate, causing him to rank near the top of batters hit by pitches each year. Back in 2008 and 2009 — when Greinke was with the Kansas City Royals and Quentin with the division rival Chicago White Sox — Greinke hit Quentin twice. At the time, Quentin told everyone that he would retaliate if Greinke hit again.
Fast forward to last Thursday, when the Dodgers and the Padres squared off and Greinke hit Quentin for the third time in their careers. Given the one-run game and a full count, it seems unlikely the hit was intentional. But that didn’t stop Quentin from taking offense and starting to walk toward the mound. After yelling a few words at Greinke, Quentin looked ready to just walk to first until Greinke responded by yelling back. Quentin then charged the mound and, in the ensuing tackle and benches-clearing brawl, broke Greinke’s collar-bone.
Greinke is out for the next six to eight weeks, but Quentin was only suspended for eight games. This disparity has made Quentin No. 1 on Dodgers fans’ list of most-hated players.
While understandable, the injury is just one of the flukes of having pumped-up, emotional athletes together in the heat of competition. While what happened is unfortunate, it is just as much Greinke’s fault for fueling Quentin’s anger as it is Quentin’s for charging the mound.
Ware’s story is by far the saddest of all. Ware is a guard for the Louisville Cardinals, NCAA Champions. He was a reserve, coming off of the bench to give some of the Cardinals’ great players — those with surefire NBA careers — a rest. But during the regional finals matchup with the Duke Blue Devils, Ware became the nation’s most well-known college basketball player. With about six minutes left in the first half, Ware jumped out to contest a three-point shot by Blue Devil Tyler Thornton.
When he landed, the entire arena come to a silent halt as his lower right leg snapped and popped out of his skin. His teammates were in tears, but in this moment of ultimate anguish for Ware, his legend was born. Ware, instead of focusing on himself, began to encourage his teammates, repeating over and over again, “Don’t worry about me. I’ll be okay. You guys go win this thing.”
This soft-spoken bench player suddenly became the emotional leader for his entire team, showing the true meaning of being a team player. He has since been an inspirational story to the nation, staying positive and using this terrible situation to propel his team to the championship game, even being the last one to cut down the nets after Louisville’s final win over Michigan.
Ware is confident he can return, but whatever happens from here, this young man has written the book on how to spin adversity into triumph and how to rise to the occasion while facing the worst of situations.
All of these athletes watched their livelihoods, their bodies, give out on them through freak accidents. They face doubts on how well they can return: Bryant is facing the end of his career; Greinke has to return and excel at possibly the most unnatural sports activity, pitching; and Ware has to try and recover from having his leg literally fail underneath him.
But then, each player put in hundreds of thousands of hours to reach where they were in the first place — what’s another few months of physical therapy?

Even the most experienced and skilled surgeons find surgery to be an arduous and stressful task. The emergence of medical robots that assist surgeons has allowed many surgeries to become significantly safer and more effective. However, before these robots can be utilized in the field, engineers must be certain that the robot will react accordingly in every possible situation that may arise during a surgery. Computer scientists at Carnegie Mellon teamed up with physicists and engineers from Johns Hopkins University to develop a universal method of using logical reasoning to identify bugs in medical robots and make sure they perform their required functions successfully.
Researcher Yanni Kouskoulas and his team at the Applied Physics Laboratory at Johns Hopkins University initially designed a medical robot that would aid a surgeon in preforming a surgical procedure  at the base of the skull. During the surgery, it is very important for a surgeon to ensure that he or she doesn’t accidentally damage nearby parts of the body. This can pose a larger problem when the surgeon fails to have a full view of the surgical space.
To ensure the safety of the patient, the doctor can use imaging techniques such as Magnetic Resonance Imaging  (MRI) or Computed Tomomgraphy (CT) scans to establish the boundaries of the surgical space. The robot recognizes these boundaries and aids surgeons by applying resistance to their movement as they get closer to the edges. It also prevents doctors from leaving the surgical space altogether. 
While testing the robot on cadavers, Kouskoulas and his team realized that the robot exhibited undefined behavior in some rare cases. Confused about the source of their problem, Kouskoulas and his team reached out to André Platzer, a professor of computer science at Carnegie Mellon, to help them evaluate their system and determine where they were going wrong.
Platzer has been actively working on developing tools to verify the correctness of cyber-physical systems, which combine computation and physical movements. Normal proofs in computer science are not sufficient because they do not account for the infinite possible states of a physical application. In the past few years, his tools have successfully verified and increased the safety of railway control systems and air traffic control systems.
The verification tool, known as KeYmaeraD, is a mathematical proof that aims to systematically study a system and prove that a condition always holds true. The proof examines the various states of the robot system and ensures that the tools always remain within established boundaries. In many different cases, the proof works automatically. However, when the proof fails, the tool presents a counterexample by highlighting the specific situation where the system fails. 
Soon after Platzer and Kouskoulas met and began to establish their proof, they highlighted a significant problem in the system: The robot checked a movement in relation to each of the edges of the surgical space one by one and initiated resistance if the movement was too close to the boundary. However, in the process of moving to the next boundary, the robot would undo the resistance that was just established in order to make a new one.
After identifying a problem, changing an established design can be a challenging process: Kouskoulas and his team faced the challenge, making many modifications to their system based on the results of Platzer’s verification tool. They continued testing until every single state could be proven. The newly designed system did not exhibit unexpected behavior during testing on cadavers.
Platzer explained that using a verification tool can enhance the testing process because it immediately identifies where a system might fail. In addition, complications during surgery can be unexpected and it is impossible to test the infinite states of the system on a cadaver. With such a tool, the robot’s engineers can be sure that the robot will always exhibit the correct outcome during a surgery, ensuring the safety of the patient.
The principles used to test and prove the skull-based surgery system can be applied to a variety of surgical robot models all based on establishing boundaries and ensuring that a doctor remains within the surgical space. Platzer hopes that formal verification tools will help engineers design safer medical robots by identifying the various situations where the system might fail before being used  in surgery.

Imagine if you had a magical box that, with the click of a button, could make whatever you wanted. With the advancements in 3-D printing, this idea is not as far fetched as it might seem.
In 2012, President Obama announced the creation of the National Network for Manufacturing and Innovation (NNMI), a proposal to create institutes across the nation, each focusing on an advanced method of manufacturing and consisting of a collaboration between universities, companies, and the government. The purpose of this initiative is to create new jobs, strengthen national security, and spark the kind of innovation that drives economic success.
Carnegie Mellon is a member of the National Additive Manufacturing Innovation Institute (NAMII), the pilot institute for NNMI that focuses on the method of additive manufacturing and is run by the National Center for Defense Manufacturing and Machining (NCDMM). NAMII was recently awarded $30 million from the Department of Defense, the Department of Energy, NASA, the National Science Foundation (NSF), and the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST). The Institute consists of five universities, five companies, and two national laboratories. It is centered in Youngstown, Ohio.
Additive manufacturing, more commonly known as 3-D printing, is a method of manufacturing products that involves adding material to make something, as opposed to cutting or drilling material away. Certain types of software allow one to draw solid models with specified shape, size, and materials and encode all this information in a digital form. A 3-D printer will convert this information into slices and build the object layer by layer. 
3-D printers have a distinctive look. According to electrical and computer engineering professor Gary Fedder, who leads the school’s efforts in NAMII, “The types of machines that make it kind of look like a large microwave oven, as opposed to conventional machinery, which looks more industrial.”
There are two popular methods of 3-D printing: “One is extrusion and involves squeezing material out like squeezing toothpaste out of a tube,” Fedder said. Instead of toothpaste, however, the 3-D printer squeezes out polymer in tiny beads that are controlled by a computer. As a 2-D pattern of polymer is squeezed out, light is shone onto it to harden the layer. This process is repeated layer by layer until a 3-D object is created.
The second method is called laser sintering. Instead of squeezing out material, this method uses what Fedder refers to as a “bed” of powder spread out in an even, flat sheet. “This powder can be plastic,” Fedder said, “But what people are excited about is metal powder, like titanium powder.” The powder is spread out in a flat sheet, and then the computer uses a laser to melt the powder into the desired shape. After each layer is created, the powder bed is lowered and a new layer of material is applied. This process continues repeatedly until the 3-D product is created.
There are two NAMII projects with which Carnegie Mellon is involved. The first, led by mechanical engineering professor Jack Beuth, involves the quality of additive manufacturing. “The problem is for things like aerospace,” Fedder said. “We don’t know if the part made is really going to be strong enough to put in an aircraft. If you press ‘print’ and make 100 parts, is there one out of that 100 that will fail? That wouldn’t be acceptable on an airplane. So those types of in-depth issues are what people are researching.”
The second project is led by Pennsylvania State University and involves monitoring the additive manufacturing process with thermal imaging. The purpose of this project is to determine the impact of heat on the 3-D printing process. Carnegie Mellon has contributed to this project by developing process-mapping technologies. These technologies take thermal images of the layers as they are made so that researchers can analyze the material’s microstructure.
Additive manufacturing is more useful in some fields than in others, and is particularly beneficial for biomedical engineering and aviation. Within biomedical engineering, 3-D printing can be used to make customized biological implants. 3-D printing is also very relevant for developing aviation technology because the layer-by-layer process allows intricate spider web-like designs to be built. This type of design is especially useful for aviation because it makes metal objects much lighter. The current products manufactured using 3-D printing are rather specific, but as the process improves, 3-D printers may soon become as common a device in everyday homes as a regular laser printer.

Anyone who has taken a college-level course in biology is familiar with the strange black-and-white pictures of what most people would think are impossibly small bacteria. Up until the 1950s and the invention of the scanning electron microscope (SEM), they were.
Ever since then, biologists have had great insight into the realm of the incredibly small, allowing scientists to analyze surfaces and do research in several different fields that were never have thought possible. The SEM has allowed them to have new insight into the structure of cellular-level biological structures as well as analyze the structures of materials applied in engineering.
The basis of this technology lies behind the fact that SEMs use precisely controlled electrons instead of light to look at samples.
According to the Radiological and Environmental Management website at Purdue University, the electrons are first shot from an electron gun at the top of the apparatus; these initial electrons are of very random energy and do not have very much control. These electrons then pass through many different energetic potential differences and magnetic lenses that slowly refine the speed and direction of the electrons. This eventually translates to controlling the area and resolution of the sample. For example, if the electrons are distributed over a very small range and are very highly concentrated, the resolution of the picture will be very high. This allows researchers to see samples at up to 500,000 times magnification — about 250 times stronger than the strongest light microscopes.
The way we “view” the image, however, is very different than a normal microscope. A light microscope simply magnifies and enhances the light reflected off a sample by a lamp through an optical lens. In the end, it is still the human  eye, or in some cases a camera, that is doing the “viewing” of the sample. Since the SEM uses electrons to probe the sample, we can’t see anything visually. However, we can moniter the electron’s interactions within the sample.
To understand this interaction, it’s important to comprehend how the samples are prepared. Because the area of observation in the SEM is a vacuum — ensuring that the electrons don’t interact with anything else before the sample — biological and otherwise fragile samples must be carefully dried so that they do not collapse. These and other samples that are nonconductive are then put in a special machine that coats the entire sample in a thin layer of gold. This allows for all samples to be conductive so that they may interact with the electrons fired at them.
The main method of this interaction is a process called Compton Scattering. In this process, electrons collide with atoms and other electrons in the conductive material. When the electrons do this they either accelerate around the collision and move off in a different direction, scatter backward, or move relatively easily through the sample (this last possibility is very unlikely). 
Due to the properties of accelerated electromagnetic charge, the electrons that collide then emit high-energy photons or X-rays. These X-rays, along with the secondary electrons and back-scattered electrons, are what the computer is able to detect. Many different detectors within the machine that surround the sample then analyze all of the different kinds of debris. These detectors then send the gathered data to a computer, which interprets it and creates an image, giving  insight into the micro-microscopic world.

Study looks at the brain to determine music preferences
A recent study explained what processes in the brain shape people’s taste in music, and also helped predict what types of music they will buy. Participants of the study underwent Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) while they listened to 60 new pieces of music and reported how much they would be willing to pay for each. The results of the study revealed that the nucleus accumbens, the region of the brain that forms expectations as to what may be pleasing to an individual, determines whether a piece of music is pleasing or not.
Depending on how pleasing the listener deems the music, the nucleus accumbens interacts with the auditory cortex, the area of the brain that stores information on the sounds an individual hears. Though everyone experiences the same brain processes when choosing music, each person has different musical tastes because everyone has a uniquely shaped auditory cortex. The researchers also said that musical preferences are partially shaped by an individual’s past experiences.

Researchers study addictiveness of potato chips
A research team at University of Erlangen-Nuremberg in Germany performed a study on rats that revealed likely causes as to why potato chips seem to be more addictive than other foods. In the study, rats were given choices between their standard animal chow and three other types of food, including potato chips. Although they ate relatively equal amounts of each, they pursued the potato chips more enthusiastically. Manganese-Enhanced Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MEMRI), which was used to map the rats’ brains, showed that the reward and addiction centers of the brain were most active when eating the potato chips.
These results showed that while fat and carbohydrates were a partial explanation for this, there had to have been another factor, as the rats’ animal chow also contained these ingredients. If scientists can find the molecular ingredient that makes chips so pleasing, healthy but less desirable foods could be injected with this ingredient to make them more appealing. However, there has been no proof yet as to how this can be done.

Magic mushrooms might help treat depressed patients
David Nutt, Professor at Imperial College London and president of the British neuroscience association, has recently been given £500,000 to conduct a clinical trial regarding the uses of psychedelic mushrooms — commonly known as “magic mushrooms” or “ ’shrooms” — to cure depression. Nutt claims that psilocybin, an ingredient in nearly 200 species of psychedelic mushrooms, can turn down areas of the brain that are overactive in depressed individuals. 
A depressed individual would need an amount of psilocybin equivalent to five psychedelic mushrooms. Nutt’s study would involve 60 patients and would use a synthetically manufactured version of the ingredient. At this time, however, current drug laws and restrictions make it difficult for Nutt to gain access to psychedelic mushrooms. In addition, very few hospitals are licensed to use the drug, so even if the study were to be successful in showing that psychedelic mushrooms assisted depressed individuals, it would be difficult to bring about widespread use of the treatment.

Archaeologists find remains of dinosaur embryos
An international research team lead by Robert Reisz of the University of Toronto Mississauga in Canada recently discovered some of the oldest dinosaur embryo fossils ever found. The fossils, roughly 190 million years old, were discovered in southwest China. The remains belonged to the Lufengosaurus, a species of dinosaur that would have grown to 30 feet in height. The fossils were preserved at different stages in the development process. Analysis of the remains, along with information about fully-developed dinosaurs of the same species, revealed that this species developed quickly in the embryo stage and after hatching, and that the embryos discovered were killed by a flood.

Amputee receives iPhone-controlled bionic hand
Jason Koger, a 34-year-old man who has been living with amputated hands for five years, is the first recipient of a bionic hand controlled by an iPhone app. The i-limb ultra revolution, created by U.K. company Touch Bionics, is said to be the closest product to an actual human hand. It offers unparalleled flexibility and has individually powered fingers. 
The iPhone control app includes auto-grip features, preset grip patterns for specific objects, and individually customized grip patterns, that allow for more functionality than traditional prosthetic devices.

Scientists make transparent brains for easier study
Scientists at Stanford University have created an innovative method to study the brain: By replacing the fatty lipid membranes surrounding cells with an acrylamide mesh, they effectively developed a way to make brain tissue transparent. While lipids scatter light, acrylamide mesh does not — yet it still keeps the molecules in place. This method allows researchers to study the inside of the brain without cutting it into slices. This is a valuable advancement because it does not require chopping up axons, which scientists were unable to study before. While the method was developed in mouse brains, the team has also tested it on post-mortem human brain tissue.

Heinz Hall was near full capacity on Saturday night — and no wonder: The program boasted violinist Joshua Bell, who is about as close to a rock star as it gets in the classical music world. Bell’s performance was spectacular, of course — but his was only one of several performances that made Saturday’s program especially fantastic.
Before Bell’s performance, the 2012–13 Pittsburgh Symphony Orchestra (PSO) Composer of the Year Mason Bates came to the stage to introduce his piece, Desert Transport. It seemed odd that Bates should choose a Bell concert to debut his work — where no matter how well received the piece was, it would inevitably be overshadowed by Bell’s performance. However, by introducing it on Saturday, Bates ensured that his work was heard by the largest possible audience.
And to Bates’ credit, the composition was very good. His piece sounded unlike much of the more eccentric and purposefully dissonant contemporary music that’s already out there. Sweeping and glorious, the music resembled a movie score in terms of its scope and sound. As Bates explained, the piece was inspired by a helicopter flight over the Arizona desert. The climbing strings mirrored the rise in altitude as the helicopter took off; one could even hear the rapid pulsing of helicopter blades in the percussion. There was a definite sense of journey to the piece — a triumphant arc that rose, peaked, and then returned to ground level.
Even though this piece wasn’t necessarily the most anticipated on the program, audience members cheered wildly at its conclusion, granting Bates a well-deserved standing ovation. For those few minutes, it was gratifying to see music lovers acknowledge new talent in the composing world — even if they had primarily come to see someone else.
The cheers subsided and then rose again as Bell took the stage. After exchanging a few good-natured handshakes with members of the orchestra and giving the audience an appreciative smile, Bell lifted his violin for Bernstein’s Serenade after Plato’s “Symposium.”
The sound was incredible. Watching Bell, it was immediately clear that he has an unusually stiff vibrato; unlike most top-notch violinists who produce a more fluid vibrato from the wrist, Bell uses his entire arm in a way that looks almost awkward at times.
However, this quirky characteristic did nothing to detract from the sound he produced. Bell played deftly and effortlessly, even producing a few series of notes that seemed impossibly fast. In these moments, Bell proved himself an energetic performer; his hair moved vigorously with the music, and he frequently bent and straightened his knees according to the tension in each phrase.
But any violinist of his caliber can play quickly. The moments that set Bell apart as a musician happened when the tempo slowed and gave him time to bring out the artistry in his playing. Bell managed to wring every ounce of sweetness from the notes he played, just toeing the line between excess and perfection. A dreamlike expression crossed his face during these slower passages.
Toward the end of the piece, PSO assistant principal cellist Adam Liu joined Bell in a lovely duet. Though Bell was clearly still the star, Liu’s cello supplemented him nicely, and Bell was not so overpowering as to detract from the delicate exchange of back-and-forth musical dialogue.
But Bell’s performance, startlingly, was not the end of the concert. After the intermission, the orchestra took the stage for a performance of Brahms’ Symphony No. 3 in F major. Bell’s was a hard act to follow, but the orchestra’s performance proved to be anything but anticlimactic.
The PSO’s rendition of the Brahms was truly the best of the best. The second movement in particular showed off the orchestra’s exquisite dynamics. The orchestra worked in complete harmony; each phrase lifted and descended with a soft sigh, as if the orchestra were a single breathing body.
The order of the program was an interesting and undoubtedly intentional choice. The program could have easily ended with a bang after Bell’s performance, but instead the orchestra chose to give itself the limelight for the last third of the concert. This final performance was a nod toward the orchestra and a reminder that they made the entire evening possible — a reminder of the renown and professionalism without which bringing in soloists like Joshua Bell would not even be possible. By ending the concert with the Brahms, the PSO made the evening not a celebration of Bell or Bates, but a celebration of the orchestra itself and its important contributions to the Pittsburgh cultural scene.

In the last seconds before death, what would you see flashing before your eyes — your greatest regrets, your happiest memories, or something so extraordinary and unthinkable that it can only be experienced in the throes of death?
This question pervades the production of Dream of Autumn, a surrealist play written by Norwegian playwright Jon Fosse and translated and directed by Sarah Cameron Sunde, at the Quantum Theatre in East Liberty.
It is impossible to pin down the exact story of Dream of Autumn; it floats somewhere between the long shadows and ghostly figures of the play. At its core, Dream of Autumn is about a man who relives his life in fractured visions as his existence comes to an end. In a scattered collage of bittersweet memories, broken relationships, and emotional turmoil, Dream of Autumn touches upon a range of subjects: love, lust, family, death, fear, trust, loss, and the passage of time.
The characters are a strange combination of enigma and personality. All but one go unnamed. They speak in sometimes meandering, sometimes repetitive dialogue. However, they are fascinating and unforgettable, brought to life by an amazing performances by the cast.
Carnegie Mellon adjunct professor Martin Giles plays Man, the protagonist of the play — a conflicted figure who seems almost indecisive and childlike in his actions. Karla Boos plays Woman, the ghostly and free-spirited lover and temptress. Laurie Klatscher and Carnegie Mellon drama and music professor Gregory Lehane portray Man’s parents — a desperate, deeply anxious mother and a nonchalant, aloof father. Jennifer Tober plays Gry, Man’s ex-wife, who remains bitter and angry over their divorce.
Giles’ portrayal of Man was particularly fascinating. Not only did he cover a wide range of emotions in expressing the character’s inner turmoil, but he also managed to punctuate his performance with moments of unexpected comedy, with an odd word or shift in tone here and there to lighten the mood.
The staging was simply phenomenal. The set felt like a Salvador Dalí painting brought to life. Pieces of bone-white furniture half-buried in sand became tombstones where a basement had been converted into a graveyard.
The play’s set and costume designer Narelle Sissons, who is an associate professor of scenography at Carnegie Mellon, spoke about her reasoning for the set design: “The only thing Fosse gives us in the text are a bench, some gravel, and a graveyard. We did not have a bench, gravel, or a graveyard. Instead, we wanted to build a psychological space, in the basement of this mansion, an abandoned basement in decay.”
The lighting, directed by Carnegie Mellon assistant teaching professor of lighting C. Todd Brown, changed dynamically and unexpectedly, creating a multitude of different atmospheres. Carnegie Mellon assistant professor of sound design Joe Pino created a sense of eerie unrest in the space of the basement.
The elements of the production often inundated the audience all at once. For instance, in a scene where Man must choose between his parents and Gry or Woman, there are sudden, sharp changes in lighting and sound as the characters engage in a bitter, desperate back-and-forth dialogue. There is a real sense of tension and discord, as if the world is being torn apart at that very moment.
At the end, when the twin hourglasses that run for the duration of the play are out of sand, there is still a trail of questions left unanswered. However, the beauty of the play is that, in leaving behind a mystery, it generates a great deal of introspection. You will wonder what you will see just before you die, what the most important part of your life is, and what you will do until that inevitable day when your very own dream of autumn comes to you.
Quantum Theatre's Dream of Autumn runs through April 28.

If you happened to walk past Schenley Plaza last Friday, you may have wondered why there was a Ferris wheel and other festivities present.
These were all part of an event called Celebrating Oakland, also called Oakland Forever. University of Pittsburgh Medical Center (UPMC) served as the primary sponsor, although other sponsors included Carnegie Mellon, the University of Pittsburgh, and the Oakland Transportation Management Association.
Although the description of the event boasted activities such as a food tour, carnival rides, and live entertainment, the majority of them did not seem to be present at the actual event. The only carnival ride was one Ferris wheel, and there was no food, unless you count the decorated dog biscuits being sold by one vendor. 
In addition, it was difficult to tell whether the marching band from Pitt was practicing on the side, or part of the event. Regardless of its reason for being there, the Pitt marching band appeared to be the only live entertainment present.
Although there was not much to do, a decent number of people showed up to the event. It was nice seeing families out together and enjoying the agreeable weather. 
It was also interesting to talk to the vendors and see what they were selling. In addition to the table with decorated dog biscuits, there was another vendor selling custom jewelry and another with an array of colorful scarves. These tables all featured locally made items and attracted quite a number of people.
Upon speaking to some of the vendors, it became clear that the event was actually a trial run for the actual Celebrating Oakland festival that will occur next year. Next year is Oakland’s 175th birthday, and the celebration is supposedly being planned on a much larger scale. 
Friday’s event was the first of its kind, which may better explain why it was poorly organized. If this year’s Celebrating Oakland was in fact a trial, there are many changes that should be made to make it less confusing and more of a celebration, as its name suggests.
One of the more important changes that should be made is to the description of the event. This year’s festival could not be any more different from how it was described, so the next event should stick to the description. Additional activities and live performers would definitely be beneficial and could attract significantly more people than it did this year. 
As the description of the event suggests, the goal of Celebrating Oakland was to bring the residents of Oakland together; the turnout for this year was an indication that better organization could make next year’s actual event memorable for the entire community.

McConomy Auditorium was about half-full with students and faculty members last Tuesday afternoon. Despite the mixed ages and ethnic backgrounds, one thing these attendees had in common was their interest in economics — and of course, in comedy. But then, who wouldn’t be up for a good, educational laugh over intelligent jokes? After all, we go to Carnegie Mellon.
Cheers and applause went to Yoram Bauman, who called himself “the world’s first and only stand-up economist.” Bauman graduated with a B.A. in mathematics from Reed College and went on to the University of Washington for his master’s degree and Ph.D. in economics. His goal is to “spread joy to the world through economics comedy; to reform economics education; and to implement carbon pricing — preferably through a revenue-neutral tax shift involving lower taxes on things like working, saving, investing, and higher taxes on things we don’t like (e.g. carbon).”
From his introduction until the very end of the show, Bauman was constantly in character. He did not let the fear of offending someone get in the way of his jokes. For example, he started the show by showing off his capitalism shirt he bought in China. The political irony immediately captured the crowd’s attention.
He went on to share his experiences from his recent visit to Beijing. Bauman roused further excitement with his Chronic Hyperinflation in Hell theory drawn from Chinese belief, explaining it as a “drastic increase in money supply which we called ‘M4.’ ” The crowd loved the intelligent pun and correlation to economic money measurements “M1,” “M2,” and “M3.” His explanation of the Chinese tradition of burning joss paper for their ancestors — and how that causes hell to be filled with money — struck a chord with the culturally diverse audience.
Bauman later incorporated one of our favorite technologies of the day — apps — by exploring the new way of transferring money. His punch line was definitely one to stick: “There’s an app for everyone — even the dead ones.” He went on to jest about how Chinese tradition believes in magic and Social Darwinism, but not Darwinism.
Bauman then poked fun at the contradictory Singaporean policy of calling themselves liberal, when at the same time, the government has its fingers at everybody’s throats. “ ‘Uh-oh, be careful. Don’t talk about politics, race, religion, the government, or people named ‘Lee.’ Don’t say anything that might offend anybody,’ ” the comedian said, quoting the Singaporeans he had encountered. 
Later on, Bauman talked about his own career and about how he got to where he is now. “I’m a little embarrassed to say that my video has recently just got a million hits,” he said. “It’s surprising ‘cause I’m not a Korean pop star or anything.”
Some of Bauman’s last jokes involved his explanation of different perspectives from varying types of economics through “S*** Happens.” He first made the distinction between microeconomics ad macroeconomics. The former stresses that the price of “s***” is determined by supply and demand; the latter simply expresses, “Oh, s***!” He went on to define classical macro, Keynesian macro, neo-Keynesian macro, neoclassical synthesis, econometrics, environmental economics, supply-side economics, behavioral economics, and the Australian School of Economics.
“People always wonder why economics always seems so confusing,” Bauman said. “It’s because they do not want you to figure out that the entire economy is empty.” Though Bauman makes fun of economics and the system a lot, it takes someone knowledgeable and familiar with the field to make one-tenth of the jokes and comments that he made.

On the closing day of the Carnegie Mellon International Film Festival, the audience was treated to Petr Lom’s documentary Back to the Square, which centers around the aftereffects of the recent Egyptian Revolution. Shown at McConomy Auditorium last Saturday, the film attracted people of various ages and backgrounds, making the screening a tremendous success. It was an incredible wrap-up to the film festival, and in keeping with this year’s theme “Faces of Media,” the film epitomized the power of media. It focused on the tremendous impact of social media like Facebook or blogging from people in Egypt that helped overthrow a nation’s dictator.
Lom has had quite an amazing journey into film himself. A Harvard Ph.D. professor in political philosophy, Lom decided to leave his academic career to focus on documentary filmmaking about social injustices. 
For most people in the audience, who were only spectators of the 2011 Egyptian Revolution, a few key words come to mind: Mubarak, overthrown, injustice, Facebook, military. However, the revolution spans far beyond that in terms of actions and consequences. When Egypt’s dictator Hosni Mubarak was overthrown, the people did not receive the freedom they expected. Lom’s documentary Back to the Square conveys the worsening of conditions in Egypt ever since the military took over Mubarak’s rule. By focusing on the portraits of five people affected by the aftermath of the revolution, the documentary powerfully reveals the chaotic violence and growth in dictatorial regime that has made an entire country suffer since Jan. 25, 2011.
The first story is about an adolescent horse herdsman who was attacked during the revolution after driving to the pyramids in an attempt to sell souvenirs. Traumatized by the unprecedented violence, his family struggled after that fateful day, a day that originally promised hope but ended in barbaric uproar. The second portrait is about a taxi driver who was gratuitously sentenced to six years in prison and subjected to horrendous torture by the police and military.
The third portrait focuses on a woman and her husband who were subjected to unjustified intimidation by the police, while the fourth portrait features on a girl named Saiwa who met her first love during the political demonstrations and was eventually accused of prostitution by the military.
The final portrait concentrates on a young man who wrote a post on his personal blog criticizing the military and was forced into prison. In the midst of the incredulity, one of the civilians says, “You can go to jail for one Facebook comment” — demonstrating the intense tightening of the regime after a society tumbled into chaos.
All five of these stories revolve around the senseless destruction of civilian lives. The film shows that, because of the regime’s determination to scare citizens into submission after the revolution, Egypt is now in a worse state than it was during Mubarak’s reign. The film ends on Tahrir Square with protests for human rights, leaving with the message that human life is the foundation of a functional and moral society, not power or force.
By observing the lives of the five people marred by a seemingly world-changing revolution, the audience was able to experience the eye-opening truth behind a false promise. The documentary effectively conveys the tragedy of a military abusing its power and shattering the hope of its people immediately after their dictator was overthrown. The feeling of injustice is all too real and very much alive. The film was incredibly well done and successfully showed the other side of the revolution that no one outside of Egypt can easily access.
Lom will also hold a film workshop Monday at 5 p.m. in Giant Eagle Auditorium (BH A51).

Dear Patrick,
I enjoy David Carradine’s movies a few nights a week. My friends are really judgmental of my hobby, but his films leave me feeling lightheaded and great. What can I do to convince my friends there’s nothing wrong with the occasional David Carradine?
Thanks,
Feeling Illicit, Latter’s Movies Banish Unusual Feelings Frequently
Dear FILM BUFF,
I’m sorry, but I just can’t encourage David Carradine fandom. Sure, you saw Kill Bill and thought he was great in it. Maybe it gives you more of a rush — leaves you feeling woozy. The next thing you know, it’s a few hours later and you have no recollection of what you’ve been doing — just a deep sense of shame and a desire to cover it up the next day.
Stay away from Carradine. There are many other, safer options out there that are just as fun. If Kill Bill is what got you started, explore the Tarantino oeuvre. If it was his ’70s martial arts series, try pivoting to some Bruce Lee films and The Green Hornet series. While they may not have the same illicit thrill of some of Carradine’s stuff, they will still leave you satisfied. Plus, Bruce Lee rocks. Just remember: No David Carradine, not even once.
Stay away from Bangkok hotels,
Patrick Hoskins
Dear Patrick,
Wooooooooooooo!!! Carnival!!! Wooooooooo!!! Boooooth!!! Buuuuuggy!!! Wooooooooo!!! Carnival!!!
Thanks,
Want Orgiastic Opportunities, Otherwise, Optimistically, Offending Opposers Offer Other Obscene Oases Or Occasional Opiates
Dear WOOOOOOOOOOOOO,
Woo indeed. It’s finally Carnival, and I’m going to give you the trademarked Hoskins Personal Carnival Enjoyment Guide. First, skip every school-sponsored event. Booth is only enjoyable if you’re a thrill-seeker tempting fate when climbing to the third floor of a sorority’s disaster of a superstructure. Buggy is enjoyable until you realize it’s NASCAR for nerds, and as far as the concert goes, I doubt you can name more than one Lupe song. 
So if the school events are a bust, what should you do? Well, what you’ve been doing all year: Roll out of bed, crack open a beer, and don’t stop until your reflection starts to look pretty good. Party like you go to Pitt. Dance like nobody’s watching. Play Edward Fortyhands and get in a shot-for-shot contest. Make a lot of bad decisions.
Do something dumb enough to earn a nickname,
Patrick Hoskins

100 years ago:  Mar. 27, 1913
The men of Beta Theta Pi Epsilon fraternity hosted a three-day party at its chapter house, including the Musical Club’s Concert and Dance — an informal musical at the house — and the annual fraternity dance. The dance took place at the Rittenhouse and includes dinner and dancing. 
50 years ago:  Apr. 10, 1963

Months after Carnegie Mellon’s stress culture Town Hall in January, the university and its students are looking for ways to address stress management and wellness on campus. Neha Chaurasia, a senior biological sciences major, is designing a new StuCo class on wellness for incoming first-years.
The course is currently titled “Thrive at CMU” and has received approval from the University Education Council to seek out course instructors.
“In my personal opinion,” Chaurasia said, “if you went to the wellness forum about the issues CMU students had, the number of students who came showed something had to be done.” 
The reasons for the attendees’ diminishing wellness were numerous, she pointed out, “and many were trying to push it under the rug. So we want to help students develop well-roundedness at CMU and enjoy their time here.”
According to Chaurasia, the development of the course is still in the early stages. 
“We’re still working on the syllabus, but we sent out a survey for anyone in the CMU community about what they think. In the beginning of the year, we’re doing introductions to the campus and community, whether it’s academic or extracurricular — and about understanding Pittsburgh, like with buses, Shadyside, and more opportunities that are available. We want people to know about what they have here. Toward midterms, the course will discuss finding resources and how to solve potential problems while here,” she said.
Chaurasia added, “We’ll be piloting the course next year, and there will only be four sections. Classes will be small and offer students advice about what they can do, whether it is academic or extracurricular.” 
When Chaurasia was initially planning for what would become “Thrive at CMU,” she envisioned it either as a StuCo or as a required course similar to “Computing @ Carnegie Mellon” (C@CM). 
She even feels there is a possibility that it can one day replace or be combined with C@CM.
“We’ve gotten the impression from a variety of Student Senators that [C@CM] may not be a useful class, so it may be better to have it as a two-week or online summer course. But it’s a very long process, and hopefully it will become a mandatory course next semester, the semester after, or at some point,” Chaurasia said.
In favor of the idea is Deepak Gopalakrishnan, a first-year mechanical engineering major.
“Well, it’s definitely an interesting topic that would benefit students. And if it does eventually replace C@CM, I wouldn’t mind, because I thought C@CM was kind of pointless,” he said. 
First-year mechanical engineering major Nick Gray, on the other hand, does not like the idea of having a wellness class — nor does he favor C@CM. “I feel that both courses are unnecessary for freshmen. It’s something you just have to develop as an ability in high school or on your own,” he said. “Although it’s nice to see CMU care about its students and what they value, it’s important for freshmen to understand and learn some of these things on their own.”
There have also been events and competitions to address stress culture, including last January’s Town Hall. According to a recent university press release, “The nonprofit organization LEAD Pittsburgh has developed an online program designed to help college students navigate the challenges of their often stressful environment without succumbing to depression or other behavioral health disorders.” Just last week, an awards ceremony acknowledged the winners of a LEAD essay contest.
Chaurasia aims to have “Thrive at CMU” offered to first-years in fall 2014.

Important changes to the Student Body Constitution, Student Government Fiscal Policy, and Joint Funding Committee (JFC) bylaws were passed last Thursday after being approved by both the Graduate Student Assembly (GSA) and Student Senate.
The changes clarify many fiscal processes and are meant to increase the transparency of the JFC, which is the student-run organization responsible for allocating student activities fee money to Carnegie Mellon student organizations. 
Previously, what was required of the JFC and student body vice president for finance (SBVPF) did not necessarily align with what was written in the bylaws. 
Jon Mark, current SBVPF and senior lighting design major, said, “We’re going to do what we’re supposed to do [at fiscal close], but you’d rather it match up with the documents as best as it possibly can.”
Some of the recent changes have been in discussion since last year. 
As SBVPF, Mark examined the issues and proposed revisions. 
Senior computer science major and executive cabinet constitutional adviser Stephen Tjader then formally wrote the changes in constitutional language. 
The executive committee approved the documents and presented them to the GSA and Student Senate, leading to their eventual enactment.
Student Body President and senior economics and statistics and decision science double major Will Weiner said, “I think the biggest thing is open communication between groups, letting them know realistically the way we’re funding things.... One of the things Jon’s done best is working with groups to help them achieve their objectives. [The SBVPF] is there to help groups make sure they’re spending their money well. He’s is not there to tell them exactly what to do, but they’re there as a resource.”
Changes to the student body constitution include giving the SBVPF the ability to place any student government-recognized student organization on financial probation, including organizations that are not funded by JFC.
Currently, non-JFC funded organizations are not evaluated at fiscal close to determine if they are functioning in a fiscally responsible way. 
These organizations can then fall into debt, causing them to spend reserve JFC money, even though they do not originally request JFC funding.
Regarding this change, Weiner said, “I think it’s an important move to one, make sure activities fee money is being used only for activities fee purposes, and then two, any time a group is in that level of debt. We should take a look to make sure they’re being managed properly to help them achieve their mission.”
Organizations can be placed on one of two types of probations: supervised probation and controlled probation. 
If an organization goes into a debt that is more than 10 percent of its total budget, it is placed on supervised probation.
If an organization has debt greater than 25 percent of its budget, it is put on controlled probation.
Under controlled probation, an organization must have all of its purchases signed off by the SBVPF. 
Additionally, the SBVPF meets with organizations on probation approximately once per month.
Organizations placed on probation will retain the ability to appeal probation to either the GSA or Student Senate.
Regarding reactions to this change, Mark said, “I’ve really only heard [a few] reactions. One, is this increasing the powers of the VP of finance? And the answer is yes, it is, because it’s basically saying that I can now put a group that is not funded by the Activities Fee on probation…. I’d rather give the VPF the ability to — before a group gets to a bad point — have more proactive activities and give developmental help.”
Revisions to the student government fiscal policy include the addition of a non-degree-seeking activities fee, which is the portion of the activities fee that is paid by non-degree-seeking students.
There are approximately eight to 10 non-degree-seeking students per year, usually staff or community members taking one or two classes. 
These students are eligible to participate in student activities if they pay the activities fee. 
The amended student government fiscal policy states that the non-degree-seeking activities fee will go directly into the 90–30 Fund account, which is the collection of JFC funds from the Student Senate and GSA. 
Therefore, the non-degree-seeking activities fee will go directly toward funding student organizations.
Additionally, the stipulation that student organizations on controlled probation can only receive 90 percent of their previous year’s subsidy has been removed.
Changes to the Joint Funding Committee bylaws include requiring the JFC to set metrics prior to reviewing budgets. 
Specifically, within two weeks after the budget submission deadline, the JFC must approve a list of funding metrics by way of majority vote. 
The JFC must adhere to these metrics throughout the budgeting process, unless overruled by a three-fourths majority at a JFC meeting. The metrics will be released to all organizations eligible for JFC funding SBVPF-elect and sophomore statistics major Jalen Poteat said, “At this point, I haven’t heard too much, either positive or negative. I’m not expecting there to be too much negative feedback.”
“I don’t think the organizations know a whole ton about [the changes]…. I’d hope groups are appreciative of attempts at increased transparency,” Weiner said. 
Poteat intends to fully implement the changes Mark has made.
“A lot of the things Jon [changed], I want to follow through on and see if they go through well.... First semester, one thing I really want to do is work with [Student Body Vice President of Organizations] Corinne [Rockoff] and reach out to the organizations a little bit more... to see how all the organizations are doing at the beginning.”
Mark similarly stated, “Had I had more time in the fall and wasn’t focused on the activities fee increase so much, I would have spent more time helping groups that were on probation… and provided organizations with even more resources.”

Carnegie Mellon’s Wilton E. Scott Institute for Energy Innovation was recently the beneficiary of a $30 million donation from the Richard King Mellon Foundation. 
This donation comes as one in a series of recent large donations the university has received to sponsor the creation or maintenance of crucial educational departments. 
These contributions also follow the fundraising by the Inspire Innovation initiative, which raised over $1 billion, exceeding its fundraising goal for the university.
The Inspire Innovation campaign was intended, according to website, to “increase the power and reach of Carnegie Mellon. In practical terms, this means building our endowment.”
The money raised is meant to be split among several categories, including “Retaining and Enhancing a World-Class Faculty,” “Supporting a New Generation of Student Innovators,” “Sustaining a Foundation of Excellence,” and “Enhancing an Innovative Environment.”
Carnegie Mellon’s information website about the endowment describes it as “a collection of individual funds established by donors and managed by the university as a set of pooled assets.”
Practically, this means that the endowment is not a lump sum that the university can allocate as needed, but is rather a set of many funds, coming from various donors, meant to achieve specific philanthropic goals. The endowment is meant to be self-propelled, according to the website.  
“Invested wisely, endowment principal grows while the income it generates makes possible the investments necessary to maintain excellence and to seize opportunities that might otherwise go elsewhere or be lost entirely.”
According to their website, the Richard King Mellon Foundation — created in 1947 by Richard King Mellon, president of Mellon Bank — is a trust with assets of over $1.9 billion used for various economic, philanthropic, and environmentally beneficial projects. 
This donation has been allocated to Carnegie Mellon’s efforts to expand its initiatives toward energy research, education, and innovation. 
This comes in the wake of the announcement of the creation of the Scott Institute in September 2012, created to address a range of environmental issues and to develop more efficient energy solutions.
The Richard King Mellon Foundation donation is the largest private foundation grant in Carnegie Mellon’s history, breaking the $25 million record set in 2007, also by the Richard King Mellon Foundation. 
The 2007 donation was invested in initiatives in the life-sciences fields, particularly focusing on research and educating future leaders in the field.
In addition, part of the $25 million was used to start a Life Sciences Competitiveness Fund, which supported the hiring of new faculty, construction of new labs, and establishment of a President Scholars Fund, according to a university press release.
Although the recent donation from the Richard King Mellon Foundation is the largest private foundation grant in the university’s history, the largest donation from an individual was from former steel executive William S. Dietrich II, in the form of a $265 million grant meant to aid in the interdisciplinary fusion of liberal arts and technical fields that characterizes Carnegie Mellon. 
As a result, Carnegie Mellon’s school of Humanities and Social Sciences was renamed after his mother, Mariana Brown Dietrich, in 2011.
Dietrich — who earned his Ph.D. from the University of Pittsburgh and was on the Pitt Board of Trustees — was also a longtime Carnegie Mellon trustee.
Dietrich’s donation is the eighth-largest gift to a university nationally and 14th worldwide.
Dietrich also donated $125 million to the University of Pittsburgh, eclipsing the former highest donation of $41.3 million in 2007 from Ansys founder John Swanson.
Dietrich was president of Dietrich Industries—one of the largest manufacturers of steel framing studs in the world from 1968 to 1998 — according to the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette. 
Dietrich’s gifts to Carnegie Mellon and the University of Pittsburgh were granted upon his death on Oct. 6, 2011, at the age of 73.
Before Dietrich’s gift, the largest donation from an individual to Carnegie Mellon was from David A. Tepper and his wife Marlene, from whom the Tepper School of Business takes its name. 
Tepper was the founder of Appaloosa Management, a hedge fund created in 1993. After earning his B.A. from the University of Pittsburgh, Tepper received his MBA from Carnegie Mellon.
The recent gift from the Richard King Mellon Foundation is one part of a long history of donations to the university.
“We are deeply grateful to the Richard King Mellon Foundation for this generous gift,” President Jared Cohon said in a university press release. 
“Developing sustainable energy solutions is of fundamental importance for America and the world, and this gift will play a key role in helping the university and the Scott Institute solve some of our most important energy challenges,” Cohon said.

Victoria Espinel, the U.S. Intellectual Property Enforcement Coordinator for the Executive Office of the President, gave a talk in Hamburg Hall at noon last Thursday as part of the Heinz College Convocation open forum series. Titled “Protecting U.S. Intellectual Property: A View from the Front Lines,” Espinel’s lecture covered how one manages to wind up in such an obscure yet important position and offered a look at the current issues facing the United States in the realm of intellectual property enforcement.
Espinel’s talk was divided into two categories: The biography of her professional life, and what her department is currently engaged in doing. In terms of career, she offered several key pieces of advice to those gathered there. “Do things that intimidate you,” Espinel urged students, saying that she would never have reached her current position if she had not made career moves that were not “safe.” Students were also advised to find their own styles and not to worry about being credited with work.
“If you’re building a team,” Espinel said, “hire people better than you, people who want your job.” She argued that people after your job will be motivated to prove themselves, meanwhile making you look good so that there will be a job for you to move on to.
Those strategies served Espinel well as she made her way from law school to law school, going from a job as a securities lawyer to working in telecommunications law. Ultimately, Espinel found herself as an expert on copyright issues after she registered for a semester at a school in London where the professor she intended to take classes with was on sabbatical. Espinel was appointed to her current position in September of 2009 by President Obama, and was confirmed by congress shortly after.
“Protection of intellectual property is critical to our economy,” Espinel said, citing former chairman of the Federal Reserve Alan Greenspan’s claim that the U.S. economy is currently based more on conceptual goods as opposed to physical goods. On a related note, she argued that the trade deficit is not quite so dire as it may appear if one takes into account that it is offset by a trade surplus in services and intellectual properties.
The main concern in the world of intellectual property enforcement seems to be trade secrets. Manufacturing processes and technological advancements are of critical importance to some businesses, but to stay effective in the face of globalization it is often necessary to share important pieces of intellectual property in regions where they are at risk of being pirated.
However, Espinel stressed that “the country should be “supporting companies even if they move jobs overseas, but they need to do it in a way that makes sure that they retain their value to the U.S.”
While fielding questions, Espinel commented on some of the more sensitive issues in international copyright law. While she acknowledged the need for relaxing some of the stricter parts of Intellectual Property Law in regards to technology transfers with developing countries, it is important to prevent “forced technology transfers, [with] companies being forced to hand over know-how” by foreign powers.
Audience reaction to Espinel’s lecture was positive. Master’s student in public policy and management Adhithi Adhi said, “It was nice to know what the current administration is doing about trade secrets and copyright.” Adhi appreciated the talk for helping her understand an issue she didn’t know much about , having come from India.
Ian Kloo, a fellow master’s student in public policy and management also enjoyed the talk. “[It’s] not super related to my studies but it’s a hot topic.” Kloo was also pleased with the forum series as a whole. “In general the Convocations have been pretty good, they’ve managed to get pretty high-level people.”

Thrive at CMU
The wellness course StuCo that Student Senate is developing for incoming students, titled “Thrive at CMU,” recently received approval from the University Education Council to find instructors for the course. The organizers’ goal is to have the syllabus completed by the conclusion of this semester. 
Academic Integrity Policy
Holly Hippensteel, assistant dean of student affairs, spoke to the Senate to request endorsement of the university’s new academic integrity policy. 
The policy has already been endorsed by faculty senate, CMU Qatar’s Student Majlis and the Graduate Student Assembly. It will also be presented to the president’s council. 
A discussion was held on the amount of collaboration with other students on assignments allowed in this new policy, as well as the need for students to communicate with faculty members about assignment-specific rules for collaboration.
Student Senate voted to endorse the new academic integrity policy.
Special Allocation: SPIRIT 
SPIRIT requested $250 from Student Senate for its booth and buggy expenses. The organization held an event to raise money, but scheduled it at the same time as Greek Sing, so attendance was lower than anticipated. Senate chose not to allocate the requested amount, and voted to allocate $0 to SPIRIT.
Table Sharing
Student Senate declared the new table-sharing program in Tazza D’Oro a success, and is evaluating the potential for implementing this system in the University Center next semester, depending on cost. Table sharing was developed to remedy the chronic shortage of tables in Tazza D’Oro, and  the program cost Senate $54 to implement.
Campus Life
Student Senate discussed developments in campus life. The athletic photos in the University Center have now been updated, and details surrounding the gallery crawl event were recently finalized. This event took students to visit the Aviary, Andy Warhol Museum, and the Mattress Factory.

Walking around last week, I discovered the solution to the university's stress culture: relocating campus 1,000 miles south.
After all, this is the tale of two campuses — the icy Carnegie Mellon where students stay inside the lonely library and a mild Carnegie Mellon where young students gather outside for no other reason than that it feels good. Judging from the way students relaxed on the Cut not worrying about their assignments or mid-terms last week, maybe good weather is the best therapy.
All kidding aside, it’s somewhat discomforting how happiness and its counterpart can be so circumstantial. Some people are only happy in a relationship. A difficult test can ruin a weekend. The weather can make or break one’s day.
In some cases, circumstantial happiness can be extreme, like for those who have seasonal affective disorder (SAD) — a disorder recognized by the American Psychiatric Association and characterized by depression symptoms that occur during seasonal changes.
Realizing how much happiness depends on external circumstances, I have thought about how unfortunate it is and what I can do to change it — how I can maintain a consistent emotional state unaffected by the worst Pittsburgh weather and the highest levels of workload. People diagnosed with SAD can undergo light therapy, but I need something else.
Theoretically, I know this kind of emotional state is possible. After all, there are people who claim happiness is the simple byproduct of living a fulfilling life. They are drunk on life, if you will. These people never have to search for happiness because it’s in everything they do, and their emotions don’t depend on the people around them, external events, or the weather. I wish I could be the same.
However, striving for this internal peace only makes me more anxious. It’s hard not to have a bad day when you step in a puddle with the shoe that has a hole. Realizing that a better person would keep walking while I curse my soaked shoe only makes me feel inferior and magnifies the problem of a wet shoe.
On the other hand, maybe it’s okay for our emotions to be circumstantial. It’s okay to have bad days.
Part of what made the weather last week so beautiful was just how dreadful winter was. The worst friends make you appreciate the good ones. And the busiest weekdays make you appreciate the weekends.
I still don’t think circumstantial happiness is ideal, especially at a school with such volatile weather and high academic standards, but I’ve stopped beating myself up over trying to maintain a level emotional state no matter what. 
I don’t like having bad days but they make me appreciate the occasion when everything goes right. Give me any two days, and I’ll immediately pick the one with less clouds and the more mild temperatures. Circumstantial happiness may not be ideal, but there are times when it's just fine.

Albert Einstein said it best: “Everyone is a genius. But if you judge a fish on its ability to climb a tree, it will spend the rest of its life thinking it’s stupid.” Sadly, this seems to be an accurate representation of the American education system right now. Things like standardized testing and the No Child Left Behind Act — which perpetuate this mentality — are detrimental to kids, their education, and society.
In Pennsylvania specifically, state-wide testing — the Pennsylvania System of School Assessment (PSSA) — is required for all grades up to eighth-grade, as well as 11th-grade. Schools get funding based on how well their students do, so they pressure the students to do well on these tests. This method of evaluating student progress does not turn out well for the students. Now that parents are starting to realize this, there has been a 21 percent increase of PSSA opt-outs for reading and math and a 36 percent increase for science from the 2010-11 year to the 2011-12 year, according to the Pennsylvania Department of Education. This increase represents a vested interest in how our public schools are run, and a rise in interest for change.
Throughout the year, students are force-fed information that will only matter for the test. It’s not just that teachers are teaching to the test — they’re forcing practice materials and worksheets on kids who don’t necessarily want to learn at all. When the kids ask “Why does this even matter?” as kids do, there is almost no other answer to give them than, “It’ll be on the PSSA.” Some kids that genuinely like learning and who unashamedly question just about anything turn into either robots that mechanically spout answers or sighing sarcastic children that don’t want anything to do with school.
Additionally, teaching to state tests and forcing kids to learn one skill set — knowing how to take tests well — will not only set them back after school, but turn them further away from the notion of education or learning. We all realize that being well-rounded is better than only being well versed in one subject — so why should education be any different? Kids go through the education system learning for tests, then spend the next week purging all of that information to cram the next test’s material into their heads.
These issues don't even account for all of the students that fall through the cracks because they can’t take tests well. Right now, all of these students go around believing their worth and intelligence is based on how well they do on tests, which shouldn’t be the case. We need to first teach these kids that their self-worth should not be based on their intelligence and that their intelligence should not be based on their standardized testing scores.
This entire system is detrimental to society. These kids that have been taught to the test all of their lives will eventually enter society to become working members of the human race, and all they will know instead is how to memorize and regurgitate and not how to learn. Even the ones who succeed in their test-taking endeavors and get good grades in school — while they might have even learned some things along the way — are still only thinking of things in terms of the next goal, the next success, the next presentation. They don't consider what they’re doing until then.
Putting Federal mandates on standardized testing is even worse. Schools with poor grades are doing poorly for a reason. Usually that reason is a lack of money and resources. Punishing schools that cannot teach their students well enough to pass the tests by taking away more of their money seems counterintuitive to me. There is no reward for doing well on the tests — only punishment for the schools and the teachers that fail to pass their students. Even schools that are doing well and can’t do better get shunted.
If we just stopped these Federal mandates and put the pressure off schools, we would stop pressuring both the schools and kids into thinking that the only way to a better life is to swallow chunks of information and then spit them back up. These issues would be mitigated, albiet slightly. The long-term solution would be to teach these kids how to think instead of what to think — to get them interested in learning — but that's a long way off.
The public education system has a lot wrong with it, but standardized testing encompasses most of these problems. The purpose of standardized testing is to set equal opportunity — a way to see where students stand compared to other students of the same grade — and level the playing field. But in the end it’s analogous to saying to a fish: “Climb that tree — the same tree as everyone else  —  so I can test your ability fairly.”

As Congress debates an immigration bill that increases border security and creates an amnesty route for domestic illegal immigrants, I find myself wondering, "Why can’t anyone just come here, fill out some paperwork and then start paying taxes? Why don’t we have an open immigration policy?"
Asking others these questions, I’ve found that there’s no good answer. Maybe the lack of open immigration policy is just xenophobia or a resistance to change or new ideas. After all, the anti-immigrant mentality can be traced back to the “Know-Nothing” party of the 1860’s. This mentality isn’t a relatively new idea in American politics, it’s just not a beneficial one.
As Republicans are eager to point out, immigrants — Latinos in particular — are thought to be generally hardworking, have strong family values, and yearn to have better lives for their children, according to a study by the Pew Hispanic Center. Does this sound familiar? These are people just like our ancestors who were trying to achieve the American Dream. Is there really any good reason why they shouldn’t be allowed to live here?
Our country can only stand to benefit, especially from an economic perspective, by allowing more law-abiding, motivated, and hardworking citizens into this country.
Additionally, if we had an open immigration policy, the STAPLE (Stopping Trained in America PhDs From Leaving the Economy) Act wouldn’t even be debated. According to Mark Zuckerberg in The Washington Post, 40 percent of STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics) Ph.D. candidates get educated in American universities and then go elsewhere to apply their skills. The STAPLE Act tries to keep these intelligent people in our country by “stapling” a green card to their diploma. An open immigration policy solves this problem altogether.
Our fragile economy can’t afford to lose these intelligent, highly motivated immigrants, and it also can’t afford to lose workers who may not have a college education but can still contribute to our economy.
Every single model of economic growth shows that the economy grows when more people work. At a time when economic growth has stalled, adding more people to the workforce at any skill level will increase the Gross Domestic Product (GDP). 
An open immigration policy might be a great way to get the economy going again. Additionally, it might allow us to document the illegal immigrants who live here already so they can start paying taxes.
Finally, an open immigration policy is simply the moral thing to do. Living in the U.S. shouldn’t only be possible to those lucky few who happen to have been born here, know someone, or marry a citizen. Anyone who wants to live in America should be able to. 
We pride ourselves on being the “great American melting pot.” That shouldn't stop because we’re afraid of a few foreigners.
We stand to reap huge benefits by welcoming newcomers with open arms. As a nation of immigrants, we created the wealthiest country on Earth. We can keep that up by continuing the open immigration policy that we once had.

As an exchange student from Germany at Carnegie Mellon, I have scrutinized the education systems  of American and Germany; I became curious to know if there are fields in which the problems of both countries are similar. 
Indeed, on both sides of the Atlantic, people have issues with grade inflation and allocating university funds to where they are most needed.
Often, grades given in both countries do not accurately reflect a student’s academic performance. It is not just American schools that make their students look better by refraining from giving bad grades; German universities are guilty as well. According to one of the largest German newspapers, Süddeutsche Zeitung, there are certain subjects that consistently favor good grades. Natural sciences, while allegedly difficult subjects, yield very high grades. In a study conducted by the German Science Council, biology majors were found to only have a 2 percent chance of graduating with anything less than a B-. It is unlikely that this trend is only due to high dropout rates, which are a product of the effort to let only the best students graduate. I cannot help but think that a student could earn a B today with the same amount of work that would have earned him or her a C 30 years ago.
Furthermore, different educational institutions seem to use different scales in grading. The council found that German majors from the University of Giessen had a GPA of 1.6 as opposed to students from the Humboldt-University Berlin, who scored a 2.2, with 1.0 and 4.0 being the highest and lowest grades, respectively. 
According to Süddeutsche Zeitung, experts have recognized the need for a more accurate standardized grading system, making graduates comparable. Like the U.S., my home country has a strong federalist tendency and there are no common standards of what students must know after completing their degrees. 
This ambition might sound strange to those in America, where the distinction between elite institutions like Harvard University and average state colleges is striking. In Germany, however, most universities are public and are therefore responsible for teaching the same materials. 
While it makes sense for the German system to strive toward more equality, it would not make sense for the U.S. to adapt the same behavior, as its private universities are the beacon of the world already.
After studying at Carnegie Mellon for two semesters, I’ve become accustomed to the fact that some exams that are impossible to fail. Still, it was rather surprising to learn that it has not always been like this. According to The Economist, 43 percent of all grades given at universities are As. This number is a startling 28 percent higher than in 1960. While this is not as drastic as monetary inflation over the same period, it is fair to talk about a “creeping grade inflation” that can only be detrimental to the quality in higher learning. As the grading scale is limited, students may eventually hit a saturation point, meaning that the average GPA may approach 4.0. This similarity among academics could reduce the amount of information that can be concluded from grades. Then, college education becomes a prerequisite for a white-collar job and the highest paying jobs will require ridiculously impressive achievements, such as founding a nonprofit organization before the age of 20.
Germany and the U.S. both struggle to add more value to education per dollar spent. In Germany, the government favors some universities by giving them extra research grants. The German Science Council plays a major role here, deciding which of the many institutions deserves to become part of the Initiative for Excellence. Unfortunately, undergraduate equipment remains in a deplorable condition as most government grants are directed toward high-level laboratory equipment.
Two efforts recently occurred to counteract this tendency. In 2011, the ministry for education started the “Pact for Teaching Quality,” dividing 400 million euros among 102 universities. What seems like a small amount of distributed funds is all the government can afford. 
Additionally, a few professors have become more aware of the chronically underfunded teaching sector, and have started a grassroots movement themselves, according to German newspaper Die Zeit. Part of the movement’s efforts include offering workshops for professors to show that giving a lecture is more than just skipping through PowerPoint slides.
Individual efforts like these will constitute an important component in striving toward a brighter future.
While they are not underfunded, American universities struggle to make their invested money have an impact. According to the National Center for Education Statistics, the U.S. spends a higher percentage of its GDP on education than any other country in the world. However, America still finds itself outside the top 10 when it comes to the percentage of citizens with a college degree, according to The Economist. The U.S. only places 15th in this category. 
Even if a student completes his  or her four-year degree — and only 60 percent of them do — his or her debt will accumalte over the years to an average of $26,000, says the Institute For College Access & Success. That, coupled with the fact that college education does not guarantee a well-paid job nowadays, means young people could soon be looking for other educational options.
In conclusion, similar problems in higher education emerge in both Germany and the United States. It seems like both systems are stuck in a vicious cycle of struggling to improve the learning experience and of making graduates more suitable for the labor market today. Governments and university officials prefer taking shortcuts in order to meet today’s requirements rather than address the root causes of the problems. However, giving every graduate exceptional grades is likely to backfire in the near future. 
In order to keep the high education standard, we have to re-evaluate our grading standards and wisely spend money on causes that bring us closer to our goal of educating citizens to shape the world of tomorrow.
This article is the third and final in a series of articles detailing the realizations of an exchange student studying at Carnegie Mellon.

The responses of many citizens to former Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher’s death have been disgraceful. Thatcher, who suffered from dementia for many years, died at 87 of a stroke on April 8. When news of her death hit the British news, it caused a variety of reactions, some of which were highly negative, such as public burnings of Thatcher’s picture, as well as street parties all across the United Kingdom. “Ding Dong! The Witch is Dead”  from The Wizard of Oz reached 10th place in U.K. charts within two days of Thatcher’s death, according to The Independent.
Thatcher was a controversial figure. Her death does not dismiss the problems of her time in office, nor should it prevent discussion of her strengths and weaknesses as a leader. However, burning her picture and dancing in the streets after her death is disrespectful to the public servant, no matter how controversial her policies were.
Celebrating anyone’s death is questionable even in the most extreme of situations. Thatcher was a severely unpopular leader in some parts of the United Kingdom, due to a variety of legislation she instituted, including blocks on union power and the privatization of heavy industry. Her political and economic policy of monetarism, privatization, and self-help, known as Thatcherism, did not endear her to all of the United Kingdom, as it led to high unemployment and financial inequality.
Despite many people’s intense feelings about her, Thatcher was a human being, and celebrating her death is morally problematic. Many reactions to her death — like burning her picture and equating her to a witch — are personal attacks on Thatcher, not criticisms of her policies. While rejoicing in Thatcher’s absence from politics is acceptable, celebrating her death is not a justifiable way to criticize her policies.Thatcher was neither an economic savior nor a miserly dictator; she was loved and hated in Britain with equal passion.
Attacking leaders in a personal way does not lead to change; Thatcher was the face of her policies. But playing “Ding Dong! The Witch is Dead” on repeat does not change conservative U.K. policies. Passion has an extremely important place in politics, but it must be properly directed — at policies, not public servants ­— to be useful.

Three decades ago, Jimmy Zhu came to Carnegie Mellon University from China to study in the United States. Today, he is a professor at Carnegie Mellon University and is helping to establish a graduate school in China — the Joint Institute of Engineering at Sun Yat-sen University. Carnegie Mellon is hiring employees for the Chinese university and is exporting much of its curriculum to the school.
Carnegie Mellon University is not the only university attempting to establish universities or partnerships in China. 
The University of Pittsburgh is developing an undergraduate engineering program at China’s Sichuan University that is estimated to enroll students by 2014. The University of Michigan, New York University, and Duke University are also forming partnerships with universities in China.
University collaborations across borders make clear how small the world is. The Tartan commends Carnegie Mellon University and Jimmy Zhu for their efforts to introduce curriculums and institutions that could both give Chinese students advantages in the global marketplace and universities a more prominent standing internationally.
This trend of partnering with foreign universities establishes invaluable global connections. As the officials at the University of Pittsburgh and Carnegie Mellon hope, the university’s involvement in China could create pathways for business partnerships on a global scale.
According to Trib Total Media, Guangzhou, the area where Sun Yat-sen University is located, is considered a “major enterprise zone in southern China” but does not have its own engineering program. By partnering with Sun Yat-sen University to develop an engineering program, Carnegie Mellon University is introducing education that may benefit this area’s citizens and, in turn, make them more willing to establish connections with the university.
By decreasing the gap between countries and increasing collaborative efforts, universities create more opportunities to provide students with educations that could benefit the global marketplace for both Chinese and American students.

Under30CEO.com, a website geared to young business leaders, recently ranked Pittsburgh as the tenth medium-sized city for young entrepreneurs.
The environment to inspire growth and small business development exists in the city for numerous reasons, one being that Pittsburgh is home to Carnegie Mellon, the University of Pittsburgh, and other prominent colleges and universities.
Focusing on small businesses and enabling passionate people to create jobs has made Pittsburgh more attractive to future entrepreneurs and has also redefined the city’s identity. In the early 1980s, Pittsburgh struggled economically after the collapse of the steel industry, and a mass exodus of people looked for employment elsewhere. 
In recent years, though, Carnegie Mellon’s focus on computer science, robotics, and technology — as well as research done by the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center — has helped Pittsburgh establish an identity of innovation and research. 
Pittsburgh is also becoming a Hollywood hotspot, as evidenced by The Dark Knight Rises and other blockbusters like The Perks of Being a Wallflower. 
More importantly, the growth of these fields brings more world-class talent to the city. By encouraging gifted individuals and teams to develop their ventures in its prestigious universities, Pittsburgh offers a sustainable path for economic growth that other Midwest cities lack.
According to the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette, the McCune Foundation has given a $7 million grant to Carnegie Mellon to combine Project Olympus and the Donald H. Jones Center for Entrepreneurship, two of the university’s prominent startup initiatives.
Endeavors such as these are vital to Pittsburgh’s continued success. Carnegie Mellon and its students should be proud that their talents are being recognized and rewarded by others.
Despite the frequent complaints about the weather, Pittsburgh is a wonderful city: In recent years, it’s taken the top spot in numerous "Most Livable City in the U.S." reports.
The incentive for people to live here is only increasing thanks to measures such as the McCune grant and the prominence of Carnegie Mellon. Pittsburgh provides wonderful resources for future leaders and has the foundations to build an even brighter future.
