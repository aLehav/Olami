Carnegie Mellon’s women’s soccer team kicked off its season with one tie (1–1) and one loss (3–2) in this weekend’s DoubleTree Tartan Cup. The Tartans started the season ranked fifth, their highest-ever national ranking, in the NSCAA/Continental Tire Division III.
The first game of the DoubleTree Tartan Cup, a tournament among the top ten nationally ranked teams, featured Carnegie Mellon against Ohio Northern University last Saturday. 
The Ohio Northern Polar Bears struck first 26 minutes into the game. Goalkeeper Anna Albi was forced to leave her net due to a challenge on the right wing by Ohio Northern’s Sandy Plunkett.
Down 1–0 at halftime, the Tartans dominated the second half. In the 54th minute, junior forward Amanda So scored The Tartans’ first and only goal of the match. 
The goal came after senior defender Rachel Contopoulos lobbed a pass right behind the Ohio Northern defense to So, who anticipated the ball and snuck it beneath the goalie. Despite controlling most of the possession and outshooting the Polar Bears 12–2, the Tartans failed to score the decisive goal, resulting in a 1–1 tie.
The following game on Sunday saw Carnegie Mellon women’s soccer team facing Johns Hopkins University, ranked as the seventh-best team nationally. 
In the 18th minute, So opened up the scoring again for the Tartans. So made it a hat trick for the weekend when she scored six minutes later after a through pass from sophomore Carson Quiros.
Johns Hopkins responded and evened the score within the next seven minutes. Hopkins scored the game-winning goal in the 56th minute with a penalty kick by Sydney Teng and would hold onto the lead for a 3–2 victory.
On Wednesday, Carnegie Mellon’s women’s soccer team will travel to Washington & Jefferson College to compete against the Presidents and try to improve their 1–1–1 record.

The Carnegie Mellon men's soccer team began September with a crushing double overtime loss at Dickinson College last Saturday, only to emerge victorious in a shutout at Elizabethtown College yesterday, bringing their record to 3–1.
The match started with an early Dickinson lead after their only regulation goal by Dickinson midfielder Isaac Pitkow in the fifth minute. It wasn’t until the second half that the Tartans got on the board with senior midfielder Matt Sarett’s score against Dickinson goalkeeper Reed Milbrath with less than 15 minutes in regulation left.
However, the major upset came in double overtime with two seconds left, when Dickinson forward Alfred Hylton-Dei scored, with a final score of 2–1 in Dickinson’s favor.
Senior midfielder Mike Ferraco gave the Dickinson team credit for their performance on the field. ”Dickinson was the best team we played this week,” Ferraco said. “The best team we’ve played so far.”
The main talking point of the match against Dickinson was definitely how unbelievably close it was between the two teams. “It was a crazy game, really bizarre,” said senior defender Ben Bryant. Ferraco agreed, saying that, “It was ridiculous game, everything that could have happened did.”
After the heartbreaking defeat at Dickinson, the Tartans were ready to bring their A-game to Elizabethtown, Pa. for their next match. “We were trying to learn some lessons from [Saturday]’s loss,” Bryant said.
After an early barrage of shots by the Tartans against Elizabethtown, senior defender/midfielder Jerome Reano delivered, scoring the only goal of the game in the 42nd minute. With some crucial saves by junior goalkeeper Jacob Rice, the team was able to hold for a 1-0 shutout win against Elizabethtown, leaving the Tartans with a 3–1 record.
The team was motivated after Saturday to execute and come back strong on Sunday. “We bounced back really well today,” Ferraco said. “It’s hard to come off of a loss like that.”
Four games into the season, the team is looking forward to making the grade. “Our next few games are where we are really going to have to prove ourselves,” Ferraco said. 
The Tartans are hopeful that their experiences so far in the season will help do exactly that. “You learn from your mistakes,” Bryant said, “and that’s something we want to carry on.”
The men’s soccer team will face Geneva College this Wednesday at a 7 p.m. match at home, followed by an away game against Allegheny College on Saturday at 1 p.m.

After four teasing weeks of preseason while only getting glimpses of the starters, we finally get some real football. This weekend saw the start of the NFL season, and predictions abound as to how each NFL division will finish come January.
AFC East
For the past decade, this division has been dominated by the New England Patriots under head coach Bill Belichick and quarterback Tom Brady. The Miami Dolphins represent the only real threat to their reign, but even with their high-profile free-agent acquisitions of wide receiver Mike Wallace and linebacker Dannell Ellerbe, they still appear to be a few years and few playmakers away. 
The Buffalo Bills and New York Jets are starting rookie quarterbacks E. J. Manuel and Geno Smith, respectively. Both teams rely heavily on their defense, but neither looks to be a serious contender.
AFC North
Home to the Super Bowl champions Baltimore Ravens and the Pittsburgh Steelers, this is shaping up to be the toughest division in the AFC yet again. 
The Ravens, Steelers, and Cincinnati Bengals are likely playoff contenders. The Bengals look to be in the driver’s seat to win the division with third-year quarterback Andy Dalton and his top target A. J. Green. Combined with the best defensive line in the league, these assets have turned the Bengals into a Super Bowl threat. The Ravens are dealing with major losses on both sides of the ball with leader Ray Lewis retiring and veteran wide receiver Anquan Boldin being traded away. The Steelers are still aging and returning many of the same pieces that produced a disappointing 8–8 season a year ago. The Cleveland Browns, while improving, are still easily the worst in this division.
AFC South
The Houston Texans look to make another appearance as division winners under defensive lineman J. J. Watt and running back Arian Foster. The only major addition is former Ravens safety Ed Reed, who is starting off the season with an injury. The Indianapolis Colts surprisingly made the playoffs last year under then-rookie quarterback Andrew Luck and look to repeat the feat this year. It may be difficult, though, as many expect the team to hit a sophomore slump and take a step or two back. The Tennessee Titans and Jacksonville Jaguars are both trying to evaluate their young quarterbacks, Jake Locker and Blaine Gabbert, in an attempt to decide whether or not to move on from their young projects.
AFC West
The Denver Broncos have put the division in their rear-view mirror as they focus solely on winning the Super Bowl. Quarterback Peyton Manning knows he only has a year or two left and is giving it everything he’s got. The Kansas City Chiefs are a completely new team after trading for quarterback Alex Smith and signing former Philadelphia Eagles head coach Andy Reid. The San Diego Chargers are under new management with a new coach and general manager, but most of the personnel remains the same and thus so will their record. Unsurprisingly, the Oakland Raiders are in disarray with quarterback Terrelle Pryor coming out of nowhere to steal the starting quarterback job.
NFC East
Every year the fate of this division comes down to the last game, and this year seems to be no different. The New York Giants, Dallas Cowboys, and Washington Redskins each had a chance to win the division in the final game of last year’s season and all come back with virtually the same teams. With some substantial injuries to Redskins quarterback Robert Griffin III, and the Cowboys and Giants lines, this will likely be a war of attrition. The only major changes come with the Eagles, where Chip Kelly has replaced Andy Reid as coach. Kelly brings a very up-tempo college offense with him and looks to shake up the NFL, but is likely not to be competitive this season.
NFC North
This is another division that looks to be a dog fight with all four teams having legitimate playoff aspirations. The Green Bay Packers look the best on paper, but their rookie-based running games and sketchy secondary could be their downfall. The Minnesota Vikings’ hopes rest solely on the shoulders of MVP Adrian Peterson, with quarterback Christian Ponder acting more as a facilitator than a playmaker. The Chicago Bears and Detroit Lions both underperformed last year and have serious questions specifically concerning the offense for Chicago and the defense for Detroit.
NFC South
With the return of coach Sean Payton, the New Orleans Saints are looking to bounce back from a disappointing season. The Atlanta Falcons are returning a very similar team to last year’s division-winning squad with veteran running back Steven Jackson replacing Michael Turner. The Tampa Bay Buccaneers and Carolina Panthers are both trying to evaluate their young quarterbacks, Josh Freeman and Cam Newton, who are not quite living up to expectations they set after their first few years in the league.
NFC West
This is by far the most stacked division in the NFL. The San Francisco 49ers and Seattle Seahawks are debatably the top two teams in the NFL and will be slugging it out for the division. Both feature young mobile quarterbacks and very strong defenses. The St. Louis Rams look to make major strides under their second season with coach Jeff Fisher, and they have hope after finishing 4–1–1 in the division last season. 
The Arizona Cardinals are the wild card with new coach Bruce Arians and quarterback Carson Palmer. If Palmer can find his timing with all-pro receiver Larry Fitzgerald, look for the Cardinals to have a good season.

At Carnegie Mellon, students often find themselves spending long nights cramming for tests. Hours of staring at a book can lead to headaches and sometimes frustration as to why something just doesn’t make sense. Clouded by this frustration, many students can sometimes forget the incredible ability of the human brain; it constantly rewires the massive network of nerves to ensure that by the test, the student has mastered the concept at hand.
Scientists have been intrigued by how the brain works for years, and with every day they understand more about what makes thinking, learning, and memory possible. Sandra J. Kuhlman, assistant professor of biological sciences at Carnegie Mellon, explored how inhibitory neurons in the brain function during critical periods of learning. Kuhlman collaborated with researchers at the University of California, Los Angeles and University of California, Irvine; their results were published in the journal Nature.
The neural network can be pictured as a massive system of roads, with thousands of delivery trucks carrying messages from one part of the brain to another. These networks are made up of neurons, nerve cells that transmit electric signals across the cell and release chemicals that generate electrical stimulation of neighboring cells. The propagation of these electric signals around the brain is vital to the brain’s function.
Roads are often connected at intersections governed by traffic lights that control the movement of cars. In the brain, the neural network is constantly being modified by excitatory neurons that act as green lights, allowing for the generation of electrical signals and thus the flow of information from one cell to another. Conversely, inhibitory neurons act as red lights, preventing the propagation of electrical signals. 
Kuhlman and her team wanted to observe the workings of inhibitory neurons during times of heightened learning by exposing mice to new events and stimulating a model for learning. However, 80 percent of neuron cells are excitatory, which posed a challenge to the project. “If you’re just going blindly and observe cells, you are going to learn about excitatory cells because that’s what you will bump into,” Kuhlman said. Such ubiquity makes it difficult to learn about the specific neurons they were interested in.
However, the development of new technologies enabled the study to label different parts of the mouse brain using dyes. Kuhlman’s team utilized this, along with powerful microscopes, to identify the inhibitory neurons and used electrodes to measure active electrical stimulations.
Prior to their experiment, the typical line of thinking was that inhibitory neurons release the chemical neurotransmitter gamma-Aminobutyric acid (GABA); it had been hypothesized that increased GABA enabled the brain to learn things quickly. The researchers, however, chose to investigate this theory.
After teaming with collaborators at UC Irvine, Kuhlman explained that the new ideas brought forth by the new members of the team questioned the theory about GABA, which propelled the team forward. After the experiments, the team learned that when a person has a new experience, inhibition is reduced and less GABA is produced. This leads to the remodeling of circuits in the brain.
Kuhlman found it interesting that “this was only seen in young brains. Older brains can also learn but the inhibition is removed differently and is harder to invoke.” The next step of her research may be to understand how the mechanism works in older brains.
The project challenged a paradigm and changed the way scientists understand the role of inhibitory neurons in these critical periods of learning.

Imagine a future in which you could get in your car, enter your destination in a GPS, and sit back and relax as your vehicle transports you without so much as your finger on the wheel. Well, there’s no need to imagine — that day is already here. A 15-member team at Carnegie Mellon University, consisting of faculty, full-time research staff, post-doctoral researchers, and graduate students worked with General Motors (GM) to develop an autonomous driving car that can navigate through the everyday traffic of the roads of Pittsburgh just as well as — if not better than — any human driver.
Carnegie Mellon has been working in the field of autonomous vehicles since 1986. Raj Rajkumar, a professor in the department of electrical and computer engineering and co-director of the General Motors-Carnegie 
Mellon Autonomous Driving Collaborative Research Lab, became involved in 2006. “There was a competition called the 2007 DARPA [Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency] Urban Challenge,” Rajkumar said. “The competition they had was basically making vehicles that can drive themselves in an urban-like setting through a 60-mile course in less than six hours.” 
On race day, only six teams successfully completed the course, with Carnegie Mellon in first place for a $2 million prize. “This competition made us realize that automated driving vehicles are no longer science fiction,” Rajkumar said.
GM was Carnegie Mellon’s biggest sponsor for the competition. After Carnegie Mellon’s first-place win, GM decided to invest more in the project and started the General Motors-Carnegie Mellon Autonomous Driving Collaborative Research Lab on campus. The lab continued to work on the vehicle from the competition, which was a 2007 Chevy Tahoe; this huge SUV was completely filled with electronics and looked nothing like an ordinary car. “There were about 20 sensors all hanging around the car, and a huge cylinder on top,” Rajkumar said.
However, in 2011 the group bought a Cadillac SRX, a crossover SUV, right from the dealer’s lot here in Pittsburgh. Rajkumar explained that the car was developed using three subsystems. The first was the sensors: “These are radars, cameras, and lasers, which basically sense what is around the vehicle in terms of obstacles, other vehicles, pedestrians, and bicyclists,” Rajkumar said.
The second subsystem is made up of computers that grab this information from the sensors, process it, and fuse it all together. This is the component that determines the location of objects, the speed at which they are moving, and their direction.
“The third subsystem is called the actuators, which basically applies the brakes, sends gas to the engine, shifts the transmission, puts on turn signals, and turns hazard lights on,” he said. This new-and-improved automated vehicle looks like any car you would find on the road, both on the exterior and the interior.
The main benefit to a driverless vehicle — and one of the motivations for its invention — is that they can potentially decrease the amount of vehicular crashes, most of which are caused by human error. “Humans are extremely smart but can be rather stupid as well,” Rajkumar said in a Pittsburgh Post-Gazette article. “We can be distracted, angry, mad, sleepy, drunk, driving while eating, shaving, applying makeup, and even changing clothes. If we can take the basic human emotional and physical problems out of the equation, we expect injuries and fatalities will go down.”
However, there are also some downsides to an automated driving car that the team is still working on improving. For example, the car lacks the intuition and experience that a human being would possess. When it brakes at stop signs or traffic lights, the action seems abrupt when compared to the way a human driver would slow down gradually. 
The car is also unable to characterize the objects it sees the way a person would. The autonomous car has 360-degree coverage, and while humans cannot see past their peripheral vision, the autonomous car can only recognize an object as a person, and can’t differentiate between a child or an older person. It can see signs, but it cannot necessarily read them all. There is also the possibility of sensors failing.
Nevertheless, the future of vehicles has changed with the success of Carnegie Mellon’s and GM’s autonomous car. “The technology [for commercially sold autonomous cars] will be ready by 2020,” Rajkumar said. “But then there is also social acceptance, regulations to put in place, insurance liabilities, and so on, which will take a bit longer.”
Currently, the target price for such a car would be between $5,000–$7,000 in addition to the cost of the car itself. “So for $5,000–$7,000, you would basically have your own chauffeur to drive you around!” Rajkumar said.

Imagine you’re sick. What if your doctor told you that the only way to cure your sickness was by injecting you with millions of viruses? This treatment could be a reality in the next decade, with the growing re-emergence of bacteriophage research and medical therapy.
Named from the Latin root “phage,” which means “to eat,” bacteriophages — also called phages — are viruses that systematically infect and kill bacteria. While they were discovered and used to treat previously incurable infections in the’20s and ’30s, they were abandoned as a remedy after the discovery of antibiotics in the ’40s. However, with increasingly pervasive antibiotic-resistant bacteria, doctors throughout the world are reviving old bacteriophage practices.
Each phage targets a specific strand of bacteria to use as a host. After identifying an accommodating host, the phage injects its genetic material into the bacterial cell, hijacks the machinery of the cell, and converts it into a phage production factory. In this way, the phage helps itself by reproducing and helps humans by eliminating the targeted bacteria.
With the emerging field, faculty at Carnegie Mellon partnered with the Howard Hughes Medical Institute to offer the Phage Genomics Research course to undergraduate first-years from the Mellon College of Science. With the overarching vision of learning more about bacteriophages, the Howard Hughes Medical Institute is working with almost 90 other universities to put on this course.
The course exposes students to research by sending them on a phage hunt. Students have the opportunity to find their own unique phage, sequence its genetic material, name it anything they would like, and publish their phage to a growing database of bacteriophage species. Because phages exist everywhere in the world, students collect a sample of soil from their hometown and bring it with them to Carnegie Mellon. After isolating the phage from the soil through experimental techniques, students use computational methods to sequence its genetic material.
“We are the only institution, of the 87 schools that offer this program, that has our students sequence the DNA of the phages,” said Maggie Braun, one of the course’s teachers and Carnegie Mellon’s assistant head for undergraduate affairs at the Mellon College of Science.
After naming and publishing their results, the students have an opportunity to partake in a group project where they can explore and research any aspect of the phage they wish.
“The biggest thing that I see students get out of the course is making connections between what they heard about in their classes and actually putting those things to use in a lab,” Braun said.
The research course goes beyond introducing students to lab work. Phage research has enormous potential in the field of medicine. Jennifer Huang, a first-year biology major currently taking the course, said, “The phage course is very exciting because it exposes us to research in an emerging field that has intriguing questions yet to be answered.”
There are hundreds of thousands of phage species still to be found, and every additional phage adds to the growing body of research. According to Braun, every student that takes the class has discovered their own unique phage.
Though each student’s work might seem insignificant on the grand scale, people one day might be treated and cured by a phage analyzed by a student at Carnegie Mellon.

At a school that requires students to spend many late nights working, it’s not uncommon to hear a phrase similar to, “I am so addicted to caffeine! It’s awful.” According to U.S. News & World Report, caffeine is a daily ritual for roughly 90 percent of the American population. It is naturally found in chocolate, coffee, and tea, and is added to sodas, energy drinks, and certain diet pills and medications. Though we are accustomed to having caffeine in our daily diets, it is technically classified as a psychoactive stimulant — it alters the chemistry of the brain, and affects our bodies in more ways than we may know.
Once caffeine enters the body, it is absorbed by the small intestine and enters the bloodstream. Since it can dissolve in both water and fat-based substances, it can pass through the blood-brain barrier to enter the brain, according to howstuffworks.com. 
The brain naturally contains the chemical adenosine — which is responsible for making us feel tired — and norepinephrine, a stimulant. When unaffected by caffeine, the brain has a certain amount of receptors for each of these chemicals to bind to in order to maintain the body’s normal cycle of lethargy and alertness.
Caffeine alters the activity of these receptors, largely because of its close resemblance to adenosine. Once caffeine enters the brain, it is recognized by brain receptors as adenosine, and is able to bind to the adenosine receptors. Through this process, caffeine essentially stops adenosine from locking into the brain’s receptors and slows down nerve cell activity. In turn, the sudden increase in brain activity triggers the adrenal glands to produce more adrenaline. As a result, caffeine produces a feeling of alertness that usually lasts from four to six hours — until the caffeine is metabolized. After long-term exposure to caffeine, the brain increases production of adenosine, and decreases production of the stimulant norepinephrine to maintain equilibrium with the caffeine intake. Caffeine’s ability to alter the brain’s chemical production is the root cause of both its adverse and beneficial effects on the body.
Because caffeine blocks adenosine from binding to receptors and slowing down nerve activity, it hinders the body from going into deep sleep, according to Smithsonian Magazine. Long-term use causes a cycle of sleep deprivation. The lack of deep sleep, combined with decreased production of norepinephrine, causes the body to become increasingly dependent on caffeine to remain alert. Therefore, regular caffeine consumers begin to experience withdrawal symptoms after 12–24 hours without consumption. Common withdrawal symptoms include fatigue, headache, difficulty focusing, and depression. Though consuming two to four cups of caffeine per day is generally considered harmless, research has shown that people are likely to build up a tolerance for caffeine after two weeks to one month of consuming it regularly. Fortunately, in most cases, caffeine addiction is not difficult to overcome. After seven to 12 days without caffeine intake, the brain’s production of adenosine and norepinephrine return to their base levels.
The effects of caffeine are not entirely detrimental. Because caffeine blocks adenosine from binding to its receptors, it reduces the risk of developing Parkinson’s disease and is currently being researched as a treatment option. 
In addition, caffeine naturally contains antioxidants and can therefore reduce the risk of contracting diseases such as liver cancer, colon cancer, and diabetes. It can also treat migraines by constricting the brain’s blood vessels. Aside from medical benefits, certain studies show that adults consuming the equivalent of caffeine in one cup of coffee were better able to perform problem solving tasks.

Dolphins and bats may have similar gene evolution
Scientists have recently discovered a set of genes in bottlenose dolphins and some bats that may contribute to their shared ability of echolocation. The study was led by evolutionary geneticist Joe Parker from Queen Mary University of London. The researchers analyzed the genomes of 22 mammals, which included animals that could and could not echolocate. A computer then analyzed the genomes and compared the mutations that contribute to echolocation. The results indicated that almost 200 genetic regions across the species had evolved together.
However, some colleagues question the results. “The authors are not really being cognizant of the limitations of their methods,” said David Pollock of the University of Colorado School of Medicine.

Video game shown to sharpen brains in older people
A report published in the journal Nature shows that playing the racing video game NeuroRacer improves the mental acuity of elderly participants. The study was led by Adam Gazzaley of the University of California, San Francisco.
The game has participants drive a car along a narrow and winding path. Throughout the game, distracting signs pop up on the screen. Older patients were initially much worse at the game than their younger counterparts. However, after playing for 12 hours over the course of a month they were able to beat 20-year-olds playing it for the first time. Laboratory tests revealed that the older participants also had an increased working memory and attention span.

Researchers give access to quantum computing
Users will soon be able to access quantum computing using their own computers. Those interested in running quantum algorithms on their own devices will be able to log in and access a two-qubit chip that is connected to the Internet. Quantum computers run on qubits, which differ from typical bits in that they can be zero and one simultaneously, rather than sequentially. Researchers theorize that qubits will allow for much faster computation. The qubit chip is being provided by the University of Bristol in the United Kingdom.
Quantum computers have previously only been available to a select few academics and laboratories such as NASA. Researchers from Bristol stressed the need for increased public access to quantum computing.

True to form, the Andy Warhol Museum currently has three unique and thought-provoking exhibits set to close on Sept. 15. S/HE IS HER/E is a retrospective on the work of artist Genesis Breyer P-Orridge; All Through the Night features photographs of Pittsburgh’s LGBT community taken by photographer Caldwell Linker; and The Patron Saint of White Guys That Went Tribal and Other Works features sculptures by artist Nick Bubash.
S/HE IS HER/E
This exhibit features the work of Genesis Breyer P-Orridge (born Neil Andrew Megson), a revolutionary artist who has been creating since the mid ’70s. The pieces in this exhibit definitely make a strong impact. 
Exploring themes such as open-ended conceptions of identity and rebelling against societal norms regarding sexuality, S/HE IS HER/E features a number of collages that are incredibly violent and sexual. “Untitled” is a passport photo showing two different versions of the same underlying face, while “Princess of Clubs” features images of sexual bondage. At times, S/HE IS HER/E can be overwhelming, but one thing is for certain: This exhibit will make you think more than any other exhibition currently at the Warhol.
All Through the Night
This simple exhibition of Linker’s work celebrates the human experience while showcasing Pittsburgh’s vibrant LGBTQ community. One walks in and sees an entire wall of photos depicting life in all its ups and downs. “Veruca, After Getting Beat Up” depicts a young person with a black eye in the shower, highlighting the struggle for acceptance still faced by the LGBTQ community.
Not all the photos are so somber, though. “Lee Relvas & Silky” portrays two young lovers sharing a tender moment in a bedroom. The piece brims with the happiness and excitement of teenage love.
The entire collection is incredibly varied. “Alaska & Veruca” shows a couple trying on wedding dresses, while in “Megan & Libbi” a woman in heavy makeup appears nude in a bathroom stall. The subjects in All Through the Night have a lust for life that is undeniable and infectious; after visiting, one gains renewed passion for his or her own life.
The Patron Saint of White Guys That Went Tribal and Other Works
The museum describes this exhibition as “a collection of sculptures made from bric-a-brac, toys, tattoo needles, and other inexplicable consumer culture cast-offs,” and that’s pretty spot on. Artist Nick Bubash has created a number of visually stimulating and diverse sculptures. They range from the incredibly ornate “Patron Saint of White Guys That Went Tribal” to the sparse “Man Is Praying, Prayingmanis,” a reproduction of the Venus Di Milo with a seashell hat.
Many of the pieces are very colorful and appear to contain several hundred components at the very least. “Portrait of a Serial Killer” features tiny cats and skulls with glowing eyes with references to voodoo dolls and other seemingly evil spirits. “Cacophony of Cacophonus” looks just as it sounds — a collection of figures made from junk found in the bottom of a toy box all standing together at attention. While Nick Bubash’s works don’t leave the same impact as P-Orridge’s or Linker’s, they are still something to marvel at.

Nants ingonyama bagithi Baba…sithi uhm ingonyama!
With the classic opening notes that have been so deeply ingrained in so many childhoods, the musical rendition of Disney’s The Lion King roared into the Benedum Center. The show, which will run until Sept. 29, is arguably one of the most celebrated musicals ever to grace the Broadway stage.
According to a Pittsburgh Cultural Trust press release, The Lion King has toured in 70 cities across the United States — but that’s one of the least stunning statistics about the show. 
The press release goes on to describe how The Lion King has been performed for nearly 68 million theater-goers across all the continents (except Antarctica) to gross over $5 billion — more than all the Star Wars films combined.
Clearly, this show is doing something right, and it’s easy to see why it’s successful after attending the Sept. 4 show of the current North American production tour. Funded by PNC’s Broadway Across America program, the Pittsburgh Cultural Trust, and the Pittsburgh Symphony, this stop on the tour is the encore performance following the show’s hugely successful 2004 and 2008 runs.
The show was, in a word, breathtaking. From the larger-than-life costumes, to the African drums that beat from either side of the stage, to the moments in which, yes, even as an almost-20-year-old, I was crying, the performance was the definition of a spectacle.
The tour also features Carnegie Mellon alumnus Michael Hollick (CFA ’95), who tours with the show as a standby for Scar — Simba’s cunning and dangerous uncle played by Patrick Brown — and for Pumbaa (Ben Lipitz), the lovable warthog who, with Timon (Nick Cordileone) the meerkat, adopts Simba after he runs away.
After attending the precollege program in 1990, Hollick was offered early admission to Carnegie Mellon upon auditioning for the School of Drama. One of four students admitted that summer, Hollick entered his senior year of high school knowing that he was Carnegie Mellon and Pittsburgh bound.
Hollick loved his time at Carnegie Mellon and credits most of his acting ability to the school’s professors and his peers. “Don Wadsworth is a remarkable teacher who teaches speech and diction, and the things that he taught I still use today. And the thing that’s wonderful about him is that he remains in contact with alums, including me,” Hollick said.
As a standby, Hollick must be ready to fill in for either role at the drop of a hat if the actors are sick, injured, on vacation, or just taking a personal day.
“It’s a lot of pressure, particularly for a production like this one. It’s so highly regarded, and it’s a well-respected performance … in every city we go to, we sell out,” Hollick said. “These are top-tier, amazing performers: You can’t drop the ball.”
Despite the pressure, Hollick always feels prepared to fill in, should the occasion arise: “Fortunately for me, I went to CMU. And that sounds cheesy, but it’s the truth. The fact that I’m able to go on at a moment’s notice.… I rely on a lot of things I learned there to keep my body, voice, and mind in shape to be ready to go on.”
It’s easy to see how the role of a standby for this show could be intimidating. Billed as “the world’s number-one musical,” The Lion King leaves nothing to be desired.
Perhaps the most entrancing part is the entire visual element of the show. Utilizing the entire theater as opposed to just the stage, animal puppets stampeded down the aisles and cloth birds flew jauntily overhead to the amusement of the many children sprinkled throughout the theater.
Much more engaging than the 1994 movie, the musical portrayed the animals in the story through extensive, intricately detailed puppets. The characters and their emotions were surprisingly easy to distinguish and identify based on the masks that the actors wore and the personalities that the performers were able to portray even through the simplest movements.
The masks, puppets, and other details had a distinct African influence that fit in the musical perfectly. African nuances were also woven throughout the music, which heavily featured two sets of bongo drums and tribal chants. Played perfectly by Brown Lindiwe Mkhize, the character of Rafiki — the mystical baboon who inspires Simba to see that his father lives on in his heart — used the African chanting most prominently.
Furthermore, multiple numbers in the show used a simple shadow puppet method of storytelling, while featuring chanting and dancers dressed in colorful, flowy costumes that were expressive and engaging. This was beautifully done and added another cultural element to the show that made it deeper and more meaningful.
“[Elements] were drawn from cultural theater, so in the show, you’ve got all of these different cultures represented. It’s got meat on its bones; it’s not just a frivolous musical,” Hollick said.
Hollick, who previously acted in the Las Vegas show, describes The Lion King as “a phenomenon.”
“It’s risen to the level of classic material,” he said. “You’ve got these intense emotions, quick and hilarious comedy, and then an amazing set and costumes to tie it all together. It’s an actor’s dream job, really.”
The only underwhelming elements in the show were the original songs added to the lineup. In general, the audience seemed less engaged during these unfamiliar songs. 
This was particularly noticeable during the beginning of the second act: In the first half of this act, no songs from the well-loved movie were featured. The songs “The Madness of King Scar,” “Shadowland,” and “Endless Night,” were all beautifully sung and choreographed, only adding to the beautiful representation of the destruction of Simba’s kingdom and the peace of the paradise in which he hides. But a restless energy seemed to fill the seats as this new material washed over the audience. After all, when one goes to see a musical based on one of the most adored children’s movies of all time, one expects to experience the familiar, not be introduced to new material.
The lull dispersed, however, the moment the opening notes to Elton John and Tim Rice’s “Can You Feel the Love Tonight” floated out into the jungle night. The song proved to be one of the highlights of the musical, mostly due to the perfect comedic timing of Timon and Pumbaa during the introduction and the synchronous energy that emanated from the ensemble. 
From there, the score became the familiar themes that the audience was used to, and the show ended on a poignant note as Simba (Jelani Remy) ascended Pride Rock.
Perhaps the most powerful moment in the entire production was during the reprise of “He Lives in You,” when Simba looks into the water and sees his father staring back at him. The number was beautifully performed, not only by the actors but by the symphonic accompaniment as well, and the representation of Mufasa (L. Steven Taylor) that appeared in the stars was positively magical. 
At first, ensemble members merely waved beautiful golden flags shaped like pieces of a face in time to the music. But then, as Simba realized that his father truly lived in him, a regal representation of Mufasa solidified in the night sky, shining down on Simba and the audience. In that moment, it wasn’t just a musical version of the movie I watched with my brother when we were kids.
The Lion King represents the beautiful simplicity of childhood — and that representation, through the musical, will continue to touch the childhoods of many. Hollick encourages Carnegie Mellon students to make the trek down to see the show, saying that it’s an event that will teach everyone a powerful lesson.
“_The Lion King_ will get their wheels turning intellectually and emotionally, relating to the characters. These are human issues and problems, and they’re rich, and CMU students should run down here to get a taste. It’ll enrich them; it will fuel their minds as they wrestle with the issues presented,” Hollick said.

Warning: This article contains spoilers for the first two seasons of American Horror Story.
October is just around the corner, and with it will come the premiere of the much-anticipated third season of FX’s American Horror Story.
American Horror Story is a miniseries, meaning that each season has a plot line independent of previous seasons. For this reason, little is known about what to expect in the third season, but here’s what we know.
FX recently announced via the official American Horror Story Facebook page that the new season, titled American Horror Story: Coven, will premiere on Wednesday, Oct. 9 at 10 p.m. EST. The 13-episode miniseries will revolve around a coven of witches who are mysteriously attacked 300 years after the Salem witch trials and who come into contact with voodoo priestesses; it will take place in both the 1830s and in the present, according to The Latin Times.
Series veteran Jessica Lange will be a part of the coven as Fiona, the Supreme Witch, says FX via Facebook. Fiona will teach young witches to protect themselves from the mysterious attacks at a witch academy. Lange has played standout characters in previous seasons: youth-obsessed neighbor Constance Langdon in the first season and discipline-crazy Sister Jude in the second season. Her insecurities in both seasons made her characters relatable, yet her actions also made her unlikable. In the first season, Lange’s character was ashamed of her daughter and her own wrinkled face, and in the second season, her character was overwhelmed with guilt about the death of a young girl.
FX also revealed on the American Horror Story Facebook page that actress Taissa Farmiga, who played Violet Harmon during the first season, will now play a young witch named Zoe, one of Fiona’s pupils. Sarah Paulson — Lana Winters in American Horror Story: Asylum — announced at the Television Critics Association fall previews in August that she will play Fiona’s daughter, Cordelia, according to TV Guide. Other returning cast members confirmed by FX include Lily Rabe, Frances Conroy, Evan Peters, Denis O’Hare, and Kathy Bates. New cast members include Gabourey Sidibe, Patti LuPone, Emma Roberts, Alexander Dreymon, and Angela Bassett.
Bassett will play real-life figure Marie Laveau, a Voodoo practitioner known throughout New Orleans in the 1800s, while Bates will play Delphine LaLaurie, a historic serial killer known for murdering slaves, according to TV Guide.
Absent from the cast of returning characters is Zachary Quinto, whose presence will be sorely missed. Quinto appeared in both previous seasons, but had an integral role in the second season as a psychiatrist with a dark side. Quinto delivered a truly disturbing performance in the second season, providing periods of unnerving calm in tense situations and releases of anger that were sure to make viewers tremble with horrified pleasure.
Beginning Aug. 29, FX released a series of teaser trailers for Coven. The first trailer, “Detention,” depicts women floating in the air pressed against various walls of a white room and hanging in the recesses of a blackened fireplace. Other teaser trailers depict witches burning on stakes, a mysterious person punctured by pins like a voodoo doll, and a woman buried alive but calmly moving about beneath the ground. The teasers are snappy and hint at what will hopefully be another visually stunning season. The first season provided intense images for the viewer to cling to, such as the black-suited “Rubber Man” and a white-walled bathroom with its white bathtub, while the second season was more atmospheric with its elaborate set pieces including the laboratory of Dr. Arthur Arden and the cells of the asylum’s patients.
Sarah Paulson claimed that the show will have a lighter tone than previous seasons, according to The Today Show. However, the teasers hint otherwise.
The first season successfully incorporated lighthearted elements into its disturbing plot, which revolved around a haunted house with murderers and baby-stealing ghosts. For example, mother Vivien Harmon, played by actress Connie Britton, joined a bus tour led by an eccentric guide that passed by her new home — dubbed the “Murder House” — in order to learn about its past. The characters were also provided escape from their horrors through various normal locales, such as homely kitchens and family-friendly neighborhood streets.
The series is most intriguing, however, when its characters are subjected to elements of classic horror. While the first season was scary, the second season raised the bar by placing its characters within an asylum, with no reprieve from the horrors that confronted them. Moments of humor were replaced by mad scientists, possessed nuns, and monstrous experimental creations.
The atmosphere of the second season was more effective at creating a truly terrifying experience for the viewer, and this relentlessness is something that the creators of the series would be wise to continue throughout season three.
The latest season of American Horror Story is shaping up to be a promising installment in the anthology-like miniseries from the minds of creators Ryan Murphy and Brad Falchuk, with what will hopefully be a strong set of scares from an all-star cast.

The start of September brings cold weather in the mornings and evenings while you’re walking to and from home, but warm weather during the day when you’re walking around campus. As a result, many people might currently be facing the dilemma of what to wear.
Since it’s too early for winter clothes and too chilly for summer wear, the natural solution is to mix elements of the two. Not only will this better prepare you for the ever-changing climate, you’ll also be able to wear your favorite sundress for longer than you expected. Below are a couple tips that will help you dress for current weather patterns and transition your summer clothes into the fall.
Summer Skirts and Dresses
If you think it’s time to put away your summer skirts and dresses, think again. With boots and socks or tights, they can make for a great fall outfit. Try either type of legwear in a pattern to add interest to the look, but make sure they don’t clash with the pattern of your skirt or dress. Shorter boots are better for this look — combat boots are especially fashion forward.
You can also make your skirt or dress weather appropriate by throwing on a light fall jacket, a cardigan, or a sweater. Common choices of jacket for this time of year include denim or, as it gets colder, leather. Military jackets have been in style for a while, and they make perfect fall jackets. When they’re paired with floral skirts and dresses, the result is a girly-meets-edgy look.
Maxi Dresses
Maxi dresses are a comfortable warm weather outfit, but they’re difficult to style. Can such a summer staple be worn in the fall?
Some “experts” say no; others say yes, so it’s all a matter of personal opinion. Fashion blogger Lauren Conrad indicated on her blog that “the style is ...perfect for transitioning your summer wardrobe into fall.” Conrad also advises that proportion is key and recommends cropped sweaters and jackets to complete the look.
Maxi dresses are on the bohemian side as far as trends go, and Free People Clothing Boutique is a useful source for inspiration on how to style them. In general, the maxi dresses featured on the website have been paired with short combat boots and follow LC’s advice with sweaters and jackets that are a shorter length.
Other Pieces
Summer tank tops can also make for versatile pieces. They provide an alternative to wearing sweaters and pullovers during colder weather, since you can layer them with cardigans. Add a light scarf to make the look more interesting and add a little extra warmth. Tank tops that are a longer length could be worn with leggings or jeggings and tall boots.
As for shoes, sandals and flip flops might be wearable for another week or two, but as it starts getting colder you should begin making the change to close-toed shoes. Oxfords and ballet flats are both useful intermediates between summer and winter shoes, though some people feel comfortable enough wearing their boots all year round.
When transitioning your wardrobe from summer to autumn, the key is to mix and match elements from both seasons while making sure that colors, patterns, and proportions are all in order.

Dear Ryan,
I thought taking five classes and joining a bunch of clubs after the Activities Fair was a good idea and that I’d totally be able to handle it, but I was so, so wrong. How do I handle this stress and still do everything I want to do? I thought college was supposed to be fun!
Sincerely,
Oh Boy; Vexed, Increasingly Oblivious Underclassman, Seriously Lost, Young Abductee Feels Really Eager, Shows Hopefulness, Maddeningly Aggressively Naive
Dear OBVIOUSLY A FRESHMAN,
There are two things you’re going to need to learn, and learn quickly, if you’re going to survive at Carnegie Mellon (and at college in general). You’ve got to learn to prioritize your activities and manage your time. 
If you’re taking a class that you really don’t like, don’t be afraid to reorganize your schedule (especially if that class is not required). Who knows — you may end up finding something you like better to put in its place. There’s a certain push at Carnegie Mellon toward taking 70 units each semester because hey, you can do it, right?
Maybe. But instead of taking that extra class to get that fifth minor, try joining some clubs. Lots of clubs! But then only stick with the one or two you really like and enjoy being a part of. You can like writing more than life itself, but if you have a nasty editor it can make the whole experience turn sour — something that this writer can happily admit he has never experienced! Just remember that you are here to get a degree, so if you find yourself struggling to pass your classes (and that is pass, not get all As), perhaps it’s time to revise your commitments.
Second, you must manage your time efficiently. I’m not going to sit here and preach good time management, since if you’ve gotten into Carnegie Mellon you probably have a pretty good idea of what works for you (and I would not recommend my time management style to anyone). 
That said, once you’ve planned a schedule, do your best to stick to it. Because once you get off that plan, it gets infinitely harder to get back on it.
But above all, you should monitor yourself and your well-being. If you’re not happy with something, or you find yourself lying awake at night questioning your decisions, make a change. These years are about you. That said, don’t forget about your friends. There really is no substitute for someone who takes you out of your own head for a while.
For the love of all that you hold dear, be happy.
Or maybe it just gets worse,
Ryan Black

The Bling Ring
Thursday, Sept. 12 - 7:30, 9:30
Sunday, Sept. 15 - 9:30
What happens when a group of spoiled and rebellious teens robs the homes of Hollywood’s elite? They appear in a movie about their debauchery directed by film princess Sofia Coppola. While it is based on shallow indulgence with pop culture, The Bling Ring proves to be entertaining. Emma Watson nails the Valley Girl persona as the ringleader of Hollywood’s most notorious gang. Coupled with a banging soundtrack and cameos from the faces of pop culture (ahem, Paris Hilton), The Bling Ring is deliciously enjoyable and provides a peek into the lives of Hollywood’s most dangerous wannabes.
Iron Man 3
Friday, Sept.13 - 7, 10
Sunday, Sept. 15 -  7
In the most recent installment of the most exciting series Marvel has produced, Robert Downey Jr. appears on screen as the explosively charismatic Tony Stark (a.k.a. Iron Man). A refreshing summer experience, the film explores whether or not Stark should retire the iron mask and live a peaceful life with his girlfriend, Pepper Potts (played by Gwyneth Paltrow). Iron Man 3 appropriately mixes humor with entertainment while infusing character with its energetic cast. Also featured are Jon Favreau, Guy Pearce, and Ben Kingsley.

Recently, a group of Carnegie Mellon professors petitioned the Pittsburgh City Council to change parking rates along Margaret Morrison Street, Tech Street, Frew Street, and Schenley Drive.
The rate for parking on Schenley Drive and Margaret Morrison Street is now 50 cents per hour, down from the previous $2 per hour. On Frew and Tech streets, the rate is now $2.25 per hour, a slight increase from the previous $2 per hour. The changes in parking rates will be accompanied by new signage that designates Margaret Morrison Street and Schenley Drive as “Economy Parking” and Tech Street and Frew Street as “Premium Parking.”
The project that led to the change in parking rates was headed by professor of economics Stephen Spear and associate professor of organizational behavior and theory Mark Fichman. According to Fichman, the change in parking rates is intended to facilitate the ideal parking usage for maximum revenue and convenience for students and professors alike.
“It just seemed like things were not working right, and we thought we know how it could be done better, and the city council was supportive of this idea,” Fichman said.
After parking rates on Margaret Morrison and other nearby streets increased last year, there was a surge in applications for on-campus parking, according to Fichman. This generated a long waitlist, while much of the street parking around campus remained largely empty.
Fichman considers the ideal utilization of the affected parking spaces to be 80 percent. 
“That’s our goal. If it goes above 80, we raise the price to bring it back to 80; if it goes below 80 we lower the price until it gets back up to 80.”
Fichman cited SFpark, a project used to improve parking in San Francisco, as an inspiration for the plan to change parking rates at Carnegie Mellon. 
Fichman also credits assistant professor of operations research and public policy at Heinz College Robert Hampshire for the idea.
According to SFpark’s website, the project “collect[s] and distribute[s] real-time information about where parking is available so drivers can quickly find open spaces. To help achieve the right level of parking availability, SFpark periodically adjusts meter and garage pricing up and down to match demand. Demand-responsive pricing encourages drivers to park in underused areas and garages.”
The rationalization behind the price adjustments at Carnegie Mellon was similar, Fichman said. “On a monthly basis we use data from the city. The city parking authority gives us a file with 20 to 30 thousand parking occasions — so where you parked and for how long — and we use that data to determine whether the capacity’s underutilized or overutilized and then send the parking authority a note saying we’d like to keep parking prices the way they are, or we’d like to change them in the following way. Then they make the changes, we see what happens, and so it continues.”
“If rates are too low, parking availability will be scarce, with low turnover throughout the business day. This creates a competition among commuters for parking spaces early in the day and presents real challenges throughout the day for individuals who need to park for an hour or two in order to attend a class, meeting or even make a delivery,” said Spear in a university press release.
“Rates that are too high will cause all drivers to avoid using these parking areas, which underutilizes a resource and ultimately lowers revenue.”
Becca Wolfinger, a sophomore electrical and computer engineering major who likes to park on or near campus, echoed Spear’s sentiments. “It’s beneficial to the school to have the parking spaces closer to campus lower in price; it makes it much easier for professors and students who live far from campus to get there and find somewhere to park.”
Fichman hopes that in the future Carnegie Mellon can adjust the parking rates for the parking garage and other parking lots on campus to reflect utilization of nearby street parking.
According to Fichman, the project seems to be working so far. 
“The parking authority is, I think, feeling pretty good about what we’ve done. I think from their point of view they’re getting more revenue, and we’re establishing the idea that parking pricing can be managed in a way that is beneficial for everyone,” she said.

Many CulinArt employees stepped out from behind the cash registers of Entropy+ and Carnegie Mellon’s campus eateries onto the sidewalk of Forbes Avenue to hand out flyers asking for increased wages last Wednesday.
Since the university’s contract with CulinArt Inc. expired on June 30, 32BJ Service Employees International Union (SEIU) — the union representing Carnegie Mellon’s service workers — has been fighting to increase the wages of it members at Carnegie Mellon.
CulinArt employees at Carnegie Mellon currently earn $10.30 per hour, which is $3.05 over the minimum wage in Pennsylvania. 
Workers have been complaining that although the price of the meal plan has increased by 37 percent in the past decade, the revenue has not been passed onto the employees.
According to 32BJ SEIU calculations, the average Carnegie Mellon CulinArt employee gets paid $21,424 per year. 
Director of 32BJ SEIU Hermaine Delaney reported that Carnegie Mellon CulinArt employees get paid less than food service workers at Duquesne University and the University of Pittsburgh.
The union believes that CulinArt employees are not being paid wages comparable to their skill sets, which include learning how to cook, avoid cross-contamination, be aware of food safety zones and food temperatures, and learn how to accommodate to various dietary needs.
32BJ SEIU field representative Peter Schmidt commented, “In some fast food places, service workers are making as much as $15 per hour, and most of the skills learned by CulinArt employees are not required there at all. Workers here are providing a very specific skill sets and should be compensated financially for that.”
Schmidt added, “One of the things we are trying to accomplish with our union membership is to make sure that everybody has one good job that they can rely on without having to work a second or third job. So that they’ll have time to go back to school if they want to, spend time with their families, live a normal life instead of constantly working.”
Due to the nature of working at a university, many CulinArt employees are laid off for holiday breaks.
Vashawn Davis, a CulinArt employee, said, “It definitely makes it harder, the [school] work schedule. Some people have to apply for unemployment every summer, and you have to keep re-filing for unemployment every two weeks. Some workers have to spend up the money they worked so hard to save during the year just to get by during the summers.”
Davis clocks in 40 hours a week through his 7 p.m. to 3:30 a.m. shifts. After his shift ends at 3:30 a.m., Davis, whose primary form of transportation is the bus, waits around in the UC until 5:30 a.m., when the buses start running, so that he can return home.
“Whenever I get off work in the mornings, I sit downstairs and watch T.V. until 5:30 when I can take the bus. I won’t get back to my home until 6 a.m., which is about the time everyone else is waking up,” Davis said.
“Bus passes are $100 per month, but if I had more money, I would try to get a car,” he added.
Right now, 32BJ SEIU is in talks with CulinArt to negotiate a new contract that could potentially offer its Carnegie Mellon employees better wages for the next four years. 
In the past, Carnegie Mellon and its previous food service company Parkhurst, were able to negotiate agreeable wages.
This year, through flyers, CulinArt employees and 32BJ SEIU hope to raise awareness among students about increasing their wages.
“Our goal is that we want people to understand that the folks who cook the meals and have these personal relationships with the students, they’re also real people who have real lives too,” Schmidt said.
“They’re trying to keep up with the rising costs of everything that students have to deal with — the gas, the rent, groceries, bills,” he added.
“Support from students and the university is an effective thing. For the workers, it is helpful being able to know that the people who they work for actually appreciate what they do,” Delaney said.
Senior economic and statistics major Bernard Yuan commented on the situation, lobbying for raising the wages of CulinArt employees. 
“The backbone of your business is your workers, and if you can’t satisfy your workers, you don’t have a strong backbone, and you’re not going to have a quality business,” he said. 
“If the workers are not happy, I feel like management should do something about it because if the workers are satisfied, they will ultimately be more efficient and deliver more quality service. So I’d be okay if they raised the wages,” Yuan continued.

The Tepper School of Business may be expanding in the not-so-distant future. On Sept. 23, an undergraduate student town hall meeting was held to discuss preliminary plans for a new, larger building on campus devoted to the school.
Consultants from Brightspot Strategy, led by founder Elliot Felix, delivered a presentation in Posner Hall’s Mellon Auditorium that aimed to get input and reactions from students about the company’s design requirements brief draft for the new building.
According to a written design brief draft from Brightspot, “In 2010, the Tepper School engaged the architecture firm Kohn Pedersen Fox (KPF) to plan for its expansion and relocation, including selecting a site on the Morewood lot across Forbes Avenue as well as determining an initial program of spaces and building massing concept.”
Three years later, this collaboration with Brightspot is continuing with an update to KPF’s work by creating a “future design that quantifies and relates the components of the building.” The document and Felix’s presentation suggest that there have been various complaints about the present facilities used by Tepper, including that Posner Hall does not create an ideal or convivial atmosphere for students; that there is little “flexibility to accommodate change;” and that there is not enough space designated to the school in terms of classrooms, communal areas, and larger spaces for events.
The design requirements brief draft states the new Tepper building will be located near Hamburg Hall, in the area next to Forbes currently used as Morewood Gardens parking lot. The future building is envisioned as being part of the “new generation” of Carnegie Mellon, with other buildings also expected to be built in the area.
Felix and Brightspot envision, with the advice of students and faculty, a new building that showcases a pride in Tepper and its entrepreneurial initiatives.
“It will be a game changer,” Felix said. Another focus brought up during the town hall meeting was that the new Tepper should be “inclusive of undergraduates.” A complaint brought up by students was the divide between the undergraduate and graduate business cultures.
Students also mentioned how currently, Tepper students are forced to have classes and business club meetings in other buildings such as Wean Hall, because Posner does not have enough rooms to accommodate its business population. “The hope is that we can accommodate many undergraduate business or economics classes,” Felix said.
There are currently preliminary plans on the layout of the building. Felix stated it might be as high as eight stories, with a lobby and a public area on the first floor. The floors would progressively get more private the higher they go, with the eighth floor containing faculty and Ph.D. work space. It’s undecided if a corridor (similar to those in Wean Hall) or suite structure (similar to those in Warner Hall) will be used for faculty office spaces. There are plans to incorporate various types of rooms, such as “breakout rooms” that have eight seats, Wi-Fi connection, and whiteboards on two walls; flat, flexible classrooms with 60 seats; and auditoriums with more modern seating arrangements.
The plan is to have two dining spaces, one possibly a coffee shop and the other a meal-oriented area. There were other ideas tossed around, including having a library space, lounges for students, research centers, a fitness area, a book store, study spaces, and even a space devoted to entrepreneurs; feedback is needed for many of the plans.
Hue Tran, a sophomore business administration major who attended the event, is enthusiastic about the new building. “Well, I am most excited about the fact that there will be many more rooms designed for students to practice and brainstorm for various events like case competition and class presentation,” Tran said. “This will significantly improve their performance since it is much easier for them to practice now. The extra space from the new building [would] also make students want to stay there longer, creating a stronger sense of Tepper community.”
Sophomore economics major Jobert Sauray, thinks a new building is a good idea. “I’m planning on switching to Tepper, so it would be good,” he said.
The planning for the new Tepper building is in a fluid state, and Brightspot wants input from students and faculty. “Over the next month or so, we will respond to the feedback, finalize the design brief, and use that as a basis for picking out an architect,” Felix said.

An unprecdented number of students from the Carnegie Mellon Rwanda (CMU-R) campus have been successfully landing big corporate internships recently.
According to a university press release, 23 of the Rwanda campus students spent last summer interning at companies such as IBM, Visa, Microsoft, and Marriott. The Carnegie Mellon Rwanda website also shows that students were offered internships at companies such as MTN Group, Citrix, Husk Power Systems, and MFS Africa.
CMU-R welcomed its first class of 40 students in 2012. The campus is offering a master of science degree in information technology, which according to the official website is “a multidisciplinary curriculum that strikes a fine balance between technology, business, and innovation, preparing the next generation of IT leaders in East Africa.”
They will also begin offering a master of science in electrical and computer engineering “that provides students with an opportunity for in-depth specialization in aspects of the field” next year.
Michel Bézy, associate director of CMU-R and distinguished service professor of engineering and public policy, helped organize the internship efforts.
“It wasn’t easy,” Bézy said. “There’s no culture of internships in Africa.”
Bézy went on to explain that “companies generally don’t pay anything or have a prepared program.... With our students, we want them to do a real job. Not only that we want them to be paid a serious salary,” Bézy said, adding that some made $2,000 in a summer, which is greater than Rwanda’s per-capita GDP.
Kevin Rudahinduka is a student in the master of science in information technology program at CMU-R and recently completed an internship with Visa. Rudahinduka said in a university press release, “Every CMU-R student should aspire to have an internship in a Fortune 500 company because it is the best, eye-opening, world-class experience I have ever received, and it has inspired my dreams of tomorrow.”
Bézy explained, “for many of them it was their first time out of Rwanda. For some, it was their first time on an airplane.”
The students were well received by their employers, with Bézy recalling that “some of the students received offers for a job from the company they worked for.”
Bruce Krogh, director of the CMU-R campus and professor of electrical and computer engineering added on to that idea. “The students are remarkable in spirit, ambition, and doing what it takes to be in the program,” Krogh said.
But running the Rwandan program is not easy.
“Every day has had challenges on all sorts of fronts,” Krogh said. “The government of Rwanda is supporting Rwandan students. Our $40,000 tuition is obviously astronomical to African students. So it’s difficult to get non-Rwandan students.”
The opening of a Carnegie Mellon campus in Rwanda generated some controversy when first announced. Rwandan President Paul Kagame visited Carnegie Mellon’s Pittsburgh campus as part of the announcement, and was met with protests by students who objected to his administration’s restrictions on the press.
Former University President Jared Cohon remarked at the time that “Carnegie Mellon sees as part of its mission not only becoming a global university, but having global impact. Africa is a part of the world that really is in desperate need of higher education resources.”
“Our agreement [with the Rwandan government] says that we’re entirely in control of hiring, admissions, and academics,” Krogh said. He added that Rwanda is “a total outlier in Africa” in terms of fighting corruption, saying, “Even the critics agree that Rwanda says what it’s going to do.”
“We’re very interested in letting students know they could come spend a semester in Kigali.... Kigali is just as safe as Pittsburgh,” Krogh said.
Bézy spoke of the internship program, saying that it “was very good for our visibility.... We are not here only to deliver master’s degrees. We want to be integrated into the economic development of this region.”

Last year, Carnegie Mellon alumna Sarah Peko-Spicer and director of undergraduate economics Carol Goldburg began to pilot a new chapter of Moneythink, an organization that serves underprivileged high school students.
Carnegie Mellon’s student-run Moneythink chapter seeks to prepare inner-city high school students for post-secondary education and financial management.
The chapter will be accepting fall membership applications until Wednesday; membership is open to both undergraduate and graduate students.
Sophomore statistics and economics major Anusha Kukreja, sophomore statistics and economics major Jillian Ward, and sophomore international relations and politics major Satvika Neti will lead the chapter in fall 2013.
Once accepted candidates are notified, mentors will travel to Pittsburgh schools once a week to provide in-class instruction. The chapter has already formed partnerships with Northside Urban Pathways Charter School and Westinghouse High School.
“In the CMU chapter, we have over 200 students that have expressed interest.... It’s amazing to see CMU becoming just as passionate about Moneythink as we are,” Ward said.
The establishment of a Moneythink chapter presents the Carnegie Mellon community with an opportunity to become part of a fast-growing force for change.
Moneythink’s mission has received nationwide recognition, and as a result, a number of nationally recognized organizations and corporations expressed interest in developing relationships with Moneythink members.
The national Moneythink team is working to establish employment pipelines for Moneythink mentors at corporations including J.P. Morgan and Chase.
“These employment pipelines are set up via partnerships with the corporations as well as through alumni currently working in these companies.” Kukreja said.
In addition, Moneythink recently established an alumni board, which has become a fast-growing internship resource for current mentors, and recently developed a partnership with Teach for America (TFA), according to Kukreja.
“The TFA partnership means that we are working closely with TFA teachers on a national level to get into more classrooms. It also means that our mentors are a selective pool of individuals being recruited by TFA. TFA values our mentors and is very interested in having them apply,” she said.
Other benefits for members include discounts at local businesses, as well as free or discounted packages for courses through organizations such as Kaplan and Wall Street Prep. Though a recent organization, Moneythink has already made lasting impacts. The organization was honored by President Obama in March as “a campus champion of change,” along with four other student organizations.
Kukreja, who attended the annual Moneythink Leadership Conference this summer, learned that through Moneythink courses, one student was able to use budgeting tactics to enable his family to keep the heat on through the winter, while another was able to save enough to buy his sister reading glasses so she could stop struggling to see the board and start keeping pace in her classes.
Though the organization has started by reaching out to high-need, low-income groups, it ultimately aims for a much larger scope.
“In talking to others, we’ve found that no matter the background, most high school students are not well informed about how to make and manage their money,” Kukreja said. “Moneythink’s mission is to make a financial literacy course mandatory for high school graduation by 2030.”
“We have a vision for Moneythink here at CMU, and the best part of joining now is getting to shape that vision, and graduate CMU leaving a legacy of the chapter and the impact it has in our city,” Ward said.
Moneythink members develop a curriculum and then travel to inner-city high schools once a week as “mentors” to teach the curriculum to students. 
The organization originated at the University of Chicago, and has chapters at 30 universities across 10 states. In the spring of 2012, Family Services of Pennsylvania (FSWP) approached the Tepper School of Business to propose a partnership in creating a Moneythink chapter.
Following the FSWP visit, Goldburg attended the 2012 Moneythink Leadership Conference and initiated collaboration between FSWP and Carnegie Mellon economics students. FWSP brought members into contact with Pittsburgh public schools, and Peko-Spicer began going into classrooms as a Moneythink mentor.
“I loved the idea of giving back to the community [and I was] committed to founding the CMU Moneythink chapter,” Peko-Spicer said.
“We were all immensely excited upon hearing about the program,” Kukreja said via email. “Within a week, we were the three co-presidents of the CMU chapter, and it’s been an incredible journey, especially this summer, to see us work as a team to develop the chapter.”

Jonathan Cagan appointed director of innovation and entrepreneurship
Recently, Jonathan Cagan — the George Tallman and Florence Barrett professor of engineering and co-director of the Master of Product Development program — was appointed the director of innovation and entrepreneurship for the College of Engineering.
“I am quite excited about leading new activities that bridge engineers to other disciplines on campus and to promote entrepreneurial and innovation activities and education,” Cagan said in a university press release. “Carnegie Mellon has a long history of innovation in research and strong success in commercialization of these successes. There is an opportunity within the College of Engineering to more explicitly teach students the skills necessary to succeed in product, technology, and service innovation, and the ability to develop new businesses around those innovations. I also look forward to exploring more synergies with our Silicon Valley campus, and leverage the Silicon Valley environment to promote new innovation potential.”
Cagan has written four books about product development and holds several patents addressing computational design and products. Cagan is also a fellow of the American Society of Mechanical Engineers and has received numerous awards, including seven Best Paper awards and at premier engineering design research conferences, the 2007 College of Engineering Outstanding Teaching Award, the 2002 Teare Teaching Award, and the 2000 Dowd Teaching Fellowship.
James H. Garrett Jr., dean of the College of Engineering and Thomas Lord professor of civil and environmental engineering, supports Cagan’s appointment and lauds his contributions to Carnegie Mellon’s growing entrepreneurial ecosystem.
“In this new post, Jon will seek to bring greater visibility to all aspects of innovation and entrepreneurship in the college,” Garrett said in a university press release.
CMU announces CS prize recipients
“We are pleased to recognize the outstanding research achievements of Doug James and Pat Hanrahan,” said Randal E. Bryant, dean of the School of Computer Science. “Although the two prize winners were selected independently, they both have made major contributions to the field of computer graphics. Their work has yielded many benefits, ranging from more realistic animation for Hollywood movies to improved modeling and visualization of real-world systems and new approaches to high-performance computing.”
James, an associate professor of computer science at Cornell and former assistant professor of computer science and robotics at Carnegie Mellon, will receive the Katayanagi Emerging Leadership Prize and a $5,000 honorarium, and will deliver a lecture at 4 p.m. this Thursday in the Gates Hillman Complex’s Rashid Auditorium.
James is an Academy Award recipient and shared the 2012 Technical Achievement Award for his role in developing Wavelet Turbulence software, which generates realistic swirling smoke and fiery explosive effects used in more than two dozen popular movies.
Hanrahan, the Canon USA professor of computer science and electrical engineering at Stanford University, will receive the Katayanagi Prize for Research Excellence and a $10,000 honorarium, and will give a lecture at 4 p.m. on Sept. 26 in Rashid Auditorium.
Hanrahan, in addition to Academy Awards and three university teaching awards, has received the Spirit of America Creativity Award, the SIGGRAPH Computer Graphics Achievement Award, the SIGGRAPH Stephen A. Coons Award, and the IEEE Visualization Career Award.
“Both the winners are very active and innovative leaders in the field of computer graphics, which has a big impact on our rapidly evolving modern society,” said Hiroyuki Kameda, dean of the Tokyo University of Technology School of Computer Science. “Their activities in both research and education are helping to make our daily lives more comfortable and more sustainable.”

Approval of Senate Budget
The Senate Finance Chair presented Senate’s budget for the 2013–14 academic year, which must be approved before Senate can distribute funds for special allocations or internal needs. After being delayed until this week’s meeting, Senate voted to pass the budget.
University Center Allocatons Board and Committee on Student Organizatons
After a presentation from Student Body Vice President of Organizations Corinne Rockoff, a fifth-year psychology and decision science double major, the Senate initiated a vote to approve this year’s Committee on Student Organizations (CoSo) and University Center Allocations Board (UCAB). 
Rockoff also called for applicatons for both organizatons, as both are below the maximum member counts and UCAB is below its minimum, with only two members. Applicatons for UCAB and CoSO can be found on The Bridge. 
Senate also voted to approve the members of both organizations.
Ex Officio Report
Kevin Monahan spoke at this week’s Senate meeting. Monahan, who took up the role of associate dean for career and professional development at the beginning of this academic year, outlined his plan for improving Career and Professional Development Services and asked for student feedback and input.
Senators had the chance to ask questions; some points addressed the lack of support from Career and Professional Development Services for certain majors within the College of Fine Arts and the lack of opportunity students of some areas of study face at Carnegie Mellon’s many job fairs.
Finance
There was one special allocation this week for Sigma Phi Epsilon’s Labor Day Barbecue. Due to time shortages, however, the finance allocation was postponed until next week.

President Barack Obama is seeking Congressional approval of a military attack on Syria after the Syrian government launched a sarin gas attack in late August, according to Reuters. The chemical attack killed over 1,400 people, many of them civilians. The United States’ long history of involving itself in foreign affairs necessitates a response to the attack. The U.S. should involve itself in the Syrian conflict, but not through military force.
The American population is not at all convinced that a military attack is the solution to the Syrian issue, with only 36 percent of Americans in favor of such action, according to a recent Gallup Poll. The editorial board of The Seattle Times argues that the situation is both uncontrollable and unpredictable, and ultimately not the responsibility of Americans, who are tired of being at war despite the recent atrocities that the Syrian government has committed.
However, the Syrian government’s actions are unconscionable, and must be addressed. The recent chemical attacks are only part of the violent situation that Syria has faced during its current civil war, which has been going on for nearly 30 months. Two million refugees have been displaced to surrounding nations while 4.2 million people have been displaced internally — over half of whom are children, according to Human Rights Watch. The displacement of Syrian citizens is not the only problem spilling into surrounding nations: The instability of the country could easily spread throughout the region, according to Freedom House, which cited Turkey recently engaging Syrian forces across the border and Israel bombing a convoy on the outskirts of Damascus.
But what can be done about this situation, given the American public’s reluctance to commit military resources? Thankfully, intervention can come in forms other than bombs, and many organizations have suggestions as to how to aid Syria without direct military action. Human Rights Watch advises that the G-20, a forum for international cooperation on important global issues, make a priority of aiding refugees and stopping the flow of arms into the region. One of Syria’s biggest weapons suppliers is Russia, which is a member of the G-20. The G-20 can pressure Russia and Syria’s surrounding nations to stop dealing through trade sanctions specifically targeting arms deals. Freedom House suggests that the U.S. provide financial support to Syrian civil rights groups, in order to aid the development of democratic institutions. With this support, Syria could move toward stabilizing itself.
Of course, many call for justice, as well as aid. Sixty-four countries have urged the United Nations Security Council to refer Syria to the International Criminal Court, according to the Human Rights Watch.
The refugees are of great concern at this time, as they are among the people most damaged by the Syrian conflict. Aiding them and the countries that support them without resorting to military attacks could ease some of the region’s tension.

After a summer of public debate and discussion, Pennsylvania legislators have again failed to privatize liquor stores.
Liquor sales in Pennsylvania are governed by the Pennsylvania Liquor Control Board (PLCB), a prohibition-era government agency that grants, renews, and validates all liquor licenses in the state. In a USA Today column, Matthew Brouillette, founder of the Commonwealth Foundation, recalled a remark by former Pennsylvania Governor Gifford Pinchot after the PLCB’s creation in 1933. Pinchot stated that the purpose of the PLCB is to “discourage the purchase of alcoholic beverages by making it as inconvenient and expensive as possible.”
Such tight control of Pennsylvania’s alcohol market is no longer necessary. Pennsylvania and Utah are the only two remaining states that maintain full state control over liquor sales and distribution. It is for this reason that alcohol is conspicuously missing from convenience stores, and there is an extremely rare and limited sale of beer and wine in grocery stores or other stores not certified by the PLCB.
This summer saw a resurgence of the movement to end state control of alcohol, with legislators debating the issue and submitting privatization proposals, according to the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette.
A recent editorial in the Post-Gazette, stated that 61 percent of Pennsylvanians support the measure to privatize liquor; however, by the conclusion of the summer legislative session, legislators did not pass any bill on the matter.
Liquor privatization would allow a greater number of liquor stores, expanded hours of alcohol sales, and cheaper prices — all due to greater competition. Increased competition would most likely expand the liquor sector, lead to more jobs, and produce greater tax revenue. Additionally, it would give people the option to buy beer, wine, and hard liquors in the same stores; right now, people do not have this option since beer distributors are licensed separately.
It is time for Pennsylvania to join the majority of America in allowing liquor stores to function in an unconstrained free market. It is only through this option that people will see greater selections, longer hours, and lower prices for alcohol. Pennsylvania politicians may not have passed legislation regarding privatization this summer, but Lehigh Valley local newspaper The Morning Call mentioned that this issue may be debated in the fall. Let’s hope our legislators make the right decision.

Former New York City police commissioner and Los Angeles police chief Bill Bratton aims to launch a social network for police officers called BlueLine at the International Association of Police Chiefs’s annual conference in October, according to the Associated Press. Bratton hopes the network will connect the nation’s police and allow them to more easily combat gangs and terrorists, as well as share their best practices.
While Bratton’s intentions for a social network are innovative for preventing crime in theory, it must be asked if the site is a necessary or useful addition to the arsenal of tools already at police disposal.
Although Bratton’s attempt to introduce a social platform for a respected group of professionals is admirable, there may be more effective ways to connect officers privately. It is understandable that with the popularity of social media sites, Bratton wanted to jump on the bandwagon, but these sites may not be appropriate in a professional context. Other professional social networks like LinkedIn are open to the public, and profiles are under scrutiny by other professionals. In a private setting, law enforcement officers may be more likely to share personal or sensitive information that could be released to the public by another individual using the site. Perhaps it would be more appropriate for officers who have sensitive jobs to use a traditional intranet website that does not emulate Facebook profiles.
Bratton hopes that BlueLine will solve the lack of communication between officers, but the small potential user base for the site may prevent increased talk. 
Through platforms like Twitter and Facebook, the world has seen that social networks can strengthen the relationships between various communities, from college students to businesses. These platforms are successful, though, because they cater to large audiences — unlike BlueLine, which is limited to one profession.
According to the Bureau of Justice Statistics’s 2008 Census of State and Local Law Enforcement Agencies, there are currently more than 1.1 million state and local law enforcement personnel in the United States. This number may seem large, but not compared to the 1.11 billion users worldwide that Facebook says it has. Now compare these numbers to what Facebook estimates to be 2.7 billion people worldwide who have Internet access. With little qualification needed to create an account on Facebook — or other sites like Twitter and Pinterest — there is a current potential user base of 2.7 billion people. Now, compare this to the seemingly insignificant 1.1 million potential law enforcement officers who could use BlueLine. The potential user base seems, and will probably be, relatively small — possibly too small to gain traction among officers.
Furthermore, 20for25.com — another social networking site for police officers — already launched in August, according to NBC News. The existence of more than one police networking site could further lower BlueLine’s user base by dispersing officers across the Internet.
Bratton’s vision to unite officers across the nation is highly desirable in an increasingly connected world, but a website identified as a social network may not have a large enough audience or the professional quality needed to achieve this vision.

The first time I stepped onto Carnegie Mellon’s campus last fall for my campus tour, I couldn’t help but notice countless festivities occurring beside the Fence, plaid as far as the eye could see, and a diverse array of students. Little did I know that just a year from my first visit, this campus would become a place that I would learn to know and love.
I thought that my social life would be the price I’d have to pay to go to a school that excelled academically. Stereotypically, Carnegie Mellon is known as a school with all of the work and none of the play. 
However, it is clear that this stereotype isn’t accurate after my first few weeks as a student.
The people I have befriended remind me of myself. The various events throughout Orientation week, such as Playfair and House Wars, have revealed just how social, friendly, and exciting the student body is at Carnegie Mellon. 
The campus is very different from where I was raised in rural Pennsylvania, and different in a fantastic way.
When I began classes, my love for Carnegie Mellon continued to grow. I was amazed by how much I learned each day. In a single week, I have learned what would have taken weeks or months in high school. 
My professors are the best in the game, and have already helped me to discover things I never realized. When I nerded out over an explanation of how integration-by-parts is essentially the opposite of the product rule, I realized that this is where I belong.
There is, however, one Carnegie Mellon stereotype that seems to hold true: This university is a place where each and every student’s heart is in the work, a mentality that is perhaps the best thing about Carnegie Mellon. The people I have met thus far, from first-years to seniors, are passionate about what they do. 
There are future CEOs, engineers, Hollywood actors or actresses, and scientists taking part in the hefty workload that has already brought so many before them to success. While the workload here is undeniably demanding, the students still take part in activities that they love and enjoy social lives, contrary to any stereotypes. A walk through the hundreds of tables at the Activities Fair is enough to prove that students are passionate and are active on and off campus.
Carnegie Mellon is a place where people have fun, whether they’re working or playing. There is never a dull moment. Whether they are spent exploring the city or determining the name of a mystery function in Principles of Imperative Computation, every day at Carnegie Mellon promises to be an exciting one.

After the publication of Stephenie Meyer’s Twilight series, young adult literature once again became a viable genre. New fantasy fiction became popular, one of these series being The Mortal Instruments, written by Cassandra Clare. It’s an elaborate series with incredible fantasy elements and fleshed-out characters that has gripped millions of readers.
Too bad the series is allegedly plagiarized. Clare started writing under the moniker Cassandra Clare in a Harry Potter fan base. She was popular in those circles because of her fan fiction, The Draco Trilogy, which paired Draco and Ginny from Harry Potter — a moody bad boy paired with a feisty redhead. Do the characters sound familiar to those from The Mortal Instruments?
Of course, this similarity isn’t inherently bad. Basing a story off of characters that have already been written about is not a crime. It traverses into gray areas, though, when an author’s characters are based off of interpretations of another author’s characters that have already been used in another franchise.
It gets worse. One day, Harry Potter fans awoke to find Clare’s story removed from the Internet. Slowly, the news got around: Huge chunks of her story had been  copied and pasted from other works that weren’t even Harry Potter. The characters were hers, but the witty, snappy writing that her readers fell in love with was not her own.
Fan fiction is a gray area for copyright anyway, because the source text is someone else’s work. Some authors have spoken out against fan fiction based on their works, but J.K. Rowling is not one of those authors. She has made it clear, though, that she doesn’t want money being made from Harry Potter fan fiction. And while what Clare did with The Draco Trilogy was wrong, she wasn’t making money off of the Harry Potter series or the other books she had allegedly plagiarized from — until she published The Mortal Instruments.
When her first book, City of Bones came out, Clare’s fan fiction readers were excited, until they actually started reading the book and experienced déjà vu. The protagonist Clary was Clare’s interpretation of Ginny in The Draco Trilogy; Jace was her Draco interpretation; Luke was her idea of Lupin and some of the writing seemed lifted off of the pages of her fan fiction, most of which she had allegedly plagiarized from other sources. Now she is making money from a series based off of fan fiction that was based not only off of Harry Potter but of other source material she liberally borrowed from.
With a movie now out, this woman keeps making money with recycled writing and characters that are not even hers, and she won’t listen to anyone against her. Authors who plagiarize do not deserve the profits and acclaim that Clare has received, and definitely not the promotion of her work in the form of a major motion picture.

When it comes to political policies, the public wants simple answers to blunt questions: Is politician A’s new strategy good? Are country B’s actions deplorable? Policy is easy to judge when the issue is black and white. In every debate, however, there are gray areas — these make writers’ jobs challenging when dealing with polarizing issues.
In the Aug. 30 edition of The Washington Post, Betsy Karasik explored gray areas in her op-ed, ““The unintended consequences of laws addressing sex between teachers and students.” As uncomfortable as her argument is, she raises a worthy discussion, and the article does not deserve the backlash it has received.
Karasik argues that the criminalization of consensual sex between teacher and student — resulting in law proceedings that are often drawn out and heavily scrutinized by the media — does more harm than good.
“The intensity of criminal proceedings — with all the pressure they put on participants, the stigma, the community and media scrutiny, and the concurrent shame and guilt they generate — do the opposite of healing and protecting the victim,” she said.
Her article was written in response to the 30-day sentencing of teacher Stacey Rambold, who pleaded guilty to raping a 14-year-old student, and it has enraged readers.
One reader’s comment states, “As far as I’m concerned, [Karasik] is as bad as a sexual predator. She is able and willing to rationalize sexual predation to the point that if she witnessed it, I doubt she would do anything to stop it.”
ThinkProgress, a progressive blog, criticized and simplified Karasik’s argument down to the idea that consensual sex between student and teacher should not be criminalized.
Critics miss many of Karasik’s points by overlooking the gray areas.
Karasik never explicitly states that student-teacher sex should not be criminalized. Although legal action may not be taken, she advocates for professional action. In fact, she says, “Teachers who engage in sex with students ... should be removed from their jobs and barred from teaching unless they prove that they have completed rehabilitation.”
While having sex with an underage student is a blatant abuse of teacher power and rightfully falls under the crime of statutory rape, the public attention and the stares from classmates can do more harm to the student than good. In the case Karasik references, the student committed suicide two years after the initial incident, as the case was pending. No one will ever know what led her to take her life, but the timing suggests that it was the events following, rather than the sex itself, that pushed her.
It is unfortunate that many readers drew such hasty conclusions, as if one must be either for or against the criminalization of statutory rape. The moral spectrum Karasik proposes, however, is much more delicate and complex than such binarism.
What Karasik offers is not a solution to a dividing issue, but a starting point for a new discussion. To interpret her argument as a definitive proclamation on what must be done would be to overlook the gray areas that Karasik tries to clarify.

The perennial children’s educational TV show Sesame Street has a special place in the hearts of many Americans. The show and its worldwide counterparts have taught children the fundamentals of learning and life lessons since 1969.
Recently, the program that is home to Big Bird, Elmo, and Cookie Monster expanded its curriculum to develop a stronger focus on the science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) fields. 
According to The New York Times, the program is putting more of an emphasis “on urging children to investigate, as opposed to simply explore.” Teaching this kind of analytical thinking — even at a very early age — is crucial, and Sesame Street should be applauded for expanding the show’s content to include STEM topics.
According to Forbes magazine, the science and engineering workforce is responsible for over 50 percent of the nation’s sustained economic expansion; however, only 5 percent of the overall workforce is employed in these fields. This disparity between expansion and job demand occurs at a time when the educational leaders of the U.S. are decrying an innovation deficit.
Only 17 percent of high school seniors are both interested in pursuing higher education in STEM and qualified or skilled enough to do so, according to The Washington Post. Thus, it’s imperative that children not only receive a STEM education at an early age, but also develop a strong interest in science and analytical thinking.
The success of Carnegie Mellon and other STEM-focused institutions is dependent on a steady source of inquisitive and intelligent students and faculty. STEM is shaping so much of the job market that leaving it out of a child’s education would be equivalent to preparing them for a world very different from ours today. 
Programs like Sesame Street deserve the recognition for being pioneers in developing such an accessible STEM curriculum for young children, and hopefully the country’s own public education system follows suit.

John Hannon, associate dean of student affairs, recently emailed students not in university housing information about living off campus. The information encompasses appropriate off-campus conduct, police presence, student-neighbor relations, landlords, over-occupancy, garbage, and parking. 
The email provides information often overlooked or forgotten and is a welcome resource for students; it is a positive sign from the university that it encourages a safe community for not only students living on campus, but for upperclassmen living off campus as well. However, the email could have been organized more effectively to interest students in the information.
While some information in the email may be obvious, such as the increased presence of police in nearby neighborhoods, other bits of information could easily be unknown. For example, the email describes that city zoning codes require that no more than three unrelated people live in a single-family residence. Landlords may overlook this rule, but the rule can later be enforced to evict students if police find that they have violated the zoning codes. The email gives students the opportunity to comply with the code and other city laws, such as parking laws, if they do not currently.
The university should be recognized for reaching out to its students to provide them with information that can ease the transition to living off campus. This compilation of city information is a useful resource that can be referenced as needed throughout the year.
Unfortunately, this helfpful information was buried in block after block of poorly formatted and hard-to-read text, and this information should be placed on a university resources page for off-campus students. A more inviting email or website may encourage students to read this generally useful information. The attempt by the university to reach out to students living off campus is appreciated, but that attempt to reach out must be more visible, rather than hidden in a lengthy email.
