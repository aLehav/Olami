“AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA takes breath AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA”
—Pascal Siakam’s nightmares, probably
Oh man, I forgot how much fun basketball could be.
With the regular season wrapping up, and the Mavs drama ending with Mark Cuban being ordered to spend some pocket lint, I had expected that the NBA might just simmer down, and lay low on the drama for a little bit.
Boy was I wrong. 
So, basically, after watching the NBA’s annual tank-off between the Bulls and the Mavs, the Bulls got the 10 seed, and had a shot to make the play-offs by winning two straight. Their first game? Taking down the Toronto Raptors, and proving that Canadians don’t have a place in this game.
Of course, you have to remember that this Chicago Bulls team is very bad. They rank in the bottom half of all offensive stats, and nearly lost a game to the Mavs. The Mavs, for anyone who’s forgotten, were trying to lose that game, and the Bulls still nearly dropped the game against them.
The .500 Raptors on the other hand, were also not great. They hovered around .500 for the season, sometimes hopping up by a bit, sometimes down, and they were also pretty solidly outside the top half of the league in stats, barring some made up nerd numbers from unemployed statistics majors. 
This play-in game was the battle of the stoppable object against the movable force, a game which, in all honesty, would’ve been largely forgotten if it weren’t for one little, very loud, distraction.
You see, DeMar DeRozan had secretly hired out a brand new 16th player for his Bulls team: His nine year-old daughter Diar had recently mastered the loud-as-hell-no-jutsu and managed to blast the ears off every Raptors player in the court.
“Oh, it’s just a child screaming, these guys are pros. It wouldn’t bother them,” you’re saying, “the crowd is screaming during the entire game!”
Well, apparently that Raptors team was spooked by loud noises, because they went a whopping 18 for 36 from the charity stripe. A team which shot 80 percent for most of the season could hit a miserable half of their shots.
They lost by four, by the way. 
Every time a Raptor walked up to take a free throw, Diar DeRozan would shriek loudly, off tempo, in a way to push the player off-kilter. Her focused bursts of sonic energy (as her agent would describe it) made her the best defender in all of basketball that day, and she’s currently in the hunt for a contract paid entirely in cool toys. Several teams have expressed interest, and Foul Play will obviously keep you up to date.
This marvelous defensive performance (beat it James Harden) made a few Raptors fans slightly annoyed, and they responded with death threats.
Yep. The fans were so fragile they sent death threats to a nine year old because a bunch of grown men paid millions of dollars, got flustered in the heat of the moment. They were so pissy that they wanted to kill a child.
The hate Diar received convinced DeMar not to bring her to the next day’s Bulls-Heat game, one which they lost by 11 points. One could only imagine the damage a prepped Diar could have done on a tired Miami team.
Presuming Diar can keep her performance up, I do think the NBA should probably implement a new Designated Screamer role, just so we can get some actual parity in this league. I shudder to think what big-kid budget teams like the Bulls could get away with if Diar recruits her friends.
“I will not let anything get in the way of me and my competitive enthusiasm to win.”
— Diar DeRozan

In the life of a Pittsburgh sports fan, this was a sad week, and if you’re reading Haley’s column, you’ll know why. For the past two weeks, the Penguins, Florida Panthers, and New York Islanders have been ensnared in a brutal struggle for the Eastern Conference’s second wild-card spot, vying for the prize of being used as batting practice for the Carolina Hurricanes (52-21-9) or Boston Bruins, the best team in the NHL, who have gone a frankly boggling 65-12-5 this season. For a brief, shining day — between when the horn sounded on the Islanders’ loss to the Capitals on Monday night, and when the puck dropped between the Pens and the pathetic Chicago Blackhawks, we controlled our own destiny. Then we got our asses handed to us. Then the Islanders won out. And now they and the Panthers are in the playoffs, and we — holders of the longest active postseason streak, 16 seasons, in pro sports — are not.
I am not a hockey fan anymore. I don’t know why I ever was a hockey fan, really. It’s a stupid sport where big bulky Canadian men shoot a tiny disc of rubber across an indoor lake and then get mad and slam each other into walls. It’s like if someone took soccer and made it impossible to run, impossible to see the ball, and replaced every man on the field with a balding kid who speaks French and pronounces sorry “souh-ree.”
I am not a hockey fan. I have never been a hockey fan. I did not care that we- I mean, they lost to the Blackhawks. Someone has been sending a rumor around that I cried when we- I mean, they lost that game. This is not true. I am a man. My eyes are red because I am tired from watching too much baseball. I’m unable to smile because of a medical condition. Leave me alone. Leave me alone! I’m fine!
Seriously, leave me alone. No, I don’t care about hockey. F$ck off.
I do care about baseball, though. After beating the White Sox 1-0 on Sunday, losing two out of three against the Astros, and then taking two of the first three in St. Louis, the Bucs have a 4-3 record on the week and a 9-6 record overall, and have put together their second consecutive solid week. Don’t get me wrong, it still feels like swimming against a current, and every bone in my body is absolutely certain that this is going to take a turn for the worse sometime in the very near future.
People react to fears like that in very different ways. Some answer fear with liquor, but it’s Carnival weekend, so that would be unthinkable. Some answer it with sleep, but it’s Carnival weekend, so that would be unthinkable. Traditionally, I’ve answered it by focusing on the Penguins, but after they broke my heart this week, that isn’t an option… sorry, my computer got stolen, this is Kyle again and I would like to say that I have never cared about igloo lacrosse.
So here we sit. The Pirates are third in the National League (a sentence which feels beyond good to say), and currently hold the top wild-card spot with the fifth-best record in baseball. The way the Bucs won — and, indeed, lost — was much the same this week as last week, so I’m not going to bore you by going over it again. (If you didn’t read High Seas last week, one, what the hell is wrong with you? and two, the TL;DR is that the pitching has been okay, and the bats have come to life in the Steel City.)
Instead, I’d like to talk about something that would have been unthinkable a month ago, but in this era of Piratemania, we can’t ignore. It’s the question captivating our city, our region, our country, our world. Are the Buccos in contention for their first playoff spot since 2015? 
Here, I have two answers.  My head says no. My heart says yes.
First, my head. As a team, the Pittsburgh Pirates suck. They suck on paper, with a roster only barely improved from the roster they fielded in 2022, going 62-100 and placing second-to-last in Major League Baseball. They’re outperforming, but since Bryan Reynolds leading baseball in home runs and Connor Joe hitting .341 aren’t sustainable (and they aren’t), eventually this team will regress to the mean. Sure, they’ll be three or four games ahead of where they should be because of this good start, but at its core, this is a team composed of triple-A players who made a wrong turn on their way to Indianapolis, guys that wouldn’t get so much as a cup of coffee in the majors anywhere else. Guys like Cal Mitchell, Jason Delay, Mitch Keller (although he’s an odd case; more on him in a future issue), and older-than-God Andrew McCutchen are not going to lead a team to the playoffs. The season is a marathon, not a sprint, and the Bucs just might be out of energy.
Now, my heart.
Pittsburgh is a city of champions. We’re a small city, and punch further above our weight in professional sports than any other city in America. (We can make a possible exception for Green Bay, Wisconsin, but I would rebut the “city” part.) For the past 20 years, our fans have fallen into the same familiar pattern. The Steelers and Penguins alternate between greatness and merely being good (and one is always great, while the other is merely good; the designations just flip-flop), while the Pirates suck, languishing in obscurity. But there’s a realignment going on. After a long run of deep playoff runs and Super Bowl wins in 2006 and 2009, the Steelers went 9-8 last year and missed the playoffs. And hockey has been the same; after 16-straight playoff appearances and Stanley Cups in 2016 and 2017… not that it matters. Like, it’s sad, because it’s Pittsburgh and we love Pittsburgh, but it’s a stupid trophy anyway, in a stupid game, and it doesn’t matter that we- I mean, they missed the playoffs. It doesn’t. Will you please shut up?
Note to Editor: the splotch marks on this manuscript are not tears.
But my heart says this might be it. Pittsburgh hasn’t had a championship since 2017, and for the Pirates, October hasn’t meant baseball since 2015. Are these Bucs going to win the World Series? No, of course not. That honor will probably fall to the Braves, or the Dodgers, or the Yankees, or the Rays. But could they make the playoffs? Honestly, yes, yes they could. This is a young team with a good farm system, and they’re excited, the park is excited, the city is excited.
Besides, I have personal reasons for wanting the Buccos to make the playoffs, too. If they don’t, the season ends at the end of September and all Pittsburgh will have left are football and hockey. The Steelers suck, and the Penguins, well, the Penguins-
“Are you okay?”
No, I mean yes, I’m not crying! Do I look like I care?? I don’t care that they missed the playoffs! It’s a stupid sport anyway! Leave me alone!

Imagine if you had a 16-year streak of going to the playoffs, with three Stanley Cups in that time. Now imagine that you lost that streak by losing to the second-worst team in the NHL. Haha, how silly. Wouldn’t that be embarrassing?
Well folks, the Pens have done it. After a massive up and down shitshow of a year, the race for the wildcard slot officially ended on Wednesday, after the Islanders beat the Canadians 4-2, making it mathematically impossible for the Penguins to make it to the playoffs. The Pens had no control over this, and really just had to watch the scoreboard and pray. However, something they did have control over was their game the previous night against the Blackhawks. You see, as of Tuesday, the Blackhawks were the second worst team in the NHL, followed only by the Ducks (at this point, they’re only the third worst). In theory, we should’ve skated circles around these guys. Instead, they just utterly embarrassed us. After a scoreless first, the Blackhawks took the first point in the second period. This does not bode well for Pittsburgh– they’re 24-10-7 when they score first, but a measly 16-21-4 when their opponent scores first. Not a great start! Things were looking up for a moment when Geno tied the game 1-1 on the Pens power play in the beginning of the third, but it would all be downhill from there. Five minutes later, the Blackhawks would score twice within 30 seconds, including a frustrating ricochet off of Jarry and into the net. In the last minute and a half, Chicago would score an empty netter. One of my clearest memories from this game is the Danton Heinen goal that immediately followed– right after he lit the torch, the camera cut to Heinen and he did not look excited in the slightest. Just so horrifically unamused with how everything was playing out. At that point, the score was 4-2, and I really think that they just knew they weren’t making it to the playoffs at that point. The deal was really sealed 15 seconds later with another Chicago empty netter, and the game would finish 5-2, with the Pens receiving zero points towards the wildcard race. 
After getting definitively kicked out of the playoffs on Wednesday, I honestly did not even watch the game on Thursday. I didn’t even listen. They lost 3-2 to the Bluejackets (current second worst team in the league). What is wrong with this team? How do you lose your chance at the playoffs by losing to two absolute garbage dogwater teams? Whatever. Moving on. Following this absolute horror of a season end, ownership has essentially fired the entire front office. Notable removals include general manager Ron Hextall, much to many fans’ delight, as well as Assistant General Manager Chris Pryor and President of Hockey Operations Brian Burke. I honestly don’t care who they hire, as long as they do something different from whatever the hell happened this year. 
On a slightly more positive note, a lot of people think this is the wakeup call that Pittsburgh needed to really get back into the game and start moving and shaking. Although I’m quite sad that there will be no more Pens to watch this season, I’m ready for a (hopefully) refreshed and improved team come October. Until then, I suppose I’ll have to return to my Florida roots and hope for a Lightning sweep. Let’s go Bolts, I guess.

Amid the signature azaleas in full bloom, Jon Rahm swung his way to Masters victory this month at Augusta National Golf Club. Rahm outlasted numerous past victors and some of the best golfers active today. He gave a stellar performance on a challenging course made trickier by downpours and headwinds.
The famed Georgia course holds the first major golf championship of the year each spring. After four rounds of 18 holes, Rahm came out on top with a final score of 12 shots under par. He hails from northern Spain, and is currently ranked as the number one golfer in the world by the Official World Golf Ranking organization.
This year’s tournament prize fund was the largest in its history, doling out a whopping $18 million to the top players. Rahm earned a record-high purse of $3.24 million. To solidify the victory, Rahm outlasted his main challenger for the weekend, Brooks Koepka, who tied for second alongside the stalwart Phil Mickelson. Mickelson surged ahead late in the fourth round after starting out the weekend in a rough spot.
Koepka looked strong all weekend long, finishing the first three rounds in the number one spot. He didn’t slip until Sunday, when he dropped behind by four strokes, finishing +3 on the day to place second overall. (All told, he still earned a handsome share of the purse at $1.58 million, as did Mickelson).
The Norwegian Viktor Hovland jumped out in front during the first round, flamboyantly dressed in a shirt compared to an exploded watermelon. His strong start waned through the weekend, however, losing ground after a seven-under tied lead.
The amateur Sam Bennett looked good this year, far and away the best non-pro to play. At one point he was third among a field of 87. The Masters is an amateaur-friendly championship, and is the proving ground for many up and coming players. Bennett’s golf game is one to watch in the future.
And who can forget Tiger Woods, titan of golf in the 21st century. Woods snuck in with +3 to “make the cut” after a number of players faltered in the second round. The course grew more difficult as the weekend progressed, bogged down with rain and whipped with high winds. This Masters was twice delayed by weather, but the golfers got their fair share of rainy play, sloshing through a very soggy Saturday on the green.
Woods is now tied for most consecutive cuts ever made at the Masters — 23 in a row — after winning in 1997 with a record-setting 12 stroke lead. This year, he withdrew from play after making the cut. Was Woods trying to keep his legacy intact while maintaining his pride, by bowing out after two rounds while others slogged on? Quite possibly — but his significance in the game, although lesser in recent years, can’t be denied.
This year’s Masters was exciting to watch, kickstarting an entertaining season of golf. The next Major is the PGA championship in May, which Jon Rahm is currently favored to win. This could be the year for the Spaniard known affectionately as “Rahmbo.”

What is makeup made up of? Besides checking for the little animal-cruelty-free bunny rabbit on the packaging, most remain uninformed about the chemicals they put on their faces. It’s not that nobody cares — makeup users don’t want to get sick because of the products they use. But the makeup industry purposefully obfuscates the dangers involved with routine use of synthetic chemicals found in cosmetics, especially inexpensive drugstore products that are marketed towards lower-income buyers. 
I do not think I can explain in one article what can make makeup dangerous and how to avoid it; the reality is that companies use a myriad of different ingredients. Now that there is more awareness about potential carcinogens and other risk factors, products labeled “clean” or “vegan” create more confusion than clarity for buyers. 
To hopefully shed some light on the unadulterated chemistry and biology behind makeup, I’m going to conduct a case study on one of my favorite makeup products: e.l.f. liquid glitter eyeshadow (specifically in the color Disco Queen if anyone’s looking to get me a good birthday gift). I chose this product because it’s inexpensive, widely available at drugstores, and also claims to be cruelty-free, vegan, and free from harmful ingredients like phthalates, parabens, nonylphenol ethoxylates, triclosan, and hydroquinone. What does that mean?
Most of these ingredients have been identified as hormone dupes, meaning they look a lot like some hormones that already exist in the body. The problem with this is that hormones exist to signal important things to your endocrine system, so when you introduce a lookalike, your body may respond inappropriately. Phthalates, parabens, and triclosan can have this effect, some even causing the early onset of puberty in children or causing breast cancer. Nonylphenol is similar, but has been specially identified as an environmental hazard because of its ability to remain in the urine of human consumers. Many hormonal or carcinogenic concerns about particular products extend past humans because they can be unintentionally distributed to the environment through waste or water. Also, many of these ingredients, like hydroquinone, are banned in the U.S., so while I appreciate e.l.f.’s commitment to their consumer health, they’re not doing much more than the law requires.
So what ingredients are in this eyeshadow? 
Some generally non-concerning things: Water, Calcium Aluminum Borosilicate, Glycerin, Calcium Titanium Borosilicate, Hydroxyethyl Acrylate/Sodium Acryloyldimethyl Taurate Copolymer, Squalane, Acrylates Copolymer, Tin Oxide, Citric Acid, 1,2-Hexanediol, Caprylyl Glycol, Sorbitan Isostearate. I promise I researched each of these individually and they’re all safe. Many of them are synthetic, however, which means that you’re exposing your skin to something it was never intended to be exposed to. This is one main issue with makeup products in general, but all in all it’s not horribly pressing.
Polyethylene Terephthalate: A type of plastic that can seep the toxic metal antimony into water.
Polybutylene Terephthalate: Another plastic related to the one above. My main concern with these two is that they’re in the form of tiny pieces of glitter in this product, which inevitably end up in the water I use to wash my face, and then in the environment.
Polysorbate 60: An emulsifier that keeps fats from separating in a mixture. If ingested or if it enters into the bloodstream, it may compromise the membranes of gastrointestinal cells and alter gastrointestinal function.
Phenoxyethanol: This has been classified in some countries as a toxin because of some evidence of damage to the nervous system, irritation to the skin, and environmental hazard. Manufacturers in the U.S. can still use it, though.
Aluminum: A controversial ingredient. A main component of many antiperspirants, some research indicates that it can cause breast cancer when it accumulates in breast tissue. Some scientists deny that this is a hazard in most products, and it certainly depends on the form that the aluminum takes and the quantity that you use. That said, it’s certainly something to watch out for.
Titanium Dioxide (Ci 77891) : These dyes are coal-tar based and can be carcinogenic if ingested. Once again, the hazards of this ingredient depend on its usage.
Obviously, not every cosmetic product is deadly, and there are certainly a wide range of rules and regulations in place to keep us all safe. However, I want to emphasize that checking out the manufacturer and the ingredients in the products you use can only lead to you being a more informed, and thus safer, consumer.

I'm kind of short. I can't reach the top cabinet in my apartment, and sometimes struggle to even close tall windows. To make me feel better about myself, I've brainstormed some reasons why being tall is bad. From scientific evidence, of course.
For starters, some background: Researchers used to believe that height was pretty strongly correlated with longer life spans. This is because taller people usually had better nutrition and living conditions due to socio-economic status and other reasons, extending their lifespan. But when we look at populations with roughly equal nutrition levels all over the world, we tend to see that shorter humans have on average longer life spans. 
Here are my reasons why I think tall people die earlier (ranked from plausible to very dubious):
1. Takes a lot of energy to maintain
If you're tall, you're going to have more cells (on average) than someone who is short, because you have more bone and skin and tissue. It takes energy and resources to create all these cells, which can exhaust your body faster. Or at least goes one hypothesis for why short people live longer. 
Side note: This also means that short people are more eco-friendly, because they just consume less resources, like food and clothes, from the planet.
2. Higher likelihood of cancer and other diseases
Because tall people have more cells, there's just a higher chance for any one of those cells to become cancerous. One study shows that taller postmenopausal women are at higher risk for various types of cancer such as thyroid, kidney, breast, melanoma, and all of them combined. Other studies corroborate that the risks of many different cancers are increased for taller people in general.
Taller people also seem to suffer more from aortic aneurysms, when there is a bulge in the aorta that may burst and leak blood, and form blood clots. A hypothesis is that tall people simply have longer arteries and veins, which increases the likelihood of such problems occurring. They also tend to be at risk for atrial fibrillation, which are irregular heart palpitations.
Side note: While shorter people tend to suffer less from cancer, they do seem to suffer more from heart diseases.
3. Exposed to more UV radiation
As you get higher in altitude, you also get exposed to more sunlight. So tall people probably get exposed to more UV radiation, which of course means higher chance of skin cancer and extra crispy skin. (Side note: But this also comes with increased exposure to Vitamin D, an important vitamin. Vitamin D might possibly protect against cancer as well, though studies and trials show mixed evidence.)
4. Get less oxygen
As you get higher into the atmosphere, the density of oxygen in the air decreases. (If you're wondering why, it's because the lower altitude you go, the more air there is above you, which weighs down the air that is at your altitude. This compresses the air, meaning more oxygen for a given volume. Vice versa for higher altitudes.) Tall people are higher in the atmosphere than short people, so naturally they would breathe less oxygen, right? And the highest part is their brain too. Which probably means that they don't get as much oxygen to their brain. Ha, idiots. (Don't tell me that's not how it works, I don't care.)
So in summary, while I'm short, at least I'll have a long life. Take that, tall people.
In all seriousness, though, while shorter people on average do seem to have slightly longer lifespans, the evidence is a bit mixed and varies by circumstances. There's benefits to be found at all heights, and so we should embrace diversity and bodies of all shapes and sizes!

A team of researchers at Stanford and Google worked to populate a town with what they call “generative agents.” These are computational software “agents” that simulate believable human behavior. In short, these researchers aimed to populate a town with artificial intelligences that closely mimicked human behavior. 
The authors of this paper describe a Sims-like simulation where users can interact with a small town of twenty-five characters called “Smallville.” The goal of this project was to have these agents develop realistic behavior both on an individual and emergent level. As an example of this behavior, the paper talks about a Valentine’s Day party. The user states that one of the agents wants to throw a Valentine’s Day party; it follows that the agent will spread invitations to the party and the other agents will ask each other out on dates to the party — like humans would. 
Each agent was given a one-paragraph description about their identity, including their occupation, relationship with other agents, and seed memories. For instance, “John Lin is a pharmacy shopkeeper at the Willow Market and Pharmacy who loves to help people. He is always looking for ways to make the process of getting medication easier for his customers; John Lin is living with his wife, Mei Lin, who is a college professor, and son, Eddy Lin, who is a student studying music theory; John Lin loves his family very much; John Lin has known the old couple next-door, Sam Moore and Jennifer Moore, for a few years; John Lin thinks Sam Moore is a kind and nice man; John Lin knows his neighbor, Yuriko Yamamoto well; John Lin knows of his neighbors, Tamara Taylor and Carmen Ortiz, but has not met them before; John Lin and Tom Moreno are colleagues at The Willows Market and Pharmacy; John Lin and Tom Moreno are friends and like to discuss local politics together; John Lin knows the Moreno family somewhat well — the husband Tom Moreno and the wife Jane Moreno.”
Realistically, this was 25 instances of ChatGPT interacting with each other. While the paper includes graphics, these are just models of the underlying work that was being done. The different areas of the “map” are associated with some kind of word, which the agents will “remember” and associate with that “location.” As time passes in Smallville, each agent will output a statement, which will be translated into some language that affects the “world.” 
Over time, these agents will also create and build relationships. For instance, an interaction between two agents named Sam and Latoya will change depending on if they are friends or not. When they first meet, Latoya might say, “I’m here to take some photos for a project I’m working on.” In a later interaction, Sam might say, “Hi, Latoya. How is your project going?” to which Latoya replies, “Hi, Sam. It’s going well!”
But how exactly can one evaluate how “human” a model is? The researchers took advantage of the agents being able to respond to user inquiries. The researchers “interviewed” the agents in five categories: self-knowledge, memory, plans, reactions, and reflections. Human participants observed a “day” in these agents’ lives and then ranked the believability of the agents’ responses to the questions from most to least believable. Overall, the study found that while the agents were able to answer questions consistent with their knowledge, they sometimes failed to remember certain details. 
A proof of emergent behavior comes from the spread of information from the agents. In one instance, the number of agents who knew about an agent’s mayoral candidacy increased from one to eight; in another instance, the number of agents who knew about an agent’s party increased from one to twelve, all without user intervention. 
In some cases, agents made mistakes relating to what is considered “proper behavior.” In one instance, agents chose to enter an occupied one-person bathroom in the college dorm because college dorm bathrooms are usually meant for more than one person. In other cases, some agents entered stores after they had closed, as they did not understand that the store was closed (which some would consider normal human behavior). 
Smallville is one of the first generative agent worlds, and at the end of the paper, the authors suggest that future researchers look into expanding the modules that these researchers used.

Boy, what a week, huh? Over here at pillbox, we had a great Carnival! And except for that one guy that fell off the Whirlwind ride, it sounds like everyone else did too. Even the lucky denizens of this week's crime and incident report must've had a blast. But it's now time to get back to work, finish those projects, figure out your schedules, and readjust to all the mundane drudgery of daily life that we hold so dear at Carnegie Mellon University :(
So why don't you take a break from your Monday hell and read this week's lovely selection of articles and photos (mostly photos). Your 112 final project can wait.

Last week I left you with unanswered questions about The Fence. If you haven't read it yet, take yourself up to UC 314 and politely ask us for a copy of last week's edition (or click the link here). In short, last week I shared my revelation that nearly every online resource about The Fence is wrong, contradictory, or bad. Nobody can agree on when or why it was built, when or why it was first painted, and the legends are so rife with falsehoods that I'm hesitant to trust anything.
Except, one source was honest. Almost everything I presented last week were things I read during the fall of my freshman year, between September and December 2021. Then in February of 2022, the Carnegie Mellon Instagram posted a video where Julia Corrin, the university archivist, explains how the common legend is most likely false. My research had lain dormant for a while, but seeing a figure of authority affirm my suspicions put me back on the trail. Before I share with you the complete timeline of The Fence's construction, I want to thank Corrin and the rest of the University Archives team for their help as they were an extremely valuable resource for this project. I also want to thank Kelby Kramer, another student who did very similar research several years ago who shared with me his findings. Here's what we know for certain about The Fence:
The absolute earliest reference to a fence I can find comes on page 154 of the 1913 Thistle, in a section titled "Class History, '13." While reminiscing about their days at Tech, the author proclaims, "Let us build for ourselves a Tech Fence and gather around it with our hearts still full of love for C.I.T and the class of 1913." Carnegie Tech wouldn't be the first campus home to a special fence — a similarly sacred spot existed at Yale back in the day. 
However, plans did not come together until well after WWI. On Feb. 1, 1922, The Tartan reports on the "Committee on Senior Privileges," which determined that "no plan for distinctive dress for the Seniors at this school was feasible due to its location in such a large city as Pissburgh" (that isn't a typo). In place of dress, they suggest the idea of "senior privileges," including the construction of a senior fence.
From here on, we get occasional reports of the progress of this fence. On Mar. 29, 1922, plans were approved by the student council with the tentative location between Doherty and Hamerschlag hall. But on May 31, construction had yet to move forward due to an inability to procure lumber. Progress on The Fence appeared to have been so sporadic that on Oct. 18, 1922, The Tartan published an article titled "Enthusiastic Crowds View Senior Fence as Structure is Unveiled." Lest you mistake it for genuine reporting, it ends by saying: "This write up a joke? Certainly not. We are merely twenty years ahead of time."
Plans resumed in January 1923 with renewed vigor thanks to a new committee of seniors from the class of 1923 led by Hubert Owen Sprinkle, the football player and WWI veteran you may have read about in this lovely article.
And on May 16, 1923, the issue published prior to Campus week (the predecessor to modern Carnival), we are told, "The construction of the Senior Fence is at last underway … so that it may be opened for use next monday." The following week, this is confirmed to have occurred with an article titled "Senior Fence Finally Appears on Campus." The Monday in between those two publications would be May 21, 1923, giving us an official birthday for The Fence. Right?
So close. In the May 30 issue of The Tartan, they "apologize for the story of the Senior Fence published in last week's issue, which was to be held over for today." So was it constructed the Monday before campus week? Or the following week? The official birthday of The Fence eluded me, and I was certain it would remain ambiguous forever. Unless I could get definitive proof that The Fence was up during campus week of 1923, I could never confirm May 21. "May 1923" would be the closest we could get. That is, until our school's Collections Archivist, Emily Davis, handed me a piece of paper which finally contained answers. 
The paper was a scanned article from the Spring 1988 edition of the alumni magazine, "Carnegie Mellon Magazine," written by M.C. Johnsen, the special collections librarian. The article, simply titled "The Fence," tells much the same story as I have, but also includes an interview with Hugh Sprinkle himself. He is quoted as saying, "Before Campus Week in May 1923 had arrived the fence was complete." 
The proof I sought was before me, and I now had a complete timeline with exact dates. Now that we know for certain it was a student-built project, I decided to update the Wikipedia page on Carnegie Mellon traditions (which erroneously claimed that the administration built The Fence). 
But can I be positive that the legend is completely false? Suppose you remain unconvinced. Perhaps there truly was a bridge over the Cut, and perhaps The Fence was indeed supposed to be a meeting point for the men and women of CIT and Maggie Mo. To be fair, it's not completely incompatible with the timeline I've put together. Even the university archives team couldn't tell me for certain that there was never a bridge over the Cut. To put the issue to bed for good, I want to point to the strongest pieces of evidence I have found.
The first is a sort of proof-by-omission. I spent a large amount of time this past fall break scouring digitized scans of our yearbook, The Thistle, from the very earliest years of the Carnegie Technical Schools, searching for any reference to this bridge (it was during this time I stumbled across the subject of my first "From the Archives" piece — you see how it all ties together?) The early Thistles are littered with inside jokes — one thing they liked to do was to list "statistics" for every member of the class (not unlike yearbook superlatives.) On page 276 of the 1908 Thistle, the "Statistics" include a category for where each person frequents — such hilarious entries include Gotty Gottfried who frequents "Any old Place" and Lew Frank who frequents "The Rittenhouse." Price Kenton, however, a man known to frequent "Girls' Homes on Off Nights," does not seem to frequent a bridge of any sort. In fact, among the hundreds of pages of inside jokes, superlatives, and weird off-hand references to places that no longer exist, I failed to find a single mention of what was supposedly the only place on campus to meet women. 
The second, more definitive pieces of evidence are two photographs I found of Margaret Morrison Hall as seen from the second floor of Doherty Hall. The first photo is from page 45 of the 1911 Thistle, and the second is from page 148 of the 1912 Thistle. Both show very unambiguous views of the Cut, with no bridge in sight. I do expect future textbooks to cite me personally as having discovered this. I now feel absolutely confident saying that there was never a bridge over the Cut, and thus The Fence was never intended to serve as a meeting point for the men and women of the two schools. 
So there you have it. A committee of students from the class of 1923 put up a Fence so that seniors would have their own special place on campus to sit. It was put up on May 21, 1923, 100 Carnivals ago — so while its actual birthday might be well into our summer break, I'm considering this Carnival to be its 100th birthday in spirit. And now we can finally update the rest of Wikipedia.

Ceci,
This will be my last letter. Cynthia made a good choice, this cemetery looks really beautiful in the autumn. The section right behind you two has a hill where I can just barely make out the Manhattan skyline. I wonder if the trees here know that orange is your favorite color. Sorry, was your favorite color. I suppose you don't really have a preference now. 
I've stopped taking JuVen. Roy passed away six months ago from liver cancer. I thought we had figured that disease out, but I guess they haven't nailed down treatments for every form. He was pretty old too, so I don't even think he would have wanted to fight it. It's not right to outlive both your kids. If I'm not careful, I might even outlive my grandkids. Tabitha and Merou are about to be in their sixties, and Tabs is gonna have grandkids of her own. How wild is that? In a few months I'm going to be a great great grandfather. 
I'm done with physics. I'm sure I could join another company and let them wring another decade or two out of my brain, but they wouldn't do anything good with it anyways. My doctor said that I might even make it to 200 if I keep a good lifestyle, because my body takes unusually well to JuVen. I let them draw a blood sample for research, but I think that should be my last contribution to science.
I was trying to figure out how many connections I still have left, since there's so many people I want to say goodbye to. I'm not on the greatest terms with Clair's family, since Roy was the one who kept that connection. I considered reaching out to Arthur, since I heard he's got some big role in that new government they're setting up in the Pacific northwest. But I honestly don't know if he would recognize me. Are we even the same people after a century? It's weird I can measure my life with a century now. I remember how radically different my outlook on life became after JuVen, and if he's still going strong at this age, who knows what's going on in his head. If you plan on living well into your hundreds, a friend from college might feel as insignificant as a friend from preschool. 
I only have the energy for one more move, so I think I'll move in with Tabs and her family in the Netherlands. I don't speak a word of Dutch, but I don't suppose I'll need to learn a lot. My doctor says that once I stop the JuVen, I'll become a very old man very abruptly. Who knows how often I'll even leave the house? 
The thought of being too old to take care of myself is terrifying, but I guess it shouldn't be. If you were here, you'd probably tell me, "It's just the way things are, there's no point in being scared." And then I'd realize that my life can still be meaningful, even if I'm too old to know my own name, and I'd think about you and smile. You aren't here to tell me that, but now I think I can finally believe myself when I say it. 
Do you want to hear something crazy? You died exactly 68 years ago today. We've been without you nearly as long as we had you. That doesn't feel right, somehow. It feels like since you died, I've just been living one long epilogue to my life. Which is strange, because I spent most of my early decades living the prologue to my life. When did I actually live?
I guess there's no best way to spend your time. Everything that happens is just the sum of your choices and the people you meet, and a lot of it is beyond your control. Maybe you could have told me that — maybe you actually did tell me that once. If you ever did, I don't think I listened. Sometimes advice doesn't make any sense until you come to the realization by yourself. I think I finally understand how you did it. 
I would finish this with "see you on the other side," but I'm too smart to believe in another side. This was all I got. 
Love you until the end, 
Andrew

Hello and welcome to Booth 2023 ratings from two of the most unqualified booth raters. Enjoy whatever this is!
The first booth we visited was none other than Delta Tau Delta’s "Adventure Time"-themed booth! We loved the outside banner and the very clear storyline. 'Twas well done indeed. The PENGUINS!!! They were the highlight of this booth. It was also impressive to see the "Adventure Time" Pac-man game machine, but the game itself was a bit lacking. Overall, solid booth!
Rating: 3.5 stars
Delta Delta Delta (Tri-delt) brought the heat with a "Coraline"-themed booth. This was pretty awesome. The paint job was simply beautiful and there was SO MUCH innovative artwork like the tissue paper Phipps room (which was one of our favorites). The purple lights were cool and the cake was awesome. However, the last two rooms were a bit barren and confusing. Still, very cool booth!
Rating: 3.75 stars
Singapore Students’ Association (SSA) surprised us with a Singapore themed booth. Woah. This booth did so much with little space. CAN WE TALK ABOUT THE POND?? It was so cool. The clouds were gorgeous too. The exterior was stunning as well. Go SSA!
Rating: 4 stars
The Astronomy Club delivered an out of this world entrance, featuring an ASTRONAUT SCOTTY! And a dog in a rocket? However, the inside was too good of a replica of Mars — that is, nothing was there. Space be like that sometimes.
Rating: 3 stars
PRISM eased us in with a warm welcome to "Stardew Valley." The walls featured beautiful pixelated artwork from the game, however the floors were simply unpainted. The lights were nice, but the duck game? What kind of monsters don’t let you keep the duck you tried so hard to fish? We shed a few tears, parting without our prize. 
Rating: 2.5 stars
The Japanese Student Organization pulled up in a lifesize Catbus, straight out of Studio Ghibli. Super cool exterior, and an interior bursting with personality and vibrancy. We played our second fishing game, and actually WON A PRIZE! Granted, it was a sticker instead of a duck, but a win is a win. The detail was immaculate, but a second room would’ve provided some much needed movement.
Rating: 3.5 stars
KGB slapped us in the face with a full scale Monopoly game, in which you become a tax evasion expert. While the rooms were lacking in detail, the outside was a sight to behold. Also, the interactive game was really, really fun. Probably the best game we played in all the booths. Still, even with our generous severance package, the full experience felt a little empty.
Rating: 3 stars
Phi Delta Theta brought us a two-story "Stranger Things"-themed booth, to celebrate Millie Bobby Brown’s engagement. The first room alone was filled to the brim with references to the show, including boxes of Eggos, a map of the upside down, and a walkie talkie. As we progressed through the booth, we found ourselves in Hawkins Laboratory, complete with hazmat suits and a “no trespassing” sign. Next, we entered a Will Byers pride room, which, while lacking in detail, was a fun tribute to the show. After walking downstairs into the upside down, we were caught in a web of black goo, faced down by a demogorgon. All in all a very intricate booth. The only downside was a perilous, undecorated walk downstairs. Still, very respectable.
Rating: 4.25 stars
Kappa Kappa Gamma was being judged when we arrived to check it out ourselves, so we could only see the beautiful exterior. That said, the outside alone was truly stunning, such that we felt comfortable giving it a solid rating.
Rating: 4 stars
Fringe took us down memory lane with a booth themed after Dr Seuss’ “Oh! The Places You’ll Go!” The first room was gorgeous, mixing painted walls with 3D elements to really bring the book to life. However, the next few rooms were a little empty, and certainly failed to deliver on the promise of the first room. The outside walkway featured beautiful truffula trees and art from Dr. Seuss’ many works, but by the time we got out there wasn’t enough for us to justify the perplexing middle rooms. 
Rating: 2.25 stars
The Asian Students Association brought us the Oscar winning “Everything, Everywhere, All at Once” booth, starting with the laundromat. There were real clothes in the washing machine! And the overhang outside, gorgeous. The walk upstairs was beautiful, featuring clever LEDs placed behind a dark wall. On the second floor we were greeted by Jamie Lee Curtis and a pile of tax forms, shortly followed by a sneaky raccoon hiding on a shelf. Then the references, oh, the references. Michelle Yeoh cracked in the glass, perfection. The painted characters were all stunning. The chef? Hysterical. We barely survived the beauty of those hot dog fingers. And at the end of it all, we were offered a chance to win a prize in a fun ping pong ball game? Enough said.
Rating: 5 stars
Sigma Phi Epsilon whipped out an "Avatar" booth that knocked our socks off with the complexity of its first room. The guy in the glass case was jaw dropping. After moving through the lab, we found ourselves in a lush jungle. Then we saw the floating islands with a waterfall out the bottom! A dragon fire creature greeted us outside before we returned to the jungle, filled now with neon flora and fauna. Finally, we descended a well painted staircase and concluded our journey. Not a lot of complaints, very cool.
Rating: 4.5 stars
Delta Gamma sent us down the rabbit hole into their "Alice in Wonderland"-themed booth, complete with a tree and stunning exterior. A caterpillar was even holding a La Prima coffee. Up the stairs, we found ourselves in the Queen’s Court, where we navigated well trimmed hedges adorned with roses. After a pleasant stroll, we moved downstairs to the tea party, where the stairs lit up as we stepped on them. There were even floating cards hanging from the ceiling. Next, we entered a sort of mushroom garden, complete with massive light up mushrooms and paper flowers. Lastly, we were met by the Queen of Hearts and her guards, who saw us exit this magical booth.
Rating: 4.75 stars
Kappa Alpha Theta brought us a "Harry Potter"-themed booth that really blew us away. The first room alone felt just like the Dursley household, complete with family photos and Harry’s birthday cake. Dobby and Hedwig were there, and the ceiling was covered with Hogwarts letters addressed to Harry himself. Then, we walked down Diagon Alley, where we saw Weasley’s Wizard Wheezes, Honeydukes Sweets, and Gringotts Bank. Next, we went up the stairs, where the walls were lined with talking pictures that really sucked us into the wizarding world. Upstairs we found the potion room, with Hermione and Ron there to say hello. On the walls were neat details, like homework assignments for students at Hogwarts. There was even a recipe for a Farnam potion! Next, we entered the quidditch room, where Harry and Draco were chasing after the golden snitch, which dangled before our eyes. Finally, we celebrated Christmas with the Weasleys, complete with a chess set and tree. On the exit stairs, we saw the pictures of Kappa Alpha Theta members, mixed in with many of "Harry Potter’s" most famous characters. Overall, incorporating dozens of references to the books and/or movies, and with a fantastic exterior, we couldn't find anything to complain about.
Rating: 5 stars
Chinese Students Association brought us a "Kung Fu Panda" booth, starting with an excellent rendition of the noodle shop, complete with ingredients, knives, pictures of Po, and Master Shifu. Next, we walked through a dark room furnished with training equipment from the movie. Finally, after greeting the Furious Five, we met Master Oogway at his final resting place under the cherry blossom tree.
Rating: 4 stars
Alpha Phi cranked up the nostalgia with a "Phineas and Ferb" booth, starting with the titular bros sitting under the tree, Ferb measuring something with a straightedge. Next, we moved into Perry the Platypus’ secret lair, featuring a near perfect rendition of Major Monogram and Carl. Next, we entered Dr. Doofenshmirtz Evil Inc.’s “-inator” room, complete with blueprints for some of Dr. Doofenshmirtz’s most evil inventions. Then, we watched Candace attempt to bust her brothers, pleading to her mother at the grocery store. Lastly, we entered the roller coaster room, where the gang gathered to witness the work of the Flynns. On our exit, we got to play a variety of songs from the show, including “Busted” and “S.I.M.P. (squirrels in my pants).” Unfortunately, there was no “Platypus Controlling Me” option, which is objectively their best song. That said, this was a beyond excellent booth, complete with a perfect replica of the roller coaster, and a life size Perry the Platypus.
Rating: 5 stars
Unfortunately, these judges got beat by the heat, and were only able to judge the exteriors of the final three booths. We extend our sincerest apologies to those who worked so hard on these booths, namely Alpha Epsilon Pi, Alpha Chi Omega, and the Taiwanese Students Association.
Alpha Epsilon Pi showed us a "Pokemon"-themed booth, which looked like a force to be reckoned with.
Rating: 3.75 stars
Alpha Chi Omega brought us to Neverland, featuring a gorgeous tree beside the entrance, as well as a charming Peter and Wendy.
Rating: 4.25 stars
The Taiwanese Students Association delivered an "Avatar: The Last Airbender" booth, which had a stunning exterior, incorporating a lovely porch, a cute awning, and overall great attention to detail. While we regretted not exploring further, we felt comfortable giving a respectable rating.
Rating: 4.5 stars
This concludes our ratings and reviews of this year’s booths. We were thoroughly impressed with so many of them, and hope to see more from these orgs in the future. To those who received low ratings, it’s not you, it’s us. We can all learn from this.

Another Dungeons & Dragons movie? Since 2000, numerous filmmakers have attempted to transfer the magical wonderful world of DnD to the big screen, all failing to achieve success in the box office or critics’ corner. Going into “Dungeons & Dragons: Honor Among Thieves,” one can’t help but think that it's going to be more of the unfunny, unlikable and irreparable damage to the source material that these films tend to be, but thankfully, this film is not only a smarter and more fleshed-out project than the previous cheap cash-grab movies, but delivers one of the best cinematic fantasy stories we’ve received since Peter Jackson’s “Rings Trilogy” adaptation and HBO’s “Game of Thrones.” 
One of the best decisions that “Honor Among Thieves” went with was choosing to stage the film completely within the realm of the actual world of DnD. This allowed for the comedy to be natural to the world rather than forced and artificial. Many people forget that a major attraction of Dungeons & Dragons as a game is humor that friends make with it. The filmmakers understood this and incorporated comedy into the film enough to remind us of this, but not to the point of exhaustion. 
It can be compared to Marvel’s “Guardians of the Galaxy” (2014), which manages a similar level of tongue-in-cheek type of banter along with storyline consequences, a fact underlined by the direction of Jonathan Goldstein, co-writer of “Spider-man: Homecoming” (2017). The only difference between this film and “Guardians” is that this film is actually funny. The comedy of “Honor Among Thieves” separates it from being just another Tolkien-esque fantasy epic, but doesn’t lead to hardcore nerdy aspects that would perhaps turn off the casual viewer.
Despite the poindextery community that DnD has, the film isn’t just 134 minutes of pure fan service and doesn’t even require one to know anything about the elements of the tabletop game to derive enjoyment. This is because there are some rules of DnD which the film completely overrides, in a sort of “homebrewed” fashion, for the sake of fun. For example neither 5th edition nor any other official rule-set allows Druids to turn into Owlbears, but the film does it anyway because it makes a memorable scene. Letting the film run wild from the ruleset actually benefits the film as it mitigates predictability for veteran players in the audience.
Dungeons & Dragons is a trope-and-gag heavy game. The average Dungeon Master isn’t an expert storyteller, meaning that they’ll likely rely on common storylines and witticisms to entertain the party in substitute of some grand original poetic idea. It should be praised that the film balances the fine line between traditional movie storytelling and a campaign tale well enough that, no matter your knowledge of DnD, you’re never left confused.
The visuals of the film are beautiful in a way that respects the source material, trying not to be a discount version of The Shire or other stereotypical fantasy landscapes. Everything from the spells, towns, the graveyard, the labyrinth, the forests, and the creatures are well designed and animated beyond expectations, and it is delightful to finally see them done right.
Our main characters, especially our barbarian Holga (Michelle Rodriguez) and bard Edgin (Chris Pine), all battle for the scene spotlight just as much as they do against assassins and big red pudgy dragons. Every character is more than a comedic tool with their emotions and desires, secret or not, building them to be both likable and cared about by us, but their actions also make them smart and interesting rather than hair-pulling. This is not an MCU movie, and it cannot be overstated how thankful the people should be for that. 
“Dungeons & Dragons: Honor Among Thieves” is a nat-20 success, so much so that by measuring its box-office draw, it wouldn’t be outlandish for Paramount to turn this film into a series of its own. Whether Paramount should is a different question all on its own, as although Dungeons & Dragons has potential to provide an infinite amount of interesting stories, turning this film into a series could lose what made this one so good. Ultimately, basement dweller or not, all people will find themselves smiling by the end of this film. Being in a packed theatre and listening to the crowd roar with laughter, it’s films like these which make going to the movies an experience to love, and more than that, makes one want to go back to see it a second time.

During Family Weekend in October, the Spanish and Latin Student Association (SALSA) hosted its annual Noche Latina. Local Latin fusion band Gavas Beat played live music as over 400 community members danced, celebrating their heritage and culture. It was SALSA’s biggest event of the year, and the Joint Funding Committee (JFC) awarded them $5,800 to pay for the band, space, food, decor, and advertisement. But without emergency funds from the Center for Student Diversity and Inclusion (CSDI), SALSA president Melina Castillo said there is no way they could have pulled it off. 
Requesting emergency funding for Noche Latina has almost become as much of a tradition as the event itself. Castillo, a third-year electrical and computer engineering student, said that SALSA relies heavily on CSDI support and funding for many of its events. 
After Noche Latina, SALSA — Carnegie Mellon’s biggest Latine student organization with over 170 active members — had $1,000 budgeted for the rest of the year. To make up for JFC cuts, SALSA occasionally charges for event admission. Castillo said many of the students SALSA serves are those who most need access to free events and resources.
SALSA marketing director Nicole Lopez, a second-year majoring in Hispanic studies and global studies, told The Tartan that SALSA only charges because it needs to. “Sometimes people can’t show up because we’re forced to charge them,” she said, referring to a recent survey SALSA sent. Some members reported that they couldn’t afford admission prices. “I really want to make it more open,” Lopez explained, but added that SALSA can’t “make up the funds out of nowhere.” 
SALSA offers Latine students a slice of home where they might not otherwise find it on campus. Executive board members told The Tartan that being part of the org has improved their mental and physical health. When Castillo noticed not just that SALSA’s budget had been cut, but that it was disproportionately lower than other multicultural orgs, she drafted an open letter and petition. 
“Only 5 out of 13 [budget] sections were funded to a point that could be considered ‘achievable’ all of which had a primary motive of what we would call ‘diversity promotion’ for CMU,” the letter states. SALSA published it on their Instagram on April 8, and the petition has garnered over 230 signatures. 
Undergraduate Senate President and electrical and computer engineering fourth-year Prithu Pareek said that disproportionately low funding for Latine and Black student groups is a systemic problem that will hopefully be solved by November, when budgets are finalized. Pareek invited SALSA to meet with him and other community leaders on Sunday, April 16.
Student Body President Natalie Salazar helped SALSA prepare for the meeting. “As a first-generation, Latina, equitable funding is something that I am deeply passionate about,” Salazar said, adding that she believed student government leaders are willing to come to the table and find solutions. 
“Students from SALSA, the Joint Funding Committee and Student Government are meeting together with support from university advisors to explore the concerns raised by SALSA,” dean of students Gina Casalegno wrote to The Tartan. “I appreciate their efforts to do the sometimes difficult but important and constructive work of self-governance.”
Student Body Vice President of Finance (VPF) Clarissa Liang, a fourth-year business administration student who attended Sunday’s meeting, agreed that SALSA is underfunded. But Liang said JFC budget metrics and organizational structure make the situation more nuanced than she feels JFC has been given credit for. 
Systemic shortcomings
All 28 JFC advisors are Carnegie Mellon students who are each responsible for nine student orgs. None are Black or Latine. This is the discrepancy that most stands out to student leaders of the Colombian Student Organization. 
Colombian Student Organization co-president and treasurer Tatiana Behar Russy, a master’s student in arts and entertainment management, said that a more representative roll call among JFC advisors could help with funding disparities. She doesn’t think anyone is actively trying to underfund certain orgs; she just thinks there may be less appreciation for cultures with which JFC advisors don’t identify. “The most important message here is that it would be great to feel more represented in the JFC committee,” she told The Tartan. 
In her two-term tenure as VPF, Liang proposed and created an honorarium for students serving on the JFC. New advisors receive a $500 stipend and returning advisors receive $750. Liang sees this as a gift rather than representative compensation, but hopes it helps make serving on JFC more accessible. “I implemented this because I realized that [serving on JFC] is very skewed towards people who have financial stability, who can afford to put this much time into it,” she told The Tartan. 
Once Liang introduced the honorarium, being a JFC advisor became a competitive position. In years prior JFC often took whoever they could get, but this year Liang interviewed 30 applicants vying for 15 available spots. Liang said this increased the caliber of JFC advisors, but not their diversity. She doesn’t believe any students who applied to the position were Black or Latine. As in past years, most applicants hailed from Tepper.  
Liang acknowledged that messages between student orgs and their JFC advisor can sometimes get lost in translation. With the high time commitment the position requires, Liang said she felt that students sometimes forget that their JFC advisor is their peer. She explained that when advisors justify cutting a line item with standardized or vague language, they do this because they don’t have time to go through each cut on each org’s budget list and provide a detailed analysis. That’s why Liang encourages organizations to come to appeals, a space where students can advocate for more funding and explain line items’ significance. 
“We’re not trying to make this anything personal. We’re just trying to correct a system that is clearly not equitable,” SALSA president Castillo said. “We’ve been asking for this for a long time.” 
How JFC decides
A common cause behind budget disparities is limited or slow communication between orgs and their advisors, whose “first job is to be students,” Liang said. She explained that there have been many conversations about changing the structure of JFC so it flows more smoothly. The organization’s bylaws set a 30-person ceiling for JFC advisors, so Liang said she can’t increase the number of advisors and spread out their workload. Liang hopes the honorarium will help to offset this limitation, and sees the standard process as one that is as fair and impartial as possible. 
This year the JFC had about $2 million to allocate to 250 student organizations, which collectively requested $4.2 million. When it comes to budget cuts, Liang said JFC factors in many data points. Liang believes the process is as fair as possible, but very complicated.
Advisors decide what to cut based on six specific — and many other — merit criteria. First on the list is campus impact, including items that promote “strengthening CMU’s reputation, diversity and Inclusion [sic], sustainability, etc.” Other factors include historical precedent and fiscal responsibility. 
SALSA said that it’s trying to play catch up. The org plans to spend all of its $6,600 budget this year, in addition to receiving emergency funding, and requested $20,480 for FY24. SALSA said this may seem like a leap from one year to the next, but they are starting from a place where they are heavily reliant on CSDI support. 
According to the Society of Hispanic Professional Engineers, their FY24 budget cuts are “consistent with our club’s history with JFC.” While JFC meets its criteria for historical precedence and consistency, this may help perpetuate underfunding.  
“While the system is imperfect, we do our best to be fair and impartial,” Liang said. She said JFC is open to hear out org’s requests, pointing to a time when the women’s soccer team told the JFC they were significantly underfunded compared to the men’s team. Liang said the JFC was glad their attention had been brought to the discrepancy and increased the women’s soccer budget accordingly.  
Other avenues for change
In addition to JFC advisors, SALSA has asked for more representation within Senate. At a town hall last semester, they proposed establishing a Tartan Scholar senator to be a voice for limited-resourced students. They’ve since expanded this vision to perhaps introduce a Senate advocacy position, like the ones that exist within the Graduate Student Association, that would fulfill the same mission. 
Undergraduate Senate Chair Prithu Pareek told The Tartan that Senate has considered reserving positions for underrepresented student groups, but would need to decide which groups received this designation. He added that, “given that there’s so many vacancies on Senate seats, is it necessary to create more seats when the barrier to entry to Senate is very, very low currently?” Across all colleges, Pareek said there were five or six vacancies this year. 
Competition isn’t the barrier Castillo is worried about. They were hoping the position could be a paid one, “especially given that Tartan Scholars are specifically socioeconomically disadvantaged.” While JFC advisors and student government executive committee members are compensated, senators are not. Castillo envisions a paid Tartan Scholar seat, making space for a representative that may have otherwise been working a part-time job.
Castillo also wants clearer communication between JFC and student orgs. At last semester’s town hall, Castillo told Liang that SALSA was being underfunded.
Castillo spoke to Liang about SALSA at last semester’s town hall and expected to hear about a follow-up discussion. When SALSA didn’t, Castillo thought JFC had forgotten about her concerns. Castillo had also noted that SALSA was underfunded in November, in this year’s declaration of intent, and discussed her concerns with her JFC advisor during budget proposals in the spring. As Castillo waited for someone to reach out to her, Liang expected SALSA to do the same. 
With her oversight of 250 orgs, Liang said she doesn’t have time to investigate every matter she hears about. When Castillo told her about SALSA’s budget disparities, Liang said she told Castillo to send her an email with data and more context. When SALSA’s JFC advisor told her that SALSA said they were being underfunded, Liang told the advisor to tell SALSA to send her an email with data and context. 
Neither Liang nor SALSA was satisfied with the game of telephone between them. 
“When you are requesting funding and bringing an issue, I will do the work, but you need to provide me context, especially the time during appeals when I have so much going on,” Liang told The Tartan. “I don’t have the time and the bandwidth to really reach out.” 
A critical space for students
During her first semester on campus last year, international politics and strategy student Destiny Ogando felt isolated. She wanted a place that celebrated the intersection of her Hispanic and Black identities, but her Tartan Scholar mentor didn’t know of an organization that met that description. Without knowing anyone who shared her background, Ogando found it hard to connect with her peers and professors. “There’s no Dominicans on campus, no Hispanics on campus, very few Afro-Latinos,” she said. “In my classes, no one looked like me, no one sounded like me.” SALSA offered Ogando a space to celebrate her identities and reflect them back to her. 
In AY 2016-2017, nine percent of Carnegie Mellon students identified as Hispanic or Latino. According to the Common Data Set, that number has remained relatively steady, bumping to 10 percent in AY 2019-20, back down to nine in AY 2020-21, and currently resting at 11 percent. Five percent of students identify as Black or African-American, up from four percent in AY 2016-2017. In the U.S., 19 percent of people identify as Hispanic and 14 percent identify as Black. 
Nicole Lopez felt a big cultural shift when she moved from her hometown in California — where Spanish was spoken and heard often — to Pittsburgh. She wants students to feel welcomed and safe in the city, and to know “it’s okay to speak Spanish and it’s okay to speak with an accent.” She said SALSA is a space that made that happen for her, especially when she started her Carnegie Mellon experience in the college of engineering, where she seldom had class with students who looked like her. 
Melina Castillo was a first-year when Carnegie Mellon was virtual for pandemic safety, and she could count the number of friends she had on one hand. She struggled with classes and didn’t know where to find help. “I was just so lonely to the point where I just felt like I had no reason to leave my room anymore.” They missed meals. “I just couldn’t stand going out and feeling such an incredible loneliness,” Castillo said. She found community in SALSA during her second year, but as her social life improved her grades slid. Now that they’ve found more balance in their third-year, they see SALSA as a critical way to empower students and support their wellbeing. Castillo emphasized that this wouldn’t be possible without CSDI resources and funding.
Castillo thinks SALSA’s impact is bigger than what their budget suggests. “This is an experience that doesn’t just affect how much fun you have. It affects your motivation to get up and go to class in the morning.” 
Third-year social and decision sciences major Laura Gallegos told The Tartan that students can’t thrive unless they feel included. “We’re all different,” Gallegos said. “That’s what diversity entails: being able to come from all these different identities but also be able to come to your home base and be able to relate to others and see yourself within your own.” For Gallegos, SALSA is that home base. 
If the university doesn’t invest in Latine and Black student organizations the way it does for other affinity spaces, Gallegos said, “you can’t expect the students to feel like they belong on this campus. And if they don’t belong on this campus, then how do you expect them to succeed?”

Buggy this year was a continuation of one of Carnegie Mellon’s oldest and most unique traditions. Following SDC’s disqualification from buggy, they were only allowed to run an exhibition, which they completed in 2:16. Other exhibitions were also run, including a robotic buggy, Robobuggy, and buggies from various faculty organizations.
The first heat of the preliminary rounds was SigNu buggies, which kicked off twelve women’s heats including 21 different buggies. Out of the competitors, three were disqualified: SigEp B for a lane violation, Fringe D for a roster violation, and CIA A for failing the buggy drop test. CIA A was determined to have hit debris, and was granted a reroll for the next day.
Out of the 18 qualifying buggies, 10 were selected to continue onto the second round.
For the men's heats, 22 teams competed across 11 heats, with three teams disqualified; Spirit C, after having a controlled stop, was granted a reroll.
Following the preliminaries, the top 10 men's and women's buggies would compete in the finals the next day.
In the women's finals, SPIRIT retained their title with the buggy Seraph, finishing with a time of 2:35. CIA’s buggy Equinox made second place, with Fringe’s buggy Baltic rounding out the top three.
In the men's finals, PiKA’s buggy Banshee brought the organization their first title since 2008, marking a 2:07 time, with SPIRIT’s Seraph coming in second, and Apex’s Firefly reroll coming in third.
Finally, for the All Gender Finals, a first for CMU Buggy, Apex took home first place with a 2:45 time. PiKA’s Raptor won second, and CIA’s Equinox took home the third place finish.
In terms of awards, CIA’s Roadrunner won best design, with Robobuggy’s Short Circuit for best robotic design. Fringe’s Brimstone won the People’s Choice award, and the organization won the Tom Wood Spirit of Buggy award. Robobuggy and Radio Club took home the Chairman’s Choice award, with Robobuggy also winning the best T-shirt award. Delta Gamma won most improved, and SigEp’s Mia Krishnamurthi won Chair of the Year.
Rounding out the awards, Seth Setse from SPIRIT won King of the Hill, Leo Hasher from CIA won Queen of the Hill, and Thomas Cornelius from PiKA won Monarch of the Hill.

The Republic of Finland joined NATO on April 4, following a tumultuous process held up at times by Hungary and Turkey. The country is the 31st member state to NATO, one that spent much of the Cold War as a neutral or moderately neutral party, though Finland had undergone military drills with NATO forces in recent times.
The era of Finland’s non-alignment ended with the Russian invasion of Ukraine. Vladimir Putin, a long-time NATO enemy, wanted to prevent Russia’s border with NATO from expanding via Ukrainian membership, though through his invasion, he pushed Sweden and Finland, historically neutral countries, solidly into NATO. The coalition's border with Russia, a factor that Putin had raised concern about, has since doubled. While Finland will now enjoy the protections of the NATO coalition, Russia has threatened to deploy further military materials to the borders should the United States or any other NATO power put any weapons systems in the country. Finland’s entry also brings significant military capability into NATO, including some 1,500 artillery pieces, over a quarter of a million standing forces, and nearly a million more capable of being called up in the case of a war. These troops provide a serious increase in manpower to NATO, especially as the coalition continues to rebuild its strengths in Eastern Europe following post-Cold War drawdowns.
While NATO will receive substantial increases in military manpower, material, and stockpiles, Finland will gain protections afforded to NATO through Article 5 of the NATO charter — which indicates that an attack on any one nation within NATO is an attack on them all. This article provides any NATO member country with significant military aid and equipment in the case that they are invaded by a hostile power, and, thanks to the United States’ significant logistical power, would essentially entail giving any NATO member access to one of the largest arsenals in human history. 
Finland’s joining of NATO was initially quite surprising — the country had not seen any reason to join the coalition prior to the invasion of Ukraine, but both Finland and Sweden saw massive spikes in approval towards joining following Russia’s offensive actions. With nearly four-fifths of Finland’s population now in favor of joining NATO, public perception on the coalition has shifted dramatically in the last two years.
As of right now, Sweden remains stranded outside of NATO membership as both Hungary and Turkey have not yet ratified the country's ascension. While the refusal of these powers to ratify Sweden has definitely been a road bump, considering the close integration and friendship between Sweden and Finland, both countries will now also be integrated into NATO, Finland explicitly, and Sweden by proxy.

Tensions have escalated between Israel, Jordan, and Syria, as the fallout of the Israel Defense Force's (IDF) storming of the al-Aqsa mosque continues to unfold.
On April 6, the IDF and Israeli police stormed the al-Aqsa mosque, claiming that "agitators" had holed themselves inside the mosque. The police were met with fireworks and other projectiles, and after the mosque had been cleared, over 300 people were arrested or removed from the area. A few hours later, the police stormed the mosque a second time, removing what they claimed were further agitators, and refusing to allow people to enter the mosque. 
The al-Aqsa mosque is an incredibly important site to Judaism, Christianity, and Islam. As such, it remains a flashpoint for conflict between the country’s sizable Muslim and Jewish populations. 
The storming of al-Aqsa during Ramadan led to widespread condemnation from Arabic countries in the region. Egypt and Jordan were the loudest voices condemning Israel for its actions, with Jordan floating the possibility of calling a special meeting of the Arab League, a multinational coalition of countries meant to promote unity among Arab countries, which also has a history of anti-Israeli aggression and policies. These developments from Israel’s neighbors are part of a larger pattern of tense policy between the country and other nations on or near its borders, especially after the election and policies of right-wing hardliner, Benjamin Netanyahu.
Hamas, the current governing party of Gaza, as well as an internationally-designated terror organization, also released a statement condemning the storming of al-Aqsa. Shortly after the statement was released, 10 rockets were launched from the Gaza Strip towards Israel, none of which caused any casualties. The IDF responded with a missile attack on Hamas manufacturing and storage centers in the Gaza Strip. 
This was followed by a rocket attack, numbering 34 missiles, launched from Lebanon into Israel. Allegedly, the rockets were fired by the Palestinian Islamic Jihad, another Palestinian militant/terror organization, and not by Lebanon-based Hezbollah. The rocket attack on Lebanon also prompted Israeli response, and the country traded missile launches against Lebanon. This is another step on the escalation against various Palestinian organizations that have taken increasingly hostile actions against Israel, as the country faces one of the deadliest years on record.
Following the response to Lebanon, Israel faced further rocket launches from Syria, three aimed at Israeli occupied Golan Heights, and three more aimed at North Israel.
Israel’s response was further rocket attacks on Syria and Iranian operators in Syria, killing two Iranian military advisors, and putting two airports in the country out of operation. Israel considers Iran to be the greatest threat to the country in the region, referring to the calls for the destruction of Israel that Iran propagates, as well as the support for terror groups like Hezbollah and Hamas who have the genocide of Israeli Jews as tenets of their charters. Iran has also been funding and helping Bashar Al-Assad’s regime in the Syrian Civil War, a regime that has hosted Palestinian organizations, served as the base of operations for Iranian operations against Israel, and is responsible for chemical weapon attacks. This new set of attacks were targeted towards Palestinian organizations operating out of Syria, as well as material holdings of the Syria military. Israel has faced little to no damage from the attacks thanks to its Iron Dome program designed to shoot down missiles before they hit important regions in the country.
Considering the severity of these attacks, now including Lebanon, Israel, and Syria, as well as occupied Palestinian regions, the conflict seems to be rising to new heights. Jordan’s desire for a meeting of the Arab League may inform how the countries will act in the future.

As this past week was Carnival, the Undergraduate Student Senate did not meet for their weekly meeting. However, they voted on two measures this week. 
The first was J.22.08, an amendment to the student government fiscal policy. These amendments focused on making changes to how appeals work for the joint Senate and Graduate Student Association (GSA) meeting and allowing for rollover of the Student Government Executive Budget.
Currently, if an organization wishes to appeal a portion of their budget after the Joint Funding Committee (JFC) appeals, they must bring that business to the joint Senate and GSA meeting. The current language indicates that “Any member of Senate or the GSA may lobby an appeal to any item in the JFC budget proposal.” The amendment would alter such that “one member of Senate and one member of the GSA are required to lobby an appeal to any item in the JFC budget proposal.” Two additional requirements were also added to the amendment: “The appeal may only be lobbied at the joint meeting if the organization has participated in the first round of appeals at the Joint Funding Committee” and “The student leader representing the organization may not be a member of Senate or the graduate Senate Assembly.” 
The second part of the proposed amendment aimed to allow up to $15,000 of remaining funds in the Student Government Executive account to rollover, with the rest being returned to the JFC Main account. The current language does not allow for any rollover from this account.
This amendment needed a 3/4 supermajority to pass. The final vote was 15-7-2, so the motion to pass the amendment failed.
The second measure was S.Res.16.2022, a resolution to merge the committees on advocacy and governmental affairs. On Nov. 21, 2022, the Senate Executive Committee passed S.E.Res.01.2022, which created the Select Committee on Governmental Affairs. However, this proposal aims to merge this committee with the Committee on Advocacy, as both focus on advocacy; the committee would retain the name the Committee on Advocacy. 
This resolution needed 3/4 supermajority to pass. The final vote was 21-2-1, so the motion to pass the resolution succeeded.

At 11:15 p.m. on Monday, April 10, Pittsburgh police responded to a report of shots fired at the Hillman Library, in an unsettling parallel to the March 29 hoax reporting of shots fired at Central Catholic High School. After conducting a search of the building, it was determined that there was no active shooter situation and students were soon permitted to retrieve personal belongings. However, the University of Pittsburgh has drawn criticism for failing to use their emergency system to notify students of the incident in a timely manner. Instead of receiving official information from the university, students were left to piece together events from cell phone footage of police carrying their weapons through the library and testimonial from their peers, many of whom claimed to hear a shot in the building (as it turns out, a police officer did in fact discharge their weapon to open a door to access another section of the building). 
The lack of clear and timely messaging from Pitt is concerningly similar to the failure of Carnegie Mellon to clearly notify students of the events that were unfolding at Central Catholic. The fact that these two events happened in such quick succession highlights much more clearly the flaws in these systems. Clear dissemination of information is critical to prevent unnecessary panic and confusion. While it's understandable that a university would not want to risk causing alarm by declaring an emergency before finding proof of the threat (especially since panic can also be extremely dangerous), people inevitably use word-of-mouth and social media to learn about events.
During the hoax incident at Central Catholic, an unverified twitter account named "Real News and Alerts Allegheny County" was the first source to report on the shooting that, at the time, was not yet known to be a hoax. At 10:24 a.m., fewer than 10 minutes after the first cop car arrived at Central, they tweeted that a 911 caller had reported "6 people shot inside Central Catholic H.S." This account was most likely acting on the only information available at the time, since it seems that it wasn't clear to anybody whether the threat was genuine at the time. However, Carnegie Mellon students did not receive an emergency alert for another 15 minutes (which did not even contain instructions to shelter-in-place), at which point many had already learned about the situation from other sources. The tweet from "Real News and Alerts" was spread widely and rapidly, along with low-quality photos showing gurneys on the sidewalk outside Central Catholic, leading many to believe that a shooting was truly taking place. 
The contents of the emergency message only said that there was a "large police presence" at Central Catholic. It should be recognized that this was a good decision on the part of the university, as it would have been irresponsible to report on a shooting before there was any evidence of such. However, the university failed to use the emergency alert system to call for a shelter-in-place for students. The only students who received the shelter-in-place message on their phones were those with the Rave Guardian app, which is far from ubiquitous on campus.
Had there truly been an active shooter situation, sheltering in place would have been imperative for the safety of students and for law enforcement to take action without interference.
It is very important to establish clear channels of communication, and for unambiguous messages to be distributed universally in the event of an emergency. Both Pitt and Carnegie Mellon should review their protocol for distributing information and how they advise students to act in emergency situations. Since spree shootings are tragically common in this country, one of the best things that institutions can do to minimize the risk is ensure that people are informed and understand how to safely act in such situations. The two hoax reports of shootings served as real-life tests of our emergency alert systems, and it has become impossible to ignore that these systems would be woefully underequipped to respond in a real emergency.

I recently finished “Rabbits” by Terry Miles, a book that was just good enough to make me binge-read it. I would describe it as a better "Ready Player One" with 100 percent less misogyny. While I wouldn't call it “genre-defining,” it was a pretty good modern science-fiction book that leans into many different sci-fi topics. But what did I think was its problem? The worldbuilding could have been so much better. 
Throughout “Rabbits,” Miles builds the world through stories and flashbacks from the main character. The reader is introduced to the concept of “Rabbits” (something I won’t get into, but definitely give the book a read to find out) as the main character is giving a speech about it. This is lazy storytelling, and it definitely hurt my opinion of the book. There are several other instances where the author is forced to establish something about the world in this manner, and it just feels lazy. 
I feel like this problem becomes very relevant in plot-driven sci-fi books — the author doesn’t know how to express some key feature of the world that the story relies on, so they shoehorn it into some form of monologue. At the same time, it’s sometimes necessary for the reader to get a grip on the world they are reading about. For instance, “Dune” is so different from the real world and of such a large scale that it would be almost impossible for the reader to get a full sense of the world just through the main character’s experiences. 
While it might be necessary to do this some times, I think “Dune” handles it pretty well. The basics of some in-world concepts need to be explained (the role of Arrakis and the Bene Gesserit), but the more complex aspects are shown through the actions and interactions of the characters with the world — I didn’t feel like I was constantly being spoon-fed information to flesh out the world.
I’m also a huge fan of books that take an “in media res” approach to developing the world. “In media res” means starting in the middle of things happening and then building the world around those events. “The Game-Players of Titan” by Phillip K. Dick takes this approach. I’m a huge fan of books that make the reader ask questions about the world and then slowly give those answers throughout the book. In “The Game-Players of Titan,” the reader immediately wants to know how exactly someone can lose the town of Berkley when gambling or how you need to roll an eleven to get a new wife. Books that can set up a world where the reader wants to know more are doing it right. 
I also acknowledge that sometimes it’s okay to just dump some information about the world and move on. This works for books that are much more focused on characters rather than a plot. Character-driven books focus a lot more on the interactions between characters (and sometimes the world), and writers should take into account how much they care about their world and how familiar the reader should be with it. Take, for instance, “They Both Die at the End” by Adam Silvera. It’s a fairly familiar world where the only difference is people are told on the day they die that they are going to die. The book doesn’t need to focus much on the world because it’s familiar to the reader and it follows the interactions between the characters rather than the characters and the world. 
World-building is such an important part of science-fiction and it’s frustrating when it’s not done well, especially if the book’s premise is good. Readers shouldn’t have to suffer through a great story with a subpar world.

Two weeks ago, the world was blessed with a collab album from Danny Brown and JPEG Mafia, two rappers who have maintained a strong presence in the music industry despite their relative lack of mainstream appeal. Their unique production styles put them in the umbrella of "experimental hip-hop," and they both seem to deliberately avoid making anything with a trace of pop appeal. I won't pretend that I'm super knowledgeable about either of these artists, but I am familiar with the types of online communities that love their music. This isn't a review of these artists or of the album, it's a rant about the types of people who have a weird superiority complex about their music taste. 
I'm a big fan of this album. It's high-energy, funky, and the tracks are all distinctly weird in their own way. This music has found an audience in a particular kind of hip-hop enjoyer who falls loosely within the sphere of influence of Anthony Fantano, the bald-headed YouTube music reviewer everyone loves to hate. He's known for platforming a lot of artists outside of the mainstream, and he often puts people onto new music by drawing connections between different artists. People who watch his videos often find themselves listening to relatively obscure artists because of his very wide knowledge base.
The name of this recent album is "SCARING THE HOES." The idea of music which "scares the hoes" is tossed around a lot in this corner of the internet, and I get the sense that these artists are leaning into the brand that the internet has given them. It's also great marketing, because I would not be talking about this album if the name wasn't so weird.
But that doesn't change the fact that this is a really annoying way to sincerely view your music taste. Yes, I get that "scaring the hoes" is just a meme, but I sure do get the impression that lots of folks out there take this idea seriously. It's fine to like things that aren't mainstream, but you aren't some intimidating, stoic, sigma-male hoe-frightener because you listen to Danny Brown. Sure, his music can be weird, but it also gets pretty wide critical acclaim. Also, it's fine to like things that are extremely mainstream! A lot of pop music is popular because producers know what sounds people like. Not every song on your Spotify has to be esoteric underground experimental low-fi noise-hop, sometimes Travis Scott is pretty good.
In conclusion, enjoy the music you like and don't make a big deal out of it.

I love Carnegie Mellon, and I’m genuinely very happy that I chose to come here. However. I was raised in the South. Specifically, I was raised in a shitty little central Florida town where you had to go to the next town over to do anything remotely exciting. Our main attraction is a river. The one thing we did have? Soda. I could drive three to five minutes in any direction from my house and find a gas station selling 44 ounces of soda for 95 cents, and would regularly take advantage of this. It’s really my only vice — some people drink, some people smoke, and I get a pounding headache if I don’t have a soda in the afternoon. Now, imagine my frustration when I come into Morewood Gardens after a long and harrowing info desk shift, ready for the refreshing taste of Coca-Cola to make it all better. I swipe my CMU ID, ready to put those FLEX dollars to work, and slam that Coke button. “Out of Stock,” says the vending machine. Damn, okay, I guess I’ll have a Cherry Coke. Out of stock. Fine, a Dr. Pepper? Out of stock. Again and again, I try for every soda possible, only to be told that my one option is Diet Coke. Horrifying! Nightmare! Defeated, I turn to the dreaded P*psi vending machine, only to be told that my FLEX dollars are no good here, despite the signage indicating that this vending machine accepts FLEX dollars. I resist the urge to kick the shit out of the vending machine, and instead retreat to my room, doomed to another night of water. 
The vending machine situation on campus is a little ridiculous. What’s with the abandoned vending machines in Doherty A? Why haven’t they been stocked in months? The 50-cent Coke machine was my most dearly beloved last semester; why has it been so neglected? Every week I come back, praying that it might have a can or two in exchange for my quarters, and every week I am disappointed. Why does Morewood Gardens get a grand total of three empty, dysfunctional vending machines, while E-Tower gets a veritable vending machine buffet, locked just out of reach of us miserable Gardens residents? Why do so many vending machines lie directly to my face and claim to accept my meal plan? Why was I able to purchase a microwave burrito from a vending machine in Wean 2, but there is nary a Pop-Tart nor Pringle in my dorm? This inequality and discrimination against me personally must be stopped. 
“Haley,” you must be saying. “Just go to Entropy and get your drinks like a normal person.” Oh, you think you’re so smart, huh? Think you’re a real genius telling me to go to the campus convenience store? Well I’ve tried that, buckaroo, and guess what — it doesn’t work for me. This God-forsaken campus happens to be sponsored by my personal mortal enemy P*psi. You will not catch my ass drinking a P*psi! I am loyal to my beloved Coca-Cola, 'til death do us part. You try going into Entropy, and you find me a Coke. Oh, what was that? There are no Cokes? How about a Cherry Coke? A Sprite? A Dr. Pepper? Yeah, that’s what I thought. Until Carnegie Mellon sees the error of their ways and converts to the path of righteousness, I’m stuck with the vending machines. Carnegie Mellon, I’m begging on my knees — please restock my Coke machines.

Are you meant to recycle pizza boxes? Milk cartons? Compostable forks? There’s a lot of pressure on you to know what to recycle. And how to do it. And to own an electric car. And not use plastic bags. And to bike everywhere. 
It might seem overwhelming — it definitely does to me — but this is all intentional. Companies that destroy the planet, like oil and plastic companies, are really, really good at marketing, and part of the marketing is convincing you climate change is your fault. 
In 1977, a scientist at Exxon reported that burning fossil fuels may have an impact on the climate. This means that for almost 50 years, companies have been aware of the damage they are causing and have chosen not to change. Instead, they've actually worked very hard to cause more damage to the planet in the name of technological advancements and profit. 
In 1998 the American Petroleum Institute, an oil lobbying group, sent out an internal memo stating that “victory will be achieved when average citizens… recognize uncertainties in climate science.” Since then, petroleum companies have worked hard to stoke climate denial, calling climate change predictions “speculative” and “bad science.” Exxon even went to trial for misleading investors, although they were proven not guilty. Their effort to spread misinformation and create climate deniers definitely worked and has only gotten more extreme as climate change has become politicized.  
The most commonly known example of companies shifting blame is the idea of a carbon footprint, which was created by a design firm for British Petroleum (BP). It's truly an amazing feat of marketing! There are dozens of carbon footprint quizzes that tell you the total amount of greenhouse gasses you produce based on your clothes, food, and travel. Knowing exactly how you’re contributing to climate change can make you feel anxious or guilty, and while you might want to make slight lifestyle changes, IT IS NOT YOUR FAULT.  Another example is the Make America Beautiful recycling campaign, which is a “nonprofit devoted to educating and inspiring people to clean, green, & beautify their communities.” However, it is sponsored by companies like ​​Nestle, Anheuser-Busch, and Unilever, which all create tons and tons of waste through single-use products. Once again, it’s a marketing campaign to encourage individuals to do the job of big companies. 
I’ve taken a lot of environmental studies classes at Carnegie Mellon, and I joke with my friends that they make me want to litter. Let the record stand, I sort all my trash, but my joke is rooted in the frustration and powerlessness I feel as an individual. The more I learn about the environment the more I start to understand that the lack of action around climate change isn’t from a lack of knowledge, but from greed. 
While I am not advocating that we all stop recycling and driving diesel trucks, I want to point out individual action neither caused nor will stop climate change. But as individuals, we do have some power. We have the power to elect policymakers who will limit companies' actions and put laws in place to lessen the contribution to climate change. And, as smart, hardworking students we have the power to enter the workforce and cause the change the world has needed since the '70s.

I found out that Taylor Swift and Joe Alwyn broke up the way I find out all news that’s worth knowing: by someone next to me picking up their phone and immediately gasping. Entertainment Tonight managed to get their hands on some insider information before anyone else could, but didn’t have much to say on the breakup besides rehashing the relationship history. Most articles claim that the split was peaceful, which left me personally with a lot of questions. I’m not the type of person to read on Swift's life past what she puts in her music, and I certainly don’t think it’s anyone’s business to know anything real about her personal life. For this reason, I’m going to focus on the music and how it relates to Joe Alwyn as a symbol in Swift’s career, not as her actual boyfriend.
Ever since the release of “reputation” in 2017, Swift has been different. She stopped presenting as the serial-dating teen sensation that everyone loved to extort and entered a prolonged era of mystery and intrigue that I don’t think has since ended. She started using extensive webs of metaphor and symbolism in her lyrics that her maturing audience clung to and took as honesty. But why should we? To explain what I mean and how it relates to Taylor’s breakup with Joe Alwyn, I’m going to go through each album “era” since “reputation.”
“reputation” and the “Taylor’s Version” rereleases:
When Taylor Swift was 27, she decided she was, colloquially, done with this shit. “reputation,” conceptually, was an ode to her dissociating her career and her life from the media. It was loud, it was angry, but wait… was it? Tracks like “King Of My Heart” and “Dancing With Our Hands Tied” are some of her most devastating love ballads. For devoted Swifties, this was the first sign that there was a new development in Swift’s love life, though nobody could really figure out what that development was. I think that was the point. Coupled with her decision to rerelease the albums that had been stolen from her, I see this part of her career as a closing of doors. Everyone made her believe that she couldn’t do what she wanted, and she disrespectfully disagreed with them by reclaiming all of her old music rights (though lord knows she’s wealthy enough) and releasing an album that was not at all what it appeared to be.
“Lover”
And if you think she didn’t get away with that, you’ll be shocked to find out that she got away with it twice. “Lover,” with its pink blue sunset cover and its gorgeously emotional title track, was a hint to a new beau in Swift’s life that even non-Swifties caught. I personally caught it a little too hard and declared “Lover” one of my favorite albums of all time and ignored all the lyrics for quite some time. In truth, it’s pretty freaking sad. Nobody cared though, because the references to life-long partnership and British boys were so loud. People started digging, and they found Joe Alwyn, a British actor that Swift had actually already been dating for three years. This was proof that Swift could keep a secret, and she continued to keep the majority of their relationship private for the following three years, which is why nobody really has anything meaningful to say about the breakup.
“folklore” and “evermore” and “Midnights”
This is where I bring things back to her writing a little bit. What Swift fans love the most about these albums, besides their new style, is how thickly laden they are with symbols and metaphors and little tidbits from old albums and stories. The word for this, as you may know, is lore. Lore is super interesting to follow and there is certainly something to be said about marketing, but it also serves the very important purpose of making it seem like Swift is always sharing her life with us. She’s giving us her lore. The lore has even led to deep seated theories that Swift is queer (spawning a subgroup of fans that call themselves “Gaylors”) or that her relationship with Joe is not real. 
You can pull anything you want from the lyrics and the easter eggs, but the truth is that Swift likely has a really great imagination (or staff of well-paid writers.) And, as she told us with “reputation,” she has a really great reason to obfuscate what is actually going on in her life using her art. 
I still hold the opinion that she is one of the greatest writers of our time, but that doesn’t mean that what she writes is real. I also don’t think anyone should ever try and find out if it is. Enjoy her songs and leave her and Joe Alwyn to breakup in peace. Maybe we’ll even get some good breakup songs out of it.

As a little experiment, my mom got DNA kits for my twin brother and I for Christmas one year. I got one from 23andMe and my brother one from AncestryDNA. We wanted to see how different the results of the two were. Unsurprisingly, the two tests reported very similar things (who would have guessed?), but some percentages were slightly different or regions were classified differently. Kind of cool? 
I know a lot of people are on the fence or against sending their DNA off to some company where they will do who knows what with that information. I mean, if these companies want to sell the fact that I am 99.8 percent European, I hope I get some good targeted ads. I also don’t plan on committing any crimes that authorities would need to match my DNA to, so I should be safe on that front.
I will say I am still glad that privacy is a concern with these companies. 23AndMe and Ancestry both have privacy statements that detail what happens with your information, which is interesting if you give it a read. With 23andMe, your sample is kept for future testing until the user deletes their account or asks for it to be discarded. At Ancestry, future testing will only be done if the user opts into their research program. 
At this point, I’ll focus on 23andMe since it’s the service I used. 23andMe offers a variety of different kits; the main two are Ancestry + Traits and Health + Ancestry. The main difference is Health + Ancestry also gives the user a report on their genetic risk for 13 common diseases and carrier status for many congenital conditions like sickle cell anemia and cystic fibrosis. I only did Ancestry + Traits, so I don’t have access to those reports.
But is it worth it to pay $125 to learn about these things? Or rather, should I have to pay $125 to do so? 23andMe holds my genetic information which could potentially tell me I have some deadly disease that will kill me tomorrow — or it might tell me I should have no worries about genetic disease. That’s the gamble I’m playing by not paying for this information. 
While that is my choice, it really rubs me the wrong way that a company like 23andMe makes it cost so much to find out this information. The $125 upgrade most likely isn’t to recover the cost of genotyping my DNA; they run specials where it can cost only $49. But I suppose that’s just the story of companies in America. Doesn’t make me feel any better, though.  
Another thing that bugs me is that it most likely doesn’t take much effort to look for the health issues over the traits that are provided in the base version of the 23andMe kit. 23andMe identifies your traits or genetic health risks through a process called genotyping. Here, scientists cut up the DNA and copy it many times. This DNA is put on a slide and “sticks” to a DNA “probe” that shows which genetic variation your DNA matches. 
This process relies on knowing which section of the DNA corresponds to which preference or health risk, and the probes are interchangeable. Instead of looking for the section of your DNA that shows you probably have thick hair, a similar amount of effort could go into looking for a gene like APOE-e4, a risk gene that shows an increased likelihood of developing Alzheimers. Having 23andMe guess that I am probably right-handed is cool, but knowing if I’m going to die remembering my family would be even cooler. 
Overall, it’s really cool to get an overview of your genetic profile, but I still wish these companies would have better practices, especially when individuals’ health is concerned.

Content Warning — sexual assault, domestic violence, Ben Shapiro
If you're anything like me, you were probably extremely ambivalent about the Amber Heard-Johnny Depp defamation lawsuit while it was going on. Everything I learned about that was entirely against my will, because celebrity drama feels like perhaps the lowest form of entertainment.
You, like me, may also have been left with a vaguely negative impression of Amber Heard, even if you couldn't quite describe why. The smear campaign was so comprehensive that what little I did learn gave me the impression that Heard was the abuser (or at the very least, there was mutual abuse). Yet, I never made the effort to read into it because I had no interest in a defamation lawsuit between movie stars. Here's why I should have cared about it more at the time.
Let's recap the facts of the case. In 2018, Amber Heard wrote an op-ed for the Washington Post with the eerily prescient title, "I spoke up against sexual violence — and faced our culture's wrath. This has to change." In response to statements made in this op-ed, Johnny Depp sued Heard for defamation and won $350,000 in damages. Separately, the jury also found that Depp and his lawyer had defamed Heard during the trial, and she was awarded $2 million in damages. 
Recently, I came across a YouTube video titled "Amber Heard is Broke, Divorced, and Talentless," by none other than Mister Benjamin Shapiro. For the uninitiated, Ben Shapiro is an intellectually vacuous right-wing reactionary and author of some truly horrendous sci-fi. If the enemy of my enemy is my friend, then perhaps Ben's ravenous disdain for Heard should make me reconsider my position on the suit.
Obviously, we will never know the full story of what happened in the privacy of their relationship, and with the discourse so poisoned it's hard to find a balanced breakdown of who is at fault. It does seem that the relationship was highly dysfunctional and unhealthy from both ends. We know that Johnny Depp sent texts to other actors about wanting to kill and rape Heard. Furthermore, during the suit Heard was forced to relive these traumatic experiences on the witness stand, with the full understanding that she would be the target of overwhelmingly negative media coverage. 
With regards to who was more at fault, I would like to make one point. The existence of "mutual abuse" is extremely contentious, with many arguing it cannot exist. Abuse requires power imbalance, and it is impossible to have two people who each have more power than the other. There can certainly be mutually harmful or mutually toxic relationships, but toxic does not necessarily mean abusive. And if you want to figure out which of the parties had more power in the court of public opinion, try to recall if you'd ever heard the name Amber Heard before April of 2022. 
In a nutshell, Amber Heard was the victim of a massive, deliberate smear campaign by bad-faith actors — particularly on the online right — to heighten the coverage of her behavior while diminishing that of Depp. I doubt I'm the only one who (repeatedly) heard the story about Heard pooping on Depp's bed, but not the story of Depp threatening violence against Heard. It was arguably the greatest concentration of online misogynistic rhetoric since Gamergate. 
For those unaware, Gamergate was a targeted harassment campaign against female video game critics led by antifeminist, male video game YouTubers in 2014. It was somewhat of an inflection point for the growth of the alt-right, as it introduced many male adolescents to extremely toxic rhetoric about women via their interest in video game-related content. In much the same way, the virality of the Heard/Depp case mainstreamed a lot of really vindictive, misogynistic rhetoric about Heard, with no care given to producing a nuanced analysis of their relationship. 
One particularly insidious element of the media frenzy around this trial is how it co-opted the discourse on male abuse. In particular, Depp's experiences were framed as being invalidated by a society that can't view men as victims, and that those opposed to Depp must therefore be opposed to male abuse victims. There is a kernel of truth in this. As counterintuitive as it sounds, men do experience negative consequences of living under patriarchy — in particular, that a man can't be at the receiving end of a power imbalance. It's important to have a nuanced conversation about things like male abuse and sexual assault in a way that doesn't antagonize feminism. But these issues are repeatedly exploited by dishonest people for political ends, because many believe (or rather, want to believe) that these issues are being ignored by progressive or left-wing ideologies. The Depp-Heard trial had the perfect confluence of factors to allow the online right to have an absolute field day, by pushing with all their strength the narrative that Depp is the victim of a society which refuses to acknowledge male abuse. 
I think the fact that this is an issue I care about made it easy for me to fall for the prevailing online narrative, especially when I couldn't be bothered to do my own research. It was a bit shocking to learn that I'm still just as susceptible to targeted disinformation as I was in middle school, especially given how good my opinions are these days. At the time, a friend of mine told me that my ambivalence on the case was a "very online take." If only I'd listened to him. For anybody else who fell for this, let it serve as a reminder to stay vigilant when engaging with political issues on the internet. And maybe, if Ben Shapiro says something, consider that the opposite is probably true.
