When March rolls around each year, we hope for warmer weather, the fragrant smell of flowers, and the arrival of spring. But, most importantly, we await the NCAA men’s basketball tournament, three weekends of madness when we watch the top 64 college teams face off and fall in love with a Cinderella, the little team that could. This year is no different.
The 2018 tournament saw records being broken and brackets being busted. For the first time in tournament history, a lowest-ranked 16th seed upset a no. 1 seed, after 135 losses. When the little-known University of Maryland–Baltimore County shocked the world by beating the overall no. 1 University of Virginia, we knew we were in for an amazing tournament.
But, even before the historic 74–54 blowout on March 16, other upsets captured the country. No. 13 University at Buffalo defeated another favorite, no. 3 University of Arizona, and no. 11 Loyola University Chicago made a buzzer-beating three-pointer to take the win over no. 6, University of Miami, giving the world a small taste of what was to come in terms of upsets.
The second round brought even more madness, with upsets ruling into the second weekend. No. 11 Syracuse toppled no. 2 Michigan State University, and no. 7 Texas A&M University handed defending national champions University of North Carolina a stunning 21-point loss, one of their worst ever in the tournament.
In the Sweet Sixteen, the upsets continued, with perennial favorites no. 5 University of Kentucky and no. 4 Gonzaga University falling to no. 9 Kansas State University and no. 9 Florida State University, respectively.
However, in the later rounds, staples of the tournament remain, in recent champions no. 2 Duke University, no.1 Villanova University, and no. 1 University of Kansas. Both teams have had a relatively breezy tournament so far as they battle for their spot in the Final Four.
Undoubtedly, the Cinderella of the tournament has been Loyola Chicago, a small, underrated basketball program. In their first three games against higher-ranked teams, the Ramblers won with exciting buzzer-beaters, playing their way into the hearts of basketball fans around the country.
But it is the 98-year- old nun, chaplain of the team Sister Jean Dolores-Schmidt, who has become the symbol of hope and joy for the team. From her bracket predicting the team only going to the Sweet Sixteen, to her name on custom-made Air Jordans, Sister Jean and the Ramblers have embodied everything we love about college basketball: fun, joy, and the unexpected.
As the teams move toward the championship, it is safe to say that the tournament has delivered everything we could’ve ever hoped for.

A petition with more than 60,000 signatures. Advertisers boycotting newspapers. Calls to hold protests. People usually use tactics like these for political uprisings, but, in Pittsburgh, people use them against their baseball team.
The Pittsburgh Pirates had just traded away ace pitcher Gerrit Cole to the Houston Astros for what looked like chump change in Joe Musgrove and Colin Moran. Joe Musgrove was, at his best, a hard-throwing long reliever who could not find much success as a starter, and Colin Moran was a backup third baseman who wasn’t producing as much power as people thought that he was capable of.
Two days later, the Bucs flipped star center fielder Andrew McCutchen, a former National League MVP and five-time All-Star, to the Giants for some bullpen help in Kyle Crick and future outfield depth in minor league prospect Brian Reynolds.
These trades came as a surprise to many Pirates fans. After two consecutive losing seasons in 2016 and 2017, it seemed that the Pirates’ front office felt that the core team they had built to break out of a 20-year losing streak was unable to finish what they had started.
Fans became angry. Fingers were pointed at Bob Nutting, majority owner of the Pirates who has been criticized in the past for prioritizing the bottom dollar over winning a World Series. A petition was started on change.org to force Nutting out of ownership of the team. Weirton Medical Center in West Virginia pulled its advertisements from the three different Nutting-owned newspaper publications simply over the McCutchen trade. Multiple posts were made on the Pirates section of popular website Reddit giving out ideas for protests against Nutting’s treatment of the team.
But what, other than trading away two very popular players and not pushing for a World Series title, has Nutting truly done to warrant being voted FanGraphs 4th worst owner in baseball? Is he really the horrible, penny-pinching thief that fans make him out to be, or is he doing his best to captain a ship that simply doesn’t have good enough sailors to win championships?
Let’s look first at what Nutting has done to advance the Pirates organization. He took control of the team in 2007, at the height of the team’s losing streak. Under his leadership, the Bucs revamped their farm system, upgraded Spring training facilities in Bradenton, constructed the Pirates training academy in the Dominican Republic, recruited new front-office management as well as a new manager in Clint Hurdle and, perhaps most importantly, led the team to three consecutive winning seasons for the first time since the 1990s.
Nutting was no doubt instrumental in making sure the entire Pirates organization didn’t crash while the team reconstructed itself into a playoff contender, and the three years of finishing a season with a playoff spot, no matter how much the Bucs might have ended up choking, is a major accomplishment.
Fans will not deny that Nutting was important to the Pirates to break out of the losing streak, but their gripe is in how the Pirates have failed to continue to compete at a high level after the 2015 season. In 2016, the Bucs went 78-83, and a similar 75-87 in 2017. Fans have argued that the Pirates front office did not make significant trades to help the Pirates continue to be strong competitors in the 2016 and 2017 season, and it showed in their record.
Let’s look at the money. Payroll is not the most effective indicator of how much money is being put into an MLB team, but changes year to year can reveal what’s going on behind the scenes more clearly. In 2012, the Pirates had the 26th lowest payroll in the MLB, at around $63.4 million.
This number makes sense. The Bucs won only 79 games and ended up 4th in the NL Central. In 2013, they increased their payroll by almost $20 million, up to around $79.5 million, and, although they showed a slight decrease in 2014, increased payroll steadily through 2017, up to $100 million (this opening day payroll still only sat them at 23rd in the league for amount spent on players).
In 2015, the Kansas City Royals won the World Series, the same year that the Bucs put up 98 wins and were knocked out in the wild-card game by the Chicago Cubs, with a payroll of $112 million. That year’s playoffs included teams like the Astros sitting at $63 million, and the Los Angeles Dodgers, with a massive payroll of $273 million. The Bucs, that year, came in around $84 million.
What this says immediately is that the Pirates didn’t need a payroll of Dodgers-like proportions to win the World Series. It means that the Bucs, after pushing payroll up to $100 million in 2017, were spending money on winning to the best of their ability. It’s more than likely that in years past, that Nutting has really been doing all that he could with the amount of money the Pirates earn from their small market.
Just how small is the Bucs’ market, though? A 2016 ranking of the “market rank” of MLB teams in the now-expired MLB collective bargaining agreement put the Pirates at 29th, ahead of only the Brewer in terms of “market rank.” That ranking, however, was created using a non-public formula and, per Evan Drellich of the Boston Herald, this market rank in the new CBA is based on the population, income, and the number of cable TV subscribers in each team’s market, as compared to the league average. However, Forbes places the Pirates at 13th highest in terms of MLB prime-time television ratings, which may tell folks that the Pirates have more money than they let on.
This year, however, has been an anomaly. After dropping Cole and Cutch, the Pirates sit at a surprisingly low $75 million in payroll, which comes in at 25th in the league. This wouldn’t be much of a problem if it was not for a few factors.
First, each of the 30 MLB teams is expected to receive approximately $50 million dollars because of the sale of BAMtech, a digital media company that spun off from MLB Advanced Media to Disney. This $50 million might be going into certain expenses that don’t make the public records, but there should certainly be some injection into the actual payroll of the team.
Second, the MLB Players Association (MLBPA) has expressed concern for how the Pirates are actually using their money. Along with the Miami Marlins, the MLBPA is suspicious that the Bucs aren’t using their slice of the revenue-sharing money they receive to help their team win, but instead, are using it to line Nutting’s wallet. The revenue sharing system was put in place to give smaller market teams, like the Pirates, a better shot at winning the World Series. Essentially, small market teams get a share of cash that big market teams make, so that there exists more parity in the league overall.
This suspicion has grown in recent weeks, culminating in the MLBPA filing a grievance against the Pirates, along with the Marlins, Tampa Bay Rays, and Oakland Athletics, claiming that the teams have “failed to comply with rules of how they spend their revenue sharing money,” as reported by the Tampa Bay Times. The Pirates have responded to the grievance, with Pirates president Frank Coonelly calling it “patently baseless.” Coonelly also explained that “our revenue sharing receipts are now just a fraction of what we spend on Major League payroll. We also have made significant investments in scouting, signing amateur players, our player development system, and our baseball facilities.” The Pirates have been much more focused on building up their infrastructure than simply throwing their money at older, more expensive free agents.
Third, Nutting’s company, Wheeling Newspapers, is reportedly bidding millions to purchase the Charleston Gazette-Mail, the largest newspaper in West Virginia. He also owns the Seven Springs Mountain Resort. Fans are suspicious that the money used to bid on the paper is coming directly from the decrease in payroll that came about after the Cole and McCutchen trades.
This issue of lack of faith in a team’s dedication to winning is not unique to the Pirates. Across the MLB, major league free agents are finding it more difficult to get signed to contracts. One major agent, Scott Boras, attributes the lack of signings in the offseason to a fear of losing money, and a desire to sit around and tank teams just to rebuild and try again in a few years. The Pirates, it seems, will have plenty of company as this season begins, and perhaps beyond, in what fans contend is a race to the bottom before the race to the top.

The Carnegie Mellon University Ballroom Dance Club is a community of dance lovers, a group of people of all different backgrounds, interests, and levels of dance ability that comes together to dance.
When first-year physics major Matias Jonsson came to campus last fall, he had never ballroom danced before and knew very little about it, beyond the fact that it existed. But, he saw many posters around campus about the club, and on a whim, decided to check it out. He never looked back.
“I saw signs everywhere [and] I was like, what the heck, why not?” Jonsson said in an interview with The Tartan. “I’ve never been good at moving or [being] graceful. I always run into stuff. [I thought] I’ll give it a try. Turns out I love it.”
When beginners first join the club, they practice with many other beginners as they learn the dance technique. Over time, dancers form partnerships that work best for them.
“Ballroom is all about partnership,” Jonsson said. “Midway through [the] semester, you figure out who you work well with. You improve more rapidly when you practice with [the] same person.”
There are four styles the club dances: International Standard and Latin and their American versions, Smooth and Rhythm. Beginners can try the different styles at the club’s lessons twice a week, which are open to the Pittsburgh area, while dancers on the competition team perform all four styles at competitions.
Jonsson is a big fan of Latin but appreciates the diversity of ballroom dance that he didn’t realize before he joined the club.
“You have a mental image of what ballroom dancing is, from the cliche waltz or tango, [but] there’s a style for every personality.”
If members want to dance competitively, they can join the club’s Competition Team, which competes around the country in 6-8 events each year with other collegiate ballroom dance teams. While the club counts up to 180 unique members who have attended at least one practice, the Competition Team has 60-70 people. This past weekend, the team competed at the annual Michigan Ballroom Dance Competition hosted by the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor, MI.
One of Jonsson’s favorite aspects of the club is the weekend trips they take around the country to different competitions. The constant time together and late nights have led to some great memories and helped to form lasting friendships in the club.
“Ballroom has a way of drawing people in,” Jonsson said. “There’s not one good reason not to do it. It’s a lot of fun.”
Elliott Toy, junior statistics and machine learning major and the club’s Competition Team Captain, has had a similar experience to Jonsson with ballroom dance. When he arrived at Carnegie Mellon,  he had no ballroom dance experience and didn’t know much about it.  
“I saw a flyer for [the club], I thought it looked really fun, but I went in with low expectations,” Toy said in an interview with The Tartan. “I saw it, I loved it, and kept coming back to rush events. I danced a lot, practiced a lot, probably spent more time on [it] than my [15-112] project.”
For Toy, the ballroom dance club has been an important part of his three years at Carnegie Mellon so far. It has been a community where he can take a step back from all the stress of being a student, and do something he loves to do with people who are equally passionate about it
“Ballroom is like my escape from a very stressful time at CMU between work, schoolwork, clubs, just life in general,” he said. “We are a bunch of people who are united with one purpose to become better dancers, and enjoy the art of dance.”
Toy is excited to see the team continue to compete in the coming year. One of the biggest competitions the team enters is the Arnold DanceSport Classic, held each spring in Columbus, Ohio. In the last three years, the team has improved from fourth place, to third place, and second place this past month.
“I’d like to see it grow. I’d like to see us win,” he said. “The people in [the] ballroom are very passionate about it. They join for various reasons, [but] once you get into it, everyone just loves to dance, loves the way it makes them feel. I love being part of the club because I get to be who I am. I’m most at home when I’m dancing.”

Women's Swimming & Diving
Carnegie Mellon University sophomore Emma Nicklas-Morris kicked off the 2018 NCAA Division III Swimming and Diving Championships for the women’s swimming and diving team on Wednesday, March 21, with a finish in the consolation finals of the 200-yard IM.
Nicklas-Morris placed 13th overall to earn four points for the Tartans after touching fifth in the heat in a time of 2:04.64. The top 16 finish marked the third of her career, as she was eighth in the 200-yard IM and fifth in the 400-yard IM last year.
Competition continues on Thursday with the 200-yard freestyle relay, 400-yard IM, 100-yard butterfly, 200-yard freestyle, and 400-yard medley relay. Preliminaries are set for 10 a.m. with finals to start at 6 p.m.
On Thursday, the women’s swimming and diving team continued to earn points when competitors finished in the top 16 in two events.
Nicklas-Morris earned the third All-America honor of her career by finishing seventh in the 400-yard IM when she touched the wall in 4:24.82 Thursday night. It marked the second straight year Nicklas-Morris finished in the top eight of the 400-yard IM and follows her 13th-place finish last night in the 200-yard IM.
Later in the evening, Nicklas-Morris anchored the 400-yard medley relay that finished 13th in 3:48.90. Joining Nicklas-Morris on the relay that earned the third All-America Honorable Mention honor in the event in program history was sophomore Mary Day, senior Kim Hochstedler, and first-year Jessica Li.
The Tartans continued to earn awards on Friday when two swimmers landed a spot in the consolation finals.
Hochstedler and Nicklas-Morris each finished 16th in their respective races Friday night. Hochstedler touched the wall in 1:04.85 in the 100-yard breaststroke, while Nicklas-Morris finished her run in individual events by touching the final wall of the 200-yard butterfly in 1:04.97. The finish for Nicklas-Morris was her third All-America Honorable Mention performance of the meet.
The women’s swimming and diving team finished its run at the 2018 NCAA Division III Swimming and Diving Championships with two Tartans swimming in the finals Saturday night. Their results helped the team finish 15th, recording the best national finish in school history.
Hochstedler closed her career with a school-record finish in the 200-yard breaststroke including a fifth-place showing and her first All-America honor. In the championship final, Hochstedler touched the final wall in 2:16.97, knocking more than a second off her previous school record set last year. The senior ends her career with tonight’s All-America honor and three additional All-America Honorable Mention awards, including two achieved at this year’s championship.
First-year Jessica Chau finished her first NCAA meet with a 13th-place showing in the 200-yard backstroke when she touched in 2:02.07. Chau becomes just the second Tartan to earn an All-America honor in the 200-yard backstroke, as she pulled in All-America Honorable Mention honors with her finish.
Men's Swimming & Diving
Carnegie Mellon University junior Gabe Bamforth opened the 2018 NCAA Division III Swimming and Diving Championships for the men’s swimming and diving team on Wednesday with a finish in the consolation finals of 3-meter diving.
Bamforth placed 13th overall to earn four points for the Tartans after collecting 457.55 points. The top 16 finish marked the third of his career, as he was 16th in the 3-meter as a first-year and eighth in the 1-meter as a sophomore.
On Friday, Bamforth finished eighth on the 1-meter diving board to earn additional points for the Tartans men’s swimming and diving team.
Bamforth earned placement in the finals of the 1-meter by scoring 464.95 points during the preliminaries. In the championship finals, the junior tallied 433.65 points and finished eighth for the second year running.

A pedestrian who was walking her bicycle across the road died after being struck by a self-driving Uber SUV in autonomous mode in Tempe, Arizona on March 18, at about 10 p.m. local time. The victim, Elaine Herzberg, was rushed to the hospital where she died as a result of her injuries.
Following this incident, Uber has paused on-road testing at other locations including Arizona, Pittsburgh, San Francisco and Toronto. 
This crash comes right after the reports of a crash between an Uber self-driving car with another car in Pittsburgh, on Feb. 24, where no one was hurt, but both cars suffered some damage.
According to experts, this crash not only shows the failure of Uber’s self-driving vehicle technology but also of its backup plans — the human test driver in the car, who should have been paying attention and be able to react to the pedestrian even when the car wasn’t able to.
In a video released by Tempe police, the exterior camera reveals that the victim had crossed at least one lane on the road, and seems to appear out of a dark, shadowy area through which visibility to the human eye is admittedly limited. However, the interior camera reveals that the test driver — who is supposed to be paying attention to the car at all times — was looking down at something on their lap. Just seconds before the crash, the driver looks up and realizes their negligence.
Uber’s self-driving cars use three systems to provide a 360 degree view of the car’s surroundings — the radar sensors, the LIDAR and the forward camera array. In this situation, with dry weather and assuming all sensors were working perfectly, the primary detecting sensor mechanism should have been the LIDAR — which essentially uses lasers to locate obstacles in the car’s path. 
Missy Cummings, an engineering professor and director of the Humans and Autonomy Laboratory at Duke University explains in a video released by CNN, “The darkness, the shadows — these should not have any effect on the LIDAR’s ability to pick out an obstacle in this field [of view].” The car in the accident, which was in autonomous mode didn’t seem to slow down or change paths, which means that it didn’t register the person at all or decided that she wasn’t an obstacle.
In fact, more recently Uber’s internal company documents, obtained by The New York Times, suggest that Uber has significant ground to cover to meet its opponents’ progress. While Uber’s cars have been struggling to meet its target of covering an average of 13 miles before human intervention, Uber’s rival Waymo cars — Google’s self-driving car giant — can reportedly cover an average of 5600 miles before needing human intervention.
Uber has recently been the recipient of much bad publicity. After public outcry over Uber’s company culture — that was hostile to women and exploited and underpaid workers — Uber was forced to change leadership. Then, Waymo sued Uber over charges of intellectual theft. 
Clearly, for a company that spends so much of its time in bad light, something is to be said about the culture of work at Uber and the kind of example that they set for a company that is supposedly “leading” the future for a future of self-driving cars.

Astronomers believe that some of the Earth-sized planets orbiting the star TRAPPIST-1 may be partially made of water. Though researchers usually point to planets with water as likely places to find life, the TRAPPIST-1 planets may actually have too much water to sustain life — more than 250 times as much water as Earth.
The seven confirmed planets orbiting TRAPPIST-1 have generated excitement since their discovery in 2016 for a number of reasons. They’re the same size as Earth; it’s relatively rare to find planets the same size as ours, and even rarer to find so many in the same place. With seven planets, TRAPPIST-1 is tied in second place for the star with the highest number of confirmed exoplanets.  Of the seven planets, three exist in the habitable zone: the band of the solar system that’s the right distance from the star for water be liquid. The habitable zone is also called the Goldilocks zone because it is neither too hot nor too cold.
Astronomers are always on the lookout for planets with water because liquid water is usually considered a prerequisite for the development of life (at least, life as we know it). Liquids are essential to life because they carry dissolved substances, like nutrients, from place to place, both within an organism’s body and throughout an entire ecosystem; the flux of nutrients and minerals is crucial to most biochemical processes.
But why water specifically? 
While many planetary scientists speculate that alien life could arise from other liquids, like the lakes of liquid methane on Saturn’s moon Titan, water has special properties that make it stand out among liquids. For one thing, “water is probably the best solvent in the universe,” says Jeffrey Bada, a planetary scientist at the Scripps Institution of Oceanography in California. “Everything is soluble in water to some degree.” 
This means that water can carry around a much wider range of dissolved substances than most other liquids. 
Water also remains liquid at a very wide range of temperatures: typically, from 32 degrees Fahrenheit to 212 degrees Fahrenheit. However, salt water can remain liquid at temperatures as low as minus 50 degrees Fahrenheit, and with added pressure, at temperatures as high as 650 degrees Fahrenheit (as in the hydrothermal vents at the bottom of the ocean). Water has a high “specific heat,” meaning that a lot of energy is required to raise its temperature. Liquid water’s stability under many different conditions means the systems that depend on it can be more stable: the day-to-day temperature variations of a planet won’t freeze or boil its water away.
The search for water on the TRAPPIST-1 planets began as soon as three of the planets were discovered to be in the habitable zone. But looking for water on planets almost 40 light-years away is incredibly difficult. 
A spacecraft would take hundreds of thousands of years to reach the star system, and our current telescopes aren’t powerful enough to detect any information beyond the planets’ approximate sizes.
Astronomers have to use very indirect methods to make educated guesses about what these distant planets are made of. 
Astronomers have estimates of the sizes of the planets, based on how much light they block out when they cross in front of their star. Researchers worked from these size estimates to try to figure out the density of the planets, combined with analyses of the planets’ orbits to determine their mass. When the planets pass each other in their orbits around their star, their gravitational fields pull on each other slightly — something that astronomers can observe because it affects the timing of each planet’s orbit. Researchers from the University of Bern simulated the orbits they saw, gravitational pulling included, and used the simulation to estimate the planets’ masses. In this many-step process, the combined mass and size estimates finally allowed them to find reasonable estimates of the planets’ densities. “I worked almost a year on this project until everything worked,” explained University of Bern researcher Simon Grimm. 
“We now know more about TRAPPIST-1 than any other planetary system apart from our own,” said Sean Carey, manager of the Spitzer Science Center at Caltech in Pasadena, California. “Improved densities...dramatically refine our understanding of the nature of these mysterious worlds.”
The density estimations suggest that the planets aren’t dense enough to only be made of rock and metal. There must be something else present — and the researchers say that the “something else” is water. For the planets farthest from the star, this could suggest a thick layer of ice covering the planet’s surface. For the planets in the habitable zone, the researchers claim, this means that they have liquid water — possibly even more water than Earth. 
According to Cayman Unterborn, an exogeologist at Arizona State University, the planet TRAPPIST-1 might have an ocean of liquid water 200 kilometers deep (200 times deeper than the Mariana Trench) on top of a layer of ice that could be as thick as 2,300 kilometers.
More liquid water doesn’t necessarily mean a higher probability of finding life. The thick shell of ice and water could interfere with geological systems that regulate the planet’s climate, making conditions too unstable for life. In addition, having a surface that’s all water and no land could slow or prevent the circulation of “building blocks” for life, like carbon and phosphorus.
“We typically think having liquid water on a planet as a way to start life, since life, as we know it on Earth, is composed mostly of water and requires it to live,” explains Natalie Hinkel of Vanderbilt University, an author on the most recent density study. 
“However, a planet that is a water world, or one that doesn’t have any surface above the water, does not have the important geochemical or elemental cycles that are absolutely necessary for life.”
It’s difficult to know for certain, because “the vast majority of data that’s out there is for one planet, and it’s ours,” says Unterborn. The TRAPPIST-1 system is “such an extreme of rocky planet chemistry.”
Astronomers hope that more precise data about the TRAPPIST-1 planets and their compositions will be available in the near future, once NASA’s James Webb Space Telescope (the most powerful space telescope ever built) launches in 2019. “If these planets have atmospheres, the James Webb Space Telescope will be the key to unlocking their secrets,” said Doug Hudgins, Exoplanet Program Scientist at NASA Headquarters in Washington D.C. More data on the TRAPPIST-1 planets will let astronomers construct more precise estimates of their compositions, and reassess the probability that they might be able to support life. 
For now, astronomers and planetary scientists are continuing to refine their educated guesses so that new speculations will be based on more accurate estimates.

Kids are starting to picture scientists as women
A review of children’s drawings of scientists over the past 52 years suggests that more North American children are imagining scientists as women.
Researchers led by David Miller, a Ph.D. candidate at Northwestern University, combed through 78 “draw-a-scientist” studies, in which U.S. and Canadian students of varying ages were simply asked to draw a scientist.
The percentage of women in the drawings increased over time. In the first study, conducted from 1966 to 1977, only 0.6 percent (28 out of almost 5,000) of the scientist drawings depicted women. In the most recent study, the figure was 28 percent.
“A lot has changed since the 1960s,” says Miller, “More women are becoming scientists, and there’s some evidence that female scientists are being represented more in the media.”
However, even in the most recent studies, the percentage of women in the scientist drawings decreases as the students go through puberty, most strikingly in girls — from 70 percent of girls drawing women at age six to only 25 percent at age 16.“This is a critical period in which kids are learning stereotypes,” Miller says. “It’s important that teachers and parents present diverse examples of both male and female scientists.”

Controversial study suggests early birds may have been too hefty to sit on their eggs
A new analysis of ancient bird fossils suggests that these early birds may have been too heavy to incubate their eggs by sitting on them. However, the study has attracted much criticism in the paleontology world.
Paleontologists from the University of Lincoln examined egg fossils from 21 species of prehistoric birds to estimate the eggs’ size and how much weight they would be able to bear. For every species they examined, they concluded that the eggs would not have been able to support the weight of an adult.
Not everyone agrees with the analysis. The research is being challenged by scientists who believe that some species of dinosaurs unrelated to birds incubated their eggs by sitting on them, which would invalidate the hypothesis that egg-sitting evolved 100 million years ago. However, the evidence for this hypothesis — for example, fossils — is debated.
Luis Chiappe, director of the Dinosaur Institute at the Natural History Museum of Los Angeles County, challenges the study because it suggests that early birds nested on the ground. Enantiornithines, one of three groups of primitive birds examined in the study, nested in trees, claims Chiappe. “If you live in a tree, most likely you nest in a tree. And, if you nest in a tree, I don’t see how these eggs could have been incubated if it’s not by contact with a parent.”
Other paleontologists, even those who believe the study’s conclusion makes sense, acknowledge that it relied on assumptions made from unknown factors, such as the exact shape of the eggs.

Fungus found in NASA's clean room
At NASA’s Johnson Space Center (JSC) in Houston, Texas, the clean room storing meteorite samples is contaminated with fungus.
Clean rooms are used to remove any signs of terrestrial life from departing spacecraft to avoid terrestrial life’s interference with samples to and from outer space. They are intended to be sterile, uncontaminated spaces that are often used to store immaculate samples from space, and are challenging to maintain simply because of the high standard of cleanliness required in such a space.
The room has been found to be contaminated with traces of terrestrial fungus of the genus Penicillium. The microbes could potentially interfere with the samples that the lab is planning to receive from Mars and the carbon-rich asteroid Bennu, according to Science.
However, the contaminated room wasn’t supposed to be the cleanest of all rooms possible. The clean rooms range from class 1 to class 9, with class 1 being the cleanest. This room was supposed to be a class 6. 
But according to Aaron Regberg, a geomicrobiologist at JSC, who presented the report at the 2018 Lunar and Planetary Science Conference in The Woodlands, Texas, this doesn’t mean that researchers at these facilities become lax about such procedures. As quoted in an article by Science, Marc Fries, a spectroscopist who curates the cosmic dust collection at JSC but wasn’t involved in the work said “I’d characterize it as eye-opening...It drives home this point that fungi are an important part of microbial contamination.”

Wildlife workers try to save Ethiopian wolves using vaccines
Ethiopian wolves, found in the Bale Mountains of southeast Ethiopia, are the rarest and most endangered canine in the world. Researchers are trying to make sure they don’t die out by vaccinating them.
There are less than 500 Ethiopian wolves in the wild, and are under the constant threat by attacks of rabies, canine distemper and habitat reduction. According to the Wildlife Conservation Network, these wolves come into contact with domestic dogs that pass on the diseases to them, which ultimately kills three out of four wolves that it affects. Major outbreaks of disease affect the populations devastatingly, often cutting them down to 75 percent of their original size. 
Eric Bedin and his field monitoring team often travel up in these mountains in conservation efforts to prevent the spread of diseases among these wolves. They travel on horseback and on foot, braving harsh and unpredictable weather, to study these wolves. 
Now, their next project is to leave chunks of goat meat which would have the oral vaccine in them, scattered around these mountains, to increase the wolves’ immunity against rabies.
While this project seems to be well-intentioned, one of the biggest criticisms of introducing vaccines to ecosystems is the advantage it would give some predators over the others or instead, having the opposite effect — making the vaccinated animals more vulnerable to the disease once the immunity wears off. In fact, vaccination is a strategy used only when the species are on the brink of extinction — like these Ethiopian wolves.

Being able to go abroad and explore places outside of your home is an experience like no other. During my experiences traveling abroad, I was always reminded of how similar people are across cultures. I find it so fascinating to see how much I have in common with people who come from cultures and backgrounds very different from my own. My most recent trip abroad took me to Doha, Qatar as a part of the Initiating Meaningful Pittsburgh and Qatar Ties (IMPAQT) program, which focuses on strengthening the relationship between Carnegie Mellon’s campuses in Qatar and Pittsburgh. It was during my experience on this trip that I had the opportunity to learn of cross-cultural similarities between people in general and university communities in particular.
Carnegie Mellon’s campus in Doha is truly a beautiful sight to see. Although the campus is smaller, the facilities, community, and environment still proudly represent the Tartan culture, just from a different side of the world. You’ll find enormous prints of the university’s logo on the building, as well as the university motto “My heart is in the work” in very large letters etched onto a wall. The campus is located in Education City, which is an area that houses a strip of Western colleges; some other colleges include Georgetown University, Northwestern University, and Cornell University. Our Doha campus is essentially comprised of one large building, however everything about it is so nice.
One of my favorite areas on their campus was the common area, which is surely not hard to miss. Known as the majlis, it’s a space where students usually hang out and hold large assemblies. A majlis is a common meeting space for people in Middle Eastern culture, decorated with soft cushions decorated with traditional patterns. Pillows and carpets with mixed colors of rose, dark orange, and yellow were found on our campus’ majlis. It was amazing to see this area was used during large university events, where most of the students and faculty would gather together and closely sit next to one another. You could easily feel the strong sense of community in this space, mainly because you’d see how everyone from the campus would interact with one another. Because of the small size of the campus, teachers and students who’ve come from various regions of the Middle East and many other parts of the world know each other very well, and were seen discussing their passions and sharing wisdom with one another. Even though the Qatar campus may be smaller than the main campus in Pittsburgh, you can still find many people there confidently sharing their passions with others. Sitting in on these conversations at the Doha campus easily helped me feel at home. 
Other than making connections with people from the general CMU-Qatar campus community, I was most especially able to create close friendships with my IMPAQT team members. I loved getting to know everyone in both IMPAQT groups from the Pittsburgh and Doha campuses. I was able to learn so much from bonding with the members of IMPAQT, whether it was through singing Karaoke at K-Box in Pittsburgh to dune-bashing in the Middle Eastern deserts. I learned about the different ways in which we all have shared our passions and contributed to the overall Carnegie Mellon community. Some of us share their wisdom and educate others in the community through public art pieces and performances. Others are members of student groups and organizations such as student government, the Greek community, and the residential life community, where they are able to interact with other students on campus as leaders and mentors. We all have played very different roles on the Carnegie Mellon campus, and it was fascinating to see how similar all our goals were in enhancing the student experience and encouraging others to make the most out of their time at Carnegie Mellon. Of the many things I learned during my trip to Doha, this was certainly my biggest takeaway. I highly encourage anyone who is interested to apply for the IMPAQT program next year and experience Carnegie Mellon from another part of the world.

Greek Sing is a philanthropic event where CMU's Greek organizations perform 15 minute musicals written by their students. Previously partnering with various philanthropies and programs, this year's Greek Sing was a continuation of their two-year commit to fundraising for Camp Kesem, a charity program that “operates free summer camps for children who have been impacted by a parent’s cancer.”  Hosted at various colleges and universities nationwide, many of our own students here at Carnegie Mellon have close ties with the program, raising money and working as camp counselors and organizers over the summer. Last year, Greek Sing established a partnership with Camp Kesem to raise $150,000 over two years. Not only did they meet this goal, but with this year’s overall total of $112,598.26, they blew past it, raising a grand total of $213,120.79 since 2016.
The show kicked off with hosts senior and economics major Domenico Barbieri, junior drama student Krissy Bylancik, junior biological sciences major Mason Miles, and junior mechanical engineering major Amber Paige, introducing each of the organizations with the help of Infra Dance Company in a lively parody of “Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious.” After their opening remarks, the sororities and frats began their 15 minute productions.
Act one started off with Alpha Tau Omega’s Newsies. Seeing their performance, it was obvious to see why they won first in the singles division. Fun and energetic, the boys of Alpha Tau Omega perfectly portrayed the poor “newsies,” or roaming newspaper street vendors, of New York, complete with newspaper choreography and a wonderful New York City skyline. Junior chemical engineering major Grant Seastream shone as the lead character Jack, surprising the audience with a tap solo and his confident voice.
Next up was the first doubles show in the event, Alice in Wonderland with Delta Gamma and Sigma Phi Epsilon. Starring electrical and computer engineering major and senior Tara Stentz as Alice, the show was a wonderful nod to the eclectic and whimsical nature of the original story. Featuring characters such as duo Tweedledee and Tweedledum, the ever-late White Rabbit, the commanding Queen of Hearts, and the enigmatic Blue Caterpillar, the show was dynamic and vastly entertaining. With this performance, Delta Gamma and Sigma Phi Epsilon put a strong foot forward in the doubles division, showcasing their wonderful collaboration. Their hard work paid off, and they placed third overall.
The next performance continued the singles division with a unique and entertaining interpretation of The Last Airbender. Complete with spray bottle water-bending, tissue-paper fire, and endless 420 puns, the boys of Lambda Phi Epsilon kept the audience laughing. They adapted all three seasons of Nickelodeon’s animated show Avatar: The Last Airbender to create a 13-minute version of the Avatar’s journey to defeat the leader of the fire nation, which is an impressive feat in itself. By far the most interesting part of their show was the usage of step dancing as fight choreography. Clever and cool, the two sides engaged in an energetic step-dance battle for victory. The Last Airbender placed second in the singles division.
Finishing off both the first act and the singles division was Sigma Alpha Epsilon’s original show The Cardfather. Following a similar vein to last year’s Rata-tool-y, the story followed a playing card – and his companion, who is cleverly named Vanilla Ace - who was separated from his love Nina by a disastrous game of 52 pickup, and his journey to get her back. Always filled with jokes and Carnegie Mellon references, Sigma Alpha Epsilon’s creative show landed them in third place.
Act two began with the second doubles performance of the night, Grease. Delta Delta Delta and Pi Kappa Alpha – who go together like shoo-bop sha wadda wadda yippity boom de boom - showed us the true spirit of Greek Sing with their wonderful collaboration. Their 13-minute version of Grease was a well-done nod to its originals - the movie and the Broadway productions, bringing the fun energy of the 1950s to life. Their talented leads, music major and sophomore Gabriel Garcia and junior mechanical engineering and public policy double major Elizabeth Elrod, and supporting characters all came together to create an entertaining and impressive show, rightfully earning them second place in the doubles division.
Kappa Alpha Theta and Delta Tau Delta’s Catch Me if You Can was full of inventive choreography and dynamic characters. Each actor and actress was clearly enjoying the performance all the way through, having fun while putting on a great show. With fun costumes and a flexible set, the two organizations created the world of the show and fluidly changed scenes. It was cohesive, creative, and incredibly entertaining. While they didn’t place, Kappa Alpha Theta and Delta Tau Delta successfully adapted the Broadway musical and made it their own. 
Next up was Kappa Kappa Gamma and Phi Delta Theta with their inventive version of Pippin. Sophomore chemical engineering major Izzy Vendetti as the Leading Player drew the audience in with her enigmatic performance, literally taking control of the stage and at times commanding the crew and musicians. Vocal performance major and senior Jacqueline Tardanico was sweet as the main character Pippin, her voice strong and confident. Their set — a series of movable boxes and part of a giant tent — served its purpose and set the stage for the production. Incredibly different from the other shows in both the costumes, set, and show itself, Kappa Kappa Gamma and Phi Delta Theta’s Pippin was incredibly exciting.
Going from a show within a show to the deep jungle, next was Alpha Phi and Alpha Sigma Phi’s The Jungle Book. Soloist and freshman engineering student Brenna Pellon shone as main character Mowgli, with her bright and energetic nature bringing the character to life. Senior vocal performance major Maddy Marquis captivated the audience with her performance as the hypnotizing snake Kaa, as did sophomore statistics major Abby Pfingsten with her performance as Queen Louie of the jungle. It was a fun version of the original movie, complete with iconic songs such as “I Wanna Be Like You” and “Bare Necessities.”
From one jungle to another, alpha Kappa Delta Phi and Sigma Chi’s Tarzan was a crowd favorite. Utilizing famous songs from the original Disney movie and ingeniously resourceful costumes, Tarzan was a heartwarming tribute to the original. Each of the soloists – from the mother, played by sophomore psychology major Se Eun Park; to Jane, played by freshman Dietrich student Sophia Lee; to Tarzan himself, played by senior physics major Paul Rogozenski — had a wonderful voice and brought their characters to life. The two organizations rightfully won the Kid’s Choice Award with their high-spirited and vibrant show.
Coming in first place was Gotham Side Story. An original adaptation of West Side Story, Alpha Chi Omega and Alpha Epsilon Phi created a hilarious parody based on the heroes and villains of the DC Universe. Following the general plot of West Side Story, the show was centered on superhero-newbie Cathy (later dubbed “Fantastic Girl” by the Orb of Random Adjectives) and almost-retired villain Punchline. The two developed a budding romance despite their warring associations, eventually leading the heroes and villains to give each other a chance. Hilarious and a little bit heartbreaking, the show was an excellent parody and a true testament to the spirit of Greek Sing.
This year’s Greek Sing was a wonderful way to celebrate philanthropy. Featuring a meet and greet with Camp Kesem campers, it was easy to see how important and touched the members of Greek Sing were. The show brought together Carnegie Mellon’s Greek organizations to put on a brilliant show and brought the Carnegie Mellon community together to raise money for deeply valuable program. The Greek organizations on campus continued to blow us away with their dedication, motivation, and creativity.

The crowd is bustling around me with an excited energy to witness opening night of the 12th International Film Festival at Carnegie Mellon: Faces of Inequality. Being that this topic is very relevant to our lives today, it drew in a large crowd. The film being featured on this opening night is Life And Nothing More by Antonio Méndez Esparza. I sit on the left side of the auditorium in the middle. “Sorry, are you waiting for people here?” a woman in a black jacket and light colored jeans asked, gesturing to the seat next to me. “No,” I replied with a smile. As soon as we are settled into our seats, the lights go dim and the screen turns on. The opening of the show is entertaining, as we watch students walking about backstage to interview live, those who are crewing the event. They eventually make their way to the front of the auditorium and introduce the founder and director of the event, Jolanta Lion. After her, we meet the man behind the film, director Antonio Méndez Esparza. A man of few words, he states, “I hope you will find them [the actors] as wonderful as I do.” The film focuses on a young 14-year-old boy named Andrew, his single mother Regina, his sister Ry’Nesia and a love interest named Robert. Throughout the film it comes to our attention that Andrew’s father is in jail and Robert’s appearance as a love interest impacts Andrew to a high degree. He struggles with adolescence, growing up and dealing with various pressures from every angle of his life. The film particularly emphasizes the challenges of life and themes of “race, inequality, gender and class.” After reading the synopsis, the show begins. 
One of the opening lines is “Life is based on the decisions you make.” A particularly haunting statement that sticks with me because of its honesty. The cinematography is such a beautiful, accurate depiction of life. It doesn’t feel like you’re watching actors trying to “be realistic.” It is a film of pure reality. Esparza selected nonprofessional actors for this reason. 
One aspect that makes this film so incredibly realistic are the silent scenes. One that resonates for me is a close up on Andrew’s face. He is thinking. The background is dark and the only thing visible on the screen is his neck and face. He is simply breathing and thinking. The aspect of the scene that makes it so realistic, is that this detail of our daily lives is consistently looked over. Throughout my time watching films, I have never witnessed a scene with such an attention to detail. This type of silent scene is repeated throughout the movie with various characters. For example, it comes up again when Regina is attempting to fall asleep at night. This tactic of cinematography appears to be used as a method of getting to peek into someone’s personal life.  
Another aspect of realism in the film is its approach to race. “Are you free, dead, or in jail?” a professor questions his students, Andrew being one of them. This idea of race plays a significant role throughout the film as it arises in many of the scenarios that Andrew encounters. For example, when he gets confronted by a Caucasian family in a park, they tell him to leave because he is not supposed to be there. The mother and father describe how they are uncomfortable with his presence. The reality of this occurring is all too real. This scene in particular is holding a mirror to reality and asking the audience to question our own lives and the preconceived judgments of others. 
The crowd erupts into applause as the first credits scroll onto the screen. The truthful, honest and heart-wrenching movie has gotten everyone thinking, which is good because Esparza comes out to answer all of our pressing questions regarding the film. His inspiration for the film was his own life. His wife had originally been a single mother until they got married. Esparza wanted to “try to understand a mom in a different perspective.” For this, he explains that going to his community and listening to the people, would be his first step. He was able to capture the main themes of the film including racial oppression in an episodic nature. “I’m always searching for that moment that is truth,” says Esparza. These episodes of life are different than other films which typically have a carefully agreed upon script that is followed closely. His aim was to capture reality. He quoted that he “didn’t want to try to fantasize reality.” His reason for the creation of the film? To try and understand a part of himself through another lens. His hope? To make a film that changes perspectives and challenges the audience. Which is exactly what I believe he did.

Mindy McGinnis’ The Female of the Species is a very different novel. Among McGinnis’ previous works, it was the young adult novel author’s first foray into contemporary and realistic fiction, contrasting with her previous thrillers and her dystopian duo-logy Not a Drop to Drink. Whereas her previous stories seemed to deal more with a young girl dealing with the dangers of the world around her and her mistrust towards it, The Female of the Species focuses on a young girl’s struggle with her own self. It is heavily introspective, speculative, dark, and radically ahead of its time. Initially published on Sept. 21, 2016, a little more than a whole year before the Harvey Wenstein scandal that would kickstart the #MeToo era and ignite the start of the #TimesUp movement amidst the #MeToo era, The Female of the Species is beautifully written and is an essential reading in today’s political climate.
The Female of the Species focuses on Alex Craft, whose older sister Anna was raped, killed and mutilated three years prior to the beginning of the story. However, when Anna’s killer was acquitted, Alex took matters into her own hands and killed him herself — but was never caught by authorities. As she lives out her senior year, Alex knows that she cannot trust herself around other people. But through meeting Jack, the star athlete, and Peekay, the preacher’s kid who volunteers at the animal shelter with her, Alex slowly starts to open up and unravel as her guilt challenges her mindset and her darker nature threatens to break out.  
The Female of the Species may sound simple, but it is so much more complex and layered and has a lot to say. It is brutal, raw, and honest about its portrayal of high school culture and rape culture. It doesn’t hold back on its candid remarks and portrayal on how high school women are lauded for their bodies more than their personality, acting as a powerful commentary on widespread misogyny that starts at the roots of one’s upbringing.  It is almost written like a satire, except that McGinnis’ small town and smaller high school feels frighteningly and grippingly real. While The Female of the Species is set in Ohio, McGinnis makes the book’s location feel universal, driving home the fact of how devastatingly common Anna’s situation could really become without change.
Alex Craft is masterfully written, with each chapter written perfectly and truly allowing readers to explore her thoughts, reasoning, and dark nature.  Each chapter charts her growth in a realistic manner and fashion, with each one standing out and showcasing McGinnis’ masterful writing style. McGinnis crafts Alex as morally grey yet also as the most painstaking realistic character I have connected with in a long time; she has a purpose to her standoffish personality, but when she opens up thanks to Jack and Peekay, she truly touches the lives of the people who matter to her and accept that side of her. She is also a victim of her sister’s murder, and hides how much she truly is struggling until it boils over into her actions. She is a strong female character who refuses to stay silent about her school and town’s troubling rape culture, and her inner strength and courage commands respect throughout the novel.
Jack Fisher and Peekay are also amazingly written windows into the world that McGinnis has created, both not only helping Alex Craft to open up and integrate herself within her high school peers but also to give a bystander’s perspective into the novels thrilling events. Just due to stereotypes alone, golden boy and star athlete Jack Fisher could have been a flat, uninteresting character who simply checked off the boxes of what a love interest should do and be. Instead, McGinnis fleshes Jack out into a boy consumed by guilt for his immaturity who just desperately wants to leave his hometown, and step out of that “golden boy” image that his town and high school peers have painted on him and lauded him for to be something more. Overall, he is oddly fascinating and thankfully charming to read about, adding a different angle and male perspective to McGinnis’ story — and thus, possibly a different layer of recognition and understanding.
Peekay, or “preacher’s kid,” is also a refreshing departure from typical stereotypes. Her best friend is a lesbian, and she comes from an understanding and loving family that is God-fearing yet understanding of town and high school culture — and all her family members support Peekay throughout the novel as she learns more about the high school community and progresses and grows amidst a presence of rape culture that’s becoming harder to ignore. She is empathetic and provides an interesting foil to Alex Craft, becoming the first person to see Alex as more than just “the sister of the dead girl” and helping her to branch out a little more in her community by becoming her first true friend. 
Cited on the back cover of McGinnis’ novel, Rudyard Kipling’s quote “*The Female of the Species* is more deadly than the male” is a prevailing force over the novel. It shows a variety of female characters alongside Alex and Peekay who all provide different perspectives on rape culture and misogyny, but all of whom contribute to the takedown of rape culture in their society. Perhaps one of the most beautiful things about the novel is the strong network of female friendships that exist and prevail throughout amidst the catty high school climate of the novel and who come together in the conclusion of the novel in a concentrated effort to dismantle their school’s rape culture and create a better environment of gender equality.  It is a scene that very much echoes the novel’s future and our present, amidst the #MeToo movement and a heartening rise in student activism, taking on a political charge without meaning to but making it even more important.
Also touching on broader themes such as life and death, love, and femininity, McGinnis’ startling commentary on rape culture tops a list of contemporary novels from this century that should serve as required reading for not just high schools, but for our generation.  The Female of the Species is a symbol of the future. It is a glimpse of our world two years ago and a reminder of what was and what never should be, again.

Dear Izzy,
Somehow, I’ve made a lot of friends who are seniors. I really don’t know how this happened. But after this semester, there’s a huge possibility that I’m never going to see any of them again — and that terrifies me.
It wouldn’t terrify me if I was okay with keeping in touch with people after they graduate, except I’m not. And even now, sometimes I feel like I’m slipping away from my senior friends' lives because they’re all preparing for future jobs, applying to grad schools in their hometown, or just getting  ready to leave Carnegie Mellon in general — and in comparison, I’m not even halfway done with my undergraduate career yet. It’s just that they’ve helped me to get me through so, so much this year, in every sense of the way, and I have no idea what school will be like in the future without them. I just really want these people to be with me for the rest of my life, because of what they’ve done for me and how they’ve helped me grow. I’m afraid I’ll end up losing them forever, because I might gradually stop texting them every day, or they’ll stop texting me and forget about me. Or, what if I forget to call them at some points, and just resort to being bad at keeping in touch and therefore sequentially lose all my friends and then go back to square one...again. Can you help?
Feeling Really Existential Since Half My Amigos Notably (Are Going Away Indefinitely Now)
Dear FRESHMAN (AGAIN), 
Change is hard, but you’re not the only one experiencing it in this kind of situation. On the other side, a phase of your friends’ life is ending, and a new one is beginning.  I don’t want to discredit your problems, but I want to remind you that they’re going through a lot too. Remind yourself of that in the future, when you miss them. Because, they will miss you too, possibly in the exact same moment. Text them or try to hang out online during certain times, because your presence and correspondence will bring them joy when they’re struggling. Never, ever feel like you’re bothering them or that they’re tired of you because if they’re truly your friends they will never be.
More importantly, don’t think of the future just yet. You still have eight more weeks with your best buds, and you should truly cherish all that time you have with them. Spend less time worrying about the future and embrace your present, making newer and possibly stronger memories with them than you have in the past year. Dwelling on negativity could possibly dampen all your memories with them due to the thought that they’re leaving; rather, nurture those memories so that you can go back to them when you’re going through rough times yourself.  You can even express these creatively, so you have a beautiful visual reminder of these people who have changed your life.
I can’t deny that these last few weeks will be hard while you're balancing cherishing all your time with them and mentally preparing yourself for a college future without them.  But, don’t put yourself in a box filled with fear and sadness. Turn it into something positive, and fill your future with excitement by the prospect of their return trips and even more exciting adventures.
Love,
Izzy

This week, I decided to stay on the 61B well past my usual eating exit (Forbes and Murray) and found myself just past Frick Park at Square Cafe. It’s a very whimsical place with a bright blue wall and a menu big enough to match its over the top appearance. 
The location: Located just a few minutes past Frick Park, Square Cafe is the perfect place for a quick brunch or even a drink before a stroll in the park, and it’s easily accessible by the 61B. This makes it close enough to be within reach on a Sunday morning and the direct bus route makes getting there even easier. I am all about places that I can take one bus to and not a Lyft, so that instantly gave this place some bonus points that the other places I’ve visited didn’t quite have.
The vibe: The restaurant itself is pretty small, but I’ve just accepted that this is a fact of Pittsburgh. The mood inside is very light and playful and almost gives off little kid playroom vibes. It’s definitely not the all white, upscale, millennial scene with mimosas that comes to mind when you hear the word brunch. It’s a nice refreshing breath of air from the typical scenery.
The food: This place comes equipped with a pretty long drink menu with a lot of very creative drinks, although it is also a cafe. One that stood out to me was their Smokin Mocha which came with all the regular mocha ingredients but also included cayenne. My whole family is from New Orleans, and I’ve literally been eating cajun food since before I had teeth, so naturally, I am a lover of all things spicy. This drink was more of a spice you felt in the back of your throat as an afterthought instead of an all over mouth feel, but I still enjoyed the extra little spice. There was also a milkshake with potato chips at the time I went that I have not been able to find on the menu since so it could have been a special that they quickly realized was a mistake. Don’t get me wrong, I am all about the whimsical foods and drinks, but if you’re going to do it then it has to be good and this was not. It tasted like they blended in Cheetos instead of potato chips and left quite the unpleasant aftertaste.
Now finally on to the food. It was okay. This is a place that definitely does sweet better than they do savory. The lemon berry ricotta pancakes were great, but someone else at my table had something with brisket or some other type of meat on top, and it was crazy dry. A sauce on top or even an over easy egg could’ve done wonders for the meal. The meat was also a bit bland for my liking. So if I were you, I’d stick to the sweet and let whoever you came with try their luck with savory if they're feeling lucky.
Lit or Nah: This place was definitely lit. I enjoyed the atmosphere more than the food, honestly. I won’t say that you can cross this place off your list completely, but you don’t need to break your neck to get here. If you don’t make it here, you’ll live. That direct bus route to the restaurant though is definitely a redeeming factor that keeps it on my radar when I want something other than Pamela’s and don’t want to pay for transportation.

On March 14, Democrat Conor Lamb secured an upset victory in the tight special election race for Pennsylvania’s 18th Congressional District against Republican Rick Saccone, in a district where Donald Trump outperformed Hillary Clinton by 20 points in the 2016 presidential election.
Lamb’s victory concludes a hard fought campaign in which he spent less money than his Republican counterpart and focused more on grassroots organizing.
Lamb is an ex-Marine, Catholic, and former prosecutor from just outside of Pittsburgh. As a centrist Democrat, he focused his campaign less on national issues and more on topics like building infrastructure through union labor and combating the Midwest’s opioid epidemic. This Democratic campaign resonated with a district that supported Trump heavily in 2016, narrowly giving Lamb the victory.
The GOP poured money into this race, as this special election was to be an important symbolic win for either party, in addition to being an important seat. 
With midterm elections approaching, special elections like this one are viewed as a way to gauge public opinion, and to see how parties are performing.
The victory in the 18th district shows that political opinions are surely in flux, showing that former Trump supporters have begun to question his and Saccone’s positions in the formerly deeply Republican district. This district would not have been winnable without the hard work of many canvassers, phone bankers, and other grassroots supporters of Lamb. Carnegie Mellon University, though not in Pennsylvania’s 18th District, had its fair share of active participants in the Lamb campaign.
Wilson Ekern, a first year Technical Writing major, worked as a canvasser for the Lamb campaign. He says that he “was inspired to make a difference in what’s going on in the political sphere, plus they were paying $10 an hour, and they got me on a nice day.” His work included traversing the outer suburbs of Pittsburgh and making the case for Lamb. Canvassing is a vital part of campaigning, though mentally and physically exhausting.
One might expect Ekern to be a devoted Lamb supporter, given this work, but in reality, he says “I wouldn’t even consider myself a Democrat, I’m more left than that.” But given the state of the political sphere in the United States, and the intricacies of this region, Ekern “figured that Lamb’s stances could change things, and that’s a better goal for myself than someone passing a [political] purity test.”
Lydia Green, a senior in linguistics and an intern for the Lamb campaign, also liked Lamb’s issue-based campaign, finding, “He’s focused on reaching across the aisle to solve problems. He wants to represent the people by listening to voters and finding out what they really want.”
Another Carnegie Mellon student, Millie Zhang, a freshman studying International Relations and Politics, also canvassed for the Lamb campaign over the past few months. She told me that she agreed only with “some of Lamb’s positions, like protecting social security and reforming the student loan system.” Regardless of whether Zhang or Ekern are the biggest supporters of each and every one of Lamb’s positions, they both made their voices heard and made a serious impact in an extremely close race. Among them were many other students, not just from Carnegie Mellon University, but from all across Pittsburgh, all working to make one of the biggest political statements of the year.
Despite his win, Lamb will not represent this specific district for long, as the 18th District of Pennsylvania will cease to exist in the wake of Pennsylvania’s Supreme Court decision on political gerrymandering. He will run again, though, but this time in Pennsylvania’s 17th District. Two other Democrats plan to challenge him in this race. While the future of Lamb’s political career is unknown, his current impact is not to be under-appreciated, as the win in a previously solidly Republican district signals a change in the national political climate.
Carnegie Mellon University may not be a hotbed of political action like some other notable universities, but regardless, many members of the Carnegie Mellon University community played a role in this historic race. That alone contradicts the narrative that Carnegie Mellon students are politically apathetic, and, furthermore, shows that students are capable of contributing to political outcomes.

Coming off the heels of record-breaking admissions years, Carnegie Mellon University is experiencing another phenomenal year in 2018. In 2016, according to the university, the percentage of women in Carnegie Mellon's computer science and engineering programs were more than double the national averages. In 2017, for the first time ever, the university enrolled more female undergraduates than male; additionally, the number of admitted students who chose to attend Carnegie Mellon spiked from 30 to 37 percent. This year, the number of applications Carnegie Mellon received skyrocketed by 19 percent, a record high for the school.
In response to the spike in applications, President Farnam Jahanian said in a university press release, “This rapid growth in interest from potential undergraduates reflects a growing recognition among students and their families that Carnegie Mellon is the destination of choice for those seeking to make an impact on the world.”
This year’s increase is just the latest milestone in a long-term trend in rising application numbers. For context, in 2008, 13,527 people applied to Carnegie Mellon. In 2018, that statistic had swelled to 24,351.
This year's massive leap was not confined to just one college — all six of Carnegie Mellon’s undergraduate colleges experienced substantial increases. The largest increase was in the School of Computer Science, which received 30 percent more applicants compared to last year. It was trailed closely by the Dietrich College of Humanities and Social Sciences, which had a 29 percent increase, the Tepper School of Business, which had a 26 percent increase, and the Mellon College of Science, which shot up 20 percent. Additionally, the College of Engineering and the College of Fine Arts reported growth in the double-digits.
The surge in applicants also led to a more diverse applicant pool. Applications from Asian-Americans rose 30 percent, African-Americans rocketed up 26 percent, and Hispanic-Latinos increased by 20 percent. The number of female applicants also grew, up 22 percent from last year, while seven percent more applications were submitted by international students compared to 2017.
The Dean of Admission, Mike Steidel, discussed the effect this increase will have on Carnegie Mellon’s acceptance and recruiting process in an email to The Tartan. Steidel clarified that the university would not be changing its review process for applicants, stating that “Regardless of the number of applicants, our admission process is designed to identify a diverse group of candidates with the highest level of academic or artistic accomplishment, evidence of collaboration, leadership, service and community engagement.”
When asked what Dietrich’s 29 percent spike means for the future of the college, Steidel warned that more applications does not necessarily correlate with an increase in the quality of the applications. However, he claimed that “in the case of Dietrich, there has been a stunning increase in the quality of our admitted and enrolling classes over the past few years,” hinting at a bright future for the College of Humanities and Social Sciences.
Steidel also divulged that the surge will be affecting the Office of Admission’s recruiting strategies. He explained how Carnegie Mellon has been adjusting its recruiting to “focus on fit rather than demonstrated interest” in an effort to discover “the right prospects rather than just an increasing number of them.” Additionally, in the university’s statement, Steidel stressed the importance of diversity, asserting that “when you think about what makes a university great, it's really not a homogenous community, it's a diverse community that makes us so significantly stronger.”
With a record number of applicants this year, the Office of Admission will have their work cut out for them in deciding who to admit, especially since this year provided a “truly outstanding group of candidates to consider,” according to Steidel. Applicants will hear back about their admissions decision by March 31. Those who are admitted will have to decide whether to accept or decline the offer by the national reply date of May 1. When those numbers come in, perhaps Carnegie Mellon will be able to add to its record-breaking list of accomplishments from the past several years.

Recently, the Office of Title IX released the Sexual Assault and Relationship Violence (SARV) Study findings for 2017. As part of a biennial study, the Office of Title IX and the university compiles data from surveys sent out to all students and analyzes the findings to uncover trends and determine the effectiveness of current initiatives aimed at preventing instances of sexual assault and relationship violence.
The study for 2017 produced a 29.5 percent response rate among undergraduate students and a 25.9 percent response rate among graduate students, approximately seven percent and five percent lower, respectively, than the response rate from 2015’s study. The study finds that overall, 25.8 percent of undergraduate women experienced a completed sexual assault since enrolling at Carnegie Mellon. This statistic is around the same as that of 2015 (26 percent). For graduate women, the statistic is up 0.9 percent from two years prior.
The 2017 study also includes the gender identity of non-binary students, which was not present in the 2015 study. Grace Huddleston, a member of SARV Activism For Everyone (SAFE), a student group focused on reducing sexual assault at Carnegie Mellon, found that there are “a lot of similarities between the two studies. One big difference this year is the gender non-binary option which is great and highlights a problem on campus that you can't see in the 2015 report.”
Though the purpose of these studies are to educate the Carnegie Mellon community, Resident Assistant John Solomon believes that these findings should be used to start important conversations that can help to prevent further instances of assault. “My role is to be conscious of activities that my residents are getting into that are questionable with regards to SARV and to be an outlet to connect residents to resources, [such as] Title IX or [Counseling and Psychological Services]. I took a look at the finds, just skimmed through it. There is a lot of stuff that goes into it. The findings are very thorough.”
Though Solomon found the study's results to be important to those caring for Carnegie Mellon students, he believes that not many other students have taken the time to learn about the study’s findings, saying “I think I am in the minority of students that have looked into that.”
To be thorough, the study asked respondents about many different identifiers, such as gender (including non-binary), year, and sexual orientation. However, Huddleston adds that “certain demographic information seemed to be missing, like race, income, or immigration status. Gender violence affects anyone, but certain groups are disproportionately affected and I would like to know what efforts will be made in the future to study these factors.” 
Another anonymous contributor argued that increasing the scope of the study would incentivize more people of different backgrounds to participate in the study.
The reliance of this study on the responses of students may be worrisome as the response rate can vary, and most other peer institutions do not rely on voluntary surveys. They instead use data on reported assaults to compile a yearly report. These reports include the type of assault as well as the punishment. 
Though Carnegie Mellon University’s study does not include these metrics, the utilization of student responses indicates the university's desire to increase student engagement on such an important report, and include assaults that may not have been reported formally.
The increased specificity in the 2017 study provides a way to avoid the misconception that sexual assault is a binary thing, either completed or not. 
The study highlights different manifestations of sexual assault and relationship violence such as attempted sexual assault and the inclusion of non-normative identities. 
Should the university continue taking steps toward making the study more comprehensive and inclusive, by considering the myriad identities that affect those subjected to sexual assault and the many forms that sexual assault may take, an increasing percentage of the student body might partake in the SARV study, which would lead to more accurate results due to the higher participation, which would in turn lend a better understanding of sexual assault and relationship violence within the Carnegie Mellon community.

Discussions are the necessary starting points in forging respectful and lasting interpersonal relationships. To foster these types of discussions, the Advocacy Committee of the Undergraduate Student Senate is hosting informal yet informative discussions centered around important issues such as race, culture, gender, stereotypes, multiple identities, diversity, and multiculturalism in our community and the around the world. These dialogues are bi-weekly 30-minute conversations in the Center for Student Diversity and Inclusion, in the basement of the Cohon Center.
These conversations also make use of an activity called the "Race Card." Race Cards are short, yet powerful, six-word messages that will be displayed in the center as well as the university to further demonstrate the importance of the work of the center, the opinions of the students, and the initiative.
The first of these conversations was held last Friday from 4:30 to 5 p.m., with the topic of Art as Activism. This conversation used the Race Card format to foster thoughtful conversations and concisely express complex ideas, as well as encourage other members of the campus community to think about this topic.
On the first conversation, Jeffrey Ko, the Senator in charge of this initiative, says that "we had about 10 people engage in casual and respectful conversations. The Center for Student Diversity and Inclusion is an excellent area to facilitate these important discussions because not only is it an inclusive and welcoming space, but also it hosts the excellent staff that can contribute to these discussions at any point. Overall, we would love to continue these discussions and reach out to a broader group of students."
The next Diversity Dialogue is planned for the same time this Friday, March 30, in the Cohon Center. This conversation will revolve around multiculturalism on campus, as well as the level of cohesion between cultural groups on campus. It will include fostering dialogue around and creating a mosaic displaying what culture means to the participants in the conversation.
Getting involved in these Diversity Dialogues is a low-commitment way to be included in conversations about important topics on campus, as well as to listen to fellow students' perspectives and experiences pertaining to these topics of race and culture. If you would like more information or would like to get involved, contact Senator Jeffrey Ko at jko2@andrew.cmu.edu.

On Tuesday, March 13, Democrat Conor Lamb of Mount Lebanon, PA beat his Republican opponent Rick Saccone of Elizabeth, PA in a close special congressional race in the southern suburbs of Pittsburgh. Donald Trump won this race’s district, Pennsylvania's 18th Congressional District, by nearly 20 percentage points in 2016. Causes of the district's dramatic flip, as well as what other Democrats in red or swing states should replicate from this election, have been the subject of national speculation.
As an intern for the Lamb campaign, I had a front-row seat to the action. As I saw it, one of the primary reasons for our victory was the heavily people-powered nature of our campaign. There was a reason that Lamb began his victory speech by saying, “We did it. You did it!” Without the help of our many hardworking volunteers, the campaign could not have achieved anything. In the month or so leading up to the election, we had steady streams of volunteers coming in and out of the field offices to knock on doors and phonebank from 9 a.m. to 9 p.m. every day of the week. In addition to our many dedicated adult volunteers, we also had a team of about 80 youth volunteers who put their heart and soul (and even a few school days) into the campaign. All of these volunteering efforts only intensified during get out the vote (GOTV) weekend.
The same could not be said of the Saccone campaign, which struggled to find a base of local enthusiasm. Consequently, much of the field outreach on the part of the Saccone team had to be done by paid canvassers and out-of-state volunteers. Mike Cox, a Saccone volunteer who flew in from California to help the campaign, complained to NBC News that “some of the locals are just kind of sitting back...they don’t even want to be a part of it.” But, local apathy was a problem only faced by the Republican candidate. While the Lamb campaign did see a number of volunteers come to the district from places like New York and Washington D.C., we had no trouble finding dedicated locals willing to devote hours to knocking on doors.
Another related difference between the two campaigns was their respective finances. The Lamb campaign refused to take money from super Political Action Committees (PACs), relying instead on grassroots funding and managing to raise over $3.3 million with an average individual donation of only $33. Lamb outraised Saccone five-to-one, causing outside Republican groups to pick up Saccone’s slack and pour $9 million into the race. The fact that Lamb rejected PAC donations in favor of small individual contributions and outraised Saccone is yet another example of how Lamb’s was a campaign by the people, for the people: while Saccone’s campaign was largely financed by a few powerful members of the Republican Party, Lamb’s campaign was financed by the people of western Pennsylvania.
Perhaps one reason that western Pennsylvanians were so fired-up to volunteer for, donate to, and eventually vote for Lamb was his focus on local issues. Looking just at his website, one can see that among his main priorities are tackling the opioid epidemic and protecting social security and Medicare. These are issues that hit close to home for many district members. The reach of the opioid crisis in western Pennsylvania means that many of Lamb’s now-constituents have friends or family members struggling with addiction and stand to benefit from the care that Lamb advocates for. Additionally, Medicare and social security are especially important in western Pennsylvania, where the population is aging. Many residents of the 18th congressional district personally rely on these public resources to live with dignity.
Less than a week before the election, I was in the room as Lamb spoke with a group of the youth team volunteers. He discussed the importance of showing gratitude for workers. Some people work challenging, miserable jobs, and these people deserve our thanks as well as basic human dignity, he argued. It was precisely this gratitude that compelled local labor unions to throw their unwavering support behind Lamb. Additionally, an endorsement and visit from Pennsylvania’s own blue-collar hero, former Vice President Joe Biden, at a Lamb GOTV rally, held at the Carpenters Training Center, certainly didn’t hurt the campaign’s favor with labor. As Peter Baker and Michael D. Shear of The New York Times wrote, “the [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People] helped win Attorney General Jeff Sessions' former Alabama Senate seat for Doug Jones in December. Organized labor, once seen as fractured and feckless in the Trump era, gave the Democrat Conor Lamb his edge in Pennsylvania.”
While the scope of the campaign’s volunteer efforts, grassroots funding, focus on local issues, and strong union support are the main reasons I believe we won and are the main strengths of the campaign that the national Democratic Party should emulate going into the midterm elections this fall, in the aftermath of the election, media outlets have not been focusing on them, spotlighting Lamb’s moderatism and voters’ attitudes towards Donald Trump instead.
For instance, one article from The Hill with the headline “Conor Lamb proves running as moderate is a winning strategy” makes the argument that Lamb won because voters saw his moderatism as a sign that he was realistic and willing to live up to his promises. The article says, “to be a moderate is to believe in getting things done and building consensus. Lamb shows that you don't have to have moderate views on every issue to be a moderate. You simply have to be willing to put solutions above ideology. The political system we have needs moderate voices in order to function, and the rising political fortunes of moderate candidates may bring a new era of legislative productivity to Congress.”
The benefits that this article describes of electing moderates are not solely the domain of moderates — liberal Democrats can (and should) also “believe in getting things done” and putting “solutions above ideology.” In fact, from my experience talking to voters, it seemed that people appreciated Lamb’s dedication to solutions above ideology or party as well as the fact that his platform came from his honest values rather than any particularly moderate position he held. Additionally, I would guess that Lamb’s more conservative views on guns and abortion lost him more votes than they earned him — for every one Republican who would volunteer, it seemed that there were three who would call in to the office to tell us that they wouldn’t vote for Lamb because he wasn’t a true supporter of life. Conservative voters did not seem to believe that Lamb would truly defend their values. In the 21st century, a Democrat can never out-conservative a Republican.
Additionally, the liberal base of Lamb supporters, the group primarily in Allegheny County where there was the strongest support for Lamb on election night, seemed a bit turned off by Lamb’s more conservative positions. It seemed that most of the campaign’s volunteers and even most of the core field staff were far more liberal than Lamb himself. Perhaps there would have been even more enthusiasm from this Democratic base and a greater margin of victory if Lamb had maintained his honesty and dedication to solutions and bipartisanship but moved his positions, or end goals, further to the left.
The media’s other main takeaway from this election seems to be that PA-18 voters elected a Democrat because they regret electing Trump. Many articles like “House Race in Pennsylvania May Turn on Trump Voters’ Regrets” from The New York Times have cropped up to argue that a Lamb victory is a sign of weakening support for the President. But, people are not that rational or predictable and often experience cognitive dissonance. Just as some people supported both Obama and Trump, people voted for Lamb while maintaining support for the President, even though the two offered very different solutions to the problems of the working class. What won both men their respective elections was that their visions both addressed the problems of the working class (along with other groups) in ways that voters thought to be common sense solutions. People who saw the logic of Trump’s policies in 2016 still have the capability of reasoning in that same way again, even if they did vote for Lamb. After all, it was not Trump up for election here. As Lamb told a reporter on election day just after voting, “[The race] says a lot about Democratic enthusiasm around here. People are really excited about this race, and I’m happy for them that their voices are going to be heard all around the world today. But this is a local race, people are voting for either me or Rick Saccone I don’t think it has anything to do with the president.”

When I was younger, I watched a lot of high school sitcoms and television shows where the only Asians I’d see were students that were pointed out for their ridiculously good grades, who were not just good at every subject but also math — the hardest and most difficult subject for students, because, apparently, numbers were hard.
And, yes, not only was I one of those students who got A's on all her English papers, I was one of those students in my high school who attended AP Calculus BC alongside seniors while everyone else was still struggling with Pre-Calculus. During free periods, I’d be the person my classmates consulted for help with a math problem. I was known for being smart in my high school, and I loved it. So naturally, I prided myself (and still do) on being a member of Ravenclaw, one of Hogwarts’ four main houses.
According to the lore of Harry Potter, Ravenclaws are known for their wit, intelligence, and wisdom. They’re characterized as “the smart House” as opposed to “the brave house” (Gryffindor), “the loyal house” (Hufflepuff), and “the cunning house” (Slytherin). As any Harry Potter fan knows, the two most well-known members of Ravenclaw are the quirky Luna Lovegood and Cho Chang, the most prominent Asian character in the entirety of the series. Since Luna was white, it seemed that J.K. Rowling could have put her in any house she wanted. But, it only seemed natural to her, at the time, that probably the only Asian featured in any of the Harry Potter franchise’s nine movies would be in “the smart House.” God forbid if Rowling had made her brave.
In a way, Hogwarts houses are comparable to these positive stereotypes. They are largely defined by dominant character traits. There is an immense history behind each one and an even larger amount of pride supporting it. However, you can choose your Hogwarts house, or at the very least, you can take a quiz that strongly recommends your Hogwarts house and rebel against your answer if you don’t like it when you took a newer, second version of said quiz. But, you can’t choose your race.
Just like your Hogwarts house, it seems that your race comes with built-in, distinct, and defined traits, skills, and a personality. Mostly, we associate these things with positive qualities: Asians are known to be smart, driven to succeed, and great at math. Black people are supposed to be great at sports or great at rapping. Latinos are great at dancing. Furthermore, it’s not only different racial groups that suffer from positive stereotypes but also nationalities and genders. Italians are known for loving their family and being great cooks. Women are considered to be natural nurturers.
But, these positive traits also lead to restrictions and barriers. Since they were smart, Asian kids weren’t supposed to be popular; they were just supposed to be nerds, holed up studying all day. Because black people are great athletes, it is assumed that they struggle in school and have poorer grades. Because women are natural nurturers, they’re “not strong enough” or “too emotional.” Positive stereotypes allow people to judge books by their covers and give them certain expectations going into reading them that can sometimes be hard to change, never giving the book a chance to prove them wrong. Phrases like “Of course she aced that test; she’s Asian,” or “That’s pretty smart, for a black guy,” or “You’re pretty tough, for a girl” are micro-aggressions that contribute to the constant nagging doubt that we will never be more than our race or live up to our race.
Positive stereotypes also bring about the concept of what it means to be part of the “true race” in culture, or what it means if someone is “not Asian enough” or “not black enough.” If someone is not so-called "enough" of their race, it means their personality didn’t check off enough boxes to fit a stereotype. It hints at a lack of knowledge, experience, and understanding of the complex and diverse experiences undertaken by members of the same racial group. In America, this is an element of the diaspora, or the broader distinction between groups like “Asian-American” and “Asian,” emphasizing on the “American” to the point where it almost engulfs the “Asian,” pulling them further apart, creating more estrangement on the former side and depicting the “Asian” as an esteemed, exclusive group of people that Asian-Americans can only hope to join one day.
When I was a young teenager, I began questioning myself and comparing myself to other people of my race. There were fewer than ten Asians in my entire high school, and my hometown was known for being distinctly white, suburban, and middle and upper-class. I’d compare my experience to those of my Filipino cousins, and envied their Tagalog and Filipino History classes and their experience of not just growing up around the extended family, but around other Filipinos. I’d know basic Chinese traditions but would grow up eating “Americanized” Chinese food. Even when I’d visit my extended family in Manila every other year, I am defined by the fact that I am from America.
It forces people to pick a side. Do you belong to the country where you were born in, or where your family is from? Furthermore, is there a difference between those two?
Carnegie Mellon has allowed me to be more prideful and knowledgeable of my Asian-American experience. It has also shown me how large and overreaching the diaspora is. It has shown me the difference between being Asian-American and Asian, and how they’re sadly two different things separated by differences in style, culture, perceptions, and personality. But, Carnegie Mellon has also shown me people that are much more than these labels, being able to bond despite their differences about their interests and passions.
Throughout our lives, we’ve each met a person who shatters the lid of the supposed box that our positive stereotypes place us in. And, if you haven’t met someone who does that yet, you’re likely to find someone in the two months left of this school year. College gives people an outlet to express themselves, or possibly reinvent themselves from their high school or their hometown. College gives students an outlet to break out of the norms that used to hold them back and break away from the small set of skills and values that their race imposed on them due to the pressure of society. Most importantly, college gives students a community of people who understand the changes that people are going through and support them, helping people to find others who value one’s own individuality above all else. Especially amongst a community with a significantly large Asian population, Carnegie Mellon students have matured from high school to understand that there is more to the “smart Asian” or “black football star” that they share their classes with.

A few weeks ago, Carnegie Mellon released the results of the 2017 SARV study, which is focused on determining how many students are survivors of sexual assault and relationship violence, as well as students’ perceptions of how the university handles these issues, among others. While this year's freshmen class has a lower rate of sexual assault than in the past, one in four undergraduate women are still victims of sexual assault while being a student at Carnegie Mellon. In order to see a significant decrease in the undergraduate population affected by sexual assault, Carnegie Mellon needs to provide more resources to the Title IX office, make students more aware of how to file a report, and enforce mandatory sexual assault training.
Carnegie Mellon’s Office of Title IX initiatives currently only includes three full-time employees. According to the study, only two to six percent of assaults are reported to Carnegie Mellon. While the current staff may be able to handle this caseload, more resources need to be allocated to the Title IX office so more educational programs can be done to teach students how to file a report, as well as the different options available to them. An estimated 3,200 students experienced sexual assault (either attempted or completed) since enrolling at Carnegie Mellon. It is ludicrous for the university to only employ three full-time and one part-time employee to be responsible for the assaults of over 3,000 students. If the university provided the Title IX office with more adequate resources, it may not lead to a huge decrease in the number of assaults, but surely it would increase the number of people reporting and as a result somewhat lower the number of sexual assaults, since the perpetrators (in at least some cases) would be removed from the community. 
As a current sophomore, I cannot recall a single moment when it was explained to me how Title IX handles complaints. If students are more educated on these complaints, it is much more likely they will report to Title IX if they were ever assaulted. This is extremely important, because not only can a Title IX investigation that finds the perpetrator guilty help protect students from future assaults but also the Title IX office can also provide students with resources on how to cope with the assault.
There also needs to be mandatory sexual assault training for all students. Currently, Haven, an online course about sexual assault, is required for all incoming freshmen. However, there is no enforcement if this training is not completed. Housefellows encourage students to finish Haven, but there are no repercussions if they do not. This makes the training appear more as an afterthought, as a way to pretend that the university is requiring students to complete this training but offering no consequences for those who do not. It is not a requirement at this point; instead, it is treated as a simple suggestion. Instead, this training should be required in order for students to join on-campus organizations. If they will be interacting with those in the community outside of the classroom, then this training should be mandatory. 
While Carnegie Mellon is providing some resources, it is not doing enough. Hopefully, the university’s new leadership will prioritize sexual assault. Until then, it seems we will make limited progress, and just continuing the cycle of slightly lower rates, followed by a few conversations with university faculty, and then a new study. Most of the students here are hoping for the day when 100 percent of assaults are reported, and 100 percent of students complete the Haven training. Until then, we wait for the university to take the proper steps to make this a reality.

We live in a world that desperately needs open dialogue on mental health. Instead, what do we get? An adaptation of Jay Asher's 13 Reasons Why in the hands of Netflix users across the globe. Most likely due to the success of the show, it is anticipated that a second season will arrive sometime in 2018.
There's just a slight problem: the book and the show dance under the false pretense of raising awareness of mental health and suicide while entertaining audiences. Underneath the pretense lies a dangerous message that has already negatively impacted viewers.
The show tells the story of Hannah Baker (Katherine Langford), a seventeen-year-old who died by suicide. She leaves behind thirteen tapes directed to thirteen different people who she claims contributed to her decision to end her life. Reasons range from bullying to rumors to rape. A schoolmate, Clay Jensen (Dylan Minette), receives these tapes and tries to piece together what contributed to Hannah's suicide.
The lesson of this show? Even the slightest mistake can leave blood on your hands, and suicide is justifiable given the right circumstances.
The show does address serious topics, such as bullying and sexual assault, and how they are too often mishandled. However, this show inadvertently portrays suicide as a logical or reasonable solution to struggles. Because Hannah had been under such horrible circumstances, her suicide was somehow justified. The creators can try to justify the show by claiming the moral is to inspire people to be kinder to one another. However, this doesn't change the fact that the show tells its viewers that suicide is a valid answer.
Executive producer Selena Gomez describes Asher's story as "tragically beautiful." There is nothing “tragically beautiful” about Hannah's story, unlike what Gomez claimed. This romanticization of mental illness makes mental illness seem artistic and almost desirable. Instead of encouraging people to seek help for mental illnesses, the show made it appear as though being stuck in a depressive state somehow makes one “deep” or “beautiful.” 
The impact of 13 Reasons Why goes beyond the number of views or tweets about the show. Bella Herndon was a fifteen-year-old seeking help for depression and bullying. She was one of the millions who watched the show, and on April 18, attempted suicide. Her parents rushed her to the hospital, where she would later die. Her father, John Herndon, publicly criticized Gomez and the creator of the shows, whom he believes created “a product about people who are hurt and how they can hurt themselves.” He went to Netflix and claimed it was "hypocritical" that they fire Kevin Spacey from House of Cards following allegations of sexual misconduct but continue to allow a second season of 13 Reasons Why.
Bella is not the only viewer whose death may be linked to the show. Franco Alonso Lazo Medrano, 23, died by suicide, leaving behind thirteen tapes along with instructions for distributing the tapes, just like in the show.
The Journal of the American Medical Association found that internet searches pertaining to suicide skyrocketed following the release of the show. The disturbing three-minute scene of Hannah's suicide led to an increase in queries surrounding suicidal ideation. Additionally, Scientific American has noted the existence of suicide contagion, the phenomena that a suicide will lead to "copycats." Bella and Franco are only two reported cases; unfortunately, there are likely far more similar cases that have not been brought into light.
Suicide claims thousands of lives; approximately 90 percent of people who died by suicide had some sort of diagnosable mental illness. However, we find ourselves in a society that struggles to address this epidemic. A show that could possibly open dialogue on topics such as mental illness and trauma decided to profit off of them instead, and the decision to make a second season further reinforces the greed of the people behind the show.
I understand that it is not 13 Reasons Why's job to educate people on mental health, nor do I expect it to have a perfect representation of touchy topics such as mental health. However, it was irresponsible for the creators to ignore the concerns of mental health professionals, and their lousy usage of slapping a content warning on the screen isn't enough to prevent another tragedy resulting from the show. For the second season, the anticipated viewer discretion warning is a short video of the actors from the series telling viewers that the "series may not be right" for viewers who are struggling with some of the themes portrayed in the show. Additionally, the actors suggest that viewers "may want to watch it with a trusted adult." This is simply a cheap tactic for the show to push away any potential blame. Furthermore, it portrays mental illness as if it is something that children grow out of, making it appear comparable to a child's fear of the "monster under the bed." Instead, the creators need to take responsibility for the consequences of their show and re-evaluate how to better initiate dialogue on mental health.
Perhaps 13 Reasons Why did accomplish its goal in sparking a much-needed conversation about mental health; without it, mental health organizations across the globe would not be speaking out about how not to portray suicide on the big screen. However, the creators need to realize that there are consequences to their careless portrayal of sensitive topics such as suicide. No amount of content warnings advising viewer discretion can change that.

Recently, the current socio-political climate in the United States has cast an increasingly important light on an alarming issue: that is, the lack of financial knowledge an average person possesses. By financial knowledge, I do not necessarily mean in terms of being able to determine and discern the complexities involved in the operations of a country or firm, but rather in terms of having a certain amount of fundamental knowledge on a broad basis of how the economy works, its main functions and drivers, and especially what the main obstacles which hamper growth.
This deficiency in our common knowledge has been put to the test, especially with the legislative economic agenda of the current government administration. Even though this has been a well-known issue in the past, it regained national attention with the advent of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act passed into law by Congress in January, even though one can easily argue its merits from both sides of the aisles such as the bill’s effects on the national debt or how the bill has encouraged higher consumer spending, at least in the short-term. 
The more pertinent discussion, however, is President Donald Trump’s recent claims and plan to impose tariffs on steel and aluminum imports, which has brought up this conversation regarding our national lack of financial awareness. Certainly, credit, investments, loans, and mutual funds can be an intimidating and challenging concept to grasp, with its intricacies being seemingly impossible to understand. This is one of the main reasons wherein economists can make thoroughly researched, evidence-backed claims which the public at large seemingly ignores. 
Furthermore, this is evident in President Trump's tweet that “When a country (U.S.) is losing many billions of dollars on trade with virtually every country it does business with, trade wars are good, and easy to win. Example, when we are down $100 billion with a certain country and they get cute, don’t trade anymore — we win big. It’s easy!” However, trade wars are definitely not a good thing and certainly not easy to win. 
Essentially, the President wants to impose a 25 percent tariff on steel imports and a 10 percent tariff on aluminum imports. Historically speaking, trade wars almost always devolve into tit-for-tat protectionist rules and regulations which usually tend to hurt all involved parties. In this scenario, however, the brunt of the increased cost is going to be borne by the average American consumer. Secretary of Commerce Wilbur Ross went on air and defended the President’s plan by arguing that it costs approximately $700 for a ton of steel in the American market, which is then used to make a car. Therefore, a 25 percent increased cost for the car is merely an extra $175 price, approximately. He dismissed the $175 as a trivial amount for the average consumer, whereas the administration and House of Representatives Speaker Paul Ryan in early February touted a $1.50 increase in a weekly paycheck for a Pennsylvania schoolteacher. This extra $1.50 amounts to an approximately $80 increase in annual wage which was lauded by many as proof and conviction of the current administration’s promise to help stimulate and grow the economy. If $80 is a huge windfall, how can $175, more than double its amount, be a “trivial” sum?
It has become increasingly apparent that the reason such claims can be made with impunity is simply that most people don’t have the basic understanding to question or understand such claims. Financial literacy is important for more reasons than just being able to comprehend the national discourse, it directly affects in numerable tangible ways. From paying different rates of tax on capital gains compared to labor and interest income to understanding the factors affecting one’s credit scores, being financially literate can often act as a catalyst for future success.

It was probably her last opportunity to patch up her reputation. 
U.S. Department of Education Secretary Betsy DeVos stammered and deflected her way through the tense 60 Minutes interview conducted by veteran journalist Lesley Stahl on CBS News which covered school safety, equality, and why she’s been labeled as the “most hated Cabinet secretary.” Her media presence on CBS News was high-stakes since she’s been staying out of the spotlight to avoid backlash and criticizing headlines, and the interview was disappointing, to say the least. Her interview was even worse than her performance at her January 2017 confirmation hearing, when she had to convince key members of Congress that she had the knowledge and experience to serve as the Secretary of Education, even though she never went to public school, grew up extraordinarily wealthy, and, as seen in the 60 Minutes interview, is not knowledgeable about the education system and its respective policies. 
The results of the interview were not surprising; it is clear that DeVos will never have a change of heart or opinion. However, what was unexpected was her lack of preparation for the interview. 
“I wasn’t surprised,” said Noelle Ellerson Ng, in an interview with The Atlantic, “but I think the naive portion of my personality wanted to see her do better.” Ng oversees the policy and advocacy arm of the School Superintendents Association.
It was overwhelmingly apparent that DeVos had not educated herself on the nation’s education policies and practices since her Senate confirmation hearing. She had months to prepare and could have analyzed the “research” she so frequently referred to or visited the underperforming schools she kept mentioning she wanted to reform in that time. If anything, this interview was an opportunity for her to show she had become better at advocating for her positions, even if her opinions have not changed. 
Her awkward body language and slightly wavering smile made her seem insincere and uncomfortable. For example, if she truly believed in what she said, she should have been able to back up her claims about the best school discipline practices by citing appropriate research. Instead, she constantly deflected every question and defaulted to her classic, “We should be funding and investing in students, not in school — school buildings, not in institutions, not in systems” response, which, at this point means nothing. What’s more, she frequently debunked or contradicted her own responses. At one point, when saying that  allowing teachers to have guns in schools "should be an option for states and communities to consider," she followed up with “And I hesitate to think of, like, my first-grade teacher, Mrs. Zorhoff — I couldn't ever imagine her having a gun and being trained in that way.”
In another instance, when DeVos was lamenting about underperforming schools, she was asked if she had actually visited these schools, to which she responded, “I have not intentionally visited schools that are underperforming.” Stahl responded with, “Maybe you should.” DeVos replied, “Maybe I should. Yes,” with a smile that made viewers question her sincerity. 
The question now lies in why. Why did DeVos not prepare for this interview? Why did she not fix her mistakes since her hearing in January? Why is she not actively educating herself on education policies and research? And why has she not visited many underperforming schools? 
“I found [the interview] to be somewhere between disappointing and disturbing,” said Claire Smrekar, in an interview with The Atlantic. “It just demonstrates — again — an appalling lack of understanding of some public fundamental principles and practices related to public education.” Smrekar is an associate professor of public policy and education at Vanderbilt University whose research focuses include school choice.
In reaction to the criticism from her interview, DeVos, an infrequent tweeter, tweeted five times about how the interview unfairly treated her. She accused 60 Minutes of omitting parts of her responses, and claiming that their questions were “misguided.
CBS News, in response, published an article which stated that DeVos “was unable to answer questions about schools in her own state,” alluding to the lack of knowledge DeVos had on the subject. It didn’t matter who interviewed her, because she wouldn’t have been able to answer the questions properly anyway. The questions asked in the interview were expected, and touched on several relevant topics. Anyone could have predicted what would be asked, which is why Devos’ tweets make her seem even more clueless. Had she prepared more for the interviews, Devos could have portrayed herself in the way she wanted, regardless of her opinions. 
When Stahl asked about the outcomes of Michigan’s charter-school-expansion project, which DeVos helped create and which has been ongoing for more than two decades, she pointed out that such a program will deprive traditional public schools from funding, hurting the already underperforming schools DeVos kept lamenting about. In response, DeVos claimed that, “achievement at traditional public schools actually increases when a large percentage of children opt to enroll in privately run schools.”  Stahl then asked whether Michigan’s schools have really improved due to the charter-school-expansion project, to which DeVos responded: “I don’t know. Overall, I—I can’t say overall that they have all gotten better.”
According to Politico, “Despite two decades of charter-school growth, the state’s overall academic progress has failed to keep pace with other states,” thus claiming the contrary of what DeVos asserted.
Experts have been debating whether DeVos’s deflection of questions and vague answers were due to ignorance or intentional sidestepping. Joshua Starr, the CEO of Phi Delta Kappa International, a professional educators’ association, stated that DeVos’s behavior suggested “a matter of total incompetence or willful ignorance.”
Devos’s interview was abysmal, embarrassing, and confusing. She deflected, contradicted herself, and stumbled through the interview like an amateur. Her insincerity was blatantly apparent, and her discomfort even more so. This interview leaves a bitter taste in the mouths of Americans — a sign of what’s to come — especially as the new school-safety commission is implemented.
