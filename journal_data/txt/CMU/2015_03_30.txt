Despite inclement weather leading to a series of cancellations, Carnegie Mellon’s only Division I sports teams have rolled to successful seasons. The Money Mellons and Mr. Yuk, respectively the women’s and men’s ultimate frisbee teams, are approaching the 2015 College Series, their postseason. With some wins and some impressively close losses against top competition, both squads are looking to build on their performances and gain some success at regionals.
The Money Mellons, ranked 65 in the nation, started their season with lofty goals. “At regionals, we’ve gotten sixth, max,” said senior captain Lauren Miller, a senior business administration and statistics double major. “We want to top that.”
In order to achieve this goal, the team has been trying to develop a deep and balanced team, with each of the 25 players capable of filling many on–field roles. Each player needs to be skilled and confident to give the team the ability to reach their goals.
The team has had some on–field success as well, finishing in the top four in each of their fall tournaments. Their first tournament, the Theodore Seuss Geisel Memorial Ultimate Tournament, resulted in a third place finish and a 7–1 record, including a key victory over McMaster University, a Canadian college. Despite windy conditions that made it tough for both teams, the Money Mellons were able to win a back and forth game on the strength of an aggressive attack.
Their next tournament, North Coast, ended with a second place finish after a close final with Ohio State University, last year’s national champion. A late 6–0 run brought the Money Mellons close, but they couldn’t overcome the deficit and narrowly lost 13–10.
Their season continued with a fourth place finish at the Fall Brawl in Columbus, Ohio.
A 5–2 record included a 15–1 beatdown of regional rivals Case Western Reserve University. The team finished fourth after an overtime loss to  Michigan State University.
The Money Mellons’ first spring tournament was hit hard by snow, causing a large number of teams to drop out. They went 3–3 at the tournament.
Mr. Yuk also found some success in the fall. The team played the University of Pittsburgh, national champions in two of the last three years, to a back and forth 15–10 loss after Pitt pulled away in the closing moments. The next day, Mr. Yuk took down the University of Pennsylvania, with the help of senior mechanical engineering major Alec Assaad who hit senior captain and senior mechanical engineering and public policy student Reid Almand with a deep pass to take the match 13–12.
Like the Money Mellons, Mr. Yuk has focused largely on building the team.
“After graduating 75 percent of the team in 2013, last year was spent building a strong rookie class,” said Almand.
This year, with another strong freshman class, Mr. Yuk is set up for long term success. The team is currently preparing for Conferences, the first installment of the College Series.
The team’s goal is to advance beyond there.
“It’s all about peaking at the right time,” said Almand, “And a Cinderella run to Nationals is always in the back of our minds.”
The team is not limited to organized play either. 
After a tournament in Washington, D.C. was cancelled the morning of, Mr. Yuk played scrimmages with Princeton University and George Washington University, taking both matches, which were played directly on the National Mall.
With the College Series beginning in mid-April, both teams have plenty of time to shake off the cancellations and snow-covered tournaments to build on early season successes and put together some postseason victories.

Women’s tennis
The Carnegie Mellon women’s tennis team improved to 11–3 on the season with a 9–0 home win over Grove City College at the start of last week on March 23. Seniors Bryn Raschke and Angela Pratt won 8–3, senior Lydia Utkin and first-year Kalyani Narayan took their match 8–2.
Juniors Elizabeth Martin and Brooke Tsu shut out their opposition 8–0 in doubles play. The Tartans continued their sweep, winning all six singles matches. Pratt won 6–1, 6–1 at the top of the ladder.
Sophomore Nicholle Torres won 6–2, 6–0 in the second slot. Junior Abbey Hamstra also won a singles match 6–2, 6–0 in the fourth slot.
The team’s success did not carry to Saturday, however, as they were beaten 5–4 by No. 10 Washington and Lee University. The Tartans were swept in doubles play and could not recover in time to take the match.
Sophomore Vanessa Pavia was able to win her match, which forced a 4–4 tie, but the deciding match went to Washington and Lee, dropping the Tartans to 11–4.
The Tartans finished the weekend 11–5 after losing to Williams University on Sunday afternoon.
The women’s tennis team will next play on April 4, when they host the University of Mary Washington.
Men’s tennis
The Carnegie Mellon men’s tennis team continued their success this season, sweeping Grove City College on March 23 and beating Washington and Lee University on Saturday to move to a 9–6 record for the season. Senior Bryce Beisswanger and junior Yuvraj Kumar took their match 8-0, while senior Christian Heaney-Secord and first-year Jeffrey Chen won 8–0 as well. First-years Matt Seifert and Andrew Pratt rounded out the sweep of doubles play, taking an 8–1 victory.
Junior Abhishek Alla won his match 6–0, 6–0, sophomore Kunal Wadwani took his match 6–2, 6–1, and first-year Tommy Cheng won 6–2, 6–3, all contributing to the 9–0 overall victory.
The match against Washington and Lee was much of the same. The Tartans took two of three matches in doubles play, with Beisswanger and Kumar winning 8–5 while Wadwani and sophomore Kenny Zheng swept their match, 8–0.
In singles play, senior Will Duncan and sophomore Kiril Kirkov won 6–2, 6–3, and 6–2, 6–0, respectively, leading the Tartans to a 6–3 overall victory.
The men’s team rolled to another victory on Sunday, sweeping Christopher Newport University 9–0 to move to 11–6.
The men’s tennis team will continue their season April 4, when they host Case Western Reserve University.

As the baseball season starts next week, the Pirates have the opportunity to build on a recent run of success that resulted in two straight postseason appearances after a torturous multi-decade stretch without seeing postseason baseball. The Cardinals look weakened, the Cubs are relying on a lot to go right, and the Pirates are in a great position to win the National League (NL) Central for the first time ever.
This Pirates team’s ability to win a ton of games this year will start with a very talented assortment of position players. From the outfield in, the Pirates sport a lot of strengths in the field with very few standout weaknesses. In a competitive NL Central, this combination of depth and top-shelf talent could be the difference over the course of a long season.
The most striking concentration of talent on the Pirates is in the outfield. Pittsburgh is the only team in the league that can rival the Miami Marlins consensus top trio outside the diamond. While the most obvious name in the outfield is center fielder and 2013 MVP Andrew McCutchen, the corner outfielders should not be forgotten. 
Left fielder Starling Marte is a very toolsy player, near the top of the league in his ability to get on base, cover lots of territory, run the bases, throw from the outfield and, when he gets hot, absolutely crush the baseball. He is criminally underrated every year and has given the Pirates a massive boost in his time with the team.
In the other corner, right fielder Gregory Polanco should begin to deliver on his promise as a prospect after a lukewarm rookie season. Once a common mention among Baseball America top prospects, Polanco did not mash as many expected him to, when he came into the league. He struggled to get on base and hit for power, which put some giant gashes in his numbers. However, the jump from the minor leagues to the majors is a tough one, and the spring training results have been encouraging. 
Some ground balls have been turning into line drives and fly balls, which are more likely to turn into hits, and Polanco is a prime breakout candidate in 2015.
The infield outlook is a bit less rosy, but not much of a weakness. The corners of the infield are well taken care of. After a down season, first baseman Pedro Alvarez’s power numbers should bounce back to somewhere close to his 2013 heights, and his ability to get on base and get extra base hits were improvements over previous season’s results. Alvarez is absolutely destroying spring training, and the power is showing again. He may not hit 36 home runs this year, but he could reach 25–30 and be a huge boon for the Pirates offense.
At the hot corner, third baseman Josh Harrelson looks to build on a breakout year where his versatility and range of skills both offensively and defensively made him extremely valuable wherever manager Clint Hurdle needed him on the field. There was nothing in his peripherals to imply that his season was a fluke, and he should continue both hitting well and closing off the foul line at third base. The middle infield will be held down by Neil Walker, possibly the league’s best offensive second baseman after the Mariners’ second baseman Robinson Cano, and Jordy Mercer, a satisfactory but uninspiring option at shortstop. The two are a decent defensive double play combination, and Neil Walker can hit well enough for the both of them. The Pirates’ infield should be above average, even if it isn’t spectacular.
The Pirates’ rotation might scare off those who support them, with starters Francisco Liriano and Gerrit Cole being the only players set to have above average seasons. Both of them are high variance pitchers, however, and the rotation will certainly be a weakness. The return of starter A.J. Burnett does little to move the needle. If anything will undo the Pirates, it is the rotation. However, an excellent defensive team and decent starters should not cause too much of a leak, and this should not overwhelm the Pirates’ excellent offense. The bullpen, including closer Mark Melancon, also goes deep and can help ease the difficulties of the rotation.
Finally, the competition is not as good as everyone thinks. The Brewer’s first-half fluky success is not replicable, and they should not be a factor.
With first baseman Joey Votto not returning to his former self, the Reds could potentially be one of the worst teams in the league and will probably deal starter Johnny Cueto by the trade deadline. 
The Cubs will be very good in the near future, but it is silly to expect all of their prospects to turn into stars overnight, and players like starter Jake Arietta might regress. The addition of starter Jon Lester should not flip the script for the Cubs overnight.
Finally, the mighty Cardinals were not better than the Pirates last year, and would not have won the division without several absences from McCutchen. With many of their best players beginning to age, the Cardinals are more susceptible to bad injury luck than the Pirates, and the Cardinals offense is not very deep, with only a few players providing more than average offense. Right fielder Jason Heyward, the Cardinals’ big off-season acquisition, does not offer much in the way of offense, and left fielder Matt Holiday is set for a major decline.
The door is open for the Pirates. With the Cubs on the rise and the Cardinals trending down, it is the perfect time. It could be now or never to grab an NL Central title with this core.

Australian bowler Mitchell Starc bowled the fifth ball of the day and clean bowled wicket keeper Brendon McCullum, the New Zealand captain, for a zero. The record crowd of 93,000 at the Melbourne Cricket Ground roared as Australia got their first wicket in the first over, leaving New Zealand one for one.
Over the last month and half, 14 nations have played 48 matches at the 11th Cricket World Cup, jointly hosted by Australia and New Zealand for the second time (last time being in 1992). The 2015 World Cup marked the first time Afghanistan’s cricket team qualified for the tournament. Three associate nations — Ireland, Scotland, and United Arab Emirates — will play with the full member nations of the International Cricket Council (ICC): England, South Africa, India, Australia, Sri Lanka, Pakistan, West Indies, Bangladesh, New Zealand, and Zimbabwe.
Despite a valiant effort by associate nations, the expected full member teams led Group Stage matches and qualified for the quarter final. After the close, nerve-wracking first semifinal match, the New Zealand cricket team defeated South Africa, continued their perfect World Cup winning streak and secured their place in the final for the first time. Australia had only lost to New Zealand in a very close, yet thrilling match in the Group Stage. But they pulled out a dominant win over India, previous World Cup winner and one of the fan favorites, in the semifinal and claimed their spot in the final for the seventh time.
Once again, the co-hosts of the World Cup were the contenders for the final match this Sunday. New Zealand was the team in best form without any doubts this World Cup. The team played aggressive, attacking games. With excellent leadership by McCullum, batsman Martin Guptil’s high scores, all-rounder Daniel Vettori’s good form, and opening bowler Trent Boult taking the most wickets in the tournament, New Zealand had good chances for their first World Cup victory. Meanwhile, Australia was no lesser of a team. Having a strong home-field advantage — winning 24 matches of its last 26 matches at home — the Australian team has a penchant for attacking and winning World Cups, having won four out of the six finals. Australian captain and batsman Michael Clarke set beautifully crafted fields to get the wickets and changed his batting order to score the most runs possible. Along with the strong top batting order including batsmen David Warner and Steve Smith, the Australians would definitely give New Zealand bowlers a challenge. Though their only shortcoming is the lack of a quality spinner, the Australian bowling side gets along fine with both Mitchell Starc — the highest wicket taker so far in the tournament — and Mitchell Johnson in great shape.
The Melbourne pitch was expected to be bouncy, but also batsman-friendly as most of the pitches have been throughout the tournament for record-breaking scores. With no rain forecasted, the final match of the 2015 World Cup began on a bright, sunny Australian afternoon. Starc started the bowling attack with fast and full bowling. With McCullum gone for a duck in the first over, the day of the bowlers started. With the first opener gone, New Zealand continued to play safely and was struck down by high-quality pace bowling from Starc, bowler Josh Hazelwood, and Johnson. At the end of the first ten overs New Zealand stood 31 for one, its lowest 10-over score this World Cup. Luck was not on New Zealand’s side as it lost Guptill soon afterwards for 15 and Williamson for 12. Standing 41 for three for at end of the 14th over, Grant Elliott and Ross Taylor gave some hope to the Black Caps as they scored 111 in their partnership. However, a determined Australia got the breakthrough they needed at the start of the power play, getting Taylor out through an appeal. Soon two more wickets fell down and New Zealand was at 165 for six at the end of the 40th over with Elliott still standing, but playing more cautiously. This did not last long as Johnson took another wicket and Australian bowler James Faulkner soon took the final big wicket of Elliott. Twelve runs were scored afterwards as New Zealand collapsed at 183 all out with Johnson and Faulkner both taking three wickets each and Starc helping with two wickets and very tight bowling. Despite losing the toss, the Australians had a good chance of the winning another World Cup title as they went into the lunch break.
New Zealand began with a similarly impressive opening over by claiming the wicket of Aaron Finch and leaving the Aussies with two for one. However, batsman DA Warner carried the next ten overs by hitting seven fours and giving the edge to the Australians despite being two down for 63 at the end of 12th over. Now Clarke came in and played a captain’s innings. Along with Smith, the duo scored the highest partnership of the day with 112 runs. Clarke hit ten fours and one six before finally getting bowled out for 74 by New Zealand bowler Matt Henry. He did not get to hit the winning runs, but his half century got Australia close to a easy win with just short of nine runs. As Clarke left the MCG, he deserved a standing ovation for playing a true captain’s innings and for this final being his last One Day International Match. Only twelve more balls were needed, as Smith whirled an unorthodox hit for four and Australia won the World Cup final by seven wickets.
The Aussies rushed onto the field and got into a group hug for a deserving win. Closing ceremonies soon followed with Clarke feeling “over the moon” and said that New Zealand are always a tough team to beat in any sport. McCullum felt that though 183 was too short, it was still an approachable dream.
However, he and the New Zealand team were in high spirits as McCullum ended saying “[we] didn’t lift the trophy but no regrets [about] the brand of cricket we’ve played and we walk away with our heads held high.”
Faulkner picked up the Man of the Match for his 36 for three finish. Starc received the Man of the Tournament award for amassing reverse-swinging yorkers and 22 wickets throughout the tournament. As the Australian team picked up the trophy, they became the first team to have won the World Cup on all five continents in which cricket is played. They went for the victory lap around the stadium as the fans were still roaring from the win.  The team appropriately dedicated their win to batsman Phillip Hughes, who had died after being struck on the neck by a ball in Sydney in November.

As we progress into the 21st century, the role of artificial intelligence and robotics has become an increasingly controversial topic. While the increasing presence of these technologies has brought conveniences into our lives — from intelligent personal assistants to robot-assisted surgery — it also raises many concerns, including the potential consequences of these technologies on the social and financial welfare of future generations. In his latest book, Parenting for Technology Futures Part 1: Education & Technology, Illah Nourbakhsh, a professor of robotics at Carnegie Mellon University, offers parenting advice on how to best prepare children for a technology-driven future.
“I’ve written an earlier book which talks about the native impact robotic technology can have on society,” Nourbakhsh said. “And one of the most frequent questions I got from readers was ‘I have kids — what are they going to do in a world with a lot of unemployment, in which robot technology has taken over a lot of what humans do today? How do I prepare my kids for that, so that they can have a good life, even though [the future] sounds like a very difficult time?’”
For a long time, Nourbakhsh has been pondering these questions. A father of two, Nourbakhsh joined the Carnegie Mellon community as an assistant professor of Robotics in 1997. Since then, he has founded and directed the Community Robotics, Education, and Technology Empowerments (CREATE) Lab. He also serves as the head of the Robotics Masters Programs within The Robotics Institute.
Written from the perspective of a parent and an academic expert, Nourbakhsh’s Parenting for Technology Futures is a response to the concerns of parents for their children’s futures, with a focus on current education issues. Prior to writing his book, he spent about a year reading previously published books and articles that existed on this topic. “I was trying to find out what some of the most important lessons to give somebody are,” Nourbakhsh explained. “I wanted to make the whole book really thin so that it is easy for anybody to read in almost a sitting or two.”
In addition to his readings, the professor also turned to two colleagues for assistance. One of the colleagues was Junlei Li, an associate professor of psychological science, co-director of the Fred Rogers Center, and an early childhood and learning expert at St. Vincent College. “Junlei Li really studies the question of teaching practices, and what it means to be innovative as a teacher,” Nourbakhsh said. The other colleague was Professor Fatemeh Zarghami, a childhood and human development instructor at De Anza College. She also certifies child centers for the State of California. “I [had] the two of them read the early draft,” Nourbakhsh said. “Then I read their detailed comments and rewrote the whole thing.”
To keep the book affordable and accessible to parents, Professor Nourbakhsh self-published his book on Amazon.com. The book is available in both digital and paperback versions.
The first volume of  “Parenting for Technology Futures” is laid out into five chapters that contain tutorials, as well as references to additional reading materials. In the introduction, the professor states the importance of preparing children for mastery of technology fluency, so that they become “creative producers rather than robotic consumers of technology” in the future. Possessing technology fluency is, however, described as being different from having technology literacy, which the author believes sentences people to passivity as they set their sights “on the goal of correctly employing electronic products and digital media without hesitation.”
Following the introduction on technology education, the professor discusses the policy debate concerning Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math (STEM) learning in the U.S. “I bring parents up to date with what I think they need to know about schools today and the STEM [strategy],” said Nourbakhsh. “What it means, what the politics are behind it, and how schools use and misuse it.”
Aiming to improve its performance among its foreign peers, the U.S. government has implemented programs including the No Child Left Behind Act and Race to the Top. In turn, there has been a push for accountability, a policy in which funding for schools depends upon the tested proficiencies of its students. However, as Nourbakhsh points out, such measure can have drawbacks.
“Diane Ravitch was an Assistant Secretary of Education, and she was originally on the side for accountability. But what she discovered over time is that when you have these systems of accountability, it diverts the underlying goal of learning. So now, you’re not using a test just to see how good somebody is at learning. 
You’re using the test as a guideline on what to teach,” said Nourbakhsh. “What really matters is that teachers can engage well with students, and cause a love of learning to blossom.”
The book then transitions into the topic of digital learning. In this section of the book, Nourbakhsh mentions examples of digital learning, including Massive Online Open Courses (MOOC’s), Khan Academy, and cognitive tutors. “I try to lay out some groundwork on what the digital learning system space looks like, its testing tools and the tools that your child can benefit from,” said Nourbakhsh. “I also talk about some of the hype that you hear — like having a [digital] tutor that can solve all the problems that your child does in math class—and the subtleties that explain why this hype isn’t true.”
At the end of the book, Nourbakhsh also includes a preview of the second volume, which suggests activities that parents can do with their kids, from toddlers to teenagers. Activity ideas include watching car shows or identifying invasive species at local park conservancies. 
“In all those cases you’re teaching your child to identify something,” said Nourbakhsh. “That turns out to be a very important part of technological fluency, which allows you to do things like program computers in the future.” In keeping his first volume to 64 pages, Nourbakhsh wanted to create a guide that parents could easily refer back to. During his research for his book, he noticed a dearth of books that discussed STEM and digital learning from an unbiased perspective.
In addition, he also saw that there was very little content written to help parents understand the idea of STEM and standards within the education system. “We’re entering an age where technology will be changing rapidly. We need more and more guides that help us make sense of that new age,” said Nourbakhsh. “And I hope my book is just one example of what we’re going to see several kinds of versions of in the future.”
In the coming weeks, free copies of his book will be distributed during a conference about technology fluency for teaching and learning. In the meantime, Nourbakhsh is working on the second installment of his parenting book. He also maintains a blog that focuses on a predicted future, one in which robots will play a bigger part in the lives of human beings.
Beyond his achievements as a professional, at the end of the day, Nourbakhsh is a father who carries the strong belief that parents must be active participants in the learning development of their children. “You cannot outsource it to a computer, and you cannot outsource it to the teacher,” he stated. “You have to be actively participating in that process if you want your kids to succeed.”

As part of the global effort to explore and understand complex behaviors of the brain, Robert Mason, senior research associate and Marcel Just, director of the Center for Cognitive Brain Imaging (CCBI) at Carnegie Mellon, have been studying how the brain learns and processes successive information. 
In May 2015, their most recent findings, from projects that are part of Carnegie Mellon’s BrainHubSM initiative, will be published in Volume 111 of the scientific journal NeuroImage. Mason, the lead author of the study, believes that their work will benefit research on future learning techniques by approaching this subject area not in a behavioral manner, like most studies in the past, but rather by directly examining the brain.
Although this topic of how the brain learns is an ongoing process that Mason and Just continue to explore, their most recent paper centers around a study consisting of fourteen college students. The students, six female and eight male, were asked to listen to informative descriptions of four different types of mechanical systems and were analyzed through the CCBI’s fMRI machine. Each participant received information about these systems that could easily be understood from a nontechnical standpoint, and were given small visual aids to support the explanations.
The researchers studied mechanical systems including a bathroom scale, a fire extinguisher, an automobile braking system, and a trumpet. Although these objects are common to everyday life, the mechanics of the objects are not generally known to the public. For example, the participants in the study learned about the bathroom scale through phrases such as “A bathroom scale consists of a lever, a spring, a ratchet and a dial,” “the person’s weight exerts a downward force on a lever,” and “the lever pulls a spring downward in a proportion to the weight.”
Through reverse engineering, Mason and Just were able to take the data exhibited from the fMRI machine and deduce the underlying neurological processes that generate understanding of such mechanics. “You see how it works, and you have to reason back to what mechanism would give you this pattern,” Just said. “For example, if we see activation in an area of the brain that is very commonly associated with visual imagery, we can say that they are forming some type of visual connection.”
This study also utilizes machine learning through the use of a “classifier,” which takes in variables that form a relationship and, upon the presentation of new and unknown variables, will be able to classify where those new variables fit into the mappings of data. 
In this particular application, the machine is able to identify what people are thinking about in a precise manner. “The thought patterns are specific to that system,” Just said. “So your activation pattern for when you think about a trumpet is different from when you think about a bathroom scale.” This classifier essentially allows scientists such as Just and Mason to accurately measure the thought processes of people.
Both Mason and Just found the results from the classifier as the most interesting aspect of this study thus far. Mason explained that “the degree to which you can see similarities in knowledge representation across individuals” is both surprising and interesting. 
According to Just, since the classifier analyzes multiple individuals, the fact that it can identify similar results for all individuals shows that these patterns are uniform for all individuals. “All of our brains are organized in the same way,” Just said. For instance, autistic brains process information like concrete objects and emotions the same way as standard brains do, and the only difference between the two are thoughts in relation to social interaction. The way one understands how a hammer works or how the emotion of anger feels is the same across completely different backgrounds.
Just explained that the brain categorizes learning these mechanical processes into four main parts. Before learning, the brain’s actions are “primarily visual.” As more detail is given, the brain transitions to a “mental animation” of how the system works. The third stage involves a state known as “causal reasoning,” which is when the brain puts together visualizations to try and understand what causes certain reactions. The last step is known as “embodiment,” in which one would relate one’s own body to the system. So, for example, if a hammer was being described, the individual receiving this description would eventually connect his or her own dominant hand to a hammer and visualize or understand the use of the hammer from a personal perspective. Just theorizes that, even with abstract concepts such as mathematics or theoretical physics, which humans cannot physically interact with, people still try to connect the body with the concept as a way to gain a better understanding of how it works.
Mason chose to use mechanical systems as the main focus for the study as a starting point. “With many mechanical systems, we already know what the system does and how to use it, but unless we really look into it, often times we don’t know how something works.” He hopes that understanding the brain’s learning process will eventually trigger curiosity in individuals and lead them to “think like little scientists.” 
Mason and Just’s research will continue to explore the relationship between learning and the brain, and they hope to expand the range of materials, as well as domains of knowledge, in future tests. Eventually, they would like to apply different training techniques that will apply to future classroom instructions.

Pugwash began this week’s meeting by watching Richard Stallman’s TED talk from 2014. Stallman is the founder of the free software movement, which has the goal of providing certain freedoms for software users, including the freedom to run a program, change a program’s source code, redistribute a program, and redistribute a program with your changes. Stallman argues that these freedoms are necessary for users to maintain control over the programs they run. He believes that programs without these freedoms can be instruments of unjust power, because the developer of the program can include malicious functionalities without the user’s knowledge. Malicious programs can snoop on users, track users, and restrict program functionalities.
There are many examples of this type of program. For instance, in 2009, Amazon, much to the shock of its users, deleted a version of George Orwell’s 1984 from all Kindles without the permission of their owners. This angered many users and showed that Amazon had complete control over the devices. Another instance occurred in 2010 when Sony released an update to the Play Station 3 that removed support for installing Linux. At its launch, Sony had touted the ability to install Linux on the PS3. Sony compelled users to update their systems by disabling online features on consoles that were not updated. In 2007, Microsoft updated nine small programs on machines running either Windows XP or Windows Vista without user approval. Although these changes proved to be benign, it showed that Microsoft has a universal back door through which anything on the user’s machine can be changed. In 2013, Bloomberg reported that Microsoft shares information with the NSA about vulnerabilities in its popular products before it fixes them so that the NSA and other agencies can infiltrate users’ computers.
After watching Stallman’s TED talk, members of Pugwash agreed with his argument that something has to be done about malicious programs, but many did not agree with his solution. Members who were not technically focused felt quite helpless. If they couldn’t trust software developed by companies, why could they trust software developed by other programmers?
More technically-minded members argued that, unlike companies, the open source community did not have a reason to write malicious programs. In fact, such a community tends to be self-policing. However, this argument did not quell the concerns of many members.
Many members felt that Stallman understated the sacrifice of only using free software. Free software can be of lower quality and is frequently designed for programmers rather than regular users. Many popular services use cloud-based programs, which by definition cannot be free software. By pretending that the sacrifice of only using free software is quite small, Stallman perpetuates the alienation non-programmers feel from the free software community.
Some members of Pugwash argued that the free software movement was the wrong method for preventing malicious programs. Instead, they argued that governmental regulation of programs should prevent companies from providing malicious programs. Other members argued that this process was quite impossible, because of the monumental effort required to enforce such regulation.
All members of Pugwash agreed that malicious code was a serious problem. However, many felt quite helpless and disgruntled by the free software movement. The technological barriers to understanding and being able to do something about this problem continues to be an issue without a simple solution.

Do the baristas at your local Starbucks know you by name?
Even if they don’t start scribbling down your name before you open your mouth, you are likely part of a generation in which coffee is king. Most of us live and breathe coffee, idolizing it as a magical blend that helps us start our days, study for exams, and get through meetings. But what really happens after you take that first sip and the caffeine starts to course through your body?
Caffeine is a central nervous system stimulant, according to the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). After drinking or eating something with caffeine in it, you will likely experience symptoms such as alertness, improved concentration, a quickened heartbeat, or the jitters. But don’t give your coffee all the credit for your productivity just yet — you might be surprised by what caffeine actually does to your body.
The truth is, caffeine is the ultimate chemical prankster. According to Medical News Today, adenosine is a chemical in our cells that promotes sleep and suppresses arousal. Normally, adenosine binds to adenosine receptors in the brain, causing cell activity to slow down. However, to an unsuspecting nerve cell, caffeine looks just like adenosine. As a result, the adenosine receptors bind to caffeine instead, leaving few left for the actual adenosine and causing cell activity to speed up instead of slow down.
When the pituitary gland notices this increase in cell activity, it assumes that there is an emergency and tells the adrenal glands to secrete adrenaline, the fight-or-flight hormone responsible for your extra energy and fast heartbeat. The release of dopamine, another stimulating hormone, is also increased. In other words, your beloved caffeine is not the real stimulant — it just tricks your body into releasing more of its natural stimulants.
Unfortunately for frequent caffeine consumers, the brain increases its amount of adenosine receptors as it begins to notice caffeine hogging them. 
This is what causes people to develop a tolerance for caffeine. When coffee regulars miss their daily dose, they experience withdrawal because the brain becomes overloaded with adenosine from all the extra adenosine receptors.
So now that you know how your coffee works, the next question to ask is whether it is good or bad for you. According to Rob van Dam, assistant professor in the Department of Nutrition at the Harvard School of Public Health and a coffee expert, there has been controversy over the topic because coffee is actually an extremely complex drink that contains hundreds of other compounds besides just caffeine. It is also sometimes difficult to separate the effects of coffee from the effects of other lifestyle choices that coffee drinkers may have. 
However, by conducting studies on coffee’s influence on very specific health effects, researchers have found some trends. The latest Harvard study, which also agrees with other recent research, seems to indicate that there is no relationship between coffee consumption and increased risk of death from cancer or cardiovascular disease. 
In fact, some studies have even shown that coffee consumption can reduce the risk of type 2 diabetes, Parkinson’s disease, liver cancer, and liver cirrhosis, although these studies merely demonstrate correlation and do not confirm causation. Of course, it is important to keep in mind that the subjects in these studies drank mostly black coffee or coffee with just a little bit of sugar and milk.
Overall, the consensus among the scientific community is that, unless you are drinking to the point that you have tremors or chronic insomnia, coffee is not detrimental to your health. So keep working on getting that Starbucks Gold Card — the rewards might not only include free drinks, but some extra health benefits.

Google teams up with Johnson & Johnson
This past Friday, Google and the pharmaceutical company Johnson & Johnson announced a partnership between Google’s life sciences division and Ethicon, a division of Johnson & Johnson that makes surgical products, to develop new robot-assisted surgery technologies. 
Some of the partnership goals include developing software that could highlight features of the body that are crucial but difficult to see, such as blood vessels, nerves, or the margins around a tumor, and also imaging technologies to give surgeons better visuals, all of which can be crucial to successfully removing cancer tumors. 
By pursuing this technology, it is evident that Google has ambitions far beyond Internet searching, especially with the creation of its life sciences division, which is part of the Google X research unit.

New headway on Alzheimer’s, heart disease
According to a report from the scientific community in Iceland this past week, in the process of exploring the nation’s genetic makeup, Icelandic scientists have uncovered an unknown gene pool with mutations that may play roles in causing ailments such as Alzheimer’s disease, gallstone, and even heart diseases.
While some diseases, like cystic fibrosis, are caused by a single genetic mutation, the most common ones are caused by multiple mutations, and mutations to a number of different genes can each raise the risk of getting heart disease or even breast cancer, for example. 
Many of these diseases, however, are rare, which means it is necessary to sample large groups of people in order to conduct research. This development is unprecedented in that it involves investigating a smaller group of people.

Possibility of alien life on Jupiter’s moon Europa
Europa, one of Jupiter’s moons, is one of the few places where life could potentially exist due to its icy ocean, researchers say. Researchers believe Europa to have an ocean up to 100 kilometers deep, which is 10 times deeper than any ocean on Earth. They also  have concluded that the moon could contain twice as much water as Earth, which would  meet one of the primary conditions for the existence of life as we know it.
Researchers also believe that they could deduce whether life on Europa is sustainable without actually visiting the moon itself, by investigating in Antarctica, which is the host to a number of hidden lakes. Antarctic lakes are the best analog we have for Europa’s hidden ocean, so, if life can endure the conditions under the Antarctic ice, the odds of finding it on Europa will improve.

Researches suggest an alternative approach to drugs
The discovery that switching various genes on or off may be able to provide a new treatment strategy other than drugs for various cancers, including breast cancers and ovarian cancers. Drugs often fail to reach the targeted area, proving to be useless, and in many cases even harmful as they affect healthy cells instead of cancerous ones. After trying to approach this problem with drugs, scientists in Australia have been fiddling with the cancerous tissue itself. 
“Maybe we can shift the tumor in the direction of the therapy rather than developing the therapy in the direction of the tumor,” says Rob Ramsay from the Peter MacCallum Cancer Centre in Melbourne, Australia. Along with new treatment development, this discovery could help give patients more information about their chances of survival.

Facebook tests laser drones in U.K. skies
Last Friday, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg announced to the world that various teams at Facebook have been testing large, solar-powered drones in the skies over the U.K. “As part of our internet.org effort to connect the world, we’ve designed unmanned aircrafts that can beam Internet access down to people from the sky,” said Zuckerberg in a blog post. “We’ve successfully completed our first test flight of these aircraft in the U.K.”
Ascenta, a Somerset, U.K.-based designer of solar-powered drones, developed the drones, which are designed to fly for months at a time at altitudes of 60,000 feet. The purpose of Facebook’s internet.org initiative is to connect at least another billion people to the Internet. The goal is to create new markets for the social network in order to add to the 1.39 billion monthly active users already on Facebook.

Fatty acids suggest the possibility of life on Mars
A molecule that could be a fatty acid, the equivalent of lard, has been found by NASA’s Curiosity Rover in the soil of the Red Planet. It is still unclear if the molecule originates from a biological source. David Glavin, who works on the rover’s Sample Analysis at Mars instrument, presented the findings at the Lunar and Planetary Science Conference in The Woodlands, Texas, last week. 
Researchers at NASA discovered that there are similarities between the gases released by samples of the fatty acid and various complex compounds on Earth. This might not be a direct sign of life, but it it does mean that Mars could be host to complex organic molecules, which suggests that microbes could be found there in the future.

This week’s article is dedicated to all those out there with a sweet tooth who will be celebrating Passover next week. 
Back in high school, I would celebrate “Cupcake Wednesday” every week with my friends at lunch. Each Tuesday night I would sit down with Martha Stewart, Betty Crocker, and some of my blogger best friends to find the perfect cupcake to bring in the next day. Except, I always forgot about Passover each time it came around. My friend Abby London was always left without a cupcake, and I felt so bad!
This year, even though I won’t be around to actually give her a special treat, I’m dedicating this recipe to her.
Just because leavening is off the table doesn’t mean that dessert has to be, too. I found this recipe when I fell down the rabbit hole of Pinterest. I like that it’s not only a really fun, unexpected flavor that brings back memories of elementary school packed lunches, but it’s also really quick and easy to make!
The gist of this recipe? Take the blank canvas of Rice Krispies treats that’s already almost as perfect as can be, and then add peanut butter. Marshmallow and peanut butter are such a great flavor combination that can only get better with the added crunch of the cereal and richness from the butter.
Fluffer Nutter Rice Krispy Treats
1/4 cup of unsalted butter
1 10-ounce bag of regular sized marshmallows
1/2 cup of peanut butter
5 cups of crispy rice cereal
1 1/4 cups of mini marshmallows
1 bag of Reese’s peanut butter chips
1 or 2 bags of mini Reese’s cups
Instructions
1) First things first: Either coat a 9x13 pan with cooking spray or line the pan with some parchment paper.
2) Melt butter in a pretty large pot over low heat. Then pour in the marshmallows. They’ll start to soften and eventually just melt into a soft shiny cream that will be tempting to dig into with nothing but a spoon and what little pride you might have left. But wait. Next, add in the peanut butter. It, too, will melt into the marshmallow butter sauce. It also might turn you on a little. Before your stimulated senses lead you astray, take it off the heat.
3) Before this concoction has too much time to cool down, stir in the cereal and make sure it’s evenly distributed so you don’t have any really sad pockets of dry cereal with globs of peanut butter elsewhere. Then when the mix is cool but not set, stir in the mini marshmallows by hand. This step is optional if you would rather not complicate things too much, but it really adds some fun to each bite! The marshmallow flavor can get buried under the peanut butter, so the mini ’mallows throughout really help to give that flavor a boost!
4) Dump the treats out into the pan, but don’t press down too hard while evening it out. After that, melt the peanut butter chips in the microwave at 30 second intervals, stirring in between. Spread the melted chips out across the treats, and before that hardens, sprinkle the mini Reese’s cups over the top: If you can bear it, try to wait at least a half hour for everything to set. It will be so worth it in the end. Because truly, these will blow your mind. AND they’re Kosher!
Looking for a few more Passover-appropriate dessert options? More kosher options (without nuts)?
Anything fruity is a great option! You could make any kind of fruit salad that your heart desires, or even a parfait. Layer some awesome seasonal fruits with any flavor yogurt or pudding in cups for yourself or your Seder guests. For an added treat, you can soak the fruits in some orange juice and sugar for an hour or so. This will make them extra juicy and flavorful.
Desserts that use egg whites also leave you with so many great choices. You can treat yourselves to some macaroons, meringues or even pavlovas! These are a little tricky to make, but store bought is usually still a great option.
You can also stick with a classic and indulge your sweet tooth with some Matzo. You can make an ice cream sandwich, spread some Nutella and top it with bananas, or my favorite — s’mores!

There are some art exhibits you can get lost in, wander for hours, feel time slip away as you move between paintings.
Visiting van Gogh, now on view at the Carnegie Museum of Art (CMOA), is not one of them.
Not from a lack of interesting material — to its credit, the exhibit does what it can with only four paintings on display. But despite being the museum’s main visiting exhibition, it’s better suited as a stop on a longer visit, not a main attraction.
The exhibit is contained to a small, peripheral room adjacent to the museum’s permanent collections. Security guards are badgered by guests who ask, “Is there another room? Is this really all?”
It’s easy to make the mistake of judging quality by quantity. The CMOA has pulled off highly interesting exhibits with only a few actual art works in the past. Just last June through September, Faked, Forgotten, Found was a brilliant and engaging exhibit detailing the journeys of four — yes, four — original paintings across centuries, between owners, and among forgeries of varying persuasiveness.
It’s been done before, but not here. Visiting van Gogh is interesting in an understated way, but it doesn’t seem to fully capitalize on the material it has or the incredibly recognizable name that accompanies it.
The first painting isn’t van Gogh’s. It’s his contemporary Paul Signac’s “Place des Lices, St. Tropez” — a pointillist work in golden yellow and orange offset by blue and green. A man sits on a bench in the shade of big-bowed trees with thick, undulating trunks and purple-spotted branches winding up to a swirl of green-blue foliage. There’s something distinctly van Gogh in the curving edge of the foliage, the leaves gathering in perfect, thoughtful circles, reminiscent of the whirling clouds in van Gogh’s “The Starry Night.”
Other than the friendship and clear influence between Signac and van Gogh, the painting’s inclusion isn’t well explained. The exposition describes Signac’s belief that certain colors evoked corresponding emotions — an idea with which van Gogh, too, experimented — but not much else related to the titular artist. In a larger exhibit, it’s common and enlightening to include the work of the main artist’s contemporaries — but in such a small exhibit, and with a weak apparent tie to the other three paintings, the Signac just seems out of place.
The painting helps to inform, however, the series of color theory information panels and activities on the adjacent wall. These panels detail a history of color theory from Sir Isaac Newton’s original 1660 black-and-white color wheel to the divisionist movement, which explored how separate dots of color interact optically when viewed together. The exposition sheds interesting light on the philosophy behind van Gogh’s legendary work and offers a lens for viewing the remaining three paintings.
Most interestingly, the museum recreated van Gogh’s caddy full of balls of yarn, explaining how the artist once sat facing the open box, twisting together yarn strands of different colors to see how the colors interacted optically before juxtaposing them in his paintings. We often remember van Gogh as the crazed man who sliced off his own ear, à la Kirk Douglas’s tortured portrayal in Lust for Life. It’s hard to imagine the artist sitting at a desk, winding yarn, pairing colors experimentally and thoughtfully. The yarn box an important reminder that planning, not just haphazard genius, plays into every great artist’s work.
The remainder of the exhibit takes us through van Gogh’s evolution from struggling twenty-something to Parisian resident to established artist poised to leave a legacy when he died in 1890. Van Gogh’s painting career didn’t start until the mid-1880s — toward the end of his life, during which he was extremely prolific. Though the original painting isn’t featured, the CMOA provides an image of van Gogh’s 1885 “The Potato Eaters” — a dark, realist painting in what was briefly van Gogh’s style before his art dealer brother recommended the lighter palette of the French impressionists.
An immediate contrast, “Le Moulin de la Galette” — the second featured painting — was created only a year later, but stylistically, couldn’t be more different. The tranquil, bucolic scene of windmill and chicken coop is characterized by soft greens and blues, the windmill blades barely sketched: You can imagine the tip of the brush just skimming the canvas. It’s still far removed from his later impressionist influences, but closer to his familiar pastel-dominated palette.
Van Gogh’s “Still Life, Basket of Apples” shows the artist grudgingly emulating some of his impressionist peers. The strokes are thicker, deliberate, even excessive compared to “Le Moulin de la Galette.” The crimson-outlined weave of the basket is swathed in heavy strokes of yellow and blue, lending the painting circular, swaddling movement. It’s clearly an early experiment, but it looks more like the van Gogh we know.
The final work in the exhibit, 1890’s “Wheat Fields After the Rain,” is van Gogh in his full glory. Thick, strong layers of green and yellow create linear movement in grass and the landscape stretching away from the viewer — strokes so thick that they cast shadows underneath them. It’s not just green, though: Mint, grass, lime, pine, teal, and turquoise complement and offset each other. Spots of white and red sketch indistinct wildflowers in the foreground, while wide robin’s-egg-blue curves depict clouds and sky overhead.
Though beautiful and focal to the exhibit, the placement of “Wheat Fields” is sudden after a four-year gap in van Gogh’s artistic career after “Le Moulin,” during which he was allegedly his most prolific, and yet the museum features no further works from this period. After “Wheat Fields,” viewers are left with a jarring and unsatisfying description of how the artist succumbed to suicide shortly after that painting was finished. It’s an unsettling transition, especially as we had been so carefully guided through the artist’s early stages, and yet we’re left to imagine what seemed like his most defining years. More exposition to ease the chronology would have been welcome.
If you’re a University of Pittsburgh or Carnegie Mellon student with free admission, Visting van Gogh alone may be worth the 10-minute walk down the street. But if you’re a non-affiliate, group this exhibit with others you’d like to see.

Dear Evan,
I’m a recent graduate and I have a bit of a dilemma; I could use your sage advice. The Stockholm syndrome has started to kick in, and I find that I’m starting to miss CMU. Now don’t get me wrong, I’m happy to be free from the stress and the homework, but I miss things like weird people and the freedom to be weird. I know I could get my dose of nostalgia and whatnot by coming to Carnival, but therein lays the problem. 
Adulthood has captured the free time and finances of my friends and former classmates, and I find I have no one to go to Carnival with. I would be down to go alone, maybe, but I don’t want to come off as the desperate alum trying to relive her youth, and I don’t want to pay a good chunk of change and fly across the country only to be that creepy person at Carnival who roams around by herself.
So, should I just get up early and watch Buggy in my PJs, or should I come to Carnival?
Best,
Nostalgic for Imbibing Cool, Opulent Liquors in English Department
Dear NICOLE’D,
You sound familiar. Do I know you from somewhere?
In any case, I congratulate you. You’re the first person to write in this school year that writes in an intelligible manner! You deserve accolades, flowers, smatterings of applause.
But yeah, adulthood sucks. As a second-semester senior, I should be celebrating loudly and fervently, but instead I feel this creeping wave of exhaustion and apprehension of what’s to come — I have to take responsibility for my own life, my choices, my budget. Perish the thought!
It seems like you’re feeling pretty lonely, too, so there’s only really one remedy for that: Come to Carnival. Screw the cost, and screw the people you think will look at you a little funny for being the alum wandering through the third-year-in-a-row Pirates of the Caribbean booth behind the group of tittering freshmen girls — it’ll be worth it. You know it’ll be worth it.
People aren’t going to care, anyway — they’ll be too busy trying not to be seen buying their fifth basket of deep-fried Oreos in a day.
Buggy in PJs still sounds fun, though,
Evan Kahn

Jeanne Theoharis gave a riveting lecture focused on breaking misconceptions about the legendary Civil Rights activist, Rosa Parks, to a captivated audience this past Wednseday.
A professor at Brooklyn College and author of the critically acclaimed book, The Rebellious Life of Mrs. Rosa Parks, Theoharis delved into Parks’ background as a civil rights activist at Giant Eagle Auditorium on March 25. Among her key points was how Parks’ famous bus protest was not mere coincidence, but stemmed from her years of fighting against racial injustice.
Theoharis’ dynamic and impassioned lecture painted Parks in a way that broke the image of her as just a tired, middle-aged woman who refused to get out of her seat. Parks was described as “feisty,” and as continuously asking others, “Why do you push us around?”
This rebellious spirit was evidenced by Parks’ history in the Civil Rights Movement. As a child, she would sit by her shotgun-wielding grandfather in the south who protected their home against racial violence. As an adult, Parks became interested in the movement, and a turning point came when she met fellow activist and future husband Raymond Parks in 1931, who was a lawyer in the infamous Scottsboro case.
Throughout the 1940s, Parks took a more prominent role in the fight against racial injustice. She joined her local NAACP chapter, becoming its Grand Secretary, and worked with other prominent Civil Rights leaders such as E.D. Nixon in fighting for voter registration and eliminating poll taxes. After years of her own struggle, Parks voted for the first time in 1945. Parks then continued to work with criminal justice issues, particularly by finding legal defense for cases where black men were being wrongfully accused of crimes and cases where the law was unresponsive to white brutality.
However, Parks’ history is not without its hardship, a feature overlooked by many. Due to her activism, she was often banned from working and faced immense economic problems. By the late 1940s, Parks had begun to burn out. In fact, early in 1955 (the same year as her famous bus protest), Parks stated that she believed the movement was out of her hands, but was the future of new generations. Yet, her perseverance and her attendance at the Highlander School that summer would rekindle her passion.
As Theoharis stated, it is this perseverance and also Parks’ knowledge of the movement that make her a true hero. Despite her hardships and her knowledge of the racial violence often taken against black activists, Parks continued to fight for civil rights. However, the reiterated fable that we are all familiar with loses these details and this agency — Parks’ action on the bus, though still heroic, reduces her to being a hero by chance, not a hero through her own virtues.
In fact, Theoharis dispelled several myths of the bus story during her lecture. First, Parks was not the first African American that refused to give up their seat on a bus. Others, including Parks, had done so and had been arrested in the past. Next, when Parks was asked to move from her seat, she did not merely state that she was tired after her job as a tailor. She understood the consequences of her actions, and takes this injustice as an opportunity to not consent to this treatment. Theoharis stated that it was only after the insistence of the bus driver that the police actually arrested her, and she was later released from jail that night, shaken but unharmed.
So why is Parks remembered as such a heroic and influential figure, if others had already conducted several similar protests?
One large factor of Parks’ legacy is her collaboration with E.D. Nixon. Nixon, a prominent white lawyer, saw Parks as a valuable test case. Parks had an “ideal image”: she was “working class in economics” and “middle class in demeanor”, making her relatable to other blacks. Most importantly, Nixon knew Parks’ spirit was unbreakable.
Theoharis continued that although Parks’ legacy is often left with her at the bus, she actually continued for the remainder of her life. Parks helped organize the highly intricate and methodically planned carpool system which made the Montgomery boycott of the bus system possible. This boycott, and other protests organized by Parks, would help propel civil rights leaders such as Martin Luther King Jr. into the national movement.
Following her move to Detroit, Parks continued to face economic hardships, but persevered, fighting for housing issues, freedom for political prisoners, and accessible education.
Theoharis’ lecture gave new insight on a legendary icon and true American hero. However, Parks’ life shows that with enough courage, perseverance, and faith, any individual can dramatically change the socioeconomic and political culture of our nation.
Most importantly, though, Theoharis’ talk opened  up a much needed dialogue in the humanities departments here at Carnegie Mellon, a dialogue about the ways in which historical narratives learned in high school affect the way students learn about history in college. For a school whose humanities are often overshadowed by other departments, talking about the ramifications of the way history is told is important in boosting the school’s awareness of the direction of the humanities, and keeps Dietrich on the cutting edge of such education.

Ten years ago, a massive TV phenomenon began. This program marked the beginning of ShondaLand and the rise of medical TV shows in primetime American television broadcasting. A year prior, FOX began airing a medical procedural drama which became a massive success: Grey’s Anatomy. Before that, ABC produced *Scrubs, a more comedic take on medical television, but broadcast it through NBC. Shonda Rhimes decided to make the show by mixing elements from other programs. She was able to develop a program that has accurate medicine in it, some procedural aspects to certain episodes, and an overarching story that centers on Meredith Grey and her colleagues. Through the years, the program has evolved, bringing in new characters and focusing more on the ensemble. After 11 seasons, the show has returned to its origins: it is more about Meredith than any other season in the show’s history.
With a marked absence from Derek (her husband) and Cristina (her person), the show has been able to take Meredith Grey out of her comfort zone and push her into situations where she has been forced to develop more completely as a character. This is part of what makes Grey’s Anatomy such an excellent show. Through the years, we have seen their relationship go through many obstacles and states of being. The actors, Ellen Pompeo and Patrick Dempsey, have shown palpable chemistry from the onset of the series, and their relationship has blossomed from Derek’s runaway affair to a loving marriage bound by a Post-It. This marriage has been struggling for the past two seasons with Meredith trying to have time for advancing her career and Derek feeling stuck in his. From the beginning of Season 11, Derek was itching to leave for Washington, D.C. (which he ends up doing), which basically made Meredith choose between doing what she loved in the place she has called home for most of her life, or follow Derek to Washington, D.C. and risk everything she has worked hard to achieve. Ultimately, she stays in Seattle and continues her marriage to Derek, bringing the hardships of long-distance relationships to the show.
Meanwhile, Meredith is also struggling because she has lost the most important relationship she has had since the inception of the program. Since Dr. Cristina Yang moved from Seattle, Meredith lost her “person.” This loss is suffered much more than the current state of her other relationships because she and Cristina had been through the same experiences at the same pace and struggled with very similar problems. Through those struggles they had created a bond that was essential for both of them; with that bond, they knew they could count on each other at all times. Feeling left outside of her comfort zone, without anyone to fall back on, she focuses on her work and her relationships with the rest of her colleagues. 
This season has also shown Meredith finding herself by delving into her past and the writings of her deceased mother. She does this not for herself, but for her newfound half-sister. The writers of this show have a knack for introducing stories that fit perfectly with the backstories of other characters and indulging the need for characters that shift focus, change relationships, and bring with them an entire trunk full of baggage.
This season has highlighted how alone Meredith feels and how much more driven she has become through it all. In the last episode she broke her streak; she had gone more than one month without a patient of hers dying. As some of you probably know, as an attending general surgeon of a high-profile hospital, there is a high probability that at least one of your patients will die during a shift. This is especially true if the hospital is prone to natural disasters and dramatic events, as is the Sloan-Grey Memorial Hospital where Meredith works.
Grey’s Anatomy works because the writers know the characters; they understand where they have come from and where they are going; they believe in certain relationships, and they flow seamlessly between background characters, guests, recurring characters, and the main cast.
Although the primary focus of this season has been on Meredith, a few subplots do recur throughout the season, and a sense of finality looms over all of the characters. Shonda Rhimes likes to tie up loose ends and give characters a well-deserved ending, so a lot of characters are getting their share of the spotlight. This has been most notable with Callie and Arizona’s relationship and Arizona’s efforts to become a fetal surgeon. This character has suffered through an amputated leg, a miscarriage, and a very recent separation from Callie; seeing her succeed and go through some extreme training was a welcomed change in pace and character progression. Finally, Shonda Rhimes is closing the show that has given her a rise to fame, that spawned a spin-off while it was still being broadcast, and inspired two telenovelas in Latin America. Grey’s Anatomy will be missed — it has graced American television for the past 10 years, and its impact will not go unnoticed.

This past Saturday, residents of the Carnegie Mellon community braved the cold to attend the inaugural Margaret Morrison Food Truck Block Party. There were several different food trucks present, including some old Carnegie Mellon favorites like Joe’s Doghouse, Tartans’ Express, and India on Wheels, as well as some new and exciting options from businesses in the Pittsburgh area. The event kicked off promptly at noon with live performances from groups including East End Mile, Ethan Bence, Arts Greenhouse, and The Treblemakers. In addition to the food and live performances, there were a variety of games available to the partygoers, such as “Pin-the-Tie on Suresh!” 
These performances, games, and exciting new food trucks were sure to present students with a promising afternoon. However, in addition to these events, there were also long lines. Though slightly overwhelming at first, it took more than these long lines and cold winds to keep everyone away from the food. 
First up on our food truck journey was Mac and Gold, Pittsburgh’s Original Mac ‘n’ Cheesery.  Although the line seemed quite long at first glance, we moved along at an impressive pace. We opted for the Barbeque Beef Brisket Mac n’ Cheese. Simply put, it was delicious. The perfectly cheesy mac and cheese was topped with barbeque brisket and crispy French fried onions. The other options, including the roasted butternut squash mac and cheese and the prosciutto and pea mac and cheese, also received positive reviews. The short wait time coupled with the great food made Mac and Gold a true crowd pleaser. 
Despite the cold weather, we were still greeted with happy and friendly faces by those working in the Bella Christie and Lil Z’s Sweet Boutique food truck. Bella Christie’s offered a variety of tasty treats, including cookies, cupcakes, cake pops, and all things chocolate-covered. The treats were very inexpensive, beautifully decorated, and quite delicious. We chose the chocolate covered Oreos, and were not in any way disappointed. The best part was the food truck’s lack of any line whatsoever. The Sweet Boutique quickly became a block party favorite.
Franktuary, which offered up classic hot dogs and fries, also became one of our favorites — taste wise, that is. The food was great, but getting to the food was a different story. The line, which appeared to be fairly short, looked promising at first. We were 30 minutes into waiting when we realized it might take slightly longer than previously estimated to acquire one of Franktuary’s grass-fed all-beef hotdogs. The bitter cold got the best of some of those waiting in line, but 45 minutes into waiting, we decided we had gone too far to back out now. We envied those in the fast-moving Mac and Gold queue as we waited, and waited, and waited. Eventually our order was placed after a wait time totaling one hour and 45 minutes. However, after receiving our food, we finally understood why so many others had waited this long for hot dogs and French fries — they were delicious. Although the wait was not ideal, it turned out to be a small price to pay.
Judging by the exceptionally long line at Taco Cho’s, which offered Korean Mexican Fusion style tacos, one might have assumed that it was a crowd favorite. But when we asked a fellow student, first-year materials science and engineering major Indorica Sutradhar, about her experience at Taco Cho’s, she described her tacos as “kind of cold” and “just okay.” Unfortunately, we heard similar responses from several others, as many found the tacos lackluster and not worth the wait. Perhaps the tent setup, as opposed to the standard food truck option, caused a few problems with cooking time and food quality. Although we were not able to personally attend Taco Cho’s because of the long queue, we were able to visit several others.
All in all, most of food offered at the Margaret Morrison Food Truck Block Party was pleasing, but the extremely long lines ended up leaving a sour taste in some mouths.

The internationally renowned Del Sol String Quartet graced Carnegie Mellon University with their presence at their concert in the College of Fine Art’s Kresge Auditorium Thursday night. Though the concert was free and open to the public, it was disappointing to see that there was only a smattering of audience members, maxing out around 50. The musicians — Benjamin Kreith and Rick Shinozaki, violin, Charlton Lee, viola, and Kathryn Bates, cello — played their hearts out anyway.
Based out of San Francisco, the Del Sol String Quartet has been focused on the future of music and its contemporary creators since the group was founded back in 1992. Known for innovative and fascinating art partnerships and their extensive commissioning of modern works, Del Sol has brought sounds from around the world to many audiences during their tenure. The quartet has seven albums, and played a piece off their most recent album Sculthorpe: The Complete String Quartets with Didgeridoo, at Carnegie Mellon.
The pieces played on Thursday night were all written by modern composers. The first piece they played was called “Fast Blue Village 2,” and was written in 2007 by Uzbekistani composer Elena Kats-Chernin. The piece began with an eerie synchronized introduction from the cello and the viola. During the course of the piece, two or three of the instrumentalists would have phrases played in synchronization. This gave the piece the nice ebb and flow of coming together and moving apart, giving the audience a resolution periodically, and adding structure to the shape of the piece. The piece sounded incredibly sad and a little angry as it finished out the last eight measures or so with choppy and harsh notes played by all four musicians simultaneously. According to the program, “Fast Blue Village 2” was created “from material to be played by a set of robots designed by Roland Obeiter” and indeed, you could tell.
The second piece was introduced by the violist, Charlton Lee, who talked about the nature of the piece as “taking the old with the new.” The piece — “Calligraffiti” — written by Chinese composer Huang Ruo in 2009, mixes the traditional word “calligraphy” with “graffiti” and plays off that theme during the course of the piece. Lee described the piece as being reminiscent of what it was like to grow up in a Chinese family in the United States, due to Ruo’s mixing of “something so authentic with something so profane.” “Calligraffiti” began with a high wavering whisper from the cello, before others joined in with a whispery tone. Playing with very little pressure and close to the bridge on these stringed instruments, the piece of music trod the line between ugly and pretty noises. Other less traditional tones, liberal use of artificial harmonics, and minimal vibrato also gave the piece an exceptionally unique feel. Occasionally one musician of the bunch would play with a clear strong tone, and it felt like a breath of fresh air. I began to find myself wishing for more of these interludes, as I am a person not familiar with contemporary chamber music, and the weird scratchy tone often confused me. Ultimately the dichotomy between the clear tone and the rest of the tones played by the musicians was part of what the piece was all about, and I was intrigued having experienced something so innovative.
The third piece was the piece from their album. Though played without the didgeridoo part, String Quartet No. 14 “Quamby” still called to mind the imagery of the Tasmanian shore its composer hailed from. Reminiscing on life as a child, Peter Sculthorpe wrote the piece about cliffs he used to walk on as a child, and the experience of watching the birds and thinking about the cliffs’ history. The word “Quamby,” the name of a certain bluff, means “save me” or “mercy.” The piece is in four movements, though all were connected by a general feeling of loneliness and wonder. The first movement’s long and dramatic phrasing sounded kind of like the beautiful sweeping melodies of the Pride and Prejudice film from 2005, though played in a completely minor key. The third movement featured some gull sounds mimicked perfectly on the cello. All in all this piece was my favorite of the evening, managing to convey a whole story in just four short movements.
The second half of the concert began with Italian composer Stefano Scodannibio’s take on Monteverdi’s famous madrigals. “Mas Lugares (su Madrigali di Monteverdi)” did indeed use melodies and harmonies found in the madrigals, but explored these well known songs using new texture and strange harmonic couplings. During his introduction of the piece, violinist Benjamin Kreith talked about how “tactile” a composer Scodannibio was, and that became aggressively apparent during the course of the piece. Maybe because I’m kind of a wimp, I found myself wishing that the pieces were played with traditional tone and emphasis, as I am not used to hearing such husky and squeaky sounds. Though I can appreciate the creative and textured piece, it definitely is not one that is going on my listening list.
The concert ended with a piece written by a member of Carnegie Mellon School of Music faculty, Professor Reza Vali, who hails from Iran. His piece “Gâtâr (Calligraphy No. 11)” used the Persian modal system, instead of a Western modal system. This made the intervals in the piece sound very different from the intervals audiences are accustomed to hearing in, say, Mozart. It was the Pittsburgh premiere of this piece and the third piece of Valli’s the quartet has played. The piece included frequent solos from the instrumentalists, and often seemed to include portions of call and response. The response to the piece was enthusiastic and Professor Vali joined the musicians on stage for a final bow.
It was wonderful to attend a performance from individuals who are on the forefront of contemporary chamber music, and it only made me wish that more people had gone to see the performance. The innovative use of tone quality, harmony, and articulate storytelling provoked me to consider what I think of as beautiful chamber music, and where I think chamber music is going. For a genre so rooted in the music of its historical greats, I think it is important to put down the Beethoven once in a while and look to the future.

Before I studied abroad, I hadn’t left the confines of North America. Sure, I had been on trips to Canada with my family and several high school clubs, but that was the extent of my international travels. After just under two months studying abroad,  I have now been to three new countries. I’ve explored several cities in France, where I can somewhat easily navigate and communicate with locals. But I’ve also been to countries where I had to hope that the people I encountered would be able to speak English or at least be willing to mime their way through a conversation with me.
I tend to be an organized person who makes a plan and follows through with it. The idea that I would get lost, have to look at a map, have to ask questions, and maybe have to take a few detours along the way was honestly frightening.
Somehow, though, during my time here, I have learned how to relax, let go, and just go with the flow. And that is how I have had some of the most memorable experiences of my life. I took a day trip to a place I had never heard of, with no idea what I would do there, and ended up exploring a charming town with a rich history and beautiful sights. I had a delicious home-cooked dinner after going home with a Danish family I met at a brewery tour in Copenhagen. I have had conversations with people who come from cities I can barely pronounce in countries that I have only vaguely heard about. I have ended up in bars and clubs that I will never be able to place on a map where people come up to me simply because they want to practice their English and hear about the United States, and those discussions have been some of the most riveting in my life.
I have tried to find museums or stores and ended up wandering parks so vast and beautiful they made me forget I was in the middle of one of the largest cities in the world.
Spontaneity has been my greatest ally during my time here. While I may sometimes feel uneasy about not having a concrete plan, it’s also incredibly liberating to realize that I can go anywhere and do anything that I want. This will probably be the only chance I have to live in a foreign country and feel like I have no real responsibilities holding me down, so I have decided to take this time to be young and free.
I have learned how to live in the moment. While that sometimes means missing the last metro home and having to pay for a taxi, or getting caught in the rain without an umbrella, nothing has gone horribly wrong so far. And even if it does, that’s just the way life works. No matter how hard we plan, we never know exactly how it will turn out, so why not welcome every unexpected experience, every chance that is presented to make a connection and meet some new people? It just may change your life.

It may not seem like it yet, but it will soon soon be time to shed jackets and sweatshirts for T-shirts. With warm rays on the way, it may be tempting to throw work out the window in lieu of a day playing frisbee on the Cut.
But for those without time to relax, the warm weather is not off limits. There is no reason to tackle work inside when there are so many outdoor locations on campus to sit back, relax, and get down to work.
Following are some of the best places to work with the benefit of fresh breezes. Many of these locations are secluded and immune to the noise of campus, making them the perfect places to boost productivity.
The Hobbit Hole
Located just outside the main entrance to Baker Hall, this study spot on the Mall is not visible to the average passerby. A work area carved out of a hill, this space is likened by many students to Bilbo Baggins’s house from J.R.R. Tolkien’s The Hobbit, and is the perfect spot to hide away in when work begins to pile up.
Not only are there a number of spacious benches to spread papers out upon, but there are outlets to juice up devices when their battery power runs low. Also, the hubbub from the Cut seems to fade away after descending into the carved out area. Noise from WRCT’s speakers and students promoting their organizations’ causes outside Doherty Hall are not an issue here. The sun shines pretty brightly on the benches, but it’s possible to pick up work and move to the shade of a nearby tree when the heat becomes unbearable.
Tepper School Courtyard
Want a space to work outside, but need the comfort of mortar and bricks to focus? The courtyard inside the Tepper School of Business may be the perfect place. This open area at the center of the building is equipped with a number of tables and outlets, as well as access to the open sky. At night, there are lamps, although turning them on can be confusing. There’s always back-up light streaming through the windows of the building, though, which makes this space a feasible place to work into the early hours of the next morning, if needed. Plus the courtyard is closed off to the bustle inside the building during the day, so noise is not a problem.
If it rains, there is a spacious room right next to the courtyard with doors that open out onto it. Prop them open to escape the water, but still get that feeling of being outside.
Beneath the Pausch Bridge
The Randy Pausch Bridge is one of the most well-known and well-traveled places on campus. At night its rainbow lights at make it hard to miss, and the penguins on its walls bring a sense of intrigue to the structure.
But what is less well-known about the bridge is the great shaded study space it provides below. There is a nice patch of grass just below the bridge equipped with a single bench. Few travelers pass through this way, so noise is not a problem. While there are no outlets to charge devices, the area below the bridge offers a nice reading area. Print out papers and skim away.
Tennis Courts
On either side of the tennis courts are two perfect places to study. Between Margaret Morrison Hall and the courts is an area that was just refurbished with chairs to lounge in and watch the matches... or do work. This area provides a zen atmosphere that could make you feel like you’re in Florida.
On the other side of the courts is a nice grassy hill that everyone on campus knows about. The hill is tiered, meaning there are various flat elevation points on it to spread out work.
The only downside to these locations is the noise that they attract. At the center of campus, these places are almost never completely quiet due to the number of people who pass by them at all times of the day. Nevertheless, if noise is not a hindrance, these locations are some of the most easily accessible, and both get strong Wi-Fi signals.
Gesling Stadium Bleachers
The football stadium’s bleachers don’t only have to serve spectators on the weekends. They can also serve students hoping to get in a few extra hours of studying. The bleachers are essentially flat slabs that span a large portion of the East Campus Garage, giving students plenty of real estate to use. They can be quiet if not too many people are on the field and traffic isn’t too heavy on Forbes Avenue on the opposite side of the garage.
If some cover is preferable, Tartans Pavilion across the way offers a view of the stadium and an open atmosphere to the outside on days when it is nice. Access to Wi-Fi is questionable on the bleachers, but easily attainable at Tartans Pavilion.

The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies
If you are a big fan of Legolas, or are itching to see Martin Freeman onscreen before the long awaited fourth season of Sherlock premieres later this year,  The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies is playing this Friday to give you your Lord of the Rings fill. In this third installment of The Hobbit franchise, Bilbo Baggins (Freeman) pulls out all the stops in his attempts to save Middle Earth from obliteration due to the heavy-handedness and pride of various armies. Five armies to be exact. Elves, dwarves, orcs, men, and eagles angrily wield a variety of weapons in the hopes of defeating wonderfully colorful opponents. Unreciprocated love, fancy gems, people with pointy ears: this film has got them all. With sweeping panoramas that are guaranteed to make you want to visit New Zealand, The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies is a bombastic and exciting final film of this beloved fantasy trilogy.
Inherent Vice
One of the biggest crime drama flicks of 2014, Inherent Vice features an all-star cast. Joaquin Phoenix stars as a perpetually high private detective, who is hired by his ex to help her current lover escape the nefarious plans of his wife. When there is a disappearance — which is really only semi-surprising — Phoenix (known as "Doc") has to pursue various suspects in a world filled with surfers and cops, suspects and moderately normal people, all fueled and muddled by excessive marijuana. The cast includes stellar performances from Reese Witherspoon, Jena Malone, Josh Brolin, and Owen Wilson, among others. Filled with laughs and inanity, Inherent Vice is a great movie to see with your friends when you can't decide on any other movie that you would like to see. Also, the more people who you attend the movie with, the more likely it is that somebody will understand it.

Senior electrical and computer engineering major Peter McHale and biological sciences major Shalini Ray gave lectures on Monday in Porter Hall on how they achieved their success at Carnegie Mellon University. The First Lectures are hosted by the Undergraduate Student Senate in homage to Randy Pausch’s Last Lecture. 
At these lectures, seniors speak about how they achieved their own success, what they learned along the way, and the wisdom they want to pass on about how to lead one’s life.
McHale spoke first, opening the lecture with the words, “I will be very honest and sincere for both my successes and failures.”
McHale has taught two StuCos. He learned a lot from them, possibly more than his students learned from him, he said. McHale believes that StuCos are a great opportunity for first-year students to learn from upperclassmen, as they are places where “students are accessible to students.”
McHale said that at Carnegie Mellon, he is “surrounded by geniuses.” He said that he was successful during his four years at Carnegie Mellon because “I failed so much in leadership. “
McHale first failed at leadership through Solar Splash, a group on campus that makes solar-powered boats. He said that, while he led a great team, he could not provide adequate directions when his team looked to him to lead. He said that to lead, a person has to be 100 percent passionate about the task that they are leading.
From his various leadership experiences, McHale learned that it is necessary to focus more on the team than on the end result. “If you invest in the people they notice and they react to it,” he said.
McHale also stressed the importance of people inside and outside of Carnegie Mellon. 
Key people who influenced McHale include assistant teaching professor in the School of Computer Science David Kosbie, his dad, and his high school best friend.
“You are surrounded by really amazing people,” McHale said. “You learn a lot about yourself by learning from others.”
McHale said that his final year at Carnegie Mellon has been hard because he is often anxious. He also said that a friend he was close to all four years grew apart from him, although he did not want that to happen. 
He said that he became cynical with his education at Carnegie Mellon; he just wanted to do something he was excited about.
“I think this is a conversation that we need to have,” McHale said about anxiety and depression. “Anxiety and depression are some obstacles that I tried to overcome with my senior year ... Everyone should never be in a place where you are just looking for another part of life.”
McHale’s final point in his lecture was the investment in people. He emphasized “hanging around people who just keep you up.” 
He said that it is important to enjoy hanging out with people and that he and his friends compliment each other often.
“We really do respect each other and compliment each other,” he said. “So the conversation is always exciting.”
McHale noted that leadership is not just about the  team, but everyone. It is very important to pay attention to people and learn from them, he ended.
Ray opened her presentation by telling the audience that although she is heavily involved on campus and in other activities, she is not perfect.
Through her time at Carnegie Mellon, Ray learned to find balance. Her number one priority is, “Put health first, make sure to eat properly, get enough sleep, and focus on things that really matter.”
She realized that “it is not the smallest things that matter; it is how you come out of the situation that matters.”
Last year was extremely difficult for Ray as her dad suffered through ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm. He lived for five-and-a-half months before passing away.
“I cried more in those five months more that all I ever cried in my entire life,” Ray said. “You know, it was difficult mainly because I felt like I had the world on my side — senior year was perfect. I thought I wanted to work at NASA that summer ... But the world just crashed down at me in one day.”
Ray said the support system at Carnegie Mellon helped her get through that time. She described a support network of students, faculty, and staff who have shaped her into who she has become today.
To Ray, “People are the most valuable aspects in my life.” She reminded the audience to “never miss an opportunity to make connections, friendship.”
Ray ended her lecture with what she called 10 cheesy pieces of wisdom, including such things as being nice to people even though not everyone will be a fan of you, what doesn’t kill you makes you stronger, and always laugh or smile because it will brighten up a room.
“Really inspire other people and be a role model to them,” she ended.
Throughout the lecture, she reminded everyone to remember that it is always possible to come out of something by having mental strength, as well as friends and family to create a support network.
The First Lectures series was hosted by the Undergraduate Student Senate. The next event will be held on Monday, April 20 at 4:30 p.m., and will feature seniors Sean Archie and Joanna Latini.

University administrators, faculty, staff, and students met in Posner Hall last Wednesday for the last of three campus-wide town halls to refine Carnegie Mellon’s Strategic Plan. The meetings are a precursor to the finalized Strategic Plan, which the university expects to announce at the beginning of next semester.
The Strategic Plan, an initiative announced at the beginning of this academic year, is built on three main pillars: Transformative Teaching and Learning; Transformative Research, Creativity, Innovation, and Entrepreneurship; and The Transformative CMU Experience. A different team of administrators and faculty leads each focus of the Strategic Plan.
During the town hall, leaders from each focus area discussed how they were approaching their concentration and what initiatives they had come up with. Nathan Urban, interim provost, spoke about Transformative Teaching and Learning.
“Our students are not choosing to take intellectual risks … We want to encourage intellectual exploration,” Urban said. He outlined several possibilities for addressing this problem, including making more courses pass/fail, putting a cap on the number of units that students can take each semester, and ensuring that a course’s units accurately reflect the amount of work involved in that course.
Darrin Willis, a senior electrical and computer engineering major, said that the unit system was ineffective for him, because almost all of his classes are 12 units. “When I first arrived, I thought it was very nice that there was a unit system, because I thought it would allow for both harder classes and less strenuous classes,” Wilson said. “It would be interesting to see what it would look like if we had more 18-unit classes that were part of the standard curriculum, or other numbers of units.”
Next, Richard Scheines, dean of the Dietrich College of Humanities and Social Sciences, proposed a method for engaging students in interdisciplinary work. Scheines outlined a curriculum in which students would begin learning about a topic during their first year, and carry their work with that topic through a senior capstone project that would focus on interdisciplinary research.
Vice President for Research Farnam Jahanian spoke next about Transformative Research, Creativity, Innovation, and Entrepreneurship. This focus area was broken down further into four smaller categories: reputation, environment, culture, and infrastructure.
Jahanian spoke most about methods for improving Carnegie Mellon’s environment and culture by fostering a more inclusive dialogue on campus between faculty and students and working to “provide the foundation for our students, staff, and faculty to be leaders in their life [sic],” according to the slides that accompanied his presentation.
Vice President for Campus Affairs Michael Murphy and Dean of Student Affairs Gina Casalegno led the discussion on the last focus of the Strategic Plan, The Transformative CMU Experience.
Murphy began by asking audience members, “What kind of lives do we want to lead?”
Casalegno outlined ways to create a “transformative Carnegie Mellon experience,” speaking on behalf of Vice Provost for Education Amy Burkert, who could not attend the town hall. Casalegno suggested an “innovation term” — an I-term — a period of time during which students could be on Carnegie Mellon’s campus, but without the pressures of their everyday academic lives.
Erik Pintar, an electrical and computer engineering major and fifth-year scholar, said that an I-term would be the ideal time for students to learn and work together without the burden of their coursework. “It’s not often that students are at Carnegie Mellon without a lot of work, without a lot happening,” he said. “And I think that time when we do, when we don’t have work hanging over our heads, could allow that open thinking and the free time to be together and think with other students, without thinking about grades and organizations and things like that.”
Murphy emphasized the potential of everyone within the Carnegie Mellon community. “What we inherit at this place is enormous, enormous talent…. In an extraordinary community with extraordinary people, there’s an opportunity to go beyond.”

Board of Trustees members have pledged to contribute $20 for each senior that donates $5 until Commencement.
The pledge has the potential to raise more than $27,000, according to Student Body President (SBP) and senior electrical and computer engineering and business administration double major Ian Glasner.
Glasner announced the giving initiative to the student body by email, saying, “Give today, and turn your $5 into $25.”
The initiative, which Glasner has been working on for the past few months, arose from conversations that he had with Chairman of the Board of Trustees Ray Lane in late February, when the two met at a Board event in San Francisco. After their initial talks, the Board voted to approve the idea.
“Senior giving is a benchmark similar to alumni giving in that there’s no way to really poll students or alumni as to whether they enjoyed their experience,” said Assistant Director of Annual Giving Nicole Atwell via email. “Giving is a proxy for that.... The thought is that if they find the value in their degree and care about the future of the school, they’ll give back and invest in the school to help others have the same great experience.”
According to Atwell, President Subra Suresh has been working on raising the giving rate, both from alumni and current students since he took office in 2013. 
When Glasner took office as SBP, he helped to found the Proud to Be Plaid Committee, which focuses on increasing student giving. Nearly 700 undergraduate students have given this year, and almost 300 of those are senior gifts.
Atwell attributed these numbers from overall undergraduates to such initiative’s as the Student Athlete Advisory Board’s challenge to have all student-athletes give back this year, as well as CMU Crowdfunding, an initiative started this year to fund student organizations and endeavors by the larger campus community through a website similar to Indiegogo.
Atwell also attributed the donations rates among seniors to the efforts of a new Proud to Be Plaid Committee. Glasner founded the Proud to Be Plaid Committee at the beginning of the year to increase the senior giving rate. He enlisted the help of sophomore math major Connie Yang and sophomore statistics major Michael McCaffrey to head the committee. Yang and McCaffrey led discussions on the best ways to increase student giving participation.
Peer-to-peer conversations and targeting Greek communities, as well as outreaching with Highland Ambassadors and Andrew Carnegie Scholars, seem to be the most effective ways to encourage student giving, particularly in seniors, said Atwell.
Other peer schools have been doing senior gift drives for years. At the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), 76 percent of seniors gave back last year.
“That sort of giving rate and the ability to educate students as to why giving is important also shows in schools such as MIT’s undergraduate alumni giving rates,” Atwell wrote. These giving rates are the numbers used for rankings such as those provided by U.S. New & World Report.
Glasner expressed hope that the initiative would work to increase CMU’s endowment, which, like the giving rates, is “minuscule” compared to peer institutions.
“Ray [Lane] was excited about this idea because he, like me, understands the importance of giving back to Carnegie Mellon,” Glasner said. “When it comes down to it, student giving is not about the money. It’s about the participation rate.”
The trustees’ gifts will add to the nearly $1 million that they already give annually and the larger, multi-year initiatives they contribute to individually not included in the $1 million, according to Atwell. The money donated by board members will be put  into either an endowed scholarship or a physical gift on campus, while the gifts that seniors give will go to wherever they designate them.
“I know we can do better,” Atwell said. “With continued support from the administration and from committed student volunteers and donors, we’ll definitely get there.”
Glasner agreed, saying “We all have the same goals at heart — to leave CMU a better place than we found it. And [giving] is a great way to go about accomplishing that.”

Three years ago, Carnegie Mellon students received an email to participate in the Carnegie Mellon University Student Experience Study (CMU-SES). Now, they are being asked to participate in it again.
Dean of Student Affairs Gina Casalegno and Vice Provost for Education Amy Burkert sent out an email asking students to fill out this year’s CMU-SES survey, closing on April 2. The university uses the results of the online study, sent out to the entire student body, to understand the impact of various experiences in and out of the classroom.
The Office of Institutional Research and Analysis helps to create the CMU-SES surveys, according to Casalegno. The information will be used to understand how the demographics and experiences that characterize students relate to students’ perceived confidence and abilities.
Casalegno said in the email that the survey is designed to pinpoint how these characterizing factors affect students’ abilities. For example, the survey could help to show whether taking on leadership positions make students more confident at problem solving. The survey could also show whether certain characteristics of students affect their personal well-being.
This year’s survey is very similar to the 2012 survey, which will allow university workers to study and compare the answers from students who take the survey both years.
“This longitudinal group is very interesting to us as it will give an even fuller sense of the ‘Carnegie Mellon effect’ on the outcome areas,” Casalegno said via email. “Those who complete both surveys will provide us an additional cohort for analysis, providing a ... group for whom we have results that spans their Carnegie Mellon experience.”
About 900 undergraduate students and 450 graduate students who are still enrolled at Carnegie Mellon took the survey in 2012. The results of the 2012 survey were shared at many in-person meetings with groups such as the Undergraduate Student Senate and the Graduate Student Assembly. The survey results were also shared with campus members like academic advisers, staff in the Division of Student Affairs, and academic deans and associate deans.
“This allowed for robust discussion and reflection with the research team to further inform our reflections on the results,” Casalegno said in the email. The information will not be published online and will not be shared with anyone outside of the university.
“We are very careful with results such as these to ensure that they are not misinterpreted or generalized inappropriately,” Casalegno said in the email about reasons for not openly distributing the information. “When talking about people’s experiences and abilities, it is important to limit presumptions that one might draw from a cursory look at the material. I anticipate that we will use a similar strategy with this survey as well.”
Campus members can expect to know the results of the study early in the fall semester, according to Casalegno.
While the university does not distribute the study’s results for other national studies, the university uses the survey’s findings to prepare other reports and documents like accreditation reviews and board reports. Casalegno said that the 2012 survey has allowed the university to shift funding in order to support new programs, make changes to existing programs, and change staff and faculty development programs.
Students who complete the survey receive a free treat at Entropy+, as well as 100 points to spend at a Survey Thank You Shop on items like free food at local restaurants, movie passes at local theaters, and university gear.

Braille-teaching technology wins prize
A device developed within the Robotics Institute won $20,000 as the winner of the 2014 Louis Braille Touch of Genius Prize for Innovation.
The device teaches students how to write Braille with a slate and stylus, according to a university press release. It was developed by research group TechBridgeWorld. Students began working on the device, called the Braille Writing Tutor, in 2006. It has been tested in such countries as Bangladesh, India, and Tanzania.
The device has the potential to service areas of the world where Braille typewriters are not easily accessible.
The hardware specifications and software can be downloaded online for others wishing to build similar devices, according to the release.
Members of TechBridgeWorld also developed a version of the device that relies on batteries for areas that do not have access to reliable power sources.
“The Braille Writing Tutor has been one of our most successful projects to date,” said M. Bernardine Dias, director and founder of TechBridgeWorld, in the release. “We’ve seen the profound impact it has on blind and visually impaired students and their teachers in communities where we have been fortunate to test the tutor.”
Dias is also an associate research professor of robotics.
TechBridgeWorld’s mission includes implementing technology to meet development needs across the globe. The group aims to leverage relationships with others in developing areas to understand technology’s global influence. The group lists two main principles on its website: “sharing expertise to create innovative and locally suitable solutions, and empowerment of indigenous populations to create sustainable solutions.”
Former post-doc visits British Parliament to present research
Euan Wielewski is a former post-doctoral research associate at Carnegie Mellon. He worked with professor of physics Robert Suter and professor of materials science and engineering Marc De Graef on research regarding X-ray and electron diffraction, according to his LinkedIn profile.
Now he is a faculty member at the University of Glasgow and one of 210 researchers who presented to the British Parliament for a poster competition hosted by SET for Britain. SET for Britain aims to promote the country’s “early-stage and early-career research scientists, engineers, technologists, and mathematicians,” according to its website.
“This annual competition is an important date in the parliamentary calendar because it gives [members of Parliament] an opportunity to speak to a wide range of the country’s best young researchers,” said Andrew Miller, chairman of the Parliamentary and Scientific Committee in a university press release.
Wielewski presented research from his time at Carnegie Mellon, as well as from his time at Cornell University. Wielewski’s research focused on determining the reliability of certain materials used to make jet engine parts.
“Presenting our research at the House of Parliament was a real honor and a great experience,” said Wielewski in the release. “It’s rare that early career researchers get the opportunity to talk to politicians about their work.”

This year, the candidates running for Student Body President (SBP) and Student Body Vice President (SBVP) have each provided at least one promising goal to the student body. 
JR Marshall and Jibby Ayo-Ani have proposed to increase the number of students trained to be part of the Survivor Support Network (SSN), while Divya Kothandapani and Mark Whiting have promised to bridge the gap between graduates and undergraduates, something that is sorely needed. Evan Wineland and Connie Yang have proposed to raise student wages and expand students' contact with the city of Pittsburgh. 
All of the above portions of these students' platforms seem like worthwhile pursuits for the next SBP and SBVP to tackle. However, many of the other proposed initiatives in their agendas seem unnecessary or unfeasible. I do not foresee high levels of involvement for Marshall's proposal for a reorientation day or Wineland's proposal for a student-faculty lunch program. Kothandapani's proposal for improved apps, while nice, does not seem as important as some of the already listed initiatives proposed by other candidates. These initiatives will either fail or not provide substantial change to our campus. I am not putting down these initiatives to lambaste the candidates' platforms. 
Instead, I am reviewing both the promising and the less promising positions to shed light on the fact that each running pair has at least one major initiative in their platform worth pursuing, as well as some that are not worth pursuing. If the winning candidate were able to tackle the most important initiatives from each platform, they would have an undeniably strong presidency.
I'm writing to urge the winners of this year's Student Senate debates to consider inviting the other serious candidates (sorry, Saif Jedidi and Ben Debebe) to their cabinet, and for the pairs who do not win the elections to accept those invites. While, of course, not all candidates can win the positions of SBP and SBVP, their proposed initiatives should not die with their campaign. Instead, the winning pair must consider working with their former competitors during the following academic year, in order to provide tangible change before the next election season. 
With such highly motivated pairs of candidates (this year has seen more effort put into platforms and campaigning than previous years), it seems a shame that many of the important initiatives proposed will fall to the wayside, only to be replaced by less important initiatives like DineX expansion, student-faculty lunches, and improved apps.
In an ideal world, I would like to see the next SBP and SBVP tackling three equally ambitious goals—like increasing SSN participation, bridging gaps in our student body, and increasing student wages—rather than having one or two important proposals get dragged down by less important initiatives, which are often proposed almost every year (when is the last time we [ital]weren't[ital] promised better faculty-student relations and expanded shuttle services?).
Pulling the most important initiatives from each platform would ensure that there are no fluff goals for the next SBP and SBVP to tackle. But in order to make three ambitious goals achievable, the winning pair must consider working with the people who first proposed them, since these are the people who have thought most about these initiatives and probably have the best connections to make them happen.
If I were to have my way, the next SBP and SBVP would choose the most important initiative from each running pair's platform, and tackle those three goals, rather than tackling one good initiative paired with a few lesser initiatives. If I had my way, all candidates would be in the winner's cabinet to make these goals possible. With all candidates working together, I can imagine a SBP and SBVP pair that could enact true change on campus in multiple substantial areas.

When the Sigma Alpha Epsilon chapter at the University of Oklahoma was revealed as a collection of racists who used drunkenness as an excuse for their actions, one of the few bright spots I could see in the story was the statement made by the University President and former United States senator David L. Boren in response to the leaked videos. When the allegations emerged, Boren took a strong stance. 
“These people have acted in a way that is absolutely reprehensible and disgraceful. I don’t have words in my vocabulary to adequately describe how I feel about people who would use those words in that way, and chant in that way,” said Boren, according to The New York Times.
I’m glad that there hasn’t been a scandal of similar magnitude during Subra Suresh’s term as Carnegie Mellon’s president, but it does bother me that I have no idea what sort of reaction I could expect. 
Right before spring break, Carnegie Mellon had a bad week in the press. Hundreds of rejected students received acceptance emails due to a software error, an embarrassing development for a university known largely for its computer science program. A few days after that story broke, a mentor in first-year housing turned himself into the Pittsburgh Police Department for invading the privacy of multiple students. Though the incident had occurred months before, the university only informed the general population after news media broke the story.
It is not technically the university president's role to talk to the student body about bad news. The Dean of Student Affairs is generally given that task, working to portray the university and its administration in the best light possible. But it seems to me that President Suresh should be clearly involved with the campus community, and that as the leader of our community he should be an active and frequently heard voice in that community. 
Since he has taken office, President Suresh’s communications to the students have largely consisted of announcing new donations to fund the Simon Initiative and ProSEED or providing updates on the construction of the new Tepper Quadrangle. Also frequent are important announcements regarding the departure and appointment of important administrative positions. Reminders about speeches and information about important developments such as this are, of course, part of his job.
One of the few exceptions to President Suresh's typical communications is an email sent out in August after the death of Michael Brown at the hands of the Ferguson Police Department and the subsequent nationwide protests. In the email, Suresh reminds us that we need to have an open dialogue and respectful atmosphere in order to deal with the issues of race and prejudice, even if he doesn’t go into any specifics. 
It’s a political email designed not to offend anybody and it’s understandable, but it also closes with a reminder about the recent expansion of Martin Luther King Jr. Day. In this email, which urged attendance of day’s events, more is said about a speaker for a Simon Initiative event than any of the other activities for the day.  
There’s nothing technically wrong with the communications sent out by President Suresh’s office. However, the president is ultimately responsible for the entire school, not just sending out good news about funding for programs and projects that are unlikely to directly impact most current students. 
It’s understandable that President Suresh doesn’t want to use his position for politics and wants to avoid controversy. But the community would benefit from hearing from our leader when it has nothing to do with the nebulously defined Simon Initiative, or when the news is bad. I urge Subra Suresh to communicate more frequently with his students, to be a presence with simply stated stances on issues that impact us, who is not afraid to express opinions and help us understand his vision for our school.

Last Monday, Senator Ted Cruz kicked off the 2016 presidential election season by announcing his candidacy for president. Throughout his speech, titled "The Promise of America," Cruz invited his audience to imagine an America governed by his policies. So I invite you to do the same. Imagine, if you will, the promise of Ted Cruz’s America. 
Policy one: “Imagine innovation thriving on the Internet as government regulators and tax collectors are kept at bay and more and more opportunity is created.”  
Here, Cruz is referring to net neutrality. You may remember his infamous “Net neutrality is Obamacare for the Internet” tweet. The truth is, net neutrality keeps the internet exactly as it is now: free and open. All it does is prevent Internet service providers from biasing the way they provide service. Providers can’t, for instance, speed up or slow down websites based on extra fees or contract negotiations. You don’t have to imagine innovation thriving on the Internet, because that’s what is happening right now. And net neutrality keeps it that way. 
Policy two: “Imagine America finally becoming energy self-sufficient as millions and millions of high-paying jobs are created.” 
Cruz must be talking about a future fueled by sustainable energy sources, right? Surely not oil. Surely not natural gas. Surely not coal. Right? How about solar? Wind? Geothermal? Hydro-electric? Those are new technologies that really could create millions of jobs, and help bring the United States closer to energy independence. Nice work, Ted,  I’m with you on this one 100 percent! I just don’t think you’re with you. 
Policy three: “Imagine in 2017 a new president signing legislation repealing every word of Obamacare.” 
And replacing it with single payer healthcare! Obamacare has its weak points. It’s just that those weak points are the more conservative aspects of the bill; for instance, it includes no public option. But even with those weaknesses, Obamacare has been an unquestionable success. It has provided insurance coverage to millions of previously uninsured people. It has slowed the rise of healthcare and insurance costs. It has opened coverage to those with preexisting conditions, it has outlawed gender discrimination in providing insurance, and it has allowed me to stay on my parents' health insurance until I’m 26. 
But more importantly, Ted Cruz had no viable alternative. He can’t seek out a conservative, market-based solution, because Obamacare is the conservative, market-based solution.
Policy four: ”Imagine a simple flat tax… imagine abolishing the IRS.”
I knew Cruz was crazy, but not this crazy. First of all, a simple flat tax would be a monumentally unfair tax system. Income inequality is at record highs as it is, and what Cruz is suggesting is a massive tax break for the wealthy, and (most likely) a huge tax increase for the working and middle class.
Beyond that, who is supposed to collect Cruz’s harmful, woefully inadequate flat tax without the IRS? Is Cruz saying that he’ll collect every American’s taxes personally? The IRS doesn’t exist because taxes are high or complicated. The IRS exists because government bureaucracy may not be great, but it’s better than nothing when it comes to things like making sure the government has money, and making sure the President doesn’t throw away tax revenue because it got mixed in with his junk mail. 
Policy five: “Imagine a president that finally, finally, finally secures the borders.”
Cruz knows that President Obama has done more to secure the border than most presidents. Cruz is really talking about Obama’s “executive amnesty,” as he likes to call it (it’s not), which has nothing to do with border security. It’s all about recognizing that the Department of Homeland Security has bigger priorities than deporting a mother of three young American citizens or a productive, law-abiding member of society who was brought to the country illegally as a young child. 
This article is getting long. I underestimated the depths of Cruz’s crazy. It’s time for the lightning round. 
Policy six: “Imagine a federal government that works to defend the sanctity of human life…” 
I’ll be expecting your repeal of the death penalty on day one, President Cruz. Not to mention war. And I’m glad to hear you’ll be giving everyone free healthcare. 
Policy seven: “… and to uphold the sacrament of marriage.” 
Better get divorced now, before President Cruz outlaws it. It’s in the Bible, folks. That’s what he’s talking about, right?
Policy eight: “Imagine a federal government that protects the right to keep and bear arms of all law-abiding Americans.”
Cruz bragged on CNN this week about fighting tooth and nail to kill every commonsense gun control measure proposed after the Sandy Hook massacre, even the bipartisan ones with near universal public support. See Policy Six. 
Policy nine: “Instead of a government that seizes your e-mails and your cell phones, imagine a federal government that protected the privacy rights of every American.” 
Even a broken clock is right twice a day.
Policy ten: “Imagine repealing every word of Common Core.”
You’ll have to make it a federal law first though, so you can repeal it. 
Policy 11: “Imagine embracing school choice as the civil rights issue of the next generation…” 
Because racism is dead, after all, along with sexism, homophobia, and discrimination. It’s time to let schools finally have abortions, or whatever school choice means. But seriously, making it easier and more appealing for people to abandon public schools denies every child's right to a quality, free education. School choice is nothing but white flight from public schools.
Policy 12:  “Imagine a president who stands unapologetically with the nation of Israel.”
Because Israel is the 51st state, after all. (Yes, I did just dare boil US-Israeli relations down to eight words. What can I say? It’s the lightning round!)
Policy 13: “Imagine a president who says ‘I will honor the Constitution, and under no circumstances will Iran be allowed to acquire a nuclear weapon.’” 
U.S. Constitution Article V Section 2: “Under no circumstances will Iran be allowed to acquire a nuclear weapon.” Look it up, people. 
Policy 14: “Imagine a president who says ‘We will stand up and defeat radical Islamic terrorism… and call it by its name.’” 
While we're at it, let's call the Ku Klux Klan or Neo-Nazis radical Christian terrorists. That’ll go over well. Or, as it may turn out, gross over-generalizations about people are only okay when they’re about the trendy religious or ethnic group to hate. 
In conclusion, imagine Ted Cruz’s America: Where Netflix is as dependable as Comcast. Where it’s easier to get a gun than to vote. Where schools have more choice than women. Where Israel gets our unwavering support, but millions of uninsured Americans are left to fend for themselves. Where everyone has an equal tax rate, regardless of their ability to pay, but millions of Americans don’t have the right to marry the person they love. Where oil flows freely through our pipelines, but our commander-in-chief wont even acknowledge that climate change exists. 
We deserve better from our candidates. We deserve candidates who will talk about the real issues, like income inequality and climate change and the money in politics. Who will bring real solutions to the table rather than pander to hate and emotion. Who will align their policies to the facts, rather than religious dogma. The good news: Ted Cruz will never be president. The bad news: He’s running, and it isn’t going to be pretty.

After reading this week’s editorial opinion in The Tartan regarding shell space, a few inaccuracies in the piece have motivated me to write a letter. I should disclose that I am a senator in the Undergraduate Student Senate, so I’m well-informed on the issue, but also biased in regards to its representation to the student body.
I would first like to address the misconception that this space was purchasable by any undergraduate student organization. It is, frankly, too expensive for anyone to buy but Senate — noting this, we made this decision on behalf of all undergraduate representation in the student government. If Senate did not purchase this space, there is no guarantee that it would go to any undergraduate organization, and certainly, no other organization could afford it. It would likely go up for auction to other commercial interests on campus. 
Even if, hypothetically, an organization could afford the shell, there's no guarantee the space would be accessible to all the undergraduates on campus. Democratization of space access is an important issue, and Senate’s purchase is the best guarantee of a space for all undergraduates, regardless of departmental affiliation or organizational membership. 
Another note is that we don’t receive JFC funding. From the overall Student Activities Fee, we get a small slice ($140,000) of a budget, of which over half goes directly to students and student organizations. We’ve had the money sitting in reserves to make a big expenditure like this for a while. Without our purchase of the shell space, we couldn’t have allocated in a better way to help the student body. However, if you think there are better options to spend that money on, tell us. We are always looking for opportunities to subsidize students who are excited to do new things.
In regards to democracy of decision-making, Senate has continuously endeavored to make the shell space as democratically informed as possible. We’ve spent tens of hours tabling for student opinions, soliciting them by offering food to anyone who would respond. Our polling began during Senate Week 2014 (the second week of October). With its high traffic, the Cohen University Center (CUC) was the natural choice for location. We incentivized students to respond by handing out free gifts. 
Our big question: what is the space that’s needed most on this campus? The responses made it abundantly clear that students both wanted and needed a collaborative space for studying or socializing. This was the most feasible option that we solicited directly from students, so we decided to move forward with it.
Theoretically, at this point we could have directly formed our shell space committee. However, rather than restrict the processes to our own vision, we reopened the forum for students, asking for students’ ideal feel of a collaborative space, and what resources it would have. We tabled again (this time’s incentive was cakes from Prantl’s) and collected responses that gave us a robust vision guided by what students wanted and needed with our portion of the shell space.
After feeling sufficiently informed by the student body, we decided to move forward with our newly formed shell space committee. It’s been operational since early January, which shows that we spent nearly a semester collecting information from the undergraduates who we represent.
I find it hard to argue that this process was not democratic. There comes a point where one can no longer defer directly to students, for the sake of productivity. An organization’s members inform the vision for any organization on campus, but smaller working groups execute various facets of that vision. In our organization, our membership happens to be a bit bigger. It is unfeasible to have a working team of 5,500. Simply put, there would be many, many referendums.
We do our best to remain transparent and accessible. If you have any opinions on the shell space, please direct them to us. Student Government doesn’t exist to self-serve; we unabashedly seek the opinions of those we represent.
I hope that I’ve provided ample response and clarity to the issue.

This week, the Proud to Be Plaid Committee and Ian Glasner, student body president, announced a collaborative effort to boost senior giving through a donation matching program with the Board of Trustees. For every $5 that a senior gives between now and graduation, the trustees will donate $20.
This is an exciting development in the series of gift-giving initiatives that Carnegie Mellon has seen this year. Though many, including The Tartan in a previous editorial, felt that efforts were half-hearted, this new agreement is both welcome and encouraging. 
It is refreshing to hear that the Board of Trustees is standing with the students in regard to boosting the giving rates. According to the Office of Giving, the trustees already donated well over $1 million together annually, and some donate even more in individual major gifts that stretch over years. 
While adding $20 might not seem significant, it makes every senior's donation $25 instead of $5. Instead of totaling just over $5,100, the gift would multiply to over $25,000, creating a larger impact and a larger ripple effect. 
The more money that is given toward this scholarship or gift (yet to be decided by senior class voters), the more the money can do. Considering donations as an investment in the future of our school is exactly the right way to approach this new initiative, and hopefully, it will encourage more seniors, as well as all undergraduates, to give. 
The Board of Trustees should be applauded for their gesture of support, and the seniors who have given or will give as a part of this initiative should be excited to take part in a historic gift-giving program. 
It is unclear at this time if the initiative will extend to next year or not, but The Tartan would like to urge the trustees and student government to continue these efforts. This gift means more than just $20. It means a tangible show of togetherness in the Carnegie Mellon community and an encouraging investment in the students. 
Continued plans such as these show that there is real collaboration happening, and not just talks filled with flowery, empty promises. Hopefully, it will sustain through the next rotation of student government.

This week, The New York Times announced that Facebook is in talks with news sites about hosting content within Facebook instead of linking articles to external sites. 
The plan is meant to create a more user-friendly experience for Facebook users, especially on mobile devices, where clicking away to another site can be clumsy and slow. Expected partners include The New York Times, National Geographic, and Buzzfeed.
This move generates some murky legal waters for Facebook, which would host and display the content. Ownership and publishing rights are still in negotiation. Facebook has never before had revenue-sharing agreements with publishers, but now is discussing ways for publishers to make money from advertising revenue.
While this agreement could lead to a "seamless" media consumption experience, as Facebook proposes, it also carries serious implications for digital journalism. When profits are driven by advertising revenue, media outlets are tempted to produce "clickbait" stories eye-catching enough for casual consumers scrolling through Facebook. This has two consequences: Sensationalist journalism or non-substantive journalism. Both can be dangerous if they distort reporting. 
If news outlets forfeit ownership of their content, they also forfeit some degree of control over display and presentation. Even if they retain ownership, the data that comes from site traffic would no longer go to news outlets. They would lose information about their reader base, while Facebook would gain even more data about users' news consumption habits. 
Such a partnership is also likely to be limited to large-scale media outlets with the resources to reach Facebook. Smaller publications or niche stories could be lost.
As a news source, The Tartan is watching the evolution of online journalism very closely. Our own negotiations with USA Today over a joint mobile app raise similar questions about content, ownership, and access for readers.
