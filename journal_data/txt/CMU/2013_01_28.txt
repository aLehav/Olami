Sophomore Seth Cordts, affectionately known by his coach and teammates as “Zeff,” knows how to dunk and do it all.
The mechanical and biomedical engineering double major has maintained a rigorous course load while playing on the Carnegie Mellon men’s basketball team.
His hard work and persistence have proven to be a necessity to the team, which currently stands at a 1–6 University Athletics Association Conference record. “We’ve had a lot of tough breaks and close games,” Cordts said.
Yet he still holds onto his preseason expectations of a “great season,” as long as his teammates “forget about the past losses, and finish out strong.”
The Tartans’ luck seems to be slowly reversing. The team won 75–74 in an overtime thriller against the University of Chicago Maroons yesterday.
Cordts proved crucial in overtime, putting the team ahead shortly before junior Asad Meghani, one of the team captains, made the game-winning basket.
Cordts believes the biggest team accomplishments were the wins against Bethany College and LaRoche College, but also cited the team’s performances in losses as well. 
“We’ve certainly fought, every step of the way,” Cordts said.
Cordts has helped greatly in the Tartans’ fight, becoming a leader in both shooting and ball control.
“It was great to become a starter this season,” Cordts said. “But even more so, I felt as though I became a leader and helped my team play better.”
A native of Amherst, N.H., and a triplet with two athletic sisters, Zeff has played basketball since the third grade and has since fallen in love with the quick pace of the game. 
“You win one, you lose one; it’s a quick turnaround. You can have an awful game one day and the best game of your life the next,” Cordts said. 
He mentioned the sport is significantly different on the college level, and described it as “more competitive, and physically demanding.”
Yet for Cordts, the “hard work pays off,” as the “excitement of making a good shot” is universal.
“Seth has come a long way since his first year,” Meghani said. “He’s always brought a great attitude and great work ethic to the team. He’s always putting in extra work, whether it be in the weight room or shooting drills. He has a bright future ahead of him.”
Cordts emphasizes not only the excitement of the sport, but the camaraderie developed as being a member of a team. The team is “very close” and “[we] always have a good time together.”
“Usually when we go out to eat on away trips, we tell the waitress that it is someone’s birthday, even when it’s not,” Cordts said.
“Especially with the Carnegie Mellon basketball team, the team chemistry is what I love the most. We both play and study together. You know that you’ll be long-lasting friends with your teammates,” he said. 
The respect is certainly mutual, as Cordts has been hailed by his teammates for his work ethic. “Seth brings a contagious amount of focus and hard work every day to practice,” sophomore Drew Holinski said. “This isn’t easy to do by itself. But Seth did it while carrying a 4.0 GPA and working 15–20 hours per week last semester.”
Despite his borderline-crazy schedule, Cordts continues to serve as a role model for the team. 
“When somebody on the team thinks that they can’t summon up a little more energy in practice because of a hectic week or heavy work load, it helps to look at Seth and know that we have no right to make   excuses,” Holinski said. 
“It wouldn’t be a stretch to label Seth as CMU’s exemplar of hard work and time management.”

Carnegie Mellon men's swimming competed away against Denison University’s Big Red on Saturday, falling to the national powerhouse with a score of 141–128. 
Although the team lost the meet, the Tartans fought hard and saw numerous stellar performances throughout the day.
Sophomore Andrew Yee had two impressive finishes in the meet. In the mixed 1,650-yard freestyle, Yee finished  third place in the event in 16:37.25, and  finished the 50-yard freestyle in  4:46.34.
The Tartan’s dominance was displayed in the freestyle events. First-year Christopher Wysocki placed second with 10:00.23, followed by fellow teammate first-year Joseph Robinson, who finished third with a time of 10:24.76.
First-year Steven Geier’s time of 1:45.84 placed him second in the 200-yard freestyle, while first-year Lucas Bruder earned third place in the 100-yard freestyle with a time of 50.44. Lastly, junior Terrence Wong competed in the 50-yard freestyle, placing second with a time of 22.12.
Two Tartans competed especially well in the backstroke event: Sophomore Michael Kellman finished second in the 100-yard backstroke with a time of 54.28 and teammate Geier placed third in the 200-yard backstroke with 1:59.73.
Sophomores Cole Um and Roy Sung finished second in two different breaststroke events. Um placed second in the  100-yard breaststroke with a time of 1:01.73. 
In the 200-yard breaststroke, Sung finished in 2:14.49. Sung also finished second in the 200-yard individual medley (IM) to teammate first-year Matthew Nielsen, who finished first by half a second.
Carnegie Mellon’s domination continued into the butterfly events. Senior Brandon Yee was victorious in the 200-yard butterfly with a time of 1:55.76, and in the 100-yard butterfly, Wong finished second with a time of 52.54.
Wysocki attributed the loss to strenuous practices leading up to the meet. 
“I did not think we performed well,” Wysocki said. “That being said, we had a lot of tough workouts leading up to the meet.”
Um agreed. “It was a long week, and a lot of traveling. As a team you have your ups and downs. We know we will perform better next time,” he said.
Carnegie Mellon’s nationally-ranked team was coming off big wins against SUNY Geneseo and Westminster College on Saturday, Jan. 19 with 194–92 and 197–90, respectively.
“[The meet] went well and it was nice to get that recognition,” Um said. “We worked for it, and it paid off.” 
The Tartans performed well in the breaststroke events, with Farr placing second in the 200-yard breaststroke.
“I feel like we performed well in the meet against [SUNY Geneseo and Westminster College],” Wysocki said. “It set a positive tone for the rest of the season.”
“I think we can hopefully win the conference championships and have a lot of swimmers qualify for the NCAA Championships,” he said.
“I hope that we can finish better than we did last year,” Um added.
The team will take on the University of Pittsburgh at 11:30 a.m. on Feb. 2 at home.

The women's basketball team won 76–68 against the University of Chicago Maroons at home yesterday, bringing the Tartans to 11–7 overall and 3–4 in the University Athletic Association (UAA) conference.
First-year guard Amanda McHenry, sophomore guard Gabrielle West, senior forward Emily Peel, and first-year forward Liza Otto all made big plays that contributed to the team’s win. West was the Tartan’s leading scorer, accumulating a total of 17 points and establishing a halftime lead. “Our composure and focus stayed strong until the very end when we needed it most,” Otto said.
Peel and Otto both had excellent games, scoring double digits by taking advantage of rebounds and three-pointers. McHenry had a 10-point run late into the second half to break the 61–61 tie with two minutes to go.
“Our positive attitude and ability to play together within our system when the game got close helped the team win today,” said senior captain Tori Baggio.
On Friday, however, the team was not able to work as well, and experienced a difficult conference match against the ladies from Washington University in St. Louis, losing 73–57.
The Washington University in St. Louis Bears, coming off a monstrous 60–28 rout of Brandeis University, had momentum and energy on their side as they displayed focus and aggression against the Tartans. The Bears are currently 15–2 in the season, with five wins and just one loss in the UAA conference.
The Bears started out strong, scoring 20 points against the Tartans’ 10 in the first eight-and-a-half minutes of the game; the Tartans only experienced a lead once in the game (three minutes into the match), with the Bears leading the rest of the game.
The Bears rounded out the first half of the game with a score of 34–28 and, despite a good comeback effort in the middle of the second half by the Tartans, the Bears performed exceptionally toward the end of the game.
First-year center Lauren Maturo said, “We needed to be more aggressive, especially on defense,” pointing out that the team did not display the intensity it exhibited in wins earlier in the season. Maturo added that “[Washington University in St. Louis] went to the free-throw line twice as much as we did,” which head coach Jacquie Hullah told the team that it was one of the weakest points in their game.
Despite the shortcomings voiced by the team, others praised its positive qualities. Lisa Natale, a first-year engineering major and supporter, praised the team for the “great communication and team dynamic between players.” 
The Bears doubled the Tartans in points-off turnovers and second-chance points, contributed nine rebounds more than the Tartans, and contributed five fewer turnovers. First-year guard Lindsay Poss led the squad in scoring with 13 points, while Otto grabbed 10 rebounds.
The Tartans will journey to St. Louis to face the Bears again on Friday to close out the last month of regular-season play on a high note.

The Super Bowl is the pinnacle of American sports. It’s the most-watched event on television, with nearly 177 million viewers tuning into last year’s big game for at least six minutes according to NBC. This year’s match-up between the Baltimore Ravens and the San Francisco 49ers is one of the most interesting Super Bowls in recent history, both on and off the field.
The first thing anyone will mention about Super Bowl XLVII is the coaches. John Harbaugh, head coach of the Ravens, and Jim Harbaugh, head coach of the 49ers, are the first set of brothers to ever coach in the same Super Bowl.  They are also the first set of brothers to come to a Super Bowl on different teams.
The “HarBowl” nearly came to fruition last year, but both teams lost in their respective conference championship games. The media have had a full year to work on every pun and nickname involving the Harbaughs and the Super Bowl and is now unleashing all of its pent-up efforts on the world. 
Ravens linebacker Ray Lewis is the other source of headlines, as he told reporters in the last week of the season that this season would be his last. 
Lewis has been a polarizing player in his career, mostly stemming from his alleged involvement in the murders of Jacinth Baker and Richard Lollar during a fight that took place at a party celebrating the Ravens’ victory in Super Bowl XXXV (Lewis was named MVP of the game). 
Lewis entered into a plea bargain, in which he pleaded guilty to obstruction of justice and had his murder charges dropped in exchange for testifying against his friends.
Lewis received one-year probation and a $250,000 fine from the NFL, and has been improving his image ever since.
While these stories may appeal more to the casual fan, for football fans, this Super Bowl’s real intrigue comes from the matchup of teams on the turf. 
Both the 49ers and Ravens feature run-first offenses, as well as pounding defenses that force turnovers and smother the other team. Each team has had excellent performances from quarterbacks whose abilities were initially questioned coming into the season.
The 49ers’ hopes rest on the shoulders of inexperienced quarterback Colin Kaepernick, who replaced an injured Alex Smith in week 10. Kaepernick’s play convinced Jim Harbaugh to make an official starting quarterback change once Smith was cleared to play. At the time of Smith’s injury, Smith was named as the NFC Offensive Player of the Week, so Harbaugh’s decision to make Kaepernick the starting quarterback was highly criticized. 
Harbaugh’s switch appears to have paid off. Kaepernick’s ability to throw as well as run was instrumental in the 49ers’ victory against the Green Bay Packers and forced the Atlanta Falcons to construct a game plan around Kaepernick. This opened up room for running back Frank Gore to smash through defensive lines and punch the 49ers a ticket to the Super Bowl.
Baltimore has had its own quarterbacking issues with fifth-year starter Joe Flacco taking constant abuse from Ravens fans. He has been criticized for his inconsistent play and seeming inability to win the big game. Flacco is the only quarterback in NFL history to lead his team to the playoffs in each of his first five seasons. 
However, his propensity for untimely turnovers — and the perception that his success is owed to a strong running game and stellar defense — makes this a moot point in the eyes of the Ravens’ faithful. 
The difference this year is that Flacco is performing well. Flacco has gone toe to toe with three of the best quarterbacks in the AFC: the Colts’ Andrew Luck, the Broncos’ Peyton Manning, and the Patriots’ Tom Brady. In each game, he came out on top — not just on the score board, but on the stats sheet as well.
The two Super-Bowl-destined teams are both at the top of their games, performing better than ever before. 
Super Bowl XLVII provides chances for family bragging rights, for a player to end his Hall-of-Fame-worthy career on top, and for one of two quarterbacks to silence the critics once and for all. The drama of the bowl has taken on a personal side, fueling television’s most-watched event.
This, combined with a Beyoncé halftime show and entertaining commercials, will surely make this year’s Super Bowl the absolute must-see thing on television.

As students and faculty finished the second week of the spring semester, nearly 200 Carnegie Mellon students gathered their coffee, energy drinks, and inventive spirits as they prepared for TartanHacks.
TartanHacks is an annual, student-run hackathon hosted by the student organization ScottyLabs and its partners, the Carnegie Mellon School of Computer Science Undergraduate Program, Project Olympus, and Women@SCS. In addition, the event has attracted sponsorship and support from a number of companies, including Dropbox, Google, Yahoo, Microsoft, Facebook, eBay, Capital One, and Andreessen Horowitz. TartanHacks took place in designated “hacking zones” in the Gates Hillman Complex from 6 p.m. last Friday to 6 p.m. Saturday.
This year’s winners included “GoogleMinus,” an app that allows users to search Blackboard as they would search terms on Google, which won Capital One’s sponsor prize for the most technically challenging hack. “TaskMob,” a real-time collaborative task management app for mobile devices, won the first prize of $2,000. 
This year, keeping in line with the popular computer science notion of zero-based indexing (numbering starting from zero), there was also a zeroth prize, which was intended for the best team. “Chronozone,” which helps users monitor their location, won the zeroth prize of $2,000 and a trip to the Dropbox headquarters in San Francisco. 
For those of us generally unfamiliar with the world of computer science, the word “hackathon” may have a negative connotation. However, a hackathon is actually an event where students dedicate 24 or 48 hours to developing a project or application idea into a working application, using pre-existing external application programming interfaces (APIs) and a variety of web development tools.
Participants may work in teams of up to four people. At the end, each team presents their project to three categories of judges: the event organizers, a designated panel of judges, and sponsor judges. 
The event organizers give away a “First Penguin Award”  — inspired by Randy Pausch’s similar award — for the most daring idea. The sponsor judges, representatives from sponsor companies, give away prizes to their chosen hacks based on criteria such as “most impressive user interface” or “most technically challenging.” The designated panel awards first, second, and third prizes to the “hacks” they deem most innovative. Although all students may participate, only undergraduate students may submit their projects to be evaluated for prizes.
This year’s hackathon featured hacks that would be useful for many aspects of college life. One group was developing a long-term scheduling app.
“For four-year plans, and scheduling things in the long term, CMU doesn’t have anything really,” Vikram Sunder, a sophomore computer science major, explained. “The idea is that this app will take all the class information and build this giant directory.” The app will tell a user when to take a certain class and list the prerequisites.
Carnegie Mellon alumnus Joseph Swernofsky, who won honorable mention for his group’s online annotation app “AnnotateMe,” was a mentor this year. Mentors generally answer questions or help hackers through problems with their programs. In addition to student mentors, TartanHacks participants also had access to engineers from sponsor companies for help with their apps.
TartanHacks began last year, and was inspired by Penn Apps, a 48-hour hackathon that takes place twice a year at the University of Pennsylvania.
“Throwing a hackathon was suggested to me by Vinay Vemuri, the co-founder of ScottyLabs. He participated in PennApps in the fall of 2011, and we agreed that by bringing a hackathon to CMU we could convince people to use the APIs that we were creating,” Amy Quispe, senior in computer science and director of ScottyLabs, said.
“Initially, Amy wanted to develop APIs that would allow students to build apps around CMU’s datasets, i.e. scheduling, dining hours, and directory data,” said Quintin Carlson a junior Decision Science major and project manager of TartanHacks. “While that wasn’t exactly what happened last year, this year, we are launching an early alpha of ScottyLabs APIs.”
While TartanHacks may appear to be an event largely within the realm of those with technical backgrounds, it is an opportunity for people of a variety of fields to contribute. 
“It’s absolutely possible for non-technical majors to get involved. We have students from majors across the school compete in TartanHacks. Designers from CFA, statisticians from Dietrich, and entrepreneurs from Tepper all come out for this event,” Carlson said via email.
For first-timers, organizers arrange for crash courses on building applications, as well as courses in languages such as JavaScript, HTML, and CSS prior to the event. There is also a “free agent mixer,” which is a social event to facilitate forming teams, typically held on the night before the hackathon.
“TartanHacks is an extremely friendly hackathon for first timers….In fact, in this next year ScottyLabs wants to focus on uniting designers and hackers more. User experience design and visual design are becoming increasingly important,” Quispe said.
TartanHacks can help students bring to life ideas that have lasting social implications. This year’s exhibit of “hacks” featured a mobile-based app that uses natural language processing to scan Facebook for posts from the user’s friends containing signs of depression or suicide. The app alerts the user via text message and posts an encouraging message on the wall of the Facebook friend. It also creates a link to a Google Hangout, which is texted to all friends of the depressed person who are users of the app, so that they can come together, via video conferencing, to help cheer him or her up.
With apps like this, TartanHacks is not limited to the technically savvy — it’s open to anyone with a desire to impact people’s lives.

A student comes into a laboratory and plays a video game. During the course of the game, the student is presented with unique sounds that she has never heard before. She has to quickly make a decision on where it came from, or she won’t survive in the game for long. While the student already has her own developed sense of language, how does her brain react to and learn these new sounds?
This is one of the many questions being asked in the Speech Perception and Learning Laboratory, directed by psychology professor Lori Holt, whose research explores how the brain interprets sounds. Recently, the National Academy of Sciences (NAS) has acknowledged her important contributions to psychology by naming her a recipient of the Troland Research Award.
Each year, the Troland is given to only two researchers under the age of 40. Holt earned the award for her studies in “advancing our understanding of the sensory and cognitive processes that are fundamental to the perception of speech,” according to the NAS website. The award comes with a $50,000 prize.
Holt’s lab is currently focusing on the language of speech, and how people’s experiences affect the way they hear language. According to Holt, “Learning a language actually changes how you hear sounds, [so we are] very interested in this process and how that shapes the way we interpret speech.”
The video game technique aims to help answer these questions by putting participants in a cognitive environment similar to that of an infant’s. “It’s a way of taking adults that already have established speech perception processes and putting them into a place where they might’ve been when they were first learning those sounds,” Holt said. Monitoring the brain during these experiences could give valuable information regarding the mechanisms that occur in the brain when one learns a language for the first time or even learns a second language.
Holt’s journey to speech cognitive psychology started “by accident” while she was an undergraduate at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. “I basically wanted to try and stay on campus during the very long winter break, and a professor I was taking a class with asked me if I wanted to earn some money over the break,” she said.
Holt spent the next few weeks taking care of Japanese quail that were being used in speech and cognition experiments. After her experience, Holt said she “was kind of hooked on research,” eventually staying to earn her Ph.D. from UW-Madison. She joined the Carnegie Mellon faculty in 1999, and has been further exploring speech cognition since.
In her lab, Holt is admired as a mentor by both her undergraduate and graduate researchers. One graduate student she works with is Matt Lehet, a psychology Ph.D. student. 
“I am thrilled for Lori that she received the award and think it is completely justified. She is at the top of her field, is more prolific than anyone I have ever encountered, and is a major reason I was so excited about coming to CMU,” he said via email.
In addition to directing her lab, Holt teaches multiple courses in the psychology department. Rachel Browne, a junior civil and environmental engineering and cognitive science double major, has had Holt as a lecturer and has worked in her lab. “[Holt] is a fascinating lecturer, and somehow makes the complex happenings of the brain seem easy to understand,” she said via email.
Holt is also grateful for her opportunities at the university. She attributes some of her success to the Carnegie Mellon environment, which makes collaboration across departments easy. “Cross-disciplinary interaction really happens very naturally at CMU,” she said. According to Holt, her “interactions with fabulous colleagues and collaborators” have also had a large impact on her research.
Holt will receive her award from the NAS on April 29 in Washington, D.C., and will be the third Troland recipent from Carnegie Mellon. In the meantime, she will continue her groundbreaking research  on the complex and mysterious functions of the human brain.

You use electricity all the time — when you charge your phone, when you turn on the lights, when you cook. But where does this electricity come from? How is it distributed to you?
The answer to these questions is an electrical grid that spans the entire U.S. and delivers electricity from suppliers to consumers through a three-part system: power stations produce electricity, transmission lines carry electricity from these stations to demand centers, and transformers that reduce voltage so the transmission lines can carry power to their final destinations.
Unfortunately, the current state of the electrical grid is inefficient. Electrical and computer engineering assistant professor Gabriela Hug, who is also affiliated with the engineering and public policy department, is working to overcome this obstacle. She was recently awarded a five-year $400,000 grant from the National Science Foundation (NSF) to fund her groundbreaking research on improving our power grid’s efficiency.
The way the grid is designed right now, electrical current flows through transmission lines following Kirchhoff’s laws — a set of circuit rules stating that the sum of all currents flowing into one node is zero, and that the sum of the voltage gains and drops in any circuit loop is also zero. “You can’t tell an electron which way to flow,” Hug joked. However, there are certain devices such as the Flexible Alternating Current Transmission System (FACTS) that can be used to influence parameters on a line.
“For example, if you have two of the same resistors in parallel, half of the current will flow through one line and the other half will flow through the second line,” Hug said. “But if you influence the resistance in one of the wires, you can push part of the current into the other line.” Essentially, these devices will allow us to control the flow of current through the electric power grid. But why is flexibility in the power grid so important?
With increased efforts for renewable energy, sources of power generation have become much more diverse. Coal power plants — which produce predictable and stable outputs of power each day — were the power sources of the past. Now scientists must take into account the fluctuations that are inherent to other forms of power, such as wind or solar power. 
Hug’s research focuses on how to optimize the use of devices such as FACTS in the power grid. “What values should they be set to? Should they be coordinated from a centralized control center or locally?” Hug asked.
Another method to increase the power grid’s flexibility is determining how to optimally integrate large-scale storage. “Right now we don’t have a lot of storage in the power system,” Hug said. “Whenever I flip a switch or use more power, the generator needs to change its output depending on what I’m doing. Storage allows you to use some of the energy you have in your storage to supply your load.” The problem is figuring out when you should charge the storage and when you should use the energy from the storage.
The students who work with Hug conduct all their experiments computationally, as the real electric power grid is too big to test ideas on. Since the improvement of the power grid is a task that involves both scientific solutions and effective policy, Hug works with both engineering and policy students, with the policy group using mathematical models of the system to see the social and economic outcomes of applying the technical solutions provided by the engineering group.
Hug plans to use the NSF grant to further her research. As efforts to harness renewable energy improve, so too will our electric power grid system

Young people are notorious for being attached to their electronic devices. Now, the advent of Project Glass by Google — an initiative in wearable electronics — will only serve to strengthen this relationship. While computing devices that can be worn is not a new concept in itself, Google’s influence on the technological world means that Project Glass could be one of the most popular manifestations of an electronic wardrobe.
Project Glass aims to create glasses with a built-in camera, screen, and computer that can provide people with information in real-time about the world around them. An ABC News article stated that a prototype will be released early this year for software developers. The actual glasses are scheduled to be released next year.
According to Daily Mail, the physical structure of these wearable computing glasses is simple: They will look like ordinary glasses with transparent LED screens that can display information overlaying on whatever the user is looking at. These glasses will be designed so that even users who already wear normal prescription glasses will be able to use them, either through screens with prescription lenses or models that can fit over existing eye-wear. 
The glasses will be able to connect to the Internet to find information about whatever the user is looking at and can be controlled by the user through head tilts and other programmed gestures. There will also be headphones embedded into its frame that can give information to the user. Advertisers can even transmit information to the device based on the user’s proximity to their stores. Google’s new invention will allow people to be connected to their environment at all times.
One of the most interesting features behind wearable computing glasses is that they have the ability to look up information by using images as search queries. There are many strategies available for doing so. VentureBeat, a technology blog, describes a strategy that involves using specialized search engines to parse the different parts of the picture.
Search engines also can be specialized. A picture can be searched on a text-recognition, landmark-recognition, facial-recognition, or household-object recognition search engine. The results from all these search engines could then be combined and sorted to only display those most relevant to the user. This way, the user not only receives information about the searched image itself, but also about items related to it. For example, a menu image will not only give the name of the restaurant itself, but also directions, reviews, and images of the restaurant.
One of the disadvantages of this type of searching is that it requires a lot of computational power and time. Fortunately, there are alternatives to the method of searching described. A paper published by Google engineers describes a way to make searching with images easier through the use of algorithms designed to distinguish between different types of colors and borders. 
These algorithms are good at picking out important colors and shapes in any given picture, allowing the most important parts of pictures to be emphasized. As a result, computational power can be used more efficiently.
Another technique involves the use of metadata. Metadata is information about the time and location of an image when a digital device takes pictures. This metadata can be used to narrow down search results and focus computational power only on relevant search areas.
As the world continues to advance in technology and computing power, wearable computing devices such as Project Glass will soon become commonplace, and could change how people interact with the world around them.

Geneticist labeled ‘mad scientist’ over Neanderthal cloning
Harvard geneticist George Church was labeled a “mad scientist” for allegedly seeking a female human to bear a cloned Neanderthal baby. Church, however, claims he only theorized that studying cloned Neanderthals can help scientists better understand how the human mind works. He is blaming the public backlash on a lack of scientific literacy. “The public should be able to detect cases where things seem implausible,” Church said.
Despite media opposition, he continues to speak publicly about his research, focusing on using genes extracted from Neanderthal DNA to treat and prevent diseases. These experiments raise ethical questions, like whether the clones will be treated as subjects or individuals.

Adélie penguins: Cool, efficient killing machines
Nobody would suspect that Adélie penguins are silent assassins because of their comical waddling and bobbing on the surface of the sea. According to Yuuki Watanabe, a researcher at Japan’s National Institute, the penguins have an amazing stealth mode and attack to hunt down their prey. Tiny swarms of shrimp can wiggle their bodies in an attempt to escape, only to be gobbled up and swallowed whole by the penguin. As a way of being sneaky, the penguins sit on the edge of an iceberg and wait for the prey to appear before plunging in.
The researchers were able to determine the hunting technique of penguins by using underwater “penguin cams” that turned on whenever a penguin entered the water.

Big Data apps are helping to track movement of flu
A string of new apps and websites are being developed that can help people avoid the flu. For example, Germ Tracker receives symptom data from social media platforms and tracks viruses as they spread. “Help I Have Flu,” developed by pharmaceutical startup Help Remedies, scans your friend’s social networking profiles for words related to flu, like “cough” or “sneeze.” The user will be alerted if someone in the network is sick. Google Flu Trends is another device that can track the flu by using data from flu-related searches.

Vomiting robot is being used for virus research
Larry, a robot that can projectile vomit, was created by Catherine Makison-Booth, a microbiologist at the United Kingdom’s Health and Safety Laboratory in the Occupations Hygiene Unit. The robot’s esophagus is attached to a cylinder filled with water and fluorescent liquid. The liquid, which is propelled by a special pump, shoots out of Larry’s mouth, and can go as far as 10 feet.
Scientists hope to see how norovirus spreads from humans to humans, based on the trajectory of vomit and viral particles.  The norovirus affected over 880,000 people in the U.K. alone since last summer.

NIH to retire over 300 chimpanzees to sanctuaries
The National Institute of Health (NIH) recently announced a possible move for some of its animals after a national panel of scientists recently concluded that over 300 chimpanzees being used for testing by the NIH should be retired. Some chimps are already being sent to Chimp Haven, a 200-acre sanctuary in northwestern Louisiana.
The NIH plans to keep around 50 chimps in case they are needed for further testing, but would have to improve the chimps’ living conditions. The move was announced due to growing technological advances and ethical concerns over the use of chimps for testing.

Stem cell therapy to repair damaged knee cartilage
Rush University Medical Center is conducting the nation’s first clinical study of Cartistem, a stem cell drug, to repair knee cartilage damage by aging, trauma, or degenerative disease. The stem cells are mixed with hyaluronan, a natural polymer that plays a major role in wound healing and is a building block of joint cartilage. A two-year study will determine the effectivenss of the treatment.
Cartistem would be administered to the affected area through arthroscopic surgery, a relatively common procedure. Dr. Brian Cole, the principle investigator of the study, said, “With a burgeoning aging, yet active population, our patients are looking for effective nonjoint replacement solutions to treat their damaged knee cartilage.”

Entropy+ is “Carnegie Mellon’s very own campus convenience store,” according to the Carnegie Mellon Dining Services website. And yet, every time I walk in, I’m surprised by the lack of simple ingredients on the shelves. Yes, they have five dozen varieties of chips, candy, and bread. But the simple things that dedicated bakers and cooks can’t live without are sometimes inexplicably absent. On a day that you don’t feel like hiking down to IGA in Oakland or Giant Eagle in Squirrel Hill, the absence of basic ingredients can be a real buzzkill. 
That being said, Entropy+ isn’t without hope. There are some things to work with there. Whether you’re whipping up a romantic dinner for two or planning on bringing a sweet treat to a meeting, here are some dishes that you can make using ingredients found at Entropy+.

Opera has traditionally been perceived as the land of fat ladies in Viking helmets, passionate love affairs, and duels to the death. It’s not a medium that often brings to mind farmers in the American Midwest during the ’30s.
Last week, the Carnegie Mellon School of Music put on a production of Aaron Copland’s The Tender Land, an American opera about a Great Depression-era family, and its broken hopes and future dreams. The opera focuses on the conflict between Laurie Moss, a young woman who wants to see the world and be free of her overprotective family, and her mother and grandfather, who have provided for Laurie over the years and only wish to guarantee her a bright and successful future.
At the front and center of the production is the music. Copland, who was known later in life as the Dean of American Composers, was influential in creating a distinctly modern, American style of composition. The music of The Tender Land, though not as complex as some other works, is nonetheless deeply moving. The music spans a range of emotions, including hope, uneasiness, and playfulness, and at times includes a touch of folk sensibility.
The production quality of Friday night’s performance was very high. The staging was relatively minimalist, with fences rising and sinking into the “ground” like hills. Behind it all was a huge backdrop — a vast pool of color to mimic the endless Midwestern skies — which changed colors in response to the mood of the story.
One of the more interesting aspects of this production was that the actors, who were all School of Music students, had to play characters of drastically different ages. These characters range from an eight-year-old girl to a grandfather aged 60 or older. But the performers handled their roles well and were very believable in their parts.
The stand-out performances of Friday’s show were junior voice major Francesca Bonadonna as Ma Moss and junior psychology and voice double major Chelsea Ritenour as Laurie. Both were very sympathetic in their roles despite being at odds for the majority of the story, and at the end, when they part ways, there was a genuine sense of sadness.
“[Ma’s] a very strong character,” Bonadonna said on her role as Ma Moss. “She has a rough relationship with her oldest daughter. She tries to be sympathetic but it’s hard for her, because her daughter wants to leave the farm and their home. At the end it’s heartbreaking for her to watch her daughter walk away.”
The opera’s only flaw was that the storyline felt rushed. The majority of the opera takes place over the span of a single day, and it would have made more sense if stretched out over a longer period of time. The leading couple literally meet and decide to elope within 24 hours. It feels as if the viewer is given a bare skeleton of the story without enough details to fill it out.
The opera would have been better if it had allowed the characters to develop more over time and had shown more of the family’s backstory and struggles. Still, the bare essence of the plot is very strong. Full of promises that are made and broken, it’s a heartfelt tale about family, love, and freedom that could have delivered spectacularly if it had fleshed out more.
Overall, The Tender Land is a slightly flawed but a very beautiful and heartfelt opera. The staging was beautiful; the cast was charming, talented, and colorful; and the opera itself very acutely reflects the mood of the ’30s, an era during which much was uncertain and unpredictable, but people nonetheless managed to stay together and hope for the future.
Bonadonna touched on this sense of hope that resonated at the end of the opera: “I really like the last song I sing,” she said. “It’s about this optimistic view; even though [Ma Ross’] daughter’s left, there’s still hope left out there; she’s still got another daughter. It’s an introspective song; she’s going to move on with her life, and her daughter’s going to do what she wants to do.”

Blogger and entrepreneur Chris Guillebeau made a stop in Pittsburgh on his book tour to promote his bestseller, The $100 Startup, on Thursday. For those with an entrepreneurial spirit and the desire to put ideas into action, the event was both inspirational and enjoyable.
Guillebeau’s blog, The Art of Non-Conformity, details his travels around the world and the people he meets who do unconventional yet meaningful work to make a living. His most recent book, The $100 Startup, follows a similar theme, giving examples of people who have adopted the liberating lifestyle of having a career they love, finding both personal and monetary value in it.
The book tour stop took place at the Thrill Mill, a new startup incubator located in East Liberty. A large, open space that was recently renovated, the venue was conducive to the number of guests who attended the talk. As a meeting ground for local entrepreneurs and those interested in the startup environment, the Thrill Mill succeeded in creating an atmosphere for mingling and networking throughout the event.
Guillebeau kept his main talk brief to accommodate the audience members who had to stand during the event due to insufficient seating. Much of his talk was simply a summary of The $100 Startup and his life in general. While this information can be gathered in greater detail in the book and his blog, his delivery made the talk more than just a rehashing of material; the talk became a way to connect to the audience.
He touched on examples from the book of people who had a passion and saw a market demand for their work. The examples featured entrepreneurs from all over the world at different times in their lives, which resonated with his audience of all ages.
After the talk, Guillebeau opened the floor to questions. While much of his talk focused on the book and its themes of reinvention and loving what you do, the “questions and attempted-answers session” — as Guillebeau called it — had a livelier atmosphere.
A lot of the questions pertained to Guillebeau’s travels across the world. Looking back at his mission to visit every country before his 35th birthday, he had lot of experiences to recount. South Africa is a great place for running, according to Guillebeau, yet he was hard-pressed to pick one country as his favorite. He revealed that Norway was the only country he has yet to visit, and he hopes to make that journey this April with a group of dedicated fans.
As a writer, traveler, and speaker, Guillebeau reaches out to people to inspire and motivate them to pursue their own careers and lifestyles. Minor detractions aside, this stop on his book tour succeeded in connecting with an enthusiastic Pittsburgh audience.

It’s hard to break out of a genre that you helped define. Perhaps no one knows that better than recording artist Chaz Bundick (also known by his stage name Toro y Moi), who in his most recent album Anything In Return has managed to do just that.
As a pioneer of the chillwave genre just a few years ago, Bundick became known for swirling sonic explorations in his debut album Causers of This. But in his new album, he trades the low-fidelity samples for a clean production style that combines a wide range of musical influences.
Bundick recently told Pitchfork, “The album’s about me trying to be a better person” — and this sentiment is tangible throughout the album. From the honest lyricism to the array of musical influences, Bundick is no doubt trying his hardest — and succeeding.
In recent years, Bundick has become known for incorporating many genres into his own pop-focused conglomerate of funk, R&B, soul, house, and rock; Anything In Return takes that to the next level. Here, his combinations feel effortless and natural. Listening to the album, there’s never a doubt about whose music it is, but you’ll constantly be surprised by the sounds Bundick introduces.
The vocals in Anything In Return are the strongest of any Toro y Moi album. While his last full-length album, Underneath the Pine, features a heavier focus on his voice, it seems that Bundick has gained enough confidence in his vocal strength to really pull it off in Anything In Return. Lines like, “Don’t let me go / ‘cause I feel weak” on the track “Rose Quartz” are more believable than his previous efforts at heartfelt lyricism.
A few songs on the 13-track album do fall flat, although it is hard to say exactly why. Perhaps it’s the lyrics, some of which seem to lack any real depth. Or it could be the overwhelming mixture of influences, as it isn’t easy to find the right balance of sounds. The few flops on the album are hardly worth noting, however, because on the whole, Bundick shows a sophisticated shift from his chillwave roots into a more sonically diverse realm. He’s never been a great lyricist (Anything In Return is his best effort yet), and I’d much rather listen to Bundick take chances combining sounds than listen to another boring indie-pop record.
As the album’s opening track title suggests, there is perhaps some “Harm in Change,” but Bundick’s latest effort shows that there can also be significant growth. By introducing many new styles into his music, Bundick has not only made a highly accessible pop album, but one that old fans will certainly find engaging and deeply satisfying. Indeed, unlike the apathetic subgenre he helped define just a few years ago, it’s clear Bundick is here to stay.

The movie adaptation of Les Misérables may be garnering plenty of critical acclaim, but last weekend Pittsburghers had the opportunity to see the musical as it was meant to be viewed: on the stage. PNC Broadway Across America presented a 25th anniversary production of Les Mis at the Benedum Center and proved that, despite the advantages big-budget Hollywood productions may have, there is magic in a live production that cannot be captured on screen.
The iconic musical, based on the novel by Victor Hugo, documents the life of Jean Valjean (Peter Lockyer), a compassionate convict who breaks his parole to form a new life after spending 19 years in prison for stealing a loaf of bread. He is pursued by Javert (Andrew Varela), a police inspector with a fierce devotion to the letter of the law. The musical also centers around issues of class politics and unrest, as Valjean’s adopted daughter Cosette (Lauren Wiley) falls in love with Marius (Carnegie Mellon alumnus Devin Ilaw), an idealistic, politically-minded student who gets involved in an attempted revolution in Paris.
Les Mis is almost entirely sung, with only two lines of straight dialogue, meaning that the actors must be phenomenal singers in order for the show to succeed — and the Broadway Across America production certainly didn’t disappoint. Although Lockyer initially sounded as if he was holding back — he spoke-sung several of his lines in the opening numbers — any hesitance about his singing quickly disappeared as he belted out the final notes of Valjean’s “Soliloquy.” His rendition of “Bring Him Home” was similarly stunning; Lockyer’s incredible use of vibrato was goosebump-inducing. Varela as Javert stood in perfect contrast to Valjean: He had a fiery stage presence that exemplified Javert’s unquestioning dedication to the law.
Another highlight was Ilaw (CFA ’07) as Marius. Although Marius is written as a fairly one-dimensional character, Ilaw brought new emotional depth to the character during his heart-wrenching rendition of “Empty Chairs and Empty Tables.” In contrast to Marius’ sweet idealism, Timothy Gulan was bone-chillingly nefarious as the entertaining but thieving Thénardier. In “Dog Eats Dog” especially, one couldn’t help but shudder while watching Thénardier cackle as he pried gold teeth out of a corpse in the sewers.
The technical details of the production were also highly impressive. The set pieces, designed by Matt Kinley and inspired by the paintings of Victor Hugo, were mostly large, wooden structures that glided around the stage to evoke different locations. Hanging at the back of the stage was a screen onto which different video backdrops were projected, so that it looked as if the ensemble members were, for example, marching through the Parisian streets, even though they were marching in place. The orchestra was also stunning; the score for Les Mis is technically intricate — especially since the musicians have to vigilantly follow the singers — but the orchestra’s execution was flawless.
Even beyond the stunning individual performances and the impressive technical details, the theatrical power of Les Mis lies in its ensemble. For the “Finale,” the cast members all came together quietly, then slowly but surely crescendoed to a stunning blend of voices. The gorgeous vocal harmonies and instrumentation thundered out from the stage, washing over the audience and causing a visceral reaction to the music, the sort of reaction that one can only experience through the unique power of a live performance.

While not everyone reads The Tartan, those stacks of newspapers in The Underground and all over campus may still prove useful — though in a way you might not expect. Here we’ll explore ways to adorn yourself with new school spirit swag in the form of newspaper fashion.
A Skirt or Shorts 
What you’ll need: 
• The Tartan 
• Scissors 
• Clear laminate 
• Assorted sewing supplies (thread, a needle, a zipper, etc.)
Choose a pattern of skirt or shorts you want to make, then proceed to cut out the paper into the  shape you desire. I personally cut out pieces of the paper and organized them in a collage-like fashion. Whichever pattern you choose, laminate the paper before sewing anything. If you’re trying to sew straight paper, it isn’t going to work.
A Detachable Collar 
What you’ll need:
• The Tartan 
• Scissors 
• Clear laminate 
• Measuring tape 
• One clip button set (the kind that comes in two parts and clicks when you push them together)
Measure the distance around your neck and collarbone. This way, you know how long to make your collar. Cut the newspaper (ideally several pages thick so it holds its shape) into the shape of your desired type of collar, be it a Peter Pan collar or a pointy formal dress collar. The collar must be cut in such a way that the only “seam” is at the back. Laminate it. Make sure the top can be folded down to allow the paper to hold on to your shirt without falling off. Attach a clip button set (one half on each side) to the back so it is hidden from view.
A Tie
This process is similar to making the detachable collar, though if you want that Windsor tie look, you’ll have to go through the trouble of tying laminated paper into the desired type of knot. You should still clip it in the back. Your tie won’t last long if you have to keep untying and retying it.
A Shirt or Tank Top
This is practically a no-brainer. Laminate the paper, cut it, and sew it. Make original designs if you desire, or mix textiles if you want fancy sleeves. Whatever you do, avoid wifebeaters or excessive cleavage. Nobody wants to see that.
An Airplane
This is the classic airplane. For some of you, it may be rewarding watching this article hover around someone’s cranium before diving nose-first into his salad. You don’t need to do anything special to this one — unless you’re in CIT.
What part of the paper you wear says a lot about you. If you feel that you need everything made out of the Comics section, go for it. If you favor straight-up facts, then bring the News section into your wardrobe. Feel free to use any type of newspaper you wish. After all, poverty chic is in (those Les Mis people were dressed way too well), and so is recycling.

Son, the final installment in the quartet of novels that author Lois Lowry began with the Newbery Award-winning The Giver, should really be two books. It tries to tell two stories. The first story is as beautifully executed as one would expect from Lowry, but it is cut unsatisfyingly short to make room for the second, which is too thin and rushed to make much of an impact.
The first two-thirds of Son follows Claire, a 14-year-old Birthmother from the dystopian community first described in The Giver. Birthmothers are assigned by community elders from a young age to bear the children of the community. After one difficult and traumatic birth, Claire is decommissioned and sent to work in a fish hatchery. In the bureaucratic snafu that follows, the leaders of the community forget to give her the emotion-sapping pills that the rest of the community receives. They also accidentally reveal to Claire the identity of her son: Gabe, the child whose imminent death sets into motion the climax of The Giver.
Alone, struggling to come to terms with her overwhelming loss and awakening passions in a community that neither feels nor understands either, Claire comes to a decision. Her son is more important than anything else. When Jonas, the protagonist of The Giver, steals Gabe from the community to save his life, Claire escapes as well, setting out on a journey to find him.
Lowry is a mother herself, and one who has lost a child, so it’s not surprising that Claire’s story is some of the best emotional writing in The Giver quartet. The narrative positively aches for its protagonist. Claire’s slow transition from confused, heartbroken child to capable, determined woman feels as important and absorbing as anything that happened to Lowry’s other protagonists. For 260 pages, the reader lives and dies with Claire’s hope of reuniting with her son.
That’s why it’s so frustrating when, two-thirds of the way through the novel, Lowry largely abandons Claire’s story to focus on Gabe. The moment that Claire first lays eyes on her grown son is narrated briefly, and only as a recollection after many years. The moment that Claire first speaks to Gabe is similarly rushed, and is not even told from her perspective. After a novel’s worth of anticipation, a combined three pages of reunion just isn’t enough.
Gabe’s story contributes to the dissatisfaction. Gabe has grown up in the utopic Village that provided the setting for Messenger. He’s never known pain, fear, or hunger. He’s been loved and cared for his entire life. But he is also an orphan almost entirely disconnected from his past, and he yearns for a sense of real belonging. He has decided to leave the Village in search of his history.
Given the space of an entire novel, Gabe’s story could be interesting — but squeezed into the last third of Son, it doesn’t work. The reader hardly has time to learn, let alone care, about Gabe’s problems before they are resolved. As soon as Gabe meets his mother, he receives the love and belonging he desires and no longer feels any need to search for his past — even though he exchanges only two words with Claire. Lowry reduces a relationship that is complicated, painful, and ultimately deeply rewarding into a few pages of Gabe sitting at the unconscious Claire’s bedside. Neither Gabe’s story nor Claire’s is well served by the resolution.
The switch in focus from Claire to Gabe also signals a switch in tone. While Claire’s section of the book is more or less a realistic take on a personal struggle in a dystopian future, Gabe’s section turns into a kind of high-minded allegory about the nature of evil. After meeting his mother, Gabe confronts the Trademaster — a man explicitly stated to be the physical incarnation of evil — who forced Claire to make a fatal trade in order to meet her son.
Both realism and allegory have a history in The Giver quartet. The Giver and Gathering Blue tell slightly mystical but essentially grounded stories about hidden evil and the sacrifice of freedom for security. Messenger features the Trademaster in the background, as the driving force for a more detached allegory about the ways that people who have escaped tyranny and oppression can, with time and selfishness, become tyrants and oppressors themselves. Son tries to have it both ways and fails. After 260 pages of realism, 30 pages of metaphor — because Gabe’s fight against the Trademaster, from the moment he learns of his existence to the moment he defeats him, takes only 30 pages — do not feel deep or meaningful. They feel sudden, silly, and easy.
That’s the real problem with the ending of Son: It’s all too easy. Gabe’s emotional entanglement is erased by a deathbed visit to a woman he’s never met. Claire’s imminent death is easily reversed by the defeat of one man. Even this defeat is too easy; Gabe vanquishes the physical manifestation of evil by giving him examples of a few people who have remained good all their lives. That’s it. That’s all it takes to kill evil. Gabe doesn’t even have to work very hard. The Trademaster offers him a few trades, but nothing that Gabe really wants. He’s never tempted at all. In order to defeat evil, Gabe has to overcome nothing but a wild river and a little bit of fear.
Mostly, though, the metaphor itself is too easy. The world of Son is a world full of deep, complex, societal evil. This is a world where 14-year-olds are forced to give birth in darkness, and are never allowed to know their children. This is a world where a father can neglect, abuse, and rape his son without repercussion. This is a world where communities kill colicky babies and drug the love and passion out of their populations — and evil is a man whispering in your ear for a trade? Evil can be defeated and utopia protected in a few minutes by a boy who’s never known hardship at all? Is the evil of this world so small that it can be vanquished without sacrifice? No metaphor is worth that trade.

Dear Patrick,
The love of my life, a.k.a. my favorite bartender, is gone! No one pours beer or mixes gin and tonics like her. Sure, our relationship consisted of exchanging money for drinks and the occasional small talk, but it meant something, dammit! How do I go on?
Thanks,
Oh No! ’Tender Has Emigrated, Replacement Obviously Cannot Keep Satisfied
Dear ON THE ROCKS,
I know it’s hard, but you’re going to have to move on. There are a lot of other great bartenders out there, looking for regulars of their own. Sure, you may get your heart broken again, but you’ll come back stronger. You can drink your troubles away and meet a new bartender all in one go!
But let’s say you’re not ready to move on. You stumble home after visiting yet another disappointing bartender, missing your old flame, and thinking about finding her. Lucky for you, there’s the new Facebook Graph Search©! With this handy dandy web feature, you can just look up “former bartenders in Pittsburgh who moved to New York recently” and everyone matching that description will come up! Then just find her new job or hangout, show up, and ask for a drink! Why should stalking be limited to just ex-girlfriends?
Don’t actually do this,
Patrick Hoskins
Dear Patrick,
I recently appeared on the rap track of an up-and-coming local musician. I’m not really familiar with the “hip-hop” scene (I’m not really a fan of jumping), but I’m sure I will soon be quite famous. What can I do to further my burgeoning career? Keep in mind I have no actual talent or knowledge.
Thanks,
Track Has A Tremendous Secondary And Requires A Perusal
Dear THATS A RAP,
First, congratulations on your appearance! I’m sure you’ll be the breakout star of an incredibly popular album. Now that you’re famous, you’re going have to do something to stay in the limelight. I suggest becoming a “hype man.” All you gotta do is keep the crowd excited (or “hyped up”), and in return, you get to hang out with guys who are actually talented.
First, you have to wear some ridiculous clothes and a ton of bling. Second, you should figure out what you’re supposed to do. Basically, whenever the lead dude stops to breathe, just yell out the last thing he said or whatever else comes to mind. Pretty soon you’ll be one of the 20 guys “featured” in a Kanye track.
If Flavor Flav can do it, so can you,
Patrick Hoskins

The Rocky Horror Picture Show
8 10 12
This is the granddaddy of all cult classics. Evaluated purely on film criteria, Rocky Horror is a twisted, campy fairy tale — a spectacular mess. But watching this thing late at night with a horde of inebriated compatriots is occasionally transcendent. Be ready to sing along and shout at this pop culture touchstone that should never be forgotten and should be experienced at least once in a lifetime.
Beasts of the Southern Wild
8 10 12
Beasts was the Sundance baby of 2012. Heading into the festival, it wasn’t on anyone’s radar. Afterward, it began a rapid climb to national success and critical celebration. Beasts falls under that strange heading of magic realism, telling the story of a young girl and her alcoholic father who are rocked by the devastation of a Katrina-like hurricane. Quvenzhané Wallis stars as a six-year-old forced into a life of responsibility and independence. She delivers a truly astonishing performance that was honored by an Oscar nomination.
Anna Karenina
7:30 10 12:30
Taking on a major work of classic literature is possibly the most daunting challenge in moviemaking. Anna Karenina is based on Leo Tolstoy’s epic novel of the same name and stars Keira Knightley as the eponymous main character. The film has garnered an unexpected batch of award recognition for cinematography, costume design, and art direction. The first hour is a stunning achievement — every area of artistry firing on all cylinders. This film is an under-appreciated gem of 2012.

If you have the misfortune of living near me, you’ve probably heard me blasting Radiohead’s Amnesiac over the past couple of days. Earlier this week a friend recommended I read a review of the album by John Darnielle of the Mountain Goats on his blog, Last Plane to Jakarta. After reading the review, I couldn’t help but listen to the album on repeat.
What I found most striking about his review was its presentation. Unlike most, Darnielle’s review was posted in 10 segments released over the course 2001 and 2002, with each song considered individually. Furthermore, he did not consider Amnesiac in terms of OK Computer or Kid A, the band’s two most critically acclaimed albums.
I often find myself reading — and occasionally writing — music reviews that insist on looking at albums from a very fixed perspective. These reviews subsequently evaluate albums in terms of a band’s legacy and aesthetic, as opposed to looking at an album for what it is: a self-contained collection of songs. Darnielle’s review makes a point of showing how this former method obfuscates the gravity of an album and can end up portraying a masterpiece like Amnesiac as a castaway B-side collection.
Even though Darnielle’s review is over a decade old, it remains relevant to the current state of music journalism. Much of today’s writing is stale, hackneyed, and more concerned with legacy than with legitimate journalism. Darnielle’s particular style of in-depth musical analysis is not the most conventional model for how music journalism should be. However, it models critical, independent thought — a trait that all music reviewers should aim to reflect. While the legacy and cultural relevance of a band is important in its own right, music journalists should not allow these aspects to overshadow their evaluation of an album’s quality.

The spring semester at Carnegie Mellon has already been marked by a string of burglaries; in the past two weeks alone, four thefts have occurred. Money and laptops were stolen from Webster Hall, Resnik House, Fairfax Apartments, and the Kappa Alpha Theta sorority house.
According to the university’s crime alert email on these robberies sent out on Jan. 17, “CMU Police are working with the Pittsburgh Bureau of Police regarding a burglary suspect recently arrested in our area to ascertain if there is any connection to the incidents.”
Gary Scheimer, lieutenant of the University Police, said, “We made an arrest [Jan. 23rd] for the burglary on Webster. We don’t believe that the same man is involved in the other three; he was linked to a series of burglaries that occurred here and at Duquesne University and in the city of Pittsburgh.” Scheimer said that the suspect was out on parole when he committed the thefts and is now facing charges from Carnegie Mellon, the University of Pittsburgh, and the city of Pittsburgh.
Joseph Meyers, lieutenant of the University Police, confirmed that the suspect who is not affiliated with Carnegie Mellon confessed to not only the robbery at Webster Hall, but also to a string of thefts that span Duquesne University and the areas around Carnegie Mellon and the University of Pittsburgh.
“Right now he has a total of four cases, and I’m anticipating that Zone 5 detectives are going to arrest him on at least one other count, so he’s essentially a kind of serial burglar,” Meyers said.
Regarding the burglar at the Kappa Alpha Theta sorority house, Scheimer said, “We have descriptions of [him], and we’re trying to identify him and we’re working toward seeing if he’s linked with all three of the other ones.”
While the other burglaries, according to Scheimer, were committed by a thief who came in through an unlocked door, at the sorority house the suspect “confronted a student and more or less intimidated her through the guise of the fact that he had a meeting with an alum; he made her feel very ill at ease and she then admitted him into the building.” At that point, the thief found an unlocked door and stole cash from a drawer.
At Resnik, Scheimer said, the victim’s suite door was left unlocked and, although it was in the afternoon and someone was sleeping in one of the adjacent bedrooms, the thief left with a laptop and some cash. 
At Webster Hall and the Fairfax Apartments, the thief also entered through a door that a resident had left open. 
“This guy at Webster, we have him on video, he’s just going through trying doors, trying to find one that was open. And I sense that the same thing happened at Resnik and Fairfax,” Meyers said.
These recent thefts occur in the wake of last semester’s burglaries, in which thieves stole laptops from Hunt Library and several other academic buildings on campus. 
Scheimer admitted that Carnegie Mellon’s open campus provided an easy target for thieves: “On an open campus, they’re able to just come through buildings, walk through and see the laptops — they’re unattended, and it just takes a matter of seconds.”
Priscilla Kim, a first-year psychology major, was a victim of one such theft in November, when her laptop was stolen from Hunt Library. 
She was studying on the second floor of Hunt Library and left her backpack and laptop unattended to meet a friend on the first floor. 
Kim said, “I was originally planning to come back within 10 minutes, but then when I came back it was about 40 minutes after I left and my laptop was gone.”
Kim immediately called University Police and used a friend’s computer to log onto iCloud, a service provided by Apple. 
This allowed her to lock her Macbook with a password, display a message on the screen urging whomever found it to return it to Hunt Library, and find the location of the laptop if it was turned on in an area with Wi-Fi.
A week later, Kim reported, she got an email notifying her that iCloud had found the location of her laptop. 
She called the University Police again and gave them the address so that they could pursue the matter. 
On the first day of the spring semester, the police returned Kim’s laptop to her. 
The police found it after the owner of an electronic shop bought it from the thief and realized that it was stolen. 
Kim said, “The person who turned it in was someone who sells and buys used computers and tech devices. He said he bought it from an anonymous woman. Some woman had just given it to him for $100.”
On Dec. 12, 2012, the university released a crime alert via email that stated, “An unusually high number of thefts have recently occurred on campus. These thefts have involved unattended personal laptops and electronic devices in numerous buildings, but have mainly targeted Hunt Library and the University Center.”
The alert urged students to not leave laptops or other valuable goods unattended and to “report any suspicious persons or circumstances immediately to university police.” The thefts also prompted the university to post signs in the library and around campus with a similar message. Regarding the laptop thefts, Scheimer said that last semester similar thefts had been occurring at the University of Pittsburgh, where the thief was identified and interviewed. 
“He [the suspect] knew that they were onto him, so he moved on to the next campus,” he said. “They provided us with his name and information; we had undercover people in the library that had his picture and saw him acting suspiciously.”
Even though the police interviewed the suspect, they do not have enough information yet to make an arrest. They hope to acquire conclusive evidence by following the tracks of the stolen laptops. 
Although the suspect is not confirmed as the thief, Scheimer noted that after he was taken in, the laptop thefts immediately stopped.
A crime report email sent to students on Jan. 17 included several safety tips to help students avoid becoming victims, such as to “lock your doors and ground level windows, do not allow ‘piggybacking’ into secure areas by allowing individuals to closely follow you through the security door into the facility,” and “do not allow strangers access to your building, residence, or secured area.”
Scheimer talked about the importance of keeping card-access buildings secure. “It’s common courtesy for us; we’ve been taught since we were young to hold the door for somebody. But if a building has card access, it’s not rude to say ‘I have to close the door; I don’t know you; you have to let yourself in.’ It’s a very hard culture to break.”
As the trend of thefts continues, the police caution against leaving personal belongings unattended. Meyers echoed the sentiments of the email. “The biggest crime-prevention tip I can give is for people to use common sense — lock their doors and be aware of their surroundings. Those are two of the biggest things you can do to keep yourself from being a victim. When you leave the door open, you’re basically making yourself a victim.”

This year’s Fitness Challenge — an annual event held by the Department of Athletics to encourage campus members to exercise at least 20 minutes, four days a week — begins this Monday.
This year’s theme, entitled “CM-YOU,” emphasizes Carnegie Mellon’s global presence. “We want to raise awareness of Carnegie Mellon’s global degree programs in other countries,” said Pattye Stragar, the event’s organizer and operations manager for Fitness and Aquatics. 
After signing up for the Fitness Challenge, participants pick a country, and every 20 minutes of exercise scores a point for that country. Each country’s score is tracked on a map in front of the University Center fitness desk, and at the end of the six-week event, the people on the team of the country with the most points win. “For example, if I take an hour Zumba class and I’m on Team Qatar, I’ll color in three squares on the map for Qatar,” Stragar explained.
The CM-YOU Fitness Challenge will also encourage physical activity through lectures from local fitness experts, raffles, and a 5k run at Dick’s Sporting Goods.
This year, Stragar wants to especially target undergraduate students who don’t regularly exercise due to heavy school workloads. To do this, the Department of Athletics is partnering with the student-run ENACTUS Healthy Lifestyles Initiatives Project to help plan the CM-YOU Fitness Challenge. 
“I want to incorporate their perspectives as undergraduates, and in general, students are more receptive when approached by someone their own age,” Stragar said.
On their part, the Health Lifestyles Initiatives project leaders — sophomore business administration major Alice Ye, sophomore biomedical and chemical engineering double major Kristina Jang, senior psychology major Michael Kashaf, and senior biomedical and chemical engineering double major Sara Kashaf — are addressing concerns about students’ workload.
“We get it,” Jang said. “We are always swamped in work at Carnegie Mellon, so people will push health to the side to focus on schoolwork. But it doesn’t have to be this way.”
To fit many students’ busy schedules, the CM-YOU Fitness Challenge this year is offering “Minor,” “Major,” and “Double Major” levels of fitness goals. “For the students who are overloading or double majoring, we have the Minor, which is one to two days a week ... because we do recognize that you don’t have much time,” Ye said.
Although students can sign up for the Minor option, the project leaders recommend that students taking a regular course load should find time in their schedules for the Major option, which entails the Department of Athletics’ goal of four days of exercise. 
To do thiconvince studentsitiatives project is positing exercise as a way to manage stress.
“We want to change the coping mechanisms people have for their workloads. If you have a lot of work or stress, you tend to snack or just crash, so what we are trying to do is replace those bad habits with good ones,” Kashaf explained.
Students can register at the University Center equipment desk.

There was confusion concerning the official website for the business club Enactus, previously known as SIFE, this past week. 
Many students mistakenly thought that the SIFE website, www.cmusife.org, was hacked. 
The club’s leaders, however, clarified that they no longer hold domain over that address. 
The website that currently is a Japanese blog when translated into English, contains questions about sex shops in Osaka.
Nikita Anand, senior business administration and statistics major and Enactus senior advisor, said in an email to The Tartan, “Actually, our SIFE website was not hacked into. SIFE underwent a global rebranding and has now changed its name to ‘Enactus’. Therefore, we let our server expire so that we could get a new website that would be more fitting to our new name.”
Although SIFE recently changed its name to Enactus, which stands for “Entrepreneurial, Act, Us,” many students still refer to the club by its former name, which led to the confusion about the website.
“It’s actually nice that so many people noticed our website had changed, because this will help our promotional efforts to rebrand SIFE on our campus to Enactus and help the student body understand the new name,” Anand said.
Katie Cameron, sophomore information systems and decision science double major and president of Enactus, said, “[Enactus] has been going by SIFE, standing for Students in Free Enterprise. Now, as the organization spreads into all parts of the world, some regions don’t recognize free enterprise. Additionally, SIFE is supposedly a curse word in South Africa. Because SIFE didn’t want to be an acronym anymore, the international headquarters hired a consulting firm to change the name to something more closely aligned with the current actions the organization takes.”
The new Enactus page can be found at the website cmuenactus.org.

An email sent to the student body by Vice President for Campus Affairs Michael Murphy last Thursday announced a 4 percent increase in new undergraduate tuition rates for Carnegie Mellon’s 2013–14 academic year.
For 2013, tuition for incoming undergraduate students will be $46,670. Housing costs will be set at $7,070 and board costs at $4,920, which are increases of $260 and $180, respectively.
Tuition increases are the same as those announced last year for the current academic year, with a 3 percent tuition increase for current students, a 4 percent increase for incoming students, and graduate tuition rates continuing to depend on the department and program.
A university press release claimed that this increase “continues a four-year trend of among the lowest tuition increases by the university since 1975.”
In the email, it was emphasized that the transportation fee was substantially increased due to the nature of the university’s agreement with the Pittsburgh Port Authority. This fee will now cost $120, up from $55. Additionally, students were told they could find an increase in their activities fee, as a result of the recently passed referendum to increase the student activities fee. The student activities fee cost is now listed as $242.
Murphy added in the email, “While I am pleased that we have moderated the increase in tuition for continuing students, I also appreciate that our tuition is high by any standard. While much of this is due to underlying inflation, it is also due to our continued commitment to financial aid and to maintaining our funding for the exciting and vibrant community that is our university.”
The university press release emphasized that 57 percent of Carnegie Mellon students receive financial aid.
Murphy concluded his email by saying, “We remain dedicated to providing you with an excellent educational experience — one that prepares you well both professionally and personally.”
On collegedata.com, Carnegie Mellon released a statement regarding the cost of tuition saying, “There’s no denying it, a private college education like Carnegie Mellon’s is expensive. We hope that you and your family will consider the value of a college education from Carnegie Mellon to be an investment in your future.”
Carnegie Mellon’s recent 3 percent increase in tuition for current students and 4 percent increase for incoming students is substantially lower than tuition increases in previous years. The university raised tuition by over 7 percent in 2008 and 2009, and around 5 percent in years prior.
Despite the relatively low increase, students expressed discontent with the high tuition rates and the seemingly low amount of financial aid that they receive.
First-year design major Solomon Ng said, “I think that the increase is absolutely ridiculous because I’m not on financial aid, even though my parents make just above the mark where you can get financial aid. I think it’s kind of unfair. These debts will be with us forever, even after college. I understand that we come to Carnegie Mellon to get a quality education, but I’m going to spend so long trying to pay my debts off. Our tuition is already one of the highest in the nation. I don’t understand why it has to keep on going up.”
Junior electrical and computer engineering major Joon Kwon said, “I think the increase is a little too much. When I first came here tuition was around $50,000 and now it’s $60,000, and that’s a lot. There’s only so much my financial aid can do.”

A contracting worker was killed after being electrocuted while working in Wean Hall last Tuesday.
Harold Taylor Jr. — a 59- year-old man from Mt. Oliver, Pennsylvania — worked for the Eaton Electrical Company.
The Pittsburgh Post-Gazette reported on the same day that Taylor had been working in Wean Hall at the time of the accident, and a 911 call was placed at 10:20 a.m. He was pronounced dead on the scene half an hour later.
University spokesman Ken Walters commented to the Post-Gazette that the incident was an “industrial accident” and released no further details.
The university attempted to alert students, but for some members of the student body, the Alert System text message contained typographical errors, reading, “G¿¿¿ in Wean Hall responding to an isolated incident involving an individuaX¿¿¿orking with an outside contractor. There is no cause for evacuation or other precaution.”
As was verified by those who received the complete text message, the alert read, “As you may be aware, a number of emergency first responders are in Wean Hall responding to an isolated incident involving an individual working with an outside contractor. 
There is no cause of evacuation or other precaution.”
Later that day, Vice President for Campus Affairs Michael Murphy sent out an email to the Carnegie Mellon community specifying that the accident occurred on the second floor of Wean Hall and commented, “I know you join me in keeping the victim, his family and friends, and his colleagues in our thoughts and prayers.” 
Murphy declined to share the personal information of the victim in his email.
The Occupational Safety and Health Administration is investigating this incident, as is typical for an industrial accident.

Researchers develop password de-coder
Ashwini Rao, a software engineering Ph.D. student, and a team of other Carnegie Mellon researchers developed a password-cracking algorithm that accounts for grammar in order to prove the concept that certain passwords are more vulnerable than others. 
They tested the algorithm against 1,434 passwords containing 16 or more characters. 
Their results proved that grammar, whether good or bad, made passwords more vulnerable, and that a longer password is not always a safer password. 
According to a university press release, “A password composed of ‘pronoun-verb-adjective-noun,’ such as ‘Shehave3cats,’ is inherently easier to decode than ‘Andyhave3cats,’ which follows ‘noun-verb-adjective-noun.’ A password that incorporated more nouns would be even more secure.”
Rao said in a press release, “I’ve seen password policies that say, ‘Use five words.’ Well, if four of those words are pronouns, they don’t add much security.”
Alum wins Oscar in technical category 
Drew Olbrich (SCS ’92) will receive an Academy Award on Feb. 9 at the Scientific and Technical Awards Presentation for his work in creating the Light system, a system that was used for computer graphics lighting in movies such as Shrek, Madagascar, and other animated DreamWorks films.
The Scientific and Technical Awards honor those with achievements that have significantly contributed to the technical aspects of film.
According to a university press release, the Academy Awards released a statement that said, “Virtually unchanged from its original incarnation over 15 years ago, Light is still in continuous use due to its emphasis on interactive responsiveness, final-quality interactive render preview, scalable architecture, and powerful user-configurable spreadsheet interface.”
Former professor of computer science and robotics Doug James will also receive an award. 
James will be honored — along with Theodore Kim, Nils Thuerey, and Markus Gross — for the invention of new fluid simulation software.

In the wake of the recent shooting in Newtown, Conn., President Obama issued a series of 23 executive orders designed to act in place of gun control legislation. While they may be well intended, these executive orders are completely unconstitutional, incorrect, and abhorrent.
Here’s a fun fact: The words “executive” and “order” never appear together in the Constitution. Executive orders came about as a way for higher-ups in the executive branch to tell others in the executive branch, like the U.S. Department of Justice, how to better execute the will of the legislature. They are not and were never intended to replace legislation.
Imagine this hypothetical scenario that Charles Krauthammer, a Washington Post columnist, brought up when President Obama used executive orders to essentially bring the failed Dream Act into being.
Consider if former presidential candidate Mitt Romney had won the election in November — say he makes it his first priority to eliminate the capital gains tax. Legislation is created and brought to Congress. It passes the house and then Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid never brings it to the floor in the Senate, where it dies. A frustrated Romney then issues an executive order to the IRS, a part of the executive branch, saying that collecting the capital gains tax is not a priority and people won’t be audited or persecuted for failing to pay it.
The liberal uproar would be deafening. People left and right would slam Romney for bypassing the Constitution and creating his own legislation. They would be right to do so. 
We elected a President and a Congress, not a king and some jesters, even though it feels that way sometimes. There is a reason the President is given no legislative power other than a veto, which can be overruled. The Constitution clearly outlines a path for laws to be created. This is not that path. This is a dangerous slippery slope to a government that is not representative of the people. Founding father John Adams is famous for wanting “a government of laws and not of men.” This is the opposite of that. One man should not have the power to legislate anything under any circumstances.
That this is the second time the President has significantly gone around Congress to legislate is disgusting. 
This is a president who ran against former President George W. Bush, calling his an imperial presidency. This is the man who said that all laws before Congress would be put online for the people to read before they were passed, and then celebrated the passage of Obamacare within a week. The hypocrisy of Obama’s presidency should enrage every American citizen, and these executive orders should be greeted with disdain, not approval.
In my mind, our President may as well have gone into the National Archives and vandalized the Constitution. Throughout our history, we have let times of crisis destroy the liberty that made our nation great. We’re doing it again.
There is a way for appropriate legislation that prevents guns from getting into the hands of people like Adam Lanza to come about. Our government should be allowed to work the way it was designed to and not be bypassed by politicians who clearly have no respect for our founding principles or for representative government altogether.
In my mind, our President may as well have gone into the National Archives, passed the statue with “Eternal vigilance is the price of liberty” written on its base, and vandalized the Constitution. Throughout our history, we have let times of crisis destroy the liberty that made our nation great. We’re doing it again. There is a way for appropriate legislation that prevents guns from getting into the hands of people like Adam Lanza to come about.

On Tuesday, Harold Taylor Jr., a 59-year-old man who worked for Eaton Electrical Company, died in an electrical accident while working in Wean Hall. Soon after the incident, the Carnegie Mellon alert system, CMU ALERT Emergency Notification System (ENS), sent out the following message: “As you may be aware, a number of emergency first responders are in Wean Hall responding to an isolated incident involving an individual working with an outside contractor. There is no cause for evacuation or other precaution.”
While the alert was intended to calm any possible anxieties raised by the presence of medical personnel on campus, the wording of the message was imprecise and unclear, which could only serve to deepen those anxieties. Some students received an incomprehensible message containing typographical errors.
CMU ALERT ENS has been a work in progress since its creation. Sometimes students do not receive alerts in a timely fashion even when potentially dangerous situations, such as the northeast earthquake in 2011, are unfolding on or near campus. These issues first came to light during the Spring 2012 semester, when both Carnegie Mellon and the University of Pittsburgh suffered bomb scares and a shooting occurred at UPMC’s Western Psychiatric Institute and Clinic of UPMC.
Students clearly need to be notified of incidents of this magnitude, especially when they occur on or near campus. However, Taylor’s death was not a state of emergency — his death, while obviously carrying emotional weight, did not have immediate impact on the university. The alert clearly directs the disturbance away from the school, stating that the incident was “isolated” and involved an “individual working with an outside contractor.” 
If the event did not involve a university community member, and was not a threat of widespread violence, was an immediate alert necessary? As the alert stated, there was “no cause for evacuation or other precaution.” Carnegie Mellon handled this incident well, but perhaps the warning was unnecessary. 
For this type of tragic situation, CMU ALERT ENS could have sent out a campus-wide email later when it had more information, instead of issuing a campus alert so soon after the incident.

In response to the massive ponies chalked on the Merson Courtyard outside the University Center last week, I’m here to say I don’t understand brony culture. For those who don't know, brony culture is centered on the television series My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic, which first aired in 2010.
I’m not saying that adults watching children’s television programs confuses me. I’ve seen my fair share of Lizzie McGuire and Hey Arnold reruns well into adulthood — but that’s where I get confused. Even the youngest students at Carnegie Mellon were in their late teens in 2010. So how do young adults stumble upon a television series whose target demographic is, according to The Wall Street Journal, “three- to six-year old girl[s]”?
Maybe the better question is, what leads college students to spend hours watching the show and drawing chalk versions of the characters in the freezing cold? The art of chalking is a special part of Carnegie Mellon culture — one governed by its own set of rules — and is used by many organizations to advertise events or raise awareness about various subjects. So what’s the end goal for bronies chalking in the courtyard? Do they enjoy showing our campus what they care about, in the form of large-scale, pastel horses? Or am I completely misinterpreting brony culture and the motives behind the artwork?
Perhaps it's my lack of insider knowledge that keeps me from getting brony culture. I understand adults appreciating a good storyline, well-developed characters, or impressive animation — but here again, I get lost in my attempt to understand brony culture when it comes to bronies purchasing toys from the show and requesting “better merchandise” from Hasbro, as reported by wired.com in summer 2011. Are bronies playing with these toys, re-enacting the show they adore, or are they purchasing the toys as a monetary way of showing support for the television program?
Obviously, voicing a dissenting opinion (at least within the Carnegie Mellon community) on an issue of this sort is sure to prompt backlash from bronies and their supporters. And while I have no right to dictate what is normal or how people should spend their free time, I would like to understand the motivation behind this subculture better than I do now.
I’m not alone. Anyone who reads the Facebook page “CMU Confessions” knows the war between the bronies and the anti-bronies rages on between anonymous posters and outspoken individuals with conflicting opinions, with little progress toward acceptance or understanding from either party.
Although I find brony culture odd, and a bit confusing, I do not mean to be offensive to those who feel strongly about watching the television show or spending hours in Merson Courtyard chalking these ponies. My final takeaway from the research I did for this article — and from my interactions with Carnegie Mellon's self-proclaimed bronies — is that I might never understand brony culture, but it’s definitely not going away anytime soon.
For more information about bronies, visit Pillbox or another Tartan's view on the phenomenon.

When more people currently live on the planet than ever before, should we institute laws that regulate how many children people should be allowed to have?
According to the United States Census, at the time this article was written the population of the United States was 315,213,798 people, while the population of the entire world clocked in at 7,061,807,441 people. Comprehending the existence of that many people is extremely difficult, if not impossible. 
As one might expect, this extraordinary milestone elicits a variety of responses from our massive and excitable species. The two most dominant arguments in this case are between those who believe that this population explosion will eventually lead to environmental and social catastrophe, and those who believe that overpopulation is not the true problem — distribution of available resources is.
Fear of population size is nothing new. Thomas Malthus, an English economist, published a pamphlet on the evils of population growth in 1798. Malthusian fears were reawakened in October 2011, when the world population officially surpassed 7 billion. Professor Paul Elrich of Stanford University is the modern crown prince of panicking, and his book The Population Bomb predicts massive famines and widespread death if population is not held in check. Elrich told the progressive news site Raw Story that “nobody, in my view, has the right to have 12 children or even three if the second pregnancy is twins.” He suggests laws to limit the number of children people are allowed to have. 
This suggestion is completely ridiculous. Limiting the number of children adults can have is not only insulting, it is deeply impractical, and would almost certainly be unfair. Rinku Sen, president and executive director of the Applied Research Center, also told Raw Story that these laws could be circumvented by the wealthy. Sen also discusses the possible impact these laws could have on minorities, and she’s right to be concerned. Determining who can have children under what circumstances is a slippery slope, and a perfect playing field for the nastier sides of any given culture to come out. A prime example of this phenomenon is China, where the one-child law led to an increase in female infanticide and gender-selective abortion. 
If population must be limited, a far better suggestion would be to increase the availability of reliable birth control. Susan Wood, interim chief executive of the International Women’s Health Coalition, argues in The New York Times that “another essential strategy is to invest in the largest population ever of young people entering their reproductive years, 85 percent of them in developing countries ... with comprehensive sexuality education, combined with health information and services.” An increasingly massive population means a population filled with young people. In order to slow population growth, young people need to know how to avoid pregnancy. Heterosexual intercourse is always going to carry the risk of pregnancy, but that sex does not have to result in children. People are not going to stop having sex, even if they cannot support the children that they might produce. 
Not everyone believes that the population growth modern Malthusians fear is so catastrophic. Dominic Lawson of The Independent argues that “there are not (and never will be) too many people for the planet to feed.” The article goes on to argue that the world has enough agricultural produce and the technology to feed everyone, but that technology is not implemented effectively. In the same article, Joel Cohen, professor of earth and environmental science at Columbia University, says that “those who say the whole problem is population are wrong. It’s not even the dominant factor.” So, the problem is distribution, not supply. The idea that the planet generates enough food to feed every person on the planet, and yet people still starve, is insane. 
Laws to limit population growth are both impractical and absurd. Ensuring better universal access to birth control would be a much better idea, as would improving our methods of food distribution. Instead of worrying about how many people will live on the planet in the future, we should be worrying about how to feed all the people who live on the planet now.

Laura Safe, a radio newscaster, was texting her boyfriend when she fell into a canal in Birmingham, England outside a local shopping center. Despite the freezing water, Safe was rescued without injury.
Although this accident had a happy ending, many accidents resulting from walking and texting do not. According to the Consumer Product Safety Commission, 1,152 Americans visited the emergency room in 2011 after sustaining injuries while walking and using a hand-held electronic device.
With so many injuries caused by simultaneously texting and walking, it is a wonder that people continue to perform such a dangerous action.
We realize that it may seem obvious not to text and walk, but sometimes it’s hard to resist the allure of a buzzing cell phone in one’s pocket.
We see people rapidly texting while crossing the corner of Forbes and Morewood. We see them checking Facebook or changing their music while shuffling along the Cut. We even see them bumping into others on the way to class while playing Temple Run or Angry Birds.
Most of us at The Tartan are guilty of distracted walking on campus. Therefore, we’ve created a set of rules that we try to follow ourselves. We’d like to share them with you:
Don’t text while walking — unless it’s an emergency. Even then, you might want to call whomever it is you’re texting. No matter the case, pay attention to your surroundings.
Facebook posts and Fruit Ninja can wait until you reach your destination. Sure, you might have to wait a few minutes to break your high score, but at least you won’t be an accident waiting to happen. 
You might even see people you haven’t seen for a while as they walk by. Maybe you’ll discover something new on campus, like the latest message on the fence, or the university’s new robotic squirrel.
You could even realize that 10 minutes away from technology while walking to class is liberating.
If none of those reasons to put your phone down are appealing, at least other people around you — if they aren’t already on their own phones — will appreciate not being bumped into.
Although you may not have to worry about falling into a canal, you can ensure that you aren’t a victim of distracted walking while on campus.

The world of sports has always had its liars: Pete Rose, Lance Armstrong, and Barry Bonds, to name a few. Now, this shameful company makes room for one more member — Manti Te’o.
This college football season, Te’o, 22, was the owner of an incredible story. Motivated by the deaths of his grandmother and girlfriend, he carried the University of Notre Dame to a 12–1 record. Only the girlfriend — Lennay Kekua never existed. Te’o and Kekua maintained an online relationship and never met face to face; it turns out she was the fiction of another man’s cruelty. Last Thursday, during an interview with Katie Couric, Te’o admitted that he lied to cover the hoax.
That Te’o admitted the truth without a fight is enough to distinguish him from sports’ more notorious liars. Yet, it would be an understatement to say that he was just the victim of his own naiveté. Te’o, as gullible as he was, also wanted his story to be true. He cherished the attention and the meaning others drew from his story.
“The only thing that I basked in was that I had an impact ... people turned to me for inspiration,” he told Couric. To become that inspirational figure, he ignored the numerous red flags in his false relationship. Once he ignored the flags, his story became too good to give up.
Though Te’o is the central character in this tale, he is not the only one who deserves criticism.
For all the attention on Te’o, few in the media have pointed out their own gullibility. Since Kekua supposedly died on Sept. 12, publications such as Sports Illustrated and the Chicago Tribune covered this improbable story without any source other than Te’o himself. For nearly four months, no one bothered confirming the death of Kekua. Within five days, Deadspin, the sports website that first broke the story, was able to investigate and publish their article upon receiving a tip.
That the media remained clueless for so long does not necessarily show poor journalism, but show our fascination with heroic athletes. Herein lies the bigger problem. Elite athletes should never be worshiped, but respected from afar. Collegiate athletes, in particular, are unworthy and not mature enough for this status. Responsibility then lies with the university to protect its student athletes.
At Texas A&M University, first-year football players are not allowed to speak with the media. Had such a policy existed for Te’o, who knows if we would have even heard of his girlfriend. The sad thing is that it would not have made any difference. For some reason, his head coach, Brian Kelly, had to tell reporters of his tragic story.
As much as Te’o had to gain from this story, so did Notre Dame  through the tickets fans bought to see this phenomenon — the high school football player who saw Notre Dame as a place to build his own story. It’s unfortunate that little is done to protect and nurture these young men in the mega-million dollar enterprise that is college football.
As the many layers of the tale of Te’o unravel, it becomes more apparent that Te’o is not the only one who should be scrutinized. I find it disheartening that he is the one who is being ripped apart while the important institutions surrounding him remain unscathed.
Nevertheless, every tale needs a moral. My take for this tale: Don’t trust everything on the Internet.

The age of information presents a strange paradox: We can know what happens on the other side of the world in a matter of minutes, but most Americans remain relatively uninformed about the world's most important issues.
In 2012, a Fairleigh Dickinson University study revealed that less than half of Americans could answer questions correctly about international news and domestic affairs. A 2009 Pew Poll revealed that the public’s ability to judge the accuracy of news stories is at a 20-year low. Despite an increase in the amount of information people can access, the public is still uninformed. Even worse, the institutions informing the public seem to have degraded.
In the past, when there was a limited number of media sources, people put their confidence in a few large news companies. These companies, who could depend on a steady stream of differing views, were invested in informing Americans and greatly valued the quality of their own reporting. Due to explosive growth in communications technology, however, people now have vast amounts of information at their fingertips. 
The Information Age has not only changed the nature of the American news media, but also of the American viewer. Because of the great number of news sources that have cropped up, people can pick and choose where they get their information. Naturally, they pick the most entertaining sources.
As a result, news sources today compete for views and advertisement revenue by catering to what people want to see, rather than what they need to see. Investigative journalism has become time consuming and costly in an age where the national attention has been enthralled by instantaneous blogging and Twitter. News sources focus on making news entertaining rather than informative through sensationalist reporting, celebrity gossip, or vociferous media personalities.
In that same vein, news stations targeting a specific demographic, such as FOX and MSNBC, have also been on the rise. Though these sources are very profitable, they are undoubtedly biased and are often less informative than more objective news sources, according to the Fairleigh Dickinson study. Of course, there are also relatively accurate, news-focused sources out there, such as NPR, the BBC, and C-SPAN, but they do not receive the national attention that their more gimmicky counterparts do.
The real problem lies in the fact that the Age of Information, although it has done much good, has also allowed news sources to indulge in entertainment and frivolity, distracting them and their audience from the issues that matter. To make America more informed, we have to change the people, not the technology.

Whether people are talking about Beyonce’s alleged lip syncing or about President Obama’s inaugural speech, everyone can agree that Obama’s inauguration was incredibly controversial.
It seems as if the gloves are off for Obama in his last term as president, and he’s not pulling any punches this time.
His speech begs the question: After such a politically charged first term and divisive second election, why would he make it such a point to introduce his liberal views in his inauguration address?
In the speech, he talked about gay rights: “Our journey is not complete until our gay brothers and sisters are treated like anyone else under the law, for if we are truly created equal, then surely the love we commit to one another must be equal, as well.”
He advocated for more liberal immigration laws: “Our journey is not complete until we find a better way to welcome the striving, hopeful immigrants who still see America as a land of opportunity, until bright young students and engineers are enlisted in our workforce rather than expelled from our country.”
He even mentioned climate control, something he didn’t spend very much time on during his presidential campaign, and called out the people who oppose it: “We will respond to the threat of climate change, knowing that the failure to do so would betray our children and future generations. Some may still deny the overwhelming judgment of science, but none can avoid the devastating impact of raging fires, and crippling drought, and more powerful storms.”
He also implied that he plans on using more of his executive power this term and working things from an administrative angle, instead of spending his time in lengthy arguments with his conservative opponents in Congress.
While I agree with many of his policies as a feminist-environmentalist-gay rights liberal, it scares me a little that he’s willing to alienate a lot of America that quickly.
The size of the rift between the two parties is disconcerting, but what scares me more is the rift between the ideologies. 
It’s getting to the point where compromise seems to not only be a taboo word in Congress, but a concept that doesn’t seem possible anymore.
I don’t want such a divided country. 
I don’t want partisan fights like the debt ceiling crisis and the fiscal cliff fiasco to keep happening. 
The country seems to be in a high-pressure political mess of rights, health care, and religion, and I think Obama’s speech, while glowing and offering the kind of change that I would love to see, turned up the heat.

The National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) has asserted that they can protect online postings to the same degree as verbal discussions of working conditions. The NLRB helps union workers organize and curtail an employer’s ability to prevent employees from discussing their working conditions. However, the NLRB protections are only useful in narrow circumstances; it is still important to consider what we say online and remain professional at all times.
According to The New York Times, the NLRB recently ruled that it was illegal for a nonprofit social services provider, Hispanics United of Buffalo, to dismiss five employees based on angry posts made on Facebook. Case worker Mariana Cole-Rivera had made accusations online that other employees were not pulling their own weight. In response to her accusations, another case worker asked “My fellow co-workers, how do you feel?” Several employees responded to the question with unrestrained, often profane, posts.
Hispancs United said the posts violated its harassment policies, but the NLRB says that the posts — even the profane ones — are protected, since the employees were discussing conditions with each other in a way the board found to be a concentrated effort to offer “mutual aid.”
In recent years the intersection of social media, free speech, and anti-harassment policies has been turbulent. Schools have punished students for cyberbullying and employers have fired workers for negative remarks in both official and unofficial capacities. The Internet isn’t private; the repercussions of a heated post could be dire.
However, the protection granted by the NLRB is limited to online discussions between workers about improving conditions or wages. It also only applies to workplace situations, and not to schools and students. And even in cases where the NLRB can intervene, it’s better to tread cautiously — there’s no guarantee that labor regulators will rule against the employer.
