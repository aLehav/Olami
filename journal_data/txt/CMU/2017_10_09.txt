The women’s soccer team, now ranked 10th nationally, beat Nazareth College 2–0 on Tuesday afternoon. Their record is now 8–1–1 for the season, and Tuesday’s game was the fifth win in a row for the Tartans. It was a physical game, and the Tartans relied on their speed and skill to defeat the Golden Flyers.
Nazareth dominated possession for the first few minutes of play, but the Tartans pushed back hard. Eight minutes into the first half, sophomore forward Ryan Casey scored her first goal as a Tartan off an impressive solo effort. Casey took the ball from the right side of the field and dribbled through the defense before giving the Tartans the 1–0 lead. Nazareth continued their offensive momentum, but stellar defense by the Tartans held them to just one shot on goal.
As the first half continued, play began to get rougher, with a total of eight fouls called in the first half alone. Pressure continued on both ends throughout the half to no avail, although in the 36th minute, a corner taken by senior midfielder Tori Iatarola appeared to cross the goal line. However, the ruling on the field was no goal, and the half ended with the Tartans up 1–0.
In the second half, the Tartans dominated initial play, with multiple shots and corners in the first few minutes. In the 58th minute, on the third corner in a row, junior midfielder Tessa Allen headed the kick in from the far back post past the goalie, scoring her first goal of the season and the second goal of the day for the Tartans. Carnegie Mellon continued this level of play, and although they dominated Nazareth in the second half of the game, they were unable to score another goal.
The total foul count for the game was 18 fouls overall, and in the 77th minute, Nazareth was given a yellow card. Although nothing came of these penalties, despite the Tartans being given a kick only a few yards from outside the box, this physical style of play dominated the game and made for an aggressive showing.
First-year goalkeeper Carolyn Botz secured her sixth shutout of the season, making strong plays out of the back end despite only needing to make one save. The Tartans finished the game with 14 shots, 8 on goal, while the Golden Flyers had only 5 shots with 1 on goal. The Tartans also had 8 corner kicks in the game and used them to set up many of their offensive plays.
On Saturday, Oct. 7, the Tartans took on Brandeis University and tied 1–1. The Tartans are now 8–1–2 for the season and 1–0–1 in University Athletic Association (UAA) play.
The two scores came at the last minute of each half. The Judges scored first after converting a corner kick with 47 seconds left in the first half.
Junior midfielder Tessa Adams, assisted by senior defender Katie Strycharz, scored the lone goal for the Tartans with 55 seconds left in the second half to tie the game 1–1.
The Tartans will next face the top ranked University of Chicago in Chicago, IL on Friday, Oct. 13.

The 11th-ranked Carnegie Mellon men’s soccer team defeated the Penn State Behrend Lions at home on Tuesday, Oct. 3, improving its record to 8–1–1. The Tartans got on the board in the fourth minute of the match and did not relinquish their lead, winning the game 2–1.
The Tartans began the match with an aggressive offensive attack. Thirty-five seconds into the match, junior forward Anthony Gulli took the first shot of the game, which went high. Three minutes later, a corner kick from Gulli set up a header by sophomore defender Jacob Moskowitz to put the Tartans up 1–0. The goal was the first of Moskowitz’s career. The Tartans and the Lions traded several shots throughout the first half, some wide or high. In the 16th and 22nd minutes, shots by the Lions were saved by Carnegie Mellon’s junior goalkeeper Alec Lam. Past the midpoint of the half, the Tartans took control of the ball, with shots on goal in the 26th, 30th, 25th, and 41st minutes that were saved by the Lions’ goalkeeper. At the half, the Tartans remained ahead 1–0.
The Lions began the second half with a shot on goal in the 51st minute, which was saved by Lam. The Tartans continued to set the pace with a goal from junior midfielder Zack Masciopinto in the 59th minute, his seventh of the season, giving the Tartans a 2–0 lead. The Lions, however, responded 32 seconds later to cut the Tartans’ lead in half. Tartans had a shot on goal in the 84th minute, but the final 30 minutes of the match were scoreless.
Lam finished the game with three saves in his eighth win of the season. Carnegie Mellon had 13 total shots to Penn State Behrend’s 10, and eight corner kicks to one.
On Saturday, Oct. 7, the Tartans dominated play against 15th-ranked Brandeis University in a University Athletic Association (UAA) showdown but came up empty for the first time of the 2017 season in their first loss since the season opener.
The Tartans established their commanding play early in the match with a shot by Gulli in the third minute that went wide and a header shot on goal by sophomore midfielder Jack Painter in the fifth minute. In the ninth minute, the Judges scored off a corner kick to take the lead. The Cardinal and Gray went back on the offensive but watched several shots sail wide. In the 32nd minute, the Judges scored again after another corner kick, adding to their lead. The Tartans had three shots in the next two minutes by sophomore midfielder Elliot Cohen and Masciopinto, all blocked by the Brandeis defense. The first half ended with the Tartans trailing 2–0.
The opening minutes of the second half saw Cohen, Painter, and Gulli have shots on goal, only for all three to be saved by Brandeis’ goalkeeper. The Tartans continued their attack on the Judges’ offense with ten shots in the second half but failed to cut the deficit. The Judges won 2–0.
The Tartans had 22 total shots and 12 on goal to the Judges’ 8, and 11 corner kicks to their 5. Lam made three saves, while the Brandeis goalkeeper made 12.
The Tartans will next play the top-ranked University of Chicago.

On Saturday, Oct. 7, the football team set out to face Washington & Jefferson, their football rival for the day. The varsity team knew the stakes of the game and prepared extensively in hopes of beating them. Instead, Washington & Jefferson handed the Tartans their first loss of the year, bringing their record to 5–1 overall and 3–1 in Presidents’ Athletic Conference (PAC) play.
The first quarter ended 7–0 in the Presidents’ favor. After calling their first timeout in the second quarter, the team was confronted with the Presidents’ second touchdown. Halftime seemed to consolidate the Tartans’ efforts as they made two touchdowns in the third quarter alone; at the end of the third quarter, the score was 20–13. The fourth quarter resulted in touchdowns for both Washington & Jefferson and the Tartans but presented a penalty that seriously hindered the Tartans’ efforts. After a fumble with the ball at 3:16 on the clock, the pass from junior quarterback Alex Cline to sophomore wide receiver Jamie Greenwell which gained the team 60 yards was called back due to a penalty. The game ended 27–20 in the Presidents’ favor.
“They came out and they played great. I mean... [in the] second half we got the ball rolling a little bit and [were] feeling the chemistry between me and the receivers more. But [we] just came up short in the end,” said Cline.
The Tartans were determined to beat Washington & Jefferson since their defeat would automatically qualify the team for the conference.
Instead, the team will now have to prove themselves through the rest of their season games in order to make it to the conference and possibly the championship.
Senior inside linebacker Stanley Bikulege said, “The end goal is obviously to win the conference and win the national championship and these guys are a top 15 team in the country [who are] always in the running for conference championship. [They are a] really good team all around. It was a challenge prepping for these guys [and] we knew it was going to be a battle.”
Due to the significance of this game, the team researched Washington & Jefferson’s past plays and current players in hopes of gaining an advantage. This process consisted of the team watching games the team played in the past and then simulating the plays with other players.
“They have a great wide receiver, #87, so we focused our playing on him a little bit while defensively focusing on taking care of the run plays and stopping their pass plays. Watching film and having our scout team simulate their offense [help us prep] for every game like it’s the best game we’re gonna play,” said Bikulege.
The team honored Cindy Lackner, Coach Rich Lackner’s late wife, during the game through the organized effort to wear pink. Lackner, who died of breast cancer, has been honored annually for the past six years; proceeds of events such as raffles at the game are donated to research for breast cancer, as well.
Organized efforts of the team to honor Lackner and succeed in their play did not go to waste; despite their loss, the team strengthened their plays through preparation for the game and improved as a collective unit.
“My team was fighting their tails off the whole time; I can’t say anyone didn’t give 110 percent effort so I’m really happy with how our guys played. [I’m] really proud of my team,” said Bikulege.
The Tartans will look to rebound against Geneva College on Saturday, Oct. 14.

It was bound to happen eventually, though it feels like it happened one week earlier than it should have. No matter how well you build your team, it’s always subject to insanity when the games actually occur, and this week’s chaotic combination of developments led me to the biggest loser spot this week.
Third-String Team over Easy Breesy 104.9–85.5
Assistant Sports Editor Marika Yang finally got her first win of the season over my team. Both of our teams had lackluster performances across the board: six players on Yang’s team were held to single digits compared to five on my team. Kansas City Chiefs tight end Travis Kelce scored 24.4 points, a much-needed turnaround from his one-catch, one-yard performance last week. The Seattle Seahawks defense took advantage of the Indianapolis Colts sans quarterback Andrew Luck, earning 22 points. Cincinnati Bengals wide receiver A.J. Green put out a respectable 17.3 points.
On my end, New Orleans Saints quarterback Drew Brees provided the most points for me with 19. Chiefs running back Kareem Hunt had 16.1, a respectable, if ordinary number. Buffalo Bills running back LeSean McCoy gave an average 13.8 points, still not having found the end zone once this season. Atlanta Falcons wide receiver Julio Jones suffered a hip injury in the second quarter, leaving him with only 6 points. Denver Broncos wide receiver Demaryius Thomas only earned 2.1 points due to the poor play from quarterback Trevor Siemian.
Yes We Cam over Team Andah 160.6–109.5
Staffwriter Josh Andah finds himself at the other end of a blowout this week as Editor-in-Chief India Price’s team destroyed him. Dallas Cowboys running back Ezekiel Elliot roared to life with a 29.9 point performance, and Houston Texans running back Lamar Miller nearly matched that amount with 29.1. New York Giants quarterback Eli Manning provided 27.7 points. When even Price’s defense (Pittsburgh Steelers) and her kicker (New England Patriots’ Stephen Gostkowski) provided 15 points apiece, the makings of a blowout were there.
On Andah’s side, Seahawks quarterback Russell Wilson earned 27.6 points, keeping up with Manning’s production. Tampa Bay Buccaneers wide receiver Mike Evans captured 17.7 points, and Chicago Bears running back Jordan Howard earned a respectable 14.3. Two big disappointments kept Andah from competing with Price. Steelers wide receiver Antonio Brown only got 7.4 points as the Steelers’ big lead meant more running instead of passing. On the flip side, Los Angeles Chargers running back Melvin Gordon notched a mere 3.9 points as his team fell behind early and abandoned the running game.
Justin Tucker Must (not) Die over Drop it like it’s Crock 136.5–95.3
Watch out, everybody. Contributing Editor Lula Beresford seems to have made up for her awful draft strategy with solid waiver wire moves, as her team moved to overwhelmingly defeat Publisher Jade Crockem’s team. Steelers running back Le’Veon Bell led the way with 34.6 points and Jacksonville Jaguars running back Leonard Fournette gave a strong 24.5-point performance. Patriots quarterback Tom Brady rounded out her top performers with 20.5 points.
On Crockem’s side, Packers wide receiver Jordy Nelson led with 23.5 points. Cowboys quarterback Dak Prescott earned a strong 22.6 points. Unfortunately for Crockem, that’s where the strong performances ended. Packers running back Ty Montgomery earned a measly 2.8 points, and Cowboys tight end Jason Witten produced a paltry 1.9 points.
The week already looks bleak for me: Brees, Thomas, and Jones are all on their bye weeks. Additionally, Patriots tight end Rob Gronkowski was too injured to play Thursday night, and I didn’t check until it was too late.
Elsewhere, Yang’s replacement quarterback, Alex Smith of the Chiefs, may not be able to make up the difference between her roster and Price’s roster. Beresford’s addition of Bills tight end Charles Clay will help beat down Andah’s team, as he has not replaced his kicker on by week.

MIT engineers develop robot that can walk with humans
On Sept. 25, engineers from the Massachusettes Institute of Technology (MIT) presented a robot at the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) and Robotics Society of Japan (RSJ) International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems in Vancouver. 
This robot can navigate pathways alongside humans, without tripping up anyone. It follows the social rules of walking in public spaces such as passing left, keeping to the right and respecting personal space.
According to Science News, this robot has very different programming from autonomous vehicles because it has to navigate many non-fixed, “highly unpredictable paths” alongside humans, who have a very loose set of rules and etiquette while deciding their own path.
This robot uses many different sensors, including a depth sensor, with which it was taught to walk.

Scientists find pesticides in most of the world’s honey
European Scientists have found neonicotinoid in three-fourths of the honey samples that they collected from around the world by asking people to send honey. This was the first global honey-testing survey of its kind.
Neonicotinoid is responsible for the bees’ reduced survival rate and immune responses. It was also found that worker bees exposed to this chemical were more likely to have lower life expectancies and were more likely to permanently lose their colonies’ queen.
In an article on BBC’s website, one of the researchers of the study, Professor Pywell, from the Centre for Ecology and Hydrology in Oxfordshire said, “This is important because many crops globally are insect pollinated and without pollinators, we would struggle to produce some foods.”.
This study was published in Science.

Netflix prices rise by 10 percent after two years
Starting Oct. 19, Netflix will start notifying its customers of its price hike. This increase has been in place since Thursday and affects over 50 million users. The standard service will now cost $10.99 instead of $9.99 and the premium service will be $13.99 instead of $11.99. The basic streaming plan will still be priced the same. 
This is the first price hike since the last one in 2015.
In 2015, when the company introduced a $1 increase to their standard service, the companies shares dropped to a three-year low, after subscriber growth slowed down. This price increase comes shortly after their intent to spend $6 billion to produce more original content, which seems to be its only competitive advantage as of now.

“We need to teach ethics to nerds,” is how author and data scientist Cathy O’Neil summarized her first step in trying to address the problem of algorithmic bias that she outlined in her talk on Sept. 25. This event, hosted by a local non-profit media organization, Public Source, drew in around 300 people, including the CMU Robotics Team, to the Lecture Hall in the Carnegie Library of Pittsburgh to hear O’Neil dispel what she sees as the myth that algorithms are inherently equitable.
O’Neil explains that algorithms are “things you use data for to predict something.” In order to make this prediction, “you need data and a definition of success.” In her career at a hedge fund during the 2008 financial crisis and as a data scientist at advertising start-ups, O’Neil saw these core components of algorithms leading to sometimes morally dubious outcomes.
O’Neil concluded that data used to construct or train algorithms can be used to “automate the status quo,” as they lead the model to “they actually propagate whatever practices we had that the data reflected back to us.” Additionally, she observed that “everyone who builds an algorithm is in charge of defining success,” and what constitutes success looks different for different people. Presenting algorithms as unbiased, O’Neil finds, hides the question of “for whom does the model fail.”
This belief, that algorithms can on occasion reinforce rather than mitigate systemic bias, does not begin or end with O’Neil. Studies and news stories chronicling the impact of algorithms with flawed success criteria or datasets have abounded as of late, with ProPublica’s series on Machine Bias reporting on “Risk Scores” that are more likely to falsely label black prisoners as likely to re-offend and prompting Facebook to stop allowing housing advertisers to filter the desired audience by race, and a 2015 study at Carnegie Mellon showing that ads for higher-paying jobs on Facebook were shown more frequently to men than women.
Carnegie Mellon is an institution that often sends its graduates to work at large tech companies like Facebook and Google that are creating and implementing these algorithms that touch the lives of millions. Namely, it is a hub for the “nerds” that O’Neil deemed in need of ethics education.
Professor David Danks, head of the department of philosophy and L.L. Thurstone Professor of Philosophy and Psychology, and co-author of the paper “Algorithmic Bias in Autonomous Systems” found that when teaching about building algorithms, the AI and Machine Learning curriculum “does a good job of helping students to understand the importance of “loss functions,” or what O’Neil referred to as the definition of success. The development of these loss functions or success criteria is so important, he explains, because “algorithms largely attempt to optimize whatever loss function is provided to them, and so it is critical to understand their role in an algorithm.”
Where the curriculum is lacking, Professor Danks continued, was in teaching students about where to “ensure that our training or historical data actually track the world that we want, rather than the world as it is,” and in identifying that loss functions are subject to human error and bias.
These effects are not easy for students to diagnose on their own, as he states that “even for seemingly “objective” challenges, the success criteria are ultimately chosen by the human developers, and that is another possible source of bias, as humans do not always know what they actually want (and so might choose the wrong loss function).” Professor Jim Herbsleb in the Institute of Software research in SCS, who teaches the class Ethics and Policy Issues in Computing, agreed, stating that “many students are surprised that algorithms can and often do exhibit biases that reflect and perhaps even amplify bias in the training data.”
Professor Danks thinks that the challenge in teaching about the societal impacts of algorithms stems from the “widespread view that we can separate technological development from the introduction of values or ethical standards.” This separation leads to a situation where “the CMU curriculum, like most undergraduate curricula, tends to focus on the technological elements in isolation. So, for example, people will learn how an algorithm functions, or what variations in the data will lead to different models. But there is relatively little discussion of values when these algorithms are being taught.”
This practice of separation becomes questionable, supplies Professor Alex London Professor Danks’s co-author for Algorithmic Bias in Autonomous Systems and Clara L. West Professor of Ethics and Philosophy, because as decision processes typically left to humans become automated, one type of bias judged is deviation from “norms that are fundamentally ethical in nature, such as equality, fairness, and justice.” This means for Professor London that “developers of these systems not only need to be technically proficient, they need to understand the larger social contexts in which their systems will act and the social and ethical norms to which its decisions need to conform.”  As the ability to navigate these ethical judgments becomes more central to the job of a developer, conversations like PublicSource’s Cathy O’Neil event and classes like Ethics and Policy Issues in Computing are available to those who seek them out.  How many do so remains to be seen, as Professor Herbsleb observes that students tend to seek out classes that will look more impressive to employers than his class, which draws only a few computer science students every year. He finds this to be “understandable, of course. But I do worry that our graduates are not necessarily well equipped to think through the ethical, policy, and social implications of what they will be asked to do, or of their own innovative ideas.”

The 2017 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine was awarded to Jeffrey C. Hall of the University of Maine, Michael Rosbash of Brandeis University, and Michael W. Young of Rockefeller University for their studies of the biological clock. According to The Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences, the three scientists “were able to peek inside our biological clock and elucidate its inner workings. Their discoveries explain how plants, animals, and humans adapt their biological rhythm so that it is synchronized with the Earth's revolutions.”
Hall and Rosbash collaborated to identify and isolate the “period gene” in fruit flies at Brandeis University in the 1980s. This gene is responsible for encoding the protein that builds up at night when we sleep and degrades during the day. As such, the body takes many of its temporal cues based upon the different levels of this protein at different times of the day.
Young, however, discovered and isolated the “timeless gene,” responsible for producing the proteins required to stop the production of the proteins from the period gene. This cyclical production of these proteins is dependent upon the light in our environment. This principle is evident in the biology of our brains. An area of the brain, known as the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) connects the retinas to the pineal gland, responsible for producing melatonin, which is directly responsible for regulating sleep.
From our sleep cycle to regulating our hormones, temperature, and metabolism, this microscopic biological “clock”, present in all carbon-based life forms — plants, animals, and humans controls our circadian rhythms and directly influences all aspects of our biology and is dependent upon the different levels of the aforementioned proteins within our cells. Their work led to the establishment of the field of chronobiology. The research into our circadian rhythms has yielded enormous dividends for people from all walks of life. Scientists are now studying how our circadian rhythms affect things such as hunger, cognitive function, stress, heart function and our immune systems. 
Of more importance, however, is what happens is when these internal clocks are out of “sync” or not regular. For example, a study to determine the effects of social jet lag (shifting one’s sleep cycle by a few hours) found that shifting participants' sleep cycle by a mere one hour each day put the same kind of stress on the human body similar to that of being diabetic in a three-week trial.
Even though modern society is no longer slave to the rotations of our planet around the sun, the light-dark cycle still rules supreme. Light is still amongst the most impactful of influences on our general health through the circadian rhythm. This is because certain chemicals in our brain are only produced under the right lighting conditions and spending one’s day in a dimly lit environment or looking at bright lights right before we go to sleep can dampen our natural rhythms. 
It is evident that our internal clocks are an imperative facet of our lives.

Tadpoles use poisons to defend themselves against their numerous predators, which include fish, birds, and insects. Last week, new research found that tadpoles may also use their poison to get an edge in the competition for resources. The tadpoles of the common toad are more poisonous when there are lots of other tadpoles to compete with, the study found. The more crowded an area is, the more poison is found in the tadpoles there.
In the study, Hungarian ecologist Veronika Bókony and her colleagues divided toad tadpoles into simulated ponds. The team wanted to approximate varying levels of competition, so different ponds had different numbers of tadpoles. In some ponds, the toad tadpoles were mixed with frog tadpoles; some had only toads, and some had only frogs. The frogs were included in the study to represent increased competition because they grow faster and larger than the toads. As predicted, the tadpoles from more competitive (crowded) ponds grew up to be more toxic, no matter what species they were competing with. 
Surprisingly, at equal levels of competition, the tadpoles produced more toxin against their own species than they did with the frogs. Biologists have generally believed that greater population density causes tadpoles to become more toxic, based on observations of tadpoles in the wild, but this study provided the first evidence from a controlled experiment in the lab.
The study’s findings, along with the quality of the research, are making an impression among Bókony’s peers in the ecology community. The study is “very well designed,” says Thomas Hossie, an ecologist at Trent University. “This paper is another great example of how amazingly plastic larval amphibian traits really are.” Gary Bucciarelli, an ecologist from the University of California, Los Angeles, called the findings “compelling.”
Beyond the immediate implications for tadpole research, the study reflects the changing way scientists examine why protective traits evolve. Traditionally, it was thought that animals evolve protective traits like poison so they can defend themselves against predators. But findings like these “really begin to scrutinize the idea that predation alone drives variation in animal chemical defenses,” says Buciarelli.
Bókony plans to continue researching the tadpoles: she wants to more closely examine “what exactly [the tadpoles] are defending themselves from” when only other tadpoles are present. It’s possible that they’re defending themselves against cannibalism, but Bókony has another idea. She thinks that the poison could “provide a sort of immune defense against contagious diseases they could catch from [fellow tadpoles], especially when crowded.” This possibility is what she and her team plan to study.

“The test of an adventure is that when you’re in the middle of it, you say to yourself, ‘Oh, now I’ve got myself into an awful mess; I wish I were sitting quietly at home.’ And the sign that something’s wrong with you is when you sit quietly at home wishing you were out having lots of adventure.” These words, said by one of the play’s supporting characters, Barnaby Tucker, define the theme of Thornton Wilder’s The Matchmaker.
The story follows several characters along their misfortunes and successes in finding love in New York. There’s the grumpy rich man and widower, Horace Vandergelder, portrayed by senior William Brosnahan, who plans to remarry. His niece, Ermengarde, portrayed by senior Diyar Eyuboglu, wants to marry an artist named Ambrose Kemper, portrayed by junior Will Harrison, despite Mr. Vandergelder’s disapproval of him. Mr. Vandergelder’s two employees, Cornelius Hackl (senior Kevin William Paul) and Barnaby Tucker (junior Scott Kennedy) desire for adventure and decide to leave their store in Yonkers for a day to travel to New York City. Similarly, Irene Malloy (senior Kate Margalite) and Minnie Fay (senior Jada Mayo), two milliners in the city, want to do more than just sit in their store all day and take advantage of the opportunity for adventure when they meet Cornelius and Barnaby. In the middle of all these events is Dolly Gallagher Levi, portrayed by senior Chantelle Guido, who does her best to get into every-one’s business and essentially plays matchmaker for all the characters.
The play, first run on Broadway in 1955, introduced audiences to the beloved character of Dolly Levi, and was the inspiration for one of Broadway’s most popular musicals, Hello, Dolly! From Oct. 5 to Oct. 14, the Carnegie Mellon School of Drama is putting on their own production of the show. The Matchmaker is a part of the school’s Subscription Series, one of three series that take place during show season, which produces shows specifically directed and choreographed by professionals. Carnegie Mellon’s production of The Matchmaker was directed by a professor at the School of Drama, Anthony McKay, who has been credited in many plays produced around Pittsburgh.
I was able to watch a matinee showing of The Matchmaker with a friend. When we walked into the Philip Chosky Theater, the first thing I noticed was elderly viewers made up a good number of the audience; I assumed that they were from the local neighborhoods or were relatives of the cast. It was apparent that many of them regularly attended the shows run by the School of Drama, and listening to several talk about some of the previous performances, made me even more excited to watch this one. The Matchmaker was the first show I’ve seen from the School of Drama. Seeing the beautiful set design, costumes, and experiencing the school’s show atmosphere for the first time, was amazing; it was as if I were watching a show on Broadway.
I was fascinated by the presence of the entire cast on stage. Each actor was incredibly talented and portrayed their character very well. Guido’s performance as Dolly Levi was especially commend-able. What I found most interesting was that in the story, Dolly appeared to be the only character who knew how to navigate through the unpredictable and chaotic events of life, and was very aware of her surroundings. Her meddling into the love lives of others made it seem that Dolly knew the best from the rest. However, few moments in the play did reveal Dolly’s more vulnerable side, specifically when she talked about her husband who had passed away. Guido portrayed the complexity of Dolly Levi’s character in a way that helped make the entire moral of the story complete.
The Matchmaker was focused on the benefits of seeking out adventure in life. By watching the characters deal with their particular situations, the audience was able to learn more about how often and when risks should be taken. We were also reminded that knowing what can help and harm us in life is important in weighing the costs and benefits of risks. Dolly presented this idea when she talked about money, “the difference between a little money and no money at all is enormous, and can shatter the world; and the difference between a little money and an enormous amount of money is very slight, and that, also, can shatter the world.” The wisdom and influence that Dolly had on both the characters and audience is what made Thornton Wilder’s story unique. 
Throughout the play, many of the other characters shared their own reflections on the events that were happening around them, and I felt it was because of Dolly’s effect on them. Cornelius Hackl and Barnaby Tucker had clearly matured by the end of the play. Mr. Vandergelder had a change of heart because of Dolly. Although the character of Dolly Levi was not the star of the show, her influence did play a significant role in the story of The Matchmaker.There was a lot to take away from this show, and it was because of how the very talented ensemble told the story. If you have time, be sure to watch The Matchmaker for a very worthwhile experience.

It’s not often that you attend a lecture where the speaker purposely revels in the “self-sabotage” of getting sidetracked. It is difficult to tell a story without boundaries, but somehow Elysia Crampton, who spoke at Carnegie Mellon’s Studio for Creative Inquiry last Friday, was able to tell a story while also challenging the idea of what a story should be. Crampton is a critically acclaimed electronic artist whose work spans themes of Latinx culture, Queerness, and Andean experience. Crampton’s work sits at the intersection of multiple communities and perspectives but is unified through her research and understanding of native perceptions and personal experiences as someone of Aymara heritage. Though dense and difficult to summarize, Crampton’s lecture approached the concept of abolition from a native, Andean perspective.
Crampton defined abolition as, “...not just the end of all forms of bondage, but all forms of external or internal colonialism and imperialism.” The lecture was centered on the analysis of images from “El primer nueva corónica y buen gobierno” or “The First New Chronicle and Good Government,” a manuscript from the 17th Century that details the history of the Andes from native empires to the Spanish conquest. The manuscript’s depictions of native life and the reality of Spanish rule provide a striking insight into how Andean cultures viewed themselves and the world. Crampton specifically highlighted aspects of native language and textural understanding shown within the manuscript’s illustrations.
From an Andean perspective, time does not flow in the linear progression adopted by Western schools of thought. The past is not a dormant stage behind us, but a battleground to be actively engaged with and challenged. In fact, in Aymara, the past is seen as something ahead while the future is perceived as something behind.
Another unique characteristic of the Andean experience is the “textural language” of native peoples who wore their culture and history in a “language of fabric.” From distinctive clothing worn by different members of native societies to the Incan Quipus used as a method of record keeping, the Andean culture was built on a distinctive textile understanding and awareness.
Other themes included dual-gendered spaces and queer identity in native communities, internalized imperialism, communal memory, and the persistence of native symbolism and thought through the rise and fall of various empires.
Crampton acknowledged that her analysis and the manuscript itself were full of contradictions that highlight the paradoxes of our modern world. We live in a world where we can critique society while still existing within and benefitting from it, and we can discuss a language that superimposes space and time, and uses the same word for “an instant” and “forever” in a language that only functions in a linear progression.
This world of contradictions, or “world in reverse”, informs the way Crampton views the past and the potential for the future. The final image of the lecture was entitled “God the Father” and depicted a male deity in the foreground holding the sun and moon in his hands, while the Andes Mountains diminished in the background. At first glance, it seems to tell the story of the rise of Christianity and the fall of native religions, or the rise of colonialism and fall of indigenous peoples. But if you approach the depiction with an Andean understanding of time, what’s in the background is the future, and what’s in the foreground becomes the past.
Along with images, Crampton also shared a video clip of Neil Degrasse Tyson explaining the belief that contemplating the universe is a privilege held only by people who do not need to worry about their day-to-day survival. Crampton disagreed, positing that Andean understanding is not a regression of thought and that contemplating a cosmic sense of the universe is not a privileged position held only by “more civilized” people further along the linear progression. Consider another illustration that depicts the native “astrologer poet” sowing seeds and contemplating the sky. The native holds knowledge of the earth as space both below and within, and a knowledge of the sun and the moon as they relate to his crops and his sense of self-mastery. He holds an understanding of a world without discrete taxonomies, a world beyond a settler’s perspective.
Crampton concluded by addressing the fact we are often taught to engage with the world in ways that do not align with our experience or with constructs that do not even exist. There is a limit to understanding the world in certain ways, so maybe it’s time we considered different ways of viewing and understanding our world so that we can renegotiate our future and our past.

Talking to acclaimed singer, songwriter, and musician Christian Lopez felt a lot like talking to a Carnegie Mellon student. He’s incredibly driven and incredibly busy. Only 22 years old, Christian Lopez released his second album Red Arrow on Sept. 22, kicked off a tour last Friday, and already has plans  for  his  next  project  in  the  works.  A high achiever, Lopez is driven by a genuine passion for sharing music and telling stories. That passion is made abundantly clear on Red  Arrow, a collection of genre-defying songs that deliver stories of youth, love, and sacrifice with honesty and heart. Both on the album and in conversation, Christian Lopez exhibits a self-awareness, intelligence, and humor that come from having a deep under-standing of what it takes to make a dream work. Even feeling the pressure and stress of having just released an album, Lopez had nothing but positivity and excitement to share about being able to do what he loves. And at a school where “My Heart is in the Work” is our motto, I think Christian would fit right in.
In terms of your identity as a musician, what are your thoughts on being labeled one genre vs. another? 
That’s the big question or a lot of artists nowadays and it’s very topi-cal for me right now in my life. I’m really feel-ing that [pressure] because I just put out a record that has a pretty large variety of differ-ent styles on it and it’s tough to find a home for it in the business world. But in the listeners’ world, it comes down to the question, “Is it good music?” People ask themselves, “What is good?” and “What is real?”, and that’s why I try to aspire to be an honest musician. Let the people find a home for me. I don’t go into this process searching for a genre home, I like to let the people place the music where they find it fits best. And at the end of the day, wherever that is, I’m cool with it. It’s a beautiful thing in today’s world, being able to make music without labels and have success as an artist because you don’t feel so confined.
Is there a way your process tends to flow? Do you tend to move from a melody to lyrics, or are you struck by lyrics first?
Sometimes there’s a line that I’ll want to work around, but most of the time I have to chase after a song. It starts with something instrumental first, a progression, a riff, or something like that. From there I find the melody and then I’ll let whatever mood that puts me in guide me to where I want to take a piece lyrically.
Was working on this album different for you than working on your past projects?
Absolutely, because on this record I had some co-writers. On my projects before, I’ve written everything solo. So on this record, I went with some different writing techniques than the ones I’ve used the last couple of years. Not necessarily because I was search-ing for them, but because I was sitting down with other people and it just sort of happened.  I  definitely  tried  to  change  things up on this record; it’s good for the mind and good for the songs when I try to find some-thing different.
Are there certain aspects of people or their work that draw you to work with them?
For me, I’d say there are three different angles to approaching collaboration. I work with a publisher in Nashville and their job is to set me up with other writers who I don’t know. They knew this record was in the works so they wanted to get me working with some writers whose work is out of my comfort zone. There are also writers who I’m a huge fan of who I reach out to and sit down with. And then, of course, there are friends. I have friends that I’ve made along the way and we just end up sitting down and making music. Once you’re immersed in the world of all this writing, it’s easy to collaborate. It’s easy to spend a couple hours sitting on a couch with a guitar and just see what comes out of it.
On this album, would you say all the songs are part of a larger narrative or is does each song tell a stand-alone story?
Going into this record, it needed to be a narrative. I like when records have a flow, not only musically, but also emotionally. For me, this record is the story of a restless young man throwing himself into any situation, whether it be life, love, or the pursuit of a dream. It’s rugged and honest and I wanted to showcase the feeling of being young and not giving a damn about what’s going to happen next. The narrative is about being in the moment, especially with romance, because that’s some of the stuff I’ve lived through. I mean, I’m only 22, so I haven’t had a ton of life experience, but what I have had I tried to wrap up into this record and put it out into the world without holding back.
When you’re writing are there any feelings or ideas that keep pulling you back in?
I’d say it’s a mixture of the romantic side of things and the sacrifice that comes with the road. It’s really tough to be gone constantly and maintain relationships, not just romantic relationships, but family relationships, friend-ships, everything. That is probably the truest thing I have experienced and what I feel I’ve been writing about the most. Sometimes, I really have to try to snap myself out of it and write something a little more on the surface instead of being this deep, mopey son of a gun. When it comes to sad songs, I literally have to force myself to stop writing them. I could write sad songs all day long, so it’s something I have to keep an eye on. But at the same time, I have to let it out. When I made this record I brought fifty songs to the table and out of those we had to pick eleven. So at the end of the day, I write what flows and then take it from there.
Do you have any song or lyric that you find particularly meaningful?
On this record, it’s probably, the song “All the Time.” The lyrics on that song really hit home for where I am in my life right now. That’s why I put it dead center on the record because it’s at the turning point. The beginning [of the re-cord] is a kind of careless youthful kid taking a swing at everything life wise, career-wise, love-wise. Then “All the Time” is about understanding the trade-off that comes with going for a dream like this and also having relationships. So that song speaks strongly to where I am in a really honest way.
You’ve touched on the fact that you’re pretty young to be going through everything that comes with being a musician. Do you have any reflections on being a part of the music industry at such a young age?
This is interesting to talk about at this time because right now I’m in the first week of a new record, so I’ve got everyone analyzing everything and giving me feedback constantly. And it’s really stressful. I feel like I’ve been through the wringer and that I’ve handled a lot more stress than I should have. I’m a young man and I feel like I’ve lived a whole sequence of tough, stressful, music business s***. But I’m  a  firm  believer  in  the  idea  that  if  you want something bad enough, you have to push through the hard and stressful times because, at the end of the day, it comes down to the music. And you have to be will-ing to defend your music, to support your music, and to present it constantly. And I’m learning that day-by-day because it doesn’t get any easier, it only gets harder as you go. You can’t rely on other people and you can’t put your faith in other people. You have to believe in yourself, belief in the music, and sometimes you have to be willing to walk away from things or make compromises. The funny thing is, the further I get, the fewer compromises I want to make.
What can people expect from you on tour and in the future?
The show is constantly evolving. I play my songs and the new re-cord, but at the end of the day, we put on a Rock-and-Roll show. And what I’m really in the mood for next is a live album. I’d love to see some sort of live album come out after this tour before the next studio record, but we’ll see. This is a big time of change for me, it’s my second record working with the same vehicle I’ve been in since I was 17 and came to Nashville. So, I’m ready for change and looking forward to what’s about to come. The thing I love most is being on stage and performing my songs, and that’s what I want to focus on. I’d love performance to be a staple of what I am as an artist, not just the record, but also the experience of my live shows.
If you weren’t already a huge fan of Christian, he ended our conversation by calling Pittsburgh, “...one of his favorite cities” and saying he was excited to be back in town on this tour. So be sure to listen to the album Red Arrow (especially the song “1972”, it’s my favorite) and catch Christian Lopez in Pittsburgh this Wednesday (10/11) at the Hard Rock Café.

The newest iteration of Star Trek aired two weeks ago on CBS. To fans of the franchise, it is a long-awaited modern take on the universe and stories that we love. The last TV iteration of Star Trek, Star Trek: Enterprise ended in 2005 and was not nearly as well received as previous shows such as the Star Trek: The Next Generation or Star Trek: Voyager. To me and other fans, Discovery feels like a breath of fresh air in the Trek universe, even more than the reboot movie series that began in 2009.
For those unfamiliar with the franchise, Star Trek has had five previous iterations on TV:
Star Trek (with Bill Shatner as Capt. Kirk and Leonard Nimoy as Spock), 1966 - 1969
Star Trek: The  Next  Generation (with Patrick Stewart as Capt. Picard), 1987 - 1994
Star Trek: Deep Space 9 (with Avery Brooks as Capt. Benjamin Sisko), 1993 - 1999
Star Trek: Voyager (with Kate Mulgrew as Capt. Janeway), 1995 - 2001
Star Trek:  Enterprise (with Scott Bakula as Capt. Archer), 2001 - 2005
These Star Trek shows tell the stories of distinct Starfleet crews on distinct vessels in Earth’s future, when it is the center of a peaceful intergalactic alliance known as the United Federation of Planets. The Federation stands for peace, and its foremost policies are that it does not interfere in cultures that are incapable of interstellar travel, and that it never initiates conflict. Star Trek, like the Federation, stands for a future in which humanity has moved beyond aggressive conflict and has learned to coexist and collaborate with hundreds of other alien species. It paints a beautifully optimistic picture of the future and gives us something to aspire to.
Discovery breaks the norms of Star Trek shows in some ways. It follows the story of Michael Burnham, a female Starfleet First Officer serving on the USS Shenzhou. It is the first Star Trek series to center around a first officer rather than a captain, and the first to openly display the protagonist’s character flaws as an integral part of their character from the outset. It is also the first show to be set immediately during wartime.
In previous shows, Captains have tended to be poster children — exemplary officers whose flaws are few and rarely revealed. Wars have played significant parts in Star Trek series, but have always developed later in the plot rather than earlier. It is clear from the first three episodes of Discovery that it does not intend to follow the bandwagon of rosy-cheeked optimism with perfect captains and peaceful times. It is a more direct, in-your-face realist’s view of life in a Federation at war.
That said, Discovery still manages to hold on to some of the optimism and wonder that made Star Trek so beloved and that continue to make it relevant. It actively comments on the events and society today and encourages change for the better. Historically, Star Trek has made an effort to include a diverse cast that not only represent humanity, but that comments on ongoing conflict. The original series featured Japanese, Russian, and black characters in the midst of the cold war and the civil rights movement, and even aired TV’s first interracial kiss. Discovery is the second Star Trek show after Voyager to feature a woman in the leading role, and the second after Deep Space 9 to feature a black protagonist. It features an asian captain, a supporting character with special needs, and hopefully more as the show develops. Although it is too early to tell if Discovery will grow to be as loved as older Star Trek, it shows great potential as something that will preserve the spirit of Star Trek, but infuse a fresh sense of realism and vigor that past shows did not always have.
Star Trek:  Discovery airs weekly on Sunday at 8:30 p.m. on CBS. It is available to stream on CBS All Access and on Netflix (for users outside the U.S.)

** I love concerts.**
That’s how Twenty One Pilots frontman Tyler Joseph starts off his message to his fans on Nov. 15, 2015, two days after three gunmen opened fire on an Eagles of Death Metal concert at Le Bataclan in Paris. The event remains the deadliest concert shooting of all time, leaving over 130 people dead and over 400 injured. In his message, Joseph cancels the remaining three dates of the band’s European tour. The band had played a show at Le Bataclan the day before the shooting.
I love concerts.
When I first heard of the Paris attacks, I was at a formal dance at my high school with a sick feeling in my stomach. Demi Lovato once said that “Music is a place to find refuge, not fear.” I believe that all kinds of entertainment as forms of escape are surprisingly important to our well-being, but music is one of the areas that I think captures that well. Music builds you up again and again, and can shape your mood and amplify your emotions in just four minutes. My parents repeatedly call me out because I’d disappear into the same old songs I’d listen to over and over again to enter into my own little world and escape from the harsh reality, raising the volume to try and tune out my troubles.
I love concerts.
Concerts are a living embodiment of the very art that pushes us to do more. We see our inspirations, our motivators, in the flesh. We see that the pocket that we tuck ourselves into in our minds whenever we need that break from the real world actually exists. I woke up on the morning of Oct. 2 to the aftermath of a country music festival shooting where 50 people were killed and over 200 were injured. I woke up irrational, distressed, and heartbroken. I immediately called my mom and we spent 15 minutes crying over the phone. I even texted my best friend from home, whom I was 99 percent sure was nowhere near Las Vegas, to make sure she was okay, because she loves country music.
I woke up two days later to find that the numbers had risen to 59 and over 500. According to news outlets, concerts were now “soft targets.”
I love concerts.
In his message, Tyler Joseph says that “I truly hope that concerts don’t change after this. Let’s not let that happen.” Two years later, I’m starting to realize that actually might happen. I’m scared of comprehending that concerts might now occupy that real world that I, and a lot of other people, keep trying to avoid. On the morning of October 2, I started to realize that we live in a world where a heavy metal concert is a possible site for a terrorist attack. We live in a world where a suicide bomber can walk into the concert of one of pop’s big-gest stars without hassle. We live in a world where someone can walk into a venue and shoot down one of YouTube’s most talented individuals while she’s meeting her fans. We live in a world where one man can drastically change the culture of country music by raining down bullets on a festival from the safety of his hotel room.
I love concerts.
Over the summer, I won two tickets to a free concert at Stage AE of my choice, and I had chosen to attend the Pierce the Veil concert last Thursday. When my friend canceled on me last minute and I scrambled to find someone else, I started to realize that I didn’t want to go. That sick feeling in my stomach from two years ago returned, something I never realized could happen again.
Instead, I went out to dinner with a friend. We both talked a lot about music. Our music tastes are pretty different but still very similar, and we found a connection in not just our passion for some pop music and the industry but also on how much music has shaped our lives. Music has influenced both of us in what we wanted to do, what we did, and what we thought about. Music encourages us to find the hidden, deeper meanings in the world around us.
I love concerts.
Music ignites emotions. In music, we find comfort and joy. In music, we find happiness and nostalgia. But in music, we also find sadness. We find anger. We find loss, grief, and regret.
In a broader sense, we find memories. And those memories can be associated with any of those emotions I’ve just listed and more. Last week, music was paired with the deadliest mass shooting in modern U.S. history and, for many people, with the death of loved ones. Music is catchy; when music latches to something, it doesn’t go away — in every sense. Those memories of loss, pain, and grief will stick with some songs forever.
But from that loss, pain, and grief, we find determination. We find some hid-den motivation and courage we’d never thought was possible. We find some essential part of us that music contributes, something that we wouldn’t expect it to.
We find community and kinship. We find a place to heal. We find a place to grow stronger — together. In his message, Tyler Joseph also said, “Peace will win and fear will lose.” Music gives us a place to formulate that battle plan against fear. Concerts are the setting to enact that plan into action.
I love going to concerts. I love seeing a band that I absolutely love while I lose my voice singing the words to every song. I love seeing an artist that I’m not too familiar with alongside my close friends. I love seeing my friends perform around campus, and am awed by their immense passion for what they study every single time I talk to them. Concerts should be a celebration of talent and a living embodiment of a refuge — a real-life version of escapism — and I refuse to let that argument be broken down and disproven by the world around me.
I am not going to forget Las Vegas. And I know that something with concerts is going to change. But I am going to take this pain and fight fear. I am going to take this sadness and spread love and peace with it, and I encourage others to do the same.
I love concerts.

**Hey Ruth,
So, we’re getting into October and all of a sudden all of my classes have midterms. All of them. And for some reason my professors keep scheduling them all right next to each other, which is really annoying. As a result, I’ve become trapped in this awful cycle of last minute, desperate studying for each exam. I take one, do less well than I probably needed, and only have 24 hours to prepare for the next! I’m running out of energy and I don’t have any time left to hang out with people or relax. I barely have time to get food! How am I supposed to take care of myself when I’m facing an endless line of midterms?
Please help,
Straight Outta Sleep**
Dear SOS,
It’s basically a law of nature that every exam will be surrounded by other exams. All of us have experienced the midterm pileup, be it through exams or projects, and if there’s sure-fire way of getting through it and coming out better than you went in, well, I don’t really know it. There are, however, a couple of things that can help you face an exam pileup with as little fear as possible.
First, start early. I know this isn’t useful advice now, in the beginning of midterm season, but it still stands. Unless you are one of a select few, the best way to study for an exam is to do so in small pieces spaced out through a reasonably long period of time.
Don’t just study the material — study for the exam. It’s a nice thought that you’ll just learn the material so thoroughly that you’ll be able to understand any question thrown at you, but if you can actually do that you are light years ahead of me. Instead, make sure you’re doing practice problems (or short answers, or essays, or what have you) that are as close to what will be on the exam as possible. If your professor is good, this usually means you can redo old homework problems or practice questions from the textbook.
Finally — please don’t forget to take breaks.  If you, like me, have that niggling voice in the back of your head saying you should be studying anytime you do anything else, remember that taking breaks is actually good for your retention. Our brains remember things best when we’re repeatedly reminded of them — but not all at once. We need time in between to process and store our memories. That’s why everyone recommends a full night’s sleep before a big exam. Not because you might fall asleep while taking it (although that is also not ideal), but because we remember things better after we’ve slept on them.
But not all breaks have to involve sleeping to be worthwhile. Studying isn’t actually about quantity, it’s about quality. Two hours of focused studying followed by a break is much better than an hour of actual work spread over three because you burned out. You have to take care of your mental health if you expect your brain to perform well.
Now, this is not to say that ignoring all the work you need to do under the pretext of mental health is a good idea. Sometimes self-care is taking a YouTube break, and sometimes self-care is putting in the work so you won’t fail your classes. Most of the time, it’s a mix of both. (If you are actually at the point where your mental health is interfering with academics, please talk to your professors and reach out to CaPS. This is not something you have to suffer through alone.)
Your academic performance is not actually a measure of how valuable you are as a human being, but that doesn’t mean we’d all be happy failing every exam. It’s admirable that you want to do well and that you’re willing to put in the work to get there.
Good luck,
Ruth

After a hard week at Carnegie Mellon, which, let’s be honest, is all of them, all you need is the right night out with friends. Both of us had particularly rough weeks, so we were looking to get tipsy and complain a bit about the past seven days. With that in mind, Element was maybe not the best choice for us. As one of Pittsburgh’s few LGBTQ bars, Element is a lively, fun place. If your favorite way to blow off steam is to get turnt and dance, Element would be a good place to go, but if you need a more chill atmosphere to drunkenly rant about school, it’s probably not your best bet.
The location: Element is on Ellsworth Street in Shadyside, centrally located in terms of food. Right across the street is the Tipsy Cow, and the restaurants of Walnut Street are not far off either. In terms of transportation from campus, the 71B or D bus is probably your best bet. The bus will take you down Fifth Avenue into Shadyside, but it’s still a bit of a trek from the bus stop, so I wouldn’t recommend making the trip on foot unless you’re already in Shadyside.
The drinks: The drinks were fine but nothing to write home about. Element has a nicely stocked bar to make all the solidly mediocre cocktails your heart desires. The whiskey sour was somehow both watered down and very strong while the vodka soda was much more vodka than soda. The main upside to the drinks was that they were very cheap at $4.50 a cocktail. This bar seemed like a good place to go if you’re looking to get drunk for cheap before dancing with friends, and, unlike the other places we’ve been to so far this semester, Element did not have a food menu.
The vibe: There must have been some sort of special event going on that we didn’t know about before planning to go, because, other than the two of us and two other girls at the other end of the bar, the entire rest of Element’s patronage on that night was male, but supposedly there is normally more of a gender balance. Even on a Thursday, Element gave off a high-energy vibe with upbeat pop music blasting and youthful customers laughing and drinking with their friends. One warning: because of the loud music, Element is not a good place for conversation. When I went up to the bar to order my drink, I asked the bartender for advice on what to get, and I had no idea what he was saying, so I eventually just went with it. I think he said he was going to make me a vodka soda, but I wouldn’t outrule the possibility that I just totally couldn’t hear him.
Lit or Nah: I’d say that Element was a pretty lit bar — the atmosphere was very young and energetic, probably even more so on weekend nights, and the drinks were designed to get you drunk without burning a hole in your wallet. However, I’d also say that we were not feeling up for lit.

On Sept. 19, the sandy ground below the Mexico City area violently shook with a magnitude 7.1 earthquake that struck on the 32nd anniversary of the 1985 magnitude 8.0 Mexico City earthquake. Last month’s earthquake killed nearly 400 people, injured over 6,000, and caused major structural damage in Mexico City and surrounding areas, including over forty building collapses.
In the frantic search and rescue operation that followed in the city, Carnegie Mellon researchers deployed a “Snakebot” — a robot that is built to “slither” in a flexible manner similar to that of a real snake — at a collapsed apartment building in hopes that it could mitigate the scale of the tragedy there and be a prototype for similar future robots that can assist in urban search-and-rescue.
Howie Choset, a robotics professor who has been a leader in developing snakebots, explained in an interview with The Tartan that the conception for the Snakebot first came from Joel Burdick, advisor to Choset, and Burdick’s graduate student Greg Chirikjian. Since the shape and size of the robot make it ideal for getting into tight spaces, urban search-and-rescue has long been considered a potential application for snakebots.
The project was funded by the National Center for Defense Robotics, the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, and the National Science Foundation.
The robot deployed in Mexico City was two inches in diameter and 37 inches long, and the body was connected to a control and power cable. It had 16 modules on its body connected by joints that allowed it to move in a variety of configurations — much like a snake’s natural movement — as well as take on positions that utilize its mechanical characteristics, such as rolling over. The head of the robot contained lights and a video camera.
Although the particular robot deployed in Mexico City did not find any survivors, Matt Travers, systems scientist in the university’s Robotics Institute and co-director of the Biorobotics Lab that developed the Snakebot, nevertheless gave the robot a positive evaluation. “[T]he Mexican Red Cross workers with us said they would like to have a similar tool in the future,” said Travers in a university press release.
The Mexico City deployment was also the first time that it had been tested in a real-world disaster zone. Before, the only tests were done in simulated disaster settings.
The project and deployment have already attracted high-level attention within the university. “What happened in Mexico City... I believe, is just the beginning of what will someday be a heroic story for robots. I’m particularly impressed by the energy, enterprise, and bravery displayed by [the Carnegie Mellon team that traveled to Mexico] in getting our robot into some very dangerous places,” said Andrew Moore, dean of the School of Computer Science at Carnegie Mellon, in the press release.
Choset explained in the university press release that the deployment helped the researchers identify the capabilities of the robot and areas that would require additional research to make the robot a more useful search-and-rescue assistant, in addition to underscoring the need for further funding to develop newer and better robots. He pointed out that the deployed robot is over a decade old and that it “is on its last legs, even though it doesn’t have any.” Travers added that capabilities to incorporate into the robot in the future should include sensors to detect gas leaks in the rubble and microphones and speakers to help in finding and rescuing survivors trapped under collapsed buildings.
In the interview with The Tartan, Choset expressed hope that researchers will soon develop “[m]ore modular robots to make all sorts of robot shapes.”
Besides post-disaster search-and-rescue operations, other applications of the robot could include surveillance and inspection of industrial complexes such as nuclear power plants and archaeological exploration.

The Business Affairs (BA) committee of Student Senate is looking to improve the transportation options that are available to Carnegie Mellon students this semester. Student Senate currently helps fund the Shuttle System that helps get students living off campus to class and back in a convenient, safe, and reliable manner, and is currently focusing its efforts on increasing its usage. It is currently working with the Communications Committee to provide students with easy-to-understand flyers on the lines and stops that are available to them as a way to make this transportation option more accessible to the student body.
Once it can facilitate heavier student usage of the Shuttle System, Business Affairs hopes to increase its scope in terms of the number of stops, frequency, and the number of buses in the future to make this transportation option even more convenient for students.
To keep students safe, Business Affairs is also working to ensure more students are aware of and understand how to use the Escort System as a way to get to on and off-campus residences at night. This is a safer alternative to walking home and can help reduce the risk of robbery and assault. It is currently collaborating with the Communications and Campus Life Committees to create flyers as a convenient resource for students to refer to for information on procedures, zones, and times relating to Escort System use.
Business Affairs has also been working with the Parking and Transportation Services and the Pittsburgh Parking Authority to help fix unclear signs on handicapped parking spaces on Frew and Tech Streets behind Hunt Library and Baker Hall. Carnegie Mellon students have been regularly issued citations on these streets in the past despite the handicapped spaces not being properly marked according to the city code, and the committee is working with Carnegie Mellon and Pittsburgh authorities to resolve this problem.
This is not the first time Business Affairs has advocated to Parking and Transportation Services on the students’ behalf. Last semester, the committee brought a representative to our General Body Meeting to speak on proposed fees on night and weekend parking. Due to Senate’s concerns on the issue in terms of safety and financial strain on students, night and weekend parking was kept free for members of the campus community.
By increasing the scope of the Shuttle System, addressing sign issues in Pittsburgh, as well as expanding awareness and use of the Escort System, Business Affairs is improving the student experience by making transportation more convenient, safe, and reliable to all members of campus.
To learn more or to get involved in these initiatives, contact Richard Hoffberg at business-affairs@cmusenate.org or attend Business Affairs' meetings, which are open to the public from 5:30 to6:30 p.m. on Wednesdays in Cohon Center 329.

As of Sept. 1, the fourth floor of Hunt library began a “no food policy,” allowing only cold beverages to be consumed on the floor’s physical spaces. This is part of Carnegie Mellon University  Libraries’ method of enforcing new procedures in order to improve the student and staff experience in library spaces.
The University Libraries website states that part of the reason for this immediate change to the fourth floor’s policy was because this floor houses the Fine and Rare books, which includes documents, artifacts, and artwork. Food tends to attract more pests and insects on this floor, thereby threatening the physical spaces and community setting. The current food policy also states that food and beverages may be consumed on all other floors of Hunt Library.
More importantly, University Libraries is currently seeking more input regarding other potential changes to their food policy through a community survey. Keith Webster, Dean of University Libraries and Director of Emerging and Integrative Media Initiatives, explains that there have been mixed responses towards Hunt’s fourth-floor food enforcement policy, although many students and staff members recognize the issue of having food in the library and would want some form of change.
In the past year, both Hunt and Sorrells Libraries totaled over one million visitors. Dean Webster, along with library staff, recognize the library is a common destination for many types of people, and they prioritize making any major library changes based on the opinions and discussions enlightened through community input. To achieve this, Carnegie Mellon University students are encouraged to fill out the “Food in the libraries” survey before Oct. 31.
Dean Webster explains that “The goal of the survey is to collect a high-level view of the needs of the community and how to best meet their preferences. We recognize it’s impossible to please everyone, but at least we can give anyone who wants to comment an opportunity to be heard.” Many of the questions in the short survey ask about an individual’s number of visits to the library, the locations and frequency of food consumption in Hunt and Sorrells libraries, how food restrictions might impact an individual’s library visits and experience, and lastly, open responses about Hunt’s current no food policy on the fourth floor.
Dean Webster mentions that since the library is part of a daily routine to a plethora of people who expect it to maintain its high standards, “facilities and policies must continue to evolve to meet the increased demand,” a demand that’s over ten times larger than what the library offered ten years ago. In order to meet such demand, feedback from the survey will probably be used to specifically modify or reinforce certain food policies in the library. Dean Webster and library staff emphasize that any major further changes to the libraries’ policies would take into account such community feedback. Overall, Carnegie Mellon University Libraries staff has been considerate in creating forums and operating based on public input to enhance individuals’ experience in library spaces.

On Oct. 5th, more than a hundred people stood at the edge of Carnegie Mellon University’s campus and faced the handful of Westboro Baptist Church protesters picketing across the street on the Forbes Ave. and Morewood Ave. intersection. The crowd, a mix of Carnegie Mellon students, university professors, Trans Liberation members, and passionate bystanders, shouted in unison “Hey hey, ho ho, homophobia’s got to go!” Despite rain and the regular schedule of classes on a weekday, the group gathered mid-afternoon to demonstrate their intolerance to hate and distasteful worldviews. What was firmly cemented that afternoon was a sense of community and a dedication to promoting acceptance and love.
The Westboro Baptist Church (WBC) is a Baptist church and declared hate group based in Topeka, Kansas. Known for its hate speech against the LGBTQ community, American soldiers, and people with any other religious affiliation, the group has become known for its persistent picketing across the country. According to its website, the church has visited over 1000 cities, protesting at soldiers’ funerals, courthouses, high schools, memorials, and other churches. Its anti-homosexual rhetoric helped develop the church’s infamous role in popular culture.
The WBC’s anticipated presence caused tension and worry within the Carnegie Mellon community leading up to the picketing event. Many discussed methods to prohibit the group from picketing within the campus vicinity. The university stated in a school-wide email that though the WBC “has not been granted permission to use university property under the university’s policy for public demonstrations…protesters may still exercise their first amendment rights on adjacent public sidewalks or streets.” Indeed, with first amendment rights firmly sustaining the legality of their message, temporary bans from protesting are actually what financially drives the group. What is less commonly known about the WBC is that they profit heavily from being controversial.
Aside from each member’s requirement of giving 30 percent of their income to the church, litigation cases reveal that the WBC reaps immense financial benefits from its lawsuits. In 1995, the WBC won more than $100,000 against the Kansas’ Funeral Picketing Act because it was a violation of the First Amendment. In 2007, Shirley Phelps-Roper — the former spokesperson of the WBC — was charged for allowing her son to stand on an American flag. A federal judge found the law unconstitutional and the city of Bellevue paid Phelps-Roper $17,000. Other court cases rewarded the group tens of thousands of dollars in court fees.
This is what concerned the organizers of “Time to Shine,” Carnegie Mellon’s campus-wide counter-demonstrative event that gathered its members in solidarity with the LGBTQ community. Ultimately, the goal was to stand united peacefully and focus on the positive message of outshining hate. Members active in the advocacy community were fully aware of the fragility of such concentrated tension. The University anticipated similar thoughts, including in the last section of their email, “the open exchange and discussion of ideas and a diverse and inclusive community are core values of Carnegie Mellon University. We are committed to fostering an environment that honors both of those foundational principles. As a community, we must stand together against hate, while encouraging the free and civil expression of ideas and perspectives.”
Except for one arrest of an anti-protester, the demonstrations were largely peaceful. Victor Tavarez, lead organizer of “Time to Shine,” was proud of that achievement despite high tensions that day. “Carnegie Mellon University’s community proved that it can come together and defend its community members. ‘Time to Shine’ was more than just a response to a visiting hate group. It was about proving that when the time came, students, faculty, staff, alumni, and members of the Pittsburgh community can join together for each other.”
The message was clear and well-vocalized, even through the rain, heavy traffic, student flow, and numerous police forces. Tavarez, who managed the occasion and kept himself centered throughout the entire event, embodied the spirit of that day. “I have to admit, things didn’t all go as planned. I’m glad it didn’t. The community took the initiative today. We remained peaceful. We stood in solidarity. We made sure to outshine hate.”

With data science as one of the fastest growing fields in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM), companies are on the hunt for talented students around the world who can solve complex social problems creatively. Citadel, a leading hedge fund, and Citadel Securities, a global market maker, are in the middle of a battle for top tech talent. To expand their search for the best and the brightest, Citadel and Citadel Securities hosted a datathon in partnership with Correlation One, a talent solutions technology company, in September at Carnegie Mellon which had over 100 students compete and almost 600 apply to participate. In addition to holding a datathon at Carnegie Mellon, the firms also host them at top universities in the U.S., U.K., and Ireland throughout the year.
The Citadel and Citadel Securities Datathon is structured so each datathon takes place over a single day. Participants work in teams to analyze a dataset containing a structured problem and are asked to submit a written report detailing their findings. Judges then review the submissions and announce the winners, with winning teams presenting their ideas to an audience. The stakes are high — participants compete for a $25,000 cash prize and the chance to advance to the final competition, “The Data Open Championship,” which will take place in New York later this year and has a $100,000 grand prize. Participants also have the opportunity to interview for careers with Citadel and Citadel Securities, including for quantitative research, data science, software engineering, trading, and investment roles.
This year’s data set focused on gene expression data from different population samples of healthy individuals and individuals suffering from cancer.
“We wanted to build classification models to predict if the gene expression of an individual suggests they are suffering from cancer,” said Chirag Nagpal, a member of the winning team, and a Masters student at Carnegie Mellon’s Language Technology Institute.
The datathon attracted students of all disciplines, from statistics and medical students to computer science and physics students, bringing them together to focus on a common area of interest.
“The datathon gave me an opportunity to collaborate with students from departments other than my own, which was a positive experience and helped me meet new people,” said Nagpal.
The purpose of the datathon is centered on showing students that there is a range of opportunities for tech talent in sectors which students looking for jobs in the tech field would not consider, such as in the finance arena.
“We are always looking for new ways to connect with talented people who share our passion for solving challenging problems. The datathons are helping us identify and connect with talented undergraduate and graduate students across STEM disciplines in way that also helps us show them that Citadel and Citadel Securities can provide the challenging and rewarding career opportunities that they are looking for,” said Candice Berger, Talent Strategist and Co-Head of Campus Recruiting for Citadel and Citadel Securities.
Citadel has had a significant presence on Carnegie Mellon’s campus through the Citadel Teaching Commons, a lab and study space featuring high-performance clusters directed towards encouraging teamwork and collaboration, located in CMU’s School of Computer Science. Citadel provided funding for the construction of the Teaching Commons, which was completed in 2015.
According to a university press release, Carnegie Mellon’s Statistics and Data Science Department has had much success in recruiting and training the next generation of data scientists. In the past six years, the number of students majoring in statistics as well as interdisciplinary degrees in areas such as economics, machine learning, and neuroscience has more than tripled, thus increasing student interest in datathons, where students can apply their knowledge to real-world problems and get experience on how to work with large data sets and open-ended problems.
“Datathons challenge students to glean insights from complex data sets and identify how those insights can be used to solve meaningful problems,” said Berger. “The submissions that we receive at the end of each competition are always very different, which reflects the different ways in which participants approach and analyze the data set.”
Participants find it refreshing to be able to define their own problem and come up with a solution, as it fosters creative thinking and problem-solving.
“The best part was that the data provided to us was open domain and publicly available. We were free to define our own interesting problem around the data, which I personally feel is harder and requires more creative and out-of-the-box thinking as compared to solving a well-defined task,” said Nagpal.
With such opportunity to engage with people from different backgrounds and interests, participants leave with a host of new skills and knowledge.
“I learned how to collaborate with new people, how to solve problems in a time constraint scenario, and how to deal with data science challenges in microbiology,” said Nagpal.
Datathons such as the one hosted by Citadel have had a clear impact on Carnegie Mellon students, as seen through the creation of the Carnegie Mellon Data Science Club, whose purpose is to serve as a platform for students to pursue their interests in data science in a setting that is both collaborative and competitive.
With datathons taking place around the world and throughout the year, companies will have more opportunities to connect with passionate and talented students who are driven to discover innovative solutions to real-world issues.

On the night of Tuesday, Sept. 19, the outer limits of a Category 5 hurricane larger in size than the land it would soon devastate, swept over Puerto Rico. In the following days, during a hurricane season more ferocious than we’ve seen in decades, Hurricane Maria washed over Puerto Rico for a period of over 24 hours, leaving destruction and chaos in its wake. Ricardo Rosselló, Governor of Puerto Rico, called Hurricane Maria the “worst hurricane in [the] modern history [of] Puerto Rico.” 
The storm went far outside of the bounds of a “natural disaster”, and is now being regarded as a “catastrophic event,” wiping out entire infrastructure systems and destroying “most, if not all of the built environment.” Insurance companies on the ground in Puerto Rico estimate a total infrastructure recovery cost of over $85 billion. Within hours following the start of the storm, 900,000 people were displaced from their homes and 4,400 were living in shelters while persisting winds continued to devastate the country for over 30 hours. Currently, only 5.4 percent of citizens on the island have electricity, more than 3 million are without clean drinking water, and the death toll has more than doubled in the past several days, climbing from 16 people to 34.
To make matters worse, first responders in Puerto Rico were impacted in an unprecedented manner, being forced to abandon their jobs as public servants to take care of their own homes and families. This rendered many emergency services unavailable or ineffective. The Federal Government of the United States should have immediately stepped in, not only to assist in the humanitarian efforts to support citizens of Puerto Rico, but also to secure safety for the 3.5 million American citizens living on the island. But as we’ve seen, that wasn’t what happened — not even close.
Donald Trump initially responded to the aftermath of Hurricane Maria the way we all expected — via Twitter. Trump tweeted about Puerto Rico 18 times in 11 hours. They were not the “thoughts and prayers” tweets filled with empty promises and fake sympathy, either. They were defensive and dark, and they painted a picture of a heroic American government doing all they can to help a selfish, ungrateful Puerto Rico — which is false on all counts. 
Trump repeatedly praised his own administration for their “unbelievable” and “incredible” job in aiding Puerto Rico after the storm, while simultaneously berating San Juan Mayor Carmen Yulin Cruz. Trump claimed in a tweet that Cruz has “such poor leadership ability” and that the lack of relief efforts were due to her inability to mobilize her community. This is an ironic statement, considering Trump had, until this point, done little to mobilize the federal government to send relief and aid, while Cruz had been seen wading through post-hurricane waters to rescue citizens of her city.
Trump’s tweets didn’t stop there — nor did his relief efforts begin. He went on to make claims against the “fake news” of CNN and NBC, stating that they’re “going out of their way to disparage our great First Responders [sic].” These statements were largely untrue, with CNN and NBC both highlighting relief efforts and urging support for first responders. He also stated that “they want everything done for them,” suggesting that it wasn’t the government's job to aid in relief efforts. Trump’s choice of wording is very telling. “They” casts a tone of “others”, further evidence that Trump will use any event, even tragedy in the lives of our citizens and neighbors, to create a divide and treat those living in Puerto Rico as second-class citizens.
Trump's tweets weren’t the only thing wrong with his response to the aftermath. He proved time and time again that he has no grasp on the severity of the situation. Or worse, the severity of the situation means so little to him that it doesn’t behoove him to behave in a presidential manner. For example, it took Trump a week to waive the Jones Act, which was effectively preventing foreign aid from making its way to Puerto Rico. After the storm, Trump “issued an emergency declaration and pledged that all federal resources would be directed to help.” Unfortunately, for five days following this statement, Trump and top officials made no contact with Puerto Rico, leaving its citizens with no water, no power, and no answers.
It likely won’t come as a surprise that Trump spent those days in his private golf club, speaking out publically only to discuss his new travel ban, making no real comments on any efforts to help the unfolding crisis situation. He did, however, manage to find time to discuss Kim Jong Un, the NFL, and his failed healthcare bill. The administration's lack of motivation is perfectly captured in a statement from Rep. Darren Soto (D) stating that “[The American Government] invaded small countries faster than we’ve been helping American citizens in Puerto Rico.”
When Trump finally started to address relief efforts, he made claims that efforts to provide water and medical care were “going well,” while first-person accounts confirm that these claims were fabricated. Army Lt. Gen. Jeffrey Buchanan told reporters that “there were not enough people or assets to help Puerto Rico combat what has become a humanitarian crisis.” 
Trump eventually made it to Puerto Rico, less on his own volition and more as a defensive response to outrage and pressure from officials and citizens. Many had hoped that seeing the devastation with his own eyes would prompt Trump to start taking this situation seriously. However, his actions at a small press conference in a church in Puerto Rico made it clear that Trump was taking virtually no aspects of the relief efforts seriously. He tossed paper towel rolls and other supplies into the audience like band members throw t-shirts into a crowd at a concert. 
These immature actions followed shocking statements by Trump, claiming that Hurricane Maria was not a “real catastrophe” like Hurricane Katrina, the storm that made landfall on the Gulf Coast in 2005. He said the people of Puerto Rico should be “very proud” that they only lost 16 lives — although the death toll rose to 34 in the following days — compared to the “literally thousands of people” lost to Katrina. Hurricane Katrina, whose death toll was about 1,800, undoubtably took more lives than Hurricane Maria. However, no human life should be minimized or used merely as a statistic to justify our government’s overwhelmingly poor response to this tragedy. Trump went on to assert that Puerto Rico was throwing America’s budget “a little out of whack,” despite never once complaining about the cost of Hurricane Harvey or Hurricane Irma relief efforts. His entire speech had an overarching tone of victim-blaming and divisiveness, making little mention of any actual goals of relief efforts for the country. 
The Trump administration must acknowledge their responsibility to secure the safety and wellbeing of the people living on the island. The lack of urgency by our government is irresponsible; the people of Puerto Rico deserve the food, water, and medical aid that the American government has promised them. It is callous, irresponsible, and disturbing that Trump has used a tragedy to once again turn to Twitter, play victim, and cry “fake news,” rather than leaving politics at home and fighting the ongoing humanitarian crisis. Puerto Rico deserves the same mobilized response that was given to Texas and Florida in the wake of Harvey and Irma. Puerto Rico deserves more than the callous relief efforts sent only to save face. It’s time for President Trump to step up to the plate.

Unity. Many times, it is hard to witness unity within a given community, especially one that is large, international, diverse, and heavily occupied with individualistic pursuits. However, it is often the case that in times of pressure or situations of confrontation an entire community can be brought together in unity and in respect for its proud, communal values. Such was the case last Thursday, Oct. 5, on the intersection of Forbes and Morewood.
It was a gloomy day, at best; shadowy clouds covered the skies, producing a murky, sunless atmosphere in Pittsburgh. Light rain began to fall around noon. Despite the usual weather, the Carnegie Mellon community was alert and tense in preparation for the unusual visitors that were to drop by in the afternoon. As students crossed Forbes Ave. to get to their morning classes, they noticed the abnormal number of Campus Police officers that were lined up on both sides of the street. A few hours later, Campus Police was joined by a squad of Pittsburgh City Police vehicles.
Around 1:30 p.m., four members of the Westboro Baptist Church (WBC), a hate group identified by the Southern Poverty Law Center and the Anti-Defamation League, had set up as expected, on Forbes and Morewood. The members had come to Carnegie Mellon to protest the acceptance of LGBTQ individuals on campuses around Pittsburgh, including the University of Pittsburgh and Duquesne University.
Their presence and motive, however, was no surprise to the CMU community. The four members of the WBC were met with hundreds of students, faculty, and staff that had organized a counter-demonstration called “Time to Shine.” While the four WBC protestors were cornered by heavy police presence, the entire intersection was bursting with members of our community. In midst of the rain, the street shined with students with rainbow banners and flags, dancing, playing instruments, chanting slogans, and standing in solidarity. Bystanders took photos and watched in awe.
During the demonstration, a bystander watching “Time to Shine” naively expressed his curiosity regarding the purpose of the event. “If there are only four protestors, what is the point anyway?” he asked. This point I must address.
With all due respect for this bystander that I overheard, “Time to Shine” has a paramount purpose: to support LGBTQ students in our community and to reaffirm our values of diversity and inclusion. While completely ignoring the WBC members may be a seemingly smart response to undermine the intention behind their protest, that is simply not the point. Frankly, “Time to Shine” was about neither the WBC nor its protest; it was about our school and our values.
Planned by the Social Impact Coalition, the Center for Diversity and Inclusion, and numerous other student organizations, “Time to Shine” was a student-led effort that amalgamated into the execution of a successful counter-demonstration. From the planning meeting on Sept. 30 to the preparation event on Oct. 3 to the demonstration itself, I was proud and amazed that the CMU community was able to mobilize so swiftly and efficiently, spreading the word and coming together in the face of hatred.
Furthermore, the actions taken by the student government — composed of the executive branch (the Student Body President and Vice Presidents) and the legislative branch (the Undergraduate Senate and the Graduate Student Assembly) — to help promote “Time to Shine” and to reaffirm its support for LGBTQ students was appropriate and representative of the values within our community. “We, the members of student government, want to convey our utmost support for the LGBTQ+ community at Carnegie Mellon and any other groups affected by the hurtful speech and actions of the Westboro Baptist Church,” wrote student government officials in a statement released on Oct. 4. “We want to reaffirm our commitment to ensuring Carnegie Mellon is a safe, diverse, and inclusive community. We call on our fellow students to support, engage and help one another.”
In an interview with The Tartan, Maitreyee Joshi, the chair of the Undergraduate Senate, commented that “the role of student government in the demonstration was twofold: one, providing support to those who may have felt hurt or unsafe during the demonstrations and, second, getting important information about the demonstration to the student body.” She added that the statement issued by the government “[reiterated] CMU’s values for diversity and inclusion and how [the government was] standing in solidarity with all the communities that were being directly targeted by WBC.”
The success of “Time to Shine,” the extemporaneous alliance of student organizations and the student government, and the passion that the hundreds of students displayed on Oct. 5 are testaments to the unity of the CMU community. It is through these times that the community is brought closer together, strengthening the community itself and our values in the process. We should all be proud of the actions that we have taken to show our support for fellow students, regardless of their sexual orientation. A lack of such demonstration would have prompted confusion and uncertainty, permitting WBC protestors to hold free ground without contest at our university.
“Thank you to each of the volunteers that stood in the rain and helped manage all of the calamity and commotion. It was great to see a mix of undergrad, grad, faculty, and staff all lined up to help,” wrote Victor Tavarez, a member of the Social Impact Coalition, in a concluding email sent out to the “Time to Shine” preparation team on Oct. 5. “Even though things did not entirely [go] according to plan, CMU [out-shined] hate.”
By 1:45 p.m., the WBC protestors left the scene, 15 minutes earlier than scheduled. Despite their original plans, they never visited Pitt or Duquesne.
Indeed, Carnegie Mellon out-shined hatred.

Gun violence has claimed an unforgivable number of new victims in the United States, thanks to political inaction and general desensitization.
I’m talking about Las Vegas, of course. But I could also be talking about Lawrence, Kansas. And Oakland, California. And Chicago. And Arizona. And Florida. In fact, since the shooting on Oct. 1 that took 59 lives and injured 530 more, there have been at least seven other gun-related incidents, with at least 21 other people injured and 10 more dead, in the United States.
Even though only the most dramatic shootings make the news, there is on average about one mass shooting per day in the United States. There have already been more than 47,000 incidents of gun violence this year, with more than 11,000 people killed. Around the same number of people die from gun-related injuries as car accidents. There is a significant difference, of course: operating motor vehicles is heavily regulated.
I can’t even take a bottle of water on an airplane because officials fear a "Muslim extremist" might use it to make a bomb, but a white man — statistically the most dangerous demographic to the people of this country — can buy a semi-automatic weapon in under 15 minutes. And Stephen Paddock, the wealthy, gambling, condo-owning man responsible for the Las Vegas shooting, had 23 of them in his hotel room. Some were even modified to be fully automatic.
I’m not going to say how the victims are in my thoughts — although of course, they are. But I believe it would be far more worthwhile, and hopefully productive, to talk about the one thing capable of stopping more people from becoming victims in the future: gun control.
At this point — after the 276th mass shooting this year, and 1,500th since Sandy Hook in 2012 — I’m not sure there’s anything new I can say on the subject of gun control. But bear with me as I try, because I’m not sure what else there is to do. 
Let’s pretend, for a moment, that the Second Amendment is meant to mean “every American citizen is entitled to their choice of firearm” and not, as many tired of the constant violence believe, that states are allowed to defend themselves with a private militia. Even with this looser interpretation, the truth of the matter is, the Second Amendment does not inherently protect your right to technology that allows you to shoot almost 600 people in ten minutes.
The founding fathers, who had not yet even dreamed of a bicycle or a vaccination or bifocals (for another few years, at least), who had only just heard of the flush toilet, could never have conceived of a weapon that could cause destruction and loss of life of this magnitude. If you want to stand in your field with a musket and fire two or three shots a minute into the abyss, more power to you. But if you for some reason want to fire off dozens of rounds in mere seconds, you’re almost certainly up to no good, and the state should be able to step in.
To me, the debate surrounding the Second Amendment isn’t even about the right to bear arms any more. It is about the stubbornness of staunch gun supporters to orient themselves against the “liberals” they feel are specifically targeting their rights. It is about the numbness people feel toward violence they see over and over again and can no longer imagine an end to. It is about the millions of dollars the NRA donates to Republican lawmakers every year. It is about the right to take lives with any gun, at any time that someone chooses.
But it doesn’t have to be this way.
Australia’s deadliest mass shooting, in 1996, took the lives of 35 people at a tourist site. In response to the shooting, the Australian government outlawed all automatic and semi-automatic rifles and pump-action shotguns and bought back more than 640,000 weapons that were turned in to authorities.
Gun-related homicides decreased by 7.5 percent per year after the legislation making these changes was introduced. Australia has not had a mass shooting since.
Japan, which has even stricter gun laws — citizens aren’t allowed to possess, carry, or buy handguns or rifles — is one of the safest places in the world  when it comes to gun-related incidents. In 2014, there were only six deaths caused by firearms — which, compared to the 33,599 in the United States, sounds almost unbelievable.
Even in America, the evidence is overwhelming. States with more guns, like Wyoming, Montana, and Alaska, have more gun-related deaths, including suicides, than states like Hawaii, New Jersey, and Massachusetts, where far fewer households contain firearms. States with tighter gun laws have fewer gun-related deaths. More police officers are killed on duty in states with more guns. 
Of course, there are nuances to the situations, and other factors affecting the decrease in gun-related violence and deaths. But if the general trends are anything to go by, certain steps go a long way in protecting people from firearms.
Despite this evidence, though, the conversation never really seems to change. Those who try to use mass shootings as a platform to call for change are accused of being too political, and insensitive toward the victims and their families. But what about future victims? If some technology in cars or vaccines or GMOs was repeatedly putting human life in jeopardy, people would be initiating conversations to try to bring about change. What is it about firearms that makes the similar discussion a taboo?
At the end of the day, the Las Vegas shooting is special, even for us. 59 innocent, human lives were cut short and another 530 people were injured. It’s the deadliest mass shooting in modern U.S. history. But will it be enough to inspire lawmakers to take action?
Honestly, I wouldn’t count on it. If we could live through Sandy Hook and decide firearms are more important than 20 kindergarteners’ lives, if we could witness the shooting at Pulse and decide that the right to “protect ourselves” is more important than the right to safely be ourselves, if we can decide that it’s okay to put police officers’ lives in increased jeopardy every day rather than take steps to decrease the danger they face in the field — I’m fairly confident that this newest incident is neither shocking nor traumatizing enough to drive lawmakers to ignore the NRA, look past their right-wing extremist voters, and take a stand.
Don’t worry, though. Maybe this will never happen again. After all — politicians are praying about it.

Editor’s note:  Transatlantic Thoughts is a weekly column that examines Carnegie Mellon’s student life from a foreigner’s perspective. Find previous installments @thetartan.org.
Last week’s article in this column concluded on the lack of common ground among Carnegie Mellon’s students. This week, I’ll try to explain more in-depth how this general problem plays out in the clubs and associations on campus.
When you look at the list of clubs here at Carnegie Mellon, it seems to correspond to what you could expect from an undergraduate campus: a couple hundred very diverse associations, apparently covering every field of interest. While student life is different from campus to campus, and you cannot compare them on an absolute scale, I think that some of the negative parts of the Carnegie Mellon spirit have tweaked the way people engage in extra-curricular activities, leading to a general lack of fun in student life, therefore increasing the “my heart is in the work” phenomenon causing workaholism that I described two weeks ago.
First, let us ask why people join clubs here at Carnegie Mellon. Each person has their own reasons, but for a good generalization, we can look at the recruiting arguments given to freshmen to encourage them to join clubs. The most important and recurrent argument (at least from what I’ve heard) is that students will learn new skills in a specific domain, often related to a professional activity. The most important word here is professional: joining a club is a way for you to take advantage of an extra-curricular activity to gain work experience and learn professional standards of quality.
For instance, look at this paper: the typesetting, illustrations, and production processes are similar to those of a professional newspaper. And the contents too: apart from seveal articles concerning Carnegie Mellon, the science, news, and Trump-bashing articles are similar to those disseminated by national news. Another example of this imitation game is the Lunar Gala. The event is impressive, the costumes and dresses have nothing to envy from professional fashion designer; and to measure up to the standard of this the organization also requires a tremendous amount of work with custom scene installation, video recording, lights, etc. Speaking of that, one of the most well-known clubs on campus is ABTech, whose goal is to provide professional-like technical services to events on campus.
And the relation between these organizations is professional too: clubs buy services from other clubs, as ABTech and cmuTV bill each of their service in student-organized events. This miniature version of a market economy seems to work very well and teach a lot of people how to be responsible technicians, events organizer and other kinds of trades, but is it really what extra-curricular activities stand for? As a naïve former undergraduate, I can’t help but wonder: where is the fun? After one year here, I am still searching for it: maybe all the fun is concentrated in the fraternities, but if I understand correctly the majority of people do not join a fraternity during their time on campus.
Related to that aspiration to mimic professional activities, I noticed an inflation of pedantic titles for “leadership” positions in organizations. Even as a writer in this newspaper, I am climbing the ladders of a ridiculous hierarchy ranging from “junior staffwriter” to a regular “staffwriter.” If these terms are perfect to fill the “interests” section of a CV, they contribute to transforming extra-curricular activities to another form of work. And I suspect that CV-filling might be one of the main reasons why people join clubs because academic performance alone is no longer enough to prove students can think outside the box and provide creative energy to a prestigious company.
It is an excess of seriousness that characterizes Carnegie Mellon’s student life. This seriousness certainly has good sides, like the impressive number of charity and service clubs that really show that students are engaged in encouraging positive change. But seriousness also comes regarding the nature of events and activities proposed by clubs. Almost every event proposes some kind of competition, of a battle between groups of people for a prize, with the aim of winning some sort prize, often in the form of cash or goodies. This competition, which is already present in academic work, becomes omnipresent and creates what I think is a perverted state of mind.
This leads to the ridiculous need of prize incentives for everything, even a housing department survey last year which offered Fitbits to people that responded to it. The problem with this kind of incentivizing and competition is that it kills any concept of community: you cannot create a lasting bond between people whose only shared interest is the perspective of winning something against other people.
This brings us to the omnipresence of money in extra-curricular activities: Carnegie Mellon’s student life is largely over-funded. While this seems to be a good thing, it actually worsens the excess of seriousness and professionalism. Indeed, because clubs are over-funded, they rely heavily on costly solutions to organize their events, often hiring external companies to help. For instance, cmuTV (funded by Carnegie Mellon) pays more than $35k per year to hire a video production company to set up buggy recording. The result, with 15 cameras and two giant screens, is very impressive, but one can wonder about the necessity of such a setup.
My opinion on this over-funding is that Carnegie Mellon is desperately trying to kickstart a rise in extra-curricular activities. While a couple hundred clubs might seem impressive, there are more than 10,000 students, meaning that a significant fraction of the student population doesn’t engage in an extra-curricular activity. Instead of looking at the real causes of why people don’t join clubs, which is that academic requirements are too time-consuming and stressful, the administration preferred to just pour money into the problem, hoping that it would resolve itself. The latest example of this money pouring strategy is the “UPLift Challenge.” It actually presents all the characteristics that I’ve discussed in this article. It’s a challenge (competition), a lot of money is involved (project funding), a lot of pedantic titles are used (just read the thanks section of provost Jahanian’s email), and it fits well on a CV. But do you honestly think that a “Campus Swingset” is really addressing the deep problems that undermine the students’ health and wellness?
Continuing to look away from the academic-related problems that undermine the mental health of a lot of students will take the Carnegie Mellon community nowhere. And while extra-curricular activities are the reflection of the general state of mind in the university, I think they play a great role by offering a good balance between work and fun. More cohesive events and actually letting students find ways to cope with modest means to achieve projects more modest in scope might help student life thrive at Carnegie Mellon University, without spending so much money on it. Because communities cannot be built upon a shared burden of stress and hard work, it is time to focus on the right problems if we want to move forward.

New memes are constantly emerging in today's society, especially among younger demographics. Hyper-partisan memes were prominent during the 2016 presidential election, and both Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton tried to use memes to swing votes in their favor. Controversial memes caused Harvard to rescind the admissions of at least ten matriculated Harvard students. Memes here at Carnegie Mellon picked up the attention of the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette with its popular Facebook meme page Carnegie Mellon Memes for Spicy Teens. But what exactly is a meme?
"Meme" is a neologism coined by ethologist and evolutionary biologist Richard Dawkins. He first introduced this term in his book The Selfish Gene to describe "self-reproducing ideas" that are transmitted in a non-genetic fashion. Examples of  memes, in the traditional sense, can be found in culture, religion, and ideologies. Memes are studied through memetics, which branches off into fields such as memetic engineering. Memes, both in the traditional definition and in the modern definition, significantly impact society. Politicians such as Trump have shared memes on Twitter, and meme pages such as Gary Johnson's Dank Meme Stash and Bernie Sanders' Dank Meme Stash have been platforms for people with similar political ideologies to share memes expressing their respective standpoints.
One pivotal and contemporary example of memes is found on Facebook, more specifically, Facebook events. Although the ability to host events is not a new feature to the platform, the popularity of spoof events has increased drastically. August saw the boom of "Naruto runs," where people, most notably college students, run across an open area such as a college campus like the iconic anime character. Although one would not expect much out of such a novel event, a considerable number of people partook in these runs.
Facebook event memes are not exclusive to lighthearted references to pop culture; there has also been a boom in events pertaining to the series of hurricanes that have happened this year. Hurricane Irma was met with countless events created by Facebook users impacted by the disaster. Some of these events were purely comical. One event was titled "Shame Hurricane Irma," a reference to Monty Python and the Holy Grail, and another was titled "Why Don't We Just PUSH Florida Somewhere Else!!" a reference to SpongeBob Squarepants. However, some of these event names were more political in nature. "Ignore the Hurricane Because Climate Change is a Hoax" took a fierce jab at the claims that Hurricane Irma was a hoax created to perpetuate the climate change agenda, and "Build The Wall Around [Hurricane] Jose" found an opportunity to criticize President Trump's controversial plan to build a wall between the United States and Mexico. Although these events, at first glance, seem to be funny posts that one would simply scroll through, many people legitimately participated in these events despite obvious safety concerns. Florida police had to warn the public not to shoot at Irma, which stemmed from a Facebook event.
The impact of Facebook event memes can be seen on a much more local level here at Carnegie Mellon. On Oct. 5, four members of the Westboro Baptist Church protested in Pittsburgh. Three universities — Carnegie Mellon University, University of Pittsburgh, and Duquesne University — as well as two high schools — Pine-Richland High School and Oakland Catholic High School — witnessed the four members singing parodies of hit songs and holding up vibrant homophobic and otherwise controversial posters. In response, Facebook event pages emerged. Some spread the word about serious counter-protests, but others continued the trend of spoof Facebook events.
Taking such a comedic approach to address and resolve an incident leads us to a debate. One major criticism that students brought up was that such jokes poked fun at a event with immense gravity and showed the privilege of non-marginalized students who are not attacked by this Church. This discontent was expressed through an "expanding brain" meme. The meme shows a ranking of different events, the top event being most preferred and paired with the smallest brain, following gradually expanding brains with gradually less desirable events that all lead up to the fully expanded brain and the least desirable event. This particular example of the meme suggests that the types of Facebook events that have emerged in response to Westboro's arrival do absolutely nothing to counter the issue at hand.
Furthermore, some students argue that the spoof Facebook event memes further desensitize us to future events by constantly poking fun at serious topics. However, other students argue that such memes do not inherently detract attention from the actual issue itself, meaning the events promoting Naruto runs across hurricanes do not make people perceive the hurricane as less destructive or deter evacuation plans. Founder and administrator of Carnegie Mellon Memes for Spicy Teens, Emily Newman, addresses that these memes were brought up among the other moderators of the meme group. Furthermore, she concluded that the spoof events were harmless because we "continue[d] to educate on the issue" that Westboro Baptist Church is a "hate group and serious" and the spoof pages did not clash with information about legitimate counterprotests.
Similarly to how propaganda heightened emotions of patriotism during World War II and how counterculture in the sixties moved away from the Cold War, memes are steering today's political atmosphere, especially for younger generations. Just as primary documents from the Cold War was presented to students in an Advanced Placement exam for U.S. History, so too may Internet memes will take their place within decades.

A lot of current social justice momentum is focused on changing individuals. For instance, some LGBTQ YouTubers made videos last August arguing that people who refuse to date transgender people need to self-reflect on the transphobic basis for their dating preferences. The point of these videos is to prevent individuals from harming oppressed people and therefore create safer spaces for the oppressed people. However, the strategy that focuses on changing individuals does little to nothing in terms of changing the overall structures that have created these individuals' problematic thoughts and behaviors in the first place.
In her video "Are genital preferences transphobic?," Riley J. Dennis states that she's "trying to show that preferences for women with vaginas over women with penises might be partially informed by a cissexist society," so people "should examine the societal influences on [their] preferences." She is essentially saying that having a genital preference is rooted in the belief that trans men and women are not real men and women, which is a transphobic belief, so by addressing one's societally engineered transphobic biases, one may learn to find binary trans people attractive. Marina Watanabe, another YouTuber, makes a similar argument in her video "RE: Arielle Scarcella and Genital Preferences": "Sometimes it's good to look at societal bias and how that might affect our preferences. It's never a clean cut like you have to do this, you have to f*** this trans person, but, hey, let's examine our biases and start a conversation."
Both of these women are acknowledging that the issue is really society and not the individual at all. In a society where it is common practice to assume that a child is a certain gender until proven otherwise, where the government tries to prevent trans people from using the bathroom matching their gender identity, where the narrative about transgender people is that they start out as one gender and become another rather than that they discover who they were all along (even the word "trans" suggests a movement from one thing to another), it is not a surprise that people would have a instinctual association of genitals with gender and doubt the realness of a trans person's gender. Dennis and Watanabe's solution to this problem is an individual reflection. While perhaps this individual reflection and education can change an individual, it's like putting a bandaid on a bullet wound — individual reflection won't do anything to change the fact that people are raised to only see the validity of cisgenderism.
A more effective solution might be to implement more legal protections for trans people that let them do things like use the bathrooms of their gender rather than of their biological sex or give them more legal frameworks under which to press charges against harassment. Such laws would represent a national culture of acceptance that would empower and validate trans individuals. Additionally, education on transgenderism should not be a private endeavor. Rather, children should learn in school about gender identity and expression so that they can grow up with the assumption that transgenderism is legitimate. These open-minded children would grow up into accepting and informed adults more accepting of the idea of gender-based rather than sex-based sexualities. A third solution is to increase mainstream media representation of transgender people. Transgender people are largely missing from movies, TV shows, and books, and the few that they do appear in are either obscure or problematic. When transgender people are pushed to the fringes, it furthers the narrative that cisgenderism is the norm and transgenderism is a deviation. There should be more movies about the trans women of color who led the early LGBTQ rights movement, books about trans people in love, and television shows about realizing one's gender identity and coming out to those close to you. And this media should be normalized to the point that everyone consumes it regardless of whether one is trans or cis.
Sexual attraction is among the most subconscious, primal human experiences, so it can be nearly impossible to consciously change them, and attempting to dictate people's personal choices can actually drive them away from the movement. If it were a society that changed, however, people would not be systematically molded to have transphobic biases in the first place. If trans-accepting changes were made in the three areas of public policy, public education, and media, it would redefine the way that people see and define gender, so transphobic dating preferences would become a thing of the past.
The left often takes the sort of individualistic approach promoted by Dennis and Watanabe to solve systemic social problems. Especially in leftist social media activism, the onus is on the individual to educate oneself and prevent the propagation of oppression. Perhaps this happens out of necessity, as real liberals are rarely represented in positions of power, or maybe it happens because people want to create safe places for marginalized people in the moment. Either way, this sort of patchwork change doesn't really affect the overall systems at play. Instead of trying to change individuals, we should strive to create a society where acceptance doesn't have to be taught because it can be intuited.
