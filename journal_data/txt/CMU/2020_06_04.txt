For Carnegie Mellon students who are not currently in Pittsburgh, or who have been unable to attend any of the recent Black Lives Matter protests, it may be difficult to understand how the city's protests have played out from afar ー social media clips capture brief moments, and some information dispersed from the the city and local media outlets have been heavily disputed by attendees. The Pittsburgh protests this week, attended by thousands, have been almost entirely peaceful thus far, with little to no evidence of protester escalation, despite initial reports from Pittsburgh Mayor Bill Peduto and the Chief of Police Scott Schubert to the contrary. 
The first of the handful of protests this week was held in East Liberty on Monday, June 1. Protesters carried signs, locked arms, and stopped at intersections around the neighborhood. At each stop, organizers and attendees spoke to the crowd through bullhorns and a PA system. One woman told a story of her family’s experience with police brutality. Organizers urged protesters to remain nonviolent. At a stop in front of the Home Depot in East Liberty, “Oh, Freedom” by The Golden Gospel Singers played over a loudspeaker as the crowd raised their right fists. 
Throughout the march, chants rang out: “black lives, they matter here”; “back up, back up, we want freedom, freedom, all these racist ass cops, we don't need 'em, need 'em”. When the march concluded in front of Target, there were police with rifles on the roof. An organizer said “alright, now go home.” Not everyone did: a smaller group of protesters continued marching down Centre Avenue toward Shadyside. 
This group was met by Pittsburgh police, who ordered the group to disperse and declared the assembly unlawful over a loudspeaker. Videos on social media appear to show that protesters held firm, but did not instigate conflict with police. After more loudspeaker warnings, the group was fired upon with rubber bullets and bean bags, and canisters of gas were launched. The crowd scattered. 
That night, the City of Pittsburgh held a press conference to discuss the events of the day. The information they told reporters at the live-streamed press conference differs greatly from protester accounts and videos of the altercation. City officials made little differentiation between the group of protesters on Centre Avenue that was met with police and a smaller group that went toward Station Street after the original protest concluded, painting them both as violent.
Mayor Peduto said that he had attended the protests, and that from 4 to 7 pm, he “witnessed peace,” but after he left, he said, “what ended up happening from 7 until 8 was very different.” Peduto cited “separate groups” splitting off from the main protest for “violence and destruction” and the altercations with police, which was used as a justification for use of force. In Peduto’s described timeline, it was “after the first volley of bricks at police officers” that police officers used “smoke, not gas” to disperse the crowd. As a reason for the police response, Chief Schubert said of the protesters, “they’re not going to a picnic, they’re throwing bricks and rocks at our officers,” an argument that was made repeatedly to say that protesters instigated the conflict. Video evidence does not support this claim.  
Chief Schubert also told reporters that the city knew “they were gonna loot East Liberty at 8 o’clock,” another reason that supported an increased police presence as the curfew loomed Monday night. Wendell Hissrich, Director of Pittsburgh Public Safety, said, “they were going to break into the businesses, destroy the businesses, and we were not gonna let that happen.” Officers described the protests as largely peaceful, with outside agitators causing trouble. “Some of it’s pure anarchy,” one officer noted.
City officials claimed Monday night that the city did not use tear gas at the protest, but instead “smoke” and other “chemical munitions.” This claim has been walked back by the city, which now admits that tear gas was used.
Many in the comment section of the livestream of Peduto's press conference voiced their concerns with the information shared: “LIARS”; “So [Peduto] has 'proof' but he can't show it due to 'contractual' obligations to the [Fraternal Order of Police]”; “There was no bricks being thrown. I witnessed the whole thing first hand.”; “If there was no video you could get away with these lies. But there are.”; “Was it rocks or bricks? And why is it there is NO VIDEO FOOTAGE of this on any social media???”; “I was in the tear gas so you cannot lie to me." One reporter tweeted a photo of “the tear gas canister a Pittsburgh police officer threw past my feet.”  
On Wednesday, June 3, after confirming many of the police’s claims about the incidents in East Liberty, Mayor Peduto issued a press release requesting an independent review of the events by the Office of Municipal Investigations and the Citizen Police Review Board. “Without question, there is a difference of opinion about what happened that day and the appropriateness of the actions of the Pittsburgh Bureau of Police,” he wrote. 
Another large scale protest was held the day after the march in East Liberty, this time starting in Market Square downtown. It was put together by the same organizers, who led a march through downtown, across the Tenth Street bridge, through Southside, and back, sitting down in intersections chanting passionately. One organizer reminded people over a loudspeaker: “this is a peaceful protest.” 
As the group of protesters marched past the Allegheny County Jail toward downtown, incarcerated men could be seen raising their right fists in support, and banging on their windows. One protester shouted, raising his hands up, “this is for you!” 
The protest concluded peacefully in Market Square, where organizers got the crowd to disperse in different directions. No arrests were made. 
The next protest put together by the organizers of these two is on Sunday, June 7th. Other separately organized protests are planned throughout this week and for this weekend.

Pride Month may look different this year than in years previous, but pop singer-songwriter Bronze Avery is still ready to get you in the spirit. His groovy tunes and dreamlike bops are here to help you feel confident and proud of who you are. Basically, his music is the kind that you’d blare in your car radio in some ethereal queer universe. In an interview with The Tartan, Bronze Avery shares his experiences of being a gay black musician.
Bronze Avery’s confidence in his identity as a gay black man and as a pop musician stands unwavering today. Over the years, he’s learned that “your identity doesn’t have to get in the way... and can actually be celebrated at the same time.”
“I was kind of hiding that part of myself to appeal to mainstream,” he says of the beginning of his music career. Bronze Avery started that career in 2015 with his EP American Dream, under his birth name Gabriel Brown. He later switched to the stage name Bronze Avery to distinguish himself from other artists with the same name.
However, the change in name was not the only difference in his music as Gabriel Brown and as Bronze Avery. The musician began incorporating his queer identity into his art. This shift helped him realize that hiding a key component of his identity prevented him from forming a connection with listeners. Embracing his queer identity allowed him to find an authentic fanbase and distinguish himself from the status quo.
“Being black has been kind of interesting,” he reflects. “I love being black, but it seems like the industry loves you being black, but only in the way that they want to see you be black.” His heart lies in pop music, citing artists like the Pussycat Dolls and Charli XCX as some of his biggest musical inspirations. However, he has felt the pressure to restrict his options as a musician, especially by what kinds of music he was expected to create as a black musician. In an interview with Billboard, he confessed his frustration with automatically being typecast as an R&B musician when he tells people that he is a singer. But, with a wide grin, he asserts, “We gonna change that.”
Bronze Avery learned to define his own music. “My music is generally dreamy… sexy and sassy,” he describes it. He uses it as a medium to seamlessly champion his black and queer identity without making it the focus. In his music video for one of his most listened-to songs, “Want 2,” he portrays the story of a dancer lusting over his instructor. The video’s cast is made up of queer men of various body sizes, a powerful, yet subtle, attribute. He normalizes interracial queer romance throughout this video, doing so in a way relatable to people of many backgrounds. Ultimately, this song and video summarizes one of his hopes for his art: normalizing his truth.
The musician may be confident in who he is and in the art he produces, but he has had to build that confidence up. “Society painted [being black] as a flaw,” he states. However, he is proud to be black and celebrates black contributions, especially in art. “Half the shit people like and love come from black people,” he tells The Tartan with a cheeky smile. Today, he wants “black people to know that they are beautiful and amazing and regal,” because he remembers when “I did not think that of myself.” 
“[Coming out] was kind of a mess,” he laughs. During his freshman year of high school, he left his MySpace open on the family computer. His mother then learned the singer’s sexuality. He now looks back at his experience of coming out as “probably one of the best ways to have come out,” despite the initial awkwardness.
It wasn't until his junior year that he felt confident enough to champion an important part of his identity. He recalls that “I kind of had to go back into the closet.” Since then, he has stood firmly by his sexuality. Today, he endorses the “corny but true phrase: ‘it does get better.’ And it totally does get better.”
Mainstream pop music has ways to go in terms of representation, both in terms of queer and racial representation. Bronze Avery hopes to help inspire other black and queer musicians, as well as encourage people of color and queer people to step into other positions within the industry. Incredible yet overlooked talent is out there waiting to be discovered; it’s a matter of having people on the lookout for “when we’re gonna see the shift in the mainstream narrative.”

Singer-songwriter Mila Jam is the pop princess who is probably missing from your summer playlist. In an interview with The Tartan, she talks about her experience as a black transgender woman in the music industry.
Even if this is your first time hearing about Jam, you might have already seen her perform as Britney Houston in the late 2000s through the early 2010s. Jam created this drag persona while on tour for the musical Rent. She described making parodies as a “play on the things that I loved,” like pop culture and music videos. She was confident in her identity as a woman during this time, but “my womanhood [was seen] as a joke” in the eyes of the millions of viewers of her videos. Britney Houston was a character that existed only on the internet; Mila Jam was who she truly was.
Jam describes her experience coming out as queer as “multilayered.” She first came out as gay in high school, but she could not vocalize her gender identity then. “The second time I came out… was after I had moved away from home to New York to become a professional actor.” On a road trip with her mother, Jam told her mother about the early stages of her gender transition. Jam’s mother was apprehensive, questioning why Jam’s femininity could not just stay within her act as Britney Houston. However, Jam remained steadfast in her identity as a woman, and later got support from her mother.
One thing that was clear during the twenty-minute phone interview with Jam was how much she valued hope and self-motivation. She held her gender and her identity in her grasp with no uncertainty of what would come next. “It’s my experience to create it [my life] how I want,” she reflects. This unapologetic confidence radiates through the lyrics of her feel-good bops and her energetic music videos.
Jam’s core beliefs, combined with her life experiences, greatly drive her art and her activism. This inspiration clearly shows in her music, and can be heard in one of her most popular songs, “Masquerade”. She vigorously defends herself and demands to be respected through her powerful lyrics. In the corresponding music video, she stands firmly with “STOP KILLING US” painted all over her body, the “STOP” spelled out boldly in the colors of the transgender pride flag.
Jam also reveals the harsher realities disproportionately facing black transgender women. She confronts this uncomfortable truth directly in her song “Bruised”. She begins the music video with “This is dedicated to every woman, specifically Trans Women who have lost their lives at the hands of their abusers.” In the video, the critically-aclaimed actress and black transgender activist Laverne Cox embraces a bruised and vulnerable Jam in her angelic arms. 
To Jam, this intersectional issue is not only about equality for black transgender women, but also for the black community at large. Her activism “push[es] the conversation forward with our black brothers and sisters who are cis” that often fall by the wayside. In this conversation, she recognizes her “passing privilege,” or her ability to present herself as female without having people dismiss her gender identity based on appearances. She recognizes the nuances and the possible discomfort that discussing these inequities brings, but that makes it all the more important.
Jam also aspires to help change the narrative in the music industry. “Queer artists are putting in the work” with their talent and drive, but the people running the industry are doing listeners a “disservice if they’re not paying attention to LGBTQ artists.” Queer representation has increased over the years; most people would probably be able to name at least five mainstream celebrities who identify as LGBTQ+. But how many artists are in the mainstream who are LGBTQ+ and POC, especially LGBTQ+ and black? The question gets harder to answer, and Jam recognizes that.
At the end of the day, she wants to encourage her listeners to be bold and aware of social injustices. Jam is a testament to the power of self-empowerment, and her voice is one that will resonate with listeners of various backgrounds. “The most beautiful thing in the world is a black trans woman thriving,” she states. And even through a phone call, it's readily apparent that she is living that image.

Korean American film director Justin Chon’s 2017 film Gook flew under my radar until it popped up on the Facebook page “subtle korean traits”. At the time, I was only acquainted with what Korean Americans remember as Saigu. I had not, however, understood how much the events of Saigu had heightened inter-minority racism. The stunning black-and-white filmography introduced me to a Pandora’s box that I wish I had opened sooner.
Gook tells the tale of two Korean American brothers, Eli (Justin Chon) and Daniel (David So). They maintain their late father’s shoe store in Paramount, a predominately African American community in California. They form a friendship with a black 11-year-old girl, Kamilla (Simone Baker). Despite their experiences with racism — particularly between Black Americans and Asian Americans — the three form a family-like bond. In an hour and a half, Chon captures the complex inter-minority racial tensions that couldn’t be ignored after Saigu.
Saigu, in this context, translates to “four two three,” a reference to the L.A. riots that began on April 23, 1992. Four officers of the L.A. Police Department (LAPD) were acquitted for using excessive force in the beating of the unarmed black man Rodney King. Over the six days following the verdict, the ensuing uprising disproportionately affected Koreatown. This further exacerbated racial tensions and reshaped the Korean American identity.
Gook was not intended to be educational, so I would recommend supplementing this movie with further reading. For example, the riots were not solely in response to the verdict of the Rodney King trial. One critical portion that the movie did not explicitly mention was the murder of Latasha Harlins, which played a part in Koreatown being the target of the riot. In 1991, Korean shop owner Soonja Du fatally shot Harlins, a black 15-year-old. Du could have faced up to 16 years in prison. Instead, she was sentenced to a mere five years on probation, 400 hours of community service, and a $500 fine. The week before the riots, the California Court of Appeals upheld the sentencing decision, 3-0. The murder and lack of justice further contributed to the preexisting racial tensions, yet it was not given the same attention as the Rodney King trial.
With that said, Chon did not omit Harlins altogether. In the film, Kamilla faces discrimination from Mr. Kim, the owner of a nearby liquor store. This racial tension escalates to Mr. Kim pointing a gun at Kamilla, clearly referencing Harlins’ murder. Kamilla’s brother, Keith (Curtiss Cook, Jr.), also holds resentment towards Asian Americans after the family lost their mother in a Korean-owned store, which he shouts at Kamilla in one scene. However, these instances serve more as a subplot and a backstory, respectively, rather than a crucial moment between these two minority groups. I felt that this was a notable disservice to the film, making the racial conflict possibly appear more one-sided than it actually is.
Overall, Gook was a moving film that illustrated the complexity of interminority racism and its impacts on individuals. The film crushes the traditional “model minority” portrayal of Asian Americans. It unveils the reality of the “American Dream” that attracted many of our parents to start a new life in a new country. Kamilla’s unlikely connection with Eli and Daniel demonstrates the beauty of human connection and the need to embrace, not fear, our differences.

Social distancing has scattered college students across every corner of the Earth. Despite being physically apart from our universities, we are all united by one global platform: Zoom.
Carnegie Mellon’s decision to move classes online was one that many students were expecting, but were still surprised by. In a group chat, recent School of Computer Science (SCS) graduate Shreyan Bakshi and SCS rising sophomore Mehul Agarwal exchanged memes about now attending university on Zoom.
“We sort of realized that there is a market for such memes, and we started a Facebook group as a joke,” Agarwal recalled. “Turns out, a lot of people connected to that.”
Since its inception on March 11, the Facebook group “Zoom Memes for Self Quaranteens” has attracted over half a million members. Various publications such as The New York Times and The Atlantic have taken notice of how college students are using memes to cope with the challenges of the pandemic.
Although the group inevitably touches on COVID-19 and its consequences, it maintains a lighthearted haven for members to bond over. Agarwal summarizes one of the page’s biggest themes: “we all are under the same institution: Zoom University!”
“Zoom University” refers to the phenomena of colleges across the country flocking towards the remote conference platform. Students in 2020 are trying to finish the academic year with as much structure and normalcy as possible. Quarantining brings out chaos, irregular sleep cycles, and — of course — cringeworthy TikTok dances. We may lack a physical campus and the quirky traditions we would normally practice, but Quaranteens have established an extensive student body and a campus culture in a matter of days.
With thousands of memes on the page, it's hard to pick a standout favorite. Agarwal highlights one that he found from another college meme page, “UC Berkeley Memes for Edgy Teens,” that he later reshared. The meme is a galaxy brain meme that suggests that the ultimate way to make a move into a girl's heart is not through text or Instagram DMs, but through Zoom private messages. "I think one of the memes that was the impetus of starting the group is definitely on my all time favorites," he recollects sentimentally.
Aside from lighthearted memes, the group has raised over $4,000 for the Center for Disaster Philanthropy (CDP). The organization helps donors make disaster-related giving decisions to help optimize available resources. The donations collected through “Zoom Memes for Self Quaranteens” will be used towards the CDP COVID-19 Response Fund. The organization is supporting nonprofits to help protect vulnerable populations. They are also working with non-government organizations to support healthcare workers, particularly vulnerable individuals, and other important hygienic work.
Despite social distancing and its potentially isolating effects, Quaranteens have shown that a virtual community can come out of a lonely time. “I’ve realized, looking at how the group is growing after each refresh, that humans are social animals,” Agarwal reflects. This realization fuels the positive energy that runs throughout the group. In a time that could easily turn to despair, “Zoom Memes for Self Quaranteens” provides an outlet for students to remain optimistic. Moving forward, Agarwal states, “I just hope that we continue to do the same throughout these challenging times.”

It’s said that a watched pot never boils. The administration at Carnegie Mellon has looked away for far too long, and now, the pot is boiling over.
Since the murder of George Floyd on May 25, the university community has received two emails responding to racism on campus and in Pittsburgh from the university administration. The first came on May 30, where President Jahanian wrote:
"At times like this we must reflect on what we can do to make society, including our own community, more just. It would be inadequate to restate our commitment to respect, value and foster diversity, equity and inclusion across our community. We know we have much work to do to live out these values at Carnegie Mellon."
A follow-up email from Provost Jim Garrett and Dean of Students Gina Casalegno, titled “Actions Against Racism,” was sent on June 8, but the only novel action proposed was a new “university-wide forum” that will begin in the fall. The other actions mentioned include a renewed search for a Vice Provost of Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion, which was postponed due to the COVID-19 pandemic, and the implementation of departmental plans for inclusive behavior. Both actions are the result of the Campus Climate Task Force, which has been a long process of forums, town halls, and listening sessions over the past few years.
On the same day as Provost Garrett’s and Dean Casalegno’s follow-up email, two professors in the English department, Richard Purcell, associate professor of English, and Jason England, assistant professor of creative writing, published an op-ed in The Chronicle of Higher Education deriding the ineffective responses of administrators at Carnegie Mellon and across the country.
If the statements are designed to pacify the members of the institution, they have done a poor job of doing so. Purcell, who wrote that he was asked to edit the university’s statement, said that none of his edits made it into the final copy. “Part of what I realized in being asked to contribute, even though I was being invited in, was that I had no say,” Purcell said, “as one of the few black faculty as CMU, it makes me question what that value is. 10 percent feels very personal, but the majority of my feelings are questions about what is the role of faculty like me and Jason at CMU. It seems like we’re here just to say that ‘we have black people here.’”
“There’s a difference between maintaining the health of a community and managing a brand. When you’re managing a brand, you’re relying on market values. You don’t have to make a strong statement because it is reliant on that,” England said, “Beyond brand management, the response to societal unrest and systemic universities is supposed to be forward-thinking and critical, but these statements seek to placate.” 
Both professors believe strongly in the core values of the university. Purcell cited the university materials about its core mission, saying that it is good stuff, but the issue is that the statements released by the university don’t live up to those values and don’t represent the constituency of the university. 
Purcell and England are not alone. A faculty petition, titled “Time to Stand Up,” demanded that Carnegie Mellon take more action than what was originally laid out by the administration. Originally co-authored by Purcell and a group of faculty, the petition quickly gained traction, with 215 faculty signers from across all colleges. 
The petition asks for clear leadership that declares support for protesters, denounces militarized police and their tactics, supports policies that defund policing in favor of community building, and supports policies that end systemic racism.
President Jahanian responded in an email to faculty and staff:
"Finally, I should let you know that we have received a number of email messages, petitions and suggestions from students, faculty, staff and alumni this week. I want to assure you that we are listening to all of these thoughtful suggestions and constructive feedback, and our leadership team met yesterday again to sift through them to identify and prioritize the ones that we will enact. We will be sharing those with the community within the next two weeks."
Two weeks after that email was sent, the administration has not made a public statement about the petition or its demands. There have been no statements that publicly denounce the policies cited in the petition that perpetuate the reality of systemic racism at Carnegie Mellon or in Pittsburgh.
Another faculty petition has seen no public response from the university. John Soluri, associate professor of history, started a petition that asks Carnegie Mellon to ensure all staff, contractors, and subcontractors are paid appropriately and have appropriate PPE for the duration of the pandemic. 184 staff and faculty have signed that petition.
——————————————
On June 3, the Carnegie Mellon Graduate Student Assembly (GSA) released a letter responding to President Jahanian’s original statement, but they were one of many organized letters, petitions, and campaigns to which the administration has not adequately responded, according to organizers. 
GSA has released a resource guide along with their letter. A coalition of students and student organizations, including CMU Call to Action, the Black Graduate Student Organization, the National Society for Black Engineers, SPIRIT, the Heinz College Council for Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion, and more, wrote a letter to the administration. Master’s students in Human-Computer Interaction wrote a letter to their administration. 
Students from across the university have collected resources, like testimonies of racism at Carnegie Mellon, readings about blackness and black art galleries in Pittsburgh, and a succinctly compiled list of policing technologies developed at Carnegie Mellon. There are petitions that ask Carnegie Mellon to confront racist policing in Pittsburgh and racism among the members of our institution. There is a GoFundMe for Carnegie Mellon students to give back to the community. There is an alumni boycott, withholding donations from the university. And there are the beginnings of an organized student movement that intends to withhold their labor from the university until something changes.
The organizers, creators, signees, and more have all expressed their frustration with the lack of administrative response.
After President Jahanian’s first email, a number of GSA students discussed how it seemed lackluster, according to VP of Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion, Satvika Neti. “None of it addressed CMU’s own complicitness in racism both on campus and off… and none of it was action-oriented. When we were crafting our own statement, it was like really delving deep into CMU as not free from failure here,” Neti said. 
A few of the things Neti cited as actions that contribute to racism at Carnegie Mellon include hiring practices, some of the ongoing research on campus, and student and faculty retention. According to a 2018 report by Linda Babcock, James Mellon Walton Professor of Economics and Head of the Department of Social and Decision Sciences, and Rosalind Chow, associate professor of organizational behavior, Carnegie Mellon has the lowest percentage of underrepresented minority (URM) faculty of its identified peer institutions. 
The next line of the report reads, “If CMU maintains its rate of hiring, promotions, and exit rates of female and URM faculty, representation of URM faculty will decline over time and representation of female faculty will stagnate at its current level.” 
As for student retention, the six-year graduation rates for Black students is 10 percent below that of their white and Asian counterparts; for Hispanic students, it’s nearly 15 percent below. Some of the research on campus that has had a wide-ranging effect in the world includes studies on predictive policing or ongoing military research at Carnegie Mellon.
GSA VP of External Affairs, Divyansh Kaushik, added to Neti’s comment, saying that the university released a similar statement after the acquittal of Michael Rosfeld, specifically noting that no email came after Rosfeld killed Antwon Rose II, “You read those emails, and they sound awfully like risk management.” “It was the same ‘we hear you, we see you, but we’re not going to do anything,’ the common buzzwords that everyone wants to use these days,” Kaushik said. 
Both Kaushik and Neti discussed the importance of retaining the current energy among students over the long term, saying that Carnegie Mellon has a short institutional memory. Neti said that, among master’s students, there’s a joke that issues will be brought up every two years and administrators can say, “Oh! We’ve never heard of that before!” 
They’re also both frustrated with the university’s response to racism on campus. Neti mentioned that some administrators are often myopically focusing on the good the university does, rather than engaging with the negative aspects of university life. Additionally, the budget is often cited as an excuse for being slow to action, but the budget shows where priorities lie. If you care about racism, then the budget will reflect that, Neti said. 
One of Kaushik’s frustrations is that the administration wants to help change the university culture, and Neti agreed, but important conversations are occluded from the students. There is little transparency in what they do.
The opaque response from administrators, slow movements to action, and marketing lingo in the university press releases has led to more and more students becoming frustrated with the institution, leading to more and more action by students, that leads to more of the same responses from administration.
——————————————
“It started quietly. We had gathered to pay tribute to a man who had died at the hands of an assassin the day before. We all hoped that the service would bear wit­ness to a sincere change in the attitude of the white community. And yet, those who knew — those who had been at Selma, or in  Montgomery, or on the March to Washington  — those who knew realized, slowly, sickeningly, that nothing had changed at all,” reads the April 10, 1968 edition (Vol. 67, No. 25) of The Tartan. It was published six days after Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. was assassinated.
The article goes on to say that the administration at the time had done the bare minimum. They made a statement about “rededicating their lives,” which was the popular language of civil rights at the time, functioning in much the same way Kaushik sees “we see you, we hear you.”
Recently, a few students collected and synthesized some of the university’s archives, one student focused on Black students at Carnegie Mellon. They write, “The lack of black faces at Dr. King’s memorial, the lack of Black peers on campus, and even the lack of Black voices in the conversations discussing the lack of Blackness, were all too telling to remain silent as a campus community. A call to action was needed and whether or not it was heard is open for discussion.” 
Today, there is the same call to action.
Jasmine Bitanga, a Master’s student in Mechanical Engineering and Secretary of the Black Graduate Student Organization (BGSO), wrote to The Tartan, “There is global unrest against racism in the midst of a global pandemic. Although I understand that strategic change takes some time, especially during such an intense time in history, there is a sense of urgency that must come with this particular deliberation.”
Bitanga signed onto an open letter to President Jahanian and the top administration, along with a number of other members of BGSO, like Lisha White, PhD in mechanical engineering and President of BGSO; Shaquetta Johnson, Master’s in electrical and computer engineering and CIT and Treasurer of BGSO; Malik Blackman, PhD in mechanical engineering and social chair of BGSO; Bryanna Brown, Master’s in Electrical and Computer Engineering and Vice President of BGSO; and, Uche Agwu, PhD in Mechanical Engineering and community service chair of BGSO.
Since then, BGSO has focused on making sure the members of their organization are doing well. BGSO President Lisha White wrote, “Initially, we sent out a letter to BGSO members reinstating the importance of their physical and mental well-being. Since the response, we’ve hosted a check-in with the CMU student body, mainly graduate students attended. The purpose of that meeting was to provide a space for people to gather as a community and have good fellowship.”
They’ve also worked with other student organizations to create a unified message around racism at Carnegie Mellon. A few of the members discussed specific things they’d like to see change. The lack of black faculty and students needs to change to have a more inclusive environment. A mandatory black studies class, educational sessions on biases, and diversity would make Carnegie Mellon more inclusive. Shrinking or removing the school’s police force, diversity education during orientation, and giving more funding to the Center for Diversity and Inclusion would make Carnegie Mellon more inclusive. 
This is the fight that black students and black faculty have been fighting every day. “In addition to experiencing the repetitive trauma as a person of color, these faculty members must also put in extra hours for all these exhausting discussions, while also supporting the students of color they mentor - and they are not compensated for any of this,” Bitanga wrote. 
And for all of these unpaid committees and town halls and extracurricular conversations that Black professors do, any attempts to enact real change remain frustrated.
Bryanna Brown attended a university before Carnegie Mellon, where racist acts were more commonplace and more vitriolic. She wrote, “It is an endless cycle of an incident occurring, students asking for a response from administration, the administration provides a superficial response with no action, then 6 months later another incident occurs, and then we are back at square one… at this point, I am just tired.” 
Shaquetta Johnson attended an HBCU before Carnegie Mellon. Since the end of May, her alma mater has released “an entire agenda listing support and efforts toward removing any affiliates who have shown their racial bias and/or examples of discrimination.” Johnson wrote, “I cannot say the same for CMU. I believe that we feel like we are unheard because no one is trying to listen. That is clear.”
Even for brand new positions at Carnegie Mellon about diversity, equity, and inclusion, Uche Agwu writes, “Sometimes these task forces will lead to new diversity and inclusion positions within the administration or the school, but I’m not sure that these new positions are being given the resources they need to actually succeed and make the difference they were hired to make.” He believes that the administration needs to act on and respond directly to student demands.
Malik Blackman originally thought the statement calling for the renewed search for a Vice Provost of Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion was fine. It made sense, but as others explained to him the long-standing issue around administrative complacency in response to racism, as he has only been at Carnegie Mellon for a year, Blackman’s frustration grew. “They’re more about talking the talk, than walking the walk, which is something I’ve heard is very common at Carnegie Mellon.”
He continued, “A lot of people like to feel that, since things aren’t bothering them, that things aren’t a problem. I want it to be clear that Carnegie Mellon acknowledges why and how they’ve created a space that is more comfortable for those who are white than those who are non-white,” Blackman said. 
Testimonials of racist speech, racist acts, and accounts of institutionalized racism have taken place at Carnegie Mellon in the last two years. So far, the university has directly responded to ‘the map incident,’ which came as a result of problematic university marketing material. Where the effects of a poorly-designed marketing gimmick are often abstract, the effects of racist speech on individuals are well documented. University administration, quick to respond to the map, has not responded to cmutestimonies.site, which is a quickly growing repository of racist speech on campus.
Lisha White contributed her own difficult position at Carnegie Mellon: “I have a responsibility to my research advisor and CMU to perform innovative research and outstanding deliverables. I also have a responsibility to all underrepresented minorities, especially black people, to speak out and find ways to uplift the people who are trying to get where I am. Finally, I have a responsibility to myself to stay healthy and whole. CMU is pressuring me to choose and that’s not what I read on the CMU’s vision/mission/values page.”
As Shaquetta Johnson described, she is often an “only-only” at Carnegie Mellon, or the only woman and only Black person in a room. Black students are tokenized. Black students are on the receiving end of racist speech. Black students deal with bad crime descriptions from the Carnegie Mellon Police Department. Through it all, they still are students. Black students are a part of the constituency of the university, and the administration has not responded with direct action to the issues on campus.
——————————————
Students, faculty, and staff have driven the response to racism on campus. 
Beyond the faculty and staff petitions, the GSA statement, and an open letter to President Jahanian organized by a few different student groups, there has been a wide-ranging response by students on campus, but no matter what, every group is demanding that Carnegie Mellon administration do more.
Conlon Novak, a Master’s student in HCII, organized a website, demand-cmu.support/blm, that has collected the different actions, petitions, and resources developed by students. Novak, who has pushed for change in his Master’s program and in Orientation, where he was previously a Head Orientation Counselor, said, “Organizing is hard, especially at CMU. So the website evolved from a place of how to uplift students who are already organizing, while recognizing that my voice doesn’t necessarily need to compete with others that are already organizing university-wide initiatives. The website is meant to elevate those conversations.”  
Chloe Wen, a sophomore in psychology, worked with a few members of No Tech for ICE in developing petitions that asks administration to take a stand against racial prejudice on campus and policing in Pittsburgh. “Are they really listening to me? Are they really looking out for our best interest or their best interest?”
A fifth-year art student and No Tech for ICE member Darya Kharabi helped with the petitions and cmutestimonies.site. They said that there is something unique about these protests. Things are changing, and students are taking action. “When the time came, we felt it was time to utilize our own skills and capabilities and our own social networks, to use whatever we have for good, basically,” they said. 
Professors have taken action, too.
Stefanie Sydlik, associate professor of chemistry, posted a comment on the Carnegie Mellon Facebook page Overheard @ CMU, saying, “I'm proposing the inclusion of a Diversity statement in all syllabi and mandatory bias training at University Education Council. In the late 90s/ early 2000s the university put in a [conscious] effort to combat sexism and consequently we are one of the leaders in STEMinism. I believe we can make the change to make our university welcoming and inclusive for ALL.”
Associate Professors Paul Eiss and John Soluri have helped organize the “Time to Stand Up” petition and a petition that asks for protections of Carnegie Mellon custodial staff, respectively, and another group of faculty organized a petition asking for the removal of recent hire Richard Grenell. Eiss wrote in an email, “As we developed it [Time to Stand Up], it seemed like something that seemed like it could be of wider interest, so we sent it to friends in a couple of [Dietrich College] depts to see if they wanted to sign on as well. We also sent it to people we knew in a few other depts and schools in other colleges. At the time, I expected it might end up being a couple of dozen signatures. But it caught fire — people reforwarded it, and it eventually got to the size it is now.” There were over 200 signatories when it was forwarded to President Jahanian. The petition for the removal of Richard Grenell has over 200 signatories. The petition asking for protections of custodial staff has just under 200 signatories.
Alumni are organizing, too. Taylor Tabb, a recent alumnus (‘18 and ‘19) and one of the organizers of cmu.wtf, said he wasn’t involved much with activism on campus during his time here, but he’s asked his friends, “Is this it? Is this Carnegie Mellon students finally taking ownership of their power as students? I don’t think I’ve ever seen people as passionate about the direction the university is taking.” 
cmu.wtf has more than 670 current and future alumni signed onto their pledge to withhold donations from the school until administration takes action. Tabb, who worked for Deeplocal in Pittsburgh until the pandemic, was plugged into campus conversations, so he decided to help boost the students who were asking the administration for a better response to racism on campus. The easiest way to do that, of course, is to withhold donations.
The organizers of the ongoing boycott emailed the university’s top administration, and they did receive a response. However, Tabb says that they didn’t directly address the boycott, instead of pointing toward an abstract future announcement: “alumni are very much in favor of what students are attempting to make happen,” he said. 
Campus activism at Carnegie Mellon is flourishing. Yet, there have been no promises of wide-reaching change, and activism must continue if there is to be a fundamental change at the university.

Dear President Jahanian, Provost Garrett, and Vice President for Student Affairs Casalegno,
We hope you and your families are well during these troubling times in Pittsburgh and the US. We are writing to ask that you please use your power as regional leaders to protect your students and the Pittsburgh community from senseless acts of state violence. This is a request that you take immediate policy action that goes beyond words and promises. In addition to this letter, we are aware of many other independent statements and a petition being circulated that support these actions, as well as other actions that Carnegie Mellon can take at this critical time.
As you are aware, on 25 May 2020, the Minneapolis Police Department brutally killed George Floyd. He had moved to Minneapolis to make a better life, but was laid off due to COVID-19 pandemic state mandates.
Justifiably, protests have emerged nation-wide to emphatically state that #BlackLivesMatter while demanding immediate justice for George Floyd and an overhaul of the racist American criminal justice system. This is the same criminal justice system that has resulted in the deaths of David McAtee, Tony McDade, Breonna Taylor, Ahmaud Arbery, our own Antwon Rose II from Pittsburgh, and countless other lives, without real consequences for the police force. 
Unfortunately, protests against police brutality have been met with more police brutality. In multiple days of peaceful protest, Pittsburgh police escalated the situation with tactics of control and intimidation. On Saturday, police responded disproportionately to the destruction of an abandoned police vehicle, attacking mostly peaceful protestors with mounted units, tear gas, rubber bullets, and a militarized SWAT team in tactical gear. On Monday, police shot unarmed peaceful protestors with rubber bullets and sprayed them with tear gas. Firsthand reporting and video evidence confirm police fired on protestors without provocation. Undoubtedly, in doing so, the police threatened the lives of Carnegie Mellon's past, present, and future students, among others.
Policing and violence are unwarranted, ineffective, and unjust responses to community grief and trauma.  Moreover, such responses endanger the lives of all Pittsburghers, especially the Black and Brown communities, and other communities of color. Instead of showing solidarity and taking any responsibility for the state-sanctioned infliction of violence and trauma, Pittsburgh Mayor Bill Peduto has defended the approach of the police, blaming “outside agitators” for dividing a hurting community.  
Mayor Peduto’s defense suggests that if thousands of people act peacefully but one person does not, the entire police department has a free pass to use violent tactics against the people. Moreover, the rhetoric of “outside agitators” has long been used to undercut and delegitimize the work of Black organizers and community leaders, such as during Ferguson and the Civil Rights Movements. 
As conditions in this country showcase authoritarianism and state-sanctioned violence, we depend on local leaders to respond with compassion and concrete actions. We know Carnegie Mellon's administration is dedicated to protecting freedom of speech as well as advancing Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion. We have heard each of your words taking personal and institutional responsibility, including in President Jahanian’s latest remarks: “At times like this we must reflect on what we can do to make society, including our own community, more just.” If ever there were a time to turn these words into actions, it is now.
To echo Angela Davis: “In a racist society, it is not enough to be non-racist—we must be anti-racist.” To protect its past, present, and future students, to honor Carnegie Mellon's commitment to the greater Pittsburgh community, we are requesting that you begin with the following actions:
President Jahanian should contact City of Pittsburgh Mayor Bill Peduto to demand non-violent, trauma-informed, and de-escalatory state responses for all protests from now on. There are 50 years of research showing that of the many possible responses to protest, police violence is escalatory and dangerous for everyone. 
Carnegie Mellon should officially cut ties with the police departments of the City of Pittsburgh, County, and all other regional municipalities. These departments must have their budgets reduced and be incentivized to adopt evidence-based use-of-force policies that have been shown in 30 years of research to end police violence. There is precedent for this as shown by the bold leadership of University of Minnesota President Joan Gabel, who announced last week that UMN has cut ties with the Minneapolis Police Department.  
Carnegie Mellon should end its Predictive Policing project partnership with the City of Pittsburgh Bureau of Police, a covert and dangerous partnership that has been long opposed by impacted Pittsburghers. 
Importantly, these actions are not just immediate emergency responses to the longstanding crises of police brutality and an unjust carceral system, but also acts of reparation for past and current wrongs that Carnegie Mellon has committed against the communities in which it is embedded. In addition to the Predictive Policing project above, this includes Carnegie Mellon’s recent erasure of black neighborhoods for up to ten years through official university marketing materials and the legacy of gentrification of Oakland and East Liberty. Long-term actions should also be taken within the Carnegie Mellon community to ensure that our daily actions — research, building and infrastructure projects, and otherwise — do not perpetuate, but instead actively dismantle the racist structures that have led to these tragedies. Following through on these actions, both short-term and long-term, will hold true to the call of #CMUAgainstRacism.
We know from working with you that you are personally committed to these issues. We ask that you please take these recommendations to heart and do right by the communities that our institution has vowed to serve. So many lives — and the future of our community — depend on it.

The murder of George Floyd in Minneapolis, MN on Memorial Day has sparked thousands of protests in cities and towns across the globe. Police violence has never been as visible as it is now, and the video of George Floyd's murder at the hands of a white officer obviously resonated in the current environment, saturated as it is with dire projections of economic ruin, death by virus, or now — death by cop. The tinder was laid by a disastrous response to the COVID-19 pandemic which put millions out of work, and by the lack of response to police murders and brutality extending back decades.
At every turn in the recent uprisings, the police have raised the stakes, gassing and beating peaceful demonstrators across the country. Now, ordinary people, rather than flinching from the occupying forces, continue to risk a COVID-induced death to show their opposition to their reign of terror.
In Pittsburgh, it was no different. The protest on Saturday, May 30, that eventually sparked a riot resulting in 44 arrests and 60 businesses damaged in Downtown Pittsburgh was peaceful throughout until the police left a police car to be vandalized. They rushed in with mounted officers, and eventually, sent in battalions of riot police armed with 40mm ballistic rounds, bean bags, and chemical weapons.
Before the police car was destroyed, the march proceeded peacefully throughout downtown Pittsburgh, with marchers holding signs, chanting in support of Black lives, and remembering the victims of police brutality like East Pittsburgh resident Antwon Rose II, who was murdered by police two years ago. The march stopped at street intersections, circling in the space and listening to speakers. The only tense moment came when a man with a megaphone interrupted the speakers with an exhortation for people to vote in the Democratic primary for the progressive congressional candidate Jerry Dickinson, who was also participating in the march.
This was not received well by the crowd, and the man was quickly confronted by organizers of the march, shouted down, and pointedly ignored by the crowd. The march snaked through Downtown, with protesters sitting-in, raising fists, and creating a general sense of solidarity and mutual anger at a brutal system of oppression. Once the march had made it to Centre Avenue next to PPG Paints Arena, at the foot of the Hill District, the organizers attempted to disband the protesters, to some success. The majority of the crowd, however, remained standing on Centre Avenue, enjoying the nice sunny weather and feeling of solidarity after months of struggling under the quarantine.
Eventually, my group and I drifted to a fence further up the hill, which provided a nice view of the protesters below. From there, I was able to see the crowd congregating around a police car that had been marooned next to the sidewalk. There was some activity in the crowd, which quickly intensified when multiple mounted officers began riding through it, before being driven off by protesters. They retreated to the top of the hill, where they could be seen standing next to an ambulance. Meanwhile, the crowd, now angered by this escalation of force, began destroying the car in earnest, before lighting it on fire. The burning car put an end to things for a few people, but the crowd mostly just gave it some space, as live ammunition began periodically exploding.
Some people began dragging construction signs and debris to form low barricades, and as the car started burning lower and the helicopters kept circling, we began making our way out of the area and headed home. Someone warned us that riot cops were “at the top of the hill,” so we headed up a different direction, cutting back to Centre Avenue in the end. Along the way, we saw the ambulance and the horse cops up close, along with three or four SWAT police in military camouflage. We originally thought they were National Guard, but the indiscriminate lettering on their vests made it possible to identify them once we were close.
Upon reaching the top of the hill, we were greeted by what appeared to be about a hundred police mustering in front of the Zone 2 police department and the parking lot of the neighboring Ebenezer Towers. The entire area was shut down by police, some redirecting traffic, others in camouflage standing on the roof of the police station with rifles. The mood of the police seemed extremely cheerful, with officers smiling and laughing to one another, waving at us as we took pictures and video, and holding up cell phones to either take selfies or pictures of us recording them. After about 15 minutes, several sprinter vans and paddy wagons filled with riot police rushed down Centre Avenue, and the riot police in the parking lot lined up, put down their visors, and began marching down the hill. We all made our respective walks home safe and sound and un-gassed.
The protesters remaining had no such luck, and neither did the protesters at the peaceful march two days later in East Liberty. This one featured helicopters hovering low over buildings, SWAT troops in military dress on top of the Target, and police surrounding the protesters throughout the march. After the leaders of the relatively spontaneous march told people to disperse, I left the area, exhausted and on edge. The people who stayed, including several friends of mine, continued marching down Centre Avenue, before being confronted by a line of riot cops. These officers, after telling protesters that their peaceful assembly was now “unlawful,” shot tear gas and 40mm rounds into the crowd, striking and injuring multiple people. My friends helped a man who had been shot in the face by a 40mm round, who was bleeding so heavily they “couldn’t tell if he was black or white,” helping him into a nearby parking garage until someone came by with a car that could get him to the hospital. Following this violent police riot, Pittsburgh Mayor Bill Peduto initially stated that the attack came in response to violence caused by “a splinter group” before calling for police reform and investigations into the officers’ use of force a few days later. The protests since have stayed remarkably peaceful, the police keeping their distance and refraining from attacking the marchers.
Pittsburgh’s response to the mass expression of rage at a violent and destructive police force has been alarmingly violent and destructive. The shows of force by the Police Department have been disgusting. At every march, at least one police helicopter hovers over throughout, drowning out speakers and surveilling marchers. At one recent sit-in, a fixed-wing surveillance plane operated by the state police circled continuously, in addition to the choppers. Protesters have been attacked with chemical weapons and dangerous projectiles in response to light property damage and peaceful demonstrations alike. Militarized troops point weapons at unarmed demonstrators, loom ominously in the sky, and harass Pittsburgh residents recording their brutality, charging two women with felonies for allegedly throwing water bottles from their balcony while they simply recorded a protest, according to the Pittsburgh City Paper. It is an obvious lie, intended to intimidate people keeping a record of their depravity.
As the police show their role as an occupying force ever-more baldly, we at Carnegie Mellon should keep our own complicity in the police state’s ongoing reign of terror well in mind. Carnegie Mellon’s “Metro21: Smart Cities Institute” works with the Pittsburgh Police Department on “Predictive Policing” algorithms, used to “predict crime hot spots,” which have been criticized for “[giving] racially biased policing methods the appearance of objectivity, simply because a computer or an algorithm seems to replace human judgment,” according to the Brennan Center for Justice. The police also make huge use of cheap surplus military equipment, which one study found "fails to enhance police safety or reduce crime.” All it does is intimidate minority residents and erode public trust in the state. Carnegie Mellon’s own cozy relationship with the military and contractors like new Board of Trustees member and missile systems company CEO John Pranzatelli raises questions about the university’s contribution to the increasing militarization of our society. Carnegie Mellon is as much a part of the community as anything else in Pittsburgh. The university owes it to the city to help end police violence. That means ending relationships with the police, supporting police defunding efforts, and contributing to minority communities.

A decade ago, the world saw massive protests after the 2008 financial collapse. From the G20 protests in Pittsburgh to the global Occupy Movement, the international system of economic inequality was revealed to the people of our generation, as, years later, the eight wealthiest people in the world own as much wealth as 3.6 billion people. 
We continue to celebrate the wealth of these people — Jeff Bezos, Mark Zuckerberg, Bill Gates, and more — as signs of our universal prosperity, despite the fact that 1 in 6 children, 1 in 4 Native Americans, and 1 in 5 Black Americans live in poverty. No person should worry about having a roof over their head, having food on their table, or having clothes on their back. 
The United States’ jail and prison system capitalizes on this vast inequality, disenfranchising low-income groups. At the same time, America’s legacy of institutionalized racism has led to the disproportionate imprisonment of Black people. Prisons and jails function as one social institution in our global system of inequality. 
Another is the American university. Traditionally, colleges are designed to lift up the stricken and create a new professional class, somewhere between the CEOs and the workers in the warehouse or factory. This was Andrew Carnegie’s original intention in creating Carnegie Tech, but this is not how Carnegie Mellon works.
In recent years, American colleges have only perpetuated inequality. A study from The Brookings Institute found Black Americans are, on average, $7,400 more in debt than white Americans four years after matriculation and $25,000 more eight years after. A second study corroborated the findings, concluding that Black Americans had $7,721 more in debt than white Americans, even among low and moderate income levels. 
At Carnegie Mellon, only 4 percent of the population are Pell Grant Recipients, and 5 percent of the student body are Black. Almost half of the families in the United States are eligible for a Pell Grant, and almost 15 percent of the U.S. is Black.
Right as the Occupy protests in 2011 were winding down, a Black teenager, Trayvon Martin, was murdered in Florida. Trayvon Martin is just one of many. A few years later, another teenager, Michael Brown, was killed by police. In 2015 alone, 104 unarmed Black people were killed by police officers. 2018 saw another teenager, Antwon Rose II, killed in East Pittsburgh. 
George Floyd was murdered on May 25.
A sum total of our unequal institutions, America’s racism and inequality are the fuel for the protests we see now. George Floyd's murder was the spark. 
Carnegie Mellon, as a social institution that has not made active steps toward fixing the system of oppression, has allowed this historical evil to persist in our current world. Now is not the time for Carnegie Mellon to make empty statements. Words alone are not enough. Now is the time for Carnegie Mellon to stand up for what is right and take concrete action against racism and oppression.
A number of letters and petitions are circling campus, and we stand by all students, staff, and faculty who are fighting to create change in our racist institution.
