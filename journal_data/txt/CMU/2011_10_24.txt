Cèilidh Weekend, which draws its name from the Scottish Gaelic word meaning “visit,” is “a celebration for the entire Carnegie Mellon family, combining the traditions of Homecoming Weekend, International Festival and Family Weekend,” according to Carnegie Mellon’s website. Traditionally, a cèilidh (pronounced kay-lee) is a party hosted in the homes of family and friends, characterized by music, dancing, and storytelling.
“We selected the Scottish Gaelic word cèilidh because it represents a traditional social gathering and pays tribute to our founder’s heritage,” said Dan Barnett, director of on-campus programs for Alumni Relations, in a university press release.
A modern-day cèilidh can be anything as informal as a house party, concert, or traditional Scottish dance. Depending on the region, Scottish cèilidhs are most likely to be dances in the Lowlands and concerts in the Highlands. Traditional cèilidh dancing is an important component at these events, where dance numbers such as “Strip the Willow,” “The Gay Gordons,” and “The Military Two Step” are regularly performed, according to Scotland.org, a Scottish government-run website. Cèilidh dancing is essentially the Scottish version of American line dancing, and it has grown in popularity over the past few years. The purpose of the relaxed, unpretentious dance movements is enjoyment, not exhibition. 
With the creation of Cèilidh Weekend, Carnegie Mellon has taken the tradition of cèilidh and redefined it to encompass a number of the university’s own customs.
In previous years, the International Festival and Family Weekend were held in early October, and Homecoming Weekend was held in early November. Last year’s Homecoming committee made a concentrated effort to promote participation in the event. 
“We want students to know that it’s not just a piece of paper you get from here, but it’s the experience,” said Maricel Paz, one of the chairs of this year’s Student Homecoming Committee. To simplify coordination of Homecoming, International Festival, and Family Weekend, Cèilidh Weekend was created and a new Carnegie Mellon tradition was formed. 
Changes such as celebrating reunions during Spring Carnival and Reunion Weekend, instead of during Homecoming, will leave more room for the alumni awards, lectures, and art exhibits that will make up much of the upcoming weekend.
“The common goal is to bring the entire community — students, families, alumni, faculty and staff — together in celebration,” Barnett said in a press release.

The Alumni Awards ceremony, organized by the Alumni Association every year, honors and celebrates alumni, faculty, and students for their contributions to Carnegie Mellon on Friday in Rangos Hall (See map 13 on A8). The ceremony is free and open to the public, and it will be followed by a reception in the Great Hall of the College of Fine Arts building (See map 14 on A8).
Beginning in 1950, the Alumni Awards have recognized over 750 alumni, students, faculty, and distinguished individuals within several categories of service and dedication to the university.
The highest award given this year is the Alumni Distinguished Achievement award. This particular award honors those alumni who have outstanding accomplishments and contributions in any field or profession. For the 2011 Alumni Awards Ceremony, Dale Clevenger (A ’62) and Hillard M. Lazarus (E ’70) will be honored with the Alumni Distinguished Achievement award. Past winners of this award include Naoko Matsubara (A ’62) in 2010, Ray H. Baughman Jr. (S ’64) in 2007, and William Purcell (E ’44, ’49) in 2002.
Specific awards are also presented to students and faculty. The Faculty Service Award is given to professors for their commitment to the support and education of Carnegie Mellon students, and the Student Service Award is given to current Carnegie Mellon students for outstanding service to the university, the student body, and the community. 
The last winner of the Faculty Service Award was Amy Burkert, the vice provost for education, in 2010.
One of the rarest awards in the program is the Alumni Association Inspiration award. The association only presents it to those alumni who exemplify the characteristics it views view as most representative of Carnegie Mellon — creativity in problem-solving, interdisciplinary collaboration, and generosity of spirit in inspiring and mentoring others. For example, this award was presented to Randy Pausch (S ’88) in 2007.
The Alumni Awards program has been a long-standing tradition for Carnegie Mellon. According to the Alumni Association’s website, “Among our greatest assets are the alumni, friends and students who continue to make possible this university’s vigorous pursuit of excellence.”
The awards program was created to strengthen alumni relations as well as recognize exceptional dedication to the university.

Blood cancer and transplant expert Dr. Hillard Lazarus (E ’70) is one of two recipients of the 2011 Alumni Distinguished Achievement Award.
Lazarus’ interest in medicine grew out of his Carnegie Mellon undergraduate days in civil engineering, when a few researchers in his department began working on bioengineering problems. 
“They had a couple guys who were working in one corner of Porter Hall that were into so-called biotechnology,” Lazarus said. “I was really captivated when I was a student: They were doing phenomenal things ... and I got really excited about it.”
One of the researchers put Lazarus in contact with a cardiac surgeon at West Penn Hospital in Bloomfield; while working with the surgeon, Lazarus studied flow dynamics in order to improve the efficiency of a mechanical heart valve. From there, he said, he got “hooked” and began to focus on medical research instead of engineering.
Lazarus graduated from medical school at the University of Rochester in 1974, and today he specializes in blood and bone transplants at the University Hospitals Case Medical Center in Cleveland. The center is affiliated with Case Western Reserve University, where Lazarus also serves as a professor of medicine. He is currently working on cellular therapy — in effect, programming cells to carry out different functions.
“Instead of just giving a drug or a radiation or a this or a that, we’re actually starting more and more to harness human cells,” Lazarus said. “What we’re doing ... is taking cells and putting them into the right circumstance. For example, we’re fixing people that have multiple sclerosis by putting in cells that are going in to act as repair and anti-inflammatory [cells]. Flabby hearts are getting juiced up with cells from the outside that go into the heart and fix the heart and make it work better.” Such procedures, and other advances in the area of regenerative medicine, may eventually be able to replace entire organs.
Already regarded as a pioneer in non-embryonic stem cell transplants, Lazarus received the American Cancer Society’s Lifetime Achievement Award in 2007. This year, U.S. News & World Report and Castle Connolly Medical listed him among the country’s top doctors, ranking him in the top 1 percent of hematologists nationally based on peer reviews.
Lazarus said he has four passions: his family, fighting cancer, the Pittsburgh Steelers, and Carnegie Mellon. As an alumnus, Lazarus has been enthusiastic about Carnegie Mellon for over four decades.
“No matter what I said I wanted to do or how I wanted to do it, they would just open doors for me,” he said, speaking of his undergraduate professors. “These guys wrote great letters for me to get into medical school, and they just bent over backwards to help me, and I’ve remembered that my whole life to the point that I will do anything for the university.”
As examples of his dedication, Lazarus has served on university panels, the president’s advisory board, and the Dean’s Council. He also recruits high school students, and he and his wife Joan have established a scholarship at the university.
Lazarus looked back on his student days as a special time of his life. “When you’re trained at a place like Carnegie Mellon, they help you learn how to think differently,” Lazarus said. “The spirit, the culture — you can cut it with a knife. You can stop students on the quad or see people in class — they get it, and you get it, and there’s this feeling you can’t explain to an outsider.”
Dr. Hillard Lazarus will deliver an Alumni Distinguished Achievement Award lecture on Thursday. He will speak at 6 p.m. in the Rashid Auditorium (Hillman Center 4401).

Dale Clevenger (A ’62), the principal horn player for the Chicago Symphony Orchestra (CSO), has been chosen as this year’s recipient of the College of Fine Arts Distinguished Alumni Award. Clevenger has been in the CSO for 45 years; he currently serves as a professor of horn at Roosevelt University and an adjunct professor at Indiana University’s Jacobs School of Music.
Clevenger was first attracted to the horn at a young age, when his father took him to local concerts. “The horns gleamed and caught my eye. Their sounds resonated in the marrow of my bones. The more I listened, the more I became infatuated,” Clevenger said on his website. In an interview, he explained that he loves how “the horn is a very versatile instrument. It’s a brass instrument, but it gets paired with the woodwinds. It gets paired with the strings.”
Clevenger, who paid his way through Carnegie Mellon by performing with local symphonies, won the position of principal horn in the CSO only four years after graduating. He credited winning the position with the CSO, whose brass section The New York Times has called “legendary,” to “a lot of hard work and an excellent education” at Carnegie Mellon.
He quickly garnered acclaim as an instrumentalist in the CSO; the Milwaukee Journal praised his playing as “satin smooth,” and the Chicago Tribune wrote, “Dale Clevenger has been widely and justly admired in every musical capacity.” 
He has received three Grammy awards, recorded six albums, and premiered John Williams’ Concerto for Horn and Orchestra, a piece the CSO commissioned for Clevenger. He also held an adjunct professorship at Northwestern University’s Bienen School of Music for 27 years.
Clevenger has also worked as a conductor, leading multiple orchestras, including the New Japan Philharmonic, the Shanghai Symphony Orchestra, the West Australia Symphony Orchestra, and the National Philharmonic of Slovakia. He admitted, however, that between playing the horn and conducting an orchestra, “conducting is easier.”
Even though he has held the same position for over 40 years, Clevenger is still passionate about his career: “I get to wake up every day and do what I love,” he said.
Despite all his personal successes as a musician, Clevenger considers his moments as an ensemble member to be the highlight of his musical career. “The [CSO] went and performed in New York City at Carnegie Hall for the first time in several years ... and the audience applauded for over 20 minutes,” he recalled. “I’d never heard of anything like it before then or since then.”
Clevenger recently endured a personal tragedy. His wife, Alice Clevenger, died this past March after battling cancer for eight years. “I still can’t talk about her without crying.... You don’t move on,” he said, as he choked up.
From this loss, though, sprang the generosity of his friends and peers. This September, after returning home from the CSO’s European tour, Clevenger received a package from Williams. “At first I thought it was just some final revisions [on the Concerto for Horn and Orchestra],” he said. “But then I opened it up and I saw what he had done.” Williams had composed a piece titled Serenade for Horn and Strings dedicated to Alice Clevenger.
“I cried for 20 minutes [when I saw that] because I knew what it meant,” he said. “It meant he had dropped everything ... for however long it took [to compose the piece for her].” By comparison, it had taken 10 years for his commissioned Concerto for Horn and Orchestra to be completed.
While Clevenger said that he would not be able to perform the piece, as it would be too emotional, he does already have an idea as to where it will premiere. He established the Alice R. Clevenger Scholarship in his wife’s memory at Roosevelt University, where she was a horn professor, and he hopes to throw a benefit concert to raise funds for the scholarship. Yo-Yo Ma, who became the CSO’s first creative consultant in 2009, has already agreed to perform at the concert.
Clevenger will deliver a lecture in Kresge Theatre on Friday at 2 p.m. and a master class in Kresge on Saturday at 9:30 a.m., both of which are open to all School of Music students, faculty, and staff. The Alumni Awards Ceremony will take place in Rangos Hall on Friday at 5:30 p.m.; pre-registration is required to attend.

“It’s a privilege to pee,” claims the Tony Award-winning musical Urinetown, written by Mark Hollmann and Greg Kotis. 
The Scotch’n’Soda theater group will be presenting its rendition of Urinetown from Thursday through Saturday in McConomy Auditorium. Since the beginning of the school year, the group has been hard at work putting the production together.
Urinetown’s director, senior directing major Christian Fleming, discussed the show’s current progress and what it means to the theater group’s performers. “I think the production is a big undertaking for Scotch’n’Soda and really has pushed the limits of what Scotch’n’Soda can do,” Fleming said via Facebook message. “It is bold, highly theatrical, and I personally think, quite entertaining.”
Shalaka Kumar, a first-year information systems major, reflected on the upcoming production: “I think there will be really interesting and funny themes. I really want to see how it will play out. Oh, and I have a friend performing, so I guess I’m a bit more invested.”
Urinetown is a musical set in a world where a drought has led to a severe water shortage. To manage water consumption, people are forced to pay to be able to urinate in public facilities. Bobby Strong, played by first-year piano performance major Stephen Murphy, leads a revolt to free the citizens from authoritarian control over what they consider to be a basic need.
When writing the musical, Kotis was apparently inspired from his travels in Europe where he stumbled upon pay-per-use restrooms. Paris has been one of the leading cities to pioneer the idea of public pay-per-use toilets. 
Using a restroom may seem like it should be an innate human freedom, but one may forget that there are costs involved with the upkeep of a restroom. However, this is not the case in Urinetown, in which the authorities are charging to deter the heavy use of restrooms in order to keep from using too much water. It will be interesting to see the manner in which the production portrays this bizarre world.
The production has been highly anticipated by students, largely due to the work the Scotch’n’Soda theater group has done with past performances such as The Rocky Horror Picture Show, Boeing-Boeing, and What We Bury.
“I think that people will be surprised by the overall level of professionalism, talent, and quality this production is offering,” Fleming said. “It showcases work from a variety of majors and has come together with the dedication of freshmen all the way to Ph.D students.”
Urinetown can be seen in McConomy Auditorium on Thursday and Friday at 8 p.m. and on Saturday at 2 and 10 p.m. Tickets can be purchased at www.snstheatre.org or at the door.

Convents and debauchery come together this weekend in the School of Music’s opera show, Sacred and Profane. The performance consists of two one-act shows: Kurt Weill and Bertolt Brecht’s “Mahagonny-Songspiel” and Giacomo Puccini’s “Suor Angelica.”
The first act, “Suor Angelica” (“Sister Angelica”), is set in a convent in 17th-century Italy and focuses on Sister Angelica, a nun from a noble family with a mysterious past. The opera, which premiered in 1918, is the second in a trio of Puccini’s operas known as Il trittico (The Triptych).
Kati Richer, a sophomore vocal performance major, is in the opera’s chorus and is one of three sophomores in the production. The cast members have been rehearsing the show since school started, Richer said. “We rehearse a lot, but it has been a great experience to get to work with our stage director [Dorothy Danner] and our music director [Maria Sensi Sellner], who I normally wouldn’t get a chance to work with.”
Danner is a guest director who has served on the faculties at the Julliard School and the Curtis Institute of Music; she also stage-directed Carnegie Mellon’s production of Nine in 2007. Sellner, a Carnegie Mellon alumna with degrees in both mechanical engineering and music composition, is in her 10th and final season as music director of the All University Orchestra and the String Theory Chamber Orchestra. 
The second act, “Mahagonny-Songspiel” (“The Little Mahagonny”), is a cantata based on five “Mahagonny Songs” that Brecht had published in 1927 in his collection of poetry, Hauspostille (Devotions for the Home). The cantata follows “ ‘everyman’ people leaving their life behind who are going to the fabled land of Mahagonny, [where they] can do anything they want,” explained Tyler Alderson, a senior vocal performance major in the show.
“For them, it means gambling and having sex and essentially having a free-for-all,” he said. “They go to this place and all hell breaks loose, because when you can do whatever you want, there’s stealing, there’s killing, there’s chaos.... They eventually get disillusioned.”
The opera, which was a precursor to a larger experimental opera that Weill and Brecht later wrote called The Rise and Fall of the City of Mahagonny, was “tough, because it’s essentially an ensemble piece,” Alderson said. “There aren’t arias. There are some solos, but there aren’t a ton.... It’s six people in an ensemble who are all singing together.”
The ensemble nature of the opera presented more than just vocal challenges. “It’s tough because you have to from that ensemble make out individual characters. So we’ve had to do a lot of extrapolations — so using the text and going beyond the text to try and draw out things and make sense of it,” Alderson explained. “The text is blunt at some points, but it’s also [sometimes] vague, almost.... The character has been made pretty much by us, using the text as a guideline.”
Alderson also praised Danner. “The director has done a very good job of taking this work that doesn’t give much of an arc or a storyline ... [and] filling in the blanks, using both the larger opera that came later and also by making the conscious decision not to use the larger opera [in some cases].” For example, “The narrator is a character we’ve created, specifically to help bridge that gap between the audience and to clue the audience into what exactly is going on,” he said.
He summarized “Mahagonny-Songspiel” by joking, “Everyone’s drinking and drugged out — it’s great! It’s the best of human nature.”
Sacred and Profane will be performed at 8 p.m. this Thursday, Friday, and Saturday, and at 2 p.m. Sunday, in the Philip Chosky Theater in Purnell. Tickets are $15 for adults; $12 for senior citizens, staff, and faculty; and $10 for students.

This year, the International Festival will be a part of Cèilidh Weekend, and will celebrate Carnegie Mellon’s ethnic and cultural diversity. Although typically held during a separate weekend from Homecoming and Family weekends, the International Festival is now part of a larger celebration. The festivities will include keynote lectures, traditional religious ceremonies, and an international poster and photo fair.
The main events of the International Festival will center on keynote lectures and discussions by Freddie H. Fu, M.D., and novelist Chris Abani.
On Thursday, Fu will host a discussion on his personal experiences and his career in the medical profession, specifically within the field of orthopedic surgery. His lecture will be followed by a Q & A session.
Fu grew up in Hong Kong and later made his way to America, where he attended Dartmouth College as well as Dartmouth Medical School. He eventually arrived in Pittsburgh, where he attended University of Pittsburgh’s School of Medicine. Since then, Fu has worked at Pitt for 36 years.
He specialized in sports injuries and spearheaded the creation of UPMC’s $80 million Sports Performance Complex, a state-of-the-art sports medicine complex which opened in 2000. The center has acted as a model for other medical complexes around the world and has attracted surgeons from over 50 countries on six continents.
On the topic of the center, Fu said, “People come to Pittsburgh [to learn about sports medicine] ... not just patients, but also countries.” He explained that the center was an opportunity to “rejuvenate Pittsburgh” and to “showcase that we [Pittsburgh] are a very good place.” 
Fu, a Chinese-American, has made numerous contributions to the Pittsburgh community and even has a noodle dish, the Dr. Fu’s Special, named after him at Lu Lu’s Noodles on Craig Street. Fu’s cultural diversity and commitment to the community made him an obvious pick to highlight the goals of the International Festival.
The second keynote lecture, taking place on Friday, will center on Abani and his experiences as an exiled writer. His discussion will be followed by a special luncheon.
At 18, Abani was imprisoned by the Nigerian government for his first novel, Masters of the Board. In the novel, Abani describes a fictional takeover of the government. The Nigerian government believed it was a real plot for rebellion and subsequently imprisoned the author. After serving six months in jail, he was released but continued to speak out against the government. Abani was ultimately arrested and jailed three times and was almost sentenced to death.
Abani finally fled Africa in 1991, and fled again to the United States in 1999. After escaping political suppression, he was able to write freely and publish his works without fear. “Happiness is learning to live with difficulty and grace,” he said, in reflection of his experiences in Africa.
He has published three novels, two novellas, and five books of poetry. Abani is currently a professor at the University of California, Riverside, and the recipient of the PEN USA Freedom-to-Write Award. He also received the 2001 Prince Claus Award, the Lannan Literary Fellowship, the California Book Award, and the Hurston-Wright Legacy Award.
Besides the keynote speakers, the International Festival will incorporate the experiences of students who have studied abroad. The Tartans Abroad Poster Displays will showcase posters, photos, and other memorabilia in Kirr and Hoch Commons in the University Center throughout Cèilidh Weekend. This event will showcase Carnegie Mellon’s international campus locations as well as provide information on the cultural opportunities that study abroad programs give students.
The International Festival will also feature a dual religious celebration of Eid and Diwali, traditional Muslim and Indian festivals, respectively. Taking place in Wiegand Gym and sponsored by MayurSASA, the event will celebrate the religious and cultural histories of South Asian countries as well as the different ethnicities within the Carnegie Mellon student body.

Carnegie Mellon’s MayurSASA will be hosting a joint celebration of Diwali and Eid ul-Fitr in the University Center’s Wiegand Gym on Thursday. The event will feature games, crafts, live performances, and a buffet of South Indian fare.
The games and crafts portion of the event will include diya-making, where attendees can make their own candles. This part of the evening will also include lessons in raas, a type of dance that originated in India. The section is specifically geared toward entertaining younger participants.
Some of Carnegie Mellon’s premier dancing and singing groups will be making an appearance at the event as part of the live performance portion. Chak De, a bhangra dance group; Tufaan, another dance troupe; and Deewane, a South Asian all-male a capella group, will each showcase its talents throughout the celebration.
A second part of the evening’s performance portion will include prayers for both Diwali and Eid. MayurSASA members will present a short speech that will explain both of the events’ histories and what they represent to South Asian culture.
Diwali, the first religious celebration of the event, is an Indian festival also known as the “Festival of Lights.” Translated from Sanskrit, Diwali literally means “row of lamps.” The festival is celebrated differently throughout the world. The main focus of the festival is to rejoice in the “Inner Light,” or self. Furthermore, the event celebrates the triumph of good over evil.
The second religious celebration will center on Eid ul-Fitr. Usually abbreviated to Eid, this holiday marks the end of Ramadan, or the Muslim holy month of fasting. Eid, like Diwali, celebrates a blessed period of forgiveness. The holiday is also celebrated on a global scale.
Shilpa Balaji, a junior computer science major, appreciated that MayurSASA wanted to celebrate the religious holidays, but was skeptical of how pious the events might actually be. 
“It’s great that clubs are trying to offer outlets for religious individuals. But, just as in every religious community, there is a risk of insincerity,” she said. “If organizations are going to put themselves forward with intentions of upholding religious beliefs, the members of the organizations should be aware of how their actions in the college community relate to their actions in their cultural and religious organization.”
An Udupi buffet will also be a part of the evening’s events. This type of food gets its name from Udupi, a town on the southwest coast of India. The food traditionally includes dishes made from beans, grains, vegetables, and fruits; Udupi is vegetarian-friendly. The buffet will cost $10, and tickets will be available for purchase during the week.
Since this event is a combination of two celebrations, MayurSASA members wanted to ensure that there would be educational opportunities for participants about the history and meaning of the two festivals. MayurSASA President Anisha Vyas, a junior biomedical and mechanical engineering dual major, said that his organization will be displaying facts about both festivals on the Cut throughout the week. This way even students who cannot attend the celebrations can still learn about both events.
