The Carnegie Mellon men’s basketball team had a successful weekend of University Athletic Association (UAA) conference play, coming away with victories over Case Western Reserve University on Friday and Emory University on Sunday at home in Skibo Gymnasium.
On Friday, the Tartans put on a show for the home crowd of over 1000 fans with an 81–60 victory over the Case Western Reserve University Spartans. The Tartans came out ready to avenge last week’s loss at the Spartans’ home gymnasium. Last week, the Tartans hit a dry spell and only shot 37.5 percent from the field, missing seven shots in a row in the first half. However, this week, Carnegie Mellon could not miss and finished the game shooting 53.4 percent from the field and 56.3 percent from the three-point line.
The Tartans came out hot and hit eight three-pointers in just the first half. Senior guard Ryan Einwag was three for three from the arc in the first half, while junior guard Jack Anderson hit three of five; the two ended the half with 13 and 11 points, respectively. Anderson made four shots in a row to put the Tartans ahead, 27–8, with 8:43 remaining in the half. The Spartans battled throughout the first half but could not come within 10 of the Tartans. At the break, the Tartans led 42–31.
The Tartans did not cool down at all during the break, and while the Spartans continued to battle, they could not cut the deficit to less than nine. The Tartans took a 24-point lead after master’s student Jon Wolleben dropped in a layup off an assist from senior Corey O’Rourke.
Friday’s victory was a clear team effort with multiple players recording a career high in points. O’Rourke finished the game with 11 assists, Einwag tallied 19 points, and Anderson added 15. Sophomore Matt Pettit and first-year John Durhing recorded career highs of 10 and 11 points, respectively.
While the Tartans were not as consistent in their shooting on Sunday, they were able to put the numbers up on the scoreboard to come away with a win over the Emory Eagles. Anderson scored the first points of the game, converting a three-point play after an Emory foul. Fouls seemed to be the demise for the Eagles as the Tartans were in double bonus with 7:06 still to play in the half. The Eagles could not settle into their defensive play the rest of the half and sent the Tartans to the line 14 times in the first half alone. The Eagles capped off their fouls with a personal foul followed by a technical foul, on Emory’s coach, with 4:51 remaining in the half. Einwag was the shooter for both fouls and made three of four, extending the lead to 17.
The second half was similar to the first, and with 14:00 to play, the Tartans were already in bonus shots. With 8:45 remaining in the half, the Tartans caught fire and sank three three-pointers in a row with shots from Durhing, Einwag, and Anderson. With 4:28 remaining, the Tartans took their biggest lead of the game, 86–55. The Eagles could not rally and the game ended 88–61.
The Tartans continue UAA play next weekend versus Brandeis University and New York University at Skibo Gymnasium, with game times set for 8 p.m. Friday and noon Sunday.
Training for the Murphy Cup begins in Philadelphia in March.

The Carnegie Mellon swimmers stayed local this weekend as they visited the University of Pittsburgh to compete against a range of teams in Pitt’s annual Senior Recognition meet. Both the men’s and women’s teams competed against the University of Pittsburgh and Clarion University, with Slippery Rock and California University of Pennsylvania competing in the women’s division as well.
Sophomore Colleen Grogan swam and placed in two events. In the 100-yard freestyle, Grogan recorded a personal best time of 57.26, and in the 200-yard freestyle, she posted another personal best of 2:03.20. 
Sophomore Molly Evans was strong for the Tartans, finishing second in the 200-yard backstroke with a time of 2:06.92. 
Three Tartans placed in the 100-yard backstroke, with Evans taking third with a time of 59.35, followed by teammates first-year Allyson Koyen and junior Christine Anderson, who finished eighth and 10th, respectively. Koyen also competed and placed fifth in the 100-yard butterfly with a best time of 1:02.12, while Anderson took seventh in the 200-yard backstroke with a best time of 2:21.96.
Grogan commented on the outcome of the meet: “The meet went really well and we competed really well. The majority of us ran really fast times, which was really great.” The Tartans had no trouble being a Division III team competing against teams from Division I and II. 
“We’re not intimidated by Division I,” Grogan said. “The teams there were fast; however, we’re used to swimming against pretty fast teams. We usually swim against [Division I] teams and it’s good. We swim against them because it makes a better race for us.”
On the men’s side, first-years Ryan Pearl and Alex Ziev both claimed second-place finishes, the highest any Tartan would place at the event. Pearl competed in the 50-yard freestyle with a best time of 21.34, and Ziev finished the 200-yard breaststroke with a time of 2:13.40.
Senior Stephen Vu, junior Andrew Weitz and sophomore Josh Plotnik all posted fourth-place finishes. Vu swam the 200-yard butterfly with a time of 2:02.66, and Weitz finished the 200-yard freestyle in 1:46.26. Plotnik completed the 100-yard breaststroke in 1:00.51 and also placed fifth in the 200-yard IM with a time of 2:04.40. 
Weitz also time-trialed the 400-yard IM with an NCAA provisional qualifying time of 4:07.49.
First-years Michael Rong and Aaron Snook finished third and fourth in the 1000-yard freestyles with times of 10:20.94 and 10:21.85, respectively.
The Tartans will head to the University Athletic Association (UAA) championship meet later this week, held at the University of Chicago with a competition Feb. 12–14.

Last Sunday, the Carnegie Mellon men’s tennis team kicked off its spring season with a 7–2 win over Mercyhurst College. The Tartans showed a strong presence, particularly in the bottom half of the lineup, in which every match was won in straight sets. After this win, the Tartans brought their overall record to 4–1.
At first singles, sophomore Alex Nemerov lost in a close battle 7–5, 6–7 (11–9). Second singles junior James Muliawan easily defeated his opponent 6–3, 6–1, followed by a win by sophomore Bobby MacTaggart 6–3, 6–2. Junior Jonathan Spero steamrolled his opponent at fourth singles with an easy 6–1, 6–2 victory.
Senior Yiran Liu had a bit more difficulty with his match, but won 6–4, 6–3. “I realized I can’t hit hard in matches. I can only grind,” Lui said. “He kept passing me, and that was so annoying.” Pulling in the last singles win was first-year Jeremy King, with a quick win over his opponent, 6–2, 6–2. With the exception of second doubles, the Tartans showed a strong finish by giving up only two games in the remaining two matches. The first doubles duo of Nemerov and junior Ravi Raghavan quickly closed out their opponents 8–2. The second doubles team of Spero and Muliawan got off to a slow start and found themselves down 4–7. The two held serve and broke twice to come back 7–8, but were unable to maintain the momentum and lost in a tiebreak 8–9 (4). However, the last doubles team of junior Nikola Ljuboja and MacTaggart wiped out their opponents 8–0.
“This was a good way to start the season against the top team, and we’re going to work on our doubles a lot the next two weeks,” Spero said. “We have another month until our first big Division III match, so we have a lot of work to do both on and off the court.”
“Carnegie Mellon tennis is freaking awesome,” added sophomore Kelly Hart from the women’s tennis team.
The men’s team has a week off until their next weekend in action, when they play host to Robert Morris University and Case Western Reserve University Feb. 21–22.

Last weekend was a doubleheader for the Carnegie Mellon women’s basketball team as they took on two University Athletic Association (UAA) conference teams: the Case Western Reserve University Spartans on Friday and the Emory University Eagles on Sunday. The Tartans fell to both teams at Skibo Gymnasium, posting 66–54 and 80–65 final scores against the Spartans and Eagles, respectively. The losses dropped the team’s record to 5–15 overall and 0–9 in the UAA.
Early on in Friday’s game, first-year Jacki Cortese sank two layups to bring the team to a 9–4 edge, which later helped put the team 15–14 midway through the half. From the baseline, senior guard Corey Innes hit a three-pointer and junior Paige Williamson scored on a put-back. Eventually, Case Western Reserve started to rally and gained the lead with 31–21, with Spartans first-year Erin Hollinger hitting the basket with only 1:48 left in the period.
Fighting hard, the Tartans closed the gap to six points to end the period with a three-pointer by senior guard Stacie Aleski and a layin by first-year guard Ali Aunkst, which took the score to 32–26 in favor of Case Western Reserve.
The second period commenced with a 10–4 run, but the Tartans put up a 13–4 run to contest and come up right behind the Eagles with a score of 45–43 and only 10:47 on the clock. Within three minutes, both Aleski and Williamson managed to hit the basket before Case Western Reserve regained possession and Spartan Ashleigh Tondo took a three-pointer.
In the last 10 minutes, the Spartans added 21 points to their score, which gave them a 16-point lead and ended the game at 66–54.
Cortese led the Tartans with 13 points, and Aleski and senior forward Rachelle Roll each brought in eight points.
Friday’s disappointment carried over to Sunday’s game against Emory, when the Tartans fell by a margin of 15 points to the Eagles. Emory gained an early lead, surpassing the Tartans 27–10 in the first period, but a senior effort from Roll and Aleski cut the deficit to four. Aleski sank two back-to-back layups off an offensive rebound, and Roll recorded a steal. Cortese finished the 18–5 streak with a layup, followed by classmate Mia White, who contributed to the play from off the bench to sink a three-pointer and cause a turnover that led to a three-pointer from Aleski. Despite a solid team effort and 15 points from Aleski, the Tartans could not overcome the Eagle edge and trailed 41–34 before the break.
Hope was rekindled when Cortese put away eight straight points on the board for Carnegie Mellon to bring the Tartans within three points of the Eagles at the 16:50 mark. Unfortunately, that small deficit did not remain for long, as Emory went on a 9–0 run. Not too long after, Carnegie Mellon responded with a layup from Roll and converted foul throws from Cortese and Aleski. The Tartans’ answer was unable to revive the game, and the Eagles ended up concluding the game with a 22–14 run.
Cortese led the Tartans with 22 points, grabbing 10 rebounds for her fourth double-double on the season. Aleski recorded a season-high 19 points yesterday.
The Tartans will host Brandeis University Friday at 6 p.m. and Emory University Sunday at 2 p.m. in Skibo Gymnasium.

Last Friday, the Carnegie Mellon track and field men’s and women’s teams continued their indoor season by participating in the Slippery Rock Invitational. The unscored meet provided an opportunity for several new members to face some stiff competition.
The men’s team showed several promising performances across the board. Senior James Hulley led the team with a second-place finish in the shot put with 15.22 meters. First-year Alex Hernandez threw for 14.75 meters to take fifth in the weight throws.
Senior Joel Palko had one of his better performances, taking third in the triple jump (6.08 meters) and eighth in the long jump (12.57 meters). The Tartans dominated the 1609-meter run, led by sophomore John Briggulio, who took fourth with a time of 4:50.27. Behind Briggulio, junior Josh Finkle and sophomore Erik Kallenbach finished sixth (4:51.26) and seventh (4:53.16), respectively.
In the 200-meter dash, sophomore Casey Piper finished fifth with a time of 24.21. Junior Dan Burrows and sophomore Jonathan Matusky placed fifth (2:03.23) and ninth (2:08.83) in the 800-meter run, respectively. Sophomore Patrick O’Brien had a solid performance, taking sixth in the 55-meter hurdles.
On the women’s side, first-year Ivana Moses continued to shine, taking second in the triple jump with 10.64 meters. First-year Marie Doyle placed fourth and set a school record in the pole vault with 11.19 meters.
In the 200-meter dash, senior Sami Simmons led the team with an eighth-place finish with a time of 28.92. Sophomore Courtney Baker took second in the 800-meter run with a time of 2:27.20. Senior Emily Giacomarra took seventh in the 55-meter hurdles with a time of 9.75.
Senior Chrissy Krutz finished sixth in the 3000-meter run with a personal best time of 11:43.86. Behind Krutz, sophomore Danielle Morse finished ninth with a time of 12:08.11. In the weight throws, sophomore Morgan Faer threw for 11.19 meters to take ninth overall.
“It’s a little early to tell how this team compares with last year’s, but it seems that this year’s team has better chemistry and is willing to put in the work to defend our outdoor conference championship,” said sophomore Dan Melamed.
The track and field teams will resume their schedule this upcoming Saturday at Bucknell University.

The eighth-ranked Carnegie Mellon women’s tennis team kicked off the spring season with a bang on Saturday, hosting Slippery Rock University and Penn State Behrend to defeat both opponents by a score of 9–0. The team then hit the road Sunday to shut out Mercyhurst as well, 9–0. After the three shutouts, the Tartans have now won all four of their dual matches in the 2008–09 season, all of them by 9–0 scores.
Playing on the Oxford North Athletic Club courts on Saturday, the Tartans wasted no time in setting a winning tone. Sophomore Ashley Herrick and first-year Laura Chen began doubles by defeating Slippery Rock’s Kayla Blackburn and Laura Handy 8–6. They were followed by two more sophomore/first-year duos, with Kelly Hart and Amanda Wu winning 8–3 and Jennifer Chui and Courtney Chin winning their match 8–1.
The momentum from the doubles dominance carried right over to the singles matches, in which the women did not drop a single set. Chen defeated Blackburn 6–3, 6–0, followed by Wu, who defeated Handy 6–4, 6–3. Chin then dominated Slippery Rock’s Jessi Hilborn 6–1, 6–0, while Chui won her sets 6–1, 6–3. First-year Cze-Ja Tam and junior Alisa Liebowitz closed out the matches and the shutout, winning 6–4, 6–0 and 6–1, 6–0, respectively.
“We have a young team, so it’s great for us to get some dual-match experience in before our big event later this month, the ITA National Indoor Championships,” said coach Andrew Girard. “We’ve been experimenting with some different doubles combinations and I think we found some that worked well.”
The overpowering continued in the Behrend matches, as the Tartans never lost more than two games in a set. The doubles began with the Herrick/Chen duo defeating Karen Hobaugh and Hilary Lasher 8–1 before Hart and Wu shut out their opponents 8–0. Chin and Tam then won their match 8–1, while Chui and Liebowitz won an exhibition match 8–2.
Shutouts were the theme of the singles matches against Behrend, as each Tartan registered at least one in each of their matches. The six women dropped only five games total, with Wu and Chui both winning their matches 6–0, 6–0 and Chin, Calvert, and Tam all winning 6–0, 6–1. Liebowitz won her match by scores of 6–2 and 6–0 to secure the 9–0 victory.
At Mercyhurst on Sunday, the Tartans once more started off with a bang, with the doubles teams of Chen and Herrick, Chin and Hart, and Chui and Tam sweeping the doubles matches 8–0, 8–1 and 8–0, respectively. Chen then defeated the Lakers’ Kim Ezzo 6–2, 6–3, carrying the momentum from the doubles victories and setting the pace once more for the Tartans to sweep the singles matches. Liebowitz had an especially impressive showing, winning against Kelton Macke 6–0, 6–0.
“The entire team played amazing yesterday and we did not lose a single match, doubles or singles, against both universities,” said Wu of the two victories on Saturday. “We blew away SRU and PSU Behrend, and I know we have the talent to go far — maybe even win UAA championships. Emory will be our goal. NCAA championships will be a challenge, but I know we can definitely make it if we work hard.”
Girard shared her sentiments. “Our doubles played very great, and everyone is looking sharper each match we play,” he said. “Considering that we’ve only been practicing for a week, I thought everyone looked pretty sharp. If we keep playing up to our potential, we will be tough to beat.”
The Tartans next hit the court Feb. 22 at home on the campus courts against Robert Morris University.

Carnegie Mellon rowing hosted the Heart Attack Erg Race in Wiegand Gymnasium last Saturday, with the University of Pittsburgh, Duquesne University, and John Caroll University in attendance. Pitt victoriously took the race with a total of 98 points. Carnegie Mellon followed behind with 78 points, and Duquesne (18) and JCU (10) took third and fourth, respectively. Carnegie Mellon tied Pitt in four first-place finishes, with much success from the novices who competed in their first collegiate erg race. First-year novice Grant Wilson placed first in the men’s event.
“We’ve got a lot of new potential on this team. Many of our heavyweight and lightweight rowers set personal records and collectively earned a boatload of medals,” said men’s varsity captain and sophomore Justin Perry. “Our team wrecked the competition, winning first place in men’s and women’s lightweight varsity, open weight varsity women’s, and novice men’s categories.”
Concluding the day’s events with several notable wins, Carnegie Mellon varsity led the lightweight events, with first- and second-place finishes from seniors Danielle Millett and Natalie Weir in the women’s division, and Perry and men’s novice captain and sophomore Jonah Coste in the men’s.
With finishes only 0.7 seconds apart, the tight race between Perry and Coste proved to be memorable as the two Tartans competed for the top spot: “Jonah and I were neck and neck the whole way. He really made me work for it, and we both set personal records by pushing off each other,” Perry said.
Juniors Megan Larcom and Alyssa Fogel also went one-two to dominate the open women’s event. Carnegie Mellon did not have an open men’s team compete in the event.
Coste commented on the weekend’s success: “I’m pleased with our performance as a team, especially with the novice men — it gives meaning to all the effort we put in and keeps us motivated to work harder.”
The crew team will spend spring break in training for the Murphy Cup in Philadelphia on March 28.

Last swim season, sophomore Brianne Burton had a notable rookie entrance with the Tartans. Achieving All-University Athletic Association (UAA) honors in the 200- and 400-yard freestyle relay events and making it to competition at the UAA championships, Burton proves to be a promising contender for future success with the swimming program at Carnegie Mellon. Burton took some time to chat with The Tartan about some of her personal favorites and her collegiate life so far, with hopes of continuing to make a splash at this year’s UAA championship meet right around the corner.
Tartan: Was being a part of the swimming and diving team a factor in your decision to come to Carnegie Mellon? Why? 
Burton: Yes. I knew that I wanted to swim no matter where I went, and when I came to visit Carnegie Mellon I really liked the swimmers that I met. They were a lot more welcoming than teams at the other schools I visited.
T: Where would you like your degree in materials science and engineering to take you for a career? 
B: At this point, I want to go into industry for biomaterials or tissue engineering. But I’ll find out how I like that when I do research this summer.
T: What dorm did you live in your first year at Carnegie Mellon? What did you like most about living there? 
B: I lived in New House [now called Stever House] on the third floor. I couldn’t have been happier anywhere else. Even though the rooms are small, it’s definitely the best place to live, especially if you are lucky enough to have awesome floormates like I did. I have my own house now, but I still miss being right down the hall from all of my friends.
T: What is your favorite item of clothing that you have in your wardrobe? 
B: My big blue sweater. First of all, my grandma knit it for me. Also, it’s the warmest thing I have so I have worn it a lot this winter.
T: Do you have any pets? What are they and what are their names? 
B: I have a dog at home named Chase. In the spring, my roommates and I are getting a turtle. We haven’t decided what to name it yet, but some possibilities include Leonardo, Michelangelo, Donatello, or Raphael. I’m pulling for Raphael.
T: What is your favorite thing to eat after a long day at a swim meet? 
B: Usually pasta because I am too tired to make anything else.
T: Have you had any professors or classes that have had a certain impact on you so far? 
B: I actually came here as a bio major, but I liked my Intro to Biomedical Engineering course so much that I decided to switch into CIT.
T: Any thoughts on the Super Bowl or its aftermath? 
B: Best riot ever.
The Tartans swimming and diving teams take to the pool this upcoming weekend for this year’s UAA championships.

Energy economist Peter Tertzakian gave the keynote speech for “Focus the Nation,” a three-day conference aiming to increase public awareness of global climate change and to discuss solutions at the individual and societal levels.
By Tertzakian’s ken, the first step in managing energy usage is to get a grasp of how much of which fuels are being used to light, heat, and move everyone, what he calls the energy mix. A Thousand Barrels a Second, the title of his book published in 2006, is by his estimation the rate at which the world consumes crude oil. Tertzakian’s thesis: the transparent access to cheap, clean energy, what he calls the American “energy birthright,” is eroding. We cannot maintain both it and our current levels of consumption. 
Tertzakian cited the rising, volatile crude oil prices as evidence that the market is struggling to satisfy consumers, who require vast amounts of oil, and oil suppliers, for whom it is becoming increasingly difficult and expensive to find light sweet crude oil, the most desirable grade of oil and the cornerstone of our access to cheap and relatively clean energy. 
Why is this a problem if there are already so many large oil wells? When a well is first drilled, it produces at full capacity. As time passes, the well produces less and less — if in 10 years, the well is producing at half capacity, then in another 10 years, it will be producing at one quarter capacity. “Maturation,” as it is called, means that in order to maintain production levels, new oil wells need to be found. 
The fleet of vehicles on the roads depends on gasoline and diesel, and the roads themselves are made of asphalt, another oil product. The internal combustion of the engine is inefficient. After the conversion from chemical to mechanical energy, including losses to friction and heat in the engine proper and in the drivetrain, the total amount of energy powering the wheels is less than 20 percent of the energy that the fuels could provide. 
The oil shocks of the late 1970s drove innovations in automobiles, such as the use of plastics and fuel injection technology. But with time, people eroded into their gains by moving out to suburbia, making their commutes longer, and by developing a mania for larger, heavier vehicles. Economists call this “the rebound effect,” when people start eating into their savings.
Tertzakian believes that it is not too late to benefit from the savings that engineers have wrung from various products. He gave the example of the incandescent light bulb — a filament held in vacuum, which emits light when current is passed through. Any incandescent operates at around 2 percent efficiency with respect to the electrical power coming in on the line. This represents a great waste, but on the other hand, this is an opportunity for energy savings.
The simplest solution to this is to turn off the lights. For every unit of energy that one does not use for illumination, one saves 50 units of source energy. Tertzakian called this “the potential for impact on the total energy need.” Hence, by being savvy consumers, people can collectively lessen the amount of fossil fuel that needs to be found, drilled, transported, and refined — using the leverage that is available to them. “The real frontline in the battle for reducing energy dependency ... is with the individual member of society,” Tertzakian says in his book. The idea then, is not to generate more energy. It’s about how not to use energy. But using less energy means that people are less mobile, a little warmer in the summer, and a little colder in the winter. The question that arises is whether anyone would want to scale back their standard of living. 
Tertzakian believes “there are two things that speak louder to people than their wallets: a cry to rally around the flag for the good of the nation and social peer pressure.” He also said, “If we don’t make those [energy] choices consciously, other choices will be imposed on us by economics, government, or both.” 
During the last world war, patriots on the home front planted victory gardens. There might soon be the need for a victory lights-out — Tertzakian noted that apart from the 1970s oil shocks, the only time that oil consumption has decreased was due to home front rationing during World War II. 
Tertzakian believes that the magic bullets of the near future will be social technologies that change the way energy is used. Telepresence appeals to Tertzakian, because it allows face-to-face meetings between people sitting anywhere on the globe. In terms of energy, telepresence is a huge saver, mitigating the need for the standard American hour-long commute or the transatlantic business trip. Tertzakian summarized where we are in the United States today. 
Although oil prices have slowly dropped from their $100-a-barrel spot price that was experienced in the summer, prices remain historically high and volatile. He stressed that “how nations respond to the coming break point will necessarily go beyond the forces of mere markets and businessmen.” We must as individuals come to terms with the realities of a post-energy birthright world.

The mind is a powerful tool, especially when it comes to vision and perception. However, no matter how incredible the visual system is, it is bound to make some mistakes. These mistakes often take place in the form of optical illusions. 
There are several types of optical illusions, including physiological illusions (effects on the eye or brain due to excessive stimulation of brightness, movement, or color) and cognitive illusions (the brain uses unconscious inferences or rules to help resolve ambiguities in the world).
One of the most renowned physiological illusions is the lateral inhibition illusion. This type of illusion is best illustrated by two gray colored squares, one surrounded by a white square (square 1) and one by a black square (square 2). 
The gray square surrounded by the white one seems to be a darker color than the one surrounded by the black square even though they are actually the same color. 
This is because the signals from the edge of square 1 show decreasing light intensity as the eye moves inward from the white into the gray square.
Signals from square 2 show an increase in light intensity as the eye looks inward from the black to gray square. Hence, gray square 1 surrounded by the white square seems to be darker than the other gray square surrounded by the black square.
In cognitive illusions, the brain perceives images to be different from what they really are. Sometimes such illusions occur when the brain is trying to fill in the blanks in the visual field, as it does not like to have empty holes in vision. 
This is especially seen in Kanizsa’s triangle illusion, where there is a white space surrounded by three circles that have the edges of a triangle cut into them. Between the circles lie the corners of an equilateral triangle. Because the brain doesn’t like having the void in this image, it automatically fills in the white space with the image of a triangle. Hence, the viewer perceives the image as consisting of two triangles, instead of just one, broken triangle. 
One of the most prominent pieces of evidence that the brain loves to fill in the holes in the visual world comes from the existence of a blind spot in the eye. The blind spot in the eye is the area on the retina where there are no photoreceptors — the cells that detect light and transform it into electrochemical information. 
At the blind spot, the optic nerve, which sends the information from the retina to the brain, connects with the retina, resulting in a lack of photoreceptors at this spot. A lack of photoreceptors means a lack of vision, but people do not live their lives seeing a blank spot out in the visual world.
The brain is very good at using surrounding information to fill in images for the blind spot where there is no vision, hence one always sees a uniform, detailed world. 
The presence of the blind spot can be proved by using a few simple tricks. The most common of these is to draw two dots on a piece of paper about two inches apart. On closing one eye and focusing the other on one of the dots, the other dot will appear to disppear at some point when the paper is moved backward and forward. 
At this particular point, the image of the second dot falls on the blind spot of the eye causing the eye to “be blind” to the image of the dot.
Other optical illusions play with the monocular cues — cues given by one eye — of depth perception in an image. For example, when looking at a picture of a robot in a hallway, the robot looks normal sized toward the back of the picture (and hallway). The same robot, however, looks very small when placed in the front of the hallway. The two pictures of the robots are actually the same size. 
Since people perceive the end of hallways as being smaller and farther away, the robot looks normal sized there. When the same-sized robot was placed in the front of the hallway, which is perceived as closer and larger by the viewer, the robot looks much smaller than its counterpart in the back. Similarly, if a very small image of the robot is placed at the back of the hallway and a normal- sized image is placed at the front, both the images appear to be of the same size. This illusion also occurs because of the same principle. The image at the end of the hallway appears larger than it actually is because the ends of hallways are perceived to be smaller than the fron of hallways.
Another type of optical illusion is called a 3-D stereogram, which creates the illusion of depth from a two-dimensional image. One of the most common types of stereograms is the autostereogram, which hides a 3-D scene in a picture that seems like a jumbled mess of repeating figures or dots. However, this optical illusion of depth is only seen when using the proper techniques, called diverging (wall-eyed) or converging (cross-eyed). 
In order to see the 3-D picture hidden behind the image, the eyes have to view the picture at angles different from normal. In wall-eyed viewing, each eye has to move slightly away from the central body axis, and in cross-eyed viewing, each moves toward the central axis. Since the eyes do not normally orient in this way, this causes the brain to believe that a second image lies behind the one being viewed. Because of the different angles of the eyes relative to each other, people are able to see images ranging from sharks to snowmen, depending on the type of autostereogram.

Have a crush on the girl who plays the violin or the guy with the perfect smile? Yes, Valentine’s Day is coming soon, and love is in the air. Love, just like most other reactions in the body, is strongly based on the miraculous processes in our body. With a cocktail of chemicals, the brain entices one to fall in love.
There are three stages of love: lust, attraction, and attachment. Each stage is driven by a set of different hormones and chemicals. Lust, the first stage of love, is driven by the sex hormones testosterone and estrogen. From puberty onward, the amount of testosterone and estrogen released increases immensely. The testosterone level in a teenage boy’s body is the same level as an adult’s after drinking four to five shots of strong liquor. The feeling of lust is caused by the body’s production of testosterone and estrogen, which peaks from puberty onward.
The next stage of love is attraction, when one can focus on little or nothing else other than the person he or she is attracted to. This stage is a result of a process under three neurotransmitters: dopamine, norepinephrine and serotonin. Norepinephrine is similar to adrenaline, which causes effects like a racing heart, sweaty palms, and flushed skin. Sound familiar? Yes, this is what happens when a person unexpectedly bumps into his or her new crush. Besides norepinephrine, dopamine plays an important role in the attraction stage. Dopamine is thought to be the pleasure chemical that produces the feeling of bliss. Researchers have used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to observe people’s brains when they are looking at a picture of their object of affection. The scans showed increased blood flow in areas concentrated with dopamine receptors, which are associated with states of euphoria, craving, and addiction.
Together, the combination of norepinephrine with dopamine produces elation, intense energy, sleeplessness, loss of attention, and exquisite delight from small details. 
In addition, men experience more of these feelings of love than women. Helen Fish, an anthropologist and well-known love researcher from Rutgers University, stated in her book The Nature of Love that “The human body releases the love rapture only when certain conditions are met and ... men more readily produce it than women, because of their more visual nature.” 
Lastly, serotonin is another factor at the attraction stage of love. Researchers at University College London found that people in love have lower levels of serotonin. Low levels of serotonin were also found in people diagnosed with obsessive-compulsive disorders, which is more than likely the reason why people in love are obsessed with their partners.
The third stage of love is attachment. This stage allows a couple to bond for a longer period of time. Two important chemicals that are responsible for this stage are oxytocin and vasopressin. According to researchers at University of California, San Francisco, the hormone oxytocin has been shown to be “associated with the ability to maintain healthy interpersonal relationships and healthy psychological boundaries with other people.” Vasopressin, an anti-diuretic hormone, is another chemical that has an effect on long-term relationships. 
It is believed that oxytocin and vasopressin interrupt the dopamine and norepinephrine pathways, which is a possible explanation of why passionate love fades as attachment grows within a couple.

Sony develops new biometric system
Sony has developed a security technology, called Mofiria, that uses infrared LEDs and a CMOS sensor to take a picture of one’s veins. 
Vein patterns vary from person to person and from finger to finger. A benefit of taking a picture of a person’s vein pattern is that it does not change throughout time.
Mofiria is compact in size because the biometric system uses a reflecting scattering light method. 
The Mofiria biometric system offers a quick response, high accuracy, and can be incorporated into small mobile devices like cell phones. Sony plans on rolling out the technology sometime within the year.

Scientists find oldest animal fossils
Fossils that were recently found in an oil field in the Arabian peninsula are now considered to be the oldest evidence of animal existence. The fossils found can confirm that animal life existed more than 635 million years ago. These fossils do not look like usual fossils, but are mere chemical traces of a compound.
However, the chemicals resemble those produced by the demosponge, which is considered to be the last common ancestor for all animals. 
The study was conducted by a team of researchers at the University of California, Riverside, and the findings were published in a recent edition of journal  Nature.

Colors decide performance in tasks
Researchers at the University of British Columbia have determined that people perform better at different tasks when viewing such colors as red or blue. In the study, conducted on 600 people, participants were shown questions either on a red background or on a blue background.
The results revealed that the red group did a better job recalling details, remembering words, and checking spelling and punctuation. The blue group did better with tests requiring imagination. 
Another study that indicates this color dependence was performed in 2004. 
In this study regarding Olympic uniforms during the 2004 Olympic Games, boxers and wrestlers wearing red defeated their opponents who were wearing blue 60 percent of the time.

Google creates new tracking system
Google has launched software to track users of mobile phones and other wireless devices. Google Latitude allows people to share their location with family and friends in 27 different countries. Users can select who receives the information and when they determine to go offline.
Google claims that since location data can be sensitive information, they have also included a number of privacy controls in the software. The whereabouts of a person can be tracked on  Google Maps using a computer or a phone that supports Google maps. Eventually, the device will be compatible with Apple’s iPhone and iPod Touch, as well as a number of Sony Ericsson devices.

Scientists develop cystic fibrosis cure
An attempt by researchers at the Department of Pediatrics at Heidelberg University Hospital to treat the most common genetic disease, cystic fibrosis, in living organisms has proven to be successful. 
The therapy directly attacks the root cause of the disease, which is the drying up of the mucous membrane, and involves the spraying of amiloride into the lungs. The therapy was successfully tested on young mice.
Mutations in a gene called the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator gene are responsible for the dehydration of the surfaces of the mucous membranes in the intestines, lungs, and other organs. Amiloride acts by inhibiting the sodium channels and preventing the drying up of these mucous membranes.

FDA approves drugs made in goats
A drug produced by genetically engineered animals was approved by the FDA for the first time. The drug is a human protein to prevent blood clots that has to be extracted from the milk of genetically engineered goats. The approval of this first drug also accompanies another major step — the approval of the goats that produce this drug.
This drug is manufactured by GTC Biopharmaceuticals. It was produced by a herd of 200 goats, which were carefully bred in a farm with controlled conditions in central Massachusetts.

Cancer prevalent near oil sand plants
More cancer cases than expected were found in a small village in Canada due to its proximity to large oil sand plants. Residents believe that oil sand developments may be responsible for bile duct cancer, a very rare type of cancer.
The complaints made by the residents led to a study conducted by Alberta health authorities. The study revealed that the village had 1400 cases of cancer, which was higher than the expected rate, but only two of the six reported patients were actually suffering from the rare cancer of the bile ducts, also called cholangiocarcinoma, while one had no cancer at all. However, it was also found that 47 individuals in the community suffered from 51 different cancers. This was far more than the 39 cases that were expected to be found.

Scientists grow neurons on chips
Researchers at Edinburgh University have discovered a new technique, which can help repair damaged tissue in the human body through the use of silicon chips. The technique involves the use of computer chips that allow neurons to grow in fine, detailed patterns on their surfaces.
In this technique, patterns are printed on the chip’s smooth silicon surface. Then the chip is dipped in a mixture of proteins. As a result of this, neurons that have grown on the surface of the chips along the patterns designed by the scientists are obtained.  It has been found that this technique can also work successfully with stem cells. It is believed that the technique can be used in the development of prosthetics.

Valentine’s Day: the very sound of it makes some people think dreamy thoughts about their significant others, yet for virtually every single person out there, it elicits feelings of sadness, anger, spite, and/or loneliness. But this article doesn’t aim to examine the proper gift-giving techniques or the most romantic ways to eat a salad. No, from this point on, this will be a history lesson, on the most interesting events to ever occur on Feb. 14, ordered in reverse order of importance. Get a glimpse of V-Day history through this article. 
Some events may specifically pertain to Valentine’s Day, while others won’t even a little, yet all are linked by their occurrence on the one day in the year on which it is acceptable for a guy to watch a sappy, romantic love story like Love Actually or P.S. I Love You. Just kidding!
Year – 1803 
Event – Chief Justice John Marshall declares that any act of the U.S. Congress that conflicts with the Constitution is void.
You must remember that these were times when things were much simpler. Things like torture and abortion didn’t exist yet, and the U.S. only went to war for good, solid reasons. Also, justices in those days were much more powerful and people actually listened to them.
My link back to Valentine’s Day?  
It’s just like when she tells you that if she catches you going to a strip club again, she’s out, but then you go anyway and hide your tracks by wiping off the glitter.
Year – 1989  
Event – The first of 24 satellites of the Global Positioning System (GPS) is put into orbit.
Developed by the U.S. Department of Defense, the GPS uses sophisticated technology to pinpoint the near-exact location of a GPS receiver at any point and at any time. And now that GPS devices can be made as small as a microchip, it’s possible someone could have hidden it in that muffin you’re eating right now and you would never know.
My link back to Valentine’s Day?  
Good news, he/she can track your whereabouts anywhere you are now! You’ll never be apart again. Ever. Not even a little.
Year – 1859  
Event – Oregon is admitted as the 33rd state.
Yep, Oregon is actually a state. It became one just one year before the Civil War broke out. In fact, Oregon has a long history of secessionist ideals with people in the area clamoring to make their own little utopia, with such names as Cascadia and Ecotopia bandied about at some point or another.
My link back to Valentine’s Day?  
You remember when you first met his/her parents and they said, “Welcome to the family!” And then they told you to sit in the corner for the rest of existence and never really talked to you again? Yeah, this is like that.
Year – 1009 
Event - First known mention of Lithuania in writing
Squeezed in between Poland and Russia, along with several other relatively unknown nations, Lithuania doesn’t always get much credit. Hardly anyone knows that it has one of the fastest-growing economies of the present day with only 2 percent of its citizens living below the poverty line and that it also holds the highest suicide and homicide rates in Europe.
My link back to Valentine’s Day?  
Isn’t this kind of like the first time you stared deeply into each others eyes and said, “I acknowledge your presence”?
Year – 270 
Event – The death of St. Valentine(s), marking Valentine’s Day.
Countless early Christian martyrs shared the name of Valentine. However, many of the early ones were not even linked to anything romantic. That staple of today’s Valentine’s Day began in 1382 with Geoffrey Chaucer.
My link back to Valentine’s Day?  
This is just like when you promise you’ll always be there for him/her, and that you’d give up everything you have just so they could be happy.  What, you were expecting a joke?

He’s Just Not That Into You, directed by Ken Kwapi, tells the story of a group of people — all connected in some way — looking for their own perfect romantic commitment. The majority of them have the same problem: they look for love in all the wrong places. The movie has a cast of A-list actors and keeps you laughing, but it does have some directional problems. This does not, however, take away from the fact that it still offers compelling and completely honest insight on the female desire to have everlasting love and commitment.
Kwapi’s film is based on a popular advice book of the same title written by Greg Behrendt and Liz Tuccillo. This self-help book was inspired by the hit television series Sex in the City. Though [He’s Just Not That Into You has some of the same qualities and situations that were seen on Sex in the City, the movie certainly holds its own.
The film begins with narrator Gigi (Ginnifer Goodwin), an emotional wreck who yearns to find love, on a first date with Conor (Kevin Connolly), a cute real estate agent. From Gigi’s perspective, the date seems to go pretty well, so Gigi spends the next week waiting for her phone to ring, but it never does.
Conor might not call Gigi, but he does call Anna (Scarlett Johansson), an aspiring singer who works as a yoga instructor. But things don’t end there: The thread of relationships gets more tangled as the other characters are introduced, and it is interesting to see how everything plays out. Obviously, all of these relationships have the potential of becoming quite confusing and overwhelming, but the screenwriter does a successful job of making each character incredibly distinguishable. Each possesses his or her own personality, but they also seem very realistic. These qualities create a significantly more relatable story, and allows the audience to identify with at least one of the characters.
As the film proceeds, a desperate and impatient Gigi impulsively goes to a bar that she knows Conor frequents, but he isn’t there. She meets Alex (Justin Long) instead, who is both Conor’s friend and the blatantly honest bar owner who provides insight into the male psyche. 
The friendship between Gigi and Alex ultimately becomes one of the main driving forces of the plot. As this is happening, all of the other characters deal with relationship issues of their own. There are moments in He’s Just Not That Into You that seem completely unnecessary. For example, toward the middle of the film, the audience is introduced to Beth’s (Jennifer Aniston) father (Kris Kristofferson), who seems to have been placed in the film to provide a quick way to get to the point. 
Unfortunately, this diversion breaks up the plot instead of moving it along. Also, every 30 minutes or so, the film awkwardly becomes a documentary. There are random people who begin to talk about a relationship issue in the film. Though these moments are funny, they are not really necessary to the forward movement of the film.
Although this movie does have its glitches, they don’t cause it to lose its flare. The characters have one main goal: to be someone’s exception to the rule. Leaving the theater, you might not remember all of the rules, but you will recall one: If a guy doesn’t call you or doesn’t ask you out, it means that he’s just not that into you.

Ah, friends and foes: it’s that time of the year again. 
A time for the kind of emotion that is not only heavily advertised but used to evoke other emotions: jealousy, depression, and literal insanity. Ah, love, advertised year-round. First, there are the black-and-white online dating service commercials, with people smiling, riding bikes, riding horses, and playing hockey. These beautiful images seem to serve as visual metaphors for what you could be doing with the significant other that you don’t have. There are inspirational television shows like Real Chance of Love and A Double Shot at Love, which demonstrate the true meaning of love: fierce competition with some other weaved-up trailer trash woman (or man, really) vying for the heart of your desired lover.
So why do we need a singular day in the year, in one of the coldest months in Pittsburgh, to utter those three words to that special someone-of-the-moment? Because Hallmark can make money from it. And the business of making money is sometimes scheming and underhanded — much like the love we so eagerly celebrate. All of this culminates on one day: Feb. 14. 
As children, Valentine’s Day was the time you’d have to go to CVS with your mother to get some of those paper Lisa Frank Valentines with some candy hearts inside of them to give to your classmates somewhere between multiplication tables and lunch. Let’s return to those simpler times. When you’re a kid, you think nothing of how your paper Valentine that you made especially for Benny applies to the larger scheme of the money-making machine. 
And then age becomes you and you notice that all of your money is going toward expressing your emotions through unoriginal bouquets of roses and stale chocolates to someone you’re trying to get or someone who you have decided on until someone better comes along. The florist, greeting card companies, Trojan — they all benefit from this holiday.
But it seems in context that all of this goes to waste. Why have a singular day in the year for just shallow gifts and hugs and kisses? What’s so different between Valentine’s Day and all the other days in the year? Yet even though people love each other every day, it is still very rare to find people who buy their significant other flowers or candies or bacon cheeseburgers for “no reason.” 
So we know that it’s a possibility that Valentine’s Day is kind of forced on people, and people go along with it because, come on — who doesn’t enjoy getting free gifts because someone else feels obliged to give you that very gift? It’s free, isn’t it?
But for some of us, V-Day smells more like a day of death and doom: D-Day. The dark and twisty set either regard Feb. 14 as a day of complete irrelevance and unnecessary behaviors, ignoring the Hallmark-inspired love surrounding them, or they consider this a day worth loathing. 
Ah, sweet bitterness — completely appropriate for the topic. It seems that the best way to show that loathing (for the 21+ set, mind you) is to drink up. Or if you’re underage, get some ideas from what The Tartan staff has to say in The Tartan Q&A.

If you still haven’t settled on “the” outfit for Valentine’s Day, put down that Victoria’s Secret catalog you’ve frantically been flipping through for ideas and take a walk through Shadyside’s Walnut Street. Besides being a quaint, romantic area perfect for a date, Walnut Street also offers impeccable shopping options for all times of year, and a stroll through the area will reveal stores just as eager to celebrate Feb. 14 as you are.
This year, designers embraced dramatic femininity, with many designers like Fendi, Ferragamo, and Malo infusing floral patterns and adding flower pins onto their clothing. In terms of color, designers like Alexander Wang, Valentino, and Balmain fearlessly used extremely bright ones, creating hot pink dresses and teal blazers. In reality, runway looks are hard to pull off for everyday, but with a reason to get dressed up approaching, this is the perfect opportunity to utilize the color palettes and patterns many designers have put out for spring. Thankfully, many of the stores in Shadyside have the latest spring arrivals with a variety of appreciated details that will definitely catch an eye on Valentine’s Day.
Once on Walnut Street, you’ll find many stores that carry endless arrays of dresses hitting all price points and have employees that are happy to help you find the right outfit. Start at “e.b. Pepper,” a boutique carrying endless contemporary designers like Robert Rodriguez, Black Halo, and Kooba, and you’ll find adorable dresses like a white Milly piece with velvet bow detailing. Across the street at “Maxalto,” a boutique carrying Betsey Johnson, Anna Sui, and D&G, many of the dresses are modern, but with a feminine twist, and in ultra-flattering silhouettes. A pink and white Betsey Johnson number stood out dramatically, with details like a lace bust and silk flowers to emphasize the waist.
A few doors down on Walnut Street is a chic boutique called “Choices,” which carries exclusive designers like Nina Ricci, Lanvin, Alaia, and Piazza Sempione, as well as a more affordable contemporary section with Diane von Furstenburg, Adam, and Tory Burch. The window displays an ideal Valentine’s Day dress, a fitted floral Nina Ricci piece with splashes of red, yellow, and white flowers. Inside the store, a wall of bags from designers like Mulberry, Chloe, and Givenchy greets the eye; a closer look reveals snake skin clutches, bright orange totes, and very structured top-handle purses. There are many one-of-a-kind pieces with luxe detailing, like another white Nina Ricci dress with a gothic-inspired necklace sewn right onto the neckline. It’s pieces like these that create and highlight contrast that are enviable and visually appealing, so if $2500 for a dress is out of your budget, there are still plenty of do-it-yourself ways to look great next weekend.
If you are still unsure about visiting Walnut Street, all of the stores mentioned are having sales with 30 to 75 percent off, so that designer dress you’re eyeing may be within your reach after all. Additionally, stores like Banana Republic and J.Crew are full of versatile and affordable pieces, so if you plan on wearing a ruffled blouse and pleated skirt, a bauble necklace and suede flats to see your Valentine, these stores are definite destinations. Affordable clutches and small purses can be found at GAP and Coach, with abundant spring colors and versatile shapes and textures. Whatever you wear on Feb. 14, the only requirement is that you feel comfortable and confident and have a great time with whomever is accompanying you.

For your date this Valentine’s Day, there are a number of great restaurant options available. Try Silk Elephant on Murray Avenue in Squirrel Hill for an elegant Thai dinner in silk-draped shade, or Girasole on Copeland Street in Shadyside for rustic, full-flavored Italian food. But even with all these great places to go to, there’s always the homely couch in your own living room for a cozy private dinner.
This V-Day, surprise your loved one with a home-cooked meal. Show off your inner culinary skill or your newly learned kitchen talent with a menu that could look something like this:
Appetizer: fresh mozzarella and tomato salad 
Main Course: broiled soy sauce and honey glazed salmon with jasmine rice and vegetables 
Dessert: mascarpone cheese with chocolate cookies and baked peach
Drink: Sparkling juice, or water or soda with lemon
This date can be modified in different ways, from changing the menu to altering the atmosphere. You can tell your date to dress nicely and have dinner on a table by the windows, or come in sweats to dine on the coffee table next to the couch. A few ways to make the ambience romantic and exciting are by baking cinnamon in the oven, as this makes the room smell great, or by lighting candles round the sofa; candlelight has a beautiful glow effect. Turn on some good jazz music, such as Madeleine Peyroux, Stan Getz, or Marin Taylor from Pandora, or get some ideas for what music to play from the article on page 14.
For your dinner menu, try to keep every dish as simple as possible. You want to have a proper date with quality time at the dinner table, not half of the time spent slaving away in the kitchen. In this particular menu, each dish is very easy to assemble and cook from scratch. The three courses are simple, elegant, and delicious without using any canned or boxed product.
As for the appetizer, keep it light and simple. You want to enjoy the dish, but an appetizer should not be too filling. Aside from fresh mozzarella and tomato salad, try substituting prosciutto and melon (from the Nov. 24, 2008 issue), baked brie with fresh apple and caramelized honey, or a simple salad with some fresh fruit and poached shrimp.
For the fresh mozzarella and tomato salad, you will need:
2 large fresh tomatoes 
2 fresh mozzarella balls, approximately 1 inch in diameter. Fresh mozzarella can be found in the cheese area and it is usually suspended in a water solution. It comes in various sizes. Aim for an equal amount of mozzarella and tomatoes. 
A pinch of salt 
A pinch of pepper, freshly ground if possible. 
3 tablespoons of extra virgin olive oil 
5–10 leaves of fresh basil
As with any other salad, this is a cut-up-and-put-them-together dish. Start by slicing the tomatoes and the fresh mozzarella crosswise so that they are a quarter-inch thick. On your serving plate, arrange the tomatoes, a leaf of basil and the mozzarella alternately on top of each other. You can arrange them so that tomatoes and fresh mozzarella overlap slightly, forming a line, or stacking them on top of each other. Drizzle the plate with olive oil and a pinch of salt and pepper. As a last touch, sprinkle some ripped basil leaves on top and serve immediately.
This salad can be prepared ahead of time by storing sliced-up fresh mozzarella and tomatoes in a covered container separately. Only assemble the salad before serving.
For the main course, fish is a really good option because of its soft and flaky meat texture. The great thing about fish is that you don’t need a steak knife to slice through it, nor do you have to swirl your fork through tangled pasta. Avoid fried food at all costs for a romantic at-home date because your room will smell like a cafeteria. Broiling, baking, and steaming are more forgiving to the atmosphere.
For the broiled soy sauce and honey-glazed salmon with jasmine rice and vegetables, you’ll need:
2 boneless salmon fillets, approximately ¼ lb each 
¼ cup of soy sauce. Fish sauce is not a substitute for this. 
1 tablespoon of honey. If you don’t have honey, golden syrup or brown sugar works as well. Only use white sugar as a last resort. 
1 tablespoon of finely chopped cilantro. 
1 teaspoon of sesame oil. This is not necessary, but sesame oil gives this dish an extra punch.
Make sure your rice is cooked ahead of time and keep it warm. You can pick any vegetables you want: Think broccoli, bok choy, carrots, or even mixed greens.
To prepare your salmon, mix together soy sauce, honey, cilantro, and sesame oil and pour it over your salmon fillet. Marinate the fillet in the refrigerator for at least 10 minutes and at most half an hour. Then, put the fish in the oven, set at 350ºF, for 5–7 minutes and in the broiler for another 3–4 minutes, depending on the size and shape of your fillet. 
The honey will help to caramelize the salmon fillets, and the sesame oil will help prevent the fish from drying. Be careful not to bake the fillet for too long, as the fish will continue cooking from the heat even after it is out of the oven.
There are several options to prepare your greens, from blanching them in hot water and drizzling them with melted butter or hoisin sauce to stir-frying the bok choy or broccoli with peanut oil and a pinch of salt.
Serve your fish on top of the rice with your choice of vegetables on the side. If you have spring onions, you can chop them up and sprinkle them on top of the fish.
For dessert, ordering a Valentine’s Day cupcake from Dozen’s bakeshop will make any girl smile. Or you can try a really easy dessert that is delicious.
For mascarpone cheese with chocolate cookies and baked peaches, you will need:
At least 4 oz. of mascarpone cheese. The amount of cheese is your preference. 
Your chocolate cookies should be at least 3 inches in diameter. 
A peach, an orange, or another fruit ranging from the freshest berries on the market on that day to a pomegranate. 
1 tablespoon of butter 
1–2 tablespoons of brown sugar
Run your knife lengthwise along the length of the peach all the way around the peach, then twist the two halves around the pit. This will cause half the peach to fall off. Place the peach on a baking sheet and cut it along the side, facing up. Butter the cut surface and sprinkle some brown sugar over your peach. Bake it in the oven at 350ºF for 40 minutes. If you have some ground cinnamon, sprinkle a pinch over each half before you put them in the oven.
To assemble this dessert, stir up the mascarpone cheese with a fork so that it is light and fluffy. If you choose fresh fruit instead of baked peach for this dessert, have your sweetheart help cutting the fruit and assemble the dessert together. Then, either in a fancy plate or just a cup, place a scoop of as much mascarpone cheese as you’d like with the baked peach on the side. As a last touch, smash up some cookies and sprinkle them over your cheese and baked peach.
While eating dessert, make things romantic by placing the cheese and peach on one plate and sharing with your Valentine.

It’s that time of year again. The shelves of Squirrel Hill’s chocolate shop, the Chocolate Moose, have been lined with dazzlingly edible designs, posters plastered all over campus hint at Crew’s upcoming rose sale on the Cut, and stores of every specialty have been stocking red and pink goods. Valentine’s Day is just around the corner, and already local businesses have been trying to put a heart-warming feel on their products. But just how do you find the right gift for your significant other or your sweetheart-to-be? The best option is to get something that you know that your valentine will enjoy. It doesn’t always have to be chocolate and flowers; sometimes going with a more exotic option can be fun for the both of you. What follows is a list of gifts to consider for jazzing up your Valentine’s Day celebrations.
For the chocoholic: Love it or not, the sweet cacao compound is a traditional part of Valentine’s Day. That doesn’t mean that you have to give it traditionally, though. The Chocolate Moose is the place to go for this one. If you and your valentine have a sweet tooth and are hungry for some adventure, try some jars of chocolate body paint and brushes that are available here, along with some chocolate lovers’ dice and more. If you’re just starting out in a relationship, then try a new twist on candy: chocolate-covered pretzels or a mix of confections.
For the classic romantic: Roses are also emblematic of the season. If you’re looking to spice things up, use the flowers as something other than a decoration meant for vases. The petals are a romantic and fun way to make a scavenger hunt of sorts for your sweetheart to follow to reach your gift. Or choose a way to give your roses that’s not so conventional. For example, if you know that your boyfriend works long hours at his desk, talk with his roommate and arrange to have the flowers placed there before he wakes up. Got a girlfriend who loves to read? Stick a rose in one of her books as a bookmark.
For the musician: If your partner in crime loves music, whether it’s being able to identify all the songs on the radio at Skibo Coffeehouse or playing guitar in spare time, give him or her something that complements his or her tastes as well as reminds him or her of you. A mixtape is a fun, retro way of showing your feelings and giving your significant other something new for their MP3 player. Choose songs that the both of you have found special meaning in. 
For the city explorer: Going out and going places is a great way to spend Valentine’s Day. Instead of going to the movies and checking out the chick flicks, go some place you haven’t been to in a while. Chill out in a café in the South Side or check out the newly renovated Dozen Bake Shop in Squirrel Hill. Take a bus somewhere you and your sweetheart have never been before and then have fun laughing and navigating your way back. You’ll find some neat shops and locales when you let yourself wander.
For the environmentally friendly: Initially, giving potted plants might seem the only thing to come to mind, but there’s a lot more than that available in Pittsburgh. While gardening is great, you can find sustainable gifts at Equita, a local retailer that specializes in ethical, green, and socially responsible gifts. Equita carries perfume made from pure flowers without chemicals added, handmade jewelry from artisans in Bali and Ecuador, and organic clothing that’s sweatshop-free.
For the glamorous and charismatic: Everyone can tell when this kind of person walks in a room. For girls, it seems like the only way to go is high-end jewelry, but you don’t need to go that far to give a gift that impresses. Try Michele Baratta Jewelry, which has a variety of earrings and necklaces available under $50. The shop’s specialty is a picture frame necklace, in which you can arrange to have a picture of you and your significant other placed. It’s sweet, and it lets your partner have a picture of you with them to look at all day long.
For the whimsical and dreamy: Dating someone with a great imagination, or someone who just likes to spend free time dreaming up stories? These people like to be surprised, so going with just roses or chocolate might strike them as a little too mainstream. Try getting people like them something new and quirky, like Momiji dolls. Momiji are small Japan-inspired dolls that have a message slip tucked into them that you can write a love note on. Or, try a piece from Airy Fairy Jewelry, a shop that bases its creative and cute designs on fairy lore and legend. All jewelry is handmade and each item has a story that goes along with it
The Chocolate Moose is located at 5830 Forbes Avenue in Squirrel Hill. Dozen Bake Shop can be found at 1707 Murray Avenue, near the intersection of Forbes in Squirrel Hill. Equita is located at 3609 Butler Street. Michele Baratta Jewelry can be found online at www.michelebaratta.com. The Momiji Shop can be found online at lovemomiji.com. Airy Fairy Jewelry is located at airyfairyjewelry.etsy.com.

It has long been a Valentine’s Day staple that people crushing steadfastly in the shadows (or just in the seat a few rows back) see the opportunity of romance on Feb. 14 and make their move. However, depending on how well these moves are made, the results can either be great or outright laughable. Make the right decisions by checking out these tips.
1. Plan ahead. Everyone loves spontaneity, but sometimes, it’s honestly better to be prepared. Practice how you want to introduce yourself, either with a friend (whose teasing you don’t mind or who you know won’t tease you too badly) or in front of a mirror. It helps not to make your proposition for coffee sound like you’re trying to interview for something; don’t get too formal, but be nice. If you’re already acquainted with your crush, then make sure that what you have in mind is something that he or she will enjoy doing. You want to present your crush with something that interests him or her.
2. Look snappy. This doesn’t require coat and tails, but unless you’re pursuing a very laid-back person, you’ll want to look impressive for them, which means ditching the pajama pants and sweats. Guys, try for a nice pair of jeans and a polo or oxford shirt, tucked in or not as to your preference. Girls, a skirt or good jeans and a cute top are fine. You can go dressier if you’d like, but at least show the person you’re interested in how spiffy you can look when you put some effort into it.
3. Gift or no gift. When you’re asking out your crush on V-Day, there’s always the awkward question of whether to buy a gift. If you buy one and get turned down, you’re left with one lonely chocolate heart. Conversely, if you decide not to and then find yourself accepted, your date might be expecting something. What’s the solution? If you do decide to buy a gift, make sure it’s something that you’ll be okay with holding onto if you refused; e.g., if you’re buying chocolate, make sure it’s the same kind you like (unless your crush despises that variety) or you have a friend who’ll like it. If you skip the gift, be prepared to treat your crush when you go out. 
4. Make the right approach. Contrary to popular belief, cornering your sweetheart in the bowels of Doherty Hall between classes is probably not the best way to convince the person to go out with you. Ideally, talk to him or her when you’re in private and not rushed for time. If he or she is with friends, politely ask for a moment. Chances are, your crush will honor your request and be flattered that you were so considerate.
5. Ask confidently, but not with a big head. You don’t want to be the person confessing love to your crush’s feet. On the other hand, you don’t want to come across as thinking that you’re so great that the female and/or male populations of Carnegie Mellon can hardly restrain themselves from fawning over you. Keep things real: You’re a smart, cool person who’s got a crush on another smart, cool person. If you’re not confident enough in yourself to ask your crush out, then why should your crush be confident enough in you to take your word?
6. Start small. Don’t go asking your crush to the fanciest place you can afford because that’ll put pressure on you. Try going out to a local coffeehouse or bakery and talking with each other. If you’re already good friends with your crush, then feel free to do something more adventurous. It’s all about knowing what will make the other person happy.
7. Have a Plan B. Stuff not going as planned? If your crush doesn’t seem all that interested when you start introducing yourself, then maybe asking him or her out right now isn’t the best idea. Instead, wish him or her well and try talking again later. As you become better acquainted, try asking him or her out again. Everyone has days that don’t go well, and perhaps you just ran into him or her at the wrong time.
8. Know when to bail. If things start going really badly on the first date, or if you realize that the person sitting across the table slurping a macchiato isn’t the elegant person you’d been hoping for, it’s okay to cut things short. Check your cell phone and say that you forgot that you’ve got an interview, or that a family member needs to talk to you right away. Don’t be rude, but don’t feel obliged to spend your entire day with someone you don’t want to be with.
9. Win or lose gracefully. If you get turned down, don’t mope away the entire weekend in your room. You gave it your best shot, and sometimes things don’t work out. Carnegie Mellon will be sure to give you more homework to make up for your emotional loss. If you got accepted, good work! Have fun with your date, but don’t rub it in other people’s faces that you’re going out with the hottie from history class. And be sure to save some time over the weekend to finish your assignments.

As with most Christian holidays, Valentine’s Day has its origins in a pagan fertility rite that occurs in mid-February, which was called Lupercalia in the Roman Calendar. 
The festival of Lupercalia was simply about sex and fertility and had nothing to do with wooing young girls with trite tokens or romance. Lupa was the she-wolf who suckled the infant orphans Romulus and Remus, the founders of Rome. Lupercalia, or the “Wolf Festival,” was celebrated in honor of her primal maternity, as the purifier and provider of life for the Roman civilization. 
The festival began with a sacrifice of two male goats and a dog by the Luperci or the flamen dialis, who were important priest-like figures in the Roman religion. This was followed by two chosen young Luperci being anointed at the altar with the sacrificial blood and milk. A carnal feast followed where the Luperci cut slaps of skin from victims and dressed themselves in the skins of the sacrificed goats to imitate Lupa. 
They ran around the old Palatine city with the thongs of skin in their hands and struck people passing them by. They then ritualistically slapped young women with the thongs of meat to promote fertility in the spring to come. 
Plutarch described in the Life of Caesar that “At this time many of the noble youths and magistrates run up and down through the city naked, for sport and laughter striking those they meet with shaggy thongs. And many women of rank also purposely get in their way, and like children at school present their hands to be struck, believing that the pregnant will thus be helped in delivery and the barren to pregnancy.”
In the fifth century, Pope Gelasius I attempted to Christianize the festival by banning Lupercalia and choosing Feb. 14 as a less sexually-charged festival called Saint Valentine’s Day. There were numerous Christian martyrs canonized as Valentine, and, until 1969, the Catholic Church formally recognized 11 Valentine’s Days.
One story takes place in the third century CE, when the priest Valentine secretly performed marriage ceremonies for young men. Roman Emperor Claudius II allegedly ordered his men to stay single, because he believed that married and lovesick men made poor soldiers. When Claudius discovered that Valentine was secretly wedding couples, Valentine was arrested and thrown into jail. Legend has it that the lovers he had married would come and visit him, passing him notes and flowers through his cellar door. 
While lying in condemnation, Valentine fell in love with his jailer’s daughter, who was blind. On the day of his execution, Valentine wrote a love letter to the young girl and signed it “from your Valentine.” Upon receiving the letter, the young girl’s vision was miraculously restored so she could read the love note.
A Saint Valentine from Belarus was also rumored to be the founder of Valentine’s Day cards. This saint was rejected by his mistress and the pain of his unrequited love led him to commit suicide. In a fit of desperation, he took a knife to his chest and sent the still-beating heart to the mistress as a token of his undying love. It was told that the heart never stopped beating. Thus, lovers send each other heart shaped cards, symbolic of Valentine’s overwhelming passion and suffering caused by love.
Modern Valentine’s Day has been far removed from these traditions. Card makers and mass marketers reel in about $14 billion annually on the holiday. Americans purchase 180 million roses on Valentine’s Day and spend $160 million on candy and chocolates. 
So, if you’re feeling a little overwhelmed by the destructive pressures of commercial Valentine’s rituals, perhaps you could instead celebrate Lupa and fertility. At least then you’ll be honoring love and not money.

Most likely, half the couples out there are going to be gifting each other heart-shaped jewelry boxes, plastic roses, and hot pink pop-up cards. Here’s a guide to what gifts say about the person receiving them and giving them.
A rose: They’re selling them at the UC. What could be easier? Honestly, whoever gets just a rose should be thankful that someone spending sleepless nights at Carnegie Mellon at least made an effort to get something.
Jewelry: A gift of this kind could have either of two meanings: It indicates that the person who receives it is stylish and takes pride in his or her appearance, or that he or she has got a miserable sense of fashion. 
Perfume: The smell every day is unbearable. This gift is meant to be put to good use.
Candy: The gift for a glutton. Either that or the person who’s giving the gift is a glutton.
Clothes: The first thing to do when getting gifts of clothes is to make sure they fit. If they do, it indicates that someone really thinks the person is special, and actually took the effort of secretly pulling their T-shirt out of the laundry and checking its size. If the clothes don’t fit... well, the laundry was too gross-looking to touch.
A stuffed teddy bear/dog/cat/turtle/mouse/horse: This is a gift for the romantic and mushy type of person, for those who react with a “O cho chweet a wittle teddy bear holding a wee hearty wearty.” Yes, for those people.
A gift card: This indicates that whoever gifted this really doesn’t know their Valentine. If the giver did, wouldn’t he or she know that the person preferred Forever 21 to GAP?
A black and gold sweater, scarf, hat, and mittens: For the Steelers fan. One should just not expect that signature football that they actually played with at the Super Bowl.
Nothing: These are the “gifts” given by the people who think that the most precious gifts are those that are felt and not seen, it’s the thought of being together that counts.

This Valentine’s Day, try and make your first date perfect by avoiding all the things that could potentially cause embarrassment. Here is a list of things that can go wrong, making the day memorable for very wrong reasons. Be sure to keep the following in mind when you’re out on your date.
1. Wait, wait, wait:   Your date is set, the time and place have been decided, but you’re left waiting for your date in the chilly Pittsburgh weather. In the end, your date does show up, but an hour late. Moreover, the reason for the tardiness is something lame, like “Sorry, I was at the last level of Warcraft and just couldn’t leave.” 
2. Out of gas:  Love is in the air. With hand in hand, staring into one another’s eyes, you are driving to the restaurant, but suddenly, the romantic song playing on the car stereo changes to a rickety noise. The car stops! The next thing you know, your date looks like a greasy mechanic, which is a complete turn-off.
3. Come one, come all:  Things can become hard to manage if you end up bumping into a group of friends at the restaurant and have to dine with a whole bunch of unwanted people instead of just your date. To make things worse, you might bump into an ex-girlfriend or ex-boyfriend. So, if it happens, try to stay cool and act normal. This will impress your Valentine even more.
4. Oodles of noodles:   If the venue of your date is a Chinese restaurant, be careful about how you eat your noodles. If you order noodles and eat them very messily (which is likely to happen, as noodles are not easy to handle in situations where one is nervous), remember that this mess is going to put your date off instantly.
5. It’s burning hot:   The cup of hot coffee sitting on the table falls on your date’s clothes. He or she tries to wash it off, but big brown patches still remain. It’s understandable that you’re nervous, but try not to be too clumsy. Also, wear darker colors so that if something spills on you, it won’t be too noticeable.
6. A night with the Doc:  You are very adventurous, and you take your date to a completely new restaurant. The food turns out to be awful and makes your date so sick that a visit to the doctor has to be made instead of the promised after-dinner walk in the park. 
7. Where’s my wallet?:   The dinner is over and it’s time to pay the check. But where is your wallet? It turns out that you’ve forgotten your wallet and you have to make your date pay for the dinner. This is just not desirable, as all future prospects are ruined at this very moment. It’s mandatory to double-check before one leaves the house that there is enough money (preferably a credit card or two to impress your date) to pay for both of you.
8. No photo shoots, please:   The last thing you should ever do is to take photographs of your date on your phone, especially if this is the first date. It can be very creepy. A strict no-no!
9. Hitting on someone else: A sexy person enters the room and you just cannot take your eyes off him or her. You can kiss your date good-bye.
10. Tring, tring: The date is going well, but your phone begins to ring, and then rings again, and again, and again. Someone or other keeps on calling. This can be an instant turn-off, especially if you keep answering the phone.
If these horrors still happen, then be ready with some instant solutions, as you are now familiar with the worst-case scenario.

What’s the worst V-Day gift you have ever received? I have never received a bad Valentine’s Day gift, but I imagine not receiving one would be pretty bad. — KK 
Chocolate roses and a chocolate champagne bottle. So tacky. — JT 
My ex of two weeks started dating my crush on V-Day. — DM 
I’ve been pretty lucky as far as gifts go. I got a weirdly cool one, though: my grandmother sent me chocolate chip cookies in an old coffee canister. So the cookies tasted a little like caffeine, which was an unexpected but awesome pick-me-up. — AY 
In eighth grade, my boyfriend bought me a rose that cost $1 from CVS. — CM 
I’ve always received nice Valentine’s gifts, but a couple of years ago my boyfriend took me for a quick lunch instead of dinner because he wanted to watch the football [soccer] at night. I wasn’t too impressed with that. — AB 
One single Sweetheart candy. — CJ 
A hideous black teddy bear...more like an ape. — KM
What’s your favorite pick-up line? Has it ever worked? “Will you be my girlfriend?” Yes. — KK 
“I’d better call the police because you stole my heart.” — DM “I want to be your derivative so that I can lie tangent to your curves.” I’m a math and physics major, give me a break. — AY 
I was really drunk and in a club one night, and joking with a boy I liked, I said I thought he was gay. He denied it and so I told him to prove it by kissing me. Cringe! It must have worked though because he’s flying from the UK to visit me during spring break! — AB 
“You like Radiohead too? Let’s go out.” It’s worked too many times to count on hands. — CJ
What would you recommend singles do on this day? Find another single person or their secret crush and ask them, “Will you be my valentine?” — KK 
It’s just another day — I say everyone should ignore “Hallmark holidays.” — JT 
Buy yourself a box of chocolates. They’re tasty. — DM 
Give gifts to their friends and mooch chocolate off their families. Trust me on this one: everyone loves giving chocolate to you. Let them do it. — AY 
Eat red velvet cake batter. Alone. — CM 
Go out clubbing with friends! Or get a big bunch of friends together and go for a meal, or have a movie night in or something. Just don’t spend it alone! — AB 
Listen to a great playlist of songs and hang out with other singles. — CJ 
Friends can play secret valentine... or take each other out. — KM
What do you look for in the people you date? 
A good personality. — KK 
Humor, wit, not taking oneself too seriously. — JT

Dry humor, the ability to cook chicken Alfredo, a brooding manner, and really nice hips. — AY 
Sense of humor. — CM 
A boy with a good personality, who makes me laugh and can hold a decent conversation. A good sense of humor is so important. — AB 
Uniqueness, interest, and beauty (in that order). — CJ
What do you think is the sexiest food item? 
Ketchup! It is red, tasty, and goes with everything. — KK Contrary to what PETA says, I believe in the sexiness of a well-cooked piece of meat. Take chicken cacciatore for example. Just say the name a few times, savoring it as it passes across your tongue. Yeah, you get my point. — AY
Blue Raspberry Jolly Ranchers, because they turn your mouth blue. — CM 
I don’t know... chocolate, maybe? — AB 
Chocolate. It’s a no-brainer. — CJ 
Chocolate covered strawberries. — KM
What is the one thing you always do before a first date? 
Confirm plans for the evening. — KK 
Shower. — JT 
Showering is always a good idea. — DM 
Practice smiling different ways in the mirror. This inevitably devolves into making weird faces at myself for at least five minutes before I realize that I’m going to be late and then leave. — AY 
Brush my teeth? — CM 
Call my friends to discuss what I should wear. — AB 
Make a friend or relative do the smell test. — CJ 
Check three times in the mirror. — KM
What’s your perfect V-day gift? 
One that is given from the heart. — KK 
Surprise kisses. — DM 
Something that surprises me because I didn’t know that the other person knew me that well. — AY 
A decent boyfriend? — CM 
Something simple and personal that means something. A mix tape is perfect, or a homemade card. I hate over the top gifts and empty grand gestures. — AB 
A homemade card. — CJ

Valentine’s Day is the day of love envied, denied, remembered, and ignored. Soundtracks can back our lives, whether we choose to acknowledge it or not. The following playlists act as lyrical and musical backings to the various situations found on Valentine’s Day. The purpose of a soundtrack is both to define an atmosphere and to heighten the feelings of that atmosphere to the point where the listener(s) gain something out of the experience. Each of these particular playlists has a different theme, audience, and goal for the listener.
This playlist is for the emotional ones, those without love, or love newly lost. Great soundtracks for a loveless V-Day can be made by avoiding the one-dimensional trap of self-pity. This list has a specific lyrical and musical arc that is designed to leave you feeling better about your situation. These sad saps must confront their sadness by confirming its existence, and shifting them into a light-hearted acknowledgment of their ridiculousness.
My Bitter Man’s Playlist:
Ben Folds Five — “Song for the Dumped” 
Kanye West — “Heartless” 
Fiona Apple — “Not About Love” 
Rivers Coumo — “Can’t Stop Partying” 
Radiohead — “There There” 
Liars — “The Other Side of Mt. Heart Attack” 
The Postal Service — “We Will All Be Silhouettes”
Asleep at the Wheel — “I Ain’t got Nobody” 
Bob Dylan — “Most Likely You Go Your Way” 
Beck — “Loser” 
Oh, so you aren’t a sad sap after all? Now that you have that extra pep, you want to impress that cute student in Physics II? Well, shucks, here’s just the little cute-but-not-too-cute-but-still-suave playlist that will set the scene without making it seem like you put too much effort into it. It can’t help you much past the music, as the talking and personality is all up to you. The aim of this soundtrack is to convey your intelligence through the inclusion of some complex songs, return to familiar and simple territory to let them focus on your personality, and then finish with cute songs that will win over their heart.
Romantically Plausible Playlist:
Peter Bjorn & John — “Paris 2004”
Radiohead — “Reckoner” 
Animal Collective — “In the Flowers”
Sublime — “Santeria” 
She & Him — “I Was Made For You” 
The Beatles — “Michelle” 
The Postal Service — “Such Great Heights” 
The White Stripes — “Hotel Yorba” 
Billy Bragg & Wilco — “California Stars” 
Uncle Earl — “Wallflower”

It is that special someone with whom so many memories have already been forged, and you’re just waiting for an evening with the two of you to recapture the beauty of your relationship. This playlist has been specifically mulled over to concoct that special combination of beauty and poignancy, of power and humbleness, which truly makes moments special. Spend an evening at home over a specially cooked meal and play these tracks.

Ross Gay’s Against Which is a collection of poems that is an incredibly poignant and inspired piece of work. His narrative slips in and out of first person for some of his poems to better capture the essence of what he is portraying. 
He writes from a very candid and honest source, telling the truth of what he knows in a rich and descriptive manner. He speaks with educated diction about authentic, gritty content and provides a refreshing take on some very common themes.
The title of the book is a reflection on opposition. The title poem examines things people might oppose as points of tension with which any reader can identify. Ross highlights a message of hope in this poem, that despite all of the despair humanity faces, we can and will prevail. The tremendous tenacity and perseverance displayed in this poem resonates in the rest of the work, with poems that cover topics like family, death, love, and loss.
The book is separated into three parts, without any thematic elements consistent to each one. Once readers note certain subjects or topics used in poems from a certain part, they can recognize some of the recurring motifs and images in the later sections. Gay uses list forms and writes poems in a specific sequence. 
His repetition of certain words, like “limning” and “gingko trees” is noticeable in poems like “Unclean. Make me.,” and “Litany,” as well as “The Hernia” and “Slipping From Lips.” The last two are true studies of nature, and his descriptions of how the seasons change and the personification of the gingko tree help the reader to understand his distinct view of the world and incredible awareness of gesture
Themes of illness and death and recurring images like dirt, mud, nature, breath, and blood all permeate the book in an unforgettable way. He uses these words like a refrain and attacks each one from every angle. He bounces around from poem to poem like a basketball, hitting the ground hard with a characteristic ping, and his poems leave you with lasting visuals.
Some of the more foul and gritty poems were “Bar-b-q,” “Lynching,” and “Gophers.” These poems all describe some violent or grotesque situation that leaves one questioning human nature and some of its more immoral practices. “Ruptured Aneurysm,” “One Eye Gone Black,” “Broken Mania,” and “Alzheimer’s,” and all emphasize the personal and family battles with cancers and other terminal illnesses that plague his life and those of his relatives. The poems “Patience,” “Dead Hair,” “Why Would We Not,” “Outbreath,” and “Dying is An Art” all display how he has come to terms with death and how he perceives it in his own life and the lives of his family.
Love and lust also are themes to note here, with poems like “Bullet” addressing the intense desire of an inanimate object like ammunition. “Let Me Be,” “Coming Out of You,” “Poem Beginning with a Line Overheard in a Gym,” and “Unclean. Make me.,” all examine intercourse and intimacy in some seemingly rough terms, however, these poems display his role in these interactions, sexual or not, with women.
The delicate dynamic between father, son, and family is examined in the poems “The Voice,”  “The Walk,” “Poet Dreams,” and “How to Fall in Love with Your Father.” They provide the reader with insight into each relationship and how it changes through the progression of an illness and what toll that takes on all parties involved. “The Walk” was especially endearing and tender. This poem talks about his grandmother and shows the selfless love of a true elder, from whom he has learned a lot. “The Voice” is a coming-of-age poem, detailing Gay’s journey from boy to man, showing the lessons he learned and things taught to him by his father, and “How to Fall in Love with Your Father” represents his destination; the author arrives at a place where he can finally return the favor.
“Angels Out of Reach” is a poem that focuses on his being drunk and high on mushrooms, and these altered states of being make for a wonderful description of his time with a woman and the weather outside, and the view of his surroundings while perched in a tree.  
This poem, rich with details about everything around him, really allows you into his drunken mind, still sane enough to tell you that the woman’s smile is “sharp and subtle as clear glass drifting at a sandy lake bottom.” This poem truly encapsulates Gay as a beautiful writer, one whose seemingly regular experiences with drinking, women, sickness, and his environment are all heightened, turned extraordinary even, with his extended metaphors.

“My time will come.” Those were the words uttered by the great composer Gustav Mahler when confronted with fierce musical criticism during his lifetime. Nearly a century after his death, on the night of Jan. 30 at New York City’s prestigious Carnegie Hall, Mahler’s assertion seemed particularly accurate as the Carnegie Mellon Philharmonic Orchestra, conducted by world famous Carnegie Mellon alumnus, Keith Lockhart, poured their hearts and musical talent into Mahler’s First Symphony, “Titan.” Performing to a packed hall in the heart of American classical music New York City, it was hard not to be moved by the experience.
The performance began with a brief talk by the head of the School of Music, Noel Zahler. “Tonight is a night to celebrate,” Zahler said. Referencing the dramatic economic downturn experienced this past year, Zahler went on to highlight the importance of supporting the arts, particularly music. “At Carnegie Mellon, we make things,” Zahler explained. “We make music.” As the night wore on, it became apparent that this beautifully clear New York night was truly one of jubilation and triumph for the artistic expectation of excellence that the School of Music stands for.
The program opened up with a piece that was written to Lockhart’s young son by the conductor’s friend, Gabriela Lena Frank. Frank’s piece, “Three Latin American Dances for Orchestra,” provided a percussive and rhythmic introduction to the challenging program ahead. Moving from the 1970s to the late 1800s, the Pittsburgh Symphony Orchestra’s Grammy-nominated concertmaster, Andrés Cárdenes, performed a solo with the Carnegie Mellon Philharmonic on Édouard Lalo’s “Symphonie Espagnole.” Cárdenes made the five-movement musical workout look effortless with his magnificent violin playing.
After the violin solo, which was remarkably balanced with a present but not overbearing orchestral accompaniment, the stage was set, quite literally, for Mahler’s “Titan” symphony. The Carnegie Mellon Philharmonic’s concertmistress, Emma Steele, said, “I won’t be excited until I walk into the hall,” especially since everyone knows that to get to Carnegie Hall, a musician must “practice, practice, practice.” First-year music major and violinist Johanna Soderlund had a similar reaction, saying, “it’s overwhelming” to be playing at Carnegie Hall as “that is what you dream of as a little kid.”
Carnegie Hall is famous for improving the playing level of ensembles through its design and aura, and Carnegie Mellon’s Philharmonic was no exception with their brilliant and dramatic Mahler performance. Maestro Lockhart led difficult tempi transitions beautifully, particularly in the very opening of the piece and in the epic last movement. Lockhart’s terrific performance and ability to prepare the Philharmonic in a matter of days has made many in the audience and orchestra wonder if he is the music director the school has spent the last two years looking for.
The second movement, meant to sound like a lumbering waltz, seemed a little too disjointed at times, but oboist Jeffrey Marshak and horn player Jared Jodrey, a graduate student in music, graciously appreciated the light and nostalgic Trio section in the middle of the movement. Flautist Mira Magrill, a senior music major, provided wonderful solos in the first and fourth movements that are deceptively difficult and meant to be imitations of birdcalls. Perhaps the most impressive solo moment of the symphony, though, came in the ominous form of the children’s nursery song, “Frère Jacques.” Opening the third movement, bassist Sean O’Hara, a graduate student in music, performed the melody with ease, projection, and impeccable intonation. It is hard to believe that any orchestra would be less than content with O’Hara’s interpretation and performance of this famous bass line in orchestral literature.
If the theme of the night was celebration, then the climax came with the famous “Titan” ending, when the entire horn section and first trumpet player stood up while joyfully exclaiming the powerful motif and main melody of Mahler’s Symphony. This short but intensely effective motif is purposely taken from Handel’s “Messiah” when the chorus sings, “And He shall reign for ever and ever.” As the crowd leapt to its feet in ecstatic recognition and appreciation for Carnegie Mellon’s Philharmonic, it was clear that the School of Music’s time had truly come.

What is traveling if not stumbling across train platforms with bags in tow, meeting strangers in strange lands with unexpected connections, or being completely lost and feeling completely safe at the same time?
I flew into the Frankfurt International Airport one bleary morning in late May of last year to intern at the University of Heidelberg Medical Institutes at Mannheim. I had an address, a phone that I wasn’t sure would work outside of the U.S., and no idea what to do from there. It was terrifyingly exciting.
What I discovered over the course of the next couple of weeks was that Mannheim had both a fast-paced rush and an old-town charm, a certain uniqueness and a comforting normalcy. The Rhine and Neckar rivers run through its industrialized sections, the streets are named after the likes of Wagner and Mozart, and a festival filled to the brim with frothy beer and sausages was dancing with energy in the old city the weekend I arrived.
My suitemates were ambitious business students with flawless English, and had a fair amount of curiosity about my culture, just as I did about theirs. My friends were also foreign students studying at the palace-turned-college University of Mannheim. We had more in common than what was apparent on the surface: college life, our parents’ immigrant experiences, moving around throughout childhood, and more commonplace things like music, movies, and sports.
In terms of sports, Germany’s role in EuroCup 2008 was all the rage. I joined my lab mates in an outdoor viewing of a preliminary match against the Czech Republic. It was pouring, everyone’s shoes were soaked, and even that couldn’t keep these dedicated Mannheimers from cheering on the victorious German team. A couple of weeks later, the win against Turkey in the semifinals caused riots in the streets that rivaled those on Forbes Avenue on Super Bowl night. The pride everyday Germans felt during the Cup was a kind of nationalized emotion, of power behind unity.
If being in Europe during the EuroCup excited the sports enthusiast, being in Europe at all excited the artist and musician within me to even greater amounts. I visited Neuschwanstein Castle in Schwangau, which was the inspiration for Walt Disney’s castle. It was the epitome of medieval fantasies: room after room was filled with detailed paintings of scenes from Richard Wagner’s operas, including maidens with flowing hair and golden rings and knights on galloping horses.
Vienna was a phenomenon within itself. A long time ago, my parents had brought me there and I discovered that I really liked classical music. I saw a beautiful flautist playing wonderful music in the city center of Stephansplatz and decided then that I would also play the flute and one day become her. No flautist was near St. Stephen’s Cathedral this time, but I loved the other street musicians, the mimes in 18th century clothing, the Mozart impersonators/ticket sellers, the outdoor concerts in palace gardens, and the spirited gay rights parade that marched right past the capitol.
Current events presented themselves without much prying. Europeans and Americans alike were eager to discuss topics of the day. Barack Obama took Berlin by storm while I was in Germany, and London’s streets were blocked off for his visit while I romped through other sections of the city. My hosts in Paris pointed out that tourism in the French capital had taken a slight dip due to the absence of many Chinese tourists feeling the sting of Paris’s street riots over the Olympic flame, and at the same time in Munich’s Olympic park, I thought about the legacy Beijing 2008 would leave. It was refreshing to gain insight from many perspectives, to experience multiple ways of cultural thought.
The best thing about traveling is the spontaneity — the unexpected encounters. I’ve never before appreciated the bonding between travelers in a cheap youth hostel, sharing stories, tips, experiences, or “what we do in the real world.” I’ve had the chance to engage in a discussion about global politics with a South Korean exchange student in Munich, about classical music in Vienna with a friend of my parents, about obscure 20th century operas with opera singers in Salzburg, and about, well, Carnegie Mellon with coincidental alums in the upper reaches of the Swiss Alps.
“Roughing it” was a lot more fun; to think about the fact that everything you use you carry on your back and that the best advice is from locals standing in their front yards made bellhops and concierges obsolete. I have been fortunate to receive kindness from strangers, such as the universality of a red umbrella lady’s gesture for me to stand under the umbrella with her in rain-drenched Heidelberg, of well-dressed businessmen still helping me lug my suitcase up never-ending steps in Stuttgart, of missing trains and having the person behind me explain the situation in foreign tongues.
When I got home, I thought of a line by Edgar Allen Poe: “The weary, way-worn wanderer bore/To his own native shore.” Here the skyline wasn’t so foreign, here was a place I knew well, and here I couldn’t revel in the aesthetic of being lost in quite the same way. I was a bit weary, definitely way-worn, and unmistakably returned to my own native shore, but ready for the next adventure.

As of this writing it is 9 °F outside. According to weather.com, it “feels like 1°F.” The difference, at least to this author, seems entirely academic. On the bright side, we have only 49° to go until Celsius and Fahrenheit coincide and only 468° to go until the heat death of the universe.
Here are some of my favorite ice albums:
Terje Isungset — Iceman Is
So it probably won’t surprise you to find out that a lot of these albums are from Scandinavia. You know your geography. This one comes from Sweden. The group recorded in a studio carved beneath the famous Ice Hotel of Jukkasjärvi, which is sculpted entirely from ice every year and subsequently melts in the spring. All the instruments used in the recording were made of ice. The studio itself was made of ice. The album sounds like a gloomy pagan moon festival.
Elegi — Varde
Norwegian composer Tommy Jansen uses synthesizers, violins, and field recordings to represent the frigid travails of the first polar explorers. This is one of the bleakest things you may ever hear in your life besides, of course, the death cry your rabbit, Mr. Bingles, uttered when the formerly senescent family dog, Turbo, rediscovered his carnivorous impulses on a throw rug in the living room in 1993. The way Jansen toys with scale is amazing — sometimes you feel stranded amid expansive slurries and floes, other times it’s as if a spoon is tapping on a tin plate within the confines of your own tent.
Thomas Brinkmann — Klick Revolution
This album actually has very little to do with ice. It’s by a German who does peculiar things with turntables, most of which take away any desire you ever had to dance, or otherwise engage in club-related activities. Think of the sounds ice cubes make when you pour tap water on them. Now think of them splayed across a dark matrix of rhythm and radiant knife wounds. N-ice!
Douglas Quin —* Antarctica*
Quin got a grant from the National Science Foundation in 1996 to go to Antarctica. He used microphones and hydrophones to record Weddell Seals, Emperor Penguins, and the very glaciers themselves. This is a fieldwork of peculiar beauty and intensity. Sounds like ice because it is ice.

Dear Joe,
I am taking an introductory biology class and am having trouble staying awake. I’m not really interested in the subject, but if I want to do well at all, I need to take notes. How do I avoid sleeping in a class I couldn’t care less about?
—Dozing in Doherty
Dear Dozing,
Suffering the slingshots and arrows of outrageous classes is a rite of passage for any student at Carnegie Mellon. Classes not in one’s major can often prove to be the hardest, especially when they demand constant attention due to professors teaching outside of the textbook. This attention, however, sometimes seems impossible to give. Lectures often move too fast, leaving non-dedicated students in the dust. This begs the question: Is there any way around this? Fortunately, Dozing, the solution has existed for centuries. Try coffee: the fast, cheap, and moderately safe option for getting work done.
Coffee is delicious, helps beat the cold when walking in between classes, and even provides antioxidants for your immune system. Most importantly, coffee keeps you awake. There’s a reason that coffee is labeled as an intellectual drink. Without it, most scientific journals and novels simply wouldn’t exist. If there is one setback to coffee, it’s the jittery feeling that it sometimes delivers to novices and coffee abusers. With that said, try to make sure you only down coffee on a full stomach. Also, a small cup from La Prima in Wean Hall will do just fine to get you through biology class. When you feel like you’re about to sail into dreamland, sip your coffee, and let the magic happen. Just remember, keep your intake to only a few cups a day. When you start bringing 2 iters of espresso to class, it might be time to scale back.
Wired, 
Joe 
Dear Joe,
I have recently participated in the EOC job fair, and things aren’t looking too good. Many companies are only hiring for one position out of over 100 applicants, while other companies aren’t even interested in my résumé. I thought Carnegie Mellon was my golden ticket to a job, but now it looks like I’m frying fish at Long John Silver’s until I find something appropriate for my degree. Were my four years a waste?
—Unemployed in The Underground
Dear Unemployed,
First off, working at Long John Silver’s is nothing to scoff at. Quality food and friendly service at an affordable price is something for which anyone can proudly work. But I can imagine that your major didn’t specialize in deep-frying, so it’s reasonable that you’re upset. Carnegie Mellon is renowned for getting students job offers. But remember, jobs are dependent on the economy, and there’s not much a university can do about that. It might be some time until the economy turns around. Until that day, all you can do is keep trying.
In between producing delicious batter-dipped fish sandwiches with malt vinegar, apply for more jobs. Even after you graduate, Carnegie Mellon can list for you companies that are hiring. Make sure to apply to many places. Strength comes in numbers, Unemployed. Just look at the value of the mound of fried clams you can get for under a dollar at your neighborhood Long John Silver’s. All in all, keep in mind that your degree proclaims that you put in your part here at Carnegie Mellon. When the job scene finally clears up, I’m sure there will be plenty of opportunities. As for now, you have bigger fish to fry.
Ahoy! 
Joe

The Glee and Mandolin Clubs are preparing for their annual concert next week. The Mandolin Club boasts a repertoire of 22 pieces. As for the Glee Club, 40 men plan to serenade their audience with the new school song, “Hail Carnegie.” Andrew Carnegie, upon hearing the news, is somewhat annoyed that it has have taken nine full years to get his own song of devotion.

The annual WRITE competition is underway. The prize committee is accepting humorous articles, editorials, radio scripts, and technical articles. Students are encouraged to apply, as they have “nothing to lose, and everything to gain.” By “everything,” they mean a grand prize of $25 for winners in each category.

In another contest, Carnegie Mellon is giving away two tickets to see Rodney Dangerfield. The rules are short and sweet: describe in 25 words or less why you get no respect. This greatly supercedes last year’s Rodney Dangerfield contest, where contestants competed to see who could get kicked out of a golf club the quickest.

In “A Person’s Opinion,” students are asked what they are doing for Valentine’s Day. Not surprisingly, all responses published seem to come from those without dates. A mechanical engineer boasts that he is “going to a black anti-Valentine’s day party.” Even a professor of computer science is bitter toward romance: writing off the holiday as a “product of a commercialized society.” That may be true, professor, but so are computers.

In celebration of Valentine’s Day, Skibo Coffeehouse had a series of date auctions held by different student groups. Pictures of this event display several auctionees scantily clad in just their underwear while they strut their stuff on stage. Looks like while some found this sight enjoyable, others just lost their appetite.

Students who lock themselves out of their dorm rooms are expected to pay up. Visits from the police now cost students nothing for the first offense, with increments of $5 for every subsequent offense. Also, loss of room key now costs $25, up from $15. Why the increase? It looks to me like another attack on the school’s sizable “absent-minded” minority.

Facebook is one of the largest social networking sites in the world, and there are over 20,000 users on the Carnegie Mellon Facebook network. 
A few more than 300 of these users are faculty, excluding the accounts of faculty formerly associated with the school, and fake faculty accounts set up by students as jokes. 
Furthermore, despite all the unknown acquaintances that usually dot the typical user’s list of friends, very few undergraduates at Carnegie Mellon are friends on Facebook with their professors.
For many college students, this separation is an essential part of Facebook’s appeal.
“We share information on Facebook that we would not share in a classroom context,” explained first-year computer science major Joseph Lum. 
“For many, it would feel uncomfortable to know that your professor could see everything you had written on your page, especially if that professor is going to grade you at the end of the semester.”
Professors face similar, if not significantly greater, risks as their students on Facebook. 
On her profile, professor Reiko Ohnuma at Dartmouth College admitted she had consulted the online encyclopedia Wikipedia to prepare for her lecture the next day. 
She wrote, “Do you think Dartmouth parents would be upset about paying $40,000 a year for their children to go here if they knew that certain professors were looking up stuff on Wikipedia and asking for advice from their Facebook friends on the night before the lecture?”
Ohnuma also criticized her colleagues, writing on her profile, “some day, when I am chair [of a department meeting], we’re all going to JOG IN PLACE throughout the meeting. This should knock out at least half of the faculty within 10 minutes ... & then the meeting can be ended in a timely manner.”
The tenured associate professor of religion thought that only the people she had specifically added to her list of friends could read her comments, but in fact everyone in Dartmouth College had access to her profile. 
Students quickly disseminated her comments across online blogs and college newspapers. 
Ohnuma described the experience as “highly embarrassing,” and she has urged her peers to check the privacy settings on their accounts and be careful about what they say online.
The division and tension between students and professors on Facebook seems to ease after graduation. 
“Your relationship with your old professors completely changes,” explained alumna Jeanne Martin (GSIA ’99). “In the college, the students are trying to impress the professors for grades, and the professors are trying to impress the students as well.... Facebook is about being yourself.”
Alumnus David Friedman (CIT ’01) recounted, “I held my professors up to high expectations, and they held me up to high expectations too.... [That atmosphere] helped me do well academically, but I could not let myself relax.”
On Ohnuma, Friedman also added, “It is funny that those students criticize someone for using Wikipedia or working late.... They probably study that way all the time.”

Carnegie Mellon may not have its own online teaching program, but a new online company, 2tor Inc., hopes to fill this gap all the way from California. 2tor has partnered up with the University of Southern California (USC) to offer the first online Master of Arts in Teaching (MAT) degree program for students at Carnegie Mellon and around the world. Through the use of Web 2.0, streaming video, and animation, 2tor hopes to revolutionize the online classroom experience.
Jennifer Hanlon, 2tor’s marketing director, explained the reasoning behind the program.
“The country is suffering from a shortage of teachers that are qualified and rigorously trained to effect real change in high-need school districts,” Hanlon said. “MAT@USC can produce more of these teachers by enabling students to attend the school’s prestigious program without having to relocate to Southern California.”
The program offers a chance to specialize in language arts, mathematics, science, and history, or to get a general certification in all of them.
The curriculum includes online courses, field-based teaching assistant experiences in the area where the student resides, and even job placement, mentorship, and tuition reimbursements upon graduation.
While Carnegie Mellon does not have a teaching program, it has a partnership with Chatham College. Chatham offers teaching certifications to Carnegie Mellon students; yet, to make this happen, students must know in their first year that they want to pursue this route, and it is rarely used.
“What sets [2tor] apart is quality, flexibility, and selectivity,” said Hillary Smith, a junior business major and 2tor’s college representative at Carnegie Mellon.
Smith noted that the program is a part of USC in that all lectures, exams, assignments, and course materials are made by USC professors. The technology adds to the classroom experience, Smith said. She mentioned such instances as multiple cameras in a lecture room. The disbursement of video cameras makes for a unique and realistic classroom experience.
As for flexibility, Smith said that professors are available for help at all times, despite any time differences. With a full course load, the program can be completed in a year, and with part-time, it can take up to three years.
Smith brought up the fact that unlike other online competitors, such as University of Phoenix, all 2tor student applicants will have to meet USC standards to enter the program.
Hanlon mentioned the advantage of such a unique online experience.
“MAT@USC utilizes innovative, interactive technology and leverages a custom-tailored curriculum created specifically for the program, which enables students to receive the same degree as those attending the brick-and-mortar USC masters program,” she said.
Hanlon said that the advantages go beyond a USC caliber education.
“In today’s current economic environment, creating less financial freedom for students to relocate to their university of choice as well as adults leaving the workforce and turning to higher education, ... online learning has become a compelling alternative,” she said.
Christopher Jones, a modern languages professor at Carnegie Mellon, teaches a hybrid language course, which is a mix of face-to-face and online interaction.
“We did a three-year study comparing classroom and our hybrid course and found no significant difference in either achievement or satisfaction,” Jones said.
Jones even mentioned some advantages of online over classroom education.
“Our online language classes actually have better teacher-student relationships than standard classroom because of regular one-on-one meetings and electronic contact,” he said.
Jones shared his feelings on 2tor’s marketing plan.
“They’re right to consider the human-to-human as the crucial element in any instructional environment,” he said. “People like the Open University and Horizon Wimba, among others, have been working on developing toolkits to support these interactions virtually, in the case of the Open University using open source software foundations.”
Jones brought up the challenge of separating their Web 2.0 technology from that of others, as this is not a new area of technology.
“In my domain, people have been using these tools, including companies making money teaching languages in Second Life, and outsourcing native speaker tutoring to Costa Rica,for a long time,” Jones said.
Hanlon mentioned that 2tor goes far beyond Web 2.0 technology.
“In addition to combining online learning with carefully selected field-based experiences, MAT@USC also provides ongoing support for new teachers, including job placement assistance and significant tuition reimbursement opportunities,” she said.
Smith summarized it all in just a few words.
“It’s the real deal, just online,” she said.
Students interested can contact Smith at hes@andrew.cmu.edu.

While college gossip may never cease, its most pervasive medium as of late has come to an end. Last Thursday, Juicy Campus, www.JuicyCampus.com, was officially closed down for good.
JuicyCampus, the online forum on which college students could anonymously post comments or ask questions, quickly escalated to fame across college campuses nationwide for the often taboo and at times offensive statements made by students on its website.
In a press release issued last Wednesday, founder and CEO of JuicyCampus, Matt Ivester, cited a lack of sufficient online advertisement revenue as the reason for the website’s abrupt shut-down.
“Unfortunately, even with great traffic and strong user loyalty, a business can’t survive and grow without a steady stream of revenue to support it,” Ivester wrote. “JuicyCampus’ exponential growth outpaced our ability to muster the resources needed to survive this economic downturn.”
Ivester told The Tartan in September that he and his team had not anticipated that the site would grow so rapidly, and that they would “call it a day” once the site reached over 500 campuses, which it had by the time of its closing.
Reaching this benchmark indicated to Ivester that “it’s clear that we have provided a platform that students have found interesting, entertaining, and fun,” according to the press release.
Some students’ initial reactions to the gossip website’s shut-down were that it was closed for issues of responsibility or morality due to the often offensive nature of the posts on the forum.
“It was only really a source of negativity for anyone, so the fact that I was posted about on there makes me more happy about the fact that it’s gone, but either way, I saw it as a bad thing,” said Jeremy Tuttle, a junior in computational finance about whom several posts were made on JuicyCampus.
For those students — or anonymous bystanders — who may still crave an online forum to continue posting gossip about on-campus socialites or questionable professors, there is a new JuicyCampus in town, one whose creators promise will be more interactive and responsible than its gossip-laden predecessor.
If one attempts to visit www.JuicyCampus.com, he or she will now be redirected to www.collegeacb.com, or the Anonymous Confession Board (ACB), owned and operated by Wesleyan University first-year student Peter Frank.
According to a press release by ACB on Feb. 5, the day Ivester shut down JuicyCampus, ACB’s philosophy of “promoting actual discussions … sets [it] apart from JuicyCampus, a website that fostered superficial interactions, often derogatory and needlessly crude. 
By contrast, the ACB consistently hosts a higher level of discourse — while still making room for the occasional gossip post.”
So far, ACB seems to be drawing posts of a similar nature to that of JuicyCampus. Users, presumably Carnegie Mellon students, have posted to the Carnegie Mellon-specific board within ACB about arguments with roommates, attempts at identifying strangers on campus, and often crude sexual comments.
The national online community and the campus community of Carnegie Mellon have yet to see what ACB will bring,and whether it will be as well-received as, or better than, JuicyCampus.

Carnegie Mellon is encouraging the campus to “Take the Challenge! Restore Balance.” 
In an effort to promote health and fitness awareness on campus, the objective of the 2009 Fitness Challenge is to exercise at least 20 minutes a day, three times a week, and to make two smart choices a week.
The program lasts for six weeks, and participants are encouraged with a daily e-mail from someone on the Carnegie Mellon Fitness Challenge team.
Jessica Daluz, a junior business major, said, “The Fitness Challenge is a good way to get people motivated to exercise. I think sometimes people get so caught up in studying and extracurricular activities that they forget to take care of themselves and their health.”
Participants are encouraged to make two smart choices a week, such as taking the stairs one day instead of the elevator, eating an extra piece of fruit or vegetables, or drinking water instead of soda.
Each smart choice or exercise earns Challenge participants a sticker for the smart choice, or a colored-in block for the exercise.
The blocks are located on a wall across from the UC Equipment Desk. Each participant’s name is in a column with various colored-in blocks. 
The crayons and stickers are available at the UC Equipment Desk.
If participants are wary about beginning a workout regimen alone, there are a number of fitness classes available to join. 
Printed on the back of the Fitness Challenge information cards is a weekly schedule of fitness classes that take place in the UC Gym every day. 
In order to take a class, gym-goers must purchase a card from the UC Equipment Desk with a certain number of hole punches available. Each fitness class requires at least one hole punch per class. There are single class cards available, but all cards purchased at the Equipment Desk must be purchased with a check.
The Fitness Challenge program is not focused solely on helping people get back in shape, but on restoring order and balance to participants’ lives. 
Several yoga classes are available throughout the week and the Challenge coordinators encourage yoga practices and meditating as smart choices.
Elisha Clayton, a first-year CIT major, feels inspired when she sees the Fitness Challenge board with everyone’s name on it. “I have been thinking about working out more often now that I know there’s a program to help people stay motivated.”
Most people have that same sentiment about the program.
Dominique Davis, sophomore creative writing major, has been faithful to the Challenge, “but I keep forgetting to put my little stickers up there. I definitely get my workouts in but I haven’t been keeping up with coloring in my blocks. Either way, the e-mails remind me to keep going, and that really helps.”
Along with the daily e-mails, Challenge coordinators also plan sessions with specialists to help people fit more ways to restore balance in their lives. 
Two sessions were planned for Monday in Rangos 2 with Chris Rose and Tracy Linza.
Chris Rose is Carnegie Mellon’s head athletic trainer and on Monday will explain why and how to choose the best walking and running shoes for fitness activities. 
It is important to have the proper foot equipment, as serious injuries can result from wearing the wrong shoes.
Linza is from the Heinz School and will lead participants through a meditation experience in their chairs. 
The session is encouraged for a quick release of tension anywhere in the body. There is also a professional personal trainer in the UC weight room every Friday from 3 p.m. to 4 p.m. in the month of February for participants who may have any questions about their workout regimen, or for those who need help modifying the intensity of their regimen safely.
The 2009 Fitness Challenge is slightly altered this year from last year’s program. 
The introduction of smart choices takes the pressure off of having to work out as often, yet still makes an impact in a person’s weekly routine.
The goal is to live a healthier lifestyle, and for an added incentive, all participants who meet the six-week challenge will be awarded prizes and be included in a raffle on March 19 in the Danforth Lounge from noon to 1 p.m.

[BOLD]Disney Company honors late Pausch[BOLD]
The Walt Disney Company recently announced the creation of the Disney Randy Pausch Fellowship at Carnegie Mellon to recognize the work Pausch put forth during his time at both Carnegie Mellon and Walt Disney Imagineering.
Pausch worked as a Disney Imagineer in 1995, one of the careers he mentioned as being his lifelong dream in his famous “Last Lecture.” 
The Disney Pausch Memorial Fellowship will support two graduate students at Carnegie Mellon, one in the School of Computer Science (SCS), and one in the College of Fine Arts (CFA), showcasing Pausch’s strong belief that these two disciplines could and should collaborate. It was this belief that led to the creation of the Entertainment Technology Center, an interdisciplinary program 
between SCS and CFA.
In addition, a medallion will be placed in the Magic Kingdom in at Walt Disney World inscribed with words from Pausch’s own lecture: “Be good at something; it makes you valuable. Have something to bring to the table, because that will make you more welcome.”
The Memorial Fellowship comes on the heels of another recent collaboration between Carnegie Mellon and Disney; in August, Disney announced that Disney Research, Pittsburgh, will work with Carnegie Mellon in research and development of computer animation, computational cinematography, autonomous interactive characters, and robotic and user interfaces.
[BOLD]Students perform operas on city buses[BOLD]
From this February to May, public bus riders will no longer need to remember to bring their iPod to listen to music on boring bus rides.
Instead, they can listen to Carnegie Mellon students perform 10- to 30- minute operettas.
The project, entitled, “Project Bus Stop,” is funded by an interdisciplinary grant from Carnegie Mellon’s School of Art.
The project brings together a team of students from various disciplines.
These students will take parts of conversations overheard on the bus or snippets of interviews with passengers and turn them into the lyrics of a short opera.
The materials will be performed on the bus and accompanied by a small chamber ensemble, all while en route to their destination.
The performances will not take place until April; however, the team will be combing public transportation before then listening for conversations that they can turn into good lyrics for their show.
The performances can be seen from 11 a.m. to 2 p.m. on April 4 on the 54C bus route and from 11 a.m. to 2 p.m. on April 25 on the East Busway.
Audience participation will be encouraged.

“What kind of ally is Pakistan?” screams a San Francisco Chronicle editorial, as it brashly flaunts the futility of the U.S.’s “ally in the war on terror” to the new American administration, mocking over five decades of U.S.–Pakistan relations.
I wonder too. What kind of ally objects to being bombarded with massive drone attacks, launched by American unmanned Predator drones? I mean, how completely illogical of Pakistan to, for once, stand up for the lives and rights of its own population, rather than become enslaved by its “ally’s” historically disastrous foreign policy. How unreasonable of the U.S.’s “most allied ally” (as famously termed by Pakistan’s first military ruler and former president Field Marshal Muhammed Ayub Khan) to say that, no, you cannot keep fumbling around for terrorists on our land and shooting down our civilians. For heaven’s sake, why can’t Pakistan strike a magical balance between the transition to democracy and submission to U.S. political and military agendas? What kind of an ally is Pakistan?
The answer to that question is camouflaged in the wilderness of historic events from the Cold War to the current “war on anything remotely un-American” (pun intended).
Containment policy lit the first spark in U.S.–Pakistan relations. Emerging from the influential Truman Doctrine, the policy aimed to restrict Soviet influence in Asia by creating military pacts and political blocs in and around the continent. Urged by the U.S., several Asian countries, including Pakistan, were bundled in a collective defense pact called the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization (SEATO). This alliance was attractive to Pakistan because its status as a pro-Western country would gain it support when in conflict with India. While ostensibly two-way in theory, these pacts were designed to benefit the U.S. only and actually stopped the other country from defending itself from aggression by any country that the U.S. did not determine to be its enemy. Not surprisingly, this obvious imbalance did not initially come under protest by Pakistan, so long as American economic aid kept flowing in and the armed forces kept receiving their military hardware, along with the rest of the benefits that were sealed under SEATO. No wonder the authors ponder — what kind of ally is Pakistan?
It was also during this time that Pakistan, in a misguided demonstration of loyalty and friendship, allowed the U.S. to build two military bases in Pakistan that were used to spy over the Soviet Union and communist China. In 1960, from one of these bases, Badaber, in the North West Frontier Province, Francis Gary Powers took off to spy over the USSR and got shot down by Soviet anti-aircraft missile systems inside Soviet territory. This prompted Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev to place a red circle on the city of Peshawar in Pakistan and declare that unless the U.S. packed up its base and left, he would obliterate the entire city, leaving it to the imagination of his audience as to what type of weapon he would use to achieve this aim. The U.S. duly left Peshawar after this embarrassing episode, and Pakistan was left alone to pay the price when in 1971 the Soviet Union backed India to the hilt to dismember Pakistan forever. Furthermore, the U.S. also demonstrated immense support for Pakistan’s longtime rival, India, in terms of its economic and military growth. In an attempt to make up for this, the U.S. promised Pakistan that it would consult its anti-Soviet ally before any aid was allocated to India. However, once again the U.S. turned its back on this promise by committing military aid to India, shortly before a flaming war raged between India and Pakistan in 1965. The hostilities lasted only 17 days, but forever shattered the myth of the neutrality of U.S. leaders and policymakers. Almost all of India’s military hardware providers continued to arm India while Pakistan’s principle supplier, the U.S., clamped an arms embargo on it. The excuse was Pakistan’s growing nuclear program, which was perceived as a threat to India and Israel — India being the U.S.’s new heir to progressive democracy and Israel its recipient of military and economic aid since World War II. So apt is the question, what kind of ally is Pakistan?
Come the post-9/11 era, and the U.S. once again begins stirring this cyclical friendship with Pakistan as it seeks its full cooperation in the war on terror. This time, however, Pakistan is propelled to fight a war on its own land, against its own people. Last Friday, at least 20 people were killed by drone strikes near the border between Pakistan and Afghanistan. While Defense Secretary Robert Gates circulates the falsity that U.S. attacks on its land are blessed by Pakistan, Islamabad publicly denied Gates’ claim, with Prime Minister Yousef Gilani clearly saying that there is no such agreement between the two “allies.”
These were the first hits to the region authorized by President Barack Obama, and probably not the last. This year alone, over 300 civilians have been the targets of both manned and robotic American military assaults on their own soil, particularly in the Swat valley, a once scenic district in the northern areas of Pakistan. The transition in Washington has not affected U.S. foreign policy toward Pakistan but in one facet: Unlike former President Bush, who believed in stabbing the enemy (or friend?) in the back, Obama believes in a head-on collision. Obama stated up-front in his campaign that Pakistan was a key target in combating terrorism, so while the civilian deaths sadden me, they do not come as a surprise. What is indeed baffling is the existing incompetence of the American intelligence. Why, and how, does U.S. intelligence fail to accurately distinguish militants from civilians? Militant groups are on a rampage, blowing up U.S. supply routes to NATO troops in Afghanistan, while the U.S. is blindly attacking civilian homes. Why are these militants not identified in advance by the U.S.? However, as it it sleeps through the destruction of key supply routes, the U.S. deems it necessary to express uneasiness over the release of Abdul Qadeer Khan, the father of Pakistan’s nuclear program and a “rogue bombmaker,” to the West. No wonder then, preoccupied by non-issues, the most technologically advanced and sophisticated U.S. intelligence network falls short in identifying militant hideouts even after repeated attempts.
While Pakistan continues to be a front player in the U.S.’s conflicts all around the world, it never finds its ally — and the most powerful nation in the world — by its side when in need. Not only do such double standards in an alliance defy international norms, they also churn anti-American sentiments among Pakistanis, and thus blot the big picture of U.S.–Pakistan relations. Obama’s administration needs to learn a lesson from this history of one-sided alliances and ensure U.S. loyalty (if it is to call Pakistan an ally) to the country at times of crisis and when justified. These airstrikes only boost hatred toward the American government and drive the ordinary citizen who has lost everything to the doorsteps of religious fundamentalists. These fundamentalists then arm them ideologically and economically, setting their mind to “revenge” mode.
The surprise raids that kill hundreds of innocent civilians pose no less threats than those that external terrorists pose to the U.S. soil. It is akin to rendering the U.S. Department of Homeland Security useless by stripping it of all their power to protect citizens. Since the onset of the “war on terror,” Pakistan has sent over 100,000 of its military troops into the threatening abyss of the northern tribal areas. Yet it is accused of being an unreliable ally. Perhaps for the first time, the U.S. and Pakistan seem to share a common goal — ousting terrorist networks from Pakistani land. A blatant disregard of Pakistan’s masses is sure to jeopardize this effort. At this point, before setting out on a road to nowhere, the U.S. needs to ask itself the question: What kind of ally is Pakistan?

Complaints about many different aspects of life in Pittsburgh are common among Carnegie Mellon students. For example: There aren’t enough buses, the roads aren’t salted, the buildings aren’t attractive, and where’s the 59U? 
However, these complaints must have slipped people’s minds on the night of Super Bowl, when I observed a number of people lighting objects on fire and pulling down street signs and parking meters. After all, how exactly do people expect the property that they have damaged to be fixed without using state and city money that could have otherwise been used to salt more roads or supply the city with more buses?
It would be hypocritical to say that I was completely absent from these celebrations. At the conclusion of the game, I proceeded to run down Forbes, chanting and screaming, “Here we go; Pittsburgh’s won the Super Bowl!” As I approached South Craig Street, a 40-something red-faced man ran out of PHI Bar with his cell phone, shouting, “We have a Cardinals fan on the phone! Let’s boo at the Cardinals fan on the phone.” And at one point, I was smacked in the face with a Terrible Towel by an intoxicated fan. Even so, things were fine until I reached Bigelow Boulevard near the University of Pittsburgh and looked up to see a young man trying to remove a traffic signal from its post. That’s when it hit me — this is not the Obama celebration mob that rushed into Oakland when the election results were announced; this is a Steelers riot. And the two are clearly not the same thing. But did it really need to be a riot?
It seems appropriate to recall the Obama mob that similarly marched down Forbes on Election Night 2008. Though there were thousands of college students out marching, running, and chanting much like there were for the Steelers riot, evidence of violence and destruction was far less on Nov. 4.
So why was it necessary that the Steelers celebration turn into a riot? As evidenced by the celebrations in Oakland after Obama was elected, Pittsburgh college students can celebrate without dismantling traffic signals and destroying other city property, and it seems worthless and irresponsible to engage in the violent and destructive behavior that Carnegie Mellon students usually like to blame on neighboring universities.
Reports from the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette indicate that there were 83 people arrested and 15 fires, in addition to many broken windows, traffic signals, parking meters, street signs, and bus stop shelters. Regardless of the exact monetary amount that the damage totals, it is evident that the city, which has had a structural deficit since 1993, will have to struggle to put together funding for repairs, especially in hard economic times like these.
Therefore, before we continue to complain about Pittsburgh, we must realize that the damage done can only be recovered by using city and state money. These damages force the city to divert funds that could have gone into reducing city debt, creating new programs, and improving infrastructure toward fixing what should have not been damaged in the first place.

A paradox to think about: The economy is in shambles, yet you can’t find a parking space at the jam-packed five-story mall parking garage. You might argue that the hordes of people are all there to buy the 75-percent-off-the-already-50-percent-off-with-an-additional-30-percent-off-with-your-card leftover Christmas trees and assortment of outdated “Holiday 2008” ornaments, but I argue that’s not entirely the case.
In this economy, some are deciding between paying the electricity bill or the mortgage; at the same time, in a Nieman Marcus near you, others are deciding between a pair of garish Betsey Johnson heels or your standard Manolo Blahnik Sedarby Zebra d’Orsays. And yes, I copied and pasted that directly from a shoe blog on the Internet because it was the most ridiculous thing that I could find and not spell.
Thus, the Carrie Bradshaw Effect was born.
Carrie Bradshaw, the empty-headed protagonist of a somehow-survived-six-seasons-too-long television show Sex and the City, has experienced some economic hard times of her own. In an insignificant episode of an insignificant season (because Carrie, et al. are equally bland in all of them), the mathematically-challenged Ms. Bradshaw somehow finds herself with no money to pay the rent but a proud owner of 100 pairs of shoes at $400 a pop on average.
“100 pairs of shoes at $400 each is $4000!” Carrie exclaims in her high-pitched voice.
“That’s forty thousand dollars,” corrected the equally annoying but significantly smarter Miranda character.
“I spent $40,000 on shoes?” Carrie gasps. “I will literally be the old woman who lived in a shoe!”
Thus while everyone else struggles to pay their bills during the rough economic times, Carrie decides between selling her shoes or selling out. (She keeps the shoes.) It’s easy to see the disparity between the haves and have-nots in a crisis, often in disgustingly pretentious fashion, no pun intended. Somehow, the “haves” keep on ... having.
Take a recent American Express Platinum Luxury survey, for example. Led by shopaholic protagonist Carrie Bradshaw, apparently Generation X spends 60 percent more than Baby Boomers on fragrance, cosmetics, and beauty products, 47 percent more on fashion accessories, and 32 percent more on wines and liquors. The Carrie Bradshaw Effect has fanned out beyond her lavish pink bubble as well: a Wall Street Journal wealth report notes that the annual Pebble Beach automobile auction brought in $62.4 million last fall. You have to ask, is this pattern of conspicuous spending appropriate for the situation and time?
My answer? Don’t be a horse-faced Carrie. Don’t flaunt your Manolo-whatevers while others have to cut back on groceries. Don’t talk about five-star vacations while others can barely afford a flight home. Don’t be that person drooling over luxury shoes and jeans while the rest of us rush in to get our recycled and reduced holiday items so next year won’t be as bad as this year. Don’t fall into the Carrie Bradshaw Effect.
Believe it or not, some of the “poorer” affluent have started to notice the pinch, too. For affluent who all of the sudden notice that their economic sky is gray? There’s always “I Can’t Believe It’s Not Caviar.”

In response to the Forum editorial (Jan. 26, 2009) “Possibility of peace between Israel, Gaza shattered by violence,” I felt the need to respond. There were a number of points in the article that I found unfounded, cavalier, and offensive: referring to Israel as the U.S.’s “spoiled child,” calling the recent operation in Gaza a “massacre” in which “hundreds of babies and children who were gunned down at point-blank range,” and the point that Israel’s share of the land is “dangerously disproportionate.” There were other points in Chandna’s article that were factually untrue: her assumption that Israel targets Palestinian civilians, her reference to the Soviet Union’s contribution to the foundation of the state, and the “iniquity” of the UN Partition Plan. I challenge Chandna to reveal the sources from which she has drawn her information, because many statements in her article seem to be made from assumptions and poor journalistic reporting, something uncharacteristic of The Tartan. Overall, I found the article to be poorly written, and Chandna’s attempt to summarize the Palestinian-Israeli conflict in two paragraphs exhibits a lack of understanding for the complicated history of this story.
To consider Israel guilty of war crimes for defending itself from an aggressive enemy whose stated goal is the destruction of Israel is in effect stripping Israel of its right to national sovereignty. It still mystifies me that the leaders of a country that responds in force to the continual barrage of rockets aimed at its civilian population centers for over eight years are deemed “war criminals.” Certainly Israel can be criticized for the amount of damage it has done to innocent Palestinians, or for whether its military operation has achieved anything in the long-term goal of peace, but to say that Israel has no right to defend itself from Hamas is unfair.
I regret the loss of innocent life on both sides. But to argue that this conflict is representative of Israel’s desire for “colonialist expansion” ignores the facts of the situation: Israel unilaterally withdrew from Gaza in Sept. 2005 and only returned to root out the military operations of the terrorist organization Hamas, which has had control of the area since 2007. Israel and Hamas had agreed to a six-month ceasefire, and as the ceasefire expired in December, Hamas refused to renew it and instead began to fire swaths of rockets into Israeli towns, prompting a military response from Israel.
In my opinion, Israel has the right to defend itself from an aggressive enemy like Hamas that specifically targets Israeli civilians while hiding behind its own people. The violence that exists between Israel and Hamas does not seem to bode well for the chances of peace in the near future, something that I still believe the majority of both Palestinians and Israelis desperately want. It remains to be seen how effective Israel’s operation in Gaza was at weakening the military capabilities of Hamas and bringing stability and protection to southern Israel, a war-torn region that is often overlooked despite the apparent power of, as Chandna writes, “Israeli propaganda.” Hopefully both Israeli and Palestinian leaders will soon realize that no amount of bloodshed will solve the conflict without a meaningful, mutually respectful dialogue between the two parties.

While People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA) concerns itself with the ethical treatment of animals, it seems to be less concerned about its advertising ethics.
A commercial that was seemingly intended for a spot during the Super Bowl ended up being too racy for NBC to air. Instead, the banned commercial caught the attention of the media and now PETA’s ad has its own website dedicated to its inappropriateness.
The commercial was meant to promote “Veggie Love,” featuring scantily clad women caressing and handling various vegetables. NBC’s concerns over women “rubbing [their] pelvic region with [a] pumpkin” led to its dismissal.
Although the content of the ad may not have been of the highest quality, PETA’s tactics were remarkably savvy. By making the commercial too hot for TV, it no longer has to pay the millions of dollars for a 30-second time slot during the Super Bowl. Instead, the commercial gets free advertising through the various news networks that covered the story of its ban.
This is not the first time PETA has provoked the news media to cover a controversial topic. Late last September marked PETA’s campaign to replace dairy milk with breast milk in Ben & Jerry’s ice cream. PETA argues that this move would be beneficial for the health of humans and cows because milk from “The Breast is Best” for humans, so why not put it in the ice cream? 
We encourage PETA’s controversial methods of advertising. By creating notorious commercials, PETA gets free press and still manages to get its message across to a substantial portion of its intended viewers. As long as PETA remains dedicated to its cause and maintains a degree of moral decorum with its tactics, advertisements promoting “Veggie Love” get love from us.

Iceland has been enduring nearly constant protests since its government nationalized the banking system last fall, absorbing a debt several times the country’s gross domestic product. As the Icelandic public felt this crisis was poorly handled, it has called for the resignation of the government at the end of January. 
This was afforded to the public with the resignation of Geir Haarde, so it came to pass that at the beginning of Feburary, Jóhanna Sigurðardóttir took the helm as Iceland’s Prime Minister, at least until elections in May.
Sigurðardóttir is Iceland’s most popular cabinet member, and the only to see an increase in approval ratings in 2008.
We haven’t mentioned that she is a woman, and that she is a lesbian. We haven’t mentioned this because in Iceland, it hasn’t been an issue: The media hasn’t covered it, there haven’t been protests (at least about Sigurðardóttir’s sexuality) — and Sigurðardóttir has been active in the Icelandic government since 1978.
This indifference to Sigurðardóttir’s sexuality is not shared by the international media. Just as the United States’s election of Obama is frequently distilled to: “the United States elected a black man as President,” the media is now simplifying Iceland’s situation to their selection of the first openly gay leader of the world. 
Sigurðardóttir’s rise to power should, and is, being supported and praised by the LGBT community internationally. Iceland has the practicality to focus on larger issues than the sexuality of its new prime minister, instead choosing a minister that the people would support as their government attempts to rebuild its banking system, stabilize its currency, and possibly join the European Union.
Iceland, as a nation and a people, has moved past gender and sexuality and toward judging its leaders by their abilities. We look forward to the day when America will focus on leadership ability rather than race or sexual orientation.

Hey Tartans,
As your student body vice president of finance, my primary role is to act on behalf of all funded student organizations to help maintain fiscal responsibility and ensure that your Student Activities Fee is allocated efficiently. These duties are carried out by the Joint Funding Committee (JFC). The JFC is composed of students who represent the Undergraduate Student Senate, the Graduate Student Assembly, and campus organizations. Throughout the year, the JFC and I have been hard at work on a number of initiatives.
During the fall semester, JFC conducted a comprehensive audit of all student organizations funded in the 2008 fiscal year. The audit looked at the funds that organizations were allocated by the JFC and compared that allocation to how each organization’s funds were actually spent. The goal of the audit was to see if groups were spending in ways that the JFC intended. We also wanted to ensure that the Student Activities Fee was being used appropriately.Another reason for the audit was to see if the JFC, as the primary funding source for student organizations, was allocating effectively. We found that we need to have greater oversight and ask more questions of organizations.
Another significant change has been an increase of the Student Activities Fee by 5 percent for the 2010 fiscal year, a motion that was passed by both the Senate and GSA. Two weeks ago, a deliberative loop was held to gain student feedback on the Activities Fee. Students were provided information prior to the event and were then able to deliberate and ask questions of a resource panel that included me and others with knowledge about organization finances. The loop was put together with much effort by Joanna Dickert, program manager for the Campus Conversations program.
Lastly, I want to talk about the spring JFC process. All budgets for student organizations seeking funding next year are due today, Feb. 9, by midnight. I have held four information sessions in the last couple of weeks to educate organization leaders on the funding process. This will be the JFC’s most challenging year yet with requests from over 170 student organizations. Along with this, a new and improved budget tracker has been developed and implemented. Check it out at http://stugov.andrew.cmu.edu/budgettracker.
If you have any questions or comments for me, the JFC, or the funding process, feel free to send an e-mail to sbt@andrew.cmu.edu. Have a great semester!
