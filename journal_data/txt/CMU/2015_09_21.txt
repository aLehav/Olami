On Saturday, the Carnegie Mellon football team took on the Washington and Jefferson College Presidents. The Tartans lost by a score of 38–14, dropping to 0–2.
The Tartans went three and out on their first drive. The defense, however, prevented Washington and Jefferson from scoring, stopping them on a fourth down. The Tartans got the first score: a 51 yard touchdown run by sophomore running back Sam Benger. The defense quickly recorded a three and out, and Benger again broke free for a long run. The tide began to turn as a pass from senior quarterback Andrew Hearon was intercepted. 
The Presidents moved forward play by play, earning a touchdown and tying up the score. On the next drive for the Tartans, Hearon missed on a pass intended for senior wide receiver Graham Shilling that could have been another touchdown. Instead, the Tartans had to punt. The Presidents then scored a long touchdown and took the lead before the end of the quarter.
In the second quarter, junior safety Samer Abdelmoty recorded an interception, but the Tartans’ offense couldn’t capitalize off the turnover. The Presidents proceeded to score once more, but this time the Tartans’ offense responded with an 85-yard touchdown run from Benger. The Presidents attempted to get into the endzone once again on a long drive, but were held to a field goal. 
The Tartans missed their field goal attempt on the ensuing drive and went into halftime down 24-14.
In the third quarter, the Presidents defense afforded no opportunities for the Tartans, forcing them to punt at the end of all their drives. Although the Carnegie Mellon defense largely did the same, the Presidents scored on a 37 yard touchdown run, extending the gap to 31–14. 
The Tartans became more aggressive with their plays, but could not score in the fourth quarter. One more touchdown from Washington and Jefferson sealed the game.
The biggest aspect of the loss was the passing game — or lack thereof. Hearon completed only 11 of 34 passing attempts, and a few key plays could have turned the tide for the Tartans.
“It was frustrating because there were opportunities to tie the game and take the lead, and we couldn’t capitalize,” Benger said after the game. “We need to play a complete game. We can’t just be good on offense or just good on defense or just good on special teams. We have to be firing on all cylinders.”
Benger recorded 303 rushing yards, a new school record for rushing yards in a single game, 96 more than the previous record.
The Tartans will seek their first win this year at Geneva College this upcoming Saturday.

Returning to campus this Saturday after a road win against The College of Wooster, the Carnegie Mellon men’s soccer team faced off against Bethany College as they looked to improve on their 4–1 record. The Tartans came out with a dominant performance, trouncing Bethany with an impressive 7–0 victory.
The game began with an aggressive back-and-forth between the teams, but the Tartans quickly established dominance as senior forward William Webb opened the scoring in the fourth minute, picking off a back pass and beating the keeper for an impressive unassisted goal. The Tartans applied pressure constantly, and were rewarded shortly after the first score when senior midfielder Stefan Dasbach put a shot into the corner off of a pass from first-year defender Jack McCambridge in the eighth minute.
After giving up two scores in the first 10 minutes, Bethany began to look frustrated with the situation and suffered a number of costly early penalties that could have been avoided — although the Tartans did have their fair share of penalties throughout the game, actually more than doubling Bethany’s eight penalties. The Tartans did not let up, maintaining a strong defensive stand and possession of the ball for the majority of the game, and  clearly controlling the pace of gameplay. Bethany had very few shots on goal throughout the game, and those shots on goal often went wide. The Tartans continued to maintain control of the game and, in the 27th minute, Webb scored his second goal of the night to put his team up 3–0 before the first half had ended. The Tartans continued to hold Bethany against the ropes and, as the first half was winding down, Carnegie Mellon put another thorn Bethany’s side as junior midfielder Devin Keane scored in the 43rd minute for the final goal of the half, leaving the score 4–0 as the teams went into intermission.
The second half opened in a more controlled fashion than the first as the first score of the half came in the 55th minute and sophomore forward Ryan Stinebaugh headed a ball into the top corner to give the Tartans an almost insurmountable 5–0 lead. There was no sense that Carnegie Mellon was going to let up their hold on the game, and Bethany was simply outclassed by the Tartans on the field. The Tartans began to run away with the game as Bethany grew increasingly frustrated with their inability to make a play happen. The game continued like this for the remainder of the second half, as Keane scored his second goal of the game at the end of the 64th minute off of a rebound save from first-year midfielder Zack Masciopinto. The final nail in the coffin also came from Masciopinto who, already being credited with two assists earlier in the game, made a shot off a rebound to put the final score to 7-0 in favor of the Tartans.
The Tartans will use the non-conference games in the next few weeks to improve their performance without the pressure of having the results determine the team’s ability to compete in playoffs. While this week’s victory against Bethany may have been convincing, there is always room for improvement.
The Tartans will remain at home for their match next week against the Westminster Titans, who, with a respectable 4-2-1 record, will look to put up a fight against the no. 17 Tartans. Whether the Carnegie Mellon men’s soccer team continues to be successful is entirely up to them, but for now it looks like they are poised for victory throughout the regular season. The match against Westminster will be Monday, Sept. 21, as the Tartans look to dominate once again on their home turf.

On Friday night, the Carnegie Mellon women’s soccer team set out to take on Grove City. After a goal shortly before halftime, Carnegie Mellon was able to hang on and pull out the victory. The team is still yet to give up a goal and remains unbeaten, upping its tally to four wins and a tie.
The match started as a slow affair. Both teams were able to get the ball deep into the other side, but there were very few chances to score for the two squads. That didn’t last long, however. Ten minutes after the start of the first half, Carnegie Mellon was able to put together some threatening attacks, which Grove City simply could not match. The Tartans were able to collect eight shots on goal in the first half. Several shots barely stayed within the keeper’s clutches, including one by first-year Kaily Bruch, which was just slightly deflected into the crossbar, preventing an early goal for the Tartans.
The rest of the first half of the game went decidedly the Tartans’ way, but they had nothing to show for it. Despite several very good chances to score, they all ended in near misses or simply fizzled out before Carnegie Mellon was able to capitalize.
Yet, with two minutes remaining before halftime, that changed. A deflection after a corner kick came to sophomore midfielder Haili Adams, who looped a shot around the crowd and the goal keeper, landing the ball in the net to give the Tartans a lead they would not relinquish.
The second half brought more of the same, as the Tartans spent much of the match after the break attacking Grove City’s goal. It appeared the Tartans had doubled their advantage after a shot found the back of the net, but it was called back for an offside. The flow of play strongly favored the Tartans, who had a myriad of chances and corners but failed to capitalize on any.
It seemed in the final minutes that Grove City might have found an equalizer. A miscommunication on a Grove City goal kick nearly caused a breakaway, but a quick recovery by the Tartans’ defense forced a shot from way out that ended up going wide. On another play, sophomore goalkeeper Sarah Mahler was able to save the match by her fingertips, deflecting a shot over the net. She quickly picked up the ensuing corner kick, and Grove City never got another chance.
The Tartans’ dominance was more apparent in the disparity of shots taken than by the score. While Grove City had some desperate heaves towards the net, they were only able to tally one shot on goal, compared with the Tartans’ 14 shots, nine of which were on target. Several corner kicks resulted in near misses as well. The 14-1 count showcases the dominance obscured by the 1-0 final. The Tartans spent much of the evening in front of the Grove City goal, while Grove City’s chances were few and fortuitous.
The Tartans proceeded to beat Frostburg State 3–1 on Sunday. Adams added two more goals to her tally, bringing her to three for the season.  Senior midfielder Carson Quiros added another goal, her first of the year.
Carnegie Mellon will continue its schedule on Tuesday, Sept. 22 as they take on Baldwin Wallace.

Anyone who followed the English Premier League last season knows there was a clear winner for the title of the Best of the Rest. Southampton FC sold half of their starting eleven, but quality replacements and brilliant management by Ronald Koeman meant that they finished seventh and qualified for this season’s Europa League. However, the bigger story toward the end of the season was Leicester City’s miraculous form to escape relegation. The team was at the bottom of the table for what seemed like the entire season before somehow rattling off seven wins in their last nine games to finish a very credible 14th at the end of the season.
There were several contributing factors, such as a stubborn defense, the upturn in form of attackers like Jamie Vardy and Riyad Mahrez, and some terrific performances from Argentinian legend Esteban Cambiasso in midfield. However, many felt that their offseason changes would hurt this team. Manager Nigel Pearson was fired; his eccentric behavior was thought to be harming the squad. Further, there was only one significant addition to the team in striker Shinji Okazaki. The “tinkerman” reputation of incoming manager Claudio Ranieri didn’t help matters. All concerns vanished, though, come the opening day of the season.
A resounding 4–2 win over Sunderland at the King Power Stadium was met with admiration by many. The excitement didn’t stop at the scoreline and the number of goals scored, though. The way the team played was admirable to say the least. Vardy looked just as menacing as a top level striker, harassing opposition defenders and taking his goal well. Okazaki dovetailed very well with Vardy in their first game together. Winger Marc Albrighton returned to the form of his early Aston Villa career which made him a man to watch for every fan in the Premier League. But none of them was the real star of the show.
The man credited with Leicester’s unbeaten run this season, which currently stands at 3 wins and 2 draws, is Mahrez. The Algerian international has been in nothing short of sensational form; most consider him to be the player of the season so far. While that accolade may have something to do with the generally slow start of several superstars on teams like Chelsea, Arsenal, and Manchester United, this takes nothing away from Mahrez— the quality of his performances genuinely merit the player of the year talk.
You don’t have to go too far to see how good he’s been. Just last weekend, Leicester was losing 2–0 to Villa until the 70th minute, when Mahrez took matters into his own hands. A gorgeous corner was gleefully flicked on by right back Ritchie Da Laet for the first goal, before a slaloming run through the Villa defense left several defenders in the cold and gave midfielder Danny Drinkwater the chance to lay the ball on a plate for Vardy to net the equalizer.
The moment of the match, however, came for the winner when Mahrez picked up the ball 10 yards into the opposition half, before launching an aerial through ball/cross towards 5’5’’ winger Nathan Dyer. The ball landed squarely into a (barely) square foot of space for Dyer to bravely head the ball into the goal. The vision to pick the pass, out of absolutely nothing, was extraordinary, but the accuracy with which the ball was hit was certainly world-class. Mahrez is a player to watch for the rest of the season. Because he’s only 24 years old, we could be watching him tear up the Premier League for a while.
Let’s also give credit to Ranieri for the seamless transition that he has seen through and for what he’s achieved with the players at his disposal. He retained several key members of Pearson’s backroom staff to ease the changes he would be bringing. Drinkwater and Andy King form a midfield that wouldn’t scare anyone, but the partnership of the combative Drinkwater and creative King has worked very well over the last few games. Their form has allowed them to also do some terrific business late in the transfer window as they signed midfielder Gokhan Inler from Napoli. The Swiss international was a first choice midfielder for Napoli in the Champions League for multiple seasons and will bring veteran leadership, know-how, and genuine star quality in midfield. That the Foxes are even attracting talent of that calibre is a testament to how they’ve grown over the last few months, while also admittedly emphasizing the spending power the Premier League currently enjoys.
However, it would be churlish of anyone at the club to simply ride this wave of form and goodwill and hope that Leicester will finish in the top half of the table at least. While they are the only other unbeaten team besides Manchester City this season and currently sit at a pretty second in the table, the Premier League can be a cruel beast. Rotation of key men will be required, although that’s a forte of Ranieri’s and so it should be of little worry for Leicester’s fans.
The more pressing concern is their defense. As good as their attack looks, their defense has been suspect. Defenders Robert Huth and Wes Morgan are terrific professionals, but are not the calibre of players that should be playing in central defense for a club that has such high ambitions and potential. Defender Jeffrey Schlupp is underrated, but they could use a little more competition for the full back spots as well. Kasper Schmeichel may not be as great a keeper as his father Peter or Leicester City legend Gordon Banks, but he does the job, at least for now. If City can keep the likes of Mahrez and Vardy from the clutches of the bigger clubs, they may have a solid foundation to build a terrific team over the years. Come May 2016, we may even call them the “Best of the Rest.”

Last Tuesday evening, an event entitled “Hackathons Demystified” was held by MellonHeads, a recently founded group at Carnegie Mellon dedicated to fostering collaborative work between individuals of various disciplines interested in education and technology. The event included speakers from Carnegie Mellon University and the University of Pittsburgh, including Po-Shen Loh, an assistant professor of mathematical sciences at Carnegie Mellon University and CEO and Founder of the educational technology startup Expii. Each of the speakers talked about a different aspect of hackathons, and the many benefits they offer to communities like Carnegie Mellon’s.
The concept behind MellonHeads was developed at the start of the spring 2015 semester. With help from individuals involved in various clubs on campus, including ACM@CMU and ScottyLabs, as well as Carnegie Mellon faculty, the organization was formally announced in February of 2015 at TartanHacks. 
Avi Romanoff, a sophomore cognitive science major at Carnegie Mellon, was the initial force behind the organization. “In the beginning, it was just me,” Romanoff said. “I planned and organized everything, and got companies — Google and Facebook, respectively — to sponsor our first two events. Over the summer, I created an online form for students to apply and be considered for joining the ‘core team,’ a sort of a title-less executive team, which has since become the organizing force behind MellonHeads.” Since then, MellonHeads has grown in size and popularity on campus, and continues to work towards bringing together innovative, passionate individuals across Carnegie Mellon.
The event last Tuesday embodied this collaborative effort, combining talks by students and professors of various disciplines. Loh began the event by discussing Expii, a startup that offers crowdsourced, interactive math and science lessons. According to Expii’s website, www.expii.com, the startup’s mission revolves around the belief that “high quality educational resources should be available to anyone, no matter where they are or what they can afford.”
Through talking about Expii, Loh also commented on the growing ability of individuals to create social change through technology. “The great thing that we have today is that if you want to go around an entire system which may or may not be difficult to penetrate through the bureaucracy, you can, because everyone has [a smartphone]. So if you wanted to, for example, do something to improve education you don’t actually need to go sell things to schools, you can just build something that goes right into the hands of everyone,” Loh said. “With Expii, that is actually what we do.” 
Loh concluded his talk by commenting on the potential benefits hackathons have to offer, noting that his experience with Carnegie Mellon students in class and at his company has revealed a pool of talent and an impact-driven culture that he believes would thrive and benefit from the hackathon experience.
The event continued with a talk from Romanoff, who gave an overview of hackathons in general, in an attempt to debunk some misunderstandings of what hackathons are and who they are for. Hackathons have exploded in popularity among college students and universities over the last several years. These caffeine-fueled competitions offer students interested in technology the opportunity to build anything within their means and imaginations in under 36 hours. These technological and intellectual showcases are attractive to students for good reason, as influential technology companies, such as Google and Facebook, often sponsor and attend hackathons to procure future talent. 
Generally, hackathons are perceived as events purely for computer programmers, yet Romanoff argued for a broader understanding of the term. “All ages, majors and experience levels are more than welcome,” Romanoff said. In an interview with The Tartan after the event, Romanoff expanded on this idea. “We’re spreading the hackathon ethos to as many students — and disciplines — as possible,” Romanoff said. “Why aren’t there hackathons for creative writing? Architecture? Improv comedy? Carnegie Mellon is home to incredibly diverse subjects and students, but there’s something that unites us through that diversity: our passion. Hackathons are celebrations of that passion, and we intend to spread them to every corner of our campus.”
Following Romanoff’s introduction, various members of the MellonHeads organization gave short presentations about the hackathon experience. Presenters included Laura Fulton, a sophomore engineering mechanics major, Russell Hawkins and Rajat Mehndiratta, sophomore electrical and computer engineering majors, and Tiffany Jiang, a sophomore design and human-computer interactions double major. The presentations dealt with topics of team building and collaboration lessons on how to demonstrate projects in front of a crowd. 
Additionally, Cyrus Tabrizi, Vasu Agrawal, and Edward Ahn, sophomore electrical and computer engineering and robotics double majors, spoke. These three students won this year’s PennApps, a hackathon hosted by the University of Pennsylvania, and spoke about building hardware devices as an alternative to building software. Spencer Baugh, a senior computer science major and president of the Carnegie Mellon computer club, and Oscar Bezi, a junior computer science major on the ScottyLabs board, also spoke about their respective organizations.
Looking forward, MellonHeads hopes to continue being an active force on campus. They are currently working to draft a constitution and gain official recognition as an organization on campus. In the mean time, they will continue to host events and work toward an inclusive, collaborative hackathon experience on campus.
Editor's Note: An earlier version of this article said that Avi Romanoff is a psychology major, rather than a cognitive science major.

For many in the United States, it is hard to imagine the struggles that residents of third world countries go through. Not only is there a lack of ways to efficiently filter and clean water in these countries, but there is often a lack of understanding about how to be healthy in environments with unsanitary water sources. According to UNICEF, over 663 million people are still unable to access clean water. Additionally, many of these individuals do not know basic principles of sanitation, which can ultimately have devastating health consequences. 
Researchers at Carnegie Mellon University, including Teri Dankovich, a postdoctoral researcher in the civil and environmental engineering department, are currently working toward finding a solution for these problems through the use of an educational book that doubles as a water filter.
Before coming to Carnegie Mellon, Dankovich completed her Ph.D. research at McGill University, where she dealt specifically with making antimicrobial paper. She found that when coated with silver nanoparticles, paper acts as a filter by destroying any bacteria that passes through the sheet. Since only a negligible amount of silver escapes into the filtered water, this method of purifying water offers major health benefits. Unlike other solutions that kill bacteria, such as chlorine, silver nanoparticles are relatively harmless since they don’t infect the water supply.
Since then, Dankovich’s work with paper filters has continued to develop. Most notably, an advertising agency known as DDB New York contacted Dankovich about her work and proposed the idea of “The Drinkable Book.” This concept revolved around producing a book made using the paper water filters, known as pAge drinking papers, with printed information about sanitation and water essentials. Since paper is relatively cheap compared to most filter devices, this book was designed to allow people in underdeveloped countries to not only access clean water at an affordable price, but also to educate themselves about ways to improve habits of sanitary water consumption.
This concept was not, however, simply theoretical. After partnering with the charity “Water is Life,” a video about The Drinkable Book came out in August 2014 and has accumulated more than a million views. Since then, there has been a great deal of progress made towards deploying not only the book, but also the water filters themselves, to actual places in need.
Most recently, Dankovich’s team of researchers traveled to Bangladesh this past summer to complete field testing of pAge. The trip was prompted by International Development Enterprises (iDE), an organization that focuses on helping those in underdeveloped countries gain access to necessities with little to no change in their cultural practices. The team focused on testing water quality from pAge and the reactions of Bangladeshis to pAge. Focus groups of men and women in different areas around Bangladesh were asked questions involving the design and the ease of use of these paper filters.
Angela Ng, a senior civil and environmental engineering and biomedical engineering double major at Carnegie Mellon University, was one of the members of Dankovich’s team. Ng explained that one goal of the trip was to determine how to implement the filters without altering the customs of the area.
“The people of Bangladesh gather their water in a Kolshi,” Ng explained. “But [iDE] didn’t want [Bangladeshis] to change their current water practices to match the current design.” Since Kolshis are pear-shaped containers, the flat design needed to be adapted to better suit the practices of Bangladeshis. In the end, the design that worked the best in focus groups was a paper filter that was shaped like a coffee filter. This design allowed the filter to easily fit into the opening of the Kolshi so that when Bangladeshis scooped up water, any bacteria present would be eliminated from the water supply.
Despite the success of The Drinkable Book, there is still a lot of research being done to improve the effectiveness of pAge filters. Although the paper filters are said to kill 99.99 percent of bacteria, there are still several concerns that need to be resolved. Ng, along with Jiajia Lyu, a masters student in the civil and environmental engineering department, is working on understanding these issues. 
Current research is focused on answering questions such as how long the filters will last, how long the ink will last, how parasites and waterborne pathogens react to silver, and what happens if more silver is added to the filters. More testing also needs to be done in order to meet the standards of the World Health Organization and the United Nations. However, to do this research, the dirty water samples collected in Bangladesh need to be recreated, which is quite a challenging task. “We have to add soil particles, sand particles, bacteria, and sea salt, monitor the pH, and so much more for these specific standards,” Ng said.
The future of the research is still uncertain. “Right now we’re discussing whether we want to be under full control of this, or if we want to form partnerships with organizations that are much bigger than us to help move it forward,” Dankovich said. Currently, The Drinkable Book is still undergoing further research and tests. Not only will lab research continue, but Dankovich hopes to do more field research. She plans to conduct a health intervention study by delivering the filters to communities and asking the users about their personal experiences with the product.
According to Dankovich and Ng, production of pAge filters in Bangladesh may begin sometime in the near future. However, there are still many complications that need to be worked out before anything official is decided. Dankovich hopes that in the future, pAge and The Drinkable Book will become commodity products in places all around the world that lack access to clean drinking water.

Stefanie A. Sydlik, a Carnegie Mellon alumnus, spoke last Tuesday as part of a seminar series hosted by the biomedical engineering department at Carnegie Mellon University. In front of a packed audience in a classroom in Doherty Hall, Sydlik discussed her extensive research in polymer science, materials chemistry, biomaterials, and electronic materials. During her presentation, she also introduced a biomaterial that may hold the key to creating new orthopedic materials, implants and devices that could help advance the field of orthopedics.
Sydlik was an undergraduate chemistry major at Carnegie Mellon, where she participated in research on electronic polymers that would lay the foundation of her career. She later went on to study novel triptycene and nanocarbon-based materials at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), where she worked towards a Ph.D. in organic chemistry in Professor Timothy Swager’s laboratory.
After earning her PhD, she spent two more years at MIT completing her postdoctoral fellowship in chemical engineering. Under the supervision of professor of chemical engineering Robert Langer, she developed a novel biomimetic block copolymer, which is a synthetic material that can be used for cartilage repair through the imitation of biochemical processes.
After spending nearly a decade at MIT, Sydlik was recently appointed as an assistant professor in Carnegie Mellon’s Department of Chemistry. Her past research prompted her to start working in a laboratory group that focuses on synthesizing novel polymers and materials. During her seminar, Sydlik focused on the many properties of graphene and carbon nanotubules.
Made of carbon, graphene is composed of sheets of benzene rings, which are molecular structures shaped like hexagons. Carbon nanotubules are rolled up, cylindrical sheets of graphene. Sydlik had an interest in these graphenic materials, as they could serve as biomaterials with the ability to repair damaged bone or tissue.
“They are conductive. They have very high mechanical strength,” Sydlik said. “And we wanted to tap into that.”
Her research inspiration came from her graduate study years when she was competing as an elite level rower. After hurting her shoulder, Sydlik was forced to discontinue the sport. Taking biomaterials classes at the time, Sydlik began trying to figure out ways that her shoulder could be repaired after realizing that no method currently existed that could be used to replace her injured cartilage.
“I started thinking about it, and [I] started to design a material that could be used for cartilage regeneration,” Sydlik said. “And this is what I focused my postdoctoral research on.”
Her interests in making a material that could mimic the mechanical properties of cartilage had led her to focus on the biocompatibility of graphene oxide, a derivative of graphene. Graphene oxide is made by mixing graphite, an inexpensive aggregate form of graphene and the principal component of pencil lead, and reducing reagents that strip away electrons from the graphite molecules. With its various functional groups which give organic compounds their unique chemical behavior, graphene oxide would be suitable for chemical manipulation, making the compound a desirable material for organic chemists.
When she started her postdoctorate research, Sydlik read a paper from another research university indicating that graphene is auto-degradable, meaning that after being soaked in neutral water for two months, it produces harmless decomposed organic matter called humic acid, which is the primary component of dirt. This discovery had important ramifications regarding the material’s biocompatibility, its ability to generate an appropriate host response when integrated into living tissue. “To me, there are a lot of questions about the biocompatibility of nanoparticles, but dirt is really not that bad,” said Sydlik.
Graphene oxide had already been put to use in various contexts. Previous studies used graphene oxide as a stimulator for normal growth and for targeted delivery. Sydlik believed that graphene oxide had potential for other uses beyond the previously completed studies. “Despite the volume of work, graphene has never been tested as an orthopedic material,” Sydlik said. “And most of the in vivo studies that have come out were not extremely thorough. They were missing pieces.”
After exploring gaps in prior research, Sydlik and her postdoctoral group found that graphene oxide demonstrated promise as a biomaterial, mainly due to its high compatibility in living cells. “[There] is this study that kind of suggested that the cells were really interacting with the functional groups, which would support the idea that if you can personalize graphene oxide, you would be able to change the behavior of the cells that were interacting with the [bio]material,” Sydlik said.
Solutions of graphene oxide were also injected under the skin of mice to see how the graphenic material would fare in living organisms. “We were actually surprised to find that the response we found was basically a classic foreign body response,” Sydlik said. “[The body] seems to be fairly happy about having graphene oxide implanted.” In addition, the rapid infiltration of graphene oxide by the immune cells led to fewer cases of chronic inflammation.
After proving that graphene oxide was “not so bad” as a biocompatible material, Sydlik and her laboratory group at Carnegie Mellon are trying to find ways to make the compound more friendly when implanted in the body as a material for bone regeneration. Through passion and creativity, Sydlik and her colleagues hope to make contributions to the field of biomaterials that will improve many lives through the intersection of polymer and materials chemistry and biomedical engineering applications.

This week at Pugwash, the Science, Technology, and Society club, we discussed the extent to which Google can control our thoughts and our decisions through how it orders its search results. The conversation also encompassed the question of whether or not we as Internet users are more prone to thought control in the digital media age. 
To begin, we tried to define how exactly Google could exert leverage over our opinions. We questioned whether the ordering of search results could sway us on certain matters. Some members stated that while it was possible that Google employees could order the results in such a manner as to encourage the company’s beliefs, it was far more likely that an algorithm could create an “echo chamber” for the users by choosing to display the results that most coincided with users’ opinions.
To bolster this point, some Pugwash members added that the Facebook News Feed — a source of news for many people — is heavily influenced by the “echo chamber” effect. Not only do people solely witness “news” from the monologues of their friends, who they most likely share beliefs with, but algorithms may be at work here as well to show only information that the user is biased towards. Thus, our initial conclusion was that these Internet giants could influence our thoughts via algorithms that provide us with the opinions we wish to see, perhaps subconsciously.
Next, the discussion turned economical and philosophical. Why should we take offense at these websites for presenting a biased source of information? First, all sources of news will be biased in some form. Second, the free market system allows these companies to present information as they wish. It is our jobs as individuals to choose to use other digital services if we are unsatisfied with the current ones. If, in fact, Google and Facebook do offer the superior product for information distribution, have they not earned the ability to have some say over what we hear?
These thoughts were bolstered by a participant’s claim that if Google did become too biased to be useful, then internet users would refrain from using the service. This implied that the free market system would act as a sort of “buffer” for Google’s potential biases. If the company did attempt to overreach to the point of misinformation, it would surely lose a sizable percentage of its users and be coerced into displaying more nonpartisan results. Nonetheless, this thought process was scrutinized by another member, who questioned at what point a product would be deemed not useful. It is fully possible, the speaker continued, that Google could provide one with seemingly useful results, while also subtly biasing the information. The original member concluded that the ambiguity of the term “useful” is the main danger in this argument.
Another more philosophical issue we targeted was the connection between power and attention. In our current world, where we place our attention determines who and what has power over us, one member said. Thus, in those few minutes that we scroll on our newsfeed to temporarily alleviate our ennui, we donate a piece of our mind to Facebook. While this point did not elucidate the extent to which these companies actually intend to affect our thoughts, it did accentuate how something as seemingly benign as our attention is at the root of control in the 21st century.
In defense of these companies, several members noted that echo chambers and social influences have existed long before the rise of the web. For example, think of someone remaining only in their own social group. Is such a situation distinguishable from a news feed made up of only like-minded friends? Furthermore, even before the foundation of the Internet, forces with ulterior motives also controlled the media. If anything, the Internet allows one more opportunity to explore uncomfortable points of views.
Tying these ideas together, a couple of members concluded that it was up to us to decide how much we let these products into our minds. Actions such as breaking up the companies will most likely be futile if we do not take the time to critically examine our sources of information and our own points of view.
Student Pugwash is a non-advocacy, educational organization that discusses the implications of science, technology, and medicine on society. This article is a summary of last week’s discussion on the ability of Google, and like companies, to sway elections.

September 2015 has been a month to remember for many firefighters in California as they try to subdue the three separate forest fires that are raging across the state. According to The New York Times, almost 8,800 firefighters are fighting against the flames that threaten the well-being of communities and local residents.
Firefighting techniques have been specifically designed to control fire and prevent damage, and firefighters hope they are effective in preventing an increase in the 270,000 already-damaged Californian acres.
In general, all fire suppression tactics begin with the identification and utilization of an anchor point, which is defined by the U.S. Forest Service as “an advantageous location, usually a barrier to fire spread.” This location allows the firefighters to “begin building a fire line and reduce the chance of being flanked by the fire.” A fire line is a break in the vegetation or combustible material that is able to stop or slow the spread of fire.
Once the anchor point is established, firefighters set up a command post and temporary fire camps that give fire crews an opportunity to eat, shower, and rest. Here, firefighters make many decisions about their strategy against the fire, based on the observations of fire chiefs, knowledge about the terrain, and a variety of quantitative measures. These measures include the Energy Release Component (ERC), which relates fuel energy potential to an area, the Burning Index (BI), which relates flame length to fire spread speed and temperature, and the Haynes Index (HI), which measures the stability and humidity of a fire.
Firefighters use a combination of direct and indirect attacks within the limits of available resources to stop a fire, change its direction, or slow its spread. A direct attack involves applying treatment, such as wetting or smothering, directly to a fire. In forest fires, this is achieved through urban and wildland fire engines, fire personnel, and, most notably, aircraft that apply water or flame retardants.
The aerial attack is often the first response to a forest fire, and aerial tankers are an integral aspect of firefighting tactics. The U.S. Forest Service owns and leases more than 1000 aircrafts each fire season, which costs the United States approximately $250 million per year. Aerial attacks come in various sizes, including helicopters fitted with buckets that can be refilled by being dipped in various bodies of water. Fixed-wing aircraft used for this purpose come in all shapes and sizes, from small agricultural sprayers that can drop 800 gallons, to the largest aerial fighter, a Boeing 747, that is capable of dropping 24,000 gallons. These carriers can drop either water or fire retardants over a large area.
Conversely, the most common indirect approach is to build a fire line completely surrounding the fire. This can be achieved by digging into the ground and creating trenches void of vegetation so the fire has nothing left to ignite. This strategy utilizes non-combustible material to prevent the fire from crossing these lines. Sometimes the line contains a natural body of water that the fire cannot pass.
Another indirect approach is to spray or drop fire retardants ahead of the fire to decrease the flammability of the land. Modern retardants include ammonium sulfate and ammonium polyphosphate, which can subdue the fire. These retardants also act as fertilizer to help with the regrowth of vegetation after a fire.
After a fire is under control, the threat is far from over. While the flames may subside, the vegetation can continue to smolder. This is a slow, low-temperature, flameless form of combustion similar to the way in which wood remains red after a fire has been put out. This type of combustion can easily spark another fire if not controlled. During this phase, firefighters continue cooling the regions of the land that are the most prone to smoldering.
While many of these forest fires span lowly populated areas of land, they can often spread into urban communities and threaten to destroy infrastructure. Fires on the wildland-urban interface require unique tactics and coordination between park and local community fire personnel.
The California wildfires have destroyed more than 1,000 buildings and have led to over 1,000 people seeking sanctuary in large refugee camps. Many inhabitants have fled, but thousands of brave firefighters remain, attempting to save the lives, communities, and precious land many people and animals call home.

Ultrathin invisibility cloak created on a microscopic level
Researchers from the US Department of Energy’s Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory and the University of California Berkeley have created an ultrathin invisibility cloak that conforms to the shape of an object and conceals it from visible light detection. The cloak works by rerouting reflected light waves away from the object so that the object cannot be optically detected when the cloak is activated. 
Currently, the cloak is microscopic in size, but the theory behind the cloak should enable it to be scaled up in the future. This technology could eventually be used for microscopes, computers, or security purposes. The researchers published their findings in a paper entitled “An Ultra-Thin Invisibility Skin Cloak for Visible Light” in Science.

Mathematical model predicts tsunami height quickly
After the 8.3-magnitude earthquake off the coast of Chile on September 16, more than 1 million Chileans were evacuated due to tsunami concerns. After the earthquake data was received, researchers were able to predict the height of the incoming tsunami using mathematical estimates of how earthquakes trigger tsunamis.
The researchers state that their method allows them to predict accurate tsunami forecasts in half the time as the current method, which would dispatch emergency resources much more quickly to areas in the most need. The researchers hope this will decrease the overall devestation caused by earthquakes and tsunamis. They plan to publish a paper in Journal of Geophysical Research: Solid Earth.

Rapid, recent decline in ocean’s wildlife populations
A new World Wildlife Fund report revealed a rapid decline in the ocean’s wildlife populations in the past few decades. Their Living Blue Planet report found that populations of marine vertebrates have declined by 49 percent between 1970 and 2012, with some fish species declining by almost 75 percent.
The report also states that the most prominent reasons for this decline are overfishing, habitat destruction, and climate change. “The good news is there are abundant opportunities to reverse these trends,” said Brad Ack, senior vice president for oceans at WWF. “Stopping black market fishing, protecting … critical ocean habitats, and striking a deal in Paris to slash carbon pollution are all good for the ocean, the economy, and people.”

Top iPhone ad-blocking app pulled from app store
This week, Marco Arment, the creator of the Peace app, pulled his ad-blocking application for iPhones from the App Store amidst its raging success. After its release on Wednesday, the $2.99 app jumped to the top of the charts since it blocks advertisements from popping up when users use the Safari web browser.
“Achieving this much success with Peace just doesn’t feel good, which I didn’t anticipate,” says Arment. In general, ad-block disrupts the way a website makes money, since websites often offer free content and service in exchange for running ads. “Ad blockers come with an important asterisk: while they do benefit a ton of people in major ways, they also hurt some, including many who don’t deserve the hit.”

Sound waves used to activate brain cells in worm model
For the first time, scientists were able to directly control a lab worm’s brain cells using sound waves. They used ultrasound to target specific neurons in order to make the worm change direction, and in order to amplify the sound, the worm was bathed in tiny bubbles.
The researchers reported their non-invasive way of controlling brain cells in the journal Nature Communications, and stated that it could help improve optogenetics, which uses light instead of sound. This could benefits neuroscience in particular. Since light cannot penetrate through tissue, “this could be a big advantage when you want to stimulate a region deep in the brain,” said Stuart Ibsen, one of the study’s authors from California’s Salk Institute for Biological Studies.

Researchers develop potential animal IQ test with robins
It is difficult to measure animal IQ because it’s difficult to design tests that measure overall intelligence instead of specific skill and the results largely depend on how motivated an animal is to perform. A team led by Rachael Shaw, an animal behavior researcher at Victoria University of Wellington, began experiments with New Zealand North Island robins to see if they could administer a successful test.
In a paper published online this week in Animal Behaviour, Shaw and her colleagues reported their results of how well the birds did when given proper motivation. They found a weak but positive correlation between how well a robin did on one test compared to its performance on all tests.

Last Tuesday saw the return of The Mindy Project not to our TVs, but to our computers. The show premiered its fourth season on the online streaming service Hulu.
In a perfect world, our favorite TV shows would run continuously, forever. We would never have to say goodbye to our beloved characters, or be left hanging with an unsatisfactory, last minute series wrap-up. Unfortunately, this isn’t a perfect world, and sometimes bad things happen to good shows.
Just a few years ago, low ratings and a cancellation meant the absolute end to a show. In today’s new world full of on-demand streaming sites, a network cancellation isn’t the goodbye it once was.
At FOX, The Mindy Project suffered from low ratings and an apparent lack of network support. This funny, offbeat show was often overshadowed by more prominent ones, leaving it in the dreaded cycle of low ratings, low support, and even lower ratings. Finally, after three seasons on the air and perpetual bubble status, Mindy was cancelled by FOX, and fans were left dejected.
In swoops Hulu with the save! After a few weeks of teasing and assurances that all hope was not lost, creator and star Mindy Kaling announced a partnership with Hulu that would bring the show back for a 26-episode fourth season. Episodes are to be released on a weekly basis, without the conflicts of sports or other programming that throw off schedules on network television.
The other big change is in terms of content. Kaling and the show’s team of writers are no longer bound by the same rules that officially (and unofficially) govern network television. She can be more vulgar, more direct, and more controversial and still have those aspects of the writing make it to air. But the show won’t go too far off the deep end, fellow writer and star Ike Barinholtz told the LA Times. “I think if we really changed the show too much and made it more risqué and put it more on a tilt of stuff you might find on HBO or Showtime, I think we would turn off our core viewers.”
This new freedom was apparent in season four’s first episode, "While I Was Sleeping." The episode makes a more direct homage to romantic comedies than usual, mirroring such classics as 1998’s Sliding Doors. Picking up after the season-ending fight with Danny (Chris Messina) about marriage, Mindy dreams up an alternate reality where they don’t share that titillating kiss on the plane in season two.
Joseph Gordon-Levitt guest stars as her husband in this alternate reality, where she discovers that without Danny in her life, she’s stuck in an open marriage and managing a business venture marketing “slutty girdles for the obese” — a far cry from her fertility clinic. Meanwhile, Danny has flown to India to come clean about their situation to her parents, where he ends up changing his mind about marriage as an institution. It’s a fairly formulaic plot line, with the predictable ending that has both of them reversing their positions — but winding up engaged anyways.
Along the way we get snapshots of what this new venture may look like. Characters have the freedom to be a little more direct in their crudeness, such as when Morgan (Barinholtz) claims he went to Pakistan first in his search for Danny, and that the Taliban attempted to recruit him. Not really offensive, but not-PC enough to be noticeable.
This week’s episode also went a step further than it had in the past about sexuality, making more overt references to sexual positions and acts than would have been allowed on a network. The question left in viewers’ minds is whether this is the new normal or if Kaling is just beginning to flex her new muscle.
Change is good, and Kaling deserves to have her writing and style be supported by her “network,” but going too far off the map could alienate viewers. For instance, this episode also featured a very heavy voiceover by Kaling’s character. At times, this was helpful since she didn’t have her normal people to bounce her thoughts off of. Here, the viewer replaced someone like Morgan or Danny, becoming the sounding board for her reactions.
At times though, the voiceover was just annoying and felt like a way for Kaling to push the envelope — even if she didn’t necessarily have to. At a few points, she even did so to the point of alienating her character, wondering to herself why Levitt’s character would want to “marry [her] fat ass.”
Kaling’s character has consistently toed the line of being self-confident, but also aware of her body issues. Throughout the show’s run, she’s made it clear that while she has insecurities about her weight, she also firmly believes that she is smoking hot and any guy would be lucky to have her.
So the idea that she would suddenly wonder why an attractive, wealthy man would want to be with her, simply because she thinks she’s fat, is unsettling to the viewer. Maybe, hopefully, this is a byproduct of what’s intended to be an internal monologue, which won’t be present for the rest of the season.
Change is good, and changing the content of the show’s writing could be great. But changing the tone and radically changing characters would be a disappointment.

From making appearances in late night TV shows to the GOP Presidential Debate, this has been a busy week for many presidential candidates. The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon had Donald Trump as a guest early in the week, who Fallon then vigorously mocked throughout the rest of the week. Fallon’s show also brought in Hillary Clinton after the GOP Debate and made even more fun of Trump. On Late Night with Seth Meyers, we have seen Bernie Sanders appear earlier this summer and Martin O’Malley this week.
Over on CBS, Bernie Sanders visited the Late Show with Stephen Colbert on Friday night, and Jeb Bush visited not too long ago as well. And in somewhat unrelated news, the Secretary General of the United Nations visited on Thursday night. So late night TV got very political this week.
It is surprising that Trump even agreed to appear on NBC, given its current disdain of Trump’s comments and litigious relationship with the candidate. Trump had sued NBCUniversal over the Miss Universe pageant because Miss Universe will no longer be televised on Univision or NBC after Trump’s offensive comments against Mexicans.
Trump continued his busy schedule this week with the second Republican candidate debate on Thursday where he said a bunch of crazy things no one should ever be saying about important topics, such as infant immunization schedules should be spaced out over a longer period of time with lower dosage shots, essentially nullifying the purpose of the immunization schedule. Ben Carson, a neuroseurgon, and Rand Paul, an ophthalmologist, both said basically the same thing, which is a little terrifying and quite interesting, considering they are both actual physicians that graduated from medical school.
Even though Trump was able to explain some things on The Tonight Show and get some laughs, his performance was nothing compared to Clinton’s. She handled the interviews with aplomb, showing her human side and ensuring that people understood that she is not “a robot.” The potential Democratic nominee also presented herself with her experience, knowledge, and capacity to become the next President of the United States. Even though general news channels have been portraying her as cold and calculating, Clinton has been able to showcase her mellow, jovial side and make fun of herself when she makes public appearances. For instance, Hillary poked fun at her “email scandal” by calling her emails boring and mostly procedural stuff. She also participated in a sketch that made fun of Trump, wherein ever-comical host Jimmy Fallon impersonated the Republican. Of all the candidates on late night television this week, Clinton is the candidate that I think benefited most from talk show appearance because she was funny, spoke clearly about her ideas, and had the crowd loving what she was saying.
Democratic socialist and Clinton-challenger Bernie Sanders had a good time with Colbert on The Late Show just shortly after Stephen Colbert began his tenure as host. Sanders’ interview was clear and simple, and he was able to dispel some of the negativity that surrounds the word “socialist.” He made smart comments that the crowd enjoyed and was able to showcase himself in a program that has a young audience, thus increasing his name recognition. Many people have been saying that Sanders has a long road ahead to defeat Clinton’s political machine, and if he keeps making appearances like these and continuing to expand his brand, he might just be able to do so.
The rest of the candidates who made appearances on talk shows, on the other hand, were not very notable and did not do anything strange or unexpected; they were bland and vanilla when compared to Trump, Clinton, and Sanders. While the presidential election will not be won on late night shows, interviews shot on these programs keep candidates in the public eye and go a long way toward humanizing politicians — individuals who have long time have battled the reputation of being lofty, disinterested, and overly sobering.

Don’t be shocked if early this Saturday afternoon you’re woken out of a hangover by the shaking of your bed. No, it’s not the Tyrannosaurus Rex from Jurassic Park or your housemate having some midday fun — it’s Oakland’s brand-new music festival. Oakland Fest, the area’s first EDM event, will invade the Junction Hollow Soccer Field in Schenley Park near South Oakland this Saturday, finally bringing some much-needed music festival madness to local college students. Music begins at 1 p.m. with a diverse lineup of D.J.s and live performing acts on the bill, including festival trap headliners Red Cup Nation from Los Angeles as well as local rapper GOAT Entertainment.
The artists billed for Oakland Fest cover a wide array of electronic genres, from deep progressive house to ratchet festival trap, as well as live hip-hop performers. The common thread running through all the acts is high energy, so definitely be prepared to do some serious dancing if you plan to stay for the whole event.
Dominique Monayong Jr., a senior information science major at University of Pittsburgh, is the head organizer of Oakland Fest. The event is sponsored by Head of the Glass as well as Aficionado Group, a local association aimed at “breaking barriers between universities and promot[ing] social events for college students,” according to their website. Monayong started Oakland Fest as a way to fill a deeply-felt void in the local community. “You have Pitt, Duquesne, and CMU all within a mile of each other, so you’d think there’d be more events where all these students come together and have a good time. It’s usually like a ‘Pitt thing,’ such as Bigelow Bash, or a ‘CMU thing’ like the Wilkins Block Party.” 
“So Oakland Fest is not a Pitt thing or a CMU thing or a Duquesne thing, it’s an Oakland thing,” Monayong explained.
In addition to bringing local students together, Oakland Fest is also geared towards bringing great live electronic music right into students’ backyards. A passionate lover of concerts, Monayong found that many of his best college experiences occurred elsewhere, outside of Pittsburgh, instead of at his own university. “I’d go to Penn State, West Virginia University, University of Maryland for concerts where they’d have people like Diplo playing and it made me feel bad a little bit. You shouldn’t have to leave your home area to have a good time, but it just seemed there was nothing good in Pittsburgh.”
Anyone passionate about live music, especially live electronic music, is familiar with this heartbreak. While many artists do come through, oftentimes it is during the middle of the week because this area doesn’t have the same kind of market that other college towns do. This can be very inconvenient, especially for Carnegie Mellon students where typically everyone is under a heavy workload. Even though Pittsburgh is a major metropolitan area, artists will typically hit here on a Tuesday or Wednesday and then play tiny places like State College or Morgantown on a Friday or Saturday night because of the large state universities in those towns.
In terms of the artists performing, Monayong said more than “90 percent are local,” with Los Angeles headliners Red Cup Nation standing as the only major import. Many are frequent local performers, including future house D.J. MSSV PR&CE, who is a resident D.J. at Peter’s Pub in Oakland. This focus on local talent can do a lot for the 
music community in the area by introducing these up-and-comers to a larger audience, as well as getting
students engaged with the music community.
Oakland Fest starts on Saturday at 1 p.m., with doors opening at noon. The festival is scheduled to end around 8 p.m. Tickets are $10, and can be purchased at oaklandfest.com.

Last Friday, the Canadian band Metric released their sixth album, Pagans in Vegas. This album was prefaced by a letter written to the fans with a short blurb on what to expect from each song. Before listening, I knew this was going to be an album that Metric really poured themselves into. It seemed like they were very honest with their lyrics and said a lot of things that they had been biting their tongues about.
The album begins with “Lie Lie Lie,” an alternative rock song that has anger dripping out of every word. Although I am not entirely clear on the meaning of this song, lead singer Emily Haines described it as something she wanted to say for a very long time. I think it was an interesting choice for the first song of the album because it starts off with very whiny vocals, and is overall probably my least favorite song. This song, in addition to “Too Bad, So Sad,” does not fit in with the smooth vibes that the rest of the album carries. “Lie Lie Lie” felt like a sharp punch that made me brace myself for a hard hitting alternative rock album that never came.
A few songs later, in came one of my favorites, “The Shade.” The album also includes an acoustic version of this song that really highlights Haines’ vocals, which sometimes get drowned out by the synthesizers. I generally gravitate more towards acoustic music, but between the positive lyrics and upbeat tempo I can’t help but love the original version of this song a little bit more. Some of the cheerfulness of the song is kind of lost when it’s stripped to its bare bones for the acoustic version. Something about the repetition of “I want it all” in the chorus keeps this song forever stuck in my head, but I don’t even mind it — it’s a testament to the song’s catchiness and appealing sound.
Another noteworthy song is “Other Side,” which features vocals from band member James Shaw. His voice in this song sounds like what sunshine after a long winter feels like. It’s light, heavenly, and a refreshing break from Haines’ very alternative sounding voice. I wish more songs on the album featured his voice. One of the best lyrics in the whole album is featured in this song when James says “And all we want is to feel like all we got/Didn’t cost us everything/Even if we never win.” This line really shows you how committed they are as a band to staying true to their roots and not forgetting about the fans that helped to get them to where they are.
This album also features two instrumental songs, “The Face Part I” and “The Face Part II.” “The Face Part I” is a typical, synthesized-instrumental turn. Something magical begins to happen at the end as classical piano music starts and a phone dial is heard followed by a voicemail box. This leads into the heart breaking ballad-without-words that is “The Face Part II.” These two songs are such polar opposites that it’s hard to picture them as two halves of a whole. I’m not entirely certain on what the meaning is behind the juxtaposition of these two songs, but it feels like “The Face Part I” is the beginning of a crazy, fun night and “The Face Part II” is how you feel at the end of the night after drunk dialing your ex and realizing that they’ve moved on.
Overall, I really enjoyed this album. Even if you aren’t a fan of new wave indie rock music, it’s definitely still worth listening to. I personally was not really a fan of this style of music and still found this album really enjoyable. It dips into new wave, but without being so overly synthesized that you’re not even sure if the voices are people or robots. It has some very captivating moments as the band takes us on a journey from angst to heartbreak to happiness and back.

At 8 p.m. sharp this past Tuesday, the darkness of Stage AE was split by a battle cry. It was the well-known shriek of a fan who was simply too excited to contain herself. The shriek soon grew into cheers and, as the music started, the audience began chanting to the lyrics. And all this was just for the opening act. Melanie Martinez, the main act of the evening, was still an hour away, but the tutu and animal ear clad crowd was ready to welcome her.
When I first stepped into the venue, I was disoriented. It was too early for Melanie Martinez to be going on stage, but the room was buzzing with energy. It turned out the enthusiasm was for Handsome Ghost, the opener. When they took the stage, they didn’t even have to warm up the crowd; people started dancing and singing along right away, and it was easy to see why. The band may be from Boston, but they have an all-American Midwestern charm that fans find endearing, and the good looks and excellent vocals of the front man seal the deal. Despite the enthusiastic reception, the band was down to earth and humble, happy to interact with the crowd. The guitarist, a plaid-shirt-wearing man reminiscent of a lumberjack with a raccoon tail tied to his guitar, happily wore a flower crown that was thrown on stage. Although they relied heavily on covers for their set, thus lacking a distinctive sound, their opening left no doubt that they are a band to watch out for.
After such a strong opening, a question hung in the air: could Melanie Martinez live up to that? From the moment she stepped on stage, the answer was clear. From her baby doll dress and bloomers to her two-toned hair, to the violent pastels of her set, Martinez was everything the crowd hoped for.
She skipped onto stage dressed as a baby doll and launched straight into the title song of her first and only album Cry Baby. She bounced around, alternating between the grace of a modern dancer and rigid, doll-like movements that were quite — there’s no other word — creepy. Backed up by two men dressed as teddy bears in front of giant letter blocks spelling out the words “Cry Baby”, she struck the perfect balance between childish cutesiness and adult experiences.
This tour, combined with the album itself, gives fans their first complete look at her artistic vision. Melanie Martinez first came into the public eye when she was a contestant on The Voice, doing acoustic singer-songwriter style covers of popular songs. The Melanie Martinez who took the stage on Tuesday night had done a complete overhaul of her musical style. Cry Baby is a series of candy-coated pop tracks with heaping servings of twisted childhood motifs. Songs like “Carousel” and “Tag, You’re It” feature lyrics about sexual assault and broken families told through common symbols of childhood innocence, over increasingly discordant snippets of music box and carnival music. The album is an exploration of modern coming of age, covering a plethora of issues, from beauty standards to mental illness. It is a conceptual album, going beyond the music to include an illustrated book in the style of children’s storybooks, that Martinez produced with a friend and funded herself, as well as music videos she conceptualized and directed.
Much like her lyrics, though, her work is not all rainbows and sunshine. At times the childish style can feel overused, the metaphors stretched. While it is important to have artistic vision, which Martinez clearly has, diversity keeps things interesting. Her inexperience also showed in the set list. All of her songs were performed live in the same order as they are on the album. The album is tied to a storyline, which is detailed in the storybook, so the order is important. However, the energy of a concert makes some flexibility necessary. The concert ended up losing some energy by the encore.
Still, the power of Martinez’s message and appeal should not be overlooked. Cry Baby only came out in August, but almost everyone in the crowd knew the lyrics to every song. The crowd, dressed in her trademark doll-style clothing and singing every word, was as much the focus of the concert as the headliner. To the backdrop of her bubblegum-bright songs, fans vented their own emotions, pressures, and experiences, as they screamed out the lyrics. Sure, they might seem a little crazy, but in the words of Martinez herself, “all the best people are.”

Mary Poppins to be featured in new original musical
Director Rob Marshall (Into The Woods, Chicago) has been attached by Disney to direct a new, original musical featuring the famous magical nanny, Mary Poppins. Marshall will work again with his Into The Woods producers John DeLuca and Marc Platt to adapt the further adventures of P.L. Travers’ beloved character for the screen. The new film will feature original songs by Marc Shaiman and Scott Wittman (Hairspray, Smash) with a screenplay written by Academy Award-nominated writer David Magee (Life of Pi).
It will take some time to get used to whoever is cast as Mary Poppins. To many, Julie Andrews is Mary Poppins, and Mary Poppins is Julie Andrews. The newly attached team, however, is creating much excitement for this update of an adored, iconic character. Disney seems to be lining up the right puzzle pieces for a great new musical.
King Kong makes moves from Universal to Warner Bros.
With Kong: Skull Island premiering in March 2017, and casting announcements happening all over the place, nobody could have anticipated a studio change. What does this mean?
First of all, what did Universal get in return? You don’t trade your franchise quarterback away and get nothing in return. Warner Bros. must have put up some serious talent for Universal to consider this move. Total speculation, but Universal Studios Hollywood is under construction on a “Wizarding World of Harry Potter” section to their extravagant theme park. Fantastic Beasts and Where To Find Them is set for a trilogy of films with Academy Award winners set to star. 
Additionally, Warner Bros. is working with director Gareth Edwards and screenwriter Max Borenstein to return for the sequel to 2014’s Godzilla, and now with the King of the Apes at their disposal...ladies and gentlemen, let’s get ready to rumble!
**Justin Timberlake set to star in animated Dreamworks musical Trolls **
There are certain things in this world that simply belong together: Spaghetti and meatballs, Peanut butter and jelly, Justin Timberlake and an animated musical based on those Troll dolls. Pure magic. JT will lend his voice to “Branch”, described as a “hilariously hardcore survivalist” in this upcoming animated adventure film. Timberlake joins Anna Kendrick, who will voice “Princess Poppy,” and film director, Shrek Forever After veteran, Mike Mitchell. 20th Century Fox is developing this one, which is set for release in Nov. 2016.
Bryan Singer announces 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea as next project
Director Bryan Singer (The Usual Suspects, X-Men: Days of Future Past) took to his Instagram account to give us some big news: he just turned 50! Oh, and he’s finished a draft of a script adapting the famous Jules Verne tale of Captain Nemo, the Nautilus, and the giant squid. Singer is still wrapped up in post-production for the next installment of the X-Men series, X-Men: Apocalypse, but has 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea lined up next. X-Men fans need not worry. Singer wrote: “...Not abandoning the #xmen universe. Very excited about #xmenapocalypse and beyond.” The project does not have a home yet, but I anticipate a sea-battle between studios to grab hold of it.
** Transformers writers’ room lays out future plans for franchise**
The Transformers franchise is one of the sure-fire money makers in today’s cinema. Unfortunately, that doesn’t say much about the quality of these films. After the fourth installment, Age of Extinction, Paramount and Hasbro tasked a number of writers with developing the future of the franchise. Led by Akiva Goldsman (A Beautiful Mind), the writers have emerged with details regarding Transformers 5 and beyond. Goldsman is set to develop an idea into a script for the fifth film, starring Mark Wahlberg reprising his role as Cade Yeager and Michael Bay directing, though Bay is not yet confirmed. 
I thoroughly enjoyed the first Transformers. It was the right blend of action-comedy and sci-fi for a summer popcorn flick (and I will sing the praises of Shia LaBeouf until he no longer deserves it). I’ve got to admit, though, that I’m off the train. This is like someone calling themselves a fisherman because they caught a trout one time. You’ve got to keep catching trout, and Michael Bay and Paramount have been reeling in water since Revenge of the Fallen. I’ll be keeping my ear to the ground for more news about this, and I will hold out hope.

Dearest Josh,
I am a sophomore in the BXA program for architecture and computational biology, and I am in dire need of some sweet, sweet assistance. Last year, I was intensely devoted to my school work — so much so that I neglected to make or foster friendships, so I find myself rather isolated this year. I went to the Activities Fair this year to try and find a niche, and I ended up signing up for about 25 clubs and organizations. I went to every single first meeting, even going so far as to skip some of my classes so I could attend these events. Long story short, I’m now the president of three small clubs and the secretary of another, and I’m not sure what to do. I’m meeting so many people, doing such amazing things, and getting so crunk all the time. From an objective standpoint, it’s becoming a problem. What should I do to balance my growing social life and my schoolwork?
Earnestly, 
Balance Is Greatly 
Beyond Everything Reality has Taught Her Anytime
Dear BIG BERTHA
Balancing work and play is one of the most difficult challenges of being a responsible adult. Even I, in my infinite wisdom, have struggled and continue to struggle with it. My advice for you and anyone else who struggles with finding balance is to take a step back and ask yourself, “do these clubs enrich my life, or simply drain me?” That’s a pretty quick way to find out which ones are worth your energy and which are just taking up time. Also, since your majors are so intense, you may even have to say goodbye or become less involved with clubs you love. It’s all about you being the best you can be. Do what you love, and do what challenges you — you’ll find your niche someday.
Sincerely,
Joshua Brown.

Inside Out:
There is nothing Pixar loves more than a story about growing up. The animation studio takes us on this journey in Inside Out once again, but with an added twist. We follow a girl named Riley (voiced by Kaitlyn Dias) through a troubling time in her childhood, as she learns how to carefully traverse the ever-changing environment of her life. In the film, Riley’s emotions are adorably personified, and each emotion lives in her mind’s headquarters and maintains her memories and personality traits. Young Riley’s life is narrated by Joy (voiced by Amy Poehler,) when suddenly she’s picked up and moved from the Minnesota to San Francisco. The adventure begins when Riley is forced to start a new life in this unfamiliar town. We begin to see how Riley handles Fear, Anger, Disgust, and, most notably, Sadness (voiced by Bill Hader, Lewis Black, Mindy Kaling, Phyllis Smith, respectively) as she slowly starts to understand the complexity of her emotions while adapting to new friends, a new town, and a new school. Watch the rest of the movie and see how Riley pushes forward in an attempt to make new memories and find normalcy in her changing life, comforted by the assistance of her many emotions.
Me and Earl and the Dying Girl:
Based on the novel written by Jesse Andrews, Me and Earl and the Dying Girl takes you on a dramatic roller coaster of emotions with a little comedy along the way (but heavy emphasis on the drama). It takes place at a Pittsburgh high school, where Greg Gaines (Thomas Mann) is forced by his parents (Connie Britton and Nick Offerman) to befriend Rachel (Olivia Cooke) after she is diagnosed with cancer. Greg, Rachel, and Greg’s long-time best friend and parody-film-making partner Earl (Ronald Cyler II), grow closer as the film progresses. As Rachel’s health declines, Greg spends more and more time with her and less and less time focusing on school. He and Earl begin working on a movie that Greg intends on dedicating to Rachel. As Rachel begins making difficult decisions about treatment, and Greg is forced to make his own difficult decisions about college, the weight of it all causes rifts within the friend group. The rest of the movie follows Greg as he struggles to remain confident in himself and his friendships.

Instead of staying in and watching Netflix on Friday night, I decided to venture out to find some of Pittsburgh’s culture. I had been invited earlier in the week to Trans-Q Live!, “a queer evening of performance, dance, poetry, comedy, resplendent fantasies, music, and so much more,” and I was not disappointed with my experience.
The atmosphere at the Warhol Museum set a perfect mood for a night of queer stories. Pop art by the openly gay Andy Warhol adorned the walls, and house music was playing through the lobby. Upon entering the theater, every audience member received a gift. Given out by the night’s emcee, Joseph Hall, they were 35 mm slides of various scenes: landscapes, abstract art, landfills, bulldozers, houses, and more. Joseph made everyone feel welcome and brought a number of audience members up on stage to dance before the scheduled programming began.
The transition into the main events happened so smoothly that I did not notice it happening. Joseph was interacting with the crowd, which filled the entire theater and had quite a number of Carnegie Mellon students, and led us all in a series of affirmations, including “Yaaaaaaaaa -breath- aaas, I am everything.” After we were properly affirmed, he brought up Kai Hunter to guide us all in singing the classic, “This Little Light of Mine.” However, we were encouraged to replace Satan in the last verse “I won’t let Satan blow it out” with any of our oppressors or a generic term that covered all oppressors: “I won’t let assholes blow it out.” And with that, we were off.
The next act was a performance piece by choreographer Jasmine Hearn and filmmaker Alisha Wormsley. Against the back wall, a film played with various repetitions of the word “black,” as though it were on an old television screen. Rickety projector noises and mournful music provided sound as the image switched on and off. On stage, Jasmine and Alisha performed a haunting dance in sheer white tops and long black skirts. Their movements were spastic and rigid, and their facial expressions gave a clear indication of inner pain despite the outward appearance of needing to perform well. The final moves were in the front of the stage, eyes looking out into the audience, as their arms twisted behind and they struggled to maintain composure.
As the lights dimmed on Jasmine and Alisha’s performance, a new film started up. Entitled “Sloppy Kisses,” it contained a cheerful song listing off what the singer didn’t like, with each verse culminating in “I like your sloppy kisses.” The visuals were a combination of the singer dancing in fields while wearing a frilly dress, a wig, and makeup, and silhouettes of two sloppy kissers, including some intense tongue-on-tongue action. Overlaying the whole film was a series of brightly colored, glittery filters, often looking as though glittery fluids were being dripped onto the screen. The transition from the previous performance’s seriousness to the light-hearted cuteness of “Sloppy Kisses” was an abrupt but welcoming emotional release.
Following in the same vein as “Sloppy Kisses,” Cindy Crotchford was our next delight. She came on stage in heels and a rainbow-sequined strapless dress, while lip-syncing “Walk Like a Man.” After struggling to keep her dress up for a few verses, Cindy eventually drew it down and stepped out, revealing a beaded bra and panties to the crowd’s delight. As “Walk Like a Man” ended and “Trashy” started up, Cindy pulled out false breasts from the bra with a wink and shrugged it off, as well as tossing off her blonde wig to reveal a head of long, black, natural hair. By the end of her performance, the underwear had gone as well, leaving only a small grey thong covering her body.
After Cindy strutted off the stage, another film was played. Beginning with a quote about body worship, the film was a more serious look at our obsessions with the human form. With an aesthetic reminiscent of Warhol’s work, “Neo Joe Pop” incorporated a series of stills and short clips of one nude male body in a variety of poses. In all of them, the model seemed to be striving to meet a certain look or expectation, and there was always shading or color blocking done over the top in a pop art style.
Rounding out the first half was singer and songwriter Bell’s Roar from Albany, New York. They performed a handful of songs with a guitar and a strong, deep voice regarding race, gender, and sexuality. Initially there were a few hiccups, but once they got into a groove, things went smoothly. “I’m still getting used to singing and playing at the same time,” they explained with a sheepish smile. “I usually just pre-record the instrumentals.”
Intermission offered a chance to speak with some of the performers and discuss the acts with friends, but it was almost uncomfortably long. We were excited when our emcee stepped back up to the stage.
This time, however, Joseph was not introducing anyone. Instead, he read a story about his own childhood, focusing on his relationship with his parents in particular. One question was a motif: “Do you know that moment when you realize your mom is not the person you thought she was? Well, maybe you don’t.” After describing his childhood through various anecdotes, it became clear that Joseph never knew his father. He got in touch with his biological father just before he died and thought about going but wasn’t ready. The story ended with the same motif: “Do you know that moment when you realize your father is not the person you thought they were? Well, maybe you don’t,” making it clear that Joseph’s mental image of his father was never shattered by reality.
Up next was an act that made “Sloppy Kisses” and Cindy Crotchford seem tame. “BLOWJOBgif” was a dance performance in front of a film explicitly illustrating men engaging in all sorts of sexual acts. The single dancer and background music gave vivid impressions of the intensity and pleasure in the filmed experiences. This was not the first time full nudity had been presented in the show, but it was the most serious and sexual of all the visual depictions.
After the solo performance, a male-female pair took the stage. Wearing long headcovers, they began dancing in synchronicity before pulling off their veils and splitting ways while still performing together as a pair. Their intensity was palpable, and their shirtless performance gave clear view of the beauty of the well-trained human form. Similar to the first dance piece, the pair evinced a sense of struggle, ending sprawled on the floor while fading out to black with the phrase: “Can’t go back.”
Although “BLOWJOBgif” may have been the most visually explicit act, visual depictions are not the only means of portraying graphic materials.The penultimate performance was spoken word from Bekezela Mguni. Many of Bekezela’s poems resonated strongly with black feminist power, but the last poem was my favorite, which described encounters with her lover. The words spilled from Bekezela’s lips in a reflection of the bodily effects being described, and the powerful poem had many shifting in their seats, whooping and clapping at the more arousing portions.
To round out the night was an act that continued on the sexual theme but strayed into the humorous side. The Bang Gang performed a little skit and song, aptly titled “Psychedelic Cowboy Moon Dance.” Nudity, pig people, and sexual acts ensued. As another theater-goer remarked, it wasn’t particularly artistic, but I didn’t mind. The refrain of the song, “Men and pigs are often mistaken, but you won’t find me fuckin’ bacon,” offered a comedic end to the evening.
Trans-Q Live! billed itself as a night of queer fun, and it lived up to its promise. From serious art to raunchy comedy, there was a little something for everyone’s tastes. The event is a non-regular but repeating occurrence, so keep your eyes out for the next opportunity to explore performances regarding all things queer.

U.S. Secretary of Education Arne Duncan, accompanied by other noted officials involved in the education sector, ended his sixth annual “Ready for Success” back-to-school bus tour at Carnegie Mellon University on Friday. Secretary Duncan’s main initiative with this tour has been to reach out to schools in the United States, and share his thoughts on where the president’s cabinet stands on the state of education in this country. Secretary Duncan assessed the past efforts of the department and where that will take the department in the future, touching on the challenges the nation still faces.
Students at Carnegie Mellon come to realize the growing importance of education in today’s world, and the student body’s appreciation of it to leads to successful, fruitful lives. By addressing the issues of college access and affordability, and promoting a discussion about the efforts we can take to remedy them, Secretary Duncan believes he is helping the nation move closer to a better, brighter future.
Upon his arrival, Secretary Duncan was greeted with music by the Pittsburgh Public School Drum Team, which is mostly comprised of young students with diverse backgrounds. The rest of Kirr Commons was filled with many Carnegie Mellon student onlookers, who happily waved to the panel upon their acknowledgement, as well as graduate and post-graduate individuals involved in the education sector.
With this talk on education, Secretary Duncan’s hope was to nourish students’ thoughts on their own path to success, and how they correspond with their current positions on said path.
Executive director of the Garble Foundation Gregg Behr talked about the use of science and technology in the classroom for this very purpose, and how interactive learning has aided in the retention of information. As a result of this, Behr said that studies have shown there to be a “doubling of algebra learning over a school year” as well as a five-time retention rate increase in the sciences by increased physical interaction.
Carnegie Mellon University students have privileged access to world-class education. This privilege, however, and the desire to take advantage of it, is rare in the modern United States; according to the latest figures by the Atlantic, only a third of 27 year-old citizens in the United States have an undergraduate bachelor’s degree or higher.
Duncan’s lecture plays into a national conversation on how to improve the state of US education, and the litany of available but underused education resources. 
Pittsburgh public school superintendent Linda Lane noted just how important Advanced Placement (AP) exams are for high school students, and how this resource has been underutilized for a long time. Over the last five years, AP exam participation in the Pittsburgh area has increased by 49 percent, and the African-American student participation increased by 220 percent. These impressive numbers received an enthusiastic applause from the audience. AP exams have been shown to be a substantial indicator of high school success, and Pittsburgh’s rates are moving in the right direction.
One audience member noted that tests are an important factor for assessing our knowledge, but it is important to note that they are certainly not the only measurements of our intelligence — simply a major factor that is easy to measure. 
Other factors, such as children’s attendance rate, their interaction with others, and their cooperation in and outside of the classroom, should also be taken into consideration when assessing a child, Lane said.
No discussion of education can avoid the topic of teachers. According to Secretary Duncan, three key features should be instilled in all teachers: knowledge of the content they are teaching, a heart full of compassion for their kids, and cultural competency. This was in response to a question about the immigrant population at certain schools.
“Teachers should reflect the diversity of our nation’s students, and our nation’s students today are majority minority,” Duncan said. According to him, teachers should be able to teach all children, no matter their culture, background, or state of being. Without these wide-ranging perspectives, certain children benefit more than others.
One of the major milestones of a good education is graduation. High school graduation is usually considered a day signifying freedom, adulthood, and independence — a very memorable day for some people.
It is often viewed as failure in the United States if a student does not achieve enough to get to this point, but high school graduation does not have to be the end of their educational journey. “You can’t just drop kids off at graduation and hope they make it to postsecondary [school] if they told you they were going,” Lane said.
Lane believes that parents shouldn’t remove themselves from their children’s lives and and hope for the best at this point. If anything, this is a time when young adults need support and guidance more than ever.
Many amazing things can come out of teamwork and collaboration, and these are believed to be two necessary components to improving education in America. Secretary Duncan and his guests are prime examples of teachers who have put an incredible amount of time and energy into their students’ education.
We are a part of a country that is always looking forward, and it is through the quality education of our younger people that we will achieve extraordinary things, knowing that the next generations will be prepared to continue the journey we leave behind.

On Wednesday, as life on Carnegie Mellon’s campus went on as per usual, business executives, professors, and entrepreneurs from around the globe congregated in the McConomy Auditorium to celebrate the 25th anniversary of the Carnegie Bosch Institute.
The occasion also marked the announcement of a new gift from the Bosch Group. The gift, a total of $3.5 million, is split between the David A. Tepper Quadrangle and an endowed professorship at the Institute. The professorship will receive $2.5 million, and the quadrangle will receive $1 million.
The Carnegie Bosch Institute, or CBI, was created in 1990 as a collaboration between the Bosch Group, which is based in Germany, and Carnegie Mellon University. 
According to its website, the CBI “has been pursuing its mission of improving international management and its impact on leadership by enhancing the knowledge and performance of managers and executives in global operations, as well as supporting academic research in the field.” With the Tepper School of Business’ international management track, the relationship between CBI and Carnegie Mellon has been ever growing.
Since its inception, the CBI has worked as a part of the Tepper School of Business to educate future leaders about the intersection between innovation and entrepreneurship. The celebration on Wednesday highlighted several of the achievements that the partnership has yielded, as well as the potential that the Institute has to impact the future of global leadership innovation.
CBS executive producer Brittany McCandless (DC ‘08) served as the mistress of ceremony, while notable professors and business people alike gave keynote speeches, conducted panels, and then performed lightning talks: six minute speeches followed by one question from the moderator. The talks ranged in theme from Innovating for Society to Trends for the Future: Impact on Global Industry & Management, Innovation in Global Markets, Technologies for the Future, Leading Entrepreneurship & Innovation, to Systems Integration for Sustainability.
In the final panel, three deans from Carnegie Mellon spoke: dean of the College of Engineering Jim Garrett, dean of the School of Computer Science Andrew Moore, and dean of the H. John Heinz III College Ramayya Krishnan. The panel was moderated by Mike Trick, the senior associate dean at the Tepper School of Business. The three deans spoke on the major changes that they anticipated would come to light within the next few decades of research and innovation within their fields.
Moore spoke about question and answer systems, the systems that humans use to answer questions. He said that within the past few years, the field has undergone an extreme change as humans turn more and more frequently to their cell phones to answer questions rather than relying on desktop systems. 
As the technology adapts, said Moore, humans will increasingly turn to their machines to answer questions that require intimate details about the inquirer — for example, knowing what medicine to take, or knowing what building the machine is in so that it can call the front desk for the user.
In Krishnan’s portion of the panel, he addressed innovative manufacturing, and how to move from point solutions to platforms by way of policy. 
Krishnan emphasized that this innovative manufacturing trend would be key in helping move manufacturing jobs back to the United States. In closing, the three deans emphasized that rather than considering the crossover between technology, innovation, and business — a dangerous trend that will likely put white collar workers out of a job —the United States in particular should be optimistic about options for the future. 
This is true especially in Pittsburgh, where the tech industry is growing by the day. Tech companies are making the city more and more of a hub for global entrepreneurship and business management solutions.
Tepper School of Business Dean Bob Dammon emphasized how important it is for Carnegie Mellon to be at the forefront of these fields and how thankful he is for the CBI to allow it to be forging the path in creating leaders for a complex world. Dammon called Carnegie Mellon, and particularly the CBI, the place where the new trends in business, technology, and data converge.
“Carnegie Mellon is comfortable with change because we are often the agents of that change,” Dammon said. “We are in a unique, good position.”

Being a CEO in the modern business climate is a daunting challenge. The global economy is constantly transforming, forcing businesses to change and adapt in an unstable market. 
In the current period of economic instability and decreased growth, many stress that change is the ultimate way to save the organization — otherwise companies face dying out.
This is exactly what David Farr, chairman and chair executive officer of Emerson Electric Company, believes. Farr visited the Tepper School of Business at Carnegie Mellon this past week to discuss business strategy reform, his successes, and his work as the CEO of a Fortune 500 company. Emerson’s original business model to sustain growth functioned very well from the year 2000 to the year 2012, but in 2012, the company experienced a significant decrease in sales growth. 
As a result, Farr changed the structure of the company and adjusted his business model to better suit a world of shrinking global fixed income.
Farr focused the new strategy on delivering better growth, broader customer solutions, more robust profitability, and higher returns. “Without growth, no company can make an earning in the long run,” Farr said.
The foundation of Emerson’s new business strategy is made up of the management process, the talent within the company, the technology, and the investments. 
The management process must be reworked every year to ensure the company’s growth. The talent in the company must be reallocated to its most optimal position; Emerson needs “the right people, in the right places, with the right resources,” Farr said.
In addition, global technology must be carefully monitored and updated to suit customers’ needs and to maintain the company’s leadership in the market. Some new technologies may be disruptive to older companies, so Emerson must understand new technological developments and be willing to adapt to the changing world. “Emerson is utilizing the key disruptive technologies of the 21st century to unlock new opportunities for growth,” Farr said.
Lastly, investments in Emerson help the company establish presence and strengthen its position in new markets. Historically, this was not a problem, as Emerson surpassed the S&P 500 in terms of economic growth, but the company has been shrinking significantly since 2014. Farr was therefore forced to change his business strategy and worked with his board to adjust the company. 
Adjusting the structure was complicated, because Farr could not base Emerson’s business model on global economic growth. 
Currently, global fixed income and worldwide economic growth is decreasing. Farr therefore strategically shrunk his company to better suit the market. He cut the company down from a $24.5 billion franchise to one of $16.3 billion, and Emerson consequently experienced a 2.4 percent increase in sales growth. Today, as a result of his strategic actions, Emerson is showing excellent growth. Farr went on to explain other strategic changes he implemented in his business model to ensure growth, and how the management held the company’s high position in the market. Mid-tier markets in Russia and India offer profitable opportunities for Emerson, Farr said. Emerson was once a very strong company in China, but other competing local companies started to form and take over some of the market. 
Therefore, Farr was forced to change Emerson’s market strategies or disappear completely from China’s market. He employed new strategies that would tie down the company’s upper tier and grow in the mid tier, thus keeping their position in the high tier and enabling Emerson to compete with other mid tiers.
Farr believes that to be a CEO, you must demonstrate that you can indeed be a leader and induce positive changes for a company. Before he became Emerson’s CEO, Farr urged the company to expand to Asia given the global economic changes that were occurring at this time. Now, Emerson still holds a strong position in the Asian market.
“To be a CEO, you have to make an impact, you need to demonstrate that you can make something big happen, not just sit behind a desk,” Farr said. Farr himself exhibits strong leadership and willingness to better his company for the future, concluding by saying, “I was given the keys to make this a better company for the next CEO.”

Next week, students will flock to the Jared L. Cohon University Center (CUC) for the annual Technical Opportunities Conference (TOC). During the conference, companies vie for students’ attention as they recruit for both summer internships and full-time employment opportunities. The TOC comes on the heels of last Wednesday’s Employment Opportunities Conference (EOC), which is geared toward non-technical majors, and Friday’s Business Opportunities Conference (BOC).
This year, the organizers of the TOC have made several changes to accommodate the popularity of the job fair. For the second year, the TOC will now stretch across three days — Monday Sept. 28, Tuesday Sept. 29, and Wednesday Sept. 30. On the first day, the fair will be in both the Wiegand Gymnasium and Rangos Hall; on subsequent days it will only be held in the gymnasium.
The TOC is a joint effort between the College of Engineering, the Society of Women Engineers (SWE), whose members start planning the conference during the spring semester. SWE is a professionalization organization whose goal is to "promote the image and success of women in engineering both internal and external to SWE, by providing resources for personal and professional development and a community that advocates diversity and awareness," according to their website.
Each year, the previous TOC committee — a group of ten students — selects two directors for the following year after sending out applications to the members of SWE. This year’s directors, chosen after a rigorous interview process, are junior materials science and engineering major Penelope Ackerman and senior electrical and engineering major Yiru Yao.
After all ten committee members are chosen, they are divided into four subcommittees: corporate relations, public relations, human resources, and operations. Each team works on its own timeline to ensure that the fall TOC runs smoothly. The corporate relations team, for example, begins reaching out to companies in the spring to get all interested employers registered by the early August deadline.
Nearly 500 companies are recruiting at the TOC, with a focus on students in technical majors. To meet fire codes, as well as to ease crowding in Wiegand Gymnasium and Rangos Ballroom, event organizers have changed the schedule and structure of this year’s TOC.
Each day, the TOC will be geared toward internships from 10 a.m. to 1 p.m. From 1 to 2 p.m. there will be a mandatory lunch break for the recruiters, and from 2 p.m. to 5 p.m. the fair will focus on students seeking full-time offers. This shift in strategy will “keep students flowing through, and staying within the numbers that we can have in a given space at a given time,” Senior Director of Strategic Programs and Special Projects for the College of Engineering Kelly McQuoid told The Tartan.
McQuoid, who organizes the TOC each year with help from the student leaders, said that the days will also be broken down by major. 
Monday is open to everyone, Tuesday will focus on computer-based majors, and Wednesday will focus on other science and engineering majors, including biology, chemistry, and all majors in the College of Engineering other than electrical & computer engineering.
Students attending the TOC will also receive name tags, color-coded by major, McQuoid said, so that TOC staff and recruiters can better help students find what they’re looking for. Because of this change, students hoping to attend must register for the TOC ahead of time on Tartantrak.
These strategies, McQuoid said, will help ease the long lines and overcrowding that have long characterized the TOC. 
In previous years, “Students didn’t feel like they could get in front of the employers that were there for them, because you might have a mechanical engineering company squished between Apple and Microsoft,” McQuoid said. “We’re trying to be aware and responsive to all sorts of different concerns.”
TOC organizers will also keep a head count of students in the gym at all times during the event, capping the number of students allowed in at once to prevent overcrowding.

Carnegie Mellon inventor awarded $500,000 Lemelson-MIT Prize
Earlier  in September, Carnegie Mellon professor and practicing materials scientist Jay Whitacre was awarded the prestigious Lemelson-MIT Prize of $500,000. The award is given to inventors whose creations are designed to improve the world.
In Whitacre’s case, this invention is the Aqueous Hybrid ion battery, which is an “environmentally-benign and cost-efficient energy storage system,” according to a university press release.
The battery is intended for use in a combination of solar and wind energy systems, and was developed using sustainable resources. Whitacre’s company, Aquion Energy, has full manufacturing and marketing capability, which will allow for world-wide distribution. One of the greatest challenges Whitacre faced was creating a storage system that did not rely on the presence of wind or sunlight.  What makes the battery groundbreaking is its ability to function as an energy source day-and-night.
This invention is far from Whitacre’s inaugural contribution to his field: he holds over 30 patents and pending patents, and has published more than 60 papers. 
In addition to his contributions directly to the Carnegie Mellon Community, Whitacre has been highly active in the greater Pittsburgh area, through his company’s involvement in multiple programs aimed at developing student engineers.
With a portion of his prize money, Whitacre plans to support and encourage graduate students who have an interest in pioneering energy solutions.
Carnegie Mellon, City of Pittsburgh help create new network to address challenges
In an effort to confront local challenges, Carnegie Mellon University and the City of Pittsburgh have combined forces. Using a $1 million grant, the duo plans to create the “MetroLab Network” — a national union that includes 20 urban areas and their neighboring universities. The goal is to develop and distribute new technologies that will tackle vital problems in these areas.The $1 million grant, courtesy of the John D. and Catherine T. Macarthur foundation, will be used toward the cost of hiring administrative personnel, including an executive director.
According to a university press release, University Provost Farnam Jahanian commented, “In the spirit of collaboration, Carnegie Mellon is excited to take a leading role in the founding of the MetroLab Network. This effort builds on decades of research supported by federal agencies, private foundations, and industry collaboration to create solutions that improve urban areas and provide real benefits to the public. We are eager to participate and work together with the other members of the network to develop and deploy technologies capable of creating a brighter future for our cities.”
The network will use data and various information technologies to understand how major cities work, and then apply this information to better them. The involved universities possess the technological knowledge to apply the research, while the urban areas will serve as real-life trial grounds.
The city will function as an “urban lab,” according to Pittsburgh Mayor William Peduto. The MetroLab Network is modeled off many prior successes, including multiple Carnegie Mellon contributions to the Pittsburgh area.

Hello! I am the Carnegie Mellon University Class of 2019+. In high school, I was a pretty big deal. 
I had stellar grades, for one, and I aced all of my standardized tests. I was valedictorian and student body president, captain of a varsity sports team and lead in the school musical. I started clubs, service organizations, and even my own company. I wrote for the school newspaper, created my own app, held a variety of internships, wrote research papers, and took service trips to every corner of the globe. On top of all that, I still found time for an active social life. I am intelligent, creative, and hard working — a perfectionist, overachiever, and role model in my community.  However, I am beginning to realize that I am not alone.
I look at my fellow students, and I see people who are just like me. They too were leaders in their high schools and standouts in their hometowns. They are incredible and intimidating, and it seems that they share all of the qualities that have set me apart up until this point. My achievements thus far no longer make me special. I am just one more face in the crowd. 
It can be difficult coming to a university like Carnegie Mellon. A person can simply look at decades' worth of successful alumni, renowned professors who are leaders in their fields, and current students with incredible achievements to know that this is a hub for innovation and academic success. While this provides amazing opportunities for students and staff, it can also feel overwhelming for someone new to campus. While first-years are used to being leaders — the big fish in their respective small ponds — they are now swimming with thousands of other big fish in what feels like an ocean. They are newcomers once again, adjusting to a culture much more competitive and intense than what they have previously encountered. 
In an environment such as this, it can be easy to lie low and fly under the radar. Why should a person try to stand out, be at the top of the class, lead an organization, or create something new when there always seems to be someone around the corner who could do better? What’s the point in trying to be special when you know that everyone around you is already special? Wouldn’t it just be easier to try to simply pass and graduate on time? After all, standing out at Carnegie Mellon takes an incredible amount of hard work, and even then, you might still be counted as just another overachiever. Is that worth the stress and self-doubt? 
Sure, aiming for average is an option. It is not, however, the option that any Carnegie Mellon student once took in order to be admitted here. There is so much brilliance, talent, and passion at this university that average is the last thing that comes to mind when thinking about it. Tartans are not built to be average. We are hardwired to push boundaries, make new discoveries, and grow as both scholars and people. 
So instead of aiming for average individually, I propose that we aim for greatness together. Yes, your peers may be smarter than you. They may be more talented than you, and they may have better ideas than you. Instead of resigning yourself to stand in their shadows, however, learn from them. Work with them. Even though you may feel inferior to those around you, remember that you are here for a reason — just like them. Allow them to push you to improve whatever it is you came here to do. After all, there is no room to grow in a small pond, but when you have the ocean to explore, the possibilities are endless. We have been granted this incredible opportunity to surround ourselves with extraordinary people. Take advantage of the resources given to you in your fellow students. They are not your adversaries, and their success will not diminish your own. Rather, their success can inspire you, encourage you, and teach you.
Hello! I am the Carnegie Mellon University Class of 2019+. I worked hard to get here, and I know that everyone else at this school worked as much as I did to get here as well. I am not alone. I look at my fellow students and see people who are just like me — passionate, smart, and motivated people whose hearts are in the work and who inspire me each and every day to be my best self. Together, we will push each other toward success.

What's round, lazy, and hanging out at a weird angle? No, it’s not a sloth. It’s the "e" at the end of Google’s new logo. It is trying so hard to stand out that it sticks out like a tomato in a bowl of fruit (unless you’re a biologist, of course!). 
According to the Harvard Business Review, “A company’s brand identity (who you are) and brand image (who people think you are) need to be in sync.” Google has not done that. The new logo does not represent the way that Google is perceived by the masses. The company gave up its distinctive serif typeface for a generic sans serif and an "e" that kowtows to the former logo. 
The original serif Catull BQ stood for sophistication and innovation, professionalism and playfulness. The new font, "Product Sans," is not bad, but it’s just that — not bad. However, it has lost its cutting-edge brilliance to a softer, rounder, play-school style, which makes it extraordinarily ordinary. Even if you prefer the aesthetic of sans serif over the previous font, the desperate "e" should still not be excused. 
Like all logos, Google’s has a story. Is it a bigger metaphor for rebranding the company? Rebranding was Google's chance to come up with a dramatic, abstract logo for its omnipresent brand. Is the schoolbook-style font metaphorically suggesting that Google is a child once again? Is the logo connected to a future growth plan? Is it an apathetic response to aggressive media scrutiny? 
The most cited story is that the logo had to be reinvented to fit smaller screens. Yes, sans serifs use fewer pixels than serifs. But screen resolutions are increasing at a phenomenal rate. If pixel usage is Google's only concern, then there is definitely a lack of foresight on its design board. 
“We think we’ve taken the best of Google (simple, uncluttered, colorful, friendly), and recast it not just for the Google of today, but for the Google of the future,” said Google in its official press release. Between the new logo and its new holding company Alphabet, Google seems to have lost its identity. 
Made to absorb Google’s subsidiary companies and refocus Google’s area of scope, Alphabet also seems to have influenced Google’s individuality. While Alphabet clearly implies the hierarchical relationship between the companies, it doesn’t set any boundaries between them. Except for the color scheme, their logos look practically the same. It’s boring. 
The sudden focus on simplicity and clarity sounds too similar to Apple’s “Simplicity is Sophistication” theme. Switching out a serif font for a sans-serif? Apple did that in 2002 for the sake of clarity, simplicity, and pixel count. Sounds familiar, doesn’t it? 
Google is supposed to embody intellectual dynamism and quirkiness, but its logo suggests an unassertive attempt at replacing the previous logo. Product Sans? More like product sans effort.

In the past year, over 200,000 refugees from Syria — which is being torn apart by the extremist organization ISIS — entered the European Union by way of Hungary. Last Tuesday, Hungary closed its borders, making it illegal and almost impossible to enter the country. 
It's easy to look at Hungary and criticize its response to the crisis. From the beginning, Hungary hasn’t seemed too willing to help refugees escape from the horrors of their home country. 
Last week, the trains that were supposed to take refugees from Budapest to Austria or Germany were delayed and rerouted, even after the refugees had already spent days living in the station with little access to necessities like clean water, food, or diapers. The media has been dominated by now-infamous scenes of Hungarian military personnel throwing sandwiches into a crowd of migrants and police clashes with migrant families. 
A Hungarian camerawoman seemed to encapsulate the national feeling towards the refugees when she kicked and tripped refugees running across the border while filming a segment. Overwhelmingly, it seems that Hungary does not view these people as people, but as animals. 
There is an obvious problem with how Hungary and many Hungarians have been treating the migrants, but the hard truth of the matter is that Hungary simply does not have the infrastructure and organization to deal with the crisis. Hungary is a relatively new member to the European Union (EU). It joined in 2004 with the promise of a vibrant, booming economy and better institutional organization, as well as the protection and support of other EU nations. So far, those promises have been slow to come to fruition. 
When thousands of refugees began appearing, Hungary simply was not prepared to run an organized operation. Its transit system could not handle the amount of people that were flooding it, not to mention the tricky business of maneuvering enough trains to reach Austria and Germany. In a perfect world, Hungary would have been able to help. Unfortunately, we do not live in a perfect world. 
Meanwhile in Germany, Syrian refugees were greeted with cheers, candy, and gifts from onlookers. The world was flooded with hope that perhaps refugees would be able to find a place that would welcome them with open arms. Germany had answered the call and criticized Hungary for its barbarism. 
Austria welcomed many refugees as well, and France has pledged to take on 24,000. It may seem that once again, the founders of the European Union have acted as saviors for the rest. 
In reality, however, the top EU nations are taking this as another opportunity to point fingers at Eastern Europe while doing very little themselves. Germany can easily look like a haven when it is the last destination for many refugees. Refugees in Germany have arrived at slower rates and many have already received emergency medical aid and food from less well-equipped nations. 
However, even Germany has now decided to close itself to Syrian refugees, imposing border controls that are a rarity in the European Union. The “Willkommenskultur”, or “open arms policy” that Syrian refugees were promised once they reached Germany is no longer. 
Meanwhile, Austria and the Netherlands — two nations with plenty of available resources — have also closed their borders, making it even harder for refugees to traverse Europe and reach a safety. 
The United Kingdom has, until very recently, ignored all calls for help from Syrian refugees and the rest of Europe. Its only meager response came in early September, promising to offer asylum to 4,000 Syrian refugees per year until 2020.  British Prime Minister David Cameron displayed a shocking lack of knowledge about the circumstances of the current Syrian crisis when he urged migrants to stop risking their lives by traveling to Europe and instead wait to be placed in Middle Eastern refugee camps.
Syrians cannot wait. They surely know the risks when undertaking this journey, but they have decided that the chance for a better life is well worth the risk of death, especially compared to the violent chaos in their homeland.
In lieu of developing a better strategy to handle the crisis, the countries of the European Union have fallen to blaming and criticizing each other. Germany criticizes the United Kingdom for not getting heavily involved; the United Kingdom accuses Germany of not being realistic about how many refugees to whom they can offer asylum; Austria criticizes Hungary and Croatia for not doing more to organize the refugees when they first reach the EU. Germany closes its border, supposedly to handle the organization of people currently in the country, but in reality as an effort to force other nations to take more refugees. The entire world criticizes Hungary for collapsing under the systematic pressure and chaos. 
Criticizing and blaming each other will never work. If the European Union hopes to truly offer Syrian refugees a new home and a new hope for the future, they must band together and cooperate.

Last Tuesday, North Korea claimed to once again begin expanding its nuclear arsenal. North Korea has had nuclear weapons for some time, and its possession of these weapons is often presented as a negative test case for nuclear deals with “rogue states,” such as Iran.
A quick look into the history, however, reveals that the opposite is true. The Agreed Framework, the nuclear deal former president Bill Clinton made with North Korea, actually prevented the birth of a nuclear North Korea until former president George W. Bush let the deal collapse toward the beginning of his presidency.
The Agreed Framework-based counterargument to the Iran Deal is compelling but improbable; the Iran Deal is unlike the failed Agreed Framework in that there are key differences between the deals and political situations in North Korea and Iran.
First, the collapse of the North Korean deal had little to do with the deal itself and everything to do with American inaction. In North Korea, the United States had an active role in the deal. However, because many were skeptical of North Korea’s faithfulness to the terms, the U.S. slacked on energy shipments.
Meanwhile, the Iran Deal only gives the United States a say in when to inspect Iran’s nuclear facilities. Since this deal is easier for the U.S., it will not collapse based entirely on America’s skepticism.
Secondly, North Korea has a very strong central government that heavily controls flow of information. This information comes from American intelligence, so take it with a grain of salt, but it does seem that North Koreans generally have less will for diplomacy and often view their government as infallible.
In Iran, meanwhile, there exists a real desire to connect with the West. There is also evidence that, despite American conceptions, the Iranian government actually is quite responsive to the people. The image of Iranian foreign minister Javad Zarif reaching out a sunroof to high-five throngs of thrilled citizens is stunning. The political engagement of citizens will empower moderates in the Iranian government, which will turn the country from a militaristic rogue state into a nation eager to improve conditions within its own borders.
Finally, the Agreed Framework did what it set out to do; it prevented North Korea from attaining nuclear weapons. Though North Korea publicly flirted with the idea of bombastically violating the deal, its first nuclear tests did not occur until after the deal crumbled.
Much more so than Iran, North Korea has long been a state inclined toward nuclear ambitions and cheating on deals. But America’s offer to help with North Korea’s severe energy problem was enough of a carrot to hold the country to that deal’s terms. In the same way, the Iran deal will lift the sanctions that have restricted Iran’s economy and infrastructure for 40 years, motivating the Iranian government to keep their end of the deal. 
While it is disconcerting that North Korea may restart nuclear tests, it is important to remember that American diplomacy once had that under control. China has strongly condemned the possibility of North Korean nuclear testing and will likely exert enough pressure to keep anything meaningful from coming of North Korea’s announcement, but the message remains the same. Diplomacy is a powerful tool. The Agreed Framework served its purpose, and it is time to give the Iran Deal a shot to do the same.

It's a bit ironic to think that technology companies are now providing security on our devices to protect us from an organization that calls itself the National Security Agency. However, with each day it becomes more clear that the interests of the government and the people have come into conflict. 
The government has decided that the Bill of Rights no longer applies to the Digital Age. This sentiment is beginning to trickle down to law enforcement organizations that now desire more data than ever for use in investigations. Since this trend will clearly continue to grow, it is time for companies to bring back privacy to their customers and ensure that encryption remains the key of freedom.
The problem with most forms of encryption is that they come with a key that is easily accessible by those in law enforcement and government organizations. However, companies like Apple are finally beginning to put down their foot. 
Since iOS 8, Apple has made it impossible to comply with law enforcement requests by storing encryption keys, associated with device pass-codes, locally on user devices. Though this makes it essentially impossible for Apple to unlock a device for a customer, it's equally difficult for the company to unlock a device for someone in law enforcement.
According to Apple’s page on privacy, 94 percent of law enforcement requests to Apple are device requests, while only 6 percent are account requests. This shows the true need for encryption. Law enforcement officials should not be able to access your entire digital life through a single request. If an investigation needs to be made, law enforcement requests should be limited to individual accounts or subsets of customer data.
As technology becomes a more integral part of our everyday lives, the need for privacy becomes more crucial than ever. Credit cards, fingerprints, health data, personal photos, bank accounts, location data, and other personal information now fill our devices. 
If full access is given to a user’s mobile device, the user can essentially be monitored at every moment by those holding the key. Because smartphones are now global, the threat that governments could take advantage of this has never been greater. Profiling and tracking of citizens is an extremely scary thing.
Wearables bring forth even larger issues. Unwarranted access to wearables would give law enforcement the ability track the heart rate and health data of users. This could provide officials with a broad-strokes picture of users' emotions, stress level, and how they are spending their days. It fills me with fear to think of what someone could do if they had a backdoor to the password combination of both my iPhone and smartwatch. 
While most officers have good intentions, it is inevitable that some will not. If law enforcement officers had backdoor methods of obtaining customer data, they could create social graphs of users and use them for discrimination. By profiling users, they could make assumptions about them based on race, class, or social connections; their privacy and freedoms would certainly be violated.
For most people, the operations of encryption happen on their devices without their awareness; programs such as FileVault on Mac are being presented more commonly to the user as the default option. 
Some companies have made leaps to protect customer data, and this should not be supplanted by any government body. People would riot the streets if they had to give a key to their house to law enforcement. But for some reason, the idea of giving a key to their encrypted data has not yet filled them with the same fear.

Last Monday, Ahmed Mohamed, a 14-year-old high school freshman, brought his homemade clock to school to show to his teachers. Rather than praising Mohamed for his work, his teachers notified the school of a safety threat. Mohamed was arrested, led out of his school in handcuffs, and sent to a juvenile detention center for bringing a "hoax bomb" to school.
Although it may be surprising to hear that a 14-year-old student was arrested for building a clock, it's unfortunately not as surprising to hear that a boy named Ahmed Mohamed was arrested for that reason. Ahmed Mohamed is one of many Muslims in the United States who have been treated wrongfully due to widespread Islamophobia.
What happened to Mohamed is sad and discouraging. In a world where a 13-year-old non-Muslim white boy can build a nuclear fusion reactor with the support and funding from his school, and "raise the bar for what young teens can pull off," according to CNET, we shouldn't let fear hold us back. Mohamed's case is an important step is recognizing our own biases and fears.
It is encouraging, however, to see some of the responses on social media supporting Mohamed. Some of the biggest names in tech have reached out and showed support, including experts from NASA's Jet Propulsion Lab, Reddit's co-founder Alexis Ohanian, and Facebook's Mark Zuckerberg. The President of the United States himself tweeted an invitation for Mohamed to visit the White House.
The outpouring of support in response to Ahmed Mohamed's arrest shows some hope for reducing and eliminating irrational fears of Muslims, which slow and sometimes even prevent progress. As Hillary Clinton said on Twitter, "Assumptions and fear don't keep us safe — they hold us back. Ahmed, stay curious and keep building."

Last week, presidential hopeful Senator Bernie Sanders (I–VT) — Jew, socialist, and staunch liberal — became the first democratic candidate in years to speak at Liberty University, the largest and most famous Evangelical Christian school in America. 
In his speech, Sanders frankly acknowledged the many ideological differences between himself and his audience. "It is very easy for those in politics to talk to those who agree with us," he said, "It is harder, but not less important, to try to communicate with those who do not agree with us."
Despite the fact that the average Liberty student would be horrified by his support for reproductive freedom and same-sex marriage, Sanders strayed from today's strictly partisan politics and sought common ground with those who would be his adversaries. 
To emphasize the need for greater income equality, he cited the Bible's famous "Golden Rule": "So in everything, do to others what you would have them do to you." 
"When we talk about morality, and when we talk about justice," Sanders said, "we have to, in my view, understand that there is no justice when so few have so much, and so many have so little." Jesus, according to Sanders, would be very far from an American Republican capitalist. 
By speaking to them in their own language, Sanders tried to reach the people most likely to disagree with him. Though such an appeal would realistically be hopeless, it's encouraging to see a presidential candidate willing to cross the harshest of party lines.  Sanders' visit to Liberty may have been strategic. Even if he doesn't convert a single Evangelical to his side, his cross-party appeal was just the right kind of admirable to attract more moderate supporters. 
It seems that most politicians today prefer to villainize and slander their opposition rather than cooperate for the common good. Sanders, as he has exemplified throughout his campaign, has shown himself to not be the standard candidate America has grown to tolerate. America needs politicians like Sanders to actually create a balanced, progressive government.

The Department of Education recently unveiled a new website that gives over 7,000 colleges in the United States an individual, detailed scorecard. The website, which can be reached at https://collegescorecard.ed.gov/, fulfills President Barack Obama's long-running effort to rank every college in America. 
On the site, the Department of Education shows detailed data about each college and university, including the average annual cost, graduation rate, and salary after attending. Although the data is based only on students who have received federal loans in order to pay for their higher education, the Obama administration's economists say that the data is generalizable. The trove of data is a valuable tool for seeing at-a-glance information about any U.S. college or university. 
The scorecard site also highlights many of the problems with the American system of higher education. Students of one of the eight Ivy League universities, for example, out-earn students at almost any other university. Harvard University graduates, for example, paid an average of $14,049 a year to attend the elite university and made, on average, $87,200 annually upon graduation. The Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) boasts the highest return of any U.S. college; students at MIT pay on average $21,816 to attend and make $91,600 a year after graduating. 
At Carnegie Mellon, students pay an average of $33,386 a year and make $72,00 a year when they graduate. These numbers are, by any metric, impressive, and well above the national average post-college graduation starting salary of $45,478. Still, we don't stack up with MIT, a school we consider our "peer institution." At Stanford University, too — another peer institution — students pay less than half as much to attend than students at Carnegie Mellon ($15,713), and make more upon graduation ($80,900). 
The disparity demonstrates that Carnegie Mellon lags behind its peers with regards to its financial aid policy. The university should strive to help more students afford a world-class Carnegie Mellon education by bringing down the average cost of attendance to match that of schools like Stanford, MIT, and Harvard. 
University President Subra Suresh is taking a step in the right direction with the newly-minted Presidential Scholars and Presidential Fellows program, but it's not enough. The administration needs to leverage our growing endowment to make financial aid a priority, and make Carnegie Mellon a true peer institution of some of the most well-respected universities in the country.

Being a hyperactive sign, Aries have the most sleeping troubles out of all the Zodiac signs. Their dreams are often very vivid and intense. Side sleeping is known to improve sleep quality. 
Sleep can be frustrating for Taurus if they are not comfortable. They are sensitive to their environment and tend to sleep best with company.
Gemini can survive off of fairly minimal amounts of sleep. Their minds are always racing, so sleep never comes easily. Many see insomnia as productive "extra" time. 
Because they tend to suffer from nightmares a lot, Cancer can have restless sleeping patterns. Drinking a glass of warm milk before sleep may calm the nerves. 
Most Leo are back sleepers who tend to drift off quite easily, unless they are stressed. They appreciate bedtime and love to sleep among luxurious sheets.  
Virgo cannot sleep if they are stressed or in an unfamiliar environment. Sleep may come easier if they use a white noise machine, which helps drown out background noise. 
Libra swing between not sleeping a lot and sleeping too much. They can spend days in bed and then suddenly survive off of minimal amounts of sleep. Balance is key for the Libra. 
Scorpio sleep is directed by their state of moods. An excited Scorpio will try to push off sleep as long as possible. An unhappy Scorpio will need a lot of sleep to become happy again. 
Sagittarius is similar to Scorpio in that their amount of sleep depends on their mood. They can survive off of small amounts of sleep, but usually exhaust themselves throughout the day. Excitement and restlessness at night usually keeps them awake. 
Capricorn appreciate sleep and try to get as much as possible. A stressed Capricorn will have trouble sleeping - insomnia is a sign of great inner distress for this sign. 
A mind full of thoughts can keep Aquarius up late at night. Winding down and practicing meditation can help soothe an Aquarius at difficult times. 
Out of all the Zodiac signs, Pisces need the most hours of sleep. Their receptive nature means they are drained by others, and sleep restores their lost energy.
