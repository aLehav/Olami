The women’s volleyball team played two neck-and-neck matches in Elizabethtown, Pa. on Saturday, losing both 3–2. The first match was against the home squad, the Elizabethtown College Blue Jays, and the second was against the Susquehanna College Crusaders.
In the match against the Blue Jays, the Tartans got off to a great start, winning the first two games of the match by a score of 25–15. They lost the next three matches 25–20, 25–17, and 15–12. Senior Aislinn McCloskey led the team with with 17 kills, with senior Caroline Size right behind her with 16 kills for the match.
The second match began with a Crusader victory over the Tartans in a hard-fought battle, 31–29. The Tartans won the next two games behind the defense of senior Cameron Griffin, who set a new school record in career digs during the match. While it was a special day for Griffin, the Tartans fell 25–20 and 15–13 in the final two games.
Griffin, a senior from Lake Forest, Ill., was so close to the digs record before Saturday that the Tartan players came into the game with it in the front of their minds. “It seemed like Cameron’s teammates were more concerned about her breaking the record than she was. They kept asking assistant coach Erica Rau how many more digs she needed when they were on the bench,” sophomore team manager Taylor Gaston said.  
Cameron contributed 16 digs in the first match and 22 in the second, which put her two digs past the program’s old record. With a lot of season left this fall, she is expected to significantly increase the gap between her new record and the broken record.
After this memorable weekend, the Tartans find themselves at 11–15 on the season, looking to come back from a rough weekend in Elizabethtown and get a victory against Point Park University today. The volleyball team also plays in the Wittenberg Tournament in Springfield, Ohio this weekend.

The Carnegie Mellon football team fell 27–21 in overtime on Saturday in a hard-fought game against the No. 7 Wittenberg University Tigers. The Tartans had one of their best performances of the season, but they failed to close out the game in regulation and could not top the Tigers in overtime.
“We did everything we had to do to win the game against a team of that caliber, but sometimes your best isn’t good enough,” junior safety Matt Bente said, summing up the game.
The Tartans got off to a hot start, with sophomore Jake Nardone scoring a touchdown on Carnegie   Mellon’s first drive after the offense marched 71 yards down the field in seven plays. Wittenberg fought back and scored two touchdowns to take an early 14–7 lead in the second quarter. Senior Justin Pratt tied the game up with a few minutes remaining on the clock before halftime, followed by a strong Tartan defense that shut Wittenberg down at the goal line to end the half. The second half saw similar plays to the first half, with Nardone scoring after a 63-yard Carnegie Mellon drive and Wittenberg quickly tying the game 21–21 behind the Tigers’ star quarterback Ben Zoeller, who threw for 276 yards and three touchdowns overall.
Carnegie Mellon had one final drive in the fourth quarter, getting the ball into the red zone and giving senior kicker Elliot Carnevale a 32-yard field goal attempt to win the game. Carnevale’s kick missed to the left and the game went into overtime. Carnevale missed a second kick in overtime, and Wittenberg took over and scored a touchdown to win.
Even with the loss, the men’s football team proved it could play with one of the better teams in the country. “Although we lost, we proved to ourselves that we can hang with a top-10 team. The game was still a good confidence booster leading into our last three University Athletic Association games,” junior cornerback Dan Miller said.
The football team was powered by a strong running attack on Saturday, recording 307 yards on the ground against a Wittenberg run defense that was ranked second in the nation going into the game. Leading the run game was senior Justin Pratt, who gained 137 yards and scored a touchdown. Nardone and sophomore Patrick Blanks also had stellar performances, with Nardone rushing for 90 yards and two touchdowns while Blanks ran for 91 yards. On the defensive side, sophomore Owen Parker led the Tartans with eight tackles; seniors Mike Shedlosky and Brandon Vantassel each recorded seven.
The Tartans look to rebound from this loss and finish out the season strong as they start UAA play in two weeks. They play at Washington University in St. Louis this Saturday.

Both the men’s and the women’s cross country teams at Carnegie Mellon traveled to Oberlin College in in Oberlin, Ohio to compete in the cross country Inter-Regional Rumble. The two teams emerged successful, with the women finishing fifth out of 24 teams, and with the men placing third out of 31 teams. The men’s team is currently ranked 13th in the country.
Finishing first for the Tartans in the 8k run was senior Dan Addis. He came in fifth in the overall race of 281 athletes with a time of 25:03.5. Fellow senior Nate Bussiere finished next, scoring 12th place in 25:31.4. Sophomore Evan Gates and first-year Mike Standish finished shortly after, with times of 26:08.7 and 26:12.9, respectively. Gates earned a 42nd place finish while Standish took 46th. Fifth on the team was junior Rob Morhard coming in at 66th place with a time of 26:27.6.
On the women’s side, in the 6k, highlights include a third-place finish overall from sophomore Emily Wobb, with a time of 21:55.1, followed by senior Courtney Baker, who came in 15th overall in 22:42.6. Coming in third for the Tartans was junior Christine Warner, who took 25th place with a time of 22:55.8. Rounding out the top five for Carnegie Mellon were seniors Laura McKee and Danielle Morse, who finished 57th and 79th overall with times of 23:31.7 and 23:56.7.
“Our team performed really well at Oberlin, as we worked together and also had some individual personal records,” Warner said. “Our tough workouts and dedication are beginning to pay off.”
The Tartans will be competing in the UAA championships hosted by New York University next weekend in New York City.
“We are all really excited for the UAA Championships in New York and for the opportunity to run our best races and to show that we have what it takes to compete against top teams,” Warner said. “We improve each and every day, so if we keep working hard, stay focused, and continue to motivate one another, we will have the opportunity to accomplish great things this season. We have our goals set high and believe that anything is possible.”

Having won most of its non-league matches relatively easily, the Carnegie Mellon men’s soccer team is now beginning to feel the tougher end of the season. The Tartans started off the year with a splendid 8–0 run and were ranked as high as No. 2 in the NSCAA/[SLANT12]HendrickCars.com[SLANT12] Division III rankings. However an unexpected loss at the University of Chicago on Oct. 2 was the beginning to a rather difficult month.
The Cardinal and Gray traveled to the East Coast during the mid-semester break weekend to take on University Athletic Association (UAA) conference rivals Brandeis University and New York University. In their first game, the Tartans were able to grind out a hard-earned victory against the Brandeis Judges. The score was level at zero at the end of 90 minutes. In overtime, sophomore defender Moni Sallam scored his first career goal and gave the Tartans a 1–0 lead off a gorgeous header. In the end, the single goal from Sallam was enough to get the Tartans their first conference victory of the season. Sophomore goalkeeper Zach Stahl performed exceptionally, making seven saves and earning his fourth shutout of the season.
Two days later, the team traveled to the Big Apple to take on the New York University Violets. The game proved to be rather physical and with few shots that tested the goalies from either team. The deadlock remained after fulltime, and the Tartans went to overtime for their fourth consecutive game. However, extra time was not enough for either team to make a difference, and the Tartans picked up their first tie of the season.
The men's soccer team is now 9–2–1 this season and 1–2–1 in conference play. The team was hoping to pick up some easy victories in the early days of October before taking on Emory University and Rochester University, both of which are ranked in the top 25 in the nation, in the next few weeks. Unfortunately no match comes easy when playing UAA opponents. Additionally, unexpected lineup changes from head coach Arron Lujan do not seem to have produced positive results.
The Tartans finish up the regular season with three very difficult and much-anticipated matches against Case Western Reserve University, Rochester, and Emory, but to Carnegie Mellon’s favor, all three games are at home.
The Tartans face Case Western Reserve this upcoming Friday night at 7:30 p.m.

The Carnegie Mellon U women’s soccer team has had a rough start in conference play. The Tartans stand at 0–4 in conference and 6–7 for the season.
The Tartans dropped a tough game to the Washington University Bears in a 4–0 decision on Oct. 10. The Tartans had five shots to begin the game before the 22nd minute of play, but the Bears’ Kate Doyle fed Allie Bentley the ball and scored on Tartan senior goalkeeper Anya Rosen, who tried to cut off the pass.
All three of the Bears’ remaining goals came in the second period. The Bears’ final goal came in the 88th minute, when Lee Ann Felder passed Jessica Johnson the ball. Johnson beat Rosen, who was charging forward, for her second goal of the game. Sophomore Brianna Magill’s three shots were on net and sophomore Lissie Arndt tried for two. The Tartans finished the game with 12 shots.
On Oct. 15, the Tartans dropped a 1–0 contest to the 23rd-ranked Brandeis University Judges. The Tartans had two shots on goal, out of four shots in the first half, but were unable to get them past Brandeis goalkeeper, Francine Kofinas.
In the second period, the Judges scored in the first two minutes of a corner kick, when Tiffany Pacheco’s corner kick bent into the net and passed Tartan first-year goalkeeper Anna Albi. The Tartans had three more opportunities to score, but Kofinas stopped them and delivered a shutout.
The Tartans took on the New York University Violets in New York on Oct. 17, losing in a 2–1 decision. The Violets stuck first in the ninth minute of play on a free kick from 25 yards out that hit just under the crossbar in the middle of the net.
The Tartans struck back with a goal from first-year Alex Venegas, who leads the team with five goals this season, two minutes later. Senior Alice Mayfield had the assist on the shot, which came from outside the box and made it in the top left corner. Junior Nicole Bayley’s shot on goal was saved by New York’s goalkeeper who dived for the save, which sent the teams tied heading into half.
In the second period, Mayfield almost scored to give the Tartans a lead, but her shot, which came within the first 10 minutes, hit the crossbar. New York was able to score once more in the 76th minute when Serra Tumay scored on a free kick.
Two Tartans attempted to even the score, but junior Elsa Wu’s shots flew wide and Venegas and sophomore Mitra Ebrahimi had blocked shots.
The Tartans have a bye week before they host the Case Western Reserve University Spartans on Friday at 5 p.m.

Three Carnegie Mellon tennis players — junior Laura Chen from the women’s team, and sophomore Duke Miller and senior Bobby MacTaggart from the men’s team — qualified for the ITA National Small College Championships two weeks ago held in Mobile, Ala. Chen took third place in her third consecutive trip to nationals, while the doubles duo of Miller and MacTaggart placed seventh.
In the eight-person draw, Chen was seeded first. She defeated Lisa Mertz from Hardin-Simmons University in the opening round in a three-set battle, 6–7 (2), 6–3, 6–1. In the semifinal round, Chen went head-to-head against Kristen Lim from Claremont-Mudd-Scripps College but fell in a disappointing straight-setter, 6–1, 6–0. Lim went on to win the tournament, losing only four games in three matches.
“It was a fun experience in Alabama,” Chen said. “I got to see a lot of good matches between players from other divisions. I think I had a good tournament overall; I’m happy that I was able to improve upon last year’s fourth-place finish.” On her tough opponent, a former Division I player for Cornell University, she said, “I think she has a lot of experience playing against top-level players from [Division I] schools, and that’s what makes her hard to beat.”
Miller and MacTaggart drew second seed Brian Pybas and Parker Larsen from the University of California Santa Cruz in the opening round, but they fell in a close three sets, 7–6 (4), 6–7 (5), 10–1. The two Tartans were unable to regain any momentum for their later match against Skidmore College’s Spencer Cheng and Jimmy Sherpa, and they were swept in straight sets, 6–3, 6–2. In their seventh-place playoff match, the Carnegie Mellon duo defeated a pair from the University of Wisconsin Whitewater, 6–2, 6–3.
The tennis teams have concluded fall play and will resume competition in the spring. The men’s team has an overall record of  3–2, while the women’s team has a overall record of 1–0.

For those of you that have been following the NFL this season, I’m sure that you have heard of the debate on the recent penalties for illegal helmet-to-helmet tackles. Just this past weekend, hits by Steelers linebacker James Harrison, Falcons cornerback Dunta Robinson, and Patriots safety Brandon Meriweather were highly scrutinized and the players were eventually fined thousands of dollars. Apparently, this was the final straw for NFL commissioner Roger Goodell, as he stated that helmet-to-helmet hits would now be reviewed for larger fines and possible suspensions. Although there has been much scrutiny from the players, the NFL is 100 percent correct on this situation.
Die-hard NFL fans and defensive players have been harping on one thing since the new policy: The NFL is making football a “soft” sport. This couldn’t be farther from the truth. Concussions have been on the upswing even with helmets, pads, and other protection becoming more available. This is mainly because the ability of the players has steadily increased with this added protection. Guys like Ray Lewis, Harrison, and others have brought in an era of huge hits, much to the dismay of highly priced players like quarterbacks and wide receivers. The game has become more violent since the days of leather helmets and no pads. Add this to the fact that Harrison said, in a Pittsburgh Tribune Review article last week, that “I want to hurt somebody. If you hurt somebody, they’ll be back the next play. I don’t want to see anybody injured. But I’m not opposed to hurting anybody,” and you realize that this is why measures need to be taken to protect the players that provide us with the most exciting sport in the world.
Where would the NFL be today without teams with dynamic passing offenses like the Indianapolis Colts? The game has evolved into a high-scoring, fast-paced, game. Oftentimes, I hear people complaining that low-scoring games are “boring” games. Protecting wide receivers and quarterbacks is much more important for the NFL, especially financially. Just like “roughing the passer” calls have become more common and enforced with a somewhat smooth transition, the NFL can transition with less helmet-to-helmet hits.
Defensive players like Harrison have come out swinging against this new policy, with Harrison even contending that he was “contemplating retirement” because he no longer knows how to play football. This is a joke. There have been countless times where a defensive player has made a huge hit on an offensive player without it being helmet-to-helmet. Take then-Eagles cornerback Sheldon Brown’s hit on Saints running back Reggie Bush in the 2006–07 NFC playoffs, and you’ll remember possibly one of the biggest hits in NFL history. However, it was a clean play, as Brown drove his shoulder into Bush’s chest as he caught the ball, resulting in an incompletion. Big hits can be legal, as long as the defensive player is careful about what he’s doing. As Robinson found out this past weekend, leading with your helmet puts you at a high risk for a concussion as well. Risking your health along with a fellow player’s health is never a smart play.
The recent policy change has brought focus on how the offensive side of the ball always gets the benefit with the NFL office. In an article from espn.com, Green Bay Packers linebacker Nick Barnett said it best: “I think they are headed in the right way of protecting players, but at the same time, where's the protection for the defensive players?” One of the main problems with the NFL is its reluctance to punish offensive players as severely as the defensive players. Oftentimes, offensive linemen and other blockers use “chop-blocks,” which is when blockers intentionally undercut potential tacklers in an effort to take their feet out from under them. This has caused plenty of season- and even careerending knee injuries, which is something the NFL has to address as well.
Along with this, the NFL has to realize that there are times when helmet hits by the defense are not actually the defensive player’s fault. Wide receivers have a tendency to lower their helmets for impact when they run dangerous crossing routes, which leads to incidental helmet contact, even if the defensive player is aiming for the chest. The NFL has to make sure that it can differentiate between hits that are out to injure players and hits that are just meant to break up the pass in a decisive fashion.
Overall, the NFL has it right with this new policy. There is clearly a need to put restrictions on players who seek to “hurt,” and to help protect players from having terrible post-career lives while they suffer from the after-effects of too many concussions. Now, if only the NFL changed the policy on not allowing good touchdown celebrations, then everything would be perfect.

Junior social and decision sciences major Terence Einhorn was recently honored by the University Athletic Association (UAA) as Golf Athlete of the Week for his performance at the Vulcan Invitational on Oct. 3–4. 
Einhorn placed 10th out of 80 participating golfers from various Division II and III schools at the tournament. Starting off by firing a 36-hole total of 142 on the first day, he continued his performance the next day, carding a 77. Einhorn finished the tournament with a score of 219 for the three rounds.
As a first-year, Einhorn had the privilege of helping the Tartans make it to the NCAA Championships for the first time in the school’s history. Reminiscing about his experience that year, Einhorn remembers how it felt to know that the team had a chance at the championship title. With that in mind, his goal is to get the team to the NCAA tournament again so they can feel the thrill he felt. Another goal Einhorn aims for is to keep up the academic reputation of the team. Last season, the Carnegie Mellon golf team won the National Academic Achievement Award, having the highest overall grade point average among all the teams in the nation.
“Golf is a mental and labor- intensive sport,” Einhorn said. “It’s an impressive combination to be able to keep up grades and play golf at the same time. We want to be able to continue playing well and maintaining our academic standards. If we can do that and get to the NCAA tournament, I can say I did my job as captain.”
This year, with several seniors who graduated and five new additions to the team, the Tartans entered the season with little knowledge as to how they would perform. Yet they started off strong, placing first at the Ohio Wesleyan Invitational on Sept. 7. As the season progressed, pressure built, leading the men to struggle to keep up their performance. Currently, they are working on fitting in as many practices as possible to prepare for their next tournament. 
The Tartans will hit the links next semester during spring break at the Bonita Bay Country Club in Naples, Fla.

In this game of Clue, there were two victims and hence, two culprits. On Friday, it was the Rangers who killed the Yankees in Arlington with clutch hits. On Saturday, the Giants slew the Phillies in Philadelphia with great pitching — and a clutch homer. 
The World Series is on tap to start fresh this Wednesday, with one team making its first World Series appearance and another in only its fourth World Series in the past 50 years. The Texas Rangers have already outdone themselves twice this October, first by taking the Division Series from Tampa Bay to win their first ever postseason series and then again by David-and-Goliathing the Yankees to double their historical postseason series victory tally. The Giants, who beat the Braves in the Division Series, entered the National League Championship Series (NLCS) as giant underdogs as they faced a Phillies team that steamrolled through the last month of the season and swept the Reds in the Division Series in convincing fashion.
Although I had previously predicted a Rangers World Series championship ("What was the name of that movie?" from Oct. 11 [SLANT12]https://thetartan.org/2010/10/11/sports/job[SLANT12]), the Yankees looked like the team to beat this postseason after sweeping the Twins in the Division Series with seemingly unstoppable pitching. In the American League Championship Series, though, New York ran into a Texas offense that would require much more effort to subdue, and it turned out that the Yankees pitchers didn’t have tranquilizers heavy enough to get the job done. The Rangers scored first in almost every game of the six-game series, and even when things got close, they found a way to claw back and put a pounding on Yankee relievers in the late innings. None of the Rangers’ victories ended up particularly close, as Texas outscored New York 15–1 from the sixth inning on in the Rangers’ four wins in the series. The pitching that had Yankees fans and haters confident that they’d get the job done after mowing down the punchless Twins more than met its match against a Texas offense that will surely give the Giants pitchers fits if they are the least bit off their game.
The Giants, on the other hand, continued to supply their fans with plenty of feel-good “torture,” as their style of baseball was deemed throughout the season. Their clinching 3–2 victory in Game 6 of the NLCS was the sixth one-run game they were involved in out of nine this postseason, and Giants fans may have had to start on their toenails after biting all 10 fingernails off by the time closer Brian Wilson struck out the Phillies’ Ryan Howard to win it. Torture won’t cut it against Texas, though, as even ace pitcher Tim Lincecum hasn’t been consistent enough this October to ensure that he will be able to quiet the Texas offense. After Saturday’s less-than-admirable performance, it’s doubtful that Jonathan Sanchez will remain the Giants’ No. 2 starter, and even with Matt Cain’s dominating performance in Game 3 of the NLCS, it’ll be a stretch for him to duplicate his success against a team that mashed Yankees pitching instead of the Phillies team that hit a collective .216 in the NLCS.
With hitters like Josh Hamilton, Michael Young, and a healthy Nelson Cruz and Vlad Guerrero to go with pitchers Cliff Lee, Colby Lewis, and Neftali Feliz, it’s hard not to finally pick these Rangers as the team to beat this October. The Giants will reprise their role as underdogs come Wednesday, but after grinding out a plethora of wins that proved critics wrong this season, it’s impossible to predict what will happen once that first pitch opens up the Fall Classic. There’s only one thing we know for sure: There will be excitement and surprises in every game, with good, fundamental baseball being played on both ends and clutch plays aplenty.
Make sure you’re tuned into FOX Wednesday night to watch it all unfold; besides, there’s nothing else good on Wednesday night TV anyway.

About 50 years ago, scientist Manfred Clynes coined the term “cyborg” in an article he wrote for the journal Astronautics. The anniversary of the birth of this term has provoked a great deal of debate about the future of cyborg technology. Clynes predicted that the term would be needed in a future where humans could use technology to try to surpass the limitations placed upon them by nature.
According to many who share his opinion, cyborgs are the next natural step in human evolution. One of the supporters of a future involving the creation of cyborgs is Kevin Warwick, a professor at the University of Reading in England who gave a lecture at Carnegie Mellon University earlier this year about his research with cyborgs. Warwick is a man qualified to comment upon the subject, as he can be called the world’s first human cyborg.
Warwick made this transformation in August of 1998, when he implanted a chip into his arm that allowed him to communicate with various objects in his office without effort. He can now open doors, switch on lights, and control the temperature of rooms through the signals sent out by the chip in his arm. The invention of the chip opened up a whole new world of possibilities for human interactions with technology. Up until now, humans have only been able to use technology that interacts with external devices in ways that keep it separate from the human body itself. In the future, Warwick believes that technology will rest inside the human body itself, going as far as to say to CNN that ordinary humans might become “a curiosity for the machines.”
Cyborg humans could indeed change the way we define life. NASA was one of the first organizations to realize how useful chips could be when it implanted chips into the first monkeys sent into space so that the chips could monitor their vital signs. Since then, the possibilities have only been increasing. Yang Cai, a senior systems scientist at Carnegie Mellon’s CyLab and the founder of the Instinctive Computing Lab, said, “Professor Warwick’s innovations will affect the scientific community and public [in several fields, including] instinctive computing, security ,and privacy.”
Climate change is another area where cyborg research can end up being useful, as self-adaptation using cyborg technologies could help humans adapt to the changing conditions on Earth. Medicine could also be greatly transformed with the advent of cyborgs, as doctors could use a variety of chips to monitor their patients’ health. Chips implanted into humans can also be a convenient alternative to various cards that most people currently carry around, such as credit cards and driver’s licences. In light of the research that Warwick has conducted, Cai said that Warwick had been “selected [by the Institute of Physics] as one of only seven eminent scientists to illustrate the ethical impact their scientific work can have.” This places Warwick among illustrious names such as Galileo, Newton, Einstein, and Oppenheimer.
The ethical impact of Warwick’s work is enormous. Cyborg technologies are challenging humans to rethink what it means to truly be human. However, there is much debate revolving around many facets of the issue. It is tough for many people to decide if humans with machine parts inside them can be considered machines, or just improved versions of humans. The more advanced technology becomes, the more the lines between humans and machines can become blurred. Furthermore, there is the potential for misuse of this technology by governments and corporations, who could potentially track the movements and actions of humans all over the world by simply hacking into the chips implanted into humans. In addition, if devices malfunction while inside human beings, they might cause physical harm, and Cai is sure that Warwick is “seriously concerned about the possibilities of [the] human neural circuit [being] damaged.”
For his part, Warwick is excited about the possibilities that have been opened up to him. As he says on his website www.kevinwarwick.com with optimism, “We don’t have an idea yet, but if this experiment has the possibility to help even one person, it is worth doing just to see what might happen.”

From a rickety instrument with long antennas that constantly had to be adjusted, the television has transformed into a device with great picture quality and the ability to receive signals from all over the world. Over the years, the television has been updated to enhance the viewing experience. Signals switched from over-the-air broadcasts to cable television, and then from cable television to satellite television.
Over-the-air broadcast
The earliest forms of signal transmission for television were over-the-air broadcast signals. Large antennas at broadcast stations would send radio signals that could then be received by smaller antennas installed on top of each individual television set. The biggest problem with such a system was that the signals could not be transmitted well over long distances or in locations surrounded by mountains or forests, because the radio signals would be very weak.
Cable television
Cable television was first used in the United States in 1948. According to the National Cable and Television Association’s website, towns located in remote valleys and on hills had a hard time capturing over-the-air broadcast signals for television and therefore were the first to use a form of cable television. Antenna towers were built on the tops of hills surrounding these towns, and the towers were connected to each home in the town through long cables. Since the signal passed through underground cables instead of through the air, it was not hampered by obstacles. A number of amplifiers were installed along the cables in order to prevent the loss of the signal over long distances. Such systems of antennas connected to cables were soon known as community antenna television (CATV) stations.
CATV stations gradually began to gain popularity: The antenna towers were able to pick up signals from long distances, allowing viewers to have a wider variety of television programming. According to www.howstuffworks.com, the next milestone in cable television came in the 1970s when a cable service called Home Box Office (HBO) introduced the idea of having paid channels on television. For this purpose, HBO began sending signals to a satellite orbiting the Earth. The satellite then transmitted the signals to dish antennas located in Florida and Mississippi. Cables connected to the dish antennas helped transmit these signals to individual homes. This new system of transmitting signals allowed for a much better signal quality and was gradually used all over the country.
Around the same time that HBO pioneered the use of satellites for signal transmission, fiber optic cables began to be used for carrying the signals from the CATV stations to individual houses. These cables prevented signal loss, eliminating the need for having amplifiers along the cable. Modern cable television follows the basic premises of the satellite and fiber optic cable technology described here.
Satellite television
Although cable television is still quite popular, today many are switching to satellite television. Satellite transmission works with the help of geosynchronous satellites, which move in sync with the Earth so their relative position with respect to Earth’s surface remains fixed. Individual dish antennas are installed by each user, and these can be adjusted to pick up signals transmitted by a particular satellite or group of satellites in the same area. Broadcast centers transmit the signals corresponding to different channels and programs to the satellites. The satellites then transmit the received signals back to individual dish antennas in the viewer’s home. The dish antennas transmit the signal to a receiver, which finally sends the signal to the television set.
As explained on www.thesatellitetvguide.com, satellite television provides many advantages over cable television, the most significant one being the wide variety of channels one can watch with satellite television. Satellite television also offers better picture and sound quality than cable television.

Nighttime can be unsettling: We hear noises that we cannot immediately recognize, and the most we can see might be the numbers on our alarm clock. But imagine waking up with a tremendous pressure across your chest — making it impossible to breathe — and seeing a black cat with a white inverted skull hissing next to your bed. And imagine being unable to move.
This terrifying experience was documented by Chris French, a professor of psychology at Goldsmiths College, of the University of London, who suffers from sleep paralysis. Sleep paralysis is a phenomenon that occurs when our mind remains aware as we start to dream.
Sleep can be broken down into at least five different stages. One of the most well-known stages is called REM sleep, which is when we have vivid dreams. REM stands for “rapid eye movement”; when a person is in this stage of sleep, his or her eyes dart around quickly even while they are closed. REM sleep lasts around 90 minutes, according to www.webmd.com.
During REM sleep, a person’s heart rate and breathing become irregular, blood flow changes, and regulation of the body temperature diminishes. In addition, the activity of certain neurotransmitters can be inhibited. Neurotransmitters are chemicals responsible for almost all actions of the body, including emotions, movement, and thought. During REM sleep, any motor activity that our brain monitors is inhibited and the activity of our muscles decreases to the point of paralysis. This phenomenon is called REM atonia, and it is responsible for the feeling of paralysis. If this were not the case, we would act out the motions of our dreams, a condition which has also been documented as a sleep disorder.
We fall asleep, or drift out of consciousness, slower than our brains can induce REM sleep, so it is normal for us to dream before we are fully asleep. However, this timing can sometimes be too far off, causing sleep paralysis. As a result, REM atonia can occur before a person is fully asleep, or while he or she is still aware. This is called hypnagogic, or predormital, sleep paralysis. Conversely, when a person wakes up before REM atonia is complete, hypnopompic, or postdormital, sleep paralysis may occur.
Sleep paralysis is an unsettling experience because a person is dreaming while awake. Many people have had dreams in which they lost the ability to run or move away from an unpleasant image; people experiencing sleep paralysis have lost this ability while completely conscious. According to a presentation by Susan J. Blackmore, a psychologist at the University of West England, a person might experience a sensation of floating and hear buzzing and humming noises. They may also feel intense fear and pressure on the chest. Hearing screams, laughter, and one’s name being called have also been reported.
These strange experiences can be explained by changes in brain activity during sleep. According to Ian Newby-Clark, a professor of psychology at the University of Guelph, when scientists studied sleep paralysis, they found that the area of the brain that becomes active when a threat is present is activated; therefore, people feel fear towards an entity that does not really exist. In addition, the muscles in our chest that make us feel like we can breathe are inactivated, so we feel as if something heavy is pushing down upon us. Scientists have attributed some sounds to muscle spasms in the middle ear, which is a part of the ear responsible for creating auditory signals that are eventually sent to the brain. Other sounds can be explained by interpreting actual sounds incorrectly, such as a ticking clock that may be heard in a dream as footsteps.
Some researchers have used sleep paralysis as an explanation of alien abductions or ghost sightings, since hallucinations of lights or moving shadows are common, as are feelings of movement and hearing the sound of a motor.
The biology of sleep is still mysterious, and that of sleep paralysis even more so. Still, there are a few methods a sufferer of sleep paralysis can try to reduce the frequency of its occurrence. Regular sleep patterns and a healthy amount of sleep have been shown to decrease instances of sleep paralysis. Irregular sleep patterns causes disruption of REM sleep, which can increase the chance of sleep paralysis occurring. In addition, a correlation between sleeping on one’s back and sleep paralysis was found. Substance abuse, such as drinking large amounts of alcohol before sleeping, can also induce sleep paralysis.
While sleep paralysis can be frightening, all of the dangers are truly in one’s mind, and it is a physically harmless experience.

Robots can replace American jobs
As robotic technology continues to improve, economists who have studied labor statistics and increasing job polarization — a growing disparity in pay among skilled and unskilled labor — conclude that robots are replacing many American workers whose occupations consist of routine tasks.
A study by David Autor, an MIT economist, conducted this spring found that certain occupations are more vulnerable to automation. The fall issue of GOOD magazine summarized Autor’s findings: “The middle class is disappearing in large part because technology is rendering middle-class skills obsolete.” Jobs in this country are increasingly polarizing towards high-skilled, high-paying jobs and away from low-skilled, low-paying jobs, and as Autor’s study has found, automation is a major factor. However, robots cannot build themselves, which means workers will still be needed to put them together.

Credit cards soon to get a makeover
Next month, Citibank will begin testing a card that has two buttons and tiny lights that will allow users to choose whether they want to pay with rewards points or credit — right at the register of almost any merchant. These cards, known as 2G for “second generation,” are no thicker than and just as flexible as conventional plastic, but they contain a battery with a four-year life expectancy, an embedded chip, and two buttons. Dynamics, Inc. is the company that developed this minicomputer-in-a-card.
Pressing the buttons changes the data imprinted on the magnetic stripe, so the card still works like conventional plastic and can be swiped through existing card terminals nationwide. Another Dynamics, Inc. card would allow cardholders to have multiple accounts, such as a corporate and personal account, on one physical card. The stripe-modifying technology was created by Jeffrey D. Mullen, the 32-year-old chief executive of Dynamics, who is also an electrical engineer and former patent lawyer who obtained his master’s degree in business at Carnegie Mellon.

Oldest object in universe seen
An ancient galaxy has broken the record for the most distant object found in the sky known to date. Light from this galaxy takes roughly 13.1 billion years to reach Earth, which also makes it the oldest known object in the universe. It is estimated that the galaxy was created only 600 million years after the Big Bang.
The galaxy, named UDFy-38135539, was seen by the Hubble telescope. Its discovery may provide insight into what the first stars were like and how they influenced the formation of the universe, researchers said. “This is the first time we know for sure that we are looking at one of the galaxies that cleared out the fog which had filled the very early universe,” said Nicole Nesvadba from the University of Paris-Sud in France.

Halloween Anecdotes
The best thing about Halloween in Pittsburgh...
Shruti Kataria | Special to the Tartan
The best thing about Halloween in Pittsburgh is going to Kennywood for Fright Night. Each year, Kennywood transforms its grounds into a haunted village with spooky rides, haunted houses, and terrifying grim reapers, clowns, and zombies strolling around. Fright Nights are Friday and Saturday evenings each weekend until Halloween, starting from the second weekend of October. Last year, my roommates and I, along with a few other girls (all of us equally terrified of anything that moves in the dark) went to Kennywood the weekend before Halloween. We spent three hours screaming our lungs out, being chased by dead men with chainsaws, and repeatedly going into haunted houses that left us pale. If you enjoy the strange rush in being horrified once a year like I do, go to Kennywood Fright Night!
My favorite Halloween memory...
Ryan Salvo | Special to the Tartan
My favorite Halloween memory is from when I was a kid. My friends and I used to go trick-or-treating around the neighborhood, and I would collect candy from all of the houses, hoping that I would get some of those non-chocolate Tootsie Rolls. I loved the vanilla ones and the fruity ones, and I would trade anything for them. One year, when I was a little bit older, I went trick-or-treating for UNICEF with a couple of my friends. Instead of collecting candy, I collected change from all of my neighbors to donate. When my friends and I returned home after a busy night, my mom suprised me with a whole bag of non-chocolate-flavored Tootsie Rolls. She thought I deserved a reward after working so hard for others.
When I was a kid...
Aurelia Henderson | Special to the Tartan
When I was a kid, Halloween was by far my favorite time of the year, not because of the candy, but because it was the one time that I was able to show off my rather impressive magic tricks and feel mysterious and dark. A psychic told me when I was about five that she could sense I had a “close connection with the spirit world,” which, to my young mind, did not equate to deep internal spirituality or relationship with emotion, religion, or the dead, but rather as something magical. 
I considered Halloween the time to dress as my “true self,” a witch who could kill you if she wanted with the scrunching of her face, but only chose not to out of her vast wisdom and maturity, realizing that being human was a lifelong costume to be worn. By the time I had surpassed this rather embarrassing stage of my life and thrown away my assortment of hats, cloaks, and brooms (although I did keep one for playing quidditch), the Harry Potter rage began in full force, making my once heartfelt beliefs seem somewhat more socially acceptable.
Last Halloween...
Zack Betka | Special to the Tartan
Last Halloween, I was actually at a regatta in Vermont for Carnegie Mellon’s crew team. It was kind of disappointing to be away for the holiday and then to be traveling the whole day back, but we had high hopes that we’d make it to campus in time for some celebration.
To make ourselves feel better, we decided to have some fun and celebrate Halloween during the regatta itself. And so, in the days leading up to the meet, we all went online and ordered Viking hats to wear during the race.
Unfortunately, our coach wasn’t a fan of us being Vikings while rowing, and so the hats stayed in the vans during the race. On the plus side, they made excellent costumes once we got back. And even though we were tired and sweaty from rowing all day, we made the best of our Halloween as Carnegie Mellon Vikings.

Attention Carnegie Mellon students: Prepare yourself for a zombie invasion! Zombies are taking over Pittsburgh in Evenings in Quarantine: The Zombie Opera, performed at the Grey Box Theater in Lawrenceville. If you are looking to get into the Halloween spirit, this show, which combines previously filmed images with live acting, will take you on a multimedia journey through the infected streets of Pittsburgh. The story follows three college students as they attempt to survive the infestation. Each character must come to terms with his or her priorities in life as they attempt to survive the living dead on their journey to a military-controlled safe zone. 
Creators Bonnie Bogovich and Elizabeth Rishel take a traditional horror plot and make it anything but ordinary. In this play, rather than scream, the actors sing, and they sing quite well. Don’t expect for any zombie to perform “The Monster Mash,” however. The vocals are utilized in the play to intensify the range of emotions that the characters must deal with when faced with a zombie apocalypse. Despite the dark themes that the plot explores, the show has a playful side to it as well. It was important for Bogovich and Rishel to create a show that had laughs and horror. The comic relief livened up the show and was a highlight for junior drama major Amanda Thorp, who enjoyed the wry news reporter who sang the news with a straight face and warned people, “If you don’t want to be zombie food, stay tuned!”
A range of musical influences were employed in the show to keep the audience engaged in the performance. Choir, techno, rock, and instrumental piano all came together to create a believable and engaging atmosphere. The impact of music on Evenings in Quarantine is appropriate, considering the fact that the show started with a song. Rishel originally wrote “Screaming,” one of the featured songs in the show, as a standalone piece. However, the song had such a backstory that Rishel found that she couldn’t contain the concept to one music video. Collaborating with Bogovich, the concept evolved into a collection of 10 songs and kept growing until eventually they decided to make it into a performance.
What makes the play successful is the spirit of the cast and crew and their obvious appreciation for the city of Pittsburgh. Special effects make-up designer Arvin Clay called the show “a love letter to Pittsburgh.” The filmed backdrop features iconic visuals of Pittsburgh, highlighting the Cathedral of Learning, Squirrel Hill, and our very own University Center at Carnegie Mellon. It was important for Rishel and Bogovich to make a film that Pittsburghers wanted to see. Bogovich believes that sometimes artists can forget that the audience is important. 
There is a real interest in Pittsburgh for zombies. The city has even been dubbed the unofficial zombie capital of the world, thanks to previous iconic horror films made here by George Romero and Tom Savini. Bogovich and Rishel believe that the show enabled them to take a concept that audiences here are invested in and reinvent it in a way to create something new and exciting. Brian Buckley, a music student currently studying for his master’s degree, describes himself as “a big zombie fan.”  He seemed to echo the sentiment of the audience when, standing amidst the zombie survival kits and fake blood, he said he was, “very impressed and would look forward to seeing the play again in the future.”
The most rewarding thing for Boyovich about Evenings in Quarantine was that, after finding out that after original dates for the show had sold out, “people wanted another day.” Creating a successful production that was distinctive to Pittsburgh and employed local talent was a dream come true for the creative team behind it. Rishel explained that after graduating from college or graduate school, many students leave to find jobs elsewhere. This show was a way for the team to get people to stay and create something original in the arts in Pittsburgh.
Working with different skill sets also helped them make Evenings in Quarantine such a unique piece. The fusion of live acting and filmed footage created an interactive experience that added to the realism of this piece and made you look twice at the shadows outside after you exited the theater. With previous shows already sold out, Bogovich and Rishel are kicking around future ideas such as making a soundtrack and a DVD to accompany the play. They would also love to make Evenings in Quarantine an October tradition. 
Although Evenings in Quarantine: The Zombie Opera is completely sold out, visit www.thezombieopera.com *to stay updated about all things zombie.

Finding the right costume for Halloween is rarely easy. In addition, there’s nothing worse than showing up to your party of choice, only to discover that at least 20 other people decided to show up as the Mad Hatter. (Honestly, potential Mad Hatters — do yourselves a favor and switch it up. That costume is as 2009 as it gets.)
Luckily, most people are not witty, which means that following this guide will have you making waves wherever you go to spend the evening. As they see you, your friends will likely say something along the lines of, “Wow, Jimmy, where did you get the inspiration for this sweet outfit?” Upon your mention that you discovered your costume in the campus newspaper, admirers of every kind will be immediately impressed enough to fawn over you for eternity. Everyone loves a well-read person.
1. “They Rapin’ Errybody Out Here”: Antoine Dodson
This costume is an emulation of one of this year’s most famous videos, in which Dodson makes a deep and powerful claim about the moral degeneration of the world around him. You, too, can suggest that people “hide yo kids” and “hide yo wife” just like Dodson with a mere red bandanna and a blue tank top. 
Pull the bandanna over your hair in such a way that it fans out behind, tying it behind your ears; for bottoms, try a pair of loose jeans or cargo pants. The costume is a particularly simple setup and is easily recognizable. 
Tip: This costume works well with both genders — “Antoinette” Dodson will do just as well.
2. Black Hat
What’s scarier than an overseas hacker trying to penetrate your system and dump malware in your site’s root? Nothing, that’s what. Charm scientific and well-read types with your one-of-a-kind costume by — you guessed it — wearing your favorite black hat of choice. This is the one time of the year when it is also appropriate to wear your XKCD or Penny Arcade shirt without it being considered faux pas. Sure, the CFA kids may look at you a little weirdly, but it’s all good — they just don’t get the joke. Accentuate this costume with a pair of dark shades to keep your identity anonymous. 
Tip: This outfit can be easily customized to white hats, gray hats, and red hats if you’re a Linux fan. 
3. Waldo or Wenda
Infuriate and enrage hundreds of your fellow holiday-goers as you don a white-and-red-striped hat, a red or white shirt, and jeans. They’ll be joking around with you, having the time of their lives, and turn away to say hello to a friend — only to discover that you are now missing. For the rest of the night they will seek you, knowing you’re right under their noses; however, their efforts will be in vain. To complete the perfect look, locate a pair of black thick-rimmed glasses (preferably round). Be prepared to get a few lame jokes from people who claim to have “found” you. 
Tip: This costume is excellent for warding off stalkers. Just give them the slip; they’ll never locate you a second time.
4. “Whooooa, Double Rainbow”
If you’re the kind of person who’s easily pleased by the simple things in life, then the Double Rainbow Guy is your mask of choice for the night. For this costume, you’ll need a destroyable T-shirt, some permanent pens, and a camera — disposable or real. Use the permanent pens to draw the double rainbow on the front of your shirt, professing your deep love for all things rainbow-related through this act. After hanging the camera around your neck, you’re good to go; polish off the look with some hiking boots and shorts appropriate for a double rainbow hunter.
Tip: This outfit is an excellent way to have your camera out at all times and yet not look like the biggest nerd on the planet Earth. 
5. Razzy Fresh
Anyone attending Carnegie Mellon knows that there is currently few food sources more popular than Razzy Fresh. Bring Craig Street (or Squirrel Hill, if you’re old school) to campus in style with a simple uni-colored skirt and colorful or fruity top; you’ll look sugary sweet in no time at all. Wear tights the same color as your skirt for the “fro yo” part — to hammer in the message, locate a fruity-patterned headband or make your own. Proceed to making jokes for the duration of the evening about how you’re “priced by the ounce” and “self-serve.” Insist angrily that [insert favorite flavor here] is the best flavor, and anyone who disagrees with you is a dirty lying scoundrel.
Tip: If you want to cheat, head up to Razzy Fresh and check out the shop’s line of logo shirts. You can then customize them as you see fit.
Most pieces for these costumes can be found in your own wardrobe or bummed off of friends. In the case that you can’t find the perfect piece, head to Avalon Exchange in Squirrel Hill or the seasonal costume shop down at the Waterfront. Both can be accessed by bus, and they offer unique pieces and gimmick clothing at affordable prices. 
Overall, remember this age-old piece of wisdom: It’s not the costume that makes one witty — it’s the attitude of the person behind the clothing.

Human pyramids, flag football teams, and enthusiastic students tabling could be spotted all around the Carnegie Mellon campus last week as the Greek community and the entire campus came together to promote philanthropy. With several events, including Greek Week, CMU Donut Dash, Mr. Fraternity, and the Sigma Phi Epsilon Battle of the Bands, students were able to support each other while raising money for numerous good causes. 
Sorority and fraternity members could be seen around campus competing in Greek Week activities such as dodgeball, tug-of-war, flag football, and several other games and events. Participants poured their enthusiasm and house pride into this week, and although the events were intended to raise money for charity, there was no lack of friendly competition. 
The beginning of Greek Week 2010 also marked the beginning of Penny Wars, a philanthropic event co-sponsored by Kappa Alpha Theta. Students were encouraged to deposit pennies into jars representing Greek houses to give points to each house. They could also deposit nickels, dimes, and quarters into the jars to subtract points. Proceeds collected from Penny Wars were donated by Kappa Alpha Theta to the Gordie Foundation for Hazing Prevention Week.
Kappa Alpha Theta also hosted their annual Mr. Fraternity competition in Rangos Hall last Friday evening. Brothers from each house came together in a show of wit, class, and talent to compete for the title of Mr. Fraternity 2010. Sigma Phi Epsilon’s Matthew Peteroy, a junior history major, won the title thanks to his incredible rendition of Britney Spears’ “Hit Me Baby One More Time,” but every competitor helped make the show unendingly entertaining. 
All proceeds from the Mr. Fraternity competition were donated to the Central Ohio Breathing Association in honor of Karin Johnson, a sister of the Gamma Theta Chapter of Kappa Alpha Theta who passed away after an acute asthma attack. 
On Wednesday, the members of Delta Tau Delta and other participants played kickball for the Boys and Girls Club of America. Sigma Phi Epsilon also hosted a YouthAIDS/AIDS Awareness Week, featuring a speaker and a documentary showing, and concluding with Sigma Phi Epsilon’s Battle of the Bands. 
Sigma Phi Epsilon’s fourth annual Battle of the Bands, the final event of YouthAIDS/AIDS Awareness Week, brought together some of Carnegie Mellon’s established student bands as well as some new faces to play together on Saturday night. Sigma Phi Epsilon alumnus Tim Ruff (CFA ’10) returned to campus to emcee the event. All proceeds were given to the YouthAIDS foundation, a HIV/AIDS fundraising and awareness campaign of Population Services International targeting young people aged 15–24 that began in 2001.
The competition itself was a tough one. With established Carnegie Mellon bands like the Glass Cube and Monsters! competing, it was surprising when newcomers Julia McGinely, a four-person band composed of all first-years, took the title. The group, however, certainly deserved the win. 
The group formed during Orientation 2010 when Wyatt D’Emilia, a first-year in H&SS Lukas Ronner, a first-year in MCS; Kai Roberts, a first-year in CIT; and Tanuj Apte, a first-year in MCS, came together to perform at the Orientation talent show. 
“For us, being freshmen and coming from high school where the interest in music and performance was pretty limited, and coming to Carnegie Mellon to compete against incredible performers … it was shocking to win,” Ronner said. “We were floored by the talent of our competitors. We weren’t expecting to win.”
The group, formed just two weeks before the talent show, was not given much time to prepare. “At first Lukas and I were just going to play solo,” D’Emilia said. “We went to high school together, so we were used to playing together. Then Kai and Tanuj, who both live in our dorm, came to us because they heard the noise and wanted to play with us. That’s how it all started.”
What set this group apart from the other competitors were its rather complicated but extremely well-practiced vocal harmonies. “Complex vocal harmonies are our favorite,” D’Emilia said. “For this show we tried to get as much practice as we could into two weeks. We had to write songs and master them, so we were really pressed for time.”
While the group won a $200 gift card to Guitar Center and the opportunity to open up for the homecoming concert performers, the “real prize,” as Ronner put it, was “being able to help raise money for a fantastic cause.”
Also on Saturday night was Sigma Alpha Epsilon’s CMU Donut Dash. The Donut Dash is an annual fundraiser held by the Pennsylvania Phi Chapter of Sigma Alpha Epsilon fraternity at Carnegie Mellon to support the Children’s Hospital of Pittsburgh. In this event, participants must run a mile to a donut distribution site, where they must consume an entire box of donuts before continuing another mile to the finish line. Runners were greeted with live music and refreshments at the finish line, and prizes were awarded to the top finishers.
Although it was a week packed with fun, it was also a week of intense philanthropy.

Upon walking into Chosky Theater on Friday night for the second showing of Mozart Scenes: The Trials of Love, it was apparent that this show had been highly anticipated. It was a full house, filled with fellow students, some families, and School of Music faculty and staff. The production was split into three parts, each running about 50 minutes and separated by an intermission. The sets were simple, composed mostly of doors and windows with a few pieces of accent furniture. 
The first part was Act II of Le Nozze di Figaro (“The Marriage of Figaro”). It was as if the audience had been taken back in time to the 18th century. All actors on the stage were in period costumes made of damask fabrics in rich colors. The audience was introduced to Countess Almaviva, who is upset that she has a jealous husband who doesn’t trust her or love her the way he used to. 
The countess, played by senior voice major Rachael Long, was magnificent, able to convey a range of emotions while keeping the scene comical. Her husband, Count Almaviva, played by junior voice major Tyler Alderson, had an intense stage presence, conveying rage and anger so well that it was frightening. 
The count comes home to find that there is someone hiding in his wife’s boudoir — her private bedroom — and instantly doubts her fidelity. While there was a young man — Cherubino, played by junior voice major Gillian Hassert — hiding in the closet, the countess was not cheating on her husband with him. The servant, Susanna, played by senior voice major Kristen Hahn, manages to save the day by convincing the count that she had been the one in the boudoir, and the count apologizes. Le Nozze di Figaro taught us that, in order to be forgiven, one must be willing to forgive others. However, the count threatens to hurt Cherubino the next time they cross paths.
The second part was Act I of Cosi fan tutte (“Women Are Like That”), also set in the 18th century. The act started with two young soldiers talking to an old man about their perfect girlfriends. The old man, Don Alfonso, played by senior voice major Hans Tashjian, counters all the talk of perfection with his opinion that all women play games of fleeting love. They make a bet: Don Alfonso bets that he can prove that the girls can move on quickly, and Ferrando and Guglielmo, played by junior voice majors Sean Pack and Piers Portfolio, bet that their girls will be nothing but perfect. The audience is then introduced to the two young women, who sing about their boyfriends with whom they are madly in love, only to find out a short while later that the boys will be deployed that very day, as part of Don Alfonso’s plan. 
The maid in Cosi fan tutte is given the responsibility of not only preventing the girls from committing suicide but also introducing them to new boys. She is much like Don Alfonso, believing that men are useless. The maid, Despina, played by junior voice major Gaelyn Young, was a wonderful performer, and kept the audience laughing and captivated. 
The last part of the show was Act II of Die Zauberflote (“The Magic Flute”). This act, while performed spectacularly well, felt a little out of place, especially because it resembled Harry Potter. The production was a more modern interpretation of the path to enlightenment. Tamino, played by senior voice major Corey Roberts, looked like Harry Potter while Papageno, played by junior voice major Piers Portfolio, was covered in feathers. The main god, Sarasto, played by senior voice major Hans Tashjian, resembled a character from the Gilbert and Sullivan opera The Mikado and possessed a very powerful voice. 
While the third part of the show seemed disconnected from the first two, they were all beautifully performed. The actors were well chosen and the sets were well thought out. It was clear after Friday’s night performance that the School of Music is cultivating some future stars.
School of Music events can be found listed at www.music.cmu.edu.

Joshua Radin is known for his soft, soothing voice; honesty; and simple, fresh lyrics. The latter two qualities are unsurprisingly present in his third album, The Rock and the Tide, but he diverges from his usual soft voice and acoustic guitar songs, making his new album a complete departure from his previous two.
Radin first appeared on the radar in 2006 when he released his debut album, We Were Here, which Rolling Stone rated four stars. He introduced us to his whisper-like voice and his candid words. Then, in 2008, he released Simple Times, making listeners fall in love with his music all over again. Still, this sophomore album was very similar to his first, and listeners held their breath, wondering if Radin would take the much-needed step in a different direction. They did not have to wait long, for The Rock and the Tide has more pep and beat to his voice and rhythm, while still maintaining the same frank lyrics. 
“Here We Go” wanders the furthest from the Radin we know. With a strong drumbeat and synthetic sounds, the opening could be mistaken for one of Miike Snow’s.
“Streetlight” adds a banjo to the mix, giving the piece a country, folky feel.
“The Ones With the Light” is where Radin gets lost on his quest to change. The attempt at punk beat undertones never quite matches up with his voice, and the end result leaves the listener with a desire to delete the track from his music library.
However, Radin doesn’t completely spin off track in his third album. In fact, the old and new sounds are split pretty evenly. Radin sticks to his roots in his title track, “The Rock and the Tide,” as well as in “You Got What I Need,” “Think I’ll Go Inside,” and “One Leap.” With only an acoustic guitar and his voice, “One Leap” is stripped down and raw. 
One of the best tracks on The Rock and the Tide is “Road to Ride On,” a piece that starts with the ticking of a muted guitar and slowly builds with the addition of piano chords and drums. The piece ends like a slow ballad, with a haunting piano line supported by the soft echoing of strings. In it, Radin sings, “I’m always the last one / Never ready for the fast ones / Well, it’s time to change / So we make our plans / Set our sights on a new land / One that’s kind of strange.” 
The change was much needed, and Radin did a wonderful job of merging old and new. Yes, this land might be kind of strange, but Radin has adapted to it perfectly.

What could possibly be better than the classic chocolate cupcake? Add some chocolate chips, an ice cream cone, and dangerously delicious frosting to transform them into Wicked Witch Cupcakes! These cute cupcakes look like little witches, complete with sugar cone hats and sweet facial features. They are a memorable and mouth-watering treat for your upcoming Halloween festivities.
To make the chocolate cupcakes, you’ll need the following ingredients:
1 box of chocolate cake mix 
1 1/3 cups water 
1/2 cup vegetable oil 
3 eggs
Combine the cake mix with the water, oil, and eggs in a medium bowl. Pour this mixture into your cupcake pan (don’t forget to grease and flour it!) and bake at 350 degrees for about 20 minutes.
While the cupcakes are baking, get a head start on the dirty green simple buttercream frosting. Gather the following ingredients:
6 sticks butter, softened 
1 pound of confectioner’s sugar, sifted 
1 1/2 teaspoons vanilla extract 
1/4 teaspoon salt 
Green food coloring
Cream the softened butter and sifted sugar with an electric beater (or by hand if necessary). Beat in the vanilla and salt. Finally, add green food coloring until the frosting is the desired hue.
Once you think the cupcakes are done — double check by inserting a toothpick or knife, which will come out clean if they’re done — let them cool for about 10 minutes. Once they’re cool, begin frosting by simply smoothing the buttercream over each cupcake.
The final step is the Halloween twist — adding the decorations! Here are the ingredients you’ll need:
M&M’s Minis 
Black licorice laces 
Candy corn 
12 sugar cones (preferably chocolate)
After frosting, place a cone on each cupcake, slightly tilted away from the front so there’s enough room to add the witch’s face. Cut up the black licorice laces to appropriate lengths for the witch’s eyebrows and hair, and stick on the frosted head. Use candy corn for the witch’s nose and the M&M’s for the eyes.
If you wish to surprise your guests with a hidden treat, after the cupcake have cooled and before decorating, use a melon baller to scoop out the center of each cupcake. Place several M&M’s inside the void, and replace the removed cake. Proceed with the buttercream frosting and follow the same process for decorating as described above.
Don’t be afraid to substitute ingredients depending on availability and your preferences — the best part of baking is exploring your creativity through improvisation!

While our usual perception of photography involves a camera and sometimes a flash, Spectra, an abstract photography exhibit at the Silver Eye Center for Photography, displays something radically different. Creating a variety of unique work, artists Ellen Carey, Mariah Robertson, Christopher Bucklow, Jonathan Lewis, and Jason Salavon move away from the traditional photographic processes and experiment with camera-less prints, computer programming, rudimentary pinhole cameras, and much more.
“Experimental photography played a crucial role in how artists tried to break free of convention — sociologically, politically, formally — at the end of World War I,” Liza Kurzner, guest curator of the exhibit, wrote in an e-mail. “Today, there’s been a resurgence in artists adapting some of these techniques and ideas in many forms.”
Spectra displays many of the traditional and modern ways to bend the rules of conventional photography. Each of the artists uses distinct and complex techniques to create pieces of art that are not quite photography, and yet not quite anything else.
“The five artists represent a range of abstract techniques and ideas,” Kurzner wrote. “I wanted the prints to reflect many different examples of photographic color and materials. Polaroid paper and color (Ellen Carey’s long ‘Pulls’) is very different from Mariah Robertson’s metallic ‘C print’ color and paper. Chris Bucklow uses a third material, best known as ‘Cibachrome,’ with more saturated, higher keyed color range. Salavon and Lewis both make digital prints, but Salavon creates his ‘photographs’ exclusively from images in the computer, while Lewis scans his own photographic negatives into the computer, transforms them, and then prints them on top quality photographic computer paper.”
Lewis and Salavon use computer techniques to create their pieces. Salavon’s work uses computer software to create a large piece of concentric squares, colored in pastel shades and resembling Op art from the 1960s. Lewis’ work, on the other hand, is all a blur. He transforms everyday images into something strange, such as taking pictures of a Fendi store at night and blurring the images to give them a highly pixelated look.
Robertson’s work is reminiscent of paintings. The pieces have splatters of photographic chemicals on them that resemble drips of oil paint. But while her work can be compared to paintings, it still holds its own. She creates many of her pieces by sandwiching negatives and using photograms — the results of placing objects on photosensitive paper and then exposing the paper to light. Among the artists, Robertson’s work is the only one that includes distinct images from everyday life — dark silhouettes of palm trees that mingle with vivid colors and a photograph of a male nude that seems a little out of place with the rest of her work. Her pieces have the ability to look three-dimensional, the brightly-colored shapes appearing to bend and twist almost off the surface of the pictures.
Bucklow’s work, titled “The Beauty of the World,” romanticizes light and its primary source — the sun. His work is a collection of five different pieces that are similar in form — square with a glowing circle in the center — but differ in their vivid shades. Bucklow created these luminous images by making perforations on a sheet of aluminum foil, turning it into a very basic pinhole camera. He then captured images of the sun and the surrounding sky at five different times within two days, producing the brilliantly colored images on display.
Carey uses Polaroid chemistry to create large works of art that hang down the walls. Her work contrasts positive and negative images by placing them side by side.
“I was amazed how artists from a few generations could ‘speak’ to each other, as in the case of Robertson hanging across from Carey, who was one of the first to create oversize abstract color images,” Kurzen wrote.
Spectra is as unconventional as a photography exhibit gets. These artists truly redefine the word “photography” with their fascinating work.

Clint Eastwood is a respected man in Hollywood, both in front of and behind the camera. In recent years, he’s been dishing out powerful dramas with star-studded casts. Million Dollar Baby was a tear-jerker, Gran Torino exploited extreme racism, and Invictus was an inspiring tale. Eastwood’s most recent brainchild, Hereafter, continues with the drama, but can’t live up to to the quality of its predecessors.
Don’t be surprised if you haven’t heard of the movie, despite it’s being the newest project of one of Hollywood’s elite. There was almost no advance advertising, and movie trailers didn’t go public until recently. The only familiar cast member is Matt Damon, who delivers a less-than-phenomenal performance that can’t live up to the very high expectations set by his past work. While the trailer may have excited viewers with two-and-a-half minutes of thrilling drama, this movie was better as a preview than as a feature film.
The movie starts and immediately gets into the thick of the action. Within the first five minutes, French journalist Marie Lelay is swept away by a tsunami while shopping at a Hawaiian market. She is knocked unconscious, 
and floats limp underwater. She is resuscitated only after she “sees the white light.” She returns to work, but is obviously traumatized by her experiences. Following a suggestion from her boss/lover, she takes some time off to write a book about the hereafter, life after death. On a side note, if you plan on seeing the movie, expect to do a lot of reading: A good 30 minutes of the film is spoken in French and is subtitled.
Running parallel is the life of George Lonegan (played by Matt Damon), a truly gifted psychic who is trying to live a normal life after giving up spiritual readings as a profession. However, his talent is undeniable, and he ends up performing several other readings, which take their toll on him. He takes up a cooking class to get his mind on other things, but is brought back to his past by a woman he meets there. She convinces him, despite his reluctance, to do a reading on her. After she acquires some horrifying details, she disappears from his life. This is a shame because Eastwood seamlessly eases her into the film, but then abruptly erases her from the script.
The third parallel story involves Marcus, a young schoolboy from London. He and his twin brother Jason work together to protect their alcoholic mother and themselves from Social Services, who make guest appearances at all the wrong times. While trying to run away from bullies one day, Jason is hit by a car and dies. Marcus, not ready to give up his brother and best friend, roams the city in search of mediums. Eastwood throws in some subtle comedy by suggesting many psychics are scams, but Marcus comes across George at a London book fair. George eventually caves in, communicates with Jason, and delivers some emotional words to Marcus.
In short summary, Hereafter is one of those movies where three separate, unrelated lives share a connection unbeknownst to them. In the end, they all come together and share in their mutual misery, right? Well, the stories hardly overlap. George interacts with Marie for two scenes, George and Marcus have two exchanges, and Marie and Marcus never cross paths (except for being in the same building at one time).
There were a lot of expectations and high hopes for the film, but it just didn’t pack a punch. Though seemingly contradictory, the movie was both too fast and too slow. Overall, it moved at a very slow pace, taking at least an hour and a half for the three stories to overlap geographically. But at the same time, in crucial scenes, the cuts were too abrupt and the dialogue exchanges too quick. The script could have used a revision, and the acting failed to deliver consistently. However, the idea is fresh and new and, if for nothing else, people should watch the movie for some attractive cinematography.

However you’re planning on celebrating Halloween this year, you may want to consider a holiday-appropriate playlist for the occasion. Or maybe you just need some spooky songs to rock out to while you prepare to put on your costume. Either way, when you’re looking for the best Halloween-themed music, there’s plenty of music available from a range of genres and decades.
Halloween-themed music first began to develop “probably in the late ’50s or early ’60s,” said Michael Devine, a.k.a. DJ Zombo at WRCT 88.3 FM and a Halloween music aficionado. “B-grade monster movies were a hit with youth culture of the day, and soon it was reflected in music.” Indeed, “The Purple People Eater,” by Sheb Wooley, and “Witch Doctor,” by Ross Bagdasarian, both topped the Billboard charts in 1958.
The trend of monster-themed music really caught on, however, after the song “The Monster Mash” by Bobby Boris Pickett became a top hit in 1962. After that song’s success, “overnight everyone tried to cash in on the monster craze,” Devine said. Even Frank Sinatra joined the supernatural song trend with his song “Witchcraft.”
If you’re looking for something with a somewhat darker edge than 1950s monster novelty tunes, try jumping forward a few decades to the late 1970s to indulge in some horror punk. Horror punk, a genre whose creation is mainly attributed to the band The Misfits, blends horror movie imagery and themes — particularly vampires, monsters, and alien invasions — with punk rock rhythms, according to the band’s official website, www.misfits.com. The Misfits would often dress up in elaborate costumes when they performed, and many of their songs were sung from the perspective of the monsters from 1950s B horror films. Their cover of “Monster Mash” provides a darker alternative to the original, and their song “Halloween” would make an appropriate addition to any punk Halloween party. Other horror punk bands, all of whom have been influenced by The Misfits, include Balzac, a Japanese rock band formed in the 1990s; American band Calabrese, formed in 2003; and The Other, a German horror punk band formed in 2002.
For a slightly different sound, consider adding The Cramps to your playlist. The Cramps, formed in the 1970s, were a garage punk band that, according to Devine, “made monster music a huge part of their sound.” Key monster-themed songs to track down include “Zombie Dance” and “I Was a Teenage Werewolf.”
Although these are some of the most famous musicians and songs to have defined Halloween music over the years, your options are by no means limited to those listed above. If you’re in the mood for some truly scary music, try downloading the soundtracks to your favorite horror films. The themes from Friday the 13th and The Omen are some eerie songs with which to start. Whether you’re in the mood for terror or for trick-or-treating this Halloween, you’ll be sure to find plenty of monster-themed tunes to meet your mood.

“Hope Krista” is the name on my birth certificate. My grandfather was a pastor, and my mom got the idea from a passage in the New Testament that refers to “hope in Christ.” But when I went to study abroad in Buenos Aires, I changed my name. It wasn’t something I did on a whim; for some reason, the “p” is difficult to pronounce for Spanish speakers, and I was just tired of being called “Ho” all the time. So I became Esperanza instead. When my boyfriend Josh Debner and I decided to take off the fall semester to volunteer in rural Peru, I was curious if he would play the name game too.
He did. Josh was already used to nicknames, though. His sister calls him Joshey. Sometimes, embarrassingly enough, I call him Smoshua. His mom is the only one who actually calls him Joshua James, and she adds the Debner if he leaves too many dirty clothes strewn about on the bedroom floor. Sometimes people call him J-debs or J-dizzle, from his first AIM screen name and first e-mail address. And the Carnegie Mellon Ultimate team just calls him Debner. So he’s had many names over the years, but here in the mountains of northern Peru, he’s become Joven Yosh. And I became Señorita Esperanza.
We are both volunteering in the Ancash region of Peru as pedagogical (teaching) interns with the nonprofit organization One Laptop Per Child (OLPC). OLPC deploys innovative laptops called XO laptops to rural areas in developing countries, and the laptops are specifically designed for children. They are loaded with educational programs. Our job is to run computer workshops with the students and teachers in five different elementary schools, spending two weeks at each school. All of the schools have electricity, but accommodations in each place are minimal. This week, we’re working in a small town called Quishuar.
I usually just introduce myself as Esperanza. It’s easier that way. But Josh’s name would translate to Josue. It just doesn’t work for him. The J sound doesn’t really exist in Spanish anyway, so instead of Josh, he settled on Yosh. And the Peruvians add the “joven” since there’s no “señorita” version of “señor.” The students just call me Señorita Esperanza, in the same way that English speaking students would call me Miss Hope.
It would be an understatement to say we stand out. We’re the only foreigners to ever step foot in the village. I stand out because I don’t dress in indigenous clothing. Most of the women wear colorful knee-length skirts with handmade hats and tucked in white blouses. I wear jeans and sweatshirts. Women also wear their hair in braided pigtails — even the grannies. Mine is usually loose, and much shorter than the braids that reach down the length of their backs.
And Josh is the town giant. At 6'2", he towers above the kids and all of the townspeople. He instinctively ducks his head when entering buildings, usually to avoid hitting the ceiling. Luckily, we’re living in a hut with a tarp ceiling, so when he wakes up in the morning and forgets we’re in Quishuar, bumping his head is a little more forgiving. In a rural village with a population of 200, I can confidently say he’s the tallest guy in town. The farmers stop him on the street to inquire about his shoe size. 45, he tells them. Their eyes grow wide, “*Ay, gringito*!” they say.
Gringo isn’t necessarily a derogatory word. I’m told it refers to tourists from the United States, although I’m not sure how anyone could distinguish them from an English-speaking Canadian with a similar skin tone. Depending on who you ask, Canadians are gringos too. So are the Swiss, or anyone else who has light features. Gringo can also be interpreted as a term for white people, but even that is open to interpretation. Strangely enough, I don’t usually feel insulted when people call us gringos. Although I’d never greet them with a high five and a “Hey Latino!” or “How’s it going, native indigenous man?” I know that we’re the only gringos they’ve ever seen (they’ve told us this) and thus acknowledge us as such. But I do wish we could just skip the labels and learn each other’s names.
Anyway, the first day we started working with the school in Quishuar, the head teacher introduced us while 40 little pairs of brown eyes stared and giggled. “I know you have another name for these two,” she said, gesturing toward Josh and me, as the kids pointed and whispered “gringos” to each other. “But they have names… What are your names?” she asked, turning to us.
“*Me llamo* Josh,” he said. “Yosh,” the kids repeated, unsure of this strange new sound. I just started with Esperanza to save time. We spent the days teaching computer skills, the afternoons teaching Frisbee, and the nights teaching card games. Little by little, Josh and I became “señor and señorita” among the villagers, “profe” among the students, and “*Yoooosh y Esperanzaaaaa!* ” among the preschoolers who liked to play with us.
One day, however, after Josh did a photo shoot with the kids, we were showing them the photos on his MacBook, and a group of teenagers came in to check it out. “*Qué tal, gringos?* ” one of them asked us with a head nod. The room went silent. We knew it was meant to be a friendly greeting. How should we react? I was about to brush it off and say hi when the little voice of Nicol piped up. Nicol, one of the smartest fourth graders in the school, announced with crossed arms, “They’re not gringos.” The teenager’s smug smile quickly faded. “His name is Joven Yosh and her name is Señorita Esperanza.” Josh and I smiled at each other. I guess we’re not gringos anymore.

Dear Hoskins Brothers,
Halloween has come around again, and I’ve decided to go as someone who can’t take a joke. Do you have any tips?
Sincerely,
Badly reacts to insults
Dear BRI,
A great costume! Nothing is worse than someone who can’t take a joke. They ruin everyone’s good time. You want to make sure everyone knows you can’t take a joke. Find a public venue, like a weekly column in a newspaper insert, and announce your thin skin to the entire world. Tell everyone how you can dish it out but can’t take it.
Once everyone knows you can’t take a joke, try making a few of your own. Make fun of the guy who just cracked a joke at you, but do it poorly. For example, make fun of his lisp without actually knowing what a lisp is. Call him fat when he’s actually in excellent shape and has an amazing body. Draw a lot of attention to yourself. Everyone should be looking at you and not laughing at the other guy!
Some costume ideas: Get a buzz, wear a green Ireland sweater that doesn’t look cool, ride a dinky bicycle, have a pompous attitude, and wear a worn-out pair of jeans, since that’s the only pair you own and you can’t be bothered to buy new ones. And don’t call your mother, even though you haven’t spoken to her in ages.
Everyone loves pettiness,
Patrick Hoskins
Dear Hoskins Brothers,
Someone recently demanded I bake him a cake because I made a joke about him. Does that really deserve a whole cake?
Sincerely,
Top chef
Dear TC,
No, of course not. Whoever demanded you do this is clearly a jerk. I bet he has a dumb haircut too. Baking cakes for people is a sacred trust, something that cannot be forced upon anyone. It is a hallowed act, and one to be entered into willingly. To extort cake from someone goes against the sweet deliciousness that is the center of the cake’s entire being. Only a monster who thinks he’s awesome and is majoring in materials science and engineering would demand something so horrible.
Whatever you do, don’t bake him that cake! Bake your own cake, and keep its deliciousness away from him until he apologizes for trying to force a completely ridiculous public apology on you. Batter is thicker than water, but thickest of all is righteous indignation. You, sir, are a hero. Continue to fight for all that is true and just! God bless you, sir. God bless you.
No way in hell you’re getting that cake,
Brian Hoskins

I would talk about Bauhaus and Bela Lugosi being dead, but Halloween’s not my style. Sorry folks, I’m an All Saints Day kind of guy. Speaking of saints, let’s talk about Benoit Mandelbrot. He passed away this week. That’s right; that guy who was responsible for the entire field of mathematics that you’re currently studying was still alive a week ago. Let’s just take a minute and think about how radically he morphed how we as humans experience reality.
Ah, good reader, you’re back! So, you’ve come to the realization that you’re nothing more than an emergent behavior phenomenon and that the way in which you interact with other humans and the world around you is paralleled by the way that cellular structures interact with each other, have you? Well, that’s great. I guess that it’s only natural then that we talk about psychedelic music. Psychedelic musical history is a funny one in that at the time of its origins — the late ‘60s and early ‘70s — the music that was being produced under this name was some pansy-ass folk. You had the Grateful Dead, the Mamas and the Papas, Moby Grape, the Yardbirds, and the 13th Floor Elevators. Simply put, psychedelic music started out slow. Boy, have things changed! Thanks to the pace of audio recording technology, things have gotten loud, abrasive, euphoric and stupidly complex, all of which are good things.
If you’re interested in exploring the truly avant-garde psychedelia that was manifesting itself throughout the world in the ‘70s, explore the Finders Keepers catalogue. Dedicated to introducing fans of psychedelic, jazz, folk, funk, avant-garde, and whacked-out movie muzak to a lost world of undiscovered vinyl artifacts from the annals of alternative pop history, you’ll find the artists that paved the road for contemporary psychedelia. They can be found at www.finderkeepersrecords.com.
You don’t have to be tripping hard to experience psychedelia. Check out the following and you’ll see what I mean: Flying Lotus, Acid Mothers Temple & the Melting Paraiso U.F.O., Kristin Miltner, Boards of Canada.

[REC] 
Thursday, Oct. 28

Do any of you boys and girls remember the movie Quarantine? Well, this 2007 Spanish horror flick is the original version of that movie and is much creepier despite the fact that the two are almost shot-for-shot the same. The plot is somewhat original, as we follow a camera crew that is posted at a fire station to investigate strange nightly events. However, the night turns out to be a horrifyingly crazy experience filled with Vatican agents and demonically possessed men and women. Fun fact: Filmed with shaky camerawork to simulate the real-life nature of the film, the movie has an even more terrifying feel.
The Crazies
Friday, Oct. 29

This remake of the 1973 George Romero film of the same name stands right alongside the original as a great piece of horror cinema. Nothing spectacular, just a good old-fashioned “disease that strikes a small town, turning everyone into murderous psychos” movie that has an abundance of clichéd frightening moments which may or may not make you jump out of your seat. Out of thousands of residents living in Ogden Marsh, Iowa, only a handful of survivors escape the deadly plague that is quickly taking over what the movie dubs “the friendliest place on Earth.” After the movie begins, it’s clear that Ogden Marsh is anything but friendly.
The Silence of the Lambs
Saturday, Oct. 30
7:30 10 12:30
The Silence of the Lambs is a classic horror/thriller. The winner of five Academy Awards, including Best Director, Best Actor, Best Actress, and Best Picture, this movie is sure to live up to any amount of hype. In the film, a fresh FBI detective seeks out a convicted cannibal, Hannibal Lecter, for aid in rescuing the daughter of the state governor from a sick and twisted serial killer. With plenty of shockingly terrifying moments as well as all the drama of a crime movie, The Silence of the Lambs is an extraordinarily well-made movie that you should see at some point in your life. Fun fact: George Romero makes a cameo appearance; try to spot him!
Halloween! (No Film)
Sunday, Oct. 31
Boo!
Boo! It’s Halloween, so put on your costume and scare someone witless. This could be your year to have the absolute best idea ever. Or not. Either way, please, for the sake of giving our school a fighting chance at a cool reputation, do not spend this Halloween studying. Spend it with anyone you like; just make sure you are having a grand old time doing whatever it is you do for fun. Unfortunately, that cannot be seeing a dollar movie.

This year, Hunt Library will celebrate its 50th year on campus — and students can expect not only a birthday celebration with cupcakes, but also a substantial change to the exterior of the building. In recognition of the library’s 50 years of service to students and the community, the Hunt Foundation will be funding the installation of permanent exterior lighting similar to that of the Randy Pausch Memorial Bridge.
The additional lighting was proposed by the Hunt Foundation’s Bill Hunt after visiting the campus one evening and noticing the lack of lighting in the areas of the library that weren’t being used.
“Bill Hunt, who is a grandson of those who gave us Hunt Library, was on campus one night, and he noticed that the library was not completely lit because there are places that are not being used during the evening hours. He thought it would look better if it were totally lit, so he sent an e-mail to President Cohon making that suggestion,” said Gloriana St. Clair, the dean of University Libraries.
After receiving the e-mail, Cohon enlisted the help of Cindy Limauro, a professor of lighting in the schools of Architecture and Drama. Limaro’s previous work is featured in a number of Pittsburgh’s historical and picturesque sites, from St. Bede’s Church and the miniature railroad exhibit at the Carnegie Science Center to Carnegie Mellon’s own Pausch Memorial Bridge. She also received an Award of Merit in the International Design Awards for her architectural lighting design work in the Carnegie Museum of Natural History’s Hall of Dinosaurs.
“President Cohon requested that Cindy do an assessment and help decide whether the benefit of having it look nice would outweigh the costs of having it lit all the time. Cindy was teaching a lighting class at that time and had those students do an assessment of the idea as well. These students came up with the idea of, rather than keeping the pre-existing lights inside the library on at all times, they would rather like to light the building on the outside in the same way that the Pausch Bridge is lit,” St. Clair said.
“The light will be jazzy and fun, like the lighting on the current bridge,” added St. Clair. “We’re all excited.”
Students also seem to be excited about the lighting. “It is a great idea,” said sophomore electrical and computer engineering major Jecolia Longtchi. “We all spend so much time in the library, it might as well be pretty.”
“I think it is an excellent idea,” said a sophomore in H&SS, Christian Aponte. “I enjoy the idea of integrating two of our university’s landmarks to celebrate not only Hunt Library’s 50th birthday, but also our campus’s distinct history in general.”
The new lighting will be unveiled during a formal event thanking the Hunt Foundation for its gift. The event will be hosted by Cohon and his wife in November. This formal lighting will be the final celebration of three currently planned to take place in the upcoming month. “We’re having a party for students, a party for the staff who currently work in the library, and then the third formal event with the Hunt family, the president, and the trustees,” said St. Clair.
The first event, called “Happy 50th, Hunt Library!,” is aimed at including students in the celebration. It will be hosted by the University Libraries. A party for students and other library users, the event will take place on Wednesday at 6:30 p.m. on the first floor of Hunt Library. The library will be giving away 1,000 cupcakes, as well as encouraging students to sign an anniversary banner thanking the Hunt Foundation for its funding of Hunt Library and of the new exterior lighting. The banner will become a gift of thanks from library users to the Hunt family members.
The upcoming birthday party was planned and organized largely by the University Libraries’ Student Advisory Committee. Student Advisory Committee member Aaron Gross highly encouraged students to attend the birthday celebration, as the birthday party “is an opportunity for students to create a small thank-you gift for the Hunt Foundation, and there will also be cupcakes to eat.”
“I think the biggest reason for student to be involved in the birthday party, as well as in thanking the Hunts, is the high use of the library. The library’s annual gate count has almost reached 1.5 million. The library is an academic destination, but it also serves as a social destination central to the student experience,” Gross said. “Eating a cupcake and signing a banner is a pretty small time obligation when you consider how important the library is to the average student.”

An alumnus of Carnegie Mellon’s economics department has been awarded the Alfred Nobel Memorial Prize in the Economic Sciences, commonly referred to as the Nobel Prize in Economics. Dale T. Mortensen, who earned his Ph.D. from the Graduate School of Industrial Administration (now the Tepper School of Business) in 1967, received the award along with Christopher A. Pissarides and Peter A. Diamond of the London School of Economics and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, respectively.
The Nobel committee awards the prize to economists whose work has made a significant impact on the field across a long period of time. The 2010 winners were credited with researching and creating important labor models that took into account how government regulations and policies made an impact on fields including unemployment and the wages of workers. 
Since 1967, Mortensen has served as a professor at Northwestern University in the Kellogg, School of Business. 
His colleague at the university, Joel Mokyr, a professor in the arts and sciences, said, “[Mortensen] explains a great deal about why at any given point in time there are a lot of people who are not working, and he gives a very rich and extremely useful theory of unemployment that’s very different from our normal ideas of unemployment.”
The theory that won Mortensen the award challenges the ideas of classical economics regarding how people find jobs and how companies fill vacancies. Classical economists believed that in a free market without government regulation, there would be an efficient outcome in the market for human labor. This means that people would eventually find a way to work in parts of the economy that were relevant to their skills and that employers and employees would be able to settle on wages that fairly represented how much workers contributed to the success of the firm. All laborers in the economy would be contributing, and their skills would be utilized to maximize productivity. 
However, Mortensen pointed out that this classic understanding of the labor economy does not include search costs. Search costs are the costs that people have to pay when attempting to find employment. These costs can include the amount of money it takes to move to a new city to work, to buy a new home, to fly to an interview, and much more. 
Mortensen’s research states that these costs create a barrier between a person and employment that may be available. In an unregulated market, these barriers create higher unemployment and don’t allow all workers to use his or her skills to achieve the highest level of productivity for the economy. 
This analysis supports a possible outside party, such as the government, intervening to coordinate potential employers and employees to utilize one another. 
Mortensen is now the fifth degree holder from Carnegie Mellon to win the Nobel Prize in Economics. John Forbes Nash, who received his bachelor’s and master’s degrees from Carnegie Mellon in 1948, won the prize in 1994 for his extensive work in the field of game theory. 
Last year, Oliver E. Williamson, a University of California  Berkeley professor and a Carnegie Mellon Ph.D. graduate, won the award for his work in demonstrating how firms like companies and corporations have close similarities with governmental bodies. 
Former faculty members of Carnegie Mellon have also been awarded the prize for significant contributions to the study and growth of the economics field. 
The late Herb Simon, a former professor in the social and decision sciences department, won the prize in 1978 for studying how decision-making processes function in economic processes. 
When discussing the Nobel Prize as a whole, which includes categories in Physics, Literature, Medicine, Peace, Economics, and Chemistry, Carnegie Mellon has been home to 18 laureates, which include faculty and alumni. Prizes in five of the categories have been awarded to people associated with Carnegie Mellon, the literature prize being the only one to elude the university. Nine of the 18 laureates were award winners in the field of economics. Clinton J. Davisson became the first university-affiliated winner when he won the award in Physics in 1937 for his discovery of electron diffraction. 
Mortensen’s accomplishment has continued the tradition at Carnegie Mellon of pushing the boundaries of knowledge further, bringing pride to many members of the campus community. 
Anjum Rangwala, a first-year economics major, said, “After my first lecture in Professor [Steven] Klepper’s class, I knew how good the economics program was here. But after hearing about alumni of the program winning awards like the Nobel Prize, it makes you feel really proud to be a part of the department.” 
Jaynth Murthya, a fellow first-year majoring in economics said, “I’m interested in economics because I really think it makes an impact on the world. To hear that a theory that made such a huge impact was partially contrived on this very campus is really cool to hear.” 
With two Nobel Prizes won in the last two years, it’s easy to wonder who currently at Carnegie Mellon will be commended in the future.

A part of the Carnegie Mellon research community since 2008, Disney Research Labs will soon move into the Collaborative Innovation Center (CIC). The Disney lab will occupy 17,000 square feet of the space that Google vacated in the basement of the building, sharing space with the Apple Pittsburgh Office and an Intel Research Lab.
“We will have more space ... for our research in human-computer interaction, human-robot interaction, humanoid robotics, and computer vision,” said Jessica Hodgins, the director of Disney Research and a professor of computer science and robotics at Carnegie Mellon.  The increased space available will also give Disney researchers a larger environment in which to collaborate on projects, such as the intersection of computer animation and robotics, with Carnegie Mellon faculty. One of the first companies to make a significant foray into entertainment research, Disney has research facilities in Pennsylvania, California, and Utah, as well as Zurich, Switzerland. 
Disney’s presence has created opportunities for Carnegie Mellon faculty as well as student interns from departments such as the Entertainment Technology Center (ETC), computer science, and art to interact with and learn from Disney researchers. Over the past two years, the Disney Research Lab has participated in projects in both art and computer science for ESPN and Pixar Animation Studios, both affiliates of Disney, as well as the Walt Disney Parks and Resorts. Within the university, discussion groups also provide an outlet for ideas and advice to flow among disciplines. For example, the Graphics Group within the Robotics Institute meets once a week with participants from both Carnegie Mellon and the Disney Research Lab. The group also allows students to present and discuss research papers and their current work. 
The Disney Research Lab has been investigating the application of robotics to character experiences within the Walt Disney Parks, in order to create a more interactive experience with guests. “One of the Disney research areas that I find most exciting is the goal of having more interactive and personally engaging robots and animated characters in the theme parks,” said Nancy Pollard, an associate professor in the School of Computer Science. “Making that happen, whether with or without a human operator, brings a new set of challenges to the research lab that we can consider.”
This goal fits well with Pollard’s core research, which focuses on the use of hands and “dexterity for animated characters and robots.”  Another project that was a joint effort between Carnegie Mellon faculty and post-doctorates at Disney researched algorithms for “modeling the dynamics of clothing so that new motions could be computed very quickly for interactive applications such as computer games,” Hodgins said. The work was published last summer in the Association for Computing Machinery’s Special Interest Group on Graphics and Interactive Techniques. 
“CMU is a research university, and Disney’s presence helps extend research to those who wouldn’t participate otherwise: In this case, art majors,” said junior art major Caitlin Boyle. 
“There is no doubt that the company has turned out some fantastic animated features over the years, and the presence of their research lab here really speaks of what CMU is best at: creativity and innovation.... A lot of the time, the interdisciplinary nature of the school can be lost for the art students; we arrive thinking big thoughts of coupling our work with science or technology ... and then have a hard time balancing studios with academics, and something inevitably falls by the wayside. The Disney Research Lab is where that kind of interdisciplinary work can be rediscovered.”

Last Wednesday, Carnegie Mellon students participated in a roundtable discussion with Timothy Shortley, the deputy to the United States special envoy on Sudan. Shortley spoke about the political situation in Sudan, developments in Darfur, and prospects for a peaceful referendum process.
“We’re really excited to bring this event to campus in collaboration with the Center for International Policy and Innovation [CIPI] and under the direction of Dr. Jendayi Frazer,” began Maggie Pavelka, a master’s student in public policy and management and an executive board member for the International Development Group (IDG) at Heinz College. “Shortley offers a very unique glimpse into an incredibly timely international issue and the upcoming events in January.”  
Prior to the round table, Shortley also spoke to students in 88-362, Frazer’s Diplomacy and Statecraft course. Frazer, a distinguished service professor at the Heinz College, had previously worked with Shortley during her tenure as Assistant Secretary of State for African Affairs. Like the class, much of the roundtable was kept off the record to allow Shortley and Frazer to speak freely and share their first-hand experiences and impressions.
“We’re less than 90 days away from the independence referendum,” began Shortley. The referendum was called for by the 2005 Comprehensive Peace Agreement that ended the Second Sudanese Civil War between the northern and southern regions, although many predict that the vote will be delayed due to a number of logistical, political, and security issues. If the referendum passes, southern Sudan will be officially recognized as an independent nation. “While the parties agreed to a January referendum as part of the Comprehensive Peace Agreement signed in 2005, they’re not as far along as we would like them to be,” Shortley said. “Much more work needs to be done, and the parties need to focus now to ensure that the referenda will be on time.”
“The proposed referendum on independence in southern Sudan could not only result in the birth of a new state, but also provide both a symbolic and a concrete advance in a generation-old conflict and battle,” said Pavelka.  
The discussion continued on to the issue of Darfur, and Shortley shared his current appraisal of the situation. “We have an ongoing peace process in Doha that’s bringing together the armed rebel groups. There’s also another developing issue: fighting amongst some of the indigenous Darfuris,” he said. “We’re moving to a two track process: one that focuses on the government and the rebels, and one that focuses on civil society and bringing the Darfuris together to find a way to build a future, rather than fight.”  
Frazer also jumped in and talked about some of the difficulties she experienced in forming the 2006 Darfur Peace Agreement. “You can make all the right deals and decisions to bring people together, but the failure of just one part or individual can divide everyone up again,” said Frazer, lamenting on some of the political realities at the time. “When you have a spoiler, someone who won’t accept any type of agreement, you have to eliminate them as a factor.”
Following the discussion, Shortley took questions from students and stressed how, despite all the challenges, he enjoys his job.
“Dealing with conflict and acute food shortages are always very difficult, but the rewards of working your little piece, your section of making it better, are tremendous.” 
Both Shortley and Frazer urged students to look into positions at the United States Department of State after completing their studies. “It really is quite special … to see the West Wing, the Oval Office, and the Cabinet Room,”  Frazer said. “This is a part of history that you lived.”
Shortley ended the discussion on an encouraging note, saying, “Hope to see you all soon in State Department.”

Members of the campus community were invited to a grease fire demonstration in Donner Ditch last Wednesday afternoon as part of the second annual campus-wide Emergency Awareness Day. 
As part of the demonstration to inform students of the dangers of kitchen fires, James Gindlesperger, Rick Caruso, and Robert Anderegg of Carnegie Mellon Environmental Health and Safety (EHS) intentionally set fire to a pan of hot cooking oil on a propane-powered stovetop range. Then, showing “what not to do” in response to grease fires, Caruso stood from a distance and poured water on the flames using a long funnel. Flames reached a height of 15 feet before members of the fire department extinguished the fire.
EHS Loss Prevention Manager Jim Gindlesperger hoped that the event was effective because of the visual demonstration. 
“If we had just said, ‘Don’t put water on a grease fire,’ people may not have remembered that important advice long-term,” he said. He hopes that everyone in the campus community will be aware of the following steps to properly control a grease fire:  “If you can, safely turn the burner power off. To smother the fire and deprive it of oxygen, put a lid or cookie sheet on it using an oven mitt.  Do not try to pick it up or dump it out. The key is not to panic.”
The visual demonstration was a highlight of the experience for students attending the event. 
“They gave good information, but the demonstration really reinforced what they were saying,” said  biomedical engineering and civil and environmental engineering double major Emily Bayer. “I’ve always known not to put water on a grease fire, but seeing the catastrophic results really helped to explain the existence of that rule.”
Caruso, a fire safety manager in EHS, explained that last week’s dramatic demonstration had two main goals. “The first goal was to demonstrate the proper method of how to control and extinguish a grease fire. The second: to show how quickly you can lose control of a kitchen fire in a matter of seconds, making a bad situation worse.”  He explained that the event was partially in response to several fire safety tests administered by EHS this past summer that showed students were not well-informed about how to respond to cooking-related fires. 
Also, according to Caruso, there has been one kitchen fire in a fraternity within the last month. Caruso, a Pittsburgh city firefighter and captain of 28 years, said, “I’ve been trying to protect people from fires for years. This is my passion.”
This fall’s Emergency Awareness Day also featured two police dog demonstrations on the Cut. The first demonstration showcased a dual-purpose dog named Frodo who is used for both criminal apprehension and for bomb-sniffing. 
The second demonstration involved a University of Pittsburgh police dog named Riggs. Riggs detected suspicious powder intentionally planted in a toolbox by his trainers. 
Other information sessions were given by various campus safety and health organizations in Kirr Commons. Representatives from EHS were also on hand to help students and staff sign up for Carnegie Mellon’s emergency alert system.

Project helps teach children in rural areas across China
According to researchers at Carnegie Mellon’s Mobile & Immersive Learning for Literacy in Emerging Economies (MILLEE) Project, mobile phone-based games could provide a new way to teach basic knowledge of Chinese language characters to students in underdeveloped and rural areas of China.
The results are based on a study that examined two specific mobile learning games. The preliminary tests were conducted with rural children in Xin’an, part of the Henan province in China. 
“We believe that the cooperative learning encouraged by the games contributed to character learning,” Matthew Kam, an assistant professor in the School of Computer Science’s Human-Computer Interaction Institute and the MILLEE project director, said in a university press release. “The results of our studies suggest that further development of these games could make inexpensive mobile phones important learning tools, particularly for children in underdeveloped rural areas.” 
As a part of this project, MILLEE researchers analyzed 25 traditional games played by children in China to identify different aspects of the games, including cooperation between players, songs, and handmade game objects. They then took these results and applied them to the development and design of the two educational mobile phone games used in the Xin’an study.
Students help in creation of animation for ABC show
The design team of the ABC network show, Extreme Makeover: Home Edition, recently approached Carnegie Mellon for help in creating a segment for an episode. Students and faculty from the Entertainment Technology Center (ETC) were asked to work with ABC over the summer to create an animation of the demolition of a Hamburg, Pa. house for an episode that aired yesterday at 8 p.m.
“Usually on the show, they send the family away on vacation for a week and the first thing the design team does is tear down the old house in some spectacular way,” ETC master’s student and team member Freddie Sulit said in a university press release. 
“This particular home, however, has historic value because it was built out of logs that were over 300 years old.”
Rather than taking the usual route of destroying the home, the cast and crew dismantled the various components of the home, attempting to salvage and reuse available materials. 
Instead of the usual demolition footage, the show’s design team imagined turning the transformation of the home into an animated fairy tale with the family as the main characters.
The team who created the show’s final animation included a producer, director, five artists, and three consultants.

Infrastructure isn’t sexy. Passenger trains aren’t American. Republican governors and gubernatorial candidates aren’t going to play along with rail projects.
Yes, while we here at The Tartan continue to dream of a day when traveling by train in America is not considered an oddity but an obvious and valid mode of transport, the leaders and potential leaders of many states seem to have other plans in mind. One of President Barack Obama’s “signature initiatives,” according to The New York Times, is a plan for a rail network, federally supported to the tune of $8 billion. However, Republican gubernatorial candidates such as Scott Walker of Wisconsin and John Kasich of Ohio are both running on no-train platforms that would force those states to give back the stimulus money that their predecessors competed for.
And while Kasich and Walker have been the most vocal, the opposition is more widespread, including Rick Scott of Florida and Meg Whitman of California. If Whitman is elected in California, she may delay one of the most ambitious rail links planned, from Los Angeles to San Francisco. And earlier this month, the Republican governor of New Jersey, Chris Christie, simply halted work on an $8.7 billion rail tunnel between New Jersey and New York that began last year. His reason was a “significant risk” of costs $5 billion higher than originally estimated, a cost estimate that has been challenged as “simply pulled out of thin air.”
While we understand that upgrading our legacy infrastructure to support the high-speed trains that would truly benefit the American populace is costly, the federal government’s commitment to completing these projects now should not be taken for granted — especially not if the decisions are being made for partisan reasons: to simply not support one more Obama project. 
If the costs are actually not in the taxpayers’ interests, then the projects should be re-evaluated, but the goal should remain the same: to create transportation options that will support Americans in the coming decades.

President Obama has always supported solar energy, whether in policy he enacts or in the plans for renovation of the White House. Beyond the infamous stimulus package that included provisions for solar energy, he has also announced plans for installing power-generating solar panels and a solar water heater on the White House roof. While this is not new — former Presidents Jimmy Carter and George W. Bush had solar panels installed on area buildings — the panels installed by Carter were removed when they started leaking and the panels did not power the White House, only a maintenance building and a pool. Obama’s latest appearance to promote solar power will be on the popular Discovery Channel series Mythbusters.
Mythbusters, as most are aware, features special effects wizards James “Jamie” Hyneman and Adam Savage putting various “myths” and urban legends to the test. The show generally features between three and five myths per episode and demonstrates the process by which the team, which actually includes some additional people, determines how they are going to put the myth to the test. Typically, the team designs and performs an experiment that replicates the situation of the myth. Often, replicating the myth requires elaborate construction projects. In addition, if the testing of the myth is not sufficiently theatrical, the team will increase the magnitude of the testing parameters. For example, after confirming that you cannot remove cured concrete from a cement mixer with dynamite, Mythbusters decided instead to detonate the cement mixer with more than 200 pounds of explosives.
During the episode in which President Obama will appear, the Mythbusters will be re-testing the Archimedes Mirror myth. The Archimedes Mirror myth is also known as the Archimedes Heat Ray experiment. Supposedly, during the Siege of Syracuse, Greek mathematician and inventor Archimedes constructed a set of mirrors that allowed him to focus sunlight on the ships of the Roman republic, burning the fleet. It is also reasonable to note that the myth is a repeat from an earlier episode in the series. The Archimedes myth has been tested repeatedly by multiple scientific organizations with mixed results. President Obama will use his appearance during the testing of this myth to promote the adoption of solar power.
In combination with the inclusion of the two Mythbusters stars at the “Educate to Innovate” kickoff event, it seems that President Obama wishes for science education to become more like Mythbusters and entertain schoolchildren in classrooms with the same antics that they see on TV. Changing science education to be like Mythbusters would turn education into mere entertainment with only an aftertaste of real science. However, actually expecting science classrooms to act anything like an episode of Mythbusters is unrealistic.
Modeling science education after Mythbusters would be impossible. Though the actual cost of producing Mythbusters is carefully guarded, as are the costs of most television shows, it is nearly certain that it is far more than an average American school district has for its entire year, much less just its science classes. It would be especially difficult to simulate Mythbusters in elementary school classrooms, where each teacher must be capable of teaching multiple subjects, operating obscure equipment, and encouraging activities where safety is often tenuous.
Though President Obama’s supporting clean energy and science education is a wonderful thing, it will be accomplished by developing more effective science curriculum and education techniques, not by turning every classroom into a TV production studio. President Obama’s appearance on Mythbusters will likely not be effective in promoting solar energy or his other science initiatives.

About 40 students gathered in Rangos Hall Thursday evening for a “Campus Conversation on TBA,” the latest in a series of deliberative poll events that have discussed controversial issues ranging from the role of marriage in America to the display of public art on campus.
Thursday’s forum rightly highlighted that TBA — the not-so-secret code name for the Activities Board’s (AB) semesterly showing of a pornographic film in McConomy Auditorium — is about more than on-screen fornication. TBA raises questions about the objectification of women, gender stereotypes, body image, self-esteem, and even the potential for human-rights crimes committed against a film’s actors. However, one question seemingly not up for debate this week was whether showing pornography at Carnegie Mellon is controversial.
Legally, the screening of adult pornography to adults is protected by the First Amendment. Locally, Director of Student Activities Liz Vaughan made it clear that the Carnegie Mellon administration supports the right to freedom of expression as applied to TBA. The university’s strong defense of free speech leaves control over continuing or shutting down TBA events in the hands of the Activities Board; for the board’s part, AB President Adam Kriegel stressed his organization’s commitment to bringing events of all types to campus, including TBA. Few students at the Campus Conversation expressed personal opinions against allowing the screenings to continue. Furthermore, the fact that only a few dozen of Carnegie Mellon’s 5,900 undergraduates chose to attend the forum speaks to the extent that pornographic movies on campus have become a non-issue.
We applaud the fact that our community is coming to a consensus on what was previously an explosive and divisive topic, and we think the consensus is the right one. Now that the question of “if” has been settled with respect to TBA, we can collectively move on to the question of “how” the event is presented. There have been calls for AB Films to select TBA movies based on more careful consideration of their content or the working conditions in effect during their production. AB could also conduct a broad survey of the entire student body to determine what sort of films would be the most desirable. With these additions in place, we can easily envision TBA becoming an understood and respected Carnegie Mellon tradition.

Congratulations, first-years. You made it through the first half of your first semester. You might not think that’s much in the way of accomplishments, but the adjustment of moving to college shouldn’t be marginalized. A lot in your life has changed in only a few short weeks. You probably feel pretty close to people you didn’t even know only a few short months ago.
So while all sorts of major changes are happening in your life, I’d like to highlight a smaller, yet still important, change. For most of you, this is the first time in your life that you have no obligation to tell your parents about your grades. mid-semester grades came out last week, and it is your prerogative to keep the news all to yourself.
This is a fact guaranteed by law. The Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act, or FERPA, stipulates that students who are above the age of 18 or attend a school beyond the high-school level have control over their educational records. Your parents cannot require that the school send them a report card — that is illegal unless you’ve given the school explicit consent (read: signed a form).
And I think this is important. Your parents will likely counter with the point that you’re not financially independent (if you are, good for you), so they deserve to know how you’re doing in a school that they pay to have you attend. But frankly, there is a lot about your life that your parents are likely to have no idea about. They don’t see you anymore — at least not as often — and I’m sure it scares the pants off of them.
But let me return to why FERPA is important. When you left for college, your parents were forced to trust you. They have limited ways to check in on how you’re doing. Even with cell phones, they don’t have the influence they once did, so they have to trust that you make good choices. FERPA is a good reminder that they need to trust you. They can’t sneak behind your back and check in with your teachers. No matter how overbearing they were in high school, federal law requires them to kick that habit. The responsibility of monitoring your progress in school is yours.
Despite all of that, you should keep up your end of the deal and tell your parents your grades. While the law is kind enough to force your parents to trust you, you should respect your parents and keep them up to date. As much as we all want everyone to acknowledge how hard we work and how independent we are, you are here in some part because of your parents. So respect that they helped you get here and let them know how it’s going. If you want them to trust you, don’t let them think you’re keeping secrets. The last thing you want is a fight about signing the FERPA release form. It will break down the respect from both parties.

The computer science department recently changed the curriculum of 15-110, Introduction to Programming, now Principles of Computing, in an attempt to provide a more comprehensive course. Although a lot of work was put into updating the curriculum in hopes of a smooth transition from the programming language Java to Python, the change has not been easy for the faculty, the course assistants (CAs), and, most importantly, the students across the 14 different course sections.
Students who are determined to succeed in the course have been met with consistent obstacles. Issues identified as early as the first day of class still have not been rectified, now more than halfway through the semester. 
While most computer science courses have semester-long assignment schedules posted before the course even starts, no student currently enrolled in this course could say when the next homework assignment will be assigned or due. Often the homework assignments are posted at random times that are not indicated in class because the professors themselves do not know when the homework will be ready to post. This is a major problem. If the people running the course are not on top of their game, how can they expect their students to be?
Once assignments are posted, students are then faced with the obstacle of obtaining help. Although the CAs’ and professors’ office hours were originally posted, since the initial homework deadline schedule was deviated from just a few weeks in — leading to a change in CA office hours — some professors have refused to post their CAs’ hours despite e-mails from students requesting them to do so. Even after the dean of undergraduate studies for the computer science department was consulted in the matter, the office hours schedule still has not been posted. This, too, is unacceptable.
With some CA office hours posted and others not, I don’t believe students are all on equal footing. Office hours must be posted for all CAs, and held as scheduled so students know when and how to get help. However, with office hours consistently being canceled, and without everyone enrolled in the entire class being notified, I believe students are being put in an environment that doesn’t encourage success, but actively prevents it.
Sadly, the issue of office hours is just the tip of the iceberg. I could also talk about how the course favors those who have some basic knowledge of programming; or how the average amount of time spent on this class exceeds the expected 10 hours (it is a 10-unit course); or how the current homework system does not allow for student athletes who travel; or how students who desire to fulfill religious obligations find it difficult to succeed; or how instructors’ office hours cannot meet the needs of students who have afternoon labs; or how individual appointments can be few and far between due to the overwhelming request for help; or how some e-mails slip through the large list; or how the homework assignments need constant corrections; or how the computer science department asked Academic Development to not offer tutoring for the course, taking away a valuable resource (though they are now reconsidering this policy); etc, etc, etc. I realize that the professors in computer science are human and are not perfect. But, when some students are given an unfair advantage, that is where I draw the line.
Although I do appreciate the fact that the professors and dean have admitted to their mistakes, and accept that this semester is likely the worst in a time of transition, they have not been able to, and will not be able to, take all the appropriate steps to correct them in order to help the current class. As a result, the computer science department needs to figure out a way to combat this disparity between the current class of students and the ones before and afterward.
Also, to my fellow students: We are paying them to teach us! If we don’t like something about the course, if we need extra help, if we believe that this situation is unfair, we need to stop complaining to each other and start talking to the people in charge. If Carnegie Mellon has the No. 1-ranked computer science program, it is time that the faculty and staff of the department start acting in a way that deserves such an honor by addressing the needs of all the students in all of their classes.

Chinese authorities have been outraged over the 2010 Nobel Peace Prize, awarded to Liu Xiaobo, a dissident who is currently in prison in China. From summoning the Norwegian ambassador to discuss the award to putting Xiaobo’s wife under house arrest, the Chinese government has openly expressed its opposition to the Nobel decision. This attitude has once again proven the Chinese government’s reputation of having a complete disregard for the freedom of speech of its citizens.
In a much-needed move against the current government’s policies, a group of retired Chinese government officials and academics sent a letter last week to the government demanding complete press freedom in China. In the letter, the group stated that the Chinese government’s censorship over the press was in violation of the Chinese constitution. The letter stressed the need for reforming China’s current political system and saw freedom of speech as the first and most important step towards this end.
Although the letter was sent three days after the announcement of the Nobel Prize, there is no evidence that directly links the letter to the award. However, even if unrelated, it is a welcome message. It is encouraging to realize that those who were once the core of the Communist Party in China believe in freedom of speech. The letter is also an indication that some Chinese officials believe the current government has gone too far with its restrictive policies.
It is high time that the Chinese government ease some of its controlling policies, and we believe this is a positive step forward. Although it is naive to hope that the Chinese government actually carries out all the policy changes suggested in the letter, we hope government officials realize that their current policies are detrimental to the progress of the nation.

While you may have heard about Juan Williams’ recent comments on Fox News and subsequent firing from his position at National Public Radio (NPR), a name you may not recognize is Alicia Shepard. Shepard is the NPR ombudsman, described by NPR as “the public’s representative, ... an independent source regarding NPR’s programming.”
It is Shepard’s job to review the 6,800 comments on the story. It is her job to review the 8,000 e-mails that crashed the NPR contact form. In Shepard’s post on the topic, she summarizes: “The overwhelming majority are angry, furious, outraged. They want NPR to hire him back immediately.... They are as mad as hell, and want everyone to know it.”
It is Shepard’s job to respond, and her response was fair, calm, and well-considered. She contends that this is not about race, nor free speech — it is about Williams overstepping the bounds of being a news reporter or even analyst, and taking a very vocal, very personally charged stance on a controversial issue. At NPR, this goes against its journalistic values; Fox News gave Williams a raise.
But I want to focus not on the issues surrounding his firing (and improved salary) but the response. Shepard’s role as ombudsman is to understand controversy from both inside and out. She is not an NPR reporter; she is an independent actor who has worked with NPR to understand its decision-making processes so that they can be explained to an outraged public.
But by no means was this week indicative of Shepard’s normal role at NPR. She said there has been no event in the last three years that comes near to matching the amount of traffic this incident has generated.
But this is why the role of ombudsman is important for journalistic organizations. While over the past three years Shepard has received only minor complaints, she has built up trust from the community, and now that a real issue has arisen people are calling and e-mailing, and are clearly not afraid to express their feelings. And it is her response that people can turn to in order to understand why NPR has fired Williams after 10 years.
And this is why we at The Tartan should also have an ombudsman — a person trusted in the community to understand how The Tartan operates, but also independent enough to listen to and be trusted by the administration, the students, fraternities and sororities, faculty and staff, student government, local media, and everyone who believes The Tartan should continue to grow as a strong news source.

Being yourself is the best and most original costume possible. It is also the scariest.
You are determined to enjoy your weekend, so you will be working extra hard in order to get your responsibilities out of the way and have fun. However, there might be an unexpected bump in the road along the way.
Make your appointment at Student Health Services now — I foresee a high volume of candy, parties, and fun, which will lead to panic in the wee hours of Monday morning when you realize that you haven’t done any homework at all.
You should go as a stressed college student this Halloween. Think of the money and effort you will save because you already have a really believable costume and the ability to accurately pull off the behavior needed to play the part.
Go as a stereotypical Pitt student for Halloween: Act very intoxicated and wear as little clothing as possible. To make the costume more believable, have some friends help you walk down the street to make sure you don’t fall over.
To the Virgo reading this horoscope right now: Halloween is this Sunday, not this whole week, so please take off your mask right now.
Stay away from Hunt on All Hallows’ Eve — it may be haunted with students of semesters past. Look twice when you pass someone who looks happy and content while studying late into the night on the 31st.
Attention! Purnell is not putting on a week-long Halloween costume pageant! Some of the students who frequent the building dress that way all year.
Watch out for the bagger you are hosting this weekend. He or she might attack you in your sleep in hopes of taking your spot here at Carnegie Mellon.
What do computer science majors call the holiday that takes place on the 31st? Hallo-Wean.
Remember that the scariest zombie of all is a computer science major away from Gates or Wean.
Nothing this Halloween can be scarier than your mid-semester grades.
