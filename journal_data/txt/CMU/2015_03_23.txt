The first day of spring may have brought yet another batch of snow to Pittsburgh, but it also signaled the start of the season for the Carnegie Mellon Club Lacrosse team. Opening against the Waynesburg Yellow Jackets, the Tartans turned a chilly night into a red-hot rally of scores, dominating Waynesburg 9–5.
Carnegie Mellon got off to an early lead when senior midfielder Esteban Pacheco scored the first goal for the Tartans, sneaking it through a narrow gap on the left side of the goal. Waynesburg answered with a strike of its own, and the game began to settle into a defensive battle with a lengthy succession of saves by both goalies. Towards the end of the first quarter, the Tartans were able to earn another score, making it 2–1.
The next quarter brought more offensive action to the game, starting with an early score by Pacheco. The Yellow Jackets scored again shortly afterwards, but sophomore attacker William Tyler Reid answered with a score of his own. Tensions rose among the visiting players, as evidenced by one member of the team slamming his helmet to the ground after the referees pulled him out for committing a penalty. Waynesburg took a more aggressive approach toward the end of the second quarter, sending shot after shot at junior goalie Brad Hodge until finally managing to score. Their elation was short lived, as the Tartans led by Reid quickly answered, taking a 5–3 lead into halftime.
From that point on, the Tartans began to overwhelm the Yellow Jackets. After a succession of blocks by Hodge, the Tartans quickly turned to the offensive, leading to another Pacheco score. While Waynesburg tried to muster a response, the Tartans counteracted each Waynesburg attempt to advance the ball, eventually turning the tables with another score, this time courtesy of graduate student midfielder Travis Armiger. Before they realized it, the Yellow Jackets found themselves surrendering another score to Reid, bringing the game to a lopsided 8–3 score. Although Waynesburg would manage to add two more goals to their total in the fourth quarter, the Tartans’ lead was just too much, especially with yet another score from Reid by the time the game finally ended.
Sophomore long stick midfielder, defender, and captain Kincaid Murray was elated with the team’s performance, especially considering the limited time the team has actually been able to meet for practices. “We’ve only been able to really have two practices due to the snow,” Murray said, citing the large amount of snowfall that has blanketed Pittsburgh often this year. “As a result, we were a little sloppy.”
Nevertheless, the team’s dominating performance was very satisfying. “It was a great start to our season,” he said. “We will be very good going forward.” The club team switched over this year from the MCLA (Men’s College Lacrosse Association) to the NCLL (National College Lacrosse League), which has most of their opponents located nearby and a better chance for the team to compete.
Murray believes that the team chemistry is very strong among both the coaching staff and the players. “We’re all out here for the love of the game,” he said. “It’s a fast paced and physical sport that really draws people in and has a tight knit community.” Making the time to come together for the sport, especially with the rigors of Carnegie Mellon, makes the feats they achieve on the field even more impressive, although Murrary contends that their love of the game makes balance easier to achieve. As the team goes though more games together, their chemistry will almost certainly improve. Judging by the strength of their start, it will certainly be exciting to follow the team going forward.

Men’s Tennis
Over the break, the Carnegie Mellon men’s tennis team traveled to Claremont, California for its annual spring break tour. The Tartans faced off against some of the best teams in the country, including top-ranked Trinity University, 15th ranked Pomona-Pitzer Colleges, and 18th ranked Bowdoin College.
The first day for the Carnegie Mellon was a double–header with Pomona-Pitzer in the morning and University Athletic Association (UAA) rival the University of Rochester in the evening.
The Tartans fell behind quickly against Pomona-Pitzer after going 1–2 in the doubles matches with only seniors Will Duncan and Christian Heaney-Secord pulling out a close victory, 9–8. In singles play, Carnegie Mellon played close with all but two matches requiring a tiebreaker either for a game or the set. Junior Abhishek Alla won 7–6 (7–4), 6–4, while sophomores Kunal Wadwani and Kiril Kirkov won their respective matches 7–5, 6–0 and 6–4, 7–6 (10–8). The split in singles play was not enough to overcome the early hole from doubles and left Carnegie Mellon losing 5–4.
In the next game against Rochester, the Tartans took out their frustration from the morning with a 9–0 victory. While every player won their matches, senior Bryce Beisswanger and junior Yuvraj Kumar were dominant in doubles play with a 8–2 victory and Alla, Heaney-Secord and Wadwani were outstanding in singles play with all three winning in straight blow out sets.
Next up for the Tartans was Bowdoin College, where Carnegie Mellon started off slow by dropping all three close doubles matches. The Tartans rebounded in singles play with Heaney-Secord and Wadwani each winning in straight sets, 7–5, 6–0 and 7–5, 6–4 and Kirkov pulling out a tight match 7–6 (7–3), 1–6, 1–0 (10–3). The singles split was again unable to pull Carnegie Mellon out of their early doubles hole as they fell 6–3.
After the disheartening defeat, the Tartans had to pull it together as they faced off against the top ranked team in the country in Trinity University. Carnegie Mellon trailed again after doubles play with only Duncan and Heaney-Secord winning, 8–2, but this time the Tartans singles play was enough to overcome the deficit. Alla and Kirkov won in straight sets, 6–3, 6–1 and 6–3, 6–0 respectively, while Heaney–Secord and Duncan both earned their second wins that day, 6–3, 3–6, 7–5 and 6–7 (1–7), 6–0, 7–5 respectively.
To finish off the trip, Carnegie Mellon faced off against Sewanee and blew them out 9–0. All three doubles teams won by at least 5 while all 6 singles matches for the Tartans were straight set victories as the Tartans finished the trip with a vengeance.
Women’s Tennis
During their annual spring break trip to California, the 7th ranked Carnegie Mellon women’s tennis team competed against the top teams in Division III.
First up for the Tartans was UAA rival Rochester. Carnegie Mellon disposed of them quickly in a 9–0 victory. Senior Bryn Rachke and first-year Cori Sidell won their doubles match 8–0 while all six singles matches were won in blow out straight set victories.
The next match was a bit tougher when Carnegie Mellon faced off against 5th-ranked Claremont-Mudd-Scripps. The Tartans dropped all three doubles matches to fall behind quickly before continuing to struggle in singles play with only junior Brooke Tsu and Raschke pulling out victories, 6–2, 6–1, and 6–4, 2–6, 1–0 (10–5).
Trying to rebound, the Tartans next faced 8th-ranked Pomona-Pitzer. Carnegie Mellon fell behind earlier with only sophomores Vanessa Pavia and Stacy Chang pulling out a win, 8–3. The Tartans rallied back in singles play with Pavia, sophomore Nicholle Torres, Tsu, and Raschke all pulling out victories to give the Tartans the win, 5–4.
Rounding out the trip, Carnegie Mellon faced off against 14th-ranked Sewanee. Two doubles wins by Pavia and Chang along with Tsu and Torres put the Tartans in the early lead before Pavia, Torres, and Raschke all won in straight sets, 6–3, 6–2; 6–3, 7–5; and 6–1, 6–1; respectively, and Tsu won with a come-from-behind victory 4–6, 6–1, 6–4.
Men’s Golf
The Carnegie Mellon Men’s golf team competed in two tournaments over the break, the UAA Championships and the Jekyll Island Invitational.
In the UAA Championships, the Tartans kept it close all weekend. After the first day, Carnegie Mellon shot a 313 and was only down two strokes from leader Rochester and sophomore George Qian was first among individuals while senior Cameron Low was tied for 6th. On day two, the Tartans shot much better and posted a 303, which jumped them into second place with a 616 for the tournament. Qian was tied for first with his second 74-shot round and won the first playoff hole to claim sole posession of first place. Sophomore Alexander Pomerantz played as an individual and was third overall and claimed first team all-UAA honors with Qian.
In the Jekyll Island Collegiate tournament, the Tartans faced off against 30 teams in the 54-hole tournament. On the first day, the Tartans shot a 302 and Qian led Carnegie Mellon with a 73, good enough for 22nd out of 150. Senior Justin Fischler and Low both shot 76s on the day. Day two was a bit tougher for the Tartans; they shot a 311 while Low and Qian both shot 75s.
The final day for the Tartans was led by sophomore Jordan Klodowski, who shot 6 birdies as Carnegie Mellon shot a 300. Qian and Low each shot a 75 again with Qian finishing tied for 37th overall. The Tartans finished the tournament tied for 21st.
Women’s Golf
The Carnegie Mellon women’s golf team competed in the first ever UAA women’s golf championships. 
This is one of many firsts for the Tartans, who are still in the midst of their first year of varsity competition. On the first day, the Tartans shot a 388 to place them in a distant third.
The brightest spot was first-year Summer Kitahara, who was tied for 5th with her 80 for the round. Day two was much better with Carnegie Mellon improving by over 25 strokes to shoot a 362. Kitahara earned all-UAA first team honors with her 161 shot tournament, good enough for 5th overall.
The Tartans also competed in the Jekyll Island Invitational over the long break, finishing tied for 13th with a 1032 round total (346–354–332). Kitahara had the best overall finish for the Tartans with a three day total of 242, which placed her 24th overall. Fellow first-year Robin Tan place 27th overall with her 54 hole total of 244, which was bolstered by her career-low 76 on the final day.
Track & Field
Select members of the Carnegie Mellon men’s and women’s track and field teams traveled to compete in the NCAA Indoor Championships over break. For the women, senior Erin Kiekhaefer competed in mile run. She posted a 5:03.96 in prelims to move on to the finals before her 5:09.32 time placed her ninth overall.
For the men, seniors Thomas Vandenberg and George Degen both competed. Vandenberg competed in the 400 and 800 meters. Times of 49.05 in the 400 and 1:53.43 in the 800 pushed him to the finals in both events. In the finals, Vandenberg finshed 5th in both events with a time of 49.13 in the 400 and 1:54.98 in the 800, giving him two All-American honors. Degen ran the finals of the 3000 meter and finished 10th with a time of 8:28.49.

Swimming and Diving
Starting on Wednesday, select members of the Carnegie Mellon men’s and women’s swimming and diving team competed in the NCAA Division III Championships in Shenandoah, Texas. On the opening day, the women’s 200-yard medley relay team, comprised of junior Kira Singhaus, first year Kimberly Hochstedler, and sophomores Gillian Crews and Allison Kirkby, placed 14th during prelims with a time of 1:45.51, but DQ’d during the finals.
The men’s 200-yard relay team, with senior Josh Lucheon, sophomore Sivan Mehta, and first-years Matthew Chu and Kevin Steinhouse, also competed and finished 13th overall by setting a new school record with a time of 1:30.64, earning them All-American honorable mention.
Steinhouse and Crews each competed individually in the 50-yard freestyle, with Crews finishing 40th with a time of 24.50 and Steinhouse ending up in 48th in the men’s with a time of 21.29.
On Thursday, the women’s relay team competed again, this time finishing 13th overall in the 400-yard medley with a time of 3:51.86 to earn them All-American Honorable Mention. Crews competed in her second of 3 individual events, with the 100-yard butterfly, finishing 18th with a time of 56.57.
Friday saw strong individual performances by several Tartans with Chu competing in the 100-yard breaststroke, touching the wall with a time of 56.77 for 27th, Crew in the 200-yard butterfly, finishing in a time of 2:07.47 for 27th and Hochstedler competing in the 100-yard breaststroke and finishing with a time of 1:07.12, good for 32nd. Sophomore diver Machika Kaku also finished up her diving on the 1-meter board, earning 16th overall and All-American Honorable Mention with a 364.15 in the finals.
On the final day, the women’s relay team competed once more, this time in the 400-yard freestyle relay, finishing in 3:36.01 and in 26th place. Singhaus also finished her championships in the 200-meter back stroke, finishing 31st with a time of 2:06.48. The men’s relay team also competed in the 400-yard freestyle relay, finishing 25th with a time of 3:09.71.
The championships mark the end of the swimming and diving season.
Track and Field
On Friday and Saturday, both Carnegie Mellon track and field teams competed in the Washington and Lee Track and Field Carnival.
The women started with senior Sasha Spalding setting a new school record in the 200-meter dash with a time of 25.73, good for a second place finish. In the 10000-meter run, a pair of Tartans took 2nd and 3rd place as juniors Zofia Tillman and Sophie Lohmann finished with times of 38:42.36 and 39:12.51 respectively.
In the field events, sophomore Rebecca Fortner took first place in the high jump by clearing the 1.51-meter bar on her first attempt, while fellow sophomore Grace Yee took fourth in the pole vault by clearing the 2.86 mark. Junior Lauren Mature placed fourth in the shot put with a 10.07-meter heave, her highest finish of her three throwing events.

Safety concerns have been plaguing the National Football League (NFL) in recent years, but it seems like more players than ever are voicing their concerns in the form of early retirements.
The average length of an NFL career, currently 3.3 years, has always been fairly low. For every superstar we get to see on the field, dozens of players cannot get playing time, resulting in early retirements. On the other hand, those players that do make it onto starting rosters and become important contributors to their teams often enjoy careers lasting into their thirties and sometimes even forties, barring any career-ending injuries.
Over the past few weeks, however, there have been many prominent names in the NFL retiring early. Jason Worilds, a top linebacker for the Pittsburgh Steelers, retired last week, calling it quits at 27. Jake Locker, the former starting quarterback for the Tennessee Titans, retired earlier this month at 26. The San Francisco 49ers lost 30-year-old linebacker Patrick Willis, who many thought would still be contributing to the team for years to come.
The most jarring of these early retirements, however, is former 49ers linebacker Chris Borland. Borland had only just completed a great rookie season for the team, impressing the 49ers enough to consider him the future for the franchise, especially after Willis decided to hang up the cleats. Borland specifically cited concerns about the risk of brain injuries, having nursed a concussion he sustained during training camp. “I just thought to myself, ‘What am I doing? Is this how I’m going to live my adult life, banging my head, especially with what I’ve learned and knew about the dangers?’” Borland said Monday on ESPN’s “Outside the Lines.”
Injury concerns in the NFL are nothing new. The NFL has been saying that “football has never been safer,” and to a large extent, that is true. Better protective equipment has made an impact on reducing the occurrence and severity of injuries. Better medical practices have limited the duration and long-term damage of individual injuries. In addition, the league has been employing many different initiatives over the past years to attempt to make the game safer, including an onslaught of new penalties for “unnecessary roughness,” limiting the amount of contact practices teams hold during the course of the year, and a concussion protocol instituted in 2013 intended to minimize the effects of concussions through a variety of steps taken before a concussed player can return to play.
What separates these concerns over player safety from past challenges to the NFL is the new culture emerging from both NFL players and NFL fans. On comment boards surrounding Borland’s decision, many have applauded him for making a move that sacrifices the fame and glory he could have gotten in the NFL in order to preserve his quality of life. Many current players like St. Louis Rams guard Chris Long and former players like former New Orleans Saints and Cleveland Browns linebacker Scott Fujita are also lauding him, rather than the traditional response to injury concerns, which is questioning his toughness.
Chris Nowinski, an expert on sports-related concussions, suggested that a significant culture change is taking place in the NFL right now. On Borland’s decision to walk away from football, Nowinski said, “It shows the macho culture of ‘destroy yourself for the game’ is losing its grip, that it’s no longer cool to question people’s toughness. That represents a big shift in thinking from just a few years ago.”
More players are making the choice to value their long-term health over the millions of dollars they can get playing in the NFL. This is not to say that football is becoming more dangerous than it ever has been. Quite the contrary: Safety has definitely become concerning to the NFL, and their efforts to improve the game and spread awareness about the risks of football are leading those who are wary on the risks of playing the game to exit the spotlight with considerable dignity. The changes in the NFL also do not completely ensure a safe game.
Barring any rule changes that will forbid tackling, there will always be some risk of injury playing football, but the safety measures in play now and in development will minimize the frequency and seriousness of these risks.
The NFL will not run itself out of business through continuing to improve safety measures; instead, it will be able to maintain the entertainment value football has and ensure that its key contributors do not suffer long-term consequences as a result of playing in the NFL.

With a day remaining in the two-day University Athletic Association (UAA) Men’s Golf Championship, sophomore George Qian led by a single stroke. The thinnest of margins separated him and the competition, but Qian had been in this position before, and was able to fend off the mounting pressure. Despite letting the lead slip by the eleventh hole, Qian was able to recover and tie the clubhouse lead going into the final hole. Qian needed a par or a birdy to keep his chances alive. Despite missing the green with his second shot, an excellent chip shot set up an eight foot putt to tie up the competition. Qian sunk it, setting up a playoff.
The playoff was over quickly. After Qian’s opponent missed the green on his second shot Qian “just aimed for the middle of the green.” He hit his mark, setting up a two-putt, which Qian described as his favorite situation.
Qian was able to draw on recent experience to help him through the nail biter of a finish. He said sinking the putt to force the playoff was “like a flashback” to the end of his competition at the amateur tournament in his native Iowa, where he dropped a playoff after two holes and ended up runner up. The familiarity of the situation helped the Bettendorf native ease his nerves. Qian, self-described as competitive and calm, backed up his claim and sank the second putt to lock down a UAA title, the first for a Tartan since 2009. 
His triumph at the conference tournament added to his growing trophy case, which already included a spot on the Golf Coaches Association National All Freshman team last year.
Qian’s dedication to golf has been a lifelong endeavor. He started at the age of nine, around the same time his parents — his father is his caddy at amateur tournaments — and some of his friends started playing. He started to play competitively in middle school. He says the challenge and the impossibility of perfection draw him to the game; there’s always room to improve. Spending two to three days a week on the golf course and spending plenty of time in the offseason in the simulator in Skibo Gym helps him do just that on a regular basis.
It should come as no shock, then, that Qian has little interest in benchmarks and puts a lot of emphasis on improving his best performance. While he said many people talked about 77 as a bad day, he finds it to be an arbitrary tick mark. He said the number did not matter so much as how well someone played. He prefers more concrete numbers such as 67, his personal low score for a tournament.
In addition to the limitless potential to for a golfer to grow, Qian also touted the individuality of the sport. While he admires the work ethic of extraordinarily successful golfers such as Tiger Woods and currently top ranked Rory McIlroy, there is no one he tries to emulate, preferring to forge his own style. He says golf is about creating your own game and “sticking with what works.” A conference title as a sophomore seems to indicate that he’s on the right track. He attended a golf academy in his final two years of high school and even has his sights set on going pro. Qian wants to start out in Asia and play some mini tours in pursuit of breaking into professional golf after he graduates from Carnegie Mellon.
Despite his future plans, academics come first for the finance major. He followed his brother’s lead into finance, thinking he would prefer it to his parents’ profession, engineering. After starting out in the Tepper School of Business, Qian found that he particularly enjoys quantitative classes, such as multivariate analysis. He is also pursuing a computer science minor — 15-110 and 15-112 were his favorite classes in the semesters that he took them. Balancing the combined workload, however, is not a problem. His years at the golf academy taught him to balance golf and academic work, giving him the ability to excel at both.
Including a cascade of top-10 finishes and a conference championship, Qian’s success on the golf course is indisputable. Even so, with a third of this season left, Qian is not even close to done with the front nine of his already illustrious Carnegie Mellon career. The best is almost certainly yet to come.

March Madness defies prediction. Every year, millions of Americans, from office pools across the country to President Obama fill out brackets and within a few hours most are so laughably wrong that Warren Buffett was willing to wager a billion dollars of his own money that no one would be unscathed at the end of the tournament in April.
Needless to say Buffet is still very much a billionaire and in hundreds of office pools the die-hard college basketball fans are bemoaning how the person who picked based on uniform colors beat them.
This year was no different with the first three games showing three of the 3 seeds taken to the buzzer by their mid major 14 seed counterparts. Notre Dame barely made it out alive by forcing a last second turnover against Northeastern, but Baylor and Iowa State were not as lucky, losing to Georgia State and UAB respectively.
The Georgia State squad barely won its conference tournament and had a coach celebrating so hard he tore his Achilles, leading to the comical moment of him falling off his stool when his son hit the game winning shot. UAB athletics has been struggling so badly they just disbanded the football team due to lack of funds. These are the stories of the giant killers who felled two of the top teams from a Big 12 Conference so talented that 70 percent of the conference made it in to the tournament.
The first day had five games decided by a single point and two go into overtime, but the second day was nearly as bizarre because of the lack of upsets and close games. The iconic 5–12 upset never happened and the tournament shockingly went almost as predicted with only 11 seed Dayton’s win over 6 seed Providence to close out the day not going as expected.
No one expects “chalk” or all of the favorites to win, but to have two days so diametrically opposed was strange even by tournament standard. This weekend, the tournament still couldn’t decide what its identity should be with 1 seed Villanova losing to 8 seed North Carolina St. and 7 seed Michigan St. knocking off 2 seed Virginia to leave the Eastern Regional without its top two seeds, but everything else was shockingly expected with Kentucky continuing its dominating undefeated season by blowing out Cincinnati and Arizona crushing Ohio State.
In a year where almost everyone has Kentucky winning it all, and anyone picking otherwise just praying for an upset to win some money, March Madness is still struggling to find its identity. It could be the year of the Cinderella story or that of the dominant top seeds imposing their will on the competition.
There are still two more weekends to go, and really all anyone knows is that there is bound to be some entertaining basketball. That and the fact that everyone’s brackets are likely more valuable as fire kindling than any chance at making money in your pool.

Recent research by Matt Walker, a professor of physics at Carnegie Mellon, and Alex Geringer-Sameth, a post-doctorate physics student at Carnegie Mellon, in collaboration with Savvas Koushiappas, an assistant professor of physics at Brown University, and a team of cosmologists from the University of Cambridge, may lay down the groundwork for understanding one of the universe’s greatest mysteries: dark matter.
Not much is known about dark matter. It is said to comprise about 80 percent of the matter in the universe and cannot be seen using any current technology. All of dark matter’s properties have been inferred based on its gravitational interactions, such as causing the rotation of galaxies and the expansion of the universe. In short, dark matter is a hypothetical type of matter that is thought to explain some of the universe’s unexplained phenomena. Dark matter is thought to exist outside the realm of conventional physics, meaning it is thought to be something other than standard matter. The team’s research suggests that dark matter may have a “particle nature,” which would make dark matter researchable beyond its gravitational properties. The implications of this are widespread for cosmologists and may open new doors in the search for dark matter.
Current theories suggest that when two particles of dark matter collide, they produce normal particles and gamma radiation, or high energy electromagnetic particles. While these gamma rays are consistent with theories explaining dark matter’s particle interactions, it is a large assumption to say that this is the most likely scenario. In fact, both NASA and the Cambridge group performed their own analyses of the data and found nothing of any significance. There is a very large margin of error in analysis of deep space phenomena, but even the possibility of dark matter displaying particle interactions is enough to keep research teams invested.
“Dwarf galaxies are like big clumps of dark matter,” says Geringer-Sameth, “they’re very clean systems.” Dwarf galaxies are the best systems for examining dark matter, so when researchers at Cambridge University discovered nine new dwarf galaxies, the research team pounced on the data. “For the past few years, I’ve been working on ways to do this kind of dark matter search … it’s just that there’s a limited number of dwarf galaxies.” Using publicly available data from NASA’s Fermi telescope, which detects gamma rays, the team explored the gamma ray emission from the coordinates of the newly discovered dwarves.
The possibility of gamma radiation caused by dark matter interactions is of great importance in the realm of physics because it reinforces the theory that dark matter has a particle nature. This theory suggests that dark matter may behave at least vaguely like normal matter, and therefore may be more readily researchable. “Over the past few decades,” says Geringer-Sameth, “people have come to realize that the vast majority of matter in the universe — [dark matter] — exists outside the standard model for particle physics. There is a huge quest to figure out the particle nature of dark matter.”
The fundamental goals of physics are to explain matter and its interactions at the most basic level. “There is only so much about the microscopic nature of dark matter that can be observed through gravitational interactions,” says Geringer-Sameth. “The standard model of physics explains everything with remarkable precision, with the notable exception of most of the matter in the universe.” The mystery of dark matter is one that stands as a holy grail, of sorts — it seems to be the only substance that defies the laws of conventional physics. By making discoveries such as this, physicists come incrementally closer to understanding the entirety of the known universe.

Healthcare as we know it is about to change. The incorporation of computer technologies into medical care is fueling a revolution in the development of modern medical tools. Carnegie Mellon, the University of Pittsburgh, and the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center (UPMC) recently announced a partnership to combine their expertise and resources in order lead this transformation in healthcare.
This alliance will foster unique collaborations between doctors and computer scientists. Working together, they hope to develop novel ways to utilize the plethora of medical data to both combat illnesses and personalize medicine. The partnership will include two new research and development centers funded by UPMC with $10 million to $20 million per year over the next six years. The Center for Commercial Applications of Healthcare Data (CCA) will be based at the University of Pittsburgh and lead by Michael Becich M.D., Ph.D from the Department of Biomedical Informatics. Carnegie Mellon will be home to the Center for Machine Learning and Health led by founding director Eric Xing Ph.D, a professor of the Machine Learning Department. Researchers from all three institutions will collaborate in the two new centers forming an ecosystem of knowledge and innovation.
Xing envisions the center developing technologies that will enhance a doctor’s ability to provide a high quality of healthcare. “Currently, doctors act as the bridge between the patient and the body of knowledge. The Center wants to expand this bridge to become more data driven and community dependent.” Doctors will help gather the necessary information by asking the right questions and can use the new tools to aid in their decision making.
Innovators like Xing hope to ride the wave of wearable technologies as a means to gather rich and highly dimensional data. He hopes that one day we will have a device that instantly links patients to an ecosystem of doctors; a drastic change from the appointment-based system used today.
Carnegie Mellon’s focus will largely be in the information technology sector, developing ways to utilize data.  Xing explained that currently, “Medical data has a very short life cycle; it is just stored and retrieved when necessary. The shift towards personalized medicine aims to use the data all the time. Your data will be used to enhance your experience as well provide clues about other people’s conditions. A large patient network can be used to make inferences doctors already do, but even faster and for larger groups of people. The future will be to use machine learning and artificial intelligence to make decisions. This center aims to lay the groundwork to develop these new technologies.”
As professor of machine learning, Xing has seen firsthand the advancements in the past decade that now enable computers to make inferences based on available data. Previously, computer science has primarily been used to develop operating systems and store data. “The maturity of the discipline has led to success in automation such as automatic speech translation and self-driving cars. Healthcare is ripe to be one of the next frontiers of innovation because it is high stakes and high risk,” Xing said.
Compared with other disciplines, making the correct decisions is extremely important because it directly affects people’s lives. A decade ago, the technology would not have been robust enough to be trusted to make these critical decisions. Xing’s past research involved using machine learning in a variety of fields related to medicine. One project focused on human genomic data by identifying variations in DNA that place individuals at a high risk for a given disease. So far this approach has been done in a weak statistical fashion unable to accurately identify the interactions between variations. In reality it is the combination of these variations that is iresponsible for some complex diseases. “Using machine learning we can build models using big genome data from patient populations and moving forward the goal is to create a personal model for each individual based on their genomic artifacts,” Xing explained. By using personalized genomic data, doctors and researchers can enhance and drastically change healthcare.
Another relevant project in Xing’s repertoire began as a computer vision project where the goal was to develop an algorithm to automatically detect an interesting event in a long video such as a surveillance tape. After this technology was developed, a doctor reached out to Xing and explained that in the ICU there is a critical need to monitor patients and also hold caregivers accountable. “For example, the technology could help ensure that the caregiver washes their hands thoroughly and frequently and can be used to protect against malpractice,” Xing said.
This center will allow innovators to provide doctors with their prototypes and doctors, in turn, will provide feedback to improve the technology. Both scientists and doctors will work to design the new technologies. Xing praised that the center enables interactions and collaborations with doctors that makes the partnership very unique. He noted that “the goal of the center is not to simply publish a paper or make headlines, but to make practical products that can be adopted by doctors and patients for a modernized healthcare.”

Last week Pam, a category five cyclone, hit the Pacific islands of Vanuatu. The devastating storm has been reported to have killed at least 24 people and has left over 70 percent of the population homeless. The Vanuatu president and Australia’s Climate Council are convinced this was not simply a freak storm. Due to climate change, the sea levels around Vanuatu have increased by 20 centimeters and the temperatures have risen slightly. Warmer temperatures cause bigger cyclones, and higher sea levels mean more water can be tossed around by the storm. Many attribute this storm to the increased carbon emissions that caused global climate change.
Vanuatu is a tiny, undeveloped country. They contribute little to carbon emissions and other pollution, especially compared to countries like the United States and China. Despite this, the islands of Vanuatu and countries like them suffer more from climate change than large, first world power houses do. Should more developed countries, who contribute the most to environmental changes, take responsibility for the damage they cause to our planet?
The first step is to decide who exactly should be held responsible for climate change. The immediate reaction is to charge entire countries, yet this might not be totally fair. There are many groups and companies within these large countries that make an effort to reduce their detrimental effects on the environment. On the other hand, certain industrial and government projects produce a lot of pollution. Toyota, for example, admits that its hybrid cars require a lot of energy and produce a lot of carbon emissions during production and that the lithium ion batteries produce an excessive amount of sulfur dioxide emissions. Individuals can also be responsible for carbon emissions. For example, air travel uses hundreds of gallons of fossil fuel per person per flight. Individuals can certainly be penalized for excess pollution or else be required to cut back on their carbon footprint. This suggests that blaming an entire country might not be the most effective way to distribute the blame.
Even if we can restrict the blame to a specific group of people today, should they be held responsible for the past? Two years ago China surpassed the United States for the first time in the amount of carbon emissions they produce. However, the United States has produced more total carbon emissions in the long run. It is easy to say that the United States contributed more to climate change, but it is difficult to make the people today pay for what has been done in the past.
Some Pugwash members stated that the U.S. does hold responsibility for its actions in the past. The U.S., for example, paid reparations to Native Americans, a group of people severely persecuted in the past. Others believed that placing the responsibility of the past on those today would be counterproductive to solving the problem. Just because other countries haven’t had as much time to develop as the U.S. does not mean that they should be excused.
One Pugwash member proposed the creation of an international committee of governments and companies to regulate the effect humans have on the environment. Regulation could include taxation on any production or shipments that have harmful effects to the environment, regulating the amount of carbon emissions companies can produce and restricting the thermostat use of households and buildings on a global scale. The problem with this solution is deciding who will be part of this community and how they can enforce the legislation. It is extremely difficult to create an effective international society that includes members representative of the world population, and ensure that all people participate and abide by the rules it sets.
Finally, Pugwash discussed whether every individual felt a moral obligation to aid in climate change. It is difficult for an individual to hold responsibility for climate change, because any positive or negative action they make will not create a tangible impact on the environment. However, if hundreds or thousands of people make the same decision, the effects will begin to become noticeable. Pugwash believes that individuals could choose to help the environment if they are educated and feel a moral obligation. Unfortunately, only one or neither of these conditions is met for most people. It appears the only solution is to find a way to incentivize people to cut back on their pollution.
If we continue behaving as we do now, life on Earth will rapidly become unsustainable. Even if we feel no moral obligation to it, changing how humans live is necessary for our own survival. Regardless of whether or not we are able to decide who is responsible, everyone should be aware of how their actions affect the world.

Email: it is something you use everyday. Marked by the well-known “@” symbol and sent and received instantaneously, it costs virtually nothing for a person in an apartment in Hong Kong to send his best wishes to his friend in New York. Email may not seem cool in the modern world, where it has become second nature, but it has changed how the world communicates since its creation in 1971. Email is something that is often misunderstood. Behind the scenes, it is certainly not as simple as the “write, save, send, receive” process we know.
Electronic mail, termed email, was at first only a message that one user sent to another on a single machine; in the past, a computer used to be a giant machine that people used dial-up terminals to access. It wasn’t until 1971 that the first modern email was sent by a man named Ray Tomlinson on the Advanced Research Projects Agency Network (ARPANET). Tomlinson’s breakthrough lead to the ability to send messages to other machine users via the Internet by addressing the destination using the @ symbol, a convention we still follow today. Over the past 40 years, email has evolved just like other computer systems: It now has sender and receiver information, a subject line, a message body, attachments, and it enables users to save a draft at any time.
To read and write email, of course, we need an email client, or what we call an email “service provider.” Some clients are stand-alone, like Microsoft Outlook, which is offered in Windows OS; other common ones, like Hotmail and Gmail, are based on webpages. But whichever you use, the client is the “interface” that displays directly to the users and allows them to read messages in their inbox.
Next, we need a email server that the client is connected to. Servers are software applications run on the Internet, and they listen to specific ports that people and programs will attach to. These Internet servers usually have a long list of user email accounts; for instance, our Andrew IDs, which are registered at domain “andrew.cmu.edu”. Then, if a person wants to send a second person a message, the first person’s email client essentially passes to the server the name of the second person’s account (name before @), and the server will then append the message to the text file related to the second user.
That is just a very brief introduction to a much more complex system. For most email users today, the system we face is actually made up of two different servers running on a server machine: Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP) and Post Office Protocol version 3 (POP3). In general, the SMTP is like a local postal office, which checks your postage and address and finally finds out where to send your mail. 
However, the SMTP cannot parse a domain name, such as cmu.edu, so instead it has to contact a Domain Name System server (DNS). For instance, the DNS would translate a domain like “cmu.edu” to “128.2.42.10”. After the SMTP collects all the required info, the message from the sender will be sent from that server to the target domain’s mail exchange server, an MTA (Mail Transfer Agent). This is like the post office of the destination, which will figure out where exactly to deliver the message.
Finally, for the person at the other end — the target or destination — in order for him to fetch the email, he must work with a client via Post Office Protocol (POP) or Internet Mail Access Protocol (IMAP). If you actually look at your email client settings, POP and IMAP are definitely two popular acronyms. POP, just as its name suggests, is a server from which you can collect the mail others have sent to you. In short, POP is something that your client will reach out to and download the message from to put it on your screen. 
But many users demand more than that with their email. One disadvantage of POP is that it is unidirectional: Once you download the message from the server to your computer, it will be stuck there. In other words, POP makes it quite difficult if you want to access the same message from another machine, say your laptop. That is where IMAP comes in as a remedy. This protocol ensures that even after your download, your mail stays on the email server. 
For example, when you check an email from Apple on your iPhone, the message will be marked as “read” and updated on the server. Subsequently, that status will be sent back so that all other clients are updated, no matter if you are later accessing the email with a laptop or an iPad.
Today, different communication protocols have been designed. While we have talked about the most popular and widely-used ones, there’s a lot more to the email system than it seems. For example, some users want to send encrypted messages. Another example is SMTP — although it’s a powerful tool, it has many strict requirements and limitations. 
Still, the emergence of email has completely revolutionized the way people communicate, transcending traditional physical mail systems. As it keeps improving, we will inevitably see a better, stronger, and more versatile email technology in the future.

New Alzheimer’s drug slows cognitive decline
A new, experimental drug developed by Biogen Indec sharply slowed decline in cognitive function in a small, clinical trial of Alzheimer’s patients. The drug, called aducanumab or BIIB037, is designed to rid the brain of amyloid plaque, which is widely believed to be the cause of dementia in Alzheimer’s patients.
The trial consisted of 166 patients randomly assigned to get either the drug or a placebo; the drug not only slowed cognitive decline but also substantially reduced plaque in the brain. Higher doses were more effective than lower doses. The results were presented in Nice, France, at the International Conference on Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s Diseases and Related Neurological Disorders. Biogen hopes to begin larger trials sometime this year.

Crocodile ancestor was top predator before dinosaurs
A newly discovered crocodilian ancestor, Carnufex carolinensis, is believed to have been North America’s top predator before dinosaurs arrived on the continent. Carnufex was a 9-foot long, land-dwelling crocodylomorph that walked on its hind legs, preying upon armored reptiles and early mammal relatives.
Paleontologists from North Carolina State University and the North Carolina Museum of Natural Sciences recovered parts of Carnufex’s skull, spine, and upper forelimb from the Pekin Formation in Chatham County, North Carolina. A complete image of the skull was produced using a high-resolution surface scanner after scanning the pieces. A paper entitled “Early crocodylomorph increases top tier predator diversity during rise of dinosaurs” was published in Scientific Reports.

Stars forming in dust cloud in nearby galaxy
An international team of researchers have discovered that over one million stars are forming in a dust cloud buried within a supernebula in a dwarf galaxy known as NGC 5253, in the constellation Centaurus. The dust surrounding these stars is approximately 15,000 times larger than the mass of our sun, and is around 3 million years old — relatively young in astronomical terms.
“I’ve been searching for the gas cloud that is forming the supernebula and its star cluster for years. Now we have detected it,” said Jean Turner, a professor of physics and astronomy in the University of California, Los Angeles College and lead author of the research.  The research was part of the Submillimeter Array project, and was published last Thursday in the journal Nature.

New 3-D printer inspired by Terminator 2
A new 3-D printing technique works 100 times faster than conventional 3-D printers by lifting objects out of a pool of resin. The technique was derived from a scene in Terminator 2, in which the T-1000 robot rises from a pot of molten metal. The idea was to have “an object rise out of a puddle in real time with essentially no waste,” explained Joseph DeSimone, a professor of chemistry at University of North Carolina and a founder of the company Carbon3D.
The technique, called Continuous Liquid Interface Production (CLIP), uses a moving platform to lift printed objects out of a reservoir of liquid resin. The technique combines pulses of light, solidifying the resin, and oxygen, which prevents parts of the resin from solidifying, to craft intricate three-dimensional objects.

Mushrooms found to glow in order to attract insects
The luminous fungus Neonothopanus gardneri, which grows at the base of palm trees in Brazilian forests, lights up to attract insects that will spread its spores, according to a recent study. To find the reason for the glow, scientists placed mushroom decoys at tree bases and lit some of the decoys with green LEDs to mimic the real mushroom’s bioluminescencewhile leaving the others without LEDs.
After five nights, the scientists found the luminescent decoys had more insects. They collected 12 insects from the dark mushrooms and 42 insects from the glowing ones, concluding that the purpose of the glow was to attract insects. It was also determined that the mushrooms follow a rhythm, which allows them to only light up at night. The study was published online in Current Biology.

Solar eclipse witnessed by millions in the UK
This past Friday, millions of people across the United Kingdom and Northern Europe witnessed a solar eclipse, which occurs when the moon comes between the Earth and the sun. BBC footage revealed interesting features regarding the eclipse, namely a clear view of “Baily’s beads,” the light at the edge of the Moon.
In all parts of the UK, the eclipse reached 83 percent, with the darkness peaking at about 09:35 GMT. The period of greatest darkness lasted nearly three minutes and occurred over a spot in the Norwegian Sea at 09:46 GMT. Researchers at the National Eclipse Weather Experiment asked the public to record weather conditions during the eclipse in order to improve future weather forecasting. The UK will not experience a solar eclipse of this magnitude again until 2026.

From the moment I stepped out of the airport into the breathtaking heat and oppressive smells of Haiti, I realized that it had been exactly one year since I had been truly uncomfortable — and I had missed that feeling. This year was the second time I had been to Haiti, and the country had just as much of an impact on me as it did the first time that I laid eyes upon its crystal blue waters, far-reaching dust, and stacks of houses.
Living in the Carnegie Mellon bubble isn’t fulfilling, I remembered. Traveling to a foreign country, another world, so close yet so distanced, is. Seeing how determined the citizens of Haiti are to realize their dreams of living in a better world reminds you that you can make an impact.
If a woman who is married to an abusive, unemployed man and has three children and one on the way can get a loan of $64 and change her life, what’s your excuse?
It’s hard to find the words to sum up all that I witnessed and experienced in the packed, weeklong adventure, but it all boils down to a lesson about culture.
For a country that has somehow sustained itself through natural disasters, human disasters, deadly diseases, and abuse from neighboring empires, Haiti and the people who live there remain mysteriously optimistic.
They refuse, proudly, any help or the slightest suggestion of giving up. When we visited the internally displaced persons camp and asked how we could help, we were met with proud, blank stares.
“We don’t want your money. We want your support. We want you to use your influence and your position to spread our story and make people remember us,” the director of the camp said.
They don’t want visitors to walk around and only see the remnants of buildings that crumbled in 2010, when the earthquake struck. They want you to walk around and notice the people who quietly go about every day, making small but powerful strides toward a better life for themselves and their children.
They want you to notice the small urban garden experiment on top of the hill and the cramped, hot tent next to it where hundreds of people stop by to pick up plastic baggies filled with pills, hopefully enough to sustain them until the next clinic opens.
They want you to see the children dancing and realize that they live in Cité Soleil, where gangs once ruled and thousands live in poverty.
They want you to walk into the orphanage that they run and be touched by the fact that it’s run not as a corrupt business, but as a family household where everyone is sister and brother.
They want you to hear the history of the country and realize that not only were they the first independent black nation to revolt, but that they’ve been suffering from the remnants of imperialism ever since.
They want you to look past the homes made of wooden stakes and tarps that have a faded USAID logo on it and see the people that live in them; the people who, if they had the same opportunities as you and I, would be the world’s next star soccer player, the next Monet, the next Einstein.
It’s hard, though. For years, we’ve been bombarded with photos and stories from on-the-ground reporters who see only the evil and the hopelessness. Our hostess, Rea Dol, who is so incredible she deserves an article of her own, aptly summed Haiti up: “If you just listened to what you heard on TV and the radio, why would you ever come to Haiti? You must see it yourself to know that Haiti has hope.”
Not everyone will go to Haiti. Not everyone will see what we saw in these past two years and be moved to action. But everyone should know of the hope that exists there and feel it themselves. Because the most important thing that I learned in Haiti is that no matter what nature, dictators, doctors, or police throw at you, if you’re breathing at the end of the day, you’re lucky to be where you are. And from there, it’s your duty to put yourself into making life better for yourself and those around you.

I do not exaggerate when I say that everyone needs to see Steubenville. Even though the School of Drama’s debut production of this play — conceived, directed, and written by drama masters students — closed this weekend, I have high hopes that Steubenville won’t end here. Not only is it a good show, but, more than that, it’s an important one.
The show dramatizes events surrounding the real-life 2012 sexual assault of a high school girl (referred to throughout as “Jane Doe” or “redacted”) in the small, sports-heavy Ohio town of Steubenville. Jane Doe was blackout drunk at a party when 16-year-old football players Ma’lik Richmond and Trent Mays repeatedly raped her. They proceeded to share texts, videos, and photos of the incident on various social media before Jane Doe herself was aware of what had happened.
The Steubenville case made headlines nationally for months. So, many of you may be familiar with it and as skeptical as I was that a show centered on such a sensitive subject could be at once tasteful and effective. My nervousness abated a good deal when I started worrying about actually being able to snag a ticket, considering all performances sold out within an hour of the box office opening. Little did I know, Steubenville would completely obliterate all of my half-formed expectations.
On a technical level, the show was among the most complicated I have seen. My gaze was immediately drawn to the several television screens directed toward the audience, the onstage camera on its tripod, and the three microphone stands in a line — each of which would play an integral part in the narrative. The multimedia integrated seamlessly throughout is all too appropriate, considering the extent to which the Steubenville case was defined by news coverage and social media.
To this end, heartbreaking text messages between Jane Doe and the perpetrators are displayed in real-time, and the actors assume the roles of television news reporters, re-enacting real commentary on the case. The audience is caught up in a flurry of victim-blaming, misogyny, and ridiculousness; it comes to a head when two male Fox News reporters gang up on a female correspondent, insisting that rapists are a distant, irreformable subcategory of men that women should defend themselves against with firearms. The choice to have technicians operate onstage heighten the intimacy and immediacy that the script already impresses upon the audience.
In its execution, Steubenville is no less than groundbreaking — a feat for which master’s student in directing Eleanor Bishop should take due credit. The “meat” of the show is the trial transcript, read in segments into the microphones with minimal vocal inflection. The clinical text is colored, however, by the actors tossing, crumbling, and otherwise letting each page fall from their hands after it is read. At particularly meaningful lines, they look straight ahead — giving the audience a moment to judge for themselves — and they take a synchronized deep breath. Before long, the audience appears to fall into rhythm and begins breathing along with them. Where the transcript was especially painful, the communal breathing was a comfort.
Equally fascinating is the play’s “Sleeping Beauty” element, which serves as an allegory for the Steubenville case and rape culture in general. The show opens with a lighthearted parody of the classic Disney love song (“One day soon, I’ll find my true love,” etc.). But what starts out as comic relief steadily descends into eeriness as it becomes clear the extent to which toxic ideas about love and sex are deeply entrenched in our society. Even our hallmarks of childhood have been marked with the belief that when the maiden says “no,” she must be chased, and when the maiden is sleeping, she can still be kissed.
Also contributing to Steubenville’s uniqueness are interwoven interviews with a diverse group of female students on love, sex, and feminism. As silent videos of the interviews play for the audience, the actors serve as the women’s voices — mimicking everything from their accents to their facial expressions. Questions such as “Did you have a sexual awakening?” add a fun voyeuristic element to the show; “Do you ever feel objectified?” had every woman in the audience nodding along; and “What would you say to Jane Doe?” gave me goose bumps.
While junior acting majors Zach Fifer and Colin Whitney make vital contributions to a brilliant ensemble performance, junior acting major Molly Griggs should especially be applauded. Griggs’s solo Beyoncé dance number could have been comical or just bizarre, but her barefaced commitment to it really made me believe it was her own personal source of empowerment. I couldn’t help but feel empowered along with her. At one point, Griggs breaks out of the dispassionate trial readings and assumes the role of Jane Doe. Voice breaking, she asks a witness to the crime — someone she once trusted — why he did nothing to stop it. The distinctive sounds of sniffling sounded throughout the audience.
One of the most admirable things about Steubenville is the obvious respect its creators have for Jane Doe. Her rape is never depicted on stage, and the more explicit and gratuitous parts of the trial are purposefully excluded. Trigger warnings adorn every piece of the play’s marketing campaign. Its brochure is thoroughly educational, featuring information and insight on Carnegie Mellon’s own “battle against sexual assault.” Far from exploiting Jane Doe’s trauma, Steubenville alone among heaps of media coverage seems to listen to Jane Doe’s voice, not to mention the millions of women like her.
“I want people to walk away with a more open mind,” said Fifer, adding that plenty of people who think they’re supporting women contribute to a toxic culture without knowing it. “I am part of the culture.... I can help with this, but I can also make it worse.” Fifer wants every woman watching Steubenville to feel “supported and not alone.”
The reason why I wish everyone could see Steubenville is that there is so much to learn from it, especially in a society where feminism is often a bad word and convicted rapists can be back on their football teams within two years. Steubenville’s message — beautifully and innovatively expressed — is more potent now than ever.

Dear Evan,
I don’t get out much, but when I do, I’m always way too concerned with being the first person there. Especially when we go out to bars! 
I went and saw this show for which my dramaturgy friend did whatever it is they do, and the plan for afterward was to go to The Yard with a bunch of people to celebrate. I waited until my friend left to walk over to Walnut Street, but when I got there, no one was there yet, and I panicked. I ended up hiding in some bushes across the street until everyone else showed up, rather than wait alone at the bar.
What can I do to start being ok with being first to a party?
Best,
Failing Incessantly to Reach Seat at The Inn Subsequent To Huddle of Ever-Weary Others, Really Starting to get Ticked
Dear FIRST IS THE WORST,
I don’t know if hiding in bushes across from a bar (and next to a shadier bar) late at night is the best thing you could have done. I’m not worried about you getting robbed — I'm worried about you scaring the crap out of some drunk guys that see a pair of eyes staring out of the bushes. Plus, if someone had to throw up, I’d imagine those bushes would be at the top of a short list of places to do that.
I recommend you consult your home copy of [ital]Magical Drafts and Potions[ital] for a concoction that might fit the bill, maybe one that can help boost self-confidence in uncomfortable settings. If you don’t happen to have the book, you can borrow it from m… my roommate. Yeah.
If you’d rather not go through the trouble — making potions is difficult, not to mention demoralizing — then I would pregame so heavily that you’ll only care about showing up early if you remember the night at all. This is assuming, of course, that you won’t just decide to get drunk at home and watch [ital]Parks and Recreation[ital], which is certainly a viable option.
If don’t want to go changin’, then I suggest incessantly texting your friends once you get to the venue, urging them to hurry up. Let’s face it: You’re not early — they’re always late.
But really, those bushes must be disgusting,
Evan Kahn

Gender roles often have disastrous consequences for people who struggle to fill their assigned stereotype. Last Wednesday, Carnegie Mellon had a special showing of a new film, The Mask You Live In, that focuses on how society’s narrow definition of masculinity can cause more harm than good.
The documentary was written, directed,  and produced by Jennifer Siebel Newsom, who performed the same roles in the creation of the popular film Miss Representation. Where Miss Representation examines the feminine stereotype, The Mask You Live In takes a similar look at how masculinity is constructed. Newsom partially funded the film on Kickstarter, where she raised over $100,000.
The movie surveyed a wide array of the troubles faced by boys and men as they try to navigate the realm of masculinity. A common theme was the command “be a man” and the cultural baggage that comes with living up to that ideal. To “be a man” means to not cry, to not be sensitive, to not let people mess with you, to respond with violence, to be angry, to drink, to womanize.
The film included interviews with a wide variety of individuals, both male and female, as well as clips of conversations men have with each other about masculinity. One of the more jarring and interesting clips included in the film was the conversation between a discussion leader and a group of inmates. Each of the incarcerated men ruminated on how their perceptions of being male or feelings of emasculation may have contributed to their criminal activity. One man confessed that he thought what had brought him to kill another human was partially the feeling of powerlessness and feeling beholden to another person.
There was also a strong emphasis throughout the movie on the relationship between fathers and sons, and the kind of parenting behavior that might exacerbate negative societal expectations for men and boys. Numerous men throughout the film discussed how their relationship with their fathers or the absence of their fathers, has affected their feelings of self-worth. In one heartwarming scene, a man talked about how his son had explained to his father that he was a sensitive boy, and that raising him as a single father since then has caused him to get him more into contact with his own feelings. Every week they put notes or letters to each other in a box and then read them on Sundays. The notes often contain feelings, thoughts, and demonstrations of affection.
Filmmakers punctuated moving interviews and powerful footage with statistics, and the statistics were frightening. Adolescent boys are more likely to drop out of school, be expelled, or even commit suicide than their female peers. Experts in psychology and sociology used these statistics as a jumping off point to discuss substance abuse and depression among teenage boys, and how acting out is often not taken seriously. Instead of delving into the reasons, thoughts, and feelings behind a young man’s actions, often parents and community members simply write them off as “a bad kid.” The film emphasized the need to look beyond bad behavior for root causes and ways of solving a national epidemic of underachieving boys.
Toward the middle of the movie, they showed a group of middle school boys working with a mentor to help break out of the “masculine” mask. They each had sheets of paper, and they were supposed to represent the inside and the outside of themselves. On one side they wrote the faces they present each day: happy, silly, fun, tough. When coming in and sitting down, and writing on the paper, the kids were all joking around and messing with each other and laughing.
It wasn’t until they threw their papers into the middle and picked up someone else’s, and read the opposite side: angry, sad, hurt. Then it grew quiet. They started leaning back in the chairs, or folding up inward on themselves. Some of them put arms around each other. “That’s not a coincidence that all of you wrote something like pain or sadness on that paper,” the teacher said.
This moment really struck me, because it just fit with my middle school — and onward — experience. It’s not ordinarily okay for guys to open up and have “weak” emotions or to be vulnerable. They have to fit into either the “strong and silent” stereotype or the “man-child” who never grows up. Neither one has room for close bonds and shared emotion. I felt tears, and wondered if this was the time for me to leave the room, as we were told in the beginning that it was okay to do. Then I realized that I shouldn’t be ashamed of crying.

From the Greek Sing Chairs: In our haste to calculate and write down the final scores, we made an error with who won third place in the competitive division. Although we announced Thoroughly Modern Millie as the winner, the true winner of third place was Aladdin. All of the scores that night were correct and still are. This mistake was not a calculations error. The issue had nothing to do with final scores but was our fault as we, in our haste, wrote down the wrong winner of third place doubles. All other winners in doubles, singles, and philanthropy are correct.
As a non-Greek affiliated student who had never seen Greek Sing before, I wasn’t quite sure what to expect Saturday night. As I walked up to the Soldiers and Sailors Memorial Hall, I was surprised to see the performers outside taking photos in costume. The excitement was already high. The performers themselves filled up most of the first-level seating in their elaborate costumes and makeup.
The show began with an impressive, fast-paced step performance by Lambda Phi Epsilon. The remaining numbers were split into doubles (a fraternity-sorority pair) and singles (one fraternity or sorority). Some groups chose to parse together songs and dialogue from a movie or musical, while others rewrote the story into a college setting. One group wrote an original musical. Almost all the groups used a live band, which I found particularly impressive.
In the singles category, Alpha Epsilon Pi took first place with their hilarious Spamalot, put in the context of fraternity brothers on a Monty Python-style adventure to White Castle. The original musical’s “You won’t succeed on Broadway [if you don’t have any Jews]” was a particular hit. The production was also littered with kosher jokes and jabs at other fraternities, like Sigma Alpha Epsilon’s cardboard cutout costumes. The win was thoroughly deserved — it was the wittiest originally rewritten piece of the night.
The second place prize in singles went to Sigma Alpha Epsilon for their original musical, Grocery Story. The fraternity used its signature painted cardboard costumes with short jean shorts. It opened with a Romeo and Juliet-inspired monologue and progressed to a feud between health foods and junk food at a local Giant Eagle. The hero, a Hot Pocket, had one of the best voices of the night. The show included an impressive selection of foods in costume, and small details like health food yoga sessions were especially funny. The foods resolved their differences when they discovered that healthy items taste better combined with junk food, like Twinkies and tofu. Both bizarre and funny, SAE deserved its second-place win with this piece.
Alpha Phi received third place for their rendition of Mean Girls, which also included a song from Legally Blonde and a plot referencing The Hunger Games, closing with a Taylor Swift song. The story was more far-reaching across genres and source material, so Alpha Phi was able to vary the dialogue and make the piece more original. I appreciated that Trang Pak was the only girl to emerge from the arena alive.
Though they did not place, Sigma Tau Gamma’s Avenue Q was funny and relevant to Carnegie Mellon, with songs about pining for college days and overcoming everyday stress. It was endearing, but fewer audience members were familiar with this musical and may have found it jarring (one song is titled “Everyone’s a little bit racist,” and Gary Coleman makes regular appearances). The rewritten sections were witty and the song selection was well done. They deserved more laughs than they got.
The other singles performances were School of Rock by Sigma Nu, about an underdog team competing for glory, and Star Trek by Delta Upsilon, about the crew of the Starship Enterprise. Both of these included impressive dance breaks and had quite a bit of original dialogue.
The doubles performances tended to stick to source material more closely, but the performances were just as impressive. The Lion King by Kappa Kappa Gamma and Phi Delta Theta included very impressive giraffe costumes, beautiful group dance choreography, and a clever transition from young Simba to his adult form (switching the actor’s race and gender).
Aladdin by alpha Kappa Delta Phi and Sigma Chi was a whirlwind of colorful, beautiful costumes and impressive group dancing. The set was particularly impressive, and the writing included a nice balance of Carnegie Mellon jokes. I would have liked to see this piece place in the final judging.
Pitch Perfect by Delta Gamma and Pi Kappa Alpha had the most original writing of the doubles shows, including fun jokes about “the other CMU” (it took place at Central Michigan University). I wish they had used more a cappella singing, but their live band was especially enthusiastic.
The winners in the doubles category were Thoroughly Modern Millie, Wicked, and Seussical the Musical, taking third, second, and first place respectively. All three shows were impressive.
Thoroughly Modern Millie was charming, as done by Alpha Chi Omega and Kappa Sigma. The soloist as Millie stood out especially. The group tap number was dazzling. This group may have had the highest all-around production value of the night, with their 1920s costumes and sparkling set.
Delta Delta Delta and Delta Tau Delta teamed up for Wicked, which showed incredible vocal power. The soloist on “defying gravity” won over the crowd, but I was also impressed by their use of ensemble voices to elevate the group songs.
The doubles winners, Kappa Alpha Theta and Sigma Phi Epsilon, deserved their victory with Seussical the Musical. The group pieces were stunning and the solo voices were perfectly suited to their roles. The costumes and set were fanciful. Some of my favorite touches included Horton the Elephant in an argyle sweater and the Cat in the Hat making faces and strange reactions in the background of each scene.
At the end of the evening, everyone was reminded why Greek Sing happens at all. As a philanthropy event, Greek Sing raised over $86,000 this year. A representative from Our Clubhouse, a cancer support organization, gave a volunteering award to Delta Gamma sorority. Shraddha Joshi, a postdoctoral fellow in Mechanical Engineering, spoke about her experience surviving leukemia and how Our Clubhouse helped her. She brought the audience to a standing ovation. It was satisfying to know that the people around me, still in makeup and costumes, were just as enthusiastic about supporting Our Clubhouse as they were about the competition.

I never knew how much I liked traveling on my own until I did it for the first time. It’s like the opposite of losing my virginity; before I went to Dublin I had all these fears that it was going to be horrible and I’d have a miserable, boring time. But then it happened, and it was actually a wonderfully stimulating experience that I didn’t want to end. It was a bit messy, though, thanks to Arthur Guinness.
There’s nothing quite like the sense of adventure that comes from slinging a backpack over your shoulder and boarding a budget airline flight to an unknown city. No real plan, no concrete idea of how I’m going to make it to the hostel, just trust in myself that I’m capable of making it all up as I go along.
Without having another set of tastes and interests to entertain, I can treat a city as my personal playground. I can wander the streets, peeping in to various stores and attractions, staying at each as long as I want. It was this aimlessness that led me to such treasures as the Irish National Gallery, the Musee de l’Orangerie and its fantastic room of Monet’s massive water lilies canvases, and an absinthe shop. I never thought it was possible for such a small amount of liquid to get me that buzzed for that long; I wasn’t fully right until three metro rides and a twenty minute walk back to the hostel.
This “rule of one,” that is when you travel by yourself, can only be fully proved by its opposite. I have taken trips with other people, and it was an enjoyable experience. It was nice to have company; people to share jokes, meals, and experiences with. I can assure you that the days definitely went by faster with others, and there were certainly more pictures (I loathe the idea of selfies, and the more people I meet the more alone I feel in this destination). But there were sacrifices, like being shaken out of a sleep and into a dreadful hangover at 9 a.m. to go tour the Edinburgh Castle. How anyone can drift into a peaceful sleep at a hostel is beyond me; the bunk beds are rocks that squeak with each breath you take, there’s always at least one person snoring like a freight train, and countless other unexplained noises that last all night. Somehow, though, this guy could do it, and I resented him the whole day for it. Democratic processes meant every decision needed to be debated endlessly until two members of the group surrendered that “they didn’t care, whatever you want to do.” There was an extended period of time spent searching for little bells in gift shops.
Traveling with others also means you meet fewer people. In the traveler’s bar in Paris I would spend every night with a great group of people, like Clinton the hilarious Australian and the ever-smiling Rodrigo, the Brazilian who kept me stocked with cigarettes the entire stay. There was also the kind group of Italians who passed around free shots like they were sticks of gum at a rave. Granted, traveling with others is just generally a safer experience; there was nothing resembling wandering around unfamiliar Manchester streets choked thick with fog at 1 a.m., searching for a place to sleep and having a group of drunk men in track suits standing outside a shady strip club start screaming at you in Polish and following you down the street. That kind of stuff only happens when you’re by yourself, and I’ll likely remember that moment until dementia snatches it up.
In a few days I’ll be boarding a flight to spend two weeks in other places I’ve never been where they speak languages I haven’t the faintest knowledge of. I will get lost. I will struggle to understand what exactly is being offered on a menu. People on the street will harass me for money because my dress and wide-eyes are a dead giveaway that I’m American. I will love every minute of it.

Before starting Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt, I was ready to jump on another comedy show. Each time I opened Netflix over break, the front page screamed at me with the show’s aggressively bright promo, tagged with the line “Created by Tina Fey and Robert Carlock.” I suppose that’s what got me to watch the show in the first place — Tina freaking Fey, star of 30 Rock and cast member and writer for Saturday Night Live. It was going to be amazing.
But then I actually watched it. For background, the show follows Kimmy Schmidt, one of the “Indiana Mole Women,” a group of women who were kept locked in a bunker by a cult leader. The women are rescued one day, a bystander’s testimony gets auto-tuned and goes viral, and the women become celebrities in their hometown and across America. Deprived of her formative teen years, Kimmy decides to stay in New York on a whim, fending for herself with little knowledge of current culture.
Only one season is available on Netflix right now with a total of 13 episodes less than half an hour each. I breezed through it within a day (which says a lot about my binge-watching habits, I guess), and while there were some laughs here and there, my reaction for most of the season was basically, “Haha! ... what?”
While the show has numerous funny moments and one-liners, there are other situations and setups that are borderline insensitive. I say borderline because, to be honest, I’m not sure whether they cross the line into offensive territory, even if the show’s writers tried to make light of murkier topics. The fact that the show pokes fun at women who were kidnapped and detained for 15 years and forced to believe that the world had ended by a charismatic cult leader is pretty dark (the situation is vaguely reminiscent of the Ariel Castro kidnappings that made national headlines back in 2013).
The show also sometimes successfully and comedically addresses race issues, but other times doesn’t. Kimmy’s best friend Titus, a gay black man who’s trying to make it in New York’s show business, gets harassed by a construction worker and notes, “Oh, I’m not even gonna know which box to check on the hate crime form.” I laughed a lot at Titus’s remarks, and his weird, random music video “Pinot Noir.” Titus is unapologetically funny, and is quick to call out others on wrongdoing. When the women who were kidnapped are discovered, a news screen can be seen with large, bold words “white women found” at the bottom of the screen, followed by a much smaller line of text reading “Hispanic woman also found,” referring to Donna Marie Nuñez (played by Sol Miranda). On the other hand, another character, Jacqueline Voorhees (played by Jane Krakowski) hides her Native American heritage by dying her hair blond and wearing blue contacts. While this pokes some fun at white privilege, since Jacqueline actively seeks to live a wealthy lifestyle in New York, the fact that the actress who plays her is blatantly white doesn’t make each scene with her any less awkward. In the season finale, Jacqueline attacks a marching band mascot after realizing she can’t hide from her past. She crushes the head of the costume — a Native American head — and proceeds to howl to the sky. It’s a bizarre situation, and ultimately a bizarre, distastefully done subplot.
That being said, the cast actors embody each character so well that I couldn’t imagine anyone else playing their parts. Ellie Kemper (from The Office) plays the naive and overly excited Kimmy Schmidt effortlessly. Tituss Burgess (Titus) and Jane Krakowski (Jacqueline) depict a level of shallowness and self-absorption that only they could pull off. And of course, Jon Hamm plays the gorgeous and frustratingly charismatic cult leader Reverend Richard Wayne Gary Wayne.
Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt has received an overwhelmingly positive response from critics and audience members alike, but it has some unforgivable shortcomings. The show still has a lot of potential, and I hope that it improves in its second season so that viewers don’t have to think, “Is it okay to laugh at this?” throughout each episode.

A television program is only as good as its series finale. A pilot is rarely well done; they tend to be sloppy, since writers are still in the process of finding the show’s voice, and its characters’ identities. By the third episode, episodes tend to become more cohesive and in-tune with where the show is going and what is driving it. Season finales are meant to be incomplete, with little character development and a whole lot of buildup; the central idea of these episodes is to leave the viewers wanting for more. However, the final episode of a series is final — it should leave viewers fulfilled and characters sufficiently developed so as to have some form of closure.
A very small amount of TV shows have been able to pull off seamless series finales that have truly delivered everything they needed to. Scrubs, Friends, How I Met Your Mother, Desperate Housewives, and Parks & Recreation all understood that in order to truly deliver a series finale, there must be some dwelling on the past and some looking into the future, and­­­, most important of all, closing complicated plot points. 
This week a show both beloved and hated by many ended on Friday night. Glee has had a lot of ups and downs these past six years. The finale was divided into two parts, both of which were well executed. The show’s creators decided to format the first episode of the finale like they did the first season: with grit, passion, and extremely flawed characters. The second part was truer to the current development of the program and had everything we have come to expect from the show: big numbers, big characters, and big emotionally driven moments.
The first episode of the series finale provided a very important feature for the entire series: It gave background for the characters, ensuring that viewers developed a sense of just how far the characters have come. The most important part of the episode was the one that focused on Finn Hudson, the character played by Cory Monteith, who died in 2013. This episode was not about new songs, new characters, new problems, or what will happen, rather, it was made to redirect our attention to the beginning, to the times when the characters were driven by very different objectives and when the future seemed most bleak. The second episode of the two-hour finale, titled “Dreams Come True,” gave every character his or her happy ending. While that may seem like naïve writing, it holds true to the show’s history. Viewers have to remember that the show is called Glee; it is about joy, about finding your way in life. Each character was given enough time to say their goodbyes and take their final bows. Some of these happy endings seemed far-fetched — especially Sue Sylvester’s (Jane Lynch) — however, others were extremely appropriate and showcased the importance of this show in pop culture.
Glee has impacted pop culture in many ways. It currently holds the record for most charted songs by an artist in the Billboard Hot 100 as of 2013. The show’s focus on music has helped bring musical theater to younger audiences that might not have the chance to experience it. It also made an effort to promote the arts in school. During its run, the show covered almost every single musical style and most of the biggest names in music, as well as some more obscure songs. 
The finale’s music had some high notes and some off-key moments. Certain songs did not fit the characters or the moment they were living, such as “Someday We’ll Be Together” by Diana Ross and The Supremes, and could have been replaced with more tender ballads that enhanced the sweet moments shared by the cast. That being said, the final song, “I Lived” by One Republic, perfectly encompassed the meaning of the show and the show’s purpose while showcasing the cast’s immense talent.
Finally, the show remained true to its origins by going to four of Mr. Schuester’s (Matthew Morrison), the original club director, lessons. In a flashback, we see Lillian Adler (the coach that inspired Mr. Schuester) telling her students that “Glee is about opening yourself up to joy”; in another flashback Rachel Berry (Lea Michele) says that “when we look back on our time here, we should be proud for what we did and who we included.” In the scenes set in the future, Rachel shows growth; she used to say that being a part of something special makes you special. Now, she said, “being a part of something special does not make you special. Something is special because you are a part of it.” Finally, in one of the closing scenes, Sue Sylvester said that she is proud of what the Glee club taught everyone that passed through it and that her experiences with them changed her for the better. She goes on to say that the club “sees the world not as it is, but as it should be,” and that it is one of the bravest things people can do. After her speech, the club performed for the last time, reuniting all of the voices that had gone through the club for one last moment gave one of the most tender moments in the entire tenure of the show. This finale was not perfect, and the middle was somewhat off, but it showcased how the show lived: starting strong, struggling through, and ending somehow stronger.

Odds are, you haven’t heard of the city I’m studying abroad in this semester. It’s called Granada, and it is in the south of Spain. It’s a city, but a small one, with a population of around 240,000 people. (Pittsburgh, for context, has a population of around 300,000.) Despite Granada’s lack of international prominence, it’s an absolutely fantastic place to spend a semester.
To start with, I should probably explain how I chose to spend five months living here. I’m not gonna lie, I kind of picked it at random. I’d heard of the city, through a class I took on premodern Spanish history in my freshman year. Most of what I remembered about it predated 1492, which was shockingly not that relevant to life in Granada today. But when I was looking over lists of cities in Spain that I could study in, I remembered the name and said, “Hey, that looks cool.”
Lucky for me, Granada is a really awesome place to spend five months of your life. One of the things I love most about the city is how small it is. I feel like I can experience and engage with the city’s character in a way that wouldn’t be possible in a larger city. I’ve visited both Madrid and Barcelona since coming here. I liked Madrid well enough, but didn’t really have a good sense of the city’s unique style. Spending time there just felt like being in any other enormous international city. I adored Barcelona, and I felt that it definitely had a much more unique culture, what with the city’s clear division between Gothic and Modernist architecture and its fascinating history. But even loving Barcelona as I did, I was a little overwhelmed by the sheer size of the city. Over 1.6 million people live within 40 square miles. I was only there for a few days, it’s true, but I think that the city is so massive that engaging with it in a meaningful way would be proved difficult for me, even with five months to explore. (Plus, Barcelona is far more expensive than a city like Granada, so even if I was there for five months, I would most definitely be broke by the end of it.)
Speaking of ways that Granada is particularly wallet-friendly, the city is one of the few places left in Spain that still offers free tapas with every round of drinks you order. Tapas, which are basically small snacks served in bars, can range from delicious to disappointing, given that in most places, you can’t actually pick what they give you. But given that the vast majority of tapas that I’ve had here have been some variant on bread and cheese and some kind of pork product, it’s hard to go wrong.
But the thing I’ve been enjoying most here is meeting and getting to know new people. Granada is a college town. The Universidad de Granada, which was founded in 1531, is one of the largest universities in Spain, with 60,000 students. There’s also a large international student program. To receive a degree from the university, students have to pass a foreign language test, and many of them pick English. This all amounts to there being a large population of people who are friendly and eager to practice their language skills. The Centro de Lenguas Modernas hosts intercambio events (literally, “exchange”) in which students can get together and practice, usually their English or their Spanish, respectively, but German and French come up, too.
The people at the intercambios tend to be really interesting; I’ve had some of the most striking conversations from my time here in Spain at those types of events. Just last week, I spent over an hour talking with a physics major from outside of Granada about what it was like for him to grow up in a country that was a dictatorship until the late 1970s. Talking to him made me feel how much I take for granted, having grown up in a system that’s been a representative democracy for so long. While United States politics are far from perfect, we don’t have the widespread cultural distrust of government that exists here in Spain.
Granada isn’t a big metropolitan center, and it’s not exactly a player on the international stage. But for the last three months, I’ve really been enjoying my time here, and am looking forward to the next two months before I head back to the U.S.

Evan Wineland and Connie Yang
Junior information systems major Evan Wineland is running for Student Body President with sophomore math major Connie Yang as his Student Body Vice President running mate.
The pair is running on a platform of raising student wages, improving student-faculty connections, and providing more opportunities to experience Pittsburgh.
Wineland and Yang propose to increase the current campus minimum wage from $7.25 per hour to $11 per hour by 2020, citing current hourly rates of $12 at Yale University, $13.25 at Stanford University, and $10 at Harvard University, among others. They argue that raising the wage will allow students to work fewer hours to become more involved elsewhere.
They also propose instituting student-faculty lunch programs, in which students can engage with faculty outside of the classroom. They hope to connect students better to the faculty who teach them by following models similar to those offered at Dartmouth College and Duke University.
Finally, they are pushing to give students more access to Pittsburgh with proposed events like a Craig Street Crawl, similar to the first Senate Strip District Crawl at the start of the school year, as well as routine discounts at various businesses for Carnegie Mellon Students.
“We are the only ticket that can claim that it has made tangible progress on every single item in our platform,” Wineland said via email. “Connie and I have been meeting with students, Warner Hall administrators, and city officials about our ideas since January.... We were pleased that in the debates last Friday, our platform stood out as the only one with clear ideas and concrete plans for execution.”
Wineland is currently the chair of Student Senate and a resident assistant in West Wing. He is involved with the Student Government Executive Committee, the President’s Student Advisory Council, and Highland Ambassadors. He is also a member of the Survivor Support Network and a brother of Sigma Phi Epsilon.
Yang is involved in the current SBP’s cabinet, the CMU math team, Women in Science, the William Lowell Putnam Mathematical Competition, CMU in Haiti, and Kappa Alpha Theta. She is also a GroupX instructor, chair of the university’s Proud to be Plaid committee, and a webpage designer for the Econobite project.
“My experience in Senate and in [Student Government] was perfectly complemented by [Connie’s] background working in the current Student Body President’s cabinet,” Wineland said in the email. “Having very different extra-curricular backgrounds means we’ve connected with a wide diversity of students on campus.”
Fun Facts
Wineland has been to the Middle East twice this year, most recently on the IMPAQT Spring Break trip to the CMUQ campus in Doha, Qatar.
Yang likes webpage and app development, math competitions, and did seven years of Tae Kwon Do before coming to Carnegie Mellon.
Divya Kothandapani and Mark Whiting
Junior electrical and computer engineering major Divya Kothandapani is running for Student Body President with third year Ph.D. candidate in mechanical engineering Mark Whiting as her Student Body Vice President running mate.
Kothandapani and Whiting are running on a platform of creating more transparency between administration and the student body, connecting students across majors, years, and clubs, and improving the student experience.
The pair proposes to increase transparency between administrators and the student body by instituting newsletters from Carnegie Mellon governing bodies illustrating such things as renovations, tuition increases, and transportation options. They also plan to publicize initiatives frequently and provide listening opportunities through resources like surveys, town halls, and individual conversations.
To increase connections between students and improve school spirit, the pair proposes improved phone apps and digital calendars for campus events. They also suggest more activities to bring together the entire campus community and more ways for graduate students and undergraduates to have the same opportunities for campus activities.
To improve the student experience and make campus safer, Kothandapani and Whiting, among a number of initiatives, want to begin recognizing non-academic achievements, streamlining student organization and activities processes, and providing more ways for college spirit to permeate across the student body. 
They also want all major committees to be focused on both the undergraduate and graduate experience.
“We represent the two largest groups on campus: undergraduates and graduates,” Kothandapani said. “With the varying range of needs and concerns from the graduate population, it is difficult to truly understand the graduate perspective unless you are a graduate student yourself. As a [graduate student], Mark will properly advocate on behalf of this group.”
Kothandapani is currently the student body vice president for finance and contributes to the current student body president’s advisory council and board of directors. 
She was previously chair of Senate’s business affairs committee, and is a Mudge House mentor. She is a member of the CIT Community Building Committee.
Whiting is the Graduate Student Assembly’s vice president for finance and the chief financial officer for the National Association of Graduate and Professional Students. He was previously an officer in the Explorers Club and an executive consultant for Public Communication for Researchers.
“We also both have extensive background and knowledge about campus finances and operations at both the undergrad and grad levels,” Kothandapani said. “Understanding how CMU’s finances work, where money can be pulled from, and how to best request funding resources puts us at an incredible advantage.”
Fun Facts
Kothandapani owns a farm in India with over 1,200 coconut trees. Fresh coconut water is her favorite drink.
Whiting has traveled to more countries than years the average Carnegie Mellon student has lived. He was born in France, but is Australian. However, he has lived in Korea longer than France or Australia.
JR Marshall and Jibby Ayo-Ani
Junior policy and management and Chinese studies double major JR Marshall is running for Student Body President (SBP) with running mate Jibby Ayo-Ani, a junior information systems major who hopes to become the Student Body Vice President. 
They are running on a platform focused on creating a more inclusive campus culture to represent all 13,000 students on campus, and help set the school on the path to being widely considered equal to other large name universities both inside and outside of the Ivy League.
“Our platform is also long term and short term. We believe the university is at ... a turning point in its history,” Marshall said. “It could become a household name. This is a focal year — this is a year where Student Government and the student body are going to determine if we get on that path.”
“We really centered our platform around where we believe this campus can go,” Ayo-Ani said of their goals. “We really want to provide a very deliverable platform.”
Based on the phrase “Reorient, Empower, Serve,” their goals include creating a “Reorientation Day” where students would take a day off from classes toward the middle of the semester. The day would be used to promote mindfulness and allow students to reflect on their time at the school. 
Other key planks of their platform include an increase in the frequency of the school’s shuttles and more routes taking students to more regions of the city. 
They also want to expand the number of businesses that accept DineX, and emphasize the need for more collaboration and student representation, as well as mental health awareness and measures to combat sexual assault and relationship violence.
Marshall led the founding of Carnegie Mellon’s Phi Delta Theta fraternity and served as president, which he says has given him leadership experience: “I worked with a bevy of people, students, advisors, professors, and some members of the larger Pittsburgh community. And I was able to get a real sense for the pulse of the campus. Every college is represented in my fraternity — international students from all over the world. I think that’s the most important portion of leadership.”
He has also served as chief of staff for the SBP for the past two years, which he says has given him first hand knowledge of what the position can and can’t do.
Ayo-Ani’s experience stems from being both a resident assistant and a member of the Delta Gamma sorority, serving as the vice president of the Pan-Hellenic council. She said “I’ve been practicing [listening to students] for the past two years.”
When asked why they felt they should run, Marshall said, “For me, it was a culmination of two and a half years of Carnegie Mellon, of being somebody who is a multidisciplinary student…. I’m really invested in this community and it would be a great omission to not put myself forward to make this happen.”
“This university has given us the world and we intend to do nothing less than give back to this community,” Ayo-Ani added.
Fun Facts
Ayo-Ani used to be on a National Champion jump rope team, and will be offering a StuCo on it in the future.
Marshall is a lifelong Pittsburgh Pirates fan and secretly a tap dancer.
Saif Jedidi and Ben Debebe
Senior statistics and economics double major Saif Jedidi is running for Student Body President (SBP) with sophomore computer science major Ben Debebe as the ticket’s Student Body Vice President (SBVP) candidate. They are running on a platform of “Decimating Opposition,” which parodies Evan Wineland and Connie Yang’s campaign. Wineland and Yang’s slogan is “Breaking Barriers.”
According to the pair’s website, which is stylistically almost identical to Wineland and Yang’s, the opposition that Jedidi and Debebe intend to decimate comes from wild life, student-faculty connections, and corruption. According to their website, they hope to hire 38 poachers to protect students from campus wildlife, create a program for students and faculty to have lunch, and make it easier for students to bribe professors and administrators.
When asked what sets them apart, Jedidi said via email, “I am by far the most qualified candidate for this position. For one, I am a graduating senior, whereas the other candidates are all juniors or younger. Vis-à-vis, furthermore, concordantly, I am older than them.”
“I think we care about how students feel,” Debebe said. “We’re not looking to make monumental changes in the Student Government. We’re looking to look out for our fellow students.”
Debebe made an earnest case for the platform, saying that one of the largest barriers on campus is the connection between students and faculty: “At the moment, it’s very difficult to reach out on a personal level. If we could give students a means of meeting up with teachers in a social setting — getting lunches, meeting at events — I think that would contribute to breaking down some of those barriers.”
Debebe indicated that student safety — and not just from bears — is at the moment a major issue: “I don’t think a lot of students feel safe on campus. You hear a lot of things about sexual assault and suicide, and I think in general people in Pittsburgh don’t feel safe. Saif and I are people who can really make students feel safe.”
He also believes that one of the largest issues with the current Student Government is a lack of transparency and accessibility for students: “I for one don’t really know about what happens on a case-by-case basis. If I got into office, addressing that would be something at the forefront of my agenda.”
While it is unclear what will happen if a graduating senior is elected, the current election rules allow any graduate or undergraduate student currently enrolled at Carnegie Mellon to run for elected positions. Jedidi’s senior status, as well as the campaign website, have led to speculation that their campaign is not a serious one. Their platform promotes poaching and bribery, and their campaign staff includes such members as Helga G. Pataki from the cartoon Hey Arnold!, Al Gore, and “All Sea Creatures.”
Jedidi emphasized being a senior in an email when asked what sets him apart from other candidates: “I would just like to emphasize again that my experience extends all the way to my senior year of college,” he wrote. “I am essentially done with my degree at this point, and will be leaving CMU in just a few months to become a real person, whereas all the other candidates will still be students next year. Does CMU really want someone who is still a student to be the Student Body President?”
Fun Fact
Jedidi and Debebe have the exact same cadence and number of syllables in their names, so they’re easy to beatbox together, like in the recording on their website.

Junior math major Benjamin Zhang is running unopposed for Student Body Vice President for Finance (SBVPF). 
Zhang’s platform emphasizes fiscal transparency and an improved Joint Funding Committee (JFC) allocation process.
Zhang has experience in student government; he currently serves in Student Senate for the Mellon College of Science and sits on the body’s Finance Committee, which metes out Senate’s special allocation fund. Zhang is also a member of the JFC, which is overseen by the SBVPF and allocates funding generated by the Student Activities Fee to over 200 campus organizations.
“One of my initiatives as SBVPF would be to increase fiscal transparency at all levels, including working with the university to release more financial information pertaining to how money is spent,” Zhang wrote in his platform. “Students should be informed about where their money goes to, whether it’s the student activities fee or tuition dollars.”
Zhang said during last Wednesday’s debate that fiscal transparency should not apply to just student government.
He promises to work with the university, as well as other organizations that parcel out money, such as the Student Dormitory Council (SDC), to make fiscal information more readily accessible for campus members.
Zhang is also placing a focus on making the JFC funding system more clear and giving student organization leaders a more prominent voice in the process.
“A lot of organizations are confused by how JFC allocates money, and how we come up with our metrics,” Zhang said on Wednesday. “One of my goals is to host an open metrics meeting, in which students can propose their own metrics.”
This metric, Zhang wrote in his platform, “will allow the JFC to make more informed decisions to create allocations that better serve the needs of student organizations.”
Zhang, according to his platform, is currently working on an initiative in Senate to index all funding sources at Carnegie Mellon that students and organizations can access.
Outside of Student Senate, Zhang does research for the Statistics Department and is a brother of Delta Tau Delta, as well as a member of the Spring Carnival Committee.
Fun Fact 
Zhang grew up in Canada and is an avid fan of hockey.

Trevor Hadick 
Trevor Hadick, a sophomore chemical engineering and engineering and public policy double major, is running for Student Body Vice President for Organizations (SBVPO) on a platform of increasing student involvement through open communication. Hadick ran for the position last year as well.
“Some of the things I wanted to fix last year still haven’t been fixed, so those things go on to my agenda first,” Hadick said. “The number of students who are involved is very low. It was my [agenda] last year and will continue to be on [it].”
Hadick also plans to change the way organizations reserve rooms. Currently, organizations book rooms through a website called 25Live. He thinks “it is a horrible system that makes planning events harder.”
He also said that he will focus on allocating student organization space through the University Center Allocation Board (UCAB), noting that is is important for the space to be divided fairly in the best interest of all organizations. UCAB makes decisions every other year as to which student organizations will gain access to student space, primarily on the third floor of the Jared L. Cohon University Center.
Hadick said he understands the difficulty of becoming recognized as a student organization as well, saying in his platform that the current process keeps “many great organizations on campus from finishing the application process.”
“I know how difficult it is and I think having gone through [organization processes] makes that much of a difference,” Hadick said of himself.
He is currently part of the student body president’s cabinet, as well as the treasurer for the men’s club soccer team. He is also part of the College of Engineering Community Building Committee (CBC).
He noted that a successful SBVPO would need to be openly communicative with others and willing to take criticism. 
He said it is important to have “the ability to make tough decisions for the best of this school. Since it is [a UCAB] year, as a group we will make tough decisions.” 
Hadick stressed the need to talk to organizations during the UCAB process to make sure they understand the decisions that the body makes regarding space access.
Fun Fact 
Hadick once ran his own photography business. He kept it for a year, but it didn't work out that well.
Ryan Lapré
Ryan LaPré, a sophomore math and economics double major, is running for Student Body Vice President for Organizations (SBVPO).
In his platform, he focuses on increasing the SBVPO’s contact and support for organizations, as well as improving the culture within student organizations at the university.
LaPré said that, if elected, he would first build a strong relationship with the Committee on Student Organizations (CoSo) and focus on the recognition process for young organizations.
“I would look at increasing communication and a strong communication between organizations,” LaPré said. “Usually, members will go through committee meetings and go to organization meetings and check in with ... administrators, but the contact tapers off. I would like to have increased communication throughout the year — keep open minds of communication so that if groups run into trouble at any point of the year, we can help them out [with] the support of Student Government.”
According to LaPré, another problem is the lack of record keeping for different organizations. In the CoSo process, there are not a lot of organization records being kept. 
If elected, LaPré plans to “increase the amount of knowledge the [SBVPO] keeps.”
“I would like to create a system where [the SBVPO] can keep the information of what groups are recognized as, and when and what kinds of questions do we ask throughout the year in the young recognition process,” LaPré said. “Every year we are not coming back to the same questions, which makes it a little unfair for them.”
Young organizations must go through a process with Student Government to become recognized by the body and receive Joint Funding Committee money.
LaPré said that being on CoSo has prepared him for being SBVPO: “Having someone [from CoSo] in the VPO position can keep the strong bond between members while also making them very effective for student organizations as much as we can.”
LaPré is also Chair of the Internal Development Committee of Student Senate, a member of Scotch ‘n’ Soda Theatre, and a member of the Spring Carnival Committee. He has also fenced with the Club Fencing team.
Fun Fact 
LaPré has never lost a game of Monopoly.

Since arriving at Carnegie Mellon, Nkindé Ambalo took the political fast track in student government. Just a year after joining, the sophomore mechanical engineering major has found himself the Academic Affairs Committee chair for Student Senate.
He has filled the shoes of last year’s chair, junior decision science major Julia Eddy, inheriting the responsibility of the Academic Relationship Code (ARC).
The ARC is a proposed guideline for students and teachers, intended to improve student-faculty relationships. Ambalo has been pushing the ARC within the Academic Affairs Committee since he assumed office in late August last year.
There are two reasons that the committee has pushed to complete the ARC, according to Ambalo. “Firstly, there are a lot of issues teachers have with students not being upfront with their coursework,” he said. “And secondly, in student opinion, there is an ambiguity about teachers’ policy on late work, excusable work that should be clearly laid out in the syllabus.”
Within the document, the committee focused primarily on the academic handling of what they call “exceptional circumstances.” Exceptional circumstances could include family emergencies, interviews for the professional world, or school sporting events that conflict with coursework. The committee seeks to make professors and students more open to communicating things like deadline issues or makeup dates. There has been very little legislation in the past that clearly defined what exceptional circumstances teachers should allow as a bare minimum.
To move the code from being merely a written document to a breathing policy, Ambalo enlisted the help of high-ranking administrators, like Vice Provost for Education Amy Burkert.
“I asked Dr. Burkert and faculty about the Academic Relationship Code,” Ambalo said on working with faculty. “And they said that they wanted this to happen because faculty can find it hard to trust students.”
Ambalo stressed the importance of these leaders’ support to institute widespread changes to faculty approaches. He cited the growing impatience faculty members have toward the way students approach conversation: “Some faculty members have had very bad experiences in the past. These are the things that fly around the water cooler. They talk about students lying to get off work or make up a test.”
In fact, these communication issues within the student body are the very reason Ambalo chose to put the ARC at the forefront of his agenda as chair.
Ambalo is most concerned about the culture of silence that he sees affecting the overall student body at Carnegie Mellon. Students are often not comfortable enough to speak up, Ambalo said. From discussing possible improvements to the student body stress culture to mobilizing city exploration with the Strip District crawl, and now with the ARC, Student Senate is moving forward with its goals to improve student life.

After a last minute cancellation the week before spring break, the mayor of Pittsburgh Bill Peduto visited Carnegie Mellon’s Student Senate last Thursday. Mayor Peduto, who gave only a few days notice for his visit to Margaret Morrison Hall’s Breed Hall for Senate’s weekly general body meeting, spoke about a range of topics relevant to students. He also took questions from senators and other students in attendance.
Evan Wineland, junior information systems major and chair of Student Senate, said that he had been in touch with a member of Peduto’s staff before the meeting, and had a long-running relationship with Dan Gilman (HSS ’04), a Carnegie Mellon alumnus and city councilman for Pittsburgh’s eighth district, who spoke to Senate with the mayor.
Mayor Peduto began by talking about public transportation in Pittsburgh, which is currently limited to buses and a light rail system, commonly known as “The T.” Earlier that day at the annual meeting of the Pittsburgh Downtown Partnership, Peduto announced a plan for reworking the streets in Downtown. The $32 million plan, Envision Downtown, aims to make streets downtown more aesthetically pleasing, less congested, and safer. Peduto said to Senate that he wants a system of “complete streets” — streets that are safe and efficient for pedestrians, drivers, bicyclists, and those taking public transportation.
“Today we announced a bold step,” Peduto said. “Today we announced a plan about what the next city is going to be. It’s not the city that David Lawrence saw, and we’re not going to demolish a thing — in fact, we’re going to preserve parts of it. And we’re going to create a complete streets model for all of Downtown, and then take it into Oakland.”
Penelope Ackerman, a sophomore materials science and engineering major, was particularly interested in what the mayor had to say about Pittsburgh’s roads: “I really liked what he said about transportation,” Ackerman said. “Probably because I’m doing research this summer on transportation, so that’s something I’m really interested in. So when he was mentioning the rail coming throughout the city and running southwest, I think that’s a major key in promoting people to go Downtown and travel through Pittsburgh. I think eventually that would allow students to get more engaged.”
When asked if the city had plans to significantly expand the T, Peduto said that it was unlikely. “No — that’s the answer,” Peduto said, noting that such infrastructure reform in other, similar cities took millions of dollars and spanned years. “We’ve had all this opportunity to do it. Someone somewhere in the ‘70s tried to. They called it the ‘spine line’ and then they just killed it, and no one’s done it again.”
Peduto echoed many of the points he made last time he visited Carnegie Mellon, when he spoke to the Pittsburgh Student Government Council about the future of the city. Peduto cited Carnegie Mellon president Richard Cyert for envisioning a future of Pittsburgh based on education and innovation, outside of its traditional steel mills and manufacturing core.
Gilman emphasized the importance of keeping young college graduates in Pittsburgh, saying, “we need to do more to let students know A) what’s happening in the city and B) how to affordably and easily experience it and achieve it. So they’ll be like ‘Wow, I’d love to live in Lawrenceville when I graduate, that’s a pretty sweet neighborhood,’ rather than like ‘Well, the only Lawrenceville I know is in New Jersey.’ ”
The mayor also mentioned the city’s nascent internship program; beginning this summer, the city will be taking 100 interns across its departments, including “the police, municipal investigations, planning, the Mayor’s office, engineering, [and] City Council,” Peduto said.
Gilman and Peduto ended their visit on a bright note for the city’s future. “My entire life, and I’m 50, I’ve never seen the city grow,” Peduto said. “And in the next 20 years, I want to see it grow by 20,000 [people].”

Heinz alumnus identified as 9/11 victim
The New York City medical examiner’s office said last Thursday that it positively identified a 1997 Heinz College alumnus as a victim of the Sept. 11, 2001 terrorist attack on the World Trade Center.
Matthew David Yarnell, 26, of Jersey City, N.J., was the 1,640th victim to be identified by the examiner’s office. 
He was vice president and programmer analyst in technology at the Fiduciary Trust Company International on the 97th floor of the south tower.
The office identified Yarnell by retesting DNA samples that they had collected in 2001 and 2002.
At the time of the attack, 2,753 people were reported missing, and while more than half have been identified, 1,113 people — or 40 percent — have yet to be identified.
Matt and Kim coming for Spring Carnival
Indie performers Matt and Kim are this years’ Spring Carnival Concert headliners.
Activities Board (AB) announced the artists on March 2 via a Spring Carnival Concert crossword puzzle that they had distributed across social media platforms before the announcement. When they revealed the artist, AB posted an updated crossword with the words “Matt,” “and,” “Kim” circled in yellow scattered throughout the puzzle.
Members of The Cut Magazine on March 1 correctly identified the artist via their own Facebook page with the same words circled in white.
Along with Matt and Kim, Philadelphia native RJD2 will perform. Matt and Kim are set to release their latest album New Glow on April 7, with such singles as “Get it” and “Hey Now.” They are well-known for “Daylight” from 2008’s album Grand.
Their most recent studio album before their upcoming album is 2012’s Lightning. RJD2’s most recent studio album More Is Than Isn’t was released in 2013.
CMU spinoff announces device at SXSW
A device developed at the Robotics Institute made its first appearance at the SXSW Interactive Festival in Austin,Texas.
The device, Speck, will track the quality of air within a person’s home by identifying the “level of fine particulate matter suspended in the air,” according to a Carnegie Mellon news release.
It will identify exposure to PM2.5, particles that can negatively affect the heart and lungs.
“Sometimes you can see air pollution as a haze in the distance, but in and around your home, it’s invisible,” said Illah Nourbakhsh, professor of robotics, in the news release. The device was created in Nourbakhsh’s CREATE lab and is now marketed by spinoff Airviz, Inc.
The release states that about 300 Specks are in use in the Pittsburgh area.
The device has a screen that shows the quality of air in the home, and records data about the air over time that can be uploaded to a database. The Heinz Endowment and Pittsburgh Foundation paid for 1,000 Specks to be used in public libraries, schools, and other groups in the Pittsburgh area, according to the release.

Despite the fact that our nation continues to move closer to marriage equality and increased personal freedom, Oklahoma's House voted to pass one of the largest attacks yet on the LGBTQ community and nonreligious citizens. 
Moving on to the state Senate for approval, this bill would restrict the performance of marriage ceremonies to judges, retired judges, and clergy. This would put county clerks out of business and make citizens dependent on clergy to perform most marriages. Not only is this law against the very ideals our nation was founded on, but it is a direct attack on individual groups of citizens.
This bill was a last attempt from Oklahoma conservatives to keep same-sex marriage out of their state. The sponsor of the bill, Representative Todd Russ, even stated that it was in response to marriage equality laws "stuck down [their] throats" by Congress. There is no logical reason to restrict marriage to being performed by clergy, and if passed by the Senate, the bill is bound to make its way to the Supreme Court in no time, after the state was already forced to allow same-sex marriage by the federal government.
The United States was founded on the idea of separation of church and state. A backer of the bill, Representative Dennis Johnson, states that, "Marriage was not instituted by government." He is entirely correct. However, inheritance laws, tax benefits, and other laws dictated by marriage were instituted by the government. Giving these benefits to only those with marriages recognized by clergy directly integrates religion into the government.
Ideally, no such federal marriage regulations would exist. People would be free to perform their own marriage ceremonies and share property and benefits with whomever they pleased. However, we do not live in this ideal world, and thousands upon thousands of pages of laws are dependent on marriage as a system of classification. Therefore, when clergy give a marriage license, they are also giving a voucher to all of these government benefits.
Despite the fact that this law is just utterly ridiculous, it does have one pretty great side effect. Ironically, by passing this law, the conservatives of Oklahoma are indirectly legalizing marriage equality in their state. In no part does their law mention that same-sex marriage ceremonies cannot also be performed by clergy. This has caused people to jump into becoming registered as clergy, which will most likely cause a spike in same-sex marriages carried out in the state. 
It is hard to believe that in 2015 states are still passing laws that integrate religion and government in ways that our Founding Fathers feared greatly. Yes, religion is a very important part of our society and, for many of us, who we are as people. However, when religion is mixed with government in a way as hateful as this bill proposes, it defeats the reasoning behind religion: to bring people together and bring meaning to their lives. Government and religion must remain two distinct and separate entities, as beliefs vary by person and dictating others based on one group's views is destructive to society.  
Citizens should be free to hold private marriage ceremonies free of government regulation, and should not be forced to be a member of a religious community to get their marriage identified by the state. While in the end the flaws of this bill will signal a win for marriage equality, the ideas from which this bill stemmed are backward thinking in nature and destructive to the progress of social freedom.

Carnegie Mellon’s Diversity Town Hall meeting left me disillusioned and disheartened. 
I love Carnegie Mellon, and over the years I have been — and continue to be — an ambassador for many of its programs, including IMPAQT, Pre-College, Under Construction, and the Washington Semester Program. I am grateful and humbled by the meaningful relationships and opportunities Carnegie Mellon has afforded me. They have undoubtedly shaped my professional trajectory. However, my love for this institution is slowly eroding and I am skeptical as to whether Carnegie Mellon’s leadership can steer our university toward becoming a more inclusive institution. 
On March 16, Carnegie Mellon hosted a Diversity Town Hall as a part of the Strategic Plan 2015 initiative. Carnegie Mellon’s Strategic Plan is a multi-pillar set of goals that creates the agenda for both campus initiatives and financial support. It was painful to sit in a replete, upscale Posner Center conference room and listen to the dearth of any specific vision for how to address Carnegie Mellon’s lack of diversity in its students, faculty, and staff. 
At the beginning of the Town Hall, administrators made it clear that the term “diversity” for their purposes is reduced to two categories: ethnicity/race (Black, Hispanic, and Native American) and gender. These categories are areas where institutional data is available (they recognized that diversity is much more than those two categories), but I hope administrators will look at other categories, such as first-generation status, moving forward. 
Though I appreciate the research put into the presentation, as many studies of our peer universities such as Cornell and the University of Michigan were cited, the lack of original, innovative solutions to recruiting and retaining diverse students, faculty, and staff communicated to me that this is only a priority for the university on paper. Between 2010 and 2014, the university increased its minority student enrollment by 1.1 percent. After this Town Hall, I have no hope that this figure will improve much, unless administrators include students, faculty, staff, and alumni in the conversation.
Throughout the presentation there were constant references to models our peer institutions have implemented. This approach is perfectly valid — why reinvent the wheel, after all? However, competitively benchmarking our practices with those of our peer institutions should inspire Carnegie Mellon administrators to innovate original solutions from an informed perspective. Our leaders should feel intrinsically motivated to reflect and assess our institution's societal impact. A mind-frame of incessant institutional comparisons is detrimental and unproductive for Carnegie Mellon leaders to work in. 
It begs the question: Why does Carnegie Mellon have such an inferiority complex? 
Recruitment was one of the topics touched upon at the Town Hall. The presenter of this topic mentioned the best practice is to nurture pipelines for minority students, including Carnegie Mellon's The Summer Academy for Mathematics and Science (SAMS) and Fusion Forum. However, to create robust, non-leaky pipelines means they must be well funded and well staffed. Our institution must expand funding for such programs and develop new ones that enable minority students to also explore aspects of Carnegie Mellon's exceptional arts, humanities, and social science programs. 
I would not be on campus today if it were not for a Celebration of Diversity (COD) weekend. I was able to connect with another first-generation Latino student and it made me believe I was worthy of enrolling at Carnegie Mellon as well. It made me believe this institution cared about students like me. 
Yet, funding for initiatives such as SAMS has been cut over the last few years. There was no mention of this in the Town Hall meeting. How can Carnegie Mellon brand itself as an institution that values diversity when it cuts funding to one of its most well-known diversity programs? 
Also, how can this institution decide to move forward in the next ten years when there was not a proper conversation about how to exactly move forward with recruitment? Rather than telling the community that our diversity programs will be evaluated, qualitative and quantitative data should have been presented to elicit specific feedback from the community. Offering this data would have made our conversation more fruitful as community members could also tackle the questions: How do we matriculate and graduate minority students on time?
Another disappointing aspect of the Town Hall was that first-generation students — like myself — were never mentioned. If Warner Hall does not have data on first-generation students (which would be surprising), then they must begin to collect it so they can better talk about socioeconomic diversity and create a supportive infrastructure for students. There is often an intersectionality between being a minority and a first-generation student that the administration must consider when thinking about creating support networks. 
Carnegie Mellon’s vision is to “meet the changing needs of society by building on its tradition of innovation, problem solving, and interdisciplinarity.” Carnegie Mellon cannot meet the changing needs of our society if our institution is not representative of the world it wants to mold. First-generation students are integral to this goal because their education will potentially have a ripple effect not only within their family, but also their community. 
Administrators should also think about creating programs for these students to connect with each other, as many other universities do. It saddens me that a conversation with any member of the administration about first-generation students has never come up in my time here. This is something Carnegie Mellon can do better. Looking back, much of the anxiety and self-consciousness I felt during my time at Carnegie Mellon was related to my first-generation status.
Throughout the Town Hall there was mention of “unconscious bias” in the hiring and recruitment process. They proposed sensitivity training as a way to mitigate this. When professors and staff have to undergo cultural professional development, however, it is something they tend to not take seriously. Being sensitive to cultural difference and aware of your cultural biases can only stem from years of conversation and critical thinking. Rather than use sensitivity training to make administrators feel like they are making our institution a more global place, what if we recruited staff and faculty who value, respect, and embody what we want our institution to become? 
Perhaps even more importantly, what if minorities occupied decision-making roles in Warner Hall? Carnegie Mellon’s staff and administration is largely homogeneous and a root to our campus's lack of inclusiveness. How can we become more inclusive if those decision-makers cannot relate to the issues of diversity themselves? 
Moving forward, I hope our institution expands our diversity initiatives in a way that makes sense for Carnegie Mellon. I hope we avoid our fixation on applying models from other institutions that do not take into account Pittsburgh’s uniqueness and our institution’s history. Rather, let us only look to these models as a starting ground to engender programs that will lead to meaningful change for our community.
I have been a champion for Carnegie Mellon for the last three years. I am enthusiastic about the opportunities available to students and am eternally grateful that I was able to accomplish more than I ever imagined I would in four years. But this Town Hall Meeting on Diversity deflated some of my pride. Our administration needs to commit to meaningfully transforming socioeconomically disadvantaged communities around this country and we need to think about how we can start doing that in Pittsburgh. 
I am calling for tangible action that directly leads to a more culturally inclusive campus in the next few years. I am calling for the committee on Carnegie Mellon’s 2015 Strategic Plan to host another Diversity Town Hall, this time bringing up specific recommendations for discussion. 
Ultimately, the decision as to which initiatives will be prioritized is up to a few men in positions of power. Before this decision is made, I ask the committee to present its specific recommendations to the public. Doing so will make the process transparent, whereby Carnegie Mellon’s community can hold its decision makers — not a diverse group — accountable. Investing in diversity should not be a decision ultimately left up to a select few, particularly when those in power are out-of-touch themselves with the issues they are discussing.

I'm never comfortable when I tell people that I'm going on a service trip. There's no casual way to say that I'm spending a week of my time in a third-world country, blindly and boldly trying to help — whatever that means. Some people are bubbling with praise, anxious to reassure me that I'm doing good and saving the world. Others are not so sure. I know why they think this, and, in fact, I can't help but agree with them. 
Service learning trips, especially those associated with churches or colleges, are inherently flawed, and it's hard not to feel like I'm feeding into that when I spend a week in Haiti. 
From the inside, a trip like that is life-changing, impactful, and truly invaluable. Visiting overcrowded, underfunded schools makes you realize just how lucky you are. Hearing how much people do with so little motivates you to try harder to make the best of your situation. And the connections that you make, both with those that you meet and those with whom you travel, prove to be strong, lasting bonds. 
But from the outside, society is sometimes skeptical of the true benefit of these trips. I've been asked if these trips make me feel superior, if I'm giving money to corrupt organizations, and perhaps most insulting of all, if I'm just participating in this trip for the résumé line. Is it really worth it, they wonder, to send fifteen students to Haiti when instead you could send all the money down by itself instead?
In moments of weakness, I find myself wondering the same thing. It is not, after all, easy to meet with people who have millions of dollars worth of need, and explain to them that we're here for a week to hand out money, or at least as much as we have. Here's $500, hope you can make that work, see you next year. It makes me feel guilty. 
It's not easy to ride around in vans for a week, feeling like everyone who sees you drive past is wondering why you're here and what you're doing. It makes me feel like I am propagating a stereotypical image: idealistic college student who thinks that she can change the world but only ends up changing her profile picture, as The Onion cheekily wrote. 
It's not easy to return to school and be swept up in life here, forgetting faces and stories and small tragedies that you encountered. It makes me feel ungrateful for the experiences and the impacts they made on me. 
Service trips are wrought with complications. These things aren't easy to do and many of the things we see are not easy to witness. But no matter how uncomfortable and ungrateful I may feel, I will return. 
Because along with all of that discomfort, there's a deep feeling of fulfillment that lays at the root of these trips. Part of the week is finding and recognizing your awkward moments, thinking about what truth lies within them and how to be a different kind of traveler. 
To be the kind of person that does not advertise privilege, the kind that seeks to listen more than preach, the kind that gives respect and attention yet demands nothing in return, the kind that spreads a message of hope, not help. The kind that only makes promises that they can keep. The kind that does not trivialize anyone or anything. The kind that people would want to have come back.
Service trips have the ability to change lives, both on the ground and in the group. But without humility, acceptance, and most importantly of all, respect, the lessons of these trips will fall upon deaf ears, and the world will continue to question the merits of service trips.

I'll admit it: I stopped watching Glee two seasons ago. Granted, I stuck around longer than most. The show was a revelation at first for an awkward teenage musical theatre enthusiast, and my initial investment kept me semi-masochistically enduring even as it descended into really, truly bad writing. Incidentally, my breaking point was Kurt and Blaine's first breakup (the only characters worth watching by then). I essentially said "screw this bull****" and never looked back. 
But that's not exactly true. I first looked back when Cory Monteith died two summers ago, because he was far too young — a celebrity of my generation's invention. I'm also looking back now, because Glee ended last Friday and I can't help feeling a residual, nostalgic wave of sadness. 
Glee has been a bad show for a most of its run. God knows its creators like to think it will go down in television history as "The Greatest Show Ever," despite the awful writing, utter neglect for continuity, and self-righteous "issue"-centrism. However, now that's all over, credit should be given where credit is due. More — and certainly earlier — than any other show, Glee demonstrated that diversity in television is both feasible and practical.
Justifiably, Glee took pride in playing the diversity card. It ran down the checklist of minorities: Black, gay, Latino, physically disabled, trans, mixed-race, mentally disabled, Asian, bisexual, Jewish, and so on. Problematic aspects of these characters aside (and there were plenty), no other show has yet represented minority groups to Glee's extent or prominence. 
Anybody who holds a minority identity knows that media representation is an invaluable resource. Good, accurate, positive television portrayals of minorities are of course the ideal, but for the most part those are as rare and precious as diamonds. Glee may not have offered many diamonds, but it certainly tossed out a whole bunch of cubic zirconia. For individuals starved for any character that validated their identity, Glee may not have been shiny or durable enough, but it was something. If Glee will be remembered for anything, it will be for its diversity. 
In this, if nothing else, other shows should take Glee as an example. Broad media representation is doable (Glee did it), and even if it by no means signals quality writing, good acting, or longevity in a show, at least it gives the critics something to remember favorably post-cancellation.

On Sunday, Carnegie Mellon hosted MOSAIC, its annual conference on gender. This year, the conference's theme was Deconstructing Gender: Beyond the Binary. 
Although the conference focused on traditional women's issues when it began in the 1990s, it has rightfully grown to address the larger issue of gender in response to the campus's growing needs as well as the many changes happening worldwide in terms of gender and moving past the binary. The entire event took place in the Jared L. Cohen University Center (CUC) with over 150 registered students.
The program included open discussions and presentations led by members of the campus community as well as guests from all over the Pittsburgh community. To list just a few, senior dramaturgy major and dramaturg of Stuebenville Rachel Abrams discussed society's effects on how we perceive sex and sexuality, senior English and linguistics major Jasmine Xie talked about non-binary individuals and their search for inclusion, Carnegie Mellon alumnus Harrison Apple talked about the Pittsburgh Queer History Project, and visiting scholar at the University of Pittsburgh Kerry J. Kauer talked about heterosexism and heteronormativity in women's sports. 
In addition to the talks and workshops, two exhibits titled A Step: International Women Empowerment through Digital Photography and New Imaginings: Photographic Self-Representations of Female Athletes were open to conference attendees all day.
In the opening remarks, Coordinator of Gender Programs and Sexual Violence Prevention Jess Klein asked attendees to imagine a world with no gender. Some proposed that there would be no homophobia or transphobia, no pink and blue aisles in children's stores, and no wage gap. However, others pointed out that there would be other issues of intersecting identities. Klein agreed, adding that one cultural problem cannot be eradicated without looking others.
It is fantastic to see Carnegie Mellon Student Life taking initiative and sponsoring this comprehensive event. As Jess Klein pointed out in her opening remarks, there is still much to do about the issue of gender as well as the many other issues associated with it. 
It will be exciting to see how MOSAIC affects the campus community and what directions it will take in the future. The Tartan hopes that Carnegie Mellon will host similar events in the future centered on diversity and social change.

It is (kind of) spring in Pittsburgh, and with the start of a new season comes the student government elections. 
The candidates have announced themselves and their teams, the platforms are in, and as of Friday, the debating has been done. As exciting as it has been to watch democracy in action on our own campus, the most thrilling part of the process hasn't started yet. 
From Thursday, March 26 at noon to Tuesday, March 31 at 6 p.m., both graduate and undergraduate students will have the chance to cast their votes and determine the next student body president, vice president, vice president for finance, vice president for organizations, and senators. 
While some students scoff at the idea of spending even a minute of their time making their voice heard, it is imperative that everyone who is eligible to vote do so in this election. 
There are a number of issues at stake, and no matter who wins, there is much to be done within the next year. The university is at an integral part of its existence, and the changes it undergoes within the next decade could very well determine the Carnegie Mellon reputation for years to come. 
Students have the potential to spark real change at Carnegie Mellon, both on campus and beyond. One of the many responsibilities that comes with this potential is an obligation to vote, and voting whenever the opportunity is afforded will enable students to better recognize the right to vote as a privilege and an honor.
The upcoming elections may not be of the utmost importance to everyone this year, but laying the groundwork for a sustainable democracy should be. 
Last year, the percentage of students that voted was 17.9, higher than previous years. Turnouts this year again have the potential to be much higher, and they should be. The Tartan urges students to cast their vote this week.

Last semester, the university began expanding and improving the Jared L. Cohon University Center (CUC). The construction will create 4,559 sq. ft. of empty, unfurnished space — "shell space" — on the third floor of the CUC.
The Undergraduate Student Senate bought 3025 sq. ft. of this shell space for $50,000, and the Graduate Student Assembly (GSA) bought 1534 sq. ft. Senate plans to use the space as a collaborative lounge and study place for students, according to Senate Chair and junior information systems major Evan Wineland. 
Senate provided the money partially with their operating budget for this fiscal year and partly with the reserve account, an account that holds rollover money left over after each semester. 
Senate polled students about the shell space as part of their annual Senate Week initiative. The survey received over a hundred responses and asked the question "Which of the following aspects of the Carnegie Mellon experience are most underserved by existing campus facilities?" The most popular answer was "collaborative study," followed closely by "dining." 
Senate took the results of the poll and decided to move forward with the idea of a lounge and study space. Recently, Senate established a Shell Space Committee that will determine the specific furnishings and interior of the yet-unbuilt space. 
Although Senate plans to use the shell space in way that benefits the student body at large, the process by which they acquired the space is questionable. The office of the Dean of Student Affairs Gina Casalegno and the office of the Vice President of Campus Affairs Michael Murphy gave Senate and the GSA first priority on bidding for the shell space; no other student organizations had a chance to bid on the space. This method of allocating the space, combined with Senate's generous JFC funding, gave student government an undue amount of influence on the construction of the expanded CUC.
Senate also spent $50,000 that could have been allocated to improve the Carnegie Mellon student experience in other ways. Although they polled students on what they would like to see the shell space used for, Senate did not consider their constituents — undergraduate students — when they purchased the space.
The university's administration, rather than furnishing the shell space themselves, farmed the task out to Student Government in a way that neglected the student body's needs and the properly democratic process that should be part of the university's dealings.
