Here we go, Buggy lovers: It’s that time of the year again. Spring is in the air and that means Carnival is right around the corner, so let’s make some predictions, shall we?
The same number of teams  as last year are out there, but we have two new additions and two organizations no longer running. An upstart group of first-years and a fraternity/sorority combo replace two dying organizations, each hoping to put on a good show in their first sweepstakes race. With fewer newly-built buggies this year, free rolls have featured a bounty of opportunities for the returning teams to perfect their lines, which will make for one of the closest contested races in recent memory. Let’s get on with it.
On the women’s side, I’m expecting more of the same. Rounding out the bottom of the pack will be PiKA’s A team, with their progressively slower push teams. Finishing slightly ahead will be Sig Ep A and SDC B. SPIRIT’s women pushers have looked impressive during rolls and as long as their troubling mechanical issues don’t show up on raceday, I’m predicting a third-place finish. Fringe’s downhill times will prove to be too much for SPIRIT women to overcome. Fringe A will take second place, however, as this race has turned into SDC A against the clock. With superior pushers and a top-of-the-line buggy, the SDC women will once again take home the title.
Moving on to the men’s races, I’m predicting a more tightly contested race than that of last year. Making the final cut in to Day 2 will be a surprising Sigma Nu, whose downhill times have been impressive and will make up for a group of slower-than-average pushers. Next, we will see a pair of B teams in PiKA and Fringe, who will simply be looking to provide insurance for their respective A teams. 
Barring any sort of issue in the Chute, the first of SDC’s three Day 2 teams will look to finish slightly ahead of Fringe B. Coming in at sixth place, we will see our first A team. Sig Ep A will rely on their group of strong and fast pushers to overcome a slower buggy. With spinouts looking like less and less of an issue at rolls, expect a very competitive race from SPIRIT’s A team, pushing them into a fifth-place finish. PiKA A will try to rebound from a disqualification and a half-year absence, but will fall short once again and end up in fourth. The top two organizations will again compete for the three most important trophies.
Both Fringe and SDC have consistently put up the top times at rolls and each has looked efficient on the hills. However, with ample time to practice without the added commitment of testing a new buggy, I expect SDC to run cleaner races and eliminate mistakes that have plagued them in the past. Fringe A will fall back to Earth after a two-year reign and finish third to SDC B and SDC A.
That’s all for me, folks. Good luck to all the teams. I will see you out on raceday, but you won’t ever see me.

After running track and wrestling in high school, junior Noel Titus made his way onto the Carnegie Mellon men’s track and field team. Currently, Titus is a civil and environmental engineering major. “I hope to be a Geotech engineer and do soil analysis,” Titus said, speaking to his future career goals.
Titus is proud to be a Tartan. “Going places and repping our school, no one here really knows what we do,” Titus said.
This season, Titus hopes to improve his performance on the second day of University Athletic Association Championships (UAAs). “My freshman and sophomore year I did well on the first day, but struggled on the second day,” Titus said. Outdoor UAAs are in two weeks at home for the track and field team. Currently, Titus is building up for his races. “I hurt my hamstring, but it is feeling better now. I mostly need to not be intimidated,” Titus said.
The most important competition of UAAs is at Washington University in St. Louis. “They have a ton of depth in sprints and jumps,” Titus said. “At indoor UAAs, we tied for second place and we don’t even have an indoor track.”
One of Titus’ most memorable moments on the track was running the 4x400 meter relay. “I had a rough day, I had bombed the 60- and 200-dash, coach decided that I was going to run in the 4x400 relay, and that I was going to be the anchor and I don’t usually run relays, so I was freaking out; it all worked out in the end. Doug O’Connell, Ben Nealey, and Mike Standish took second place,” Titus said.
Titus and the track and field team have had a lot of fun together. “One time in the shower, Ben saw a cockroach and shrieked. Then the cold water came on and he shrieked again,” Titus said, laughing.
Titus finds a great deal of support from his teammates. “Success is dependent on all the people who don’t compete, because I wouldn’t be able to motivate myself through all of the workouts without all of my teammates,” Titus said.
“Noel is one of the athletes on the team that everyone knows they can count on to come through in a pretty wide range of events when the pressure’s on. It’s great to have that sort of presence and leadership out of a junior,” said senior chemical and biomedical engineering major and teammate Robert Morhard.

After the match was originally postponed due to rain, the men’s tennis team took the court on Thursday against the Grove City College Wolverines. The Tartans swept the Wolverines with a 9–0 win. This win brought the Tartans to 11–5 overall for the season.
Even with senior captain Jeremy King out due to injury, the Tartans swept doubles. At No. 1 doubles, first-years Christian Heaney-Secord and William Duncan won 8–4, while the No. 2 duo of first-year Thomas Cooper and sophomore Julian Pearlman won 8–2. At No. 3 doubles, first-years Vinit Palayekar and Roshan Sriram ground out a doubles win in a tiebreaker 9–8 (7–2).
In singles play, the Tartans took every match in straight sets.
“It was a great match that gave some guys a chance to play that usually don’t,” Pearlman said.
On Saturday, the Tartans travelled to Grandville, Ohio, to take on the Denison University Big Red. The Tartans, currently ranked No. 13, defeated Denison, which stood at No. 29. The Tartans fought hard for their 5–4 victory.
In doubles, despite King’s absence, the Tartans took the lead 2–1 with 8–4 wins from the No. 1 pair of junior Duke Miller and Duncan. The Tartans also got a 8–2 win at No. 3 doubles from first-years Bryce Beisswanger and Heaney-Secord.
The battle continued in singles as Duncan grabbed a point for the Tartans with a 6–2, 6–3 win at No. 3 singles. Junior Harsha Rao pulled out a three-set victory at No. 4 singles with 6–4, 2–6, 6–1. The fifth win to clinch the victory came from Heaney-Secord in straight sets, both decided by a tie break 7–6 (7–3), 7–6 (8–6).

The No. 4-ranked women’s tennis team took on the No. 26-ranked Denison Big Red in Granville, Ohio, on Saturday. The Tartans continued their impressive season with a 7–2 victory over the Big Red, improving their record to 14–3 for the season.
First-year pair Bryn Raschke and Chelsea Motie, No. 2 doubles, and sophomore Katie Cecil and first-year Angela Pratt, No. 3 doubles, started the day off strong by winning their doubles matches 8–1 and 8–2, respectively. The senior duo of Courtney Chin and Laura Chen at No. 1 doubles fought hard, but eventually lost the first doubles in a tiebreaker 9–7.
As the day transitioned into the singles portion of the match, the Tartans took their play to the next level and won five of their six sets. At No. 1 singles, Cecil won the first game handily in straight sets 6–2, 6–2. This win was followed by another victory from Motie at No. 3 singles with 6–3, 6–3. Chen, No. 2 singles, then clinched the Tartans’ victory over the Big Red with her hard-fought comeback 6–7, 6–1, 6–2. Even after the victory was sealed, the Tartans kept their foot on the gas with Chin, No. 4 singles, winning in straight sets 6–4, 6–3.
The only singles loss of the day was a tough battle by Pratt at No. 5, winning the first set in a tiebreaker before dropping the last two 6–3, 6–3. Senior Cze-Ja Tam at No. 6 singles finished the day on a strong note for the Tartans by winning 8–3.
“It was tough waiting all day to play and playing indoors with only four courts, but we were able to adjust and pull out a solid win,” Tam said.
The Tartans took on No. 8-ranked Johns Hopkins at home on Sunday. The Tartans won 6–3. The Tartans compete next at University Athletic Association Championships  in Orlando, Fla.

In their first three games of the Stanley Cup Playoffs, the Pittsburgh Penguins’ offense has scored 12 goals. The problem is with their defense, which gave up 20 goals against the Philadelphia Flyers over the same time frame.
The playoffs opened Wednesday night at the CONSOL Energy Center. The Penguins came out strong, taking a commanding 3–0 lead after the first period. After holding the Flyers to only one goal in the second period, the Penguins’ defense gave out. The Flyers scored two quick goals in the third and finished off the comeback with a fast goal in overtime.
The second game also featured the Penguins at home, following a similar script. The Penguins again jumped out to a 2–0 lead, helped by Captain Sidney Crosby’s goal 15 seconds into the game. Although their defense was struggling, they also had leads of 3–1, 4–3, and 5–4 before the Flyers took their first lead of the game with less than 11 minutes left. The Flyers eventually won 8–5.
The Penguins now find themselves down 3–0 in this best of seven series, needing to win two games on the road in addition to two games at home to end the Flyers’ season. As was common during the regular season, the Penguins’ offense has the firepower to keep up with any team in the league.
Once the Penguins take a large two- or three-goal lead, they switch to a much more defensive style of play. However, this forces the team to play to their weaknesses.
The key for the Penguins to keep its season alive is to never let up. By continuing to attack and push the puck up the ice, the team can keep the pressure off their defense and minimize the shots on goalie Marc-Andre Fleury.
A team needs to play to its strengths, and for the Penguins that means pushing the puck into the Flyers’ zone and having an unrelenting offense. Unless the team realizes that no lead is safe with its defense, the season may quickly come to an end.

Students were turning wrenches, twisting screwdrivers, and writing code this past week in preparation for the upcoming Mobot competition, the annual “mobile robot” contest hosted by the School of Computer Science. The activities coincided well with the fact that it was National Robotics Week, which celebrates robotics research in the United States.
Mobot, which first made its debut at Carnegie Mellon 17 years ago as an alternative to the Buggy races at Spring Carnival, lets students from any discipline compete in a robotics challenge. Members of participating teams assemble mobots, autonomous self-driving robots equipped with motors and sensors that enable them to follow a white line painted on the ground and pass through systematically positioned gates. The course is located on the walkway in front of Wean Hall; teams are judged on accuracy and time.
Last Wednesday, the Mobot Committee hosted the $99 Mini Challenge, an event to allow Mobot participants to receive technical assistance with their mobots as well as compete in two smaller events. The “Slalom Challenge” required mobots to successfully pass through all of the gates in the slalom portion of the course, and the “Decision-Point Challenge” required mobots to make it past a section of the course consisting of diverging and converging white lines designed to confuse the vehicles.
“Imagine teaching someone how to ski a slalom, a downhill ski course. We’re teaching a robot to do the same thing,” said Nolan Hergert, a senior electrical and computer engineering major and a member of the $99 Mini Challenge’s winning team. Team Gaussian Blur — made up of Hergert and fellow senior electrical and computer engineering majors Billy Keyes and Chao Wang — cleared the slalom section of the course in 36.74 seconds.
Keyes explained that making a robot perform the task of following a white line is not nearly as easy as it sounds. “It’s easy for you to just say, ‘It’s the white paint on the ground!’ But how do you explain that to someone that doesn’t necessarily understand what white is? Or what a line is?”
The Final Mobot Slalom Races, to be held on Friday, will crown the team whose mobot successfully passes through the most gates in sequence in the shortest amount of time. Each team will be allowed two course runs, and each team’s best performing run will be used to compare to other teams’ best performances.
The event is sponsored by Lockheed Martin, General Motors, Two Sigma, Google, and Misumi USA. Lockheed Martin has “embraced the ability of our students and the many teams to find their unique solutions to some or all of the issues involved, at all levels of expertise,” said Catherine Copetas, the School of Computer Science assistant dean for industrial relations. “GM is a newer sponsor, and it goes without saying their involvement is a great testimonial to the students and the effort invested in these races.”
Beyond Carnegie Mellon, last week marked the third annual National Robotics Week. The U.S. House of Representatives passed a resolution in 2010 applying that designation to the second full week in April. Carnegie Mellon plans to have an organized celebration on Friday, involving Robotics Institute lab tours, lectures by robotics professors, and the Mobot race finals.
Hergert supports the goal of recognizing robotics. “Taking a week and celebrating all these devices and appliances and their creators that we take for granted merits a week in my opinion,” he said.

Autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) are a class of developmental disabilities with mysterious origins and profound effects on individuals and families. Much remains to be learned about ASDs; research groups from several fields at Carnegie Mellon, including psychology and human-computer interaction, are working to understand their complexities. Researchers from each of these disciplines take different approaches to understanding individuals affected by ASDs.
In the cognitive psychology department, members of professor Marcel Just’s research group seek to identify differences in brain mechanisms between autistic and non-autistic individuals. They use functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to detect regions and patterns of brain activity when individuals are asked to perform certain tasks. Ph.D. student Sarah Schipul uses this approach to understand how autistic individuals learn.
In one study, both autistic and non-autistic participants were trained to perform a particular task while undergoing a brain scan. While both groups were able to learn and perform the task successfully after training, results did show a difference in brain activation patterns. Whereas the control participants showed patterns of decreasing activation while learning the task, autistic participants did not. These findings suggest that, even though autistic individuals are capable of learning and performing a task, they are not able to reduce mental effort during the course of the learning process. 
“If brain imaging studies can reveal the nature of atypical behaviors in autism, we may be able to inform intervention studies that help individuals with autism adapt to the world around them,” Schipul said.
Fellow researcher Akiko Mizuno also uses fMRI in her research, but her focus is on understanding brain mechanisms involved with autistic people’s interpersonal interactions. Individuals with autism often have difficulties with social interaction and face challenges in understanding others. Mizuno and collaborators scanned brain activity while participants performed a language task requiring the comprehension and use of pronouns. Autistic individuals often had difficulty correctly processing pronouns, particularly the word “you.” While the individuals performed the task, anomalous activity was found in regions of the brain responsible for the concept of self-identity.
“We suspect that the neural process of understanding the social world in relation to oneself is altered in autism,” Mizuno said. The results from Mizuno’s work underscore the potential importance of training people with autism in what psychologists refer to as “perspective-taking” — putting oneself in others’ shoes.
Using a slightly different approach, researchers in the Human-Computer Interaction Institute (HCII) make use of the perspective-taking concept to design and improve computer systems from the viewpoint of people with autism. While human-computer interaction research has been applied to assist those who are severely impaired by autism, 2011 HCII Ph.D. graduate Moira Burke noticed that little research had examined the needs of high-functioning individuals.
“Adults on the high-functioning end of the autism spectrum — including those with Asperger’s — often don’t have obvious signs of a disability, and when they have difficulty interpreting nonverbal cues, they can come across as socially awkward and are rejected for it,” Burke said. “We need far more research that examines the strengths and needs of adults on the autism spectrum.” 
Burke sought to understand the social communication needs of high-functioning autistic individuals and to identify ways that computer-based communication could be used to help them. Through a series of observations and interviews with high-functioning autistic adults, Burke found that individuals experienced both benefits and particular challenges in communicating through email, text messages, and social networks. 
While some participants found reduced stress levels from interacting with others via computer, many participants also experienced difficulties in understanding some nuances of online social interaction, indicating that opportunities exist to improve computer-based experiences for these individuals. 
Research on autism encompasses a wide spectrum of disciplines and approaches. While these studies differ in approach, they are united in their common goal of understanding this disability, with the hopes of vastly improving quality of life for those affected by autism.

Artificial sweeteners can be found in many college staples, from diet sodas and low-fat yogurts to canned fruit and chewing gum. Their popularity is due in part to their advantage over regular sugar: They can greatly sweeten foods while avoiding the calories sugar adds. However, they are also the subject of controversy because of their potentially unhealthy effects. 
According to the Mayo Clinic, there are five widely used artificial sweeteners that have been approved by the FDA; these are called intense sweeteners because of their capability to sweeten foods several times more intensely than regular sugar. 
This characteristic of artificial sweeteners can be a pitfall for students wanting a healthy diet, said Paula Martin, a nutritionist at Carnegie Mellon. “Artificial sweeteners [are] many or a hundred times sweeter than naturally occurring sweeteners,” Martin explained. “This may change a person’s taste preference to only accept extremely sweet-tasting foods and thus reduce enjoyment of naturally sweetened foods like vegetables, fruits, and grains.”
According to Time magazine, the first artificial sweetener was discovered in 1879 by Johns Hopkins University scientist Constantin Fahlberg. He noticed that his food tasted especially sweet when he ate it with his hands after working on finding interesting uses for coal tar. After some research, Fahlberg was able to isolate the compound responsible for the sweet taste: saccharin. Soon after its discovery, some scientists tried to ban the use of saccharin in 1911 because they believed it was an adulterant that altered food substances. 
Saccharin was linked to cancer in rats in 1977, and although the FDA couldn’t ban the substance, the discovery made it mandatory for substances containing saccharin to carry a warning label. In 2000, saccharin was removed from the government’s list of suspected carcinogens, but the suspicion of its possible harmful side effects still worries many consumers. 
The sweetener cyclamate was widely used in the 1950s because it tasted more natural than saccharin and didn’t have a metallic aftertaste. However, in 1969, the government banned cyclamate because of studies linking it to cancer and to the formation of deformities in chicken embryos. Cyclamate is still approved for use in more than 55 countries, including Canada. 
The FDA has established an acceptable daily intake for each artificial sweetener, which ranges from five to 50 milligrams per kilogram. 
Using artificial sweeteners in baking can lead to interesting consequences, as senior electrical and computing engineering major Rebecca Willmott discovered. She recounted her experience: “I baked a cake with lemon cream icing for someone who couldn’t eat sugar once, and the artificial sweetener reacted with the acid in the lemon juice to create an expanding icing which ended up around [three times] the volume it started at.”
There are alternatives to artificial sweeteners. So-called novel sweeteners are becoming more popular. One of these, called stevia, is commonly prepared by drying stevia plants and extracting the sweetening compounds by a water extraction process. 
Other alternatives are natural sweeteners such as honey, maple syrup, and agave nectar. Although natural sweeteners are similar to regular sugar in that they can cause weight gain and tooth decay, many people prefer these because of their unique taste or possible health benefits. Many people consider these natural sweeteners to be safer than artificial sweeteners.
While it is true that no studies have conclusively shown that artificial sweeteners on the market should be banned, other studies — such as those conducted on rats at Purdue University — have suggested a link between consumption of artificial sweeteners and increase in body weight.
Currently, the American Dietetic Association recommends that all types of sweeteners can be enjoyed in moderation “when consumed in a diet that is guided by current federal nutrition recommendations.”

Baboons learn pre-reading skills
A team of French scientists announced last week that they have managed to teach six Guinea baboons (Papio papio) pre-reading — the ability to differentiate English words from non-English words. After six weeks of training, the baboons were consistently choosing four-letter English words displayed to them on a computer among an array of 7,832 four-letter non-words. They averaged 75 percent correct, with some scoring as high as 90 percent.
“It’s not just memorizing,” said team researcher Jonathan Grainger. “It’s picking up what we call these statistical regularities: Certain letter combinations appear more frequently in words than in non-words.”

Supercomputer simulates universe
A group of researchers, led by Jean-Michel Alimi at the Laboratoire Univers et Théorie in Paris, has performed the first ever computer simulation of the structuring of the observable universe. The simulation spans from the Big Bang to the present day, and its completion marks the first of three phases of the group’s larger project, dubbed “Deus: full universe run.” Two more runs will be completed by late May, with scientists expecting the simulations to provide support for other scientific endeavors to map out the universe. 
The tests were performed on France’s CURIE, one of the world’s most powerful supercomputers. CURIE’s 92,000 CPUs are capable of two petaflops — 2 quadrillion operations a second.

Team builds first quantum network
Scientists at the Max Plank Institute of Quantum Optics in Garching, Germany, have created the world’s first quantum network. The prototype features two single-atom “nodes” connected by a 21-meter-long fiber optic cable, with each node capable of both sending and receiving information. A single photon traveling through the cable relays the state of one quantum node to the other.
Typical electrical bits can only represent digital 0s or 1s at any given time. On the other hand, qubits — the computational bits that drive quantum information technologies — can represent 0s and 1s at the same time, a phenomenon known as superposition. Paired with quantum entanglement — another property that keeps two correlated quantum atoms in sync, even over vast distances — superposition would make a quantum network faster, more secure, and much more scalable than existing network infrastructures today.

Canadian mint opens app contest
The Royal Canadian Mint has announced the MintChip Challenge, a competition for software developers to create innovative mobile apps demonstrating the potential uses of MintChip. MintChip is a virtual e-currency fully backed by the Canadian government, making it the first digital currency to be fully backed by any government.
“As part of its research and development efforts, the mint has developed MintChip, which could be characterized as an evolution of physical money with the added benefits of being electronic,” said Canadian Mint CEO Ian Bennett.
The e-currency technology, which is more of a system or protocol than a physical item, allows its users to pay for low-cost items on the internet or physically with apps on their smartphones. Like other digital currencies such as BitCoin, MintChip relies on advanced cryptographic hashing techniques to provide security and anonymity for its users.

Engineered stem cells fight off HIV
Researchers at the University of California, Los Angeles have demonstrated for the first time that stem cells can be genetically engineered to attack HIV-infected cells in living organisms.
Expanding on previous research showing that the technique was possible, the team implanted living mice with human thymus tissue containing genetically engineered T-cell receptor molecules from cells that help fend off infection. Over the course of six weeks, the researchers discovered that the number of CD4 “helper” T-cells — which become depleted as a result of HIV infection — increased, while levels of HIV in the mice’s blood decreased.

Apple addresses Flashback malware
Apple has released a security update that removes most variants of the OS X trojan Flashback, though critics claim the company was too slow in releasing the patch. The trojan, first detected April 3 and believed to have infected up to 600,000 Macs, works by exploiting a vulnerability in the Java software framework in order to send users’ private information to unauthorized remote servers.
While the OS X platform has typically been lauded for being “virus-free,” a recent popularity surge in Apple’s Macbook and iMac models has given hackers more incentive to target the platform.

For many students, the Spring Carnival concert, hosted by AB Concerts, is one of the most exciting parts of Carnival. The combination of the growing expectation of a large concert by a well-known band and the strong sense of tradition associated with Carnival results in an inimitable cohesion within the Carnegie Mellon community. This year, Passion Pit has been chosen to headline the concert, with local indie pop band Donora and WRCT DJ Gusto as opening acts.
Passion Pit began as the solo project of audio engineer, vocalist, and keyboardist Michael Angelakos. His debut EP, Chunk of Change, was originally a gift he had given to his girlfriend that became popular among the student body at Emerson College, where Angelakos was studying at the time. The indie community embraced Passion Pit: a heartwarming conception, a bedroom production, some catchy hooks, and a singer with an endearing (or distracting, depending on your perspective) falsetto. Chunk of Change is pretty much a checklist for indie hype.
What made Chunk of Change truly noteworthy was its sometimes embarrassingly sincere lyrics. In a culture that fully embraces sarcasm and irony, it is rare to find any musician that rejects these values as thoroughly as Angelakos and his band. On 2008’s full-length Manners, the now fully formed Passion Pit reigned in the emotional bombast of the lyrics and produced a collection of nine songs more dynamic than any on Chunk of Change.
It is the unabashed excitement and complete apathy toward trendiness that makes Manners an enjoyable listen even four years after its release. An even stronger testament to Passion Pit’s music is the freshness of the band’s live performance. Since the group began touring in support of Manners, it has only had a catalogue of 15 or so songs to draw upon for their shows. Yet its performances are not simply a musical experience: They are also a kinesthetic one. A Passion Pit concert requires constant motion. Whether it’s jumping, dancing, or moshing, Passion Pit makes its fans want to move.
Passion Pit will be releasing its yet-to-be-named second album later this year. If the group’s concerts in the past months are any indication, Carnegie Mellon students can expect to hear members perform some new material during the upcoming performance.
The selection of Passion Pit for this year’s concert echoes the reality that Carnegie Mellon is not simply a center of innovation for computer science and technology, but also a hub of artistic culture. This idea that there is more to Carnegie Mellon than robots and bagpipes has been noticeable on campus this past year, especially when talking about the musical talents that have been performing on campus.
In addition to the numerous coffeehouses, musicals, orchestral performances, and singer-songwriter performances, Guster and Tokyo Police Club — both bands that have unique fan bases not dissimilar from the distinctive amalgam of Carnegie Mellon’s community — gave energetic and engaging performances this past fall.
This growing artistic culture on campus is perhaps one of the reasons that collegemagazine.com listed Carnegie Mellon as the ninth most hipster campus in the United States last December. After years of being written off as a geek school, the abundance of unique culture that exists at Carnegie Mellon and in the Pittsburgh area is finally being noticed by outsiders.
Our community is driven by passion. Similar to Passion Pit, Carnegie Mellon students largely ignore what is trendy or hip in favor of pursuing their own ideas of self-fulfillment and enjoyment. Saturday will mark the intersection of two sides of the same coin: a beloved indie band and a prominent technical college. And it’s sure to be a concert to remember.
Passion Pit will perform on Saturday at 8 p.m. on the Cut. In the case of rain, the concert will be held in Wiegand Gymnasium.

Amid the jovial chaos of Spring Carnival, the Carnegie Mellon Filmmaking Club is offering an opportunity to take a three-hour breather and gain some insight into the world of student filmmaking. The Loop: Carnival Film Festival 2012 will take place in McConomy Auditorium on Friday at 2 p.m. and will feature a selection of short student films.
The festival primarily serves to showcase and promote student films, although it’s also a tribute to the art of filmmaking. The festival’s title pays homage to the zoetrope, a device dating back to ancient China that creates the illusion of animation with a circular projection “loop” of moving images.
Beyond the historical context, the title also has a symbolic meaning: Like the rotating images of a zoetrope, the film festival cycles through different periods in the history of filmmaking, incorporating both the old and new. As the title suggests, this festival will take a back-to-the-basics approach, showcasing silent films and other tributes to movie-making techniques.
The Filmmaking Club, a student organization on campus that creates and educates about student films, has devoted many hours in preparation for organizing and hosting the event. Members of the club, who hail from a wide range of fields of study, learn key skills and work together on collaborative projects, several of which end up in the festival.
“We all come together and use our skills to make a really, really cool project,” said club president Benjamin Welmond, a senior art major with a focus in film.
Besides showcasing student work, the festival also strives to raise awareness for a little-explored activity on campus. Though the Filmmaking Club plays a central role in the festival, organizers of the event seek to expand interest in filmmaking to all students.
“It is our hope to reach out to more members of the CMU community,” said Hannah Polack, a sophomore professional and creative writing double major and public relations manager for the festival.
By attending the festival, viewers will also gain an appreciation for the extent of the work that goes into filmmaking. For the students who produce these films, making movies is often harder than it seems. “There’s so much more than just a camera and a script,” Welmond said.
According to Welmond, the filmmaking process is tedious and difficult, and many students encounter failure before creating a successful film. The results can be highly rewarding, however. “It’s hard, but eventually you’ll make it if you keep trying,” he said.
The students whose work will be on display this Friday will surely experience this sense of gratification from seeing their films on the big screen and from introducing other Carnegie Mellon students to the nature of their work in filmmaking.

When Elvis Costello wrote “Little Triggers” in 1978, little could he have known that 27 years later it would lend its name to the band keeping quality new-wave and indie rock alive in Pittsburgh. On the verge of officially releasing its second studio album and with more than 240 shows under its belt, Triggers will be performing at three different locations on Carnegie Mellon’s campus in the next two weeks, including the Midway stage during Spring Carnival.
According to Triggers guitarist and co-lead vocalist Adam Rousseau, who graduated from Carnegie Mellon in 2003 with a degree in art, the group was founded in 2005 when four “twenty-something” musicians, all recently fired from different bands, “coalesced and formed something new, as the rejects of other groups.” Along with drummer Rich “Woody” Kawood — a 2005 Carnegie Mellon graduate — bassist Joe Kasler, and keyboardist/vocalist Brett Zoric, Rousseau now brings upbeat and refreshingly original music to stages all around the Northeast.
Triggers identifies as a rock and roll group, but strives to transcend any one genre. “We’ve been compared to Elvis Costello or Spoon ... but we try to keep the songs as diverse as possible,” Rousseau said. 
The majority of the songwriting is done by Zoric and Rousseau. “We’ll bring in either a fully formed song or most of an idea, and then it sort of gets fleshed out from there,” Rousseau said. “Everybody contributes to the arrangement process ... and many times something we’ll come in with will end up sort of totally transformed and completely different by the end.”
Complete with distorted guitar leads and catchy, defiant vocal hooks, Triggers does not disappoint as a straightforward rock outfit. It does, however, offer a bit more flavor than your average rock group. The group emulates from track to track the Clash-inspired punk rock of the early ’90s, mid-tempo rockabilly shuffles reminiscent of Johnny Cash, and driving alternative rock in the vein of Franz Ferdinand, all composed and arranged with a smart, distinct, indie pop sensibility.
“There’s been some intra-band turmoil over the years,” Rousseau said, explaining the group’s internal dynamic. “I don’t think there’s been a time when at least somebody didn’t want to quit, if they didn’t actually quit. [But] somehow we’ve managed to stay together for seven years, so there must be some kind of glue keeping us together.” Commenting on those experiences deemed typical of most rock musicians, if not musicians in general, he added that Triggers has “played some interesting shows ... where stuff’s got broken, people’s teeth have gotten broken. If you play enough shows, some [stuff’s] gonna go down.”
With that said, Triggers has established itself as an excellent group to hear live. All four members sing in various capacities, and several are multi-instrumentalists, adding unique style and texture to each song with everything from hand-percussion to synthesizers. While Triggers “[hopes] for a decent break to keep [them] going” according to Kawood, at their most fundamental, they are a group of guys who love to write and perform music and, despite tribulations, love being in a band together.
Triggers’ official CD release show for its newest album, Forcing a Smile, will be held at 9:30 p.m. on Friday at brillobox. The band will be performing live on WRCT 88.3 FM’s “Advanced Calculus” at 7 p.m. on Monday, at the Midway Tent at 5 p.m. on Thursday, and at The Underground at 8:30 p.m. on April 26.

Students wandering into the College of Fine Arts (CFA)building last week may have noticed a lot of paper rope hanging across the Great Hall. The installation, by artists Wade Kavanaugh and Stephen Nguyen, was a major feature of this year’s Jill Watson Festival Across the Arts.
The School of Architecture hosted the annual festival this past weekend. The festival, more commonly known as wats:ON?, featured guest speakers, demonstrations, workshops, and installations centered around the theme of “transformer.”
The festival is an annual tribute to Jill Watson — a Carnegie Mellon alumna, adjunct faculty member, and local architect — who died in a plane crash in 1996. This marked the 15th year of the festival, which celebrates Watson’s “commitment to an interdisciplinary philosophy,” according to the festival’s website.
The wats:ON? theme this year was meant to build off this interdisciplinary idea and inspire questions about the transformation of architecture, art, and technology from materials to finished projects. All of the presenters demonstrated a transformative feature, whether it was transforming their bodies into instruments, rolled-up paper into sculpture, or an Arduino — an open-source single-board microcontroller — into a sewable patch.
“The magic of moving from pieces of material to something remarkable, that transition is really amazing,” said Pablo Garcia, assistant professor in the School of Architecture and co-curator of the festival with adjunct assistant professor Spike Wolff. “The transformation is really the part that we’re interested in. These people make the transformation visible.”
According to Garcia, the co-curators asked themselves, “Who can we bring in who will amaze people and surprise them?” while planning the festival. The result led them to the theme of transformer. “The transformer theme has a lot to do with exactly that, but people who do it with almost the minimum amount,” Garcia said. “These aren’t people who are making complex things out of complex things with stuff that’s over people’s head.”
The festival opened on Thursday with a presentation by Leah Buechley, an associate professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) Media Lab and director of the High-Low Tech research group. Buechley’s talk, titled “Expressive Electronics: Sketching, Sewing, and Sharing,” was cosponsored by the Human-Computer Interaction Institute’s Z-Axis seminar series and focused on the “diversification of electronics,” in Buechley’s own words.
Buechley and her team of graduate students at MIT focus on “helping diverse people create diverse technology using diverse methods through diverse processes.” She presented an example of their work: a rearranged Arduino into a sewable patch, called the LilyPad Arduino, which has expanded the audience for technology by altering traditional gender patterns in technology and computation.
Buechley, like the rest of the presenters and participants, was chosen because of her focus on the transformation of some aspect of her work. For Buechley it was technology and computation. For percussionist and rhythm dancer Keith Terry, it was his body.
Terry performed to a full audience in the Alumni Concert Hall on Friday. In a performance centered on sound and movement, he transformed his body into a multi-faceted instrument. “Terry’s a performer who essentially has nothing — just his body — and he can make an amazing array of sounds and beats and rhythms,” Garcia said. His performance on Friday was highly interactive; he taught audience members the basics of numerous types of body music and dance, including hambone and kecak.
Terry closed his presentation by discussing visual rhythms and the rhythmic qualities of architecture. After assigning pitches and sounds to various aspects of the room — including columns, wall features, and a row of timpanis — he joked, “We could spend the rest of the festival playing this room.”
The architecture of the College of Fine Arts building was also a recurring theme in the festival. While Terry found music in the architecture, Kavanaugh and Nguyen faced limitations created by the building while they were planning their installation.
Kavanaugh and Nguyen gave a casual lecture on Saturday night as a closing to the festival, discussing their previous work and their most recent project, titled “Tug O’ War,” which they had installed in CFA over the previous few days.
Their installation included nearly four miles of paper rope and showed how creative ideas could transform a challenging space into something amazing using common materials.
Kavanaugh and Nguyen have worked together on numerous collaborative projects in the past, usually involving paper, an economical and available material. They focus on movement and the viewer’s experience in their work. “We try to keep an element of play in everything we make,” Kavanaugh said.
“One of the goals for the wats:ON? festival is to be wondrous, to amaze, to inspire,” Garcia said. “And I think that’s one way that you can connect the five schools in the College of Fine Arts, which the festival serves. It’s hard to connect music to drama to architecture to art to design, but one of the things that they do is they are this creative endeavor that is usually amazing and really inspiring and wonderful.”

Carnegie Mellon’s concert choir performed with the Pittsburgh Symphony Orchestra (PSO) at Heinz Hall on Friday night. The program was titled “Do You Hear the People Sing?” and featured the music of French composer Claude-Michel Schönberg and musical theater lyricist Alain Boublil, who collaborated to produce such musical masterpieces as Miss Saigon and Les Misérables. The concert was a musical review-style show that featured the concert choir and six professional soloists.
Conducted by Jack Everly, the principal pops conductor with the Baltimore Symphony Orchestra, the PSO made music at its best. Schönberg’s melodies were played so beautifully and with such emotion, they warmed the hearts of audience members. Favorite songs such as “Master of the House,” “Bring Him Home,” and “One Day More” did not disappoint.
The soloist lineup for this performance was quite interesting and featured talented, young Broadway stars as well as the renowned theater veteran Terrence Mann. The list of performers included Broadway performers Eric Kunze, Jennifer Paz, Kathy Voytko, Marie Zamora, and Ben Crawford.
Unfortunately, Mann incurred vocal injuries after the first performance on Thursday night and was unable to perform all of his scheduled numbers on Friday. While he did visit the stage to give a charismatic performance of “Master of the House” and say a few words, it was disappointing that he could not sing the famous Les Mis ballad, “Stars.”
In the absence of Mann, however, Crawford did not disappoint. The young singer was recruited to fill in for Mann for the remainder of the show’s run, which continued through Sunday. Crawford’s rendition of “Stars” was stunning. He sang with grand emotion and beautiful phrasing, and his voice rang throughout the theater. He had a clear, strong baritone sound that earned him a rousing ovation from the packed house.
The other soloists were not very engaging. Voytko did give an impressive performance of the new song “Maybe,” which will be premiered in the 2013 revival of Miss Saigon. However, Zamora and Paz were less impressive. They seemed to lack the vocal strength required to fill a space with the grand music of Schönberg and Boublil. Unfortunately, Paz and Voytko’s joint rendition of “I Dreamed a Dream” at the end of Act 1 was disappointing. Their pop version was influenced by the television show Glee, which may have engaged the audience if done well, but the singing was imprecise.
Overall, the program’s soloists were successfully aided by the Carnegie Mellon Concert Choir. Directed by Carnegie Mellon’s director of choral studies Robert Page, the choir did not disappoint: The musicality they presented was evident throughout the performance. It was obvious that each member was extremely dedicated to and engaged with the music. The shining moments for the choir were in the songs “One Day More” and “Do You Hear the People Sing.” The chorus was also very engaging during “Master of the House.”
In all, the PSO’s “Do You Hear the People Sing?” was an entertaining night of music. The musicians played with remarkable beauty and presented this beloved music at its best.

A room-sized, serpentine plastic structure is not what many visitors expect to find at a gallery exhibition, but viewers warmly greeted this artistic curiosity at the opening reception for the In(Klein) exhibition at the Frame Gallery last Friday. Created by fourth-year architecture majors Michael Jeffers, Anna Rosenblum, Liam Lowe, and Joe Colarusso, In(Klein) presents a perplexing and captivating challenge to viewers’ perceptions of the space around them.
The exhibition consists of a single piece that spans the entire room, made from dozens of triangular plastic cutouts, each about the length of a person’s forearm. Together, the plastic cutouts resemble large, transparent scales. The effect is, indeed, a bit serpentine; the structure undulates and twists upon itself as it stretches across the room in the shape of an elaborate, three-dimensional figure eight.
Rosenblum explained that the inspiration for the structure’s intriguing shape originally came to the artists when designing an elementary school with a winding structure wrapped around the building. The artists submitted their proposal and ultimately won the Frame Gallery Grant, which offers $300 to an individual or group of students that can create a site-specific work that alters perceptions of space.
The scale is perhaps the most impressive aspect of the piece. Although the gallery itself is no bigger than about twice the size of an average dorm room, the structure takes up the entire space, suspended from the ceiling by no more than a few strings at various junctures. Assembling the structure was no easy task, according to Colarusso. He and his three colleagues built most of the piece on site over the course of one night.
Despite the scale of the piece, however, the paradox is that the structure does not take up much space at all. Visitors to the gallery ducked under the winding plastic and stood inside it, admiring the piece from various angles or casually socializing. According to Jeffers, this paradox is one of the driving ideas behind the project. “We knew we wanted something that was ambiguous,” he said, “something that had logic to it but seemed irrational.”
If ambiguity was the artists’ goal, then they certainly achieved it. The shape of the piece, paired with the grandness of its scale, made for an unconventional object that was open to interpretation. Third-year architecture major Claire He described the structure as “futuristic” and, despite its already impressive size, saw even greater potential for the piece. “It feels like a prototype for something bigger,” she said.
Though an unexpected use of the gallery space, In(Klein) does not fail to impress. Not only is it aesthetically captivating, but it also poses a challenge to the ways in which people experience their physical environment. In(Klein) is a compelling and refreshing departure from the traditional art exhibit and conventional perceptions of space.
In(Klein) will be open at The Frame through April 21.

Jim Rugg is a Pittsburgh comics powerhouse. His contributions to the vitality of the comic scene have included mini-comics, self-publishing, and creator-owned work with independent publishers. It’s no wonder the ToonSeum is honoring the contemporary cartoonist and working artist through the month of May with its exhibit, This #*?! Isn’t Very Funny.
This #*?! Isn’t Very Funny features Rugg’s well-known work on Street Angel and Afrodisiac as well as new and seldom-seen pieces. This is Rugg’s first solo exhibition and a first for the ToonSeum, as the exhibition reflects the more adult sensibilities of the comic world. Most of the pieces exhibited are recent, shorter pieces originally made for anthologies and newspapers, dating from after the completion of Afrodisiac. Much of the pieces are directly inspired by original production art of the 20th century, the often-discarded line art that was produced for the sake of reproduction.
While it’s safe to say that the idea of comics in fine art galleries has found its place in contemporary art criticism, it is still unclear how a viewer is intended to engage with comics in a gallery environment: whether one is supposed to pay respect from a distance or inspect the minutiae in search of the human touch. While both are valid approaches, they go against the cognitive escape afforded by the traditional private experience associated with comics.
As such, contemporary artists are asked to present their work either as fine art or as comics. It seems that they must determine whether the focus will be on the art or the narrative. When facing this dilemma, artists feel they must choose. In This #*?! Isn’t Very Funny, Rugg bravely provides solutions to this forced dichotomy.
Rugg approaches the puzzle of exhibiting comics in a museum by creating art specifically for the gallery environment. By drawing single large panels, the comics fit within the traditional framework of a painting, and by allowing his panels to feature characters drawn at different sizes, he can create an unparalleled sense of depth. As a viewer gets closer, smaller details make themselves apparent.
A noticeable example of this practice is Rugg’s use of word balloons of different sizes within individual panels. The word bubbles’ varying sizes invite the viewers to get closer, if they want to read the text. In this way, Rugg consciously designs his work so the audience engages with it in the gallery space and so the work can confidently straddle the seeming divide between comics and fine art.
It’s important to note that while it’s safe to label Rugg as a pop artist, his work does not exhibit the intrinsic post-modern detachedness of Andy Warhol and Roy Lichtenstein’s mid-20th century work. His work has real heart. As he describes on his website, Rugg seeks to “reconcile pop culture’s adventurous promise with the realities of the world around [him]” and he “[uses] the style and visual vocabulary of cartoons to question and lampoon consumer culture.”
Rather than communicating solely through abstract notions of color, line, and form, Rugg expresses his visions and communicates in the language of our collective, mass media-constructed childhood memories. That image language is his pop. Rugg uses comic tropes in unexpected ways: narratives advanced through fragments, covers for nonexistent stories, or sketched splash pages.
“I live in a complex world of race and gender roles, politics and religion, suburban isolation and the confusion of middle age,” reads Rugg’s artist statement on his website. “In my artwork, I bring these realities to bear on the once-safe world of escapist entertainment and attempt to understand the values of the world around me through India ink, steel pen nibs, sable-hair brushes, and pixels.”

So, you like dubstep. Good for you. But have you heard of dub?
Before dubstep, there was a lot of good electronic music. In fact, there was even electronic before computers. You’re probably aware of reggae and Bob Marley’s music. But if you’re only aware of Bob Marley’s now-iconic music, you’re missing out on some of the most innovative electronic music.
Dub grew out of reggae in the late ’60s and was pioneered by artists like King Tubby, Lee “Scratch” Perry, and Scientist. Reggae, which focuses on offbeat rhythms, staccato chords, and call-and-response vocals, is often criticized for sounding uniform in sound design; however, dub sought to resolve this problem. By removing vocals and emphasizing the drum and bass parts of the track, dub music focuses on the talents of producers and their ability to manipulate the now-archaic gear they owned. Before the invention and proliferation of the computer, electronic backbeats were incredibly difficult to generate, let alone fine-tune.
Through their extensive knowledge of their equipment (and ability to modify it), dub producers were able to add extensive amounts of echo, reverb, and delay. Creating dub versions of reggae tracks served as an opportunity for producers to differentiate themselves and showcase their labels’ equipment. Similar to the way The Velvet Underground influenced almost every rock band that followed it, these dub producers heavily influenced the originators of techno, jungle, drum and bass, house, punk, trip hop, ambient, hip hop, and dubstep.
To begin to appreciate and love this incredibly powerful type of music, I recommend getting a copy of Scientist’s Heavyweight Dub Champion, waiting for a sunny day, and letting the good vibes flow.

Dear Patrick,
What’s the most cost-effective way to stay drunk for all of Spring Carnival? I have no work, no class, no money, and no friends. Help me get drunk as cheaply as possible.
Sincerely,
Consuming Highly Economical Alcohols Potentially, Otherwise Will Imbibe Natty Only
Dear CHEAP-O WINO,
There are a few general rules of thumb when it comes to drinking cheaply. First, avoid beer. It will fill you up quickly and won’t get you that drunk. Second, stay out of bars. They have a huge markup. If you want to go, pre-game. Third, if you go to a party, avoid jungle juice.
So, after careful analysis, the most cost effective way to get drunk is... Franzia. Specifically, a box of Franzia red wine. At 13.6 percent alcohol by volume and coming in a five-liter box for less than $10, it’s the best deal there is. It also comes with several drinking games ready to go: Tour de Franzia, in which you wear a bike helmet and drink Franzia, and Slap the Bag, in which you take the bag of wine out of the box, slap it, drink it, and then pass it around (these are both more fun when you’re drunk). Follow these tips and you’ll have a cheap, drunk time.
Plus getting drunk on wine is pretty classy,
Patrick Hoskins
Dear Patrick,
It’s Spring Carnival again, and that means one thing: booth sex. Do you have any tips for doing the deed in a shoddy wooden shack?
Thanks,
Busily Organizing Orgasmic Times, Hidden Booth Activities Needed, Guidance Eagerly Requested
Dear BOOTH BANGER,
Booth sex is one of the oldest Spring Carnival traditions. However, it comes with its own dangers: public indecency arrests, collapsing booths, general em-bare-ass-ment, and splinters. The key is to get in, do the deed quickly, and get out. Luckily, one of those shouldn’t be a problem. First, you need to scope out a good booth. Take the first day of Carnival to find a good one. It needs to be sturdy and have a few good hiding spots. Stay away from Kappa Alpha Theta’s booth — it’s always on the verge of collapse.
Once you’ve found a good booth, you need to sneak in at night. You may think that security will be a problem, but most of Carnival security is students, and students are easily bribed. Make sure there are no cops around and do it.
Not too hard or the whole booth will come down,
Patrick Hoskins

Amaris Whitaker, a master’s student in public policy and management at Heinz College, and her attorneys from the Mizner Law firm filed a complaint against the Static nightclub on Feb. 23, alleging the club discriminated against Whitaker due to a disability. 
Specifically, Whitaker asserts that the club failed to make reasonable accommodations and then barred her from entering because she needed a chair near the dance floor. Such discrimination has historically been prohibited under the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA).
Whitaker has difficulty standing and walking due to a congenital joint difference known as arthrogryposis. “At birth, my joints were quite disfigured,” she said. “I was able to have surgeries and have things restructured so I could at least walk and dress myself.” 
Despite her disability, Whitaker enjoys dancing and going out with her friends.
Under the ADA, businesses must make reasonable accommodations to ensure that people with disabilities receive equal levels of service as someone without a disability might receive. 
“What’s ‘reasonable’ can vary depending on the situation,” said master’s in public policy and management student Jake Oresick, who is an intern at Mizner Law and a friend of Whitaker. “If it’s too much of a burden to provide accommodations, then it might not be ‘reasonable.’ ”
Oresick gave as an example that while the ADA might require a bookstore to provide a wheelchair ramp, it does not require that the bookstore stock all of its books in braille for people who are blind.
However, Whitaker and Oresick assert that Static faced no such burden in providing a chair. “There was plenty of available of seating on that night [when I asked for a chair]. They were VIP seats, but they were empty,” Whitaker said. “The issue isn’t providing a seat on the dance floor. I just need a seat nearby that I can access.”
“I visited the club to see what it was like,” Oresick said. “There are chairs around, and it shouldn’t cost anything or inconvenience the business terribly to take one chair and move it a little closer to the dance floor.”
Although Whitaker, Oresick, and Mizner Law are alleging violations of civil rights, Static claims that Whitaker was refused admission due to behavioral infractions. “We feel for Ms. Whitaker’s situation with her disability, however that does not give her permission to break rules inside the facility; she is equal to everyone else and must abide by the venue’s policies,” said Static spokesperson Bruno Maroni in an email. “Our company does not discriminate anybody for any reason. Furthermore, our company has hosted numerous charitable events from Light of Life mission to the Wheelchair vets naming a few.”
While the ADA has been interpreted to prohibit refusal of service due to disability, it does not protect those who are denied service due to disorderedly conduct.
Although the club did not elaborate on the specifics of the behavior infractions, Whitaker said that she thinks Maroni is referring to a conversation she had with a manager about a chair. She does not feel that exchange was confrontational. “I believe the conversation was cordial. I did not swear. I was firm, but I did not yell. I was just assertive in the fact that I needed a place to sit,” Whitaker said. 
Oresick believes that the club will have trouble substantiating its claim in court. “The fact that they won’t elaborate on her conduct is curious enough in itself,” Oresick said.
Whitaker is currently seeking injunctive relief, and Static has two weeks left to respond to the complaint.

Expelled junior civil and environmental engineering major Stephane Batton is suing Carnegie Mellon for violating his civil rights.
Following Batton’s Feb. 4 off-campus fight with another student, the university held a disciplinary committee hearing. Batton claims the hearing violated his civil rights. He is suing to reverse the expulsion.
According to the lawsuit, Batton claims the university violated his rights by forcing him to testify while criminal charges against him were pending, censoring the questions he could ask witnesses, and refusing to provide a transcript of the hearing when he appealed his expulsion.
The suit names the university, Jared Cohon, Michael Murphy, Gina Casalegno, and the University Committee on Discipline as defendants. Cathy Bissoon, U.S. district court judge, will preside over the case; no trial date has been released at this time.
Junior civil and environmental engineering major Elissa Goldner, a friend of Batton, has started a petition to have him reinstated as a student. Goldner declined to comment, pending approval from Batton’s lawyer.
Teresa Thomas, assistant vice president for media relations for the university, said in an email, “Consistent with our practice, we will not comment on the substance of this pending lawsuit. We are confident that the University followed appropriate process throughout the proceedings that are the subject of the complaint, and further that the plaintiff’s rights were not violated in any way.”
Carnegie Mellon’s community standards website does not explicitly address off-campus issues or altercations, nor does it list a strict standard for when a violation of community standards results in expulsion as opposed to some other form of disciplinary action. However, assault is listed as an infraction that will result in a disciplinary hearing.
According to the website, in cases under the University Committee on Discipline, “In the disciplinary process, a student who is charged with a violation has the right to remain silent.”
The website also addresses the question of whether transcripts of a hearing must be provided for an appeal: “The person bringing an appeal may request that the recordings of the hearing be transcribed. In this case, the student will be responsible for the cost of providing a transcription of the recording of the prior proceedings. The transcription is made solely for the use of the person considering the appeal. The transcript will NOT be provided to the students involved.”
Batton had a preliminary hearing on Thursday regarding criminal charges of aggravated assault and related crimes. He was not available for comment.

Phillip H. Scanlan, the Australian consul general in New York, visited Carnegie Mellon and gave a lecture last Tuesday on the future of Australia in a changing world. 
Scanlan focused on the future of the G-20 and how Australia’s position in the world will change as its neighboring developing nations like Indonesia advance economically.
Scanlan said that Australia is shifting its strategy from that of a big economy to that of a consistent high performer. According to Scanlan, Australia has thrived economically, but will soon be surpassed by its neighbors because of their higher populations.
Scanlan believes that the solution to this problem is global engagement. He said that if Australia works with its neighbors to promote cooperation in the southwest Pacific, it could create an economic environment where each nation benefits from each other’s growth through the free flow of ideas, people, and trade.
In order to promote international cooperation, Scanlan founded the non-governmental organization Australian American Leadership Dialogue to bring together young leaders from the U.S., China, India, Australia, and other nations to network and form a spirit of partnership and collaboration. 
Scanlan has continued his efforts toward international cooperation as consul general through the New York Young Leaders program. The program gives young leaders the opportunity to discuss issues behind closed doors, free from the pressure of internal politics or other political and cultural norms that stand between their nations.
Master’s student at the Heinz School of Public Policy and Management Amy Badiani, who attended a luncheon with Scanlan on Wednesday, spoke positively of the program. “Because of [the program’s] nature behind closed doors ... young leaders have actually created change,” Badiani said.
Scanlan said the goal of constructing networks for leaders of various nations is to solve global issues multilaterally. Scanlan pointed to climate change, intellectual property reform, immigration, and the fight against human trafficking as global problems that require mutual cooperation to find and execute solutions. According to Scanlan, while unilateral action can improve the situation for one nation, without international accord, problems simply shift across borders.
Students who attended the lecture and luncheon seemed to find Scanlan’s ideas interesting. “I think it was good that he visited CMU, because he was able to convey Australia’s role in global politics,” Badiani said.
“[The lecture] was informative,” said Carmen Easterwood, a senior economics major. “He seems like a really intelligent guy.”

Researchers create energy-efficient game consoles
While video game consoles like the Xbox 360 have long been known to consume excessive amounts of electricity, Carnegie Mellon researchers are proposing strategies for more energy-efficient entertainment.
Engineering and public policy doctoral students Eric Hittinger and Kimberley Mullins and engineering and public policy professor Inês Lima de Azevedo’s recent article “Electricity consumption and energy savings potential of video game consoles in the United States,” published in Energy Efficiency, offers a simple and virtually free solution to the problem.
Much of the electricity cost associated with the use of these video game systems originates in users’ choice not to shut down the devices after they finish using them. As a result, consoles consume approximately 1 percent of the residential electricity used in the United States — although fewer than half of the households in the population have the devices.
The solution proposed by researchers is to simply create a firmware update that most users get automatically from the manufacturers. The update could create a default setting to put the consoles to sleep after one hour, possibly reducing electricity consumption of game consoles by 75 percent. This solution is estimated to save consumers $1 billion annually in electricity bills.
Professor develops cheaper way to synthesize peptides
Carnegie Mellon chemistry professor Danith Ly has invented an easier, less expensive technique for manufacturing cyclic peptides. 
Cyclic peptides are ring-shaped chains of amino acids. Some cyclic peptides can be used to combat serious diseases, including HIV and SARS.
Carnegie Mellon chemists have specifically focused on synthesizing a cyclic peptide known as RTD-1.
“RTD-1 is part of the innate immune system of macaques and baboons, and at one time it was part of our immune system,” Ly said in a university press release. “If we can reproduce this peptide, we possibly could treat a wide range of infections to which humans were once immune.”
The synthetic peptide has now proven effective against E. coli, listeria, staphylococcus and salmonella — all of which are fought by RTD-1.
The researchers now hope to test the synthetic peptide against other pathogens, specifically ones resistant to antibiotics. Chemists also plan to reproduce and synthesize other cyclic peptides using Ly’s method.
The research for this project was funded by the National Institutes of Health, the National Science Foundation, and the DSF Charitable Foundation.

Spring Carnival 2012 is this weekend, and the list of events is overwhelming. Big names in entertainment like Nick Offerman (who plays Ron Swanson from Parks and Recreation) and Passion Pit will perform, hopefully making this year’s Carnival incredible.
There is a lot of pressure to contact prominent bands and performers and reel them in for our Carnival show. AB Concert and AB Comedy deserve a solid thank you and recognition for bringing in these performers, with an additional thanks to Student Activities and Undergraduate Student Senate for helping with the funding to pay for such entertainment.
However, there is a significant chance that not every student will be able to enjoy the Carnival entertainment this year. Tickets for the comedy and concert shows officially opened last Tuesday around noon and were sold out within a matter of hours. While this demonstrates how excited students were for the events, it seems that a lot of students could be left out of some of the fun this weekend.
While the wristbands are only needed in the case that it rains and the venue has to be moved indoors, Pittsburgh’s weather is sporadic at best. There is a 50 percent chance of rain on Saturday, when the concert is scheduled. If the performances do need to be moved inside, only 1,400 students out of about 9,000 (graduate and undergraduate) will be able to enjoy them.
AB Comedy and AB Concerts did a good job at getting these entertainers. However, considering the hype that comes with these performers and the general excitement surrounding Carnival shows, it would have been wise for the clubs to utilize a more suitable (i.e. larger) indoor venue. For example, possibly moving the venue to a place off campus and providing shuttles would be beneficial, because it would have meant that more students could enjoy the performers AB Comedy and AB Concerts worked so hard to get.

“Ignorance is strength.”
This is the unspoken creed of censors and oppressors across the globe. Limiting knowledge is the surest way of maintaining the status quo.
Fortunately, the United States is an open society; people are free to speak, free to read, free to learn. Americans can find knowledge in their public libraries on any subject they can imagine. They need not fear books being removed by intolerant or fearful censors.
That, at least, is what I believed growing up, as I spent hours exploring school and public libraries. The truth is less pleasant.
Last Monday, the American Library Association released the State of America’s Libraries Report 2012, an annual report that includes a section on intellectual freedom with a list of the most banned books of the year.
Banned books conjure memories of totalitarian Soviet Russia, the Inquisition, and McCarthyism. It is enforced ignorance with no recourse, for how can one protest when knowledge itself is hidden?
The books on the ALA list are a strange mix including literary classics and modern teen fiction. The intellectually stirring works of Lauren Myracle — the novels ttyl, ttfn, and l8r g8r — share space with To Kill a Mockingbird by Harper Lee and My Mom’s Having A Baby! A Kid’s Month-by-Month Guide to Pregnancy by Dori Hillestad Butler.
At first glance, there is little to associate Brave New World by Aldous Huxley (No. 7) with the Gossip Girl series by Cecily Von Ziegesar (No. 9). The ALA helpfully provides the reasons these books were attacked. “Nudity” or “sexually explicit” was listed for eight of the top 10 targets. Some exceptions were The Hunger Games series by Suzanne Collins, which was instead called out for being insensitive and satanic, among other reasons, while To Kill a Mockingbird was criticized for its offensive language and racism. Those seeking to ban these books point out the damaging effect sexually explicit content has on children. And their argument is compelling; I’m sure that the teenagers reading Brave New World are precisely the ones most likely to start having orgy-porgies.
Today’s libraries provide electronic resources that are just as important as their paper counterparts. The forces of censorship have followed this digital transition, and libraries face demands to restrict the sites their users can visit on the internet. School and public libraries have legitimate reasons for blocking pornography and sites known for malware, but restricting access because of political or religious views steps far over the line. The ALA points out one instance when a library patron tried to research Wicca, Native American religions, and astrology but was blocked by the library’s filtering software. Schools across the country block Wikipedia in part or entirely.
Intellectual freedom is being threatened by attempts to ban books and block websites.
In any democratic society, knowledge must be both a right and a choice.
People can choose ignorance if they wish, but they cannot force it on others. Public libraries are repositories of this knowledge, and attempts to censor them are simply inexcusable.

Ozzie Guillen, manager for the Miami Marlins, was recently been criticized for his comments in Time magazine on Cuban dictator Fidel Castro. Guillen was quoted in an interview, “I respect Fidel Castro ... You know why? Many people have tried to kill Castro in the last 60 years, yet that [expletive] is still there.” 
His statement sparked outrage among Cuban-Americans in Miami and resulted in a five-game suspension without pay. Although Guillen deserves the reprimands from enraged citizens, he does not deserve to be suspended for his comment.
While his viewpoint was inconsiderate of the Cuban-Americans in Miami who have lost family and property to Castro’s rule, he had no intention to make a political statement or endorse Castro’s atrocities.
Instead, the statement was at most an attempt at humor gone wrong. In the article “Is Castro Cuban-Americans’ Hitler?” in the Huffington Post, Charles Garcia, CEO of Hispanic merchant bank Garcia Trujillo, said Guillen is “legendary for putting his foot in his mouth.” He has a reputation for saying absurd things, which is simply what happened during his interview with Time magazine.
Guillen was quick to apologize and make clear that he admired Castro’s ability to evade death, not his inhumane actions. Guillen’s apology and insistence on returning to Miami to answer questions show that he did not mean harm to those affected by Castro’s reign.
The embarrassment he has faced, even after his apology, is a proper way to stress the need for sensitivity when discussing controversial subjects, but such embarrassment is punishment enough.
There is also Guillen’s freedom of speech to be protected. Everyone in the United States has the right to voice his or her opinions.
There are many examples of controversy surrounding comments of other professionals in the sports world, such as Pittsburgh Steeler Rashard Mendenhall’s tweets last year that decried the celebrations surrounding the death of terrorist Osama Bin Laden. However, the controversy did not result in any direct punishment from the Steelers’ management.
Guillen should not be professionally disciplined for voicing his opinion when other athletes have gone unpunished for equally controversial comments.
Ultimately, the controversy over Guillen’s interview should have resulted in a lesson for him and the American people, rather than a suspension. The reaction to Guillen is a reminder that one must be careful and considerate when speaking about issues that have not yet healed, including cultural and ethical wounds. 
It should not, however, be a lesson to teach Americans that unpopular opinions will be suppressed, just as Castro suppressed speech for the refugees who are now living in Miami.

College seniors at the University of Pittsburgh, the Community College of Allegheny County, Point Park University, and Carnegie Mellon received an email last Tuesday from Pittsburgh Mayor Luke Ravenstahl. In the email, Ravenstahl encouraged them to stay in Pittsburgh after graduation, highlighting that Pittsburgh has so much to offer young people, from available jobs to high quality of life and affordability.
If Ravenstahl and other city officials want to reinvigorate Pittsburgh by bringing in and keeping younger people, the benefits of living in the city need to be made clear to college students and other young adults.
Pittsburgh has received numerous accolades, such as being called the “most livable city” in the U.S. last year by the Economist Intelligence Unit, and being given the same title from Forbes.com in 2010.
However, what matters to college graduates now, during a recession, is job availability. For Carnegie Mellon students in particular, Pittsburgh lacks the reputation that other cities and regions have.
The 2011 Post Graduation Survey for the School of Computer Science shows 39 percent of computer science graduates going to California after graduation.
The post-graduation surveys of other Carnegie Mellon majors also show a significant amount of students leaving the mid-Atlantic region.
At the moment, Pittsburgh doesn’t carry the weight that Silicon Valley and Seattle have for the technology fields, nor does it boast the artistic reputations of New York City or Los Angeles.
But it deserves such recognition. Pittsburgh is becoming a hub for technology, medicine, and commerce. High-profile companies like Apple, Intel, and Microsoft that entice Carnegie Mellon graduates to go out west are interested in the Pittsburgh region, with Google being a notable example with its East Liberty location. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, between March 2010 and March 2011, 5,300 jobs were created in Pittsburgh’s education and health services supersector alone.
What it comes down to is a need for Ravenstahl, Governor Tom Corbett, and other officials in the region to stress how the city is growing — not in numbers or awards, but by making college graduates aware of the opportunities for their careers are in Pittsburgh.
The city may be in the baby stages of significant growth and development, but such growth has to be facilitated by continuing to convince young people and families to reside in Pittsburgh.

Is every e-book, or even every e-bestseller, worth $9.99?
They aren’t. Have you seen what makes the bestseller’s shelf? Half of them aren’t actually written by their “authors” and far too many seem to have editors who have perennially stepped out for a lunch break. 
Quality of content aside, what exactly is it I should be paying for: the author’s blood, sweat, and ink? Should I pay three times as much for Haruki Murakami’s 1Q84 — three “books” published as a single volume, topping 900 pages — or should Julian Barnes’ Man Booker Prize-winner Sense of an Ending be discounted due to its brevity? 
Is it just a novel that is worth $9.99, or is a novella worth the same? If I serialize my story, do I make more or less? Are graphic novels the same, and what about non-fiction?
Should anyone even be publishing short stories anymore? As a society, should we just stop reading — especially on paper?
The book publishing industry is just one more 19th-century innovation disrupted by the rise of digital information transfer and ubiquitous computing devices. This transition, or more aptly revolution, shifted control of book pricing from physical and local bookstores to Amazon — not to a sea of competitive e-book sellers, but to a monolithic entity whose storage and distribution costs are negligent and who has much greater restrictions over post-sale transfers.
Through Amazon, e-books have been commoditized: $9.99 for every book. You purchase it and it cannot be transferred. You don’t own a physical object, you can’t hold it in your hand, you can’t lend it to a friend who is browsing your bookshelves, and you can’t donate it to the local library when you are done.
E-books, and the entire book ecosystem as a whole, is irreparably damaged by Amazon’s actions. The local bookstore and even the national chains are dying or dead. The quality of the book as an object and of the content itself as having worth is lost with the rise of e-books. 
Most unfortunately, the act of reading hasn’t improved. You can carry thousands of books with you at a time, but reading and the associated actions of thinking or learning haven’t been beneficially transformed in these early stages of our digitalization.
And this is why the Department of Justice’s lawsuit charging Apple and five book publishers with colluding to raise the price of e-books stings to the erudite loyalists among us. 
Bibliophiles who care for the book and the material inside it are not being helped by forcing book publishers to spend their already-limited resources fighting lawsuits that will save consumers an insignificant two dollars a book. 
If the publishers don’t all settle (and it seems Macmillan and Penguin will rightfully not), the technology will have radically evolved to be so distant from the current landscape that the suits will be irrelevant long before they are resolved.
I offer this solution to the publishers: Tell Amazon if it requires — and if the Department of Justice regulates — the ability to set its own prices, then you simply cannot do business with them. 
Set up your own digital storefronts. Sell e-books in the formats of your choice for as much as you’d like and as much as the market will pay. 
If you truly stand behind your agency model, fight for it by making it the standard. It provides clearer revenue models for digital sales and allows you the freedom you want.
It isn’t collusion if you each handle it in the way that makes sense for your publishing house, your customers, and your books — keep the books the first priority. 
And while you are building these digital storefronts, remind us, the readers, and society as a whole why you are still relevant at all in a world of simple and direct self-publishing. 
Prove you can innovate: Bring in the digital humanists, the internet publishers, the minds behind extending ePub and push out digital books that disrupt the act of reading. Give your e-books more than just reflowed text: Give them life.

It’s safe to say that people here at Carnegie Mellon adore their technology. However, a teenager in China who sold an organ for an iPhone and an iPad may have surpassed any Apple fanatic here.
On April 6, reports of the story broke from Chenzhou, a city in China’s Hunan province. A teenager with the surname Wang wanted an iPhone and an iPad. The black market wanted a kidney. Five people helped 17-year-old Wang surgically remove his kidney.
This black market deal was a clean-cut procedure. It wasn’t as though a handful of felons carved out his kidney with a pocketknife; there was a professional on board.This group included a practicing doctor in addition to criminals, such as transplant organizer He Wei, who turned to crime after accumulating gambling debts. The group is currently being charged with “intentional injury.”
The procedure collected 220,000 yuan, approximately $35,000. Wei distributed the money amongst the accomplices and medical officials who helped with the procedure. Wang received 22,000 yuan, approximately $3,500, in exchange for his kidney.
Exchanging an organ for cash is simply stupid, especially when the reason is to buy an iPhone and an iPad. Under special, extreme circumstances, selling an organ could be justified. But selling a kidney to satisfy the need to keep up with the latest technology trend is not a necessity, and it’s definitely not worth the medical risk.
Besides, what happens when the iPhone 5 comes out? There are only so many organs to go around for Apple products.
As shocking as it seems that someone would just sell his kidney in order to keep up with new technology, the most mind-blowing part of this story is the fact that Wang only received 10 percent of the profits from selling his kidney.
He was completely ripped off. Obviously he can’t cut labor costs, but in the grand scheme of things, to receive such a small amount for such a huge procedure is not quite fair. Sure $3,500 is enough to pay for the iPhone and the iPad, and still have plenty of cash left over for fun Apple accessories, but is that really enough to suffice for the loss of a perfectly healthy kidney?
The moral of the story is that if you’re going to sell your kidney, be smart and demand more for it — just kidding. 
The real moral of the story is that desperation for the latest and greatest technology is unhealthy. 
Wang’s desire for Apple products is an example of extreme consumerism, and it represents the extent to which people try to keep up with the latest fad. 
Wang physically harmed himself to keep up with technology trends, and in the process, he lost a kidney, a deal, and his dignity.

With Rick Santorum out of the race for the Republican Presidential nomination, the campaign for the White House can really begin. For the Republicans’ sake, this is good. The longer they took to decide on an approach, the less it seemed they had a chance. Now the Republicans can rally around Mitt Romney to give Obama a run for his money.
It is possible of course that the Republicans could find two exceptional candidates in an election cycle whose battle for the ticket could cause the party to hone its positions and take pride in its candidates. However, in this case it seems more like they were faced with two mediocre candidates, the lesser of which was difficult to decide.
Santorum ended his campaign after a weekend with his family, noting that he was not leaving politics but leaving this particular race. We may see him again in 2016, as we see Romney now four years after his unsuccessful 2008 campaign.
But now, perhaps by touting a weak economy and somewhat unpopular health care bill, Romney might provide a formidable challenge for Obama. By having the best candidates from both major parties focus on what they can do in the Oval Office, instead of focusing in simply getting the party nomination, the future President of the United States can achieve more progress.
With habitual Republican voters, moderate Republicans, the moral right, and Tea Party members, the Republican party has a difficult task to present a coherent strategy. Presenting one would help guide the party to a state where, whoever wins, both parties can unite together after the election to do what is right for the country.
That is something that everyone should be able to agree on, Santorum and all.

Make sure to save money to buy new clothes. Booth paint and sawdust may make a great impression on the people around campus, but you’re not going to be on the cover of Vogue anytime soon.
Inhale slowly through your nose. Exhale slowly through your mouth. Now slowly repeat: I will not cause bodily harm to my Booth Chair. I will not cause bodily harm to my Booth Chair. I will try really hard to not hurt that psycho.
Two words: Funnel cake. Eat up, have fun, and please don’t make yourself sick.
They may just be a purple wristband and a silly hard hat, but treat them with some kindness and respect. Those two items are saving your life.
Everyone knows that you’re too cool for school traditions. It’s hipster but also sensible of you. Just don’t rain on everyone else’s good time. Pittsburgh’s weather has already signed up for that job.
Take advantage of Hunt Library, the Gates Center, and Wean Hall being so nice and peaceful this week. However, you still won’t get anything done and you will probably be lonely while everyone else is out having fun.
Be proud of what you have created this week. You put your time and effort into something and did your best. It might just be building a booth or participating in Buggy, but be proud of yourself.
Today is Monday. Fact: Tomorrow is Tuesday, the day after is Wednesday. Fact: Spring Carnival comes after Wednesday. Super fact: You’re not getting any schoolwork done this week.
Free food is everywhere this week, so make sure to plan accordingly. Make a map with the fastest routes to the best foods to maximize the food rush.
Carnival means alumni, and alumni means time to brown nose any person who looks like he or she has some pull in the corporate world. Stay alert and you just might get to eat real food after college.
Your buggy team will be racing. Sorry the stars don’t have more to say about who will win. Even they know that taking sides can be quite dangerous.
Be nice and laugh at the MC’s jokes at the Mobots event.
