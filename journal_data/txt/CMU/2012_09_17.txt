Six games into the season and the Carnegie Mellon women’s soccer team remains undefeated, with a record of 4–0–2. On Tuesday, the Tartans were victorious over Washington & Jefferson College with a score of 4–1. This past Saturday, the Tartans hosted the Kenyon College Ladies, whom they defeated 3–0.
In the game against Washington & Jefferson, the Tartans’ position and pressure forced their first goal off an opposing defender and pushed the score to 1–0. Shortly thereafter, junior defender Brittany Couture scored another goal for the Tartans.
It wasn’t until the second half of the game that the Tartans scored again. This time, senior midfielder Katie Davis pushed the ball into the net, bringing the Tartans to 3–0. With 12 minutes left in the game, sophomore forward Courtney Brant scored, bringing the team to a final score of 4–1.
In the Tartans’ shutout against the Kenyon Ladies, junior goalkeeper Anna Albi made five saves to keep the Ladies from scoring throughout the game. However, the Tartans were unable to score during the entire first half.
But just five minutes into the second half, junior forward Alex Venegas scored on senior midfielder Stephanie Hare’s pinpointed pass just inside the 18-yard box. 
Sophomore midfielder Lucy Havens then scored her second goal of the season on a header after Couture sent in a cross from the right sideline, which brought the Tartans’ lead to 2–0. 
Bringing it home for the Tartans with three minutes left in the game, sophomore forward Savina Reid scored the third and final goal of the game, heading in sophomore forward Courtney Brant’s corner kick.
“It’s been a real team effort, and we’ve really pulled together since last year. I am really excited with how well we are playing and to get into UAAs,” said senior forward Brianna Magill.
The Tartans will travel on Wednesday to Meadville, Pa., to face Allegheny College at 4:30 p.m. Last season, the Tartans defeated the Gators 2–1 in a tightly contested match with the game-winning goal coming in the 94th minute by junior defender Rachel Contopoulos. The Tartans look to continue this season’s success.

The no. 7 ranked Carnegie Mellon men’s soccer team played the Allegheny College Gators on Saturday, winning with a score of 2–0.
This win moved the team’s overall record to 5–1 for the season.
The Tartans began applying pressure early, and in the ninth minute, the team’s aggressiveness paid off.
Carnegie Mellon attacked the Gators’ defense with a series of passes until junior Scott Gerfen centered the ball across the box to senior John Crawshaw, who then took aim at the net. The one- timer was blocked by the Allegheny keeper, but the ensuing deflection went right back to Crawshaw. He took advantage of this second opportunity and put the ball in the back of the net.
Despite the Tartans’ aggressive play and continuing pressure, the score remained 1–0 at the half.
Coming out of halftime, the Tartans did not let up and continually occupied the Gator’s half of the field, resulting in five corner kicks in the second half.
The first of these corners, taken by senior Ben Bryant, led to a shot by Crawshaw off junior Chris Wysocki’s header that was ultimately blocked by the Gators’ defense.
The Tartans’ constant aggression finally paid off when junior Matt Sarett found the back of the net in the 83rd minute to give Carnegie Mellon some breathing room. Sarett served the ball up to junior Max Tassano, who went up for a header. Tassano missed with his head, but the pass went through the Gators goalkeeper’s hands.
The Tartans earned their third shutout of the season with junior Christopher Madden recording the win in goal.  
“It was another great win for our team. After a tough loss last year to Allegheny, which ended 3–2, we felt there was a sense of redemption this season. They only amounted two shots on goal, which shows how great our defense played,” Bryant said.
Carnegie Mellon plays on Tuesday at home against Washington & Jefferson College at 7 p.m.
“We’ll beat Washington & Jefferson by being aggressive and dominant on defense and in the midfield while staying creative and persistent in the offensive third,” said senior forward Alex Abedian.

The Tartans hosted the St. Vincent College Wildcats in their first volleyball home match last Tuesday. The score was close throughout the first game, but the Tartans pulled away with a 28–26 win. Carnegie Mellon cruised through the second and third games with scores of 25–14 and 25–18, respectively. After its victory over the Wildcats, the volleyball team improved its overall record to 4–6.
Sophomore right side hitter Ali Celentano had 14 kills, while sophomore libero Ali Nichols picked up 28 digs. Junior setter Emily Wright led the team in assists with a total of 33.
“It was our first home game, we were all really excited for it,” Wright said. “The first game was a little rough; we were a little nervous. But in the next game we just got down to business and cut down on our errors, which made the game go by a lot faster.”
The Tartans also hosted the Carnegie Mellon Invitational last Friday and Saturday, pushing the team’s overall record to 7–7.
Carnegie Mellon played its first match of the Invitational against the University of Scranton, where the Tartans picked up a 3–0 (25–21, 25–18, 27–25) overall win. Junior outside hitter Senna Parsa had nine kills, seven digs, and two blocks. The second match was played against Johns Hopkins University, where Carnegie Mellon lost 3–0 (25–22, 25–18, 25–22).
“I think we’ve increased our ball control a lot, so I think that’s a really big strength,” said head coach Kim Kelly. “We also have some really nice outside and right side hitters. I think we have a good all-around floor right now, which is nice.”
On the second day of the Invitational, the Tartans played their first match against the University of Pittsburgh at Greensburg. 
Carnegie Mellon gained a 3–0 (25–12, 25–22, 25–7) victory. According to Kelly, Celentano had the game of her career against Pitt-Greensburg, where she hit .875 with 14 kills. 
Celentano believes much of her success comes from the support she receives from her teammates.
“Team chemistry is really important,” Celentano said. “Especially with volleyball — it’s a huge mental game, so you need your teammates to help pick you up. We’re all really close.”
The Tartans ended the Invitational with another 3–0 (25–12, 25–22, 25–17) overall win against Elmira College.
This weekend the volleyball team will travel to Huntingdon, Pa., to play in the Juniata Invitational.
“I look forward to seeing them grow as a team and become more cohesive,” Kelly said. “From weekend one to now, I can see the gelling of everything; it’s actually coming together.”

As a senior midfielder on the women’s soccer team, Stephanie Hare is proud to be a Tartan. “Being able to wear the Carnegie Mellon name on my jersey and around the country is extremely rewarding. Only a few people can say that they represent such a great school as an athlete,” she said.
Hare came to Carnegie Mellon after her first-year, transferring from Miami University of Ohio, where she played Division I soccer. “Transferring was a lot easier than I expected. It was a risky decision to switch schools, but I could not be happier that I made the move. Things seemed to fall into place soon after I got to school with help from [head coach] Yon and the team,” Hare said.
Changing from Division I to Division III is a big change for a student athlete. “For me personally, I like D-III a lot better. It fits what I am trying to get out of my college athletic career. The big difference for me is having a good balance between academics and athletics here at CMU,” she said.
Since transferring, she’s found the team to be an integral part of her life. “I have made my best friends on the soccer team and they have become family. I love spending all my time with them and also working together on the field for each other. I also enjoy the challenge of the UAA and the road to accomplishing the goals that we have set for each other this year,” Hare said.
The women’s soccer team has set many goals this year, and Hare has a few of her own challenges she wants to overcome.
“Being a senior, I want to have the best season of my life. My goal is to help lead the team to the post-season. I want to walk off the field at the end of my last game with no regrets and knowing I gave everything I could to my teammates and the program. I believe in this team and what we can accomplish this year,” she said.
Hare believes the women’s soccer team’s camaraderie is second to none, and will be essential to having a good season. “I’m extremely proud of how we have come together as a team this year. The chemistry is much better than past seasons and is really exciting to be a part of,” she explained. “This bond is what will make our team do great things this year. We are playing for each other... and with that attitude we can beat anyone.”
Part of the team’s togetherness comes from the bonding during preseason. “Every year during preseason, we find ourselves thinking of things that we would rather do than run a fitness test. We get very creative with our ideas and it makes the long days of preseason a little better,” Hare said.
Hare is finishing her bachelor’s degree in biological sciences, and plans to graduate in May. “I am keeping my options open currently. Medical school is still an option for me, but I am looking to get some experience under my belt in the workforce before I settle down in a graduate program. Also, I love to travel so hopefully there will be some cool trips in my future,” Hare said.
Despite her hopes to travel in the future, she has already begun to fulfill that desire. “This summer I got the opportunity to travel to South Africa for a marine biology internship. I learned so much and got to experience the beauty of South Africa first hand,” Hare said.

In high school fashion, the Tartans football team took the field on Friday night in front of a rowdy crowd, unified in the theme of “whiting out” at Gesling Stadium. The Tartans took on the Catholic University Cardinals.
Senior running back Jared Delello set the tone early with a 42-yard run, allowing for his one-yard touchdown on a draw up the middle two plays later. That gave the Tartans an early 7–0 lead. Delello led the rushing game, putting up 74 yards on 12 rushes for two touchdowns.
After a Cardinals field goal, the Tartans managed to score another quick touchdown on their next possession. Junior quarterback Rob Kalkstein launched a 65-yard pass to sophomore wide out Timothy Swanson for a touchdown. The pass by Kalkstein was his third touchdown pass for 50 or more yards in consecutive games.
Kalkstein found the end zone again, connecting with the team’s leading receiver, junior Tim Kikta, for a 28-yard touchdown completion, the third straight game the two connected for a touchdown pass. The score then sat at 21–10.
The Tartan offense was potent, racking up 453 yards of total offense to best the Cardinals’ 396 yards. 
Carnegie Mellon head coach Richard Lackner got clever with the play strategies at the end of the second quarter, calling for a double pass. Kalkstein hit junior wide receiver Colin Lang for the fake screen, as Lang then hit senior running back Jake Nardone for the 43-yard completion. The fancy play set up Kalkstein’s third touchdown, as he connected with senior running back Patrick Blanks on the crossing route to bring the score to 28–10.
Delello scored his second touchdown in the second half, and the Cardinals converted on a late touchdown to bring the game to its final score, 35–17. 
Despite the high scoring potency of the Tartan offense, ball security was an issue. The Tartans fumbled the ball three times, turning it over twice. 
However, the Tartans executed their game plan effectively and were able to find the end zone many times to put the game out of reach early.
“Our focus for every game is the same each week. We know that if we play as a team and commit to improving every game, we will be a great team,” Nardone said. “Catholic [University] beat us last year so we definitely had that loss on our mind. It really came down to playing for each other.”

Having spent the last decade designing a virtual system that incorporates music with visuals to help stroke victims regain limb functionality, Thanassis Rikakis isn’t a surprising choice for Carnegie Mellon’s new vice provost for design, arts, and technology.
Over the past 10 years, Rikakis has served as professor and director of the School of Arts, Media, and Engineering at Arizona State University. With graduate degrees in music composition and psychoacoustics, he has led numerous projects that bridge the arts with technology in attempts to improve the quality of life.
Heading into his new position, Rikakis will place a lot of focus on the future of what he calls “cultural systems” — the interaction between several different aspects of a culture, such as technology and art, to create a unique experience.
“We’re talking about the orchestral experience of the future, the drama experience of the future, the literature experience of the future,” Rikakis explained. “What we want to do at CMU is recognize that this is happening and begin to put both our educational structures in place so five years from now we are at the forefront of creating these new cultural systems.”
“He brings a wealth of experience and vision to further that mission at our university,” Carnegie Mellon Provost and Executive Vice President Mark Kamlet said in a university press release last Monday announcing Rikakis’ appointment.
One such cultural system for which Rikakis led the development was an adaptive, mixed-reality rehabilitation system, which aims to teach the mechanics of simple limb motions to stroke survivors. It combines physical movements, as performed by a stroke survivor, with digital feedback in the form of sounds and visuals.
The virtual component — having a stroke victim move his or her limbs and generate movements on a screen — seemed to be only half of the recipe for successful rehabilitation, Rikakis said.
“The virtual world is missing a lot of the physical interactions that our bodies optimize for,” he said. “Our perception is critical.”
As an example, consider the motion involved in reaching for a cup of water placed on a table. This motion, Rikakis explained, consists of the arm speeding up, followed by holding that speed, followed by slowing down just before reaching the cup to not knock it over. To give the stroke victims an additional perspective on this motion, notes on a marimba are played speeding up, holding steady, and then slowing down.
The victims are then asked to re-create this sound by moving their arms. Sensors placed all over the arms capture the movement and create sounds in real time based on how quickly or slowly the arms move.
Clinical trials were conducted on this system, and the results were just recently accepted by the journal Neurorehabilitation and Neural Repair. Rikakis said the study found that “mixed-reality rehabilitation is an efficient tool for improving movement quality in a sustainable manner.”
One may think of the situation in this way: Traditional physical therapy may result in the stroke victim successfully grabbing the cup of water, but adding in mixed-reality rehabilitation may increase the chances of victims not spilling it in the process. 
The collaboration involved in the mixed-reality rehabilitation project is one example of the interdisciplinary work Rikakis hopes to encourage at Carnegie Mellon. The project involved researchers from the fields of rehabilitation medicine, rehabilitation science, psychology, sociology, visual art, music, computer science, electrical engineering, and bioengineering.
In addition to the new position of vice provost for design, arts, and technology, Rikakis will hold professorships in the School of Design and the School of Music, as well as a courtesy appointment in the department of biomedical engineering.

There’s a lot going on in the field of public health and vaccinology. According to NPR, researchers have been working on a vaccine to fight Dengue Fever, and Scientific American recently reported on the progress of a preventive medication for HIV. While these might seem more exciting than your annual flu shot, the process of how such vaccines work is complicated and fascinating. 
The word for vaccine comes from the root word vacca — Latin for “cow.” According to the BBC, vaccines were first “discovered” in the 18th century when English physician Edward Jenner observed that milkmaids who got cowpox were immune to smallpox.
Taking advantage of the lack of patient consent laws, Jenner infected a healthy boy with cowpox and then purposely inoculated him with smallpox to test his hypothesis. Fortunately, the boy remained healthy, and vaccines gained some theoretical foundations.
Evolving from gambling with patients to annual flu shots, however, required more information about the human body. According to Discovery Health, vaccines rely on the basics of the human immune system. When foreign substances such as viruses and bacteria, called antigens, enter the body, the immune system responds by producing proteins.
These proteins, known as antibodies, destroy the antigens. Antibodies are produced by white blood cells, called lymphocytes or B-cells. Once the body produces B-cells against a particular antigen, it stores the information for future infections.
Here is where vaccines come in. When someone receives a flu shot or uses a nasal spray, the virus is being physically inserted. The two categories of viruses are “live” and “inactivated.” In live vaccines, scientists create a much weaker version of the antigen before releasing it to the public. These live vaccines can make a few patients mildly ill.
Inactivated vaccines are usually made by killing bacteria in a chemical and then adding pieces of the dead antigen to the vaccine. Allergic reactions to vaccines are very rare, and because the antigen is inactive, there’s no risk of becoming ill.
A vaccine is made up of more than just an antigen, however. Many are packaged with chemicals to help stabilize them during distribution. Additionally, those used for multiple doses come equipped with a disinfectant to kill any foreign material that may be inside the needle.
When creating a vaccine, scientists spend a lot of time studying the antigen and how it causes disease in the human body. The vaccines are cultured in live chicken eggs for a few days to incubate. This is why those with egg allergies, for example, cannot receive the flu vaccine.
The testing stage for a proposed vaccine is long and complicated; it has to undergo years of study to make sure it’s effective, and then it must be tested on healthy adults and target demographics. The trials are closely monitored by governmental organizations, such as the Food and Drug Administration or the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). 
As for the flu shot, scientists are never completely sure the vaccine will protect against a particular strain. The influenza virus mutates hundreds of times per year, so choosing the right strain to fight against is difficult. Fortunately, scientists are often close enough to make an effective vaccine.
As flu shots are already being advertised outside Rite-Aid and Giant Eagle, it may be time to start thinking about getting one. For the upcoming flu season, the CDC says it is especially important for people who hold a high risk of developing pneumonia from the flu, such as those who are over 65, pregnant, or have respiratory conditions.
The CDC notes, however, that everyone over the age of four months should try to get a flu vaccine.

Computer learns objects in poorly drawn sketches
Researchers from Brown University and the University of Berlin in Germany have developed a computer program capable of identifying rough sketches drawn by humans in real time.
While computers are already good at recognizing sketches that are accurate representations of their real-world counterparts, rougher and less accurate sketches are more difficult. For example, a non-artist’s sketch of a rabbit may feature big buck teeth, big ears, and a cotton tail — a caricature with little semblance to an actual rabbit. While humans may still be able to recognize this depiction, computers are unable to do so without adequate training data. 
To overcome this limitation, the researchers first trained their program with over 20,000 human-drawn sketches. Then the team developed a method for users to create drawings while the program attempted to identify them in real time. The program averaged a 56 percent accuracy rating, while humans managed a 73 percent accuracy rating guessing images from the same data set.

New species of monkey discovered in the Congo
A new species of monkey has been discovered in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC). The monkey has a grizzly, blond mane and a cream-colored nose stripe that help distinguish it from its other primate cousins in the area. The species first came to light when scientists found one of the animals being kept as a pet.
Biologists named the new monkeys Cercopithecus lomamiensis, after the nearby Lomami river in the monkeys’ habitat. They also suggested that other unidentified species may currently be living in this area.
“This discovery may be only the first from this remarkable but poorly known forest, located in the central DRC,” said anthropologist Andrew Burrell from New York University, who was involved in the study.

Proof submitted for decades-old math conjecture
Shinichi Mochizuki of Japan’s Kyoto University has released a 500-page proof of the abc conjecture, a significant problem in number theory whose solution has eluded mathematicians for decades. Essentially, the conjecture states that, for positive integers a, b, and c that share no common factors and satisfy a + b = c, then d, the product of the prime-number factors of abc, is rarely much smaller than c. If Mochizuki’s proof of the conjecture were verified, it would be the gateway to solving many open number theory problems and significantly impact other aspects of mathematics.
“If Mochizuki’s proof is correct, it will be one of the most astounding achievements of mathematics of the 21st century,” said Dorian Goldfeld, a mathematician at Columbia University.
However, the verification process may take some time. Mochizuki’s lengthy proof uses a highly unconventional approach that even adept mathematicians are not familiar with. “At this point, he is probably the only one that knows it all,” Goldfeld said.

Human stem cells restore hearing for deaf gerbils
Scientists have successfully restored hearing to deaf gerbils using human embryonic stem cells. After treating 18 gerbils that were completely deaf in one ear, the team reported an average 46 percent recovery rate in hearing among the creatures.
Gerbils, rather than mice, were selected for the experiments because they have a hearing range similar to that of humans. 
“If this was a human patient, it would mean going from being so deaf as to be unable to hear a lorry or truck on the street to being able to maintain a conversation,” said Marcelo Rivolta of Britain’s University of Sheffield, who led the research. He noted that human clinical trials could begin in “a few years.”

The Carnegie Mellon Philharmonic couldn’t have chosen a better program to celebrate its 100th anniversary and the beginning of a new season. A world premiere of the recently commissioned Centennial Suite filled the first half, made up of four sections, each by a different composition faculty member. But after intermission, the highlight of Carnegie Mellon faculty segued into an impressive interpretation of Tchaikovsky’s Fourth Symphony.
Maestro Ronald Zollman, director of orchestral studies and associate professor in the School of Music, led the concert, which — although it included five different composers — was united by calls for peace and celebrations of individual ingenuity. The strong performance highlighted the talent of the young orchestra.
The first part of the Centennial Suite was composed by Marilyn Taft Thomas, composition and theory professor. Titled “Celebration,” the work featured numerous solos that lent a jazzy lyricism to the otherwise unpredictable work. Thomas described the piece as “light hearted,” but the piece is stylistically complicated, twisting through moods every few bars. Professor of composition Leonardo Balada’s “Memories No. 1 — Barcelona 1938” — inspired by his childhood memories of the Spanish Civil War — came next. The piece was dense both emotionally and musically, but the orchestra did a fine job navigating the demanding score.
The stylistic tone of Centennial Suite took an abrupt, dramatic spin in the first bars of the third section, during professor of composition and theory Nancy Galbraith’s “Euphonic Blue.” Working in a different harmonic universe than the previous movements, “Euphonic Blue” moved seamlessly through a series of lush, melodious passages. Rachel Blumenthal, principal flute and a master's student in the School of Music, provided the highlights of the piece with her gentle, tasteful solos.
Zollman rightfully allowed a brief pause before the last section, associate professor of composition Reza Vali’s “The Darkness of Fury.” The segment began with an orchestral roar and launched headlong into an angular fugue that made its way through the entire ensemble.
The first half of the program, being a world premiere, naturally drew attention to the music itself more than to the talents of the players onstage. However, the students performed Tchaikovsky’s notoriously demanding Fourth Symphony with such confidence, it was easy to forget you were listening to a group of college students.
Although Tchaikovsky is known as the arch-Romantic, immortalized in his long, plaintive melodies, the orchestra managed to accentuate an under-appreciated facet of the composer’s talent: humor. The third movement — sometimes treated as a jolly throwaway keeping everyone from the ballistic energy of the finale — was rendered as a fiercely detailed, sophisticated movement. Even as the symphony progressed into its final movement, Zollman and the players maintained an ear for Tchaikovsky’s jokes, like the thunderous low brass giving way to delicate, chirping violins. After rolling to a magnificent climax, the orchestra received a long, deserved ovation.
The orchestra's commanding performance of Tchaikovsky demonstrated exactly what Carnegie Mellon is most proud of: work ethic. Not only did these students prove that they could tackle an imposing variety of contemporary styles with limited preparation, as they did with the Centennial Suite, they also showed their dedication to precise and sensitive performances of notoriously challenging works. As the strings sunk into the first iterations of Tchaikovsky’s thick, sensuous melodies, one couldn’t help but think that our hearts are in the work, but so are our ears.

The Imperfect Health exhibit at the Miller Gallery isn’t just art — it’s a collection of thought-provoking pieces that range from the ordinary to the wildly imaginative. The pieces are part of a strikingly relevant social commentary and a deafening statement about the future of the world that will resound with students from every major and discipline.
The exhibit, which opened last Friday, is focused on the medicalization of architecture, and urban and landscape design. It is curated by Giovanna Borasi and Mirko Zardini, who are both architects and curators at the Canadian Centre for Architecture in Montréal, which organized the exhibit. The exhibit’s pieces question whether health is the responsibility of the individual or society through analysis of architecture and other cultural components.
According to the gallery guide, Pittsburgh’s main industries since its steel days have been health care and technology — two important aspects of the show’s major themes — making it an ideal city for the exhibit.
The project began as a way to study the effects that have resulted and will result in the future from the medicalization of all areas of society, but especially architecture. “Our goal with this exhibition is to investigate the backside and the gray zone that architects don’t want to speak about.... We’re examining the ideas of urbanism, efficiency, speed,” said Zardini, who came in with co-curator Borasi from Montréal to give a special tour of the exhibit.
“It’s hard to find something that hasn’t been embodied by humans,” Borasi said. “We’re studying and showing the unexpected consequences of work, like urbanization on nature for example. It’s just difficult to define, with a clear line, what is good and bad, and what is healthy and unhealthy right now for the future.”
The exhibit features a wide variety of art forms: plans for mass pork production, a paper sculpture that represents mad cow disease, photographs of green spaces in cities, video clips of trees, diagrams of cells, music videos against e-waste, infrared images of parks, toy figurines from the movie Wall-E, and visualizations of air toxins and dust particles.
Each floor of the three-story exhibit is themed. The first focuses largely on food production and agriculture, the second on green living in cities and urban development, and the third on physical health and aging.
“...Because our bodies are the only thing left to us. Years ago, we had the possibility of improving and making progress to share in our society. We had a collective hope for a better future. But now, the faith in the collective, the hope for a better future, has been lost. Mentally, we protect all that we have left,” Zardini said about the focuses of the exhibit.
A heavy emphasis on the future of architecture and, in a broader sense, society, gives the exhibit an almost futuristic feel. However, each floor features boxes on the wall that focus on a theme in the news, bringing it back to the present. The news themes include epidemics, obesity, allergies, asthma, cancer, and aging; the articles date from the 1920s to as recently as a few months ago. The staff will continue to update these boxes with current events as they occur.
Additionally, Borasi and Zardini have included the stairs and elevators in the exhibit. Zardini explained that the elevator is a prime example of the medicalization of architecture. Although it was originally created to make life easier both for those who have trouble going up and down the stairs and those who don’t, the elevator has now taken on a negative connotation.
“It’s now considered a way to enable obesity,” Zardini said. “And since personal health is now a public concern, architects are now trying to hide the elevators in their designs.”
The exhibit has been under construction since the summer, with student employees from all disciplines coming together to help get it up and running. While many students in design and art management are involved with the gallery, other majors and programs are represented as well.
Sophomore computer science major Eugene Scanlon was part of the tech crew that helped compile the exhibit’s technical features, including televisions, DVD loops, and projectors. “It’s a great exhibit to come to, because there’s so much interesting stuff. I think it’ll really help people think about things outside of their majors,” Scanlon said.
The exhibit is full of surprising details that give visitors a complete experience. For Friday’s event, the female student workers and staffers donned paper nurses caps, a small but clever nod to the nuances of the exhibit.
Overall the exhibit is clearly laid out, but is slightly overwhelming at times. The focus is extremely broad and dynamic, with futuristic architecture in one corner of a room, scientific research on domestic dust in another, and a study on aging in yet another. Walking through, it’s difficult to discern what exactly the curators’ message is. Without hearing firsthand the personal statements of the two curators, as visitors on Friday did, it may be nearly impossible to derive the exhibit’s sophisticated meaning.
There is a clear emphasis on architecture that winds throughout, however, as emphatically discussed by the curators: “The object of architecture should not be to find a cure or a solution [to the health and industry problems] that exist. It should be to propose something to take care of us,” Borasi said.
It’s challenging to meld the three themes of food production, urban planning, and health and aging into one project that has a cohesive thread, but the information presented is relevant and sobering. Whether or not you can synthesize an easy explanation from the exhibit, it will no doubt leave you with much to think about and new perspectives from which to regard everyday objects and events.
The exhibit is educational and analytic, and is perhaps best described as a societal, physical, and mental health report. Rather than showcasing theme-centered works of art, the exhibit invites critical thought by displaying scientific evidence pertaining to the present state of society and the possible consequences of trying to solve these problems.
“This was the hardest exhibit we’ve ever created,” Zardini said. “We don’t have a slogan or a quick thing we can give you to go and tell people about what you’ve seen here. You don’t walk out with a clear-cut conclusion, just a lot of things to think about.”
The Miller Gallery is located in the Purnell Center for the Arts and will feature Imperfect Health until Feb. 24.

Sometimes, fact is truly stranger than fiction.
Case in point: In 8, defense attorney Charles Cooper stutteringly argues to Chief Judge Vaughn R. Walker that he doesn’t need evidence to prove his case. It’s absurd to the point of disbelief, but the most shocking part is that it actually happened — in the most talked-about court case of 2010, no less.
Audience members got to experience this absurdity first-hand last Monday in McConomy Auditorium when the School of Drama and Alumni Relations presented a staged reading of the play, featuring Tony Award-nominated alum Rory O’Malley (CFA ’03).
8 tells the story of the court case against Proposition 8, which amended the California state constitution to outlaw same-sex marriages. 8 is unique in that the entire play is compiled solely from interviews with the plaintiffs, quotes from media interviews, and court transcripts of the trial.
O’Malley, who co-founded the marriage equality advocacy group Broadway Impact, first had the idea for the play when a federal appeals court ordered that the video footage of the trial be sealed. He and the other co-founders of Broadway Impact, Gavin Creel and Jenny Kanelos, decided that it was important for the story of Perry v. Schwarzenegger, the court case in question, to be made public.
So, Academy Award-winning screenplay writer Dustin Lance Black combed through court transcripts and conducted interviews with the plaintiffs, then pieced together verbatim quotes to create 8. The first reading in New York City took place last year and featured an all-star cast, including Morgan Freeman, John Lithgow, and another Carnegie Mellon alum, Matt Bomer (CFA ’01). Since then, over 275 readings have been held in 47 states.
If you didn’t know that the play was taken straight from court transcripts, you would find its plot difficult to believe — the defense looks so inept that, were it fiction, you would roll your eyes at how one-sided the case seemed. But as O’Malley emphasized in a Q & A session after the reading, “Many times people thought that [Black] was writing it to make the other side look bad, [but] they really did look this bad.... I heard him say that he didn’t think he needed any evidence in a federal courtroom, and it was shocking, but it’s not that he didn’t need any, it’s just that he didn’t have any.”
While some of the material may be hard to believe, the reading, performed by O’Malley and a mix of Carnegie Mellon students and professors, made it more convincing by bringing the script to life. Since the actors were reading the script while performing, some occasionally stumbled over their lines, but the fumbling proved to be only a minor distraction.
Assistant professor of acting Cameron Knight wielded sharp wit as David Boies, one of the attorneys for the plaintiffs; by showing Boies’ fierce intelligence, Knight made it easy to understand why any potential witness for the defense would fear Boies’ cross-examination. Similarly, O’Malley showcased plaintiff attorney Ted Olson’s incredible oratory skills, delivering his closing remarks so movingly that it makes one wonder how anyone could find court proceedings dry or dull.
On the other side of the aisle, associate professor of drama Ingrid Sonnichsen presented a deliciously despicable portrayal of Maggie Gallagher, the former president and co-founder of the National Organization for Marriage and an outspoken opponent of marriage equality.
The play’s most compelling piece of evidence for marriage equality isn’t actually from the trial, but rather from two of the plaintiffs: lesbian partners Sandy Stier (played by senior drama major Casey Anderson) and Kris Perry (senior drama major Emily Koch). In one scene during a court recess, they talk with their twin sons, Elliot (sophomore drama major Sawyer Pierce) and Spencer (sophomore drama major Steven Robertson) about the boys’ classes and what the family will do after the trial.
Interwoven throughout their conversation are cuts over to Gallagher, who is expounding upon the the damage that homosexual parents cause their children. Through the juxtaposition, the ordinary family conversation, heightened by the actors’ spot-on portrayal of family dynamics, becomes a profoundly touching counter-argument to Gallagher’s rant.
8 provides a captivatingly clear look at the Proposition 8 case and proves that the facts point decidedly in favor of gay marriage. O’Malley hoped that audience members who were undecided about the issue before seeing 8 would take the evidence presented in the play to heart.
Although he admitted that most of the theater and theater-going community tends to already support marriage equality, he said that the play can equip viewers with arguments and evidence that they can use to convince others. “We don’t want to be preaching to the choir,” he said. “But we are teaching the choir to sing.”
If 8 is its inspiration, that choir is sure to come away singing a beautifully convincing melody.

Carnegie Mellon students with a penchant for style are adapting to the nippy autumn air with some fresh fall looks. New York Fashion Week left us inspired with Marchesa’s gilded gowns and Marc Jacobs’ punchy patterns, but infusing runway haute couture into the styles of busy students can often prove difficult. As the weather cools down, you may be tempted to throw on a pair of sweats before heading to class, but before you reach for your fleece, check out these simple yet classy alternatives to spice up your fall wardrobe.
Colors
This season’s richest hues include garnet (deep red looks great with anything), olive (matches every shade of denim), and shimmery gold with muted navy (a classic preppy pairing). Whether you choose to add a scarlet lip to an all black ensemble or slip on a gold and navy striped cardigan, seasonally appropriate colors can add a vibrant edge to any outfit. If you’re feeling up to the challenge, try your hand at some Oscar de la Renta-inspired colors like peacock blue, salmon, or fuchsia, as displayed in his line at Fashion Week.
Prints
Instead of opting for last season’s boho-inspired, large-print floral, try a fresh mini-floral skirt in a fall color like navy or orange. Subtle animal prints can also amp up any classic outfit by giving it a sultry twist. Pair a simple Peter Pan-style button-down shirt and a pleated corduroy skirt with a leopard cardigan for a spin on classic prep style.
Fair Isle cashmere can be a cozy option for those crisp fall mornings. Combining your favorite Fair Isle sweater with a sweet, country-style gingham chino can give you a more laid-back look. For a more sophisticated alternative, twist the summer stripe by coupling it with a schoolboy blazer.
Textures
Although it may be easy to reach for that favorite pair of jeans each morning, try to get creative with your fall fabrics. Tone down the velvet seen in Gucci, Burberry, and Lanvin’s fall lines by incorporating smaller pieces of the elegant and luxurious fabric into your closet. You can combine style with practicality in a warm pair of eggplant velvet jeans or in an A-line velvet skirt.
Tweed can often be stereotyped as 1980s business suit or grandma chic, but you can transform the stiff fabric with a fitted, slate gray tweed blazer and black leather pants. If tweed still seems too formal for your casual university style, corduroys can serve as your fall staple instead. Choose a punchy color like mint green, coral, or magenta to complement a simple Oxford shirt or a beige pullover.
Herringbone and bouclé have brought warmth to a whole new level in fall fabrics. Usually on the thicker side, jackets and popovers in navy herringbone or bouclé can add texture to an otherwise bland outfit — check out your local J.Crew for some great options.
Shoes
It is finally time to trade in those summer flip-flops for a pair of suede brogues or patent leather loafers, which double as great complements for both formal skirts and casual denim. Because the equestrian trend has returned this season, a pair of over-the-knee leather boots will be a staple this fall. Look for a boot that fits tight to the calf and has a matte finish. If you’re feeling a bit edgy, try your hand at a Calvin Klein-inspired snakeskin pump.
Calvin Klein’s Spring/Summer 2013 line at Fashion Week can also serve as a beacon of light for those still stumped at the prospect of changing their wardrobe. When in doubt, keep it simple: Minimalism goes a long way. Although many of you may be tempted by those statement graphic tees, last year’s leggings, or a college sweatshirt, dare to try something new. If the task seems daunting, start out classic and trade in that T-shirt for a clean white Oxford.

Last Saturday was an extravagant night for the Pittsburgh Symphony Orchestra (PSO). A scarlet dragon-clad banner and other Chinese-themed decorations adorned the usually bare stage at Heinz Hall. Guests in ball gowns and tuxedos arrived in large numbers. Even Pennsylvania governor Tom Corbett and state senator Dominic Pileggi were in attendance.
Seven months after the Chinese New Year, the PSO opened its 2012-13 season with a celebration of the Year of the Dragon. With an excellent sampling of works and a special appearance by Chinese pianist Lang Lang, the PSO reminded Pittsburgh of its ability to perform impeccably while bringing in high-profile guest soloists.
Despite the décor, the first half of the program served less as a celebration of the Year of the Dragon and more as a celebration of the PSO. Giuseppe Verdi’s Overture to La forza del destino was a strong and virtually flawless opener, and the famous “Wedding March” from Felix Mendelssohn’s A Midsummer Night’s Dream elicited “ahs” of recognition and excitement from the audience. The PSO clearly wanted to launch its new season with a bang, and it succeeded.
Just when the audience had likely forgotten about the theme — as it was too enraptured by the orchestra’s performance — PSO music director Manfred Honeck playfully announced that the orchestra would “summon the dragon to Heinz Hall” with a fierce performance of Igor Stravinsky’s The Firebird. As Honeck promised, the dragon arrived: Dancers carried a long, undulating paper dragon into the hall, amid loud gongs and clangs of traditional Chinese percussion.
After this entertaining departure from the program, Lang took the stage amidst wild cheers of excitement. Lang was a performer in every sense of the word: He was a delight to both watch and hear.
Although Lang was clearly a skilled musician without the extra flair, he still added drama to everything he played, almost to the point of dance. During violent passages, Lang bent close to the keys and trembled with energy; during calmer moments, he leaned back and stroked the keys. From his extravagant performing style, it was easy to see how this young superstar had charmed his way to the top. But while his style was charming, it sometimes made his performance seem less musically genuine.
After his performance, Lang received a full standing ovation and enthusiastic applause. Once the wildest cheers had died down, Lang even gave a brief thank-you speech — a rare move for a guest soloist. But to the audience’s disappointment, Lang declined to play an encore.
With the Year of the Dragon theme as its backdrop, the PSO made a stunning and lasting impression on its first night of the season. Though Lang briefly stole the show, the message of the evening was clear: This is why you come to the orchestra. We can only hope to expect this level of performance from the PSO throughout the year.
The PSO’s fall schedule continues next week with the New World Symphony, featuring renowned American-baritone Thomas Hampson. Carnegie Mellon Night at the PSO is this Saturday; discounted tickets are available for students.

It’s starting to look a lot like autumn. At NBC, this means not only the beginning of a new season and some new shows, but also the beginning of the end for some of our favorite comedies.
The Office
The Office has been a comedy warhorse since its stateside debut in 2005. Last season, its eighth, attempted to deal with the absence of Steve Carrell’s celebrated portrayal of Michael Scott. Ed Helms, of The Hangover fame, took on the lead role and the inimitable James Spader joined the cast as another socially inept boss. Overall, it seems the show has struggled with sustaining its energy after Jim and Pam reached stasis in their marriage. They built the emotional core of the show in its early years and were responsible for its many great season-closing moments. But there’s another reason to look forward to the ninth and final season. The Office plans to bring back Greg Daniels, the producer responsible for its highly successful first few seasons, and we can expect the return of many characters from Dunder Mifflin’s history to round out the show’s life. The new season premieres Sept. 20.
30 Rock
30 Rock, a reliable comedy about the inner workings of an NBC variety show, is in a similarly sinking boat as is The Office. This season, set to begin Oct. 4, will be the last and will be abbreviated to only 13 episodes. Tina Fey’s writing has earned the show a whole cabinet of awards, still holding the record for most Emmy nominations for a comedy in a single year. While the show has fewer plot strands to resolve than The Office does, the nuanced meta-comedy will be missed. The good news is that 30 Rock has never slowed down. Perhaps it has become a bit monochromatic as a number of characters begin to settle down, but the subtle, smiling satire of Kenneth Parcell still bites and Tracy Jordan’s loose cannon antics continue to inspire the best use of brief flashback since Arrested Development. It’s still a marvelous show and, thankfully, we’ll get to hear more of Jack Donaghy’s election commentary.
Parks & Recreation
Parks & Recreation remains the only comedy that is relatively stable as it enters its fifth season, despite having the poorest ratings of them all. Luckily, it’s only getting stronger as the fictional town of Pawnee keeps developing itself into the most vivid local portrait on television. Amy Poehler, Nick Offerman, and Aziz Ansari continue to turn in strong readings of Michael Schur’s writing. As Leslie Knope’s love interest, Ben, takes off for Washington, we will get to see a masterful crew of filmmakers juggle two locations and the physical separation of a great on-screen duo. The absurd antics of Chris Pratt’s Andy Dwyer are as endearing as ever and, as the season four finale suggested, he will be attempting to join the Pawnee police force in upcoming episodes. The new season premieres Sept. 20.
The New Normal
Ryan Murphy, the creator of shows Nip/Tuck, Glee, and American Horror Story, has added a new show to the NBC comedy group that has stirred up plenty of talk since its debut last week. The New Normal wrestles with the desire of a young, married gay couple to start a family. Glee fans will recognize the show’s attempt to deal with multiple viewpoints and arguments while looking to tolerance as a moral scoreboard. The show is based on Murphy’s real-life experience of trying to adopt.

Broadway performer Ramin Karimloo put on an impressive and intimate show at 89.3 WQED headquarters in Oakland last Tuesday.
Karimloo is a well-known musical theater star, famous on Broadway for playing the Phantom in The Phantom of the Opera as well as playing the same role in the sequel Love Never Dies. Karimloo has also starred in the classic Broadway musical Les Misérables as both Enjolras and Jean Valjean, and is featured in the 25th anniversary recordings of both Les Misérables and The Phantom of the Opera.
The Iranian-born Canadian actor released a new album in April titled Ramin. The album includes many of his signature show tunes, as well as energetic pop music. Ramin’s visit to WQED was part of his concert tour and, all in all, the concert was engaging and musically satisfying.
In the intimate setting of WQED’s theater — the same where Mister Rogers was filmed — Karimloo was a joy to watch. He carried himself with a charisma that immediately attracted attention. With him were his band members and rising singer-songwriter Sheri Miller.
Although the audience was somewhat small, Karimloo’s performance was anything but. He performed songs from his album, as well as original songs written by himself and longtime friend and actor Hadley Fraser. Additionally, he sang a few crowd favorites such as “Bring Him Home” from Les Misérables and Phantom ballad “Music of the Night.”
In addition to providing stunning vocals, Karimloo played several instruments during the concert. From the guitar to the banjo to the piano, Ramin played and sang beautifully. The experience was quite different from seeing him on stage in one of his signature roles, yet it was just as entertaining and impressive.
Surprisingly, Karimloo did not sing the famous “Til I Hear You Sing” from Andrew Lloyd Webber’s Love Never Dies. This was an obvious disappointment to the crowd, for it was this song that introduced his voice to many of his current fans.
The backup vocals provided by Miller were unimpressive next to Karimloo’s voice; she seemed to have trouble keeping the harmonies in tune. During the show, she performed one of her original songs, which, despite interesting lyrics, fell flat due to redundant chord progressions. Perhaps the concert would have been better with a backup vocalist as powerful and engaging as Karimloo himself.
Nevertheless, Karimloo put on a splendid show for his fan base in Pittsburgh. The concert ran a bit over two hours long, but did not feel at all lengthy. Karimloo’s outstanding voice and tremendous stage presence held attention the entire time.

The powerful bass vibrations and skin-prickling vocals of AWOLNATION were heard at the Altar Bar last Thursday in a sold-out show that disappointed no one.
The California-based band rose to its current stardom last year with the release of its epic single, “Sail,” and is also known for songs like “Burn it Down,” “Guilty, Filthy Soul,” and “Not Your Fault.” Recalling the screaming vocals of Nirvana, elating chorus characteristic of gospel, and bassy tones of dubstep, the group’s music cannot be placed in any one genre, making its recent album Megalithic Symphony fall into “a genre of my own,” as lead singer Aaron Bruno said in an interview before the show.
White Wives, ZEALE, and Imagine Dragons — three acts ranging from hard rock to hip-hop — opened for AWOLNATION, reflecting the wide range of the band’s music. Although White Wives’ intense guitar lines invoked no more than slight head-nodding in the audience, ZEALE’s indie hip-hop sound provoked a remarkable increase in energy in the crowd. By the end of Imagine Dragons, the audience was buzzing with adrenaline.
Throughout the show, AWOLNATION’s Bruno maintained a strong bond with the audience. “I prefer smaller venues like the Altar Bar because you feel intimate with the crowd,” he said. This intimacy was definitely present during the show as he masterfully conducted the crowd’s energy throughout the night. During the vitality-packed hit, “Burn it Down,” he told the audience to get close to the ground and, after a few seconds of slow guitar-strumming and tooth-grinding efforts to resist jumping, the crowd simultaneously leaped up in the air and wildly danced to the song.
The band maintained a balance between intense and soft emotions throughout the night. During one of the calmer songs, Bruno asked members of the crowd to put their arms over the shoulder of the person standing next to them, “Even if you don’t know them — especially if you don’t know them.” Later in the night, he shared a particularly intimate moment with the audience when, having been left alone on stage, he broke into a genuine, heartfelt rendition of “Lean on Me” by Bill Withers, offering his lone voice to the audience in all its imperfection.
As a whole, AWOLNATION’s excellent performance at the Altar Bar can be explained by the same factors that make its songs go beyond the boundaries of simple likeability: The equilibrium between hope and desperation, rebellion and romance, wild guitar riffs and heavenly choruses gives its listeners an unintimidating, almost visceral feeling of revolution. Perhaps the band’s tour motto best summarizes it: “Never let your fear decide your fate.”

Dear Patrick,
I swung by the TOC last week, and I actually got a lot of interviews out of it! But I suck at talking to people. Have any interviewing advice?
Thanks,
Generally Regret Entering Appointments, Tensely Evading Select Technical Wringers, Enter Any Knowledge Necessary for Exact Solutions Surrounding Interviews, Some Inquiries Need Technical Explanations, Requiring Vocation, Interviews Exterminate Work Shot
Dear GREATEST WEAKNESS IS INTERVIEWS,
Talking to people in general is tough, but interviews aren’t so bad. Just keep in mind, you’re talking about your favorite subject: yourself! Remember, the company likes you already, otherwise you wouldn’t be there. The interview is your chance to impress.
Technical questions are easy; just make sure you know your stuff beforehand. When it comes to the “situational” questions all the big companies ask, don’t sweat them. If your interviewer is at all technical, they’re rolling their eyes at all of them. You only need to worry if it’s an HR person (HR people are terrible). Just try to get on your interviewer’s good side. If they like you, you’re in.
Just like a first date, except you don’t have to pay,
Patrick Hoskins 
Dear Patrick,
My addiction to the internet is getting in the way of doing my homework. I’ve tried blocking certain sites on my computer, but I always manage to give in to the addiction by finding new internet distractions. HOW CAN I MAKE IT STOP?
Sincerely, **
**Just Understand, Need Kitten Images Everyday
Dear JUNKIE,
The internet is a dangerous place. There’s a fresh cat picture around every corner, and you think, “Just one more, it won’t take too long. I can stop whenever.” Next thing you know, it’s four in the morning and those cat pictures have just gotten weird. I’ve been there, friend.
Welcome to internet rehab. Blocking those web pages is a good start, but it’s too easy to unblock. Try editing your hosts.txt file to have “127.0.0.1” at the end of the file. This keeps you from connecting to the site. If that’s too drastic, actually set time limits for yourself. Break your work down into smaller chunks, and after each chunk take a small break. Lastly, try getting away from your computer. You probably don’t need it for most of your work. Just print out any online notes you need and go study in the library.
Just don’t bring your smartphone with you,
Patrick Hoskins

During the summer, superstar EDM DJ deadmau5 caused a bit of controversy when he wrote a Tumblr post that called out fellow DJs (and himself) for the lack of skill involved in DJing. He wrote, “I think given about one hour of instruction, anyone with minimal knowledge of ableton and music tech in general could DO what im doing at a deadmau5 concert.”
As one might expect, throngs of DJs lashed out at deadmau5 for his oversimplification of their performances. While aspects like song selection are undoubtedly important when DJing, the more relevant point deadmau5 brought up is the lack of improvisation in the EDM world.
Most major EDM DJs show up to a venue not only with their DJ equipment, but also with a massive light and sometimes fireworks show — shows that are planned out, moment by moment. Although the DJ may be twisting knobs, triggering effects, running loops, and making dramatic gestures, these movements are all pre-planned.
I’m not saying lights and fireworks are a bad thing, but when it comes to the point when an artist lets his live act dictate his musical performance, I have a problem with it. Deadmau5 and most other EDM DJs are like pop stars who lip sync their shows because actually singing would interfere with their dancing.
The creative tools that modern DJs have at their disposal are endless, and part of being a DJ is reaching beyond your comfort zone. Don’t plan out your sets track by track and don’t script out your knob turning. There are scores of DJs who follow this, still have fancy flashing lights, and still lead the crowd into a dancing fury.
So go home and start DJing. You’ll be a professional within the hour — unless it really isn’t as easy as the man with a flashing mouse head makes it out to be.

The Cambridge Footlights
8 10
If you’ve yet to experience The Cambridge Footlights, get thee hence to McConomy Auditorium for a universally acclaimed hour of British sketch comedy, presented by Scotch’n’Soda. The Footlights are the nurturing environment out of which many of the greatest modern comedians have risen, including John Cleese, Stephen Fry, Hugh Laurie, Julian Fellowes, and Douglas Adams. The troupe never fails to deliver a brilliant blend of comedy styles ranging from Python to Kaufman.
Prometheus
7 10 1
After an endless, deliberately vague marketing campaign that offered enough for even the most tepid fanboy to squeal, Prometheus arrived to general satisfaction in June, proving that it was indeed a prequel to the Alien franchise. Despite the film’s messy plot structure, it is impossible to deny that Ridley Scott delivers a series of shimmering designs captured with his usual cinematic chutzpah.  
Noomi Rapace establishes herself as a capable multilingual actress in her first major English performance, playing Elizabeth Shaw, a strong woman of devout faith. Charlize Theron is Meredith Vickers, a suspicious suit. And, of course, Michael Fassbender turns in a moving, nuanced portrait of David, an android more human than many of the other characters.
Alien

The granddaddy of all sci-fi horror — or perhaps the grandmama? ­— Alien still stands as the greatest triumph of Ridley Scott’s career. It demonstrates an impeccable control of suspense absent in Blade Runner and a patient, multilayered visual language that had disappeared by the arrival of Gladiator in 2000.
Alien tells the simple tale of a space-exploration crew trying to return to Earth. Sigourney Weaver’s Ellen Ripley has become an enduring icon in both cinematic history and feminist fiction, and the film boasts some of the boldest art design in recent memory, created by the twisted, genitalia-obsessed H.R. Giger. The final 15 minutes are a model of suspenseful editing and a triumph of visual effects. Alien is one of the best films of 1979 and is required viewing for any fan of sci-fi or horror.

Tony Award-nominated actor Rory O'Malley (CFA '03) returned to his alma mater last Monday to participate in a staged reading of 8, a play that documents the court case battling to overturn Proposition 8 in California. The Tartan spoke with him after the reading to talk about his experiences at Carnegie Mellon, his activism work, and his role in The Book of Mormon.
First, I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about your time at Carnegie Mellon and your experiences with the drama department, and how that shaped your career.
Well, I got here in the fall of '99, and it shaped so much of my life, being here and being a Tartan and going to school here at Carnegie Mellon, because there's such a drive that the students have here for whatever their passion is, be it computers or drama. And I love that there's so much diversity in that.
And I think that really fed into how I got involved and let myself get involved with activism, because I felt that there were so many amazing people who were so good at what they did here surrounding me, and it's definitely very different from being an actor, but it truly broadened my horizons in a way that, had I been anywhere else, that I don't think that I would have really appreciated as much. And like I said, we saw Vagina Monologues here, Judy Shepard came to speak here — things happened here that really did shape me and it took coming here [to McConomy] to think of that, like, "Oh, a lot of the stuff that I'm doing now started — the seeds [were] at Carnegie Mellon and my time here."
Was forming Broadway Impact your first foray into activism?
It really was. I mean, I was the guy who yelled at CNN — I got really angry and, you know, you get like, "Aw, dammit," you know, "I wanted it to be this way." Well, when Obama was nominated as the candidate for president in 2008, I felt like I had to stop doing that, and so I did go home to Cleveland and volunteered for months there and did phone banks and rallies and whatever they told me to do, I did, and that really did spark my activism. And because of Prop 8 [passing], that translated into what Broadway Impact is now, because of my friends Jenny Kanelos and Gavin Creel and other people in the theater community who were so devastated by that, we were really spurred into action.
It sounds like you managed to get the Broadway community pretty mobilized. Was that just you guys coordinating everything, or was it everyone coming together?
It's everyone. People are like, "How have you been able to grow into what you are in just four years?" But really, it's because we've been able to harness the passion of the theater community because they have so much. Whatever cause they get behind, it's unreal what they're able to accomplish, and because they are articulate and passionate people who want to reach out to others — that's what we are as actors, inherently — it just makes them the ideal group of people to do activist work and to make a difference and tell a story of why something has to change.
I have to ask — what was it like working on The Book of Mormon and getting nominated for a Tony?
It was a dream come true. When you leave here at Carnegie Mellon, you just hope that you'll work, you know — "Getting a job would be so fantastic!" — but to have the job that is literally the most fun I've ever had in my life, to have that job that I get to show up to every day and to have been nominated for a Tony, which is so surreal and I still can't believe that that happened, it's amazing, you know? But honestly, having Broadway Impact and doing this kind of stuff [that is] the foundation of something even greater than any of that, that has made me even more happy than all that.

For the upcoming election, a new Pennsylvania law passed in early August requires that all voters, including students, must present some form of government-issued photo identification at the polls.
The Voter ID Law specifies that the identification used must have a picture and an expiration date. As Carnegie Mellon student IDs have both already, students are allowed to use their student ID in place of a state-issued ID. This holds true for 15 other universities in Pennsylvania, including the University of Pittsburgh. All other universities do not issue IDs that expire. In these cases, the university can issue stickers to put on student IDs to give them expiration dates.
“We’re working with universities that issue stickers — because if you have an ID card that expires, it counts, and the stickers expire, so they make the student ID card count,” Daniel Walker-Murray, a campus organizer for the Pennsylvania Public Interest Research Group (PennPIRG), said. “We’re trying to get them to issue these stickers before the election.”
According to the website of U.S. PIRG — the federation of state PIRGs — PennPIRG is one of 47 lobbying groups for college student interests. One of PennPIRG’s goals is to get students to register to vote. Its goal for Carnegie Mellon is 1,000 students. Since the Voter ID Law was passed, PennPIRG members have also tried to inform as many students as possible about the new law.
Walker-Murray said that the law hinders a citizen’s ability to vote. “We’ve actually done research and found that it targets three groups: students, the elderly, and the impoverished.”
Walker-Murray explained that students don’t typically have driver’s licenses, so the law affects them in that sense. Those living and working in the city are also greatly affected by this law because they generally use public transportation and don’t have driver’s licenses, according to University of Pittsburgh law professor Jessie Allen.
Carnegie Mellon students’ opinions of the law are split. Some, such as junior economics major Avery Calkins, are uncertain about the implementation. “Personally, I think that it shouldn’t go into effect this year because it’s really hard to get a government-issued ID,” she said. “They should give that time.”
Calkins also questioned the efficacy of the law. 
“I think that [our ability to use student IDs] has its good and bad points, because it’s important for students to be able to vote,” she said. “But if the government is really so gung-ho about the Voter ID Law and trying to crack down, then why are they allowing IDs that wouldn’t be accepted at the airport?”
Other students, such as first-year mechanical engineering major Nick Gray, support it completely.
“I think it’s necessary,” he said. “I think people need to prove who they are, and if people are unable to vote because of financial reasons, they should just ask the government for help.”
“It seems like an extra hassle,” Rachel Fowler, first-year business major, said. “But it also makes sense, because without a photo ID, someone could commit fraudulent voting.”
However, Allen said there is no evidence that the type of fraudulent voting this law will prevent even exists.
“There’s no evidence, and the state of Pennsylvania admits they have no evidence, that that kind of voter fraud is possible. They even signed a stipulation in the court that, even if this law is not put into effect, this fraud may not even happen. It’s all a hypothetical situation,” she said.
“I really think that voter ID laws are a solution in search of a problem,” she said. “I think certainly they will keep some people from voting.”
“Nine percent of the Pennsylvania electoral voters don’t have the right ID. That’s 750,000,” she continued. “Apart from the people that will actually be prevented from voting, the implications of a law like this that has recently been passed will cause a whole bunch of other problems, because people don’t know about it.”
According to Allen, there is currently a lawsuit to overturn the Voter ID Law.
“This is a case in the Pennsylvanian State Court brought by the ESLU Advancement Project, which is the national justification project, and some law firms representing a bunch of Pennsylvanian people,” Allen said. “They’re [the people] unable to get the required ID and they, and many others like them, will be unable to vote because of this law and this law violates their constitutional right.
“Earlier this summer, a state trial judge refused to stop the law, saying the plaintiffs had failed to prove to him that this law was unconstitutional and failed to prove that a large number of people would be kept from voting,” Allen explained.
The issue stems, Allen said, from a disagreement over the purpose of the law.
“The question of why [this law was passed] is debated,” she said. “The state legislators who passed the law say ... that the reason we need such a law is to prevent voter fraud. The people who are challenging it as unconstitutional say that there is no problem of voter fraud that would need [a photo ID] and that it is to suppress people from voting.”
PennPIRG will host a press conference on Wednesday to educate students about this new law and to tell them about their ability to use their Carnegie Mellon student ID card in place of government-issued identification.
“One of the main reasons we’re here is because of the Voter ID Law,” Walker-Murray said. “Personally, I believe that it’s our constitutional right [to vote], and it’s a shame that there’s a sense of student apathy. People think students don’t care.... People in other countries are dying for this opportunity.”

The Pittsburgh Parking Authority has announced that parking on Margaret Morrison Street will now be metered, requiring money from those wishing to park.
Previously, cars could be parked on the street without cost or time limit. Now there is a central meter machine for the street — it costs $2 per hour with a 10-hour time limit. The parking hours are between 8 a.m. and 6 p.m. Monday through Saturday. Parking remains free on Sundays, and on all other days after 6 p.m. and before 8 a.m.
According to the Carnegie Mellon parking website, meters are monitored by Carnegie Mellon Police Monday through Friday, and by city police on Saturdays. 
Michelle Porter, director of Parking & Transportation Services, said, “We really never had control over the actual street.”
Porter explained that Margaret Morrison was always a city street, and that “the university had an agreement many years ago,” before she was part of Parking & Transportation services.
“The decision was made by the city council and the parking authority to meter the street,” Porter said.
David Onorato, executive director for the Pittsburgh Parking Authority, said that metered parking was put in place after the parking authority “did a field study, in which we went to every street because we were going away from single space meters to the new technology.”
Onorato emphasized that it is within the city’s right to meter parking. “We communicated with Carnegie Mellon Parking,” Onorato said. “The street was always under city authority.”
Porter said that there have not been many negative effects due to the change.
“We haven’t heard of too many problems,” Porter said. However, she said that the change did have a “large effect” on Carnegie Mellon parking.
Porter explained that before Margret Morrison became metered, students used to leave their cars there “for days on end.” 
Now, students are searching for alternative locations on campus to park their vehicles. “This puts a damper on our parking systems,” Porter said.
According to Onorato, with metered prices in effect, the demand for parking spaces on Margaret Morrison street will decrease. This will open up the road for more accessible parking. 
“We are doing this to create available parking for as many people as possible,” Onorato said. He added, “Price is controlled to dictate parking spaces.”
Multiple professors from the Tepper School of Business, whose building is adjacent to Margaret Morrison street, were approached for comment regarding the recent parking changes — but none stated that they parked there regularly, and thus were unaffected by this new metering.
Alex Gerber, a sophomore economics and math major, said, “I think it’s a minor inconvenience. The number of cars parking on Margaret Morrison will diminish.”
Gerber added, “You might as well park your car in Schenley Park and walk.”

Investigative journalist, author, and co-founder and host of radio show Democracy Now! Amy Goodman made an appearance at McConomy Auditorium last Thursday.
Goodman’s lecture, which was part of a tour to promote her book The Silenced Majority: Stories of Uprisings, Occupations, Resistance, and Hope, touched on controversial topics like abortion, war, and the upcoming election, but primarily focused on the importance of modern-day independent media.
“Hearing people speak for themselves: There’s nothing more powerful,” Goodman said. She stressed the importance of a grass-roots media that works to overcome oppressive “corporate media.”
Democracy Now! airs on WRCT, Carnegie Mellon’s student-run radio station. Computer science professor Daniel Sleator, who is part of the Pittsburgh Campaign for Democracy Now (PCDN) — which brought Goodman’s show to WRCT in 2003 — attended the lecture and gave a short opening talk.
“One of the things she emphasized is the need for independent media.... The need for independent, noncorporate media [that isn’t] diluting, distorting, and controlling what people see, what people know, what people believe. That was kind of the main theme,” Sleator said.
Goodman cited the mainstream media representation of the initial Iraq invasion as an example of the need for independent media. According to Goodman, because the Democratic and Republican establishment agreed at that time, the media did not report the strong anti-war sentiment present in the country.
“You had this extreme press instead beating the drums for war,” she said. “The four major nightly newscasts, out of 393 interviews they did in the week leading up to and after Colin Powell’s address ... three were with anti-war representatives. That does not represent mainstream America.”
Goodman kept her lecture interesting with anecdotes from her life as an investigative journalist, her time in East Timor, and her arrest during a 2008 Republican convention. She pressed the issue of localization of politics and the danger of unheard voices, implying that dominating corporate ideals reflected through the media are detrimental to the voices of the people.
Sleator said that in particular, Goodman’s anecdotes about seeing the graves of Frederick Douglass and Susan B. Anthony, and Mitt Romney shaking hands with one of the Koch brothers at the Republican National Convention resonated with him. 
“She told a whole bunch of stories like that. She’s a very articulate, encyclopedic speaker. She knows so many stories and so much history,” Sleator said.
Attendance at the talk was not limited to Carnegie Mellon students and faculty.
“It looked like a real mix,” Sleator said. “I saw a lot of people who definitely weren’t students also. I saw some people from the Occupy movement. One professor brought his whole class.”
“I was very impressed with the turnout,” said junior vocal performance major Kati Richer, who is a staff representative for WRCT, which hosted the talk. “For me, to see all these people who listen to our campus radio station, it really felt great. The entirety of McConomy was packed. There were people sitting on the stairs.”
Closing out the well-attended and engaging lecture, Goodman said, “I think the media could be the greatest force for peace on earth, but instead it’s wielded as a weapon.”

“We are on a burning platform, and we don’t have a choice but to make tough choices if we want our future to be better than our past,” said former U.S. Comptroller General David Walker, as he addressed a group of about 30 people who attended his talk on campus last Wednesday.
Walker visited Carnegie Mellon as part of his “$10 Million a Minute Bus Tour,” which aims to promote fiscal responsibility and present voters with nonpartisan and unbiased solutions to the current financial crisis. The event was hosted by the Heinz College of Public Policy and Information Systems. According to Bryan Tamburro, senior director of strategic initiatives at Heinz College, Walker’s team reached out to policy-oriented schools as a component of its target audience.
The tour, spanning 49 states, is sponsored by the Comeback America Initiative (CAI), which Walker founded and currently heads. According to Walker, the tour is focused on swing states because “the candidates and the media will spend a disproportionate amount of time in the swing states, and they will decide the presidential election.”
“Whichever candidate can convince the American people that they can do the best job of growing the economy, generating jobs, and putting our finances in order should win,” Walker said. “And let me say at the outset that neither candidate has done an adequate job today of putting out a plan that is comprehensive and credible to do this.”
Walker said that the national debt clock, posted at around $16 trillion, “understates our problem” and instead presented the “Burden Barometer,” which was over $70 trillion. 
The Burden Barometer was developed by the CAI. It takes into account “total liabilities and unfunded promises” that will soon become deficits or debts if they are not addressed in a timely manner.
“The problem is not where we are, the problem is not where we’ve been, the problem is where we’re headed. We’re headed on a third-world nation path of debt as a percentage of the economy. That cannot be allowed to happen,” Walker said.
Walker said the majority of our money goes to social security, Medicare and Medicaid, and defense. Walker, also the former chief accountability officer and trustee of Medicare and Medicaid, presented a six-pronged plan to fix the economy. Walker’s plan addresses the budget, defense, tax reforms, social security, healthcare, and political reforms.
He proposed several solutions in each category, including increasing the income tax for the wealthy and keeping taxes in place for the lower income population; replacing party primaries with open primaries, resulting in two candidates with the highest number of votes; and addressing unfunded social security and Medicare promises.
In order to successfully avert a financial crisis, Walker said that the plan addressing these areas would need to be “pro-growth, socially equitable, culturally acceptable, mathematically accurate, politically feasible, and receiving full bipartisan support from the opposite party.”
Tamburro said that Walker’s ideas were interesting, but somewhat unrealistic. “I think he definitely did a good job of getting the information out there within the given amount of time. The solutions he presented were good, but actually executing them would be slightly difficult,” Tamburro said.
But Tamburro also said he hoped the talk made people think. “I hope that people are able to break out of their political mindset, because it isn’t a matter of one president, or one term....” Tamburro said. “No matter who wins, these problems are going to exist and they need to be addressed.”

Dressed in suit jackets, pleated pants or dress skirts, and black shoes, students have pained looks on their faces; stress and mild anticipation etched onto the taut skin over their foreheads.
It’s that time of year again.
The Technical Opportunities Conference (TOC) and the Business Opportunities Conference (BOC) — two of Carnegie Mellon’s networking opportunities for the fall semester — stormed through campus last week, bringing with them a variety of recruiters from across the country.
And, as tradition dictates, first-years and sophomores jumped on the chance to complain about the lack of opportunities provided to them at these conferences. Recruiters don’t take them seriously; nobody will consider their résumés; it’s pointless to go, they say. 
While these complaints are justified — recruiters look for students immersed in their major’s coursework with previous internships — and many first-years and sophomores will not land an internship through the conferences, going to them is not a waste of time.
If you’re a first-year or sophomore, you may receive some snarky comments from an uptight recruiter. You might even be dismissed by them after revealing your undergraduate status. Nevertheless, attending the conferences is a good experience.
Not only do they allow you to get your foot in the door, but they also give you the chance to refine your résumé and hand it out. Even if recruiters don’t take the document seriously, you gain experience from writing a résumé and approaching recruiters about your interests in their companies.
You can also take the opportunity to see how the conferences work — dressing up and experiencing the lines and booths. By the time you’re able to seriously pursue an internship or job at the TOC and BOC, you’ll be a seasoned veteran at the game. You can also experience the phenomenon of an uninterested company so you aren’t flustered if it happens your junior year. On the other hand, it never hurts to experience elation at a company’s impressed remarks.
Attendance at the conferences also allows you to scope out the job market — and the competition. Many companies consistently show up to the TOC and BOC. This gives you the chance to eye those that capture your interest. You can then work toward making yourself marketable to those specific businesses in the future.
As a result, you’ll be able to enter the job fairs in later years with a focused mind and experience. Going to the career fairs early also provides the opportunity to see what type of internships or jobs peers are applying for. Try to notice what makes them stand out to recruiters and use this knowledge to shape your own skill sets.
You might even be surprised by a call from a recruiter after the fairs. Plenty of sophomores make it to the first round of interviews or further for a company they expressed interest in, with many landing internships the summer after their sophomore year. Once you’ve been contacted by a recruiter, the job or internship is fair game.
Even though the TOC and BOC have come and gone, more job fairs are on the way. The Employment Opportunities Conference takes place Oct. 11, with about 150 organizations out to snatch up some new recruits. Don’t downplay the importance of the job fairs on campus: There are opportunities for every level of experience there, even if they may be hidden behind the intimidating number of recruiters seemingly looking for people with more experience.
Braden Kelner (bik@) is a staffwriter for The Tartan, and was shot down by a variety of companies at the TOC this year. And he loved every second of it.

Most Americans can remember exactly where they were on the morning of Sept. 11, 2001. Eleven years later, some people can go about their days without even realizing that 9/11 has come again.
Then, there are those that cannot forget; because their loved ones never came home after that morning; because they ran from the clouds of dust as the World Trade Centers collapsed into heaps of debris; because they selflessly put their lives on the line to volunteer at Ground Zero; because they knew someone in the towers, in the Pentagon, or on the planes.
These people will never forget.
The 11th anniversary of 9/11 has come and gone, but the Carnegie Mellon community did not stop, even for just a moment, to reflect on this tragedy.
My father was a volunteer at Ground Zero. I still live with the fear that he will develop cancer from the dust he inhaled while on site. My mother’s cousin worked next to the World Trade Center. She fled, terrified and covered in rubble, on that morning 11 years ago. 
To this day, she cannot bring herself to return to New York City. 
My best friend’s aunt was not as lucky. Neither was my neighbor or the father of my brother’s friend.
My experiences are not unique. So many people were affected by the tragedy of 9/11; so many people still feel the grief deep in their bones.
Had I known earlier that there were no events planned to commemorate 9/11, I would have taken it upon myself to organize a small candlelight vigil or some other appropriate memorial. But I thought that the Carnegie Mellon community would have some sort of memorial, as we’ve had in prior years.
While not everyone at Carnegie Mellon was personally affected by these tragedies, we still need to take the time to commemorate the victims and heroes of 9/11.
As a nation, we vowed to never forget. But I am saddened to see that Carnegie Mellon has already started. Next year, I hope that the campus can come together to remember 9/11.

Pittsburgh cyclist Colin Albright was the victim of a bizarre outburst of road rage. On Sept. 7, a driver — whom Albright speculates he may have accidentally cut off in traffic — followed him by car, chased him on foot, and then sliced and stabbed him with a small hunting knife.
While this is a particularly violent example of the tensions between cyclists and drivers, it’s far from being the only dangerous interaction that’s happened in Pittsburgh. This summer, two cyclists were killed and another was critically injured by motorists, all of whom drove away from the crime scenes.
Given that Pittsburgh has plenty of college students and a less-than-robust public transportation system, the cyclist population is bound to keep growing. But the number of accidents will only increase if Pittsburgh doesn’t find a way to accommodate those who get around by bicycle.
Safety concerns aren’t the only reason why Pittsburgh should become more bicycle-friendly. For years, the American Lung Association has identified Pittsburgh as one of the most air-polluted cities in the country. One of the easiest ways to decrease the amount of air emissions would be to incentivize people to ride bicycles rather than drive to their destinations, and having designated bike lanes would make people feel more comfortable about cycling.
There have been some positive steps in the right direction: There are an increasing number of streets in Pittsburgh with designated bike lanes, and Pittsburgh’s Climate Action Plan, which was published in February, includes several cycle-centric ideas on how to make Pittsburgh a more bike-friendly city, such as creating more sheltered bicycle storage areas.
Carnegie Mellon has also been working to improve conditions for cyclists — the 2012 Master Plan includes a proposal to create bicycle lanes in front of campus on Forbes Avenue.
We hope that the city and Carnegie Mellon make these initiatives a priority in order to prevent more deadly incidents.

A cheating scandal at an esteemed academic institution is once again making headlines. One hundred and twenty-five Harvard University students were accused of cheating on a test for a class called Introduction to Congress last spring, according to a recent article in The New York Times. The exam was a take-home test, and the students were told that they could use any internet resources they wanted. However, they were told not to discuss the test with each other.
The students caught cheating face disciplinary action, such as year-long suspensions, and those who have already graduated could have their diplomas rescinded. Professors and students alike have expressed deep outrage at such fraudulent behavior, especially at a school like Harvard.
First off, the idea that cheating is somehow worse or more surprising because it’s at Harvard is completely absurd. Whether it occurs at Harvard, Carnegie Mellon, or Greendale Community College, cheating should be treated in the same manner. Cheating becomes even harder to handle when universities classify some forms of collaboration as cheating. The line between collaboration and cheating is hard to distinguish, mostly because collaboration can be helpful and sometimes the best way to learn. But the fact remains: The students were told not to talk to each other about the test. Even if their interactions were honest collaborations, they were cheating. 
In an ideal world, professors could hand out take-home tests and know that their students would not cheat; this would save class time for lectures instead of exams and preserve the integrity of the university. Universities should expect all of their students to live up to a standard of honesty, but that is unrealistic. Everybody cheats, and if they haven’t, they probably didn’t treat a class with as much consideration as it deserves.
I haven’t cheated on a test — except that one time in second grade when I totally tried to copy answers on a math test; sorry I forgot to mention it, Carnegie Mellon. But I have cut corners or come up with excuses that were artful pieces of fiction. It’s normal. That doesn’t mean it’s okay, but it does mean that students who are caught cheating aren’t automatically demons, to be cast out of our illustrious institutions with a complimentary public shaming.
Universities are in an interesting bind, especially when it comes to students who have already graduated, because the universities simultaneously lack power and have too much. A university can suspend a current student who is caught cheating or prohibit them from participating in activities, because it has immediate power.
Students who have already graduated are out of a university’s reach, for the most part — unless the university decides to take that all-important diploma back. This destroys a student’s ability to get a job or go to graduate school.
Yes, the cheating students made a mistake, but one mistake shouldn’t mess up the rest of their lives, especially considering that few of the students in question were accused of plagiarism, but rather of collaborative cheating. Both plagiarism and collaborative cheating break the rules, but the former demonstrates a complete lack of consideration for the class, while the latter can demonstrate an actual attempt to learn. No one really knows if the students involved were trying to collaborate, or just copying work from friends. But even if they were copying work, does that make it okay to wreck their chances of having a successful life after school?
Harvard is threatening to hang these students out to dry because publicly disciplining them serves the twofold purpose of purifying the school’s name and discouraging other students from trying a similar trick. But punishing students who get caught doesn’t mean that the university is free of cheating, because everyone has, more likely than not, done something morally questionable over the course of their academic careers. The school shouldn’t just let it go, but lambasting the students doesn’t cleanse dishonesty from an institution. Doing that would require a much deeper revamping of the way we look at school and the way we value hard work throughout the country.

The line for this year’s Technical Opportunities Conference (TOC) ran out the door, trailed along half of the University Center, crossed the Cut, and finally ended in front of Purnell. In other words, it was quite long.
And this was the line for people who had registered ahead of time. It stands to reason that, if the registered line was this long, the line for those who did not register ahead of time would be even longer — but the unregistered line was much shorter and faster.
The most visible benefit of registering was a preprinted name tag. We’re not sure how much weight future employers put on a snazzy name tag, but it seems that forgoing that luxury would have gotten students into the conference and making connections about 20 minutes earlier than their registered peers.
And with the 266 different companies that attended the TOC this year, there were a lot of connections to be made. So next year, if the process for registered students isn’t improved, we encourage students to flout convention and just show up at the conference unregistered.
Beside the name tag, registration allowed students to submit a digital copy of their résumé for recruiter review. Additionally, registered students were submitted in drawings for giveaway prizes. While the prizes seem fun, being able to submit your résumé is a valuable asset. However, being able to get into the career fair and meet face-to-face with recruiters can potentially be much more fruitful for your employment opportunities, and students shouldn’t have to risk that face time for added perks.
With so much going on during the week of TOC, and with registration currently providing little overall benefit to students, they should forgo the registration process in the future. Students are striving to network and make an impression in order to land that dream job, and registration currently hinders that.
Unless the registration process is revamped by the appropriate organizations in order to better serve the needs of these students, most people should skip it and focus on the rest of the career fair.

The rumors of educational television host Bill Nye’s death have spread quickly. But no, the Science Guy who made many of our childhoods better is still alive and kicking. Suspiciously, such rumors of his untimely demise began several days after a Big Think video featuring Nye was released online.
In this video, Nye expresses his concern that parents are forcing their children to learn unsound or scientifically dubious things such as creationism, which, as an educator, concerns him greatly.
Nye implores viewers to make sure kids develop the critical thinking skills necessary for not just STEM (science, technology, engineering, and mathematics) fields, but also for a generally better-informed populace. These wishes were met with derision from the creationist community, with multiple response videos appearing right around the same time as the death rumors.
Ken Ham, the president of Answers in Genesis and the Creation Museum, replied with perhaps the most aggressive attack, claiming that Nye was an engineer who shouldn’t be commenting on an area outside of his expertise. Ham made a distinction between “historical” and “observational” science, a distinction that I personally have never heard of.
Ham uses this distinction to reconcile the undeniable fact of natural selection with his beliefs in a 6,000-year-old earth and the implications therein.
Ham ultimately shows his own character by attacking Nye’s; Ham repeatedly refers to Nye not by his popular moniker, but as a “humanist guy.”
Now, as a humanist, I would find being called that not an insult, but rather a statement of fact. In Ham’s worldview, though, it is definitely bad. It represents someone who denies everything Ham affirms and affirms everything he denies.
The exchange between Ham and Nye is ongoing, with the creationist side challenging Nye to a formal debate. Most on the side of the skeptics seem to agree that such an endeavor would be fruitless, but we’ll see if Nye accepts the challenge. This incident speaks to a broader issue, though: namely that creationism seems to be in its death throes. When a beloved children’s educator and entertainer is no longer above attacks, one can tell there’s not much left for creationists.
Creationism is a self-destructive and self-defeating worldview because it tries to force a Bronze Age understanding of the world onto our modern understanding.
It attempts to reconcile irreconcilable differences to legitimize itself, but after this incident, it is clear to me that there is no way I can think of creationist theories as legitimate in any sense. I’ve observed that delusion of this level exists not only in the U.S. in fundamentalist Christianity, but also in religious fundamentalist sects throughout the world.
One can hope that as progress becomes ever-more inescapable and as modernity continues to wash away prejudices and preconceived notions, we as humans will be able to look back.
We will look back and realize that adopting the system with built-in self-correcting measures is always a safer bet than trying to fit a round peg in a square hole. I am confident that our generation will be the one that finally embraces science and secularism over tribalism and tradition.

Yahoo! Sports acquired and published a letter from Maryland politician Emmett C. Burns Jr. to Baltimore Ravens owner Steve Bisciotti on Sept. 6. The letter requested that Bisciotti prevent Ravens linebacker Brendon Ayanbadejo from further publicly supporting same-sex marriage, specifically a ballot initiative in Maryland to legalize it.
Burns requested Bisciotti to “take the necessary action, as a National Football Franchise owner, to inhibit such expressions from your employee....”
The audacity of the request has not gone unnoticed. It gained publicity thanks to an open letter to Burns from Minnesota Vikings punter Chris Kluwe, published by Deadspin.com.
The letter, despite being full of profanities and obscenities, demonstrates the flaws and inherent injustice that Burns suggests in restricting a U.S. citizen’s First Amendment rights.
However, Kluwe’s letter also changes the public face of American professional sports.
The perception of professional sports in the U.S. is one of entertainment, competition, and masculine bravado.
This traditional masculine persona often seems at odds with developing attitudes toward homosexuality and gender roles in America. While there has yet to be an openly gay athlete in the NFL, Kluwe’s letter is inspiring and indicative of how attitudes in the industry are changing.
Kluwe’s remarks foreshadow a time when “It Gets Better” videos and movements will no longer be necessary; when people are treated equally regardless of sexual orientation.
The fact that Burns’ letter attacked freedom of speech as well as the right to marriage shows how fear and intolerance are constantly at odds with these basic human rights. The U.S. was formed from the first principle, and now it is only a matter of time until it accepts the second.
Support, especially from those regarded as American role models like Ayanbadejo and Kluwe, will help move marriage equality toward greater acceptance.

Your hypothesis is correct. Rush through the test so that you can get to the conclusion and get out of the lab.
Don’t time your presentation. Life is short and you’re too busy to waste that kind of time.
Why look in that big book for the correct verb? The whole point of learning a language is to immerse yourself in the lives of others, and people make mistakes all the time.
You used the right equation, so don’t seek confirmation by looking in your notes. Move on to the next problem set.
Why look for bugs in your program? You have been working on it for the past five hours — what could possibly be wrong with your code?
Skip rehearsal — you’re dripping with natural talent. Rehearsal will just get in the way of sleep.
Trust me, the whole crew read every page of your packet and fully understands the play’s history. No need to sit and talk about dead people.
No need to double check; you know what you’re doing. I’m sure it’s level. Is there really such a thing as a straight line?
Add more yellow and then you’re done.
Just pick any thesis sentence; your argument will be fine.
Just pick a disorder and a friend, and fill in his or her behavior as you see fit. Trial tests and observations are for losers.
Don’t check that solution. The answer has to be zero.
