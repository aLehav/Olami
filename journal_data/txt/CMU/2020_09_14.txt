One of the biggest events in the film industry last week was the release of Mulan. Originally planned to release in theaters in March, Disney pushed the release date back due to the coronavirus pandemic. This movie was a live-action version of the original Mulan, also made by Disney, and Disney hoped to build on the original's success with this new version. However, this movie did not get off to a good start, despite the initial hype among both Chinese and Western viewers.
Mulan is based on an old Chinese fairy tale of a female warrior who wanted to save her old-aged father from compulsory military service by pretending to be a male and serving in the place of her father. The original fairy tale was a very touching story, and it was very well known in China, which meant that the movie was supposed to do great in the Chinese market. 
But Disney decided to botch the storyline of the movie by changing the movie from a touching personal story of Mulan saving her father into a John Wick-style action movie that was not at all representative of the original values behind the fairy tale. The fairy tale was supposed to celebrate Mulan’s will to save her father and her bravery in serving in an all-male military as a female, but Disney changed Mulan into an action superhero who could single-handedly save a country’s emperor, forgoing her family obligations. 
There were also unnecessary additions of characters into the movie, such as the witch who can apparently fly into cities and kill everyone inside before the troops even arrive. There is no witch in the original fairy tale, and it just added confusion for viewers, especially Chinese viewers who probably can recite the "Ballad of Mulan" verbatim, leaving a sour taste in the minds of the Chinese viewers.
Disney also hired the wrong costume and makeup designers. Costumes used in this movie were representative of the Tang Dynasty, which was more than 500 years later than the original time period of the Mulan story. The choices of props used were also questionable, with Mulan’s house following a typical style from southern China, despite the story taking place in northern China, a clear mismatch that should not have happened. These factors compounded made the movie unsavory for the Chinese audience, and this was shown in the poor reviews on Chinese movie-review sites.
With the unexpected failure in the Chinese market, Disney must hope that the Western market can become the saving grace of this movie, but that is becoming less likely. The lead actor of the movie, Liu Yifei, was embroiled in controversies in 2019 after she made a statement on social media supporting the Hong Kong Police, who were cracking down on Hong Kong democracy protests during that time. Another actor, Donnie Yen, was also accused of being pro-police and pro-Beijing by Western activists. These led to a boycott movement in 2019, and it was refreshed by activists in several countries/regions, including Taiwan, Hong Kong, and Thailand, where netizens together formed an alliance called the Milk Tea Alliance, boycotting the movie. The deteriorating relationship between China and the United States also did not help the movie succeed. 
However, there might be some saving grace for Disney and Mulan, as the viewership count on Disney+ for this movie was high, and there were some positive reviews coming out from critics, mainly praising Liu Yifei’s superior acting skills, as well as Disney’s efforts in making Chinese culture more approachable to the average Westerner.
The movie was plagued by its botched attempts to please the Chinese audience, while still offending some Western viewers. The timing of this movie could not have been worse, with rising tensions between China and the United States and a growing anti-Chinese sentiment in the States. Despite these setbacks, the movie still received high viewership and some positive reviews, but this movie will not be the best movie of 2020. Instead, at least for me, it would be something I would watch if I am on a plane with no other options.

Despite the odds stacked against it, I would like to congratulate Tenet for becoming the savior of entertainment in 2020. Having made $152 million worldwide so far on a budget of $225 million, it’s certainly the best case scenario for the 2020 movie experience. Christopher Nolan has expressed how much he would like to give up his life to saving film and preserving the theater experience, and it’s clear he would like us to give up our lives, too.
They say art is a reflection of the time it’s made in. In our confusing and unprecedented times, Tenet strives to give you an experience reflective of just that. Nolan’s brilliant writing also offers another feature of our 2020 pandemic time: not caring at all about anyone or anything because of how confused and overwhelmed we are by what’s going on.
The more I’m thinking about this, the more I’m starting to realize that Nolan must have invented time travel. There is simply no way that a movie’s plot can be so confusing yet feel so prescient for our times other than if he inverted time back to make this movie. After all, he was very insistent on releasing the movie during this pandemic despite all odds.
Wait, I get it.
Maybe World War III is finally going to happen later this year and Nolan gave us the key to stopping it with this movie. That’s what the puzzle box in this movie is about. Guys, he’s given us the key to stopping the next war, and it’s up to us to crack the film’s plot and physics so that we can understand what to do.
I’ve looked through dozens of articles online now trying to make sense of it all, but it seems like we’re all at our wit’s end. Nolan believes in us to understand him, and we can’t let him down. The man is too smart for us all, and despite impossible expectations, we must live up to them. If he has to live up to those expectations, why don’t we?
Mr. Nolan, I don’t know if you’re reading this or if you already have read this, but know that I will do all I can to understand your art. It keeps me up at night, knowing that a man so powerful like you is, was, or will be out there. Your art is the key to our lives. We are not worthy of you, and if we succeed, you will become a god for all of time.

The imposter syndrome monster is an old, grimy beast sitting frightfully atop Carnegie Mellon’s picturesque campus. He creepily laughs as he mocks the students from above, traveling from dorm to dorm until his fury has been unleashed onto the unsuspecting masses. He sends chills down the spines of upperclassmen; even before he visits them, they are anxiously awaiting his return. However, the monster’s favorite meal — the fresh meat of first-year students — is arriving soon.
He licks his cold-blooded lips and garners up his appetite, gazing from the shadows as innocent freshmen attend their first classes, begin studying for exams, and turn in summer assignments. The ruthless monster makes the students doubt their accomplishments and question their ability to succeed. Once the monster has bitten the students, they begin to contract imposter syndrome. Some first-years have met the monster before, but others have not. Knowing they are not immune to the monster’s presence, the students are determined to find a way to defeat him.
On a cold and mysterious night, the monster creeps up on Mudge, an old mansion at the intersection of Fifth and Morewood Avenue. The outdoor sign reads “abandon all hope ye who enter here.” Intrigued and feeling rebellious, he steps inside and begins looking for students to scare. Instead, the monster finds a ghost town. The hallways are all empty, the rooms are filled to the brim with cockroaches, and the eerie noises coming from upstairs are enough to make the monster recede back to his hiding place… for now.
The next night he travels to Stever. The monster is relieved when he notices the lights  on in many of the rooms, and students have gathered with masks downstairs. Instead of attacking at first sight, he feasts his eyes on the cacti during Orientation Week. He takes notes on the students’ weaknesses as they each introduce themselves, their majors, and their goals for the upcoming year. After interviewing Stever resident and economics major Chris Angelov about his interaction with the monster, he has come to describe the beast as “stressful and pressuring.” An anonymous computer science student explains that the monster visited her as soon as she got accepted to Carnegie Mellon, explaining “[she] legitimately thought that someone had made a mistake, that [she] couldn’t possibly have gotten in.”
Feeling successful with last night’s adventure, the imposter syndrome monster moves on to E-Tower, Donner, Resnik, and Hamerschlag, slowly exerting his dominance as he progresses. He thrives off human fear, so he makes sure to avoid the dorms where he can not see people from above. He usually attacks students in the classroom, but this year, the monster has gained the unique ability to scare his students from their own webcams. Business administration first-year student Erika Heffernen explains that the monster first visited her “sitting in [her] classes and listening to people talk.”
By the end of the first week of classes, everyone knew who the imposter syndrome monster was. They feared him and began to take precautions to prevent the monster’s inevitable wrath. When asked how he defeated the imposter syndrome monster, business and human-computer interaction major Yann Thomas, a junior, answered, “the key was finding pride in [his] own intelligence.” 
The imposter syndrome monster slowly weakens as the students learn how to survive despite the monster’s overwhelming presence. He slowly loses power as the freshman join study groups and support services. He begins to crumble as he watches students learn to succeed. The monster will never fully disappear, but he has become beatable. Saddened and defeated, the imposter syndrome monster returns to the shadows of darkness and recharges, thrilled to meet next year’s group of incoming freshmen and potential victims.
And so, the cycle inevitably and perpetually continues.

Professors from across the nation and here at Carnegie Mellon took part in the #ScholarStrike this week, a two-day protest on Sept. 8 and 9 in which some members of academia halted their regular duties to reflect and engage in discussions about racial injustice in America. 
The strike was sparked by several events. In Kenosha, WI, Jacob Blake, a Black man, was shot seven times in the back by a police officer while his children watched. At a protest resulting from this shooting, Kyle Rittenhouse, a white teenager, was allowed to walk past police, gun in hand, after he allegedly shot three protesters. Protests also followed the events in Kenosha from members of the Women’s National Basketball Association (WNBA) and the National Basketball Association (NBA), who refused to play in protest of continued police violence against unarmed Black people. The nationwide scholar strike was initiated by a single tweet that followed these events. 
Anthea Butler, University of Pennsylvania associate professor of religious studies and Africana studies tweeted: “I would be down as a professor to follow the NBA and Strike for a few days to protest police violence in America.” 
Hours later, #ScholarStrike was born. Butler and co-organizer Kevin Gannon, a historian and director of the Center for Excellence in Teaching and Learning at Grand View University said in their mission statement that it is of “crucial importance for those of us in higher education to take a stand in solidarity with our students and the communities we serve...We believe it is a long past time for us to make a collective stand against police violence.”
John Oddo, associate professor of english at Carnegie Mellon, was one of many professors who decided to cancel his classes and meetings on Tuesday and Wednesday as a part of the Scholar Strike. 
“I realize this is an inconvenience. And that's part of the point,” Oddo said. “It needs to be a disruption if it's going to have any symbolic power and try to draw attention to what a modest disruption this is in comparison to the massive injustice of having to live with the weight of white supremacy on your back.” 
Although the Scholar Strike encourages able professors and administrators to step back from their usual roles, the movement also encourages professors to engage in a nation-wide teach-in, one that mimics those used to protest the Vietnam War in 1965. 
Other professors, such as Marian Aguiar, associate professor of English, chose to continue class but focus the days’ material on racial injustice. Aguiar had students research on the lives of Black women who are killed by police violence. 
“It was kind of a way of validating their histories and witnessing what happened to them in the classroom,” Aguiar said. “I'm trying to understand both what happened to them publicly and acknowledge that violence inside our classroom, but also to think about the lives, or what we could find out about their lives, that they lived before that.” 
The African American Communication and Culture Division and the Black Caucus Division of the National Communication Association hosted a virtual #ScholarStrike conference, streamed on Youtube and Facebook, in which they invited professors to submit 10-minute videos about social justice, race, anti-racism, police brutality, white supremacy, etc. 
“We often get the reputation of an ivory tower, above the outside world.” Aguiar said. “But I don't think that's true. I think there's racism around us everywhere and at university and beyond. We have to connect both what we're doing and also what we're looking at, between the space inside academia and outside.” 
Stephen Wittek, assistant professor of English, canceled class during the strike. He stated via email that by joining the strike, he aims to affirm the importance of people of color and emphasize how the injustice they face is unacceptable. 
“I hope the strike will draw attention to the connection between the recent spike in violent incidents and the long, ongoing legacy of white supremacy and exploitation,” Wittek wrote in an email. “Scholars, especially white male scholars such as myself, are direct beneficiaries of that legacy, and we have a responsibility to try to make things better,” he said.
Oddo also hopes that looking forward, he and other professors will write with the intention to help solve current social issues, keeping the audience of non-scholars in mind. “We need to find ways to connect with people outside of the university who are often the ones who are leading a sort of moral charge for justice, and making sure that our work works with them, and not just for us,” he said. “And when you're in this sort of global circumstance, I think it becomes even more imperative to think, ‘what does your research do in relation to these massive problems?’”
The aim of many of these professors is to continue the intention behind the strike. One way to do so includes continuing the discussion and awareness of the matter while simultaneously looking internally and working to fight racism on campus. 
“I would also like to see more concrete steps taken to address the climate of white supremacy on the Carnegie Mellon campus,” Wittek wrote.“I often hear that People of Color—students and faculty alike—do not feel particularly welcome or comfortable here, and that troubles me a great deal.”

For a first-year student, joining a student organization can be an easy way to meet new people and make some friends, especially when students are spread throughout the globe due to the online-optional nature of this semester. Because many students are not able to travel to campus and social gatherings are limited, many clubs have turned to online calls to assist them in their recruiting efforts.
In previous years, organizations would have the opportunity to recruit new members through The FAIR, an event that Student Leadership, Involvement, and Civic Engagement (SLICE) organizes every year. Student organizations would set up tables on The Cut, and students would visit them to learn more about the organizations. To host this event for all students, regardless of their location, The FAIR moved to an online space, marking the first virtual FAIR.
The virtual FAIR utilized the website GatherTown, a platform two Carnegie Mellon alumni helped develop, which allows users to create a character and walk around in virtual space, interacting with other people around them. For this event, students could explore a virtual copy of Carnegie Mellon’s campus, where 200 organizations had spots set up around the map so those interested in an organization could interact with them. If the student stood on one of the white stickers in front of an organization’s table, they would be able to sign up for that organization's mailing list.
“We expected the virtual FAIR to have at least 1,000 people in attendance at any given time. There were 200 organizations registered, and they were allowed two representatives per table, which would equal 400 students alone,” Coordinator of SLICE Andrew Greenwald told The Tartan. “The two-person tabling limit is the same restriction we have in place when the FAIR is inside the Cohon Center, as we watch capacity limits.”
When students entered the virtual FAIR at 5:30 p.m., they were met with a “500 Internal Service Error” or white screens that weren’t loading. If students managed to enter the room where the event was happening, it was rare for them to be able to move or interact with anything on their screen. The chat feature, however, did still work, so organizations posted links to Zoom calls or information for their respective organizations.
“We had concerns going into the virtual FAIR, however, GatherTown has successfully held events significantly larger than the virtual FAIR, so our concerns were mainly focused on internal logistics,” Greenwald said. “We had training sessions for SLICE staff to act as moderators and our last test/training a few hours before the FAIR all looked well, and to be honest, we were excited to showcase the work of some of our very own Tartans,” he said.
At one point, attendees joined the room to a warning on their screen, saying, “Room Limits Exceeded!,” as there were only 500 spots available in the room and more than 550 people trying to attend the virtual event.
SLICE ended up communicating that due to technical difficulties with GatherTown, the virtual FAIR will be postponed. They also asked organizations who were hosting Zoom meetings due to the GatherTown malfunction to post their links on The Bridge so interested students would still be able to learn more about them.
“We are very proud of our student leaders/organizations who smoothly managed to pivot the night of the virtual FAIR to alternative platforms,” Greenwald said, “Student organizations quickly created Zoom info sessions, posting them on social media interacting with the @SLICEatCMU Instagram, and also on The Bridge, which I have never seen as full of events before.” 
After many students left GatherTown for other platforms, or because they were getting frustrated with the platform, some of the technical issues were resolved and students who were left were able to meet with some of the organizations that still had members on GatherTown and were able to watch some of the organizations’ videos.
SLICE will hold another virtual FAIR on Sept. 30th from 5:30-7:30 p.m., the same time that it was previously scheduled for. SLICE will invite registered organizations into GatherTown the day before the virtual FAIR so that they will have time to explore the platform. For the organizations that were registered for the previous event, more information will be emailed to them. 
As SLICE plans to hold the rescheduled virtual FAIR on the same platform that had many technical problems for students, some may be less willing to use it to attend the rescheduled virtual FAIR. SLICE has had an extensive debriefing with the technical team at GatherTown, where the issues that were encountered with the event have been addressed and are unlikely to happen again. “We have tested GatherTown with many different community members and everyone who has participated believes there is undeniable value: it creatively addresses many of the communication difficulties with video calls in a way that no other platform has managed. We believe that value is so great, that it warrants a second chance for our Tartan family,” Greenwald said. “We will continue to work with GatherTown and act as a liaison for organization and departments on campus considering GatherTown as a platform.”

Mayor Bill Peduto was elected the 60th Mayor of Pittsburgh on November 5, 2013, and has served since January of 2014, elected to a second mayoral term in 2017. Previous to being Mayor, Peduto worked for the Pittsburgh City Council for 19 years, where he worked on “the most comprehensive package of government reform legislation in Pittsburgh’s history. He strengthened the Ethics Code, created the city’s first Campaign Finance Limits, established Lobbyist Disclosure and Lobbyist Registration, and ended No-Bid Contracts.” 
According to his profile on Pittsburgh’s official .gov address, “The Peduto administration is committed to modernizing city government and implementing leading practices to provide taxpayers with an efficient, effective, transparent, and a more accountable government.” 
Peduto has made some significant infrastructure improvements during his tenure as Mayor, facing criticism for his support of bike infrastructure. He was given the nickname “Bike Lane Billy” by critics of increased funding for bike lanes and other infrastructure improvements, which does not seem to have affected his zeal for improving the state of Pittsburgh’s bike lane network. Peduto has also kept Pittsburgh in the Paris Climate Accords, has joined the UN’s Compact of Mayors committed to fighting climate change, and, according to his profile, “is working to ensure that everyone benefits from Pittsburgh’s transformation and growth because ‘If it’s not for all, it’s not for us.’”
Why, then, does the Mayor hate protesters? Since the murder of George Floyd on May 31 of this year, Pittsburgh Police have arrested dozens of protesters and organizers, for heinous crimes like spray painting buildings, or being present when the police decide to shoot everyone in the face with rubber bullets and tear gas. Several organizers have been charged with felony riot charges, while the Pittsburgh Police Department, which faces multiple class action lawsuits from protesters in connection to their violent crackdowns on peaceful protests.
Meanwhile, the police have continued to escalate, with plainclothes officers armed with assault rifles kidnapping a marshall at a recent protest in Oakland. This kidnapping, similar to arrests made in Portland and New York City, sparked a tweet from Mayor Peduto, who said that it made him “very uncomfortable.” Peduto and police officials later held a press conference where, according to the Post-Gazette, “They spent much of the conference saying some organizers of Black Lives Matter protests have become increasingly antagonistic, refusing to tell police their planned routes and blocking traffic on their own, leading to what police say are unsafe situations.”
In response to a protester being kidnapped, marches were organized to the Mayor’s house in Point Breeze and the nearby Mellon Park over the next three days, and resulted in police declaring the protests an “unlawful assembly” and forcibly removing (peaceful) protesters. 
Rather than working with the protesters, listening to their demands, and doing everything he can to support the Black community in Pittsburgh, Peduto has preferred to complain about the disruptions to his afternoons, saying that “Using protests to create conflict and division, as some are doing, only impacts the ability of others to exercise their constitutional rights safely.” Curiously, the Pittsburgh Police don’t seem to care about whether protests are peaceful to begin shooting rubber bullets and tear gas at protesters, so the Mayor’s statement reads as more of a threat: either don’t create ‘division’, an impossible task when it comes to effectively protesting (either there is division in society that necessitates a protest against it or there is not), or there will be no protests allowed at all. The Mayor wants everyone to sit quietly and ask, with hat in hand, whether he could please defund the violent street gang protecting the private property of the wealthy, if it isn’t too much trouble. 
Rather than responding to the demands of the protesters, Peduto has stepped up his Twitter activity, with one tweet from Sept. 6 reading “Politics 101. Have the Alt-Left attack Democrats & the Alt-Right support their efforts.” This tweet seems to imply a coordinated political strategy of discrediting Democratic politicians from the ‘alt-right’, a fringe group of Nazis and white supremacists, and the ‘alt-left’, a fictitious categorization used by President Trump to excuse the Nazi murder of left activist Heather Heyer at the 2017 “Unite the Right” rally in Charlottesville. This comparison is an especially egregious one given that a member of the ‘alt-right’ was responsible for the Tree of Life shooting in 2017, making the Mayor’s attempts to conflate protestors speaking up against police brutality with white supremacists all the more disgusting.
The question is, why is the Mayor more interested in denigrating and defaming the activists seeking to change a system that disproportionately murders and oppresses Black people than in listening to and instituting the changes called for by those activists? The police are a gang, the police commit murder and get away with it, and the police must be abolished before they decide it’s really them, and not the people of Pittsburgh, who run this city. We need a Mayor who understands that the people are the State, not the police. Our streets.

Now that we’re a few weeks into the university being reopened and have read through an endless barrage of emails from the administration, I think I can comfortably say that the university’s reopening plan isn't a success like they wanted it to be. There’s a pretty good chance that the university will shut down within a short time period as cases rise, and the efforts will have been for nothing.
The reopening plans were riddled with issues from the start. Testing procedures weren’t properly established until students began arriving on campus, and the asymptomatic testing plans that did get announced aren’t very promising. Given the random incubation period of the virus, the university should be requiring all students to be tested at least once a week. Instead, the current plan hinges on random sampling of students to monitor the situation, and the tests themselves take 3-5 days to return results. It’s a dangerous ploy, and could very well lead to the virus spreading unknowingly and becoming a danger for the surrounding, non-student community.
With the return to campus comes the inevitable issues with students wanting to maintain some semblance of a normal social life during a pandemic. It’s easy to blame students for making dense decisions, but it’s even more naive for the university to reopen under an assumption that students will adhere to all the proper pandemic guidelines. It’s also hypocritical for the university to want to attempt to maintain some sense of normalcy through their actions and not expect students to want to do the same. There’s no good way to enforce these guidelines, and trying to scare students with suspensions without refunds is cruel and unfair.
The university’s attempts to provide a college experience during a pandemic are not helping the student life situation either. The recent attempt to host a large virtual gathering for the Activities Fair wasn’t successful, and virtual social events aren’t proving themselves to be adequate alternatives for students. The added insult to injury is that the university is charging full tuition for a partial campus experience.
The administration is announcing all these plans and making all these measures to ensure that things can go smoothly during a pandemic. However, there is nothing smooth about this at all. Why are we trying to put lipstick on a pig and call it a day? The email they sent out after testing started said that “only .44%” of the test results so far had come back positive. They shouldn’t be looking at it as “only these many people tested positive.” They should be going “oh god these people have tested positive and there are going to be many more.” It would certainly give students a more realistic view of the situation at hand.
Of all the university responses, Carnegie Mellon’s isn’t the worst. The University of Alabama has well over 2,000 cases, and Cornell resident assistants went on strike over unsafe working conditions in late August. That being said, every university with a plan to reopen the campus has it completely wrong, and it's just a microcosm of everything wrong with the handling of the pandemic in this country.
For starters, we didn’t and still don’t have the infrastructure, be it healthcare, government assistance, or anything else, to actually handle disasters. On top of that, we vehemently oppose doing that for various reasons ranging from corporate influence to willful ignorance to misguided notions of freedom and “government overreach.” Congress still hasn’t passed a second coronavirus stimulus package, and many eviction moratoriums, including in Pennsylvania, have expired. We are also likely heading into the worst economic and housing crisis in a very long time, once the CDC repeals its moratorium.
In any real country, we would have free testing in a universal healthcare system, some system to cover workers’ paychecks and/or universal income, rent cancellations, and subsidies for education so that they don’t proceed with harebrained reopening plans just to make money. But this is America, which is now the husk of a parody. We are so incompetent that we have conditioned ourselves to believe that healthcare and “essential” workers are heroes sacrificing themselves for our capitalist economy and societal “normalcy.” Now we are willing to sacrifice professors, teachers, and students for the same reason with schools reopening.
I don’t know if I am angry at Carnegie Mellon or our massively broken system or both. Maybe I expected the university to do better than everyone else considering the resources we have. But in the end, the university is just a reflection of a broken country: incapable of real action, especially during a disaster, a machine that would rather pretend things can be normal for the benefit of the free-market death cultists who run it.
