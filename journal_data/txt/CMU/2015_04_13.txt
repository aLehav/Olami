The Eastern College Athletic Conference (ECAC) awarded Carnegie Mellon athletes for achievements both on the basketball court and the golf course this month. Among those awarded were sophomore forward Jack Serbin on the men’s basketball team, first-year Summer Kitahara on the women’s golf team, and sophomore George Qian on the men’s golf team.
Jack Serbin
The ECAC named Serbin to its Division III Men’s South Basketball All-Star Second Team, coming on the heels of an announcement that he was also named to the University Athletic Association (UAA) Second Team.
Serbin ranked fifth in the UAA in blocked shots, with 73 total, according to a university news release. He achieved a career best of seven blocked shots against the Penn State Beavers this season. In all but one game this season, Serbin scored double-digit points. Out of the 24 double-digit games, he scored more than 20 points in eight of them. During one of those games, against New York University, Serbin shot a career-high 31 points.
Serbin is the first university athlete to receive postseason honors from the ECAC since Ryan Einwag (TSB, ’09), the second-leading scorer in the university’s history, who is now an equity derivatives trader at IMC Financial Markets, according to his LinkedIn profile.
Overall, the men’s basketball team went 14–11 this season, winning nine of their games at home.
Summer Kitahara
The ECAC named Kitahara Women’s Rookie Golfer of the Month for Division III after she placed fifth with a score of 161 overall at the Inaugural UAA Women’s Golf Championship in Sorrento, Fla., earning her All-UAA first-team honors, according to a university news release.
She later shot 242 for three rounds at the 2015 Jekyll Island Collegiate Invitational at Jekyll Island, Ga., bringing her average for all five rounds between the championship and invitational to 80.6. Through 12 rounds this year, she has averaged a score of 80.7, according to the university’s athletics website.
Carnegie Mellon placed first on Saturday with a team score of 370 at the Westminster Spring Invitational. Kitahara led the team with a score of 82.
George Qian
Qian was named Men’s Golfer of the Month by the ECAC for Division III sports after claiming the UAA individual medalist honor at the UAA Championships in Sorrento, Fla. last month. He scored two rounds of 74 at the tournament. At the Jekyll Island Collegiate Invitational, he scored 223 between three rounds.
Qian came in at an average score of 74.2 for all five rounds between both events. Through 14 rounds this year, Qian has an average score of 74.6, according to the university’s athletics website.
Carnegie Mellon placed first on Sunday at the Edward Jones Shootout in Apollo, Pa with a combined score of 295. Qian placed second in the entire event and first on the team with a total score of 71.

The Carnegie Mellon Women’s Soccer team had an especially strong season with important contributions from all their players. However, the influence of one midfielder in particular served as part of the teams’s driving force when getting the ball into the opponent’s net. Carson Quiros is a junior professional writing and creative writing double major who plays central midfield for the Tartans. She put together a phenomenal season, starting in 18 games and notching 9 shots on goal, 2 of which got past the keeper to make game-winning goals.
Her performances earned her a spot on the All-University Athletic Association (UAA) Second Team and the National Soccer Coaches Association of America All-Scholar All-Region Third Team. Despite all of that, her importance on the field cannot be expressed in numbers, owing to the fact that she serves not only as a strong defensive player but also a facilitator and motivator to unleashing the full potential of the teammates around her. Behind every great player lies a remarkable story, and Quiros’ story confirms that.
The youngest of four siblings, Quiros started off playing soccer at the tender age of 3. She credits her parents for giving her the opportunity by putting all four siblings in recreational sports. Quiros’ talent and skill in the sport were noticed early as she made the club’s A-team in the fifth grade. Her commitment to the sport only increased from there on out as she narrowed down her sports to just basketball and soccer, dropping softball and gymnastics.
In spite of her overwhelming dedication to soccer, Quiros presented great athletic potential and was part of her school’s varsity basketball team alongside being part of the school’s varsity soccer team and her club’s soccer team. Her brilliance as part of her club, Top Hat (an all-girls club in Atlanta), attracted the attention of Carnegie Mellon Head Coach Yon Struble. Ever since she was recruited by Struble, Quiros has developed a strong relationship with the coach that has helped her expand on her potential and grow as a player by capitalizing on skills that she already had while also cultivating new ones. Quiros’ formidable understanding of the game stems greatly from the fact that, over the years, she has played in positions ranging from a defender to a forward, eventually settling down as a central midfielder.
When asked about the team’s fantastic performance this season, Quiros credited it to the extensive amount of preparation that the team goes through during their preseason and the summer, which makes the regular season more manageable. She also acknowledged that the team used their speed and their technical knowledge to dominate its games. Following a disappointing season last year, Quiros said that the team didn’t build expectations for this season and focused on playing their best every game while still staying humble.
The difference was definitely visible; the team came out swinging this season and won some spectacular games against challenging opponents. On a personal note, Quiros felt that she could get into the box and finish headers from crosses as well as use her ability to get into positions where she could use her long shot capabilities. Quiros feels that for the upcoming season, one of the things that could help the team advance even further is developing the same chemistry with the incoming first-years as they did this season. Quiros also feels that the team needs to focus on winning games that they dominate throughout the 90 minutes and avoiding slip-away games. On a personal note, Quiros feels that she needs to lead the midfield more and be more prominent offensively.
Quiros has had some great motivation and support from within the team. During Quiros’ first year, she was nurtured in her position by ex-captain Stephanie Hare. This complemented Coach Struble’s attempts to introduce a more offensive mindset into Quiros’ play. Quiros also cultivated a great relationship with classmate Alli McGugan, a junior business administration and decision science double major who plays forward for Carnegie Mellon. Currently roommates, the girls are there for each other on the field and off, constantly supporting and driving each other.
Quiros is at Carnegie Mellon for a lot more than its soccer program. Having first looked at a number of Ivy League schools, Quiros disliked that all of them had athletes seen as less academically-minded than everyone else. 
When she visited Pittsburgh, she realized that while every other school she had visited possessed some flaw either in lifestyle or in educational programs, the combination of Carnegie Mellon and Pittsburgh proved to be a perfect match. 
She was attracted to the strong writing program and its specificity in individual fields. During her time at Carnegie Mellon, Quiros has been especially impressed that all its students perform at such a high level over a wide variety of fields, which she says can be pressuring but exciting.
There are days when academic or other woes put you off your game, and Quiros appreciates that the coaches are very understanding of that. She appreciates that practices provide a place to hone skills, a great outlet, and a place to meet and connect with diverse groups of girls across majors and grades all of whom, on some level, share similar experiences and interests.
It is a rare occasion to come across a player so well-rounded both on the field and off of it, and especially humbling to see such a player continue to want to grow and expand her skill set. 
Indeed, it is this that sets Quiros apart from most other athletes and give her the markings of a leader. Given her dedication and that of the team, there is great reason to be excited about the Tartan’s next season.

As the English Premier League season draws to a close, there’s not much left for the top teams to play for. Chelsea is out of the Champions League, out of the FA Cup, has already won the Capitol One Cup (or League Cup) and leads the table comfortably right now. However, the race to finish in the top four of the league and qualify for next year’s Champions League is still very much on and there are several clubs still involved in it. Let’s look at the form and fixtures for each of these clubs and predict how this race will finish.
Arsenal
For a change, Arsenal is not the club on the outside looking in, waiting to pounce on the mistakes of others. Instead, they are currently the form team of the league and have won their last eight games on the trot, including last week’s impressive 4–1 rout of fellow challengers Liverpool. They sit pretty in second with a lot of momentum behind them and an outside chance of catching Chelsea for the title too. With ten points separating them and fifth-placed Southampton, they are in a rather comfortable position now, and should not have any trouble finishing second or even third. Lose both the crucial games against Chelsea at the Emirates and Manchester United at Old Trafford, though, and it could become a dogfight to finish fourth.
Prediction: Second. Despite history suggesting otherwise, on current form it’s hard to bet against Arsenal against both Chelsea and United.
Manchester United
Manchester United’s entire season prior to the game against Tottenham Hotspurs in March could have been summed up in one phrase — decent results, dour play. Louis van Gaal was brought to the club not only to get the results but also to improve the style of play which had become unbearable to watch under David Moyes. For the most part, van Gaal got the results right, but there were too many games when it seemed as if United was simply laboring through games for wins or just benefiting from the poor form of their rivals. The game against Spurs changed that, though; United displayed a swashbuckling style to their game not seen before this season. That impressive form continued into their crucial next game against Liverpool, in which United beat their arch-rivals at Anfield and showed off some of their most exhilarating football. With six points separating them and Southampton now, United are far from comfortable in third. Their inconsistency has hampered them before but as winners of five straight they are in a good position to finish amongst the Champions League places.
Prediction: Third. They have three tough games: Man City, Chelsea, and Arsenal. If they win all three, they’re in pole position for second and could even be in with a chance of the title. They haven’t been consistent enough all season, however, for anything to suggest they will win the aforementioned games.
Manchester City
Coming into the new year, City had briefly cut the gap at the top of the table and looked in prime position to improve their form and take the title away from the leaders, exactly like last season. However, 2015 has not been kind to the blue half of Manchester, as they have lost four times and drawn thrice since the turn of the year. This in addition to the knockouts from the FA Cup (by lowly Middlesborough) and the Champions League (by Barcelona) means they have had a miserable 3 months and are showing no signs of stopping the rut. They lost away to Crystal Palace last weekend, which dropped them into fourth below their neighbors Manchester United, who go into their clash on Sunday as favorites for the three points. This, coupled with the Southampton and Liverpool both only 5 and 6 points behind, respectively, means City must get their act together soon or risk being out of the Champions League next season.
Prediction: Fifth. They are very likely to lose the game against United, and while their fixtures get easier from there, their inconsistency and the age of their squad will show up and a young and hungry side will pass them.
Liverpool
Brendan Rodgers was being praised as a genius for turning around Liverpool’s fortunes. Top four seemed like a dream that could be achieved. This was all before the game against Manchester United, where Liverpool came crashing down to Earth. That loss, 2–1 at home, completely demoralized this team and was a huge setback for a club that had taken giant strides into becoming a force again last season. Arsenal seemed to have put the final nail in the coffin with a rout last week before Man City did them a favor and lost their game too. They beat Blackburn at Edwood Park to stay in the FA Cup and gained a little momentum back. Rodgers is a good manager; he seems to have learned from his mistakes last season, and their easy remaining fixtures mean that they have a good chance to leapfrog a free-falling Manchester City into fourth.
Prediction: Fourth. Yes, it’s a stretch to suggest they have the mettle to do it. But if they do not drop easy points and if City continue their free-fall, which seems likely, there’s a high chance this could be the outcome.
Southampton and Tottenham Hotspurs
These are two clubs that are both on the outside of this race, but still have a chance of finishing there — huge credit to Southampton for being only 5 points off fourth at this stage of the season after the fire sale they went through over the summer. Spurs should arguably be doing better with all the money they have spent over the last few seasons, but with a new manager, Mauricio Pochettino, in place and players like Harry Kane, who has been the breakout star of the season, Ryan Mason and Nabil Bentaleb getting their first full season of top-flight football under their belt, they are in a good position going forward. Neither club is likely to finish fourth or even fifth, but there is still one Europa League spot to fight for.
Prediction: Southampton — sixth. They are currently in good form with the best defensive record in the division. A safe bet to not drop enough points to lose position. Spurs — seventh. Their loss to Aston Villa at home this weekend ruined their chances of fighting for top four, and with players burning out at this stage, it’s unlikely they will beat Southampton into sixth.

Women’s Golf
On Saturday, the Carnegie Mellon women’s golf team competed in the Westminster Spring Invitational. The Tartans won the event with a team score of 370 in the 18 -hole event.
The team of first-years was led by Summer Kitahara, who placed second overall individually, shooting an 82. Robin Tan and Emma Hoskins finished second and third for Carnegie Mellon, 10th and 11th overall, shooting a 93 and 94 respectively. The Tartans will next compete Tuesday at the Saint Vincent Spring Invitational.
Men’s Tennis
The 10th-ranked Carnegie Mellon men’s tennis team played a home match against 18th-ranked University of Mary Washington on Saturday.
The Tartans jumped out to the early lead with a 3–0 sweep of doubles. Sophomore Kenny Zhang and first year Edward Ang, along with the team of senior Bryce Beisswanger and junior Yuvraj Kumar, won their matches easily, 8–4 and 8–5, respectively. Seniors Will Duncan and Christian Heaney-Secord fought hard from the number 1 doubles spot and pulled out the 9–7 victory.
Spotting an early lead from doubles play, the Tartans cruised to victory by splitting the singles matches. Heaney-Secord, sophomore Kunal Wadwani, and junior Abhishek Alla each won in straight sets with Heaney-Secord and Wadwani each winning 6–1, 6–4 and Alla winning 6–4, 6–4.
Carnegie Mellon also hosted 11th-ranked Johns Hopkins on Sunday.
Track and Field
The Carnegie Mellon men’s and women’s track teams split up this weekend with the distance runner competing in the Bucknell Distance Carnival.
At Bucknell, the Tartans faced off against the top distance completion in the country. Six women set career bests with seniors Erin Kiekhaefer and Sara Kelly each running the 1,500-meter run. Kiekhaefer competed in the top invitational field and finished 23rd with a personal best time of 4:39.89, and Kelly competed in the unseeded field, placing 2nd in her heat and 22nd overall with her career-best time of 4:52.78.
The other four career bests came in the 5000-meter run with junior Sophie Lohmann placing 11th overall, fellow junior Rekha Schnepf finishing 19th, sophomore Zofia Tillman placing 26th and junior Kira Ragazzo finishing 37th with times of 18:04.81, 18:25.43,18:32.00,and 18:52.93, respectively.
For the men, sophomore Owen Norley had a career best in the 1,500-meter run, placing third in the unseeded field with a time of 3:55.62. In the 5000-meter run, another group of Tartans earned career bests with sophomore Ryan Archer placing 4th, first year Ryan Auld finishing 17th, junior Brian Bollens placing 22nd, and senior Eamon Cullinane finishing 27th in the unseeded field with times of 14:51.68, 15:03.52, 15:05.00 and 15:06.47, respectively.
Rounding out the day for the Tartans was senior George Degen, who set a school record in the 10,000-meter with a time of 30:13.03, placing seventh in the invitation heat.
The other parts of the two Carnegie Mellon squads competed in the Westminster College Invitational, but results are not yet available at the time of print.
The Tartans will compete as full teams again on Saturday at the Slippery Rock Invitational.

Imagine having to describe the world you live in using only images of landmarks. If you could only choose ten, what would you pick? A sentimental feature of your hometown? A historic relic? A fading natural landmark? Over the years, a myriad of historians and individuals have recorded their own interpretations of the world they live in, providing future generations with a brief glimpse into the past through the eyes of another. But is there a way to merge these unique studies into a universal perspective of our world? William Alba, the director of the Science and Humanities Scholars Program at Carnegie Mellon University, has been working towards this goal with a project called Earth Tapestry.
The Earth Tapestry project aims to determine the most important landmarks on Earth, both natural and manmade. Once this information has been collected, it will be archived on the moon, in the hope that one day it will provide individuals with an understanding of the Earth as it was in previous eras. “The way we’ve done this sort of archiving in the past has leaned pretty heavily on the work of individuals and of committees,” Alba said. “But what we say about ourselves as a society is something that should be decided by as large of a group as possible.”
In order to involve a large number of people, Alba wanted to use a website where people could vote on individual locations. This data would then be converted into a general ranking.
“The basic problem was how to get people’s individual preferences converted over into a collective group preference,” Alba explained. By collaborating with researchers at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) media lab, Alba was able to create a website, www.earthtapestry.org, that could produce the required group preference. On the website, each voter is shown two images of landmarks from around the world, such as the Sahara, the Palace of Versailles, or the Carnegie Museum of Natural History. They are then asked to choose which image best represents a displayed adjective. For instance, a voter might be asked whether the Empire State Building or the Musée d’Orsay is more awe-inspiring.
As these comparisons are completed, an algorithm similar to the TrueSkill algorithm, a ranking system developed by Microsoft Research, is used in order to convert the data into a generalized ranking. Alba compared Earth Tapestry’s voting and ranking procedure with sports rankings. In team sports, multiple pair-wise comparisons are made between teams, which eventually results in a ranking system, despite the fact that not every team plays every other team. Similarly, the Earth Tapestry system uses pair-wise comparisons in order to generate a ranking of important locations, without forcing every voter to compare every location.
Along with ranking Earth’s important landmarks, the Earth Tapestry project also aims to preserve the discovered information. This will be done in a variety of ways, namely by archiving the information on the moon. On May 1, the existing data will be supplied to the Carnegie Mellon Moon Arts Group, which will be in charge of transferring the data to the moon. Voting will remain open after May 1, but any new data will not be archived. The existing data will be laser-engraved on a sapphire disk, coated in aluminum and enclosed in sheets of metal. This unit will be placed in a chamber of the Astrobotic Technology lunar lander, which is set to arrive on the moon during the second half of 2016. The chamber will also house three other information preservation projects entitled Sagan Planet Walk: Moon, Epoch Marker, and Signed Sealed Delivered. Aside from sending the data to the moon, the data will also be stored in deep digital archives.
Fundamentally, Earth Tapestry is an extremely interdisciplinary project. In order to preserve the more artistic side of the project, images of the landmarks with the highest rankings will be displayed in the College of Fine Arts at Carnegie Mellon in 2016 as part of the College of Fine Arts centennial celebration. Throughout the year the images will be rotated, with higher ranked landmarks being displayed for longer periods of time.
Alba hopes the project will continue once the data has been archived. “I would like to have Earth Tapestry continue not just on one location on the moon, but on several,” Alba said. “Redundancy is good if you want to preserve information. If others keep on sending things to the moon and to Mars, I would like to continue to send out volumes of Earth Tapestry, because our opinions of the world will change.”
Editor's Note: An earlier version of this article said that the Astrobotic Technology lunar lander was set to be launched in late 2015 or early 2016, rather than the second half of 2016.

Joel Brandt, a senior research scientist and engineering manager at Adobe Research, led a seminar hosted by Carnegie Mellon’s Human-Computer Interaction Institute last Wednesday. Brandt is a part of the Creative Technologies Lab, one of three separate labs that together form Adobe Research. As part of the Creative Technologies Lab, Brandt, along with other researchers, engineers, and entrepreneurs, works toward creating tools that help designers, developers, and educators.
In the seminar, Brandt stressed the dual nature of Adobe Research, which focuses both on improving Adobe products and on academic achievements. “We want people to create things that impact our customers’ lives, and we want people to create things that increase the world’s knowledge,” Brandt said. Aside from improving Adobe products, Adobe Research often focuses on academic work by publishing papers, interacting with universities, and aiding graduate students with their work. According to Brandt, roughly one out of four projects at Adobe Research has an actual impact on customers of Adobe, approximately half of the results found in studies are published into papers, and the rest of the studies done at Adobe Research do not have a substantial impact on a grander scale.
During the seminar, Brandt focused on discussing examples of the numerous research projects that have come out of the research labs. Some of the works that Brandt has worked on include Blueprint, a plug-in for Adobe Flash Builder that allows users to query the web for Adobe Flex and Adobe Flash code samples directly inside development environments. This plug-in allows for developers to quickly search for results with less friction.
In a study conducted by Google, researchers found that even 100 millisecond delays of returning information impact users of a product. Adobe’s Blueprint feature focuses on this study to deliver search results in a quick and effective manner. After developing this tool, the lab conducted surveys and studies on the actual implementation of the tool to see whether or not they could see improvements. In this particular case, the study was able to see improvements not only in time, but also quality of code.
Adobe Research also worked on Brackets, a code editor that focuses on code for the web, along with Theseus, an extension of Brackets that debugs JavaScript code. Brackets has features specific to the languages of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. For example, Live Preview is a feature that allows for a user to easily preview the display of their generated code on a web browser. Users can also make live edits and see their immediate changes display on the web browser. Brackets runs on an open source environment that can be easily accessed by any user on the web, meaning that software updates of Brackets and future developments involving Brackets not only come from Adobe developers and researchers, but also anyone interested in changing or adding features to the software.
Brandt has also been involved with Adobe Photoshop’s Project Recess, a brand-new user environment that is specifically directed towards web designers. 
The project has yet to be released, but it aims to help designers easily access the changes that they want made to their works. The project started off as an idea that a researcher had, but was fostered into a project that has now gained momentum. Brandt commented that this type of excitement is seen at Adobe Research labs often because of their open and collaborative environment that allows for flexibility in the projects of researchers.
All of these tools mentioned, in addition to many more projects and developments at Adobe Research, enable the creativity of others. Members in Adobe Research, like Joel Brandt, work towards improving the user experience so that the users themselves can focus on creativity and designs.

Pugwash discussed an issue close to the organization’s roots this week: the Iranian nuclear deal.
The purpose of the very first Pugwash conference was to discuss the implications of nuclear weapons. It was organized in 1957, as a response to a manifesto published in 1955 by Bertrand Russell and Albert Einstein. The manifesto warned against the dangers of weapons of mass destruction, and while it acknowledged the difficulty in eliminating war, it encouraged nations to solve problems non-violently and urged the world to “Remember your humanity, and forget the rest.”
The manifesto was signed by 11 leading scientists at the time, and two years later, philanthropist Cyrus Eaton offered his land in Pugwash, Nova Scotia as a location for the conference. Today’s student organizations are a continuation of the original mission of creating discussion around the social and ethical implications of science and technology.
The topic of weapons of mass destruction is now just one of many issues that Pugwash discusses, but it is a little sobering to think that more than 50 years down the road from the first conference, we are still struggling to bring nations together diplomatically and lower the risk of a nuclear war.
To begin our discussion this week, we watched an interview with President Barack Obama, who discussed his strategy in re-opening relationships with countries like Cuba and Iran. His main argument was that the United States is strong enough that it doesn’t lose anything by trying to talk and normalize relationships with other countries. Just talking doesn’t diminish the United States’ military power, nor does it take any options off the table, if the other countries were to be uncooperative.
The agreement reached with Iran over their nuclear program is one outcome of such normalization. It has seven planks: 1) Iran will never be within a year of building a nuclear weapon. 2) No more sanctions, by the UN or the US. 3) About a third of Iran’s centrifuges that are used to enrich fuel that could be used in a weapon will be dismantled. 4) A limit on how much enriched uranium Iran can keep will be imposed. 5) Certain nuclear plants will be shut down for at least 15 years. 6) No secret facilities. 7) Aggressive and intrusive inspections by the International Atomic Energy Agency.
For Iran, the most important issue is lifting sanctions. The sanctions currently in place are causing immense amounts of trouble for the average citizen of Iran, including reduced food security, a broken healthcare system, and unsafe travel. The removal of sanctions would be a huge boon to the economy and quality of life inside Iran.
However, Israel has a lot of problems with anything that could be seen as helping Iran, as the two countries have been extremely unfriendly toward each other. Although they have not officially claimed to have nuclear weapons, it is widely known that Israel is in fact a nuclear state, and the possibility of Iran gaining nuclear weapons is incredibly frightening to Israel.
The clamping down on nuclear proliferation has parallels to the conversation Pugwash had about pollution and the responsibility of climate change. Nations like the United States got the nuclear bomb, and then decided that no one else could have it, similar to how they used natural resources irresponsibly and gained the benefits, but now are urging other nations to be more restrained in the pollution and resource use.
One of the biggest disagreements among Pugwash members was with the idea of mutually assured destruction. Conventional wisdom says that if two enemy nations both have nuclear weapons, neither will actually use the weapons, because they are sure to be destroyed as well. However, does this actually hold? If an irrational, radical government came to power or a group of extremists got their hands on a nuclear weapon, would they really hold back due to the assurance that they would be destroyed as well?
However, it was also discussed that if it was a true deterrent to nuclear war, wouldn’t it be better for both Israel and Iran to have nuclear weapons? Also, wouldn’t it be more fair? However, the idealistic notion of fairness was quickly countered with the idea of realpolitik, which supposes that you can never know what others are doing, and therefore, nations should always look out for themselves.
In this case, applying a realpolitik analysis shows that if Iran were to get the bomb, Saudi Arabia would also acquire nuclear weapons from Pakistan, as Saudi Arabia isn’t an ally of Iran, but is allied with Pakistan, which has the bomb. In addition, a handful of other countries would also feel extremely threatened, as Iran isn’t friends with many nations in the Middle East, due to their sponsored terrorism in Lebanon, Syria, and Yemen, to name a few places. This conflict has an underlying cause in both religion and ethnicity, as Iran is made up of mostly Shia Muslims, which are in conflict with Sunni Muslims, who make up the majority of many other countries in the region. Also, most Iranians are ethnically Persian, while residents of other countries are either Arab, or, in the case of Israel, Jewish.
Regardless of members’ faith in the mutually assured destruction as a deterrent to nuclear war, almost everyone thought that it would be bad if Iran got nuclear weapons. As the recent outline of an agreement on a nuclear deal with Iran seems to decrease that chance, through reduced capabilities and more oversight on those capabilities, and with the original Pugwash conference in mind, most Pugwash members seemed to agree that it was a step in the right direction.
Student Pugwash is a non-advocacy, educational organization that discusses the implications of science. This article is a summary of last week’s discussion on the Iranian  Nuclear Agreement.

What do you think of when you see lightning? While watching television, you may have noticed that lightning is often the backdrop to an eerie haunted house. Back in grade school, you were probably told that Benjamin Franklin, one of the Founding Fathers of the U.S., flew a kite during a lightning storm in an effort to study electricity. And with the recent April forecast, you may have had the chance to witness a lightning bolt accompanied by pouring rain. It is no surprise that the supernatural-like effects of lightning are capable of evoking the fear and admiration of mankind, but what exactly is the process that gives rise to these spectacular displays of nature?
According to howstuffworks.com, lightning begins with the water cycle, which involves the evaporation of water into the atmosphere followed by the condensation of water into clouds. Eventually, the force of Earth’s gravity pulls back the liquid in form of precipitation, such as rain or snow.
During the condensation step of the water cycle, clouds contain millions of colliding droplets of water and ice. As more moisture enters the clouds, the electrons within the moisture are knocked off. Electrons can also be lost when the rising moisture collides with ice and sleet in the process of falling back onto Earth. In effect, the storm cloud acquires a buildup of static charge, which involves the accumulation of positively charged moisture and the ripped-off electrons at the top and the bottom of the cloud, respectively.
In addition to collisions, freezing also contributes to the polarization of a storm cloud. When rising moisture reaches higher altitudes, it experiences cooler temperatures. This creates clusters of water droplets with frozen, negatively charged water droplets in the inner regions. The outer regions of those clusters are unfrozen, positively charged water droplets.
Exposed to rising air currents, the positively charged regions of the cluster are ripped off and delivered to the top of the cloud. This leaves the remaining, frozen droplets to gravitate to the bottom part of the storm cloud.
The degree of polarization of charges within the cloud determines the strength of the surrounding electric field. With adequate strength, the electric field can repel electrons that are present on the ground, driving these electrons deep into the Earth. In turn, the surface of the Earth becomes more positively charged, contributing the polarity of charge between the ground and the storm clouds.
As the electric field grows stronger, the air surrounding the cloud becomes ionized. Through the process of ionization, electrons are removed from the molecules of the nonionized air. What would have originally been an insulator — resistant against the flow of charge — transforms into plasma, or ionized air. The conductive property of plasma allows for the free flow of electrons from the cloud to the ground.
Lightning bolts start off with the formation of step leaders, which are paths of ionized air that branch in the direction of Earth. Identified by their faint, purplish glow, step leaders provide media through which electrons from the bottom of the cloud can pass. While it is not clear why these paths have zigzag shapes, it is thought to be a result of differing levels of electrical conductivity within the air, caused by the presence of dust particles and other impurities within the air. Not to be confused with an actual lightning strike, step leaders serve to map out the path in which the strike will travel through. Meanwhile, the electric fields cause the propagation of streamers, or surges of positive charge from objects on the Earth. Like step leaders, they also display a purplish glow, but with more distinct edges.
When a step leader comes into contact with a streamer, the ionized air seals the connection between the cloud and the Earth. When lightning strikes, a discharge of current flows through this path, allowing for positive and negative charges to travel to opposite sides. Hence, lightning can be thought as Mother Nature’s way of neutralizing the imbalance of charge between the cloud and the Earth.
In addition, when the current flows between the leader and streamer, an enormous amount of heat is produced. With a temperature even higher than the surface of the sun, the heat of the lightning bolt creates its characteristic, brilliant white-blue flash. At the same time, the surrounding air explodes from the intensity of the heat, causing a shock wave that leads to the production of thunder. Once the main strike of lightning occurs, it is quickly followed by 30 to 40 secondary strikes. Occurring in rapid succession, secondary strikes can elongate the length of time the original strike appears to be present. A time delay between the original and secondary also creates the illusion that the main strike is flickering. From ionization to the moment of strike, it is surprising to think that the process of lightning occurs within a mere fraction of a second.
Despite its eerie beauty, lightning is definitely something to avoid. The National Weather Service estimates that in the U.S., 330 people are struck by lightning every year, including 55 deaths. Hence, it is important to be aware of precautions against the fatal effects of lightning. During the event of a lightning storm, it is important to take approriate shelter areas, such as a building or car. It is never a good idea to hide under a tree, which can attract lightning. While indoors, you should avoid using phones with cords or coming into contact with indoor pipes that may be made out of metal.
Lightning is probably one of the most powerful exhibit of electrostatics that nature has to offer. In fact, the sight of it can be safely appreciated from the comfort of your own home. And while the warm months continue to roll on, a lightning storm can create adventure out of what could have easily been another rainy day.

Navigation system found to be almost as effective as sight
Researchers at the University of Tokyo have discovered that blind rats with a geomagnetic sensor and digital compass attached to their brains are able to navigate a maze as successfully as rats who can see. Each time the blind rats moved their heads, the sensors generated electrical impulses to signal the direction they were facing. Subsequently, the rats were trained to find pellets in various mazes. Within a few days, the blind rats were able to navigate the mazes as well as rats with normal sight vision. The two groups of rodents relied on similar navigation strategies. This suggested that rats could potentially use allocentric sense, the sense of where the body is relative to the environment, to replace vision.
The research was published in Current Biology, and it is thought that such findings will be helpful in assisting blind people to independently navigate their surroundings. “The most plausible application is to attach a geomagnetic sensor to a cane so that the blind person can know the direction via tactile signals such as vibration,” said Yuji Ikegaya, a researcher from the University of Tokyo and co-author of the study.

Physicists learn about  geographic tongue condition
Geographic tongue (GT) is a condition where red patches appear when filiform papillae on the tongue are lost. GT affects approximately 2 percent of the global population, but its exact cause is unknown. Gabriel Seiden, a researcher from the Weizmann Institute of Science, and Sofia Curland, a researcher from the Max Planck Institute for the Physics of Complex Systems, noticed similarities between GT and other phenomenon like cardiac arrhythmias. 
Using mathematical models, the researchers were able to model the disease as a dynamic system that involved a healed state, inflamed state, and a recovering state. This model, termed the cellular automaton model, was published in the New Journal of Physics.
The model accounted for the presence of multiple lesions of different sizes expanding on the epithelium simultaneously and merging upon contact, thus leading to highly irregular patterns. Still, Seiden admitted that “we do not know exactly how spiral patterns form in GT patients due to lack of careful clinical studies on initiation and evolution of different patterns.”

Plague hits prairie dogs and changes various ecosystems
The same bacterium that caused the Black Death a few hundred years ago, Yersinia pestis, now rarely infects people in North America. However, it has caused the death of many black-tailed prairie dogs. This has the potential to be a serious problem for the ecosystem. A variety of other species rely on the existence of prairie dogs, so the disappearance of the species has the potential to compromise the overall health of the ecosystem. Specifically, prairie dog predators will be affected, but animals that use prairie dog burrows and grass patterns will also be drastically affected by the diminishing population.
“The connection between these animals and plants will be distorted and even broken,” said David Eads, a professor from Colorado State University. To correct this issue, Eads and his colleagues are searching for new ways to control the spread of Yersinia pestis. They are currently testing an insecticide that may be able to reduce the number of fleas, thus making the plague less infectious. “If we can’t control the problem, the grasslands are probably going to be far different within the next 100 years,” Eads said.

Smartphone data provides warnings of earthquakes
New research by Jawbone, a consumer technology and wearable device company, shows that sensors in smartphones can give early warnings of an earthquake. Recent analysis of data from an earthquake that took place last August in California indicated that smartphones with GPS sensors may reveal a lot of information right before an earthquake. 
On an ordinary day, we use GPS to map our way to a store, but GPS systems can also sense a sudden lurch in one direction. In the context of an earthquake, such a lurch sensed by many people at once could indicate a seismic shift. Benjamin Brooks, a researcher at the Earthquake Science Center, along with various colleagues, has tested what crowdsourced GPS data might look like in a real earthquake. 
With simulations of real-life earthquakes that occurred before, such as the earthquake in Japan in 2011, the researchers have gathered data that suggests data from around 5000 people would be enough to spot the beginnings of a major earthquake. This would leave approximately five seconds to warn major populations, which could make a difference in the way populations respond.

SpaceX to launch reusable rocket again on Monday
SpaceX plans to launch the robotic Dragon cargo capsule to the International Space Station (ISS) using a Falcon 9 rocket on April 13, as part of a $1.6 billion NASA contract. The Monday launch will be the sixth of twelve cargo missions to the ISS incorporated in the contract. The goal of the launch is to send Dragon toward the ISS and then bring the first stage of the Falcon 9 rocket back to Earth for a soft touchdown on an unmanned drone ship in the Atlantic Ocean.
SpaceX attempted the same reusable-rocket Dragon cargo launch earlier this year. The mission failed because after the Falcon 9 rocket hit the drone ship it exploded on the deck. It is thought that this occurred because the rocket ran out of hydrolic fluid before safely landing on the ship. SpaceX CEO Elon Musk vowed to fix that particular issue in time “for the next attempt.” Monday’s test is part of SpaceX’s effort to develop fully and rapidly reusable rockets, which, according to Musk, would reduce the cost of spaceflight by a factor of 100 if successful.

“Do you think it’s better to put a lot of effort into finding love, or leave it to fate?”
That’s the first question of Daniel Jones’ quiz, a love quiz he felt was important to put in his new book, Love Illuminated. 
Daniel Jones, the Editor of the New York Times Modern Love Column, wants you to know that he doesn’t know much about love. For the last 10 years, he’s been reading millions of stories from all across the country where people open their hearts to him in letters and e-mails. He’s listened, read, thought about, was inspired by, felt sad and angry, but if you ask him about love, and what it means, how to get it, and how to keep it, he is as clueless as the rest of us.
On Wednesday night, in a small crowded classroom at the University of Pittsburgh, members of the Pittsburgh community gathered to hear from the man who has read it all. Five minutes before the event started, I looked around the room to see many young college students of all genders scrolling through their newsfeeds, sitting side by side with elderly couples adjusting their hearing aids.
It’s curious how at all phases in our lives, we’re drawn to a conversation in the hope of learning more about love.
But Jones made it clear: He doesn’t have answers. But the audience was not there simply for answers, neat ends, or instructions. Jones’ conversation incited the audience to talk about the messiness of love. He didn’t limit the evening to a discussion of romantic love as he touched on the complexities of the love of parents, children, and complicated emotions that are introduced by death, and even the way love is experienced through the adoption of a child.
Jones encouraged the audience to talk about questions, ones that are complicated and messy. Questions ranged from ones that addressed modern day expressions of affection and sentiment, such as “Do you think a relationship conducted purely online, via words, images, emoticons, and texting shorthand can be as fulfilling as or possibly even more fulfilling than one conducted in person?” to the age old, “How much self-sacrifice can love reasonably require? And what happens when the person you promised to love no longer seems to be the person you’re married to?”.
This is how Jones’ book is structured. Love Illuminated has 10 different chapters, each of which focuses on big, messy questions and pulls incredible, thought-provoking stories from his column.
During the event, Jones spoke in a quiet and humble tone. He told lots of jokes, but he didn’t come across as pompous. Two authors joined him during the event: Pitt professor Aubrey Hirsh, who wrote a Modern Love column titled, “In Matters of the Heart We’re In This Together” about a literal and metaphorical heartbreak, and Lori Jakiela who wrote “The Plain, Unmarked Box Arrived” about a sex chair for herself and her husband.
When you read some of these columns, you can see why Jones selects these stories. They are poignant and important and well-written.
Jones also told us an important story about how he met his wife. In it, he answers the question, “If a word like destiny makes you gag, should you still try to believe in it?”.
I read Love Illuminated at a time when I needed it. After recognizing a huge distance between my perception of love and some messiness I was experiencing, I turned to the internet to find answers. It’s easy to find answers about love on the internet. Google “how to know if someone cares about you,” or “how to know when it’s time to break up” and you’ll find tons of so-called experts who promise that raised eyebrows mean interest and no phone call for 48 hours means a break-up. But oftentimes we are self-confirming in our searches. We only register information that we want to hear. That’s why the book and the column are so refreshing. After reading, I didn’t know a single new “rule” about love; instead I had a better framework for understanding about why I may have had such unrealistic expectations in the first place.
Jones’ book, column, and incredible Emmy-nominated animated video series offer the kind of advice people can use to grow rather than “know.” Love is messy and unique and difficult and short and long and real and imaginary. It is whatever you experience it to be.
When an audience member asked if his views on love are more pessimistic or optimistic after Jones finished reading, he says that many readers ask him why the column is so depressing. There are not very many happy endings, because in life there are also not many happy endings. However, Jones says he’s optimistic because despite a lack of fairy tale weddings, he says that he feels learning from an experience is the most important part. “If you go through something, and learn something … that’s an optimistic concept for me.”

This week, students in the School of Music performed their Annual Opera Scenes Showcase, which pulls selected scenes from seven different operas. It fell somewhere in between a live mixtape and an operatic variety show. The evening switched from story to story, cast to cast, and costume to costume, which kept the things exciting because we got to see the most interesting, exciting, and climactic scenes from each respective opera.
Kresge Theater in the College of Fine Arts was a much better venue for the show than Philip Chosky Theater over in Purnell would have been. Kresge is much more intimate and low key, which matched the vibe of the show. It was, of course, professionally and fantastically done, but it was more comfortable for the audience than the full-length operas performed in Chosky. Sets and costumes were simple to allow for the quick changes in story, but they were used to maximum effect. The whole night was aesthetically casual, but artistically breathtaking.
Before each scene, a student came out to present the plot of the entire opera, highlighting where the scene would begin and end, since all but one of the eight scenes would be in a language other than English.
Though all eight scenes were spectacular, I found two to be extra special.
The first of those is Act 1, Scene 1 from L’enfant et les sortilèges, a French Opera by Maurice Ravel (the title translates from French into The Child and the Spells). The premise is like a fairy tale that takes a turn for the worse, and could be a horror movie for children, if that were a real genre. The opera tells the story of a young child, played by junior vocal performance major Shannon Rynker, who gets scolded by his mother and sent to his room. When he gets there he throws a temper tantrum, destroying his room. But then the objects in his room start to come to life to show him what he’s done.
First, the fire comes to life because during his rage, he stirred it up. It comes out of the fireplace in the form of junior vocal performance major Rachel Doehring, who appears from a cloud of smoke in a dazzling red dress to sing a menacing aria to the little boy and the other items in the room. Finally she recedes, and turns the show over to the shepherds and shepherdesses in his wallpaper, which the boy attacked with the fire poker. They emerge from the wall in torn clothing, singing of their sad fate. The harmonies in this piece, “Adieu, Pastourelle,” paired with the very stripped-down but deliberate choreography, made the entire experience haunting in a way that had me paralyzed in my seat as I almost felt their pain.
The final step in the story comes from the princess in the story book that the child ripped up. Because the book was no longer intact, the princess would never get to be with her prince. For this scene, junior vocal performance major Hannah Nowicki walks out from backstage in a silver gown covered from hem to hem with sparkles, crowned with a tiara. Her song to the boy about her love that he took away was simply heartbreaking, and Nowicki’s light soprano voice was perfect for the role.
I think the simple elements of the production made this particular opera even more amazing. It really focused the attention onto the vocalists themselves, who performed their pieces with extraordinary skill.
The other opera scene that I was especially in awe of was Act 2, Scene 3 from Dialogues of the Carmelites, written by Francis Poulenc, which takes place during the beginning of the French Revolution. An old marquis and his son, Richard Marenda Jr., worry about Blanche, the Marquis’ very skittish daughter, easily startled and impressionable. They’re concerned for her fate during the revolution, but later she decides to join the convent and become a nun.
The scene opens when Blanche’s father and brother are about to leave Paris to escape the danger. Her brother comes to convince her to escape with them. The set is simply a bunch of chairs set up to represent pews, but each with LED lights on the bottom which made the lighting on the scene really stark and dramatic. As Blanche sings of her duty to the convent and her refusal to leave, she slowly and strategically places the chairs on their sides, creating shadows over the set and vocalists building up to a tense moment when she knocks the chairs down with a loud crash, commanding attention to not only her vocal power, but the strength of her very presence.
Where Chosky would have had an edge over Kresge is its captions monitor. When I attend the opera performances, I prefer having the translations in front of me so I can follow the plot exactly. But in this case, I got by. The performances were so strong and conveyed all the meaning I needed beyond the scene synopsis. The vocalists that performed not only sang like absolute professionals, they put on a show that I was excited to watch.

Saturday night marked the end of the almost month-long run of Carnegie Mellon’s student-run International Film Festival: Faces of Work.
The small audience in McConomy Auditorium listened to the kind words of thanks from Festival Director Jolanta Lion gave to students who helped her and individuals who supported the film festival. Lauralei Kraski, assistant to the director, also expressed her appreciation to those who put so much time into the festival’s construction, as well as audience members, many of whom went to multiple film festival showings.
Prior to the screening of the evening’s feature film, the audience was shown a documentary short by the late Professor Paul S. Goodman, to whom the festival was dedicated. In addition to being a professor of organizational psychology at Carnegie Mellon, Goodman was the director of the Institute for Strategic Development and the director of the Center for the Management of Technology. Much beloved by the university community, Goodman was also an avid filmmaker responsible for numerous short documentaries chronicling individuals in the workplace and detailing how work was and is defined in America.
The short showed at the film festival was called Waitress. It consisted of narration by Goodman, and extensive interviews with Toni, a waitress with 23 years of experience at Scotty’s Diner here in Pittsburgh. Though a little campy, the film was satisfying and, dare I say it, adorably dated, having been filmed in 1996. The ten minutes or so of the film included very ‘90s hairstyles in addition to some interesting reflections on being a waitress from Toni. It was gratifying to witness the work of a Carnegie Mellon professor be so appreciated.
The final film in the Festival, an Indian film from 2014, Court, dealt with so many themes that it was a little difficult to understand the film’s message. Though that might have been a part of the film’s artistic point, Director Chaitanya Tamhane’s first feature production dealt with issues of bureaucracy, artistic expression, classism, and racism throughout. The film follows the incarceration and court dates of self-proclaimed “folk musician” Narayan Kamble, who is brought into court on the transparently flawed charge of “abetting suicide.” The prosecution claims that Kamble incited a sewer worker to commit suicide after allegedly encouraging all sewer workers to kill themselves. What follows is an understated and honest portrayal of India’s flawed justice system. Kamble’s trial is postponed multiple times, the investigating officer collaborates with a witness who is the only witness for the prosecution, and all the while Kamble’s health deteriorates in a prison cell.
Kamble’s devoted lawyer Vinay Vora seems resigned whenever they postpone the trial to a date, often a month or more in the future even after just a few minutes of procedure. There is no outcry for court reform in the movie. Once, prosecutor Nutan complains about the duration of this trial, but she does not frame it explicitly as a fault of the system. In this particular conversation she discusses the speed with which judges can get through cases that come to court. This sort of conversation, skirting around the edge of the issue at hand, is largely what makes the film’s critiques so powerful.
The private lives of Vora and Nutan bring to light a fascinating dichotomy. Vora comes from a family of great wealth. His position as a lawyer is not the most frugal or the most natural for a man of his status. There exists tension, but also extreme luxury. One scene shows Vora hanging out with friends in an upscale bar with live, Western-style music, in comparison to Kamble’s folk music. In another scene he picks up a plethora of very fancy cheeses in a nice grocery store. Even though he comes from a place of elevated status, Vora still wishes to help those less fortunate than himself. He feels a moral responsibility for his clients that are victims of the system, such as Kamble.
On the other hand, public defender Nutan comes from a social strata more similar to those who are facing court charges. Though she is not an evil character, Nutan does not feel the same level of social responsibility.
Chock-a-block full of thought-provoking contradictions, Court is a nuanced exploration of various social issues in India. Though I think it would have been useful to enter the film knowing a little bit more about the Indian legal system, and social issues present in the area, the film managed to convey many important points I understood, despite my personal ignorance.
Most importantly, Court closed Carnegie Mellon’s Film Festival powerfully. The fact that Carnegie Mellon is the home of the only student-run international film festival in the country is truly amazing. Movies have the power to transcend cultures, religions, and ideologies, making film a powerful tool for educating people around the globe. I sincerely hope to see next year’s attendance to this spectacular month of thoughtful art increase.

Watching Chekhov’s Three Sisters at Purnell’s Philip Chosky Theatre was seeing reality splayed across a 19th-century Russian backdrop. The characters are authentic — hopeful and hurting and flawed, so real that their lives seem to spill over into ours. And despite, or perhaps because of, the constant meditations on posterity, the entire production seems incredibly immediate, as if it were written last week instead of a hundred years ago. The themes — love, family, death and enlightenment — are as timeless as writing itself. Who hasn’t longed for a bygone time, a lost love, or a better future at some point?
Pamela Berlin, director of the Three Sisters, manages a heavy, lumbering machine with numerous turning wheels. Make no mistake, there are no one-dimensional characters here. Each and every one is fleshed out, given meaning, motivation and an overarching story intricate enough to exist as a stand-alone play. Even so, they all seem to come together and complement each other, not like neat pieces in a puzzle, but like we might do with our own friends and family. Speaking of us, as the audience, we’re always aware of the multiplicity of personalities elbowing each other for space on the larger canvas, which is itself barely capable of keeping it all contained. Even so, Berlin effectively brings it all together with extraordinary delicacy and balance.
The play starts with the three sisters just entering adulthood, full of dreams and optimism. Olga, the eldest, played by senior acting major Kelsey Carthew, is the maternal figure in the family. Kind and caring, particularly to her household servants, she is a teacher at the local high school. Masha, the middle sister, played by senior acting major Colleen Pulawski, is somewhat unhappy with her marriage, and falls head over heels for the idealistic Lieutenant-Colonel Vershinin in the opening scene. The most direct character by far, Masha has a caustic wit that is a frequent source of humor. Irina, the youngest, played by senior acting major Olivia Lemmon, is an unabashed idealist. Fascinated by trivial things like a spinning top, she longs to return to the hustle and bustle of Moscow, and disdains the inertia that has befallen the so-called “gentry” of Russia.
Another important character is the brother of the three: Andrei, played by senior acting major Ben Edelman. He starts out as a man of learning, on the fast track to becoming a professor in Moscow. He also happens to be in love with a commoner called Natasha, much to the chagrin of the rest of his family. Natasha, played by senior acting major Cathryn Dylan, is another central character. She starts out a victim, mocked for her taste by the others, before going on to ironically turn the tables on the others.
All said and done, however, Three Sisters is no family soap opera. What was even more impressive than the depth of personalities was the depth of ideas on display. Characters ruminate on imposing ideas: Where will the world be in a hundred years, why do we need to do good productive work, how can we leave a legacy for eternity, and what is the purpose of knowledge, if not for the sake of itself? Besides being openly debated and discussed, these ideas are the underlying motivations that lead characters to make the decisions they do. Ultimately, I felt like I was watching life play out as it does, unscripted and untidy, all the while being aware of the underlying framework governing it all.
There are also no big, climactic events in Three Sisters. Earth shattering developments occur throughout, yet they are never given center stage. Instead, the audience sees a fluid stream of anticlimaxes that we come to terms with long after the fact. Three Sisters is undoubtedly an exhausting performance to watch, because it hits us little by little, until we are eventually aware of everything that has transpired before our eyes. The grand optimism expressed in the first act is gradually killed by a thousand cuts that we don’t see coming until the very end, by which point we are far too invested to not be heartbroken.
Three Sisters might make you smile, or it might make you cry. The characters might win your empathy for their struggles, or they might garner your disdain for their vapidness. What the entire experience will definitely make you do, however, is think. You’ll think about yourself, your friends and family, and your world at large, and come to realize that even though there may be uncertainty and darkness at every turn ahead, it’s the little things that add up to light the way.

The typical Latin-American teenager has seen their fair share of telenovelas. From watching RBD perform in Rebelde in Middle School, to a million other shows about people staring at each other for excruciatingly long periods of time, the telenovela is a cultural phenomenon in all of Latin America — it is one of the unifying threads for all of us. The difference that makes Jane the Virgin so good is that, unlike with telenovelas, the show is rooted in reality and has amazing actors that make the characters personable.
The basic premise of the show is simple: Jane is a virgin, but she is also pregnant after getting accidentally inseminated. The father is the owner of the hotel where she works; his wife was getting the insemination without his knowledge in order to get money out of him, and the doctor that inseminated Jane is the father’s sister.
From that point on, the storyline gets more complicated and intertwined, just like any good telenovela. The show, however, manages to put all of these storylines together and pulls it off with great aplomb. The reason why the show can make it work is simple: Gina Rodríguez. The breakout star that is Gina was mostly unknown in the entertainment industry until this point. She had some minor roles in some movies and a soap opera, but her portrayal of Jane in this show brought her to the mainstream and even gave her her first Golden Globe award.
That being said, she’s not the only shining star in the cast. Justin Baldoni, famous for his proposal that went viral a few years ago, plays Rafael Solano (the father of the baby) in a way that makes him bold and sincere and extremely approachable. Ivonne Coll, former Miss Puerto Rico, plays Alba Villanueva (Jane’s grandmother) as the classic latin grandmother: lovable, strict, wise, and always right. Her character is portrayed with perfect composure, and every Latin person will understand her role and connect with it. The fact that she only speaks Spanish and subtitles are shown when she speaks is a character choice that makes perfect sense. At the time she was supposed to have emigrated from Venezuela, she would not have been able to grasp the language as well as her daughter would, especially since her contact would have been mostly within the family. Coll can speak English perfectly, and she has done so in many other movies and TV shows, but this character choice really makes her the truest version of her character possible.
One of the better parts of the show is the inclusion of an actual telenovela star playing an overdramatic telenovela star (Jane’s estranged father who doesn’t know he has a daughter). Jaime Camil has starred in countless telenovelas and has hosted many other Spanish shows. His character is basically himself, but more grandiose, and much more driven by the fame that comes with being an actor. The character is essentially the comic relief of the show and can be so one-dimensional at times that his character becomes a great reason to watch the show.
Ultimately, the characters and their portrayal really drive this show and make it better than it would seem on paper. They stay rooted in reality and the actors portray them as honestly as they can, giving the show a sense of understanding of where they are and where they should be going. It’s an honest portrayal of a modern Latin family living under a series of very rare — yet very plausible — circumstances.

Kiltie Band Concert.
Thursday, April 16. 3:30-4:30 p.m. Midway Main Tent.
Come hear the dulcet tones of one of Carnegie Mellon’s most beloved — and weirdest — musical ensembles. Even if you are just walking around Midway, you are sure to hear the wonderful musical talents of Carnegie Mellon students. Self-recognized as “the band without pants,” Kiltie Band is guaranteed to take you on a slightly confusing, bizarre, hat-oriented, and energetic musical journey.
AB’s Spring Carnival Comedy Show. 
Thursday, April 16. 7:30-9:30 p.m. Midway Main Tent.
Rain location: Wiegand Gym.
Two of HBO’s Silicon Valley regulars are coming to Carnegie Mellon for an evening of near-constant laughter. Tom Middleditch is opening for Kumail Nanjiani, and both promise to be an absolute riot. Last year’s Spring Carnival Show, hosted by Activities Board, featured comedian Tig Notaro yelling at a student blankly eating a turkey leg, and headliner Hannibal Buress making completely justified fun of Google Glass. If you are a fan of comedians, self-deprecation, and trying new things, try to make it to the Comedy Show. Snag a ticket off someone who has one, but doesn’t feel like going for whatever reason. They are lame, and you will have a hugely fun evening.
Carnival Fireworks.
Thursday, April 16. 9:00 p.m. Midway.
Hopefully this will happen, even though the weather doesn’t look fabulous. Join the rest of the Carnegie Mellon community to watch beautiful fireworks that make your stomach rumble. It’s always a weirdly special treat to see fireworks that aren’t on the Fourth of July or New Year’s.
Holi.
Friday, April 17. 12-3 p.m. Schenley Park.
Come on out to celebrate the spring festival of Holi! Take part in the beautiful and colorful festivities, during which people get covered with colored powder and everybody runs around in the meadow and takes comfort in the fact that the miserable Pittsburgh winter is over. Though not explicitly artistic, the colors — and the food that will be served (if you have a ticket) — will definitely make an emotional impression.
Shot for Shot Student Film Festival.
Friday, April 17. 7:30 p.m. McConomy Auditorium.
Organized by the Carnegie Mellon Film Club, Shot for Shot Student Film Festival shows student-made films from around Pittsburgh. The festival’s goal is to incite conversation about the films, as well as connect young, aspiring filmmakers to professionals already working in the field. An often hidden community at Carnegie Mellon, the whole campus can take advantage of this showcase to see what young filmmakers here in Pittsburgh are up to.
Scotch’n’Soda’s Merrily We Roll Along.
Friday, April 17. 2 p.m. and 7 p.m.
Saturday, April 18. 2 p.m. and 11 p.m. McConomy Auditorium.
Steven Sondheim’s tour de force musical Merrily We Roll Along is a poignant examination of all that friendship is, can be, and has been. Oftentimes sad, and sometimes gloriously happy, this beautiful musical explores all that friendships are, and how they endure — or do not endure — life’s complexities.
AB Spring Carnival Concert.
Saturday, April 18. 7:30 p.m. The Mall. 
Rain location: Wiegand Gym.
Matt & Kim are coming to Carnegie Mellon! Though tickets are sold out, anyone with a Carnegie Mellon ID can get into the show if it remains outside. Matt & Kim are amazing live performers, and the opener RJD2 also promises to be fantastic. Even if you only know the song “Daylight,” listen to a couple others and head out to the Mall for an evening of dancing (or moshing) to music with some of your closest friends and a couple thousand of your favorite classmates.

Dear Evan,
My ex is coming back for Carnival, and she texted me last night asking if I wanted to hang out with her over the weekend. I was planning on being cross-faded out of my mind for my last Carnival — nothing beats fried Oreos and Booth while you’re tripping — but if I say yes, I’m going to have to stay pretty sober, so that I don’t do anything stupid like follow her when I graduate. She lives in Detroit, and I’d rather not end up trying to find a job or internship there. 
I mean, are there even any jobs in Detroit?
Flummoxed,
EXpecting Overzealous Debauchery Upon Sight
Dear EX-ODUS,
Why do you need to be sober when you see her? She’ll probably understand, and she’ll probably be pretty plastered, too. If not, well, you hold no obligation to show yourself at your best. So what if you flirt with her unabashedly at a party, then shout that you see a little silhouetto of a man — Scaramouch! Scaramouch! — and ask him to do the fandango? It’s Carnival — anything goes.
If you have attachment issues, it won’t be hard to avoid your ex. There are at least 50 parties you can go to at any point during the weekend; if you know she’s going to one on Beeler, just head to the house across the street.
Or buy all the fried Oreos at Booth eat them at home every night,
Evan Kahn
Dear Evan,
Yesterday, one of my professors spent our entire recitation lecturing us on how to dress for interviews. Her suggestions were trite, and her borderline-offensive tone made everyone pretty uncomfortable. When she used pictures of people in class to illustrate her point, I got up and left out of anger.
How can I best make her feel bad about ruining our recitation?
Irked,
Puked Robustly Out of Unfettered Displeasure, Speculating Lashing Out at Buffoon
Dear PROUD SLOB,
She’s harping on how Carnegie Mellon students dress? She may as well be telling Kanye how to speak at awards ceremonies. It’s futile.
But really, who takes class time away to comment on their students’ appearances, unless they’re distracting from the learning environment? You should complain to the Dean. That’s just plain insulting.
Or put warm taffy on her chair and ruin her Versace dress,
Evan Kahn

Into the Woods
Thursday, Apr. 16
8 & 10:30 p.m.
Meryl Streep is a perfect human, so there’s no question as to why Into the Woods is so superb. A rather dark interpretation of some of our more classic fairytales, this live action version of Steven Sondheim’s award winning musical features an all-star cast. Emily Blunt plays the wife of a baker who cannot bear a child, so she and her husband embark on a quest to reverse the curse that made her so. The curse was set on her by a witch, played by the aforementioned Streep. Fairy tale heroes and enemies return in this entirely new adventure, including Little Red Riding Hood, Cinderella, and Rapunzel. Filled with luscious costumes and impressive CGI, the movie also boasts plenty of eye candy. Though some of the more controversial and graphic themes present in the musical were adapted to fit a wider audience, Into the Woods is still a refreshing take on old classics.
Penguins of Madagascar.
Saturday, Apr. 18
11:30 p.m.
Sunday, Apr. 19
7:30 p.m.
A spin-off of everyone’s favorite childhood DreamWorks film, Madagascar, Penguins of Madagascar follows the further adventures of four crazy penguins. In this spin-off, the penguins are taken hostage by an octopus named Dave. Sounds almost too good to be true, right? What ensues is a fast-paced spy thriller starring various members of the animal kingdom with funny names. Though the penguins are not very bright and get captured numerous times, they eventually make it home scott-free. One of the best parts of the movie is Benedict Cumberbatch’s voice role as Classified, a gray wolf who is part of a spy agency called “North Wind.” Radioactivity and mutation also play a role in this scattered, yet enjoyable, film for all ages.

Lasting 100 days, from April 7 to mid-July 1994, and claiming nearly one million lives, the Rwandan Genocide still pervades people’s memories. The event marked its 21st anniversary this past Tuesday. A conflict between two groups, the Hutu and Tutsi, the genocide marred the country in many ways for years to come. Students at Carnegie Mellon donned silver and gray ribbons in memoriam of those who lost their lives, a tradition that lasts a week in Rwanda each year. Carnegie Mellon’s student group Project Rwanda organized the day’s event.
Project Rwanda started in 2010 with help from Assistant Director of Student Affairs M. Shernell Smith and Assistant Dean of Student Affairs Renee Camerlengo. 
It is a “student guided initiative,” according to its project narrative, and remains one of Carnegie Mellon’s only philanthropic initiatives in Africa. The overall goal of the project is to help Rwanda strive for a more knowledge-based economy: a goal relevant to Carnegie Mellon’s campus in Kigali, Rwanda.
As the connection between Carnegie Mellon’s Pittsburgh campus and Carnegie Mellon’s Rwanda graduate campus grows, the prevalence of Project Rwanda’s initiative continues to grow as well. 
Junior computer science major Ben Plaut chose to place the ribbon on his backpack. “It is great that the organization is spreading awareness about this, because there are so many things that students at Carnegie Mellon aren’t aware of,” Plaut said.
Awareness is exactly the goal of this initiative, and not just awareness for the atrocious event 21 years past, but the current thriving nation of Rwanda. Second-year master’s candidates Josephine Mukesha, a Rwandan native, and Ivy Wainaina, a Kenyan native, found the Project Rwanda organization important for the Carnegie Mellon campus. “If you don’t talk about it, then you aren’t giving values to the one million lives that were lost,” Mukesha said on the importance of discussion in memoriam.
The ribbon project acts as a first step in learning about Rwanda’s genocide and post-genocide reconstruction. “It happened 21 years ago. So much has happened after that: Rwanda is working to rebuild the country, and some outside people are still in the mindset that it happened yesterday,” Mukesha said.
Rwanda now leads most African countries in innovation and education. “If you go to Kigali now, it looks nothing like what the videos would show you of genocide. It has good infrastructure, LTE, free laptops for children. If you think of innovation in Africa, you should think Rwanda,” Wainania said.
Many problems still exist in and around Carnegie Mellon Rwanda’s Kigali campus, providing a unique problem-solving opportunity for Pittsburgh students. “The Rwandan campus can show the challenges that CMU students don’t necessarily face. Africa is such a big market, and can give another perspective. So students can think of a problem from a different perspective, or see problems that you don’t have here. So it gives students a global view, too,” Mukesha said, marking the importance of intercampus connectivity.
Africa is modernizing itself, and Rwanda is no exception. “Africa is such a big market, and can give another perspective. So students can think of a problem from a different perspective, or see problems that you don’t have here. So it gives students a global view, too,” Mukesha said.
Mukesha emphasized that in many Rwandan urban areas, technology is just as present and up to date as in the U.S., contrary to what some students may think.
“It’s interesting to see some technological things that seem new here in the United States, but then to realize that we’ve had it for a long time. Take, for instance, paying money with your phone. That has been around in Rwanda for what feels like forever,” Wainania said.
All these ideas for campus connection and understanding show the true idea behind Project Rwanda: People are all people, and they should not be afraid to talk to each other and learn from others’ experiences. 
“Some people were in a family of twenty, and now it is just them. If you don’t talk to those people, if you don’t give them empathy for their pain, you can’t go forward. To move forward, you need to remember the past, and you need to remember the pain to the point where it should never happen again,” Mukesha said, a message very common about genocide, yet very often overlooked.

The future looks dim for smokers on campus. On Thursday, the Undergraduate Student Senate approved a proposal banning tobacco wholly from campus. Yet, proponents of banning tobacco products aren’t necessarily smoking the competition.
The proposal passed through Senate with 15 in favor, 13 against, and one abstaining senator. Now, the policy has to make its way through Graduate Student Assembly, Faculty Senate, and Staff Council. 
Afterwards, University President Subra Suresh must sign off on the policy taking effect. If all the pieces fall into place, and the policy does take effect, tobacco use will be banned on campus entirely. 
According to the draft of the proposed policy, “Smoking and use of other tobacco products is prohibited by students, staff, faculty, and visitors in all university buildings, facilities or property owned, leased, or operated by Carnegie Mellon University, including campus grounds and outside areas.”
The policy continues to define a “tobacco product” as “any type of product containing, made, or derived from tobacco that is intended for human consumption and ingested by any means.”
The proposed policy does make concessions for e-cigarettes, the health effects of which are still debated. 
As a result of this, the policy prohibits campus community members from using e-cigarettes or vaporizers indoors, but allows their use outdoors.
Beginning with a rationality statement, the policy itself relies heavily on the example set by over 1,000 other universities that have already banned tobacco from campus. 
“We believe that making a campus tobacco-free is considered the gold standard of health,” Dean of Student Affairs Gina Casalegno, who sits on the smoking policy review committee that wrote the policy, said of the policy.
Mainly focusing on the health of Carnegie Mellon community members, the policy seeks to aid not only bystanders, but current users and new users. 
“We do care a lot about individuals who consume tobacco and wish to receive aid in cessation of those habits” Casalegno added last week in an interview with The Tartan.
Preventing people from starting and current smokers from continuing is a goal of the smoking policy review committee. 
The policy cites the Surgeon General, stating that smoking still exists as the “leading preventable cause of death in the United States” in its rationale for the policy. 
Going forward, other organizations hold these arguments in mind when they put it to a vote. The GSA and Faculty Senate will consider the views of smokers as well in their upcoming votes on the policy.
The population of smokers on campus is diverse, much like the population of Carnegie Mellon itself. 
Over 20 percent of Carnegie Mellon’s 13,000 students are from different countries, a significant portion of those students hailing from China or Korea. 
In the international sphere, China and Korea as countries consume more cigarettes than the United States. Per capita per year consumption of cigarettes is 700 cigarettes higher and about 1000 cigarettes higher in China and Korea respectively, according to the Washington Post.
With such a significant number of students from abroad, and from countries that consume that much more on average, the Smoking Policy Review Committee has a significant cultural hurdle to combat with the new policy. 
Yet data from other universities which have banned tobacco shows a significant decrease in the number of users after a smoke- and tobacco-free policy is implemented on campuses.
Data from the Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) shows a decrease in overall users in the United States of about 20 percent since 1965. 
With CDC domestic figures, Pennsylvania still ranks eighth in smoking prevalence. On a dogmatic level, schools see this number decreasing with preventative measures just like the Committee’s proposed policy.
The future of the policy is balancing upon whether or not the respective governing bodies buy into this vision.

Members of University Health Services (UHS), initiated an attempt to make rapid, last-minute changes to the Carnegie Mellon and Aetna joint insurance policies, prompting discussion on campus and an impending announcement. 
During the latest round of negotiations and yearly contract renewal from Aetna, Carnegie Mellon’s insurance provider, UHS Business Manager Phyllis Lombardi noticed some worrisome changes. “The rates were much higher because of a phenomenon called rate parity,” Lombardi said. “It really caught me off guard — the rates went up between 13 and 24 percent.”
According to Lombardi, dependent rate parity indicates that the rates charged to the dependents of student subscribers of the insurance must not exceed the rate charged to the subscriber. 
Because everyone — including subscribers, spouses, and dependents — is covered by these plans, the extra costs of the extra coverage becomes a burden on everyone who buys insurance, even if they themselves do not have dependents on the plan. 
In order to cover those costs, the price of insurance packages had gone up, far past the 15 percent increase cap that Carnegie Mellon and Aetna Insurance had agreed upon. “Across the board, across the country, health insurance costs have gone up; everyone knows that and everyone hears about it everyday. Everyone is paying more, but this was way, way more than we expected,” Lombardi said.
Lombardi began to investigate ways through which the university could help to cut the cost of insurance coverage for students, knowing that about 60 percent of the student body uses Aetna as their insurance provider. 
“As it is now, students on the standard plan are subsidizing insurance costs for everyone, including the enhanced plan subscribers. I also know that the students on the enhanced plans are the ones who know they’ll use it — they’re chronically ill, they plan on needing to stay in the hospital, or they’re pregnant and they know they’re going to have a baby — so they choose the enhanced plan to cover that. 
“About 75 percent of those students use their insurance because it’s covered. But with the standard plan, students treat it as ‘just in case’ insurance, and 75 percent don’t use it,” she added.
Students who have the standard plan are often unable to pay the $400 deductible, the 20 percent coinsurance, or the $3,000 out of pocket maximum, according to Lombardi. 
They simply can’t afford it, so they don’t use the plan. “After all of that, I thought, ‘What if there was only one plan and only one plan that we had to subsidize dependents for?’ Then I went to the Graduate Student Assembly [GSA], to the Undergraduate Student Senate, and to Gina [Casalegno, dean of student affairs] and to Michael [Murphy, vice president of campus affairs] to see how quickly people could be socialized to the plan.”
The single plan program would feature just the enhanced plan as an option, which would cost $1,583 a year. This enhanced plan option by itself is cheaper than the enhanced plan option would be if there were two plans offered, and, according to Lombardi, it became clear that this plan was the one to go with. 
“If we’re thinking about having only one plan, why not have it be the enhanced plan? It would have manageable copays, it’s easier to understand, and it has a $0 deductible for mental health, which is really, really important to Carnegie Mellon’s administration and students. It would help the Health Center, it would help the students, and the campus as a whole,” she said.
Unlike those of peer institutions who have been faced with similar insurance plan scenarios, the plan would still feature coverage for dependents, something that the GSA, Casalengo, and Murphy felt was important. 
The enhanced plan would also put Carnegie Mellon’s insurance at the forefront of mental health insurance and insurance for physical, occupational, and speech therapy, according to Lombardi.
Lombardi’s efforts have run on a highly condensed timeline so that UHS would be able to roll out the plan this semester to introduce next year, and reception on campus has been warm. 
Lombardi presented to the GSA two weeks ago and to the Undergraduate Student Senate the same week. In straw polls of both bodies, the plan was endorsed.
Ian Glasner, student body president and senior electrical and computer engineering and business administration double major, said he was excited by the prospect. 
“We’re able to reduce costs for the enhanced plan and create an environment on campus where everyone who needs healthcare can use Carnegie Mellon’s plan to feel safe. It’s affordable and effective,” he said.
Evan Wineland, Undergraduate Student Senate chair and junior information systems major, agreed.
“As someone who pays for his own insurance and someone who has had unexpected medical costs, I sincerely wish that I was on the enhanced plan instead of the standard plan. It takes very little in medical costs for the enhanced plan to pay off, and it’s the lowest cost in-market. It’s a no-brainer,” Wineland said. “But, it’s something that will inevitably have a different effect on graduate students than undergraduate students, because they have families.”
The GSA is sensitive to the varied needs of its constituency, according to an email from Ph.D. candidate in rhetoric and GSA president Carolyn Commer. 
The GSA Healthcare Committee and the GSA Departmental Representatives have stated their support of the change, but have also expressed concerns. “The plan is more expensive for those who used to enroll in the standard plan, it reduces readily-available options, and higher utilization of [student health insurance] could mean higher costs in the future, though this is hard to predict,” wrote Commer.
Commer explained that most graduate students pay the money for their insurance out of pocket. An increase in costs would put pressure on Ph.D. and master’s students without health care stipends and graduate students with dependents who would have to shoulder higher costs.
But, even with those reservations, the GSA endorsed the changes, citing the many benefits the changes would prompt, such as simpler payment processes, lower costs, and a more understandable option for insurance policies, and financial aid to cover the cost of the insurance, Commer wrote. 
When it comes down to it, Lombardi said, it’s a smaller cost for a lot more care. 
“It’s heartbreaking for me to sit here and hear students talk about what they’re going through. I know how scary it can be to not know how much something is going to cost. I want us to be a university to offer a plan that helps students not to worry. You never know what’s going to happen, and that’s what insurance is for: peace of mind,” she said. 
A final decision is expected this  week.

Carnegie Mellon places fifth in 2014 Putnam Mathematics Competition
Announcements of the results for the 2014 William Lowell Putnam Mathematical Competition have revealed an impressive outcome for Carnegie Mellon. The Carnegie Mellon University team, consisting of junior science and humanities scholar Linus Hamilton and sophomore mathematical sciences majors Thomas Swayze and Samuel Zbarsky, won fifth place, marking the team’s fourth consecutive year to place among the top five. In addition, 55 individual Carnegie Mellon students placed among the top 507, the second most of any university.
On Dec. 6, 2014, 4,320 American and Canadian undergraduate students gathered from 557 institutions, including a strong showing of 205 students from Carnegie Mellon, to participate in the 75th William Lowell Putnam Mathematical Competition, often simply referred to as the Putnam Competition. Administered by the Mathematical Association of America, the famously challenging examination is considered the premier mathematics contest for undergraduates. 
According to the release, John Mackey, associate head of the Mathematical Sciences Department, stated, “We are tremendously proud of all the Putnam participants, including their coach [assistant professor of mathematical sciences Po-Shen] Loh, for their skill, spirit and determination. For us, this is more exciting than the NCAA Basketball Tournament. It’s our December and March Madness!”
Those on the team and who placed in the top 21 are part of Carnegie Mellon’s Knaster-McWilliams Scholars program, a scholarship-supported and honors program that features increased access to faculty and early research opportunities. It is funded through the generosity of a physics alumnus and mathematics and electrical engineering alumnus.
Each member of the university team will receive a $200 cash prize, and Carnegie Mellon’s Department of Mathematical Sciences in the Mellon College of Science will receive $5000.

Yemeni conflict escalates
Saudi Arabia continues to carry out airstrikes in Yemen.  Saudi Arabia is the leading country behind airstrikes against the Iranian-backed Houthi movement in Yemen. Saudi Arabia accused Iran of providing military aid to the Houthi movement. Saudi Arabia extended its bombing campaign in order to stop the Houthi movement and its allies from dominating Yemen. 
The Houthi continued their advance and have killed more than 500 people and wounded 1,700 in the past three weeks.
The insults and threats have raised fears of a Yemeni conflict that could further inflame the rivalry between Iran and Saudi Arabia. Houthi-allied forces have taken control of government offices in Ataq, the capital of Shabwa Province.

The critique has been made before: Current sex education programs are ineffective. While some students only receive fear-based information about sexually transmitted diseases and pregnancy, others only learn abstinence and still others do not receive sex ed at all. 
Not being properly informed about human sexuality, reproductive rights, and sexual assault can lead to difficult situations, such as disease and unwanted pregnancy, but also to severe misconceptions about sex and sexuality. The way that sex education is being taught right now fails to address human sexuality in an open and frank way, which is damaging to students as sexual beings.
Sex education as it currently exists perpetuates sex as a taboo, aside from information about anatomy and sexually transmitted diseases, as well as contraceptives if you're lucky. The discussion of the sexual acts themselves, however, is off limits. No health teacher will ever talk about the [ITAL]how[ITAL] of sex, so it's up to kids to figure it out for themselves.
For young boys, curiosity is "natural," according to society. They're excused because "boys will be boys" and it's "just the hormones." Their sexual exploration is deemed "okay." They tend to feel comfortable with masturbation and often experiment with pornography. Movies and TV shows will even poke fun at this. When boys mature and eventually find themselves with a sexual partner, they at least have an idea of what sex looks and feels like.
Girls, on the other hand, aren't afforded the same privilege. The concept of an adolescent girl masturbating or even having sexual urges is enough to make most adult educators a little uncomfortable. Understandably so, but this teaches girls that their sexuality isn't appropriate. They experiment and masturbate to significantly smaller degree, so often their first sexual encounter is with someone else. While guys can develop their sexual identity independently, a girl's sexuality may always be attached to what she means to another person.
This can have damaging effects on a girl's body image and self esteem growing up. She may be too concerned with attaining a certain degree of physical attractiveness so that guys will find her desirable, which is a huge strain on a young girl's confidence. She might find her self-worth in whether or not guys find her desirable; if they do not, this can also be painful. 
Additionally, she most likely will not know the difference between her vagina and clitoris, as the latter is often erased from discussions of anatomy in sex education. If she can't come to orgasm through sex, she may feel like something is wrong with her, or otherwise become sexually frustrated.
Even for girls who are aware of their sexuality, problems still arise. They're still likely to be affected by body image issues and other societal pressures, but they'll mostly become victims of the stigma surrounding female sexuality. Because the stigma exists, many sexually active women become victims of slut shaming, which goes even further to convince women that their sexuality is something to hide or ignore, and especially to promote a sexual double standard.
Boys aren't necessarily free from any negative effects either. Even though they're permitted to be more sexual, society still imposes its own standards upon them. Boys are expected to be virile and manly; therefore, when they don't have sex, or as much sex as they want, they get frustrated. This can sometimes translate into a sense of entitlement. 
Additionally, boys may grow up feeling unable to express their feelings because there's so much emphasis on them as physical beings, so entitlement and frustration can unfortunately lead to sexual assault.
Boys also don't learn about female sexuality in a realistic way. For most boys, they only learn what porn teaches them, or they don't know anything at all. Either way, they're likely to assume that vaginal penetration alone should bring girls to orgasm. When this assumption proves untrue, the boy may not understand or may feel frustrated with his own virility. 
Because neither girls nor boys understand their sexuality as much as they should, it comes back to harm them in emotional, mental, physical, and especially social ways. Censoring sex education programs may make adults feel more comfortable, but the fact is the majority of teenagers will have sex at some point in their lives. By not giving them all of the facts, educators are only doing students a disservice that could affect their sexuality forever.

As United States Senator James Inhofe (R-Okla.) throws snowballs on the Senate floor to prove that climate change doesn’t exist, California is facing a climate change crisis. Dry weather coupled with warmer than average winters have depleted the State’s water supplies to dangerous levels. 
Last week, California Governor Jerry Brown enacted tough water use regulations, essentially aiming to reduce the water use of Californians by 25 percent. The restrictions target urban water use most heavily, and critics point out that the restrictions don’t address water use by the agricultural industry at all. 
Gov. Brown has defended the restrictions, pointing out that California Agriculture provides a social good — food for much of the country — while the restrictions target water use with little social value, such as long showers and aesthetic landscaping. 
It’s true: There is a fundamental difference between using water to grow crops, which feeds people and adds to the economy, and using water to win the coveted title of “Greenest Lawn in Beverly Hills,” which comes with a lifetime supply of self-righteousness and the ability to silence the lurking suspicion that your worth as a person has little to do with the hue of your lawn.
However, California agriculture is not the bastion to California’s economy that defenders claim it is, and California’s drought cannot be successfully managed without demanding of agriculture the same austerity demanded of citizens and other businesses. 
In California, the agricultural industry accounts for 80 percent of water use, which leaves just 20 percent to everyone else, including citizens and other industries. Choosing to restrict the water use of the people already using the least amount of water is the equivalent to getting your meal supersized at McDonald's and offsetting the extra calories by getting a diet soda. Sure, a diet soda is “healthier” calorie-wise, but once you set foot in McDonald's, you’ve abandoned any pretense that your body is a living thing with delicate nutritional needs. 
Furthermore, agriculture accounts for only 2 percent of California’s economy. California bankrupting its water supplies to accommodate for agriculture’s water consumption is not unlike a family taking out a second mortgage to pay for their goldfish’s costly arthritis medication. Sure, the family will by 2 percent less happy if Grumpy the Goldfish can’t swim around as gleefully as in his youth, but is it really worth going into crippling debt? Besides, Grumpy won’t remember the sacrifice you’ve made for him in three seconds anyway. 
Joking aside, nobody is suggesting that California abandon its agricultural industry to get through this drought. California’s economy might be able to survive it, but California exports more food to the rest of the country and to the world than any other state. 
Still, there are reasonable steps that the industry can take to reduce water consumption. For instance, nearly half of California farmers still use the “flood irrigation” method to water crops, even though there are far more water-efficient irrigation methods available. Additionally, California has in recent years invested heavily in notoriously water-inefficient crops such as almonds, broccoli, and alfalfa. Returning to more water-efficient crops will allow the industry to reduce water consumption without downsizing production. 
Why should students at Carnegie Mellon care? Well first of all, if you eat, as students occasionally do if they have the time, you are probably eating something from California. This means that a sad, stinky child in Fresno has to skip showers to accommodate your insatiable hunger for almonds, you monster. California agriculture has been exempted from water restrictions because of our demand for California products. 
But more generally, California’s water restrictions are emblematic of how problems in America tend to be addressed these days. Our solutions nibble around the edges and place the blame on the powerless, instead of expecting the powerful forces actually causing the problems to lead the charge in solving them. 
I think Californians who use 20 percent of the state’s water can reasonably be expected to make sacrifices in their water consumption. But shouldn’t the industry using the lion’s share of the water be expected to do the lion’s share of the conservation? 
Though a small factor of the state’s economy, agriculture is a major political power in California. The industry was one of the largest donors to Brown’s campaign. In a slightly different context, giving a politician money in exchange for political favor is called “bribery.” At their most innocuous, Brown’s water restrictions will prove ineffective. At their worst, they are the product of legalized corruption. Californians should demand that their governor represents their interests, not just the interests of his donors.

You would think that an organization called Autism Speaks would be dedicated to sharing the stories of people with autism, that it would try to improve educational resources for people with autism and help others understand the need to treat autistic individuals with dignity and respect, even in instances where communication is difficult. 
Instead, Autism Speaks seems determined to become the blue to the Susan G. Komen Memorial Foundation’s pink. Last year, the Susan G. Komen Memorial Foundation partnered with an oil company and announced that they had painted a drill bit pink. How does a charity supposedly dedicated to fighting cancer support the extraction of thousands of barrels of carcinogens? 
Simple! They’re not actually interested in fighting cancer. A very small fraction of the money they make goes towards research or care; most is spent on ads to “raise awareness” and running the foundation, which includes expenses such as high salaries for its directors.
According to a fact sheet issued by the Autistic Self Advocacy Network, a negligible amount of money raised by Autism Speaks goes towards actually benefiting people who have autism. Only 4 percent of the millions of dollars they raise each year has a direct impact on the lives of autistic individuals and their families. 
It is worth noting that they put 44 percent of their funds into research, but they are largely focused on finding “cures” for autism or genetic markers that with current genetic therapies would only allow the early termination of an autistic fetus. Their research also includes examining Omega-3 fatty acids as a potential tool in boosting the social skills of autistic children, which sounds more like a fad diet than a legitimate attempt at improving the lives of people with autism. 
Numerous organizations have also spoken out against the way that Autism Speaks characterizes individuals with autism, saying it relies too heavily on depicting the people it claims to be helping as pathetic and notable mainly for being a drain on the lives of their family members. 
Amy Sequenzia, a blogger at the Autism Women’s Network, who herself has Autism, goes so far as to characterize Autism Speaks as a hate group and runs through the definitions provided by both the FBI and Southern Poverty Law Center to make her argument. 
While there are, of course, benefits to be had from researching the causes and mechanisms behind autism, if you are going to give to an organization this Autism Awareness Month, consider donating to an organization that spends more money on improving the lives of people with autism rather than giving them fish oil.

If you haven’t been keeping up with the news, Rolling Stone published an article last November that stirred a national conversation across college campuses about sexual assault. The article detailed a harrowing account of a University of Virginia student named Jackie and her gang rape at a campus fraternity house.
On Sunday, April 5, Rolling Stone retracted the article.
It didn’t take long for reporters and readers alike to question Jackie’s account detailed in the original article. In December, Rolling Stone’s managing editor Will Dana stated, “In the face of new information, there now appear to be discrepancies in Jackie’s account, and we have come to the conclusion that our trust in her was misplaced.”
The original story has since been taken down from the magazine’s website. In its place is the Columbia University Graduate School of Journalism’s report captioned: “An anatomy of a journalistic failure.”.
Rolling Stone has ultimately shaped the story as a failure to engage in basic journalistic practice. The writer of the article, Sabrina Rubin Erdely, defended herself: “I allowed my concern for Jackie’s well-being, my fear of re-traumatizing her, and my confidence in her credibility to take the place of more questioning and more facts. These are mistakes I will not make again.” 
I have only a few things to say about Erdely’s statements: We should show concern for sexual assault survivors and consider them credible. Erdely indeed failed as a journalist by not questioning and fact-checking with other sources, but her statement can have repercussions for many sexual assault survivors and their treatment by the media. It’s important to listen to survivors and be supportive. Any writer can do this while maintaining their journalistic principles.
The report published by Columbia University’s journalism school also details how Erdely could have potentially built a story around other survivors’ accounts, but felt that Jackie’s story would draw in more readers. “A Rape on Campus” is one of Rolling Stone’s most popular recent stories. But you cannot, and shouldn’t even try to, rank or compare traumatic experiences.
Aside from the journalistic failures, I fear what effect this retraction will have at a greater scale. As news that Rolling Stone retracted the article broke Sunday night, I watched Facebook posts pop up under the “University of Virginia” trending feed. One read, “It would be good if this Jackie woman could be locked away in prison," and another seconded that “the university and fraternity have had their reputations ruined.” 
Sure, the university and the fraternity have had a blow to their reputations. People have vandalized and attacked the fraternity in question, and the university’s administration has scrambled to keep up with the backlash. But that’s not the point; people are forgetting the initial discussion that started in response to Jackie’s account.
Sexual assault was and still is a serious problem on college campuses. In 2013, there were 15 reported on-campus sexual assaults at the University of Virginia. At Carnegie Mellon, the number of reported on-campus assaults has more than tripled from 2011 to 2013. 
When the Rolling Stone article was published, other survivors from all around the country came forward to share their stories. The nation had finally turned its attention to the issue of on-campus sexual assaults, but now it seems that the nation has lost interest.
Campus assaults are still underreported and survivors still need support. We’ve made progress as a campus with the ever-growing Survivor Support Network (SSN) and the work of the administration. To some, the Rolling Stone catastrophe is the end of it, but it really isn’t. We can’t let the discussion die down just as it’s beginning.

The student diversity forums this week, hosted by senior global studies and Hispanic studies double major Juan Acosta, were a significant student-led effort to approach an important campus issue. 
Acosta, after publishing an opinion piece in The Tartan expressing his concerns, planned the events in response to unsatisfactory diversity solutions proposed by University administration during Town Hall meetings for the new Strategic Plan. The focus of the forums was to broadly discuss diversity, its implications, and the ways in which Carnegie Mellon can be more diverse.
One of the keywords of the Strategic Plan is "transformative experience," but a transformative experience needs to include diversity. Racial diversity is limited at Carnegie Mellon, and students at the forum discussed diversity not only in terms of race, but also of socioeconomic background, family structure, sexual orientation, mental health, and educational history. 
Individuals come to Carnegie Mellon to learn and grow, but that growth is stunted if they never meet a person with a background different from their own.
Faculty and staff, many from the Department of Student Affairs, attended the events and were encouraged to listen. Students discussed their experiences with diversity and proposed suggestions for the administration. The suggestions and concerns will be included in a letter to the university administration, in the hopes of adding strategies to the Strategic Plan for encouraging diversity . 
These measures are not limited to recruitment or admissions; the forum also discussed measures that support students and encourage them to feel comfortable on campus. Suggestions included mental health support, disability resources, and changes in financial aid policy.
The Tartan supports the student diversity forums and believes that Carnegie Mellon students should make an effort to participate in the discussion. In particular, an outline of student suggestions will show administrators that students want to contribute to the effort and be part of the discussion about diversity on campus.

In a story in The Wall Street Journal on Tuesday, Miriam Jordan wrote that since the recession began in 2008, food pantries have been increasing in number on college campuses. 
This willingness to make college living easier and more accessible to students is commendable for many reasons. Food security can be a problem for college students, who often do not have the available resources to afford both cost of living and a college education. Food pantries are an ideal way to solve this problem.
With the cost of tuition, room, board, and textbooks soaring in recent years, it has become increasingly difficult to afford college. To make things worse, the economic recovery has taken the form of upwards redistribution. People who were already well off are starting to get back to and beyond those levels, while everyone else struggles to recoup their losses from the economic collapse. 
This means a college education is even more inaccessible to low income and even middle class families than previously. As a result, many college students are left to cover both tuition and the cost of living on their own, since their families are unable to help. 
Unable to both support themselves and continue a college education, many students are forced to drop out of college. Even scholarships, which reduce the burden of tuition, often do not cover the cost of living expenses.
A college education is extremely helpful for upward mobility. The ability for people to succeed despite their family’s economic status is important; it both allows for an equal playing field in society and a larger number of capable and qualified people to enter the workforce. 
For this reason, a college education should never be impossible because someone lacks the financial resources to achieve one. Financial aid is good for this, but it doesn’t always go far enough. 
At Carnegie Mellon, where tuition is among the highest in the country, this issue is especially pressing. Food pantries allow for access to an important resource and reduce another barrier to a college education — that’s better for everyone.

"Is it Carnival yet?" touts the popular Carnegie Mellon student-made website. 
"Almost — but it's never too early to pregame."
Thus begins the mythic, magical time of Carnival. The four-day holiday weekend is arguably the most discussed part of Carnegie Mellon's culture. Students treat the weekend as a chance to participate in a "real" college lifestyle — binge-drinking, experimenting with drugs, and partying until the early hours of the morning. While the break is certainly a welcome respite from the normally grueling school year, students should reevaluate how they spend their free time during Carnival.
Administrators and student leaders work hard to fill the four days with a slew of events, from buggy races to networking events to shows. While alumni and families visiting their students (both from the local Pittsburgh community and from afar) take advantage of these activities and embrace Carnival for all that it truly is, students too often miss out on the early morning rolls and late night concerts because they're preoccupied with taking advantage of the time off to get their party on.
"Is it Carnival yet?"
"Almost — but it's not like you'll remember it anyway."
The crazed partying is an undeniable part of the Carnival lifestyle; after all, it's a celebration of the student body. But what shouldn't be a part of Carnival is blacking out, getting sick, overindulging, and wasting valuable time that should be spent enjoying all that our school (in its most relaxed, enjoyable state) can offer. 
The Tartan urges students all over campus to consider how they budget their time this Carnival. Spend time relaxing, and partying if that is how you relax, but don't forget that there's so much going on besides the endless parties. 
There's a Scotch'n'Soda show, the Shot for Shot film festival, buggy rolls every morning, and more. Go out, explore the other side of Carnival, connect with alumni, and balance yourself. 
"is it Carnival yet?"
"Almost — but it makes Carnegie Mellon worth it."
