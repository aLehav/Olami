Back in the beginning of October, the Carnegie Mellon men’s soccer team seemed to be in cruise control. Having gone an impressive 8–0 in the first month of the season and being ranked as high as No. 2 in the nation, the Tartans looked like they would continue to improve on the successes of the year before. But a tough schedule, injuries, and other unexpected setbacks foiled the Tartans’ aspirations for reaching the NCAA Division III men’s soccer tournament for a third consecutive year.
With a brand new soccer field and a glorious 2009 season to build on, the Tartans had plenty of momentum before the season even began. The big question was how the team would cope with having lost 11 key seniors.
In the first game of the season, the Tartans were able to pull off a convincing 3–0 win against Washington & Jefferson College. The new look-the forward trio of juniors Kyle Young and Brad Edelman– and sophomore Alex Abedian looked like a deadly combination up top, but the main story was the notable performances of first-years Max Tassano, Scott Gerfen, and Matt Sarett in their college season. Sarett had a solid performance in the midfield, and Tassano and Gerfen were both able to notch their first career goals.
The Cardinal and Gray continued its dominance and went on to win the Carnegie Mellon Radisson Invitational Tournament. The team then faced a tough five-game road streak that included games in Colorado and Illinois. Impressively, the Tartans were able to wrap up the first month of the season with a perfect record, but the demanding early season road tests took a lot out of the team.
Injuries forced sophomore key starter John Crawshaw out for the majority of the rest of the season, and other starters like sophomore Zach Stahl and Edelman were forced out of the lineup due to knocks as well.
The turning point of the season came in the first week that the Tartans began University Athletic Association (UAA) conference play. The Tartans first traveled to Chicago, where they suffered a surprise first loss of the season against the University of Chicago in overtime. A week later, the Tartans had to face top-rated Washington University (Mo.) at home but failed to come up with the big win, and instead picked up only their second home loss in two years. 
With a number of first-years filling in as a result of Carnegie Mellon’s injury and suspension problems, experience was definitely lacking when it came down to the demanding conference games. The Tartans managed to win just one of four UAA games that had gone into overtime but never lost by more than a single goal. Despite a valiant effort late in the season against nationally ranked University of Rochester and an upset against Emory University, the Tartans came up short of reaching the postseason.
Although disappointed to not have achieved some of their preseason goals, the Carnegie Mellon men’s soccer team has a bright future ahead. With a large first-year class coming in, it was quite clear that this was going to be a bit of a transitional year for Carnegie Mellon. However, the underclassmen were was able to pick up a plethora of experience with Tassano, Sarret, and first-year Chris Wysocki showing much promise in the years ahead. 
Overall, Carnegie Mellon finished the season with a strong 11–4–1 record and sixth in the UAA conference. Expect to see a revitalized side next year as they will once again prove to be a force not only in the UAA conference, but on a national level as well.
“It was just as exciting as it was disappointing,” Abedian said. “Disappointing because of the few critical close losses, but it’s also going to be exciting to see the young talent we had this year mature into a great team next year.”

The Carnegie Mellon women’s basketball team hosted the Radisson Classic tournament last Friday and Saturday. The Tartans gained a 55–50 win against Earlham College on Friday, but fell to the Muskingum University Fighting Muskies 64–54 on Saturday.
The women’s team seems to be off to a good start with 10 players returning to the lineup, two of which are juniors who missed 60 percent of last year’s games. Coach Gerri Seidl also shares their sense of optimism. “We truly feel we have a stronger core and more all-around depth with the maturity of our upperclassmen and the additions,” she said. One such player, junior Jacki Cortese, is certainly making her presence felt. In the home opener against the Quakers, Cortese managed to record a double-double, with 13 points and 13 rebounds. Sophomore post player Emily Peel anchored the offense and led the team in scoring with a team high of 17 points and 12 rebounds.
Facing a 27–22 deficit at halftime, the Tartans came roaring out in the second half with an 8–2 run to earn the lead for good with 16:22 left in regulation. Peel had six of those points, including an impressive back layup. Carnegie Mellon would later increase the lead to as much as 13, while led by players such as junior post Jennifer Larsen. The Tartans also spread the court by assisting on 14 baskets with junior Alex Hansen leading the team with five assists and sophomore Tori Baggio adding four.
In Saturday’s game against the Fighting Muskies, Carnegie Mellon lost by a score of 64–54, bringing the team’s overall season record to 1–2. Cortese once again led the women’s offense with 18 points and four rebounds, leading her to be named to the All-Tournament team. 
“The team has worked hard to develop chemistry on the court behind the leadership of captains Jess Buranovsky and Jacki Cortese,” Seidl said.
The Tartans followed closely behind the Muskies at the break with a 29–27 deficit after the Muskies scored off a late offensive surge, raking in seven key offensive rebounds and converting eight Tartan turnovers into 10 points. However, the team seemed to lose momentum after five minutes into the second half, falling into a double-digit deficit. Larsen managed to rack up 14 points and eight rebounds, while first-year point guard Gina Tudi spread the court and collected six assists.The Tartans hope to continue to improve their game during this Tuesday’s home match against Grove City College at 7 p.m. in Skibo Gym.

The season for Carnegie Mellon men’s and women’s cross country teams came to an exciting close last Saturday. The Tartans competed at the NCAA Division III Championships in Waverly, Iowa, hosted by Wartburg College. For the men, this was the team’s sixth time attending nationals. They took 20th overall, just four points behind the Claremont-Mudd-Scripps Colleges.
In the 8k course, senior Nate Bussiere ran the fastest for the Tartans, finishing in 25:22.2 and making 67th place. He was followed by seniors J.P. Allera and Dan Addis with times of 25:26.6 and 25:30.7, respectively, coming in 75th and 82nd overall. Fourth for the Tartans was junior Matt Jacob, who picked up 134th place in 25:57.9. Jacob was trailed by sophomore Evan Gates, who took 147th with a time of 26:07.6. The final two finishers for Carnegie Mellon were senior Justin Kurp and first-year Mike Standish, with times of 26:25.4 and 26:27.0, who came in 177th and 182nd respectively.
Only two ladies from the Carnegie Mellon cross country team were sent to the NCAA Championships: sophomore Emily Wobb and senior Courtney Baker. Wobb took 62nd overall out of 279 competitors, with a time of 22:07.9. 
This was a huge improvement from last year, when she placed 120th overall. Baker also had a great performance, finishing 74th overall in 22:14.6.

For the average Carnegie Mellon student, life can be quite the balancing act. Between academics and extracurricular activities, staying focused can be difficult. Adding a varsity sport to the mix can often tip the scales for many students.
Courtney Baker, a senior chemical and biomedical engineering double major, has mastered the art of balancing many activities. As a co-captain of the varsity cross country team, key member of the varsity track team, and co-president of the Carnegie Mellon chapter of Engineers Without Borders (EWB), Baker is pulled in many directions. The key to keeping herself on track is to stay motivated and focused by keeping an ultimate end goal in sight.
For her senior cross country season, Baker’s ultimate goal was to make it to the NCAA Division III Cross Country Championships. Initially solely a track runner, Baker joined the cross country team in her sophomore year to help improve her time in the 400-meter dash. She soon fell in love with the competitive nature of the sport and the camaraderie of the team. Baker continued the sport, and pushed herself to reach her goal of competing at the national level. She achieved her goal this season, competing in the Championship this past Saturday, and achieving a personal record of 22:14.6 in the 6k.
Baker excels in her other activities by keeping the same sense of focus and motivation. As co-president of EWB, she is an integral part of setting the major goals for the chapter. After attending a regional workshop in Boston, Baker became passionate about the organization’s mission, and wanted to be part of its future. 
“I thought it was a great organization, and a great way to use my engineering skills to help people in developing countries,” she said. Given a common problem — lack of water in a small village in Ecuador, for example — Baker and her team work to develop an efficient solution. Achieving the final goal of implementing a working, sustainable solution — in this case, a water catchment system — can be challenging, but is ultimately worthwhile.
Whether in her extracurricular activities, athletics, or academics, Baker states that “it is important to be focused and know that what you’re doing has a purpose.” This strategy will certainly help her succeed in the future.

The Carnegie Mellon swimming and diving teams finished another strong weekend, both at home and away. The diving team hosted the Carnegie Mellon Diving Invite last Friday and Saturday, competing against Washington & Jefferson College and University Athletic Association (UAA) opponent the University of Rochester. The swim team traveled to Lancaster, Pa., on Saturday to compete at the Franklin and Marshall College Quad meet, where it faced the Franklin and Marshall Diplomats, the University of Rochester Yellowjackets and the Washington and Lee Generals.
The diving team set the tone for the week starting off Friday in the Carnegie Mellon dive tank. The Tartans had a great performance overall. On the men’s side, junior Eli Fatsi finished first in the men’s one-meter 11 dives with a score of 375.40, topping the next closest diver by over 15 points. Fatsi also finished third in the men’s three-meter 11 dives with a score of 383.15. A similarly outstanding performance was seen from junior Mike Alexovich, who had a high score of 428.90 in the men’s three-meter 11 dives. Alexovich’s performance could not be matched by the second-place diver, who had a score of 384.60.
The Carnegie Mellon women’s diving team had similar success with an exceptional performance by junior Olivia Defazio. Defazio’s scores were only outdone by a diver from Washington & Jefferson, who set a pool record on the one-meter board. Defazio placed a close second in both the women’s one-meter and three-meter dives.
On Saturday, the men’s and women’s swimming teams continued their winning trend at the quad meet. The women’s team had an excellent performance, topping Franklin and Marshall 164–93, Washington and Lee 158–99, and UAA foe Rochester 163–94. 
The Tartans started off strong by winning the 200-yard medley relay with a score of 1:51.51. The relay team was comprised of first-year Soleil Phan, sophomore Breanna Stillo, first-year Megan Garvey, and senior Brianne Burton. Individual successes were also plentiful, as Stillo finished first in the 100-yard breaststroke with a time of 1:07.57, and first-years Vivian Wong and Tatiana Duchak finished second and third, respectively. Wong was able to win the 200-yard breaststroke, and Burton grabbed a win in the 50-yard freestyle. Senior Molly Evans contributed to the Tartans’ performance with a big win in the 1,000-yard freestyle race with a time of 10:27.53.
The Tartan men’s swimming team triumphed as well, topping Washington & Jefferson 219–43, Washington & Lee University 153–109, and Rochester 203–59. The men began with a win in the 200-yard medley relay. The relay team consisted of sophomore Dan Glaser-Garbrick, first-years Seijean Gahng and Terrence Wong, and junior Matt Stanton. Glaser-Garbrick pulled an individual win in the 200-yard IM. Other first-place finishes included first-year Josh Chen in the 200-yard freestyle and sophomore Brandon Yee in the 200-yard butterfly.
“There was not as much energy as last week; however, we still swam well. The men’s and women’s teams both won, so I’d say overall success,” senior Frank Olechnowicz said, reflecting on the team win and his individual win in the 1,000-yard freestyle.
The Tartans have seen a lot of success so far this season. They are now focusing on and working toward the Nike Cup Invitational, which will be held on Dec. 2–4 at Kenyon College in Gambier, Ohio.

After a successful start to the season, the Carnegie Mellon Ultimate Frisbee team, “Mr. Yuk,” traveled to Poolesville, Md., to compete in the 32-team Colonial Ultimate Frisbee Festival (CUFF) and secured a third-place title after three rigorous days of play. Mr. Yuk competed alongside a few of the best teams on the East Coast, such as Penn State University, New York University, Georgetown University, University of Maryland, Rutgers University, and the College of William and Mary. After initially being seeded 18th and going 3–0 in the pools, the Mr. Yuk managed to complete a run of 3–1 in their last tournament of the season.
“Mr. Yuk has struggled with an identity crisis in the past few years. We were a team that considered ourselves great but did not have the performance on the field to show for it, but now we do,” said Scott Shepard, the Ultimate team’s treasurer.
In the championship bracket, Mr. Yuk faced Rutgers University and easily breezed past the Scarlet Knights 13–6, after commanding a lead the entire match.
The quarterfinal round of the CUFF tournament proved to be Mr. Yuk’s biggest match yet. The Tartans went head-to-head against the University of Delaware and emerged victorious 12–11, after scoring under pressure on universe point, 11–11.
Despite a valiant effort, Mr. Yuk lost a close match in the semifinals to Millersville University, a national contender last year. They earned redemption in the playoff round for third place, winning their second universe point match 10–9 after rallying back and forth the entire match. With this victory, Mr. Yuk was able to beat the team’s 18th-seed expectation for its best CUFF tournament ever.
“People outside our section do not know who Mr. Yuk is or what CMU Ultimate is capable of. For the second year in a row, we were under-seeded, and this year we got serious and came close to winning the whole thing,” Shepard said. “We placed third out of 32 teams, beating teams we were not supposed to beat. This tournament will get us noticed and hopefully land us some more competitive spots in the spring. I am glad that Mr. Yuk is finally performing as well as we did at CUFF, but we have a long way to go to be where we need to be. As well as we did, we need to do better. I can’t wait for spring.”

It was August 2007. The famous quarterback of the Atlanta Falcons, otherwise known as Michael Vick, had just pleaded guilty to illegal dog-fighting charges, which would keep him in jail for almost two years. Vick, considered to be the most exciting player in the NFL, had already led the Falcons to two playoff appearances, and it seemed like he would continue his NFL success. Then the “Bad Newz Kennel” was found, and as Vick’s life went to shambles, he became one of the most-hated celebrities in all of sports.
No one knows how Vick’s time in prison was. I assume it was just as terrible as I think prison would be, especially for a celebrity. Apparently Vick was given no preferential treatment. He had to hire a Mexican gang to keep himself safe from the other inmates. People across America cracked jokes about his situation. The People for Ethical Treatment of Animals, otherwise known as PETA, continued to tarnish Vick’s already-soiled image by criticizing him daily. People debated whether or not Vick’s promising career was already finished. But that’s not the end of the story.
Fast-forward to August 2009, when Vick was reinstated to the NFL. After being overlooked by a high majority of NFL teams, he signed a one-year contract with the Philadelphia Eagles, which included a team option for a second year. In 2009, the Eagles played Vick mostly out of special formations, but he barely got any snaps in the game. The year finished with Vick a mere afterthought in the minds of NFL fans.
Moving on to 2010, Vick was the No. 2 quarterback on the Philadelphia roster, backing up the inexperienced Kevin Kolb. Soon enough, Kolb got hurt, and Vick was thrust into the starting role in one of the toughest cities to play for. Throughout the country, people were expecting Vick to show that he had lost it all in prison and wouldn’t ever be the player he once was. Yet, he proved that he had somehow become even better. In week two against the Detroit Lions, Vick posted an efficient game where he threw for 284 yards and two touchdowns. 
Coach Andy Reid then named him the starter for the next week, and he didn’t disappoint, leading the Eagles to another victory with almost 300 passing yards and three touchdowns. However, nothing compared to his game just last week against the Washington Redskins on Monday Night Football. The lefty quarterback posted one of the best games in recent memory, as he threw for 333 yards, ran for another 80, and scored a whopping six touchdowns. The final score was 59–28 in favor of the Eagles, and it wasn’t even that close. And as I watched that game, I couldn’t help but think to myself, “Man, this guy is a hero.”
In fact, Vick is a hero. He’s a hero to those who  make mistakes in their lives and aren’t sure if they can’t get back up. You don’t see many people going from star to felon to star once again. If anything, stars get excused for their mistakes, such as Kobe Bryant and Ray Lewis, who were both charged for felonies and worked out plea deals. Vick did his hard time, and now he’s back, right where he left off. He could have just faded into the sunset, accepted that he made a mistake, and cemented his legacy as wasted talent. But no, Vick worked hard not only to return to the NFL, but also to clean up his image, as he continues to do charity work and speak about the horrors of dog fighting.
Some may say that he does this because he has to, or that his act is all fake. Bad people cannot change, they all say. I’ve had enough of people putting him down, especially when he has done his time and has been given a second chance. Vick has suffered through things that people may not be able to even imagine. Yet he goes onto the field and gives it all every week now, and you will never hear a peep of complaint from him about the past.
He has accepted his punishment and is working to move on. Vick has done everything right in the media, specifically his relationship with Kolb and their roles on the team. He has repeatedly said that he is okay with any decision that Reid makes about the quarterback controversy, showing poise not only on the field, but also off. It seems that he accepts the blessings that have been given to him, and he’s there to take what he can get with his hard work and effort, and that is something to admire.
It isn’t every day that we can find such an inspiring story in sports, especially one that is this much of a roller-coaster ride. Star to prison to star once again? Usually that equation ends during prison. But not for Vick, as he shows us what he is really made of. I’m sure that there are millions of people out there that will never forgive him for what he has done. But contrary to popular belief, it’s time to start looking at Vick — not as a criminal, but as a role model.

If baseball had a crystal ball — and I’m sure there’s someone out there who’s made one — it would most likely be diamond-encrusted and covered with the logos of each World Series winner. If you knew the right words to utter, you could look into it every off-season and see which players will switch uniforms come Opening Day.
MLB.com Shop, I believe I’ve just found your new Christmas bestseller. Without looking into any crystal ball, one already has an idea of how the 2010–11 off-season will shape up. Unlike the hype surrounding the NBA’s 2010 off-season, it looks like one of baseball’s big questions this winter will be about who will be taking his talents from South Beach. The Florida Marlins have already traded second baseman Dan Uggla — to divisional rival Atlanta — along with trading former future stars Andrew Miller and Cameron Maybin. Both Miller and Maybin were the centerpieces of the Marlins’ deal with the Tigers during their last fire sale, when they traded pitcher Dontrelle Willis and third baseman Miguel Cabrera to Detroit.
Don’t expect Florida to be done dealing, either. Florida has been known to have fire sales every few off-seasons, usually coming after a successful year. After winning the World Series in 1997, the Marlins infamously traded away catcher Charles Johnson, first baseman Jeff Conine, third baseman Bobby Bonilla, shortstop Edgar Renteria, outfielders Moises Alou and Gary Sheffield, starting pitchers Al Leiter and Kevin Brown, and closer Robb Nen. They then proceeded to finish with the worst record in baseball in 1998 at 54–108. After winning the 2003 World Series, the Marlins spent their next few off-seasons dismantling their winning team again, and although they were only an 80–82 ball club in 2010, it looks like team owner Jeffrey Loria and his crew have deemed it time to rebuild again.
A Marlin guaranteed to garner trade offers is ace Josh Johnson, who, if healthy, could help push many contenders out of the role of also-ran and into the role of champion. Starters Anibal Sanchez, Chris Volstad, and Ricky Nolasco are all contenders to wear new uniforms come 2011, with Nolasco the most likely of that bunch to be traded. They all possess the talent and potential for greatness, and the only question will be how much a team is willing to give up for that potential. 2009 Rookie of the Year (ROY) Chris Coghlan (outfield) and 2010 ROY contender Gaby Sanchez (first base) could find themselves on different teams soon enough; however, it’s unlikely that either will be traded until at least next year. Coghlan is coming off an injury-shortened campaign, and Sanchez only has one year of Major League experience, so the Marlins will want to wait for the players’ values to go up before using them as trade bait.
A year ago, the big question on the trade market was whether or not the Padres’ big bopper Adrian Gonzalez would find a new home in 2010. Despite heavy rumors to the contrary, Gonzalez stayed in San Diego and helped lead the Pads almost to a division title that once seemed firmly in their grasp. Don’t expect Gonzalez to be moved this winter; after signing manager Bud Black to an extension, the Padres now seem committed to building up and winning with the squad they have, and Gonzalez is the centerpiece of that crew.
While this off-season will no doubt be defined by where pitcher Cliff Lee signs, there are a few other free agents that will warrant nearly as much attention. There will still be 29 teams that don’t sign Cliff Lee, and look for trades to be the big difference-makers come April 2011. Florida, I offer you my condolences now.

The word “beauty” typically instills images of graceful paint strokes, flower blossoms, or sunny smiles. Cold metal and precise calculations are not classic conceptions of beauty, but there are those who find the cooperation of mechanical parts to be the most “beautiful” thing there is. Ray Barsa, a senior mechanical engineering major, cuts metal and builds machine pieces for Caterpillar, Inc., but contemplates the use of his talents on robots that will traverse the outer reaches of our solar system.
Barsa’s workshop is full of metal-cutting machines with blades of all shapes and sizes: circular blades, and spinning cylindrical blades, vertical blades with perforated edges. He spends his time dividing pieces of metal and screwing them together to make mounts for sensors that detect where other Caterpillar bulldozers are in relation to each other, and where their workers are.
“I cut pieces of metal that act as an interface between sensors and machines. I have to come up with ways to mount the sensors efficiently,” Barsa said while cutting aluminum with a band saw. “The mount I’m making has to hold the sensor device securely, make sure it doesn’t rattle itself to death, and can be replaced easily.” One miscalculation at a scale of one tenth of an inch may cause sensors to overlook a human being, which could result in severe injury or death to the worker. Barsa makes several prototypes like these by hand and passes them on to higher authorities in Caterpillar’s research department. “It’ll be about one in every 10 projects that my division does that works its way into the machines,” he said.
However, Barsa’s real passion lies in the development of robots that will travel to the moon and Mars. His work mounting sensors for Caterpillar machines is juxtaposed with research projects at Carnegie Mellon that develop rovers to crawl across the moon. He has participated in Carnegie Mellon research teams composed of faculty and graduate students with goals of developing space rovers that can sense their surroundings and speed up communication between space and ground control. Barsa is already accomplished in his field; he has published papers, written grant proposals, placed in prestigious robotics competitions, and worked at a graduate level since he was a first-year.
“The research [at Carnegie Mellon] is cutting edge and promising for space robots,” he said. “If robots are going to be more valuable than humans in space, they need to be autonomous.” This is where engineers come in.
Currently, robots alert ground control when they encounter an obstacle. When ground control receives information that a rover has encountered a blockage as simple as a rock, it sends instructions about how to respond back to space and then wait for confirmation that the instructions were carried out. Each leg of this communication — robot to Earth, Earth to robot, robot back to Earth — takes six minutes if the robot is on Mars and three minutes if on the moon. As a result, mission controllers on earth can only draw up a plan each morning for how many centimeters the robot will cover in a day. Then they can only wait for problems to come their way.
Barsa’s goal is to develop robots that do not need to wait for six-minute-delayed commands from Earth. Carnegie Mellon specializes in path planning and sensor development, which would give robots the tools to immediately respond and interact with their surroundings. 
Robots such as these can be used in numerous different ways.  They can react instantaneously to the sensory information they gain by shooting lasers into the world around them. They could act on their own, gathering samples, researching outer space, without the constant guidance of humans. They could also not only navigate through our living rooms, vacuuming and sweeping, but could also wash windows or move furniture. With this technology, we could manufacture robotic cars that drive for us, reducing accidents and making lives easier.
For now, Barsa’s big ideas are contained in his underground research lab and balanced by schooling and his job at Caterpillar. However, Barsa’s enthusiasm for the future is always present. “I feel like I’m good at it. I feel like I can make a difference. I can design things better than other people may,” he said. “This is one of the most objective things a person can do — if something’s off a thousandth of an inch, it doesn’t work — and I have a gift for it.”
While some people see beauty in the way a flower blossoms or in the colors in a sunset, Barsa sees beauty in the integration of man and machine into a single efficient system. “Robotics is the future.... We will need more systems automated to support larger populations. Having more robots around means humans have fewer monotonous tasks to do. They have such potential to change the world for the better.”
As the parts of the machines in his lab work together to cut metal, as that metal works with wires and coding to sense objects, as members of a team collaborate to build something amazing, robots of the future may work with humans to make our world a better place.

Many technologies that were only dreams of science fiction, such as the talking devices or the central communication network of the Borg on Star Trek, have become a reality, and one more invention is set to be realized. The long-awaited flying car has been given the green light by the United States government, specifically the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA), a subsidiary branch of the Pentagon. On Oct. 12, a DARPA press release detailed information about the start of the highly-anticipated Transformer (TX) program, a project that will “combine the advantages of ground vehicles and helicopters into a single vehicle equipped with flexibility of movement.” The government has given Carnegie Mellon University the opportunity to help build the world’s first flying car.
In a press release nearly a month later from Carnegie Mellon’s department of Media Relations, the Robots Institute was issued a grant of $980,000 to create an “autonomous flight system” for DARPA to be used in the TX program over the next 17 months. Also tapped to participate in the first phase of the project is Lockheed Martin Corporation — a Maryland-based securities company specializing in aeronautics, space, and information systems — and AAI Corporation — an aerospace and defense technologies company. The two companies will be collaborating with the Robotics Institute to develop the design aspect of the TX vehicle. Others asked to participate in the effort by DARPA are Pratt & Whitney Rocketdyne, Aurora Flight Sciences partnered with ThinGap, and Metis Design Corporation.
The focus of the Robotics Institute’s research is the control aspect of the car. According to a DARPA press release, TX performers will focus on “develop[ing] mature propulsion systems, adaptable wing structures, advanced lightweight materials, the advanced flight control system, the air/ground configuration designs, and energy distribution systems.”
One of the main leaders on the project for Carnegie Mellon is professor Sanjiv Singh, who is associated with the Robotics Institute as a research professor and the mechanical engineering department as an adjunct faculty member. Singh has both a master’s (’92) and doctorate (’95) in robotics from Carnegie Mellon. One main focus of his current research is autonomous navigation, which tackles the issue of “motion planning and real-time control for ground and air vehicles,” according to his website. This technology is currently being implemented in one of Singh’s projects, the Combat Medic UAV — a helicopter that can execute locating, landing, and extraction portions of a rescue mission in a semi-autonomous fashion.
“[It’s the] automation of a full-scale helicopter, and while it was done before the new project with DARPA started, the core technologies are relevant,” Singh said.
The TX vehicle would embody a similar technology and help the military avoid the threat of improvised explosive devices (IEDs), or roadside bombs, for short. Having car and helicopter capabilities would allow soldiers to traverse a multitude of unknown and dangerous landscapes with relative ease. The estimated specifications would allow such a flying car to carry four people and 1,000 pounds for 250 miles. In an article from Defense Technology International last April, the U.S. Marine Corps has already expressed interest in such a technology. One challenge faced by the researchers, however, is getting the adequate car and plane technologies up to snuff for battle; the car “must be driven like a Humvee while on the ground, rapidly reconfigure for flight, then change back for ground operations.” This is where the Robotics Institute comes in — the flying car must possess vertical take-off and landing technologies in order to be combat-suitable.
“In practical terms, that means the vehicle will need to be able to fly itself, or to fly with only minimal input from the operator,” Singh said in a Carnegie Mellon press release. “And this means that the vehicle has to be continuously aware of its environment and be able to automatically react in response to what it perceives.”
According to Singh, Carnegie Mellon was selected after responding to an open solicitation. “Carnegie Mellon had a strong proposal because we have a track record of successfully taking on challenging topics which require both innovation and engineering expertise,” he said.

Cooking is usually portrayed as an elaborate art. A measure of craft, a spoonful of inspiration, and a dash of creativity are combined in the creation of some of the finest pieces of culinary art. But in addition to the artistry, there is a lot of science behind the dishes — molecules interacting with other molecules, creating the combinations of taste and texture that hungry consumers appreciate the most. One professor at Carnegie Mellon has a base of knowledge in both culinary methods and the science behind it, so he decided to create a class to teach science through the art of cooking.
Subha Das, an assistant professor in the department of chemistry, has been enthusiastic about cooking nearly his whole life. When he’s not cooking, Das is researching the structure and function of nucleic acids — an activity that may seem completely different from cooking at first glance. He, however, argues that these two activities are synonymous. “As a practicing scientist in my lab, I’m an organic chemist. I’m synthesizing things, making things. I can do that because I have a good prior knowledge of the way those molecules work. But it’s no different than with food,” he said.
Das’ idea of teaching chemistry through cooking originated many years ago. With the support of his colleagues and department, he held his first chemistry and cooking class, titled “Kitchen Chemistry Sessions,” in the fall semester of 2009. He offered two slightly different renditions of the class — one for first-year non-science majors who had nearly zero background in organic chemistry, and one for students who already had substantial exposure to organic chemistry. The overall goal of the two classes was common: Teach chemistry by means of cooking.
“My idea is to teach chemistry using the context of food, and once you learn the chemistry and the underlying science principles, you can in fact be much more creative in what you do,” Das said. Students learned the scientific principles first, and then applied them by creating dishes they could try and share with other students. Keeping true to the similarities to working in a lab, all students were required to maintain a lab notebook. The class, which was designed to run for half a semester, covered numerous chemistry topics such as lipids, carbohydrates, and aroma-volatiles.
Sophomore chemistry major Alessandra Zimmermann said, “The focus of the class was on molecular gastronomy, which is basically the form of gastronomy that utilizes chemistry the most. And we did learn cooking techniques quite a bit, too.”
The course gave students some useful tricks for creating healthy foods with ease. In many instances, it is less convenient to make and eat healthy, nutritious foods; it takes more time, and in some cases, more money. Alternative, less-healthy foods usually have numerous chemicals added to them and undergo a lot of processing to give them the taste that people desire. Das’ class enabled students to create healthy foods that taste as good as processed ones. For example, one group of students made a chocolate-walnut milkshake with 2 percent milk instead of whole milk. Despite the low fat content of the milk used, their shake was very thick and creamy with the addition of xanthan gum as a thickener.
Zimmermann described another interesting class project. “We made fruit caviar, which is essentially just fruit juice mixed with a form of string polymer that forms a bubble; that was a very exciting class,” she said. “Also, our last class was on taste. So basically we just tasted lots of different things and [Das] explained to us how our body reacts to it.”
Sticking with non-traditional teaching methods, Das designed the final exam to be a student cook-off. Students were instructed to create a unique dish given basic guidelines on what types of ingredients their dish must contain. Their evaluation depended on the taste and appearance of their dish, as well as the science behind its creation. Das evaluated the dishes alongside a panel of other judges that consisted of various faculty members from the departments of chemistry, biological sciences, and art for a well-rounded perspective on the quality and creativity of the dishes.
The students were able to create interesting and scientifically intriguing dishes for the final, which was very pleasing to Das as the professor. Not only had the students successfully implemented chemical principles to create unique dishes, but they also showed that the science behind it actually enhanced the dishes. This was shown when the panelists’ approval of the dishes actually increased after the students explained the science that went into them.
When asked if she would recommend the class, Zimmermann stated, “I’d definitely recommend it to anyone who likes cooking, because it does expand your repertoire, and you learn a lot more about what you’re actually doing, instead of, ‘Let’s throw this together and hope it turns out okay.’ ”
According to a press release on www.cmu.edu, Das went on to present his successful idea at the 239th meeting of the American Chemical Society in San Francisco in March. Through this direct connection between science and food, Das was very satisfied with what he was able to teach and what the students were taking away from the course. “I can give students enough information to navigate the world that they’re in contact with. For me, that’s important. That’s the point of education,” he said.

Levitation — it’s a seemingly magical phenomenon by which an object elevates due to a flashy magician waving his hand. The question for today is: Can sound make things fly, too?
Sound is a physical phenomenon: It is composed of longitudinal, mechanical waves vibrating through air. Because sound waves are mechanical, they require a medium to travel through, such as a gas or a solid, and are made up of two alternating parts called compressions and rarefactions, according to www.tech-faq.com. A compression occurs when the air particles through which sound travels gather together, forming an area of high pressure, due to the high concentration of gas particles. Conversely, a rarefaction occurs between compressions and spreads out the gas particles, which forms into an area of low pressure.
A sound is created when a source pushes the first molecule in a wave, which in turn pushes and pulls particles around it in a cascading effect. The back-and-forth movement of a vibrating violin string pushes and pulls the air in such a way. Thus, sound travels by sending physical waves through the air that move the air's particles around. For sound to levitate an object, it must create regions of high pressure that push upward, negating the downward force of gravity, and hence making objects float.
To make this happen, sound needs to be transmitted through an acoustic levitator, which consists of two parts: a transducer, which is the source of the sound, and a reflector, which is a smooth surface that will reflect the emitted sound wave, according to www.HowStuffWorks.com. Both parts are usually concave, which helps focus the sound. The transducer faces up at the reflector, and the object floats in between them due to the sound wave emitted from the transducer.
To determine where an object will float between the transducer and reflector, one must examine the properties of the sound waves themselves. When the transducer produces a sound wave, the wave will travel upward through the air until it is reflected back by the reflector. When this happens, its areas of high pressure — compressions — and areas of low pressure — rarefactions — will interact with the compressions and rarefactions of the original wave. This occurrence is called interference, and it can be constructive, amplifying the sound, or destructive, decreasing or muting the sound completely. Areas of similar pressure, such as two overlapping compressions, will be augmented, while areas of disparate pressure, such as a compression overlapping a rarefaction, will negate one another.
The overall composition of the interferences between the original sound wave and its reflection forms a standing wave, which is simply the new waveform representing these interactions. The standing wave will have nodes, which are areas of minimum pressure, and antinodes, which are the areas of highest pressure. Places in between antinodes and nodes will experience constant upward pressure, which is the key to performing acoustic levitation. In these areas, which are usually just below the nodes, the upward pressure of the sound wave is exactly equal to the downward pull of gravity, thus making objects float, suspended in mid-air.
In order for an acoustic levitator to create pressure strong enough to fight gravity, it must use nonlinear sounds, which are high-intensity sounds that have effects much more powerful than ordinary sounds. Hence, acoustic levitators usually make sounds at levels of 150 decibels or more. Typical speaking level is 60 decibels, while a loud nightclub is about 110 decibels.
Acoustic levitation has been used in manufacturing very small electronics like microchips. In addition, handling corrosive or otherwise dangerous objects is easier using acoustic levitation, which scientists use to examine objects without being contaminated or their containers being destroyed.

Most people are familiar with how human skeletons look; perhaps they have seen one hanging in a classroom or in a medical documentary. The skeleton is highly moveable, with many joints that allow humans to perform rigorous activities such as gymnastics. A normal adult skeleton has a total of 206 bones, which are attached to muscles by tendons or to other bones by ligaments. However, one disease, fibrodysplasia ossificans progressiva, or FOP, causes tendons, ligaments, and muscle to turn into bone, forming a second skeleton that looks like sheets of bone.
An initial sign of FOP is myositis, which is a term that means an inflammation of the muscles. They are sometimes referred to as “flare-ups,” and they anticipate the conversion of tissue into bone. These flare-ups appear as large red lumps, and they may be warm and painful. For FOP patients, myositis can occur due to muscle trauma, such as damage sustained from a fall, invasive medical procedures, and even viral illnesses, according to www.disabled-world.com.
The first growth of extra bone, for most patients, occurs in the neck, spine, and shoulders, and growth continues over their lifetime to other parts of the body. When extra bone forms in joints, it causes immobility of the affected joint. FOP can also deform the spine, causing scoliosis, and fuse the jaw. If bone covers the ribcage, breathing can become difficult because expansion of the ribcage is severely inhibited. Eventually, FOP patients will become bedridden, usually when they are in their 30s, because bone growth will cause almost complete immobility.
People with FOP are usually born with malformed big toes, although it is not understood why this happens. However, the major symptoms of FOP do not appear at birth, but rather they appear slowly over the first two decades of life, according to Discovery Health. Doctors must take caution when diagnosing such a disease, since the presence of malformed big toes does not necessarily indicate the presence of a rare disease.
FOP can be diagnosed through extensive studies, including genetic testing and X-rays, which may detect abnormal bone formation. However, according to www.ucsfbenioffchildrens.org, the rate of FOP misdiagnosis is around 80 percent. Misdiagnosis can result in biopsies and other invasive procedures that result in extra bone growth. FOP is commonly diagnosed as cancer, tumors, and other diseases that cause abnormal bone growth.
The prevalence of such a disease is one in 1.64 million people worldwide, according to www.medscape.com, and is more common in females than in males. Genetic studies have shown that it is a dominant mutation: Humans have two copies of a gene, which dictate a person’s growth and development. For a dominant mutation, one mutation of a specific gene is enough to cause FOP.
Currently, no known treatment for FOP exists, but a number of drugs can alleviate symptoms. However, caution is still taken because FOP symptoms differ greatly among individuals, and the drugs have a specific purpose. For example, muscles that are being ossified, or turned into bone, can spasm; muscle relaxants can be given to decrease the spasms, but this does not reverse the process of ossification. Because bone growth can occur as a result of trauma, surgery to remove bone is not an option, as this may induce the growth of extra bone at the site of surgery.
Over the past few years, researchers have been looking into a natural chemical produced in sharks as a treatment for FOP. The chemical, called squalamine, can be found in the livers of numerous shark species, and it was first used as an antibiotic. However, it also reduces blood vessel formation in the site of its application. Squalamine is currently being tested on FOP patients.
While not much is known about this tragic disease, research will lead to insight into bone development and the viable treatment of various bone disorders.

Scientists discover new planet
A planet 2,000 light years from Earth has been discovered by scientists in Chile. The planet, which has a mass at least 1.25 times the mass of Jupiter, is circling a star named HIP 13044. While almost 500 exoplanets, or planets not from our solar system, have already been discovered in the Milky Way galaxy, the newly discovered planet is different because researchers believe it is not originally from the Milky Way galaxy. Scientists think it once belonged to a dwarf galaxy that our galaxy engulfed between 6 and 9 billion years ago.
The planet was discovered indirectly through its gravitational interaction with the star around which it revolves. This discovery is exciting because scientists have always speculated the existence of planets outside of our galaxy, but have never had concrete evidence until now. In addition, the planet predicts what the future of our solar system looks like. Our sun will eventually expand and engulf the first four planets of our solar system, leaving the giant gaseous planets; HIP 13044 has already undergone this expansion, and has a gaseous planet circling it.

Research underway on rising sea levels
The temperature of water measured in fjords of Greenland was 40 degrees Fahrenheit, which is warm enough to melt icebergs. This troubles scientists because it indicates that icebergs may melt faster than earlier predicted. At first, it was believed that ice sheets would take thousands of years to collapse, causing a sea level rise of only seven inches in the 21st century. However, new models predict sea levels may rise three to six feet by the year 2100.
If sea levels rise three feet — the low estimate — some coastal regions may become uninhabitable. Millions of people could be displaced, and coastlines around the world would be submerged under water. Furthermore, erosion of islands and beaches from water would accelerate, and fresh water may become contaminated. However, the causes and effects of global warming are still debated and not widely understood, and scientists are aware that the predicted rise in sea level is just an estimate.

Sensors monitor elderly in homes
Sensor networks that monitor the activity of patients have been in use by hospitals, but they may soon make appear in private homes as well. GrandCare Systems has created a system of motion sensors that collect information about a person’s daily health and habits. For example, sensors under mattress pads monitor sleeping activity, while other sensors may indicate if a person has been taking medication properly. Activity — as well as vital statistics such as blood-sugar levels, blood pressure, and weight — can be relayed wirelessly to a doctor.
This may only be the beginning of changes in the care of elderly patients. Researchers are currently testing robots that can take care of patients. While the sensors may seem invasive at first, many report that the sensors provide a feeling a security and comfort, because friends, family, and doctors can be notified immediately if anything unusual happens.

For most people, Thanksgiving is all about getting the family together and eating as much delicious food as possible. While there are so many aspects surrounding the foundations of this holiday that are worth celebrating, there is no denying that, along with tradition, Thanksgiving also marks the arrival of some more commercial perks. Just like the first of December marks the countdown to Christmas, as Thanksgiving approaches bargain hunters everywhere rejoice in anticipation of Black Friday.
Black Friday, a term given to the Friday following Thanksgiving Day, marks the beginning of the holiday shopping season. While it is unclear when this tradition was first established, the term became popularized at the beginning of the 21st century and is most commonly used on the East Coast. Though it is not nationally recognized as a holiday, it is a prevalently celebrated day in which milions of people participate. 
For those who aren’t familiar with the perks of this day, Black Friday can be summarized in two words: huge sales. Stores decorate their fronts in typical holiday fashion and stock their shelves with discounted merchandise. Many of the larger retailers, like Walmart, Target, and Macy’s, advertise fantastic deals and, after opening their doors at 5 a.m., remain open for 24 hours. 
Because of the incredible savings, the popularity of Black Friday has turned the day into a cultural event of sorts. While many choose to take advantage of the sales, there are varying levels at which this is done. For some, the chaos of Black Friday is a little too much to leave the house. Other more devoted bargain hunters see Black Friday as an indispensable opportunity, thus explaining the thousands of eager shoppers waiting outside of their favorite storefronts in the early hours of the morning.
Many have come up with various explanations for the term, and the exact origin of the label is still up in the air. The term “Black Friday” originated in Pennsylvania, and was commonly used by residents of Philadelphia to describe the mass amounts of traffic following the Thanksgiving holiday. Some media sources claim that the day is called Black Friday because it marks the beginning of the rising profit period for retailers, when stores go from being in the red (debt) to being in the black (profit).
While the details of the history of Black Friday are still unclear, there is no denying that this day has had a global effect. Regardless of one’s location this Thanksgiving, one should be able to follow the frenzy of Black Friday, by simply turning on the television and catching the news. Every year the media reports the record-breaking number of shoppers participating in Black Friday and there is always some newsworthy crisis, whether it be someone getting trampled to death or a fight breaking out in the middle of a Toys “R” Us.  
Despite the popular conceptions of what Black Friday really is, there are plenty of ways in which one can take advantage of the sales in a relaxed and non-stressful way. In fact, there are many ways in which one can safely participate in the Black Friday spirit right here in Pittsburgh.
Black Friday in the ’Burgh
For thrifty college students looking to save a couple of bucks here and there, Black Friday is actually the perfect opportunity to save big on Christmas shopping or even just the monthly necessities. It’s important to remember that not everybody who participates in Black Friday is a coupon-clipping soccer mom, the kind who would punch a person in the face if he got in the way of purchasing that Gameboy game her son or daughter has been whining about for the past month and a half. There is no need to be ashamed of participating in Black Friday. In fact, there are plenty of ways in which one can transform the day into a memorable adventure.
If you’re in Pittsburgh for Thanksgiving and are looking to take Black Friday seriously, then there are plenty of shopping options for you. Aside from the expected department store knockdowns, plenty of local stores are cutting prices as well. While it is true that many of the smaller boutiques in Shadyside and Squirrel Hill may be closed for the holiday, several stores throughout Pittsburgh will be celebrating with big sales. Curious as to whether or not your favorite shopping spot will be open? Call ahead of time and find out. If you don’t mind crowds, Black Friday could be the perfect opportunity to get gift shopping out of the way.
Several stores are also throwing special events to attract the Black Friday crowds. The Macy’s department store downtown will have decorated its windows with various immaculate holiday scenes. The “Yes Virginia, There is a Santa Claus” window displays are inspired by the 2009 TV special retelling of a popular Christmas story from an 1897 editorial in The New York Sun newspaper that answered little Virginia O’Hanlon’s question about the existence of Santa Claus. The department store will also be hosting a Letters to Santa station and photo opportunity, as well as a special holiday store attraction stocked full of stocking stuffers.
Though the focus of Black Friday may be saving, don’t forget about the fashion. Fashion and music blogger Bella of www.bestofbella.com predicts that this year’s Black Friday must-have will be slim-fit, ankle-zipper skinny jeans.  In an e-mail, Bella wrote, “I love Black Friday because it attracts such large amount of shoppers in such a short period of time — it allows fashion freaks like myself to see what specific items are the most popular.”
Not into the whole crowded chaos that has become a convention of Black Friday shopping? Relax, not all bargain hunting has to be stressful. With today’s technology it is only a matter of time until the Black Friday sales make their way to the World Wide Web. The term Cyber Black Friday is now being used to refer to the online promotional offers and sales that mimic those of the actual Black Friday. Because online shopping has become such a convenient and popularized way to shop, retailers have realized the amount of profit that can come from moving sales onto the Internet. 
Looking to do something a little more unconventional on Black Friday? There are plenty of ways to celebrate this day without spending a single cent. Why not throw a Black Friday fiesta? When you do finally manage to wake yourself from your deep turkey coma, invite some friends over for a themed party. Require that all guests wear a black ensemble and bring a holiday gift to be traded with other guests.  Maybe even serve up some Thanksgiving leftovers for dinner. 
Holiday spirit
Aside from shopping opportunities, Black Friday also marks an important transition into the holiday season. Though most people never really examine a storefront, Black Friday is the day that most stores choose to unveil their holiday decorations. If you’re the type of person who is easily excited by the mere mention of Christmas or any other holiday, Black Friday may be the perfect time to stroll about the city and admire the lights and displays. 
Whether you end up waking up at 5 a.m. to shop until you drop or choose merely to hang out with friends and family at home with a cup of eggnog, make sure you do something to celebrate the coming of the holiday season. As they say, “Christmas comes but once a year,” and if you’re not careful, the holiday season will be over before you know it.

Silvia Ziranek certainly knows how to make an impression when she walks into a room. This past Friday at the Waffle Shop, a restaurant run by the Center for Arts in Society, the British artist arrived with short pink hair, a garland of lights around her head, and a mismatched ensemble of brightly printed clothes, complete with large red shoes. Ziranek is a performance artist, sculptor, photographer, and writer who, according to waffleshop.org, aims “to deflate the pretentious and absurd in daily life.”
Ziranek, whose presence was made possible by the support of the School of Art at Carnegie Mellon and the Center for Arts in Society, made two appearances on Friday at the Waffle Shop, one at 8 p.m. and another at 11 p.m. Her 8 p.m. performance was a series of extended monologues, including her newest piece, “How Now Affects How.” She had also performed these monologues for Carnegie Mellon students earlier in the day during an architecture studio class. 
When she returned to the Waffle Shop at 11 p.m., she served as the guest host for the shop’s live streaming talk show. The talk show set was littered with miscellaneous props, mostly pink. Her first talk show guest was a man named John, of whom she promptly asked, “How? Why?” Part of the way through their conversation, she abruptly pulled out a plush, working radio and ordered her guest to turn it on and switch through the various radio stations.
Her second guest was sophomore Tepper School of Business student Alex Price, who volunteered to come on her show. Although their conversation occasionally reached potentially interesting topics, Ziranek never appeared interested in doing anything more than just skimming the surface of any one subject matter. They began an interesting dialogue about feminism, but halfway through Ziranek appeared to lose interest. 
As Price began to answer her questions about his views, she gave him a piercing look, then again pulled out her plush radio before giving away her props to audience members; she gave Price a pair of pink boxing gloves. She then began to question him about his opinions on steel. This unwillingness to speak deeply about any one topic may have been a reflection of her aim to “deflate the pretentious” in daily life; however, it came across as flighty and superficial.
Her third guest was second-year architecture major Anna Bieberdorf, with whom Ziranek began conversing about femininity and what it means to be feminine. Again, however, Ziranek appeared unwilling to stick to any one subject for very long, and the conversation turned to the aesthetic appeal of bridges and power lines. 
A gentleman whose wife had apparently attended Ziranek’s 8 p.m. performance and insisted that he go see her speak soon joined them on the talk show set. When Ziranek heard that his wife had been at the previous performance, she insisted that he take a prop for her, and presented him with a miniature dust pan and brush, instructing Bieberdorf to first clean off his jacket and shoulders with the brush.
Overall, Ziranek’s role as a guest talk show host at the Waffle Shop was whimsical and quirky at best, superficial and flighty at worst; but perhaps she was acting purposefully to make a point about the absurdities and superficialities one encounters in everyday life.

This past week, two of country music’s hottest acts released new albums that are sure to gain airplay, and they might even garner some mainstream radio attention as well.
Keith Urban — *Get Closer*
This is Urban’s seventh studio album over a span of 12 years. For an artist who’s 43, his ability to turn out hits appropriate for 2010 is amazing. His newest album is only eight tracks and 33 minutes long (though the deluxe version is more than twice that length), which makes it feel like he should have delayed it longer to produce a longer set list. Nonetheless, there are some quality songs on the album.
The leadoff track, “Put You In a Song,” is a different take on a love song. Urban combines his love for music and his love for a certain someone by “putting them in a song,” thus creating a song that’s good to turn the volume up on and repeat over and over.
In “You Gonna Fly,” Urban urges a girl to let her hair down and just have some fun. He’s a man interested in enjoying life, and he knows that if his partner joins him, she’ll have a great time. This song is great country-pop while still holding country roots and not going too mainstream.
The first ballad, “All For You,” feels a bit unfinished. Urban’s lyrics have been better, but at least the sentiment’s real.
Next is “Long Hot Summer,” which feels like it’s going to pick up the pace, but never really does. Though it’s yet another one of Urban’s summer-love anthems, it’s a welcome enough addition to the group.
The soft “Without You” represents country music in its purest form — just vocals and a banjo for most of the song. Urban leaves off the music production on this track and relies solely on the lyrics and the minimal musicality.
The verses of “Georgia Woods” drag on a bit, and the song would be skip-worthy if the chorus wasn’t a pick-me-up, changing the tone of the rest of the track.
Next up is “Right On Back to You,” which, pulls back the reins completely. Urban’s vocals are highlighted here, and for good reason. The song starts off with the sound of rainfall, which sets the tone, but Urban can deliver a ballad like no one else.
It was a wise choice to end such a short album with a song like “Shut Out the Lights,” which instead of easing us into the closing of the album, leaves us feeling energized and, possibly, feeling ready for a second listen of the CD. It’s a dynamic song, constantly changing from high-energy cymbal crashes to gentle drumbeats, only to be overlain with Urban’s smart and stylistically pleasing lyrics.
Listen Up: “You Gonna Fly,” “Right On Back to You,” “Shut Out the Lights”
The Verdict: Though there was a gap of over a year and a half, Urban’s newest release feels like it came too soon after the huge success of his previous album. And with a track list of only eight songs, it’s hard to create a great album as a whole, but there’s definitely a handful of gems.
Rascal Flatts — *Nothing Like This*
Rascal Flatts has, for a few years now, been the young face of modern country. And despite this album being the group’s seventh in just 10 years, the trio remains fresh and fun, always attracting a great number of fans.
“Why Wait” opens up the album with a strong country sound and a fun little tune about a guy not wanting to wait to get married because… well, it’s just a waste of time! It’s a good song, but not a good opener.
Next, “Easy” is a power ballad that features guest vocals by Natasha Bedingfield. He’s acting as if his recent break-up wasn’t bad, “but what she don’t know is how hard it is to make it look so easy.”
Christian-inspired “Sunday Afternoon” follows, and feels like it wants to be a faster song than it really is. Still, it’s a good song as a whole, and it ranks among the better songs on the album.
“Play” is another song that you just imagine is really fun for the guys to perform because it’s an easy-going beat with simple lyrics about simple things making life exciting.
“Nothing Like This” makes use of the twang of the banjo, a gentle background to the romantic tune.
Up next is “All Night to Get There,” which is an energetic, musically exciting song about taking it easy. The lyrics “We got nowhere to be and all night to get there” are truly appropriate for blasting the song in a car.
“Red Camaro” is an easy-going summer song, but it fails to be memorable.
“They Try” slows down the pace and seems to be more of a movie soundtrack song than a track from a Rascal Flatts album; unfortunately, this description isn’t meant to carry a positive connotation here.
Next up, “Summer Young” features a strong drumbeat and lyrics reflecting signature summer themes, such as “that boardwalk you and I strolled down, lights dancing on the water from the merry-go-round.”
“Tonight Tonight” keeps up the pace from the previous song as the singer talks about his excitement before he meets up with his special someone.
Closing out the album with “I Won’t Let Go,” Rascal Flatts lays us down gently with a meaningful promise that drips with honesty and emotion.
Listen Up: “Easy,” “Summer Young,” “Tonight Tonight”
The Verdict: Unfortunately, a lot of the songs end up blurring together, and it’s hard to distinguish them from Rascal Flatts’ previous songs. The album is great for playing at a summer party or lounging by the pool, but almost all of the songs fail to mesmerize.

Goal: Empowerment through education. Implementation: A four-day summit teaching programming, music, and acting at Nonko Primary School in Kigali, Rwanda.
The finale: A spectacular showcase of the students’ work and creativity, heartwarming friendships, and a commitment to sustainability.
Begun in September 2009, Project Rwanda is a student-run initiative in collaboration with One Laptop per Child (OLPC), an international nonprofit association. The laptops are referred to in short as “XO.”
12:05 a.m. Thursday, May 13, 2010 — Ten Carnegie Mellon students from Pittsburgh and Qatar arrived in Kigali, Rwanda. We were greeted by Sam, a regional OLPC director, and two taxi drivers. We would be residing in a local church. During the drive, Sam asked, “What do you know about Rwanda? Aside from genocide?” This was a good question, and we paused for a moment. Vishal Agrawal, a junior electrical and computer engineering major, discussed Rwanda’s progress in education. Ariel Solomon, a junior business administration major, chimed in and conveyed everything she knew about the country’s recent technological development and social reforms for women, the homeless, and petty thieves. Sam was pleased that we had well-grounded, factual information about his country — but there was still much to learn.
Introductions at the school
“Muraho!” (“Hi!”) we exclaimed as we walked into the school’s classrooms for the first time. We began by introducing ourselves and expressing our excitement for what was to come. “Amakuru?” (“How are you?”) we asked. The children’s excitement was stimulating. In our first attempt to break the ice, we taught them to “pound it,” an American hand greeting. The next few days would be challenging and fun-filled, and ones that we were determined to cherish together. We were to teach a total of 130 students for six classes each day.
Programming
One of the XO applications that we taught was Scratch, a programming application. It features block “drag and drop” programming for beginners. Over a period of four days, we taught the children the basics of programming. At the end, we were able to build a game to show students that programming could be fun and that there were many possibilities for achievement.
Music
“The days pass, but laughter does not...” This was the title of a song we learned from the children during one of our lessons. Tam Tam is a series of music applications on the XO laptops. Before delving into these applications, we wanted the students to gain a sense of the meaning of music, as it was unique to each student. We then explored key concepts such as tempo, beats, loops, and rhythm through multiple exercises. The students not only created their own music, but performed to it as well in a “Nonko’s Coolest Band” competition.
Acting
Acting is a way for people to express themselves, showing that communication transcends words. Therefore, we used the Record application with a built-in XO webcam to convey our message. Using Record, the students recorded their emotions and expressions. Then they acted and recorded scenes, such as a surprise birthday party or a school session. They even created their own props and scripts for an animal farm scene, which they later reenacted in front of their peers.
Complementing our school experience, we were able to soak in the rich Rwandan culture through a road trip to Lake Kivu, a soccer stadium, and a memorial site; dinner with a Rwandan family affiliated with the Ministry of Education; and a tour of a handicraft factory.
Our favorite memories
“When the students tried to pronounce our names and showed that they cared for us and we had become friends.” —Sruthi Reddy Chintakunta, senior electrical and computer engineering major.
“My favorite moment was after the finale performance when all the kids crowded around us as we were leaving. I could tell that they had fun during our summit programs, and one girl came up to me and promised me that she would never forget me. At that moment I felt that we broke all the barriers we had created in our minds about Rwanda, and all of our efforts had paid off. It also inspired me to make this project sustainable for years to come and perhaps even return to Rwanda one day.” —Urna Biswas, junior business administration major.
“We were there to teach, but we couldn’t even speak their language. Using a translator, it is hard to really tell whether the students understand what you are saying or if they are even learning anything. One time, we solved out a programming problem orally and then had them do it on the laptop; each one of the students smiled as their laptop made a resounding ‘meowwwww,’ and I knew from their faces that they understood.” —Joshua Debner, senior electrical and computer engineering major.
“[My] favorite moment in Kigali was when all the kids outshined each other in the finale and then taking snaps, sharing hugs and e-mails, and the kids shouting, ‘We will never forget you.’” —Jim Briggs, junior information systems and business administration double major.
“My favorite moment was realizing that they know more about American history than we do!” —Ariel Solomon, junior business administration major.
“When we distributed candy and other goodies to the kids. The contribution of speakers, soccer balls, etc. to the school was a great moment. The students were really excited to play and have fun with the new stuff! For me, this moment was memorable and priceless.” —Abhay Joseph Valiyaveettil, sophomore information systems major.
“Learning a song from the children titled ‘The days pass, but laughter does not’ and bonding with them, in spite of language barriers, through the music we created together.” —Amy Badiani, senior social decision sciences and public policy and management double major.
“Learning about the Rwandan culture and integrating the teaching techniques these children were most comfortable with.” —Waleed Khan, junior information systems major.
We share more of our amazing experiences in Kigali at cmuprojectrwanda.wordpress.com and also at www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxEPZ3dZfuo. We have also created a permanent home for Project Rwanda in the Stever Inspiration Room, capturing our happy memories and displaying a mural created by the students at Nonko.
**Project Rwanda Team:* Vishal Agrawal, Amy Badiani, Urna Biswas, Jim Briggs, Joshua Debner, Abhay Joseph Valiyaveettil, Waleed Khan, Melvin Rayappa, Sruthi Reddy Chintakunta, and Ariel Solomon.*

The Underground show hosting Modern Conversation and The Wrong Airport was supposed to begin at 6 p.m. last Wednesday night, but with setup and sound check issues, 6 p.m. slowly morphed into 6:30 p.m. and then some. When the opening band, The Wrong Airport, finally hit the stage, the crowd was dying for some music, and that’s exactly what the band brought. For a small band, the two group members sure did bring the “noise.”
The duo met while attending Carnegie Mellon University and collaborated on their first song together during their senior year. A mix of lo-fi and electronica, their sound is beat-heavy and energetic. Much of their music incorporates looping and pre-recorded beats. Ryan Woodring, bass guitarist and vocalist, also beatboxes while controlling the loop pedal. Patrick Torrez, the other half of the band, plays the guitar and keyboard. 
Besides providing a great show, the duo also made a few quips here and there to get the crowd going. At a point earlier in the show, Woodring asked, “You guys want louder, right?” to which the crowd cheered. Woodring laughed and added, “Especially all of you who just came here to study.”Woodring and Torrez played songs off their debut album, Arrivals and Departures, as well as a Sheryl Crow cover to “warm up for our most emotional song.”
After The Wrong Airport came Modern Conversation, a quartet from Chicago. The band had never been to Pittsburgh before and was excited to perform here. Modern Conversation is currently on an East Coast tour to promote a new EP, About Time, and planned to play in New York the next day.
Part rock, part folk, with a bit of reggae mixed in, Modern Conversation has a very eclectic sound. The band comprises two guys and two girls — David Courtenay is the frontman and sings vocals as well as plays guitar and bass; Jeremy Schmidt is lead guitarist and also plays bass; Janet Cramer plays drums and sings vocals; and Jackie Rada plays keyboard. Courtenay is from California, while the rest of the band is from the Midwest.
Throughout the night the band played songs from About Time, as well as a few songs the group just recorded. Many of the band’s songs have reggae undertones, and Courtenay is always sure to point out which ones. Between songs Courtenay charmed the audience with stories about his life. For “Country Jam,” Courtenay switched to play bass, telling us, “My very first band back in California, I played bass. I was a Paul McCartney wannabe. I couldn’t really play or sing like him, though.”
The song played after that was one called “Love and Shame,” which was about “getting into precarious relationships or situations” — a state many listeners were familiar with.
The group then played a spectacular Doors cover that brought up the energy level of the house as those who knew the song sang along.
The band wrapped up the night with a raffle, a common occurrence at Modern Conversation shows. Audience members were encouraged to put their names and email addresses on a slip of paper and put it into the tip jar for the possibility of winning a copy of About Time. The winner of the night was senior mechanical engineering major Brian Manning. Afterward the band stuck around to chat with fans.

Very few individuals who choose a career in the film industry ever truly make it. That said, when someone does see success in the industry and becomes famous because of it, it is often customary for a hometown to show a little pride. In Indiana, Pa., a small town located one hour outside of the Pittsburgh city limits, residents have paid homage to the iconic film and stage actor Jimmy Stewart by establishing the Jimmy Stewart Museum. 
Stewart, who was born in Indiana in 1908, had one of the most versatile careers in Hollywood. After graduating from Princeton University in 1931, Stewart began his acting career by dabbling in various student performance troupes. After moving to New York City, Stewart made his Broadway debut in a show called Goodbye Again in which the actor had two lines. In 1934, on the opening night of Divided By Three, in which Stewart starred, the actor attracted the attention of MGM talent scout Bill Grady. Years later, after signing on as an MGM contract star and starring in various westerns, comedies, and thrillers, Stewart had become one of the most established names in Hollywood, earning himself five Academy Awards as well as one Lifetime Achievement award for his six decades in Hollywood. 
For the people of Indiana, Pa., Stewart has been the ultimate “hometown hero.” Thus, the Jimmy Stewart Museum was established to celebrate the remarkable career of this Hollywood icon. The museum itself features several relics from Stewart’s childhood and adult life. The array of display items is vast: From baby photos to his grandfather’s Civil War uniform, the museum has gathered together artifacts from every stage of the actor’s life. The museum also boasts an impressive vintage movie theater where visitors can view various film clips from Stewart’s career. 
However, museums don’t last forever, and as the generational gap widens, there seem to be fewer and fewer Stewart enthusiasts willing to visit the museum. With the current numbers of attendees and donations, it doesn’t look as if this town’s salute to a hometown hero will be able to stand much longer. According to the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette, with a drop in attendance from around 6,500 in 2009 to just 5,000 this year, and a budget cut from $5,500 to $1,400 by the Pennsylvania Historical and Museum Commission, curators at the museum worry that the attraction won’t be able to maintain itself.
Because the museum is one that depends mainly on annual gifts and operational volunteers, the town of Indiana has been promoting the attraction at every possible opportunity. However, donations are currently down 11 percent, and the museum’s endowment might not be enough to save it. 
Despite the fact that this museum is an hour outside  Pittsburgh, the possibility of closure is especially relevant to city residents concerned with preserving art and culture. One museum closure often leads to another, and being a city that prides itself on its extensive museums and art galleries, nearby closures could mean dangerous things for nonprofit organizations in Pittsburgh.
If you’re lacking something to do on a given weekend, gather some friends together and drive on over to the Jimmy Stewart Museum. You can also help keep this monumental museum alive by going to www.jimmy.org/donate and donating. It’s up to today’s generation to help preserve the generations of the past.

Murder writing can be a dangerous business. For one thing, as murder mystery author Harriet Vane finds when she discovers a dead man’s body on a beach while vacationing, it can make an innocent woman look very suspicious, especially if she’s already been tried for murder once. 
For another, as Dorothy L. Sayers knew while writing Have His Carcase, it can be very difficult to make a plot feasible and enigmatic without relying on a deus ex machina, a “god from the machine” wherein a seemingly inextricable plot is abruptly solved thanks to an unexplained, godlike intervention. However, in true Sayers fashion, Have His Carcase avoids this pitfall neatly and comes off as a thought-provoking and dazzling addition to Sayers’ Lord Peter Wimsey series. 
What makes Sayers’ books different from most murder mysteries is the amount of detail that she puts into her work and the style in which she presents it: She neatly avoids the grittiness of a gory scene, though still getting across crucial points, and she makes descriptions palatable for readers who are less interested in what a cut throat looks like than in who did it.
Sayers also takes risks with her writing by basing mysteries around existing places, as she did with an artists’ colony in Scotland in her previous book The Five Red Herrings, and in Have His Carcase, where the murder takes place at a beach near a resort town, with the body of evidence quite literally about to be taken out by the tide. 
The book opens on Vane, the mystery writer who was accused of murdering her long-time beau in String Poison and cleared by Wimsey, who has fallen in love with her. Again, Vane is accused, but thanks to her detective acumen, she had taken as many pictures of the body and collected as much evidence as she could before high tide washed it away. 
For the bulk of the book, Wimsey and Vane must work together off the clues Vane found as the police dredge the bay of the small resort town for the body. Along the way, they must confront the difficulties of rising and falling tides, the lack of footprints along the sands, the fact that the deceased looks like he committed suicide, and the ludicrous allegations of the wealthy widow the deceased had intended to marry. 
The book is comical but never unbelievable: Sayers’ plot has all the twists and ingenious turns of a real-life caper gone astray, headlined by characters so well-developed and full that it’s jarring to remember that they’re fictional. 
Though the book does have a comic element — police unable to find the body after relentless searching, Wimsey’s constant requests for Vane to marry him, and a plot to restore the Russian czardom — it also addresses darker concerns just as unabashedly. Wimsey finds that Vane’s room has been searched and eventually explains that he’s been acting like a lovesick admirer in order to secretly help clear her name without arousing suspicion. 
Vane confronts the expectations for women as she observes the deceased’s intended bride being ridiculed for attempting to remarry at her extreme age, and the way Vane herself is being treated as a potential suspect, branded as a dangerous and intelligent female. The characters develop slowly but truthfully through the series, and that is what perhaps gives Sayers’ work its greatest appeal. 
Though deciphering out codes and finding holes in alibis is fascinating, perhaps Have His Carcase's greatest strength is how Sayers manages to coax out a complicated plot without losing the reality of her characters in the process. As always, a triumph.

Dear Hoskins Brothers,
It’s almost winter break, and you know what that means. I’ll have to go a whole month without reading The Tartan and your column! What should I do to get through this barren, humorless, news-less, advice-less month called December?
Sincerely,
Big Reader
Dear BR,
Good news! You probably don’t actually read The Tartan, so it’ll be easy to go a month without it. Seriously, just go on a news website like the rest of the world.
The real horror is going without my column. Luckily, every issue of my column is posted online at www.thetartan.org. Now, I know what you may be thinking — “Reading online? Preposterous!” But no, people do it every day. There won’t be any new columns posted, so instead just read through and memorize every single one of my past columns. That way, when the day inevitably comes where I accidentally make up the same question again (I mean publish a question I’ve received before...), you’ll know and can send me an angry e-mail! Too bad I don’t check my e-mail, otherwise I could post it in the column. Yes, I don’t check my e-mail, and that’s why I haven’t gotten all the phone numbers the hordes of my beautiful advice-groupies must have sent me. 
Anyone? Anyone at all?
Brian Hoskins
Dear Hoskins Brothers,
Why are girls so dumb?
Sincerely,
Your Friendly Neighborhood Physicist
Dear Physicist,
Well, your first problem is that you’re only dating CFA and H&SS girls. Try dating some engineering girls instead. Guys and girls are different, almost like they’re from different planets. Men are from somewhere like Mars, and women are from somewhere far away, like Venus.
No, that’s just really stupid. You’re both from Earth; women are just weird. They have these “feelings,” and whatever you may think, they probably think the opposite. Want a relationship? They just want to hook up. Want to just hook up? They don’t want to be seen with you. Want to follow them around from afar? They file a restraining order.
Here’s the deal — girls are dumb and crazy. As a man, your job is to figure out how much crazy you can deal with, and then find a girl with less than or equal to that amount of crazy. If she’s not crazy, she’s probably a dude. Whatever you do, don’t fall for a girl crazier than you can handle. She’s crazy, and it won’t end well.
Stay below the Mendoza line,
Patrick Hoskins

Disco rules hard. When I say disco, I don’t want you thinking of Donna Summer and the Village People. They’ve got no funk, no real mojo. When I say disco, I’m strictly speaking of the kind of music that will get you out of your seat.Let me start out with some background about this music. Disco’s birth was in Europe, but it found a rich environment for its own evolution in New York and Philadelphia. Disco was a reaction by New York City’s gays, as well as black and Latino heterosexuals, against both the domination of rock and the demonization of dance music. 
So how do we get from 1976 to 2010? Well, an album to check out for examples that reveal the uniform underlying tendencies of disco is SH-01. It was released in 1997 by Soundhack. Each of their 12”s focused on extracting loops from various disco tracks from 1978 through 1980. The tracks work very well as DJ tools for layering on top of other songs or for further distillation. 
And there you have it: In a very well-articulated LP you can see the lineage from which Afrojack, Daft Punk, Hot Chip, A-track, Mr. Oizo, and Louis La Roche are coming. Of course, that doesn’t take into account melodic tendencies, but that’s because that defines what sub-genres a particular song will fall into. Those distinctions are what bring about deep-house, fidget house, and nü disco.
Let’s bust out of bounds for a while. Who’s hot on the dance floor these days? Skrillex. His latest release, Scary Monster & Nice Sprites, takes us one step closer to a genre-less music platform. His potent mixture of melodic progressions and  deafening drops has allowed him to ravage the Beatport charts with dubstep chunes, which rarely ever chart. Check out the following two tracks. “What is Light, Where is Laughter (Skrillex Remix)” by Twin Atlantic serves as a good introduction to dubstep-infused drum to synth and indie rock lovers. The second, “Seventeen (Skrillex Remix)” by Casxio is for you lovers of fidget dance tracks like MSTRKFT.
Hugs and kisses,
Juan Fernandez | Staffwriter

A recent ruling by a federal appeals court stated that it is unclear if public college faculty members have First Amendment protection for criticisms they make against administrators.
This finding is especially shocking considering most people’s assumption that everyone’s speech is protected under the Bill of Rights. The recent ruling raises the question of First Amendment protection for faculty on Carnegie Mellon’s own campus.
Freedom of speech is  guaranteed under the Bill of Rights, despite job or position in society. However, uncertainty arose concerning the protection of First Amendment rights for public college faculty members after the federal appeals court ruling on Nov. 12.
The court case in question was an appeal of a lawsuit by Juan Hong, a retired chemical engineering professor of the University of California at Irvine, who claims that he was unjustly denied a merit raise due to comments that he made in faculty meetings.
According to an Inside Higher Ed news article, Hong allegedly offended the administration by stating that his department was heavily relying on part-time instructors, demanding that students deserved full-time professors.
Without the protection and assurance of free speech, faculty members are in jeopardy of being censored by their administrations.  They cannot make criticisms of any sort for fear that they could potentially lose their jobs or, as in Hong’s case, be denied a raise.
In response to the news of the court case, Maggie Kowalski, a sophomore economics and Chinese double major, stated, “I feel that you can’t just waive someone’s right to free speech, especially if someone’s intent was not malicious. I see no reason why a merit-based raise would be revoked for criticism that was not intended to harm the organization. Rather, it seems it was intended to improve the organization.”
The judicial precedent to Hong’s case is the 2006 Supreme Court decision Garcetti v. Ceballos, which limited the First Amendment rights of public employees performing their official duties, although Supreme Court judges suggested that the ruling would not apply to public higher education.
However, courts retain the right to apply this ruling to other cases concerning faculty members of public colleges, thereby limiting the rights of faculty members. 
In relation to Hong’s recent case, the district court ruled that discussing department personnel is included in the official duties of professors. Hence, in accordance with the Garcetti v. Ceballos case, faculty members are not entitled to First Amendment protection. This means that any criticism made by public college faculty members of their superiors could be legally punishable.
Although Carnegie Mellon University does not fall under the category of a public college, this recent ruling raises comparisons to be made between the two types of education institutions. Do students feel that Carnegie Mellon is any different?
“If a ruling applies to government employees, I see no reason why the ruling shouldn’t extend to professors who work under the public education system,” Shilpa Balaji, a sophomore computer science major and a captain of Carnegie Mellon’s Mock Trial team, stated. 
“However, this in no way implies that the same ruling should extend to professors at a private university. Private institutions should be entitled to uphold their own standards, as long as they don’t infringe on anyone’s rights.”
According to Carnegie Mellon’s faculty handbook, “A member of the faculty may express in the classroom his or her own opinions on matters relevant to his or her courses…. When dealing with controversial matters, he or she must take reasonable care in the selection and balanced presentation of material, and must try to make clear distinctions between statements of fact and opinion.... When [the faculty] engage in non-university activities, faculty members are expected to make clear that they act as individuals and not as spokesmen for the university…. It is the duty of the [Faculty] Senate to be alert and informed concerning matters involving instruction, scholarly or cultural activities, or any other matters pertaining to the general welfare of the faculty or of the academic community as a whole.”
Professors’ criticisms about the administration or to superiors are not malicious and are received constructively.
“I feel that the faculty is aptly able to criticize changes all the time. My professors, specifically in my computer science classes, are free to make their opinions known of the recent changes that have occurred in their department,” said Bryan Wade, a sophomore economics major.
Carnegie Mellon strives to remain a top educational institution and thus tries to improve its organizations and administrations. Fortunately, professors here are ensured their full constitutional rights whether or not it pertains to official duties, unlike in Hong’s court case.

Strong Women Strong Girls (SWSG), a mentorship program for young girls, conducted one of its semi-annual field trips to Carnegie Mellon’s campus this past Saturday.
The organization strives to imbue in girls a sense of strength and opportunity. “The ultimate goal of Strong Women Strong Girls is to empower underprivileged girls, showing them how strong they currently are as well as how they can become strong women in their future,” said Stephanie Guerra, a senior Science and Humanities scholar and a SWSG mentor. 
Carnegie Mellon’s chapter of Strong Women Strong Girls was formed in the spring of 2006. The creation of the Carnegie Mellon branch shifted the organization to one with national influence. The branch was created with the specific intention of creating a program that fostered strong mentorship relationships between female Carnegie Mellon student mentors and girls in the Pittsburgh community. This weekend’s field trip is only one aspect of the program; the program uses a range of tactics to instill in girls a positive sense of strength.
Throughout the semester, each mentor works weekly with a group of girls. The goal of the program is to empower and to develop them into strong people and community members. According to the SWSG website, SWSG.org, “Relationships, skills, and role models are essential to helping girls and women succeed.” These three capstones are actualized in two ways. 
Each week, the mentors focus on one “strong quality” and develop projects and activities in order to emphasize this skill. Skills range from goal setting to determination, and girls are engaged by the inclusion of real-life historical or current examples of women who exemplify those qualities. 
The second way that girl empowerment is implemented is through the community. The mentors function as friends and role models to the girls, and the girls both connect with and learn from their older mentors. “We want to raise self-esteem, help the girls reach their potential, and we tell them that if they really want something, they can go out and do it,” said Mallika Sahay, a senior psychology and social decision sciences double major and co-director of Pittsburgh SWSG.
Saturday’s field trip focused on that sense of community. This trip is one of two annual ones; the second trip is taking place during Carnival and rewards the girls for their hard work throughout the year while showing how fun college can be. “The [fall] field trip is a way to accomplish our goals of empowerment and encourage girls from a young age to attend college,” explained Guerra. “We get to visit their school on a weekly basis; [the girls] really love to see where we work too!”
The program’s encouragement of girls’ collegiate futures was evident from this trip. “For these girls, college is not thought of as something that they can achieve; our goal is to change that belief and to have fun. We want them to really want to go to college so that they will work towards it,” Sahay said. 
This year, the focus for this particular field trip was “When I grow up,” and  the day featured a healthy living workshop hosted by health care policy master’s student Jonelle Saunders, a science workshop hosted by the Society of Women Engineers, and a “Stella Hunt” (a hunt for SWSG’s mascot, Stella, through campus) with Alpha Kappa Alpha. The healthy living workshop, held in UC Rangos 3, included stretching, a dance routine, and group discussion about how to develop physical health. The science workshop provided girls with a greater understanding of engineering and science concepts through a hands-on boat-building project. Teams of girls competed to create a foil boat that held the largest number of marbles. The Stella Hunt was essentially a campus tour, which allowed girls to experience Carnegie Mellon’s campus firsthand. 
Overall, the mix of educational and fun activities seemed well-received by the girls. When asked if the day had been fun, one young participant nodded enthusiastically. “By providing them with this encouragement and showing them that college is a great option, we hope to empower the girls,” Guerra said.
However, it is not just the young girls being mentored who are empowered by the program. Fifteen new mentors were recruited this fall alone, and they have all undergone rigorous mentorship training as well as participated in their weekly work with the girls. An integral part of the program, as stated in its mission, is creating “cycles of mutual empowerment.” 
“The mentors empower themselves by empowering these girls. I feel like I myself have become a better leader through mentoring,” Guerra said. Co-director Katherine Yang, a social and decision sciences senior, is a testament to the quality of the work that SWSG does for both the girls and the mentors. “Over the years it has become a huge part of my life,” she said. “I really believe it is impactful.” 
Clearly, this level of personal growth is something that Carnegie Mellon students seek out.
Hannah Wirtshafter, a junior Science and Humanities Scholar, noted, “The program is a good way to get involved and contribute; I recognize the impact that my mentors have had on me, and I wanted to provide that mentorship for someone else.”

“Deeplocal, Inc. wants to establish a culture that creates good ideas,” said  Nathan Martin, the CEO of Deeplocal, as he explained that his company’s goal is to create a compelling user experience. Martin graduated from the College of Fine Arts at Carnegie Mellon University in 1999.
Deeplocal Inc. is a Pittsburgh-based company comprised of artists, designers, and engineers who work together to form collaborations through different mediums. The members take pride in the fact that it is a self-start-up company, as it gives them the freedom to be more creative and actually take part in what they are designing rather than working at a large-scale company. At Deeplocal the artists, designers, and engineers are each connected to every part of the process from start to finish.
Roxy Viray, a fifth-year architecture student, commented, “Their Waffle Wednesdays are a great opportunity to connect with Deeplocal employees and other Pittsburgh innovators to discuss current events [and] new ideas and eat — the waffles were delicious.  I was able to talk with a local artist and exchange advice about her installation and my studio project.”
Deeplocal’s process of creating this unique experience is through its use of Gutter Technology. This was a focal point of the discussion as Martin took the audience through many of Deeplocal’s projects. 
Deeplocal does not like to complicate orders; instead, the company puts emphasis on solving client’s orders as quickly and efficiently as possible, starting with building a prototype.
When building this way, the team purposefully does not use the newest technology. Rather, the designers look to produce the prototype using the most basic technology and then build their way up.
According to Deeplocal’s official website, www.deeplocal.com, the company is rooted in creating unique and innovative products. “Deeplocal’s culture reflects our roots in the punk rock and art scenes. Our time is split between working with world-class brands, turning our own ideas into products and contributing to the greater arts community. Our client list includes brands like Nike, Volkswagen, GigaPan.org, Carnegie Mellon University, and numerous transit agencies across the country.”
Deeplocal has created many interesting and interactive advertisements. For example, when collaborating with Nike Livestrong, the company built a machine that would chalk messages on the road. People could send in a message and the machine would print it along the ground while a picture of the printed message would be sent back to the sender.
“I found out about Deeplocal during the Tour de France last year when their Nike Chalkbot was featured on TV,” said Judy Podraza, a fifth-year architecture student.
“I am proud that CMU alumni are   coming up with new, innovative and non-traditional ways of connecting with people through things like text messages that get transformed into chalk messages seen by many. Deeplocal’s designs push the limits of art combined with technology and link the digital with the physical world,” Podraza further commented.
Another interactive advertisement was at the United States versus England soccer game on the opening day of the 2010 World Cup. Fans from both the United States and England could send each other trash-talking messages through soccer balls that were printed with their messages and shot out of a billboard in the other’s country. 
Deeplocal inspires innovation by challenging its staff into thinking and problem-solving creatively.

On Saturday, Hunt Library celebrated its 50th anniversary with a light show  comprised of standard lights shown every night,  colorful changing patterns for special campus events, and examples of holiday designs for Hanukkah, Christmas, Valentine’s Day, and the Fourth of July.
The exterior lights were funded by a grant from the Roy A. Hunt Foundation and designed by Cindy Limauro and Chris Popowich of C & C Lighting, LLC. Limauro is also a professor of lighting design in the schools of drama and architecture.
Efforts to redesign the library lighting began when Roy Hunt’s grandson, Bill Hunt, pointed out that half of the building could not be seen from Forbes Avenue at night. “Like many of the buildings on campus, the library disappears structurally at night. All you are seeing is the florescent lights inside, and then you’re seeing half the building dark,” Popowich said.
“Bill Hunt was crossing campus one night and noticed that the right side of the library was totally dark,” Limauro said. “He then contacted President Cohon about the look of the building at night, and President Cohon immediately asked me to take it on as a project.” The university had previously enlisted Limauro and Popowich to design the lighting for the Randy Pausch Bridge in 2009.
“When we were brought on board, we looked at this and thought: Here’s this blank canvas. What can we do with it?” said Popowich.
While the building’s aluminum structure and unobstructed location make it an ideal medium for lighting, Limauro and Popowich tried to make the library more than just a canvas. “The lighting needs to support the beauty and elegance of that aluminum structure and give it an enhanced presence on campus,” said Limauro. “We were looking at the best way to show off the structure of the building.... We wanted to reveal as many different facets of the building though color, light, and movement.” Popowich added, “The lighting uses green technology in the form of color-changing LEDs that can mix to white light or create dynamic color combinations.”
In addition to the library, Limauro and Popowich also lit up the canopy in front of the library. “The canopy in front of the building had not been lit in 20-plus years,” Popowich said. “It was another aspect of the library that was brought up, and the Hunts were very pleased to now see the engravings on the marble that had been lost at night.”
The lighting’s full capabilities were demonstrated at the 50th anniversary, showing a number of accelerated versions of different seasonal and celebratory themes. 
“We’ve created a series of looks for the every-night version which is more classic, showcasing the beauty of the building in a more subtle way,” explained Limauro. “We probably have programmed 50 light shows into the computer that can be called up at any time.”
According to Limauro, the best thing about the lighting is its versatility. “The LED lighting fixtures can be programmed to create any kind of color that you might want.... Each fixture has its own control, so you have all this capability of really painting the building based on whatever idea you have in mind. The use of color also creates a sense of energy and activity to the campus at night.”
“It’s not a rock ’n’ roll light show, but that could be very easily done,” Popowich added.
In addition to lighting the building, the surrounding lamp posts are being replaced with LED street lamps. The new fixtures will not only save energy but will redirect the light to the ground and eliminate light pollution. The floodlights on Baker Hall and the Peace Garden side of the library have also been eliminated, saving further energy.
Limauro is also advising a three-person team of students who will be redesigning the interior lighting of Hunt Library. 
“The interior of the library currently has lot of glare and the lighting is at a consistent level between study areas and stacks,” said third-year architecture major Grace Ding, who is a member of the team. 
“As such, not only is the interior lighting not conducive for reading books and using computers, but the fact that most of the lights are on all the time mars the appearance of the library and exacerbates the already high energy usage of florescent lights.”
The team intended to solve all these problems at once. 
“Our plan was to install dimmable LED replacement bulbs in the existing fluorescent fixtures. These bulbs are much more energy efficient, using about one-third of the energy of fluorescent bulbs,” Limauro said. “Also, these circuits would be placed on sensors so that when no one is occupying a space, the lights would dim to a minimum level. This would help reduce the lighting load in the day, as well as reduce the strong contrast between the light and dark parts of the facade during the night.”
Unfortunately, the relative novelty and high cost of LED technology have slowed progress.
“In our plan, this interior lighting would be implemented first, and then the exterior light lighting would be justified because of the energy savings from these first steps,” Ding said. Currently, Limauro and Popowich have implemented their plan backwards because they are waiting for the technology to catch up before proceeding with the interior.
Nevertheless, the team is still happy to see at least part of the plan realized. “It’s nice to have this great visual object on campus so that at night, it becomes an icon of the campus,” said third-year architecture major Arthur Notaro, another member of the three-person team. In addition to retrofitting interior lighting, Limauro and Popowich also hope more buildings will follow the example of Hunt Library in the future.
“I would like to see a master plan of light for the Carnegie Mellon campus in which the interior of each building could be relit to save energy,” Limauro said.
“New exterior lighting would highlight the unique architectural features of each building, increase a sense of safety, and enhance the visual look of campus in a way that is fitting for a world-class university.”
Editor's Note: This article was corrected on Nov. 25, 2010. The original version of the article stated that the lighting was a gift from Bill Hunt. In fact, it was paid for with a grant from the Roy A. Hunt Foundation.

Local mural explores Latino awareness in Pittsburgh
With support from the Carnegie Mellon Center for the Arts in Society, the youth group Jóvenes Sin Nombres, Youths Without Names, presented a mural on the walls of the Latino Family Center in Squirrel Hill. 
The mural, named “Pintando Para un Sueño” (“Painting For a Dream”), was unveiled last Thursday. The group also had support from the Carnegie Museum of Art and Tavia La Follette, director of ArtUp.
The mural explores the themes of immigrants in Pittsburgh, issues of immigration, the U.S. border, and the “Dream Act,” which would provide citizenship to children of immigrants who graduate from U.S. high school or complete two years of military service.
The group hopes to bring attention to the Latino presence in Pittsburgh, as well as the fact that the city has a history of immigrants who originally came to work in the numerous steel mills. 
Michael Friedman and Alfonso Barquera founded Jóvenes Sin Nombres in 2009 in Pittsburgh for Latino youths between the ages of 15 and 25. 
For the current project, the group attended classes at the Carnegie Museum of Art and listened to presentations given by professors Paul Eiss and Therese Tardio of Carnegie Mellon’s history and modern languages departments, as well as professor Lara Putnam of Latin American history at the University of Pittsburgh. 
Life-saving kidney research involved in pilot program
The national Organ Procurement and Transplantation Network recently initiated a pilot program to better match kidneys for paired kidney transplants. Candidates in the pool include living donors who were not compatible with their intended recipients. When the computer runs a matching process, it attempts to match pairs in two- or even three-way exchanges. 
Such a program is possible due to the research of Tuomas Sandholm, a professor in the computer science department. For six years, Sandholm and his colleagues have worked to develop computer algorithms with improved optimization of donor matches.
After years of work, the national pilot program is ready, and it had its first run on Oct. 27. 
During this first run alone, the computer matched seven people with willing kidney donors who were compatible with the recipients. In separate programs within the past three years, two of which used Sandholm’s algorithms, 700 kidney transplant exchanges occurred. Sandholm is encouraged by this test, as a national matching program would provide better results than individual exchanges. 
The country faces a compelling need for such a program, as evidenced by the 86,000 people on the kidney waiting list.

Identities in Conflict: The Recognition of Migrants presents Nancy Foner: “How Exceptional is New York as an Immigrant City?”
Nov. 30 at 4:30 p.m.
Adamson Wing (Baker Hall 136A)
Nancy Foner, distinguished professor of sociology of the City University of New York, will present a lecture on the unique quality of New York as a city receptive of immigrants. Foner will specifically focus on New York’s history of immigrants and  distinctive ethnic and racial diversity. 
In the lecture, she will speak of the changes that immigration has had on the social structure of race and ethnicity within New York, as well as the intergroup relations that the country refers to as a “New York way.”
ULS Journeys presents Nadine Aubry: Lessons from Living Life on the Boundary
Dec. 3 at 4:30 p.m.
Gregg Hall (Porter Hall 100)
Nadine Aubry, the head of the mechanical engineering department and Raymond J. Lane distinguished professor of mechanical engineering, will present a lecture on her professional and personal life experiences “on the boundary.”
In terms of her research and work, mechanical engineering encompasses many fields, including physics, mathematics, engineering, and the arts, while also providing a foundation for aerospace, automotive, nanotechnology, and bioengineering, among other fields. In addition, she will explain her research group’s contributions to the field of mechanical engineering in the division of fluid mechanics. 
Specifically, her research in fluid dynamics has included pioneering the modeling of open flow turbulence and other systems using advanced decomposition techniques and dynamical systems theory. According to www.cmu.edu/uls/december/aubry.html, current research with her team has suggested novel methods for effective mixing, droplet generation, and assembly of micro- and nano-sized neutral particles at fluid-fluid interfaces in 2-D arrays. 
Aubry will explore her life experiences through her lecture as well. Aubry grew up in both Paris and a rural farm in the French Loire Valley. She has also been shaped by working in a male-dominated field, migrating to the United States, and raising her children in the midst of her career as a faculty member and an administrator. She defines her life as “living on a boundary.”
Furthermore, she will include her impression of being a minority and how this feature of her life has been a valuable aid in her profession and her family.
Through her lecture, Aubry hopes to convey her life experiences to the diverse young students of Carnegie Mellon who are also living “on the boundary.”

The editorial “University’s global expansion should take past failures into account” (Forum, Nov. 15) incorrectly stated that the Heinz College program in Australia is being closed. This program has no plans to be suspended; it is the CIT program in Greece that has been suspended. 
In the article “Asian Student Leadership Conference engages campus” (News, Nov. 15), “Sara Lee” should have been spelled “Sara Li,” and her major was incorrectly stated as computer science. Li’s correct major is chemistry. 
“Pittsburgh’s many LGBT-friendly resources” (Pillbox, Nov. 15) was incorrect in captioning a photo as the ALLIES office. The office in the picture was actually SOHO, Carnegie Mellon’s primary LGBT resource center, located in Room 325 in the University Center. The article also referred to the Gertrude Stein Memorial Bookshop and Saint Elmo’s Outwords on East Carson Street in the South Side, but both establishments have closed.

A must-read item for students and professors alike this week is a column in the Nov. 12 issue of The Chronicle of Higher Education. In the column, a contributor under the pseudonym of Ed Dante provides a stunning exposé of the hidden world of “custom essay writing” — hiring someone to complete a writing assignment that will be passed off as one’s own work.
Dante describes in horrifying detail the number of reports, college admissions essays, business proposals, and even full graduate theses he has written on behalf of his customers. Producing up to 40 pages a day, with perhaps 20 different assignments underway at one time, Dante claims that he will earn approximately $66,000 this year creating papers for desperate students in almost any field of study and at any level of education.
Though many Chronicle readers are doubtlessly — and justifiably — outraged over the deep violations of academic integrity being committed by America’s university students, we also must consider what the practice of custom essays says about the educational system itself.
Dante breaks his student clients into two broad groups: those who struggle with communication in general, possibly because of a language barrier, and those he terms “lazy rich kids.” In the case of struggling students, there needs to be a variety of more ethical writing help options available that don’t involve paying thousands of dollars for someone on the Internet to do all the work. Unfortunately, Internet ghostwriters are readily available, and few university courses place much emphasis on developing or monitoring writing skills. This makes custom paper writing an easier option for some students than working to develop their own abilities.
To provide a complete response to custom essay writing, professionals at individual universities and in the wider academic community must be more aware of writing skills and provide more integral support for developing them. Carnegie Mellon’s Intercultural Communication Center offers writing clinics to help students revise specific class assignments or improve writing style in general, and some academic conferences and journals have begun to include author mentoring services, but both of these aids are being aimed at non-native English speakers only. Academic Development offers help with writing, but again, this is outside the classroom. 
In many classrooms and publications, writing standards still take a backseat to exam performance or research results. We argue for an increased focus on all students writing well in any setting where students must write at length. At the same time, professors and advisers should put more care into helping their students’ development as writers. More visible and more viable coaching options would be a strong way to treat the cause of poor writing skills instead of merely its symptoms.

Carnegie Mellon University dedicated a bridge on Oct. 30, 2009 in honor of Randy Pausch, a professor who died in 2008 of pancreatic cancer. Everyone on this campus has either seen or read his “Last Lecture” and has, in one way or another, been deeply affected by the message and wisdom he shared during his last few months on Earth. Yet today, a mere year after the bridge’s dedication, students smoking on the Pausch Bridge are degrading Pausch’s memory.
At any time of day, one can walk along the bridge and see people blatantly and unapologetically smoking. No, Pausch didn’t die from lung cancer triggered by cigarette smoke — and no, people are not smoking in order to maliciously mock Pausch’s memory. But the very fact that people are engaging in an activity that is unarguably linked to the cause of over a dozen types of cancers makes it seem — accurately — as if they don’t consider the implications of their actions.
The fact is that numerous studies from the American Cancer Society (ACS) and universities all over the world have found that smoking is a main cause of pancreatic cancer. A study conducted by the European Institute of Oncology in Italy found that smoking cigarettes caused a 75 percent increase in the risk of pancreatic cancer compared to that of non-smokers. Pancreatic cancer is one of deadliest cancers that exist, meaning that smokers are increasing their risk for cancer as well as the risk for others around them who are forced to endure second-hand smoke as they walk to and from classes.
It is disheartening to walk along the memorial bridge and see the remnants of cigarette butts littering its path, but it is more disheartening to think that students who are considered the bright, innovative intellectuals of tomorrow lack the intelligence or willpower to refrain from smoking atop such an important memorial.
The Carnegie Mellon chapter of the ACS seems to be the only group of people that is stepping up to address the issue of smoking on campus in general. The group is planning to participate in an annual ACS event to get people to quit smoking, but such an initiative isn’t enough. Nothing is going to change until there is either stricter enforcement of the rules regarding smoking on campus or greater penalties for those who see nothing wrong in breaking the rules or disrespecting the memory of Pausch.
Any decent person knows that it would be wrong to go to a civil rights museum and shout a racial slur or attend a Holocaust Remembrance Day celebration wearing a swastika. Likewise, no decent person would be so inclined to show up to a Mothers Against Drunk Driving conference with a bottle of alcohol in hand. 
So what is the reasoning behind why so many people think it is okay to smoke on a bridge dedicated to a great man who lost his life to cancer?

In a recent announcement, Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad urged Iranian girls to marry at age 16 — a further rejection of the family planning program that has been in effect since the 1990s. Ahmadinejad, who was first elected to office in 2005 and recently re-elected in 2009, has always been adamantly opposed to the program, which he labels as “an ungodly and Western import.” He sees no reason why marriage ages have risen into the mid-20s and claims that population growth is essential to Iran’s well-being. He argues that the country could feed a population of 150 million.
I’m sorry, President Ahmadinejad, but I think you need to hit the history books. In my opinion, not only is the idea of forcing girls to marry at such a young age ridiculous, but the plan to further increase the country’s population is just plain stupid. The family planning program was implemented at a time when Iran’s population was growing at a rate of 3 percent per year, and the average fertility was about six children per woman. 
Iranian legislation was devised to limit the number of children per family in recognition of the fact that the government was unable to provide sufficient food, education, housing, and employment to Iran’s population, which, at that time, numbered around 55 million people. As a result of this family planning program, the growth rate dropped sharply to 1.2 percent, and the fertility rate was lowered to around two children per woman.
I would be curious to know exactly how Ahmadinejad plans on supporting those 150 million people that he claims Iran can feed because, to me, it doesn’t seem like he is supporting Iran’s current population of about 75 million people very well. The current Iranian unemployment rate hovers around 9 percent, indicating that there are an estimated 3 million unemployed people of working age in Iran. In addition, surging inflation and poor global economic conditions do not seem conducive to a burst in population growth.
According to Ahmadinejad, however, “I am against saying that two children are enough. Our country has a lot of capacity. It has the capacity for many children to grow in it.... Westerners have got problems. Because their population growth is negative, they are worried and fear that if our population increases, we will triumph over them.”
Mr. President, it’s time you realized that population growth isn’t a Western problem; it’s a global one.

With Thanksgiving and winter break just around the corner, Americans are preparing for all the standard holiday activities: eating turkey and stuffing, lighting candles and trees, hanging out with old friends, and being groped in the airport security line. 
With over 60 airports across the country opting, in response to last winter’s “underwear bomber,” to install full-body scanners operated by the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) in place of normal metal detectors, travelers may now either pass through the new machines or subject themselves to a full pat-down. 
First, the option the TSA wants you to choose: full-body scanners. The new machines are a bit of a mystery to the average traveler; using either backscatter X-ray or millimeter-wave technology, they take an image of you that superhero comic writers dreamed of, one showing guns, bombs, and your naked body. These images are meant to be viewed by another TSA agent in another room. Official policy notwithstanding, there are indications that the images may be saved, hung around the office to laugh at, and then later, of course, leaked to the Internet. But even if you aren’t concerned with displaying your naked body to those the TSA deems worthy, a decision to enter some of these machines ignores their possible and relatively unstudied health risks, which are important enough to have caused pilots to seek (and receive) an alternative screening method. 
Suppose, then, that the full-body scanner doesn’t sound right for you. You can choose a full pat-down instead. As a result, stories and videos of overly abusive and invasive groping techniques have spread across the Internet. These two techniques have caused the TSA to continue to receive more bad publicity than most government agencies can dream of. If miniaturizing your liquids and removing your shoes wasn’t enough, airport security theater seems to be on a never-ending rise. 
But as every media organization, blogger, and traveler with a Twitter account seems to be complaining, it appears a backlash may be near. Orlando’s Sanford Airport is opting to switch to a private company for security instead of the TSA, and New York’s city council is planning legislation to ban backscatter scanners. Hopefully now, with the opposition of pilots, flight attendants, airlines, airports, and local legislators, the TSA will have to actually consider both the security benefits and the customer impediments of its requirements. But this winter, your best bet is still to hop into a line that hasn’t yet been upgraded from a metal detector to a pornoscanner.

The day after Thanksgiving is a day on which I tend to tune out the media in an attempt to ignore America’s growing focus on self. News reports are often filled with stories of arguing consumers, exhausted store clerks, and at least one or two dangerous shopper stampedes. The Internet seems to be filled with coupons and special deals, while the radio is saturated with cheery ads encouraging more spending.
However, this year, you’ll find me curled up in a blanket listening intently to my local radio station.
What I have always considered the national day of self will be transformed into something of a national day for others, due to a recent initiative to name Black Friday as the National Day of Listening, rather than acknowledging its association with shouting shoppers. Begun on Black Friday of 2008, the National Day of Listening is an offshoot of the popular StoryCorps series, which records conversations between average Americans and broadcasts them weekly on National Public Radio. The National Day of Listening was created to offer an alternative to the yearly shopping spree by offering a specific time during which participants could take an hour to create their own StoryCorps-like dialogue.
“[It’s] a meaningful alternative to holiday consumerism,” said StoryCorps’ Saha Evans in a recent article on Good.is. “Listening to one another is the least expensive and most meaningful gift we can give.” According to the article, participants can download a guide to home recording — complete with question suggestions — record their own story, and share it, either by sending along the file or leaving a note about the experience on a “Wall of Listening.”
StoryCorps’ National Day of Listening is a small step in what I see as a national trend toward listening and toward a greater recognition that others may be more important, or at least more interesting, than oneself. Public radio shows focused on the telling and preserving of stories have cropped up on numerous stations and are held weekly across the country.
The Moth Radio Hour presents stories, told live and without notes, by people from all walks of life to standing-room-only crowds worldwide. Each show features simple, old-fashioned storytelling on relevant themes by average Americans who share their stories with The Moth’s directors. The show is produced by Jay Allison and distributed by PRX. It was launched in 2009 and is carried by more than 200 stations across the country. The weekly radio hour is a small part of The Moth’s larger offering, which is outlined on its website themoth.org. It includes six other programs: The Moth Mainstage, The Moth StorySLAM program, The Moth_SHOP Community Program, _The Moth Podcast, _The Moth_SHOP Business Program, and MothUP.
This American Life is a weekly public radio show that includes a grouping of (mostly true) stories told by normal people, brought together under a specific theme each week. This American Life is broadcast on more than 500 stations to about 1.7 million listeners, and it is also the most popular podcast in the country most weeks. It is produced by Chicago Public Media and distributed by Public Radio International. Recent episodes have featured themes such as “Petty Tyrant,” “This Party Sucks,” and “Crybabies.” Contributors range from average people who happen to have interesting stories to tell, to professional writers and comics, including David Sedaris, Mike Birbiglia, Dan Savage, and Sarah Vowell.
I’m personally excited to celebrate this hopeful trend in American media, especially on Black Friday. So while my relatives and friends may be struggling through aisles and lifting boxes, I plan to be shuffling through my local radio station, sipping a cup of tea, and listening to interviews from the StoryCorps collection. If you’d like to join me, you can visit nationaldayoflistening.org to tune in to stories on Black Friday, or to download the tools to record your own.

Hooray! Hunt Library just celebrated its 50th anniversary! Its gift was a set of Color Kinetics LED lights around the outside that, when lit, essentially match the Pausch Bridge.
I spent an evening working in the library this week while the lights were on. I was sitting at the end of a table in the café area, about as far away from a window as one can get in there. As a student trying to get work done, I was frustrated by the exterior lighting. The frequent color changes are distracting, and I found myself looking up every time I noticed a change in my peripheral vision.
The purpose of library giving is to “improve the library for students, meeting their academic needs and enriching their quality of life at Carnegie Mellon” www.cmu.edu/library-giving. The lights were a gift to the library, but they make the library a place that does not meet my academic needs nor enrich my quality of life. I don’t use the library as a place to socialize; I come here when I need to do work in a quiet place. That evening I was frequently distracted by the constant color changes, and I am wary of coming back to the library in the evenings.
On weekends or during the summer when students aren’t using the library, the colored lights are fun and exciting like the Pausch Bridge. However, on weeknights I would urge you to consider choosing a single lighting scheme for the night that doesn’t change. I want to be able to use the library’s services with finals coming up, as well as next semester, but I don’t think it is a good place for me to work anymore.
Did the people spearheading this lighting initiative ever consider how the lights might affect students inside trying to use the building for its intended purpose? The windows outside the Pausch Bridge are mostly faculty members’ offices, and those offices are usually empty during the evenings. Therefore the issue of distraction has probably not been brought up. However, the library is the place to work on campus and is open 24 hours to allow students to have a place to work at all hours.
The lights outside have made the library unusable after dark.

Is it becoming the case that voting, one of the essential freedoms that every qualified American should be able to enjoy, is beginning to back people into a corner? Recent election results suggest that factors unrelated to the views of a candidate are trumping what candidates actually say to the media and in debates. My main concern is that it is becoming the case where a multi-term incumbent candidate is almost assured of victory over anyone, regardless of the actions of either candidate in the lead-up to Election Day.
There are many recent election results that illustrate this point well, but I’d like to point out two in particular. The re-election of Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D–Nev.) and the six-time re-election of U.S. Representative Dennis Kucinich (D–Ohio) in my own district (Ohio’s 10th) are examples of elections that may have been swayed by some of these overarching factors.
Just a few weeks ago, Reid fought tooth and nail against Sharron Angle for his seat in the Senate. A Democratic Nevada Senator since 1986, debates about Reid’s re-election in the historically Republican state (Nevada voted for the Republican candidate in seven out of the last 10 presidential elections) eventually settled on the fact that he was a 24-year tenured Senator who brought millions of federal dollars into Nevada. Despite the fact that the state leans Republican, it returned Reid to the Senate basically because Nevada is suffering hardships from the latest economic collapse. Reid had been in the Senate for almost a quarter-century, earning him the Senate majority leader title as well as chairmanships throughout the years.
Kucinich is a different story, since I have been able to experience firsthand this aspect of voting. In the 2006 and 2008 elections, both of which he won by a wide majority, I strongly considered voting against him because I was not a fan of several of his actions during the 2004 and 2008 presidential campaigns. It looked like he wasn’t paying much attention to Northeast Ohio, the district he was supposed to represent. However, both times I reconsidered after thinking of the potential repercussions that would come to the area if a freshman representative were elected in place of a 14-year veteran who has served on a wide range of committees and subcommittees.
But I wonder if this is the right attitude to take toward such a vitally important part of this country’s government process. Of course, wanting what is best for your district or state is certainly a valid reason to vote someone into office, but to encourage people to vote for someone so explicitly based on tenure is not something I can agree with. It feels like the electoral process has begun to fall into a kind of rut, with citizens in some sort of boring routine where the majority of people don’t actually make decisions on their own but merely vote for the most familiar face on the ballot. Men and women should not be chosen to lead this country based on such arbitrary criteria.

The United States government today is often characterized as bitterly divided between two camps: conservatives and liberals; Republicans and Democrats. While this, unfortunately, does seem to be true, recent events in Alaska have shown that the American electoral system still has room for flexibility. Senator Lisa Murkowski’s victory over Republican Joe Miller and Democrat Scott McAdams in a three-way race was finally announced last week. What made this race exceptional was that Murkowski’s name was not on the ballot — she was a write-in candidate. While the Alaska Senatorial race is unlikely to set a precedent for write-in victories, we believe that the potential transformation of the two-party system that it represents, as well as Murkowski’s comeback from a primary loss, is in the nation’s best interests.
In most elections, the Republican and Democratic primaries determine the only two realistic candidates in a general election. While independent, third-party, and write-in candidates are not uncommon, they are rarely actual contenders to win a race. Primary winners have the backing of the political establishment, with all the campaign funding and high-profile visits that establishment entails. They are often forced to conform to party expectations. By running — and winning — as a write-in candidate, Murkowski is not beholden to the Republican leadership in the Senate. She can break with the party on issues of her choosing. This would send a signal that the power structures in Washington, D.C. are not set in stone. They are capable of changing to be more adaptive to constituents. 
Murkowski showed that democracy can overcome institutional inertia and that primaries are just that — primary.

boy wizard and friend 
want to hide in your bathroom 
you become a newt
take the whole week off 
eat your own weight in turkey 
tryptophan coma
"try the fugu fish," 
he said that fateful evening 
bad sashimi chef
easily we run 
but cannot hide forever 
your stalker finds you
take the high, hard road 
you are rewarded with wealth 
laugh at all the plebs
try not to flinch much 
when the devil takes his due 
he scares easily
cold northern wind blows 
bringing a white Christmas so 
you're trapped in your house
noxious gases come 
you swear you didn't rip one 
ruined interview
just like a spider 
eat the next generation 
not okay by them
go do your homework 
for you, the CS student, 
P/NP ain't shit
fields of nice flowers 
swaying gently in the breeze 
wake up, time for class
"eat all of your peas," 
your mother always told you 
now you have green skin
