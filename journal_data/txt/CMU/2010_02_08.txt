In yesterday’s Super Bowl, two teams from different backgrounds but with many similarities faced off in a thrilling championship game. The city of New Orleans, only five years removed from the devastating Hurricane Katrina, has seen the Saints as a beacon of hope. Meanwhile, the Colts are merely looking to solidify themselves as one of the most dominant teams of the decade. The final result sent the people of New Orleans into a Mardi Gras-like celebration, as the Saints came out victorious by a score of 31–17.
Throughout the season, the Colts players and coaches have been under the microscope for every game. After starting out the season with 14 straight victories, Indianapolis’ head coach Jim Caldwell made what could be the most debated call of the season. Leading 15–10 against the New York Jets, Caldwell pulled his starters in order to keep his players healthy for the playoffs. The Jets feasted on the Colts’ reserves, and the hopes for a perfect season faded away. Despite much scrutiny, this decision did not affect the Colts’ Super Bowl run, as they defeated the Baltimore Ravens and the Jets on their way to their third-ever Super Bowl appearance.
Seeking the Lombardi Trophy for the first time ever, the New Orleans Saints followed a similar path as the Colts. They began their season with 13 straight wins and were considered the best team in the NFL for a long period of time. However, they finished the season with three consecutive losses, which led to many questions about the Saints’ toughness and desire at the end of the season. The Saints squashed these doubts with convincing wins over the defending NFC champion Arizona Cardinals and the Brett Favre-led Minnesota Vikings.
With the 2010 Pro Football Hall of Fame inductees looking on last night, the Saints won the coin toss and elected to receive. However, they were unable to capitalize and had to punt the ball to the potent Colts offense. With two impressive drives led by the impeccable Peyton Manning, the Colts staked themselves to an early 10–0 lead. Wide receiver Pierre Garcon, a native of Haiti, capped the longest drive in Super Bowl history with a receiving touchdown from 19 yards out.
Down 10 and reeling, the Saints needed a spark to keep this game from being a blowout. The second quarter seemed to wake them up, as they cut the lead to 10–3 and were threatening at the Colts’ 1-yard line. Looking to tie up the score, the Saints went for it on fourth down from the 1-yard line with a rush to the right by tailback Mike Bell. As quarterback Drew Brees handed the ball off, a wave of white jerseys smothered Bell for a loss, which kept the score at 10–3. The Saints, while dominating the second quarter, couldn’t take the lead and entered the locker room at halftime down 10–6.
After an exciting first half and a not-so-exciting halftime performance from The Who, the third quarter started off with a play that no one was expecting. Wily Saints coach Sean Payton decided to try and keep the ball out of Manning’s and the Colts’ hands by going for an unexpected onside kick. The kick was perfectly executed, and the Saints recovered. Soon, running back Pierre Thomas punched it into the end zone to give the Saints their first lead of the game, 13–10. A back-and-forth third quarter soon ended with the Colts ahead, 17–16.
Up by one going into the fourth quarter with the ball, the Colts seemed to be in a good position to win the game. Saints fans held their breath as the Colts advanced to the New Orleans 37-yard line. Colts head coach Jim Caldwell was faced with a decision: to punt the ball or to go for a long 54-yard field goal from 42-year-old Matt Stover. 
In what was a questionable decision, Caldwell went for the field goal and was disappointed. Stover missed wide left and the Saints were given great field position. A few Brees passes later and after a circus catch by fourth-string receiver Lance Moore, the Saints scored a touchdown and converted for an extra two points, extending their lead to 24–17.
Now down seven, it was time for Manning to prove that he is the best quarterback in the league. Things were looking good as the Colts marched down to the Saints’ 40-yard line. Manning dropped back to pass, and the Saints countered with an all-out blitz. Due to the pressure, Manning had to get rid of the ball and threw to one of his short routes. Unfortunately for him, Saints cornerback Tracy Porter read his eyes and jumped the route. Porter intercepted the wayward Manning pass and raced 70 yards to the end zone as the city of New Orleans erupted in pure ecstasy.

The Carnegie Mellon swimming and diving team competed yesterday at the University of Pittsburgh. The men’s swimming and diving team fell 196–97 to end their season with a record of 7–4. The women’s swimming and diving team also lost, with a final record of 6–6. Senior members of the team tapered for their last meet of the season.
The women’s swimming and diving team started out with the 1000-yard freestyle, with first-year Sarah Menio placing third with a time of 11:23.51. Other notable mentions include first-years Breanna Stillo and Price Kinney’s second- and third-place finishes in the 100-yard breaststroke, with times of 1:09.51 and 1:10.00, respectively. The veteran swimmers put their names on the board as well. Senior Sara Andrews placed fifth in the 200-yard freestyle, finishing with 1:59.05 on the clock, while junior Molly Evans touched third in the 100-yard backstroke with a time of 59.03.
This meet also saw breakthroughs in personal records for a few hardworking Tartans. Sophomore Sam Miner dropped time in both of her events, dropping two seconds in the 100-yard breaststroke to 1:12.52 and dropping seven seconds in the 200-yard breaststroke with a final time of 2:35.86. “It’s a really exciting feeling to drop time like that after working hard all season,” Miner said. “Something just clicked in the water today, and it was a great way to end the season.”
Junior Rebecca Ussai and sophomore Hannah Gonzalez finished second and third as well in the 200-yard butterfly, finishing with times of 2:14.18 and 2:14.31, respectively.
For the men’s swimming and diving team, the team of seniors Scott Moorby and Jason Huber, junior Travis Piper, and sophomore Ryan Pearl set the mood with a third-place in the 200 medley relay. 
The men’s swimming team swept the 1000-yard freestyle, with senior Gates Winkler placing first, junior  Frank Olechnowicz placing second, and first-year Karl Weisling finishing third. Olechnowicz also placed second in the 500-yard freestyle with a time of 4:47.87.
Senior Jon Spring finished third in the 200-yard freestyle with a time of 1:46.03. Senior Jeff Dahlen also placed third in the 100-yard backstroke with a time of 53.85 and fourth in the 200-yard backstroke with a 1:58.39.
Although the climate may have brought a few Tartans down, Dahlen was able to move past the gloomy weather “It felt good to swim today,” he said. “I thought I would be a little tight because of being stuck inside in the weather, but when I got in for warm-up, I felt ready to go.”
Tartans of all age groups were able to record strong finishes, including the newest members of the team. First-year Arthur Hong dropped nearly three seconds in the 200-yard butterfly, swimming a time of 1:57.73. Huber finished fourth in the 100-yard breaststroke in 1:01.13. First-year Dan Glaser-Garbrick swam the 100-yard butterfly in a second-place time of 52.29, and he touched fourth in the 200-yard IM in a time of 1:59.08. The men ended the meet sweeping the 200-yard freestyle relay as well.
The men’s and women’s swimming and diving team will be heading next to Atlanta on Feb. 18 for the start of the University Athletic Association Championships.

The Tartans finished a tough weekend against New York University on Friday and Brandeis University on Sunday. The squad had disappointing losses against NYU, 52–66, and Brandeis, 50–59. Carnegie Mellon is now 8–12 for the season with a University Athletic Association (UAA) record of 1–8.
On Friday, the Tartans kept the game against NYU close in the first half. Carnegie Mellon’s rebounding — 23 total in the first half — blocked the Violets on the offensive end, but NYU responded with their own good defense, forcing 20 turnovers in the first half. New York went on a 0–9 run midway through the half to push the largest lead of the game, 10–27. The Tartans responded, and cut the deficit to 12 over the last seven minutes of the half. Junior guard Jessica Buranovsky hit the last jumper of the half, making the score 23–35.
Carnegie Mellon brought the score to within five points with eight minutes left off of two treys, hit by Buranovsky and sophomore forward Jen Larsen. However, NYU countered with two straight three-pointers and finished the game with a 10–19 run for a 52–66 win.
Fifth-year senior Rachelle Roll recorded her second double-double of the season with 13 points and 14 rebounds. Larsen followed with 12 points, and first-year forward Emily Peel added nine points.
Despite the loss, the Tartans are still confident that they will pull out more wins. “In order for our team to end this season strong, we have to take one game at a time and focus on beating and playing our best each game, which I know we will all do,” Peel said.
Carnegie Mellon played Brandeis University for their fifth home game of the season. Even though they did not pull out the win, the Tartans put up a valiant effort and dropped a 50–59 decision.
Both teams came out evenly strong, exchanging baskets and the lead. The score tied seven times and the lead changed 10 times in the first half. First-year guard Brit Phillips tallied 10 points and four steals for the half. The close halftime score — 26–28 — reflected both teams’ struggle to overcome the other.
Larsen tied the game at 37–37 with 13:02 left in the game with a jumper. Brandeis responded with free throws a minute later, taking the lead for good. The game ended with a 50–59 decision.
Larsen led the Tartans with 15 points and Peel pulled down 10 rebounds.
Looking ahead to the rest of the UAA season, Peel said the team aims to “continue to work hard on [their] offenses” and “learn from the mistakes made [in] the first [games].”
The Tartans square off at home Friday at 6 p.m. against Emory University.

Over the weekend, the Carnegie Mellon men’s basketball team hosted two University Athletic Association rivals: New York University and Brandeis University. With just five games remaining in the season, the Tartans were unable to overcome a 13-game losing streak.
On Friday, the Tartans tipped off against the Violets of New York University hungry for a win, after losing to the Violets in the last minute of play in their previous matchup. The Tartans were off to a great start, taking a 10–4 lead early in the half, but eventually fell to their opponents 58–59.
After the Tartans’ early lead, the Violets battled back and challenged the Tartans, but a three-pointer by sophomore John Duhring kept the Tartans on top. Senior Jack Anderson closed the half going 4–4 and giving the Tartans a 31–25 lead.
Determined to put two solid halves together, the Tartans came out hot after the break, going on a 13–4 streak and increasing their lead to 15. Despite the opposing momentum, the Violets did not roll over for the Tartans, and instead went on an 18-point run in four minutes to take a 47–44 lead. The Tartans stayed in the game and regained a 58–55 lead with just 1:41 remaining in the game.
Four missed free throws signaled the demise for the Tartans as they threw away four chances to win the game. After the fourth missed free throw, the Tartans committed their seventh foul of the game, sending the Violets to the line. The Violets converted on both free throws to take a 59–58 lead and were able to hold off the Tartans for the remaining 16 seconds.
Anderson led the Tartans with 22 points while senior Jon Wolleben added 11. Duhring and junior Matt Pettit led the boards-grabbing with eight apiece.
On Sunday the Tartans were unable to rally the troops and fell 62–43 to Brandeis University. The loss moved the Tartans to 4–16 overall and 0–9 in league play.
The cold weather must have gotten to the players, as both teams were unable to sink a shot in the first four minutes of play. The Tartans finally got on the board with a layup by Pettit but the Judges warmed up and took control of the game. After the first period of play, the Judges led the Tartans 29–22.
Brandeis maintained consistent play through the second half, giving the Tartans their ninth league defeat. The Tartans shot 30 percent from the field and only 50 percent from the line.
Pettit and Duhring led the Tartans’ offense with 13 points apiece.
“The rest of the season is going to be about pride,” said Wolleben after the loss. “We have struggled this season and we really need to figure things out so we can finish the season with a few wins under our belt.”
The Tartans are back in action next weekend as they host Emory University and Rochester University.

For the average Carnegie Mellon student, balancing schoolwork and a social life is quite a feat. If you add in being a key member of the varsity cross country and track and field teams, intramural sports, and several clubs, you end up with a very organized and dedicated student. Junior Laura McKee, a chemical and biomedical engineering double major, has mastered this routine with ease and still has time for leisurely activities, such as late-night trips to Fuel & Fuddle.
McKee, a Maryland native, felt drawn to Carnegie Mellon because of the competitive engineering program, the “home feel of a small suburb” that Pittsburgh emulates, and plenty of extracurricular activities she could become involved in. 
The one factor which made Carnegie Mellon her top choice was the chance to further her passion for running through the cross country and track teams. McKee’s interest in running started in high school and has propelled her to become one of Carnegie Mellon’s finest 800-meter and one-mile runners. This season, she hopes to shatter her personal records and help the team place well at its next University Athletic Association meet in March.
However as impressive as McKee’s athletic records are, they are only one part of her life. Academically, McKee excels equally. When she is not helping local farmers and soup kitchens create a “sustainable network” as a member of the CIT Dean’s Leadership Fellows Program, she dedicates her time to the Student Athlete Advisory Committee (SAAC), Engineers Without Borders, the Society of Women Engineers, and several other engineering-related clubs. 
She states that her favorite part of school is the people. “Everyone here is brilliant and driven in whatever particular field they are studying. It’s inspiring to be around people who are so passionate about their lives,” she said. Upon graduation, McKee hopes to find a career in industry. With a little over a year left of school, McKee’s prospects for the future look very bright.

After the resignation of previous five-year head coach Sue Willard in December, the Director of Carnegie Mellon University Athletics Susan Bassett hired Yon Struble as head coach for the women’s soccer program, effective March 1.
“I’m incredibly excited to be the next head women’s soccer coach at Carnegie Mellon University,” said Struble. “The combination of academics and athletics encapsulate what I feel the college experience should be about, and I am honored to have been given this opportunity.”
Struble, a United States Soccer Federation “A” licensed coach, comes from the Division I women’s soccer program at Western Carolina University, where he was assistant coach. He helped lead the Catamounts to their fifthstraight winning season and fifth consecutive Team Academic Award by the National Soccer Coaches Association of America (NSCAA). Serving as the recruiting coordinator, youth camp director, technical director for team training, and goalkeeper trainer, Struble can bring his expertise to the Tartans team.
“Yon Struble brings impressive credentials, including national recognition as the 2008 National Girls Coach of the Year, to lead the Tartan women’s soccer program,” said Bassett. 
“He has coached collegiately at the Division I and III level, and most importantly, sees himself as an educator first and foremost. I am confident that Yon will provide exceptional leadership for our women’s soccer program and that under his guidance we will grow in important ways. He will be an asset to our department, Carnegie Mellon, and the Greater Pittsburgh community.”
Prior to his time at Western Carolina, Struble coached several elite teams at Norcross Soccer Academy, Georgia State University, Georgia Olympic Development Program (ODP), Union College, and eastern New York ODP. In 2008, Struble was awarded United States Youth Soccer National Girls Competitive Coach of the Year, and in 2007, he was awarded the ODP Georgia Coach of the Year and Region III Coach of the Year, leading to his National Coach of the Year Award.
With the athletics department’s support, the current women’s squad was able to interview potential candidates for the head coach position, and it came to the unanimous decision that Struble would be a great fit. 
A rising senior for next season, Caroline Danka commented on the new arrival: “Our whole team is ecstatic about Coach Struble taking the position. We’re a very open and honest team with a lot of passion for soccer, and he has reflected every bit of our excitement for the upcoming season. The athletic department knows we’re a competitive team and really worked to find us someone with experience and personality we respect, and who also mimics our drive. Ask any girl on the team about Coach, she’ll light up!”
Struble graduated from Division I Stetson University with a degree in elementary education in 1995, while playing collegiate soccer for The Hatter. He also received a master of arts in reading education in 2005 while at Georgia State. 
After graduation from Stetson, Struble went off to compete in the Empire State Games, leading the men’s open team to the 1996 gold medal. 
He played professionally for the New York Capital District Alleycats of the USISL from 1997 to 1999.
“I want to thank Susan Bassett, the Tartan athletic staff and the school administration for having the confidence in my ability to lead [the] Tartan women’s soccer program in a new direction,” Struble concluded. “I know with their support we can lead the program to new heights in the UAA and at the national level.”

The Carnegie Mellon crew team once again hit the water after a break from last semester’s Head of the Occoquan meet, this time participating in the 18th annual Pittsburgh Indoor Rowing Championships. The rowers’ hard winter training paid off. The crew team took the top spots in many of the events to earn an overall second place with 102 points, only 18 behind the winner, the University of Pittsburgh.
The Tartans took the top spot in the open mixed six-person relay, crossing the finish line of the 3000-meter course in 9:46.40. 
Other notable highlights included senior Megan Larcom’s and junior Claire Herdeman’s taking third and fourth for the lightweight open women’s event and a top-three domination of the lightweight open men’s event, with juniors Jonah Coste, Edward Burns, and Sean Lubner at first through third, respectively.
First-year Russell Kirmayer was optimistic about his team’s results, and has high hopes for the future. “Overall we did excellently. We might not have won when comparing points, but as a team we had many excellent times, and many people, including myself, improved their 2000-meter time by a significant amount,” Kirmayer noted. “At Heart Attack on the 27th, I’m hoping we will do just as well and win the majority of races like we did at the indoor races last weekend. As a novice team, we are doing two workouts a day and making sure we stay flexible with yoga sessions, and overall we are trying to stay healthy and not overwork ourselves too much.”
Tartan excellence did not stop at the varsity level. In the novice category, junior Brian Aebersold took first in the 2000-meter open novice men’s event, rowing to a finish in 6:34.10. First-year Brendan White nabbed a solid victory as well, with a 6:54.60 time in the lightweight open novice men’s contest.
The crew team will take a three-week hiatus as the members prepare for the Carnegie Mellon Heart Attack Indoor Sprints, an indoor meet joined by the University of Pittsburgh, Duquesne University, and several other university-level rowing clubs, set to take place in Wiegand Gym on Feb. 27.

When former Tartans’ soccer coach Nick Gaudioso was first trying to bring in speedy winger Ricky Griffin to Carnegie Mellon University, few would have predicted that the Westchester, N.Y. native would be one of the best players in Carnegie Mellon men’s soccer history. As a senior in high school, Griffin was not highly recruited to play soccer in college. Despite this, Griffin caught the eye of Carnegie Mellon’s and arch-rival University of Rochester’s soccer programs.
In the beginning, Griffin was keen on attending Rochester, but drawbacks such as a lack of promised playing time led Griffin to look at his other option, Carnegie Mellon. Griffin was then drawn in by the quality of the Tepper School of Business and by the welcoming coaching staff that saw Griffin as a key component in their plans for the future. At Carnegie Mellon, playing time was certainly not an issue as Griffin started in all 75 games of his college career.
Griffin and the current senior class have been a part of the resurrection of soccer at Carnegie Mellon. In 2008, Arron Lujan took over as the head coach of the men’s soccer team in what many saw as a surprising move. “Everyone enjoyed playing for Coach Gaudioso. The man has coached at Carnegie Mellon for 26 years and no one really expected the coaching change to happen,” Griffin said. 
However, Griffin admits that “had it not been for the new system [3–5–2 formation that Lujan brought], I would have never been able to reach my best ability.”
Under Gaudioso, Griffin played as an outside midfielder and was constrained by defensive responsibilities; however, Lujan made the key change by playing Griffin as one of the two strikers. A dramatic difference could even be seen in Griffin’s statistics, as Griffin scored just 15 goals under Gaudioso and 36 under Lujan.
The hard work of the current seniors and Lujan’s tactics paid off as they reached the NCAA Division III Tournament for the first time in three years. Although they were pleased with this accomplishment, the seniors wanted more.
“Going into the fall season this past year, I was very thankful for what I have already achieved at Carnegie Mellon. Not to mention, I have been able to be a part of a powerful offense that included fellow seniors Jon Simon, Pat Lutz, Keith Haselhoff, and Ryan Browne. The best thing had to have been that we as classmates were great friends and had a real bond on and off the field,” Griffin said.
As a team, the Tartans had three major goals this past year: win the University Athletic Association league title, host a playoff game, and ultimately, be better than last year. 
Although the Tartans ended the year as league co-champions, their efforts resulted in the achievement of all three of their goals. 
Not only were they better than last year, they were better than any other Carnegie Mellon men’s soccer team, as they were able to reach the third round of the NCAA tournament for the first time in school history.
As for Griffin, he capped off a tremendous career with numerous school records, as well as being a two-time second team All-American, two-time UAA Player of the Year, two-time CoSIDA Academic All-American, and the all-time season point leader in Carnegie Mellon history. His accolades have been noticed by United Soccer Leagues First Division (USL-1) soccer coaches, who have invited him to try out in their pre-season combines. 
Despite the attractiveness of this offer, Griffin still plans on taking up the trading position that he has accepted this past fall, after he graduates. Regardless of whatever path he chooses, he will always be remembered as one of Carnegie Mellon’s best athletes.

Experts may agree that reducing carbon dioxide emissions is the best solution to solving the problem of global warming, but an engineer at Carnegie Mellon has created a new alternative. Called geoengineering, it is the science of intentionally altering the Earth’s climate to combat environmental hazards.
Granger Morgan, the head of the department of engineering and public policy in the Carnegie Institute of Technology, said that geoengineering is “always in the shadows or on the back burner” when it comes to addressing environmental issues. Alongside David W. Keith of the University of Calgary in Alberta and Edward Parson of the University of Michigan, Morgan aims to teach the public about the possibilities of geoengineering.
Geoengineering has been around since the briefing of President Lyndon Johnson on climate change in the 1960s. Ever since that introduction about environmental danger, the international community has made slow progress in changing carbon dioxide levels. At first, people worried about the use of the technology for ill intentions. But 40 years later, ill intention has become the least of the problems.
Morgan’s particular type of geoengineering, known as solar radiation management (SRM), involves putting fine particles into the atmosphere, much like the smoke that enters the atmosphere after a volcano erupts. One of the suggested fine particles, sulfur dioxide, is actually a component of volcanic ash. These particles are effective at reflecting sunlight, thereby reducing the amount of sunlight that passes through the atmosphere. According to an opinion article Morgan wrote for the scientific journal Nature, the method’s relatively low cost (when compared to the larger cost of emission cuts) and the speed (it can reduce global temperatures in the time span of only a few months) are also big benefits.
Besides the gradual rise of average temperatures worldwide, carbon dioxide levels have led to the acidification of the ocean to levels 30 percent higher than during pre-industrial times. “By the end of this century,” Morgan predicts, “we might lose most of our coral reefs as the ocean becomes too acidic to lay down deposits.”
If SRM is an option taken in the future, Morgan advises seeking multilateral action with countries all over the world. Without strong relations between countries regarding SRM, nations would disagree on when to use the SRM option versus when to focus on reducing emissions. There is currently no treaty regarding geoengineering practices, so, according to Morgan’s article in Nature, “immediate negotiation of a treaty is probably not advisable.”
Instead, Morgan and his team suggest strong links be formed between researchers, government officials, and policy makers. The first step would be conducting research and making risk assessments on the technology by independent teams, while experts and world leaders could discuss possible implications in risk, acceptability, and regulation.
Morgan dispels any question about potential health hazards of SRM. Although sulfur dioxide has been proven to cause acid rain, for example, the small quantity that would be placed into the atmosphere would cause little change to current amounts of acid rain, he said.
One of the largest problems with this process today is the risk of dependency on solar radiation management. Geoengineering, Morgan emphasized, only reduces the amount of sunlight that passes through the atmosphere, but does nothing for reducing carbon dioxide emissions. He compared the life of a carbon dioxide molecule to “a bathtub with a large faucet and a small drain.” Carbon dioxide breaks down much more slowly than it accumulates.
Dependency yields other unpleasant side effects as well. The sheer price of continuously placing fine particles into the atmosphere is enough of a deterrent. Side effects of the particles are a net cooling of temperatures, less precipitation, less evaporation, and the protection of some areas of the world more than others. The carbon dioxide levels would continue to rise, and once this temporary solution could not be supported any longer, the heating of the earth due to the built-up carbon dioxide would be even greater.
In order to analyze these issues and many others, reports British newspaper The Guardian, scientists will host a summit in California in March.

Using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) technology, members of the Center for Cognitive Brain Imaging have gained deep insight into the way human brains categorize objects. In a breakthrough that demonstrates the interdepartmental cooperation here at Carnegie Mellon, neuroscientists Marcel Just and Vladimir Cherkassky and computer scientists Tom Mitchell and Sandesh Aryal have arrived at results that bode well for human-computer interfaces and neuropsychiatry.
Their research has concluded that humans represent all non-human objects in terms of three classes or dimensions. Just defines these dimensions as having to do with eating, shelter, and the way the object is used. He explained that when one sees an object, the brain thinks, “Can I eat it? How do I hold it? Can it give me shelter?” Indeed, all concrete objects are represented in terms of these three dimensions, much in the way that all places in space are represented by the three dimensions that we experience every day.
The technology behind the study, fMRI, is similar to the magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) machines used in hospitals. The basic idea is that when a particular part of the brain is active, it receives more blood, and the increased blood flow can be seen by MRI machines. Researchers cannot directly tell what a person is thinking, but they can tell where the thinking is happening and infer from there, since certain parts of the brain are used for certain functions. In the context of the research, it was found that objects belonging to a particular dimension all triggered activity in a particular part of the brain.
Just feels that these dimensions point back to our evolutionary origins, noting that “there is a biological predisposition to consider objects with respect to those three dimensions.” He also believes that most other animals have similar methods for representing objects because “there are fundamental biological concerns with eating, usage, and shelter.”
According to a press release by Carnegie Mellon, the actual experiment Just and his team carried out involves placing people in an fMRI machine and studying which parts of their brain are activated when they think about specific objects. Two additional results that the research team noted were that they could predict which parts of the brain would be activated by new words and that they could actually tell how many objects were being thought about. As Just puts it, the researchers can “identify the quantity a person is thinking about, as long as [they] instantiate it as an object.”
This raises an interesting point. “As advanced and abstract as we think we are ... we’re still concerned about food,” Just stated. It seems that our mental structures have not really caught up to something as old and fundamental as numbers. Thus, Just extends the metaphor to note that may of the more abstract concepts that we take for granted are actually second-order representations and not fundamental to the way we think.
Just provided two examples of the implications of his research. The first is that this research paves the way for further improvements in direct communications between the human mind and machines. He pointed out that while the current fMRI technology is both cumbersome and expensive, teams are working on more efficient ways of performing the same scans. Second, he mentioned the applications relating to determining the fundamental causes of many mental disorders, stating that people with autism may show less activity in the areas dealing with social concepts. A deeper understanding of the low-level mental processes would help researchers understand the causes of such diseases and possibly lead to better ways to deal with them.
Just’s future plans include the opening of a new brain imaging center on campus, which, he said, will have the only MRI machine operated by a computer science department in the world. Further improvements in this technology could allow people to communicate with computers by thought alone. In the next year, Just would like to have a demonstration where “someone in the MRI scanner is thinking ‘I want an apple’ and a robot is going to go and hand them an apple.”

Of the many stories of love and punishment, one of the most popular is that of Ondine. According to German folklore, Ondine was a nymph who fell in love with a mortal. On learning that Ondine’s lover was unfaithful, the angered king of nymphs cursed the mortal. The mortal would now have to remember to deliberately perform functions such as breathing, which are normally involuntary. The mortal lived throughout the day, but when he fell asleep, he forgot to breathe and died.
The story, as told in an article on www.emedicine.net, is not as fanciful as it seems. Congenital central hypoventilation syndrome (CCHS), also known as Ondine’s curse, affects involuntary breathing in patients. During the day when the patients are awake, they can make conscious, voluntary efforts to breathe regularly and manage to function normally. However, when they sleep, they cannot make such voluntary efforts to breathe. Thus, the patients tend to have slow and shallow breathing at night, a condition termed hypoventilation.
CCHS is caused by a malfunction of the autonomic nervous system (ANS), which is the part of the nervous system responsible for controlling the involuntary functions of the body. Malformation of the ANS during early development is the main cause of CCHS. In congruence with the theory that the ANS of such patients is severely affected, many other functions that are controlled by the ANS are also affected. Thus, these patients have a hard time regulating body temperature and heart rate. Also, their eyes are not adequately responsive to light, and their blood pressure varies to a great extent. 
Although the congenital form of the disease is caused by an ANS defect, damage to certain areas of the brain, such as the brain stem, that are responsible for controlling involuntary functions like breathing can also lead to similar symptoms. Since the majority of the cases of CCHS are caused by developmental defects, they can be traced back to a mutation in a gene needed for proper development. The GeneReviews section of the website of the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) states that CCHS is linked to a mutation in the PHOX2B gene. Nearly 92 percent of the patients with CCHS have a mutation in PHOX2B gene. Analysis has also shown that the mutation is a dominant trait, which means that having one defective copy of the gene is enough to cause the disease.
Considering the fatal nature of the disease, many researchers have tried to develop successful treatments for the condition. Simply providing extra oxygen to such patients is not useful. Furthermore, medicines for stimul    ating the respiratory system have not shown much effectiveness when treating such patients. As of now, the most successful method of managing the condition is to provide mechanical ventilation to the patients when they sleep at night. Infants may require 24-hour ventilation, and in severe cases, a tracheostomy — where an incision is made in the windpipe — may be needed to provide adequate oxygen.
Another possible method of dealing with the condition involves stimulating the phrenic nerve. The role of the phrenic nerve is to control the diaphragm, which controls the expansion of the lungs. By stimulating this nerve, the proper movements of the diaphragm could be restored.
Although management of the condition is difficult, it is not impossible. The GeneReviews page for the disease on the NCBI website states that many of the patients who were ventilated and given proper management and care are now around 20 years of age. Therefore, with proper management, children suffering from CCHS can lead a relatively normal and long life.

The audiophile’s worst nightmare is the drone of ambient noise distracting from an otherwise clear music file. Even recreational listeners know that listening to music can be difficult when in crowded, noisy spaces. Trying to listen to music on a plane can be nearly impossible without making the volume uncomfortably loud.
Fortunately, noise-canceling technology is available for headphones, allowing listeners to hear music with reduced background noise. Noise-canceling is based on the simple property that sound is composed of longitudinal waves. Longitudinal waves are also known as compression waves because they vibrate in the same direction as they are moving. This is similar to stretching a slinky and pushing one end toward the other end, creating compressions in the slinky. The compression of the coil seems to travel lengthwise down the slinky. The sections that are not compressed but extended are called rarefactions.
In the case of sound waves, air is the medium through which waves can propagate. Energy from vibrations will create compressions and rarefactions that can travel through the air. When air changes its density by getting closer together or farther apart, our ears will detect this as noise.
When one sound wave overlaps with another sound wave, two different scenarios can occur. If the compressions occur in the same place, the overall air pressure will increase, and the sound will be perceived as being louder. If a compression in one wave occurs where a rarefaction occurs in the other wave, the overall amount the air pressure changes will decrease, so the sound will be perceived as quieter. This is known as destructive interference, and it is the basis behind noise-canceling for headphones. Perfect destructive interference occurs when waves are 180 degrees out of phase, meaning the compressions and rarefactions are perfectly aligned. Electronic sound file data encodes for electrical signals, which are sent through the headphone to produce longitudinal sound waves.
A noise-canceling headphone can be either active or passive. Passive types have sound-absorbing material fitted inside the part of the headphone that fits around the ear, which allows the headphone to absorb 20 decibels of sound. A sound-absorbing material is usually much better at canceling high-frequency sounds, but low-frequency sounds — such as the rumble of a plane engine — can still be heard. An active noise-canceling headphone has both sound-absorbing material and another barrier against unwanted noise. Generally, the headphones have a microphone that allows them to listen to external sounds that are not coming from the music being played. According to Headwize, a headphone resource website, a noise that is 180 degrees out of phase with the unwanted noise will then be created by a speaker. This should theoretically cancel out the noise perfectly.
However, noise-canceling is not perfect. It works well for constant noises but does not effectively cancel voices or sounds that change constantly and rapidly in pitch. Also, the electronics need battery power to function, which means batteries have to be recharged or replaced. The existence of a battery will add to the bulkiness of the headphones, which already are heavier because of the sound-absorbing material and extra electronics needed.
Noise-canceling is a welcomed addition to headphones, but its cost may be a deterrent to some buyers. For others, it may suffice just to turn up the volume. As headphone technology continues to improve, hearing unwanted noises will hopefully be a thing of the past.

Energy drinks linked to heart attack risk
Australian research has claimed a single serving of an energy drink can significantly boost blood pressure and alter normal blood vessel function, increasing the risk of heart attacks. Researchers at the University of Adelaide and Royal Adelaide Hospital have conducted a study involving 50 healthy volunteers aged 20 to identify the effects of energy drinks on the human cardiovascular system.
Results show that a small amount of energy drink, 250 milliliters, can increase blood clotting potential and drastically modify blood vessel function, both of which increase the risk of heart attacks. Energy drinks are widespread among students and exercise enthusiasts. The study was prompted by reports of heart attacks and related heart problems linked with the consumption of energy drinks. 
The results of the study have been published in The American Journal of Medicine. Along with France and Denmark, the New South Wales government has moved to pass guidelines to regulate the amount of caffeine in such beverages.

Nerve cells created from skin cells
Dr. Marius Wernig and his team of researchers at the Institute for Stem Cell Biology and Regenerative Medicine at Stanford University have discovered a means to transform skin cells into neurons. Researchers at Stanford University claim skin cells are capable of maturing into any desired cell type. They have successfully transformed the skin cells of mice into nerve cells that are similar in most respects to the normal healthy neuron. The only drawback of the new “induced neuronal cells” is that they do not proliferate as well as primitive stem cells. However, Wernig believes these problems can be overcome.
While this study deals with mice, past stem cell research has been replicated in humans within months. Stem cell research has aimed to transform cells from one type to another, and Wernig and his team have finally been able to achieve this without using stem cells. Up until this study, only embryonic stem cells have been manipulated to become a desired cell type. Now, while not explicitly precluding their use, this study does provide a method to avoid using embryonic stem cells.

Molecular transistor devised
Scientists from the U.S. and South Korea have together devised a transistor comprised of only a benzene ring and two gold electrodes. Today, transistors are around 45 nanometers wide, and these devices act as amplifiers and switches that run our computers. The team devised two types of molecular transistors, one consisting of a string of eight methylene groups between two electrodes and the other consisting of six methylene groups connected together to form a benzene ring. Methylene is a chemical species consisting of one carbon atom and two hydrogen atoms. While both worked, the first required large amounts of energy while the second required much less.
The team stressed the need to not only reduce the size of the transistors, but also to reduce the amount of energy spent in transferring data. These results seem more like a discovery and not a realizable transistor for computing, as multiple transistors would be required to manufacture a processor. As of now, there are no existing methods to connect many benzene rings together in such a way as to allow for accurate data manipulation.

As Feb. 14 approaches and you admire your crush from afar, consider the benefits and consequences of having a first date on Valentine’s Day. But gathering the courage to ask your crush out is stressful enough without having to consistently come up with unique and romantic date ideas. Look no further, for here is a quick guide on where and what to do this Valentine’s Day in Pittsburgh. Your aim is to fit your budget, ensure your date has a great time, and leave him or her wanting more!
First and foremost, all girls love flowers. If she tells you she doesn’t care about receiving them (unless she is allergic to them, of course), take it as the clue to buy her flowers. If not a bouquet, even a single rose works like a charm. Ladies, all guys love it when you dress to impress. Don’t overdo it, but smell fresh as a daisy. So go ahead; look pretty for him and yourself. If it’s just a night out with your friends, go all out. Look the best you ever have; you might just bump into someone worth meeting.
Second, plan to go out for dinner and make reservations soon, before they are all booked. Restaurants such as Typhoon in Shadyside are great places to go on a first date. Typhoon is a beautiful, trendy restaurant with stunning floral arrangements that add to the romantic atmosphere. The Thai food is divine, and it is a great place to merge perfect dining and conversation. Definitely try the sticky rice with mango: It is the most popular dessert there.
If you are going just out with friends, I would recommend a fun restaurant or bar, like Nakama in the South Side. Even restaurants such as Girasole on Walnut Street, the Melting Pot at Station Square, Silk Elephant in Squirrel Hill, or Spice Island Tea House in Oakland are great date places. They serve great food and their atmospheres are perfect for a date. Try to book corner seats to give yourself more privacy and allow you to talk without much disturbance.
If you don’t want to go out and you want to make it an intimate affair, I would recommend cooking. (Read our Valentine’s Day recipe article on B12 for fantastic ideas.) Nothing works better than delicious food, candles, and the two of you. You could stop by Dozen Cupcakes in Squirrel Hill and check out their Valentine’s Day special menu, which includes delectable red velvet cupcakes.
After eating out at a great restaurant, try stopping by a bar or a club if you’re over 21. Clubs such as Zen, Whim, and Firehouse are great, and because Valentine’s Day is on a Sunday, taking your date out on the Saturday night before might also be a good option. These clubs have a wide range of music, from R&B to house to hip-hop, so chances are they will meet the needs of almost every partygoer.
If you don’t want to go to a club and prefer something low-key ­— just both of you and a couple of drinks — try Alto Bar and Lounge in Shadyside. Also, bars such as S Bar in the South Side and the Wine Loft are great options. There are several bars down in the South Side or Station Square, so you are sure to find something that fits the bill. However, it is recommended to call the bar beforehand to inquire whether you need to make reservations or not.
Too young for bars but don’t want to end the date so soon? Go to the cinema! There are several movies releasing on Valentine’s Day weekend, including Valentine’s Day. What is better than a romantic movie with someone you really care for? Definitely purchase your tickets before since the theater might be crowded on Valentine’s Day. If you think it’s too cold outside and you would prefer to cuddle indoors, check what is playing on television that night, or head down to Blockbuster and rent a DVD. (Refer to our Valentine’s Day movie article on B7 for a good genre to pick.)
Pittsburgh is definitely a romantic city. Stuck in Hunt Library or in the cluster for most of the year, we forget to see how truly beautiful our city is. My personal top three romantic places to go in Pittsburgh are Mount Washington, the incline, and Schenley Park. Whether it’s admiring the Pittsburgh skyline from the heights of Mount Washington or traveling down the incline and witnessing a fantastic view of the city, you can’t not fall in love here. Schenley Park is a great place to take a walk through or have a Valentine’s Day picnic in.
The city has a lot of great places to bring your date on Valentine’s Day. Be sure to plan ahead so that you are not left with limited options, and try being creative and original. The secret to a perfect Valentine’s Day date is to be yourself. Don’t try too hard and enjoy the date. Valentine’s Day is magic in itself.

Get some help on what to buy your sweetie this Valentine’s Day with these fresh and unique ideas.
Personalized photo gifts: Girls adore pictures of the both of you. Let it be in a frame, as a collage, or even as a personalized gift (magnets, mouse pads, mugs and female-favorite teddy bears). Girls will totally go for one of these, and it’ll be a great way to show her that you treasure your memories together.
“100 things I love about you”: These are cute diaries in which you can write what you love about your special girl. First off, check Barnes and Noble to see if they have similar diaries available. She can treasure it for life and it will show her how much you love her.
Heart-shaped box with goodies: Buy a heart-shaped gift box and fill it up with things she likes. Depending on what her hobbies are and what she’s involved in, personalize a couple of small gifts. Fill the rest of the box with things like a framed photo of the both of you, a small jar filled with candy hearts and chocolates, (Hershey’s Kisses are a plus.) Put a small card on top with an “Exclusively for you” sort of message and you’re good to go.
An engraved piece of jewelry: I’m pretty sure that every guy on this planet knows that jewelry plus girls equals heaven! So guys, if you’re in a very committed relationship, go for it. On the other hand, if you just started dating then I would say to put a hold on this, but definitely look into this as your next Valentine’s Day gift. Engraved jewelry is a girl’s favorite, and she would absolutely love the fact that you think about her deeply enough to get all of this done.
A candlelight homemade dinner: Before your house- or flatmates get to it, book your place for Valentine’s Day dinner and arrange for a romantic, candlelit evening. As a side note, girls will be more impressed with how everything looks and how you present it rather than how the food actually tastes, so don’t worry too much. If you’re not too good of a cook, however, it’s always a good idea to either call a friend beforehand, or to have a back-up, like order-in food, and make sure that it looks great and presentable.
A photo puzzle: These lovely things are available all over the Internet. Just leave a cute message and a picture of the both of you in the puzzle. It’ll give the boys something fun to do and they’ll like solving it to see what the message and picture say.
Fun “s’mores”: This is a fun and witty way to profess your love to that special one. Get all the basic ingredients to make delicious s’mores: a stack of milk chocolate bars, marshmallows, a box of graham crackers, and marshmallow roasting sticks, along with a sweet and romantic card. Wrap all the ingredients up and attach the card outside with a note saying “Every day, I love you s’mores.”
Personalized boxer shorts: Need something fun yet naughty to give to your significant other? A personalized pair of boxer shorts is the perfect gift. Every guy would love these, and many would be very curious to find out what this hints at.
Message in a bottle: The ultimate way to profess one’s love. Get a pretty glass bottle and engrave both your names on it. Write a perfect letter that shows exactly how you feel and slip it in. Though some guys might not admit to it, all of them would adore the fact that you spilled out your heart to them.
Tokens of affection: A set of 10 romantic love tokens, which can be redeemed at any time. For example, “kiss for a token” would imply that your special one can exchange that token for a kiss. Personalize these tokens and have fun exchanging tokens for other things. Guys would love to play this game and would love the fact that they can ask for a hug, a kiss, or a massage whenever they feel like it.

Imagine three businessmen sitting calmly in their suits around a large boardroom table staring at numerous calendars spread out before them. Yes, here, at the top of their corporate offices in Kansas City, these men — the leaders of Hallmark Cards — are deciding on the next holiday. They are selecting another date to add to a litany of special occasions, another chance for you to pick up a Hallmark card — the gold standard of love — and present it to your mother, your father, your spouse, your sweetest. Except that is all this is — an imagination, a fantasy, a bit of conspiratorial anti-commercial dreaming.
Valentine’s Day is often viewed as a prime offender of commercialism; how could it not have been created by the fine-chocolate, flower-bouquet, and greeting-card industries? Unfortunately, especially for the most cynical (and single) university students, Valentine’s Day traditions date back much further than the modern American corporations.
Neither the traditions behind Valentine’s Day nor the life of Saint Valentine himself are particularly straightforward. Saint Valentine himself is a collection of at least six different martyred Valentines, of whom only one has a clear relation to Feb. 14, and none have any connection to sending a lover a number of roses. Aha! Then we can of course assume this saint with a confusing history was conscripted by a few inventive young businessmen to up their revenue in February — except, not quite.
By the time Shakespeare had Ophelia mentioning Valentine’s Day — “To-morrow is Saint Valentine’s day / All in the morning betime / And I a maid at your window / To be your Valentine” — writing valentines had been performed (and documented) for nearly 200 years. While the tradition was more likely a behavior of the bards, poets, and the wealthy back then, valentines were being produced in factories for contemporary consumers by the 1800s, and by 1847 valentines were being mass-produced in America. Hallmark would not be founded by J.C. Hall until 1910.
While Mother’s Day, Father’s Day, the ever-mocked “Sweetest Day,” and even Christmas have been included in the class of derided “Hallmark holidays,” each of these has its own tradition, none of which include any public origination from the corporate conference rooms in Kansas City. What this speaks to is Hallmark’s well-researched approach to “supporting” a holiday. On any Internet-based calendar, there are far more than enough obscure holidays to fill every day of the year twice over. What J.C. Hall, and his son, and his sons, have done well over their 100 years of operating Hallmark is selecting and popularizing holidays to the point where sending a card has become a social necessity.
The perceived Hallmarkization of holidays in an attempt to decry American industry as ruthlessly capitalistic inventors of fake celebrations falls flat with a knowledge of the underlying tradition. Instead, we are left with a tribute to the inventiveness of the corporation, taking the concept of a valentine and bringing it to the masses.
In reality, we do not all have the linguistic ability of Chaucer, the Duke of Orleans, John Donne, or Shelley; we cannot create compelling couplets of love on command. Much of the appeal of greeting cards — for Valentine’s Day or otherwise — comes from the ease of having someone else find the right words for us in the mass-marketed pink and red cards with lace and just the right balance of love, cheesiness, and corporate perfection.

Sometimes you just can’t find the right way to say what you feel. When looking for the magical words to say to someone special, remember this alteration of the classic Apple promotional phrase — “There’s a song for that.”
Many artists have written some undeniably romantic tunes in the past. With various genres and an endless selection to choose from, you can create an eclectic Valentine’s Day mix tape for your significant other that verbalizes the amorous message you want to send.
Oldies
With old movies and retro fashions becoming more and more popular each day, our generation is reminded of the value of vintage. Sometimes the best way to say something important involves going back several decades. Back in the day, lyrics were simple and effective. Women went weak in the knees when Elvis shook his pelvis, and his songs can still make the ladies cry with his honest and powerful words. However, not all members of our generation are entirely familiar with these classic songs, and your efforts might not be truly appreciated — be wary of who you share them with. Other good picks include the classic Righteous Brothers songs and, of course, the Beatles.
Soundtracks
If you’re looking to recapture the climactic romance mood from movies — the moment where both partners cling to each other in the throes of passion — maybe you can play your sweetheart some tunes tailor-made for romantic films. Love it or hate it, Céline Dion gave us the classic love song of the century in Titanic, Whitney made us believe that our romance was like a powerful high note, and Bryan Adams and Steven Tyler sang about the greatest emotion ever felt: true love.
Country
Maybe you’re a Southern gentleman trying to woo that girl wearing daisy dukes and cowboy boots. Some people give country music a bad rap because a lot of songs deal with men in cowboy hats drinking beer and crying about their women leaving them. Sure, that happens often, but modern, mainstream country tends to focus on how great the world is when two people are together. Sara Evans’s song celebrates love that’s not high-maintenance, while Taylor Swift croons about…well, I’m sure you’ve heard all of her songs before. Lady Antebellum writes about needing that someone special, while Billy Currington talks about hearing and saying those three magical words.
’90s hits
Want to bring back that feeling of innocent, young love that you felt when you were just a pre-teen? We all remember those days and how we just couldn’t get enough of those guilty pleasures on the radio. Prepare for some throwbacks, and let the memories of “back then” come forward. The two top boy bands, N*SYNC and the Backstreet Boys, both gave us hit after hit, while the lesser-known male quartet 98 Degrees offered up their share of cheesy tunes.
Acoustic
Maybe you want to strip away all the fancy technologies of modern music and bring it back to the basics — where it’s just a voice and a guitar. With fewer instruments to focus on, your special someone will hear your message loud and clear. Jack Johnson and John Mayer always know how to put a smile on their listeners’ faces.
Alternative
When you just can’t put your finger on a specific genre of music to send your message… go quirky! These unconventional love songs might just be a breath of fresh air for the two of you when radio pop and classics just won’t cut it. All four artists here can’t really be pigeonholed into a single genre; instead, they rely on a new sound they’ve created to match their unique take on feeling lovestruck.
Pop
With catchy choruses and hypnotizing music, they are fail-proof melodic summations and they’re on every radio station and every music chart. They’re upbeat, feel-good, and downright infectious. Kelly Clarkson’s hit makes saying how you feel extremely easy, and Lifehouse recounts that magical moment of the first time you get that special feeling, while Relient K simply recounts how great it is to have your other half.
This Valentine’s Day, put some thought into your mix tape — it might be just what your significant other wants to hear.

Throughout history, many have considered music and love to be interchangeable facets of human life. Both can be considered forms of art — they are full of passion, satisfaction, and the purest forms of emotion. However, one may not consider Lil Wayne synonymous with romance, a prevailing concern that has revealed the genre-based hierarchy of what listeners consider to be romantic music. For many, jazz has established itself as the true musical language of love.
When it emerged on the music scene at the beginning of the 20th century as a derivation of ragtime, jazz was immediately popular. The original jazz musicians were obsessed with syncopation and improvisation, taking influence from both blues and ragtime artists. Throughout the decades, the genre evolved into several subgroups incorporating Latin fusion sway, Afro-Cuban and Brazilian beats, and even hip-hop influences.
Today, jazz is all about devilishly delicious riffs and sultry sounds. While classic musicians like Duke Ellington, Louis Armstrong, Miles Davis, and Ella Fitzgerald are always appreciated for their talent and reputation, modern artists are constantly emerging on the jazz scene. Michael Bublé has revolutionized the jazz world with his fresh voice and upbeat instrumentals. Diana Kralls’ sensual voice has gained her hordes of adoring fans, and her remakes of classic jazz songs are impressive and refreshing.
This Valentine’s Day, while dining over candlelight with your significant other or dancing cheek to cheek in the living room, consider a jazz-based soundtrack. The emotions of Miles Davis’ trumpet or Nina Simone’s low notes will bring out the passion in your sweetheart. If you’re dreaming of the perfect Valentine’s Day night, why not cook up some dinner, whip out the red tablecloth, and switch on the jazz? Nothing goes better with rose petals and red wine than a classic jazz playlist.
However, if you’d prefer to go out for a night on the town, Pittsburgh is a relatively unknown but respectable jazz hub. Consider taking your date out for dinner and following up the romantic meal with a visit to one of Pittsburgh’s many jazz clubs. Little E’s jazz club, located at 949 Liberty Ave., is a popular retreat for jazz enthusiasts. With nationally touring artists and local performers constantly playing shows, there is always something interesting to listen to. Little E’s will even be hosting a special Valentine’s Day feature with jazz vocalist Anqwenique making her venue debut.
Of course, there are plenty of other jazz venues and restaurants to explore within Pittsburgh, many of which can be found at www.jazz-pittsburgh.com. Operations like the Pittsburgh Jazz Society have dedicated themselves to preserving the Pittsburgh jazz community and have thrown large jazz celebrations all over the city.
This holiday, in the spirit of romance, incorporate some jazz into your schedule and revive the language of love in your life.

Everyone knows that at Carnegie Mellon, although the odds are good, the goods are most certainly odd. Here are some quick and easy recipes to make sure that on Valentine’s Day, you can show your Valentine that your goods aren’t odd at all.
On a campus that boasts diversity, your sweethearts are sure to be from every reach of the earth. Take this chance to impress them and try something new. At globalcookies.blogspot.com, Lisa Rohner shares recipes from all over the world in her blog, Cookies For Every Country.
Sweeten the day by making these Persian cookies with a heart-shaped cookie cutter:
Nan-e Nokhodchi (from Iran)
Ingredients: 1 cup canola oil; 1 1/2 cups confectioners’ sugar; 4 teaspoons finely ground cardamom; 1 tablespoon rose water; 4 1/2 cups fine roasted chickpea flour sifted three times; 4 tablespoons unsalted, slivered pistachios for garnish
Directions: Combine oil, sugar, cardamom, and rose water in bowl and mix for two minutes until white and creamy. Add chickpea flour all at once and mix for one minute until dough is no longer sticky. Dust work surface with chickpea flour, knead dough for two minutes by hand, and flatten dough on surface until six inches square and 3/4 inch thick. Wrap in plastic wrap, place on plate, and let rest for one hour in refrigerator.
Preheat oven to 300 degrees Fahrenheit.
Unwrap dough. Use a cookie cutter and cut out dough. Place cookies on baking sheet lined with parchment. Decorate each with a slivered pistachio. Place sheet on 
rack in center of oven. Bake for 25 to 30 minutes.
Looking to break the tradition of abstinence at Carnegie Mellon? Gourmet Sleuth recommends aphrodisiac-based foods as the way to go.
The list includes asparagus, avocado, bananas, sweet basil, carrots, coffee, garlic, ginger, licorice, vanilla, nutmeg, and pineapple.
Some notable aphrodisiacs include:
Almond: A symbol of fertility throughout the ages, the aroma is thought to induce passion in a female.
Chocolate: Chocolate contains chemicals thought to affect neurotransmitters in the brain and a substance related to caffeine called theobromine. Chocolate contains more antioxidants (cancer-preventing enzymes) than red wine. The secret for passion is to combine the two. Try a glass of Cabernet with a bit of dark chocolate for a sensuous treat, or tempt yourself by trying the recipe for chocolate espresso cups. 
Raspberries and strawberries: They’re perfect foods for hand feeding your lover. High in vitamin C, these fruits make a sweet, light dessert.
For a romantic dinner for two, take these easy recipes and prepare a spread to amaze. Or spend time in a cozy kitchen cooking together. The Food Network provides an entire menu of caramelized pancetta and fennel salad, roasted asparagus, and shrimp scampi with linguini for an amorous evening at www.foodnetwork.com/recipes-and-cooking/make-it-together/pictures/index.html. The website also gives directions on how to whip up classic chocolate-covered strawberries.
Chocolate-covered strawberries
Ingredients: 6 ounces semisweet chocolate; chopped 3 ounces white chocolate; chopped 1 pound strawberries with stems (about 20), washed and dried very well
Directions: Put the semisweet and white chocolates into two separate heatproof medium bowls. Fill two medium saucepans with a couple inches of water and bring to a simmer over medium heat. Turn off the heat; set the bowls of chocolate over the water to melt. Stir until smooth. (Alternatively, melt the chocolates in a microwave at half power for one minute, stir, and then heat for another minute or until melted.) Once the chocolates are melted and smooth, remove from the heat. Line a sheet pan with parchment or waxed paper. Holding the strawberry by the stem, dip the fruit into the dark chocolate, lift and twist slightly, letting any excess chocolate fall back into the bowl. Set strawberries on the parchment paper. Repeat with the rest of the strawberries. Dip a fork in the white chocolate and drizzle the white chocolate over the dipped strawberries.
For those overworked, caffeine-addicted Carnegie Mellon students:
Chocolate espresso cups
Ingredients: 5 cups whole milk, 1/2 cup espresso, 8 ounces dark chocolate chopped 
into small pieces, 1 tablespoon sugar, 
1 tablespoon vanilla extract
Directions: Heat the milk in a medium pot over high heat until hot, but not boiling. Reduce the heat to very low and add the espresso, chocolate, sugar, and vanilla. Using a whisk, stir the mixture until the chocolate has melted. Continue to whisk the chocolate mixture until frothy every few minutes for about eight minutes, until the chocolate has completely mixed into the milk. Pour into mugs and serve immediately.

Curious about how The Tartan staff celebrates Valentine’s Day? Take a look inside the minds of some of the people who work at the paper with this romantic survey.
1. Do you like Valentine’s Day? Why or why not?
Why do you have to show all your love on one day? Why not every day? Unless someone gives me free candy, or perhaps diamonds, I don’t see the point. —CC 
Who couldn’t like a holiday that specifically excludes people based on their likability/attractiveness to others? Oh right, me. —JK 
I feel no shame admitting that I adore Valentine’s Day more than any other holiday. It’s unhealthy. —MD
2. Who are you spending your Valentine’s Day with?
Your mom. And I will not be calling her the next day. —JK 
The Tartan staff. Yay all-day Sunday production! —IJ
3. Describe your best Valentine’s Day memory:
A good friend of mine bought a tub of cotton candy at the local supermarket and asked all of his girl friends to be his valentine by getting on one knee and offering a chunk of his cotton candy to them. —MP 
For the past six years I have been single on Valentine’s Day. Such a thing does not apply. —IJ
4. Describe your worst Valentine’s Day memory:
Junior year in high school I broke up with my boyfriend the day after Valentine’s Day because he ditched me for a skateboarding competition. Triumphant day for me, bad day for him. —MD 
That lonely one. —JK
5. What is your idea of the perfect date?
Sitting on a really comfortable couch eating Chinese food while watching TV on a 52-inch screen and playing fun cutesy video games, such as Resident Evil 4 or Call of Duty, for hours at a time. And then talking about important things in life, such as books, or food, or crazy rabbits. I have high standards. —CC 
She agrees to another. —JK
6. If you could have anyone as your valentine, who would it be and why?
Abraham Lincoln: He was famous and supposedly gay. —IJ 
McDreamy! Meredith Grey doesn’t deserve him. The name says it all. —MP 
Mr. Big from Sex and the City. Or my boyfriend. Either one’s acceptable. —MD
7. What is your favorite love song?
“Bitches Ain’t Sh*t” by Ben Folds —JK 
“Part of the List” by Ne-Yo. It’s like, whoa! —MP
8. Where do you think the best place on campus to meet potential partners is?
The library, or — where you will most likely find me — at some place that serves food. I guess a dorm would be good too, unless you had a stalker (or two or three, as I’ve heard about) that also lived there. —CC 
Wean. It has all the makings for romance. Creepy hallways. Endless stairwells. Flooring that looks like a bowling alley. What more can you ask for?! —MP
9. If your romance were a movie, which movie would it be?
This question is implying that I’ve had a romance before. I would say The Lion King ... and I’m Rafiki. —CC 
10 Things I Hate About You, without the happy ending. —IJ
10. What would be your perfect Valentine’s Day gift?
One unicorn. And some sugar cubes for him or her. —JK
My very own private island. Next to Johnny Depp’s, preferably. —MP

Motion City Soundtrack is a band on the rise. Whether you’re attending a concert or checking out the band’s newest album, your musical palate is sure to be widened.
In concert
“Do you guys like music?” asked Justin Pierre, lead singer of Motion City Soundtrack, halfway through their set. In response to the roar of the crowd he quipped, “That’s good, ‘cause we’re a musical band.”
One might almost have mistaken the fivesome on stage for a stand-up group as the crowd broke out into laughter, just one of many occasions throughout the performance. However, as the band strummed the opening chords to their next song, no one could mistake Motion City Soundtrack for anything other than an extremely talented group of musicians.
On Jan. 31, Motion City Soundtrack hit the stage at Mr. Small’s Theater & Funhouse, a cozy, personal venue that put the audience close to the stage. The floor was packed, as the concert was sold out. A few people even loitered around outside, asking if anyone had extra tickets to sell.
The lights dimmed, and the crowd cheered as the first band, The Swellers, came on stage. The punk rock foursome from Flint, Michigan played an exciting set, and undoubtedly gained a few more fans that night. Following The Swellers was This Providence, an alternative rock quartet from Seattle, Washington signed to Fueled by Ramen. The band filled the gap in between songs with funny jokes and self-deprecating humor. The third band on the tour was Set Your Goals, a hardcore punk group that escalated the energy level in the theater to the point where even non-fans were jumping to the music.
As Set Your Goals cleared the stage, the anticipation for Motion City Soundtrack built up. During the set change, the audience bonded over singing well-known songs, one such song being “Don’t Stop Believing” by Journey. When Motion City Soundtrack finally stepped on the stage, they opened with “Worker Bee,” a popular song off their new album, My Dinosaur Life.
Motion City Soundtrack did a wonderful job of entertaining the audience with their energetic songs and equally energetic jokes. For “Her Words Destroyed My Planet,” the band even involved fans in the song, tossing kazoos out into the audience so they could toot along to part of the song. After playing “L.G. Fuad” the band left the stage and the crowd soon began shouting “one more song.” The band did better than that. After coming back on stage they ended the night with two encores: “Disappear” from their new album, and “Everything is Alright.”
Indeed most people were feeling more than just “alright” after the concert.
“It was exciting! I couldn’t hear anything,” said Tyler Nighswander, a first-year computer science major, for whom the ringing in his ears had muted all other sounds. Then again, as frequent concertgoers will know, the inability to hear anything for hours after is just a pleasant reminder of how amazing a concert was. And it was true — this really was an amazing concert.
On record
Flashback. It’s 2003; Motion City Soundtrack has just released their first album, I Am the Movie, and it’s so chock-full of angst and nostalgia that scenesters across America rejoice. Now flash-forward. Seven years later, the band releases My Dinosaur Life, and their following has increased 50-fold with a fan-base that extends beyond the boys’ starting place in Minnesota. But don’t get your high-tops in a bundle, band-hoodie-wearing hooligans, because Motion City Soundtrack’s edge has certainly not been dulled.
Arguably the most important criterion for the validation of musicians is to have cohesive albums, and Motion City Soundtrack has managed to do just that through four studio releases. The band has blended their original punk/rock sound with indie lullabies, electronica dance beats, rock guitar solos, and pop love themes, but throughout it all, they managed to maintain their unique style. They kept their original fan base and simultaneously expanded it to the more media accessible reaches of the young adult world.
The band’s third and most popular album, titled Even If It Kills Me, launched the band into the popular media spotlight, and Motion City Soundtrack rode the momentum to the release of My Dinosaur Life, which debuted at number 15 on Billboard 200. Despite the band’s switch from Epitaph Records to Columbia, the album, which mirrors their sophomore album, Commit This to Memory, brings back the punk but keeps the pop.
What is the common thread that ties the band’s four albums together? Lead singer Pierre’s distinctive voice. Plus, it’s recognizable as a Motion City Soundtrack album because listeners know they love Pierre’s complex lyrics stuffed with pop culture references, intricate metaphors, and clever diction that requires Googling to be sure the words are even English. Pierre sings, “I still futz with that tourniquet, and tried to squeeze on your dreams/Slung it on — it’s a perfect fit. What do you suppose that means?” Beats me, Pierre.
Motion City Soundtrack’s most popular songs pre-Dinosaur include “The Future Freaks Me Out” off the first album and “Everything Is Alright” off the sophomore album, as well as “Fell in Love Without You” and “This is for Real” from Even If It Kills Me. The band’s first single, “Disappear,” was not the strongest on the new album. Songs to look out for include “Worker Bee,” “A Lifeless Ordinary,” and “Her Words Destroyed My Planet.” The three tracks hold familiar nostalgia and hysteria from the band’s previous albums, and Motion City Soundtrack knows that crazy is what they do best. Just look at Pierre’s vertical hair and horizontal sideburns! Geometry at its finest.

“Lights up on Washington Heights…”
The lights went up on the set of the award-winning musical In the Heights! last Tuesday at the Benedum Center. With music and score written by Lin-Manuel Miranda, and book by Quiara Alegría Hudes, the show was the proud winner of four Tonys in 2008: Best Orchestrations, Best Choreography, Best Score, and Best Musical. In addition to this praise, a Pittsburgh native is cast in the show: Usnavi, the narrator of the story of dreams and love in Manhattan, is played by Kyle Beltran, a 2009 Carnegie Mellon graduate.   
Bodega owner Usnavi greets the audience as he opens his shop, introducing himself and his neighborhood, Manhattan’s Washington Heights. As the day breaks, the characters come out one by one to begin their work days. Usnavi’s younger cousin Sonny, played by Shaun Taylor-Corbett, joins him in the shop, wisecracking and goofing off as his cousin frantically tries to find a solution for a broken refrigerator. Abuela Claudia, played by Elise Santora, their adopted grandmother, comes to the rescue by substituting condensed milk for the spoiled groceries.  Usnavi is relieved, because customers have begun coming in and “I’m not makin’ any profit if the coffee isn’t light and sweet!” This statement is true for all of the characters, whose lives depend on scraping out a living in the heights, whether by selling piragua—a Puerto Rican frozen treat—working in a hair salon, or running a car service to pay for a daughter’s expensive education.  
The musical portrays the dreams and fears of each of the characters vividly, displaying the characters’ will to live and succeed against the grit and hopelessness of the daily grind. Usnavi dreams of returning to his homeland, the Dominican Republic. Nina (Arielle Jacobs) dreams of making her parents and her neighborhood proud.  Benny (Rogelio Douglas Jr.) dreams of being his own boss, a self-made business tycoon, and Vanessa (Sabrina Saloan) dreams of being free from her life in the heights and living downtown in her own studio.  
Suddenly, all of these dreams have a chance of coming true when Usnavi and Sonny realize that somebody in their neighborhood bought the winning ticket of a lottery for $96,000. This leads to the unforgettable song aptly named “96,000,” in which all of the characters wonder how they could change their lives with this sum of money.  
Other especially memorable songs include “Inutil,” which sums up the feelings eating at the heart of many of the characters who feel useless, unable to help themselves or others.  “Paciencia y Fe” explains the credo of Abuela Claudia, the grandmother of the neighborhood who has been patient and faithful all of her life and truly living through those that she loves. “Alabanza” is an especially emotional song, touching the heart of everyone who has ever lost a loved one. Although the musical tells the story of a very specific time and place, the themes in it are universal.
The repartee between characters was quick and witty while still extremely modern, making the show both entertaining and extremely real. Spanish 
speakers got a few more jokes and slips than the rest of the audience did, but the use of Spanish added to the authenticity of the story while keeping it coherent to those who only spoke English. 
The choreography and performance were fast and extremely energetic — except for a few moments when the cast moved together in slow motion for a few seconds before jumping back into the racing pace of the choreography. 
The struggles of the characters to survive and achieve their dreams were strongly portrayed by the actors.  Rather than sympathizing with one lone hero, the audience felt for each of the characters and their inner struggles with their situations and dreams for a better life. In the Heights! contained so many emotions in it that the audience left feeling incredibly full, carrying away all of the feelings, both high and low, with a strong Latino beat pounding in their heads.

Valentine’s Day is coming soon and with it comes the anticipation of a date or a party. Whether it’s a date with a significant other or one landed out of the blue, a great wardrobe can help make it a perfect night. Here’s some advice on how to dress right for Valentine’s Day.
Making this date more special may be simpler than you might think. Read on for tips on color choices and accessory advice.
The bright red: Since it is Valentine’s Day, red can be a good color choice. But rather than covering yourself with the color, a hint of red can be more effective. Try a red miniskirt or a sweater. You can use red in your accessories, too. A chunky, red knit scarf and a black coat complement each other well. If bright red is too overwhelming for you, try shades of wine or scarlet. They are toned-down hues, but still very appropriate for a Valentine’s Day date.
High heels: You may remember Carrie Bradshaw from Sex and The City and her unending obsession with high heels. In one episode when she is mugged by a man, she shouts, “Not my shoes!” while she is willing to give up everything else. Some people may not agree, but from my experience heels do make everything better. Although flats are comfortable and easy to wear, heels can make your legs seem longer, and you can use them to accentuate your outfit. Bright-colored shoes, such as red or turquoise, can brighten your outfit. 
Accessories: Jewelry is a must for a special day like Valentine’s Day. it is important to keep in mind not to overdo it. If you are looking for bold jewelry, try cocktail rings. They are an instant boost of bling that works with almost any outfit. A long necklace with a nice, white shirt can also be quite lovely for your date. You may be surprised to know that J.Crew offers an extensive and beautiful jewelry collection. They have fancy necklaces as well as bracelets and also offer a 15 percent discount with your student ID.
You may think that fashion is mostly about women, but do not underestimate how men are becoming more aware of fashion. Although men’s clothing is often a lot simpler than women’s, when you dress for a date it’s all about detail. Your choice of shirt, tie color, shoes, or socks can work for or against you.
The casual chic: Go for a smart-casual look that is not too understated, but not too bold and daring. You may be surprised to find out how well dress pants go with white sneakers or jeans with a fitted blazer. Mix and match the casual and dressy items.
The perfect shirt: Rather than looking for something fancy, a crisp white shirt with a cardigan makes a great look. The key to dressing well is to keep it simple, especially for men. Stick to basic fabric shirts and add interesting touches with a suede jacket or detailed shoes. Since it is Valentine’s Day, you can try a pink or red button-down, but make sure to keep other parts of your outfit more neutral with colors like beige, gray, or black.
Accessories: You may wonder what men can do with accessories. A tie can be a great accessory to accent your wardrobe. A crisp white shirt and a good silk tie go well together. If you are more playful, try a bow tie. Socks can also be a great accessory to play with. Try red socks, if you dare — the look is better than it sounds, and kudos to you for pulling it off.
As soon as you know your date location, make sure your look is fitting or fittingly contrasting. The worst thing you can do is ruin a first impression by dressing inappropriately for the venue.

In my youth, and by that I mean two years ago, I embarked on a mad scheme to free myself from the pressures of classwork and the annual job hunt for one blissful summer. In order to do this, I decided to study abroad, to leave the comforts of home and spend as much time as possible in the furthest place from home. In this delightful frenzy, I lighted upon Tokyo, Japan as my target. Though it factored somewhere in the back of my mind that I did not know Japanese, that slight drawback was completely overshadowed by the fact that I would be eight full time zones away from my home and my place of study.
Unfortunately, reality came crashing down on me when, after disembarking from the plane and exiting the airport to the nearest subway station, I found that I had no idea how I was going to get from where I was to where I was supposed to sleep that night. It became obvious very quickly that not being familiar with the various ways to transliterate the Japanese kanji into the English alphabet was going to be a problem.
Tokyo’s subway system can be generously described as labyrinthine. It is run by two major companies, and a multitude of other companies run smaller above-ground lines near the edges of the larger system. To make things more complex, the largest line, one encircling the downtown area, is run by a third large company. This made navigating the subway system overwhelming and intimidating, especially since the only other system I had experience with was the one in Washington, D.C., a small system by anyone’s standards. However, thanks to a helpful bystander, I was able to get directions to the district in which my hostel was located.
Begging bystanders for directions quickly became a theme on my trip. In general, residents were very helpful. In particular, young people were more than happy to point me in the direction of whatever building or store I was searching out. In fact, some of them walked me to the locale in question and peppered me with questions about where I was from and why I was in Tokyo. I was told later that this was an attempt to practice their English language skills, which explained why I had some trouble understanding their questions.
As for studying, my classmates and I were exposed to an accelerated program in two courses of our choosing. This allowed me to cram an entire semester of sociology and history into about a month of study. Though we were required to attend classes on Saturday, we had the entire afternoon off every day. This allowed me and my classmates to explore a large number of the more popular districts of the city during our studies.
The actual city of Tokyo is broken into 23 special wards, which are further subdivided into chome. Each of these chome has a different feel, though some of them tend to run together as an area gains popularity for a certain type of entertainment. For example, Akihabara, the “Electric Light District,” is famous for being home to every piece of electronics you could ever want, from tabletop-size dishwashers to personal robots and everything in between. There is even a store devoted entirely to robotics and personal robots. In the side alleys, you can buy any electrical part you could ever desire from vendors hawking their wares from street carts. However, it’s not all about electronics. One store named “Don Quijote” (complete with an animated knight attacking a windmill), is an eight-floor shrine to everything you could possibly want. I had not previously suspected that my 6’5” classmate could find a Hello Kitty costume in his size, but he reveled in his discovery.
There is more to Tokyo, however, than technology and six-foot-tall Hello Kitty costumes. Those of you with a penchant for pop culture may remember that Gwen Stefani was once popular for a song entitled “Harajuku Girls.” The Harajuku mentioned in the song is, in fact, one of the chome of the Shibuya ward of Tokyo. The Shibuya ward is famous for its high fashion, and many of our afternoons were spent browsing through clothing stores to find outfits that not only fit us, but were sufficiently absurd that our friends back home would no longer speak to us. Unfortunately, none of our choices could top the elaborate costumes worn on Sundays by aspiring performers lined up and down the main street in Harajuku, belting out their best tunes in an attempt to land a record deal and become the next pop idol. If that wasn’t strange enough, all of this is located directly next to Meiji-Jingu, the largest shrine in Tokyo, and one that nearly everyone, native and tourist alike, comes to visit.
Though Tokyo is an ever-changing landscape, with stores and shops constantly changing their stock or even going in and out of business, the one constant is that there is always more to see. A study abroad trip would be incomplete without some glimpse into high culture, and it was certainly provided. Regardless of one’s intent, Tokyo continues to surprise and delight its visitors. I can safely say that I will be back to Tokyo, hopefully for an extended time.

Every year around this time, a new romantic comedy seems to hit the theaters. It usually has an attractive cast and is built around an adorable little story that interconnects most of the main characters. Several of these flicks have shown up these past few years, indicating they have truly run out of creativity in Hollywood. But I am here to tell you that they are not your only options if you are out of ideas for your sweetheart and decide to phone it in one night by watching a movie together. You actually have a plethora of movie genres to choose from with which you may “set the mood.” But be careful, because each genre comes with its own pros and cons that you must be wary of whenever attending a movie.
Action
The action genre is actually a tricky line to walk at times. If your significant other enjoys good shoot-’em-up features that really get the juices flowing, you may be going home with someone revved up and ready for action. But, and this is the unfortunate case for many out there, sometimes a person gets so involved in the no-holds-barred, non-stop action that they neglect the very person they came with. To be honest, watching Bruce Willis rip a man’s throat out while yelling “Yippee kay ay mother….” doesn’t exactly act as a prime opportunity for hand-holding or anything really romantic.
Horror
Every great horror movie has its fair share of tense moments that lend you good opportunities to hold your date close to “save” him or her from the monster or axe murderer. What better time to say “I’ll protect you from anything” than when you’re holding your significant other close while some dude’s being chopped into little pieces by Michael Myers? Still, despite its color, blood isn’t exactly the most romantic thing to see on Valentine’s Day, at least according to the girl I gave a vial of mine to back in high school.
Drama
With dramas, there’s nothing better than offering up a shoulder to cry on when the star-crossed lovers finally break through all barriers and passionately kiss while the credits roll. It’s also a chance to show your partner that you do, in fact, have those things called emotions and the ability to sense the sufferings of others. But be careful: The wrong kind of flick may cause her to realize you are actually the one keeping her from the true man of her dreams. Avoid any films that bear even the slightest resemblance to any part of either of your past or present lives.
There are, of course, many other genres that could work well or be disastrous for you this holiday. Musicals, for example, could make someone feel like they are living a fairy-tale life, while at the same time make your date realize that you have no discernible musical or artistic talent whatsoever. Regardless of what you choose to do for your sweetie this Valentine’s Day, remember that the most important thing is that you’re with someone you truly enjoy being around.

Dear Hoskins Brothers,
I find that I often offend others. Are there any tricks to noticing when I am starting to cross the line? Social cues? Facial markers?
Thanks,

Dear AWKWARD,
You must be a computer science major. As a fellow computer scientist, I empathize — it can be hard to tell what people are thinking. Lucky for you, I’ve done my research. First, look around. Is someone you were just talking to crying? If so, it may be your fault. You might want to apologize and avoid saying whatever it was you just said ever again. Second, stop for a moment and check your body. Have you been punched in the face? If so, then you probably offended someone. You should avoid them — they’ll probably want to hit you again.
In all seriousness, if you do have problem understanding other people’s facial expressions and empathizing, you may have a mild form of autism, such as Asperger’s. If you feel this is a big issue affecting your life, you may want to see a doctor or psychiatrist.
Or it could just be that you’re just mean. You might want to try being nicer to people.
Look ’em in the eyes,
—Patrick Hoskins
Dear Hoskins Brothers,
I’m a first-year who made a group of friends at the beginning of Orientation, and I’m worried that we’re not meant to be. I keep finding out things about them that I don’t like, but I don’t want to lose them and have no social life. What do you suggest I do?
—Frequently rethinking Orientation social habits
Dear FROSH,
I understand how hard it can be to make new friends. However, you have to stop and ask yourself — are these the kind of people you want to be associated with for the next four years? If the answer is no, then you need to start making some new friends. It can be intimidating, but people are a lot nicer than you think. If you see a cool-looking person, just walk up to them, strike up a conversation, and ask if they want to hang out. Try joining some clubs or organizations around campus; they’re a great way to make friends. I know it can be intimidating and awkward to try making friends with a stranger, but remember: No matter how awkward it is, this is Carnegie Mellon, and there are always 10 people more awkward than you. And they’re usually pretty nice.
If all else fails, just take up WoW and join a guild. Virtual friends are real friends too!
Don’t be afraid,
—Brian Hoskins

Last Wednesday, rock journalist Chuck Klosterman lectured on the media’s influence on how we, as individuals, perceive reality. The topic itself was broad, so even Klosterman had trouble getting to his point. Still, Klosterman has proven himself to be a powerful commentator on popular culture, and his point was probably all the more poignant in its ambiguity. 
No one knows how media (especially new media) is affecting our reality. Film and television are assailing us with information at 24 frames per second. Computer multimedia and video games are even faster. Our brains struggle to store, much less interpret, this massive amount of information.
When Klosterman was in high school, he had six cassette tapes of music that amounted to roughly 70 songs. Looking at my iTunes library, I have 5000 songs just on this computer. Klosterman struggled to interpret half of his music library. I’ll be lucky if I fully interpret 1 percent of mine. Right now, I’m telling myself I can generalize — I don’t need to know every detail of every song. But I’m struck by the fact that I hardly know anything about my music other than that I like the sound.
I wanted Klosterman to make me feel better, to tell me good music was still good music. I took down a poster for his lecture and got in line to have it signed. I’m going to ask him if he likes a band called The National. If he does, somehow I won’t be bothered. The media can keep using me as it pleases. 
He signs my paper, and I don’t ask anything. The man just spent the last hour telling me the media has the wrong idea. People like Britney Spears are different in person compared to on television. Even Klosterman is putting on a show. Why would I ever want to ask him if he likes The National?
Chuck Klosterman, I have been thoroughly impressed.

A blizzard dumping up to two feet of snow shut down much of Pittsburgh and Carnegie Mellon this weekend and into the week — with classes canceled both Monday and Tuesday.
The storm caused many campus facilities to close, including most campus dining locations. The Carnegie Mellon Café, The Underground, Taste of India, and Sí Señor were open with limited menus and shorter hours. Campus restaurant closures caused difficulties for many students living on campus. “I’m half starving,” said Leslye Graham, a first-year in H&SS. “We’ve been eating pita bread and hummus all day. Everything was closed so we went to Entropy.”
Campus dining locations that did stay open found themselves short-staffed and facing a much bigger crowd than usual. 
Entropy and restaurants in Resnik House saw a much greater number of students than usual.
Students who do not reside on campus were also impacted by the storm. Treacherous road conditions made travel very difficult. Dangerous roads caused the Pittsburgh Port Authority to limit its bus service to one route beginning on Friday night and lasting through Saturday. Limited bus service was restored on Sunday morning, with nearly full service expected to be restored on Monday morning.
Some students avoided traveling back and forth from their homes, choosing instead to come to campus in the morning and stay for the entire day. 
Restaurant closures in Oakland and Squirrel Hill forced some students to travel to campus to get their meals. “Because of the snow, I ate at Schatz for the first time since my first year,” said fifth-year architecture major Jerome Williams.
Carnegie Mellon employees also found themselves impacted by storm conditions. Many were unable to report to work due to suspended bus services and icy roads. Those who were able to report to work were relocated from their normal work stations to cover for those who were not able to come in. 
Weather conditions also affected some employees’ ability to return to their homes. Six Housing and Dining Services employees were forced to stay overnight in Resnik House. “I slept on a couch with a tablecloth for a blanket,” said Maria Gonzalez, one of the six stranded employees. “It was terrible.”
While Pittsburgh is slow to respond to the effects of the storm, Carnegie Mellon Facilities Management Services have been working diligently to clear walkways and driveways of snow and ice. 
However, despite the hard work of campus employees, Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday classes were canceled due to severe weather conditions.

Carnegie Mellon’s Fair Trade Week is a small part of an ongoing movement to encourage the purchase and use of fair trade products on campus and throughout Pittsburgh. The concept of fair trade centers on the promotion of sustainability for producers in under-developed and developing countries. Fair trade ensures that producers are paid adequate wages, while also encouraging the maintenance of environmental, social, and human rights-related standards.
“The fair trade initiative started last year with a group of students who were concerned with the variety of products available in on-campus dining,” said Amy Badiani, a junior social and decision sciences major and president of Carnegie Mellon’s Amnesty International chapter. “We started off learning about La Prima and their stance on fair trade. We were able to visit their factory and see how they made fair trade work locally. From there, we began to consider the possibility of fair trade products being available on campus.”
This exploration into fair trade products was successfully continued into this school year. “With the change in dining services, Amnesty and SIFE: Nicaragua came together to promote fair trade goods. It’s a really strong partnership because Amnesty International is a humanitarian organization, while SIFE: Nicaragua has the real-world experience of seeing how fair trade works internationally,” Badiani said.
“SIFE: Nicaragua has always tried to perpetuate sustainability among a more globally conscious campus community,” said SIFE: Nicaragua leader and junior social and decision sciences major Angel Gonzalez. “We knew that last year Amnesty [International] had done a lot of great work trying to promote fair trade on campus, so this year we approached them and said we wanted to work with them.”
Representatives from both Amnesty International and SIFE: Nicaragua have discussed issues of fair trade with Carnegie Mellon Housing and Dining Services, as well as various CulinArt vendors. SIFE: Nicaragua and Amnesty International expect fair trade products to be available at campus dining locations by the end of the semester.
Fair Trade Week will include a variety of events — beginning Tuesday at 5 p.m. in Danforth Lounge with “Speak your Mind,” an open discussion where students, staff, and faculty will share their beliefs and understanding of the benefits of fair trade production and fairly traded products. Sponsored by Student Affairs, “Speak Your Mind” will feature two guest speakers: professor and director of the global studies department John Soluri and La Prima Espresso owner Sam Patti. “I’m most excited about the ‘Speak Your Mind’ event,” Gonzalez said. “Basically we’re going to have a discussion about fair trade and about the feasibility of bringing it on campus. There will be a group of really passionate people there — we’re interested in having a discourse.”
Other events will include a tour of the La Prima factory in the Strip District this Saturday at 1 p.m.
Students will also have the opportunity to attend a Fair Trade Fair on Monday, Feb. 15, from 11:30–2:30 p.m. in Rangos 3. Many Pittsburgh fair trade companies will be represented, including 10,000 Villages, Building New Hope, La Prima Espresso, and Women of the Cloud Forest.
On Thursday, Feb. 18 at 7 p.m. in Porter Hall 100 there will be a free coffee tasting. The tasting will be accompanied by the screening of Black Gold, a documentary focusing on the international production and trade of coffee. 
Gonzalez explains that Amnesty International and SIFE: Nicaragua hope that fair trade week event will be “a chance to talk about different aspects of fair trade.”
“If you talk about [Fair Trade], then it becomes an issue. And when it becomes an issue, people want to see a change.”
“Fair trade’s importance goes back to the university’s mission statement, which talks about teaching ethical behavior and respect for others. As students of the university, we should contribute to that. One way to do that is making sure that the products we have on campus are ethical,” said Yon Zloof, a junior business administration major and member of SIFE: Nicaragua. “Fair trade benefits millions of families all around the world. It helps ensure that they get a fair share of what they are making and producing.”
Editor's note: Amy Badiani is a junior staffwriter for The Tartan.

Although still small in scale and just beginning, the Fundred Dollar Bill Project to raise money in New Orleans is attracting a lot of local attention for its unconventional approach to fundraising and its unique blend of charity and art.
The Fundred Dollar Bill Project began in 2006 when artist and sculptor Mel Chin asked the federal government for $300 million to treat lead pollution in New Orleans. “It was devastating to [Chin] when he realized how 30 percent of New Orleans’ youth have been exposed to lead poisoning,” explained Carnegie Mellon CFA alumna Jessica Moss, who heads the regional Fundred collection. However, when the government rejected his proposal and told Chin he would need to raise the $300 million on his own, the artist came up with a new twist on fundraising. “[Chin] knew that he could not raise that much money in any amount of time,” Moss said. “So he said, ‘Why not create that money?’ ” Chin started the Fundred Dollar Bill Project locally in New Orleans’ elementary schools, but the project soon expanded across the nation.
Fundreds are fake $100 bills with the face of Benjamin Franklin, the image of Independence Hall, and other notable features blanked out. The Fundred templates encourage participants to draw what is important to them on their mock bills, such as putting their home on the back where Independence Hall was originally. “The Fundred templates are used almost as equivalents of $100 bills,” Moss said.
“The funny thing about the project is that it’s such a gamble.... The end of the project is June 2010.... Hopefully at that moment, the government will decide whether they will do something with the Fundreds.” There has so far been no word from the United States government concerning its response to the project.
Also noteworthy are the security and transport of these drawings. 
“An armored truck will travel to each of the pickup sites around the country and pick up however many Fundreds they’ve collected,” Moss said. “The problem of lead poisoning is so vast and affecting so many people that the symbolic value of the Fundreds is significant, even if the monetary value isn’t yet.”
Those who attended the first drawing event last Thursday were lively and enthusiastic, and by the end of the night, the walls were covered in Fundreds.
“You don’t need to be a good drawer to make these, and I think you also don’t need to be too political to participate and share your views,” said Ryan Sieberg, a graduate student majoring in statistics, as he drew a picture of his house on the back of his Fundred.
“I don’t really think that this is just about making $300 million off the government. When people come together like this and all share their interpretations ... it creates something above a single cause,” said senior social and decision sciences major Sarah Stitzel.
“Art doesn’t need [to] have a set purpose to mean something.”

Some of Pittsburgh’s school-aged children will soon be learning about cybersecurity through the use of cadets and virtual adventures. Carnegie Mellon’s CyLab and Information Networking Institute (INI) has received a $20,000 grant from the Verizon Foundation that will fund an interactive cyber-awareness community outreach program based at Pittsburgh’s St. Bede school, a local parish school located on Edgerton Avenue.
“We are grateful for the opportunity to work with the community to raise the awareness of cybersecurity threats and their solutions, including how to deal with viruses and spam, how to protect your privacy online, and strategies in dealing with cyber-bullies amongst other topics,” said Dena Haritos Tsamitis, director of INI and director of training and outreach at CyLab.
Anna Maria Berta, the principal project manager for technical curricula who has managed the portal and been involved in the outreach team, spoke about her excitement for the grant.
“It is an excellent opportunity for CMU to participate in the community and for Pittsburgh to feel that CMU is involved. We have a lot to share, and it is good to have this feeling of mutual interest and participation,” Berta said.
Although this particular outreach program will focus on the St. Bede School, the programs created by the CyLab and INI research team are already in use at hundreds of schools around the world via Internet downloads.
Tsamitis expanded on the main components of the outreach program.
“My team’s efforts over the past five years have been very much focused on the content development of the MySecureCyberspace portal (www.mysecurecyberspace.com), which provides customized information and solutions to users about ongoing cybersecurity threats, and Carnegie Cadets: The MySecureCyberspace Game, which is a downloadable educational game freely available to the public,” she said.
The Carnegie Cyber Academy is a children’s website that accompanies the MyCyberSpace Game and is aimed at fourth to seventh graders, providing an interactive website for these children, as well as their parents and teachers, to learn about safe computing. 
The premise of the game is that students participate as cadets who complete a series of virtual challenges to advance their knowledge to become “Cyber Defenders of the Internet,” according to the website, www.carnegiecyberacademy.com.
Ann Ritchie, an instructional designer at CyLab and content developer for these outreach initiatives, brought up the benefit of funding for the constant improvement of the programs.
“New funding makes it possible to develop materials that will make an impact effectively across different media, as well as to keep our outreach materials relevant to the ongoing changes of Internet trends and threats,” Ritchie said.
Students are expected to learn about such topics as Internet security terms, the danger of Internet predators, how to surf safely online, the problem of cyber-bullying, and protecting against identity theft, according to a Carnegie Mellon press release.
Unlike the past initiatives being used at schools around the world, this new project with the St. Bede school will allow researchers to see the results materialize.
“Much of the delivery of our outreach material happens over the Internet and conferences, so I look forward to seeing the real names and faces of the people who will be involved in the series of workshops at St. Bede,” Ritchie said.
Tsamitis said that the use of these technologies will be complemented by a series of cybersecurity workshops in which all members of the St. Bede and surrounding community will be invited to attend. 
“The St Bede community has responded with much enthusiasm and willingness to collaborate. They are planning to invite to our outreach program all 250 families of their K-8 school plus everybody in the parish,” Berta said.

Eight Carnegie Mellon students recently submitted a proposal to save the historic Hulton bridge in Oakmont, Pa. In the proposal, the heavily trafficked road bridge would be reverted to pedestrian and bike-friendly usage. The bridge, built in 1908 and one of the last remaining truss bridges in Pennsylvania, had been scheduled for demolition and replacement.
The students presented their plan to Oakmont residents and the Pennsylvania Department of Transportation (PennDOT) at the Oakmont Country Club at the end of last semester. Project member Gabriella Briffa, a junior in civil and environmental engineering, felt that the residents were receptive to the team’s presentation, especially because of the historical importance of the bridge. The bridge was named for Jonathan Hulton, one of the major landowners in Oakmont in the 19th century. In 1989, the Pennsylvania Legislature renamed the bridge to posthumously honor local representative Joseph Bonetto. In 1972, Bonetto had proposed a plan to build a bridge further upstream of the Allegheny, anticipating increased traffic loads for the Hulton due to the construction of the Allegheny Valley Expressway. Citizens of Oakmont were not aware of the renaming until plaques were mounted on the bridge. Local residents, unhappy with the change, stole the plaques.
Today, Carnegie Mellon students are taking a stand to save the historic Hulton bridge.
“We decided we really wanted to make an impact,” said Briffa, speaking about their goals for the project. “The idea was that we have something happen inside the community.”
In addition to Briffa, students responsible for the plan are Cassandra Abernathy, Dyanna Becker, Janice Chen, Andrew Ko, Zachary McCabe, Jon Nardolilli, and Christine Peters. They are juniors in the civil and environmental engineering department. The proposal was part of a semester project for the required junior projects course that gives the students an opportunity to design and complete full-semester projects.
Civil and environmental engineering professor Susan Finger connected the students with Carnegie Mellon alumnus Todd Wilson, who graduated from the civil and environmental engineering department in 2006. He explained that he has been working with students from this course for the past three years. Wilson currently works for the engineering and architectural design firm AECOM.
“If the bridge is to be transformed into a trail,” Wilson stated in an e-mail, “it will be a direct result of the students’ work.”
The group’s 85-page proposal detailed the historical, economic, and environmental impacts of revamping the bridge. The trail might also connect to the proposed Allegheny River Nine-Mile Run trail. The trail is a major component of Allegheny County’s master plan for regional advancement, called Allegheny Places. 
The students estimated the pedestrian and bike bridge would bring an increase of $486,000 a year for Oakmont businesses. The bridge is also home to a variety of mussel species, one of which is being considered for addition to the endangered species list. 
PennDOT Assistant District Executive for Design Cheryl Moon-Sirianni told the Pittsburgh Post Gazette that she was “extremely impressed.”
“The students did good research ... but there are some obstacles,” said Moon-Sirianni to The Tartan.
She indicated that the bridge needs other updates, in addition to the students’ estimate of $300,000 in changes. That estimate was well under PennDOT’s estimate of $5 to $10 million. 
The new bridge would also need to be redesigned so that its piers aligned with the piers of the existing bridge. Without this alignment, tugboats would be unable to pass under the bridges. Additionally, someone has to agree to purchase the bridge and take responsibility for upkeep. Moon-Sirianni explained that this is the largest hurdle in saving the bridge.
“What they presented is always a possibility,” she said, despite the challenges she outlined.
Currently, the narrow, two-lane bridge does not have capacity for rush-hour traffic. PennDOT has scheduled the construction of a new bridge to begin in the spring of 2012. The design includes the option for bike and pedestrian accommodations.

English language and literature courses are an integral part of every high school curriculum. However, rarely does one stop to think about the process of designing and implementing such courses. Recently, Carnegie Mellon assistant professor of English and literary and cultural studies Richard Purcell has begun to intensely study this process.
Purcell focuses upon many different aspects of literature, history, and popular culture — especially late 19th and 20th century African-American literature and literary criticism. Recently, he has been helping develop an African-American literature course that will begin in the fall in all Pittsburgh public schools. This course will be offered to high school seniors interested in the subject. Students will have the opportunity to take this course as an advanced placement English course. Although all of the classes will include African-American authors, this new course will bring their work to the forefront of classroom study. Purcell views the move as a recognition that "the world is and has been diverse." 
First-year creative writing major Zach Betka understands the importance of recognizing diverse literature, especially African-American literature. He describes reading books such as The Color Purple a "humbling experience" and agrees that they broadened his perspective. This new course aims to do just that, including books such as Octavia Butler's Kindred. The course will also include William Attaway's Blood on the Forge, a novel set in Pittsburgh and chosen for its emphasis on the city's role in literature. 
According to Purcell, "the purpose of the class — like any upper-level literature course — is to deepen a student's sense of literature and to show that literature and the imaginative mind is driven by ideas, social forces, politics, culture, and the emotions that are stirred by them." The course is designed to complement an African-American history class that was implemented two years ago. Purcell is part of a team that includes Jerri Lippert, executive director of curriculum; Diane Carroll, English language arts curriculum specialist; and Jackie Hale and Rachel Hittinger, both English teachers. Hittinger plans to focus on creating a unit on based on African-American feminism.
Aurelia Henderson, a first-year creative writing major at Carnegie Mellon, believes that the desire of the Pittsburgh public school system to develop diverse courses is a positive sign and a progressive movement toward providing advanced education. "I feel all schools should offer the course to raise awareness of the African-American contribution to modern literature. I feel that's a really important point that is overlooked," Henderson said.
Purcell commented that it was a bold move to make this course a core class and not an elective.
"People of color have been contributing their experiences and imagination to this core for a long, long time," Purcell said. "In order to understand our human condition we must acknowledge that its core is in fact a constellation of different kinds of people and experiences."

Ferguson creates software
After being restarted in November, the Large Hadron Collider located at CERN, the European Organization for Nuclear Research near Geneva, Switzerland, is currently functioning successfully after repair work and is searching for the secrets to the universe, specifically what causes matter to gain mass. 
The Large Hadron Collider is the world’s largest particle accelerator, capable of colliding subatomic particles at high speeds to re-create the situations at the beginning of the universe. The target that scientists are searching for is a particle called the Higgs boson that would have given matter mass after the Big Bang. 
Physics professor Tom Ferguson has reason to closely monitor the particle accelerator’s progress. He has worked on the project for years while teaching at Carnegie Mellon. Ferguson’s work at Carnegie Mellon has been developing software for the collider’s particle detection system.
Although scientists have experimented with particle accelerators for some time (Ernest O’Lawrence invented the cyclotron in 1929 at the University of California, Berkeley), the LHC is the most advanced particle accelerator, covering 17 miles in a tunnel underground. Currently, 111 nations and scientists of many nationalities are all working together on the multiple components of the project. 
Students’ plays showcased
This semester, the School of Drama will showcase four new plays, the work of second-year students in the MFA program in dramatic writing. The interaction with the School of Drama allows the writers to refine their work and learn through the experience of actual production. Several of the writers have been recognized by the American College Theatre Festival regional conference, where Carnegie Mellon students won the top three prizes. The first week runs this Wednesday through Sunday.
The four plays are Bellhammer by Dean Poynor, Beneath by Carolyn Kras, The Beast of Skitter Creek by Brian Forrester, and A Boy Named Alice by Joshua Elias Harmon. In Bellhammer, Poynor combines elements of professional wrestling with Christian thought, and it will be the first play to be performed. The Beast of Skitter Creek centers on a monster story in the old South, where a minister unknowingly returns to his hometown.
Kras, in Beneath, writes of an excavation dig based on real ones in Iran in 1978, and Harmon tells the story of an adopted college senior searching for his true mother in A Boy Named Alice. All plays are being presented in the Wells Studio. For those who wish to see the play, tickets can be obtained for free one hour before the show.

While The Exchange isn’t currently known as a campus staple, it might soon be considered one. That's because The Exchange is the new name for Ginger’s Deli, located in Posner Hall. 
This is only one of the recent updates to the popular campus eatery. Ginger’s Deli is now painted red and has new tables, new chairs, and a new bar. The register has moved and now sits on an island that extends into the dining space. The specials board is MIA — we anxiously await its return — and the continental maps have been removed from the walls.
Among all of these changes is the name change to The Exchange, which was motivated by an effort to better incorporate the deli with the atmosphere of the Tepper School of Business.
Initiatives to update any part of campus, whether an academic building or busy lunch spot, are always appreciated. However, these changes should have the campus population in mind. 
The renovations leave less space for seating, and the new tables that were chosen are smaller than their predecessors. Additionally, a section of the bar was removed, further decreasing the dining space. Finding a table to sit and eat at has become a competition. The cash register that sticks out is awkwardly positioned and complicates accessing the fountain drinks. For students who wait in lines that extend well into the atrium of Posner Hall, these changes seem to have only made logistical problems worse. The changes provide no value in terms of decreasing the wait time to order, and they significantly decrease the amount of space available for dining.
In the future, campus would be better served by involving students in renovations. Although the renovation’s purpose was to make Posner more appealing to corporate visitors, this goal ignored the needs of students. If Housing and Dining Services had spoken with students to find out what changes they would liked to have seen, Ginger’s could have become an even better deli than the one we currently frequent, instead of exacerbating existing problems.
Despite all of these changes, the food and staff will still remain. So while we may have to hunt down a place to enjoy it, each sandwich will be as delicious as ever.

On Jan. 14, 2004, President Bush told us we were going back to the moon.
Last week, President Obama confirmed what many people had believed since that winter day: It wasn’t going to happen.
Maybe we were disillusioned by the decades of stagnation in NASA’s manned space program. Maybe it was the perpetual lack of Congressional funding of significant space initiatives since the Apollo program. Whatever the cause, few people actually believed there would be Americans on the moon by 2020. The last six years have borne out this suspicion, and the Constellation program is behind schedule and over budget.
And so now it is over. The Vision for Space Exploration, the grand project to return astronauts to the moon and send them onward to Mars, has been rejected. The space shuttles will stop flying this year, and there is no timeline or project for the next NASA manned space system.
The initial reaction to this announcement was outrage on the part of space enthusiasts. Another NASA program was being scrapped after years of development by myopic politicians trying to win easy votes. Instead of white stars on a blue field flying over the lunar surface, taikonauts would plant a red flag with gold stars. America’s prestige would fall, never to be regained.
Yet what at first appeared short-sighted now seems more persuasive by the day. NASA has never been able to recapture the spirit encompassed by the Apollo program in the 1960s. The manned space program since Nixon has consisted of space shuttles conducting scientific and technical missions in low Earth orbit. The International Space Station has been an enormous investment of time and resources without a clear objective. NASA, and the politicians who oversee it, have shown a complete inability to accomplish meaningful goals in human space exploration for the last 40 years.
Obama’s budget proposal reflects the report of a task force on space exploration. It reflects the reality, rather than the hopes, of NASA’s recent history. While it does end the national manned space program, it redirects this funding to more basic research and development. It provides funding for private space entrepreneurs who will find new ways to send humans into space without all the levels of bureaucracy that plague NASA.
The idea of private corporations leading America’s space exploration conjures images from Moon and other science fiction works, with corrupt executives colonizing the moon for profit or enormous conglomerates fighting over Earth’s natural satellite. 
But this is the logical next step in humans’ exploration of the cosmos. Americans do not expect the FAA to operate airlines, and as technology advances, they will have no reason to expect NASA to hold a monopoly on space travel. In this near-future society, NASA’s role will be to regulate the many viable “spacelines.”
Perhaps more importantly, the new budget allows NASA to redirect its focus from manned space programs to robotics and scientific missions. Robotics research is one of the most underappreciated successes of NASA. Through partnerships with research institutions and with its own engineers, the agency has created systems like the Spirit and Opportunity rovers, which have remained functional after over 24 times their projected mission length.
NASA was created as a response to the USSR’s launch of Sputnik: It is an artifact of the Cold War. Since the fall of the Soviet Union, and even in the years before, the agency has struggled to maintain a purpose that lacks its earlier urgency: It is time for NASA to transform from the only source of American space exploration into a guiding influence for future research. The United States may have to live with another country’s flag or business’s plaque on the moon, but in the end the country, and the world, will be better for it.

J.D. Salinger, the reclusive author of The Catcher in the Rye, recently died. His seclusion and abandonment of American society has been noted several times, but with his death come questions about the past 50 years of written material: What will become of his legacy? In popular culture, Salinger has come close to becoming the manifestation of his solitary character Holden Caulfield, only arising out of silence to prevent the butchering of his works.
Salinger once stated he had 15 unpublished novels. If he spoke the truth, the American public will see a renaissance of Salinger. Hopefully his daughter has begun to send manuscripts to an editor and work has already begun to see the release of his writing. Most likely, the first of his novels will be published in two or three years, giving editors and publications enough time to sort out his intentions with the novels. With such a reclusive and personal author as Salinger, heavily editing his works would result in one of the greatest crimes ever committed in literary history. Rumors have suggested that he gave instructions to his daughter as to how his works should be released.
Because of Salinger’s iconic reclusive nature, his cultural status is infamous through every living generation. Salinger was the author to know and read during his time. Both professors and the youth of today have been influenced by his works, and with further publications Salinger will become a focus of American culture. With the conclusion of the Harry Potter and the Twilight series, Salinger’s works will become the biggest literary releases. Both young adults and policy makers will read the same fiction, except the substance of these novels will be more fulfilling than J.K. Rowling’s simplistic Harry Potter series and Stephanie Meyer’s Twilight drivel-on-paper saga. This will not lead America into more serious fiction, a la Delillo, Pynchon, or McCarthy. However, it will allow America to discuss literature with substance.
The most important aspect of these publications, should they happen, will be to reveal Salinger’s true substance. He is not the “catcher in the rye,” as some would have us believe. His seclusion is not because of phoniness or tainted morality. Salinger’s mystique will begin to disperse, revealing him simply to be a great novelist who despised fame.
He is the man who caught America’s attention at his prime, and he will catch it once again years after his death.

According to a Jan. 26 article in The New York Times, the rate of teenage pregnancy is increasing after a long decline. Not only is the rate of teenage pregnancy increasing rapidly, but the rate of teenage abortions is as well.
But don’t take that as a reflection primarily upon the American teenage public, but rather as a reflection upon the poor state of the national sexual education system, which merits immediate reform.
After over a decade of decreasing teenage pregnancy rates, the rate of incidence of teenage births, abortions, and miscarriages is up between 2005 and 2006 — a period coinciding with extremely high levels of funding going toward abstinence-only education. That is, according to the same New York Times article, $150 million that is being spent annually on sexual education that encourages abstinence until marriage — and abstains from all discussion of realistic contraceptive measures.
I will not attempt to synthesize here the immensely complicated debate over sexual education in public schools nationwide. Further trivializing the argument by reducing it to a simple rehash of the debate is unlikely to effect any change in the public mentality. Suffice it to say that abstinence-only education is a heavy contender in the discussion over what is forcing the teenage pregnancy rate to skyrocket.
This is no longer an issue of morality. This issue is one of solving a problem: figuring out the best way to eliminate a contemporary problem plaguing our nation, and one that is bound to rise unless we start being realistic — and fast.
To reduce the rate of teenage births, abortions, and miscarriages, we must move past the debate over whether teenagers in public high schools should or should not learn about contraception as a moral issue. Public education, while it must have a foundation in what is right and wrong for the youngest generation of our nation, should not be based in antiquated ideas about morality that do not fit with the contemporary issues facing these teenagers. 
In this vein, we must face the issue of a rising rate of teenage pregnancy head-on, and recognize that there are real steps that can be taken to ensure that young women never have to face the trauma of an unplanned pregnancy.
The most concrete step that can be taken toward reducing the number of births, abortions, and miscarriages by teenagers is to reduce funding specifically directed toward abstinence-only education. These sexual education programs limit teenagers’ exposure to available knowledge about different methods of contraception — which can include total abstention. Moreover, funding must be reallocated such that it is used to promote education and knowledge about all working and reasonable forms of contraception.
What tends to happen in discussions about abortion and unplanned pregnancies, especially with regard to teenagers, is a simplistic and derogatory stereotyping of the young women affected by these situations. That is, it is easy to think that all teenagers facing unplanned pregnancies are nothing more than promiscuous, untamable children, therefore unworthy of education. There is a pervading thought underlying a lack of interest in educating the young women seemingly more prone to facing unplanned pregnancies: “*Will it even help?*”
But it will. Not all teenage women who have to deal with an unplanned pregnancy, abortion, or miscarriage are “helplessly” immoral or wanton. These young women are not unapproachable or foreign; they’re teenagers. In fact, no matter how these young women identify themselves — black or white, rich or poor, prep or punk — they deserve to discuss the realities of their sexuality, their potential consequences, and how they can protect themselves and their partners.
I do not mean to imply that I believe every unplanned pregnancy could have been prevented had some of these individuals been taught about safe sex practices in school rather than to abstain from sex until marriage. Mistakes will be made — to a degree, that is inevitable. I spoke with a woman who used to perform medical (pill) abortions for Planned Parenthood in Pittsburgh. Speaking under the condition of anonymity out of respect for the work done at Planned Parenthood and for the young women who have sought out its services, she told me about several teenagers who had three or more medical abortions in under a year and a half. 
It might be easy to write off these young women’s situations as potential outliers, or to think that the women are incapable of learning after experiencing the physical and emotion pain of an abortion. But the essence of the heartbreaking situation is this: These young women have not been properly educated about how to be sexual in a world where they’ve been taught they should be abstaining from sex. This has to change.
Moreover, educating teenagers does not absolve them of responsibility. An acknowledgment of young men and women’s right to learn about how to protect their bodies and look out for their own futures is an acknowledgment of their responsibility to use that knowledge wisely. Teaching high school students about how to use condoms and where to purchase them is not condoning promiscuity — it’s recognizing that we have a responsibility to ourselves as human beings and to younger generations as the future of our nation.

We’ve all had our moments, fueled by sleep deprivation and caffeine overdoses, when we’ve hated Carnegie Mellon and our decision to come here — there are a number of Facebook groups that give testament to this fact. Overall, however, we’d like to think that most of us end up leaving college with a sense of pride and accomplishment, and a desire to see our school continue to do well in the future. One way alumni often choose to demonstrate this pride is by supporting to their university with a donation.
In the past year, however, gifts to colleges and nations across the United States have declined by almost 12 percent, as noted by the Council for Aid to Education’s annual survey. This is the sharpest drop in the 53 years the survey has been taken, according to The New York Times. The article also mentioned that alumni donations alone dropped by 18 percent. Over the previous 10 years, total contributions had increased by an average of 4.1 percent per year, according to the same Times article, which makes this year’s drop even more obvious.
Although it is likely that the economic state is a major factor in this decline, it still paints a rather bleak picture for universities, especially for schools like Carnegie Mellon that already have a markedly smaller endowment than a majority of Ivy League institutions. This means less money that the university is able to offer to students for scholarships and grants, and less money that it is able to draw from for projects aimed at university improvements.
With this in mind, it is even more important that this year’s seniors, along with Carnegie Mellon’s alumni, remember how important their donations are, even if all they can afford after paying for their four (or more) years here is $10 or $20. As annoying as all the letters, e-mails, and Facebook messages asking for donations may be, they really do make a difference to the school, and in turn, what the school is able to offer to its students.

A common and consistent theme in student government campaigns at Carnegie Mellon is a promise of increased visibility or transparency — the notion that student government needs to communicate better with the people it represents and be clearer about its aims. Student government is notoriously bad at this very basic task, a point that has been made plain to me during my interactions with students who are unaware, for example, who their Student Senate representatives are or that the student body president actually represents and is elected by all students, including graduate students. 
While these misunderstandings may seem trivial, they are simply symptoms of a larger issue — that student government needs to work to better position itself as the first line of defense for students who are having problems or want to change something on campus.
This week, Student Senate and the Graduate Student Assembly passed significant revisions to our governing documents that added a new executive-level position, the vice president for organizations (VPO). The VPO, like the vice president for finance, will be elected by all students each spring and will be charged with chairing the Committee on Student Organizations (CoSO) and acting as a general advocate for student organizations. 
While the addition of the VPO cannot solve the problem of student government approachability overnight, I believe it’s a major step in the right direction. Too often, student organizations on campus feel as if they are in a constant fight against bureaucracy — struggling to get the funding they need, in a battle for the little space on campus afforded to them, and having trouble publicizing events and recruiting members. 
It’s my hope that the VPO role will put student government in a much stronger position to help student organizations navigate the complicated tangle of contracts, rules, and procedures that they have to deal with on a daily basis, and to make improvements to those processes whenever possible.
This spring, Student Senate is also going to be doing our best to ask for your advice and feedback — but don’t wait for us to come to you. We meet weekly on Thursdays at 5 p.m. in Margaret Morrison 103 (Breed Hall), and all of our meetings are open for student participation and questions. 
You elected us — now make sure that we’re hearing what you have to say. You can get in touch with me by e-mailing student-senate@.

For evidence of humanity in action, look toward the fact that nearly half of American households have donated to Haiti. This is a commendable part of human nature, as evidenced by the multitude of charitable organizations with a large quantity of donated relief items pouring in: toothbrushes and combs to Brother’s Brother, medical supplies to AmeriCares, family kits to Oxfam, as well as individual monetary donations. These efforts illustrate that caring is effective at the individual level, and a difference can be made with the sum of small contributions. This part of donating is certainly commendable.
However, do consider: The massive outpouring from the rich country only comes to the poor country in times of duress. The donations are a release of emotions as well as a release of purse strings. We want to feel something when helping an impoverished nation, and that something has to be unquestionably good. We desperately want to help ameliorate a devastating situation even at a distance, and we definitely do not want to be the odd one out — the apathetic non-donor. Photographic evidence tugs at our sympathy, making our comfort seem ostentatious in comparison to the overwhelming nothing the Haitians are left with. And thus, we donate.
But perhaps the biggest reason is that at some level, no matter what action we take, it feels inherently hypocritical. Our attention is commanded by disaster, devastation, and visceral, raw emotion. We donate and we care for a people with nothing because it feels irresponsible to have so much for ourselves. Even in the act of donating, the hypocrisy is that we may donate now, but by the metaphorical tomorrow, we may not. The greatest hypocrisy is caring so much in a concentrated period of time while still yearning for more material things for ourselves.
Materialism is inherent. Despite this, I am baffled by those who are not baffled by their own actions of genuinely caring so much for humanitarian purposes while at the same time accumulating more for themselves. Are we at odds with ourselves for writing a check to earthquake relief one moment and enjoying our luxury goods the next? Are we at odds with ourselves for watching the devastation from our HD flat screens, giving our credit card number to a relief agency, putting the card back into our Coach purses, and simultaneously amassing new scarves, bags, shoes, vacations — what have you — for our own temporal, carnal enjoyment? Do we not feel an inherent dissonance in wanting far more than is necessary while nations very close to us have so little, or is it that we placate this selfish mindset with good acts? I think not, because I do want to believe that caring comes from caring, not placation. Thus, the situation is even more baffling that we want both sides of selflessness and selfishness so earnestly.
The real test is after the fact. Do we keep on spending excessively despite the abject poverty that we are now awakened to, or do we use this as a lesson and a reminder that most material things we gladly pay for are transient whims and start appreciating everything we already have? This we have to settle for ourselves.

Reintegration. Reconciliation.
Recently these two words have picked up media buzz as possible strategies for dealing with the Taliban in Afghanistan. Reintegration allows current fighters to eschew violence and re-enter society; reconciliation would involve governmental recognition of the Taliban and an invitation to take part in peace talks and future political decisions. However, neither of these two strategies is a complete solution.
We are by no means advocating that reintegration and reconciliation are harmful — they aren’t. Yet, it is unlikely that a more open invitation for these soldiers to give up their guns will cause their entire army to dissolve: Reintegration has already been an option in Afghanistan for over five years. 
Reconciliation is even more difficult and a much more politically charged matter. The Taliban have had very real connections with al Qaeda that may make any sort of U.S. approval of this strategy impossible. Even with United Nations support for bringing the Taliban into the discussion, Pakistan’s agreement to assist, and King Abdullah of Saudi Arabia likely to mediate, it is unclear if agreement between the Taliban and the Afghan government in Kabul can be reached. 
Army General Stanley McChrystal recently said of the Afghanistan conflict, “This is all a war of perceptions.... This is all in the minds of the participants.” And it is. The Taliban continue to fight with the hope that other nations will give up or, more likely, be distracted by some other fight, allowing the Taliban to remove a heavily corrupt puppet government from leadership.
Today, Afghanistan has a government unable to provide protection for its people, and foreign governments are continuing to figure out the best way to proceed. But while world leaders are kicking around reintegration and reconciliation as possible paths to peace, the Taliban have yet to enter the discussion. We have yet to see a real solution that could gain acceptance from nations around the world or from the Afghan people themselves.
