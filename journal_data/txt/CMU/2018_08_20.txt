It’s almost time to hit the books again, folks! The dog days of summer are just about finished, and you can almost feel Pittsburgh getting ready for a fall full of sweaters, coffee, and falling leaves. The most important thing about these next few months, however, marks a unique time in sports: the NFL, NHL, and MLB will all have either preseason, regular season, or postseason matchups in September and October, and the black and gold is a team to watch in all three leagues.
The Pirates are currently in season, around two-thirds of the way done with their marathon 162-game season and are sitting in a tough spot. The 2018 Pirates have been defined by streaks: an 11-game winning streak that thrust the Bucs back into contention for a wild card spot, or a very recent 4-game losing skid that has lots of fans feeling regret that the front office went all-in at the non-waiver trade deadline, picking up RHP Keone Kela and RHP Chris Archer from the Texas Rangers and Tampa Bay Rays. These two trades cost the Pirates in their prospect pool, with the Bucs having to give up RHP Tyler Glasnow, OF Austin Meadows, and RHP Shane Baz, all top 10 prospects in the Pirates system at one time or another.
The bright side to all this is that the Bucs are holding onto Archer and Kela for a few years to come, and have a cheap, young, talented pitching roster under contract for the next couple of years, so even if they don’t make the postseason this year, which is very possible, they still have a chance in the coming years. Watch out for them to lose a wild card postseason matchup against the Brewers, if they make it at all.
The Steelers are looking hot right now. We’ve seen new additions from the draft in quarterback Mason Rudolph and receiver James Washington, both from Oklahoma State University. Their chemistry on the field was evident in the first two preseason games.
While we haven’t seen Big Ben Roethlisberger throwing at all, there’s no reason not to believe reports coming out of training camp that Big Ben is healthier and in better shape than he has been in quite a few years. Hopefully we’ll see another spectacular season from him and fellow veterans Antonio Brown and Le’veon Bell. The Killer B’s have been unstoppable in the past two years, and they aren’t looking to slow down any time soon.
The offensive trio that Pittsburgh possesses is dangerous and will be complemented with help from second-year receiver Juju Smith-Schuster, who had a breakout rookie year and has continued his success in the first two preseason matchups, with a touchdown reception in both games. Additionally, the Steelers look to have a solid one-two punch in the backfield as James Connor returns from a knee injury that ended his rookie season early. He has been doing much of the same hard-nosed, powerful ball-carrying as he did during his tenure with the University of Pittsburgh. Look for these guys to open their season strong, and carry this momentum over week to week.
The Penguins are in a tough spot. Their window of “greatness” is closing soon, with Sidney Crosby, Evgeni Malkin, and Phil Kessel all growing a little older, and they need to strike now while the iron is hot. The team is fresh off their first Stanley Cup playoff series loss in three years and are looking to return to the team they were when they won back-to-back Stanley Cups.
Although Malkin and Kessel are getting older, their production isn’t slowing down. Kessel is coming off a career year, scoring 92 points, breaking his previous high by 10. Malkin had 98 points last season, and only missed four games due to injury in the regular season. Crosby played all 82 games for the first time in his career, and although he didn’t score as many points as we’re used to seeing from him, he was still a threat every moment he was on the ice.
Overall, the Pens’ core is good. A strong presence that can be spread out on three lines, but what’s missing? Depth, all over the board, is the answer. The Pens addressed that problem in a rather strange manner this offseason, signing defenseman Jack Johnson to a 5-year deal, Matt Cullen to a 1-year deal, and a few other depth wingers. No one seems to stand out in the trades from this year. Jack Johnson is being heralded as a disappointment waiting to happen by every major sports newswriter, but I’m eager to see what the Penguins can do for him. These depth players don’t add a ton, but they might be competent enough to eat up some minutes for the top 6 guys. Look for them in the playoffs, but don’t expect another Cup win. I’m not too hopeful.

Islands can do funny things to an animal population.
Foster’s rule states that populations will get smaller or larger when isolated on an island depending on the available resources. When resources are limited, the species competing for those resources get smaller over time. This process, known as insular dwarfism, occurs when a population’s range is limited to a small area. Smaller animals require fewer resources, and a reduced size means shorter gestation periods and generation times.
We often forget it, but humans are not immune to the forces of evolution.
A recent report published in Science found evidence for two separate instances of insular dwarfism arising in hominins on the Indonesian island Flores. The first is the ancient extinct species Homo floresiensis. This diminutive species lived on the island for a period beginning about 700,000 years ago to 60,000 years ago, and had an estimated average height of only 106 cm (about 3’ 6”), earning them the nickname “hobbit.”
Not far from the Liang Bua cave where the hobbit fossils were found (along with several giant and dwarfed animal species – giant rats anyone?), there is a modern population of pygmy humans living on Flores. The researchers wanted to know: are the two populations related?
The question, though simple, is difficult to answer. We don’t have DNA from the Homo floresiensis fossils, so they couldn’t just identify ancient genes and then search the modern pygmies’ genomes for familiar fragments. To answer the question, the researchers from Princeton University had to go in the opposite direction.
The researchers looked at the DNA of 32 modern pygmies, who live on Flores in a village called Rampasasa, and have an average height of about 147 cm (4’10”). These modern pygmies have inherited genes from Neanderthals and Denisovans (another extinct hominin species). Scientists know enough about the genomes of these two extinct species to identify “chunks” of them in the modern humans’ DNA. Then, they can scan the genome for unfamiliar chunks that come from a different source, such as Homo floresiensis.
The researchers didn’t find any evidence of genetic material from an unknown source. This led them to conclude that there was no gene flow from the hobbits to the modern population. The modern Flores pygmies are most closely related to other East Asians, but about 23 percent of their ancestry comes from New Guinea. The lack of evidence for admixture of Homo floresiensis in the modern pygmies’ DNA suggests the action of a process called polygenic selection. As a polygenic trait, height is affected by variations of alleles at many different fixed positions on chromosomes (as opposed to one gene that can be ‘on’ or ‘off’).
The researchers found that the genomes of the population from Flores were enriched for height-decreasing alleles — more of these height-related loci contained variants that are associated with shortness. These genes were present in a common ancestor of both the modern Flores pygmies and Europeans. This means that natural selection worked with the genetic material present in the early population; genes from Homo floresiensis are not necessary to account for the reduction in height.
This method of investigation was potentially the only way to learn about the hobbit’s genome from extant populations. While the results are disappointing, they do lead to an interesting conclusion: insular dwarfism arose in two independent hominin populations on the same island. It’s not just animals that islands impact; they change humans too.

When you think about the Milky Way colliding with another galaxy, the first thing that probably comes to mind is its predicted collision with our neighbor galaxy Andromeda. Nicknamed Milkomeda or Milkdromeda, the collision is not expected to occur for another four billion years, possibly long after terrestrial life can be supported on Earth and hopefully long after someone can think of a better name for it.
However, it’s thought that the Milky Way has a long history of colliding with dwarf galaxies, reshaping its structure each time. For example, the Milky Way’s collision with the nearby Sagittarius galaxy may be to thank for our galaxy’s signature spiral arms.
A team of researchers, including Carnegie Mellon University Physics professor Sergey Koposov, have discovered that approximately eight to ten billion years ago, the Milky Way experienced a head on collision with one galaxy in particular, possibly its largest collision known to date.
This dwarf galaxy, nicknamed the “Sausage” galaxy, did not survive the impact. New papers in the Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society explain that the team of researchers used data from the European Space Agency’s Gaia satellite, which maps the stellar content of our galaxy. This data showed that the collision left that dwarf galaxy’s stars moving in radial orbits with a general oval shape which led to the galaxy’s nickname.
“We plotted the velocities of the stars, and the sausage shape just jumped out at us,” said Wyn Evans, a researcher in Cambridge. “As the smaller galaxy broke up, its stars were thrown onto very radial orbits. These Sausage stars are what’s left of the last major merger of the Milky Way.”
After the collision between the two galaxies, the researchers believe that the path of the stars from the mutilated Sausage galaxy took them to the center of the Milky Way, creating the “bulge” of stars at our galaxy’s center and the surrounding stellar halo. “This is a telltale sign that the dwarf galaxy came in on a really eccentric orbit,” said Vasily Belokurov of the University of Cambridge and the Center for Computational Astrophysics at the Flatiron Institute in a statement for the Simons Foundation. The researchers also believe that the Sausage galaxy is responsible for multiple globular clusters within the Milky Way.
The researchers plan to continue their study of the effects of this collision and the chemistry of the stars that came from the Sausage galaxy.

Two Carnegie Mellon professors from the School of Computer Science have been hired by Facebook to head the company’s new Pittsburgh artificial intelligence lab.
Is this the start of a promising research collaboration? Or just another case of the academic poaching plaguing top universities around the country?
The planned Facebook AI Research (FAIR) lab will be led by Jessica Hodgins, currently a professor of robotics and computer science. Hodgins, a leader in her field whose research focuses on human motion in computer graphics and robotics, is the current president of the Association for Computing Machinery’s Special Interest Group on Computer Graphics and Interactive Techniques (SIGGRAPH). Joining the lab will be associate professor Abhinav Gupta, who specializes in large-scale visual and robot learning.
The move was announced in July by Yann LeCun, the company’s director of AI research.
Carnegie Mellon, a leader in AI research, is a natural place for Facebook to look for talent. The university is ranked #1 in the country in AI research, and in the fall, it will be the nation’s first to offer an undergraduate degree in AI. (Facebook will also be upgrading its FAIR lab in Seattle, to be headed by a professor from the University of Washington.) Facebook’s choice to expand its presence in Pittsburgh is a logical one.
The ethics of the move, however, are less straightforward. By siphoning talent from top research universities, Facebook is ‘poaching,’ an increasingly unpopular move. Many believe the shift of research jobs from universities to corporations has highly privatized research, locking valuable scientific work behind non-disclosure agreements. When researchers leave academia for lucrative industry jobs, universities lose out on not only talent and intellectual property, but also grants, and the mentorship of young researchers.
When a job offer is made, it can be impossible for universities to retain their faculty; even the most idealistic have families to feed. Academic jobs are scarce, and academic jobs that pay are scarcer.
Poaching is by no means a new issue on campus. Carnegie Mellon made national headlines in 2015 when the university’s National Robotics Engineering Center (NREC) lost almost fifty people – a third of its staff – to Uber’s new Advanced Technologies Center (ATC). “They took all the guys that were working on vehicle autonomy – basically whole groups, whole teams of developers, commercialization specialists, all the guys that find grants and who were bringing the intellectual property,” a source reported, as quoted in a contemporaneous article by The Verge. “These guys, they took everybody.” Uber, then valued at between $60 billion and $70 billion, built the ATC to develop autonomous vehicles. The sheer scale of the controversial move brought national awareness to the issue of academic poaching.
Facebook, sensitive to how these issues might affect its image, maintains that they are not aiming to repeat the Uber exodus. “Facebook is careful not to deplete universities from their best faculty, by making it easy to maintain sizeable research and teaching activities in their academic labs,” LeCun, also a professor of computer science at New York University, wrote in the announcement. “Unlike others, we work with universities to find suitable arrangements and do not hire away large numbers of faculty into full-time positions bottled up behind a wall of non-disclosure agreements. We contribute to the local ecosystem.” He emphasized that “making these part-time splits possible is precisely the reason why we have been establishing labs in New York, Paris, Montréal, Tel Aviv, and now Seattle and Pittsburgh.” After a New York Times article suggested Facebook was guilty of poaching, Lecun responded that it “erroneously qualified this evolution as a ‘brain drain’ from academia.”
The consensus in the academic community? That’s exactly what’s happening. “It is worrisome that they are eating the seed corn,” said Dan Weld, a computer science professor at the University of Washington, in the New York Times story. “If we lose all our faculty, it will be hard to keep preparing the next generation of researchers.” University researchers hired part-time by Facebook often spend four-fifths of their time working at the company.
Despite its alleged goal, poaching often strains the relationships between academia and industry. Uber’s cherry-picking in 2015 stirred resentment in the university researchers left behind at the NREC.
Carnegie Mellon, in official statements, has maintained an optimistic outlook for the FAIR partnership. “We welcome Facebook’s FAIR lab to Pittsburgh, which will provide our faculty and students with new opportunities to engage in groundbreaking research. From experience with our many partners in the city, we know that corporate activity close to campus is of mutual benefit to the university and our partners,” said Mark Nolan, Carnegie Mellon’s associate vice president of institutional partnerships, as quoted in a July press release.
The press release also quoted Andrew Moore, Dean of the School of Computer Science, saying “Facebook’s new lab will create new opportunities to make advances in AI, both at the company and at CMU. Even better, both Jessica and Abhinav will continue their work at CMU, helping us educate the next generation of AI scientists.”
As a high-profile researcher, Moore has been discussing poaching publicly for several years – expressing frustration at the difficulty of retaining faculty, while remaining diplomatic and stressing the complexity of the issue. “It’s kind of crazy that these top folks on the faculty, most of their peers who go into industry are wealthy and don’t need to worry about money anymore, whereas [professors are often left] worrying about sending their kids to college. It’s very tempting to go, which is why I and the department heads here have actually begun encouraging them to do a startup for a few years, or else work for big companies, and come back,” he explained in a 2016 interview with TechCrunch. Moore himself rejoined Carnegie Mellon’s faculty in 2014 after 8 years at Google.
Overall, Moore encourages acceptance of the movement of researchers from academia to industry, and back, as the new reality of research. “At a place like CMU’s School of Computer Science, I expect to see more and more ebb and flow of the planet’s top roboticists, theorists and algorithmists. I don’t see the ‘ebb’ part of this as defeat. It just means we’re living in a free market for brilliant people,” he said in 2016.
According to the university press release, the FAIR lab “will focus on robotics, lifelong learning systems that learn continuously, teaching machines to reason, and AI in support of creativity.” It’s currently unclear what Facebook plans to do in the field of robotics.

1) Laundry: Just everything related to laundry. If you were spoiled your entire life and did not have the daunting task of doing your own laundry, do not fret! You are definitely not the only one. I came in not knowing how to complete this task. But then, someone opened my eyes to these wonderful things called Tide Pods! They have both fabric softener and soap so you just pop them in with your laundry. The best part is you are not required to separate clothing by color (you probably still should though)!
2) Sleep should be a priority: Your bed will be the best place to spend time after a long day. Sleep is vitally important in college. There are plenty of times to hang with friends and enjoy life, but take it from me, staying up late will not be your best friend during the week. With new classes, workload, and a different lifestyle, you will need some time to unwind and relax. Keep in mind, that there will no longer be someone directing you to bed, so it is up to you to be your own boss. :)
3) Trying new activities will open doors: I think this has to be the most generic piece of advice that you will hear continuously over your entire life, but it’s true! For example, my freshman year, I tried Ballroom Dance! I ended up loving the classes so much that I started competing on the team and have met some of the most amazing people through the club. College is a great time to try new and exciting things! Step outside of your comfort zone!
4) Homework should come first: I truly sound like a parent for this one but I feel that I didn’t always take this into account. You will experience copious hours of free time (primarily in the evenings) in which you are available to do what you choose. Choosing activities wisely is important.
5) Nutrition is key: When you leave home, there will no longer be someone instructing you on what to eat or when to eat. It is all up to you now! As silly as this sounds, you will get out of your body what you put in. If you eat nutritional and healthy foods with occasional treats, then you will benefit far more with energy as well as being attentive in class. And trust me, it will be challenging and new, but it is all part of the experience.
6) Exercise is a good form of relieving stress: I love sports and I always have, so for me exercising was always on my radar, but for some it is not. Regardless, if you are obsessed with sports or not, exercising for even half an hour will help reduce stress and also help you sleep better! For my freshman year, I wish I had taken more advantage of our amazing facilities in the Cohon Center and around the campus!
7) Taking advantage of opportunities on campus: There are a TON of opportunities on campus to take advantage of! For example, you can take part in one of the 200+ clubs run by students! There are also school jobs, student ambassador rolls, and student council as well!
8) You will not need as much clothing as you think: Trust me on this one. You may think that you need all these different options for clothing, but the reality of it is you will most likely be wearing the same outfit or cycle of outfits every week.
9) Utilize the benefits that come with your Student ID: Your Carnegie Mellon Student ID comes with so many benefits! For example, it is your entry pass on public transportation! Additionally, it will get you into some of the museums in Pittsburgh for free or at a discounted price! I wish I took more advantage of this during my first year.
10) Explore your city: Pittsburgh! Pittsburgh is an amazingly wonderful city with much to offer. For example, Phipps Conservatory, the Andy Warhol Museum, Heinz Field, Schenley Park, PPG Place, and much more! I personally wish that I had gotten to see more of my surroundings during the year so make sure to take advantage of that this year!
Good luck!

Whether you’re a freshman or an upperclassman, it’s easy to get comfortable with the nearby common spots to visit in Pittsburgh. Without realizing it, you find yourself gravitating to the places everyone else frequents and talking yourself out of venturing too far from campus. Sometimes it’s hard to even know where to start in terms of exploring the city. This is where I come in. Whether you want to recruit a group of adventure buddies or would rather opt for a solo outing, I’ve compiled a list of places worth visiting on your journey to becoming a Pittsburgher.
When You Want Something to Eat
Millvale Food Truck Park: The Millvale Food Truck Park is the place to go no matter what you’re in the mood to eat. The rotation of food trucks is constantly changing, serving everything from Argentinian steak sandwiches, to gyros, to a classic burger and fries. Stop by for dinner on the weekends and enjoy your meal as you watch the sun set, listen to live music, and play a few games of cornhole. Interested in a post-meal treat? Grab some ice-cream or a smoothie from one of the dessert trucks and stroll down to the river to take in a beautiful view.
When You Want an Outdoor Adventure
Frick Environmental Center: While Frick Park is known for its extensive hiking and biking trails, the park also boasts a new Environmental Center and community garden. The building itself is both functional and beautiful and hosts a variety of different sustainability themed events throughout the year. You can take a stroll through the wildflower meadow behind the center and watch the birds and other wildlife that frequent the space. Don’t forget to check out the garden while you’re there, and take a walk through the rows of fresh fruit and veggies. And the best part of the center is you can always add a loop through the forest into your visit.
When You Want Some Culture
Carnegie Music Hall: If you’re the kind of person that looks beyond the classroom for opportunities to learn, then it’s about time you looked into events at the Carnegie Music Hall. The Hall hosts an endless cycle of entertaining and educational lectures and performances by visiting authors, artists, and musicians throughout the entire year. And the guests aren’t B-list names you’ve never heard of. Last year the Music Hall welcomed legends like Isabel Allende, Sherman Alexie, and world renowned events like The Moth Mainstage. The best part of the Carnegie Music Hall is it’s just a five-minute walk from campus, so you don’t have any excuse not to enjoy Pittsburgh’s cultural offerings. 
When You Want to Window Shop
Butler Street, Lawrenceville: If you’re new to Pittsburgh, Lawrenceville is one of those neighborhoods you might not immediately think to explore since it takes a bit more effort than hopping on a 61 to get there. But, I can assure you, the added effort is well worth it. Butler Street in particular has something for everyone. It’s a great place to find something unique for your dorm room, buy a birthday gift for friends or family, and just enjoy some general retail therapy. Candle Lab, Wildcard, and Una Biologicals are just a few of the stores you won’t want to miss.
When You Want to Relax
Phipps Conservatory: Phipps is one of those Pittsburgh attractions that most Carnegie Mellon students visit within their first few weeks of school; it’s beautiful, free to students, and a convenient five-minute walk from campus. But as the year stretches on, students often forget to take advantage of the conservatory as a great place to take a break and relax off campus. On the weekends or just when you find yourself with the odd hour of downtime between classes, take some time to enjoy the sights and smells as you walk through the gardens or find a quiet corner to sit and listen to music.
When You Want to Watch a Movie
Manor Theater: The Manor Theater is the perfect place to see a movie when you want the effect of the big screen without giving up the coziness of your own bed. The Manor always feels comfy and intimate due to the old-fashioned concession stand, the small theater sizes, and the number of Squirrel Hill grandmothers and families that tend to frequent the theater. Ever find yourself in the mood to go to the movies by yourself? The Manor is the place to go. It’s a quick bus ride from campus and always offers a balance of blockbuster movies and lesser-known independent films.
Row House Cinema: From foreign films to indie flicks to Harry Potter marathons, Row House Cinema (a single screen theater in Lawrenceville) is always playing something unexpected. Each week the theater features a set of films all related to a certain theme such as magical realist works, 2000s cinema, or French new wave films. This theater is the perfect spot to catch a movie when you’re not in the mood to go see that blockbuster everyone else has seen and you want to be exposed to something different.
When You Want to be Active
ASCEND: College is the time to try new things, right? So why not go all out and try picking up a new physical activity like rock climbing? ASCEND Pittsburgh, an indoor rock climbing gym that boasts a 10,000 square foot “Walltopia,” is the best spot in the Burgh to learn. The gym offers yoga and other fitness classes in addition to their climbing courses all days of the week. Not only does ASCEND provide the resources for you to become an expert climber, but also a connection to the incredible community of climbers in the Pittsburgh area.
Arsenal Bowling: Bowling is one of those sports that doesn’t get enough credit. It’s the best way to do a physical activity without having to be too active which makes it the perfect sport for a busy Carnegie Mellon student. Head to Lawrenceville’s Arsenal Bowling with your friends to enjoy a few games after a long week and take advantage of the different daily specials and deals Arsenal offers. From Wednesday’s “Rock ‘N’ Bowl” to Friday’s “Fri-Yay DJ Party” your time at Arsenal is sure to feel more like a party than your average bowling experience.
When You Want Dessert
Millie’s Homemade Ice Cream: You’ll find out about Millie’s one way or another, so you might as well get hooked on the unique and delicious flavors of Millie’s ice cream as early as possible. The second you walk into Millie’s, you’re enveloped in the smell of warm sugar and overwhelmed by the number of options up on the board. But don’t worry, you’re sure to end up with the perfect cone no matter which flavors you pick. Not willing to wait in the long line? Head straight to the checkout and grab a pint (or five) to take home!
Naturoll Creamery: Naturoll Creamery specializes in hand rolled ice cream that’s poured out, mixed with toppings, and rolled up right in front of you. Half the fun of the Naturoll experience is watching your server expertly mince your toppings and create a cup of rolled perfection. They offer delicious standards, like the cupcake roll that features nilla wafers, icing, and rainbow sprinkles, and monthly specials, like a berry-filled concoction for the 4th of July. But you’re never limited to the menu options on the board; you can also choose from the seemingly endless list of toppings (nutella, oreos, pretzels, graham crackers, and brownie pieces, to name a few) and create a Naturoll that’s all your own.

Hey Natalie,
So I’m about to start my first semester at college, and I come from out of state. I was the only one from my school – from my town, even – to go to Carnegie Mellon, so I feel like I’m all alone here. Everyone in my hometown all went to the same school, so we all practically grew up together. Coming here, I feel like I left everything behind – including all my friends.
Carnegie Mellon is somewhat a big school and there are tons of people, but I feel like I’m waaaay too socially awkward to try to make friends. I know the whole purpose of orientation is to meet new people and make friends, but I’m still super worried that everyone else already knows someone and already has friends here. Also, having to live with a roommate who is practically a stranger really freaks me out, but I don’t want to be alone. Do you have any advice for me?
-Loner, Oddball, Shy Too
Dear LOST,
Coming to a new school can be scary, especially to one that’s in a completely different state. I get how you feel: whether high school was a good experience or not, you spent four years with the same people in the same place. You spent all that time getting to know people and built friendships - and now, it feels like you have to do it all over again.
But the beautiful thing about college is this: everyone’s in the exact same boat. I remember first coming to Carnegie Mellon – I’m from out of state too, my hometown being a good couple thousand miles away in California – and feeling pretty similarly to you. But everything got easier the moment I realized that there were plenty of other people around me who felt the exact same way – scared, anxious, and alone. Turns out, those feelings are a pretty unanimous freshman year experience. Who knew, eh?
In all seriousness, it can be pretty scary to put yourself out there. It’s easy to acknowledge that everyone else is just as anxious as you are, but harder to do something about it. It will probably take a few days for everything to settle and to feel normal, but you will most definitely make friends soon enough. You are an amazing person surrounded by amazing people who all want to make friends, so I really encourage you to be brave and say just one word: “Hi.” After all, a great many friendships have started with a simple greeting! You’ll find out soon enough that Carnegie Mellon is full of incredibly open and welcoming people, and it’ll start to feel like home.
If you’re looking for some specifics, there are some really simple ways to try to grow your friend circle! For instance, leave the door to your dorm room open (while you’re in your room, of course)! This presents itself as a literal open invitation for others to say hi, and encourages conversations. Explore the different clubs on campus and join one that suits your interests. Clubs are always super friendly and eager to get new members, and can lead to some really meaningful and lasting relationships. And honestly, your RAs and OCs are your friends. They’ll always be happy to point you to your class or sit down and eat lunch with you.
You’ve already done an amazing job getting here and have already taken some brave steps to begin with. And I know it can be hard to see, but leaving your hometown is not an end. It’s just a new beginning.
Good luck to ya out there,
Natalie
P.s. about your roommate – don’t wake them up at ungodly hours of the morning, and you’ll be fine. I promise.
~
Dear Natalie,
I’m going to be blunt: I’m worried college will be too hard for me. High school wasn’t that bad, I was a straight-A AP student, but hearing other students talk it seems like my grades are going to take a serious drop and it seriously worries me.
I mean, I already know Carnegie Mellon isn’t exactly a school where I can breeze on by. I’ve always tried to get A’s and get the best possible scores, but I get really discouraged when I hear other students say, “Well, I just need to pass to get my degree!” I’m just worried that I’m going to really struggle here. Do you have any advice about the college workload?
-From An Idiot Loser
Dear FAIL,
Since you did me the honor of being blunt, I will do you the same: I won’t lie. College can get pretty tough. There may be moments where you question your major or the legitimacy of your place here at Carnegie Mellon. But you know what? You’ve already got what it takes to succeed here. How do I know that, you might ask? Well, you’re already here, aren’t you?
We place a lot of our personal worth on our academic performance, especially at higher colleges like Carnegie Mellon. It can be difficult to separate yourself from the percentage you get on an exam, trust me, I know. A lot of straight-A and AP students have trouble dealing with the fact that their GPA will never be a 4.7 again, and that’s totally okay. The most important thing to remember is that it is MORE THAN okay to ask for help. 
My freshman year, I seriously struggled in Calculus despite having an A in my math class senior year. It might sound silly, but for a long time I refused to ask for help; back in high school, asking for help meant you couldn’t do it yourself, which meant you weren’t as smart as the kids who could (brutal, isn’t it?). I had to come to a tough realization that I was going to fail if I didn’t, so I took the hard-to-swallow pill and went to tutoring. I had almost failed a class just because I was too prideful to ask for help. But once I did, everything got so much easier. 
Everyone struggles. There will always be a hard class. But there are some really great resources on campus to help you when you need it. Your biggest one is your fellow students! We all know the struggle, and in my experience, everyone has been more than willing to help you out if you need it. There’s always tutoring – taught by TAs and upperclassmen – and you can get professional coaching through our Academic Development center. Go to office hours, reach out to your professor – we’re all here to help you succeed, and there is no shame in asking others for help. 
TL;DR: Don’t be freshman year me. Ask for help when you need it. Someone will gladly be there for you to help with a tricky formula or to bring you those sweet sweet calculus notes.
Now get out there and get those grades!

When I first arrived to Pittsburgh, one thing I quickly learned is that the city has an underrated food scene. There’s something for everyone, and there are endless choices within walking or busing distance of Carnegie Mellon’s campus. There are three main neighborhoods that surround campus: Oakland to the west, Shadyside to the north, and Squirrel Hill to the southeast. All three neighborhoods have amazing food choices to offer, and here are some you have to check out!
Oakland
Pamela’s Diner
A Pittsburgh breakfast staple since 1980, Pamela’s Diner is famous for its crepe-style pancakes, called hotcakes. They’re thin and crispy at the edges, and are delicious with cream and maple syrup, or stuffed with fruit like strawberry and blueberry. I also recommend the corned beef hash with two eggs on the side. Down Forbes Avenue, Pamela’s is a great spot to get your day started on the weekends. The wait can get pretty long, so plan accordingly.
Las Palmas
Down Atwood Street off Forbes Avenue, Las Palmas is easy to miss, but the tacos are decidedly can’t-miss — they’re that good. Las Palmas is a food cart attached to a small Mexican grocery store. For $2.50 a taco, you can get authentic Mexican tacos with any meat and unlimited toppings, from salsa to guacamole to chimichurri.
The Porch
If you’re looking for a more formal spot, try The Porch. Next to Schenley Plaza and the Carnegie Museums, this place is perfect for a nice brunch, late-night cravings, or a place to take the family. They offer a wide variety of daily soups and salads, thin-crust pizzas, and large sandwiches. And from Monday through Thursday, go between 9-11 p.m. for half-off pizzas!
Shadyside
Noodlehead
Along South Highland Avenue, the 71B will take you straight to this student hotspot. I would describe Noodlehead as thai food for millennials. The place is rustic, with dark mood lighting and many decorative plants. The menu is limited, and it’s cash only, but the entrees are so good it doesn’t matter. They offer pad thai, curries, and pork buns, but my favorite is their see yew, with flavorful wide noodles and the choice of chicken, shrimp, or tofu.
Millie’s Homemade Ice Cream
Next door to Noodlehead is Millie’s Homemade Ice Cream, my favorite ice cream spot in Pittsburgh. Millie’s rotates flavors by month, but has great staples in Chad’s Vanilla and Vietnamese Coffee. I’ve loved their temporary flavors like Lavender and Mango, and I’m always excited to see what new things they come up with. But the one thing you must get is the waffle cone. It’s warm and delicious with a touch of cinnamon, and really makes the ice cream sing.
The Yard
Off the bustling Walnut Street, The Yard is quintessential Pittsburgh. Wood floors, a long bar, and ample television sets for sports-watchers. The Yard is all about grilled cheese. They put everything on it—mac ‘n’ cheese, onion rings, pulled pork, pierogis—literally any grilled cheese concoction you can think of. Also be sure to try the sweet potato fries with the cinnamon butter dip. Your stomach will be so full, but so very happy.
Squirrel Hill
Sichuan Gourmet
Squirrel Hill boasts many wonderful Asian restaurants, and Sichuan Gourmet might just be the best of the bunch. Any of the 61 bus lines will take you to the intersection of Forbes and Murray Avenue, and this place is right down Murray. The menu has some truly authentic Chinese choices, like stir-fry green beans, braised beef tendon, and sliced pork belly. They also have an American menu, with staples like lo mein and General Tso’s chicken, but I suggest trying the Chinese menu; many of my Chinese friends say it’s the best in the city.
Everyday Noodles
If you’re in the mood for noodles, Everyday Noodles is the place for you, right down Forbes past Murray. Inside the restaurant, there is a glass window so patrons can see the chefs make the hand-made noodles from scratch, threading the dough through their fingers. The beef noodle soup is some of the best I’ve had in the States, and the soup dumplings are top-notch as well.
Waffallonia
It’s right there in the title: waffles! Waffles and a scoop of ice cream, waffles slathered in Nutella, waffles with banana and strawberry — this place has a wide variety of combinations of sweet desserts. Each one is pretty large, so you can split one with a friend after a nice meal down the street. The only downside is that there’s limited seating, but the waffles go quickly, so it’s usually not a problem.
There are many more food places in Pittsburgh that I love, but these are the best spots to get started. Bon Appetit!

Carnegie Mellon University’s School of Computer Science announced that a new artificial intelligence (AI)  major will be launched this year, the first undergraduate major specific to AI among United States universities.
The unprecedented move was in response to the rapid growth of artificial intelligence in the field of computer science, as well as the ways in which the study of computer science has shaped Carnegie Mellon, from the work of Allen Newell and Herbert A. Simon in the 1950s, all the way to today, where the School of Computer Science is considered one of the best programs in the country.
Andrew Moore, Dean of the School of Computer Science, explained in a press release that “Carnegie Mellon has an unmatched depth of expertise in AI, making us uniquely qualified to address this need for graduates who understand how the power of AI can be leveraged to help people,” showing clear optimism in the program.
Students in the School of Computer Science will have the choice to declare a major in artificial intelligence after the conclusion of their first year. 
Dean Moore expects the artificial intelligence major to start small right now, with around 35 students per class and around 100 students total in the program, but he told Forbes in an interview on the new major that he expects growth in response predicted demand, noting that the main thing inhibiting untethered growth of the department and major in the future is the lack of “physical space on campus, especially dorm rooms,” not a lack of qualified faculty or candidates.
As for what the actual major will consist of, students will have to take a comprehensive array of math, core computer science, and core AI subject classes, as well as one class in ethics and one in cognitive psychology, Dean Moore told Forbes.
Many of those familiar with computer science know that with advancements in artificial intelligence, profound ethical issues and implications arise. In an interview with The Tartan, Dean Moore said that “we need SCS graduates to be schooled in how to perform their own ethical thinking about whole new [classes] of unforeseen issues that will arise for them during their jobs.”
Future students in the artificial intelligence major will have ethical training to a degree — though it is only one class. They can choose between Professor Jen Keating and Professor Illah Nourbakhsh’s “AI and Humanity,” Professor David Danks’ “AI and Humanity and Society,” or Professor Jim Herbsleb’s “Ethics and Policy Issues in Computing,” Moore told The Tartan.
The creation of a permanent major in artificial intelligence may come as a surprise to some, especially those who view AI research as something that follows public and scientific popularity fads, waxing and waning in response to the progress being made in the feild.
To this, Dean Moore told The Tartan that the computer science department “expect[s] a backlash against the discipline as the realization dawns that exciting as AI is, it is not magic, but simply a toolbox of theory and techniques to simulate intelligent behavior.”
He, however, believes that AI is here to stay. He states, “it really is different this time; as a purely engineering discipline you can use tools from AI (perception, learning, decision-making and actuation) in all the major industrial verticals with great impact.” What can be done right now given the current state of AI technology, rather than past theoreticals on what will be done in the future, is what separates the present from the past, Moore noted.
The major in artificial intelligence in the School of Computer Science has already attracted the attention of Bloomberg, Forbes, and CNET, among others, without even having students entered in the program yet. Opportunistic or not, Carnegie Mellon University has the distinct claim of being the only United States university with a major in artificial intelligence.
Dean Moore concluded his statements with The Tartan stating that those most beneficial to AI projects he’s worked on are those who have been “exposed to the physics of perception, the mathematics of statistical learning, the systems issues of cloud and edge compute, and the theory of computer science.” With this major, he says, “this is a chance to be one of those people!”

Starting Sept. 10, Carnegie Mellon University Libraries will be enforcing new food policies across all campus library locations. Changes to the libraries’ food policies have been gradual, starting with last year’s food restriction on Hunt Library’s fourth floor to protect the artifacts in the Fine and Rare Books Room. However, a survey sent out to the community indicated the need to expand food restrictions to other floors and locations.
Shannon Riffe, Carnegie Mellon’s Director of Marketing and Communications, explains that feedback was varied, with about half of the respondents supporting further restrictions while the other half didn’t want any change. “Those survey results, coupled with what we were experiencing in the libraries prompted us to re-evaluate our food policy,” said Riffe.
As more and more students have taken advantage of the university’s library services over the past ten years, Riffe notes that staff members have observed an increase in vermin, food spillage, overfull trashcans, and complaints from patrons and employees. Although snacks and covered beverages are still allowed in many locations, limiting full meals from students will ultimately decrease the volume of food and the resulting trash and and uninvited critters that staff members and other patrons have to deal with. Students who are caught violating this new policy will be asked to move to another floor or area to finish their meal.
These new restrictions are focused primarily on protecting the libraries’ collection of books while being more lenient in areas without books “such as the basement of Hunt and the collaborative work area in Sorrells,” explains Riffe. For example, “while the first floor of Hunt houses our reference collection, the Maggie Murph café is a great amenity for our visitors, so it made sense to continue to allow meals there.”
By doing their part in complying with these new rules, students will help to ensure we “maintain a comfortable, clean environment for our patrons and preserve our collections,” says Riffe.
The new policy can be accessed online at https://www.library.cmu.edu/about/food. Students are invited to let the university know what they think of these new policies by visiting http://www.library.cmu.edu/about/contact.  
Drinks & Snacks
Non-alcoholic drinks in covered containers and small, contained snacks are permitted throughout Libraries spaces with the exception of:
Hunt Library, Fine and Rare Books Room 
Hunt Library, University Archives 
Hunt Library, Computer Cluster in the basement
Mellon Institute Library, Main Reading Area

Every juicy heist movie has an equally juicy target. Though the quarry may be jewels or cash or art, the location of the crime seems always to be some ostentatious locale, dripping in gold trim that requires the thieves to be dressed to the nines in order to blend in.
The Carnegie Library of Pittsburgh, though certainly a lovely building, does not match up to this expectation. Library patrons at the main branch in Oakland are largely students, working people, and families that seek a quiet refuge where they can get work done or pass the time. However, the Carnegie Library of Pittsburgh and Caliban Book Shop, a bookstore located almost across the street from the library, served as the staging area for what the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette called "one of the largest library thefts in history."
The books were discovered to be missing in a 2017 audit. The over 300 books that had disappeared or been cut up were estimated to be worth around 8 million dollars. Works ran the gamut from a rare copy of Newton’s Principia Mathematica, to a first edition of Adam Smith’s Wealth of Nations, a report from the 1870s titled Reports of the Inspectors of Mines of the Anthracite Coal Regions of Pennsylvania, suffragist Elizabeth Cady Staton’s autobiography, and rare 16th century Bibles.
Library archivist Greg Piore was arrested in mid-July, along with co-owner of the Caliban Book Shop, John Shulman, after being charged with criminal conspiracy and theft. Piore had been smuggling the books to Shulman since the mid 1990s, after which, according to New York Times, Shulman would pay Piore upfront and sell the books to rare book collectors. The Pittsburgh Post-Gazette reported that Piore would drop items off at Caliban Book Shop on his way home, transporting pages from books that he had cut up in manila folders or sometimes simply rolling them up in bigger items.
The pair stopped stealing books in 2016 after having heard that the audit would take place, and Piore was fired in 2017 after the audit. Both men turned themselves in in July, and a preliminary hearing on Aug. 1 determined that Shulman could continue to pay the expenses of Caliban Book Shop, though neither Shulman nor his wife and co-owner of Caliban Book Shop, Emily Hetzel, would be allowed to profit from the enterprise.
Though the Carnegie Library exists in stark contrast to the highly fortified treasury building, gaudy casino, or billionaire’s mansion guarded by lasers that the scale of this theft may evoke, this crime spurred attention and national coverage due to its novelty. The Carnegie Library of Pittsburgh, and libraries in general, seem almost sacrosanct, perhaps due to the forced quietude or the stone walls or maybe the idea that knowledge should be accessible to the public for free. The fact that the person charged with caring for these books violated this trust for personal gain made the story surprising to many who may have not though of libraries as repositories of wealth. But then again, this is a crime that was carried out in a library named for a man who was once the richest man in the United States, in a room full of expensive books locked away from the public eye.
In the aftermath of this affair, both the Carnegie Library and Caliban Book Shop will keep functioning, though millions of dollars worth of books remain missing. Carnegie Mellon students have already started to return to both institutions in preparation for a year where their main concerns about expensive books will probably be directed at those of the textbook variety.

Carnegie Mellon University’s 2018 undergraduate orientation kicks off on Sunday, Aug. 19, and continues throughout the week until the following Sunday, Aug. 26, the day before classes officially begin.
The Orientation schedule is overflowing with activities for students of any background and of all different interests. With the theme “Dare to Discover,” orientation introduces incoming first-years to Carnegie Mellon’s campus and community, while providing opportunities to engage in academic, extracurricular, and community activities.
Academics
During the week, each college has dictated time slots during which students can seek walk-in advising and ask any questions they may have.
On Tuesday afternoon, there will be several informational sessions about many academic opportunities offered on campus. For example, students can learn about the interdisciplinary collaboration IDeATe (Integrative Design, Arts and Technology) network at the IDeATe Information Session and Tour of Maker Facilities (2-2:30 p.m.) or learn about the CMU Washington Semester Program (3-3:50 p.m.).
On Wednesday evening, each college hosts dinner and evening activities from 4:30 p.m. to midnight. After noon, students will bus to different locations around Pittsburgh. BXA Intercollege Degree Program and College of Fine Arts students will go to the Children’s Museum; College of Engineering students will enjoy an evening of laser tag at Zone28; Dietrich College of Humanities and Social Sciences students will visit the Heinz History Center; Mellon College of Science students will explore the Carnegie Science Center; School of Computer Science students will tour the Google Pittsburgh Offices; and Tepper School of Business students will attend a reception at PNC Bank’s Headquarters and visit attractions in downtown Pittsburgh.
Academic Orientation is scheduled on Thursday (8:30 a.m.- 4 p.m.), when students will have the opportunity to meet deans, professors, advisors, and learn about courses and expectations. This is followed by Convocation (5-6:10 p.m.) on the College of Fine Arts Lawn.
Extracurriculars
As a university, Carnegie Mellon offers a wide variety of extracurriculars. On Tuesday, join the Mindfulness Room Open House (2-3:50 p.m.) to learn about this innovative opportunity to relax and cultivate wellness through dog therapy. There will also be sessions about service and civic engagement on campus (3-3:50 p.m.) and Greek Life (3-3:50 p.m.).
On Friday from 1 to 4 p.m., the Club Sports Showcase will take place on The Cut, where students can try out different sports such as quidditch, lacrosse, and fencing. On Friday, Saturday, and Sunday, there will also be religious events hosted by various religious organizations on campus.
Community
Some of the highlights of orientation are focused on building strong bonds between incoming first-years. At Playfair (Monday, 8-9:30 p.m.), called “the largest icebreaker ever!” students are encouraged to meet as many people they can in the class of 2022+. On Tuesday at 10:30 a.m., late Carnegie Mellon professor Randy Pausch’s Last Lecture will be shown in McConomy Auditorium, followed by a time for discussion. Later that evening, students will take their class photo on the Baker Hall Lawn.
Often many students’ favorite event, Casino Night, is held on Thursday evening (8:30 p.m.-midnight), when students get to dress up for the week’s biggest social event with food, dancing, and table games. On Friday night (7-9:30 p.m.), students will compete in House Wars in their house colors and themes for the coveted Carnegie Cup. The First-Year Showcase will begin at 8 p.m. on Saturday evening. Auditions and rehearsals are scheduled throughout the week to select the chosen few to perform for the class.

Did you know who the Guardians of the Galaxy were in 2014?
Probably not. But hey, that sounded like an awesome name, right? And this movie that they’re featured in is made by the same company that made Iron Man and The Avengers, so it HAD to be good.
That was the mindset that I had when I went to see the James Gunn-directed flick from Marvel Studios, but walked out completely blown away by its wild originality, its beautiful and expansive world-building, its great humor, and by the fact that Guardians of the Galaxy felt so new and fresh within the Marvel Cinematic Universe.
Despite its obscure D-list characters, Guardians of the Galaxy grossed over $770 million worldwide, defying expectations and becoming one of the most successful movies of the summer – in August, a rare feat for any summer blockbuster. In a skit called “Marvel Can’t Fail,” Saturday Night Live took aim at the fact that, since the monstrous success of The Avengers, Marvel Studios could make a film about anything and still make millions of dollars.
It is that same kind of mob mentality that forced The Walt Disney Company to fire James Gunn, director of Guardians of the Galaxy and its sequel Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2, from the production of Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 last month, after far-right personality Michael Cernovich unearthed James Gunn’s old tweets from ten years ago, in which Gunn makes gay slurs and jokes about pedophilia, rape, and child molestation among other disgusting topics.
It is impossible to deny the fact that Cernovich had intentions to target Gunn, an outspoken critic of Donald Trump. But what is more disturbing is that Cernovich used movements like #TimesUp and #MeToo to do so.
Ever since Ronan Farrow wrote about Harvey Weinstein’s sexual assault allegations last October, we have seen powerful figures from various career worlds – journalists, actors, athletes, Hollywood executives, politicians – who have abused their positions of power, being taken down by the public. During the immediate wake of these allegations, there was a small period where the world felt united. People who had decided to come forward with their allegations were met with an outpouring of support from the Internet. Women had begun to truly realize that they were not the only ones experiencing this level of harassment within their daily lives. Around the world, people strove to come up with solutions for what the world could do better.
As more and more cases and allegations were brought to the limelight, however, some claims were proven to be false or over-exaggerated. Not everyone who got accused received the same kind of attention and action as other cases. The more these movements were thrust into the public eye, the more they became, according to Liam Neeson, “a bit of a witch hunt.” By January 2018, #MeToo and #TimesUp became a necessary inclusion into Hollywood’s awards shows and overall culture.
Cernovich, a man who was charged with rape in 2005 and had falsely publicized a conspiracy about Democrats starting a child-sex ring in 2016, exploited this popularity in the movement to target his political enemies. Cernovich saw the public instinct to grab pitchforks at the hint of an abuse of power, and abused it to solely benefit himself. As a result, after Cernovich lit the match and unearthed Gunn’s tweets, the looming power of the public had done the rest – leading Disney to break all business ties with Gunn.
Possibly the worst thing to come out of this situation is that Cernovich took one man’s era of redemption to falsely (and hypocritically) remind the world that humans aren’t allowed to make mistakes. James Gunn has been candid about and has apologized for vulgar remarks he has made in the past, learning from his attitude since then to become a better person. Coming from a studio that often tells and benefits from stories of redemption, tales of rags-to-riches success, and adventures about conquering your own inner demons, Disney’s decision to fire Gunn was incredibly ironic.
Ten days after James Gunn was fired, the Guardians of the Galaxy cast made a joint statement together voicing support of Gunn, with one of the stars Dave Bautista even going as far to say he would quit the franchise if the studio did not use Gunn’s original script. In their memo, the cast hoped that people “can ease up on the character assassinations and stop weaponizing mob mentality,” talking about how Gunn is truly a good man and sharing feelings on how they were “discouraged by those so easily duped into believing the many outlandish conspiracy theories surrounding them.” While they are able to break away from the mob mentality surrounding the situation through their own personal knowledge of Gunn, this is not always the case whenever we read the news about one controversy after the other.
As we are taught to be independent while we transition to college, we are also taught that it’s completely okay to stand out in the crowd. We are taught that it’s completely okay to be different, to stand up for what we believe in, and are taught that our own beliefs matter to us. During Orientation, we are taught that our differences are fundamental to who we are, and all contribute to a part of the campus culture and experience in a greater way that can only benefit ourselves and others.
So the next time when everyone else in the world seems to tell you to move on when you want to speak up, to quote Peggy Carter, “it is your duty to plant yourself like a tree, look them in the eye, and say ‘No, you move’.”

Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez seemed to have emerged out of nowhere. She defied odds by winning the Democratic primary in the 14th congressional district, replacing Democratic Caucus Chair Joe Crowley. Ocasio-Cortez, an outspoken 28-year-old Latina woman, stands tall and echoes the new direction of the Democratic Party: abolishing the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), raising the hourly minimum wage to $15, and having Medicare for all, to include a few. This captured the interest of many across the nation, leading to her being deemed as the “future of the Democratic Party” by Democratic National Committee (DNC) leader Tom Perez.
If she truly is the so-called “new face,” we have a reason for concern regardless of our respective political stances. Recently, Ben Shapiro, famous conservative commentator and editor-in-chief of The Daily Wire, challenged Ocasio-Cortez to a debate. “I would love to have a real conversation about the issues.” He addressed that he understands why Ocasio-Cortez Shapiro may be hesitant to debate, but he offered to give $10,000 to her campaign for an hour debate on his show. He ended the request by saying that he wants to “make America a more civil and interesting place.”
Her response? “Just like catcalling, I don’t owe a response to unsolicited requests from men with bad intentions. And also like catcalling, for some reason they feel entitled to one.”
Shapiro is famous for saying “facts don’t care about your feelings,” and this is truly the case in this scenario. Facts don’t care about where you lie on the political spectrum, but facts do care to show that this is yet another example of political dialogue further shutting down. Regardless of your views on either Ocasio-Cortez or Shapiro, the fact that the “future of the Democratic Party” insinuates that a man initiating a woman to debate is morally equivalent to “catcalling”is troublesome.
Perhaps I’m naive in believing that Shapiro would challenge Ocasio-Cortez if she were male; however, Ocasio-Cortez used Shapiro’s sex to insinuate that she is a victim. By labeling him as a man “with bad intentions” and as morally devoid as a catcaller, she shut down any chance of dialogue. However, she has yet to respond to debate requests from female conservative commentators. I want to believe that she is too busy to check Twitter, studying up on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict in light of her recent PBS interview with Margaret Hoover or improving her campaign and looking for outlets where she can resonate her message to voters. Realistically, however, if she saw Shapiro’s tweet and the several people tagging her, she most likely saw at least one of many debate requests and is not putting debates very high on her campaign to-do list.
Perhaps this sort of response appears to be justified given that Trump and his administration gets to avoid giving clear answers by calling off the liberal “fake news” media bluff. Of course, that lack of transparency and deflection is also harmful to our country and its political climate. However, regardless of whether there is a worse bluffing in the White House or not, her response — and the respective support she received consequently — further reinforces this new norm that we are enabling.
Former President Barack Obama garnered attention by telling a passionate rally quote “Don’t boo; vote!” Additionally, former presidential candidate Bernie Sanders showed great opposition against banning controversial speakers, such as Ann Coulter, from university campuses, encouraging opponents to argue her instead of silencing her. When thinking about contemporary progressive politicians, Obama and Sanders are among the first to come up in people’s heads. This was the image that portions of the Democratic Party have attempted to illustrate to its voting base, and we are taking a sharp turn by showing the same voting base that it’s okay to demonize those who challenge our views.
There are some possible factors leading to Ocasio-Cortez not taking up Shapiro’s debate: one being the debate is hosted by Shapiro himself. Because the debate would take place on Shapiro’s show, the respective audience would largely consist of Shapiro supporters. Therefore, it makes sense that being on his show probably may not have been the most fruitful use of her time regardless of the monetary gain from the debate. However, her response did not just shut off her willingness to debate with Shapiro; her response shut off her willingness to debate, period. Additionally, if it was just the fact that she did not want to be on the Ben Shapiro show, she would not have ignored the other requests from conservative voices.
Another reason that she may not be willing to debate lies in the strength of her campaign, or lack thereof. Politico, a political fact-checker, has repeatedly disproven several of her claims. The Washington Post went so far as to even award one of her claims “Three [out of Four] Pinocchios” due to how misleading her claim on Medicare was. Her PBS interview with Margaret Hoover didn’t help her image, especially when she backpedaled her claim that Palestine is being “occupied” by claiming that she is “not the expert on geopolitics on this issue”. More likely, Ocasio-Cortez is not ready to enter the political scene, especially when she blames the criticism raised from fact-checkers on sexism.
Ocasio-Cortez cannot have her “I won’t debate you” cake and eat it, too. Conservative commentator Allie Beth Stuckey had challenged Ocasio-Cortez, which had not warranted a response. However, a satirical interview that she posted resulted in Ocasio-Cortez speedily tweeting that “Republicans are so scared of me that they’re faking videos and presenting them as real on Facebook because they can’t deal with reality anymore.” How long did it take to respond to the satirical video? One day. The debate request? We’ve yet to find out.
I want Ocasio-Cortez to succeed. I want to see strong progressive leaders who fight for socioeconomic equality and bring up policies that protect Americans’ right to chase life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. However, I do not think that, at least at this moment, she is in a position to represent Americans or even the Democratic Party. In such a politically hostile climate, it pains for me to see another political actor entering the scene and adding another layer of polarization. She had opportunities to pull in new voters and challenge opposing viewpoints, but it appears yet again that we are in our echo chambers and making assumptions about those outside.

Established liberal comedian and political commentator Bill Maher has made a career of pushing back at “political correctness” from his fellow progressives and peers. He, infamously, used a racial slur on air just last year and has been spouting clear Islamophobia under the guise of atheism for well over a decade. In our modern political climate, however, Maher has taken a new direction in pushing back against the left.
Maher frequently invites guests — such as Milo Yiannopoulos and Jordan Peterson — that are either part of the alt-right or are sometimes affiliated with the alt-right. Another common factor linking Yiannopoulos and Peterson is the resistance they have faced when speaking on college campuses. Maher takes particular issue with mass protests that prevent public figures from speaking at pre-arranged events at various universities; his go-to example is UC Berkeley, which, by Maher’s view, is consistent politically and administratively with every college campus in America. But while Maher likes to elevate these folks to an even greater public platform on his show than they would receive at any given university, he simultaneously plays into the hands of far-right extremists and bigots operating under the purported protections of free speech.
Maher finds common ground with figures like Yiannopoulos and especially Peterson on the issue of free speech, or perhaps more accurately, the ability of any given person to say whatever they want, no matter the harm they may do unto others. Maher’s favorite scapegoat is, of course, college students, especially the ones who stage protests at speaking events or take issue with jokes that are “politically incorrect.” (As an aside, Maher’s first show was called Politically Incorrect, which, incidentally, was canceled after Maher said something politically incorrect post-9/11.) So, even as a prominent liberal television personality, Maher’s opponents of choice appear to be his younger liberal peers.
What Maher misses in his criticism is key to understanding the disconnect between liberal intellectuals of his generation and younger, more progressive liberals. Maher hates the idea of “safe spaces,” first and foremost, but he does not actually understand their purpose or frequency. Safe spaces are intended to give students — especially those who are disadvantaged or marginalized — the physical space and time to unwind with those of similar backgrounds and experiences. They are meant to help build strength and patience for those of us whose patience has been worn thin by discrimination and injustice present in their everyday lives.
Moreover, safe spaces are not the be all and end all. Safe spaces allow people to re-enter regular, unfiltered dialogue about these issues with skills specifically meant to further these tough conversations. Practicing discussion or debriefing in a safe space actually furthers one’s capacity to handle and confront the ugly side of difficult social realities in their everyday lives or in the context of unfiltered dialogue with opposing or even hostile counterparts. They are not about avoiding tough issues, they are about learning how to deal with them in a smart, healthy way.
And yet, the reason Maher fails to understand safe spaces is far more complex. He is the product of a generation that, in many ways, is responsible for the social unrest that persists today. He may, in many cases, call out the problematic behaviors of those on the right or even be supportive of the marginalized and disadvantaged, but he is uncomfortable with the idea of a shifting conversation. Maher is scared of a major culture shift. The framework of the conversation, as he understands it, extends to tolerance, but not acceptance, and as a result, he remains inhibited in our modern dialogue. I, personally, am drawn to the “not that there’s anything wrong with it” joke from Seinfeld as reflective of Maher’s behavior. He may not take issue with the idea of gay people existing, for instance, but he does not want to view homosexuality as normal or serve as an ally. His understanding of what it means to be progressive is stagnant, and because he was on the cutting edge for so long, he refuses to confront the possibility that his beliefs may be dated.
So, instead, Maher turns to those on the far right for common ground, as the criticisms facing Maher and the extremist guests of his show become more and more similar. He will continue to defend his right, and the right of his traditional opponents – right-wing extremists and bigots – to say horrible, sexist, racist, transphobic things, and in the meantime, he will continue to elevate and indirectly legitimize the viewpoints of those whose beliefs he would have attacked vehemently even five years ago.
Maybe, truly, when he said the N-word on television last year, he held no sort of racial contempt in his heart. Even if that is the case, if even one bigot feels legitimized or justified in watching the show, is their much of a difference between Maher and the bigot? Some would say of course, but the impact will remain unchanged. This is why college students call for higher standards. This is why we protest when someone comes to our community spouting awful things. They may have the right to shout racial slurs and misogynistic curses and homophobic garbage, but college students have the right to fight back. We have the right to say, “that is not welcome in our community.” Because, if we allowed every intolerant person a platform and a microphone to let out every horrible thing that came to mind, we would be fighting each other constantly, and we would be too focused shutting down nonsense to actually help the people who need it most.

Picture this: it’s 2 a.m. and you’re scrolling through Instagram. Your best friend from home is grinning widely with his new girlfriend he met at rush. The girl who sits next to you in 3-D calc took an impromptu visit back home over the three-day weekend while you’re trying to map out how to juggle the assessments your professors conveniently saved for that weekend. Sure, you realize that nobody lives a perfect life and has their fair share of struggles, but it can get difficult to realize that the image that they present is not necessarily the full picture.
I don’t say this to sound like a grouchy suburban parent (no offense to suburban parents) who believes that technology is the downfall of this generation. I say this to remind first years that your college experience is just that: yours. It’s unique to you, and while you have people who share this journey with you, ultimately it is you paving the road ahead. It’s you who gets to have the ultimate say in what you want out of it.
That’s not to say you should completely put up your blinders and ignore the world around you. Of course, be cognizant of things like events, grades, and career fairs. However, do not expect college to be like high school. As cliche as it is, it’s true; you were a big fish in a small pond. In college; you’re one of many big fishes in a great lake. Sure, you didn’t go through high school effortlessly. You obviously fought tooth and nail to get to earn a spot at one of the most prestigious universities in the world. However, college is a different boss to defeat. Being at the top of the class, earning honors, and balancing several extracurricular activities won’t be a “duh” thing. That very balance might not even be attainable. Find something that works for you. This is easier for me to put these words on this page than is for you to actually go out and find it. It might take a while; I’m entering my third year and am still finessing my schedule. Some people find these well over graduation. Again, go at your own pace.
On the tangent of high school, some friendships can fray. Even after trying to keep in touch, relationships can end and “best friends forever” can falter. That doesn’t devalue the time you spent with them in the past. If that does happen, cherish the memories but let your heart and our mind open up for new ones. Good friends might not come your way immediately, but if you keep doing what you love (or, at least, trying to find it), they will come.
Don’t be afraid to reach out to friends. Again, another cliche, but you’d be surprised that the kid who sits next to you in lecture who seems to get whatever is being furiously scribbled on the chalkboard is just as clueless as you are. Happiness doesn’t always lie in certainty where the destination is in clear sight; sometimes, happiness lies in the process of fumbling in the dark. The journey may end up being more important than the ending. Have a goal, but don’t get tunnel vision to the extent that you cut out anything that lies between you and that ending.
“Self-care” isn’t self-indulgence; it’s responsibility. As hard as it is to find a well-balanced meal on campus, find something more nutritious than fries and Coke for lunch. Know where the University Health Services and Counseling and Psychological Services are and how to schedule an appointment. Learn how to contact Title IX and save the emergency phone numbers you got during O-Week in your phone. Don’t get sucked into believing that you need to cut sleep in order to be a good student (and on that tangent, caffeine is not a substitute for getting adequate sleep). Get some fresh air; living exclusively inside Gates without seeing the light of day isn’t healthy.
Chances are, you’ll hear the phrase “fun dies at Carnegie Mellon” at least once before you graduate. Sometimes, that phrase seems true (read: late-night sessions in the Underground, crying over 15-112, and eating an Ultimate Brownie). However, these upcoming four years will fly by just as quickly as the past four years have. Let yourself have bubble tea afternoons with friends. Rent a projector from Hunt and put on a cheesy movie. Give yourself something to look forward to. There’s so much waiting ahead.
