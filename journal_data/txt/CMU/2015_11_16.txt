Looking ready for championship season, the Carnegie Mellon women’s volleyball team hosted Marymount University in a battle to move on to the Eastern College Athletic Conference (ECAC) South Regional Championship semifinals on Wednesday Nov. 11. Overpowering an energetic attack from Marymount, the Tartans landed shots when it counted and secured a 3–1 victory to advance.
The Carnegie women were aided by clean play through the sets, keeping their shots in play and working to return some rocketing spikes from Marymount. As Marymount struggled to keep the ball in play under pressure, the Tartans stayed patient and let the opponents make the mistakes for many key points.
Faced with an aggressive attack from Marymount, defensive play by junior libero Molly Higgins was a huge part of the Tartan success. Calling on her team to “Close it down!” in the third set, Higgins held up for them in the back end, adding a one-handed dig for the highlight reel.
The team went down early, struggling at the start of the first set before putting things together and competing through the rest of the game.
The momentum shift came early, with the Tartans down 18–13 in the first set. With the team struggling to score points on the opposition, first-year outside hitter Sydney Bauer made her presence known with a kill down the middle of the defense sparking a run. The Tartans responded to her efforts and fought to close the gap to 22–21. Bauer finished what she had started, recording back–to–back aces off the Marymount defense to give the Tartans their first lead of the night.
Higgins said of the struggles, “I think what’s hard about playing teams that are out of your region is you don’t really know what to expect”. Even facing a team with a style different from what they were used to, the Tartans eventually figured out the new rhythm and got themselves on track.
The first set opened up with Marymount out ahead, picking up the first point of the game and building a lead up until the late set rally by Bauer got the Tartans back in it. Everything didn’t fall into place from there, as Carnegie Mellon fought through a long back and forth for the win, dropping match points at 25–24, 26–25, and 27–26. The team finally closed out the set on defense with a great block by Bauer and junior middle blocker Jackie Gibbons to get the win.
Carnegie Mellon came out firing in the second set, as a Bauer kill over the middle deflected out the back end to break a 4–4 tie. The team pressed, running up their lead to 12–4 in what looked like a runaway set. However, Marymount rallied back as the Tartans struggled to score again, tying the set at 17. Another push got the team back out ahead at set point, and this time it only took one try to capitalize, as first-year outside hitter Lauren Mueller blocked in a shot for a 25–22 win.
After a very back and forth second set, both teams came out with more even play in the third. With the exception of an early hole (9–14) for the Tartans about midway through the set, the teams stayed close. The gap was short–lived, as junior setter Emily Newton put up the ball on the right side of the net for first-year outside hitter Sarah Jurgens to smash it cross court to back left corner of the Marymount side.
Both teams stayed even late in the set with ties at 17, 18, and 19 before Marymount got out ahead. Down two, the Tartans made a final push with a Jurgens kill from the right off a Newton assist, but it wasn’t enough, as the Tartans dropped the set for the only time of the night, 23–25.
The fourth set went back and forth as well, with a seeming momentum shift in Marymount’s favor early, but Carnegie Mellon found a lead with a block by Mueller and sophomore middle blocker Eliza Donahue, going up 10–9. Another block by the same pair, followed by a block by Donahue and Jurgens, got the Tartans going, taking them ahead 16–11, a lead they would never relinquish.
As the Tartans looked to translate their lead to victory, the Marymount side showed their desperation, refusing to let a Tartan point fall to seal the game. On the final point of the game, Marymount played furiously in an endless point, keeping multiple game–ending spikes off the ground. Shots by Jurgens and Donahue never found home, as Marymount players kept the play going for minutes. Finally, the Tartans managed the dagger, as Bauer took a Newton assist and put the ball on the ground at the heart of the Marymount defense, right in the middle.
Throughout the affair, Carnegie Mellon put on a show of strength, staying positive and very focused in a competitive game. Other than a few missed shots early in the first set, the Tartans kept their shots on target, making the other team miss and playing a full competitive effort.
Higgins says the team will look to be on their “A–game 100 percent of the time”, taking the momentum from this game and going for a win in the ECAC South Regional Championship.
Unfortunately for the Tartans, that never came to fruition. After trading sets with Bethany on a way to a 3–2 victory, the Tartans dropped the finals 3–1 to Swarthmore, bringing a successful season to a premature ending.

The Carnegie Mellon football team played its season finale against Case Western Reserve on Saturday in the 30th annual Academic Bowl. With a share of the University Athletic Association (UAA) championship on the line for both teams, the Tartans ended up on top 52–42, bringing their record to 7–3 overall and ending the season on a six game winning streak during which they scored over 40 points in each game.
Though the weather was chilly and windy, the Tartan offense ignited quickly as sophomore running back Sam Benger burst for a 58-yard run. Senior quarterback Andrew Hearon capped off the opening drive with an 11-yard touchdown pass to sophomore wide receiver John Prather and put the Tartans up 7–0.
Case Western initially tried to counter with a long drive, but a holding penalty that negated a Case Western first down cut their drive short. On the Case Western punt, sophomore safety Drew Fitzmorris fumbled the punt, turning it over to Case Western at the goal line and leading to a touchdown run to tie up the game 7–7.
Though the early lead was quickly lost, the offense worked to reverse the sudden shift in momentum. Benger led the Tartans offense back into Case Western territory, but the field goal attempt by junior placekicker Gabe Renna flew wide left, turning the ball back over to the Spartans. On Case Western’s next possession, the running game generated plenty of positive yardage for the Spartans, but a tipped pass led to a fourth down attempt in which the Tartans defense covered everyone and allowed the offense to take over with good field position. On a play when Case Western showed a heavy blitz and instantly got to Hearon, the quarterback still got the ball out deep to senior wide receiver Graham Schilling, resulting in a touchdown to put the Tartans up 14–7.
On the next drive, a fumble by the Spartans negated a play that would have gotten them a first down, forcing Case Western to try a pass that fell incomplete, returning the ball to the Tartan offense. However, a Hearon pass flew into the hands of a Spartan defender who quickly dashed into the endzone and made the score 14–14. A few runs by Benger and one by Hearon took the Tartans close to Spartan territory as the first quarter came to a close.
Opening up the second quarter, Hearon threw another interception on third down, but a fumble forced by senior linebacker Nico Comsa and recovered by junior defensive end Brian Khoury gave the ball right back to Carnegie Mellon. The Tartan offense took advantage of its second chance, starting off with a 25-yard run by Benger. Hearon attempted two strikes into the endzone, with both passes falling incomplete. Hearon then scrambled for a first down, but a holding penalty brought the Tartans back to third and long. The penalty would not keep the Tartans down as Prather managed to haul in a long pass to keep the drive alive. Three Benger runs amounted to two yards, but the Tartans attempted a fourth down conversion, resulting in a touchdown pass to Schilling and putting the Tartans up 21–14.
The next drive for the Spartans started at the three-yard line after excellent kickoff coverage and an illegal block penalty. The pressure lasted only one play as a long pass got Case Western out of a dangerous situation. However, a sack by senior defensive tackle Marcus Anthony forced another fumble, recovered by sophomore outside linebacker Kyle Brittain. The Tartan drive started with a fumble by Hearon, but Benger kept the ball in the hands of the offense. Undaunted by the fumble, Hearon took the next play himself, setting up third and short. After an overthrown ball, the Tartans decided to go for it on fourth down. Though Hearon managed to scramble for a first down, a holding penalty negated the positive yardage, forcing the Tartans to punt.
After placing Case Western at the four yard line, the Spartans managed to get off their goal after a blown coverage. However, the Tartans defense was able to stop a Spartan run on fourth and short, giving the offense another drive with very good starting position. With another fourth down and short for the offense, the Spartan defense thought they had stopped Benger at the middle of the field, but Hearon fooled everyone by taking it himself to the outside on a 15-yard touchdown run that put the Tartans up 28–14.
The Spartans started to drive down the field on the next series with several long completions, getting down to the Tartans goal line before the Spartan quarterback took it in himself and making the score 28–20 as the Tartans blocked the extra point attempt. After the kickoff flew out of bounds, the Tartans came out rushing despite having less than two minutes remaining in the half. Though the Tartans managed to get close to another score, a personal foul penalty forced the Tartans to try a field goal that just fell short.
The second half opened up with the Spartans driving down the field before Comsa intercepted a pass that gave the Tartans the ball in Spartan territory.
A pass interference penalty kept the Tartans’ drive alive, and though a personal foul penalty put the Tartans in a tough spot, Hearon was able to make another strike to Schilling and put the Tartans up 35–20.
The Spartan offense, however, brought the ball back down to Tartans’ territory, and a blown coverage gave a touchdown to Case Western, making the score 35–27 Carnegie Mellon.
The Tartans bounced right back, driving to the Spartan redzone with a balance of passes and runs before Schilling recorded his fourth touchdown of the game and got the Tartans up 42–27. A facemask penalty on the kickoff gave the Spartans great position, and a deep pass that got Case Western to the goal line led to a short touchdown run, closing the gap to 42–34. On the next drive, what looked like a sack for Case Western turned into a long scramble by Hearon. After missing a shot to junior halfback Zach Cree, a sack on Hearon forced the Tartans to punt. The Tartans defense, however, managed to force a three and out on Case Western, and Fitzmorris managed to get a good punt return before a penalty brought it back 15 yards. Benger recovered that yardage on the next play to close out the third quarter.
At the start of the fourth quarter, a holding penalty was rendered irrelevant as Benger recovered more than the penalty yardage, continuing to run through Case Western’s defense. In the last play of the drive, Benger fought through a number of Spartan defenders before getting into the endzone and putting the Tartans up 49–34. The ensuing kickoff return got the Spartans close to midfield to open their next drive, but the Tartan defense forced another three and out. The next drive saw the Tartans begin to run the clock down as they fed Benger the ball quite a number of times before punting the ball away. The Spartans began driving the ball downfield toward the goal line, and the Spartans managed to complete a fourth down touchdown pass. Case Western made the two point conversion, bringing the score to 49–42 and putting the pressure back on the Carnegie Mellon offense.
The offense, however, proved to be more than capable of handling the pressure.
On the first play of the drive, Benger looked like he might have been tackled immediately, but he pushed through and earned a first down. After a few more runs, Hearon threw deep to Schilling and got the Tartans down to Case Western’s 30-yard line. Benger’s runs continued to keep the Tartans offense on the field and ate up all of the Spartans’ timeouts. Hearon tried to get a game-sealing touchdown to Schilling, but the incompletion forced the Tartans to try for a field goal, which put the Tartans up 52–42. The Spartans took advantage of a Tartan pass interference penalty on the next drive to get down the field, but failed to score on fourth and goal, sealing the Tartans’ victory.
The win marks the first time since 2006 that Carnegie Mellon defeated Case Western and the first time the Tartans beat a top 25 ranked football team since the official Division III polling began in 2003. “The win feels amazing,” Schilling said after the game. His career-best 207 receiving yards and four receiving touchdowns highlighted the offensive effort that has earned the Tartans the UAA co-championship with Washington University in St. Louis. Though the Tartans started the season 1–3, they managed to finish strong over the past six games.
“We all just believed in ourselves. We had some tough games early on, but we knew we had a great team.” In particular, Schilling considered the offensive linemen the critical component of the offense’s superb performances.
With the regular season now concluded, the Tartans look ahead to postseason opportunities like the Eastern College Athletic Conference (ECAC) 2015 Division III Bowl Championships.

The Carnegie Mellon women’s basketball team took to the court for the first time this season on Friday night to face off against the Washington and Jefferson Presidents. The Tartans ultimately emerged victorious with a score of 95–63, due in large part to the efforts of D3hoops.com All-American honoree junior Lisa Murphy, who also became the tenth Tartan to score a thousand career points, ending the game with a total of 33, the most of four Tartans who scored in double digits on Friday.
The Tartans established dominance quickly, opening the game with an impressive 11–0 run during the first three and a half minutes. The Presidents slightly reduced this lead toward the end of the first quarter, but the Tartans went into the first break with strong scores from both Murphy and junior Jackie Hudepohl, putting the Tartans up 22–12 heading into the second.
Carnegie Mellon again opened with multiple unanswered scores in the second quarter, gaining a 32–12 advantage as sophomore Zoe Zawisa and senior Liza Otto made some impressive shots against the Washington and Jefferson defense.
Otto led scoring in the second quarter with seven points, and the Tartans went into the half comfortably up 47–26.
The key to the Tartans first half success came in their rebounding ability, pulling down almost twice the boards of the Presidents, which transitioned into the Tartans completing twice the percentage of shots of the Presidents, with Washington and Jefferson scoring only on 24.4 percent of their shots, while the Tartans scored on 48.6 percent of their attempts.
The third quarter saw Carnegie Mellon’s dominance continue as they maintained the nearly twenty point lead that they had established earlier in the game. Murphy shined here, scoring ten of the Tartan’s 18 total points in the period, and went into the final section of the game just nine points shy of her 1000 point record.
While the Tartans continued to shut down the Presidents in the fourth quarter, Murphy was focused on her goal. She finally reached it with just under four minutes left in play, with a set of back–to–back layups, the second of which gave her 33 points on the night and 1001 points total on her career.
These scores also put the Tartans up 84–56, and the hope for the Presidents to get back into the game seemed to be gone.
The Tartans showed no mercy, however. They went on to score another eleven points in the final three minutes of the game, notably with a beautiful three pointer as well as a clean jump shot from sophomore Madison Watson. These scores were also the first of her career due to sitting out her freshman season because of an injury. The Tartans closed out the game with a score line of 95–63.
In total, the Tartans shot 54.1 percent from the floor and managed to out rebound the Presidents by 18 boards, 55–38. While Murphy led all Tartans scorers with 33 points, she also pulled down 11 rebounds, earning herself a double–double for the 26th time in her career. Other Tartans joining her in double–digit scoring were Otto and Hudepohl, each with 14 points, as well as sophomore Anna Novak with 10.
The Tartans women’s basketball team will take to the court again on Friday, Nov. 20 against Muskingum University at the Allegheny College Tip–Off tournament at 4 p.m. The Tartans will look to continue their strong start to the season on the shoulders of their All–American, and with cohesive team play that is sure to propel them forward in the standings.

The Carnegie Mellon women’s soccer team took on Cabrini College in the first round of the 2015 NCAA Division III Women’s Soccer Championship on Saturday. A defensive battle in the first half gave way to an onslaught of scores in the second as the Tartans took the game 5–0, advancing the Tartans to the next game and tying a school record for wins with an overall 16–1–1 season record.
The first half of play featured both teams treading cautiously, testing their respective defenses. The Tartan offense was the first to strike. In the 29th minute, sophomore forward Sienna Stritter sent a pass from junior defender Samantha Smith high from close to midfield, capitalizing on an uncovered goal and putting the Tartans up 1–0. The Tartans kept up the pressure against Cabrini, quickly getting a corner kick and some deep throw-ins. The first half came to a close without much Cabrini pressure on the Tartan defense.
In the second half, the Tartans attempted several shots to open up and keep Cabrini from getting a chance to score. The continued pressure eventually led to Stritter’s second goal of the game and fifth goal of the season as she drove a ball that bounced off of the goalie’s hands into the net in the 49th minute. A free kick off a foul nearly ended up in the net again, but Cabrini was able to get the ball out of bounds and keep the Tartans from doing anything with the ensuing corner kick. In the 68th minute, senior forward Alli Mcugan’s continued pressure on Cabrini’s defense resulted in a goal after receiving a pass from sophomore midfielder Morgan Kontor. Sophomore midfielder Nicole Winegardner scored the Tartans’ fourth goal of the night off of a pass from junior forward Megan Bartoshuk in the 80th minute. In the 82nd minute, Winegardner scored once more for the Tartans with an assist from Bartoshuk, bringing the game to 5–0.
“It was great to get a win in front of our fans,” Stritter said after the game. The win marked the Tartans’ eleventh shutout of the season, largely driven by the offensive pressure as junior goalkeeper Katie Liston only needed to make one formal save. Stritter acknowledged that the goal differential was unexpected but was pleased that the offense was able to drive the game. “We have such a great backline. To put away one goal is important. We were on a roll today.”
On Sunday, the Tartans took on SUNY Oneonta. This game featured an intensely defensive battle with Liston and both Oneonta goalies saving quite a number of shots during regulation. As overtime began, a Carnegie Mellon foul gave Oneonta a chance to win on a free kick, but Liston was there to save the shot. The Tartans then quickly maneuvered the ball down the field, and in the 92nd minute, Stritter fielded a pass from sophomore midfielder Haili Adams, broke past the defenders near the goalkeeper’s box, took one touch around the right side of the keeper, and scored for the Tartans.
The Tartans will advance to sectionals and take on Calvin College.

Researchers at Carnegie Mellon University, including Gierad Laput, a third-year doctoral student in human-computer interaction, have developed a new technique, called EM-Sense, that can detect whether a person is in contact with an electrical or electromechanical object and then identify the object. This technique, when incorporated into smartwatches, could provide more information about the user’s activities than current technology, thus making the user-experience more personalized and accurate.
The technology utilizes a sensor in your smartwatch that detects the object that you are touching. The EM-Sense technology works on the principle that every electrical or electromechanical object — for example iPads, electric toothbrushes, electric drills, and printers — emits electromagnetic noise, a unique signal in the radio frequency range that can be used to uniquely identify an object. Different types of objects have unique electromagnetic signatures, and when an object is touched, those signals flow through the body and can be picked up by the sensor in the smartwatch. The smartwatch is in contact with your skin, which detects and matches the signal to its specific object. Although signals emitted by the same objects are the same, pairing mechanisms can be applied to differentiate between two objects of the same type. This technology can also be extended to large metallic objects like ladders. Being metallic, such objects absorb the electromagnetic noise from the other objects around them, which allows a unique signal to be detected by the watch when they are touched, depending on their surroundings.
The data obtained using this technology in a smartwatch can be used to develop context-aware apps. Such an app would use the information that it receives to plan out and suggest activities to the user. As demonstrated in a video released by Disney entitled, “EM-Sense: Touch Recognition of Uninstrumented Electrical and Electromechanical Objects,” the EM-Sense technology could be used to augment activities throughout the day. The video shows that the smartwatch could record data when a user steps on a scale and display it in relation to previous data, or start a timer when the user begins using an electronic toothbrush, or remind the user about appointments and meetings as soon as they touch the handle of the door to their office. This technology could be future of smartwatches, making them smarter than ever.
When asked about the future plans for the project, Laput said, “[In the future], we’d be happy if giant manufacturers pick the project up. It’s a patent-pending project, so if a large company could integrate this into existing technology, we’d love to see it out there in the real world.”
As of now, the technology is limited to electromagnetic objects. The next step in the project is to detect objects that don’t emit electromagnetic noise, like wooden, plastic, or cloth objects. The detection of objects that don’t emit electromagnetic noise is, in fact, the next research problem that Laput may be working on.
On collaborating with Disney, Laput said that “Disney is an awesome place. We are basically Imagineers, so we just imagine. We figure out cool things that can enhance people’s experiences. And I think that’s a very fun agenda.”
Along with Gierad Laput, the research team is comprised of Alanson Sample, a research scientist at Disney; Jack Yang, also from Disney; Chris Harrison, assistant professor of human-computer interaction; and Robert Xiao, a Ph.D. student in HCII. The researchers discussed the EM-Sense technology at the User Interface Software and Technology Symposium, which was hosted in Charlotte, North Carolina on Nov. 8–11, at which the research team’s talk won the “Best Talk Award.” “We did live demos and people really enjoyed it. People loved it,” Laput said.
As technology becomes a larger part of human life, the study of human-computer interaction becomes increasingly relevant and important. Laput emphasized this importance of research in this area, saying that researchers today are beginning to understand that “focusing on the human as opposed to just focusing just on the algorithms is actually a problem worth solving.”

Imagine a world where we could make any object we wanted, almost instantly, any time. That is the bold future imagined by Stefanie Mueller, a PhD student at the Hasso Plattner Institute in Potsdam, Germany. Mueller shared her research in a stimulating lecture this past Friday at Carnegie Mellon. Her work is aimed at improving how people interact with personal fabrication devices such as 3-D printers and laser cutters. She believes that through the development of more intuitive devices that provide quicker feedback to a user’s input, we may reach a point in the future where we can use the power of these machines to make any type of object we desire.
Recent years have seen a huge growth in accessibility to 3-D printers and similar personal fabrication devices. According to Forbes, the market for 3-D printing grew to $4.1 billion, growing over $1 billion in 2014 alone. Mueller partially credits this immense recent growth to the expiration of 3-D printer patents. This allows others to use and further develop this technology. She said that many of these patents were established in the late 1980s and held by large companies. With new-found freedom, innovators have envisioned bringing this technology to the general public.
While many predictions point to continued, exponential growth for this market, Mueller warned us that we cannot ignore the possibility of an alternate future where this technology begins to grow, but then fades due to lack of accessibility to the general consumer. Currently, the majority of 3-D printing software is targeted toward industry professionals who have years and years of training. Even for skilled users, the interaction with the machine is not intuitive because users do not receive immediate responses to their input. This is mainly because modern machines are exceptionally slow and may have to be left overnight to complete building an object.
Mueller compared the problems personalized fabrication faces to the those faced by personal computing many decades ago. Early computers were very complicated to use: sometimes requiring punching holes in cards, inserting them into the machine, and waiting overnight for the computer to compute the results. Since then, many of the problems have been addressed, as evidenced by the personal computers we carry around today. Mueller hopes that following a similar model, we will be able to elevate personalized fabrication technologies and make them ubiquitous.
The largest challenge to this goal, however, is how we will be able manipulate matter in a manner that is fast, reliable, and depicts the user’s vision for the object. Mueller has focused much of her research on addressing this challenge, and she showed videos of her team’s developments during her talk. The first example was of a laser cutter that cuts a variety of materials from wood, cardboard, and plastics. A piece of glass separates the user from the laser and the material, but the user can use a variety of laser tools in the form of a pen to mark locations where the machine should cut or move. The user can almost act as if they are drawing using a pen on the glass and the machine will move, almost instantly, in response to their actions. This is an example of speeding up the feedback between user input and the visualization of the resulting changes.
Mueller and her team took this idea one step further, wanting to explore whether or not they could push their technology from 2-D actions to 3-D actions. Using techniques and ideas from origami, they developed a machine that, instead of cutting at a desired position, would generate a fold of a specific angle or design. The laser would heat the material to a point where it would bend with the force of gravity but not break. Mueller showed an impressive video of a user making a plastic pot within minutes using technology created by her team.
In a separate realm of her research, Mueller and her team focused on improving the user experience with 3-D printers. One current problem with 3-D printers is that a user can use software to model his design, but a 3-D printer must work overnight or for a few hours before a product is produced. Thus, the user must envision the impact of any desired changes ahead of time. To speed up this feedback loop, the team invented a method of printing a wire-frame model based on the actual object the user wants to create.
Wire-frame objects are veritable skeletons, like a structural model of the object itself. The wire-frame technology required the development of a new method of dispensing the plastic in a vertical fashion without the plastic bending over itself. Mueller showed a video of a construction of the wire-frame model of a bottle whose creation took only 14 minutes, compared to over three hours for the complete model. With this model, the user can see the results of the changes he wants to make more quickly, which shortens the feedback loop.
These technologies are still developing, but Mueller encouraged her crowd that by improving these personal fabrication technologies using the approaches her team has devised, we may eventually approach a future of instant fabrication. Another area of Mueller’s research is to explore ways of improving sustainability, because an inevitable impact of instant fabrication is an increase in the number of objects produced and the amount of materials that become discarded as trash. If a 3-D printed object breaks or becomes outdated, a user would just throw out the old object and print a new one. The team’s idea involves scanning a 3-D object, and using computer software to instruct the 3-D printer to modify the existing object.
Mueller showed an example of a 3-D printed phone case that could no longer be used, since the user bought the new model of the phone. Using the 3-D printer, she scanned the phone case, instructed the printer to make design changes relevant to the new model, and was able to transform her old unusable object into a modified, relevant object.
The potential of the approaches Mueller explained and depicted in her research could lead to an evolution of technology that revamps the way we use personal fabrication technologies, ultimately changing the way we create and interact with objects around us.

Continuing our discussion from last week about technical automation, Pugwash heard from Laurence Ales, an assistant professor of economics at Carnegie Mellon University, regarding the effects of automation on job loss.
Ales began his talk by laying out two stories that are often told by the media regarding automation. The first is that modern automation will take all our jobs as humans become obsolete in comparison to robots. The second is that although the market has responded to automation in the past, this time is different.
After putting the two media narratives on the table for us to think about, Ales gave a brief history of past technological changes and their impacts on the market. Technological change has been happening throughout human history, moving the labor force from artisans, to factory laborers, to service workers. At each transition, some jobs were lost, but other positions opened up to replace them.
Looking at the first concern that arises, regarding the idea of humans becoming obsolete or running out of jobs, Ales cautioned us to not only look at jobs lost, but also jobs gained.
If autonomous vehicles or drones take over the transportation and delivery sectors, then of course people who are currently delivering pizzas will be out of jobs. However, that’s just the first step. If robots provide such an advantage, pizza might get cheaper, encouraging more people to buy it. This necessitates more pizza cooks, more receptionists to take orders, and more managers to organize it all. Similarly, it means more drones doing delivery, which could mean a drone repair shop opening up down the street.
Although automation reduces some jobs, Ales wanted to make it clear that it will open up new opportunities in other areas. Humans will always have a competitive advantage in something, relative to machines or robots, and those areas are where jobs will open up.
The second concern, however, is that modern automation is somehow different from automation in the past. Maybe it’s the pace of the automation, or which jobs are being replaced, or even who’s making how much money.
It’s true, Ales said, that the jobs being replaced now, or the jobs that will be replaced in the near future, are different than prior jobs. The last major industrial shift saw a decline in factory laborers due to a transition towards service jobs, and now it’s those service jobs, among other industries like transportation, that are being targeted.
Despite the prevalence of technology, however, there are still plenty of areas in which humans have an advantage over machines. Maybe they can deliver pizzas and drive cars, but they still don’t make very good janitors or economics professors. And the robots in use aren’t being repaired by other robots, or at least not yet.
In looking at inequality, Ales thinks there might be something to worry about. The wealth gap has been increasing since the 1970s. This is possibly due in part to the fact that the jobs being replaced are mid-level jobs involving semi-skilled work, and the new jobs being created are on either end of the spectrum.
Ales next addressed the question of policy. If automation takes away some jobs, while at the same time opening up new ones, and the wealth gap is increasing, what are some policy solutions that could address these issues?
First, to help workers who are in danger of being replaced, we should make it easier to transfer from one sector to another. Find which industries are losing jobs, and provide incentive for workers to switch to similar industries that aren’t being replaced. At the same time, make sure to support people who want to go into careers that are seeing growth. Easing transitions from one career to another would make workers more agile and able to respond to automation.
Secondly, Ales argued that to address the income disparity, taxes should be raised on the wealthy instead of raising the minimum wage. Providing a higher minimum income would only encourage workers to stay in dying industries, according to Ales. Instead of doing that, the government should tax the wealthy and use that money to provide re-training for workers to find an industry that is growing instead of shrinking.
The talk by Ales was followed by a question and answer session. One question that came up was while Ales’ talk applied mostly to the United States and other developed countries, what about nations like Mexico or China? Also, what would happen when robots eventually have all competitive advantage over humans? Perhaps most importantly, will economists’ policy advice be heeded by those in charge?
While Ales had some answers, other questions are still up for grabs. “Get back to me in a year,” he laughed when asked about his current research. However, Ales was clear that as far as we know, the current wave of automation doesn’t mean the end of the world as we know it, as many claim.

Since the invention of gunpowder, chemical reactions have fueled a plethora of weaponry. None, however, have exhibited effects as deadly or as lasting as the atomic bomb, which was used for the first and only time during World War II when the United States dropped atomic bombs Little Boy and Fat Man on Hiroshima and Nagasaki, Japan, respectively. Although no atomic weapons have been used to date since, the threat they pose stems from their enormous chemical potency.
To start, we must understand what an atom is and what it is made of. According to atomic theory, an atom is the most basic unit of a chemical element. All of the matter around us is composed of atoms, each of which are made of up protons, neutrons, and electrons. Within an atom, protons and neutrons sit at the center in a ball called the nucleus, and electrons orbit around this nucleus in an electron cloud. The attractive bonds between the positive charge of the protons and the negative charge of the electrons are what provide the energy to hold an atom together; neutrons exhibit no charge and merely contribute mass to the atom.
Despite how trivial this atomic model may seem now, during the 20th century it was new to scientists. Once this model was discovered, though, scientists began experimenting with the atom to determine if its nuclear energy could be harnessed. It wasn’t until 1938, when scientists Otto Hahn and Fritz Strassmann split an atom through a process called nuclear fission, that the atomic bomb became a real possibility.
During nuclear fission, a single atom of a given element splits into two or more smaller daughter atoms of new elements; for example, a uranium atom can split into krypton and barium atoms. Because splitting an atom causes its inner attractive bonds to break, some of the chemical energy stored in them gets released. Additionally, although the number of protons and electrons doesn’t change between mother atom and daughter atoms, during nuclear fission a few neutrons shoot out and are lost from the mother atom.
The ejection of these neutrons is crucial for an atomic bomb powered by nuclear fission. When designing an atomic fission bomb, scientists use elements like uranium which have unstable atomic properties, making it difficult for atoms of that element to hold themselves together. Due to this instability, a uranium atom only needs a small aggravation to undergo nuclear fission and form more stable daughter atoms. In the process of doing so, however, this single uranium atom ejects several neutrons, each of which in turn collides with other unstable uranium atoms and causes these atoms to undergo nuclear fission.
The result is a cascading chain reaction of uranium atoms splitting, with each successive chain generating a greater number of ejected neutrons and thus a greater number of uranium atoms splitting apart. Each of these fission reactions releases a discrete amount of energy, which accumulates to deliver an explosion equivalent to, in the case of Fat Man, thirty two million pounds of TNT. In order for the chain reaction to sustain itself and generate an amount of energy this large, there must be a minimum mass of uranium present called the critical mass; if the critical mass of uranium is not present in an explosion, not enough neutrons will be ejected by uranium atoms, and the cascade will fizzle.
One of the dangers with accumulating the critical mass of an unstable element such as uranium is that with more mass present, there is higher chance of a single atom being aggravated and spontaneously initiating premature detonation. During World War II, scientists circumvented this issue by engineering a vessel that could hold two subcritical masses of uranium apart from each other, decreasing the likelihood of an atomic explosion being spontaneously triggered.
In order to ensure that these subcritical masses come together and have an appropriate amount of time to react, scientists place explosives behind one of the masses that will detonate based on a pressure sensor. The sensor is designed such that when an atomic bomb is dropped from a high altitude, the sensor will trigger the explosives once it reads an atmospheric pressure corresponding to the altitude above the ground required for optimal uranium detonation.
The atomic bomb was the first nuclear weapon scientists and engineers developed and, since World War II, more powerful bombs such as the hydrogen bomb have emerged. Although they rely on different mechanisms, they still follow the same recipe of extracting nuclear energy from atoms.
Thankfully, atomic energy has evolved to be used in more peaceful applications, such as power generation via nuclear reactors, but the discovery of nuclear energy is rooted in the development of a weapon of mass destruction. With the proliferation of atomic weapons in the world today, it is easy to glance over the devastating impact an atomic bomb can have on a region; Hiroshima and Nagasaki are still recovering today from atomic explosions that occurred nearly seventy years ago. Understanding the sheer power and severity of using one of these weapons can lead to more educated decisions concerning nuclear warfare policy both in America and abroad.

Ant colonies model the response of the nervous system
This week, researchers from the University of Bristol, England published a study in the journal PLOS ONE that examined migrating ant colonies’ collective responses to perceived threats. Researchers simulated predator attacks by plucking certain ants from their environments. When researchers plucked “scout” ants from the colony’s periphery, the perceived threat caused the rest of the ants to pull back into the nest for safety. When worker ants were plucked from the nest itself, the colony fled and sought shelter elsewhere as a unit.
The authors believe their research suggests a parallel between the ants’ environmental sensitivity and the nervous system of single organisms. They suggest that the nervous system responds to cell damage via pain just as ant colonies respond to colonial damage, through group awareness. This new research could provide a new way of thinking about nervous system damage and repair.

Eyedrops with potential to treat cataracts created
Cataracts, a clouding of the clear lens within an eye, are the leading cause of blindness all over the world, affecting nearly 20 million people worldwide. A team of researchers from the University of California San Francisco, the University of Michigan, and Washington University in St. Louis have identified a compound which is soluble enough to constitute the basis of eye-drop medication for cataracts. Cataracts are usually removed with surgery, so an eye-drop form would be revolutionary for treatment the world over. The proposed eye-drops will function by preventing maintenance proteins within the eye, crystallins, from clumping to form cataracts. Crystallins are an essential component of the eye’s lens, tasked with maintaining the transparency and flexibility of the lens’s fiber cells, the components of our eyes’ lenses. The research could also provide insight into the study of nervous system diseases such as Alzheimer’s, Parkinson’s, and Huntington’s diseases, which involve similar protein aggregates.

Uncovered Maya village Ceren yields social histories
In 1978, an El Salvadorian Maya village known as Ceren was discovered, preserved in amazingly precise condition by the ash cloud of a volcanic eruption that occurred approximately 1400 years prior.
Continuing studies of Ceren have allowed archaeologists to hypothesize about the social relationships between citizens. The shadows of villagers, left behind in garden footprints and finger swipes on pottery, as well as evidence of thatching, weaving, and agricultural skills, have led to a colorful posthumous image of this civilization. Ceren appears to have been a free-range society, offering “virtually no influence and certainly no control by the [Maya] elites.” It appears the only contact the individuals would have had with the Maya elite was in public marketplace transactions in El Salvador’s Zapotitan Valley, and even this contact appears to have been  minimal and non-essential for most people.

Scientists discover multitude of uses for decaying wood
Dead wood is not dead weight. A living tree is one organism within a forest, but a dead tree is an ecosystem all its own, says Mark Harmon, a biologist at Oregon State University. While a living tree sustains only itself, a dead tree becomes a host for insects, fungi, bacteria, and many other living things. Harmon is one of several researchers who is helping with a 200-year-long study on the decomposition of trees. Their research shows that since logs take a long time to decompose, they create a stable living space for other organisms. The organisms aid in the tree’s decomposition process in many ways: beetles track fungal spores into the log’s interior, and the fungi grow and use the tough bits of the wood as sustenance. Decomposition depends not only on the kind of tree itself, but all of the other organisms which take up residents within it. This research will allow forestry units to better understand the work they do within forest ecosystems.

New research suggests babies are judgmental
Research supported by the National Science Foundation’s Social, Behavioral, and Economic Sciences Directorate has shown that babies are judgmental. 
Babies have many different sociological preferences. They have been observed to prefer people who look like them and who speak the same language. Babies tend to be drawn to social people, disliking those who are antisocial. There is also some evidence that babies can prefer people who mistreat others, so long as the mistreated individuals do not share the child’s food preferences. This suggests that babies behave with the mentality of “the enemy of my enemy is my friend.” 
This research shows that infants develop certain social biases early on, associating themselves with those with similar qualities and distancing themselves from those who are different. This research provides further insight into the way babies develop social skills.

Gene editing used in treatment of leukemia
Doctors’ toolkits are expanding into the molecular realm as gene splicing becomes practical treatment. Doctors from the Great Ormond Street Hospital in London recently announced their use of modified immune cells in treatment of a one year-old girl’s leukemia.
Using molecular surgery tools known as TALENs and CRISPRs, doctors are effectively editing patients’ DNA. CRISPRs are RNA molecules which guide Cas9 enzymes to a certain spot on the DNA. The Cas9 then snips the DNA in that specific place. TALENs are enzymes which cut the DNA strands themselves. 
In the case of Layla, the one year-old child treated with this technology, researchers used TALENs to engineer immune cells known as T cells, which were able to distinguish between her own body’s cells and invaders. Since then she has had a bone-marrow transplant and is currently cancer free.

Comedian Nathan Fielder — marked by an amiable awkwardness, prematurely graying hair, and a monotone voice — came to McConomy Auditorium last Monday to show an unreleased episode of his Comedy Central series, Nathan for You.
Fielder, who came to Carnegie Mellon at the behest of the Activities Board, came onto the stage singing a decidedly tone-deaf version of Lana del Rey’s “Born to Die.” Fielder committed to the song, continuing his serenade long after it became crushingly awkward. Awkwardness, however, is part of the comedian’s charm, and he used it effectively throughout the night.
Nathan for You, currently in its second season, is a show about helping people. Fielder finds small businesses that have a problem and offers to solve it as creatively as he can. In the episode he screened on Monday, for example, he visited a bar in Southern California that lost much of its clientele after smoking became illegal indoors.
Fielder pored over the law and found a loophole: Smoking is allowed indoors if it is an intrinsic part of a theatrical performance. After installing a few theater seats in the back corner of the bar, Fielder premiered Smokers Allowed, a “slice of life” play about the patrons of the bar. The episode drew laughs from the almost-full auditorium; Fielder transformed the bar into an actual play and trained actors to replicate that first night of “Smokers Allowed.”
Fielder’s comedy comes from a bluntness that catches you off guard; he was strikingly candid throughout the evening. After he screened the first episode, he took questions from the audience. Before taking someone’s question, however, he invited the student asking it up to the stage, where he got to know him or her on a personal level.
Fielder started the conversation with the first student by asking him how he decides what to wear, and then asking, “Do you work out a lot, or is that just fat?” The student responded that it was, in fact, just fat, to laughs from the audience. Fielder asked the next audience member, a first-year woman, what her friends talk about when guys aren’t around. They talked, the student answered, “about dicks.” More specifically, they talked about “girth.”
After taking questions, Fielder showed one more episode of Nathan for You. In this one, Fielder went to a hotel to solve a problem endemic to family vacations: How can parents still enjoy their vacation (by having sex) while sharing a hotel room with their small child?
Fielder solved the problem by building a soundproof box — painted to look like a rocketship, for maximum fun — that a small child could hang out in while his parents made love. The episode had me laughing until I was gasping when Fielder tested the device by putting an eight year old in the box, and then testing how soundproof it was by hiring porn stars to have an all-out orgy in the room. Luckily, the box worked, and the eight-year-old boy heard nothing.
Fielder put on a good performance Monday night, and watching a couple of episodes of Nathan for You was enough to make me want to see more. Although Fielder relies on comedic tropes that are commonplace in recent-day stand-up — he plays almost perfectly into the skinny, awkward, white guy trope set by comedians like Daniel Tosh and Demetri Martin — he is genuine in a way that few other comedians are.

Last Friday and Saturday, Scotch ‘n’ Soda’s sketch comedy group Tisbert premiered their Fall show — “TisTalks.” The hour-long show was entirely student-written, produced, directed, and of course performed. I was impressed by the list of ten-plus student writers in particular, which left me wondering who wrote what and how the collaboration process worked. As you might guess from the title, the gimmick of TisTalks was Ted Talks, the nonprofit and global phenomenon devoted to “ideas worth spreading.” When the lights went down in Porter Hall 100, the half-full audience broke into cheers, excited for what was to come.
The show began with a slideshow — a masterpiece of Windows Movie Maker, no doubt — featuring stock photos of flowers and promising inspiring talks on “your ex,” “why are the bees disappearing?” and “things.” Apart from the projector, which would make several memorable appearances, the other Ted Talk staple was a series of lecture-style monologues every few sketches, one for each of the five performers. These were generally a refreshing way to break up the sketches and prepare the audience for more.
The show’s use of props (especially the projector) could only be called minimalist, which worked surprisingly well. The best jokes were able to shine through without fluffy distractions, and the few props that were used formed the centerpiece of their own sketches. Incidentally, my favorite monologue — and undeclared first-year in the College of Engineering Grant Seastream’s best performance of the night — was a TisTalk from the founder of a German design company that constructs everything out of cardboard boxes. The secret of their building material is so well kept that you’ve never heard of the company, and that’s the way they like it. Seastream demonstrated some of the company’s designs with his own cardboard box, which became a glove when he stuck his hands in it, a hat when he put it on his head and, when he stepped into it, a “small boat.” He displayed more complicated designs on the projector, including an image of a struggling neighborhood his company had totally rebuilt — again, with cardboard boxes.
I’ll admit that the first monologue — a female Fortune 500 CEO telling the long-winded, nonsensical tale of how she got there — was fairly underwhelming. The “parents meet the girlfriend” sketch that followed it was downright cringe-worthy. I’m sure plenty of rednecks would’ve taken offense at electrical and computer engineering masters student Darrin Willis’s over-the-top “Prospector Betty,” who walked like she had a horse between her legs and proudly asserted to her boyfriend’s posh parents that she was a gold-digger, just not in the way they feared. This sketch was too dependent on played-out “hick” stereotypes and, in the end, not all that funny.
After a fairly disappointing start, the quality of the sketches improved and hovered at a consistently entertaining level through the rest of the show. A sketch lives and dies on its seed premise, so it makes sense that the show was often hit or miss. Sketch comedy often is. The weakest were those that relied too heavily on crass, obvious humor, such as a sketch where the whole joke was a professor with a lisp and another where a family game of charades was ruined by the older brother’s sexual interpretations of supposedly “innocent” clues (“That’s f***ing! That’s obviously f***ing! I’m done!”; “That’s inappropriate, Timmy! Your sister is obviously acting out The Lion King!”).
Meanwhile, the best sketches of the night were clever, simple ideas colored in with details and dragged out to their highest potential for absurdity. Both of my favorites featured senior business major Mya Snyder, the only woman in the cast, who consistently developed unique, convincing characters. The first was the “Never Have I Ever” championship between the most inexperienced shut-ins of the world: Snyder’s wiggly-fingered, crazy-eyed incumbent; undeclared Dietrich first year Philip DeCicco’s love, peace, and flowers cult member; and Willis, a stone-faced sociopath who “literally lives under a rock.” The “why hasn’t anyone thought of this” premise and strong characters (DeCicco and Willis’s strongest) made this sketch, which — predictably — ended with Willis’s character viciously taking Snyder down (“Never have I ever won the ‘never have I ever’ championship”). Another memorable sketch featured the mugging of that eerily familiar pretentious hipster whom you’d be kind of happy to see mugged, again played by Snyder. David Frank’s best moment arrived in the “Feelin’ the Burn with Bernie” sketch. I’d never before known how much I wanted to see our presidential candidates go head to head via ‘80s-style workout videos.
Despite a few misses, TisTalks was an entertaining hour of student-run and written sketch comedy. The cast members fully dedicated themselves to even the weaker spots of writing, and I was reminded how funny collaboration and a lot of enthusiasm can be.
Correction: An earlier version of this article incorrectly referred to masters in electrical and computer engineering student Darrin Willis as "Wilson."

I didn’t walk into a Bo Burnham show expecting to hear everyone in the audience crack their knuckles simultaneously. But it happened, and it sounded like several thousand cherubs vomited in Carnegie Music Hall. “Watch how good the rest of this show appears now in relation to that sound,” Bo said.
The rest of the show was in fact much better in relation to that hideous sound. Bo has come a long way since his era of YouTube videos and Vines, and even from his last show titled what. If you aren’t familiar with his past work, it often draws from pop culture, social issues, and the state of comedy itself. He incorporates hip hop and satire into many of his pieces as well. His ongoing tour Make Happy delves into, for lack of a better term, more mature content without compromising unpredictability, raunchiness, and silliness. Although to be fair, I might still be the only one who finds farting into a microphone silly.
Like his previous shows, this one included disembodied voices, strobe lights, and plenty of Auto-Tune. There was a bit that portrayed the different ways of preparing a peanut butter and jelly sandwich depending on the state of intoxication. Another bit portrayed a breakup between a long-term couple, in which Bo repeatedly yelled “Eat a dick!” at his now ex-girlfriend until his screams became emotional sobs.
The new songs he performed at this show were arguably more relevant to current social issues than his previous work has been. This included an ironic tune detailing the difficulties of being a straight white man, and the struggles of finding your true soul mate. A note from Bo to straight women, “You might think this [perfect] guy only exists in your mind. Guess what? You’re right.” And to the straight men, “You might think this [perfect] girl only exists in your mind. She’s real, but last week she died. If you want love, lower your expectations.” He adds later, “Deep down you know you don’t deserve [love].”
And lowering expectations seems to be a recurring theme throughout Bo’s work, with his onstage, somehow slightly arrogant persona constantly reminding audience members to expect disappointment. There are brief moments, however, when we as an audience get to see a truer “Bo” on stage.
Referring to his own life, Bo questions his own decisions and whether they’ve made him happy — hence the tour name, Make Happy. Toward the end of his show, with all the lights in the auditorium on so that Bo could see each member in the audience, he knelt down and ranted. Part of his spiel included telling the audience, “We [performers] say follow your dreams. Don’t. If this is your dream, just race for failure. Or, reevaluate because this is not a meritocracy. I’ve had a privileged life, and I’ve been lucky, and I’m unhappy.” Despite the gravity of the topic, Bo still managed to keep the audience laughing and received a well-deserved standing ovation.
Anyone who knows me knows that I’m a sucker for the type of self-deprecating, critical humor — with bits of existential crises scattered throughout — that Bo performs. I also appreciated the honesty incorporated in his work, most notably with one of his opening statements: “Andrew Carnegie, the Donald Trump of the 1890s.”
Make Happy is a more refined, more mature Burnham that’s simultaneously hilarious and severely depressing. He performed a few old songs that, while they are fan favorites, I found cringe-worthy compared to his newer material. I still laughed throughout the entire show but by the time I got home I felt like a train had run over all my hopes and dreams. I’m kidding, kind of. I’m not going to say it’ll make you happy, but it’ll make you feel something in this soul-sucking demon of a school. We may not all be performers, but many of us have faced the difficulty in pursuing what truly makes us happy as we get older.
After seeing the progression in Bo’s work, I’m curious as to what direction his comedy will take in the future. If you can, definitely catch one of his Make Happy shows while he’s still on tour, or just watch it when it (probably) airs on Netflix in the next year or two.

Carnegie Mellon, in addition to being a world leading institute of higher education, also happens to be home to one the greatest poster collections in the world. Located on the top floor of Hunt Library, the Carnegie Mellon Swiss Poster Collection includes originals of some of the most iconic and innovative graphic design work from the past 50 odd years. In total, the collection includes over 300 works with varied themes and styles, together sharing the pinnacle of good graphic design for the modern era. Recently, I had the privilege of being shown around the entire collection. The way that ideas were expressed through striking yet simple visual imagery and type blew my mind.
The collection was established by Swiss graphic designer Ruedi Ruegg and Professor Daniel Boyarski in 1985 as a teaching collection. The story goes that every year, Ruegg would find the most intriguing graphic design work done that year, and have it shipped across the Atlantic to Professor Boyarski. Over the course of time, this resulted in the creation of a veritable collection featuring legendary designers such as Ruegg herself, Bill, Bruhwiler, Kulling, Leupin, Muller-Brockmann, Pfund, Troxler, and Weingart.
The posters were created for a variety of purposes: one was a hard hat warning for construction workers, another a flyer for a Blues concert. Many of them were embodiments of simple little things in Swiss culture. Using form, color, image and typography, the posters successfully convey ideas — some complex and some elementary — with remarkable clarity that would in many cases require paragraphs of text to achieve. They are immediate in impact, spontaneous, and often playful or humorous. Even more interesting, there is something decidedly Swiss about all of them; perhaps it is the remarkable clarity of thought, or the sense that every shade, every serif, really everything has been carefully considered by the designer.
There is an unmistakable chronological continuity to the collection. Posters from the 1950s and ‘60s are from the traditional “Swiss School” of Design, and rely heavily on composition, typography, and clear communication. This style garnered international acclaim and made the Swiss Poster a model in graphic design. Work from the ‘70s onwards is more experimental, closer to “Street Art.” The designs tend to be flamboyant and striking, and the focus tends to shift just a little from the typography and to the imagery. Another theme that struck me is the level of visual and cultural sophistication that a viewer is encouraged to bring to the posters. I remember some of the designs taking on a far more substantial meaning on a second or third viewing, or when given some historical context. A viewer’s intelligence is not only respected, but expected.
One of the designs that really stood out was “Milch,” an unbelievably simple design — a serene blue background with the word “Milch” crayoned in black, with the “ch” of Milch enclosed in a messy white oval. I found out much later that Milch is the German word for Milk; even so, one look at the poster and I knew what it was about. Another was an advert, ironically enough, for a Swiss Poster design competition. A three-fourths plus sign, very reminiscent of the Swiss flag, in unusual colors — shades of blue, yellow and red — and organized, clear typography went a long way in building the theme that the event is clearly very Swiss, with shades of edgy relevance.
Till recently, I had no idea that this collection existed at Carnegie Mellon, and I’m very glad to have found it. It really is an undiscovered gem for anyone even remotely interested in graphic design. Full of innovative work from the legends of the field, the collection is a great place to look for inspiration for any graphic-related work.

Phipps Conservatory is well known for its elaborate botanical gardens, plant collections, and seasonal exhibits. Some crowd favorites at the conservatory include the Japanese Bonsai displays, the Butterfly Garden, and the Orchid Garden. Along with the permanent exhibits and gardens, Phipps hosts a variety of artists, exhibits, and displays that interchange throughout the seasons.
I had the pleasure of visiting one of Phipps’s newest garden exhibits: Garden Railroad, which is located in the south conservatory. This exhibit has previously been a crowd-pleaser, but has been newly re-imagined into a wonderfully detailed world of toy railroads and ornate miniature towns that tell the tales of classic childhood fables and fairytales. Jordyn Melino designed Garden Railroad in collaboration with horticulturist Aaron D’Addio and animatronics technician Paul Widek.
Being both a fan of childhood classics and a Phipps Conservatory enthusiast, I was excited to visit the Garden Railroad exhibit. In true Phipps’ fashion, the room was filled with the fresh, relaxing aroma of plants and flowers, perfectly intertwined with the miniature landscapes that filled the center-most portion of the room. Upon walking into the room, you are immersed in a variety of fairy tales, ranging from There Was an Old Woman Who Lived in a Shoe to The Little Engine That Could.  
As I walked around the garden, one of the first tales that was on display was Peter Pan. I was pleased to discover that the exhibit featured interactive elements. When I pressed the buttons in front of the various fairy tales and fables, I saw the exhibit truly come to life. I pressed the button in front of the Peter Pan display and watched with satisfaction as Captain Hook’s pirate ship was chased around a small pond by the menacing Tick-Tock the Crocodile. As the ship sails around, a whimsical voice is heard in the background, “Second star to the right and straight on till morning.” 
Up next was The Little Engine That Could. I was pleased to find out the interactive buttons accompanied not only the Peter Pan display, but the majority of the displays within Garden Railroad. Upon pressing the button, The Little Engine That Could chugs up a steep hill, chanting “I think I can, I think I can,” all the way up. The display has the viewer practically chanting along with The Little Engine as he finally makes it over the top of the hill and rides down the other end in victory.
Moving on in the exhibit, the stories of Rapunzel, Little Red Riding Hood, Goldilocks and the Three Bears, Jack and the Beanstalk, and Paul Bunyan are told all throughout the gardens. Although each of the displays tells its own story, Garden Railroad has a wonderful sense of cohesion and coherence. The landscape is interlocked and the towns of each fairy tale spill over into the next. Several interlacing railroad tracks traverse the miniature towns as trains zig and zag all over the room, shining light onto the plants and flowers that outline the displays.
Lastly, I came to The Three Little Pigs display. The detailing of the pigs three houses was quite impressive, and the overall scene was well complemented alongside the forest-like display of the plants. I looked around in excitement as I searched for this display’s interactive button. I pressed the button in anticipation, and I was not let down. Out from behind the trees came the big bad wolf on his search for the three little pigs, hitching a ride on the back of the train. At this point, all hope of remaining maturity went out the window. The exhibits brought out fond memories of childhood, and it was difficult not to act like a giddy little kid. I looked around to see if I was alone in my feelings of childlike wonder, and as expected, was not. The exhibit put a smile on the faces of child and adult onlookers alike.
Whether you’re in the mood to spend an evening immersed in your favorite childhood fairy tales, or you just need a reason to spend a peaceful evening away from the stressful life of a Carnegie Mellon student, I suggest visiting Garden Railroad. The garden exhibit will be featured during the entire month of November.

If you haven’t studied abroad, you probably know someone who has. You run into her on campus, ask her about her time away, and she says the typical things. From “It was amazing!” to “You would have loved it!” to “I wish I was still there,” the hype around study abroad never changes. But why? How can countless young adults go to various countries year after year and return with the same enthusiastic message? Is study abroad really that great, or is everyone committed to maintaining its mystique, like the Illuminati? Is study abroad the new Illuminati?
Four years ago, I was a skeptical high school student with questions like these, and for a while I let my doubts get the best of me. I was worried about missing my friends, leaving the senior I liked, getting my license late, and what my parents would say. These seemed like valid reasons, until my friend Meyer returned senior year from spending a year in Spain. Not only did she acquire awesome stories and Spanish fluency, but she also didn’t miss a beat, winning senior class president while out of the country. Meanwhile, everything she left was practically the same, including me with no driver’s license.
Her success taught me that I played it safe when I shouldn’t have. I felt like Eminem was disappointed in me for missing my one shot and letting everything slip. So, I made it my mission to redeem myself in college and do study abroad. Since I now have a few weeks left in Italy, this list will probably change, but here are ten moments that put my redemption off to a great start.
Exploring Italy
Rather than going to all the major European cities, I’ve focused most of my efforts on Italy. I visited Rome, Pisa, Venice, and Cinque Terre and hope to make it to Milan, Naples, and Pompeii before time is up. My logic is that this period of time is the only time I’ll live in Italy so I might as well see as much of the country as I can.
Exploring Europe
Traveling really is a means to an end. Even if I hadn’t chosen Europe, all the other continents are so vast that traveling would have been easy and affordable.
My roommates
I actually didn’t think I’d be close to other exchange students, but my roommates are truly my people. From loving TV to having the same sense of humor, I’ve made lifelong friends that I can’t imagine not knowing.
Receiving Jif Peanut Butter in the mail
If you love Nutella, congratulations! You’ll love Italy. If you love peanut butter like me, you’ll constantly think, “I’ve made a huge mistake.” Italy only carries Skippy, so I either have to sell out and eat Skippy or hold out. I found My American Market, a French website that sells American groceries. Getting Jif felt like Christmas, but other great moments came out of it too. Pop Tarts mesmerize the Italians while all the Americans want to know how I pulled it off.
Food
All the food is incredible and I have yet to have a bad meal. The bad pizza tastes like Digiorno’s or Pizza Hut and the great pizza tastes like heaven and I start crying because I don’t feel worthy. The pastries, though, are essential and gelato once a day keeps the doctor away.
Weather
Florence feels like Pittsburgh in September, except it stays that way for the entire season and will never drop below freezing. I joke with my roommate, who’s from Michigan, that winter is coming, asking her if we’re ready. Meanwhile, everyone around us, including my suitemate from Miami, is investing in coats because the high is 60°F.
Drinking legally
I can’t speak much about Florence’s nightlife, but as someone under the age of 21, casually ordering any drink off a menu feels incredible.
Beautiful people
You saw this coming, but it’s true. Everyone is gorgeous and I try not to think about it. Instead, I may or may not go to this pizza place once a week and flirt with the all male staff when I order. Naturally, the restaurant is called Gusta Pizza.
Walking everywhere
I have always hated exercising, but some wise, sadistic Italian put me in one of the farthest apartments from campus. Since I avoid the metric system, I’m not really sure how much I’m walking but once you factor in the daily battle with tourists, tour groups, pigeons, bikers, taxis, and the occasional carriage ride, it feels much farther than Fairfax ever did. Plus, the campus elevator never works so those 9 flights of stairs serve as my daily cardio.
The Euro
You get a lot of bang for your buck in Europe, or you will once you stop calculating how many US dollars you’re spending. For example, spending 20€ or less in Conad, the Italian grocery store, always gets me a week’s worth of groceries. If every Carnegie Mellon student went into Giant Eagle with $20, how many of us would be done?
Honorable mention: getting stranded at IKEA
Everyone knows that moving doesn’t feel real until you find yourself in IKEA. Two of my suitemates had never been to an IKEA in the U.S.  so my roommate and I decided to end this tragedy. The Florence IKEA is so great that Europeans trust each other to bring pets inside and not destroy the place. It sounds absurd, but that IKEA was the cleanest one I’d ever been to. It might have been the best IKEA ever if it weren’t for their café. It was a great Saturday until the shuttle bus didn’t show up. Spirits were high, though, and the IKEA virgins lived to tell the tale.
It’s hard to explain, but to me, study abroad feels like creating an alternate reality for your life. For a few months, you acclimate to a different country, culture, and sometimes language. It’s a very daunting, yet rewarding process, especially for the restless and the curious. You could be right and have a list of reasons for why you can’t, such as your major, your parents, your significant other, Greek life, etc. However, I’d tell you and my high school self what Tina Fey learned from Amy Poehler on Saturday Night Live — “Do your thing and don’t care if they like it.”

I have a golden rule when it comes to TV shows: I can only make judgments on whether or not the show is going to be worthwhile after watching three episodes. After this week’s episode, I am finally able to formulate my opinion on the new CBS show Supergirl. After the trailer caused some uproar in the comic fan community, because it was selling the TV show like the Saturday Night Live’s (SNL) Black Widow movie parody, the show’s pilot was “leaked” online, and it was much better than what the trailer made it out to be. The show has a lot of potential, and it’s ultimately up to CBS whether the show will succeed or not.
The first episode contains a lot of background, and a lot of foray into who the characters are and why they are there. Kara Zor-El (a.k.a. Kara Danvers, a.k.a. Supergirl) is portrayed by Glee alum Melissa Benoist, who has an amazing voice, an amazing face, and is overall a badass. she can do everything her cousin (Kal-El, a.k.a. Superman, a.k.a. Clark Kent) can while running around in heels and a skirt, something that Superman can’t do. But actually, superheroines have always been looked at with some serious skepticism based on what they wear since they normally put them in revealing outfits that offer no practical use. For similar outfit situations, see: Wonder Woman ’75, any depiction of Black Cat, or a bunch of other comic renditions of women. However, DC has been putting some practicality in their female characters’ wardrobe choices, for example, both iterations of the Black Canary, and Speedy in the CW’s Arrow. The first episode does a good job of setting exactly why Kara thinks the way she does and explains the symbolism behind the “S” and why it’s important for that to be the main aspect of her costume.
Supergirl does a good job of balancing Kara’s personal and “professional” lifestyles: her personal being her job and her life outside of being Supergirl, and her professional life being Supergirl. It also does a good job of providing a background and a sense of fulfillment to her personal life: in essence giving some information about her relationship with her sister and the possibilities of complicating her life with two different men. One of them, her best friend in the company (portrayed by fantastic singer Jeremy Jordan) and a new romantic interest in Jimmy Olsen, portrayed by Mehcad Brooks from True Blood. The show, however, doesn’t rely on this as the main plot point. It’s all about Kara’s self-discovery and her journey in understanding and controlling her powers. It’s also more about her and her adoptive sister, portrayed by Chyler Leigh, Dr. Lexie Grey in Grey’s Anatomy, who has known of Kara’s powers since they were children and who only recently revealed that she was working for the Department of Extra-Normal Operations, which is this universe’s version of Marvel’s SHIELD.
The show’s only failing is in the special effects. The fighting while flying could use some work, but overall it’s decent. I’d much prefer for the studios to spend their money on making a high quality show than for them to only focus on the special effects and end up ruining the show. However, if you’re hoping for movie-quality special effects, you’ll be disappointed. Hopefully, as the season goes on, the quality of special effects, action sequences, and fight scenes will improve.
After three episodes, I have to say I’m going to keep watching the show. It’s entertaining, high energy, high action, and full of interesting characters that have room to grow and develop throughout the series. I’m hoping that National City, Central City, Star City, Gotham, and Metropolis are closer than they seem, so we can see more interaction between the heroes of the DC TV universe — although I’m not hopeful, since this show is being run by CBS and seems more connected to the movie universe rather than that of its television counterpart. Maybe we’ll see a Glee reunion (the Flash’s Grant Gustin was also in Glee with Melissa Benoist). All in all, I’d keep an eye on this fledgling show, as it still has the ability to surprise and excite people, while introducing them to a slew of dynamic characters in a relatively unexplored superhero universe.
Supergirl airs Mondays at 8 p.m. on CBS.

Hey, Josh!
I’ve got some food woes to share. All of my friends — literally, all of them — are vegetarians, or vegans, or sanitarians, or whatever, and I feel a bit persecuted as a full-blown carnivore whenever we eat together. Just yesterday, five of my friends and I were ordering at a fancy, sit-down restaurant downtown, and I ordered first. I ordered a steak, done blue well, which is when it’s seared on the outside and totally red on the inside, and it’s literally the most delicious thing ever on earth. Everyone, including the waiter, gave me some hardcore side-eye, and one of my friends fake-vomited in her mouth. After everyone else had ordered all their bean curds, and salads, and quinoas, they all stared at me again. One of my friends was like “Did you know that red meat causes cancer?” and another was all “It says right here on the menu that undercooked meat will... blah blah blah.”
It’s not like I think all people with dietary philosophies/conditions/preferences are the issue, but I’m feeling tremendous pressure to change my eating habits just so that this will stop. Help?
Thanks,
Signed,
Carnivore Adoring Barn-Braised Animals and Gratuitous Eating.
Hello CABBAGE,
I think that first and foremost, this issue is about the company you keep. If this is a recurring event, you shouldn’t just sit there and take it. You should tell them plainly that you do not appreciate their judgement regarding your food choices, and that if you want their advice, you’ll ask. In the same vein, you should be careful of judging their food, because that’s just as rude. While there are some great benefits to certain alternative diets, it’s all about what you want out of your eating experience. If you are someone who really loves meat, and it brings you joy, then more power to you. If you’re someone who treats food as fuel, then maybe it’s not the best thing to eat all the time. Either way, it’s your decision to make, and you should never feel cowed into changing for other people. So eat your bloody meats with a smile on your face, if that’s what you want. It’s your money and your body, so my advice is to just continue doing you.
Cheers,
Joshua Brown.

Ingrid Schaffner is an art critic set to curate the 57th Carnegie International. The Carnegie International is one of the world’s leading surveys in contemporary art. If you’re anything like me, just the words contemporary art make you fall asleep. It triggers thoughts such as “I could’ve done this” or “how is this any better than something a kindergartener draws?” However, for most people, including myself, this happens because of a lack of understanding of contemporary art. So in my attempt to be less close-minded on the subject, I attended a talk hosted by Schaffner at the Carnegie Museum of Art entitled “What is Contemporary Art?”
Shaffner began by presenting a list that divided contemporary art into the following categories: terrain, systems, reference, history, business, identity, form, ornament, alchemy, evocation, storage, resistance, and technology. Many of these categories are self-explanatory, however some required a deeper analysis. One of the first categories she discussed was systems. This was the idea of laying out a path for the viewer to follow. Schaffner discussed several artistic exhibits that only showcased dates or locations, which exist to highlight travels and the passage of time. While many of the exhibits that she spoke of were very simplistic, Schaffner explained how they told the story of time passage through their dates. This made me understand a little bit more about the intentions behind contemporary art, but I pressed on to find out why I still felt like it was so simple to execute.
Another important category discussed was reference. This explores the idea that everything that could ever be created was already done by modern artists, so post-modern artists are forced to simply copy and repeat what has already been done. The focus of this was works of art that recycled or sampled previously used ideas. Schaffner’s main example for this was Andy Warhol’s pop art work that resampled pictures of iconic figures in various colors. It was at this moment that I realized that contemporary artists don’t have it that easy. No one will ever paint another Mona Lisa, so are all contemporary artists left to just scavenge through bits of recycled art? Is that why no one even bothers to make art that resembles Renaissance level work? 
One of the most peculiar categories that Schaffner discussed was ornament, art used as decoration. She showed a sculpture of a completely hard couch to show that the difference between furniture and ornament is the functionality of the piece. Schaffner rationalized that the purpose of this art was not only in the decoration, but also in the placement of it. On the other hand, the concept of evocation was about much more than just decoration. This aimed to evoke an initial emotion out of the viewer before they are allowed to focus on what is actually happening. These are the very emotional pieces that feature artifacts and remnants from the artist’s past. Whether it’s happiness, sadness, frustration, or elation, the aim is to make the viewer feel something. This is the art that I find to be much more relatable just because the artist puts more of their personal experiences into it. This is the contemporary art that makes sense to me because even if it is not a beautiful painting, it is still an expression of self. 
Another concentration of contemporary art that Shaffner discussed was technology. This focused on art that not only was about the rise of technology, but art that utilized various forms of digital media to convey a message. This is the aspect of contemporary art that I have often found the most confusing because it seems so abstract sometimes. Schaffner explained however that much of the art in this category is in the creation of the piece as opposed to the actual work itself. 
Schaffner attempted to give me the tools to be able to dip my toes into the contemporary art world. I enjoyed the way she broke up the different elements into categories and explained the art through the lens of each category which helped it make a little more sense. I wouldn’t say I’m an expert by any means, but I do think that I am more aware of the thought that goes into creating the art despite how simple i perceive it to be. I embarked on this talk with one goal in mind: to finally understand what the hell is happening in contemporary art and to not think so negatively of it. Do I now know what’s happening in most of these pieces? Not really, but I will now be making future attempts to be a little more considerate of the feelings behind the blank canvases with a single square painted on them.

Straight Outta Compton
Friday, Nov. 20, 10 p.m.
Sunday Nov. 22, 8 p.m.
N.W.A. was America’s most dangerous rap group. With lyrics about the world around them in Compton, they exposed America to a “gangsta rap”, a genre that chronicled real life experiences. Straight Outta Compton follows the journey of Eazy-E, Dr. Dre, Ice Cube, MC Ren, and DJ Yella (Jason Mitchell, Corey Hawkins, O’Shea Jackson Jr., Aldis Hodge, and Marlon Yates Jr. respectively) from the streets of Compton to the pressures of fame. When Jerry Heller (Paul Giammati) first meets Eazy-E, he immediately sees talent and helps promote N.W.A.’s first single “Boyz-N-The Hood,” featuring lyrics by Ice Cube, music by Dr. Dre, and vocals by the first-time rapper Eazy-E. As the group members gain popularity, they continuously run into trouble with the law because of their lyrics opposing law enforcement. Following the release of their game-changing album Straight Outta Compton, N.W.A. begins to fall apart due to business relations between Eazy-E and Heller. Things quickly become hostile after Ice Cube departs from the group and several diss tracks are exchanged. Dr. Dre departs soon after and goes on to create Death Row records, the label that brought Snoop Dogg and Tupac fame. The members of N.W.A. are brought to life on screen by the actors, including O’Shea Jackson Jr. who has the honor of playing his father, Ice Cube. Follow N.W.A.’s journey from breakups, to makeups, to arrests as its members tell the story of American street violence and institutional racism.

Students from Carnegie Mellon and the University of Pittsburgh joined a national conversation on race and campus politics last Wednesday when they gathered to show solidarity with University of Missouri students. At 9 p.m., over one hundred students from both Carnegie Mellon and the University of Pittsburgh, as well as a scattered few other members of the campus community, gathered in the Jared L. Cohon University Center’s Kirr Commons, more commonly known as the black chairs.
The event came only hours after two students at the University of Missouri were arrested for making threats against black students on the state university’s flagship Columbia campus. According to the Associated Press, University of Missouri students Connor Stottlemyre and Hunter Park were arrested separately for posting explicitly violent, racially charged messages to the anonymous app Yik Yak. Stottlemyer wrote, “I’m going to shoot any black people tomorrow, so be ready,” contributing to a maelstrom of racial tension on the Missouri campus.
The protests at the University of Missouri have resonated with students at Carnegie Mellon. “The fact that someone can feel comfortable enough to say that they would go around shooting black people: It hit somewhere close to me personally,” senior mechanical engineering major Kayode Dansalami said. “Because that could happen to me. And it’s strange to think that I can’t feel safe on campus, going to class.” Dansalami helped organize the assembly as part of Spirit, a campus organization for fostering a sense of black community and championing black awareness.
Students at the University of Missouri have faced backlash from those who consider student responses overwrought and overreactive — on Monday, both the president and the chancellor of the University of Missouri resigned after continued criticism from students, including a hunger strike and protest from the university’s football team.
During Wednesday’s demonstration, Carnegie Mellon and University of Pittsburgh students instead showed solidarity with students at the University of Missouri. “We came up with this idea when we thought, ‘We should do something to show our support,” said Mattie Hedgebeth, a senior psychology major and one of the organizers of Wednesday’s event.
Hedgebeth, who serves as the black awareness chair of Spirit, said that the event came together quickly with the help of a social media push and a Facebook event made only a few hours before the 9 p.m. gathering. “With the miracle of social media, we were able to get all of these people from all of these different places to come,” she said.
Members of Spirit also worked with the University of Pittsburgh’s Black Action Society, drawing a wide array of students from both schools. 
At the event, students posed for a picture that they posted on Facebook and intend to send to student activists at the University of Missouri. “We want to show our support. We can’t be there, but we want to help,” Hedgebeth said.
At the event, members of Spirit and the University of Pittsburgh’s Black Action Society spoke to the crowd, endorsing the protests at the University of Missouri and attempting to begin a discussion on race and diversity at Carnegie Mellon and the University of Pittsburgh.
A member of Carnegie Mellon’s Graduate Student Assembly also spoke at the gathering to show his support for Jonathan Butler, a graduate student at the University of Missouri who embarked on a hunger strike that lasted for eight days on the condition of the removal of the university’s president.
“It was a collective effort,” senior psychology major and Vice President of Spirit Yaminah Carter said of the event. “A lot of us agreed that we wanted to do something, that we wanted to show solidarity with the students. Someone made the Facebook page, someone made the posters — it was all really fast. “
M. Shernell Smith, assistant director of Student Affairs and and housefellow of the Intersection, emphasized a need for a campus conversation that leads to tangible action. “I think what’s happening at Mizzou and Yale and all these other places is that people are asking, ‘So what are some things we can do together — not just talking about, but actually happening,’ ” Smith said. “What I appreciate is the fact that you can tell that there is work to be done, and there is work to be done here at Carnegie Mellon.”

Ambassador R. Nicholas Burns came to Carnegie Mellon to talk about “The Future of America’s National Security” last Tuesday.
Having played a leadership role in U.S. foreign policy toward the Middle East and Asia and becoming one of the nation’s top career diplomats as undersecretary of state for political affairs from 2005–2008, R. Nicholas Burns offered a big-picture perspective of the country’s position on the world stage. Burns, former Ambassador to Greece and NATO, “reflects the intellectual culture we seek to create in the Institute for Politics and Strategy. In his many years in the state department’s Foreign Service and now as a professor at the Harvard Kennedy School of Government, Ambassador Burns had become one of our nation’s top experts both in politics and strategy,” said Richard Scheines, dean of the Dietrich College for Humanities and Social Sciences.
The Ambassador’s lifelong trajectory supports the notion that one may start as an intern, following their passions in school, and through dedication and hard work, eventually be called upon to negotiate some of the most challenging issues in the world today. “Carnegie Mellon has such an incredible reputation as one of our leading schools for engineering and computer science, being on the cutting edge of our 21st century economy, but it does have to be balanced by an understanding of global policy and global affairs,” Burns said.
A great part of Burns’ message focused on international cooperation and the United States’ role as a global leader, in any metric devised. He drew attention to the United States having the greatest economy in the world, an incredibly innovative student population, and an insurmountable amount of political influence. All of this combined highlights the country’s responsibility to maintain the safety and security of its own borders, but also the rest of the world — “in a global age, if we’re not engaged as the leader of a coalition, if we’re nor helping other people, then we injure our own security as well as theirs” Burns said.
The elimination of boundaries brought on by globalization has not only stimulated the global economy, but has also transformed the way nations look at predicaments. Climate change is one of those. The future of clean energy jobs and high tech jobs will be born in universities such as the Massachusetts Institute of Technology or Carnegie Mellon, Burns said, and it is that kind of forward thinking that makes the United States an indispensable and exceptional power when it comes to leading change. Transnational alliances are key to solving this problem. Reaching out to countries such as China or India, some of the world’s largest carbon emitters, and redacting a climate agreement are believed to be some of the most important things President Obama will do during his mandate. By mid-December, the first global contract on climate change will most likely emerge, where every country in the world agrees to a mandated level of diminished carbon emissions, on a schedule that will take us forward during the next 30 or 40 years.
Other important issues that cross oceans and physical barriers are the trafficking of women and children as well as organized crime rings and drug cartels. There are so many elements involved in finding solutions to these issues, all of which require an enormous amount of cooperation.
“Part of it is getting to the source of the issue beyond America, but the most important part is getting to the root of the problem in our own country, in the hearts and minds and insecurities of our own kids, who are dependent on drugs,” R. Nicholas Burns said in an effort to highlight the role education plays in the mitigation of several global problems. Nonetheless, the magnitude of these issues requires the support of not only several nations, but also several resources such as the military, every level of government, and also businesses in America.
“Think about what is at stake in the transnational domain,” Burns said. “We have to be out there, engaging other countries as a leader and fight these problems before they can assault us.”
The lecture marked the introduction of Dietrich College of Humanities and Social Sciences’ new academic unit which will focus on the study of political science, international relations and national security. Under the direction of Kiron K. Skinner, who brings an enormous amount of scholarship, energy, and dedication to the enterprise, the Institute for Politics and Strategy (IPS) will serve as a center for research, undergraduate and graduate education, and university-wide initiatives.

The Steel City Naval Reserve Officer Training Corps (ROTC), consisting of students from Carnegie Mellon University, University of Pittsburgh, and Duquesne University, hosted a ceremony on the Cut in honor of Veteran’s Day last Wednesday.
The event included remarks by ROTC Unit Commanding Officer Captain Jeff Coran, trustees Torrence Hunt Jr., Don Carter, and Jay Sukits, as well as a moment of remembrance, taps, and lowering the flag at sunset.
Many veterans were in the audience. An introduction by Captain Jeff Coran included excerpts from President Obama’s Veteran’s Day 2015 Proclamation, in which he states, “Our veterans left everything they knew and loved and served with exemplary dedication and courage so we could all know a safer America and a more just world. They have been tested in ways the rest of us may never fully understand. On Veterans Day, and every day, [they] let us show them the extraordinary gratitude they so rightly deserve, and let us recommit to pledging our full support for them in all they do.”
Hunt reflected on the history of ROTC at Carnegie Mellon, remarking that “Carnegie Mellon has had a long and close affiliation with the U.S. Department of Defense in supporting the military of our country.” Hunt talked about how Carnegie Mellon’s campus was used as a temporary training ground for U.S. soldiers during World War I and World War II, “with students going to and from class alongside soldiers training to defend our country and our way of life.” 
However, the Vietnam War era of the late ’60s and early ’70s was marked by widespread student protests and antiwar sentiment across the country. Don Carter, a Vietnam veteran, graduated from the Carnegie Mellon School of Architecture in 1967 as a member of the ROTC program. Carter remarked that during the time period, many universities got rid of their ROTC programs. He was proud and found it a “wonderful thing” to still see Midshipmen (Naval ROTC students) in uniform on campus today.
Another Vietnam veteran, Jay Sukits, now a professor at the University of Pittsburgh’s College of Business Administration, spoke about a fellow Vietnam veteran, a captain and mentor who had trained him, Edward Francis Miles. In 1969, near the Cambodian border, Miles stepped on a land mine as he ran forward to check on wounded soldiers. He sustained horrific injuries, including amputations of both legs below the knee, loss of his right eye, and his right arm rendered permanently useless. “The personal courage he exhibited still stays with me today” Sukits said.
After the war, Miles eventually became an associate director of the Vietnam Veterans of America Foundation (VVAF), traveling the world to raise funds to help war survivors. He worked with the International Campaign to Ban Landmines, which won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1997. He passed away 35 years after he sustained his injuries during the  Vietnam War. His name was engraved on the Vietnam Veterans War Memorial in Washington, D.C., on May 4, 2010.
In response to the “protesters and naysayers” of the Vietnam Era, Sukits remarked, “Vietnam veterans served with great honor and dignity. They returned to a country that ignored them at best, and at worst, vilified them”.
Sukits then read a short poem called “Remember Them.” Afterwards, a moment of silence was held during “evening colors,” the U.S. Navy’s ceremonial lowering of the flag at sunset, while the solemn sounds of two trumpets was heard across the Cut.
Near the end of Hunt’s speech, he had remarked, “The military is not just about warfare; indeed, it is also about peace. It is about helping others around the world, who yearn for freedom to achieve, in their own way, the kinds of blessings and privileges that we Americans sometimes take for granted”.
Today, the Naval ROTC unit is hosted on Carnegie Mellon’s campus, while Air Force ROTC and Army ROTC are hosted at the University of Pittsburgh.

Leading figures in innovation gave lightning talks as part of Innovation Palooza last week, while students participated in the second ever Impact-a-Thon and saw demonstrations of innovation at various companies.
Michael Bruce, Alexis Roberts-McIntosh, and Harry Shimp, three leading figures in innovation, spoke at the event.
Michael Bruce, President & CEO of InScope Technologies International, shared how his experience as a first generation American instilled an innovative spirit in him which lead to the creation of his company. “Be true to yourself,” Bruce said. He said that to be a successful entrepreneur one should not limit herself to being a specialist, but should extend her scope of knowledge to understand her rivals.
Alexis Roberts-McIntosh, formerly vice president of research and development at Johnson & Johnson, discussed how innovation impacts the consumer products industry, saying that to be successful one should make the experience of customers remarkable. “Don’t wait until somebody else has done it,” Roberts-McIntosh said. Moreover, she noted that start-ups should work collaboratively with partners to achieve success.
Lastly, Harry Shimp, Senior Operating Partner of MCM Capital, talked about the importance of innovation in manufacturing and encouraged students to pursue innovation in their works.
Apart from the lightning talks, the Impact-a-Thon student competition offered a platform where students’ projects would be evaluated by judges, with the top three projects receiving prizes. 
Students offered various designs to help disabled children access recreation facilities. For example, the team that made Terra Chairs offered a mobile base that attaches to a wheelchair and allows disabled children to access many places with the base working like a crawler. 
Some students offered designs that allowed disabled children to play with other children. For example design majors Yubing Zhang, Zan Lee, Xingsuo Liu, and Lynn Sandberg created Carolina Swing, a swing made of wood chips with a folding back and fording arm supports.  On the same note, Team Awesome Impacto created a play center called “Once Upon a Time.” With a stall engraved with Braille on one side, the center was accessible to children with and without disabilities.
The projects were judged throughout the event, and three winners were chosen.
The first prize went to team Soundsation, comprising four students: fifth-year mechanical engineering majors Matt Powell-Palm, Allen Miller, and Judy Han, and Braden Kell, a masters student in electrical and computer engineering. Their creation, Trebelcade, offered an interactive musical platform for autistic children. The wall-shaped Trebelcade was equipped with ultrasonic proximity sensors. When players approach the sensors with their hands, Trebelcade would sound a note and light up to direct the player to the next note, thus composing a small piece of work. Trebelcade allowed for interaction without direct touching, which is often a source of over-stimulation for autistic children. In this way, team Soundsation was able to help over 1.1 million autistic children in the US have fun with music, which could help develop their communication skills.
The second prize went to the team that created Unity Playgrounds, a modular system with each module designed for a certain kind of disability, and by assembling them to one’s needs, the facility could accommodate many needs.
The third prize laureates presented Wonder Wheels, another modular system, that allowed children to create an event and maintain the friendship outside the equipment with an affordable price.
Innovation Palooza also gathered companies who had brought their demos to the campus. 4Moms showed an electric folding trolley and an electric cradle that could rock a baby without its mother. 
Other companies included Amazon Robotics, Ansys, Automated Dynamics, Axis, Bosch, Corning Glass, Hillcrest Labs, Kennametal, Performance Plastics, and Simcoach Games: all providing students with information or chances for internships and job opportunities. 
Moreover, Innovation Palooza had some faculty/student demos including 3-D bioprinting, showcasing how to 3-D print in gelatin. Others included robotic prostheses and exoskeletons, changing polymers to metals, pulmonary drug delivery, Wakecap, and CMU Rwanda program.

Last week, representatives of Tor, a network of servers used to guarantee anonymity on the Internet, accused Carnegie Mellon computer scientists of selling research to the FBI that compromised the volunteer-run service and exposed information about users of “the dark web” to the FBI and others.
Tor, which stands for The Onion Router, helps users of the dark web do their business anonymously. “The dark web” refers broadly to any part of the Internet not indexed by search engines, and is home to black markets such as the now defunct Silk Road 2.0, a trafficking hub for illegal items. In such black markets, users of the dark web can find illicit goods ranging from fake passports, to drugs, to stolen identities.
“Apparently these [Carnegie Mellon] researchers were paid by the FBI to attack hidden services users in a broad sweep, and then sift through their data to find people whom they could accuse of crimes,” Tor wrote on its blog. 
The suspicion against Carnegie Mellon began when a group of researchers pulled out of the Black Hat Conference, a conference for hackers and the cybersecurity community. At the conference, the researchers were slated to give a talk on how to break into Tor using only $3000 worth of hardware.
Tor alleges that the FBI paid $1 million dollars to Carnegie Mellon’s Computer Emergency Response Team (CERT), part of the Software Engineering Institute (SEI), for the research.
This conduct, the organization says, violates the tenets of ethical research. According to Tor’s blog, “There is no indication yet that they had a warrant or any institutional oversight by Carnegie Mellon’s Institutional Review Board. We think it’s unlikely they could have gotten a valid warrant for [Carnegie Mellon’s] attack as conducted, since it was not narrowly tailored to target criminals or criminal activity, but instead appears to have indiscriminately targeted many users at once.”
“Apparently these researchers were paid by the FBI to attack hidden services users in a broad sweep, and then sift through their data to find people whom they could accuse of crimes,” the post continues. “Such action is a violation of our trust and basic guidelines for ethical research. We strongly support independent research on our software and network, but this attack crosses the crucial line between research and endangering innocent users.”
“I’d like to see the substantiation for their claim,” Ed Desautels, part of the SEI’s public relations department, told Wired. “I’m not aware of any payment,” he added, declining to comment further. When The Tartan reached out, university officials declined to comment.
Tor’s exploited vulnerabilities were patched last year, but not before they lead to the arrest of Brian Richard Ferrell, who was charged with conspiracy to distribute heroin, methamphetamine, and cocaine.
According to the search warrant against Ferrell’s house, a “Source of Information (SOI)” provided “reliable IP addresses for TOR and hidden services such as SR2.” For months, the source remained unidentified.
In mid-October, however, Ferrell’s defense introduced a motion claiming that a “research-based institution” gave the government the information used to arrest Ferrell. Soon, Motherboard  drew a connection between Carnegie Mellon and the compromised Tor servers. 
In a statement to Ars Technica, the FBI denied the allegations. “The allegation that we paid [Carnegie Mellon University] $1 million to hack into Tor is inaccurate,” an FBI spokeswoman told the website last Friday.

The Tartan Express food truck at Legacy Plaza was stamped with a notice by the Allegheny Health Inspector for health code violations last Thursday. Campus was abuzz with students’ rumors as to why the truck closed.
Ranging from the realistic, to the completely absurd, students may not know which rumors are fact and which are fiction. Health services can assure students that the violation was a small issue, of which even the vehicle’s operator was unaware.
In an interview with The Tartan, Director of Dining Services Pascal Petter placed a small hose atop his desk. “[There] is a hose that’s underneath the food truck which supplies water to the water tanks. This was kinked...which didn’t allow us to have the correct amount of water pressure coming out of the sinks themselves,” Petter said.
The Allegheny County health inspector on the scene decided to close the truck Wednesday night, and left shortly thereafter. Carnegie Mellon Facility Management Services repaired the hose the same day, but the inspector was already gone. “As a follow up, I reached out to the same inspector on Thursday, to have him reinspect the truck that day, but I unfortunately did not hear back from him until late Thursday afternoon, as he was in the field. He came out Friday, midday, to re-inspect the truck, which of course passed the inspection,” Petter said.
The only issue that the school’s food truck had with the health inspection was the hose itself. The truck opened back up on Friday afternoon, and its operators conducted business as usual, except they decided to work later than typical Friday hours. “We then opened up at 4 p.m. that same day, and saw an increased flow of traffic from students,” Petter said. Petter notes that this is evidence to students’ confidence in the food truck’s ability to follow food safety requirements.
The Tartan Express food truck itself is managed by the owners and operators of Lulu’s Noodles on Craig Street and Asiana in Newell Simon Hall.
As for the health safety concerns for the truck, the school oversees a majority of its vendors. “We do on a fairly regular basis have our own food safety inspection that we conduct at food locations. That is to support our vendors; This is not to take place of Allegheny County Health Department regulations, or their inspections, it is to support our vendors’ food safety efforts and to ensure compliance,” Petter said.
As for what students think, many are more concerned not with the truck’s food safety, but its food quality. “It always smells like instant ramen when you walk by the Tartan Express,” junior business administration major Kenny Zheng said. Remarking on the food quality immediately prior to the close, sophomore physics major Marcel Legros said the food was “really salty, and too spicy for my tastes.” This is unrelated to the food truck’s food safety, and does not speak at all to its customer service, which the administration took into account when designating operational duties for the truck.
Carnegie Mellon’s Asiana restaurant has been on campus for almost a decade now, and its operators’ further impact on campus seemed a logical step for dining services, as the organization wanted an Asian dining experience more centralized on campus. 
The inception of the food truck came about in the spring of 2014, after several meetings that Petter had with students revealed students’ overall desire for more diversity in their food choices. Now, with the food truck, students do have a convenient and diverse choice of foods on campus; it just depends on which foods they want to eat.

CREATE Lab develops tool to simplify data
A new web tool developed in collaboration between senior system/software engineering major Saman Amirpour Amraii and post-doctoral researcher Amir Yahyavi at the CREATE Lab within the Robotics Institute called Explorable Visual Analytics, or EVA, enables researchers to interact with and make sense of large data sets. According to the university press release, “the tool uses a novel computer architecture that enables the analyst to explore raw data through dynamic visualizations with minimal time delay.”
With data sets of this size, researchers are usually dependent on automated processes that remove the element of human judgment, but with the tool, users can select portion of data to be analyzed. It then allows the user to select different parameters and changes the visual to the most appropriate graphic representation.
The system also stores the dataset at large on an external server and then downloads small portions of relevant data as they are analyzed. Amraii noted that keeping the system speedy was one of their main goals because “If it takes a half hour to get an answer to your query, you may forget why you asked in the first place.”
The team has tested their work on data from the U.S. Census Bureau’s Longitudinal Employer-Household Dynamics to analyze the racial makeup of Philadelphia neighborhoods, and they hope to explore data on global deforestation, data from the Department of Transportation, and simple business analytics.
The research is supported by Google and the tool can be accessed online at http://eva.cmucreatelab.org/
Project RE_ to reuse, rebuild, and restore
Monday, Nov. 16, will be the official start of Project RE_, a vision that after 10 years of planning will finally become a reality. John Folan, a professor in Carnegie Mellon’s School of Architecture, created the project as a way to help improve urban communities.
In an effort to encourage people to avoid wasting resources, Project RE_ strives to reuse materials that are already available. RE stands for the project’s goal of collaboration to reuse material, rebuild communities, and restore lives.
The event will oversee Folan joining with partners from Construction Junction (CJ) and the Trade Institute of Pittsburgh (TIP) to see the official start of the project, which will be a part of the School of Architecture’s Urban Design Build Studio (UDBS).
Construction Conjunction will provide materials from their deconstruction projects while collaborating with TIP and UDBS to develop methods of processing the materials and re-imagining their use through design.
Monday’s dedication takes place at 3:30 at Project RE_’s hub housed in Construction Conjunction. In attendance will be Pittsburgh Mayor Bill Peduto, Allegheny County Executive Rich Fitzgerald, and University Provost Farnam Jahanian, all of whom have played a part in the creation of this project.

It’s official: Starbucks has declared war on Hanukkah. Every November, Starbucks decides to spruce up its various warm beverages with fun cup designs in the holiday spirit. This year’s cups have created the issue at hand — they are completely red.
Red — while appropriate for winter holidays such as Christmas, Kwanzaa, and Diwali — does not in any way fit into the blue and white color scheme of Hanukkah. Starbucks is deliberately ignoring the Jewish community and disrespecting the memory of the Maccabees, the heroes of the Hanukkah tale.
To combat this obvious hatred of my beloved holiday, I have come up with a way to force the Festival of Lights to get the recognition on Starbucks coffee cups that it deserves. I am going to visit my local Starbucks with a bucket of blue paint, buy a drink, and then force my barista to paint the cup blue for me. My cup covered in wet blue paint will serve as a reminder that we cannot stand idly by in the face of hatred; we must fight to have our voices heard. 
Obviously, this plan of mine has a few major flaws. For one, having cans of blue paint in places where foods and drinks are being made is definitely against health code. Furthermore, Starbucks is a corporation that does not care about my outrage as long as I am still purchasing its beverages. Finally, and most importantly, it is absolutely ridiculous to call a red coffee cup a symbol of hatred against the holidays.
Nonetheless, conversations about these coffee cups have filled the news ever since Starbucks released their new cup design last week. While in previous years, the Starbucks holiday cup has featured winking snowmen, sledding scenes, snowflakes, tree ornaments, and words such as “wish” and “hope,” this year Starbucks has dialed it back, creating a mininalist cup with a two-tone red background and the Starbucks logo. “Starbucks is inviting their customers to tell their Christmas stories in their own way, with a red cup that mimics a blank canvas,’’ the company said in a statement to TODAY. 
This change of design has sent self-proclaimed evangelist and Internet personality Joshua Feuerstein into a frenzy. On Nov. 5, Feuerstein posted a video on his Facebook page to his over 1.8 million followers expressing his outrage over the cup design that does not feature any holiday imagery. 
“Do you realize that Starbucks wanted to take Christ and Christmas off of their brand new cups? That’s why they’re just plain red,” Feuerstein proclaimed in his video. “When I went in, I asked for my coffee, they asked for my name, and I told them my name is Merry Christmas. So guess what, Starbucks, I tricked you into putting Merry Christmas on your cup.” Feuerstein went on to challenge Christians across the country to do the same, and to share the video with friends to spread the word. The video has over 180,000 likes and has been shared over 500,000 times.
Since then, social media has been blowing up with both agreement and outrage. Some have carried out their own versions of Feuerstein’s protest, posting coffee selfies and praising companies such as Dunkin’ Donuts,whose holiday coffee cups this year feature a design that says “Joy,” surrounded by holly and snowflakes.
Many others have denounced his claims, some even creating their own designs of the Starbucks cup to mock the controversy, including Stephen Colbert’s cup idea that features a nativity scene glued to the top, a small tree attached to the bottom, and tinsel streaming down the sides. Presidential candidate Donald Trump has even weighed in on the issue at his recent rally in Springfield, Illinois, declaring, “I have one of the most successful Starbucks in Trump Tower. Maybe we should boycott Starbucks? I don’t know.… By the way, that’s the end of that lease, but who cares.”
Let’s take a step back for a moment and realize what we are fighting about here: We are talking about a plain red coffee cup. This is no anti-Christmas propaganda, and, for the record, none of Starbucks’ former holiday cups said “Merry Christmas” in the first place, opting instead for generic, winter-themed designs. With the abundance of Christmas decorations and merchandise that line almost every post-Halloween retail center in America, there is no lack of Christmas spirit.
Starbucks itself sells a Christmas Blend coffee, along with Christmas-themed merchandise. Christmas is so oversaturated in society that companies have to actively try to reach out to non-Christians, either through fully inclusive or generic winter-themed decoration. There have never been stories of Starbucks’ Hindu patrons being angry about the lack of Diwali spirit, or Jewish patrons demanding a menorah with their latte. There is no absence of Christmas to complain about.
Furthermore, instead of being outraged over a design on a coffee cup, let’s realize how lucky we are to be able to afford $4 coffee in the first place. I am sure that the millions of people in this country that struggle to put food on the table every day do not care about what is on the packaging of that food. We are lucky enough to be able to spend money on luxuries such as coffee, but instead of being thankful, we are caught up in completely arbitrary debates about hurt feelings and paper cups.
So, to those that are offended by the lack of Christmas spirit on your Starbucks coffee cup: Go ahead and take a stand by ordering your drink and making your barista write “Merry Christmas” on your cup. Just remember that those words are about as useful as a coat of blue paint. In the end, it will get thrown out with the rest of your coffee cup; it will do little to improve the day of your barista; it will make no real impact on society; and Starbucks will be happily receiving your money regardless.

According to the Merriam-Webster dictionary, there are three definitions of the word “beauty:” first, the quality of being physically attractive; second, the qualities in a person or a thing that give pleasure to the senses or the mind; and finally, a beautiful woman.
There has long been a disparity in how the idea and expectation of beauty is applied to women compared to men. A “beauty” is a woman; a man can be beautiful, but the nature of the word does not expect or require a man to be so. As children, we are taught not to judge a book by its cover and that what’s on the inside counts. But this is not what society teaches, especially when it comes to women.
It’s undeniable that women of all ages face pressure to appear younger, prettier, and more sexually appealing. It is a message that’s pounded into our heads with every magazine advertisement, TV commercial, and Miss America pageant. It is a message that holds tremendous potential to shatter a woman’s confidence and comfort in her own skin, and it is a message that long ago should have been deemed backward and obsolete. Yet, it is a message that still persists everywhere.
It is no secret that there are serious presidential candidates who are women, but what I find extremely unsettling is the unjust treatment and criticism these women receive for their appearances and fashion choices.
Why should it matter what Hillary Clinton’s hair looks like or that Carly Fiorina wore 3 and 1/2 inch heels for a three-hour debate? It’s not wrong to dress in classy and appealing way, but the issue is that nobody is writing pages-long articles about the price and designer of Jeb Bush’s suit.
It is inappropriate to discuss physical appearances in politics, where such things are so far from what should be the focus, and it’s especially problematic that such a dichotomy exists between male and female politicians. 
Judging a woman on her clothes or makeup is so shallow that it invalidates and lessens how seriously a female candidate may be considered. Even as women’s rights have increased, we still keep returning to mindsets of the past. We can never move forward in any real way until we let go of these former societal standards.
This is a hard and complex time for women, which is something that is often dismissed due to tremendous steps forward in gender equality. The biggest fault in our society is the double standard that women face. A woman is supposed to be strong and independent and monetarily support her family in the same way that her husband does, but at the same time she is held to the role of caretaker, homemaker, and beautifully charming wife. To be just one or the other is often viewed as some kind of fault. No matter what new gender equality bills are passed or laws are implemented, no one can justifiably argue that men and women are viewed equally in America. 
The day that men and women are equal will be the day when a woman is not judged by the brands she wears, the style of her hair, or the role she plays in her family. We are getting closer, but we are not there yet.

How do you think you pronounce my name? If you are like 90 percent of the teachers I’ve had in my life, you were wrong. My name, Gaelic in origin, is one of those that needs some extra clarification. It was recently pointed out to me that having such an odd name must have shaped the person I grew into. As odd as it is to think, the labels assigned to us when we are tiny womb aliens guide us to who we are.
Statistically, names can shape people’s employment opportunities and school performance. Way back in 1948, study examined the effect of names on Harvard students’ performance. They found that men with unusual names were more likely to flunk out or to manifest neuroses than men with common names.
As the discipline of statistics has improved, similar studies have focused on people’s cultural and racial associations with names. A 2004 study by Marianne Bartrand and Sendhil Mullainathan sent out two resumes with identical qualifications and different names, one “white sounding” and one “black sounding.” The study found that candidates with “white” names received 50 percent more requests for interviews. This demonstrates racial discrimination in hiring processes that, while probably unconscious, can have a huge effect on individuals’ lives. Studies have also found that teachers expect less of children with “black” names, who therefore underperform. 
Gender also plays a role in how names affect people. Research in Florida schools has found that boys with names that are more common among girls, such as “Audrey” or “Lindsey,” have more behavioral problems once they reach puberty. “Once these kids hit sixth grade, all of a sudden the rates of disciplinary problems skyrocket [for those boys with ‘girlish’ names], and it was much more the case if there happened to be a girl in the grade with that same name,” said the head researcher on the study. This news probably doesn’t come as a surprise to anyone who’s lived through middle school. Children can be mean. An unusual name is often just one more thing for bullies to make fun of, driving certain children to the bottom of the social hierarchy.
It’s no wonder that many young adults opt to change their names. Recently, a friend of mine decided to change his Asian-sounding name, which was tied to his family and culture, to something more white upper-middle class. I’ve met many people around campus who have anglicized their names for convenience, to avoid the awkward dance that happens every time you introduce yourself and having to repeat your name three times before giving up and settling. A traditionally “white” name can get people places socioeconomically, so it’s tempting to make the switch.
However, I would argue for standing by unusual names. While my name doesn’t have strong racial connotations, it certainly stands out. This has been formative for me because it means I can’t hide, even if I want to. So, I’ve learned how to stand out and make the most of it. Having a name that is tied to your heritage says that your heritage matters, and that it is something that should be worn with pride. A rare name or a different spelling of a more common name tells a child that they should be proud to be unique and creative.
Tailoring our name choices to society’s norms sends the message that it’s better to go with the flow and play by the rules, even if the rules are wrong. Perhaps it’s idealistic, but I see these studies as a challenge, not a judicial sentence. The biases built into judging unusual and even straight-up weird names is something that needs to be questioned, not given into.

Last week, the ethics of Carnegie Mellon’s Computer Emergency Response Team (CERT) were challenged by The Onion Router (Tor) Project's accusation that the FBI had paid CERT over $1 million to target and identify users of Tor’s anonymizing service. If true, this activity is both an attack on user privacy and a blow to the image of our university. It calls into question the ethics of Internet security research being conducted at many universities and our own administration’s lack of transparency.
Tor, originally created by the U.S. Navy, is a network that allows anonymous Internet browsing. Since its creation, it has become a non-profit organization in support of Internet privacy. While Tor is commonly cited in both drug and child pornography crime reports, it is also used for many legitimate and ethical purposes, such as allowing those in oppressive nations to express and educate themselves on a free and open Internet.
Internet privacy is a right of the people. Because the right has been denied by organizations such as the NSA, networks like Tor should be protected and fostered by the academic community. Instead of protecting Internet privacy, Carnegie Mellon has been accused of adding “a group of malicious relays” to pick out people in the network. Tor works by directing user’s encrypted traffic through a series of random nodes on the Tor network. Tor believes that Carnegie Mellon has discovered and abused vulnerabilities in the system, allowing it to trace users through these nodes.
When breaches in security are discovered by the ethical hacker community, they are released to the public in hopes of quickly patching them and making services even more secure. This is just what Carnegie Mellon was planning to do during its scheduled talk at Black Hat 2014, when it described that it had found a breach to “de-anonymize hundreds of thousands of Tor clients and thousands of hidden services within a couple of months.”
However, when the talk was abruptly canceled, its research purpose and ethics became questionable. Tor’s accusations are further strengthened by documents from the Silk Road 2.0 trial, which revealed that a “university-based research institute” had helped to identify suspects. Although both the university and the FBI have denied the claims, the evidence is slanted against them.
University research is meant to bring knowledge to the people in an open and ethical way. If this accusation is true, Carnegie Mellon’s research team has gone against all that is preached to researchers. Even more importantly, this is an attack on users’ fundamental privacy and anonymity rights within the Internet. Malicious attacks like these are not only attacks on the guilty, but on everyone in this nation that is connected to the Internet. Spying on encrypted traffic is equivalent to breaking down the doors of all Americans in hopes of finding criminals. Criminals will be found, but the biggest criminals are the ones breaking down the doors.

In recent weeks, the University of Missouri, more popularly known as Mizzou, has been shaken by protests surrounding the administration’s mistreatment of black students and failure to provide a safe space. These protests won a resignation from Mizzou’s university president and school chancellor and spread to colleges across the country, including Yale University, Ithaca University, and Claremont-McKenna. However, last Monday’s backlash against the Mizzou protests — including racial slurs, vandalism, and even anonymous death threats on YikYak — has been a harsh reminder for black college students of the pervasiveness of racism on campuses everywhere.
As the protests continued, and Mizzou’s administration continued to not do enough to stop the perpetrators, many students nationwide started posting Facebook statuses such as: “To the students of color at Mizzou and many other institutions across the country: I, a student of color at Carnegie Mellon University, stand with you in solidarity. To those who would threaten their sense of safety, we are watching. You are not alone. ‪#‎ConcernedStudent1950 ‪#‎InSolidarityWithMizzou”
But people of color need to understand is that this situation is not about us. This is not something that Latinos, Asian Americans, or the entirety of people of color experience: This is an issue facing black Americans. By framing this issue as one facing people of color, we are indirectly making it seem like we are bearing the brunt of this kind of racism. By not calling ourselves allies in this situation, we are muddying the experiences of black individuals. We seem to be indirectly trying to combine all the experiences of people of color under one umbrella, when that is patently not the case.
It’s true that Latinos and Asian Americans also face issues that black people don’t, such as anti-immigrant rhetoric. Still, in this particular situation, in this specific case, those things don’t matter. The death threats at Mizzou were not made to a generic “people of color;” they were made to black people. This is an issue that black people, not people of color, face. People of color should be standing in solidarity with them, and we should be allying ourselves with the cause, but we should not be speaking over black people in these spaces, and we should not try to say that all people of color face the same issues at this time, because we don’t.
Carnegie Mellon should be doing more to ally itself, as both an institution and a student body, with the students at Mizzou. We need to further address our issues with with recruitment and admission of black students, and we need to be doing more to stand as allies with black students at Mizzou, Yale, Ithaca, and colleges across the country.

The popular Tartan Express Food Truck that is usually situated in Legacy Plaza outside of the Cohon University Center (CC) was shut down for a health code violation last week, prompting the Tartan to talk to Pascal Petter, the Director of Dining Services. 
Director of Marketing for Student Affairs Operations Mandi Semple commented in the “To Dining With Love” Facebook group, saying “The Allegheny County Health Department has temporarily suspended the permit to operate the Tartan Express, due to a water pressure issue on the truck. Once the water pressure is fixed, the truck will be re-inspected and back in operation in the very near future. Food service safety is a top priority at Carnegie Mellon. We are working to resolve the issues immediately and apologize for this inconvenience to the community.”
The Pittsburgh Post-Gazette reports that the food truck did not have running water, prompting the shutdown. “No one in the vehicle is able to wash hands when beginning new tasks, after handling money or touching the face or hair,” a health inspector wrote.
The problems, however, went beyond that. “Other violations included holding food at unsafe temperatures and inadequate sanitization,” the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette wrote. The full health inspection report can be viewed online, and includes violations such as employee personal hygiene, cleaning and sanitation, water supply, and cold holding temperature. Although the truck has since been re-inspected and has reopened, the closure of the food truck prompted many students to consider the cleanliness of the truck and, even further, of all of the dining facilities on campus. 
Since Petter has taken over Dining Services at Carnegie Mellon, students and faculty have seen a marked improvement in the communication between the administration and students regarding on-campus dining, the “To Dining With Love” Facebook page being one notable example.
However, on the Facebook page, students frequently post concerns and questions regarding the safety of the food that they eat, ranging from hummus at Entropy+ that has remained on the shelf despite its long-past expiration date to chicken found in a serving of vegetarian soup. While the staff of Dining Services does a fast and efficient job of addressing these concerns, it leads to questions about the bigger picture of food health and safety at Carnegie Mellon. The university should be meeting the minimum standards of food health inspections while serving quality food, and students should not have to worry about the sanitation of the dining places they frequent.

Recent research on the prevalence of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, or ADHD, has suggested that the disorder goes undiagnosed even more than was previously suggested, according to an article in The New York Times this week. 
The writer of the article, Katherine Ellison points out that in the midst of rising rates of diagnosis, there is a distinctive lack of understanding that is not rising at the rate that it should be. Ellison writes that “While global diagnoses of ADHD are on the rise, public understanding of the disorder has not kept pace. Debates about the validity of the diagnosis and the drugs used to treat it — the same that have long polarized Americans — are now playing out from Northern and Eastern Europe to the Middle East and South America.” According to Ellison, global stigmas are often crippling to the children who suffer through these disorders, and the stigma extends to the medication that could help them to cope. She emphasizes, however, that this isn’t a new phenomenon.
The skepticism surrounding popular medications that help kids with ADHD to focus is rampant, and only continues to be exacerbated by the abuse of the same drugs by the peers of the children who need it. A recent study by Gustavus Adolphus College reported that it is likely that one in seven college students will abuse Adderall, Ritalin, or another ADHD-treating drug during their time at school, and these rates are continuously rising, prompting many to question the merits of these drugs.
Even, or perhaps especially, at Carnegie Mellon, the discussion revolves around the medication’s abusers rather than its intended use in helping those who need it. With rates of ADHD diagnoses on the rise, it is more important than ever that this stigma be struck down. ADHD is not a joke or a reason to pop a pill, but a serious disorder that can cripple students’ potential and inhibit academic progress.
The medication that can help to these students to overcome their disorder and do great things is considered by others to be the start to a good night out or a reason to put off a paper until the night before, and these conflicting purposes hurt the reputation of the medication. There is no shame in taking these medications if they are prescribed to you, but rampant abuse has made it so that even those with ADHD cannot admit to having the medication without fear of stigmatization or worse, having their pills stolen from them.
At Carnegie Mellon, great minds work hard every day to solve problems and find solutions. There is no place on this campus for stigmatization of any kind, but especially not of our peers. Rather than shaming them for the medication that they take legitimately, we should hold those who abuse the medication accountable while celebrating those who are more than just their disorder. 
Instead of cultivating an environment of shame and secrecy, we should bring the discussion of this disorder and the misconceptions of it out into the open to lay the foundation for an open, productive conversation that reflects the intelligent, caring community of Carnegie Mellon University.

As I’m writing this, over 130 civilians have been confirmed dead, with an additional 300 wounded, after organized terrorist attacks on Paris this Friday night. Bodies are still being counted and identified. Thousands of Parisians, unsure of their friends’ and family’s safety, still fear the worst. Paris has experienced its worst catastrophe since the Second World War, and the Islamic State (IS or ISIS) has staged a terrorist attack of unprecedented scale and scope. The whole world is reeling. As I mourn for Paris, I also fear the impact of this attack on more than 4 million Syrian refugees and 1.6 billion Muslims across the planet.
After a night of celebratory social media posts from ISIS members and sympathizers, the extremist group officially declared responsibility for the attacks in a statement released Saturday morning. The group claimed that the main sites of carnage were specifically targeted: popular rock venue the Bataclan, “where hundreds of idolaters were together in a party of perversity;” the Stade de France, where “the imbecile” French President Francois Hollande was attending a soccer match; as well as the streets of several bustling restaurant districts. With its tough stance on terrorism and often Islamophobic rhetoric, France has long been at the center of the jihadist group’s hatred of the West. 
“France and those who follow its path must know that they remain the principal targets of the Islamic State,” said the statement, claiming that the attacks were in retaliation for French airstrikes against jihadist strongholds in Syria and Iraq.
The attacks were completed by eight men, each equipped with machine guns and explosive belts, who were all killed by the end of the night — the majority by their own suicide blasts, a couple by law enforcement officers. Though these terrorists have been apprehended, they are hardly the “lone wolf” attackers on the international stage that ISIS has encouraged in the past. 
These attacks were coordinated and technologically fluent, a carefully orchestrated joint effort between ISIS leaders in Syria and Iraq and insider extremists in France. If ISIS is indeed responsible for the attacks, which has yet to be confirmed by French government investigators, the group’s power has expanded more quickly and broadly than Western leaders ever anticipated.
The aftershocks are already shaping up to be massive. President Hollande called the attacks an “act of war” by ISIS, justifiably yet ominously promising “unforgiving retaliation.” Barack Obama has offered America’s assistance iin what he referred to it as “an attack on all humanity and the universal values we share.” American presidential hopefuls on either side of the party line have chimed in with both sympathy and distasteful politicizing of the tragedy.
As usual, politicians are jumping at the opportunity to build a platform out of bodies not yet cold. Both the American and European right are pointing fingers at France’s strict gun control policy, which presumably left civilians defenseless, and its loose border control, which allowed a distant enemy to become the enemy within. 
Poland has already backed out of the European Union’s plan to resettle throughout its member states 120,000 refugees from Syria, Iraq, and neighboring war-torn countries; other nations, especially in fairly homogenous Eastern Europe, will likely follow Poland’s example. In too many people’s minds, a toxic mixture of xenophobia, racism, and Islamophobia has equated Syrian refugees — along with millions of peaceful Muslims — with a few thousand jihadist extremists from ISIS and al Qaeda. We can only expect more pogroms, burning of mosques, and anti-Muslim discrimination. 
This is victim blaming at its worst. Just like the Parisians, Syrian refugees have experienced first-hand the violence and destruction of ISIS. They did not willingly leave their homeland to “infiltrate” Europe; they were driven from it by ISIS, as much their enemy as ours. Persecuting them for jihadist brutalities is the equivalent of arresting a black pastor for the actions of the Ku Klux Klan. As Obama has stated, and virtually every major Muslim organization has vehemently asserted, the “Islamic State” is neither a state nor true to the principles of Islam. 
In light of this, an increasing number of world leaders — including President Hollande and U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry —are abandoning use of the group’s chosen name altogether. Its alternative title is “Daesh,” a derogatory term that translates in Arabic to either “trample down and crush” or “bigot.” ISIS hates it, reportedly threatening to cut the tongues out of any mouth that utters it. According to Arabic translator Alice Guthrie, “They hear it, quite rightly, as a challenge to their legitimacy: a dismissal of their aspirations to define Islamic practice, to be 'a state for all Muslims' and — crucially — as a refusal to acknowledge and address them as such." Because the group is illegitimate, a desecration of Islam, I choose to refer to them as Daesh from here forward. 
Now is the time to find compassion for all victims of extremism, both the Parisians and the Syrian refugees who will be an international scapegoat for their deaths. Beyond that, closing borders and hearts to Muslims plays directly into jihadist hands. Daesh’s main method of recruitment is Western Islamophobia. They want to turn the West against Muslims. They want to point to the West and say, “See, they do hate you.” There is no better way to grow their ranks and, eventually, incite an all-out global conflict. 
What happened in Paris this weekend should be too horrible to conceive. It’s horrible how numb the world has grown, how callously politicians and journalists build their platforms and think pieces on someone else’s nightmare. But we must continue to fight against the worst tragedy of all: turning our backs on the victims and calling them the enemy.
