After overcoming Thomas More 4–2 in the previous round, Carnegie Mellon faced Medaille College in an epic second-round match. 
Neither team played very aggressively in the first half. Every Carnegie Mellon attempt to attack was shut down by a disciplined Medaille backline and defensive midfield. Both teams had a few half-chances, but the score remained 0–0 at halftime. Off the pitch, the largest crowd that Gesling Stadium had seen this year was beginning to get very aggravated with some of the referee’s decisions. A combination of this aggravation from both Carnegie Mellon and Medaille fans effected the need for University Police to watch over the fans for the rest of the game.
The tension continued to build in the second half, as both teams began playing a physical game. Halfway into the second half, Tartan goalie and senior Maks Khurgin picked up an injury and had to leave the game. First-year goalie Zach Stahl came in to take his place. Medaille committed reckless fouls throughout the second half, and finally the referee made his biggest decision of the game by rewarding Carnegie Mellon a penalty kick. Senior Ryan Browne buried the penalty to the opposite side of the Medaille goalkeeper’s dive, scoring his third goal in the NCAA tournament.
The Tartans went on to win the game 1–0 and will play Calvin College in the NCAA Great Lakes sectional semifinals in Gesling Stadium, with kickoff set for 7:30 p.m. this Friday.

Expectations were high for the men’s soccer team as they went into the NCAA Division III men’s soccer tournament with an impressive 14–2–1 record for the season and ranked second in the Great Lakes region by the NCAA. 
As a result of their success during the regular season, Carnegie Mellon was granted the right to host the first two rounds of the NCAA tournament. Carnegie Mellon played Thomas More College in the first round. The Tartans could also potentially get revenge on their Great Lakes rival, Ohio Wesleyan University, in the sectional finals, who two months ago gave Carnegie Mellon its worst defeat of the season.
Carnegie Mellon’s first match of the tournament against Thomas More proved to be an exciting one. Right from the beginning, both teams came out playing a very fast-paced game in search of the first goal. 
After some quick pressure from Thomas More, Carnegie Mellon answered back by netting the first goal of the game. Senior forward and University Athletic Association (UAA) Player of the Year Ricky Griffin was able to find fellow senior Ryan Browne with a short pass behind the defense, and Browne was able to do the rest. To the Tartans’ surprise, Thomas More came back with an impressive attack themselves four minutes later, as Carnegie Mellon senior goalkeeper Maks Khurgin was forced to make a tough save. The Tartans were not able to take advantage of their one-goal lead as Thomas More was finally able to score in the 36th minute.
The Tartans came out in the second half very eager to win the game and move on to the next round of the tournament. 
The Tartans elevated their level of play and tore up Thomas More’s back line with some excellent passing. The buildup led to a great effort by senior Pat Lutz to score Carnegie Mellon’s second goal of the game five minutes into the second half. Browne got his second of the game in the 65th minute and teammate senior Jon Simon secured the win four minutes later. Thomas More got a consolation goal toward the end of the match and Carnegie Mellon went on to win 4–2.
Carnegie Mellon played their second round game in Gesling Stadium this past Sunday. Details on the game will be available online Tuesday.

The Carnegie Mellon football team traveled to the Windy City last Saturday for their season closer against University Athletic Association (UAA) rival, University of Chicago. The Tartans fell to the Maroons with a score of 7–21, putting their season record at 5–5 and their UAA record at 1–2.
It was a scoreless first quarter, and Chicago tallied the first score of the game at the beginning of the second quarter. Chicago quarterback Marshall Olium connected with Dee Brizzolara for 28 yards and the touchdown. The extra point was good, putting the score at 0–7 with 14:11 left in the first half. The rest of the quarter was an equal battle and neither team scored. 
Despite the scoreless first half for the Tartans, they were not deterred and remained positive, as senior wide receiver Brendan Howe explained, “Our defense did a great job holding them to only seven points in the first half; unfortunately our offense couldn’t get anything going. Coming out after halftime, we knew we were still in the game and just had to do a better job protecting our quarterback and getting our running game moving.”
Coming out of the halftime break, the Maroons had a quick score, again with Olium finding Brizzolara — this time on a pass for 42 yards. With 8:20 left in the third quarter, Carnegie Mellon began to pick up momentum as the Cardinal and Gray made a 7-yard drive before pushing Chicago to a drive of -1 yard. 
Senior running back Andrew Lovrovich made several plays on the offensive end to spark the Tartans, until senior quarterback Phil Pantalone was sacked with 3:35 left in the quarter. Chicago picked up a quick seven points by the end of the third, making the score 0–21.
The Tartans came out strong for the final quarter. Capitalizing on a penalty called on Chicago for pass interference, sophomore running back Chris Garcia and junior fullback Justin Pratt rushed for 8 and 3 yards, respectively, to pick up the first down. On the next play, Pantalone found Howe for 19 yards and the touchdown. Junior kicker Elliot Carnevale’s attempt was solid and the Tartans were on the board, 7–21. Carnegie Mellon’s defense was able to stop Chicago from scoring for the rest of the game, but the Tartans’ offense could not make any gains either, even with a 38-yard drive.
Despite the loss to conclude the season, the Tartans are happy with how it developed. 
“We’ve had a lot of ups and downs throughout this season. When we play at our best we can match up toe to toe with anyone, but at times we hurt ourselves and come up short. I’m very satisfied with our season; we had a young team to start the year and I think we proved ourselves week in and week out,” Howe said.
Howe is also Carnegie Mellon’s single-season leader in receptions, tallying six for the game and ending the season with 50 receptions.
The Tartans have finished competition for the year, and will begin to prepare for the next season.

The Carnegie Mellon men’s basketball team hosted their first game on Sunday against St. John Fisher College, losing a close game 65–70. The starting line up consisted of senior co-captain Jack Anderson, juniors Matthew Pettit and Shane Rife, sophomore John Duhring, and first-year Christian Shepley. 
Other players who contributed to the team were seniors Jon Wolleben and Dan Lavallee and first-year guard Andre Moore.
After the first half, the Tartans trailed St. John Fisher with a score of 27–39. The team fought back in the second half and caught up to the Cardinals with 8:38 left in the half, pushing the score to 49–48. 
Unfortunately, the Tartans couldn’t hold off St. John Fisher and ended the game with a score of 65–70.
Rife led the team with 11 rebounds to go along with 17 points during his 36 minutes of play time. Pettit had 10 rebounds and Duhring raked in six. Duhring and Anderson each played 34 minutes of the game, with Pettit playing 33 and Shepley getting 27 minutes on the court. Duhring hit two of his 11 three-point shots and Anderson made two of six. Anderson also led the team with 20 points during the game.
The Cardinals gave up 12 turnovers during the game, while Carnegie Mellon only allowed seven.
Pettit observed during a pre-game discussion, “We’re all naturally excited for the game Sunday, being that it is the first game of the season. After two scrimmages, we have picked up on a lot of our mistakes and look to bring more intensity this week leading up to our game Sunday.” 
Anderson also commented on the game, “I do believe that our team is prepared for our first game on Sunday. We have worked extremely hard in the preseason, and have played two good scrimmages so far. We are excited to officially start the season and to see our hard work begin to pay off.”
The Tartans  hope their work pays off better next Friday and Saturday at the Wooster Tournament held in Ohio. 
The Tartans will play at 8 p.m. on Friday against Wooster, and will play either Heidelberg or St. Thomas on Saturday at 6 p.m.

The Tartans swimming and diving team competed at Grove City last Saturday. The women fell 138–158 while the men were able to pull out a win with a score of 176–124.
The team started out the individual events strong with sophomores Victoria Adams and Jen Sung placing first and second, respectively, in the 1000-yard freestyle. Senior Jonas Altman-Kurosaki also finished strong in the 1000 freestyle, placing first by over 11 seconds. Teammates first-year Brandon Yee and senior Gates Winkler followed in second and third.
Despite the sweeps, the Tartan men and women were surprisingly trailing going into the first diving break after the 50 freestyle, prompting team meetings. “We were down ... coming into the first break,” senior Sara Andrews said. “When we found that out, we definitely came together as a team by cheering and racing much better and harder.”
Junior Molly Evans had three victories on the day, taking the 200-yard freestyle with a pool-record time of 1:54.32 before winning the 200 backstroke in 2:07.87 and the 400 individual medley in 4:32.62. All three swims were provisional qualifying times for the 2010 NCAA championships. First-year Dorothy Yu also scored points for the Tartans, placing first in the 100 backstroke with a time of 1:01.80 and beating out Grove City’s Kate Wilt in the 200-yard breaststroke by just over a second with a time of 2:28.39. Sophomore Hannah Gonzalez tied the Wolverines’ Jenny Ryan in the 100-yard butterfly in 1:00.94.
Among other great swims for the Tartans were first-year Breanna Stillo placing second in the 100 breaststroke, Gonzalez and junior Rebecca Ussai finishing second and third in the 200 butterfly, respectively, and junior Brianne Burton finishing third in the 50 freestyle. For the men’s swim team, first-year Daniel Glaser-Garbrick had a solid race in the men’s 200 butterfly, placing first with a time of 1:56.69 and also winning the men’s 100 butterfly. Fellow teammate junior Alex Hanson also had a great day, winning the 200-yard backstroke and the 400 IM. Yee finished first in the 500 freestyle after barely touching second in a controversial 100 freestyle.
For the Tartans’ diving, sophomore Olivia DeFazio placed second with 179.25 points in the 3-meter diving, and the men’s team swept the competition, with senior Matt Kuhn placing first, sophomore Eli Fatsi taking second, and sophomore Mike Alexovich rounding out with third.
“We had a rough start to the meet, but we really managed to turn it around in the second half,” senior Jason Huber said. “It was great to see the way the team really rallied around each other and came together to win the meet. I think the performance of Brandon Yee in the 100 free and again in the 500 as well as that of our backstrokers coming up with a really big 1–2–3 finish in the 200 back really helped to get us back on track and jumpstart the team for the second half of the meet.”
The Tartans swim team will next be in action on Friday for their CMU Diving Invitational, and the swim team will be hosting a tri-meet at home on Saturday against Washington and Lee and the University of Rochester at 11 a.m.
Jonas Altman-Kurosaki is a Sports Co-Editor for The Tartan.

Last week, women’s college soccer made national headlines, but not for a championship, an outstanding player, or even a long goal. Instead, it was a five-minute montage of University of New Mexico junior defender Elizabeth Lambert kicking a ball at a defenseless opponent on the ground, punching an opposing player in the back, and — for the knockout blow — pulling an opponent to the ground by her ponytail. That video of her ferociousness even made its way past ESPN to the likes of CNN and other news networks. Of course, the University of New Mexico suspended Lambert indefinitely for her actions.
The day after that announcement, the University of Oregon reinstated their running back LeGarrotte Blount for his incident after a loss at Boise State. During the post-game handshakes, Blount landed a punch to the face of a Boise State player. A few seconds later, while being escorted out of the stadium, he proceeded to start yelling at the home fans, threatening to charge into the stands. And here’s the punch line: This was during college football’s Sportsmanship Week.
Unsportsmanlike behavior is even worse in the professional ranks. In a game played in polo shirts and khakis, its greatest player Tiger Woods can be heard dropping F-bombs after a tee shot landing in the rough. Bill Belichick, the coach with the highest winning record of the New England Patriots, cannot even properly congratulate or shake hands with the opposing coach after a loss.
And yet Blount still gets to play football for Oregon, Woods gets to win his majors, and Belichick is still regarded as one of the greatest coaches. With that, it’s only a matter of time before Lambert is reinstated to her team.
All these stories have the same timeline. ESPN will play the clip at least 30 times during  SportsCenter and its  sports talk shows. It’ll be discussed by the sports writers and pundits the next day. Then, a public apology is issued by the offender or, for the inarticulate or unapologetic, through an agent. Then some governing body issues a fine or suspension. A month or so later, when everything has quieted down, the offender gets to return to his or her glory.
If anything, that timeline reflects today’s simple philosophy in sports: If you can play, you are going to play. Those tasteless gestures mean little to the coach or the fan. They reflect you as a person, but if you can shoot three pointers or drive a ball 700 yards, you can keep that sailor’s mouth. There are consequences, but they are not nearly severe enough because the fans just do not care.
Are the students going to boycott football games because their starting running back decided to start a post-game boxing match? Are fans going to stop paying ridiculous prices for tickets to the next game? The answer to both is a resounding no.
Speaking of fans, they are guilty as well. Sporting events have transformed from a day for the entire family to a guy’s day out at the bar. Try rooting for the Bengals at Heinz Field; if you do not attract racial slurs, swear words directed at your poor mother, or an invitation to a fight, you probably took the wrong exit on the expressway. The best part is, the fans still pay top dollar for a ticket.
In the huge business of sports, money drives everything, and if there is anything Hollywood can teach us, it’s that bad feelings equals more ratings. That only explains why the highlights of Philadelphia Phillies pitcher Pedro Martinez’s performances at Yankee Stadium are his plunking of Derek Jeter and his infamous takedown of then-Yankees bench coach Don Zimmer. Fans barely recognize the 11 wins and 3.20 ERA against the Yankees, of all teams.
Let’s face it — indecency in sports is here to stay, whether the parents, motivational speakers, and old traditionalists like it or not. Embracing the idea would set sports back to the Russell Crowe [ITAL]Gladiator[ITAL] days. Scoffing at every unnecessary touchdown dance gives you a seat at Bingo Night in the senior center. So for now, tolerance would be the best solution. This trend may die out like those attractive short-shorts of the NBA of yesteryear. Or it could be the future of sports, where every player’s career can be chronicled in outrageous autobiographies and movies.
Whatever the result may be, this new age of indecency and bad sportsmanship has done some good for sports. There is no bigger motivation in sports than a kick in the face or a challenge to a player’s manhood. Sports fans would have missed out on the likes of basketball great Michael Jordan. Fortunately, Jordan returned the favor by criticizing and belittling all his opponents and even some of his coaches and teammates in his Hall of Fame induction speech.
If Michael Jordan can teach us one thing other than his basketball skills, it’s that the jury is still out on this new book of sports etiquette. The future of sports will be the only determinant of the success or the failure of this era in sports. If successful, sports will continue to gain in popularity and they may replace other entertainment industries, such as movies. Failure of this era will turn sports into an obscure part of our culture followed by societal outcasts.
However, for now, it’s going to be the same repetitive argument every time a sucker punch is thrown, a ponytail is pulled, or a bleeped out tirade is played on SportsCenter. Hopefully, this is start of what basketball enthusiast President Obama would call change we can believe in.

On Saturday, the Carnegie Mellon cross country team competed in the Mideast Regional in Bethlehem, Pa. Hosted by Muhlenberg College, and with over 300 athletes competing on both the men's and women's side, the Tartans were set up for a competitive day. The men competed in an 8k, placing second overall, while the women ran a 6k and came in seventh at the Regional. This being their final meet before NCAAs, the Tartans set out to achieve impressive results.
The top performances for the men came from sophomore Matt Jacob (third, 25:09), junior J.P. Allera (12th, 25:28), junior Dan Addis (14th, 25:31), junior Nate Bussiere (19th, 25:39), and finally junior Justin Kurp (21st, 25:48).
Due to their outstanding results this season, the men's cross country team will continue on to NCAAs.
The women were not as successful, however, with only two Tartan runners in the top 15 — first-year Emily Wobb (sixth, 21:54) and junior Courtney Baker (13th, 22:25).
Wobb's sixth place finish at the Regional sets her up to receive an at-large individual bid to compete at NCAAs.  
The NCAA Division III Cross Country Championship will be held next Saturday in Cleveland, Ohio for both the men and women.

In only her first year at Carnegie Mellon, Emily Wobb is already making the most of life as a busy student athlete. Between balancing the challenging first courses of a major in fine arts and bonding with her dorm-mates over her projects, Wobb has been a top performer for the Tartan women’s cross country team. Earlier this season, Wobb was recognized by the University Athletic Association (UAA) as the Women’s Cross Country Athlete of the Week when she finished first at the Waynesburg Invitational, helping the team take first place out of eight teams.
This past weekend, Wobb led the Tartans to a seventh place finish out of 44 teams at the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) Mideast Regional held at Muhlenberg College. 
Finishing in sixth place overall individually, Wobb earned an at-large bid to the NCAA Division III Women’s Cross Country Championship meet and the chance to extend her superb season.
Cross country has served other purposes for Wobb besides giving her an outlet for athletic success. Although she tried lacrosse in middle school, Wobb gave cross country a chance at the urging of her stepfather. She said, “He said he would leave it up to me to continue or not. After I ran my first race, I was hooked.”
Wobb said that the friendliness and acceptance from her teammates and peers at Carnegie Mellon has given her more confidence to tackle her schoolwork, and that the schedule of practices and traveling to meets has allowed her to focus on time management. Wobb is also thankful for the nonjudgmental attitudes she has been greeted with from the people she has met, which is one of the best things she has experienced so far in her first year of college.
After a strong first season with cross country, Wobb plans to stay involved with indoor and outdoor track. While she is still not sure where she would like to end up for a career, Wobb still has plenty of time to work hard at school and enjoy her impressive performances on the cross country trails.

You do not lie to Frank Marsh. There is no point, because he will know when you’re lying. It is his job to know. A former Marine Corps intelligence officer, Marsh now studies the ways in which people deceive others and themselves. Last Thursday, Marsh gave a lecture about how to detect lies and the ways in which people demonstrate their true intentions with every word and deed.
As one would expect from an expert in understanding people, Marsh knew how to play the crowd. Skilled in the art of deadpan, he had people rolling in the aisles without ever actually seeming anything less than serious. His vivid, sometimes disturbing descriptions certainly brought out his guiding principle: “What you say tells me what you see; what you see tells me what you think; what you think tells me who you are.” Marsh spent much of his lecture discussing the importance of words, saying, “By your words you’ll be justified; by your words you’ll be condemned.” He noted that word choice subconsciously conveys intent, pointing out that when one takes the elevator to the top floor of a 50-story building, the verb used is that one “went” to the top floor, but after climbing the stairs to the top of the same building, the verb is that one “got” to the top floor.
Marsh demonstrated the fact that people use incorrect grammar to subconsciously mark something as bad and to distance themselves from it. Also, he showed how lying, obfuscating, and concealing things requires a form of “verbal surgery” where the omissions and deceptions can be seen, just like the scars of a physical surgery. But omissions are not the only ways that people give themselves away: Liars will also include excessive detail in their descriptions in an effort to convince the listener. When he talked about detecting lies, Marsh said that everybody must follow Miller’s Law, which states: “If you want to tell if someone is telling the truth, you must believe that what they are saying is, in fact, true.” Marsh said that studies have shown that police officers and other people who are suspicious by nature or training are actually much worse at spotting lies accurately. This is because even liars tell the truth more than 90 percent of the time. Indeed, most people lie by omission rather than by commission, in that they leave truths out more often than they add lies in. Marsh said that people must start with a mindset along the lines of “I know what you are telling me is the truth, but what is true of it?”  
Marsh then moved on to non-verbal clues that indicate deception. His strategy is to look for abnormal behavior as an indicator of deception. However, he stressed that the search for abnormal behavior is futile unless one knows what is normal and what is not for a particular person. That is to say that it is necessary to establish a baseline before actually saying anything about a person’s behavior. His approach to questioning involves asking a number of innocuous questions before moving on to the real, pressing ones. Marsh’s last point about behavior as an indicator echoes a fundamental principle of body language: that gestures must be studied in clusters and in context. Isolated gestures have no meaning. A single motion can mean many things. Thus, gestures must be grouped into related clusters and then analyzed. The same set of gestures performed by a man and a woman may mean different things. Likewise, the same set of gestures performed by people from different cultures may mean different things. Thus, context is also essential in looking at gestures.
Marsh is also a qualified handwriting analyst, and he walked the audience through the various techniques which he uses to analyze texts and their authors. He said, “A change in spacing and a change in slant are the two biggest indicators of deception in handwriting.” He also highlighted changes in sizing, tone, darkening, and pressure as ways to determine the mood and intent of a writer. Darkening and underlining can also be seen as a form of overcompensation, where authors attempt to direct attention away from the area they think is suspicious.

If you’re familiar with Sony technology, particularly the 2007 OLED digital TV, you’ve witnessed technology currently being refined by a team led by Carnegie Mellon University’s vice president for research, Richard McCullough. In addition to his duties as vice president for research — which include managing corporate research and campus-wide projects and overseeing student-inclusive research projects — McCullough manages his own spin-off company, Plextronics. Launched in 2002 by McCullough and its current CEO, Andy Hannah, Plextronics is based in Harmorville in the University of Pittsburgh Applied Research Park with a current staff of about 70 people.
The mission of the company — “Light. Power. Circuitry” — describes one of the company’s projects: the development of printable solar cells made completely out of plastic. McCullough points out the scope of this project: “Imagine plastic that can be coated on any surface that could be harnessing power outside and even in low-light conditions.” The other area of focus for Plextronics is display technology. The centerpieces of this technology are the organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs). Screens using OLEDs have paper-thin layers where displays can be made of plastic. The colors on such screens, according to McCullough, “turn out better than plasma.” The OLED technology improves upon the contemporary liquid crystal display (LCD) technology by correcting for viewing angle problems. With LCDs, one cannot see the screen unless one is sitting directly in front of it, due partially to a series of liquid crystal pixels located behind the screen either allowing or prohibiting light produced by the device to pass through.
In OLED technology, such liquid crystal pixels are not used, allowing much better visual effects while employing little energy. Light emitting diodes have been in existence for a while — similar technology is used in red-light clock radios — but only recently have they been made with organic materials. Organic diodes require much less arduous work than do inorganic, which need to be processed in a clean room. Research has been a challenging process. Swati Varshney, a senior chemistry major and member of McCullough’s research team, has worked on synthesizing materials for OLEDs and solar cells. She worked on a polymer that could emit a stable, bright white light. She modified the molecular structure of polyfluorene, a fluorescent blue substance that, despite having a high quantum yield, decomposes in current LED applications. 
“I modified the reaction to give ‘living’ conditions, meaning we could get polyfluorene molecules with uniform chain length [so] that they can ... stack properly,” said Varshney. This means that the polymers could be more easily made into thin films to make OLEDs. When other reactive monomers  —  simpler molecules — are added to polyfluorene, the reaction produces tunable colors. The result is a stunning visual. Another problem in the process was removing organic molecules from the gold circuit board responsible for printing the images. Junior chemistry major Rebecca Potash worked on a deposition process that would detach organic molecules while leaving the circuit itself unaltered. By creating these thin, flexible electronics, the gold patterns can be “backed” directly onto the circuit while cutting down on cost and energy.
Television only scratches the surface in applicable technology, however. OLED has the potential to improve any technology that uses high-resolution micro-displays, including computer screens and mobile phones. In the future, McCullough and Hannah will look to commercializing OLEDs, as well as their solar cells and inks, while increasing their efficiency and lowering their cost. Solar cells have a promising future. Instead of the traditional silicon, which is costly and time-consuming to use, organic molecules could be used to make solar cells effectively and cheaply. This would be, according to Varshney, especially useful for applications in developing countries. “For example, solar-powered OLEDs could provide low-cost lighting to children in sub-Saharan villages so that they could study past sunset after school or work,” Varshney said, citing a presentation from the Pople Lectures held at the Mellon Institute in September.

Since its introduction in 2005, Pandora Radio has steadily developed a strong following. Internet radio has been around since before Pandora, and many stations began to offer music recommendation services, gently directing the listener to other songs they might find interesting based on the tastes of other listeners. Pandora Radio differs from other Internet radio stations in that song recommendations are unique to each user. Pandora allows its users to choose paths of music they find personally tasteful. Notably, none of these recommendations are based on the preferences of other users.
The Music Genome Project was started in January 2000 with the aim of studying all music at a fundamental level. The project aimed to categorize all music based on certain basic musical traits. Five years of research led to a means to do just what they set out to achieve. To date, the Music Genome Project has identified nearly 400 musical traits. Some of these are commonly understood — acoustic rhythm guitars, repetitive chorus — while most others are more complex. These are referred to as “genes.” The project breaks down each song into its component genes. The genes may vary from song to song, with rock music having fewer genes than a classical piece. Each of the selected genes is then assigned a value between one and five in increments of one-half, with higher values indicating a stronger presence of that particular musical trait.
The bank of songs that Pandora uses to select and make recommendations is called the library. This library, according to the Pandora team, consists mainly of English songs and has well over half a million songs, with more being added every day. Approximately 15,000 songs are added to the library every month. Before it is added to the library, a song is studied by a trained analyst who lists the various genes associated with the song. The entire genetic structure of a song is identified in about 20 minutes. Knowing the genes of a particular song, a computer creates a simulated spatial representation. This is done by a classifier program. The function of this program is to identify the song by its spatial genetic representation. When a listener inputs a personal favorite, the system studies the characteristics of the song and creates a vector based on its genes. This vector then points to the next song having similar genes arranged in space in a similar manner. In addition to this method of recommending songs to the listener, Pandora allows the listener to provide feedback to the program, indicating an interest or dislike for a particular song. Allowing the program to recommend songs without providing any feedback to it can result in highly varied song recommendations. A rock song could theoretically point to a classical music piece. The recommendations allow the user to remain within the general area of their personal musical interests.
Submitting a “Thumbs Up” vote causes the program to select and play songs that more closely resemble the song currently playing, while a “Thumbs Down” vote bans the song from the station temporarily and also avoids similar music when making new recommendations. Another constraint on the songs played stems from the music license issues. Pandora is not allowed to play songs “on demand,” replay songs, or play more than four songs by the same artist in an hour. Songs cannot be skipped more than six times an hour or more than 20 times in a day, depending on the kind of subscription.
As Pandora depends on a human analyst — at present, at least — the costs incurred are higher than most other Internet radios. To counter this problem, Pandora Radio offers a free as well as paid listening experience. The former allows only 40 hours of music a month interspersed with advertisements.
Pandora Radio’s Internet presence allows it to be highly accessible by today’s generation of mobile phone users. Over time, Pandora has created a number of desktop gadgets and applications for phones to allow listeners to tune in on the go. Tim Westergren, the founder of Pandora Radio, told the Chicago Tribune how effective releasing a single Pandora mobile phone application was. Within the first 10 days of releasing the application in July 2008, Pandora listeners doubled to 40,000 a day.

Try and imagine this peculiar scenario — you are laying in your bed, about to fall asleep after a long day, when suddenly you are jolted awake by a bright flash of light and the intense sound of a cannon shooting right in your own room. Puzzled and shocked, with your heart racing, you look around anxiously for the source of the noise only to realize that there was no cannon, and that it had originated from within your own head.
This is typical of the strange disorder known as exploding head syndrome, a condition that causes a person to hear an incomprehensibly loud noise that is merely a vivid auditory hallucination. 
However, unlike the name suggests, heads do not actually explode, and it does not usually cause the sufferer any physical harm. In some cases, however, a sharp stabbing pain can accompany the sound. The sound varies between people with this condition, having been described as a loud explosion, waves crashing, people screaming, or a loud ringing, among others. 
People with exploding head syndrome usually report hearing the noises one or two hours after going to sleep. However, these sounds can also happen when waking up from a deep sleep, and during the day when the sufferer is wide awake. This shows that exploding head syndrome is not a sleep disorder. Many people who hear the noises have associated them with certain scenarios, as these hallucinations sound so real: The noises sound like a train is going through the room, a car is crashing outside, or someone is firing a gun next to their head.
Although these hallucinations are thought to be harmless, a person who has heard the noise will develop anxiety and an accelerated heartbeat. Sudden, unexplained, and extremely loud noises would cause any person to be shaken; however, personal accounts reveal that sometimes the related anxiety is not due to the sound itself, but rather is a physical reaction that may happen some time after the noise. Hearing the sound may actually feel as if a pressure were being relieved from inside the head. Along with the bright flash of light that is known to accompany the noises, muscle twitches and breathing difficulty are also associated with the noise.
Although exploding head syndrome may not cause adverse physical effects, it may lead to the sufferer being unable to sleep due to a fear of hearing the noise or experiencing the other symptoms. This may lead to other sleep disorders, such as insomnia. On the other hand, in some cases, the sufferer may actually become accustomed to the noise, and will no longer experience the anxiety and fear that usually develops after hearing the loud noises.
Currently, there is no known reason for the causes of these sounds. Some researchers have linked the syndrome to stress and sleep deprivation, as these are common among sufferers. Another explanation is a small seizure in the temporal lobe, which is a part of the brain that contains the cells responsible for hearing. A physical reason has also been proposed, explaining that a component of the middle ear or of the Eustachian tube may suddenly move. The Eustachian tube is responsible for the “popping” in the ear during pressure changes, like when one swallows during the descent of an airplane. 
Currently, tests are being done on people who suffer from exploding head syndrome. These may lead to insights on the phenomenon, as well as how the brain interprets noises. No pattern of occurrence can be discerned for exploding head syndrome, as its frequency may decrease or increase over time. Some report hearing a series of noises over the course of a few days before stopping completely, but then the noises will return a few months later. Some people experience exploding head syndrome only once in their lifetimes; for others, it is a recurring event that they gradually learn to control. However, a few general trends have been observed; for example, women experience exploding head syndrome more than men, and people over the age of 50 are more likely to have exploding head syndrome, although it has been reported in patients as young as 10.
Reducing the frequency of exploding head syndrome symptoms can be done indirectly, through stress management. In addition, time management has been shown to help, as it enables sufferers to sleep more, lessening their sleep deprivation. It has been reported that doing stress-relieving activities before sleeping can reduce the occurrence of hearing noises. These include yoga, meditation, hot baths, and walking. In some cases, clomipramine, a drug clinically shown to treat depression, has been shown to help the patients.

Future contacts include head-up display
Researchers at the University of Washington led by Babak Parviz are developing contact lenses that include the necessary components to produce virtual images in users’ eyes. The circuitry included in the lens projects an image directly into the eye, without blocking the field of vision. The devices can be powered by nearby radio sources. Eventually, the research team hopes that cell phones will be able to power the lenses at the same time they send content.
Current implementations of head-up displays often have a restricted area, but the technology under development by Parviz should be able to project images across the entire field of view. The applications range from recreational use and gaming to military information systems. While this technology is still only in the prototype stage, the team will be presenting their findings at the Biomedical Circuits and Systems conference this month.

Scientists find new dinosaur species
A team led by Adam Yates of Johannesburg’s University of the Witwatersrand has uncovered the bones of up to four new dinosaur species. The fossils were found in Spion Kop in the South African province of Free State, a location of many paleontological sites. While the team expected to find fossils from massospondylus, a common dinosaur of the area, they actually found bones from the species now named Aardonyx celestae. 
The significance of the Aardonyx find is that it fills a gap in the evolutionary history of dinosaurs. At one stage in their evolution, huge sauropods such as brontosaurus began to separate from the earlier bipedal dinosaurs. The Aardonyx specimens found were young, but Yates claims that an adult might have grown to 50 feet and weighed half a ton. Yates hopes that continued excavation at the site will reveal more about the other new species found.

NASA finds water on the moon
Scientists studying data returned by an October lunar mission announced Friday that they had definitive evidence of water near the lunar surface. The Lunar Crater Observation and Sensing Satellite (LCROSS) was a NASA mission that on Oct. 9 crashed a spacecraft into a crater near the moon’s south pole. Scientists projected that the impact would send a plume of debris several miles high. Since that time, the team has been working to analyze the data picked up by spectrometers, which can analyze the components of the plume.
After a month of work, Anthony Colaprete, the project’s lead scientist, announced that they had found over 25 gallons of water. This confirmed the long-held belief that water did exist on the lunar surface, and it encourages proponents of lunar colonies. Astronauts would be able to use existing resources instead of bringing everything they needed from Earth.

The ’20s were defined by short cropped hair and fringe-edged shifts while the power-obsessed ’80s were more represented by strong-shouldered jackets and full suits. Today’s fashion world, however, does not have such defining statement pieces. It goes without saying that new looks are still being created, but it is also undeniable that in recent times, thrift and vintage stores have grown in number and popularity. Clothes from long ago, as well as gently used and resold modern clothes, are getting just as much hype as new clothes that have just made it off the drawing board and onto the racks.
DIY (no power drills needed)
Another rising theme in fashion is the age-old motto of handyman dads and neighbors: DIY, or “do it yourself.” Today’s interpretation of DIY is a far cry from that of stubborn fathers and obnoxious neighbors armed with power tools; making your own jewelry, clothes, and accessories can be a great outlet for creativity, a way to relax with friends, and a perfect way to obtain high fashion looks without dishing out large amounts of money. DIY is also one of the best ways for creating a unique look: By making it yourself, you are ensuring that no one else will have it — unless a style spy is hiding in your closet as you break out your hot glue gun and sewing kit, but that’s unlikely.
Headbands
Materials needed: 
1 plain headband (preferably thick) 
1 bag of mixed jewels, feathers, ribbon, or lace 
1 hot glue gun
First check that your closet is clear of spies. Then plug in your glue gun so that it warms up and plan out your headband.
Feathered and jeweled headbands have been everywhere in magazines and stores, but it’s also possible to try out other ideas like wrapping a ribbon around the headband while leaving space between wraps so that both the color of the band as well as that of the ribbon are showing or by gluing small circles of pretty lace to the side of the band. By layering smaller circles of lace on top of larger ones, you can make the fabric look like little lace flowers.
One material that shouldn’t be mixed with headbands is glitter — that is, unless you like having sparkles in your scalp all day.
For jewels and feathers, thick headbands are definitely better to use because you have a larger area to work with, and both of these materials stick to cloth headbands better than plastic ones. With this in mind, you’re free to feather and bejewel to create a unique headband.
“Bib” necklaces
There has to be a more flattering name for this accessory. However, in spite of its title, this necklace is really unique, stunning, and surprisingly easy to make.
Materials needed: 
Cloth for the “back” of the necklace (mesh or felt are both preferable) 
Bag of mixed jewels or beads 
1 thick, silky ribbon 
1 hot glue gun 
1 pair of scissors 
Needle and thread
First, cut the “back” cloth into a pretty shape — this is like the base of the necklace, on which you will glue the jewels or beads, equivalent to the pendant part on a basic necklace. Shapes like half-moons or those resembling shirt collars (bibs) work well with this style.
Then, use the hot glue gun and decorate the cloth however you want — some suggestions include lining the edges of the cloth with smaller beads and filling the middle with chunky gems.
Once the glue has dried and the gems are secure, cut the silky ribbon in half and sew the edges to either side of the cloth shape.
You can adjust the size of the ribbon to however long you want the necklace to hang — this look is usually best when it hangs just over your collar bone, so adjust it as needed. Fasten the necklace by tying the ribbon behind your neck.
Braided scarves
By braiding yarn or jersey fabric, you can put a new spin on the typical knitted scarf that your grandma loves to make so much.
Materials needed: 
5 feet of fabric (jersey cotton or thick yarn) 
1 hot glue gun 
Scissors and a serrated knife
This DIY can by done in several ways. Feel free to experiment with the fabric choice — flowing mesh and other types work just as well as those suggested. You are free to buy fabric of the same color, or to pick three different colors.
Cut the fabric into thin strips, and separate it or the yarn lengthwise into three sections. Tie the edges of these strips together so that they resemble three ponytails. Braid these strips together, and then tie the ends together to create a braid of fabric. Wrap this around your neck to create a unique and gorgeous braided scarf. To create a less-finished look, use a serrated knife to rip the edges of the strips.
Vintage and resale
Another way to create a unique and classic style is to take advantage of the many thrift, vintage, and resale stores in the area. Pittsburgh has an amazing offering of vintage and resale stores that vary in price, style, and theme — all of which offer unique and inspiring pieces to add to your wardrobe. 
Avalon Exchange
5858 Forbes Ave. 412.421.2911
This shop is located in Squirrel Hill but has its roots in Oakland, where it was created in 1988 as a vintage clothing store. Today, its main focus is on the resale of contemporary pieces, but both old and new styles fill their shelves at very affordable prices. All kinds of fashion are sold here: shoes, coats, skirts, dresses, jewelry, and sunglasses. Apart from great pieces for everyday wear, Avalon Exchange also has amazing wigs and costumes for Halloween, and in addition to selling clothes, the store is a place where you can sell your old ones, too.
“Style is really what this store’s all about,” said Stuart McLane, the owner of the store. “Good style seems to last forever, and it’s about the attitude just as much as the clothes.” 
A great place to find affordable fashion from both the past and the present, Avalon Exchange also has locations in St. Louis, Mo. and Mt. Lebanon, Pa.
Hey Betty
5892 Ellsworth Ave. 412.363.0999
Located close to Walnut Street in Shadyside, this store has a great offering of genuine vintage clothing. Though the average price tag of this store is higher than Avalon Exchange, Hey Betty only sells genuine vintage pieces from the 1970s or older, so this is definitely a store for vintage lovers and those in search of statement pieces.
Owned by Michael Ferrucci and Sandera Lawton, Hey Betty has provided vintage dresses, coats, shoes, accessories, and jewelry for 21 years. The shop is covered from floor to wall with pieces of the past — a fluffy white crinoline hangs from the ceiling by the entrance, and jewelry covers the walls with silver, gold, and old gems.
According to Ferrucci, Hey Betty’s focus is “displaying the best of what we can find, and editing everything else out.” 
Offering everything from cowboy boots to vintage prom gowns, one of the special pieces found at Hey Betty is a black cocktail dress from the 1960s, which was owned by the first wife of Mel Tormé of the Mel-Tones.
Eons Fashion Antique 
5850 Ellsworth Ave. 412.361.3368
Just down the street from Hey Betty, Eons Fashion Antique sells mainly vintage fashion, although there are a few more modern pieces available as well.
Yet another great place to find unique fashion, the store is also covered from floor to ceiling with everything from purses to pearls. Military and fur coats line the walls, and the racks are full of dresses from various eras. Stands of turquoise and silver jewelry, vintage sunglasses, scarves, and earrings are in abundance near the register; everywhere you turn there are clothes and endless inspiration. Though slightly more expensive, Eons offers a great shopping environment and quality vintage clothing.
There is definitely a new appreciation for the uniqueness and timelessness of style in today’s society. Fashion today can be seen as a mix of lessons learned in the past and the progress of the future, a mix of personal interpretations and inspiration drawn from others, constantly moving forward but always remembering where we’ve been. As legend Yves Saint Laurent once said, “Fashion fades. Style is eternal.”

“Arrive in San Remo, Italy by 6 p.m. June 1 with minimal traveling luggage.” These were the instructions I received upon my acceptance as an English tutor with the Associazione Culturale Linguistica Educational (A.C.L.E.), based in northern Italy.
The organization was looking for young native English speakers from around the world to spend a summer leading camps for Italian children throughout the country. Although I have studied Italian at Carnegie Mellon for the past five semesters, the organization preferred to have students not familiar with the Italian language in order to force the children to practice their English skills. After one week of orientation aimed at familiarizing the tutors with interactive learning, we were broken into smaller groups and sent by train to towns somewhere in Italy.
At the train station, tutors were received by the camp director for that week. At that time, the tutors would be informed of their housing situation. I was fortunate to experience many different types of living situations. For my first camp, I got to live with a family in a house close to the school where the camp was held. The first night, I was introduced to the entire family — the mother, father, daughter, aunt, uncle, grandparents, and cousins — for an elaborate dinner authentic to Abruzzo.
The next week, my fellow tutors and I were given keys to a flat, right on the beach. Although I didn’t get my meals cooked by an Italian grandmother or have my clothes washed that week, every afternoon after camp was a relaxing evening on the beach with my new friends. 
When I thought that I had found paradise, I was met with the biggest surprise of the summer. Week three had me staying in a five-star resort on the Sorrento coastline, overlooking the beautiful island of L’Isola di Capri. Beyond the delicious food we had for lunch and dinner in the restaurant attached to the resort, our resort apartment had a theater setup, three bedrooms, two bathrooms, and a kitchen. There was nothing better than sitting by the pool with a book after camp and watching the sunset over the water. It was all too good to be true; the organization paid for travel expenses, living expenses, and would pay each tutor a couple hundred euro each week for their work.
I use the word “work” very loosely when describing my summer experience. Each morning would begin with greeting the campers (who ranged from six to 16 years old) and a group game, song, or warm up. After that, the campers would break into their smaller “classes,” where the tutors would lead a lesson on a grammatical topic. Lunch was served in a cafeteria and lasted anywhere from one to two hours. After lunch we would once again break into smaller groups and work on “Show Practice.” Every Friday, the campers would put on a short show in English for parents and community members. The show was a great way to get each camper involved and comfortable speaking in English. I hate to admit it, but sometimes I would feel sentimental after working with an incredibly talented or endearing group of campers.
Students in any discipline would benefit from the experience I was able to enjoy. Although tutoring Italian children in English has next to nothing to do with my information systems major, I was able to fully immerse myself in a foreign culture. The tutors I worked with and befriended came from countries all around the world: England, Scotland, Ireland, South Africa, Australia, New Zealand, and Canada are only some of the countries that sent tutors to the program. Eventually I adapted to talking with someone from Britain by describing where I go to “uni” and what I study.
By living with Italian families, it is possible to see the country from an Italian perspective. One week, I stayed with a top-rated chef in the Brescia region and ate the most expensive, delicious meal of my life at Vittorio’s elite restaurant with him and his family.
If you are interested in pursuing a similar experience, feel free to e-mail me at rh@cmu.edu or visit the A.C.L.E. website at www.acle.org.

Shortly after 10 a.m. last Saturday, the ToonSeum, Pittsburgh’s cartoon museum, opened the doors of its new location in the Cultural District, Downtown. About 25 visitors, mostly teenage boys, stood outside the entrance waiting for the ribbon to be cut and the new space to be unveiled. Joe Wos, executive director of the ToonSeum, spoke to the group before the event about the evolution of the museum from occupying a wing of the Children’s Museum of Pittsburgh on the North Side to moving into its own space.
After Wos’ speech, ToonSeum president and Pittsburgh Post-Gazette editorial cartoonist Rob Rogers (CFA ‘84) introduced former Pittsburgh mayor Sophie Masloff to perform the ribbon cutting. The dynamic between the two entertained the group, as Rogers had spent much of Masloff’s time in office caricaturing the mayor. The ceremony was soon complete, and the ToonSeum staff welcomed visitors into their new home.
The opening exhibit of the new ToonSeum appeals to both new cartoonists and those with decades of memories. This exhibit, Enchanted Drawings: A Century of Animation, even has something to offer visitors who are not comic enthusiasts. The collection includes such varied works as concept art for the Batmobile and pencil drawings of Dora the Explorer. Walking through the museum is like taking a trip through the development of some of the most beloved and iconic images in popular media. Also included is an animation desk from Disney’s early Hyperion Studio, above which hangs a drawing of Donald Duck.
Soon after the grand opening on Saturday, a more varied crowd started to filter through the 1000-square-foot museum. Patrons had the opportunity to talk to Masloff and Rogers, both of whom stayed to talk about the museum and sign Rogers’ new book — No Cartoon Left Behind. Some visitors remarked that they had come to know Masloff through the drawings of Rogers. Across the room, Wos drew personalized cartoons for visitors.
While its new space is a significant improvement over the old location, the museum still tries to fit a lot of content into a small space. With the visitors, press, and special guests that were present for the grand opening, the exhibit hall felt cramped at times, but on a normal day patrons will have plenty of room to admire the cartoons on the walls and the personal atmosphere.
According to its website, the ToonSeum is one of only three museums in the United States focusing on the cartoon arts — the other two are in New York City and San Francisco. While it was originally supported by its home in the Children’s Museum, its move is being financed largely by the Grable Foundation.
In recent months, the ToonSeum has collaborated with other cultural institutions in the city. During the G-20 summit in September, it co-sponsored the Drawn to the Summit exhibition at The Andy Warhol Museum (see “An artistic look at the G20,” from the Sept. 21, 2009 edition of The Tartan).
While the ToonSeum will not attract the crowds of visitors that the Carnegie Museums do, it still hopes to find its niche in Pittsburgh’s unique culture. The new location in the Cultural District means that passersby will be able to walk in and learn about a century of animation. Amateur and professional cartoonists alike will have a location to meet others and refine their craft. Like any small art museum, the ToonSeum will succeed with a small and dedicated group. In this case, however, anybody can walk through the museum and develop an appreciation for the art of animation.
The ToonSeum is located on the first floor of the Bruno Building at 945 Liberty Avenue. Visit www.toonseum.org or call 412.232.0199 for more information. Enchanted Drawings runs through Jan. 3, 2010.

The business world of the 1950s was apparently rife with men who did nothing but spit out a lot of pretty words — at least according to Shepherd Mead in How to Succeed in Business Without Really Trying. The book, originally published in 1952, satirized the corporate sector by reminding the reader that his attractive secretary may have been placed with him as a test, as someone may be “interested in her career” and wanted to tempt him.
The satirical humor was brought to life in a 1961 musical adaptation of the same name by Abe Burrows, Jack Weinstock, and Willie Gilbert. Last weekend, How to Succeed... opened in the Philip Chosky Theater to uproarious laughter.
In the play version, Mead’s original ideas were employed by J. Pierrepont Finch (played by senior drama major Skye Scott). Finch begins the show washing windows and reading Mead’s book. The narrator, voiced by Tony McKay (an associate professor in drama), tells him he can build his way up to running a large company.
Through the first act, Finch succeeds in becoming vice president of advertising for World Wide Widgets by following the advice in his book, which, unfortunately, tells him in the second act that only a brilliant idea can save him. Finch now must rely on his own abilities to carry him onward in the company.
While he is building his career, Finch is supported by a secretary at the company — Rosemary (played by senior drama major Lora Lee Gayer) — who took a liking to him when he first bumped into company president J.B. Biggley (played by senior drama major Chase Newell).
Gayer, simply put, stole the show. This high-belting, extremely expressive actress drew eyes and ears to her every time she was on stage. A sharp twang to her voice brought to mind Broadway and television star Kristen Chenoweth, which was only supported by her comedic timing and charming carriage.
The minute details of the casting were on point for each character, from the threatening scratch Newell added in his voice to the perfect permanent scowl worn by senior drama major Tess Soltau in the role of Biggley’s secretary, Miss Jones. Even the short stature of senior drama major Nick Cosgrove embodied the insignificant pest that was his character, Bud Frump, the president’s good-for-nothing nephew.
In some songs — such as “Coffee Break” — the choreographic timing, especially on moments intended to be synchronous, tended to falter; however, overall the dances only added to the adorableness of the show. For “The Company Way,” Scott and senior drama major Ty Michael Robinson (as Twimble, the head of the mailroom) box-stepped on time and with gusto.
Director Daniel Goldstein truly took every advantage to play up the charm. Near the end of the first act, when Finch and Rosemary first kiss, lighting effects suggesting fireworks went up on the back of the stage. Some attempts were slightly over the top, such as the spotlight on Finch when he had a particularly successful moment, accompanied by brief chime from the pit; nevertheless, How to Succeed... never failed to win the hearts of its audience.

Saturday night, hip hop lyricist Aesop Rock performed at Wiegand Gym, and opening for him was a hip hop duo from the Midwest — The Cool Kids.
The Cool Kids is an alternative hip hop group consisting of two young men, Antoine “Mikey Rocks” Reed and Evan “Chuck Inglish” Ingersoll. The band took the stage and began their performance with some of their well-known songs. The audience members played their part and sang along, screaming and making the concert memorable. The Cool Kids even gave the audience a taste of the music that will be coming out with their new album, which is scheduled to be released in spring 2010. Look for The Cool Kids’ new album and hear their music on MySpace at www.myspace.com/thecoolkids.
Following a great performance, Aesop Rock took the stage and put on another fantastic show. The hip hop artist was originally born Ian Matthias Bavitz in 1976 in Long Island, N.Y., and emerged during the new wave of underground and alternative hip hop during the late 1990s and early 2000s. He is currently signed to Definitive Jux label and is a member of The Weathermen. He says that the name “Aesop” came from a character he played in a movie, and it stuck. The “rock” part came from being in so many of his rhymes.
Aesop Rock is a very unique artist and has tattoos on his forearms: The one on the left arm says “Must Not Sleep,” and the one on the right says “Must Warn Others.” He takes these lines from the 1956 sci-fi movie Invasion of the Body Snatchers and used them in his lyrics in the chorus of his song “Commencement at the Obedience Academy.”
Aesop’s lyrics are sometimes seen as complex and abstract, but the interpretation is subjective. Different styles and kinds of people showed up to hear his performance, and he captured the crowd, getting the audience swaying and bopping to his lyrics. “Even if it’s not laid out in perfect sentences — is any rap? — you’d have to be an idiot to not at least grasp a few things from these songs. Or have had no interest in pulling anything from them in the first place,” he said, commenting on his lyrical style.
Aesop Rock’s music is available for all to hear on his MySpace page at www.myspace.com/aesoprockwins along with several videos that give the fans an inside look into who he is off stage.

Among the many new album releases coming out this winter, Switchfoot and Dashboard Confessional are two relatively big names that, though not new to the music scene (Switchfoot’s first CD was released in 1997, Dashboard’s in 2000), are still producing fresh music.
The boys of Switchfoot released their seventh album, Hello Hurricane, this past Tuesday. The San Diego group has been able to mix guitar-driven pop-rock songs and heartfelt ballads on the same CD for the past decade, and Hello Hurricane is no exception. This is the band’s seventh studio album and it comes just under two years after their previous release, Oh! Gravity, which was met with mixed reviews.
If some of the lyrics seem to allude to religion, it’s no accident. Foreman’s a devoted Christian, and he allows his beliefs to influence his music, but not define it. “Calling us ‘Christian rock’ tends to be a box that closes some people out and excludes them. And that’s not what we’re trying to do,” he said in an interview with the Boston Globe, regarding the pigeonholing of a band to a genre.
If you’re looking for a 49-minute undulation of sounds, then Hurricane is definitely for you. Foreman’s rough voice suits the heavier songs (“Mess of Me,” “Bullet Soul”), but turns soft — and still powerful — as he croons about life and love (“Enough to Let Me Know,” “Always”). When Hurricane’s songs lack guitar riffs, they are quickly made up by Foreman’s inspirational, mature, and poetic words.
Sure, the band tried to change their style a bit this time around, but Hurricane is powerful enough to attract new listeners and keep old fans smiling.
Also released this past Tuesday was Dashboard Confessional’s latest project, Alter the Ending. It’s the band’s sixth album, though frontman Chris Carrabba also sang with the band Further Seems Forever, formed before Dashboard’s beginnings. Time has allowed Carrabba to mature not only vocally, but also lyrically. In the band’s early years, they were often labeled as the face of emo music, but with their recent releases, they’ve gained a wider audience. With Alter the Ending, the band keeps some of its signature summery motifs (“We watched the sun burn down into cinders”) while extending into somber metaphors about sticking together (“There’ll be ash and dust to bury us but I will keep you clean”).
There are some “typical” Dashboard songs for the fans — simple arrangements of verses with gradual build-ups to a peppy, catchy chorus where Carrabba tells the world, “Life is always hard for the belle of the boulevard.”
Songs like “Water and Bridges” and “I Know About You” reflect the album’s being more guitar-driven than previous releases (most notably, 2007’s The Shade of Poison Trees, which featured a total, bare-bones, stripped-down, start-to-finish acoustic set list), but the change isn’t overwhelming, as every song dedicates itself to its words and vocals.
After the band takes listeners on 39 minutes of a musical journey, Dashboard sends them off with the pleasant closer, “Hell on the Throat,” which introduces strings into the album’s instrumentation. And so Alter the Ending ends, unless listeners have picked up the deluxe edition, which has a second disc in which the band performs acoustic versions of all 12 songs. 
Check out the bands that brought you “Dare You to Move” and “Screaming Infidelities” in their 2009 new releases. Hello Hurricane and Alter the Ending are two thumbs-up albums that are definitely worth a listen.

These days, people are starting to become more and more aware of the environment. They try to buy products that are more environmentally friendly in every aspect, and fashion is no exception. Every year, eco-friendly materials appear on the runway; however, many people are not used to eco-fashion and are not really sure what it is. Here is a brief introduction to eco-fashion and some tips on how to translate eco-friendliness to your own wardrobe.
Eco-friendly clothes are made of raw organic materials that do not use pesticides. In addition, they do not involve the use of harmful chemicals or bleaches to color the fabric. These materials are often made from recycled and reused textiles. High-quality garments can be made from second-hand clothes and even recycled plastic bottles. Finally, eco-friendly clothes are made in a fair trade environment. People involved in the process of making these materials are treated and paid fairly. 
Hemp
The textile with the highest potential for being eco-friendly is hemp. The ecological footprint of hemp is significantly smaller than any other fabric. Hemp plants grow quickly and densely, so it makes it difficult for weeds to interfere with the harvesting. The use of pesticides and other chemicals is also greatly reduced. In addition, hemp does not require much water, so no irrigation is needed. Hemp fibers are naturally long and require minimal spinning and processing work. Thus, hemp is very eco-friendly and long lasting. If you are interested in hemp clothing, try www.hempest.com. The site offers organic hemp clothing, accessories, gear, paper, food, and body care products. They have anything you can imagine in hemp.
Organic cotton
More farmers are getting involved with organic cotton — the process of growing cotton in which, during the growing cycles, farmers do not use pesticides, herbicides, or insecticides. Moreover, in the process of manufacturing clothes from organic cotton, producers use natural dyes to reduce the amount of artificial chemicals. In recent years, new cotton growing techniques have emerged that grow colored cotton. The process naturally grows cotton in shades of blue, green, and other colors. In fact, the color of the cotton gets more vibrant as the clothes are washed. Loomstate (Loomstate.org), a clothing brand based in New York City, uses 100 percent certified organic cotton from various regions of the world such as Turkey, Peru, Africa, India, and the United States in all their clothes. They were also featured at Barneys New York.
Soy silk
Soy silk is a byproduct from making tofu. The liquefied proteins are extruded into fibers that are then spun and used like any other fiber. It is easy to purchase this silk yarn and make your own scarves or sweaters. Try www.soysilk.com to order some. The high protein content makes it easier to dye colors, so you can even create your own color.
Bamboo
It may be surprising, but bamboo is actually highly renewable grass. Because it is highly renewable, it is classified as eco-friendly. Bamboo grass also has natural antibacterial properties so it is easily biodegradable. If you want to see what kind of clothing can be made out of bamboo grass, check out www.organicbambooclothing.com. They offer a variety of clothing made from bamboo.
Wool
Wool can be an eco-friendly material as long as conscious effort is made in processing. With high emphasis on productivity and speed, wool is produced from factory-farmed sheep. These sheep live miserable lives and their handlers do not care for the condition of these sheep. It is common to cut off a sheep’s nose in the shearing process. With a responsible, eco-friendly manufacturer, most of these issues can be alleviated and truly eco-friendly wool can be produced.

This past weekend’s temperatures reached the 60s, but it was snowflakes and sparkles at the Benedum Center as The Radio City Christmas Spectacular opened for its two-month run. The Rockettes, in all of their kick-line glory, are performing in Pittsburgh until Dec. 6. The two-hour-long show is a whirlwind of Christmas motifs: Santa arrives by sleigh but is upstaged by a sugarplum fairy bear, and Christmas shoppers — like models in a Gap commercial in bright scarves — hurry through New York City streets to find that last gift.
The Rockettes’ oldest and most famous routine is that of the wooden soldiers. Included in the Spectacular since 1933, it is a seven-minute test of the Rockettes’ uniformity. In high-waist, white sailor pants and red military jackets, the line moves about the stage creating star and circle patterns, culminating in a domino effect with each toy soldier falling down on the other.
Christina Larson-Hauk, who has been with the Rockettes for 10 seasons, spoke about the rigor of the Rockette dance regimen. “We rehearse for about three weeks before we open in Pittsburgh, six days a week for seven hours per day. We rehearse for a good portion of the morning, lunch break, and then the rest of the night. We break everything down. Go over every little step — it’s very tedious. We run things over and over again to get up our stamina,” she said, explaining how the troupe perfects the uniform look for which it is famous.
Although most of the cast was trained in ballet, jazz, or tap, Larson-Hauk emphasized that the Rockette style is so much different than any other. “It’s its own beast — its own style. Getting it into your body is difficult on top of trying to be in line, be on the right number. Then, of course, you have the directors and dance captains in the front,” she said.
Not only does a Rockette have to be a fully trained dancer, she must fit the “look” as well. Larson-Hauk is 5'9" tall but says that dancers’ heights range between 5'6½" and 5'10½", with shorter ladies at the end in order to create the optical illusion of a line of identical dancers.
While for most of us, the Christmas season ends with the new year, Larson-Hauk attends charity functions and promotes the Spectacular year round. “It’s definitely an honor to say I’m a Radio City Rockette,” she said.
The fact that the show is called a “spectacular” is not an inaccuracy. The closing scene is that of the Nativity, with live camels and farm animals accompanying the actors onstage, and although this is the most dazzling effect of the night, it is also the most out of place.
The first hour and 40 minutes of the show was an exaggerated spoof of the Christmas holiday — with “little people” playing elves and actors, dressed in various animal costumes, reenacting a dance from *The Nutcracke*r ballet — so the stark change to religious history is unsettling.
Nonetheless, for those who break out their Christmas decorations at Halloween and who are in contention with their Housefellow for permission to put up a personal dorm Christmas tree, this performance is not to be missed. For everyone else, take your children someday.
Radio City Christmas Spectacular starring The Rockettes performs at the Benedum Center through Dec. 6. Contact the box office for tickets at 412.456.6666.

If sex is considered as impersonal as a handshake, I’m worried about what people are coming to think of music. The MP3 has been getting around for almost a decade now. In the beginning, MP3s moved through a point of contact; people exchanged mixed CDs looking for new music. People talked about their musical choices. They exchanged their musical intuitions. It was wonderful; it was convenient; and it never cost anything.
Nowadays, moving music around is so much less personal. People are searching through the Internet reading blogs, articles, Tumbles, and Tweets, searching for good music instead of sitting down and finding it themselves. Any song can be found and downloaded off some file-sharing website on the Internet. It’s all too cheap.
People aren’t finding new music together. With sex, at least someone else is there, but with music, we’re looking for action from something as impersonal as a computer.
Music has become a private affair — almost too self-indulgent. People aren’t exploring their boundaries. They’re just finding more and more of what they already know they like. What are we going to do next? Take music off MP3s and remix it ourselves?
Obviously, that’s what we’ve come to do. Remixes and samples abound in music right now. It’s getting a little old now, though. Originally, remixes seemed like compliments to an artist; remixes were your personal connection to your favorite musician. Now, however, remixes are getting produced on an assembly line with a standardized set of instructions. What is the definitive sound of this generation? 
I’m almost afraid to say it, but this last decade of music is going to be known for the technology. Music seems to be amalgamating into some indefinable blurb. Over the last 10 years, no artist has really grabbed our attention. The big bands we hear now are the same ones we listened to back in the early ’90s. This generation has gone to the MP3 and the MP3 moves songs around like a musical prostitute.

Dear Prerna,
When a couple decides to break up, why does everyone around have to suffer? My two good friends were dating for a very long time — the perfect couple, or so I thought. They broke up two years ago, but my best friend still doesn’t “approve” of me hanging out with her ex. It’s been such a long time, and both of them have moved on in their own ways by dating other people. So why must I, a person who isn’t even directly involved in the breakup, pick a side or compromise on my friendship with the other?
—Stuck in the Middle
Dear Stuck,
Didn’t it just seem like an ideal situation when your best friends were dating? Anyway, I think your best friend just feels uncomfortable around her ex. However, you should explain to her that her ex is your friend, too, and as much as you love her, you would rather not have to choose between the two.
You should probably not encourage her ex to bring a current girlfriend to events with your best friend and vice versa. It takes a while for people to get comfortable in such situations. Try keeping out of their breakup — you are entitled to your opinion and your friendship, both of which are independent of the other.
Time heals everything,
—Prerna
Dear Prerna,
I can’t get myself to sleep soundly anymore. Every night I go to bed and wake up a few hours later. Sometimes I feel like I am wasting time while sleeping. I’ve tried staying up later to make myself tired, but it hasn’t helped. I have tried the whole movie-and-heavy-snack run, but nothing seems to work. What should I do?
—Student Needs Overnight Rest, Easily!
Dear SNORE,
The usual advice column answer would be: Don’t drink caffeine too late; don’t work out after 4 p.m.; have a stable sleeping schedule; and so on. However, being college students, we know that advice is hardly realistic.
So, let’s get to the suggestions that fit the bill: Don’t do any really exciting activity before going to bed. If the noise down the street is keeping you awake, get an air purifier to make white noise or a fan in the summer. Don’t think about stressful topics; instead, just relax and think of something soothing. Usually, I like to recap a nice episode of my day or just imagine something that makes me happy and peaceful. If this still doesn’t work, I suggest you find a history book and start reading. Nothing calls sleep faster than an extremely dull book.
Good night,
—Prerna

In a letter to the editor, the former president of Delta Tau Delta, a fraternity that had been recently removed from campus by their national organization, accused The Tartan’s Editorial Board of routinely writing sensationalist stories about fraternities at Carnegie Mellon.

Last Monday, Pittsburgh Mayor Luke Ravenstahl proposed a 1 percent “fair share tax” that would add about $400 to Carnegie Mellon’s annual tuition. The mayor proposed the tax in order to fill a $15 million void in the city budget for pensions and the Carnegie Library of Pittsburgh system. If enacted, the tax would be the first to tax college tuition in any city in the nation.
Carnegie Mellon’s official position is with the Pittsburgh Council on Higher Education (PCHE), a coalition of all Pittsburgh colleges and universities, which opposed the tax at a press conference last Tuesday.
“Mayor Ravenstahl wants to solve his budget problems by taxing this financially stressed group of students. I can’t find fairness in this proposal,” said the president of the Association of Independent Colleges and Universities of Pennsylvania (AICUP), Don Francis, in a press release.
Student Body President Rotimi Abimbola, a senior double major in political science and international relations, voiced her opinions, much in line with the AICUP.
“To be honest, [my initial reaction was] that it was absolutely preposterous. I am shocked that the mayor thinks that $400 is just spare change to us,” Abimbola said.
Abimbola also brought the issue back to a lack of mayoral involvement with students.
“It felt like another low blow after he had failed to show up at the Mayoral Forum that Student Government [at Carnegie Mellon] hosted a week before the election,” she said.
Teresa Thomas, assistant vice president for media relations at Carnegie Mellon, mentioned in an e-mail the contributions that Carnegie Mellon students already make to the city.
“Last year, students, faculty and staff logged more than 117,000 hours of community service to the region’s schools and cultural institutions,” Thomas said. “Many students work in Pittsburgh, some holding down multiple jobs. We support the use of mass transit and the city’s museums. Working students pay the city a range of taxes from wage to real estate and fees.”
On Thursday, Student Senate Chair Aaron Gross, a junior social and decision sciences major, identified such benefits as the reason behind Carnegie Mellon’s and Pittsburgh colleges’ roles as an “economic engine” for the city.
Abimbola echoed both Gross and Thomas when she said, “The state of the city’s finances is not our fault. We are the life of the city. We will continue to make great contributions to the city, but I don’t think we are giving less than we should be.”
The official position of Student Senate is against the tax. In a unanimous vote, Senate agreed Thursday to pass a preliminary resolution against the “fair share tax.”
Students mentioned ideas such as a night of all Pittsburgh college students boycotting Oakland and Southside to show the city just how much they contribute to local businesses. Senate has formed a special committee for this issue. They met for the first time this past Saturday and will be planning how to work within Carnegie Mellon, with other Pittsburgh schools, and with the city to fight the proposed tax.
Students at the Senate meeting mentioned a long list of problems, including double taxing if a student’s family lives in Pittsburgh and the added burden placed on the institutions to cover these fees as part of the cost of attendance.
“The student’s eligibility for aid would be based upon the inclusion of this fee in his overall educational expenses,” said Linda Anderson, director of student financial aid at Carnegie Mellon.
Anderson, Thomas, and the press release from AICUP all indicated they did not expect that this bill would pass. The AICUP added in their press release that if it were to pass, they would be prepared to take the city to court for the legality of such a tax.
The vote is expected by the end of this year. With weeks left in the semester, there is little time left to fight the tax, according to Gross.
“I was a part of the Students for Obama group that did a lot of work on campus last spring. In that time, I saw students at Carnegie prove that we are not apathetic. I think that the mayor’s office and some city council members are under the impression that college students will not organize themselves to fight against [this]. We will, and when we do, we will shake up the city,” Abimbola said.

On Saturday, Nov. 7, the U.S. House of Representatives passed the Health Care Reform Bill, H.R. 3932, in the late hours of the night under the full name “Affordable Health Care for America Act.” The margin was quite narrow, with the votes 220 to 215. Specifically, only one Republican voted for the bill, Joseph Cao of Louisiana, and 39 Democrats voted against it. The purpose of the reform is to attempt to provide coverage for the more than 45 million Americans without health insurance.
Though the reform bill has passed the House, the Senate must now vote on its own reform bill, as both houses of Congress must approve their own bills before a single bill from both houses can be presented to the President. The process can be complicated — each bill must travel through committees in the houses before the actual vote, similar to the one on the night of Nov. 7 in the House of Representatives.
The bill has inspired controversy throughout the country, especially along party lines. There are several key features of the bill that can be found within the approximately 2000-page text. If enacted in its current state, it would create the Health Choices Administration, an independent agency with a Health Choices Commissioner as leader. An additional Health Insurance Exchange program through the Health Choices Administration would provide health care coverage to Americans, including a public option provided through the government.
“The public option is a proposed government health care plan that would be designed to compete with regular insurance companies,” said Aaron Marks, a senior business administration major, who noted a possible flaw in that “the government does not have [to] turn a profit to stay in business, while insurance companies do.”
The bill includes a prohibition against insurance companies’ denying coverage to those with preexisting conditions and forbids an “essential benefits” package from implementing annual or lifetime coverage limits. A 5.4 percent tax would be applied to single individuals earning over $500,000 a year and to couples earning over $1 million a year, while another tax could affect those without any coverage and employers who fail to cover their employees. The plan itself could reportedly cost over one trillion dollars, adding to the United States’ debt.
As the Senate prepares to vote on its own health care reform bill, there are several obstacles in its way, mainly differences between the two houses and filibuster attempts. The senior director of health care services and initiatives in the Heinz College, David Dausey, explained that “the largest challenge facing the passing of any legislation will happen in the House-Senate Conference Committee, where leaders from the House and the Senate will have to iron out the differences between the bill that was just passed in the House and whatever bill gets passed in the Senate.”
If the bill is passed within the next year, it would not take full effect until 2013, the year in which most first-years will graduate. Thus, the effects of the bill will mostly be felt by those who have recently graduated from Carnegie Mellon and are entering the job market. Primarily, students would be able to expect medical coverage with their first jobs, which is not necessarily true today. The maximum age for dependents to remain on their parents’ insurance plan is usually 25 or 26.
Martin Gaynor, an economics professor in the Heinz College, said, “One group it very likely would affect is recent college graduates.... It is a very common situation to graduate from CMU and either not have a job right away or not have a job that has benefits. Most of these people would find ... that they would be much more likely to have insurance after graduating college.”
In the coming weeks, the country must await the decision of the Senate in regard to its health care reform bill.

Cushing Academy in Massachusetts gained national attention in September when it announced plans to replace its collection of more than 20,000 books with a massive electronic database.
Carnegie Mellon has for years already been building its own “bookless library”: “For the nearly 15 years I’ve been in the Carnegie Mellon Libraries, we’ve been working hard to provide the campus with what I think is a very realistic view of the library of the future. We are working towards a hybrid of an online and paper-based library,” computer science librarian Missy Harvey explained.
“We have become a leader in the field of digitizing important materials to make them available online. Carnegie Mellon’s libraries are currently working on a number of [digitization] projects to expand its inventory of online books and resources,” Harvey said.
The rarity of many works in the Posner Memorial Collection highlights the advantages of the increased accessibility and longevity of electronic republishing. “Rare books [can be] scanned and delivered via the World Wide Web to scholars in places such as Argentina and Germany who could not visit the books,” Mary Catharine Johnsen, the special collections and design librarian, said. “Electronic versions save wear and tear on using the physical book, which is important if you are a book from 1755 and your leather spine is dry and cracking.”
While increased accessibility and longevity are inherent to any form of publication, an electronic format may have advantages over a physical format, and many students at Carnegie Mellon are asking for online versions of works already widely available in paper. 
“We have been moving from paper journal subscriptions to online journals — eJournals — for many years. We are purchasing eBook versions of reference books because they lend themselves to being used primarily online,” Harvey explained.
There are many who have concerns about transitioning to an electronic medium. Johnsen points out that the idea of a bookless library is still very new and its execution has not yet been perfected. “I know of a project where many books were sent from the United States to foreign countries for cheap scanning. The books returned disbound and tied in bundles and unusable as books,” recounted Johnsen. “The pixels were not sent back to the United States in an accessible form. Therefore, until the pixels are accounted for, the books have died.”
Johnsen also said that even in successful scans of books to electronic formats, the many subtleties in a book’s presentation and metadata may be lost in an online medium. “For literature students, you really want to see the original format of the work as received by its first public. Was it a fancy coffee-table book? Was it a cheap paperback or flimsy pamphlet? Was it a colorful book to tempt you in a Victorian train station or an airport bookstall?”
Even in more quantitative and technical subjects where aesthetic presentation is often not as important as actual content and data, many still seem to prefer books to electronic documents. 
“When learning about quantum mechanics, mathematical logic, polymer chemistry, and numerous other complex fields, I continue to observe users preferring to touch pencil to paper — to engage the physical book — rather than read the dense content solely online,” Harvey said. “Some think that the sciences, in particular, lend themselves to shifting towards accessing everything online. Yet so far, the evidence doesn’t support the hypothesis.” 
In fact, according to Harvey, the most popular library books at Carnegie Mellon are in computer science.
Regardless of whether they have books or not, both Harvey and Johnsen predict that libraries will keep their roles as areas of study, research, and learning. “A library is still a place to come to think, ponder, read, study with others, and other activities of learning,” Johnsen said. “One of our main missions is to help students and faculty learn how to use different types of information and to access them and to use them efficiently. This is now more important than ever.”
Harvey also said, “Our educational community looks to librarians to help them learn how to navigate the complex information landscape.”
However, James Tracy, the headmaster of Cushing Academy, explained his decision to replace his school’s books: “When I look at books, I see an outdated technology, like scrolls before books.”

The Carson Loop Bus is one of Carnegie Mellon’s newest services. It was initiated by former student body president and vice president Jared Itkowitz and Pooja Godbole and began running as a trial service during the spring semester of last year. According to the Student Government website, the bus is “a weekend, nighttime loop bus for undergraduate and graduate students that encourages students to explore other Pittsburgh neighborhoods.” Stopping at 11 locations, the Loop Bus provides opportunities to travel to a variety of neighborhoods that offer bars, shopping, and entertainment throughout Pittsburgh.
The Loop Bus operates Friday and Saturday nights, from 7 p.m. to 2 a.m., running between the University Center turnaround and a variety of local Pittsburgh locations along Forbes and Fifth Avenues and into the South Side. It runs hourly from 7 p.m. to 9 p.m. and half-hourly from 10:30 p.m. to 1:30 a.m., leaving from the University Center.
Currently, the Loop Bus is free for all students with an ID and even allows students to bring a non-student guest along. However, the administration is considering charging students an extra fee for access to the bus. The fee will be discussed at the next Student Senate meeting on Thursday at 5 p.m. in Breed Hall, Margaret Morrison Carnegie Hall 103.
The bus was originally modeled off Duquesne University’s SGA Loop and Port Authority’s former UV Loop. 
Duquesne University’s Loop bus is free of charge. According to Duquesne’s student government website, “Fr. Hogan, the Executive Vice President for Student Life and Student Government jointly fund the loop bus as a service for students. This joint effort is so students can go and come back from different city locations safely.”
The Port Authority’s UV Loop was to be “a hip new urban bus loop that will link many of Pittsburgh’s diverse neighborhoods on Friday and Saturday nights.” Starting in 2002, the bus traveled every weekend from Downtown to the South Side, through Oakland and the East End, then back through Lawrenceville and the Strip District until returning downtown. The route was chosen, the Port Authority explained, to join “many of Pittsburgh’s great neighborhoods and entertainment highlights including theatres, restaurants, and other performance and cultural destinations.” The bus ceased operation soon after it began based on low ridership and broader financial issues.
“I would be abnormally astounded if there would be a charge for the Loop Bus. It is a breach of my trust in the institution. This is an exercise in exhortation and the fee is ridiculous,” said Harrison Apple, a first-year art student.
Student Government plans to have a final decision about the fees in the coming weeks.

After a series of never ending midterms, eighty freshmen, accompanied by about fifteen faculty and staff, gathered at the Doha International Airport for what would soon be their best weekend ever. Each student present, even though a little weary after the Java midterm, gleamed with excitement. 
It was amazing to see about a hundred of us move in a line towards a separate counter arranged just for Carnegie Mellon University Qatar. We finally boarded the flight to Muscat, landing at the Seeb International Airport later in the evening. Then onwards we traveled 40 kilometers by bus to the Al-Nahda Resort and Spa, Barka.
At the resort, we were assigned our “villas” in which we were to stay for the next two days. The villas housed 3–5 persons each and the roommates were grouped randomly in order to encourage interaction between every student. The resort was colossal — we used bicycles to get from one place to another. This was the best part: about fifty of us, cycling around the resort at 3 a.m. Nobody was ever in the mood to sleep, thus there were gangs of bikers all around the place. 
The following morning, breakfast was arranged at the restaurant; everybody was fresh and excited about the days activities, despite last night’s sleeplessness. After breakfast, all of us gathered at the football field for a briefing after which we were divided into groups randomly to partake in various games. There was a math puzzle, a canal-building game and several other team-building activities. It was interesting to see how people, who barely knew each other, cooperated and progressed as a team. The day’s fun concluded with a lavish lunch at the restaurant with various kinds of meals, salads and of course, dessert!
Next, we assembled at the field again. We were divided into groups for archery and the “crate building” game. This game was peculiarly interesting, as we had to stand on a crate, maintaining our position and balance while adding more crates to the ‘crate tower’. Some students actually reached the maximum of nine crates, which was admittedly a very hard goal. Archery was another interesting activity, since the majority of students were trying it for the first time. Although very few hit the target, it was unanimously enjoyed. Then, for the following three hours, there was the ultimate Frisbee; a game I thought was pretty dumb before the Oman trip. My opinion soon changed though; it is an excellent game and requires good reflexes and ‘Frisbee estimation’ skills.
The next day was a big one, with all sorts of activities that most of us were attempting for the first time — rock climbing, mountain biking, Via-ferratta, village walk and even yoga for the ladies. Rock climbing and Via-ferratta were unquestionably some of the more physically challenging activities. Safety was of prime importance and the safety measures taken were impressive; many students overcame their fear of heights after the rock-climbing activity. Mountain biking was yet another activity by which the bikers were rewarded with a closer view of Oman’s natural beauty and village lifestyle, something that is rare in this part of the world. Most students completed two activities and by the time we reached the resort, it was time to pack up.
This trip was truly a memorable one; it was the greatest opportunity for each individual to interact with other students, faculty and staff. The trip was thoroughly refreshing, especially after the stressful midterm week. Such trips, along with enriching our cultural knowledge, also increase our understanding of the lifestyle of people in different nations. 
I am completely sure all who went on the trip share the same view and also hope to be able to undertake such trips in future.

Forbes Ave. land purchased
Carnegie Mellon University has purchased a section of property along Forbes Avenue with the intention of extending campus. The area includes the Forbes Avenue and Craig Street corridors, including the former site of an Exxon service station at 4621 Forbes, along with a hillside just east of 4621 and a house on Filmore Street, which sits behind 4621 and adjacent to a parking lot for the Graphic Arts Technical Foundation (GATF) building. The land was officially purchased on Nov. 9 from Museum Park Partners, a land development firm. 
The recent purchase follows the acquisition of three acres of land along Forbes Avenue this past summer. That sale included a space in Junction Hollow on the south side of Forbes Avenue, the National City Bank property and building at 4612 Forbes, the GATF building at 4615 Forbes, and a parking lot behind the GATF building.
Last summer, Carnegie Mellon President Jared Cohon addressed these purchases in an e-mail sent to the campus community. He said that these properties were strategically located to enable future growth that will benefit the university and the region. He said the investment was of compelling importance to the university’s future growth, even in such a challenging economic time.
CBDR opens Research Café
Carnegie Mellon University Social and Decision Sciences is opening a behavioral decision research lab in downtown Pittsburgh. The lab will be called the “Carnegie Mellon Research Café” and is located on the second level of Fifth Avenue Place. At the café, Downtown workers and visitors will be able to earn rewards for participating in studies.
The Research Café is an initiative of Carnegie Mellon’s Social and Decision Sciences Department and its Center for Behavioral Decision Research (CBDR). According to the website, the center’s research draws on a variety of disciplines, such as behavioral economics, history, marketing, neuroscience, organizational behavior, public policy, and psychology. Topics will include trust and fairness; memory and decision making; how people decide to save or spend; how to reduce obesity; public health issues like diet, ; privacy; perceptions of inflation; managerial decision making; and dynamic decision processes. 
The Research Café’s normal business hours are 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. Monday through Friday, and 10 a.m. to 3 p.m. on Saturday. For more information about the café and the CBDR, visit www.cmu.edu/news/archive/2009/November/nov9_researchcafe.shtml.

Archaeology, National Identity and the Coup in Honduras: The Role of the Ancient Maya
Wednesday at 4:30 p.m.
Gregg Hall (Porter Hall 100)
This past June, the elected president of Honduras, Manuel Zelaya Rosales, was exiled in a coup; however, the new regime has not yet been recognized by the international community. In Honduras, the new government has replaced almost all ministers and high-level officials, including Darío Euraque, the former director of the Honduran Institute of Anthropology and History. This institute is the state agency in charge of protecting and promoting Honduras’s cultural heritage, taking special importance with the famous archaeological site of Copán. Darío Euraque is currently a professor of history at Trinity College.
Where's Babeldaob? Sending Students Abroad as a Global Technology Consulting Corps
Thursday at 4:30 p.m.
Gregg Hall (Porter Hall 100)
Since its beginnings back in 2004, Technology Consulting in the Global Community has sent abroad 49 students from all Carnegie Mellon colleges in order to provide assistance in computing, information systems, and advanced applications. Over a span of 10 weeks in the summer, the students travel to technologically underserved countries (such as Niue, Palau, Ghana, India, and the Philippines) and work with local governments, schools, or NGO leaders to more effectively use technology in their organizations. In his talk, Joseph Mertz — an associate teaching professor in the H. John Heinz III College and the School of Computer Science here at Carnegie Mellon — will outline the capacity-building consulting model the program is built on, describe the results the students have brought about, and explain the plans to dramatically expand the program.

Congratulations to the Social and Decision Science Department on getting press: The Pittsburgh Post-Gazette covered the opening of its CMU Research Café downtown, an initiative of the Center for Behavioral Decision Research (CBDR). The facility took three rooms on the second floor of Fifth Avenue Place that used to hold a Sam Goody store and transformed it into a space that benefits Carnegie Mellon, its students, Highmark (the main tenant of the building), and the vendors providing the food.
Of course, the CBDR has already made use of an unusual strategy for getting the citizens of Pittsburgh involved with its studies: The Data Truck was rolled out in June 2007 to travel around Pittsburgh and perform studies with large crowds (Steelers games and shopping malls). This resource is important for a highly varied sampling of subjects — an important aspect of any fair study — which is not readily available on a college campus. The introduction of the café adds another, even more attractive option to take advantage of this same resource.
With all the hype about this new research café — CMU news and H&SS are all a-Twitter with excitement — it’s easy to get caught up in celebration. And why not? Not only will CMU researchers benefit, but the Pittsburgh economy will as well. Like the Waffle Shop is doing for East Liberty, this CMU-specific locale will draw more students downtown. Its location in Fifth Avenue Place makes it an easy place for those working in the building to drop by for a bite, meaning that students get the benefit of more subjects and the vendors get the benefit of more diners.
Ultimately, this café is a fantastic idea — it gets the public to the researchers who need an unbiased sampling for the best results, and it can only help make Carnegie Mellon look more innovative as it spreads further into Pittsburgh.

We’ve all heard the widely propagated stereotypes about women in Latin America — namely, the way they dress. I know the pictures that are popping to the front of your minds right now — nude beaches, or barely-there bikinis, women provocatively swinging their hips while they sashay down the street. While this article isn’t meant to either further or diminish those stereotypes, it actually describes a situation that clearly goes against anything even remotely associated with them.
Last month, Geisy Arruda, a 20-year-old student at the privately owned Bandeirante University in Sao Bernardo de Campo, outside of Sao Paulo, wore a short, hot pink miniskirt to classes, which incited major ridicule and taunting from her fellow students and eventually led to her expulsion and then reinstatement. The university took further action by taking out advertisements in local newspapers that publicly decried her immorality, according to an article from the Associated Press. Videos of the humiliation that Arruda endured as she was escorted from campus by the police, covered up with a professor’s white lab coat, can be seen on YouTube and were played on many major Brazilian television stations. Arruda has been told she will be allowed back to the university, but she has not yet stated whether or not she will do so, citing safety concerns, according to the same AP article.
I know that as Carnegie Mellon students, we’ve seen our fair share of, let’s say, differently dressed students. I will never forget walking into Wean Hall my first year and seeing someone dressed as a Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtle — costume, mask, and all — with a piece of cake shoved around the mouth-hole of the mask, just laying, sprawled out, in the middle of the floor right inside the main doors. After doing a double take to make sure my already sleep-deprived mind wasn’t hallucinating (which it wasn’t), I looked around to see how other people were reacting, and was greeted with complete and total indifference. While I know that a TMNT costume isn’t exactly the same thing as a hot pink miniskirt, I still cannot believe that the students in Brazil reacted the way that they did.
Both the university’s and the students’ actions were inappropriate. Students of any age, no matter what country they go to school in, should know that taunting their classmates because of what they are wearing is wrong. While a few jokes or whistles could be expected — these are boys in college, after all — harassing someone, yelling “*puta*” (whore) at them, and taunting them so much that they need a police escort to leave the building is completely unacceptable. Even if the skirt violated the school’s dress code, that’s an issue for the university’s administration to deal with, not a matter that the students need to take into their own hands. I just cannot imagine why a student wearing a miniskirt, no matter how short, would result in such mass chaos as Arruda’s did.
The university did not take the correct course of action, either. As Arruda asserts in the AP article, she is the victim in the situation, not the perpetrator. She is the student that was attacked by her fellow classmates. And yet, she is also the one that was punished. Not only did the university decide to expel her, but they also decided not to inform her directly; instead, Arruda learned of her expulsion from the advertisements taken out in newspapers — advertisements that claimed she was wearing “inadequate clothing” and that her attitude was too provocative for the school environment. Whether or not this is true (I doubt that it is — it’s hard for me to imagine that Arruda’s skirt was so short and her actions so provocative that students felt that they couldn’t learn), the university’s first priority is still the safety of its students. It seems that Bandeirante’s administration forgot this somewhere along the way; probably at about the same time they purchased advertisements in newspapers to humiliate her further. Instead of helping to calm the situation and protect Arruda from any further danger, the university helped to make the situation bigger, an action that was unnecessary and childish.
I hope that the university sees the error of their ways, and helps to make Arruda feel safe enough to come back to school, because nothing should get in the way of obtaining an education, not even a little, pink piece of cloth.
Heather Tomko (*htomko@) honestly thinks her education would be more disrupted by someone in a TMNT costume than someone in a miniskirt.*

I know it’s a little early to be thinking about this, but if you are considering moving out of those smelly, cramped, noisy, and expensive dorms, this piece is meant for you. Anything, you might be thinking, anything will be better than a minuscule room in which you can’t even fit all your belongings. Anything would be better than having to use earplugs at night to block out the noise coming from that Guitar Hero party next door. Anything would be better than having to carry all those pots and pans into a kitchen at the other end of the dorm only to find that someone else is already cooking.
This was exactly my argument when I gave up my room in Morewood Gardens for a beautiful little studio apartment. I fell in love with the place when I saw it. It had its own little balcony, and best of all, it was cheaper than a prime double in Morewood. To top it all, it was a short 15-minute walk to campus; the Escort shuttle stopped right in front of the apartment; and the landlord was a nice old man who even offered to lend me his mother’s old crockery. Perfect ending, you say? Well, I’ve been living here for a semester now and have a different story to tell.
No, I don’t have plumbing problems; my landlord didn’t suddenly turn evil; I didn’t find out that the apartment was breaking apart — everything is actually quite perfect. What I’ve realized over the course of the semester is that I miss the campus life. I know it is partly because of the person I am — I like to come back home after classes, change into my PJs and curl up on my couch and study — and that someone who takes conscious efforts to be on campus and come back to the apartment at 3 or 4 a.m. will have a different take on this. But if you are like me, you should think about this decision more carefully.
My little room in Morewood was always more full than this spacious apartment usually is. I always had someone popping in, whether it was the RA telling me to come to a house event or my friend from across the hall coming in to tell me how her day was. Although I disliked these interruptions when I was trying hard to study, they livened up my day. 
The only time anyone has knocked on my apartment door has been when I’ve invited them to come over. The only time I’ve had more than two people in the apartment is when I’ve thrown parties in here, which, with this being CMU and CMU students being CMU students, has been thrice this semester.
Apart from friends and people in general, I miss campus itself. Being a junior biology major, I spend most of my weekdays in the Mellon Institute which, despite being a part of Carnegie Mellon, is 20 minutes away from the main parts of campus. Since Mellon is a mere five minutes away from my apartment, I had initially found the decision to move here all the more appealing.
I have two classes on campus and they are in Doherty and Porter halls. Anyone who knows how to cut through Newell-Simon Hall would know that you won’t even see the Fence if all you do is walk through Newell-Simon, attend your classes, and rush back to your next class at the Mellon Institute. So basically, the first day when I walked to campus from the front side, I was surprised to see the Walking to the Sky pole being taken apart. The next time I walked, it was there again. I miss walking to campus looking at the announcements chalked all over the sidewalks. I miss walking out of Doherty Hall to the sight of numerous tables filled with candy, brownies, pamphlets, apples, and anything else you could imagine. In short, I just miss our campus that is always full of so much life.
I know that my case is quite specific. I’m not expecting everyone making this decision to be a Hunt Library-avoiding person who is forced to stay in Mellon Institute, but you have to carefully think everything out before making this decision. Moving off campus is a big change, so take time to decide whether this is something you really want. You have nearly an entire semester to make this decision; think about what you want and make sure that you won’t regret your decision later.
Akanksha Vaidya (avvaidya@) misses almost everything about dorm life except those Guitar Hero parties, and is glad to be away from that, at least.

On Nov. 19, a California-based religious organization says that it is coming to Carnegie Mellon to hand out copies of Charles Darwin’s On The Origin of Species, edited to include a 50-page introduction. This addition essentially claims that the theory of evolution caused Nazism, the field of biology is populated by dishonest frauds, and that if you believe the scientific evidence for evolution, then you are stupid.
Someone has written a 50-page introduction to On the Origin of Species to prove he has never read On the Origin of Species. This introduction, currently available in full on the website of “Living Waters Ministries” (check the tab next to their merchandise section), also takes a sentence here and there to compare being gay to terrorism and to call Buddhism a religion of denial. Who is it that’s bringing such statements to campus under the guise of “reasoned debate?” None other than Ray Comfort, who you may recall from the infamous “Banana: Proof of God” video on YouTube. Think of it as the theological equivalent of “Fat Kid with Lightsaber.” Comfort’s other works include Evolution: A Fairy-Tale For Grownups, Militant Evangelism, and the 1991 classic Russia Will Attack Israel, in which he apparently foresaw a Soviet invasion of the state of Israel to trigger the battle for Armageddon. Hopefully his latest work will be as prescient and thoughtful as the rest. The intent of this campaign is to distribute thousands of copies of the book (minus a religiously inconvenient chapter or two) to young people across America’s top 100 college campuses. Carnegie Mellon’s secular student group — Atheists, Humanists, and Agnostics (aha!) — encourages all students to pick up a (free) copy of this 50-page personal attack on your intelligence, your personal beliefs, and your lifestyle if it is brought to campus this Nov. 19. That way, the next time anyone tries to pretend with a straight face that there’s a real, reasonable debate between science and creationism, you’ll have it straight from the mouth of a creationist that there is none.
Kendra Albert is president of Atheists, Humanists, and Agnostics.

My fellow constituents, classmates, and friends, it is time for us to organize.
Some of you may have heard about the 1 percent tuition tax that the recently re-elected mayor of Pittsburgh, Luke Ravenstahl, is pursuing.
Without going into a great amount of detail, the city needs about $15 million to boost its pension and to help balance its budget.
The mayor says that college students place a major burden on many of the city’s services and resources, and therefore, we should be taxed 1 percent of the cost of our tuition. If this bill passes, Pittsburgh will be the first city to institute such a tax.
What do we do now? Tuition costs increase every year, and Carnegie Mellon is one of the most expensive universities in the city. How do we show the mayor and the city council that we will take a major hit, financially, from this tax?
I have been in discussion with several students from different schools in the city, as well as administrators on our own campus, and I am hearing the same message: This should not be happening. In a time of great economic uncertainty, the last thing we need is to be taxed for choosing to seek higher education in the city of Pittsburgh.
All affected students must speak up and take matters into our own hands.
This may be a great time for all of us to begin to learn about Pittsburgh politics and the ways in which our student experience in the city can be impacted. In the next week, you can expect to hear a lot of buzz around campus concerning this issue.
I ask that you tune in and find out what is going on and that you take an interest in an issue that could have a direct impact on your time here as students.
The only way that we can fight this is by showing the power that college students in Pittsburgh have.
We bring so much to this city — we help local businesses, we do research, we do a tremendous amount of social work and community service, and so much more.
There will be more information concerning this tuition tax released to the entire campus later this week.
In the meantime, get informed, tell a friend, call the city council, and be on the lookout for petitions outside of Doherty Hall.

Mayor Ravenstahl has been re-elected, and now he wants Carnegie Mellon students to pay more than  $400 extra each year because the city of Pittsburgh needs to balance its budget. 
This one percent tax targets “post-secondary tuition,” which is basically any college student in Pittsburgh, and because Carnegie Mellon students already have high tuition costs, under this budget measure, we’d be paying the highest tax.
A large portion of the funds would help cover higher pension costs — costs that college students do not benefit from — and a little of it would help keep neighborhood branches of the Carnegie Libraries from closing. To justify this tax, the mayor has said that “the city can no longer provide city services to those who are not paying their fair share.” However, we students do contribute to Pittsburgh’s economy — we go out to eat at restaurants and we spend money at local and chain retailers.
Mayor Ravenstahl also said that “this is a fair way to share the burden of paying for public services.” Clearly something isn’t fair. Why should the tax be based on the tuition of an institution; are Carnegie Mellon students the biggest freeloaders of the city? Carnegie Mellon students are already burdened with the large amount of tuition we pay, and this only adds to our troubles. This added price could prevent prospective students from coming to Carnegie Mellon and Pittsburgh would be missing out on some of the best talent from around the world. Carnegie Mellon University was just named a “Best Neighbor” to the city of Pittsburgh because of our “positive impact” on the community, including “commercial and residential activities.” Maybe the mayor missed that issue of The Tartan.
Instead of taxing our education, perhaps the mayor should embark on a plan to bring more people to the city, and encourage college students to stay after graduating. Creating more taxes on the population of college students will only drive people away.

According to a Nov. 10 press release, Carnegie Mellon has just agreed to spend $7.5 million on a half-acre plot of land that previously housed a gas station. The land, located on Forbes Avenue east of Craig Street but west of the Collaborative Innovation Center on campus, could serve as a bridge from the main campus buildings to the small Craig Street-based commercial district so heavily populated by Carnegie Mellon’s students.
With an ever-expanding student population and a need to keep up with its top academic competitors, it makes sense for Carnegie Mellon to want to buy more land and physically expand its main campus’s grounds. But is spending $7 million on a plot of land that will likely sit empty for years the most financially viable option for a university whose own president has expressed concern over the institution’s financial woes?  
Moreover, following the university’s plan for expansion as outlined by the Campus Design and Facilities Development master plan, new physical development of the campus looks more spread-out than dense. While it is important and impressive that this plan exists, and that it is more or less consistently evaluated and updated, the scope of development for Carnegie Mellon might not be thinking enough about the landscape of the Oakland region and city at large. As we become less of an industrial urban area and more of a technology-driven, education-based urban powerhouse, our architecture should reflect this: We need denser, taller buildings. We need to build upon what we have — we can have taller buildings on campus; we can go underground; we can expand upon already sprawling parking lots and open areas on campus.
While more development in any way is good for the university and will draw more people to the city of Pittsburgh, it is imperative that these changes reflect the direction of the university itself.
