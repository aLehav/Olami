This week, Carnegie Mellon’s men’s and women’s swimming and diving team traveled to Atlanta for the 2010 University Athletic Association (UAA) Championships, hosted by Emory University. Overall, the men’s team finished the weekend in second place, and the women finished fourth.
The women’s swimming and diving team opened the meet on Thursday by setting a school record in the 200-yard freestyle relay. Sophomore Hannah Gonzalez led off the relay with teammates first-year Breanna Stillo, senior Sara Andrews, and junior Brianne Burton finishing the race with a school record and NCAA provisional qualifying time of 1:37.70.
Burton, Stillo, and Andrews also swam the 50-yard freestyle, with Burton swimming a provisional qualifying mark placing fifth with a time of 24.28. Stillo won the consolation final in 24.52, and Andrews finished fourth in the consolation final with a time of 24.99. Junior Molly Evans earned a season-best time in the 500-yard freestyle, finishing in second place with a time of 5:00.31. Sophomore diver Olivia DeFazio placed fourth on the one-meter board. The women’s team was ranked fourth after day one at the UAA Championships.
The men started off the meet well, finishing the day in second place behind Emory. Senior Gates Winkler became the UAA champion in the 500-yard freestyle with a time of 4:34.20, finishing almost two full seconds ahead of junior teammate and silver medalist Frank Olechnowicz. The Tartans showed even more depth in the 500, as first-years Kevin Kuntz and Brandon Yee took fourth and fifth, respectively, and all four Tartans achieved NCAA provisional cuts. Senior Jonas Altman-Kurosaki won the consolation heat in the 500, while teammate senior Jon Spring touched in fifth in the same event with a time of 4:44.68.
The men’s ‘A’ 200-yard freestyle relay, consisting of junior Josh Mathews, senior Scott Moorby, junior Travis Piper, and sophomore Matt Stanton placed fifth with a time of 1:25.63. Junior Alex Hanson took fourth in the 200-yard IM with a provisional mark and a career-best time of 1:54.84. First-year Daniel Glaser-Garbrick also swam the 200-yard IM, finishing third in the consolation final in 1:55.91. Senior Jeff Dahlen finished third in the 50-yard freestyle with a career mark with a time of 21.29. The 400-yard medley relay of Dahlen, senior Jeff Huber, Glaser-Garbrick, and Mathews finished second, and Dahlen’s lead-off 100-yard backstroke time of 50.93 will most likely send him to NCAAs.
For the men’s diving team, sophomore Mike Alexovich earned All-UAA honors with a third-place finish in the three-meter board while senior Matt Kuhn finished fifth.
“It was great to start off the meet strong,” Huber said. “We had to get the bugs out a bit in the morning but really came together at night and got in the right mindset.”
On day two, the women’s team racked up four different NCAA provisional times. The 200-yard medley relay team of first-year Dorothy Yu, Stillo, Evans, and Burton set a school record by almost two seconds with its second-place time of 1:47.62, and Evans placed third in the 200-yard freestyle with a time of 1:53.10. Stillo and Andrews also each provisionally qualified for the NCAA meet in the 100-yard breaststroke, with Stillo placing third with a 1:06.80 and Andrews finishing fourth with a time of 1:07.34. The 800-yard freestyle relay team of Andrews, first-year Sarah Musial, Evans, and sophomore Victoria Adams placed third with a time of 7:47.04 and earned All-UAA honors. Gonzalez placed sixth in the 100-yard butterfly with a time of 59.47 as the women Tartans held their fourth place at the end of Friday’s competition.
“I thought we had a lot of inspiring races,” said Gonzalez. “Nothing gets people more pumped up than watching their teammates do something amazing.”
The Tartan men won two more events and remained in second place on the second day of swimming. Hanson won the 400-yard individual medley with a personal best of 4:02.60, a provisional mark that will likely send him to the NCAA Championships. Moorby won his event in the 100-yard backstroke and solidified his first trip to the NCAA Championships with an automatic qualifying time of 50.69 before leading off the 200-yard medley relay with an outstanding split of 23.66.
Other top performers for day two were Glaser-Garbrick, whose time of 4:06.75 in the 400-yard IM garnered him seventh place, and Mathews, who earned All-UAA honors in the 200-yard freestyle with a third place time of 1:42.73. Both the 200-yard medley relay consisting of Moorby, Huber, Piper, and Dahlen and the 800-yard freestyle relay with the team of Dahlen, Kuntz, Mathews, and Olechnowicz placed second in their events, with times of 1:33.86 and 6:05.27, respectively. The latter was out-touched by 0.01 seconds by Emory.
The women ended the meet strongly on Saturday, as Evans became the two-time champion in the 200-yard backstroke with a season-best time of 2:04.29. Adams swam a season-best with a time of 17:45.59 in the 1650-yard freestyle, finishing 12th but provisionally qualifying her for the NCAA meet. Yu touched in fifth with a time of 2:25.71 in the 200-yard breaststroke, and Andrews and first-year Price Kinney took third and fourth, respectively, in the consolation heat. To finish the meet, Andrews, Stillo, Evans, and Burton swam the 400-yard freestyle relay with a time of 3:34.15 and placing third.
For the third consecutive year, the Tartans finished day three in second place. Altman-Kurosaki became the UAA champion with a season best in the 1650-yard freestyle with a time of 15:53.07. Glaser-Garbrick earned a third-place finish in the 200-yard butterfly with a time of 1:52.43 en route to being crowned UAA Male Rookie of the Year.
“Honestly, winning Rookie of the Year was the last thing on my mind,” said Glaser-Garbrick. “I just went in there doing what I do, showing what I’m made of, and I’m glad I was able to turn some heads.”
Also in the 1650, Winkler and Olechnowicz placed third and fifth, respectively. Winkler swam a time of 16:05.21, and Olechnowicz finished in 16:06.94. Junior Justin Whaley and Yee also swam the 200-yard butterfly, with Whaley placing sixth in 1:54.08 and Yee finishing seventh with a time of 1.54.13. Junior Michael Panzitta placed second in the 200-yard backstroke with a career best of 1:53.07, while Hanson finished sixth in the event with a 1:54.90. Moorby and Dahlen finished first and second in the consolation final with times of 1:52.39 and 1:52.88. 
Moorby’s time would have made him the UAA champion had he made the championship final during preliminaries. Mathews placed first in the consolation final with a time of 46.90 in the 100-yard freestyle. Huber also placed first in the consolation final of the 200-yard breaststroke touching in with a time of 2:09.44.
For the men’s diving team, Alexovich placed third in the one-meter board and Kuhn placed fifth. To close out the championships, the men’s 400-yard freestyle relay of Moorby, Mathews, Stanton, and Dahlen finished third in the event in 3:06.20.
“It was definitely a great meet overall,” Mathews said. “Though we didn’t get as close to Emory as last year, we still had a lot of great individual performances and I think we really set the stage to do something amazing next year.”
The NCAA meet for the women’s and men’s swimming and diving team begins on Wednesday, March 17 at the University of Minnesota in Minneapolis. 
Some Tartans will take one more shot at qualifying by competing at the ECAC Championships this coming weekend at the University of Pittsburgh.

For the first time in Carnegie Mellon’s history, the men’s tennis team was invited to participate at the ITA National Team Indoor Championship, held at Gustavus Adolphus College. After falling to number-one Santa Cruz in the first round, the Tartans rebounded to defeat number-25 Gustavus Adolphus 8–1, but were unable to repeat and fell to number-six Johns Hopkins 3–6 later that evening to finally take sixth. The ninth-ranked Tartans move to 6–3 for the season.
In the opening round, the Tartans faced top-ranked Santa Cruz, but fell 4–5 after many close matches. The Banana Slugs proved to be tough in the doubles round of play and took a 2–1 lead heading into singles. The duo of juniors Alex Nemerov and Bobby MacTaggart took the lone point at second doubles, winning 9–8 (6).
In singles play, the remaining three points came from MacTaggart, who won playing the second singles spot, 3–6, 6–2, 1–0 (4), followed by senior James Muliawan playing number three, 7–5, 4–6, 1–0 (3), and first-year Harsha Rao, 7–5, 7–5.
“This was disappointing, because we’ve been working very hard and we thought we might have been able to pull off an upset,” Nemerov said. “But Santa Cruz played well, and we just want to focus on winning the next two matches.”
“We lost 4–5 to the number-one team, so it’s not like we were overwhelmed,” MacTaggart added. “We definitely have a couple things to work on, but this only shows that we can play at the top level too.”
The Tartans found better luck against the host team Gustavus Adolphus and decisively won 8–1. After sweeping the doubles to take a 3–0 lead, including a brutal 8–0 win by first-year Duke Miller and sophomore Jeremy King at number three, the Tartans continued to play strong to take five of the six singles matches. 
Notable wins came from Muliawan at number three, who won 6–0, 6–4, and Rao, who won in straight sets, 6–4, 6–4.
Despite the win in the consolation semifinals, the day wasn’t over just yet for the Tartans, who went head-to-head against Johns Hopkins for fifth place. After a close loss by King and Miller, 7–9, and a win by Nemerov and MacTaggart at second doubles, 8–2, the Tartans found themselves down 1–2. Senior Jonathan Spero brought in the first singles point at fifth singles, 6–1, 6–4, followed by Muliawan, who won 4–6, 6–4, 1–0. Carnegie Mellon fell short, though, and was unable to secure two more points for the win. The Tartans took sixth overall in the tournament.
“This was the first time we were ever invited to the tournament, so we did okay for a first-time run,” Muliawan noted. “Obviously we wanted to do better, but there’s nothing we can do now except work harder and prepare for our spring break trip and NCAAs.”
The Tartans will gear up again against Christopher Newport College on Tuesday, March 2 at home.

On Saturday, Feb. 20, Carnegie Mellon’s track and field team journeyed to Alliance, Ohio to participate in the Raider Open hosted by Mount Union College. Both the men’s and women’s teams dominated the invitational, with Tartans taking top places in many events.
For the men’s team, the Tartans met with success on the field, with senior Chris Bridgman taking third in the pole vault, clearing a season best height of 4.40 meters. In the high jump, sophomore Ryan Kissell earned fourth with a height of 1.78 meters. Kissell also scored sixth in the long jump with a season record of 6.46 meters. 
Senior James Hulley won the shot put, clearing 15.88 meters, and earned second in the weight throw, reaching 15.54 meters. Teammate senior Chris Fornataro was not far behind in the weight throw, clearing 14.54 meters, which earned him fourth place.
On the track, the men impressed the competition. In the 3000-meter run, junior J.P. Allera won and set a meet record of 8:51.70. Allera was closely followed by sophomore Rob Morhard, who took third in the event in 8:57.91. Junior Nate Bussiere grabbed second in the mile, finishing in 4:19.37.
When it came down to the relays, the Tartan’s talent shined through. The men took first in the 4x200-meter relay, with a team of first-year John Caverhill, sophomore Michael Moore, junior Dustin Musselman, and first-year Noel Titus, finishing in 1:34.85. In addition, Bussiere, Caverhill, first-year Ben Nealy, and junior Pat O’Brien joined forces to win the 4x400-meter relay, in a time of 3:29.91.
The women’s team put on an equally impressive performance. On the field, sophomore Ivana Moses placed fifth in the long jump, clearing a distance of 4.70 meters. She also finished fourth in the triple jump, leaping 10.71 meters. Sophomore Luci Laffitte finished fifth in the high jump, clearing 1.55 meters.
The women continued to dominate on the track. Laffitte also finished third in the 55-meter hurdles with a personal record of 8.98 seconds. First-year Emily Wobb won the mile in 5:33.84, while junior Courtney Baker took first in the 800-meter run, finishing in 2:27.57. Not far behind were teammates senior Diane Mattingly and junior Laura McKee, who earned third and fourth with times of 2:27.57 and 2:28.04, respectively.
Like the men’s team, the ladies found success in their relay. Baker, Laffitte, McKee, and senior Sami Simmons teamed up to finish second in the 4x400-meter relay, with a time of 4:14.57.
Look for the Tartans on March 5–6, as they participate in the 2010 University Athletic Association Indoor Championships at Brandeis University.

The Tartans traveled to play the University of Chicago on Friday and were unable to top the number-25-ranked Maroons, losing 47–76. The loss puts Carnegie Mellon at 9–14 overall and 2–10 in the University Athletic Association.
Carnegie Mellon kept the game close for the first three minutes of play, only trailing by one. However, over the next six minutes, Chicago’s defense shut the Tartans down and extended their lead to 25–15 with 8:08 left in the half. Carnegie Mellon did not go down without a fight, however, and went on an 8–2 run, which cut the deficit to 27–23. A banked-in three-pointer from a Chicago guard ended the half, pushing the Maroons’ lead to 32–25.
Chicago started the second half full steam ahead, pushing its lead to 44–26 with 14:52 left in the game. 
The Maroons expanded the Tartans’ deficit even further, to 52–27, before the Tartans scored their first field goal: sophomore guard Alison Aunkst’s trey from the top of the key.
Carnegie Mellon’s 21.4 percent shooting from three-point range and 31.5 percent from the floor was not enough to top Chicago’s 46.4 percent from the floor. Chicago took the 76–47 victory.
First-year forward Emily Peel scored a career-high 16 points. Aunkst added 10, and fifth-year senior forward Rachelle Roll tallied eight. Roll also pulled down 11 rebounds.
First-year guard Brit Phillips said that, although Carnegie Mellon lost, the team’s morale is still positive for the remainder of the season. “As long as we do the little things right and keep our heads up, we can beat anyone,” Phillips said.
The Tartans also played on Sunday at Washington University in St. Louis. Check online at [SLANT12]www.thetartan.org/sports[SLANT12] for more details regarding the game.

The men’s basketball team hit the road on Friday to play at the University of Chicago for the second time in its University Athletic Association (UAA) season. The Tartans were unable to top the Maroons, losing 63–74. Carnegie Mellon is now 5–15 overall and 1–11 in the UAA.
Chicago took the early lead, 8–2, within the first two minutes of the game, but the Tartans stepped up their defense to hold Chicago to one field goal over the next 11:30. The Tartans tied the score at 14–14.
Carnegie Mellon took a 26–21 lead after sophomore guard John Duhring scored a transition basket off an assist from junior forward Shane Rife. The Tartans then took their largest lead, 29–23, when Rife hit a three-pointer from the top of the key. Chicago answered back with a halftime buzzer-beater, ending the half with only a one-point Tartan lead, 29–28.
Chicago stole Carnegie Mellon’s lead with 16:32 left to play, but the Tartans sank 10 straight points to take back the lead, 44–36, with 14:35 left. Senior forward Jon Wolleben added six points during the run. Carnegie Mellon then extended its lead to 52–40, but could not hold off a 13–0 run by the Maroons. Chicago took the lead, 53–52. Rife then tied the score at 53–53 with a free throw, but Chicago was  went on another run to make the score 53–59.
Chicago was able to hold off the remaining Carnegie Mellon efforts to take a 74–63 victory. Rife scored a season-high 20 points, senior guard Jack Anderson added 17, and Wolleben tallied 10.
The Tartans also played on Sunday at Washington University in St. Louis. Check online at [SLANT12]www.thetartan.org/sports[SLANT12] for more details regarding the game. The Tartans will play Case Western on Feb. 27, at home in Skibo Gym.

While it may seem impossible to even think about track and field with the stadium covered in a thick blanket of snow, the men’s and women’s teams have been making moves indoors. Notably, junior middle-distance runner Justin Kurp finished third at his last meet in the 1000-meter run, a great feat in the midst of the indoor season and in preparation for indoor championships and the upcoming outdoor season.
While in high school, Kurp qualified for competition at the state level in both track and cross country, breaking a few school records and maintaining straight A’s throughout his high school career. Although he was also involved with baseball, Kurp recognized his strength in running and decided to stick with it as his primary sport and passion. 
Being from Pittsburgh, Kurp notes pierogies, the Steelers, the Penguins, and — jokingly — the city’s street-plowing abilities as some of his favorite aspects of the city. Kurp regards the “Walking to the Sky” statue as being a unique and interesting part of Carnegie Mellon’s campus, and admits that he tends to like it more since some students expressed their dislike toward the structure.
Kurp is majoring in mechanical engineering and intends to go to graduate school after graduating next year. Being an engineer and making a positive impact on society is one of Kurp’s goals for the future. For now, Kurp hopes to have a positive impact during the track season and that his teammates will be on board. “It’s great when everyone’s heart is in the game, and I’d like to see that happen,” he said. With the end of the indoor season approaching, and the anticipation of the outdoor season building up, the Tartans have some time to team up and make Kurp’s notions a reality.

For many people, death is high up on the list of biggest fears in life. With a Carnegie Mellon-based website, DeathRiskRankings.com, people can now find statistical evidence that will tell them their odds of dying within a certain period of time. Professor Paul Fischbeck, who is part of both the social and decision science and engineering and public policy departments, originally came up with the idea following his research into risks of all types, from engineering risks to investment risks. The website began as an undergraduate research project within the information systems department as early as the fall of 2008.
The project began primarily due to the ongoing congressional health care debate, a major issue facing the government since mid-2009. In arguments concerning different healthcare issues, the two major metrics that are often used are life expectancy and infant mortality. DeathRiskRankings.com concerns itself with the other variables in between, such as age, race, and whether the participant is from America or Europe. It even takes into account different types of cancer, and the differing mortality rates between countries and genders. Using these criteria, one can calculate the chances of dying in the next year, the next five years, and so on. After infancy, annual risk of dying increases exponentially, according to a Carnegie Mellon press release.
DeathRiskRankings.com followed another one of Fischbeck’s risk assessment projects, TrafficStat. This website calculated the risk of dying from automobile accidents, depending on factors like the brand of car and where a person was driving. Despite its modest publicity, appearing on The Today Show and CNN, the site did not see the attention that Fischbeck had expected. “The ultimate risk is life and death,” Fischbeck said from his office in Porter Hall. “There’s always been an interest in quantifying how risky various things are." The website was released in August 2009, and during the first few weeks, the website received about a million hits an hour. Now, according to Fischbeck, “it’s gone way down in traffic … and I get e-mails almost daily from people wanting to use it for policy discussion.”
The variables themselves were based on death certificate data held by the Centers for Disease Control in the United States and data held by various organizations around Europe. Due to several differences in the variables and the time increments in which the data was collected, the Carnegie Mellon group had to make simplifications and compromises.
The Internet is no stranger to sites predicting dates of death: Death Clock has satiated people’s fear of dying for many years. Fischbeck is quick to point out differences. “What we do is we allow this direct comparison between all 50 states and about 20 European countries. And we have 66 causes of death. No other site does that.” Side-by-side analysis between, for example, a white American 55-year-old man and a white French 40-year-old man can yield some comparative results.
The overall message of the website was to establish the numbers. “The risks are often overestimated,” Fischbeck asserted. “People think that the risks of dying in the next year are much higher than they really are.” Statistics on the Kentucky Post website support his claim: 19-year-olds, for example, only have a one- or two-in-a-thousand chance of dying this year depending on their race, which is a small probability. With these newfound, reassuring numbers in mind, though, Fischbeck remains aware of the fact that people might take these numbers for granted and engage in more risky behavior. However, Fischbeck found economic trends in health care around the world. Americans spend much more money on health care every year for people over 80 years old than Europeans, even though the chance of dying is lower for these Americans than Europeans.
Next up on Fischbeck’s plans is the inclusion of several other countries into the DeathRiskRankings database. Canada (which could not provide data at the time of the website’s creation), Japan, and South Korea were definite interests. “[Asian countries] have much better life expectancies,” Fischbeck said, which would make for useful comparisons. Other countries, like Qatar, have already given data to be used in the future.
Other plans include creating other risk-assessment websites. One of these websites will include the odds of going to the hospital in the next year, and it will give the reasons for going, how long the stay will be, and what the cost will be. Fischbeck cited better decision-making as what he hopes visitors get out of his website. “People are now more informed, and I hope are making better decisions because of it,” he said.

It is something right out of a Star Trek episode: Out of a showy weapon flashes a laser beam and — a bug drops to the floor? Nathan Myhrvold, Microsoft’s former chief technology officer, presented a laser that shoots down bugs at the annual TEDTalks conference in Long Beach, Calif. this month.
The idea for such a laser was envisioned in 2008 by Bill Gates, a malaria-prevention advocate. He brought up the idea in a conference. Later, during the 2009 TED conference, he said, “Malaria is spread by mosquitoes. I brought some. There is no reason only poor people should be infected.” And with that, he unleashed mosquitoes into the crowd. Initially, many people had discarded Gates’ idea of a gun to kill mosquitoes as a joke. However, Myhrvold analyzed the requirements, and, against skepticism, he created the gun.
What makes this laser interesting, however, is how it is made. Although it was designed by Myhrvold’s Intellectual Ventures Laboratory, the laser gun is made using everyday household items, such as parts of printers, cameras, and projectors. The precision of laser printers, the imaging technology of certain cameras, and the power of Blu-ray made the laser relatively easy to create. The laser from the TEDTalk demonstration was made using only parts bought on eBay.
This gun was demonstrated at the conference by releasing mosquitoes into a glass tank, where the laser would strike the mosquitoes. This event was recorded and replayed in slow motion so the details of the bug’s obliteration could be observed. The mosquito’s body would become wisps of smoke curls with wings still beating. What is special about this laser gun are its additional options. It detects the size and speed of objects so that it will not harm something other than mosquitoes. One can press buttons and choose to increase the intensity for larger mosquito concentrations. The lasers can shoot between 50 to 100 mosquitoes per second, according to The New York Times.
Myhrvold’s vision for this new technology is for it to become commonplace. He estimates that the price of the laser gun in market could be as low as $50. With an instrument so cheap, some may raise concerns about how this would affect the delicate balance of life. The laser is so precise that it can not only target mosquitoes, but it can also determine its gender. Since female mosquitoes are the only ones that sting, the laser will let the males go.
But why combat mosquitoes in the first place? The idea is not to battle just any pesky insect that will sting you. This laser gun is hoped to help in the prevention of deadly diseases like malaria, which are transmitted primarily through mosquitoes. A child dies every 30 seconds from malaria, according to the World Health Organization.
Although there have been earlier versions of such a malaria-combating laser, this is the first one to be made so cheaply that it can actually be mass produced and be used by just about anyone. Currently, Myhrvold is looking into how feasible it is to ship such equipment out to those in third-world countries where malaria is more prevalent.

A 1981 article in the British Medical Journal describes three cases that had doctors perplexed. In all the cases, patients complained of severe irritation and itching after coming into contact of one the most ordinary substances on earth — water. Furthermore, there were no visible symptoms on the skin that could point toward the cause of the patients’ discomfort.
With no outward signs of an allergy, doctors were unsure as to what the exact cause of this strange condition was. In most cases, the itching was felt in the lower parts of the body, most notably the legs and thighs. Patients usually start noticing the symptoms after taking a bath. In one case that was reported in the British Medical Journal article, the patient was immersed in water at around 37°C for 15 minutes and started feeling itchy in the thighs about four minutes into the study.
After 15 minutes, the itch had spread to the patient’s back. In spite of the itches, there were no outward signs of allergy on the skin. The article goes on to describe that such symptoms were initially attributed to psychological disorders. Patients presenting such symptoms were considered “neurotic,” or these symptoms were attributed to individual personality disorders. It wasn’t until the 1980s that this disorder — now given the name of aquagenic pruritus — was considered a legitimate concern and discussed widely in medical literature.
Although the main cause of this condition still remains unknown, it does show similarities with common allergic reactions. Allergies are produced by abnormal reactions of the body’s immune system. Cells known as mast cells are the major players in an allergic reaction. Mast cells are located around blood vessels in most tissues. These cells have a number of granules inside them, which are small vesicles that contain a host of chemicals. Upon coming in contact with allergens, these granules release their chemicals into the bloodstream. This process is termed degranulation of the mast cells. One of the many chemicals released is histamine, which induces a number of reactions into the surrounding tissues that cause the symptoms of an allergy.
Skin biopsies of patients with aquagenic pruritus show that they have elevated levels of degranulated mast cells. In addition, blood tests in such patients revealed that the blood also had increased levels of histamine. What still intrigues physicians about this disorder is the aberrant physiology of patients with this allergy. High levels of histamine and degranulated cells are present in the skin even before the skin is immersed in water. Some have correlated this increase with an increase in sweating in the patients. Another puzzling factor about the disease is that there are no visible symptoms on the skin in spite of the involvement of histamine and the typical allergic reactions. Researchers believe that may be because histamine is released slowly from the cells. Also, it has been hypothesized that water on the outer layer of the skin, called the stratum corneum, may cause the absorption of molecules within the skin that leads to allergic reactions.
Since the exact cause of the disorder is not known, specific treatments for the disorder are also not known. Research is being conducted to find a method that may reduce or elminate symptoms of the allergy. Antihistamines have been known to provide relief to patients for many kinds of allergies. As stated in an article in the journal Hospital Physician, addition of alkaline compounds such as sodium bicarbonate to the water can also ease symptoms. Ultraviolet light therapy has also been known to help patients. Ultimately, only a combination of different therapies has been known to be effective.

Humans have inhabited the world for over 10,000 years, but a complete understanding of nature has proven to be elusive. In fact, there is much about natural phenomena we still do not know. Ball lightning and will-o’-the-wisp are two such phenomena that science cannot fully explain.
Ball lightning
In 1809, witnesses on the British ship HMS Warren Hastings reported three flaming balls attacking the crewmen during a storm. One orb set the deck on fire, while another orb struck and killed two other crewmen by burning them. This story, as told by Times Online, can now be explained by ball lightning.
Although more widely accepted to be folklore than science, ball lightning observations have been reported for many centuries. According to howstuffworks.com, even Czar Nicholas II saw such an orb at church as a child. While research has attempted to recreate ball lightning in laboratories, there is no widely accepted or complete theory explaining its existence.
Ball lightning is characterized by its round shape, which varies from the size of a golf ball to the size of a beach ball. Its motion is erratic, unpredictable, and seemingly unaffected by wind. Many eyewitness accounts explain that ball lightning can enter and exit rooms through openings or by passing through solid objects. Although it lasts longer than normal lightning, it eventually dissipates, sometimes gradually and sometimes with a loud, explosive popping noise.
One possible explanation of ball lightning includes silicon, as reported by New Scientist. During storms, lightning can strike the ground, vaporizing silicon present in soil. This vaporized silicon in the air then condenses as it cools, but because it is charged it forms a ball shape. The glowing of the lightning ball is due to extremely hot silicon reacting with oxygen in the air. This claim has been backed by researchers at the Federal University of Pernambuco in Brazil, who managed to create “luminous orbs the size of ping-pong balls that persisted for up to eight seconds,” according to New Scientist. The high heat of over 3000°F melted plastic. Another explanation is that ball lightning is an aerogel, which has an extremely low density for a solid. The aerogel has a current that passes through it, which forms a ball shape. Another unsurprising explanation for ball lightning is that its appearances are mere hallucinations.
Will-o’-the-wisps
In The Lord of the Rings, Gollum leads Frodo through the Dead Marshes, a swamp maze littered with the incorporeal bodies of the dead. Each body holds a candle, which appears as a flame floating over the water. While we do not live in Middle Earth, will-o’-the-wisps are unexpectedly similar to the candles of the dead. They are lights that appear to flicker, seen at night over bodies of water such as swamps and bogs. When they are approached, it is often said they burn out.
While not exactly candles of the dead, will-o’-the-wisps can be explained by decaying organic matter. This decay releases the gases methane and phosphine. Both are highly flammable and will ignite under normal atmospheric conditions. This explanation may show how the flame is created, but does not explain why the light fades as the observer approaches, or why the light seems to move along with the observer at times. Another explanation is bioluminescence — for example, barn owls have luminescent feathers — which may explain how the lights seem to move.

Flower fragrance genes isolated
The past 50 years have seen flower breeders selectively cultivating only those flowers that are large and considered pretty, in an effort to improve quality. While they succeeded in this goal, these “better” flowers lost much of their scent because they lost the appropriate fragrance genes. Scientists at the University of Florida have found these missing genes and believe that they will be able to do more than just restore scent to flowers; they will be able to change their scent at will.
The researchers were studying the genome of petunias when they noticed that a certain block of 12 or 13 genes was missing. After re-inserting the genes one at a time to figure out their function, the scientists found that they regulated the release of chemicals that give petunias their scent. They hope that this discovery will extend to other flowers and fruits and bring about major improvements in their taste and smell.

Companies profit from censorship
As some countries continue to restrict access to the Internet, more and more people are finding ways around these restrictions so they can access the sites they want to. Companies that sell products allowing them to do this are seeing significant growth. Virtual Private Networks (VPNs) are one of the most effective ways to avoid restrictions by allowing users to access the Internet through servers in other countries while preventing their own country’s censors from tracking them.
Companies such as AnchorFree provide free help in finding a way through firewalls. Others, such as the creators of the application Puff, provide a free basic program, or one with more features for a fee. Over the last year, AnchorFree has seen 500 percent growth. While providing and selling such methods is often illegal in the countries where they are used, most of the sellers live in other countries and are thus immune from prosecution.

Malaria may have killed Tutankhamen
A study on Tuesday reported that radiation and genetic testing of several Egyptian mummies, including that of King Tutankhamen, has revealed new information about a segment of the ancient Egyptian royal family. Most notably, researchers have found that Tutankhamen, the well-known boy king, is likely to have died of a particularly virulent and harmful strain of malaria called malaria tropica. This marks the oldest confirmed case of malaria ever discovered.
The study also notes that he suffered from a disorder of the bones that may have caused a fracture that he is seen to have, and a condition where blood supply is decreased to tissues in the body, weakening them. The genetic testing reveals the relationships between five generations of pharaohs and their immediate families, many of which had previously been based upon speculation alone.

Watch highlights from Lunar Gala featuring student and professional designs, dancing, and music. Lunar Gala is a celebration of the Chinese New Year.

Student designers dazzle their peers at Lunar Gala:
The campus celebrated the Chinese New Year with a student-run fashion show
There is, in fact, no fashion design major here at Carnegie Mellon, but if you were around Wiegand Gym this Saturday you might have thought otherwise.
Saturday marked the 13th annual Lunar Gala, a celebration of the Chinese New Year. Students gathered to watch a full-blown runway show featuring student models flaunting wearable student designs. The show was also accompanied by three dances and a musical interlude.
The theme chosen to celebrate the Year of the Tiger was “Tension.” Three traditional Chinese dances, performed by girls from the Oriental Star Dance School, kicked off the show. Act One consisted of eight student-designed lines, two professional boutique lines, a performance by the Dancers’ Symposium Company, and an original song performed by The Wrong Airport. Act Two also started with a dance, performed by Carnegie Mellon students. 
Following the dance were seven student-designed lines, four professional boutique lines, and a second dance. Wiegand Gym was transformed into a fashion venue with the help of a long runway and black curtains to create a backdrop for the work. Lanterns, which changed colors throughout the show, added to the ambience and brought a touch of Chinese culture to the setting.
In the past, Lunar Gala has received criticism concerning the content of the show. This year’s show, however, was less risqué and more diverse in content. Although the only obvious links to Chinese culture were the initial dances, decorative lanterns, and dumplings that were served during intermission, the quality of the showcased work was impressive. The lines featured women’s and men’s clothing; there were casual pieces such as black pants and screen-print tees and formal pieces such as evening gowns. Many of the outfits could be worn in everyday life, while other conceptual couture pieces made you wonder how long it would be until the model fell down. This year’s show even featured a jewelry line, adding even more variety to the content.
The inspiration for the designs also brought diversity to the show. Music videos, military uniforms, and the Oakland streets during the G-20 had an influence on first-year design major Chris Ioffreda’s line, “Black.”  Bernard James’ self-titled line’s vision came from other sources. “My line was inspired by European royalty,” he said. “I’m from New York City, so I went to the Metropolitan Museum of Art and did some research on French royalty. I was inspired by the artists Pierre-Paul Prud’hon and the way he draped and colored the subject’s clothing in his paintings.”
The logistics of the show were also impressive. Despite a few false starts, the opening was much improved over last year’s 40-minute delay, and there were no notable sound system problems. The crowded audience was assured a good view thanks to cmuTV and two large projectors showing the models walking the runway. Transitions between acts ran seamlessly. As James explained, “It was all very hectic but it all came together well. After a couple dress rehearsals the designers had all learned to work together — to mesh.” Although the show ran long, it focused largely on student designs.
Lunar Gala brings many parts of the campus community together in celebration of the new year and student work. By virtue of the long lists of necessary thank yous, the collaboration that made the event possible was evident. “It was hectic but it was a lot of fun,” said Marchelle Ecung, a sophomore business administration major and model for the show. “It’s a different experience than the norm here at CMU.” In a school that is often thought of for its technical expertise, Lunar Gala’s show of fashion and culture was a refreshing reminder of how diverse Carnegie Mellon’s campus really is.

Last weekend, Scotch’n’Soda put on three performances of Closer, a play by Patrick Marber that premiered in London in 1997 and was later adapted into a screenplay for the 2004 film of the same name. The play follows two men and two women who engage in a constant, yet believable, swapping of partners as they dance along the tightrope that is the truth. Each character adds his or her own level of deceit, in both playful and ugly ways, until relationships simply become a complicated mess where no one is able to leave emotionally unscathed. 
The film version of Closer consisted of a star-studded cast of some of Hollywood’s finest actors. Julia Roberts (Anna), Natalie Portman (Alice), Jude Law (Dan), and Clive Owen (Larry) — who actually starred in the original stage production as Dan — received much praise for their work in the vulgar yet articulate adaptation of stage to the big screen. Portman and Owen even won Golden Globes for their roles in the movie. 
The Scotch’n’Soda production of Closer stood up nicely against the film adaptation. Senior biology major Michelle Stewart (Alice), senior BHA student Shannon Deep (Anna), senior music major Scott Wasserman (Dan), and senior computer science major Matt Goldfarb (Larry) gave wonderful and distinctively different performances as the four leads whose intricate relationships bring them closer together than they ever intended to be. 
Stewart’s performance as Alice was unique. Alice was by far the most lovable character due to her quirky and simplistic nature. Stewart brought out each and every trait in a believable way, even managing to do so when she was half naked on stage. Our other leading lady, Shannon Deep, did a fantastic job of playing the more mature and seemingly in-control Anna. When she was in a scene, the dialogue just seemed to flow much better and it felt like the cast was having realistic conversations on stage rather than merely delivering lines.
The most important part of the show was the dynamic in each of the one-on-one relationships that take place throughout the course of the play. The actors brought out some of the best parts of each other, be it the puppy love shown between Alice and Dan, the maturity between Larry and Anna who know what they want, or even the links connecting the couples. The most interesting plot point was the spiteful way in which each character treated the others at different parts of the show. 
Such a well-known and well-respected film obviously brings challenges to those who attempt to replicate it. Director Caity Pitts spoke briefly about some of what she faced after choosing this project. “I told them to let the material speak for itself and I didn’t want them to just go out and mimic the famous Jude Law or Natalie Portman,” she said. “I really wanted them to make it their own and make it more realistic for the audience.” 
Scotch’n’Soda’s next show will be its annual Carnival show, with Alex DiClaudio directing Dirty Rotten Scoundrels, a comedy.

During the past fall semester I decided to study in our nation’s capital, Washington, D.C., through American University and the Washington Semester Program here at Carnegie Mellon. As a Pittsburgh native and a Carnegie Mellon student, I had never been far away for a long period of time. Being away from home and leaving my teammates on the women’s basketball team were two of the hardest setbacks I had to consider before making my final decision to go.
This time a year ago, I began hearing information about the Washington Semester Program, and I decided to look into it a little more. As a public policy and management major, I figured there was no better place to go to see how I could put my major to use. I applied, got accepted, and was able to go with the help of a Friedman Fellowship that I had applied for and received.
The Washington Semester Program has an internship component you must complete during your time in D.C. The program I was in — public law — required two full days of internship experience a week. Though the Washington Semester Program guarantees placement in an internship, I wanted to gain some job searching experience. Over the summer, I began looking for an internship for my arrival in D.C. I applied with several members of Congress and governmental agencies. I have some interest in environmental policy, and I landed an internship with the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) in the Office of Pesticides, Prevention, and Toxic Substances.
My internship choice turned out to be a great one. The people I worked with were knowledgeable, and the experience was relevant to what I wanted as my career. At the end of my semester, my supervisor offered me a continuation of my internship during the summer. By doing this, I will be considered a member of the Student Career Experience Program (SCEP), and upon completion of 640 hours I will be eligible for noncompetitive conversion to a full-time employee when I graduate. This alone justified my going to D.C. for the semester because I gained connections, and even a potential career, that I would not have otherwise.
My internship, though, did not make up my entire experience in D.C. The city itself was a great experience: seeing the sights, going to sporting events and museums, and realizing more and more every day that I wanted to work for the federal government in some way. I lived in an apartment on Capitol Hill, run by Washington Intern Student Housing (WISH). The location and ability to become more independent gave me an even greater experience.
The public law program through American gave me both professional preparation and memories that I could never forget. The setting of the program was different from that of a traditional class. We were required to dress professionally every day, and we were encouraged to write and speak more professionally. We were hardly even in a classroom, instead constantly traveling throughout the city to see sights and meet professionals or observe the proceedings within the sites. Each day provided a novel learning experience that could not be provided anywhere but in our nation’s capital.
My class met a representative from the National Rifle Association and a representative from the Brady Center for Gun Control. They provided two very different perspectives on the Second Amendment. They gave me a greater understanding of both sides of the gun control issue, and also made me better able to develop my own opinion on this controversial issue. 
We also met Deputy Solicitor General Malcolm Stewart,Clerk of Supreme Court William Suter, Congressman James McGovern, attorneys in the D.C. Office of the Attorney General, and the chief judge of both the D.C. District Court and the Federal Appellate Court.
We also met with additional members of Congress: Jim McDermott, Pete Sessions, Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, Betsy Markey, Anthony Weiner, Bill Delahunt, Mary Bono Mack, and Bobby Scott. We also met Senator Richard Burr and Congressman John Conyers, who is also chairman of the House Judiciary Committee. We got to watch the closing arguments of the Kevin Ring trial, (He was an actor in the Abramoff scandal.) We met several more judges and attorneys, and the executives of the Boeing Company, the Recording Industry Association of America, the Motion Picture Association of America, Pepsico International, the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, and the Food and Drug Administration. Of course meeting the people mentioned was great, but learning about the different positions and administrations was an even greater experience. From of all of my experiences, the most vivid in my mind is meeting Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia and watching a Supreme Court argument.
Words cannot describe how amazing my time in D.C. really was. My experiences, though, aren’t the only thing I took away from the Washington Semester Program. I now know what direction I want my life to go in. I recently applied to the Heinz School for an accelerated master’s in public policy and management and am going back to D.C. this summer to continue working for the EPA to fulfill my SCEP hours requirement. Upon graduation I hope to return to the EPA full-time and move throughout the government. My decision to study in Washington, D.C. turned out to be one of the best and most influential decisions of my life.

If you’re searching for a trendy restaurant, a great atmosphere, and a mouth-watering menu, Nakama, a Japanese steak house located on East Carson Street, is the answer to your culinary prayers. Nakama, meaning “group of friends” in Japanese, provides visitors with good times, great people, and the option to either sip your cocktail around the spacious bar or move on to a sushi station or a hibachi table to enjoy a delectable meal. This restaurant is perfect for a date or an evening with friends and family — it fits everyone’s bill. As a traditional Japanese-style dining restaurant, Nakama proves to be an enjoyable and invigorating experience. The crowd at Nakama is young and fresh and so is the atmosphere; and, as a result, the restaurant is usually packed.
One will be sure to enjoy the food, artistic ambiance, and crowd at Nakama. The bar is constantly bustling with people, most of them members of the young and trendy Pittsburgh culture. When dining with a date, I would definitely recommend sitting around the bar area. It is the perfect intimate place to get to know someone over tasty food and great conversation. If dining with a big group and ordering wine, try the clean slate Riesling white wine. Being a Japanese restaurant, sake is also a good option. Nothing goes better with a heavenly Japanese meal than a shot of sake with your friends. Among the sushi, the spicy California roll, shrimp tempura roll, seared ahi tuna, yakitori, and the spicy tuna roll are definitely notable choices. Even the vegetarian sushi is mouth-watering with its fresh avocado and crunchy asparagus. Excellent starter choices include the squid salad, seared tuna, cold noodles, and steak skewers. The steak skewers are especially good when dining with a large party; they are tender beef sticks marinated in spices and are perfect for finger picking.
For the main course, if sitting in the hibachi section, it is expected that one orders hibachi, and diners will not regret it. Sitting in a dimly lit room with total strangers may sound awkward, but nothing brings folks together better than the collective misuse of chopsticks. Whether it is the veggie delight, the sesame chicken, or the steak, watching one’s food being prepared, interacting with the chef, and enjoying the company of other diners makes for a unique experience. 
The chefs first come out and introduce themselves. They follow this introduction by demonstrating tricks with ingredients and fire from the hibachi grill. These specially trained chefs prepare all of the food right in front of their diners. They slice, dice, and julienne with lightning speed. All entrees, from sesame chicken to hibachi scallops, are served with a flambe, soup, and assorted sides. The hibachi portions are huge; however, the drawback of the hibachi section is that diners have to pay $10 to share their food with their friends. The beginning price of a hibachi dish is around $16, but it can go up to about $55. However, the food and service at Nakama are definitely worth the price.
If celebrating a friend’s birthday, this is definitely a great place for the occasion. At the end of a birthday dinner, the Nakama staff comes out with a gong, sparklers, cake, and ice cream, making your celebration truly special. The service at Nakama is extremely good and the staff is very attentive. The one drawback of this restaurant is the high price. Each person ends up paying $40 each if they order a couple of drinks, an appetizer, and a Hibachi dinner dish.
Despite the high price, this restaurant is definitely worth going to. After a meal, there are many bars and other great places located on East Carson Street to visit. Definitely make a reservation for the hibachi section beforehand because you may not be able to get a table by just walking in, especially on a weekend. Also, if you choose to dine late, you can definitely get a table after 9:30 p.m. when the place slows down a notch, making it possible to move around. If you do get a reservation before 9:30 p.m., try to be on time, if not early.
Nakama is one of the best teppanyaki places in Pittsburgh. It is simply not possible to go hungry and unsatisfied with a meal from Nakama. By the end of the meal, you and your friends will be clinking Buddha mugs and ordering another round of sake, having thoroughly enjoyed the meal.
Nakama is located at 1611 East Carson Street. You can make a reservation by calling (412) 381-6000.

It takes a lot to put an album together. From writing lyrics to orchestrating all the music to producing songs in full, it’s undoubtedly a big task for anyone involved. Now imagine that you — and you alone — are in charge of all three of these jobs. For Bryce Avary, it’s just another day at the office.
Avary is the brains and the brawn behind The Rocket Summer, a piano- and guitar-driven pop-rock solo project that’s been flying under the radar for the past couple of years. After releasing three full-length albums and four EPs, The Rocket Summer unveils its latest release, Of Men and Angels, this Tuesday.
The album’s opening track, “Roses,” wastes no time easing you into the musical and lyrical themes of the remaining songs. Starting off energetically and singing lyrics like “And I believe I’ll move the mountains,” Avary proves to listeners that he is not afraid to make bold statements.
The Rocket Summer’s first single off the new album is entitled “Walls.” To no surprise, the song is uplifting and hopeful, declaring, “I’ll help you break the walls down; and bust you out and take you home; believe in me, you are not alone.”
Sometimes, Avary intentionally presents an ambiguity in his songs as to whether they have Christian meanings. However, there is no doubt that the title track of this new album was written about God. The song starts off with a soft piano, then builds up to a powerful chorus with Avary proclaiming, “Here I am dear Lord, tasting hints of fame, and I don’t want it anymore if it’s not you that I gain.” This song is an example of Avary clandestinely criticizing many artists in today’s music business. Citing an earlier song, “A Song Is Not a Business Plan” off The Rocket Summers’s 2007 release Do You Feel, Avary often writes about modern popular musicians: “This is me saying words I actually mean; I won’t compromise this thing just to make it.”
“Hills and Valleys” is a strongly piano-driven song, recounting the early days when the band traveled cross-country while living out their dream, a lyrical theme similar to The Rocket Summer’s previous tune also off Do You Feel titled “Colors.”
The interestingly named “Japanese Exchange Student” shows Avary’s ability to use light-hearted lyrics to explain a serious issue. At one time, he sings “The thrill wears off, and then I’m alone,” while later he urges “So be nice to the Japanese exchange student.” Upon first listen, the song might seem a bit depressing, talking about loneliness and not fitting in, but Avary isn’t a fan of negative vibes and by the song’s finish, listeners are left with a feel-good story.
“Tara, I’m Terrible” is a stripped-down song, with only vocals and an acoustic guitar. Lyrically, it goes off the road that Avary usually walks. Musically, it’s produced very differently from the other tracks on Of Men and Angels, as well as from his previous releases.
“Let You Go” is another piano-driven song with optimistic lyrics that affirm the relationship that Avary has with someone special. Unlike what the title suggests, Avary claims that he will not let that special someone go, and he provides more optimism and cheery words to his friend, saying, “I hope the new grass you seek is greener than the greenest green.”
At about two and a half minutes into the closing song, “Light,” the music really picks up and assumes the role of a grand finale; then, after the energetic moments, it gradually fades into a softer melody. With this conclusion, Avary has lifted us up, brought us along an inspirational journey, and slowly brought us back home.
One of the most important parts of the album isn’t even contained on the disc: It’s the cover. Avary explained how the cover art reflects the overall theme of his latest release in an interview with www.altpress.com, saying, “I wanted to illustrate a moment that showed someone leaning up against a wall pondering, perhaps focusing on the problems of life, but unbeknownst to this person, on the other side of the wall is an angel blocking so much trouble from him.” It deals with the times when life isn’t so kind to us, but there might be more to the problems that we can’t even see. He added, “You have to remain hopeful and faithful throughout trials even when it can be hard to.”
If you’ve been a fan of The Rocket Summer in the past, then you most definitely will not be disappointed with Of Men and Angels, as Avary uses a musical formula that has proven successful in the past. Sure, the new album may seem repetitive if you allow it to be, as the amount of instrumentation in each song is limited and there are frequent familiar lyrical themes; however, if you choose to look at each song as a piece of art, by itself, you’ll see that each uplifting story is a gem. These songs have their own independent value that, as is most likely Avary’s intent with his music, will make you smile.

Last summer, I studied abroad in Shanghai, China for approximately two months. Other than suffering from Facebook withdrawal, all in all, China was definitely a good study abroad experience for me.
Even though I am an American, I was able to explore China much more discreetly as a tourist than most Americans would have. I am a Chinese heritage student, so physically, I look just like a typical Chinese citizen. This made touring the country much easier. Caucasian students fascinated the Chinese and most heads would turn at the sight of them. This part I was happy to miss out on, since I am not keen on extra attention from strangers. Some locals would even take pictures of them, some with their permission, others without. For my personal preference, I was glad that I was able to tour different parts of China without drawing too much attention.
Even Asians that were not Chinese were drawn out. Most American people cannot tell a Chinese person apart from a Korean person or a Japanese person. However, most Asians can tell different ethnicities apart. One of my Korean classmates was just walking along a shopping street when one of the salesmen started talking to her in Korean to try to get her to buy his products. In general, because I am ethnically Chinese, it made bargaining a lot easier since salespeople did not assume that I was foreign. Once bargainers know that their customer is foreign, they will automatically bump up the price unnecessarily high. This makes bargaining a hard-earned skill, which can end in feeling very satisfied if you are able to get a good deal.
Of course, touring China was not my main objective when I decided to study abroad this summer. My main motive was to improve my Chinese reading, writing, and speaking skills. By taking Chinese class every day of the week for hours at a time, I think I definitely improved my reading and writing skills. What helped my speaking the most was interacting with people in the streets, bargaining with salespeople, and in general, just being in China. I agree with the thought that if you really want to learn a language well, you should go to the country and live there for a couple months and immerse yourself in the language. I am glad that I went to China because I did what I went there to do: improve my Chinese.
Before my trip, I would rarely speak out in Chinese, because even though I understood the language pretty fluently, I was not able to form the sentences in my head quickly enough. I always had to think of a response in English, translate it in my head to Chinese, and then finally attempt to say it out loud. To be honest, I was a little ashamed that my speaking was so broken, since I grew up in a Chinese-speaking family. One of my experiences in China exemplified these feelings completely. I was in a taxi, on my way to some tourist spot, when the taxi driver tried to make conversation with my classmates and me. He could tell that I was ethnically Chinese, and he questioned why I still had to learn Chinese. He told us a story about how his nephew, who grew up in Kentucky, was able to speak Chinese fluently and asked why I could not do the same. I was not sure how to answer this question. After that encounter, it made me even more motivated to learn to speak, read, and write fluently in Chinese.
This trip was a mixture of realizing my shortcomings as a non-fluent Chinese heritage student and experiencing what it feels like to live in China on my own. I was pushed to improve my Chinese by myself and by a simple conversation with a taxi driver. At the same time, I was also able to explore my Asian roots, through lessons of history and touring the country. Overall, my experiences in China proved to be extremely beneficial; I was able to truly unveil a whole new part of myself.

For anyone familiar with the plotline, Dear John evokes from audiences exactly what’s expected: tears. Every movie based on a book by Nicholas Sparks seems to have this effect on viewers. Dear John is a movie adaptation of an extremely moving novel of the same name about young love beleaguered by complications. The relationship between the two lead characters is focused on bittersweet loss, but is softened by the sweet manifestation of the actors in a way that feels like triumph to the audiences. ‘’Dear John’’ traditionally refers to the kind of letter written by a girl to a boy when she wants to break up and, therefore, the plotline of the movie is not all surprising.
The film, directed by Lasse Hallström, is based on the literary relationship between Special Forces soldier John (Channing Tatum) and college student Savannah (Amanda Seyfried), who meet in 2001 during his leave and her spring break on the coast of South Carolina. The two characters, from extremely different parts of society, fall in love. While John is staying with his father, Savannah is working on a project to build houses for the underprivileged over spring break. Soon enough, the break ends and John has to part ways with his lover. However, he plans to leave the service when his tour ends to be with Savannah, and this keeps their love and drive alive. They vow to keep in touch, write old-fashioned letters to each other, and gaze at the moon with the hope to meet again soon.
After the attacks on the World Trade Center, John feels it is his duty to re-enlist. The two exchange letters over the years as additional hurdles arise. Other characters include John’s emotionally withdrawn, obsessive, coin-collecting father (Richard Jenkins) and Savannah’s best friend (Henry Thomas), whose son is autistic. However, the plot of the movie revolves around the relationship of Savannah and John. This relationship blooms through war and family issues.
This movie falls within the mediocre range of Sparks’ various film adaptations. The attempt to bring a warm feeling to the audience matches that of the book to an extent; however, it doesn’t do the book justice. Furthermore, these movies cannot be compared to the ability of movies such as The Notebook and A Walk to Remember to stir up emotions.
The relationship between Savannah and John and their likability is definitely one of the strengths of this movie. It would be hard for audiences not to wish that Savannah and John be together forever. If you enjoy movies based on novels by Sparks — with emotion and drama abounding — then this is a must-see. However, if not, this movie is sadly not worth watching — just read the book instead.

Dear Hoskins Brothers,
I’m looking for a new girlfriend. I’ve noticed that all the drama girls are much more attractive than the girls in my major; however, talking to them makes me want to vomit. What should I do? Is it okay to date someone for strictly physical reasons?
Sincerely,
—Looking for Own Leading Lady
Dear LOLL,
First of all, there are many attractive girls in every major at Carnegie Mellon. But you shouldn’t pursue girls just because they’re attractive. You need to find a girl you enjoy talking to, one you’re genuinely interested in. You can’t have any real connection or happiness with another person based on looks alone.
Okay, that should satisfy the womenfolk. They’ve probably stopped reading by now. Here’s what you gotta do: The next time you’re in a conversation with a drama major, just nod, smile, and repeat her name often. They’re like adorable little puppies. They only listen for their name and to the tone of your voice. While she’s talking about whatever drama majors talk about, amuse yourself by doing some math problems in your head. Show her who the real actor is by looking interested.
Or if this doesn’t work, just break out the good old binoculars and find a good vantage point.
Sincerely,
—Brian Hoskins
Dear Hoskins Brothers,
Help me please! I have a crush on a friend of mine, but he’s totally oblivious. I’ve been after this guy for months now and nothing has seemed to work. Granted, I have yet to outright tell him that I’m interested, but I’m afraid of making the first move. What should I do?
Sincerely,
—Fear Really Approaching Interest for Date
Dear FRAID,
Why exactly are you talking to me? Of all the guys there are, there’s really only one you should be having this conversation with — your crush. I know you may be worried that if he turns you down you’ll ruin your friendship, but if you put in the effort that won’t happen.
It will be awkward at first, but over time it’ll get back to normal. That may sound bad, but it’s better than spending your time pining away for some guy that doesn’t know any better. Maybe he feels the same about you, but like you, is too afraid to say anything.
This is the 21st century — don’t be afraid to be the one to start something. Guys like a little initiative. Or you could just start collecting his toenails.
Sincerely,
—Patrick Hoskins

Expect big waves to be made this year in the indie music scene. 2009 was a year of creationism — genres were mixed, new synthetic sounds were discovered, and artists were as audacious and dicey as ever. From this spectacular year in music, we can only expect to see more benefits in 2010. Here is a list of some fresh contemporary artists who can be expected to rise to popularity and rule the 2010 indie music scene with an iron guitar.
Real Estate
This psychedelic midi-pop quartet hailing from Ridgewood, N.J. released their self-titled debut album, Real Estate, in November 2009. Popular songs from this first album like “Suburban Beverage” and “Snow Days” mix muted vocals with clean guitar to create an addictive summer sound similar to that of Girls and Beach House.
Often described as a component in the creation of the new sub-genre of lo-fi, Real Estate is actually considered to be a side project by its band members. Guitarist Mathew Mondanile previously recorded under the successful synth-pop alias Ducktails, while drummer Etienne Duguay was a member of a group known as Predator Vision. The band has recently been recording together in Brooklyn, N.Y.
Local Natives
Local Natives, a band formerly known as Cavil at Rest, released their debut album, Gorilla Manor, in the United States just last week to rave reviews. The band first started to attract attention when they played at the South by Southwest music festival in Austin, Texas last year.
Popular songs like “Sun Hands” and “Camera Talk” feature intricate drums and hypnotic vocal harmonies that are often compared in quality to those of Fleet Foxes, a band that truly saw success in 2009. The five band members, who all share a home in Orange County, Calif., will soon embark on a worldwide tour playing small venues through Europe and the United States and hitting all the major indie music festivals. See www.thelocalnatives.com for show dates and news about the band.
Crystal Castles
After the 2008 debut of their self-titled album, Crystal Castles became the obsession of open-minded indie bloggers everywhere, and fans have been eagerly awaiting the group’s sophomore release. The electro duo, made up of vocalist Alice Glass and instrumentalist Ethan Kath, formed the band in 2003 in Ontario, Canada.
While this group has already seen a significant amount of success with their popular experimental electric tracks from their first album, fans have been raving about the group’s newest songs ever since they began playing them live. While no release date has been set and the album has yet to be named, some song names have been confirmed, including “Violent Dreams” and “Pap Smear.” Look for shows so that you too can hear a glimpse of this anticipated album, and keep your eyes peeled for any up and coming release news.

It must have been a slow news week at Carnegie Tech, as the front page story involves the imminent hiring of two assistant baseball managers. The day a Pittsburgh-based baseball team makes front-page news in anything, I’ll eat my hat.

Women’s housing was forced to undergo some changes this year, as many women’s dormitories were overcrowded at the beginning of the semester. Wait. At some point this school had too many women? Now I’ve heard everything.

An article declares that informal polls have shown that the campus community is not concerned about a recent spate of muggings and would not consider hiring extra security forces. Let’s just hope this lack of extra security doesn’t come back to bite us later.

A brawl broke out on the Greek Quadrangle this week when more than 100 brothers of Sigma Alpha Epsilon and Kappa Sigma began fighting after a Kap Sig party went awry. Campus police even had to call in for backup from the city, proving that 1985 was probably wrong in not hiring extra security.

SPIRIT funded a talk by Malik Zulu Shabazz, chairman of the New Black Panther Party, despite his visit being denied funding by Student Senate. If more clubs at Carnegie Mellon were willing to take funding into their own hands, then maybe The Tartan could hire a comedian to write these jokes for me.

Oregon Trail and Lemonade Stand games on an Apple II computer probably raise a sense of nostalgia among many who played these games as children. Although obsolete in the United States now, eight-bit games are making a comeback for educational purposes in developing countries through the work of Ph.D. student Derek Lomas at the Human-Computer Interaction Institute (HCII) and his organization, Playpower.
The original inspiration came from a 2007 internship with Qualcomm in India, where Lomas noticed inexpensive computers, about $12 in U.S. dollars, being sold in Indian markets. While experimenting to see how well the computers, based off only an eight-bit processor, worked, he discovered that they had the ability to play video games similar to Nintendo Entertainment System (NES). With most of the NES patents expired and a wealth of information left by hackers of the system, this seemed to be a perfect opportunity for Lomas to begin creating free educational video games for a new generation of learners.
“It is exciting to see games like these being made available at little or no cost to students around the world and re-creating the cycle of educational impact,” said Daniel Siewiorek, director of the HCII.
An idea that generated interest among volunteers was of incorporating Hindu mythology into the games, creating a cultural component to attract young users. “One of the goals of the project has to do with the fact that video games are a cultural expression that is only really expressed in countries that are rich enough to afford PS3. The idea that you could have games reflective of these cultures where it could be bought by a common person ... is pretty cool,” Lomas said.
For example, Hanuman, an ape-like god of immense power and a reincarnation of Shiva, is the hero in the first game. This game teaches typing not only as a skill, but also as a pathway to job opportunities. “Being comfortable typing on a computer might help not just to teach [users] to type quickly, but to give them a culture with computers. That is important,” Lomas said. 
With the success of the movie Slumdog Millionaire in 2008, the second game will appeal to families in India. It is hoped that this quiz show game will encourage families to discuss topics together as they play it on their television screen. A third video game addresses the public health issue of malaria in India, as children kill mosquitoes and buy nets and kerosene for protection.
Awarded $180,000 in grants last year from the MacArthur Foundation, Playpower hopes to have the video games prepared for June to present to the foundation. After that, the games would be introduced into manufacturing and everyday households, rewarding the work of over 100 global volunteers. The collaborative effort also held a two-week workshop in India in December in which three Carnegie Mellon professors participated.
“I see Playpower as an initiative to develop a broader community who will work on e-learning games for underprivileged children in developing countries,” said Matthew Kam, Lomas’s adviser. “As such, Playpower is one mechanism for us to get our research results into the hands of real-world designers.”
Although Playpower has numerous volunteers, there are few in Pittsburgh. Lomas sees students as potential volunteers, as he suggests that volunteer work for Playpower could be incorporated into the classroom — especially with computer science and electrical and computer engineering students at Carnegie Mellon.
“Hardware hacking, assembly programming, music ... there are many ways students can help, even helping finish the designs of the games if they don’t program,” Lomas said. Lomas encouraged interested persons to visit volunteers.playpower.org.
Lomas explained that he feels his project has found a home at Carnegie Mellon. “Maybe the best thing is that I was able to come to Carnegie Mellon with this project because there is an acceptance here for doing research that has an impact,” he said.

Carnegie Mellon has recently announced one of its lowest tuition increases in decades. This year’s increase of 2.98 percent for all undergraduates follows on the heels of last year’s even smaller increase of 2.94 percent.
Although the tuition increase is the same for undergraduates, students will still pay different amounts, ranging from $39,222 to $41,500, depending on their class level.
“Carnegie Mellon has had a system of tiered increases in the past that helped to hold the line on costs for enrolled students,” said Ken Walters, Carnegie Mellon’s senior media relations director. “For students who entered Carnegie Mellon in 2006, tuition will be $39,222. Tuition for students who came to Carnegie Mellon in 2007 will be $40,740. For students who entered the university in 2008 or 2009, tuition will be $41,500.”
Room and board costs for undergraduates staying on campus have also increased by 4 to 6 percent, depending on the particular living accommodations. On average, housing will now cost $6500 (including the $300 reservation fee) per year, while board will cost $4500. In total, the Carnegie Mellon admissions department estimates that the 2010–11 academic year will cost upperclassmen upwards of $50,000, while incoming first-years will pay upwards of $52,000.
According to The Chronicle of Higher Education, Carnegie Mellon is the most expensive educational institution in Pennsylvania and the seventh most expensive in the country this academic year.
“It is worth noting that Carnegie Mellon has always delivered exceptional educational programs at a comparatively low cost, as compared to many of our peer institutions,” said Michael Murphy, the vice president for campus affairs. “In fact, U.S. News and World Report rated the university as a Great School, Great Price in its rankings this year.”
The new tuition increase is, by a significant margin, one of Carnegie Mellon’s smallest increases in 35 years, slightly larger than last year’s record-breaking lowest increase of 2.94 percent. Prior to 2009, Carnegie Mellon’s tuition increased between 5 and 8 percent each year, but the university quickly re-evaluated this practice after the economic recession hit.
“Carnegie Mellon uses tuition to sustain educational and student life programs and initiatives of all types, as well as to support financial aid, which is especially critical at this time,” Murphy said. “These economic times present a challenge for the university, but also for our students and their families, so a relatively low increase is the right thing to do.”
Of course, tuition increases, no matter how small, are never welcomed by anyone, particularly during tough economic times. This conflict is heightened by the community’s and the city’s recent debate over a proposed tuition tax. However, there seems to be a general sentiment among the campus community that such increases are necessary to maintain the quality that is unique to Carnegie Mellon.
“I find it hard to hold it against the university because they hire top-tier teachers and researchers, and that is expensive,” said sophomore business administration major Jie Zhao. 
“Many of us probably came here to learn from these people, so it makes sense that we should have to pay for them and to keep them.”
Murphy agrees that tuition increases are neccesary to maintain the quality of the university.
“We continually hear the same refrain from both parents and students — that maintaining the extraordinary quality of our educational programs is of paramount importance to them.”
Even with one of the highest tuitions in the country, Carnegie Mellon still must rely on the charity of donors and alumni, as well as on other various student fees, to break even. 
“Tuition does not cover the total cost of educating a full-time student.” Murphy said. “We work very hard, just as our students do, to continuously enhance our standing as one of the world’s great universities.”

On Feb. 10, web giant Google outlined its plans to offer ultra-high-speed broadband Internet services to a select few locations across the nation. The communities Google selects will be “testbed” communities that serve to demonstrate the benefits of faster broadband access. 
The Internet service is predicted to operate at speeds of 1 gigabit per second. Google’s fiber-optic initiative is said to be more than 100 times faster than the speeds available to consumers today. The company has confirmed that it will pay for the construction and operation of the services and will charge customers prices competitive to current services.
Two days later, on Feb. 12, Mayor Luke Ravenstahl announced his ambition for the city of Pittsburgh to be selected as one of these “testbed” communities. 
Soon after, Carnegie Mellon also declared its intent to assist the city in its endeavor. 
Last week, President Jared L. Cohon stated in a press release that “[Carnegie Mellon and the city of Pittsburgh] are excited that Google plans to deploy ultra-high-speed networks in locations around the country.... As a leader in innovative broadband networking, Carnegie Mellon is pleased to partner with Mayor Ravenstahl, the City of Pittsburgh, UPMC, the University of Pittsburgh, and other community institutions and businesses to bring one of these networks to our community.”
Support from important businesses and institutions will also go a long way in contributing to the city’s bid. The University of Pittsburgh Medical Center, a recognized leader in advanced health care technology, has recently identified itself as one such supporter. The University of Pittsburgh has also declared an interest in partnering in this effort.
In order for the city to be chosen, it is crucial that it garner community support for the project. First-year CIT student Benjamin Wasserman is one of a growing number of individuals who support the city’s pursuit of Google’s new service.
“The city is in a state of growth. Pittsburgh is symbolic of development and modernization, and the fact that the G-20 was here last year shows that ... super-high-speed broadband would only develop the city even more,” Wasserman said.
David Sandor, a first-year economics major, shares Wasserman’s excitement for faster web services.
“I say go for it. If [Carnegie Mellon] can help the city bring Google’s services here and it turns out to be successful, I am sure it will strengthen the university’s reputation as a technological center,” said Wasserman.
Tim Hoffman, a professor in the school of computer science believes that  Pittsburgh’s prusuit of the new broadband service will provide benefits to the city as a whole, echoing the thoughts of both president Cohon and Wasserman. “It can only be good for the city,” he said. “It provides more jobs and creates an incentive for Google to stay in Pittsburgh.”
Hoffman was, however, also quick to question the proposal. “On the other hand, I don’t know if Google is asking anything in return. The company may ask for a tax break or rebate.”
Despite doubts, Hoffman hopes that Carnegie Mellon students could contribute to the designation process because of their “willingness to participate.”
If Google were to select Pittsburgh for their project, Hoffman did not doubtthat the company could find helpful “CMU students who [would] volunteer to use the service.”
Whether Google ultimately selects Pittsburgh is yet to be seen, but if Google’s decision process is purely based on enthusiasm, it does not need to look past this city.

Carnegie Mellon’s 14th annual community-wide gender conference, MOSAIC, will be held on Sunday, Feb. 28 from 9 a.m. to 3 p.m. in the University Center. The conference is free and open to the public, and it offers 11 sessions on topics ranging from the history of feminism to the biological and social basis for gender.
“More than awareness, we want to create a space where people can have conversations they may not be able to have otherwise,” said Rowshan Palmer, the advisor for MOSAIC. Echoing that, MOSAIC 2010 offers sessions on often-controversial issues, from “What Feminists say about Pornography” to “The (In)visibility of Transmen.”
Ashley Brown, the MOSAIC Committee chair and the Student Life gender/GLBT intern, agreed that “the MOSAIC gender conference pulls in interest from every part of the gender/GLBT spectrum, allowing everyone to find his or her own session topic of choice.”
Students attending MOSAIC will also be offered the opportunity to become locally involved with issues of gender relations and construction.
One in Four, a national organization whose name comes from the statistic that one in four college women has survived rape or attempted rape since her 14th birthday, will host “How to Help a Sexual Assault Survivor: What Men Can Do.” This session will offer men advice on what to do if a sexual assault victim approaches them for help, with the goal of empowering men to help eliminate sexual assault on campuses nationwide. 
In a session titled “Making a Difference — Locally!” students will also be invited to volunteer with a variety of local community groups including 100 Black Men, Big Brothers Big Sisters, and Strong Women, Strong Girls.
Lisa Tetrault is leading a session titled “F-Word: Feminism 101.” The presentation will provide a brief history of feminism and facilitate a discussion on the modern connotations of the word “feminism.” 
“I think it is useful to discuss why it is young women feel it is so dangerous to identify as a feminist and to understand that this identification does have real costs,” Tetrault said.
MOSAIC is seen as especially important to H&SS’s relatively unknown gender studies minor. Kristina Straub, the faculty advisor for the minor, described the gender studies courses as popular with students in a variety of majors, despite low enrollment in the minor. She explained that “having that mix of majors contributes to an interdisciplinary discussion. Gender studies, in some of its best instantiations, is interdisciplinary.”
The conference will end with a live student performance of The Vagina Monologues, directed by first-year drama major Lio Sigerson. MOSAIC’s closing will also include the screening of clips from a filmed performance of The Men’s Story Project. According to the official website www.mensstoryproject.org, The Men’s Story is a “public performance and community dialogue project that explores social ideas about masculinity, using the arts as a medium for community-building and social change.”
Carnegie Mellon also hosts other events throughout the year focused on women and gender studies. These include upcoming events in March, for Women’s History Month, and Speak Your Mind, a series of monthly discussions on current events.
MOSAIC is sponsored by Student Life, Student Dormitory Council, Women’s Leadership Institute, Student Senate, Multicultural and Diversity Initiatives, the Activities Board, and a number of other groups.

Student Senate, Student Dormitory Council, Student Affairs, and much of the student body are buzzing with excitement about this year’s Black History Month keynote speaker at Carnegie Mellon: CNN Education Contributor Steve Perry. Perry has been revolutionizing education in America and is particularly influential in the African American community.
Born on his mother’s 16th birthday, into his family’s third generation of poverty, Perry personifies his belief that the success of a life is determined by where one ends, not where one starts. The first in his family to receive a high school diploma, Perry also went on to graduate from college, obtain a master’s degree in social work from the University of Pennsylvania, and later recieved a Ph.D. in education.
Perry is on a mission to close the achievement gap and transform the lives of underprivileged and minority children by providing tools to gain access to a college education.
Perry’s visit is sure to attract a diverse crowd of students and faculty. M. Shernell Smith, the director of multicultural initiatives in the Office of Student Affairs, has been instrumental in bringing Perry to campus. 
“For the last few years, Carnegie Mellon has wanted to redefine the way we celebrate Black History Month and focus it less on race and more on empowering our students to act and make a positive impact in their community. I believe Perry will be the catalyst for positive discussion and action on campus,” she said.
Perry was featured on the 2009 CNN special Black in America, which showcased Capital Preparatory Magnet School in Hartford, Conn., which Perry founded and where he now acts as principal. U.S. News and World Report cited Capital Preparatory as one of the best high schools in the nation. Perry’s school has sent 100 percent of its low-income, minority, first-generation high school graduates to four-year colleges every year since its establishment in 2004.
His segment on CNN during “Black in America” was so well received that Perry was asked by CNN to become the education contributor and is frequently on AC360 with Anderson Cooper and other CNN programs discussing national education-focused initiatives.
Stephanie Schneider, a sophomore business administration major and Student Senator, said that she is looking forward to the event. “Coming from a school  with people from so many backgrounds, I hope Dr. Perry can share with us how he encouraged people to live against stereotypes and understand they can be anything they want to be. It’s something we will be able to carry on wherever we go in life,” Schneider said. 
“My hometown has a huge achievement gap and the administration have [sic] not been able to encourage its closure. I am excited to see how he motivated his students, since it is something so many people have been trying to do for years,” Schneider said. “I wish I could bring my hometown administration to come, and see what he has to say. It’s a serious issue where I come from that nobody knows how to fix.”
Carnegie Mellon Student Body President Rotimi Abimbola is also very enthusiastic about Perry’s lecture. “I think it’s important for people like Dr. Perry to come to speak at Carnegie Mellon during Black History Month so people can understand how far the black community has progressed,” Abimbola said. 
“He’s not just coming to talk about education for inner-city black kids; he’s coming to talk about education in America.... What’s really important to understand is that Dr. Perry’s impact on education is impacting the future of America.”
Perry will be speaking at McConomy Auditorium at 7 p.m. on Wednesday.

Skloot to discuss new book
Carnegie Mellon’s English department and the Victor E. Bearg Scholars in Humanities and Sciences Speaker Series will host award-winning nonfiction and science writer Rebecca Skloot. Skloot will discuss her newly released book, The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks. 
This nonfiction piece discusses an individual whose cancerous cells were removed, without her knowledge, in the 1950s by doctors at Johns Hopkins University. These cells were to become the first “immortal” human cells grown. Called “HeLa” cells, they have played important roles in medical research from the development of the polio vaccine to current work on in vitro fertilization and gene mapping.
Skloot’s feature stories, essays, and reviews have appeared in a vast array of publications, including The New York Times Magazine, Discover, the Columbia Journalism Review, and O, The Oprah Magazine. Skloot is also a contributing editor for Popular Science and has been a correspondent for multimedia programs including NPR and PBS.
Skloot currently teaches creative nonfiction in the MFA program at the University of Memphis. She is also is a faculty member at the yearly Mid-Atlantic Summer Creative Nonfiction Writers Conference and a former University of Pittsburgh non-fiction faculty member.  
Skloot has an undergraduate degree in biomedical science from Colorado State University and a master's degree in non-fiction from the University of Pittsburgh.
STUDIO hosts Gibson, Recoder
Carnegie Mellon’s  STUDIO for Creative Inquiry will host media-based performers Sandra Gibson and Luis Recoder as a part of the center’s symposium on new approaches to media performance. Gibson and Recoder will lecture on the concept and process of media-based performance. After the lecture, the artists will present a performance centered on multiple 16-millimeter projectors with live audio.
The live piece employs a variety of non-art objects including 16-millimeter loops, spray bottles, colored gels, unfocused lenses, and hand shadows. These objects will combine to create slowly transforming light sculptures.
Gibson and Recoder have shown their collaborative film installations and performances at film festivals, museums, galleries, and alternative venues since 2001. They have exhibited their work at prestigious institutions including the Whitney Museum of American Art, The Kitchen, Robert Beck Memorial Cinema, and Mighty Robot in New York City; Hallwalls Contemporary Arts in Buffalo, N.Y.; and the Images Festival in Toronto.
The STUDIO for Creative Inquiry’s symposium lectures are free and open to the public. Seating is limited and first-come, first-served.

Toward the Bionic Human: Medical Devices and How They Are Powered
Today at 4:30 p.m.
Gregg Hall (Porter Hall 100)
The first human implant of a lithium battery took place over 35 years ago, and undoubtedly times have changed and technologies have improved. Back then, the battery was a lithium-iodine cell used for powering a cardiac pacemaker. Recently, a number of other battery systems — including pacemakers, neurostimulators, drug pumps, implantable cardiac defibrillators, and heart assistance or replacement devices — have been developed and successfully implemented in the medical world. 
Although the power cells used in these apparatuses vary, there are requirements that all cells must meet, including safety, reliability, low weight, small size, predictability of performance, low self-discharge, and an end-of-life indication. 
In her talk, Esther S. Takeuchi (SUNY distinguished professor at the University of Buffalo for chemical and biological engineering, electrical engineering, and chemistry) will also discuss cell parameters and device performance factors.
A Self-Determination Theory View of Close Relationships: Does Autonomy Help or Hurt?
Today at 4:30 p.m.
Erwin Steinberg Auditorium (Baker Hall A53)
Research has proven that autonomous motivation has positive consequences for heuristic performance as well as psychological well-being. Evidence also shows that when authority figures support the people they are responsible for, those people become more autonomous and display positive outcomes. 
However, it is often debated that in close relationships it is necessary to forego autonomy in order to have a successful relationship.
In his lecture, Edward L. Deci (Helen F. and Fred H. Gowen Professor in the department of clinical and social sciences in psychology at the University of Rochester) will review several studies that have found positive results for autonomy in close friendships, romantic partnerships, and developing relationships.
School of Art Lecture Series Presents: Paul Ramirez Jonas
Tuesday, Feb. 23 
at 5 p.m.
Kresge Theatre 
(College of Fine Arts)
Although he considers himself only a reader, Paul Ramirez Jonas uses pre-existing texts (diaries and old photographs) as a score, where the act of reading is manifested in the form of a performance, sculpture, photograph, or video. 
According to Jonas, these are simply re-enactments. He also claims to have more in common with the public than with the author of the original works. As for himself, he serves as a contact point between the artwork and the public. His work has been exhibited in Amsterdam, Stockholm, and New York.
Daring to Leap: The Quest for Purpose
Thursday, Feb. 25
at 4:30 p.m.
Gregg Hall (Porter Hall 100)

Welcome to not just the season for flooding from melting snow, but for a flooding of campus with a variety of flyers, posters, and postcards; campaigning friends clad in vibrantly colored shirts; and a barrage of solutions to problems you probably didn’t know you had. Yes, it is student government election time, and I am here to remind you that you might actually care. Let’s start with four reasons why.
The administration listens.
Having been a ranking actor in student government for the past two years, I can confirm that Carnegie Mellon’s administration really does listen to students. And, as expected, when they have a question for which they want student input, student government is the first group they ask. The people you elect for the next year will truly be your voice in Warner Hall. Student representation and the way it factors into the administration’s decisions is almost impossible to quantify, but it is likely this same inexactitude that makes it so valuable. These four students — student body president and vice president, vice president for finance, and vice president for organizations — must be able to speak honestly and openly about the overall student experience.
These people control your money.
If intangible benefits are unconvincing, let me provide an entirely quantifiable reason to vote. The $90 student activities fee that you pay each semester is allocated through student government. It pays for most of the budget of nearly every student-run organization and event on this campus. The vice president of finance is responsible for chairing a committee whose task is to fairly distribute about $1.15 million to just under 200 recognized student organizations.
A new position is a new challenge.
For the first time we will elect a student body vice president for organizations (VPO) — a person whose duties involve overseeing CoSO, the committee that decides which clubs are officially recognized by the university, and acting as a voice and a resource for those organizations. While the intent is clear, the exact role is open to interpretation. The person who is elected to this position will likely set the tone for future VPOs, a significant responsibility. How we decide as a student body who is the best person for this position is, in my opinion, an open question.
This year you can vote.
Based on the student body constitution changes that occurred earlier this month, every student has the right to vote. If you are studying abroad, you can vote. If you are a graduate student, no matter what point in your program you are at, you can vote. The days of Carnegie Mellon poll taxes are over — every student can vote.
We are just now at the beginning of the election cycle. Over the coming weeks we will watch as students declare their candidacy; we will read their advertisements and learn their platforms. Shortly before the election, The Tartan will host a debate to help everyone better understand and compare the competing platforms. And then on April 3, voting will begin.
Last year less than 25 percent of the student body voted. This is not due to a lack of advertising on behalf of the Elections Board or the candidates. It can’t be attributed to student government not being important enough to take the two minutes it takes to vote — I hope my arguments above show it is. 
Yet, many might not yet realize the role student government serves. This has hopefully been somewhat remedied this year, with continuing programs like the Loop Bus and the new Tartan Rewards Program and Textbook Flea Market, not to mention student government’s active leadership in rallying against the mayor’s tuition tax.
To potential candidates, I encourage you to talk to current leaders and involved students, and find out which issues are important to campus and present solutions to them. I encourage you to be specific and realistic. Don’t tell me there are “important issues” — tell me what the issues are and suggest ways you might fix them. Student government is not all-powerful, not even close. 
Candidates that can focus on a small number of actually achievable goals which are relevant to the community will draw attention to their platform and their campaign, and will get votes.
Elections are an enjoyable and exciting time for me, not just because this snow is going to melt and it will begin to feel like spring, but because new motivated and passionate students will step up with plans to make this university a better place. That competitive, optimistic spirit embodies Carnegie Mellon.
Good luck, and I will see you at the debates.
Patrick Gage Kelley (pkelley@) will be your campaign manager if you ask nicely.

An ambulance speeds down the street, lights flashing and siren blaring. Then it stops, stuck in the two feet of Pittsburgh snow that has blanketed the ground. 
Paramedics, sworn to the Hippocratic Oath and trained to save lives, sit and discuss their next step. They can walk a few hundred feet through the snow rolling a gurney, or they can give up. To most of us, the choice seems obvious. To the paramedics answering Curtis Mitchell’s 911 call on the weekend of Feb. 5, the choice was also obvious. “If he wants a ride to the hospital, he is just going to have to come down to the truck,” one of them told the dispatcher.
Somehow the first responders we trust to help us in a crisis have confused themselves with chauffeurs. Instead of putting forth effort to save a dying man, these individuals chose to stay in their heated ambulance. Had this happened only once, it still would have been a travesty. But it did not. Mitchell and his girlfriend made 10 calls over two days. By the time help finally arrived, Mitchell was dead.
How, in a city renowned for its excellent medical care, can a man spend over two days waiting for an emergency response? How can what appears to have been an early-recognized case of appendicitis kill a man while his girlfriend watches and Pittsburgh’s emergency services drive back and forth in the snow?
Whatever answers emerge to these questions, they will not be enough to satisfy Mitchell’s family, nor will they satisfy the rest of Pittsburgh’s residents. When we are most vulnerable, we trust police, firemen, and paramedics to put us at ease. The men and women who perform these jobs do heroic deeds every day. And yet, Curtis Mitchell is dead.
In the days since this tragedy, a few facts have come to light. The 911 calls Mitchell made were treated as independent by dispatchers, meaning each ambulance did not know that the previous attempts had failed. As the priority level of the calls increased, they remained unassociated, and so mistakes were repeated time after time. All of this was happening while call centers were being subjected to high call volumes due to snow-related problems.
What we learn from the available data is that the fault for Mitchell’s death lies across many areas of the Pittsburgh emergency medical response system. It lies with the dispatchers who failed to coordinate and the planners who failed to predict the consequences of the snowstorm. It lies with whichever bureaucrat established the policy that paramedics should not walk through the snow to save a life. And it lies with the responders themselves who were mere blocks away from a dying man but turned back, leaving him to suffer.

The opening ceremony of the Olympics is typically met with fanfare and excitement, both on the part of the athletes and the millions around the world who watch the games. This year, however, misfortune and media irresponsibility have marred an otherwise joyful event. On the day of the opening ceremonies, tragedy struck. Nodar Kumaritashvili, a 21-year-old Georgian luger, died in an accident during a preliminary run on the controversial Whistler track — one that had already been criticized for its high speeds.
News of the Georgian’s death reached televisions and computers around the world less than an hour after the accident. A video of the shocking crash was added to NBC’s videos online and was broadcast many times on live TV as well, evidently without consideration of ethical implications.
Since the incident, NBC has come under well-deserved and harsh criticism. NBC’s actions in this situation were brash and insensitive. While the network has a responsibility to provide the news, it should also have respect for the people involved in the stories. Consultation with the family should have occurred before the choice to air the video was made. Instead, the network ceased to show the video only with the insistence of the athlete’s family, who did not want to see it.
We all know the effect that “shock value” has on ratings, but tragedy should not be abused in an effort to garner viewers. With the quality of NBC’s coverage of the Olympic Games already in question, we are concerned as to whether the network deserves its exclusive coverage of the games. We hope in the future that NBC, and media sources in general, will give more consideration to the consequences of their actions before proceeding with their coverage. As journalists, NBC editors and producers must have an ethical standard outside their responsibility to their stockholders.

According to the Committee to Protect Journalists’ (CPJ) 2009 Attacks on the Press Report, 71 journalists were killed in 2009 — making last year the worst on CPJ’s 30-year record. In addition to the large number of deaths, the committee said it also identified 136 imprisoned reporters, editors, and photojournalists, an increase of 11 from 2008.
Here at The Tartan, we simultaneously mourn the loss of these individuals while applauding the creed that they upheld. The history of journalism is one of the most noble; a journalist’s first obligation has always been to the truth.
That obligation is followed by a responsibility to the public: a duty to be an unbiased measure of those in power for the sake of the people. Historically, these ideals have been defended in bitter battles, leaving the history of journalism laced with violence and bloodshed. 
Today, these same ideals have been confronted across the world with a violence that is unfortunately familiar. While the death tolls continue to rise, we can celebrate in the fact that these deaths, while horrific, represent a continued, unshakable commitment to the truth.

Since we were young, we were taught to recognize the common barnyard animals: A cow says “moo” and a pig says “oink,” and the two are by no means related to our hamburger dinner or our BLT sandwich. But at what point did these animals stop being animals and start being food?
We are in the midst of what many consider to be a green revolution; however, few seem to realize the true impact that meat production has on our environment and our bodies. If this nation were to realize these social, economic, and environmental impacts, we could consider possible industry and social reforms to improve the efficiency of meat production and, with this knowledge, stimulate change.
Very few individuals recognize the consequences that the meat-packing industry has had on our economy, environment, and society. As CNN correspondent Jonathan Sanfran Foe says in his article on All-creatures.org, “If the way we raise animals for food isn’t the most important problem in the world right now, it’s arguably the No. 1 cause of global warming: The United Nations reports the livestock business generates more greenhouse gas emissions than all forms of transportation combined.”
The meat industry is one of the largest in the world and, according to www.earthtrends.com, over 280 million metric tons of meat were produced in 2009 alone. Though it is one of the largest modern industries, the meat production process has also proven to be one of the most inefficient industries today. According to one estimate done by the United Nations Food and Agricultural Organization (FAO), the ratio of fossil-fuel energy needed to produce one unit of food energy is 35:1 for beef production, compared to 3:1 for all U.S. agricultural products combined.
As an economic industry, the meat industry is extremely inefficient. An Iowa State study estimated that the “external costs” of agricultural production in the United States — in terms of natural resources, wildlife and ecosystem biodiversity, and human health — amount to between $5.7 billion and $16.9 billion annually. Livestock production alone is estimated to contribute $714 million to $739 million in damages. The meat industry, when considered economically, is not only extremely expensive, but the majority of the money being spent is on waste and methods of production that have not been updated in years.
The production of livestock for meat harvest can be linked to almost every environmental catastrophe confronting our planet. Rainforest destruction, the spreading of deserts, the loss of fresh water, increasing air and water pollution, destructive acid rain, and soil erosion are all linked to the industrialized production of meat. 
Possibly the most commonly understood side effect of the meat packing industry is the intense amounts of carbon dioxide released from the production of meat. The FAO has estimated that direct emissions from meat production account for about 18 percent of the world’s total greenhouse gas emissions.
But what can be done to prevent these terrifying statistics from growing? While it is true that global industry contributors could create more sustainable methods of livestock feeding and crop production, develop proper methods of manure and methane management, or enlist better grazing methods to prevent erosion, these improvements can only be implemented by industry heads. These leaders, more likely than not, are unwilling to act due to economic factors, and as a population we cannot rely on them.
The ball is in our court — it is up to the people to take control of this situation. With no higher powers to take on the responsibility, the typical Carnegie Mellon student is the one who needs to make a difference. The solution is easy: Cut down on meat consumption.
By eating lower on the food chain, individuals can reduce the amount of land needed to support their existence, thus minimizing their ecological footprint. If less land is cultivated for the production of crops or the grazing of livestock, that much more wilderness is left untouched. As a result there will be less soil erosion, less water pollution, less pesticide use, less carbon emission, and less energy use. 
Even just cutting one’s meat consumption in half can be a personally healthy and seemingly effective way to minimize the impact of meat production.
Predictably enough, however, a plant-based diet is the best alternative. Plants are healthy for the body and a proper vegetarian diet has proven effective in reducing heart disease, cancer, and other diet-related diseases. However, while it may be the best solution, a society of vegetarians is largely unrealistic.
Keeping reality in mind, this is a plea from me to the students of Carnegie Mellon and the campus administration: Limit your meat consumption. As an individual you can cut out that burger for an Evgefstos! alternative maybe once or twice a week; even this small initiative will make a difference. Meanwhile, Carnegie Mellon may consider instituting a day of the week where Resnik only serves animal-friendly products. You may even choose to do more to cut meat out for some period of time. Whatever you choose, get educated. Research the subject, discuss it with friends, browse the Internet — when considering your next eco-alternative, remember this article. Change is before us but no one is going to hand it over; it’s up to us to reach out and grab it.

We’ve all heard — and spread — the Carnegie Mellon stereotype: There aren’t that many women who go to school here, and those who do aren’t necessarily the most attractive, especially those in the technical fields. But that could be changing soon, because girls who aspire to be engineers or computer scientists have a new role model: Barbie.
Starting Jan. 11, a month-long poll on www.barbie.com allowed people to vote for their favorite choice of career for Barbie to undertake next. And the result of that voting — computer engineer — is a far cry from the talking Barbie dolls of days past that used to complain that “math class is tough.”
The public’s choice of computer engineer as Barbie’s next career is probably the result of a few different things. The first is a number of Facebook groups, a few of which I was invited to join (and felt obligated to belong to, as a fellow engineer), urging me to vote for Barbie to be a computer engineer. 
But since it’s not possible that all of the computer engineer votes were garnered from Facebook groups, this means that people who are not engineering students in college actually wanted to see Barbie in this career. And this shows a genuine shift in the interest of Barbie’s audience, especially for a doll that used to be mainly concerned with matching her shoes and purse. Now, instead, she can be seen checking her e-mail from her smartphone and chatting on her Bluetooth headpiece (and, of course, wearing a fashionably cool binary-decorated T-shirt while doing so).
Even here at Carnegie Mellon, a school that has a strong technical background, there isn’t a huge number of female engineers. While I was taking Introduction to Electrical and Computer Engineering my first year here, I could count the number of girls in my class using only my fingers, and the total enrollment in this class was probably close to 100 students. It is clear that even at a school where being an engineer isn’t really nerdy, a deficit of females in technical fields exists.
It is my hope that Barbie being an engineer will help to get rid of this deficit, that it gets girls interested in a career to which they might not otherwise give a second thought. Barbie dolls will always be one of a young girl’s first toys, and no matter how young they are, girls notice the different kinds of Barbies that exist — veterinarian Barbie, teacher Barbie, astronaut Barbie. 
And having a computer engineer Barbie will give young girls an introduction to a career decidedly lacking in female participation, an introduction that they might not have otherwise. Hopefully, Barbie will help, even if only in a small way, to remove the “geek” or “nerd” connotation from girls interested in engineering.
Heather Tomko (htomko@) is happy to call Barbie a fellow engineer, even if she’d never, ever wear the binary T-shirt.

We at Carnegie Mellon are great at complaining. We complain about stressful workloads, sleepless nights, and high tuition, to name a few. Most of us have, at least once, compared ourselves with those neighbors down in Oakland and wondered why we couldn’t have easier classes, earlier summers, and an actual life in general. However, for once, we are not the ones who need to complain.
For a change, University of Pittsburgh students will be wishing their university made decisions like ours. That institution has decided to make up the classes that were missed during the three snow days two weeks ago by holding classes on two Saturdays — March 27 and April 17.
Although the three snow days did result in a lot of economic and academic losses for the university, we are glad that Carnegie Mellon has not followed the University of Pittsburgh and decided to make up for the lost time. It is ironic that Carnegie Mellon — which is usually so reluctant to give its students days off — is not trying to schedule make-up classes, but we’re not complaining. The worst that students at Carnegie Mellon may have to endure because of the snow days is a slightly heavier workload, but at least we don’t have to shorten our weekends.
Many students, being from Carnegie Mellon, will probably just sit and study on these two Saturdays anyway, but at least we don’t officially have to. This might be one of those rare times when we could say that Carnegie Mellon students are entitled to have more of a social life than the students at the University of Pittsburgh.
