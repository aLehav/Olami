Every week since the start of the season, the Top 10 has been shaken up as top teams have lost, new teams have won incredible upsets, and teams have climbed up and fallen down the rankings. Week 11, though, was a boring change to the landscape. Only former #5 Oklahoma dropped in the rankings to #9, and the Top 10 teams not named Texas A&M all stayed in the rankings.
This week’s rankings:
It is going to take a major upset to take #1 Georgia, #2 Alabama, or #3 Ohio State out of the playoffs. Georgia traveled to Tennessee and crushed the Volunteers 41-17. #2 Alabama beat New Mexico State at home by 56 in a game that ended 59-3, and #3 Ohio State took down Purdue in a rare Big Ten shootout, with the two teams putting up 90 points between them in a 59-31 blowout. For yet another week, none of these top-three teams were really challenged, and until Ohio State has to play Michigan in two weeks and Georgia plays Alabama in the conference championship, none of them likely will be.
Right now, Alabama and Georgia are cleaning house in their respective divisions in the SEC and are probably going to win out. If they do, Georgia will win the SEC East with an undefeated 12-0 record, and Alabama will carry the West at 11-1. Regardless of who wins the resulting SEC Championship game, it is likely that both will remain in the playoffs.
If Ohio State can win out (and that is a big “if”) in a key Week 13 matchup against Michigan, they should take the Big Ten East, and have a winnable conference championship game against Wisconsin or Iowa. The Big Ten — which started as a five-team gauntlet — is down to only a few contenders, as one-loss #7 Michigan and #3 Ohio State are coming down to the wire.
Further down the table, #4 Cincinnati stays in their spot by picking up their tenth win. #5 Oregon whipped Washington State, and keeps their lead in the Pac-12, while #6 Michigan State cleaned house with Maryland. #7 Michigan edged out Penn State in a 21-17 thriller at Beaver Stadium, and #8 Notre Dame beat Virginia with a defense that only allowed a field goal.
Oklahoma fell to #9 with a loss to Baylor as Texas A&M fell out with a 29-19 loss to Ole Miss. Baylor joins the fray at #10, having taken out the last undefeated Big 12 team.
Next Week:
For the teams in the Top 10, the playoff race is shaping up to be one of three tiers. #1 Georgia is in a tier of their own, undefeated against a strong schedule and barreling towards the playoff. Alabama and Ohio State, two strong one-loss teams, who should be able to win out against their remaining opponents, are ranked at #2 and #3, respectively. If they do not commit any major screwups, they should make the playoffs. #4 Cincinnati, #5 Oregon, #6 Michigan State, and #7 Michigan should all have a shot if they win out in the coming weeks, and the teams below them have little to no shot at making the tournament.

Just two weekends are left ahead of the International Skating Union’s (ISU) 2021-22 Grand Prix Final (GPF). With the conclusion of the 2021 NHK Trophy held in Tokyo, Japan, only the Internationaux de France and Rostelecom Cup are left in the series. The majority of Grand Prix Final places are still up in the air, and athletes will be vying for them over the next couple weeks. However, a few standout skaters have already earned enough points to solidify their place in the tournament.
In the men’s singles category, Japan’s Shoma Uno, alongside Americans Vincent Zhou and Nathan Chen, have secured Grand Prix Final qualification. Uno and Zhou, both having garnered 28 points, mirrored each other’s performances, with Zhou taking gold and Uno taking silver at Skate America back in October; before Uno went on to take gold as Zhou took silver at last week’s NHK Trophy.  Chen, with 26 points, put on an uncharacteristic performance at Skate America, finishing third behind Uno and Zhou, but Chen made a spectacular comeback the following week at Skate Canada, scoring over 300 points and solidifying his spot in the Grand Prix Final. Neither Uno nor Chen are strangers to the Grand Prix Final, with both athletes set to make their fifth appearance at the tournament, but Zhou will make his Grand Prix Final debut. Chen, having won the competition the last three years, will be looking to defend his title as Uno looks to dethrone him. Despite this being his first time competing at the Grand Prix Final, Vincent Zhou is not an athlete to write off, given his commendable performance this year.
Cha Jun-hwan of Korea and Makar Ignatov of Russia are both in qualifying positions with 18 points each after placing third and fourth at the NHK Trophy, respectively. But with Japan’s Yuma Kagiyama (15 points), American Jason Brown (13 points), and Russian Mikhail Kolyada (13 points) all slated to compete in the next two weeks — Kagiyama and Brown in the Internationaux de France and Kolyada in the Rostelecom Cup — neither Cha nor Ignatov are secure in their qualification status. In the likely scenario that Kagiyama, Brown, and Kolyada all finish in fifth place or better in their respective competitions, these three athletes will join Uno, Zhou, and Chen at the Grand Prix Final.
Qualification for the Grand Prix Final in the women’s singles category is still completely up in the air, with no guaranteed qualifiers. As it stands, Japan’s Kaori Sakamoto leads the pack with 24 points following her gold medal performance at the NHK Trophy, followed by You Young of Korea with silver last week and 22 points total, Japan’s Mai Mihara with 18 points, and American Alysa Liu with 16. With Russians Anna Shcherbakova (15 points), Kamila Valieva (15 points), Elizaveta Tuktamysheva (13 points), and Maiia Khromykh (13 points) set to compete — the latter three in the Rostelecom Cup and the former in the Internationaux de France — among other athletes, it is still anybody’s game.
China’s Sui Wenjing and Han Cong have dominated the pairs field, winning gold at both Skate Canada and the Gran Premio d’Italia for a total of 30 points and guaranteed qualification for the Grand Prix Final. Russians Evgenia Tarasova and Vladimir Morozov have also guaranteed their qualification, following closely behind with 28 points thanks to a gold at Skate America and a silver last week at the NHK Trophy. Japan’s Riku Miura and Ryuichi Kihara trail with 24 points, as do Americans Ashley Cain-Gribble and Timothy LeDuc with 20. Qualification for these two pairs is likely, but still not set in stone.
Four Russian pairs will be vying to knock the current qualifiers down the rankings for a spot in the Grand Prix Final. Anastasia Mishina and Aleksandr Galliamov (15 points), Daria Pavliuchenko and Denis Khodykin (13 points), Aleksandra Boikova and Dmitrii Kozlovskii (11 points), and Iuliia Artemeva and Mikhail Nazarychev (11 points) will all be looking to better their positions across the next two weeks’ competitions in order to skate in Osaka come December.While the chances of either of the latter two pairs making the Grand Prix Final is low, all four of these pairs continue to pose threats to Miura and Kihara, as well as Cain-Gribble and LeDuc.
Americans Madison Hubbell and Zachary Donahue are the only current guaranteed qualifiers in ice dance, with a gold at Skate America and a silver at the Gran Premio d’Italia, totaling 28 points for the pair. Trailing just behind are Americans Madison Chock and Evan Bates with 26 points, who  successfully supplemented their second-place performance at Skate America with another silver last week, as well as Spaniards Olivia Smart and Adrián Díaz, with 20 points, and Americans Caroline Green and Michael Parsons with 16.
While Chock and Bates will likely qualify for the Grand Prix Final, neither Smart and Díaz nor Green and Parsons can be confident in their position. French pair Gabriella Papadakis and Guillaume Cizeron (15 points), Canadians Piper Gilles and Paul Poirier (15 points), Russians Victoria Sinitsina and Nikita Katsalapov (15 points), and Italians Charlène Guignard and Marco Fabbri (13 points) are all presently scheduled to compete in another competition. It is relatively likely that one or more of these pairs will be able to overtake the current second- and third-placed qualifiers to earn a place in the Grand Prix Final.
With Japan’s Yuzuru Hanyu out of the ISU Grand Prix of Figure Skating after an ankle ligament injury forced him to withdraw from the 2021 NHK Trophy last week, it looks like we will probably be seeing a clash between Shoma Uno, Vincent Zhou, and Nathan Chen for this year’s Grand Prix Final men’s singles gold. In pairs, Sui Wenjing and Han Cong will be looking to keep up their momentum and stave off Evgenia Tarasova and Vladimir Morozov. Ice dance faces a similar situation, as Hubbell and Donahue head into the tournament with Chock and Bates hot on their heels. With women’s singles being the sole category where no athlete has guaranteed their Grand Prix Final qualification, it will be interesting to see how things shape up for these skaters in the next two weeks.

How sustainable is Carnegie Mellon really?
Carnegie Mellon followed in the footsteps of the U.N. General Assembly when it established its Sustainability Initiative in 2019 in alignment with the U.N.'s sustainable development goals. In both 2020 and 2021, the university evaluated itself on its progress in furthering these goals through their Voluntary University Review (VUR). VUR looked at the university's education, research, and overall practices, and evaluated how much of each could be associated with each of the sustainable development goals. Unsurprisingly, out of the 17 goals, the investments of the university seem to be furthering the goal of improving the quality of education the most.
Robotics Institute welcomes new director
Matthew Johnson-Roberson was once an undergraduate computer science student at Carnegie Mellon, and now, he will return in January as the new director of the Robotics Institute after having served as associate professor of engineering at the University of Michigan. Some of his interests include fostering relationships with companies, as well as enabling a space for new perspectives and diverse conversations.
Making brain probes more durable
Brain probes are both the stuff of fiction and nonfiction, recording the neural activity in the brain. However, they are also fragile and not practical for many situations, such as when researchers are trying to record signals from the 3D volume of the brain. Researchers in the Next Manufacturing Center are creating brain probes to solve these issues by measuring how much force and pressure the probes experience through different materials.
U.N. climate talks end in Glasgow Climate Pact
The United Nations held COP26, their 26th annual climate change conference, from Oct. 13 to Nov. 12 in Glasgow, Scotland. The conference ended in the Glasgow Climate Pact adopted by the nearly 200 countries in attendance. The countries agreed to focus on preventing global warming from going above 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 Fahrenheit). The pact also included its first mention of fossil fuels, which they initially resolved to "phase-out," though India later asked for the language to be changed to "phased down." 
A busy week for SpaceX: starships, Starlink, spacemen
It was a busy week for SpaceX. On Thursday, it launched the 600th person in space and three others, delivering them to the International Space Station after a one-week delay. They will remain in orbit until April 2022. On Friday, SpaceX test-fired their new Starship SN20, made to launch people to the Moon and Mars. Combined with the Super Heavy 4 booster, it has become the tallest rocket ever at 395 feet. On Saturday, the company launched 53 Starlink satellites into orbit, part of a mega-constellation of 1,844 satellites aiming to deliver high-speed internet to rural and remote areas.

I knew Bruno Mars. I knew Anderson .Paak. I was watching the Grammys last year and, all of a sudden, I was looking at both of them. I thought, “I’ve never seen something so right.” Peas and carrots, peanut butter and jelly, caramel and apples could not compare to the absolute beauty of these men together, dressed in perfectly tailored orange suits, their unique styles melding together with a flawless 70s aesthetic to form a wonderfully satisfying and equally unexpected creative team.
Bruno Mars is a household name. His music came at the perfect time for his unique funny, funky, and catering-to-the-people style, with his peak happening in the early 2010s. Though it’s taken him a while to grow into it, Bruno Mars has always had a smooth-guy persona, something that has broken through in his most recent and most successful music. In fact, Silk Sonic’s lyricism matches up so closely with his work on “24K Magic” that it almost seems like an extension of it.
Conversely, Anderson .Paak’s prior work was more fluid, and at times, much more serious, with pieces like “Lockdown” covering the reckoning of the Black Lives Matter movement in the midst of a global pandemic. .Paak’s music is all vibes — it’s heavy on beats and light on the soul. In terms of quantity, .Paak has one on Mars, with five studio albums to Mars’ three. However, like his music, .Paak’s breakthrough into common consciousness has been far more recent, maybe even beginning with Silk Sonic for some. Here continues my peanut butter and jelly metaphor: .Paak and Mars are the perfect combo not because they are the same, but because they complement each other so well. Mars is seasoned while .Paak is fresh, Mars is stylistically consistent while .Paak is artistically flexible. Most importantly, they both fit into Silk Sonic’s intense 70s visuals like they’ve stepped right out of a time machine.
Rumor has it the pairing was born of a joke between the two and blossomed into a quarantine project. Regardless of the origin, there’s an intense kind of dedication to the concept that shines through all of the music released and all of the performances. Though they had released a few singles — most notably “Leave the Door Open” — in the past months, Silk Sonic has been gearing up for a big album release: “An Evening with Silk Sonic,” a wonderfully suggestive and imagery-laden title. I had the distinct pleasure of being awake at midnight when the album was released on Nov. 12 last week (incredibly bold of them to release on the same night as Taylor Swift’s “Red (Taylor’s Version)”), so please enjoy what is perhaps the freshest review you will ever read, written about 10 minutes after the album hit the stands.
Conceptually, the album is exactly what it should be. It’s smooth, velvety, and even greasy. Opening with an introduction by “special guest host” Bootsy Collins — a wonderful nod to the record’s musical origins — a listener is invited into a nightclub from the past, records spinning, lights down low, champagne being poured into strangely angular crystal glasses. The influence of both .Paak and Mars can be heard clearly all over the record. From the far end of the bass-funky Anderson .Paak spectrum — “777” and “Fly As Me” — to “Leave the Door Open,” a catchy radio hit that could only have been written by Bruno Mars, this album pulls from their unique skill sets in all the right places. There are also some new sounds, with a plunky guitar on “Fly as Me” and “Blast Off” that serves as a brief reprieve from the silky synths that drown the rest of the tracks.
The sounds of “An Evening with Silk Sonic” might as well be sights for all their strength and cohesion. “777” literally takes off in a jet plane, while “Blast Off” winds down the night with an outro that sends you straight to the heavens. The lyricism on pieces like “Smokin Out the Window” and “After Last Night” is a testament to the lightness of the album as well as the emotional ideology behind the album’s essential aesthetics. We’re hearing about confident, smooth men who work hard, play hard, and feel every inch of it. Women on this album are goddesses and trophies and devils all in one — it’s raw and a little bit fiery.
Collaborations like this one come so infrequently; it’s so wonderful to see work that is so clearly born out of pure creative inspiration. We were promised “A Night With Silk Sonic” and it was delivered. .Paak and Mars offer themselves as pure entertainers and they get the job done. It’s stylistically consistent, aesthetically engaging, and lyrically whimsical. Tracks like “Smokin Out The Window” and “After Last Night” pull the audience into a brand new old world created and lived in so comfortably by Silk Sonic. In their own words, “Silk Sonic/this the big one/you gotta trust your gut/can you feel it?”

Clifford, Clifford, Clifford. What is there to say about this big red boy that hasn’t been said ample times in so many eloquent ways? This big goof was a part of all of our childhoods, an integral part if I may. When I learned that Hollywood was making a new Clifford movie, I was, of course, worried. With this glut of remakes, reboots, sequels, and second outings, what if they permanently ruined an essential part of my childhood? When I read “Clifford Gets a Job,” would the experience be tainted by a loathsome (and worst of all, unnecessary) retelling? Of course, there was no need to worry. “Clifford the Big Red Dog,” masterfully directed by Walt Becker (eagle-eyed readers will recognize him as the visionary behind “Alvin and the Chipmunks: The Road Chip”), is a tour-de-force, marrying new New York-tinged elements with that classic Clifford we all know and love.
As any self-respecting Clifford-head would do, I bought a ticket to an early special screening here in Pittsburgh. I brought all the Clifford memorabilia I had to the screening as a show of my ever-loving fandom. I would have brought more, but I had to leave most of my Clifford antiques in my old family home when I moved to college. Once I arrived at the showing, I noticed that I was definitely not the only fan there. There were two men dressed in full-body dog costumes, no doubt meant as simulacra of Clifford that nevertheless permitted them to express their own identities. I immediately became rather jealous and asked for the provenance of these furry suits. These very nice men showed me and then invited me to their upcoming party on the 17th. Of course, I accepted; I’d love to meet new fans of Clifford the Big Red Dog.
While the patrons of the AMC Waterfront 22 establishment were very pleasant, I cannot say the same about the waitstaff. I had, of course, brought my 34-ounce Clifford drink barrel (a 5:1 replica of the very one he uses in “Clifford Grows Up”) and my Clifford-branded popcorn baggy from “Clifford Goes to the Circus” with the expectation that I could use these items as containers in which the popcorn and Hi-C would be poured. The cashier informed me that that was not the case, which embarrassed me so much that I almost didn’t buy the large drink and popcorn.
I know that you Cliffordiacs aren’t just here to hear about my life and love for Clifford — you want the meat! Has Emily Elizabeth been wronged? Is Norman Bridwell rolling in his grave? Luckily, no on both counts. As I said before, this is a heartwarming story that will satisfy fans, both young and especially old. “Clifford the Big Red Dog” is billed as a movie for children, yet many of the jokes would go clear over a youngster’s head and are obviously meant for an audience that is more sophisticated. The themes of factory farming and NIMBYism are also more adult, so there is definitely room on this bone for everyone.
As a former New Yorker, I can say that the Big City elements of this film are very genuine. There are many, many bodega scenes, and, of course, the classic Eastern European milk woman that haunts New York apartment buildings. You can tell that there is a genuine love for that New York spirit. The film is rather Monty Python-esque, starring John Cleese in his best role since “A Fish Called Wanda.” Here, the dog is called Clifford (named in a frankly hilarious scene that calls back to “Clifford’s Best Friend: A Story about Emily Elizabeth”) and John Cleese is Mr. Bridwell, an obvious callback to Norman Ray Bridwell, who you all know.
Other highlights are Darby Camp as Emily Elizabeth and Mia Ronn as Florence, the school bully. Her portrayal of a mean bully is stunningly realistic and may dredge up bad memories among the viewers that may have been “less well-adjusted” at school.
There are many other delightful moments included within this film, but they are best left as surprises. When I came home and immediately rewatched the movie with my Paramount Plus subscription, I noticed many hidden details that only an eagle-eyed viewer could catch on their primary watch, when most would be focused on the compelling narrative, humor, and effects. Incredible movie, 8/10

Sex sells, and it might soon also protect and serve. While ostensibly a tool for accountability, one major criticism of body cams is that many officers conveniently turn them off when participating in, shall we say, “extrajudicial activities.” However, in a stroke of genius, OnlyFans has offered to partner with local law enforcement to incentivize the use of body cams. Now, police officers have a platform to share their content with the public in a new and provocative way.
Initially, this union of cop and kink was met with difficulty. Many officers, largely in law enforcement due to sexual frustration, found themselves unable to get into the swing of things. The first few months saw multiple videos of awkward attempts at sensual arrests, where many officers would ask suspects repeatedly if they “liked that” as they stuffed perps into squad cars. In one early stream, Officer Earl Grogan tried his shot at what he dubbed “penal edging,” where he followed a stolen car with his lights off for over 20 miles, all while breathing heavily into his mic. Another cop made an earnest attempt to break into more solo work by recording themselves slowly inserting parking tickets into windshields. However, after this period of experimentation came an explosion of carnal creativity.
Like Twitch or YouTube, OnlyFans is a site made up of personalities. The creators that stand out the most are those that have recognizable traits that viewers like and relate to. Take for instance Philadelphia officer Sgt. Dan “Bubble Butt” Braddock, who hit over 20,000 subscribers after famously using his rear end to incapacitate a purse thief. Likewise, Corporal Susan “Frisky Business” Montgomery saw an explosion in viewership after playing “Careless Whisper” during a particularly thorough stop and search. What’s more, many officers are tapping into their inborn sense of fraternity by forming duos or even trios on the site. NYPD fan favorites “Fellas in Yella” took the city by storm when they replaced their traditionally blue outfits with lemon-colored gimp suits. Or take “The Pig Boys,” a group of Austin detectives that replaced their squad car sirens with patented “squealers” and only investigate what they call “greasy pink crime.” When asked what that was, head Pig Boy Harry Yonic Jr. answered, “Whatever you want, baby.”
As police accountability has improved, so has the department’s relationship with the public. Many would-be criminals turn into fans after arrest and do not become repeat offenders. Former arsonist and now Edna “Fuzzy Cuffs” Wayne fan Alberto Q. stated, “Now the only fire I’m setting is in my loins!” Reformed serial car thief Ursula D. has now purchased a vehicle to match her idol Freddie “Hands Up, Pants Down” Brown’s (donut-themed exhaust testes included). Whole gangs have been replaced with fan clubs of popular OnlyFans officers, with the little-known Duluth chapter of the Crips transmuting into Pig Boy Merch Inc.
We still have a very long way to go before people everywhere fully trust their police. Abuse and misconduct run through every department, and it will take a concerted effort on every front to root it out. But in the sagacious words of biracial beat cop duo “Salt and Pepper,” “You go hard, then you go harder, baby.”

There is not really a crime thriller quite like “Memories of Murder,” directed by Bong Joon Ho. Many crime dramas exploring serial killers are more interested in how the philosophy of the killers and how the main characters react to the bleak reality they live in, often changed or traumatized by the events that take place in the story. “Memories of Murder” takes this one step further and explores how the actions of the characters reflect the incompetence of the police and how justice is futile.
The film is loosely based on the Hwaesong serial murders in South Korea, which took place between 1986 and 1991. The killer was only caught in 2019, and by that time, he was already in prison for the murder of his sister-in-law. That detail adds an extra layer to the movie’s bleak portrayal of justice, which culminates in the desperate police search for the serial killer resulting in a dead-end.
In the beginning, the hopelessness of the situation is captured in several darkly comedic bits. The main detective, Park Doo-man, is a hopelessly outmatched local detective who doesn’t know how to handle the string of serial murders. His crime scenes are routinely tainted by the media, random tractor drivers who don’t know it’s a crime scene, or morbidly curious children trying to get a look at the dead body. His instinct is to look at someone and tell just by looking at them if they’re a killer or not; this leads to him picking up suspects who are innocent and beating confessions out of them. His bias is especially clear against people with mental disabilities.
In contrast, Detective Seo Tae-yoon is an intelligent detective from Seoul with a university degree and American training. He comes to help the violent crimes division, exploring every lead possible, from the mental conditions of suspects to the strength and texture of their hands. In the first half of the movie, Seo is typically shown in the background of the ensemble cast, poring through documents while Park and the other characters brutally beat the suspects. At one point, he even says “documents don’t lie.” His methods also involve befriending people and gaining their trust and rapport to get evidence from them, including a young school girl privy to rumors about the serial killer.
The framing of shots in the film is key in its storytelling. In one brilliant long take, the two detectives argue and get into a physical fight but then are broken apart by the chief, who sat perfectly between them at the back of the table. The long shots, with an emphasis on foreground and background elements, are a staple of this film, simultaneously playing with the framing for dramatic tension as well as laughs.
Eventually, Park’s methods bring a lot of heat on the police, who are protested against for their use of excessive force and unjust imprisonment of suspects. Seo’s methods help to exonerate these innocent suspects. The clues he acquires end up paying off when they finally nab a definite suspect, Park Hyeon-gyu. Detective Park is forced to accept that his biased method of policing has done more harm than good, and learns to look at things more analytically. It’s such a great character change that also shifts the tone of the movie from satirical to a much darker tone.
Seo is convinced that his evidence is rock solid, but they can’t confirm Hyeon-gyu as the killer until a DNA test of semen samples returns from America. But tragedy strikes when another girl is murdered during the waiting period. Seo goes to the crime scene and finds that it’s the young girl he befriended during his investigation. Enraged that he was unable to save her, he goes to Hyeon-gyu and drags him to a set of train tracks to beat a confession out of him. Detective Park stops him when he arrives with the DNA test, which exonerated Hyeon-gyu. But Seo no longer needs the document, believing that it’s lying — his evidence was rock solid. Park takes a look at the killer, and for the first time, he admits that he can’t tell if Hyeon-gyu is even the killer or not and lets him go. Seo fires at Hyeon-gyu, and Park is forced to stop him. Even with their more analytical forms of detective work, there was still no justice, and they were unable to get the killer; this leaves them both defeated and hopeless. In trying to bring about more order, all the police did was bring about more disorder.
Years later, Park happens to pass by the same place where the first murder happened. He runs into a young girl who says she saw another man there reminiscing about something he did there a long time ago. Park asks what he looked like, and she responds by saying “kind of plain.” The film ends with Park looking into the camera, trying to spot the killer watching the film. Even knowing that the killer was caught 16 years after the film came out, it’s one of the most chilling closing shots put on screen. It reminds you that there are people out there who are plain and ordinary that are capable of horrific things but are never caught, while innocent people caught up in sloppy investigations are put in prison.

Q. I want to keep going to class, but it’s getting so cold; I prefer to stay in my warm bed. How do I get moving in the morning?
A. When you think about it, the reason why beds are warm is that humans are warm. We heat our beds, which trap the heat and keep us cozy. So what remains is to reduce how much heat you produce. Start by eating colder things, like frozen yogurt or print-out screenshots of when you leave someone on read. Start engaging in colder activities, like walking outside without a scarf or completely ignoring someone for weeks on end, even though you leave read receipts on and the other person knows for a fact you saw it. Make yourself impervious to chilly weather by skiing or snowboarding or making absolutely sure that someone knows you’re ignoring them completely, all while maintaining an active social media presence so that it’s clear they’re the person you want out of your life. Become an absolute bonafide icy juggernaut by taking cold showers and showering everyone except this very specific person with acknowledgment and goodwill.
Q. How do you meet deadlines when you’re a chronic procrastinator? 
A. You can think of it as sowing seeds for your future self. When you do things early, you’re making life easier for the same “you” down the line. Except … is it the same you? Science tells us you replace every cell in your body once every seven to ten years — seven years from now, you might be an entirely new being. Do you really want to be improving the life of a person that, from a biological standpoint, is essentially a clone? I dunno about you, but the only clone I want in my life is the one I use for blood transfusions when I become a decrepit millionaire.  
Q. I’ve been trying to see more of the city, but I don’t know where to go. What’s good in the ‘burgh?
A. Pittsburgh is unlike bigger cities like New York or L.A. in that it doesn’t spoon-feed you entertainment. In New York, you can throw a rat and hit about ten different concerts or shows. In L.A., replace the rat with a needle full of Botox. But in Pittsburgh, things are not so easy. You gotta work to find out what’s happening. You gotta go to the same bookstore for months to get invited to the owner’s bass guitar neo-disco-folk-punk concert he has on prime-numbered weekends.

The Department of Modern Languages has been showing movies in foreign languages for the past two weeks, and will for one more week. On Nov. 17, at Posner 343, they will be showing “The Perfect Candidate,” a Saudi Arabian movie about a young female Saudi doctor’s run for office in the local city elections that forces her family and community to accept their town’s first female candidate. It will be shown in Arabic with English subtitles.
The film I will be writing about here is “Huit Femmes” (“Eight Women”) by François Ozon, which was shown by the Department of Modern Languages on Nov. 10. It is a rare movie that manages to juggle polar opposite emotions perfectly. Laugh-out-loud hilarious moments will abound, and then be followed by a jaw-dropping dramatic moment, and then a musical scene! In this movie, eight women are stuck in a snow-covered cottage when the patriarch of the family is found dead. What ensues are revelations and revelations. I’d compare the movie to “Knives Out” and “Dial M For Murder”; however, these comparisons don’t do enough to portray how unique “Huit Femmes” really is. The aforementioned musical numbers somehow manage to feel fitting to their moments, whilst simultaneously being a complete surprise when they occur. Of course, the acting is also incredible, uniting some of the best French actresses of their respective generations. Danielle Darrieux plays Mamy, the supposedly infirm grandmother; Isabelle Huppert and Catherine Deneuve, legendary actresses already, deliver incredible performances as the two daughters; Emmanuelle Béart is the new, slightly scheming maid (and has the best musical number); Fanny Ardant acts as the victim’s estranged sister; Virginie Ledoyen portrays the victim’s daughter as well as the closest thing to a POV character of the film; Ludivine Sagnier is incredibly and authentically childish as the youngest daughter; and Firmine Richard as the slightly distant cook. All incredible portrayals in a resplendent picture.
The thematic values of the film are equally interesting. Importantly, there are — apart from a brief shot of the husband — absolutely no men in this movie. The air of suspicion prevalent throughout the film also gives an interesting layer to the queer undertones. “Huit Femmes” has been described as a jumble of references to classic movies and queer characters, yet despite all this, it is a truly interesting film that remains original even 20 years on from its release.

Federal vaccine mandates have sparked controversy throughout the country, including within Allegheny County as seen by complaints filed by the Allegheny County Police Association around a month ago. Generally, supporters of the mandates believe in their importance for ending COVID-19, while those in opposition argue against them on the basis of constitutionality. 
Just last Tuesday, opponents of the vaccine mandate rallied at the Pennsylvania Capitol to support a bill proposed by Pennsylvania State Senator Doug Mastriano (R), which would prevent employers and the state from requiring employees to get vaccinated. Mastriano, joined by Rep. Stephanie Borowicz (R-Center, Clinton), claimed the vaccine mandate was tyranny. 
“We got people who lose their jobs because of overreach and tyranny. It’s as simple as that,” Mastriano said in his closing remarks. 
Chief Quality Officer at UPMC Tami Minnier spoke about the importance of getting vaccinated at a press conference on Nov. 5: 
“Today, if you are unvaccinated, you have a 10 times higher risk of dying [sic] for COVID. I, for one, along with the people I care about, and the people that we work with, don’t want to see that happen. And we don’t believe that that is a risk worth taking because the vaccines are so very safe and effective.”
On the federal level, Biden’s federal vaccine mandate was frozen in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit, which is based in New Orleans. The mandate required large companies to have their employees vaccinated by early January or test unvaccinated employees weekly. In the circuit court, a panel of three judges, appointed by former President Trump and former President Reagan, held that the mandate is not within the scope of the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), the federal administration that issued it. However, the Department of Justice has issued a statement arguing against this decision, and the matter will likely be settled at a later date in the Supreme Court. 
Otherwise, in the courts, nearly every lawsuit filed arguing for the unconstitutionality of the vaccine mandate has been struck down. 
Large Pennsylvania healthcare providers like UPMC and Allegheny Health Network have agreed to abide by federal vaccine mandates, and chief medical officials issued statements regarding how the decision serves to protect patients and healthcare workers. As COVID-19 numbers remain high in Allegheny County, Allegheny County Health Department Director Dr. Debra Bogen urges people to get vaccinated. The Pfizer vaccine is now authorized for five to 11 year olds, and UPMC advises parents to take their children to get vaccinated.

On Nov. 8, Carnegie Mellon COVID-19 Coordinator and Vice President for Operations Daryl Weinert sent an email inspiring confidence and encouraging continued cautiousness within the university’s community. In a new step toward normalcy, Weinert wrote, “We are slightly adjusting the minimum requirements for facial coverings.” The relaxations were introduced in response to students, faculty, and staff reaching an overall vaccination rate of 98 percent.
Vaccinated students are no longer required to wear facial coverings in some residence hall spaces and community members can remain unmasked outside regardless of their proximity to others. Aside from eating, drinking, and being alone in an indoor space, masks continue to be required at all other times. 
Carnegie Mellon’s pandemic response, led by Weinert, is a combined effort between Allegheny Health Network’s COVID-19 Physician Consultant Program and the university’s Emergency Preparedness and Response Team. The group, composed of 13 faculty members, has been meeting since 2020. 
In the past two weeks, Allegheny County has seen a 16 percent increase in new cases. Hospitalizations have decreased by 13 percent over the same period. The recent spike in cases was discussed in a Nov. 10 briefing held by the Allegheny County Health Department (ACHD), where Department Director Dr. Debra Bogen noted that October was the county’s “third-deadliest month since the start of the pandemic.” 
“Pittsburgh City Paper” reported that “The county sees no indication that the numbers of cases will be dropping any time soon,” especially as temperatures drop, activities move inside, and the holidays (and with them, large gatherings) approach. 
Though the county does not require employers to enforce vaccine mandates, many companies have instituted them. Allegheny County Executive Rich Fitzgerald encouraged “other companies and organizations to do the same. We’re in a war … with a virus that has taken many lives.” The county has reported 2,383 deaths since the beginning of the pandemic. 
Pittsburgh Mayor Bill Peduto issued an executive order earlier this month requiring all city employees to be vaccinated by Dec. 22. 13 other large cities, including San Francisco, Los Angeles, and Chicago, instituted the same policy.
Following President Biden’s vaccine mandate for healthcare workers, chief marketing officers of a dozen regional healthcare systems signed off on inoculation requirements. Among these medical providers were AHN — where 84 percent of current employees are fully vaccinated — and UPMC. 
The ACHD estimates that 74 percent of residents eligible for the vaccine have received at least one dose. Within the 15213 zip code — which includes Carnegie Mellon — the ACHD reported that 54 percent of people are fully vaccinated, an eight percent increase from September to October. 
ACHD data shows that, across racial and ethnic demographics, women are more likely to be vaccinated than men. The report did not include data on nonbinary people. “Hispanic females are the highest vaccinated ethnicity and gender group” at 68 percent, according to the ACHD, “while Not Hispanic males tend to be the lowest vaccinated group” at 48 percent.
Vaccination efforts have been revived with the recent approval of booster shots. The CDC recommends that all adults who were immunized with Janssen/Johnson & Johnson receive the booster. It made the same recommendation for recipients of the Moderna and Pfizer vaccines who are above 65 and/or an adult at higher risk for exposure or severe COVID-19 symptoms.

Late in the night on Thursday, Nov. 11, the Carnegie Mellon Police Department sent out a campus-wide email revealing that earlier that evening, they had received a bomb threat at Warner Hall, the Purnell Center for the Arts, and the Gates-Hillman Building. They explained that the locations were evacuated, and the Pittsburgh Police Department sent in canine units to thoroughly sweep each building. All buildings were cleared of any threats following the sweeps, and, according to the email, law enforcement officials believed the threat was not credible and the situation was contained. This is one of the latest in a wave of bomb threats being issued to institutions of higher education since last week.
Shilpa Bakre, the interim managing director of communications at the university, provided more detailed information about the incident in response to an email inquiry from The Tartan. “At 6:33 p.m. on Thursday evening (11/11/21), the CMU Police Department received a phone call of bomb threats at Warner Hall, the Purnell Center for the Arts, and the Gates-Hillman Building,” she wrote in the email. Following a thorough assessment, in coordination with the City of Pittsburgh Police Department and other law enforcement agencies, she said, the threat was found not to be credible. Despite no evidence of an active threat, campus police evacuated the buildings out of an abundance of caution, which enabled Pittsburgh Police K-9 units to conduct thorough sweeps that revealed all buildings were clear. 
Ava Egerton, a senior acting major, was in the Purnell Center for the Arts that night because one of the main stage shows she’s in — “The Kennedy Plays” — was in tech, the process of entering the theatre space after the rehearsal process. At around 8:40 p.m., her stage manager announced that they were going to hold for the night and have an emergency evacuation. “So we all exited the building. And we were intending to go back in to finish the tech process for the night,” she said. Egerton said that she had been told by the director of the play that the evacuations were due to a bomb threat but that it was not credible.
Katia Peppas, a senior architecture major with a drama minor, was also in Purnell that night working backstage in the tech rehearsal for “The Kennedy Plays.” After evacuating, she said that she and at least 50 other people who left rehearsal stood outside between the UC and Purnell and were confused about what to do in this situation.
Egerton echoed the sentiment. “We heard that it was going to take an hour minimum for any clearance,” she said. Not wanting to take a risk, they decided to call it a night. She also said she was fairly calm throughout the process. “There were a lot of us together …. It was nice to hear that [the bomb threat] was from a non-credible source,” she explained. “There also wasn't any, like loitering or wasting time. I felt like people were very efficient when it came to making decisions. So as scary as it is, I think people really took the threat seriously. So I definitely felt very safe throughout the entire time that we were trying to figure out what the best move would be.”
“I understand now that non-credible bomb threats are unfortunately common at universities, but at the moment we were evacuated Thursday night, I didn't know that, and was genuinely scared,” said Peppas. She was shocked that an email wasn’t sent out immediately by the university upon the threat being called in. “While we were asked to evacuate, there was no central communication to tell people which buildings were safe to go into or even if we needed to leave campus as a whole. Instead, we were sent home and asked to come back the next day as if nothing had happened.” Many of the people she was working with had left their laptops, car keys, and other essentials in the building so they waited nearby for a few hours and returned later that night to collect their belongings. She found out the next morning that she could go back into the building when she saw the email that Carnegie Mellon Police sent out on Thursday night. 
“Given the public nature of the building examinations, a campus-wide email was sent when the situation was contained so the community would be aware of what transpired,” Bakre explained. “The safety and welfare of the CMU community is a top priority.”
A source from the Graduate Student Assembly, who was not present at the buildings during the evacuations, also voiced their concerns about the way the communication of the incident was handled by the university even though the threat turned out to be non-credible. They explained that many graduate students work in their offices late into the night, and others might be heading back to work after grabbing dinner. “Why was a CMU-Safety Alert not pushed to the students when the university decided to investigate the threat?” they questioned. The email, with the subject line that read “All Clear: Bomb Threat,” sent at around 11 p.m., was the first that most students had heard of the threat. 
The Tartan asked the Enterprise Risk Management Department why alerts were not sent out to students and staff before or during the evacuations. The department replied with a statement from Vice President for Operations and Interim Vice President for Research Daryl Weinert, which said that following the assessment conducted by law enforcement agencies which found the threat to be non-credible, the decision was made to not deliver a CMU-Alert community-wide message. 
“Other universities have received similar threats too,” pointed out the source from GSA. “But they’ve been very open about communication to students to avoid these areas as they investigate, not just sending one email after they’ve evacuated everyone and done a full canine sweep to rule it out.”
Bomb threats were also issued to the University of Southern California, New York University, and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, among others, on Thursday. The Tartan obtained screenshots of alerts sent by NYU’s Emergency Notifications system on Thursday evening to its community members. The first, sent at around 7:30 p.m., alerted that a bomb threat directed to three buildings had been received, announced an evacuation, and provided a link for more information. Subsequent alerts provided instructions for the evacuation process, and the final one informed everyone that the buildings had been cleared of threats by the police. In contrast, Carnegie Mellon sent one community-wide email after the evacuation was completed.
Bakre wrote that the Carnegie Mellon University Police Department continues to work with the Pittsburgh Police Department and the FBI to investigate further, and that “To maintain the integrity of investigations, we generally refrain from commenting on specifics.” Recent news reports indicate that a teenager from Virginia might be involved in the issuance of bomb threats to universities, though it is not immediately clear which specific threats the 14-year-old was involved in.

Move over, Mariah Carey; there’s a new skinny legend hitting the charts. Fall semester at Carnegie Mellon has won the “biggest loser” award, slimming down from a stacked 15 weeks to a slim, svelte, and sassy 14. Shorter semester means less school, right? Wrong, idiot! The brilliant powers that be still managed to condense the same amount of assignments, curriculum, and units, just shoved inelegantly into a brutal series of 14 short weeks which simultaneously lasted 100,000 years while ending before I had the chance to have any fun.
“Yaasss yasss yasss slay slay slay wig wig wig per per per,” first-year Matthew Diston said when asked for his thoughts on the adjustment. “I truly feel like assignments have had to be rushed due to this short semester, which leads to a stifled education. That being said, she’s so skinny I cannot see her — no really, has anyone seen her? I’m starting to get concerned,” he continued.
This is a sentiment echoed across our stressed campus. Not only is this semester skinny as hell, she’s also a huge pain. In addition to having a shorter semester, we have had what researchers have described as “absolutely not a single break.”
“I’m going so crazy that I’ve willingly eaten the food I’m allergic to and had to use my EpiPen three times in the last month. Last night I popped two bennys and slept for hours as a coping mechanism to deal with my dense workload,” first-year Yin Raquino said. “I blame the short semester. Because everything was so rushed, I felt like I had no time to prioritize myself.” 
Carnegie Mellon faculty is also feeling the squeeze. “The biggest challenge has been fitting in 15 weeks' worth of content into 14,” Carnegie Mellon acting professor and local celebrity Kyle Haden said. However, he also sees the pedagogical benefits of this challenge. “Coming out of the pandemic, there’s been a really great opportunity to reframe — educationally and pedagogically — what we’re doing. Making content for a course that had been 15 weeks fit into 14 weeks, with some of the innovations we’ve learned by being virtual, has been an interesting challenge to put together. It’s the best time to try and make these innovations.”
Hmmm. Is that really the biggest benefit of the shortened semester? While pulling out his captain’s hat, Ray-Bans, and donning a Hawaiian shirt, Haden added nonchalantly, “Plus, it gives me extra time to go to Cabo and spend time on my boat in the Florida Keys.” So that’s where the endowment’s going ….
I never thought I would be asking for more school, but I wouldn’t mind it stretching just a little longer if it meant I got a proper break. “I’m at the end of my rope,” said drama undergraduate Cole Schubert. Aren’t we all, my friend, aren’t we all.

Recently, the Pittsburgh City Council announced a new piece of legislation that eliminates traffic stops for minor infractions and other secondary violations such as broken tail lights. According to Councilman Ricky Burgess, who sponsored the legislation, the goal of the bill is to reduce racial discrimination and make traffic stops more “equitable and fair.” Pittsburgh Police data show that officers conducted 4,650 stops involving Black motorists, more than white and Hispanic or Latino motorists combined. 
The legislation is a step in the right direction for rectifying the racial disparities in Pittsburgh. One report in Pittsburgh found that Black people were three times more likely to be pulled over, 10 times more likely to be frisked, and six times more likely to be arrested after a traffic stop, though former Mayor Bill Peduto’s commission did not opt to call it racial discrimination outright. The bill is a sensible and actionable policy that greatly reduces harm for Black motorists. Furthermore, no one should be pulled over for a minor infraction. 
But traffic stops are not the only thing that needs to be changed. Pittsburgh is a systemically racist city, one that is significantly less livable for the Black population. The city’s Black population is declining; thousands left between 2014 and 2018, with one organizer citing high rents and low wages as the reasons. This coincides with the more recent gentrification of neighborhoods such as East Liberty and Lawrenceville in the last decade. The city’s Gender Equity Commission found that Black women are the worst off demographic in Pittsburgh according to most indicators of livability, with Black men not faring much better.
On a purely economic basis, the statistics get even more dire. The unemployment rate of working-age Black men is 12.2 percent, compared to 5.1 percent for working-age white men. They are also more likely to have yearly earnings below poverty level, which only sustains the racially disproportionate access to jobs and internships. As with many urban centers, Pittsburgh has been segregated through its city planning. The city planning reinforced the wealth gap by denying communities of color the opportunity to build home equity. The integration of redlining policy continue to manifest in the inequalities faced by Black residents. All this leaves the Black population of Pittsburgh not only worse off than their white neighbors, but also worse off than the Black population of peer cities. 
In a way, this proposed legislation demonstrates both hope for change in Pittsburgh and illustrates the bleak situation its Black community faces. At this point, as sad as it is, even the smallest legal reforms feel like a victory in the context of the systemic economic oppression that persists in the city. With the recent election of Ed Gainey — the city’s first Black mayor — combined with legislation like this, hopefully the city keeps the momentum of change going in the right direction.

Before beginning this article, one thing must be made clear: Marvel movies are dumb shlock. Martin Scorsese called them theme parks and I couldn’t agree with him more. They’re average to, at most, decent movies that are great to go to with your friends. In my opinion, what they do and say doesn’t really have much consequence because they are shlock. 
With that being said, their contribution to how politics are depicted in movies can’t be overstated. Almost every Marvel property that explores themes and ideas beyond its general premise has something to say about the world, and many of them relate to the government and military. “Iron Man” is about war-profiteering; “Captain America: The First Avenger” deals with World War II; “The Avengers” goes into depth about S.H.I.E.L.D., an agency that is given carte blanche to deal with threats that are beyond the capabilities of normal governments; “Captain America: The Winter Soldier” is about government surveillance; and “Captain America: Civil War” is about international governing bodies and regulation. 
But in most of these cases, the extra commentary feels fairly hollow. “Captain America: The Winter Soldier” is my personal favorite of the Marvel movies, and yet it is far from immune to the problem of politics in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU). The movie has funding from the military, which is ironic considering the whole movie is about a government agency being infiltrated by Nazis who engineer panic and take advantage of a surveillance state to commit genocide. It’s even more ironic considering that the military didn’t fund “The Avengers” because S.H.I.E.L.D was too extralegal for their tastes. 
The military funding means big studio movies can use real military vehicles and costumes in exchange for a flattering depiction of the military in the movie, and this funding affects the commentary on a number of levels. The movie can’t directly criticize the role of the American government in creating a surveillance state as much as it could. More importantly, it scapegoats a group of different bad people as the people creating and taking advantage of the surveillance state rather than the American government doing it. 
“The Winter Soldier” is still one of the better ones despite all this. In “Iron Man,” Tony Stark has a change of heart and wants to stop weapons manufacturing after his weapons fall into the wrong hands. Of course, the “wrong hands” are the terrorist organizations depicted in the movie. There’s nothing said about how war-profiteers benefit from the American government, even though the central premise of the movie relies upon the notion that war-profiteering is bad. 
The other problem with the commentary of “Iron Man” is that Tony Stark unilaterally wants to deal with world peace, effectively wanting to privatize it. It’s this idea that one hero gets a pass to make all the extralegal decisions. There is a similar problem with Captain America and Black Widow. When the government or HYDRA implements surveillance, it’s bad, but when Captain America and Black Widow do it, it’s heroic. 
But the most aggravating issue with politics in the MCU is related to how some of their antagonists are handled. In “Falcon and the Winter Soldier,” the main group of antagonists are a revolutionary group called The Flag Smashers. Their goal is to stop an international governing body and military from resettling millions of people after the Avengers brought back everyone who perished in the Snap. Throughout the show, they were portrayed as compassionate people who really cared for those who were marginalized. Of course, the show forgets that they’re supposed to be villains and will randomly have the main antagonists do things like bomb buildings with innocent people to remind the audience they are bad. This leads to this problem where the actions of the characters are inconsistent with their motivations while simultaneously delegitimizing the political commentary.
“Black Panther” has a similar problem with Killmonger — to be fair, Killmonger is genuinely a cold-blooded killer. Still, he has a major anti-colonialist goal, stealing Wakandan technology and weapons and distributing it to Black people around the world as a means to get them to rise up and fight. But, just when the movie is making his entire cause too sympathetic, he just randomly kills people to remind the audience that he is an evil guy. It is a lame storytelling crutch, and it’s a way to delegitimize revolutionary ideas that should be discussed with more nuance rather than being made into a villainous endeavor. 
The MCU has some interesting ideas and themes that it tries to explore, but it rarely follows through with them. There’s an easy answer as to why: Following through with those ideas and themes would be controversial. It would mean the movies take an actual stance on a political topic rather than just using it as window dressing for a story about people in suits beating each other up. But that begs the question: Do the movies have to take a stance? As I said in the first paragraph, these movies are schlock. But it is important to see how the schlock comments on the society in which it is championed.

The right-wing of America is winning “the culture war,” which is a vague and silly phrase describing the ever-growing division in American society over policy and ideology. Even with all the social upheaval of 2020 and the election last year, the 2021 off-year, off-cycle election was a significant win for Republicans and the Right. They’ve threaded the needle very well, targeting many white people in particular who are susceptible to right-wing propaganda. This encouraged many white people to go out and vote with the mission of saving their country from the tyranny of critical race theory and mask and vaccine mandates. Combine that with the incompetence of Democrats and the Left, and the Right is poised to make even more significant gains in the 2022 midterm elections. 
Any position remotely left-leaning is automatically put on the defensive. Whereas the Right can simply say no to most legislation, the Left has to defend their positions from attack, often being decried as “socialists” or “communists” if they dare suggest any redistributive policies. It’s so effective because the Left is rarely on the offensive, thus they are perceived as weak. The branding of the Left is also remarkably awful. For example, anyone with a remote understanding of the political landscape would know a phrase like “defund the police” would never thrive in a country that actively glorifies law enforcement. 
So what should the Left do? Well, if anything is clear from last year, it’s that Americans are a contradiction. They say they want change yet protect the status quo. The Left is ineffective at devising strategies to work within this framework. It tries to soar above it, hoping that things can be changed with enough outside pressure. But outside pressure is worthless when the media, government, corporations, conservatives, and moderates all actively work to counteract it. 
This is not to say the only way forward is gradual progress. The Left specifically needs to reclaim many of the right-wing’s talking points and reframe them. Let’s take the concept of security and order. At the heart of it, the average person does want security and order, simply because it is nice to live in peace and safety. This also translates into the workforce, with most craving job security. The Left can own this by promising no tax increases as their primary platform like Republicans do while prioritizing popular social programs. They can retake the mantle of security by lumping healthcare into the mix, promising millions of Americans security in their health outcomes. They need to promise a stable, working economy where Americans won’t lose their jobs, have to keep searching for one all the time, or have to work multiple jobs to sustain themselves. If the Right cries out “your policy is socialism,” the answer shouldn’t be “it’s not socialism.” The answer should be “so what? This is a matter of security.”
The same can be said for symbols like the American flag. The Left wants to reject such symbols, and the reasoning for doing so is more than warranted. Inherently, symbols are pointless because that’s what they are meant to be by design. The flag is also associated with slavery and imperialism, but many Americans still believe in the flag which the Right has taken to their advantage. What the Left should be doing is looking at the flag as an opportunity to reframe a symbol that is associated with a lot of ugly history. Rather than rejecting a symbol that many people still cling onto, the Left needs to swallow the tough pill that they need the flag. It has to represent something better, something more palatable for people to latch onto. The flag should be associated with a country that believes in economic fairness and justice rather than brutality and oppression. A more hopeful message that is rooted in “being American" is a sham, but it’s a sham people will buy into. 
This reframing is critical for localized races. Democrats lost in Virginia not only because of horrible campaign strategy, but also because of the narrative they pushed. Simply being anti-Trump is not an option anymore. People don’t care about that. People also don’t care about performative woke-ness either. They need action. They need real policies. You have to win people’s trust for that, especially the people who are against you. Outside of very blue bubbles, the Left doesn’t have that much support. If the Left wants to win, they have to adapt or the Right will continue winning the culture war. Frankly, the idea of living in a world where they completely win terrifies me.
