The Tartans will next compete on Friday, Sept. 29 at the Paul Short Invitational hosted by Lehigh University in Bethlehem, PA.
Football
The Carnegie Mellon football team opened Presidents’ Athletic Conference (PAC) play at Waynesburg University on Saturday, Sept. 16. The Tartans scored 24 unanswered points to come away with a 30–20 win. The Tartans improved to 3–0, (1–0 in the PAC).
Senior linebacker Sean Graff’s interception set up the Tartans on the Waynesburg 30-yard line and led to the first score of the game. Three plays later, junior quarterback Alex Cline connected with senior Tommy Mansfield on a 21-yard touchdown. The extra point sailed wide left and left the score 6–0 three minutes into the game.
Waynesburg answered the Cardinal and Gray’s score with a 19-play, 62-yard drive that took 9:44 off the clock. The end result was a 33-yard field goal that left the score 6–3 with just over two minutes to play in the first quarter. The Yellow Jackets then scored a touchdown to take a 10–6 lead with five minutes to play in the half on a quarterback keeper following a pass interference call in the end zone.
The Yellow Jackets opened the second half with a 14-play, 63-yard drive that resulted in the second field goal of the game. The 36-yard kick pushed the home team’s lead to 13–7 at the 9:30 mark of the third quarter.
In the closing seconds of the third quarter, Cline tossed his second touchdown of the game to knot the score at 13–13. This time, the junior found senior wide receiver John Prather on a 38-yard scoring connection.
After the Tartan defense held the Yellow Jackets to a three-and-out, Cline was fast to strike again. The signal caller needed three plays to give the Tartans a 20–13 lead. Cline founded junior Karl-Mark Kumm for a 28-yard touchdown that capped off a 55-yard drive.
Carnegie Mellon’s defense came up strong again and held the Yellow Jackets to another three-and-out. The Tartans again took advantage of the play of their defense with another scoring drive. The lead was extended to 23–13 with 8:05 to play on a 33-yard field goal by senior punter Tyler Kohman.
On the third straight possession for Waynesburg, Carnegie Mellon’s defense held the Yellow Jackets to another three-and-out and the Tartans capitalized for the third consecutive time. Junior running back Rory Hubbard pushed the lead to 30–13 on a 2-yard run with 5:34 to play. On the three-play scoring drive for the Tartans, Hubbard accounted for all 45 yards including a 40-yard scamper on his second carry.
Waynesburg added a late 20-yard touchdown to make the score 30–20 with 1:15 to play.
Carnegie Mellon combined 312 yards of offense while Waynesburg totaled 270 yards. It marked the third straight game that the Tartans’ defense held their opponent under 300 yards of total offense. Senior safety Drew Fitzmorris led the Tartans with eight tackles.
Cline threw for 187 yards and three touchdowns after completing 12-of-20 passes. Mansfield, Prather and senior running back Sam Benger each hauled in three receptions with Mansfield leading the way with 49 yards and a score. Prather compiled 47 yards and a score with Benger totaling 38 yards receiving. Hubbard led the Tartans rushing attack with a career-high 94 yards on 11 carries.
The Tartans will return to the gridiron on Saturday, Sept. 23 when Thomas More College travels to Pittsburgh. Kick is set for 1 p.m. on the turf of Gesling Stadium.
Women’s Tennis
The Carnegie Mellon women’s tennis team hosted Division II Seton Hill University on Saturday, Sept. 16, defeating the Griffins, 9–0. With the win, the Tartans move to 2–0 for the year.
The Tartans swept through doubles action against the Griffins, with the number one pair of senior Cori Sidell and sophomore Courtney Ollis winning 8–4 for the first point. Junior Marina Selenica and sophomore Vinaya Rao then won 8–2 at number three doubles before senior Katie Lai and junior Jamie Vizelman won by an 8–4 score at number two doubles.
Ollis and Selenica were the first to finish singles as both won by 6–0, 6–1 scores to give the match victory to the Tartans.
Sidell won her number one singles match, 6–0, 6–2, and is now one win away from her 100th career win.
The Tartans are also in action at the Kenyon College Invitational this weekend.
Volleyball
The 16th-ranked Carnegie Mellon volleyball team finished the Susquehanna University Hampton Inn River Hawk Classic with a 3–0 victory against the hosts and a 3–0 win against Stevenson University. The Tartans move to 11–0 on the season.
The Tartans opened the day with a 25–16, 25–13, 25–22 win against the River Hawks. The team hit .287 for the match including a .452 performance in the second set in which they put down 16 kills.

With the first week of the season complete, a few things have become obvious within The Tartan’s Fantasy Football League. The first is that if the amount of trash talk this week is any indication, then the shade thrown from league participants this year might surpass the shade thrown by last year’s league. The second is that there is a very good chance I will end this year at the very bottom of the league. The second realization doesn’t have me as surprised as it has me resigned. Regardless, I look forward to bringing sass and a low-level of football knowledge (i.e., no knowledge) to our healthy staff competition. If you are expecting substantive football analysis and predictions then read no further, as you will probably be quite disappointed.
Team Andah over Justin Tucker Must (not) Die 106.3-84.8
Despite my awe-inspiringly clever team name, my fabulous lineup ate dirt this week, especially compared to the high scorers on SciTech Editor and American Football newbie Josh Andah’s team. Andah might know even less than me about football, but clearly his natural talent has surpassed anything heretofore seen by The Tartan staff. With a particularly strong showing from Pittsburgh’s own Antonio Brown with 29.2 points, Andah was able to make up for the fact that he hadn’t removed Tampa Bay Buccaneers wide receiver Mike Evans from his active roster. Mike Evans looks scowly and talented in his picture on the ESPN fantasy site, but it’s hard to be an asset to the roster during a bye week. This small, (though understandable!) snafu on Andah’s part makes my loss even more embarrassing. After disappointing performances from individuals I expected would make me proud like my Boston boy Tom Brady and Pittsburgh running back Le’Veon Bell, I was huffing and puffing around and resigned myself to an embarrassing first week. Shamefully, my most successful performance of the week came from Pierre Garcon, wide receiver for San Francisco, though he only received 14.1 points. Humiliating.
Drop it like it’s Crock over Third-String Team 123.7-99.9
Tartan Publisher Jade Crockem claimed victory over Assistant Sports Editor Marika Yang this week, much to her own glee. Fantasy Football is very familiar territory to Yang, and perhaps some of the allegiances she’s made with players over time will be to the detriment of her own team this week. Her highest scorers were Atlanta Falcons quarterback Matt Ryan and Oakland Raiders wide receiver Amari Cooper, who both were in the 17 point range. This week was not a humiliating venture on Yang’s part, but she did get her butt whooped pretty substantially by Crockem, who happily reported to me that she had already beat Yang, even before her final team member played on Monday night. Though her offensive weapons put up a fight, the scorers that clinched the win for Crockem actually came from her defensive line (the Carolina Panthers scoring 14 to the Seattle Seahawks’ six) and her kicker (Cowboys’ Dan Bailey scoring 15, Colts’ Adam Vinatieri scoring two). With these performances coming from roster positions that many don’t prioritize, it’s clear that Crockem has game and will be a force to be reckoned with this season. Maybe she can even beat Editor-in-Chief and defending champ India Price, though with what that would do to staff cohesion and their living situation as roommates... it might not be worth the risk.
Yes We Cam over Easy Breesy 98.6-92.8
This was the closest showing this week. Sports Editor Ian Tanaya narrowly lost to aforementioned defending champ Editor-in-Chief India Price. There’s not one area in which Price clearly excelled and Tanaya did not. Moving forward it’s unclear who will have the strategy and persistence necessary to really pull forward, but Tanaya’s sports know-how and competitive attitude might prove to be the combination necessary to create the most formidable opponent in the league.
Plus, if last week’s article is any indication, he can clearly trash talk with the best of them. Buffalo Bills running back LeSean McCoy will be someone for opponents of Tanaya’s team to keep an eye on, though McCoy’s sore groin this week has put him in a more iffy spot. On Price’s team, Ezekiel Elliott, running back for Dallas Cowboys, will continue to be a threat after scoring 19 points this week. If New York Giants wide receiver Odell Beckham, Jr. had scored anything at all instead of zero points, Price would have had substantially more points than Tanaya, so with Price sure to evaluate and move him as needed, it’s possible that she is going to have yet another reliably high-scoring team.
This week my kind-of-sad team is playing Yang, Andah is playing Tanaya, and dynamic duo Crockem and Price are paired together. Hopefully next week’s analysis will elucidate some of the other strengths and weaknesses present on my opponents’ rosters, and I can try to get some semblance of a strategy. My current tactics include examining those with cool names, and judging who I think would be fun to hang out with based on their picture. My goal this season is to grow from using those two characteristics as reference points, and to try to learn more about football strategy. So far, the outlook for this doesn’t look promising.

The men’s soccer team faced the Westminster College Titans at home on Friday evening. The Tartans scored early, and finished the match 4–0, winning their fourth game in a row with a season record of 4–1.
The Tartans set the tone early in the match, driving into Titans territory within the first minute. In the fourth minute, sophomore midfielder Jack Painter opened scoring with his first goal of the season, finishing an assist from sophomore midfielder Elliot Cohen. The Tartans’ dominant play continued, and in the ninth minute they added to their lead with a goal from junior midfielder Zack Masciopinto’s third of the season, off a second assist from Cohen, bringing the score to 2–0. The Titans managed two shots on goal that were saved by junior goalkeeper Alec Lam, but even four substitutions in the middle of the half couldn’t give the Titans a spark to stay in the match. The Cardinal and Gray kept the ball away from their side of the field and kept possession, getting three shots on goal. The Tartans eventually scored again in the 36th minute after a goal by junior forward Anthony Gulli, his first of the season, the assist by sophomore forward Nicolas Poveda. The half ended with the score 3–0.
The Tartans maintained their aggressive attack after half-time. However, unlike the first half of the match, the second half remained scoreless for the first 35 minutes. Both Carnegie Mellon and Westminster had shots on goal, but neither team managed to get the ball in the back of the net until the 80th minute. The Tartans sealed their win when sophomore forward Alex Dziadosz sent the ball ahead for Poveda to score his first goal of the season, ending the match with the score 4–0.
Lam made four saves in the team’s fourth straight shutout after being named the University Athletic Association (UAA) Men’s Soccer Defensive Athlete of the Week last week. The Tartans had 14 shots to the Titan’s seven and seven corner kicks to the Titans’ two.
The Tartans will continue their season in their next match against the Allegheny College Gators in Meadville, PA at 7:30 p.m. on Monday, Sept. 18.

Life is just like a game of soccer — or at least according to junior goalkeeper Alec Lam it is. Soccer has been a crucial part of Lam’s life from preschool to college. The opportunities he’s found through the sport have allowed him to experience personal growth and help others.
Lam, who was recruited by the Carnegie Mellon Soccer team in 2015, began playing at only three years old. Originally Lam played with the Pee Wee children’s team to meet new people; however, after steady improvement he joined the TSF Academy team. Before entering high school, Lam became part of the Olympic Development Program and by the end of it he had won a state championship with his high school team.
“In the start it was just a way for me to get out and be around people, but what kept me in soccer was the team atmosphere and being able to be part of something larger than yourself, even though it’s just a sport. It’s a really nice feeling to come together as a whole and achieve something,” said Lam.
The first two years of Lam’s college soccer career were great, but this fall marked a new chance for Lam and his fellow players to further indulge in their sport. After competing in the national tournament the past two years, Lam says the team is eager to place first in the national championship.
“After each year we’ve felt like something was missing and each one of us believes that we don’t have to be at a traditionally good soccer power-house school to win a championship. We all came here to win and our goal is to turn into that winning team,” said Lam.
Previously, Carnegie Mellon and the Intramural League for Carnegie Mellon have recognized Lam as an outstanding athlete, with Carnegie Mellon naming him the Carnegie Mellon Student Athlete of the Week for the week of Sept. 4–10 and the League naming him as the League Athlete of the Week three times.
“What really drew me to [Carnegie Mellon University] was the academics, of course, but to… really be a part of something larger than myself on campus and work towards a common goal with a bunch of other talented and smart guys.”
Since coming to Carnegie Mellon, Lam branched out from just playing soccer to donating time with teams around the school. One of the Lam’s primary volunteer activities is the Special Olympics, an event which allows those with intellectual disabilities to compete in various athletic competitions.
“The event was originally hosted by CMU Athletics, but now it’s really starting to span out and as it’s getting bigger we’re taking on different organizations. Anyone who wants to get involved can get involved,” said Lam.
When not playing soccer Lam studies as an Information Systems student and worked with associate teaching professor of computer science David Kosbie to develop software that teaches high school level computer science curriculum. He also mentored underclassmen students in Dietrich through the Dietrich College Peer Mentor program.
Whatever the opportunity, Lam remembers his roots and what playing has taught him.
“We face adversity all the time, there are times you’re feeling really good and then it can just all come down. There are times you need to rely on people. I see the parallels between playing the game and living life everyday,” said Lam.

70,000 dollars can mean two things: a year of expenses for attending Carnegie Mellon, or the total value of fines leveled against Pittsburgh Steelers wide receiver Antonio Brown last football season. Hefty sums like this might typically be associated with excessively violent plays. Instead, the league fined Brown for participating in a staple of sports culture: celebrating after touchdowns.
Nicknamed the “No Fun League” by writers and fans alike, the NFL is notorious for squashing players’ personalities on the field, whether for trying to have fun or bringing awareness to certain issues. In 2015, the NFL handed Steelers running back DeAngelo Williams a hefty fine for having “Find The Cure” written on his eye black — his way of honoring his mother, who had passed away a year earlier from breast cancer. In 2013, then-Chicago Bears wide receiver Brandon Marshall was fined more than 10,000 dollars for wearing green cleats in order to raise awareness of mental illness.
Viewership for American professional sports leagues is plummeting. Ratings have dropped for all sports and the average age of spectators has risen. Sports has become a stagnant old boy’s club that is struggling to match advancements in other entertainment sectors.
Suddenly the pull of the team is not enough, but leagues do everything they can to reduce the image of individual players.
In baseball, Washington Nationals slugger Bryce Harper made multiple statements last season calling out the MLB for their handling of self expression. In April 2016, he donned a cap with “Make Baseball Fun Again” written across the front, and has been a vocal supporter of bringing more individuality into the sport.
The NHL has also recently come under fire for the league’s handling of individualism. Players such as former Montreal Canadiens defenseman P.K Subban and Washington Capitals left wing Alex Ovechkin are consistently under fire in the media for celebrating too exorbitantly. It was even claimed in 2016 that Subban was traded away from Montreal due to marketing his own brand before that of the team.
The NBA is perhaps the league which allows its players the most leeway to express themselves both on and off the courts. Basketball is also the only sport which boasted notable increases in ratings this past year. Nearly every major basketball star has his own custom sneakers. The league seemingly encourages players to establish themselves as personalities both on and off the court. There are personal rivalries and storylines which draw in new fans and generate buzz.
This team-first mentality was enough when sports were entirely localized. With the advent of streaming services and nationwide broadcasts, sports need an extra boost to make an impact in all markets. So would a sudden injection of personality make a difference? While there is no significant research on the topic, sports writers across the board have often argued for a change. Boring athletes make for boring entertainment. One man throwing a football to another can be seen on any level of football. But watching a noted character like Carolina Panthers quarterback Cam Newton throw a football to a teammate can be something else entirely.
No longer is local pride enough to support casual sports fandom. As generations change, it is the responsibility of these leagues to change with the times. It’s time for sports to embrace the personalities of their athletes and move away from a more restrictive, team-first marketing strategy. The modern world wants the Antonio Browns, Alex Ovechkins, and Bryce Harpers. So maybe it’s time to let them happen.

The topic of preventing or mitigating natural disaster destruction has re-entered public dialogue, thanks to this season’s unusually strong hurricanes. Can a solution be developed from new or existing technologies? Is there any way to reduce damages in a cost-effective manner? Or is the only way to stave off hurricane damage to abandon the coast entirely? Last week, Carnegie Mellon University Student Pugwash met to discuss just that.
The first step in determining how to stop hurricane damage is to figure out what causes the damage. The destruction stems from two fronts: wind and water. With wind speeds beyond anything human infrastructure is designed to withstand, the gale force of a storm can wreak havoc, picking up trees, cars, power lines, and other debris, then slamming them into anything standing. Water from torrential rain and potential storm surges causes major flooding in the hurricane affected area, leading to even more damage. Even after the storm recedes, a community must deal with homelessness, water-bourne diseases, looting, supply chain disruption, and a general lack of order. How does a government deal with problems of such scale?
One of the most obvious, yet problematic, prevention methods to a hurricane’s powerful waters is a levee. Several problems arise when trying to construct extensive floodwalls. The first is cost; building a levee that encircles the entire Gulf of Mexico would be prohibitively expensive. Any gaps left for cost reasons could allow destructive waves to slip through. Not to mention, many of the states and nations in the region, such as the Caribbean islands, have economies heavily dependent on beach tourism — levees would be visual pollution. All in all, levees may not be the best solution.
Another possible solution may stem from improvements in construction techniques and materials. New materials like carbon fiber may be able to better withstand a storm. Screws better designed to stay together could help prevent homes from falling apart. Building houses on stilts is an effective way to mitigate flood damage.
The problem with these materials is, once again, cost. While middle and upper class residents of the Gulf region may be able to afford them, the lower income residents who are disproportionately impacted by weather catastrophes may not be able to. For them, this solution is not helpful.
Another idea is inspired by Dutch infrastructure. In the Netherlands, where much land is below sea level, some communities are being built to float. This idea may serve the Gulf well. Instead of being destroyed by flooding, a house could simply ride out the storm on top of the waves. While the cost of the improvement would likely be significant, it would be more practical than a massive levee and may save money in the long term.
One thing is for sure: this problem isn’t going away. As ocean temperatures rise, hurricanes will continue to hit harder and more often. If a solution to the problem isn’t found in the next decades, residents of the Gulf may be forced to make a grim choice between abandoning the region or bearing the consequences of remaining in the path of these storms.
Student Pugwash is a non-advocacy, educational organization that discusses the implications of science. This article is a summary of last week’s discussion on the corporatization of academics.

"Yin-Yang", "dorky tech", "futuristic", "impossible", and "amazing potential" are all terms used to describe two major developments in technology — Augmented and Virtual Reality. Augmented Reality (AR) has captured the fascination of many the world over in fields such as medicine, sci-fi, engineering, communication, and entertainment. Virtual Reality (VR), on the other hand, is a somewhat recent invention, brought to the mainstream by Facebook's Oculus Rift. VR has the same potential to affect our lives as AR.
What are AR and VR? AR overlays 3D graphics on real world objects, allowing for an added dimension of interactivity. It literally augments reality. VR is the complete opposite. It immerses a user in an entirely different computer simulated environment, bringing us into a completely new, virtual world.

It immerses a user in an entirely different computer simulated environment, bringing us into a completely new, virtual world.
It’s no surprise that the next biggest thing in tech is going to be who wins the race to getting AR and VR in the hands of everyday people. Big names such as Facebook, Google, Intel, HTC, Comcast, Samsung, and Disney are all competing for that very prize. At the moment, AR and VR have both raised tens of billions of dollars for R&D, a company focused on cell biology. These technologies have the potential to change how we learn, interact with information, and perceive our world.
Until recently, we couldn’t tell which company would win this tech war. That all changed on Sept. 12, 2017. The most valuable company in the world, Apple, Inc., bolstered its position in the race by throwing its bets on AR. I’m talking about the most revolutionary phone released yet — the iPhone X. Tim Cook previously said, “I think AR is that big, it’s huge. I get excited because of the things that could be done that could improve a lot of lives and be entertaining.”
This is similar to what Apple has done with other products; the tech giant removed the widely used disc drive from their popular MacBook line, discontinued FireWire, manufactured a new generation of Macs with only USB-C ports, and purged the audio jack from the iPhone in preparation for a wireless future.
In most of these aforementioned instances, Apple’s intuition has proved correct; what Apple has done with the iPhone X is revolutionary for two reasons. Firstly, experiencing AR initially required specialized technology such as Snapchat’s Spectacles, an Oculus headset, or a PlayStation headset. The new iPhone allows users to experience AR without the need for extra, expensive hardware.
Secondly, ARKit, Apple’s AR toolkit open to developers, allows for a world of wonders. Previously, a developer would needed significant capital and a large team to make an AR app. Now, a small team can make a new AR application, allowing for more innovation.
The biggest and most wide-spread AR innovations so far have been Snapchat’s face filters and Pokémon Go. One of the most anticipated AR apps coming with iOS is Ikea’s app, which allows users to place virtual furniture in a room. While such an application of AR isn’t as futuristic as we might expect, the ultimate goal of this potentially transformative technology is to make our lives just a little bit easier, at least in the short run.
It’s clear that this technology still has a long way to go. Nonetheless, its ramifications are undeniable and its possibilities endless. AR will be used in medicine, for HUDs in vehicles, for artistic expression, and revolutionary video games that immerse players in an experience.
It should be expected that Apple’s announcement will keep other tech companies on their toes. We can expect to see massive innovation from other giants like Samsung and Google in response to the iPhone X. The spirit of competition will only bring the power of AR and VR to even more people around the world — making it a global technology.
The iPhone X is only a first step. We can expect AR to rapidly improve in advancement. This follows Moore’s Law, a computer science concept.

assini, the probe whose 20-year mission to Saturn transformed scientific understanding of the bodies in our solar system, has finished its journey. Early Friday morning, the probe dived into Saturn’s atmosphere, where it rapidly disintegrated due extreme heat and pressure.
The end of the mission was a bittersweet moment for the team of scientists who made it happen. “It was a perfect spacecraft,” said spacecraft operations chief Julie Webster. She continued, “Right to the end, it did everything we asked it to. It’s perfect, it’s perfect.”
While it’s sad to see Cassini go, the team knew the mission had to end sometime; the research segment of the probe’s tour was originally supposed to last four years, but it was extended in 2008 and again in 2010. Eventually, the hardy probe started to run out of fuel. Thus, the mission’s “Grand Finale” was conceived: Cassini would end its journey with a fatal plunge into Saturn’s atmosphere.
“This is the final chapter of an amazing mission, but it’s also a new beginning,” said Thomas Zurbuchen, associate administrator for NASA’s Science Mission Directorate at NASA Headquarters in Washington. Cassini’s plunge not only ensures that Saturn’s moons will not be contaminated with Earth materials. It also supplies us with the first data transmitted from within Saturn’s atmosphere.
Scientific firsts are nothing new for Cassini. Well-armed with various instruments — described by science writer Maggie Koerth-Baker as “a Swiss Army Knife in the sky” — Cassini orbited Saturn for 13 Earth years, or almost half a Saturn year. During that time, it made nearly 300 orbits around the planet, and completed 127 close flybys of Titan and 23 flybys of Enceladus, both moons of Saturn.
Before Cassini, the only things known about Titan were its size and the fact that its atmosphere is dense. There was no way to tell what lay below its thick nitrogen clouds. When Cassini arrived there in 2005, it sent a smaller probe named Huygens to investigate Titan’s surface. Through stunning photographs and atmospheric data, Huygens revealed a world NASA described as “surprisingly Earth-like.” We discovered that Titan has lakes, rivers, deserts, seasonal weather like Earth’s, and an underground ocean. These discoveries led many scientists to believe that Titan could be a hospitable environment for life.
Cassini discovered another underground ocean on Enceladus, hidden under a thick crust of ice. Scientists were intrigued by unusual magnetic data collected near the moon, and directed Cassini to take a closer look. The magnetic activity turned out to be caused by a geyserlike phenomenon — jets at Enceladus’ south pole shoot out material at 800 miles per hour through cracks in the ice, creating a gigantic spray of salt water, ice, and chemicals. Data from Cassini’s examination of the jets determined that Saturn’s outermost ring is composed of material ejected from Enceladus. Cassini also demonstrated that the interior of Enceladus was much warmer than previously thought, sparking further discussions about life on Saturn’s moons.
Cassini also brought us greater understanding of Saturn’s rings — perhaps the most iconic feature of any planet in our solar system. By studying shadows of particles in the rings, Cassini supplied data on the rings’ size and composition. They’re mostly made of chunks of ice and are flat, not warped. Some of the rings’ ice chunks are gigantic, so the rings aren’t perfectly smooth.
Cassini eventually transmitted amazing data on the planet itself: photos of the peculiar six-sided jet stream known as the Hexagon, observations of a 300,000-kilometer megastorm that encircled an entire hemisphere, the first images of lightning on a planet other than Earth. Cassini’s breathtaking photographs of Saturn are one of its most widely-celebrated accomplishments.
Cassini continued to transmit data even as it was breaking apart in Saturn’s atmosphere. Scientists are already beginning to study this final transmission and the information it contains. Even during its demise, Cassini carried on providing revolutionary insight about Saturn.

Fatal Tesla car crash with Autopilot on pinned on human error
A year and a half ago, a man called Joshua Brown died behind the wheel of a Tesla while using the Autopilot feature. A truck merging into his lane was not seen by the software, hitting the Model T in the side and killing Brown instantly.
The car doesn’t become completely autonomous when its turned on. Autopilot handles steering and speed during highway driving (which can become monotonous).
The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration has ruled that the crash was caused by human error — or Brown’s negligence. Tesla labels the feature as beta, which means it’s still testing. The automaker made sure to alert drivers of this, and had them agree to usage terms before upgrading to it.
It’s for this very reason that the crash is being pinned on Brown; even though the car was semi-autonomous, Brown was required to still monitor the road.
An even newer investigation has turned the tables, though. The National Transportation Society Board has ruled that Tesla is at fault for selling software that can be misused to easily. One cannot entirely fault drivers for believing Autopilot requires little to no human oversight.

MIT lab combines several vaccines in one single injection
MIT has recently developed a solution. Pediatricians will soon be able to deliver several vaccines at once to children. Each vaccine will then be activated in the body after the right amount of time.
Each vaccine is contained in a micro-capsule made of PGA, a biocompatible polymers. The magic of PLGA is that it can be designed to break down after a specific amount of time. The technology was tested on mice; the capsules were designed to break down after nine, 20, and 41 days. It worked.
The study is yet to prove whether this nanotechnology works over extended periods of time. Body temperature may be warm enough to affect the PLGA, so more month-long studies have to be carried out.
This technology will be especially helpful in developing countries. Children there who don’t have access to a nearby doctor at all times could receive a single injection to cover them for up to two years of infancy.
Team leader Robert Lang said, “This could have a significant impact on patients everywhere, and especially in the developing world where patient compliance is particularly poor.” Getting patients to come back for more shots in a timely manner is always difficult, especially in developing countries.This technology could solve this.

Structural coloring is an alternative to chemical pigments
In a recent study, scientists have been researching how small balls made of melanin can be structured to create color. Melanin is a pigment found in skin and hair that is responsible for complexion and color. 
These balls, although black initially, can be modified to scatter light at different wavelengths to produce different colors. When light reaches them, depending on the diameter of the melanin ball and the spacing between the individual nanoparticles, specific colors can be rendered.
This technology uses nano-scale texturing to generate color. The very mechanism is also found in bird feathers and butterfly wings.
Researchers have been finding alternatives to chemical pigments as a a means of dyeing objects because chemical pigments lose their color as soon as the chemical compound breaks down.
We can expect more durable paints. They won’t fade over time, lasting for decades potentially. We can also expect true color, something that is more challenging with traditional paint. Artists could also have access to a wider spectrum of color.
The use of melanin is innovative, especially because it’s a biomaterial. Biotechnology is a field that will rapidly expand over the next decades.

California’s internet privacy bill stalled without any votes
California legislators tried and failed to pass a bill to restore internet privacy. Earlier this year, the Federal Communication Commission (FCC) and Congress killed internet privacy with internet service providers (ISPs).
The counter bill has been placed in an “inactive file” without any votes. The bill would have required ISPs to receive consent from their customers before sharing their personal, private information with third-parties. At the moment, this is not the case.
Major ISPs like Verizon, AT&T, and Comcast were against the bill, of course. Much of their revenue comes from selling user information to advertisers — something that would be stifled if this bill was passed. Google and Facebook were also against it because they were unsure how the bill would affect business and the consumer experience.
The bill isn’t entirely done for. Many people are for it, because they don’t want their private information shared without their consent. With more public outcry, the bill can still be taken off the shelf and brought to Congress once more.

I don’t know if it is the thought of aristocratic English folk flailing about in an embarrassing way, or nostalgic thoughts about the comedy greats of Monty Python, but for whatever reason I find that comedy is 150 percent funnier when performed by those from across the pond (i.e., Brits). Even the English accent itself occasionally causes me to giggle. It was with this great accent-related joy that I attended my fourth Cambridge Footlights performance on Monday night in McConomy Auditorium.
The 11:00 p.m. performance was attended by far fewer people than the troupe merited. Not even half of the rows of seats were filled as we were patiently ushered toward the front after buying $5 tickets. There had been a fire drill before whose alarms had kept performers and audience members outside during the time when the show was supposed to start. It’s possible that with this delay and no promise of the performance occurring, some audience members gave up the ghost early in favor of snuggling in bed with some homework.
The performance opened with Carnegie Mellon’s very own Tisbert, the sketch comedy sub-troupe of the drama club Scotch’n’Soda, performing a series of comedy sketches to consistent laughter and applause. Though perhaps a little less ribald than later audience responses, there was still an air of appreciation and enjoyment. Particularly successful was the sketch that turned the watching of a network TV nightly news show into something resembling the conversation that serious fans of Game of Thrones might have while watching the show. Talks of spoilers and a thoroughly fabricated characterization and plot line of the featured meteorologist causes giggles to erupt from the audience. Instead of books offering spoilers to those watching, one of the characters read a newspaper that the other two on the couch did not want to hear anything from. The depth of the joke and its different facets and references captured the audience and entertained them at each clever turn.
When the Footlights came on stage, the energy in the audience definitely picked up. Throughout the evening, they performed sketches that ranged in length from 30 seconds to 15 minutes or so. Throughout the evening, they also called out audience members sitting in the front row, much to these individuals’ mortification and glee. Perhaps one of the best sketches of the night was an extended scene that chronicled a school bus full of children on their way to an evening performance of Cats. The field trip had already encountered other difficulties, so the evening performance was the last shot. The two female teachers, both played by male actors, were very thorough in attempting to confirm that everyone had used the restroom prior to getting on the bus. At one point, both actors mimed going to the back of the bus to examine the onboard toilet, and their miming of the motion of walking back on a school bus had the audience completely erupting in laughter; rather flamboyantly, they walked in synchronization while grabbing on to the backs of invisible seats on either side. It was absolutely absurd and also entirely relatable.
One of the more bizarre sketches of the evening was between two of the individuals and contained very little dialogue. One of the women performing held out a sheet of paper to another performer to show him that it was warm. The actor touched the paper, and then in the following minutes with more and more intensity and drama, the actor proceeded to moan in ecstasy and bewilderment and rub the paper all over himself. It was the type of comedy wherein half of the humor came from the duration of the sketch. The poor actor looked like he wasn’t breathing, such was the intensity with which he was moving this paper over himself. It was so strange and totally hysterical.
These are just two of the amazing sketches from Monday night. The five actors — two women, three men — put their all into it, even after being delayed by the fire alarm. For those lucky enough to have more years at Carnegie Mellon, I hope they come back, and if they do, please attend and laugh until your belly hurts.

In the fall of 2016, Son Little found himself in the remote city of Darwin, Australia, wrapping up a long tour. He had been swamped since his self-titled debut album came out in 2015, touring and working with other musicians’ projects, and had been yearning to write again. He finally found his chance under Darwin’s starry, tropical night sky, but was in need of a guitar. Luckily, a blind Aboriginal singer Gurrumul (who passed away soon after earlier this year) lent him a guitar. It was a lefty guitar, so Son Little had to play it upside down, yet he still found enough inspiration to write five songs in just twenty-four hours. Three of those songs would make the final cut on Son Little’s sophomore album. New Magic was released this past Friday, and it is a sonic departure from his debut; he will be playing a 21-and-over show at the Club Cafe in Pittsburgh on Thursday, Sept. 21.
Little won a Grammy in 2015 as a producer working with soul legend Mavis Staples. But as a songwriter and performer he is part of a generation that is defying definition, and fusing genres and production techniques to create songs that sound both primal and fresh. Artists like Little or New Orleans' favorite son Trombone Shorty may be too ambitious to top the pop charts but they have gained critical acclaim and a loyal following. In an interview with The Tartan, Little cites a wide range of artists such as Gary Clark Jr., Curtis Harding, Anderson .Paak, Tame Impala, and Grizzly Bear as part of this new wave who are  “chipping away at the same sort of monolith, the same sort of strict genre based music.” 
Born Aaron Livingston in Los Angeles, he grew up listening to rock, jazz, and R&B. His family migrated across the country, ending up in Queens where he discovered hip-hop. After spending high school in suburban New Jersey, Livingston returned to New York to attend Columbia University. He was unhappy there and dropped out, later enrolling in Temple University in Philadelphia, where his musical career really began to gather steam. There he met The Roots, playing music with them and featuring on a song on their album undun. But, slowly, the music in Livingston’s life began to die out. He grew unhappy again, bouncing from job to job. “I got to a point where I almost fell out of love with music,” he said, “I felt like I was over it.”
A few years later, however, Livingston would rediscover music and songwriting, ironically finding himself by taking on a new identity, Son Little.  This fresh persona helped free him up to break down those genre walls he found so confining.
He described his debut album Son Little, which was released in 2015, as a “rebirth,” returning him to his love of music. The project was a revelation, as he combined blues, R&B, soul, rock, hip-hop, country, and electronic to create a unique fusion. The genre-breaking sounds of his first record were important to him because he strives to avoid the “tight, little, three-word phrases to describe what [genre] something is.” With his music, he said, “I get to those three words and then it’s six words and then ten words and now I’m writing you an essay about what this is because there’re so many things that warrant saying.”
Songs like the grooving “Toes” or rowdy “The River” fall more towards rock, with energizing guitar riffs and drum beats, while the mixture of acoustic guitar and a twangy riff on “Carbon” lend it a country vibe. The heartfelt “O Mother” bleeds with soul, “Lay Down” is simple but soothing, and the sparse opening track “I’m Gone” sounds like blues from another planet. Most of the album sounds heavily produced — the tracks are deeply layered and he uses many unusual and hard-to-place sonic elements. He has always liked to experiment with creating bizarre sounds, and says that while on tours “we’re all in the van and I might take my laptop or my iPad out and just make beats.” In fact, he had been experimenting on his laptop on the van ride just before this interview.
However, despite messing around with electronic music in his spare time, Son Little says that he does not add in many computerized sounds in production, and that “almost everything that you hear in my songs is something that I played out in the studio through some combination of gadgets.” Furthermore, most of these sounds come from “traditional instruments: guitar, bass, drums, synths, which is becoming a traditional instrument in a way, and electric piano.” His ability to create such odd yet captivating sounds using mostly traditional instruments reveals his versatility as a musician.
His sophomore effort, New Magic, sounds more raw and less produced. For Son Little, “new magic is just like the old magic.” This mantra ushers a return to basics for him, with the album taking on a more stripped down, acoustic vibe. “Most of these songs on this new record, these songs are rooted in the lyrics and the melodies, kind of the grooves, not necessarily the instrumentation but the feeling of it,” he explained. 
While it is still recognizable as Son Little, the vocals are less smoothed over, showing off a smokier, more emotional side of his voice that wasn’t as apparent on the first album. This change was not intentional. Instead, he would just like for “whatever feels natural to come out” and for the shift in style “not to feel forced.” This approach also ties into how Son Little thinks about the magic of music. For him, there is a certain mystery to it; he doesn’t quite know where it comes from but the music, the magic is there within him. 
The album opens with “Kimberly’s Mine,” and the muted strums of the acoustic guitar and ambling piano line immediately signal the simple, more old school sound of New Magic. This is followed by the mellow lead single “Blue Magic,” its bouncy guitar and calming harmonies making you feel like you’re floating among the clouds. The much more dark and eerie “O Me O My” is next, and Son Little describes the tone as “looking around and seeing a society crumbling.” The tender “Mad About You” is another highlight. The track shows off the emotion in Son Little’s voice — as he yearns for love, his vocals become rougher, but it’s these imperfections that make the song feel beautifully real. The way Son Little cries out over fuzzy guitar on the ominous “The Middle” makes it sound like a Brothers-era Black Keys song, until the solemn, delicate strings kick in. The album closes with “Demon To The Dark,” a slow, sincere dialogue with Washington Phillips, a deacon and little known musician from the early 1900s whose music was deeply religious, in which Son Little pleads for forgiveness and asks for direction in life. 
Son Little will play in the Steel City later this week, and since much of his library, especially Son Little, incorporates many electronic sounds, the live performances may sound different than his studio cuts. He says that he and his band have gone back and forth on how to incorporate these elements, sometimes playing them on loops in the background and sometimes excluding them. His attitude has changed recently, however. “Rather than try to replicate what is on the record, we try to capture the essence of each song as best as we can with what we have.”

The old, nearly blind shaman slowly crossed the stage, holding his daughter’s supportive hand to enter the dimmed spotlight. After taking his seat center stage, the almost mythic singer-songwriter Rodriguez immediately looked more at home when he put on a white straw hat and took his guitar in hand, and the show was off.
Last Wednesday night, Rodriguez played at the Carnegie Library Music Hall of Homestead. The musician is probably best known in the United States for being the subject of the 2012 film Searching for Sugar Man, which won the Academy Award for Best Documentary Feature. In his music career, Rodriguez recorded two classic albums of psychedelic folk rock that featured his profound counterculture lyrics, Cold Fact
(1970) and Coming From Reality (1971), which garnered critical acclaim in the U.S., but little in the way of financial success. The recordings proved successful in Australia, where Rodriguez toured in 1979, but other than that tour, he had for all intents and purposes retired from music and gone about an unassuming working-class life in the United States. It wasn’t until a group of diehard South African fans tracked him down in the mid-1990s (as recounted in Searching for Sugar Man) that he found out his recordings were hugely popular in their country, where his anti-establishment, political songs resonated with a generation of young, white conscripted soldiers who had grown disenchanted with the Apartheid government (whose censors banned Rodriguez).
Rodriguez was in good voice for Wednesday’s concert, sounding much like he did as a younger man on his records. One might hypothesize that this is a benefit of his being denied the rock stardom he deserved in his youth and thereby being spared the hazardous excesses of such a lifestyle and the years of live performance which can deteriorate the voice. For the set list Rodriguez supplemented the material from his two albums with a selection of covers of pop and rock standards. After choosing the white straw hat on the table next to him rather than the other black hat, he explained that the hats have particular personalities. He then opened with a solo acoustic rendition of “Your Song,” looking vaguely reminiscent, with his hat and glasses, of Elton John on the cover of his 1974 Greatest Hits album. The awkward tension of kicking off the show with an acoustic solo that left the band standing there, holding their instruments, had me on the edge of my seat. As “Your Song” wrapped up, the band members, a guitarist, a bassist, and a drummer, kicked into the decidedly harder rocking Cold Fact classic “Only Good for Conversation.”
Rodriguez did justice to a number of songs off his albums, including his best known song “Sugar Man.” He provided an amusing commentary, warning that “Sugar Man” described a reality of drug dealing and purchasing but did not advocate such endeavors, and, after a solid performance of another relatively famous one of his songs, “I Wonder,” joked that he wondered but did not want to know the answers to the questions in the song.
The show also contained numerous surprising quirks. In “Inner City Blues,” the distinctive beeping sound effect present on the Cold Fact album was mimicked live by the drummer who had a percussion instrument like a special type of cowbell to hit the approximate tone. For one of his songs about the wealthy versus the poor, Rodriguez took off the white straw hat and grabbed a do-rag out of his shirt pocket to wear, giving him the personality of one of the street toughs in his songs. After that he changed his glasses to a pair of something like night-vision goggles that gave him an almost alien look as the green lights filled the space of his eyes.
One of the best performances was his placid, longing rendition of “I Think of You,” off Coming From Reality. He also appropriately closed out his initial set prior to the encore with the Cold Fact breakup song “Forget It,” which says in the lyrics, “thanks for your time \ and you can thank me for mine \ and after that’s said \ forget it.” But there could be no forgetting after such a performance, and the audience gave a several-minute-long standing ovation demanding that he come back out on stage. When Rodriguez came back on stage, he had taken off the white shirt and black vest he had had on earlier and wore a black hat and a tank top as cool as his songs. He performed renditions of the ‘60s rock classics “Light My Fire” by the Doors and “Somebody to Love” by Jefferson Airplane in an interesting rearrangement. Having earlier performed in the concert the pop standards “I Only Have Eyes for You” and “On the Street Where You Live,” Rodriguez closed out the encore with a stirring rendition of “I’m Gonna Live Till I Die,” which came to a rocking conclusion as Rodriguez arose from his stool to rock out on the interplay with his lead guitarist. Having taken his final bow, Rodriguez left his audience with the enduring message: “Power to the people!” with a fist raised in solidarity.
Regardless of whether he played ballads or rock songs, what stuck out through the whole show was Rodriguez’s ultra-chill composure and persona. Between songs Rodriguez did not talk a whole lot, but when he did he spoke very gently as though he were the embodiment of the humility and wisdom that comes with living the type of hard-knock life he has had for most of his 75 years. He is a man who has long held the idealistic dreams of the hippie-era and been humbled by the stark, conservative realities, which have since that time squelched any such dreams. In the intervening years between his early retirement from music and rediscovery, Rodriguez managed to earn a degree in philosophy and even ran, albeit unsuccessfully, for Detroit city office. He beautifully condensed the complexity of the human condition into the basic statements that people are highly emotionally sensitive beings, that love and hate are extremely powerful forces, and that we should be aware of these things in our interactions and act kindly toward each other.

Hey Ruth,
Today was laundry day, so I’m wearing a t-shirt with holes in it under a men’s extra-large flannel, my oversized comfy jeans, and a beanie, since showering is so much work. Want to know what still happened on my way to campus? I got honked at and catcalled by not one, but two cars on Fifth Avenue. This has been a frequent occurrence since I moved off campus. Apparently it’s so common that a lot of my friends won’t even walk on Fifth in the mornings. What the heck is wrong with some people? I’m not awake enough to make breakfast at eight in the morning, much less yell obscenities at a complete stranger. I wish I could yell or flip them off or SOMETHING, but by the time I know what’s happened they’ve already sped by. Whenever it happens, it ruins my day. I’m constantly worrying that what I’m wearing or even my body or very existence is somehow inappropriate. How do I make them stop, or at least not let it bother me, or, at the very least, somehow magically get from Shadyside to campus without going on Fifth?
Please help,
Men’s Existence Others Women 
Dear MEOW,
I’m going to start this response with the disclaimer that yes, I’m sure there’s a theoretical cat caller out there who isn’t a man, and I’m also very aware that people of all genders face street harassment. For simplicity’s sake, however, I’ll be using “he/men” to refer to cat callers and “she/women” to refer to the cat called. OK? OK.
Cat calls aren’t about compliments. Cat calling is about power. Specifically, giving power to the caller at the expense of the called. It’s dehumanizing, objectifying, and it’s an insidious way to make women feel unsafe in public and subconsciously remove them from the visible world.
But what I hate the most? That cat calls are a reminder.
A reminder that a very vocal group of people on this planet believe they have a right to comment on my existence. A reminder that public spaces are inherently balanced against me and that every single woman I know goes through the same thing. A reminder that I will be thinking about this for the rest of the day, if not longer, and he’s already forgotten.
If you’re trying to avoid Fifth, you can try the bus, or the CMU Shuttle if you’re in range. You could try taking more streets that go through housing parallel to Fifth, or you could even walk up the Negley hill and take Beeler. (I don’t recommend this unless you have killer quads.)
But you shouldn’t have to. You really shouldn’t have to.
Nothing you have done — not the route you took or the clothes you wore or even the fact that you existed caused this to happen. This really, really isn’t your fault and it really shouldn’t be your problem, but it is, and I’m sorry. The world is a gross, frustrating place sometimes. For anyone, having to put up with street harassment is disempowering and demoralizing.
To stop cat calling is to change society at large, something that, I admit, is not within this column’s purview. To stop feeling disempowered and demoralized, on the other hand? That’s something you’re in charge of. Empower yourself. Go to a protest, document harassment, participate in Hollaback!, write an article, talk to your friends — any of them — about your experience and your feelings, and why you’re more than just an object to holler “baby” at.
Because you’re a human being, not an object.
Live your life,
Ruth

As a pair of newly minted 21-year-olds heading into our senior year, we face a vital question: where is the best place in Pittsburgh to crack open a cold one with the boys or just drink away our existential angst about the future? We are embarking on a semester-long journey to find the best watering hole in Pittsburgh, one shot in the dark at a time. This week: Urban Tap.
The location: If you haven’t been to South Highland Avenue between Shadyside and East Liberty, yes, you’re missing out. The two blocks around Urban Tap are home to Millie’s Homemade Ice Cream, an excellent ice cream shop, Noodlehead, my favorite noodle place in the city, and Shadyside Hideaway, a dive bar that has been reviewed in this very column. It’s very easy to get to from campus, just a short ride on the 71B drops you off right out front of Urban Tap.
The drinks: We drank rather more than our wallets would have liked, so I feel well-qualified to give drink recommendations. Overall, the mixed drinks were a touch pricey ($9–$12 a pop), but beautiful. I’m talking cinnamon sugar around the rim of the hard cider cocktail, tall glasses of ombre liquid, and classy garnishes galore. The drinks were satisfyingly strong. 
If you’re a grown-a** adult I would recommend the Snap Dragon or the classic cocktail menu. If you’re more middle of the road, the Urban Cider is the way to go, and if you’re like us and are only technically an adult and still have the palette of a 16-year-old, the Katy Berry and Cast Away have all the sugary goodness you could desire. What makes Urban Tap special, though, is the beer. The entire back wall of the bar is dedicated to beer, with 100 beers on tap.
While the core of Urban Tap is the bar in the center of the main room, it’s also a restaurant. The kitchen is open until midnight on weekends. While the food is good, the really important thing is the Coffee and Donuts, five huge donut holes with a creamy coffee sauce.
The vibe: Let’s set the scene: the bar is trendy, all wood, glass, and exposed brick. The crowd is a little above college age, but definitely young and fun. And blasting over all of this is “Bye Bye Bye” by *NSYNC. So, it was millennial in every way. Being part bar, part restaurant, the vibe was chiller than a full-on bar.
The service was excellent, and it was busy enough to feel energetic without being too loud to relax. It’s a great place to go with a friend or two if you want to feel like adults while you drunkenly rant about life, the universe, and everything.
Lit or Nah: Honestly, neither of the above. It was definitely a fun time, and I totally recommend it for a night out with a friend, but it’s not precisely lit. Urban Tap is all about pretty drinks, delicious food, and good conversation.

Thursday night, I found myself standing in the lobby of the Byham Theater surrounded by couples young and old, groups of artsy friends, and entire families, as we waited to see The Moth mainstage event Voices Carry. The Moth is a non-profit organization dedicated to the art of storytelling. Unlike The Moth’s more commonly known StorySLAM events, which feature the stories of audience members, mainstage events host a set of practiced storytellers.
The Byham’s stage was bare except for a microphone standing in a single pool of light. The theater was filled with the kind of anticipation that comes from knowing you’re in for a good story. The lights dimmed, and the audience fell silent. Our host for the night, Kate Tellers, emerged, infectiously excited to introduce the night’s storytellers who would be responding to the prompt, “Tell us about a time you were truly speechless.”
Then, the storytellers took the stage. Each speaker had ten minutes to share their experience, but as the stories continued, I lost track of time. From filmmakers, to journalists, to slam poets, the night’s storytellers spun tales that were vulnerable, powerful, nostalgic, and, overall, beautiful.
Stories spanned broad experiences and tones, from Jason Trieu’s retelling of his childhood as an orphan in Vietnam trying to raise his younger brothers and escape to the United States, to journalist Sarah Shourd’s experience as a political prisoner in Iran, to the hilarious escapades of Adriana E. Ramírez and the trouble she’s gotten into due to her brutally honest personality. Despite these vastly different experiences, a few themes remained common. The first was appreciation for the city of Pittsburgh.
Many of the night’s storytellers were Pittsburgh natives and therefore Byham Theater was full of a considerable amount of Pittsburgh pride. Kate Teller shared tales of walking up Mount Washington with her dad and thoughts on how Pittsburgh still feels like home after years in New York, while producer and filmmaker Tony Buba recounted memories of growing up in Braddock and watching Pittsburgh emerge as a creative hub.
Another prevalent theme was that power comes from knowing yourself. Each of the storytellers ultimately came to the conclusion that their sense of self and fulfillment stems from the unshakeable truths they have come to learn about themselves, through lessons passed down by friends and family and through undergoing hardship.
Finally, the night’s stories were united by the idea that every one has a meaningful story to share. You just need to find the right way to tell it. Though the speakers had little in common with each other, and even less so with me, we were joined by shared experiences of grief, truth, love, and hope in our everyday lives.
The Moth’s event invited us to laugh hysterically, cry without embarrassment, and share moments of reflection. When the lights came on, everyone was reluctant to leave, but we left feeling connected and inspired.
Be sure to check out The Moth if you get the chance. If you’re feeling brave, check out a StorySLAM, or sit back and enjoy a Mainstage event. Either way, you’re sure to leave with an appreciation for the perspectives each of us carry, and the stories within yourself.

Greeted by pulsing music and the proclamation of a “black multimedia space,” I immediately felt the gallery buzzing with energy around the brightly colored portraits of young, black, gender non-conforming males and color-blocked sculptures constructed from found materials. “My Boys” is spray painted along the wall of portraits, functioning as a sort of shrine to the young men portrayed in the softly lit, rosy photographs. Trash bags, nets, and a very specific shade of blue break up the white and grey of the Future Tenant. Welcome Home, which opened last Friday and was curated by Sean Beauford, featuring the work of Carnegie Mellon art student Kasem Kydd and artist Brendon Hawkins, is a vivid celebration of youth, community, and identity.
Hawkins is a photographer and artist who recently moved back to Pittsburgh from New York, and this is his first exhibition. Bouncing and dancing around the gallery, he projects exuberance and sincerity, qualities reflected in his work. “My BOYS” is a series of work capturing his community of black queer men. At first glance, the portraits have a feel that is somewhere in-between editorial photography and pop art; the rosy background and the soft artificial light interact with the blocks of color to create this effect. However, the millennial editorial style of photography transcends fashion or aesthetic genres in the relationship between subject and photographer. Each portrait is titled by the name of the subject. The gazes of these men are soft. These portraits then become incredibly intimate, relationships which became clear in my conversation with Hawkins. He talks of having personal relationships with each of the subjects — whether it is the 19-year-old who he affectionately refers to as “his son” or an ex whose shared history became part of the photo.
Hawkins describes the goal of this photo series and his upcoming project “SOFT MASC” as a way of using images to complicate the archetypes expected for gay males. Traditionally, he explains, you’ll see depictions of gay black men as hyper-sexual, hyper-masculine, or hyper-feminine. There’s not a lot of nuance or diversity of identity in representation, and that’s what he would like to work against in his photography.
This is where that intimacy in portraiture becomes key. We write interesting stories and break down societal caricatures when we can paint individuals as people, as complex and cherished as we see each other in real life. “I shoot them so I don’t have to date them,” Hawkins says. He talks about how gay culture can be so sexual, that it’s hard to reach that level of deep relationship without the expectation for physical relationships as well. The camera lifts that pressure to give way to honesty and vulnerability. But make no mistake; although these portraits come from a place of deep social awareness, they are shot and presented for the purpose of celebration. And it is this dichotomy that plays towards the subversiveness of Hawkins’ work, through the exultation of a community presented without overt reference to “otherness.”
History and personal narrative are what tie Hawkins’ work to Kydd’s, but woven through sculptures and installations are the stories of displacement and diaspora rather than queerness. In the past, Kydd has worked towards art that reflects on the black body and spirit in a white society. In this show, his work tells his own story. The work is not only about generations of men in his family from the West Indies, but also about his personal history tied to New York and Pittsburgh. It wrestles with the question of what place defines the self, which intrinsically is tied to a question of home.
Materials in this work have almost become a shrine to the experience of feeling foreign or out-of-place in society. It tells a story of history that doesn’t fit a clear timeline or a narrative, but creates a portrait of a person — it’s about routine, family, and loss. The relationship of art to history is always interesting because on one hand, we understand humanity through the sequence of complicated, messy events. But art often is about the individual and the effort of building home or security in the midst of all of the broader commotion.
The history of colonialism, slavery, and oppression are evoked through these installations. “My Father Was A Soccer Player, And Built Boats By Hand,” for instance, tells a story of his father’s life as a way of understanding his place in the world. Each piece is paired with a story that paints a large picture of, perhaps more than where he came from, who Kydd is. The installation “Mourning Cricket” and video piece “Whaler Out of Water” pull music from artist Alston Becket, who was a cultural icon in the West Indies in political and social movements.
Both pieces play with superstitions and symbols — the first alludes to his relationship with his mother and to a symbol of mourning. The second refers to the ideas of industry and superstition in the whale symbolism as livelihood and survival in the literal sense. An allusion perhaps also to Moby Dick, the whale is used as a symbol of cultural erasure and white supremacy; paired with Horn Fuh Dem by Beckett, it generates a history of chasing change and progress.
The harpoon, the basketball jersey, and the soccer nets all work together and give us a strange mix of celebration of history with something that’s almost like grief. Kydd says that the art was made for himself — playing with speed of processes, and understanding his own history as there isn’t a strong West Indian community he can align himself with in Pittsburgh. It’s about finding personal direction in the past, and that tension with the allegories of race and foreignness makes it an impactful coming-of-age story.
Before Welcome Home, Kydd and Hawkins had not worked together. Curator Sean Beauford brought these two artists together to create this celebration and reflection of black youth. These artists’ works are both about displacement and love for community, and how we build our own when society has not given us a proper place or identity to call home. It’s hard to put language to ideas of “Self” when the dominant society has done its best to erase you. Humans are drawn to people like ourselves — we look for familiarity in ourselves and others. To create art that can be about the individual and the quotidian, and to allow it to become relevant to the universal experience, is not always afforded to people of color and LGBTQ folk. Activism comes in many forms, and sometimes it’s a celebration that transforms and transcends. Stepping into a space that does not reduce the complexity of identity or take away the tenderness and specificity of the personal was powerful. As a viewer, it was an honor to be allowed into the moments and the people that have come to shape who these artists are today because, as corny as it may sound, we find home in our art as we find home in each other.

Every summer, a few songs come along that dominate pop culture, blaring out of cars and on beaches, with even casual listeners recognizing the biggest hits. This summer was undoubtedly won by the inescapable “Despacito” by Luis Fonsi and Daddy Yankee featuring Justin Bieber. Other major pop stars, like Bruno Mars, DJ Khaled, Ed Sheeran, and Kendrick Lamar, also took over the radio waves across
America. 
However, several lesser-known artists — Dan Auerbach, Trombone Shorty, Curtis Harding, and Son Little — also released new music this summer, including songs that may have been just as popular and omnipresent if had they had been attached to a mainstream pop star like Mars or Bieber. While the big hits of today often fade from memory not long after they fall from the charts, the inventive and soulful sounds of these four artists will likely captivate fans for years. Here are those songs of the summer.
Auerbach is the most famous of this group — as singer and guitarist for the Black Keys, he has already topped the Billboard Charts and snagged Grammys for singles like “Tighten Up” and “Lonely Boy.” Released in June, his second solo effort Waiting On A Song diverts away from the blues rock sound of the Black Keys, instead crafting an album that feels like it was just discovered in a time capsule from the 1970s.
While there are some slower, moodier songs like the masterpiece “King Of A One Horse Town,” this nostalgic-sounding collection features sunny tones that are a drastic contrast to the dark sounds of Auerbach’s work
with the Black Keys and The Arcs. The country-pop vibe and silvery guitar sounds make many of the songs seem like they were written by George Harrison, Tom Petty, or Paul Simon. This sound comes
in part from the team of greats Auerbach recruited to assist him—Mark Knopfler of Dire Straits, Duane Eddy, and John Prine as well as several legends from Nashville, where Auerbach now lives. The airy guitar and soft vocals of Waiting On A Song make the album feel like it is was designed to be played in the summer, and the irresistible bounce of the catchy “Waiting On A Song” and “Shine On Me” feel like they were meant to be played cruising along in a Mustang Convertible on a sunny day.
The first two tracks of Trombone Shorty’s fourth studio album, Parking Lot Symphony, set the tone for how Shorty will blend sounds on the album. The opening song “Laveau Dirge No. 1,” a mournful, wailing jazz number, is followed by the up-tempo cover of The Meters’ “Ain’t No Use.” Hailing from New Orleans, Shorty fuses jazz with rock, soul, and funk, with a hint of hip-hop in some of the beats. While the album’s genius stems in part from its diversity — from the slinky, groovy “Dirty Water,” which features electric piano, to the lush harmonies on the title track and the relaxing, soulful “No Good Time” — Shorty makes his bid for song of the summer with three songs that feature memorable hooks and danceable rhythms: the anthemic Allen Toussaint cover “Here Come The Girls,” which celebrates his love for the opposite sex with a dynamic riff and a simple but infectious chorus, “Where It At?”, which is darker lyrically but remains catchy due to its funky groove, and the brash, hip-hop inspired “Familiar” that shows off Shorty’s swagger. Had Bruno Mars recorded any of these songs, you’d already know them by heart... and you still should.
This summer, Harding released two singles, “On and On” and “Wednesday Morning Atonement,” giving fans a taste of what’s to come when he drops his sophomore album Face Your Fear next month. These tracks give a nod to his previous album, Soul Power, which combined elements of blues and rock for a vintage soul feel. “On and On” features an upbeat drum beat, hopeful horns, and Harding’s emotional, expressive vocals. “Wednesday Morning Atonement” is a murkier track, full of eerie piano, fuzzy guitar, and smokey vocals. Before Face Your Fear drops, be sure to check out Soul Power. Standout tracks include the inspiring “Keep On Shining,” the exuberant “Don’t Wanna Go Home,” and the bluesy “Castaway.”
Like his label mate Harding, Son Little is influenced by soul music. However, while Harding sticks with a more retro sound, Little uses that inspiration to create something wildly new. Little also released two singles this summer, “Blue Magic (Waikiki)” and “Demon To The Dark,” in anticipation of his second album, New Magic, which came out this past Friday. “Blue Magic” is a laid back song, with sunny vocals floating over a soft guitar melody and lighthearted xylophone. The song makes you let go and forget about the stress surrounding you and just enjoy the moment. “Demon To The Dark” feels gospel-inspired, with Little pleading for forgiveness with his smooth, honest vocals while gloomy piano plays underneath. These two tracks are a bit of a departure from Son Little’s eponymous first album, which had a much more bluesy, hazy feel. Furthermore, Son Little featured a heavier use of electronic sounds, such as on the psychedelic “Go Blue Blood Red.” Other highlights include the rambunctious “The River,” minimalistic and romantic “Lay Down,” and otherworldly “I’m Gone”. However, “Blue Magic” and “Demon To The Dark” are the perfect songs for a mellow summer day.

Carnegie Mellon students clustered at the Randy Pausch Memorial Bridge this past week to see what soon may become a common sight on the Carnegie Mellon campus, around six Nubian goats munching away at the Kudzu vines on the Gates east side landscape slope. The goats belonged to Allegheny GoatScape, a local nonprofit organization dedicated to renting goat herds to clear public spaces and promoting goat husbandry, and were brought in as an eco-friendly means to clear the vegetation that had sprung up between the Gates-Hillman Center and Purnell Center for the Arts. The goats grazed from Wednesday, Sept. 13 to Friday, Sept. 15 as part of what Facilities Management and Campus Services director of operations Steven Guenther called in The Piper “a trial program in support of the Green Practices Committee.”
The goats clear the invasive Kudzu vines without the use of harmful herbicides. The only fuel they need is the plants in their enclosure, which they then turn into a natural fertilizer. The Allegheny GoatScape website also claims that goats are perfectly suited to “manage Pittsburgh’s steep slopes,” since they can navigate the steep hills with ease and can even climb out to shallow ledges on buildings. Steven Guenther cited the multitude of environmental benefits that goat landscaping provides in the university press release and affirmed that this week’s foray into environmentally conscious landscaping was “all part of our commitment to a long-term maintenance plan that may combine goats with manual labor.”
The goats were enclosed in about two thirds of an acre of overgrowth by an electric fence and a green plastic fence adorned with a tartan sign that read “Goats Working.” The goats had a small enclosure with water and solar powered lights and were accompanied by a miniature donkey named Hobo meant to fend off predators. Onlookers craned over the edge of the Randy Pausch bridge or clambered up the hill to watch the goats work and included students, children, and members of the Pittsburgh community. The goats even prompted local news coverage, with the local CBS station KDKA-TV calling it a “step back in time” for our technologically advanced university.
David Wessell, grounds supervisor, cited this visibility as one of the reasons that this site was chosen for the inaugural implementation of this program. He outlined the hope that “the goats will capture student interest at least from their sense of ‘novelty’ on the campus landscape. Our focus going into the event is that a green practice that is usually conducted in back park areas or in municipal right-of-ways will now be easily viewable to our campus community members and thus provide for a true learning opportunity.”
Pittsburgh’s own South Side Park welcomed Allegheny GoatScape goats in the beginning of August. Mowing goats have become an increasingly common phenomenon as city and state governments, companies, and property owners seek to find an environmentally friendly way to clear out weeds from large spaces. So common, in fact, that according to the Detroit Free Press, the American Federation of State County and Municipal Employees filed a complaint that the hiring of goats by Western Michigan University eliminated union jobs. David Wessell stated that ordinarily the plant growth “would be cut-down mechanically with trimmers by [Facilities Management and Campus Services] gardener staff and/or landscape service vendors in the month of November after plant dieback due to temperature freeze” but that “because of the specific and limited function of Goat Grazing in the ornamental landscape they do not feel threatened in the scope of their grounds work.”
This limited scope could prove a challenge to planned expansion, should the program be deemed enough of a success. According to David Wessell, goats require tracts of land spanning around an acre and there aren’t many that meet this requirement that contain the kind of growth that the goats clear.
Nevertheless, the hillside is now neatly shorn, and the goats’ visit sparked an almost certainly unprecedented interest in environmentally conscious methods for groundskeeping at Carnegie Mellon, if the rubbernecking at the Randy Pausch Memorial Bridge is any indication. This interest is what Facilities Management and Campus Services and the Green Practices committee ultimately sought in bringing livestock to campus, meaning that this trial run will doubtlessly be deemed a success.

Carnegie Mellon University, in collaboration with Frank-Ratchye STUDIO for Creative Inquiry (STUDIO) and the Carnegie Museum of Art, has received the National Endowment for the Humanities (NEH) grant to identify, annotate, and organize the impressive collection of more than 80,000 photos taken by photographer Charles “Teenie” Harris from the 1930s to the 1970s.
Harris was one of the lead photographers for the Pittsburgh Courier, one of the nation’s most influential black newspapers in the 20th century. The Courier represented the voice of the black community in this era. It advocated equality and justice, and Harris’ moving, yet eye-opening photographs perfectly complemented the voice of the paper. His inspiration was the city of Pittsburgh itself, as his photographs chronicled life in Pittsburgh’s black neighborhoods from the mid to late 1900s.
Beginning in the 1930s, Harris’ photos depict the joys and struggles of the black community in Pittsburgh’s storied Hill District. Ranging from images of children in a crowded swimming pool, to civil rights demonstrations, Harris’ work captured a side of the African-American experience in this era that was rarely visible in his contemporary American media. Since his photos depicted activities in daily life, such as weddings, church-groups, night-life, Little League games, and beauty pageants, his work is often viewed as celebrating the working class. However, he did not shy away from depicting life on the other side of the tracks. In addition to photos about family life and society, Harris’ impressive collection also includes photos of Muhammad Ali, Louis Armstrong, and John F. Kennedy.
Nicknamed “Teenie,” for his small stature, Harris was affectionately regarded by the African-American community as an icon. He was frequently seen at civic and family events, and people always looked over their shoulder in the hopes that Teenie would be there and would take their photo. Though he was popular among entertainment venues, Harris also photographed people walking down the street, sitting on their front porch, having a drink at a bar, or waiting at a beauty salon or barber shop. Harris’ works record a vibrant, thriving community, thus effectively redefining the 20th century a time that was plagued with racism to one overcome with determination.
In a response to NPR about Harris’ encapsulating work, Lulu Lippincott, curator of a new exhibition of Teenie Harris’ photos at the Carnegie Museum of Art, said, “[Teenie] conveys, in a way that I’ve never experienced before in photographs, the immediate experience of being in a different place, a different time.”
Harris’ archive, consisting of thousands of photographic negatives spanning over more than forty years, came without identifying information when the museum acquired his body of work in 2001, thus inspiring the project led by the Carnegie Museum of Art and STUDIO. Only about two percent of the individuals in all the photographs have been identified to date, after extensive interviews with the community members pictured in Harris’ photographs, and his contemporaries. In an effort to speed up the recognition process, STUDIO developed a set of image identification tools using machine learning and computer vision techniques with the help of the NEH grant.
“Image scans and a digital catalog have allowed us to share Harris’ work faster and with more people than traditional paper-based methods; moreover, digital technology allowed people to contribute their memories and knowledge to the archive more efficiently than ever before,” said Lippincott in a university press release.
The software developed by STUDIO will be able to identify the individuals in each photograph. These matches can then be confirmed by interview subjects. Remarkably, the software also becomes “smarter” as a person interacts with it, allowing it to make more accurate matches. This process is also useful for identifying objects, locations, and features in the photographs.
Zaria Howard, a junior in the School of Art pursuing a Bachelor of Humanities and Arts degree in art and statistics, proposed the idea for the project. As a student in Professor Golan Levin’s undergraduate Interactive Art and Computational Design class in the School of Art, Howard developed an interest in Harris’ image archive and the mystery behind the individuals in the photographs. Golan is leading the project as director of the STUDIO, along with David Newbury, who is an Enterprise Software and Data Architect at J. Paul Getty Trust.
In a university press release, Howard said “It’s exciting to be able to use computer vision and ML to add detail to the narrative Teenie Harris left Pittsburgh. Using technology to rediscover black history is rare and yet crucial to understanding American history as a whole.”
By improving this software, Harris’ photographs of the famous, the infamous, and the ordinary will hold new meaning as the people in the black-and-white images come to life. They will have names, families, and a history. They will be recognized and will serve as representation of the black community in the 20th century. They will reflect the successes, hardships, frustration, and grit of the community over forty years of an ever-changing America. They are forever captured in history through Harris’ extraordinary work.

Karl Marx has a legacy and influence that has dramatically changed everyday political and social life. The Prussian-born political and economic theorist is best known for the Manifesto of the Communist Party (colloquially known as The Communist Manifesto), which he co-authored with colleague Friedrich Engels, and Capital, a seminal text in politics, economics, and philosophy. The influential political philosopher, born on May 5, 1818, is now more relevant than ever due to increasing income inequality, the aftermath of the global financial crash in 2008, and a new skepticism of capitalism among the post-Cold War generation.
Dietrich College faculty members Kathy M. Newman and David Shumway have created a year-long series of celebratory events that will culminate on Marx’s 200th birthday this spring. This series of events — Marx@200 — is one of the nation’s only year-long programs devoted to Marx and his favorite themes.
On Thursday, Sept. 14, Marx@200 kicked off with Newman and Shumway’s lecture, “Why Marx Now: 200 Years Later.” Richard Scheines, Dean of Dietrich College, was first to speak and provided welcoming remarks as well his personal experience with Marx growing up. For most of Scheines’ early years, Karl Marx was known as the “author of Communism,” and as a child raised in the aftermath of McCarthyism, Scheines was unsurprisingly a product of anti-communist propaganda, where none of his high school education “even probed slightly beneath the surface” of Marxism. What struck him in this experience is the importance of institutions like Carnegie Mellon to support the freedom of thinking beyond the propaganda every citizen experiences from birth. Individuals must take seriously the role of incorporating all political perspectives, and they “can’t be unwilling to celebrate Marx,” or be dismissive of any thought that might compromise conventional thought. The series of scholarly events to celebrate Karl Marx supports this notion.
Kathy Newman, an associate professor in the department of English, studies and writes about the relationship between the masses and mass culture, specifically the relationship between television, film, and media, and the socio-political world our culture reflects and creates. The theme of her talk incorporated artists like Wang Yuyand, Claire Fontaine, Jorge Mendez Blake, and Christin Lahr, with Marx being their common denominator. Some like Fontaine delve deeply into Marx’s philosophy, using art as modern tongue-in-cheek commentary, while others like Wang Yuyand take the literal substance and translate it into data, combinations of 1s and 0s, to create morphed and distorted sculptures.
The modern resurgence of Marxism surpasses art, said Newman as she described the international phenomenon of Marx’s popularity. East Germans are especially affected, “rooted in nostalgia for socialism.” A Guardian survey found that 52 percent of their citizens believed the free market was unsuitable, and 43 percent said they want socialism back. As the single most cited scholar in the humanities by a factor of 22, Marx has become steadily more popular around the globe and Newman moves on to speculate why.
Newman’s first hypothesis for the growing popularity of Marxism was the global financial collapse of 2008, which “made Marx’s critique of capitalism look fresher than ever.” Marx predicted cycles of collapse and consolidation and his analysis explains how inequality deepens during times of capitalist crisis. Moreover, the post-Cold War generation view socialism and communism more favorably than during anytime since the 1940s. Newman referenced a scholar at Tufts University who claimed that millennials are more skeptical towards capitalism than their parents, especially because many of them graduated into the worst job market since the Great Depression. Millennials also see Scandinavian countries as models of democratic socialism, rather than current or former communist countries like Russia and China. This is not so much for a utopian inspiration, but instead they are seeking to understand all the ways capitalism is failing ordinary people. They’re bringing us a Marx whose contemporary value is in explanation and critique.
David Shumway, professor of English, mirrored Newman’s arguments through a different lens, as noted by the title for his part of the talk, “How Marx Now,” instead of “Why Marx now.” The ability to reexamine Marx can transform the understanding of Marxism, and this reexamination is the foundation of Shumway’s lecture.
Shumway’s arguments were that Marx is best understood as a liberal and not an opponent of liberalism, and that historically, Marx has made a significant impact on politics that is seldom recognized, which is that his ideas are the basis for the many changes in liberal democracies associated with the welfare state. From the translation of Marxist ideas into new policies, Shumway contends that Marx’s influence, despite the fact that a literal interpretation of his views at the time which would be against social democratic reforms, gave way to the right and inevitable rise of the political system. Shumway uses text from Capital to enhance his arguments. He emphasizes the value of freedom on both ends, for the bourgeoisie and the proletariat. It is just that the dictatorship of the proletariat will be more liberal than the dictatorship of the bourgeoisie.
In the wake of extreme political and economic unrest before the 1950s, many western countries turned into welfare states, where national governments take at least some responsibility for the welfare of their citizens. The fear of a communist revolution led the bourgeoisie to concede some economic authority to the public. Thus, fear of the extreme left allowed a more moderate left to rise. Marx was accidentally the founder of social democracy, formed out of the dregs of bourgeois fear.
Both lectures sufficiently summed up the relevance and importance of Marx in the modern age. As we look ahead to the rest of the year and the uncertainty of our current economic and socio-political landscape, we know that for whatever large-scale issue that will be thrown at us, Marxism can offer a theory of its underlying causes. The next Marx@200 event will take place on Thursday, Oct. 19 at 4:30 p.m. in Porter Hall 100 entitled “Robotics, Pittsburgh, and the End of Work.”

Carnegie Mellon University serves as an “economic engine”, providing nearly $2.7 billion in annual economic impact for the local, regional, and state economy in Pennsylvania.
Philadelphia’s Econsult Solutions explains in a recent report from the 2016 fiscal year that part of the reason Carnegie Mellon has a huge spillover effect is because the university ensures that its inflow of education, research, and commercial activities are directed into Pittsburgh’s economy.
The University’s operations create over 7,610 jobs in the City of Pittsburgh and over 12,500 jobs within the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, whether they are direct, indirect, or induced jobs. These jobs range from purchasing food and healthcare, real estate living, and transportation services, although over 70 percent of Carnegie Mellon employees are in some sort of educational services sector. In just the city of Pittsburgh alone, the economic output from jobs is around $1.2 billion.
Additionally, the university has spent around $271 million in capital investments and $219 million in certain construction over the past six years. Over the last year, the amount of University construction increased by almost $40 million, partly due to building sites like the Cohon Center extension, which opened mid last year, and the David A. Tepper Quadrangle, opening in 2018.
The university plans to upgrade old facilities and construct new ones by spending around $520 million on construction projects through 2022. When such large-scale projects happen, the immediate economic impact and aftermath is beneficial as different jobs and operations such as technical services, manufacturing, waste management, etc., increase.
Most of the money Carnegie Mellon attains is in the form of tuition and research grants, so what the university exports in terms of talent, innovation, and engagement has driven itself and Pittsburgh. With over 20,000 alumni in Pittsburgh and a collective 13,000 students, these members increase the educational attainment level and wage earnings of Pittsburgh’s workforce, especially over the long run.
Carnegie Mellon utilizes its inflow of money to assist student inventors and community entrepreneurship. Through services from the Center for Technology Transfer and Enterprise Creation and the Swartz Center for Entrepreneurship, students and regional entrepreneurs foster their entrepreneurial ideas and projects. In fact, over the past five years, Carnegie Mellon has helped over 148 start-up companies grow. As much as $783 million in venture capital funding from 31 of these start-ups are located in Pittsburgh. They potentially attract attention and economic boosters from areas like Silicon Valley and New York City. Some notable projects include reCAPTCHA and Carnegie Robotics. Nearby firms include Amazon, Disney, Apple, and Google, which actively capitalize on the university’s talent.
Another noteworthy aspect of Carnegie Mellon is its diverse geographic distribution of students. Around 43 percent of Carnegie Mellon students are from outside the U.S. Their presence cannot be understated to just diversifying an area, but also promoting a variety of local services through real estate, grocery stores, religious establishments, and low-margin businesses which thrive from the certain niche they serve.
Carnegie Mellon University also emphasizes students and faculty civic engagement and community contribution to the arts and humanities. Right now, the University’s Metro21 initiative improves metro-related problems to facilitate transportation in the Pittsburgh area. The University’s technological projects also help the public; Airviz Inc., a Carnegie Mellon-based company, has marketed Speck, a device used to monitor air pollution. Over 1,000 of these devices are used in the Pittsburgh area, and have also spread nationwide.
Carnegie Mellon also has a highly regarded College of Fine Arts, which generates an output of talent for the local arts scenes in the Pittsburgh area. The arts and humanities are not just an attractive factor to the area, but are vital in a broad economic scene. Pittsburgh’s arts and culture scene provide a workforce for individuals, attract local businesses, and invigorate its urban areas with younger populations. The Cultural District in Pittsburgh is composed of the Ballet Theater, Opera, Symphony Orchestra, Public Theater, Cultural Trust, and more, all of which the Carnegie Mellon community attends and learns from.
Without a doubt, Carnegie Mellon is an esteemed institution, which provides its members with many opportunities who in return give back through monetary returns, community projects, talent, and prestige. What is important is that the university continues to prioritize that such economic and social benefits spread through Pittsburgh and influence the larger community.

As one of the youngest top universities making a name for itself, Carnegie Mellon does not shy away from celebrating the innovations and accomplishments achieved in the short few decades since its relatively recent fusion in 1967. Since the founding of Carnegie Institute of Technology in 1900, we have transformed from a small vocational school to an internationally renowned research university with a range of full-fledged interdisciplinary programs and exceptional engineering, computer science and business programs.
As Carnegie Mellon turns 50 years old this fall, the university is taking advantage of the opportunity to publicize its history and praise our founders, Andrew Carnegie and Andrew Mellon. We should, indeed, celebrate the tremendous growth of the university and reflect upon our history with pride. However, we should not gloss over the darker aspects of our history and paint the portraits of our founders like flawless heroes.
The unfortunate truth is that Carnegie Mellon was not as progressive and tolerant in the past as it has become in the present, and can we easily pinpoint our founders’ identity and influence with a few sentences about their wealth and philanthropy. Andrew Carnegie, the founder of Carnegie Institute of Technology in 1900, heavily funded the research of eugenics, a subject concerning using different practices to improve the gene pool of humans. Some of these practices include advocating sexual abstinence for certain populations, involuntary sterilization of criminals, the population with disabilities or traits deemed to be undesirable, and compulsory abortion. Carnegie Institute of Washington Station of Experimental Evolution, funded by Andrew Carnegie, carried out research and experiments for over three decades. This chapter of history of Carnegie Mellon and its founders is often overlooked, but reflecting upon the inglorious past prevents us from stepping into the future with ignorant blithe.
Diversity and equality at Carnegie Mellon have certainly come a long way since the early days of the university. In 2017, the number of female students enrolled in the first year class of the School of Computer Science has, for the first time, exceeded the number of male students. A new Student Center for Diversity and Inclusion opened this fall, aiming to create a more open, accessible environment for students to have conversations regarding diversity. But though it is undeniably diverse now, Carnegie Mellon was hesitant to integrate women into its academic programs until 1973. Women who wished to study at Carnegie Mellon University before 1973 had to attend Margaret Morrison Carnegie College, a women’s college and vocational school. Even though it has been decades since we have become a coeducational institution, the male population of Carnegie Mellon has been traditionally larger than the female, and the racial distribution has been far from even.
The recount of Carnegie Mellon’s history given by the university includes no mention of the imperfection of the university, nor does it explicate how the institution would respond to these shortcomings. This attitude, although understandable at a celebratory time, is dangerous, just like the ignorant optimism steered by the peaceful, untroubled appearance. This is a common human mistake when looking back on history, especially when the subject involved seems to be successful at a glance; temporary prosperity wipes the memory of the unpleasant past that seemed to amount to nothing, but an unfortunate past is just as important as, if not more than, the pillars that constructed success. 
At the 50th anniversary of the university, it is crucial for us to examine the missteps we have made along the way, so we can tread farther on the road of growth, and continue to innovate and progress. We should not be distracted by the seemingly perfect image of history and believe that we have done everything right to get up to this point.

When Donald Trump announced his intention to ban transgender troops from serving in the military, there was an outcry from a significant portion of the population. But the knee-jerk, poorly-thought-out decision should inspire concern and outrage in everyone, regardless of political affiliation or other beliefs. The issue at hand is about more than preventing someone from going through military training or serving in a war. It’s about the blatant denial of basic human rights to which all Americans should be entitled, and the singling out of a vulnerable group in a way that harmfully paints them as an other.
Trump’s decision, which was was first announced in a series of tweets, would reverse steps Barack Obama took during his presidency to make it easier for LGBTQ individuals to serve in the military. Trump claims that financial concerns related to transitioning and hormone therapy led him to declare a ban — but those concerns are based in inaccuracies. Far from “burdening” the military with outrageous medical costs, gender transition-related health care coverage would increase spending by only $2.4 million – $8.4 million — 0.04–0.13 percent — annually.  (In contrast, Military Times has reported that the Department of Defense spends roughly ten times that amount — around $84 million — on erectile disfunction medications like Viagra.)
Estimates of transgender service members vary widely, but the number could be as high as 15,000. That means that Trump wants to belittle and dismiss as many as 15,000 individuals who are willing to put their lives on the line to protect each and every person in this country, even him. With less than one percent of Americans willing to enlist in the military, we should be grateful for all of the brave people who volunteer their service. Trump’s ingratitude is almost as great as his hypocrisy.
The American Civil Liberties Union filed a motion for an injunction of the ban. Senator John McCain (R-AZ), the top Republican on the Senate Armed Services Committee, has also come forward to challenge the ban. He joined Senator Jack Reed (D-RI), Kristen Gillibrand (D-NY), and Susan Collins (R-ME) in introducing a bill that will prevent the president from moving forward with the order.
The bill would stop the Pentagon from denying the reenlistment of transgender troops currently in service based on their gender identity, and require Defense Secretary James Mattis to continue with the training of transgender troops already recruited before Trump announced the ban.
Additionally, Mattis has stated that his department will continue to discuss the implementation of the bill. In the meantime, transgender Americans already serving are permitted to reenlist.
This deliberation surrounding Trump’s announcement shows that the decision is in no way final at this point, but it is more important now than ever that it is fought and overruled. If Trump can decide to take away some rights that should be guaranteed to citizens of this country and get away with it, there’s no reason he couldn’t start to strip people of other rights as well. We must draw a line, and we must draw it now, in time to protect a vulnerable group in society from being treated unfairly and cast aside.
The freedom to serve in the military is not one that can be taken away based on gender identity, any more than it can be denied on a basis of race or sexuality. Transgender people are not a burden, financially or in any other way. We as Americans, as human beings, cannot allow something so based in prejudice and misinformation to become a reality.

The “Friendly Island” of Saint Martin and its neighboring company are in for a not-so-friendly time after the region surrounding the Caribbean was battered by Hurricane Irma, a category four storm and one of the strongest of its kind to hit the area in several years. In its wake, Irma left the popular island destinations barely habitable and in chaos. Every picture that surfaces on the internet or Facebook is a testament to total destruction of the entire island. Both sides of the island, the Dutch and the French, look as though a massive bomb has exploded and left everything, including the palm trees, broken and in shambles. 
As an international vacation spot, the economy there relies almost entirely on tourism — but in the off season, while the main tourist spell is over, the native community including many foreigners who provide services for tourists, are being left to fend for themselves. After the initial uproar of the hurricane hitting the island, the tragedy has not been given very much more attention in the news. While the French and the Dutch government did send their armies to help restore security and will pour a lot of their own resources to rebuild the infrastructure and the economy, shouldn’t the same people who come for the resorts and the beaches and the sun-soaked fun times refuse to turn their backs when it’s not so fun anymore?
With most of the infrastructure left destroyed and splintered in the streets, resources have depleted rapidly, and with most of the food gone, Saint Martin has been left in despair. With nowhere to go and nowhere to turn to, many of its inhabitants have resorted to plundering any of the remaining supplies, resulting in fighting breaking out among the streets — a rather stark and dark contrast to its affectionate moniker as “The Friendly Island.”
It has been almost a week. There should be a massive international effort for relief right now. Instead, the international community consciously leaving the island on its own in such catastrophic condition amounts to nothing more than leisure-based exploitation at its finest.  After all, the island has been a summer destination for the middle, but mostly upper, classes from all over the world. Dr. John Markoff, a sociology professor from the University of Pittsburgh, has visited the island numerous times and has met people from many South American countries, Europe, as well as lots of Americans. “We met people even from Russia and Poland, and often found ourselves speaking Spanish as often as French while staying there,” he said in a brief interview with me, markedly illustrating the vast international diversity among the tourist population that floods to the island during its most popular summer months.
The last time the 100 square km region was left ravaged in such epic proportions was under the intensity of Hurricane Luis during the hurricane season of 1995, rendering much of the island of Saint Martin entirely uninhabitable. This was over twenty years ago — and now it's happening again with no better efforts and no better preparations. 20 years ago some of the little towns and communities in Saint Martin and Sint Maarten were left without water and electricity for three months. Today, the French and the Dutch army need to protect citizens against armed gangs trying to steal water and food, scarce commodities. Yet, despite the immediate efforts of the French and the Dutch, sleeping in the street may be the only option for many days to come for the numerous people who have lost their homes.
I was hoping that the international community of Saint Martin’s vacationers would react to immediately start organizing fundraising, just as we are doing for those afflicted by Hurricane Harvey, even if it means only helping one victim of the hurricane at a time to restore their lives. I am not the only one who is concerned that the devastated Saint Martin may need the help of the very people who used to flock to it when it looked like a paradise.
Dr. Markoff is also afraid that, once the hurricane has vanished, so will the global attention to the island. He and his wife are trying to get in touch with the people who work there and whom they got to know throughout years, but it has taken a long time to find even the first person by posting and using their connections via Facebook.
With Saint Martin being a speckle of land in a vast body of water and its international airport destroyed by the hurricane, even the people who love this place and would like to help feel powerless. Unless there is an international and outside relief effort spurred by an organization with the means for sending goods and donations to Saint Martin, the people of the tiny paradise will live in an isolated hell for a long time to come.

On Oct. 26, 2012, four states (NY, MD, NC, PA) and the District of Columbia declared a state of emergency in preparation for Hurricane Sandy. Over the ensuing weekend, four more states (NJ, CT, MA, RI) joined them. With winds up to 80 mph, Hurricane Sandy approached land as a Category 2 storm on Monday, Oct. 29, depriving 7.9 million households and businesses of electrical power. The tropical cyclone closed the New York Stock Exchange, the United Nations headquarters, countless government offices, and a myriad of transit services throughout the region, leaving 11 million commuters stranded.
In the following months, Congress scrambled to draft a bill to provide relief to Hurricane Sandy victims. Ultimately, on Jan. 29, 2013, Congress approved the Disaster Relief Appropriations Act. However, to the surprise of many, 179 House Republicans voted against the package, with 23 out of 24 Texas Republicans voting no.
Senator Ted Cruz (R-TX) was a notably outspoken opponent of the relief package. “Emergency relief for the families who are suffering from this natural disaster should not be used as a Christmas tree for billions in unrelated spending,” said Cruz. “The United States Senate should not be in the business of exploiting victims of natural disasters to fund pork projects that further expand our debt.”
Cruz's characterization that the package was “[funding] pork projects” and “a Christmas tree for billions in unrelated spending” was short-lived, however. Upon the Obama administration’s request, the Congressional Research Service issued a report on Feb. 29 that verified that virtually all of the funds were being allocated towards actual relief and restoration projects. 
Today, with the recent impacts of Hurricanes Harvey and Irma, we sense the unpleasant feeling of déjà vu as we watch politicians respond to the catastrophes in Texas and Florida.
“This storm has done historic damage to Houston, my hometown… the flooding has exceeded anything the city has ever seen before,” said Cruz on MSNBC, Aug. 28. In response to a question by Katy Tur regarding his change in stance on federal aid from Hurricane Sandy to Harvey, Cruz replied that “there’s time for political sniping later; I think our focus needs to be on this crisis and this disaster… two-thirds of that bill had nothing to do with Sandy.”
Since his controversial remarks, numerous political figures have called out Cruz for his alleged double standard. 
“Many Texas reps and notoriously, @SenTedCruz fought against Sandy aid, so crucial to CT,” posted Rep. Jim Himes (D-CT) on Twitter. “Going with my better angels to fight FOR Texas aid.”
A more pointed critique was issued by New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie who told CNN that Cruz is “repeating the same reprehensible lies about what happened in Sandy [and] called on Congress Wednesday morning to work quickly on a bill to aid Texas after Hurricane Harvey.” 
Before accusing Cruz and other Texas Republicans with hypocrisy, we ought to make some concessions. Hurricane Harvey was truly an unprecedented Category 4 storm, with winds up to 130 mph, that indisputably wreaked greater havoc on the South than Sandy did on the Northeast.
Nonetheless, despite the difference in magnitude of these storms, what should remain constant is the consensus of members of Congress from around the United States to provide relief and aid to regions in need. This is not an issue that specifically pertains to liberals or conservatives; it is an issue that plagues the political system as a whole.
Granted, the fixed stance of Texas Republicans, such as that of Cruz, that the Disaster Relief Appropriations Act of 2013 was a misallocation of funds — even with the aforementioned report that reinforced the integrity of the bill — makes it easy to point fingers at those Republicans for hypocrisy and politicization of such crises, especially at a time when the same politicians are urging for federal aid for Hurricane Harvey victims in “red states.” 
Yet, we must take a look at the broader picture. We constantly witness debates on both sides of the aisle about “politicizing” events such as mass shootings, natural disasters, and other nation-wide emergencies. 
This impasse, perpetuated by the growing divide between the two major political parties, must cease in the name of unity. Sure, debates can be fruitful and are often necessary; politics requires citizens to engage in discourse on the nation’s most pressing issues. Nevertheless, certain values — in this case, the safety of citizens — must transcend political wrangle; after all, one of the most fundamental responsibilities of governments is to maintain the welfare of its citizens. Adopting this mentality is the only way that the United States can dispose of the persistent regionalism and polarization that divides society. Without it, the victims of Hurricanes Sandy, Harvey, and Irma will only be remembered as statistics from a politician's speech.

A star NFL quarterback has been blacklisted for daring to protest the national anthem on behalf of a minority community. Violence has erupted on college campuses all over the country in response to ‘alt-right’ rallies and controversial speakers such as Milo Yiannopoulos. A Harvard-educated Google employee was fired for writing a manifesto saying women are biologically inferior to men.
Freedom of speech and expression and its limitations has become the defining sociopolitical issue of our era. The burning question on everyone’s minds today is whether or not hate speech is protected under the First Amendment.
The answer is “Yes.” There is no hate speech exception to the First Amendment.
Justice Samuel Alito of the Supreme Court of the United States (SCOTUS) recently wrote, “Speech that demeans on the basis of race, ethnicity, gender, religion, age, disability, or any other similar ground is hateful; but the proudest boast of our free speech jurisprudence is that we protect the freedom to express the thoughts that we hate.”
As with every law however, there are certain expectations. SCOTUS established in 1919 with Schenck v. United States  that while the First Amendment guarantees freedom of speech, it does not protect dangerous speech or rhetoric that could lead to “imminent lawless action.”
The modern alt-right movement is a modern coalition of neo-Nazism, filled with white supremacy, antisemitism, fascism, homophobia, and misogyny. Having existed on the fringes of society for decades, they were suddenly catapulted into the spotlight due to the actions of a few individuals such as Stephen Bannon, Richard Spencer, and of course, the leader of the free world.
On Nov. 8th, 2016, this movement achieved their biggest coup yet — they successfully managed to gain supporters and sympathizers in all three branches of the government in one fell swoop. The bigger surprise, however, has been how ineffectual this coalition has been. Legislation such as the transgender military ban, building a wall across the entirety of the U.S.-Mexico border, and Trump’s cooperation with “Chuck and Nancy” to formalize Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) seems to indicate that the alt-right legislative agenda has amounted to a complete failure.
Even though there hasn’t been a definitive legislative accomplishment yet, that’s not to say the alt-right hasn’t been victorious in its own right. News about the alt-right has become commonplace and while many of their actions would’ve triggered outrage just a year ago, now it’s the new normal. The 24-hour media cycle has led to us forget that the president not only refused to denounce white supremacy, but actively defended it.
This has further emboldened proponents of this flawed ideology to further spread their vitriol. Their new argument is that they can say whatever they feel like saying — no matter its effect — due to the First Amendment, which protects freedom of expression.
These claims are simply false.
The First Amendment only protects freedom of expression when it is evident it will not lead to imminent violence. The very purpose of these “free speech” rallies and demonstrations is to incite anarchy. In fact, the very purpose of the alt-right coalition is to encourage violence against specific minority and marginalized communities such as black communities and the LGBTQ community, for example.
These groups defend themselves by saying that their rallies are protected under the First Amendment. Their claims that they’re here for a peaceful demonstration fall flat when they march on streets armed to the teeth. They not only violated their 400 people protest permit in Charlottesville, but explicitly told all attendees to bring their firearms with them. If that’s not preparing for bloodshed, I don’t know what is.
We have learned, however, that just because those who belong to the alt-right, or at least sympathize with them, occupy positions of extreme importance in our government doesn’t mean that they can continue to propagate hatred without consequences.
The Twitter account @YesYoureRacist solicited the identities of those who attended the white supremacist rally in Charlottesville in August. After discovering these identities, employers were notified that certain employees were white supremacists — and these companies now faced a choice. They could either defend the indefensible, or they could let these people go.
There was no contest. The response was swift and immediate. Cole White was fired from his job at Top Dog, a popular hot dog restaurant in Berkeley, California. The website hosting service GoDaddy removed the neo-Nazi website Daily Stormer off its servers. The aforementioned actions have led to companies such as PayPal, Airbnb, and Google, which suspended the accounts of alt-right users, to be sued under the claim that these firings are in direct violation to the First Amendment — that one cannot fire an employee for their political views.
This is patently false.
The government cannot censor speech; however, the same does not apply to the private sector. These individuals are fired not for their political views but for rather how their actions reflect upon their employer. No one is fired for being liberal or conservative but rather for being white supremacist, misogynistic, or homophobic. This was also the case for the participants of the ‘Unite the Right’ rally in Charlottesville.
The lesson we should learn from this incident is that we cannot stop people from supporting causes that persecute minorities — but we can ensure real world consequences for them. Hate speech might be protected from censorship by the government; however, that doesn’t equate to people being able to encourage violence against a specific community without ramifications.
Free speech has its limitations. We cannot always depend on the government to protect our individual rights, but that doesn’t stop us from doing so ourselves. If the President of the United States won’t denounce bigotry, we will. Just because the government allows people to denigrate others, it doesn’t mean that we have to.

Scrolling through my social media feeds, I see the expected: conservatives arguing with liberals. But I also see an equal amount of liberals arguing with fellow liberals, sometimes about which politicians are good people, sometimes about what issues are important, and sometimes it's honestly just petty bickering. With the very conservative Republican government that we have right now, it is important that liberals work together as a team, and in order to do so, liberals must learn the rationale behind each of the current factions of liberalism. Despite the diversity within liberalism, there is much more that liberals hold in common.
One large source of contention among liberals right now is the 2016 Democratic primaries. Although Senator Bernie Sanders (I–VT) was not widely loved — he lost the primaries by a significant 12 percent margin — he was loved very deeply by his supporters. Some loved him for his economically progressive platform, with enthusiastic support for things like income equality, free public education, and universal health care. Others appreciated his unlikely path to political success as an independent, not beholden to any political party or wealthy donor, and how Sanders continued this independence throughout his campaign by funding the majority of the campaign through small donations from regular citizens.
Sanders supporters were highly disappointed when Sanders did not win the nomination and felt that it was because of the DNC's hesitance to support the independent candidate. They felt that the Democratic Party's rejection of Sanders was a sign of the Party's centrism, and believed that Hillary Clinton, too, often compromised on liberal policy just to remain in power. Sanders supporters' backing of Clinton was, therefore, lukewarm at best. These Sanders supporters might believe that Clinton lost the general election because she was not liberal enough and felt too entitled to votes.
What Sanders supporters might find surprising is that many people supported Clinton for similar reasons to why people supported Sanders: she planned to advance the most socially and economically liberal platform that the Democratic party has ever seen in a general election. Gettysburg College Democrats posted a series of images to their Facebook page last October of students holding up whiteboards with reasons that they were voting for Clinton on them, and many of the reasons, like "She supports a pathway to full and equal citizenship" and "She's a progressive who gets things done," mirrored the sentiments of Sanders supporters when praising their candidate. Others liked the fact that she was one of the first women in history to seriously vie for the U.S. presidency and felt that having a woman president given this nation's history would make it possible for girls to grow up feeling like their gender would not hinder the achievement of their dreams.
Clinton supporters, who believed that Clinton was as good as, if not better than, Sanders, were upset that many Sanders supporters only saw Clinton as the better of two evils. In fact, enough Sanders supporters didn't vote for Clinton in the general election (either voting for a different candidate or not voting altogether) that had they felt more enthusiastic about Clinton, they could have changed the outcome of the general election. Clinton supporters also feel that the "email scandal" syphoned off potential Clinton voters from the right in addition to the rampant sexism expressed by Donald Trump, as this base of voters increasingly found Clinton untrustworthy and deserving of punishment.
Even liberals who never supported Sanders can surely see that he was a unique candidate full of passion and big dreams for the nation and can acknowledge that his accountability and independence are refreshing. Liberals who did not support Clinton can find similar refreshment from the idea of more women in power. Additionally, Clinton supporters, Sanders supporters, and other liberals alike can understand feeling upset when your candidate loses and the desire to blame external factors, be they the DNC or Russian hackers. We can all agree that neither major Democratic candidate was perfect but they both had strengths. Both the primary and general elections of 2016 are over. We need to acknowledge the residual hurt and disappointment that we are all feeling from last year so we can move forward together.
The need to come together with others in order to get things done is inherent to democracy, which means that liberals must unite before we can make tangible political change happen. Instead of deciding which 2016 candidates were better or worse, or which liberal issues are more or less important, liberals should try to learn why other liberals support candidates and issues that they don't support. If we all learn more about each other, we will find the values we have in common that make us liberals, we will learn to trust each other, and we will learn to work together.

Privilege — a word we’ve all become acquaintanced with. We are constantly told to check how aspects of our lives, many of which are outside our control, give us societal advantages and blind us from potential hardships others face. White privilege, male privilege, class privilege... we have heard about those. It is important to keep this dialogue going and understand how our privilege can shape our perspectives so that we can better understand those from varying backgrounds. However, there is one that is not discussed but probably should be, especially in light of current events such as the current political climate in Venezuela, which is currently heading toward a dictatorship.
The privilege of not having dealt with the impacts of communism is the one we will be discussing today.
I am privileged in this sense, too. The only exposure to communism that I have faced was reading about it from a safe distance in the comfort of the school’s classroom. I could read and stay up studying for my exam on the Cold War, but I understand that learning about the facts in such a sheltered environment could not fully convey the human costs that communism bore.
I can fully understand why one may find communism appealing, especially in this political climate. In a time when job prospects look bleak at best and the gap between the economic haves and have-nots increase, people want change from the status quo and will be more willing to risk venturing off to an economic policy that promises a chance for equity and overall well-being for all, not just a select few.
It is worth stating that every economic ideology has flaws. A pure laissez-faire economy is another extreme end that is not sustainable, and economists will generally agree that some government intervention is necessary to ensure a fair economy. One of the ten principles of economics states that “governments can sometimes improve economic outcomes.” By stimulating the economy when the market is not running smoothly, government can stimulate an otherwise struggling market and give it the boost that it needs to pick back up again.
Thus, we find ourselves in the middle — a relatively free market that provides some subsidies as a safety net to provide for the poor. Services such as food stamps and unemployment benefits attempt to close the gap between those who are and are not struggling socioeconomically. However, many could argue that society is not doing enough and that the people deserve a much more radical change — specifically, breaking away from capitalism and straight into communism.
To some extent, this seems logical. If something is failing — in this case, our economic policies — try to implement a change in input to get a change in output. However, we cannot dismiss history or contemporary events while we make our decisions. To be able to dismiss the hundreds of lives affected by China’s Cultural Revolution (1966–1976) or the rising death tolln Venezuela now as “not real communism” is to display one’s privilege and complacency. Perhaps these were horrible implementations of communism, but it is worth noting that one of the problems with communism is that people are virtually incapable, if not completely, of transforming this utopia into reality.
This was seen here at Carnegie Mellon on Sept. 13 in Porter Hall 100. English professors Kathy M. Newman and David Shumway discussed communism through differing lenses. Professor Newman used the visual arts, which illustrated Marx as if he were a pop icon instead of a theorist, and Professor Shumway used reasoning to explain the logistics behind communism. The artwork could be universally agreed to be aesthetically pleasing regardless of politics, and the wish for communism was logical. No sound person would be able to object to a society where liberty and equality reign, yet the actual implementation of Marx’s utopia is not nearly as simple as verbally advocating freedom and equality. Yes, capitalism has heavy flaws, and people from all areas of the political spectrum must converge to create a society in which we can ensure the well-being of our people and our society as a whole. However, forcing a radical economic change, especially one in a short amount of time, is catastrophic at best.
Perhaps Karl Marx had his heart in the right place, and perhaps he would have been appalled that his ideology was used to defend the regimes that claimed to center around his vision. However, the fragility between life and death is merciless and does not bow down to intention. Che Guevara, who originally wanted to end class struggles and emotionally expressed it in his autobiography The Motorcycle Diaries, ended up claiming lives in order to progress his ideology. Fidel Castro, whom Justin Trudeau infamously considered a "friend", had a drastically different perception by Florida senator and Cuban-American Marco Rubio, who felt the impact from a far more personal level.
Not having been impacted by communism is not the issue at hand. Willfully ignoring the blood on communist regimes’ and rulers’ hands is.

Editor’s note:  Transatlantic Thoughts is a weekly column that examines Carnegie Mellon’s student life from a foreigner’s perspective.
When I arrived at Carnegie Mellon one year ago for my Masters, I knew that the school would be different than my French undergrad. And indeed, as I discovered its quirks and customs, I began to blend into its environment and assimilate its culture. Nevertheless, a number of things still surprise me here, and I wanted to bring into this column an outsider’s perspective that will hopefully highlight a different way of solving Carnegie Mellon’s problems.
To begin, I would like to discuss the university’s grading policy, at least in the computer science department, which is the one I know the most. I am still impressed by the level of excellence that is expected of the students, especially with the “assignments are 50 percent of the grade” policy that really emphasizes a practical knowledge that is complementary to the theory. But while I was struggling, like everyone else, to complete all my assignments and projects, I realized something else about the grading policy: it does not reward those who are able to quickly acquire new knowledge and apply it, but rather those who are able to spend the most time completing tasks to avoid making any mistakes.
This article is not a rant about the courses’ difficulty; it is precisely the difficulty that makes a Carnegie Mellon education so valuable. Rather, what I am trying to convey is that having a high 70/80/90 percent grade cutoff with expected-to-be-completed assignments and close-to-lecture exams incentivizes the students to adopt a harmful behavior due to increased stress. To better explain it, let us suppose that for some reason, you fail a typical assignment worth 12 percent of your total grade and score 45 percent on it. Then, you know that you have lost 6.6 percent of your total grade, and coming back to a 70 percent average necessitates that you score a 95 percent on the next assignment.
This example shows that one temporary weakness during the semester can actually be disastrous for students, especially given what retaking a class entails. Repaying thousands of dollars for educational material you have already seen, and maybe even postponing your expected graduation, can have huge consequences for your future. Given that, it is no wonder why the stress culture at Carnegie Mellon exists.
Some might say that it is the price to pay for excellence. To those, I would argue that there is a balance to be found. From my experience, I might have some clues on how to tweak the grading system to reduce the level of stress it applies on students while expecting the same excellence. The first proposition would be to lower the grade cutoff to something like 50/75/90 percent, to reduce the impact of a single failure over the semester. However, to keep the same level of difficulty, assignments and exams should be designed a little bit differently: the first half of the points should be winnable with a basic understanding of the course’s concepts, and the latter half would require students to dev-elop more complex reasoning without the lecture material’s help.
I know this design is very difficult to implement, especially for programming assignments whose completion status is more binary: either the implementation is correct, or there is still a bug to fix. I also know that most professors and teaching assistants work hard to ensure the fairness of the grading. But what I propose is, I think, a change in philosophy of how assignments and exams are designed: instead of making all problems solvable by everybody in infinite time, make one part of it easier and another part more challenging, with a more pronounced difficulty gradient.
My second proposition is something that is mundane in France but apparently disruptive here. Everyone knows how easy it is to fail an exam: lack of sleep, temporary indisposition, anxiety attack during exam time. That is why in France and other countries, students are guaranteed another chance. When your total grade is below C, you can re-take the final exam for free in hopes of getting a higher grade. If you succeed, you can improve your final course grade and get a C without taking the course again. The second wave of exams is usually organized once or twice a year, during the vacations just before the semester begins.
Rattrapages, as they’re called, are so common that some students (especially those who work part-time during their studies) don’t even come to the first series of exams because they know they won’t be able to study everything in time. Without going to such extremes, the possibility of re-taking an exam is a huge deal concerning stress: when you know you will have a second chance, anxiety is less likely to kick in and hinder you. This does not gives you a free you-passed-the-course ticket: it gives you more time and opportunity to show that you have acquired the required knowledge.
Obviously, this procedure would entail a financial loss for the university: fewer students retaking and paying for courses, plus the cost of organizing a second wave of exams. However, these additional funds could come from the last 3 percent undergraduate tuition increase, representing million dollars more per year. With these new ideas, I hope that Carnegie Mellon’s grading system would become a lesser factor in the stress burden shared by many students.
