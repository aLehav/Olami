There will be baseball in 2022. And to everyone’s surprise, it will be a full season. Baseball will be delayed for the third year in a row, but we will be treated to the full 162-game slate. Commissioner Rob Manfred and the MLB Players Association announced last Thursday that they had reached a new collective bargaining agreement, ending the lockout that cut spring training short and looked likely to shorten the season, too.
However, in the new CBA, the two sides agreed to widespread changes to the game, some of which will change the game for better, some for worse. They include a 45-day window for new rule changes in 2023, the universal adoption of the DH, a draft lottery to reduce tanking, a limit on optioning players to the minor leagues, as well as a 12-team playoff.
It’s the 12-team playoff that has the potential to ruin baseball.
Baseball has long been great because of the importance of the regular season. Unlike the NFL, where there are flukes in a short season, or the NHL, where the playoffs are everything, a baseball team cannot get lucky or sneak into the playoffs as a mediocre team. A team must win, and win, and win again. If they win when they shouldn’t have, it’s not much help — over the course of the season, they probably need to rack up ninety more wins. For most of the past few decades, you had to be consistently good to make the playoffs during the grueling season.
The classic MLB format has been as follows: 30 teams, split into two leagues of 15, each split into three divisions of five. The winner of each division makes the playoffs, as well as the best second-place team in each league. In each league’s playoffs, the division winner with the most wins would play this wild-card in a best-of-five series, while the other two division winners would play another best-of-five. The two teams remaining in each league would play a best-of-seven series to determine the pennant winners, and the two pennant winners would play in the World Series to determine the best team in baseball.
This was, for lack of a better word, nearly perfect. There were no bad teams making the playoffs — a bad team wouldn’t be able to survive the slog of the regular season. Bad teams would be weeded out early and their fans treated to stress-free, sunny, cheap baseball for the remainder of the season. The good teams would engage in brilliant races, tracking each others’ wins and losses, playing tense, nail-biting games down the stretch. At the end, eight very good teams would be left. There was suspense and randomness to the playoffs, but there was no chance of a poor team slipping into the league championships or, God forbid, the World Series.
Then, in 2013, seeking to add more drama to the season, the MLB introduced a second wild-card in each league, and the two wild-cards would play a single game for the right to make the playoffs. This may have boosted television ratings, but it was a disaster for the game. If one team was running away with the wild-card, that team now faced a high chance of being knocked out before the playoffs even started by a team that was nowhere near as good, thanks to the single-elimination game. If instead two teams were in a close race for the wild-card, the outcome is equally bad. Instead of following every twist and turn of the wild-card race, the teams’ fans could just tune out until the beginning of October, knowing that the only game that mattered was the single matchup in the wild-card round. Either way, the wild-card game was good for ratings, but terrible for baseball.
Now, the format is warped even further, in a way that puts even divisional winners in jeopardy of missing the top eight. While the current wild-card game is turned into a best-of-three, which is good, a third wild-card is added, who will have a crack at the worst division winner in a new best-of-three series. This is wholly unnecessary. It’s quite likely that for many years, in one league or the other, the same division will contain both the third-best division champion and the third-best wild-card. This will force a team who won their division, holding on across 162 games, into an embarrassing, luck-prone draw where two bad games against a team they already proved their worth against can end their season. It’s easy to see why the MLB is doing this, as it will add ten dramatic games to the playoffs and boost their revenue, but keeping teams who won their division fair and square out of the divisional series is just wrong.
In 2022, 12 teams will make the playoffs. The beauty of an eight-team playoff is that any one of the eight teams is usually good enough to make the World Series, or even win it. Seeing teams who could be playing deep into October fighting for their lives in division races is what makes August and September baseball so special. Instead, we’ll see mediocre teams in the close regular-season races, most of whom will be out of the picture by the time things heat up anyway.
To make baseball more exciting, the league should go back to its old playoff format. Thirty teams, eight in the playoffs, two pennants, one champion. That’s the way the game worked when it was at its attendance peak in 2007, and it’s the way generations have grown up watching the game. It would bring meaning back to the regular season, and make it likelier that at year’s end, the best team in baseball lifts the trophy.

PSG vs. Real Madrid
Although based upon the result, the first leg seemed to go PSG’s way, a closer look at the statistics reveals that this was not the case at all. Even though the home side managed to secure the win through a run into the box by Kylian Mbappé in the fourth minute of stoppage time at the end of the second half, PSG had the chance to put up a much wider margin. Having tallied a total of 21 shots, eight of which were on target, PSG completely failed to take full advantage of the opportunities they had. While some shots were blocked due to the efforts of Courtois and the Real Madrid defense, many whizzed over the top of the goal or across the face of the goal, and others just seemed to have the wrong amount of power or the wrong trajectory. For an offensive lineup composed of Mbappé, Lionel Messi, and — beginning in the 73rd minute — Neymar, the inability of PSG to capitalize on the myriad of chances they had was truly unfortunate, especially considering the fact that they managed to limit the visitors to just three shots, none of which were on target.
PSG’s inability to open a bigger margin at home would come back to haunt them in the second leg. The visitors played reasonably well in the first half at the Santiago Bernabéu, with Mbappé scoring in the 39th minute to make the aggregate score 2-0 in PSG’s favor. Real Madrid would not be so passive this time around, however, and Karim Benzema scored in the 61st, 76th, and 78th minutes — a 16-minute hat-trick — to win the second leg for the hosts 3-1, putting Real Madrid through to the quarterfinals. Ironically enough, Real Madrid tallied 21 shots in the second leg, seven of them being on target. Their ability to capitalize on three of these chances in comparison to PSG’s one in the first leg truly ended up being the difference between a spot in the quarterfinals and being knocked out of the European Champions League.
Winner: Real Madrid
Sporting vs. Man. City
The two legs of the Sporting-Manchester City match went about as expected. Sporting was completely outclassed in the first leg, and City managed to score a total of five away goals — Riyad Mahrez opened the scoring in the seventh minute, Bernardo Silva followed Mahrez up in the 17th minute, Phil Foden scored in the 32nd minute to make it 3-0, Silva completed his brace in the 44th minute, and Raheem Sterling topped it off with a fifth goal in the 58th minute. Sporting never had a chance, with just three shots, none of which were on target.
Manchester City came into the second leg confident in their five away goals, and perhaps rightfully so. Still, their performance in the second leg paled against their performance in the first. Despite 14 shots, four shots on target, City failed to score a single goal at their home stadium. Regardless, they shut Sporting out. The match ended with no goals scored on either side, but City’s five goals from the first leg were more than enough to send them through to the quarterfinals with an aggregate scoreline of 5-0.
Winner: Manchester City
Salzburg vs. Bayern Munich
Salzburg played well in the first leg against Bayern. Despite having the odds against them, the home side took the lead in the 21st minute through a goal by Chukwubuike Adamu. Although they could not convert any of their other five shots on target, Salzburg prevented Bayern from scoring until a 90th minute attempt by Kingsley Coman drew the visitors level. Bayern’s performance was underwhelming. Converting just one of 22 shots (nine on target), Bayern failed to create a favorable margin going into the second leg.
Bayern were phenomenal in the second leg. Playing on home turf with Manuel Neuer back from injury, the German side looked much more comfortable. Robert Lewandowski opened the scoring with a penalty in the 12th minute, then doubled Bayern’s lead with a second penalty in the 21st minute. Just two minutes later, Lewandowski completed his 11-minute hat-trick to make the score 3-0 to Bayern. Serge Gnabry joined Lewandowski on the scoreboard with a goal in the 31st minute, as did Thomas Müller in the 54th minute. Maurits Kjærgaard pulled one back for the visitors in the 70th minute, but it was too little, too late. Müller completed his brace in the 83rd minute, and Leroy Sané topped it off with a clinical finish in the 85th minute to make the final scoreline 7-1 — the largest margin in this year’s round of 16 — sending Bayern through to the quarterfinals on an 8-2 aggregate.
Winner: Bayern Munich
Inter Milan vs. Liverpool
The first leg went about as expected. Although they were on home turf, Inter Milan were ultimately unable to hold off Liverpool’s offense. The first half ended with neither team making it onto the scoreboard, but Liverpool were persistent in their attacks, and Roberto Firmino finally ended the deadlock in the 75th minute. Teammate Mohamed Salah doubled the lead with a goal in the 83rd minute to give Liverpool a 2-0 edge going into the second leg.
Despite being back at Anfield for the second leg, Liverpool failed to perform as well as they did in the first leg. While they were able to convert both shots on target in the first leg, Liverpool failed to find the back of the net at home despite 12 shots (two being on target). This gave Inter Milan the opportunity to stage a comeback. But despite a goal in the 61st minute by Lautaro Martínez giving the visitors some hope, Inter were unable to convert either of their other two shots on target. And so, despite winning the second leg 1-0, Inter Milan lost to Liverpool 2-1 on aggregate, and it was ultimately the English side that moved on to the Champions League quarterfinals.
Winner: Liverpool
Chelsea vs. LOSC
Much like the matches between Manchester City and Sporting, LOSC put up a good fight despite having the odds stacked against them, but were ultimately unable to overcome a stronger Chelsea side. Kai Havertz opened the scoring in the first leg with a goal in the eight minute, and teammate Christian Pulisic doubled the hosts’ lead in the 63rd minute. Despite the match finishing 2-0 in Chelsea’s favor, Lille put up an impressive fight, recording 15 shots (albeit only two were on target and neither were converted) and statistics similar to Chelsea in possession, passes, and passing accuracy.
Lille’s efforts persisted in the second leg, and a penalty converted by Burak Yılmaz in the 38th minute put the hosts within one of equalizing the aggregate score. Chelsea continued their consistency, however, and a goal by Pulisic in the third minute of injury time before half-time leveled the visitors. César Azpilicueta scored in the 71st minute to solidify a 2-1 win for Chelsea, making it 4-1 on aggregate to the English side and sending them on to compete in the Champions League quarterfinals.
Winner: Chelsea
Villareal vs. Juventus
Juventus entered the first leg as the obvious favorites and seemed to confirm their dominance when Dušan Vlahović scored off of a counterattack with just 32 seconds on the clock. The Old Lady, however, failed to make any additional headway afterward, managing just one more shot on target which was not converted. In contrast, Villareal played well, recording three shots on target, with the 66th minute attempt by Dani Parejo drawing the home side level.
Despite Juventus having underperformed in the first leg, they were still expected to win the second leg and move on to the quarterfinals. They were playing on home turf and, indeed, the statistics confirm that they had more shots (14), shots on target (five), corners (seven), possession (59%), and passing accuracy (90%) than the visitors. Despite all this, however, the Old Lady failed to capitalize on any of her opportunities. In contrast, Villareal played clinically and efficiently. Despite recording just three shots on target, the Spanish side converted all of them. Gerard Moreno opened the scoring with a penalty in the 78th minute, Pau Torres followed that up with an 85th minute goal, and another penalty converted by Arnaut Danjuma in the second minute of stoppage time won the match for the visitors 3-0. With a final aggregate score of 4-1, Villareal put themselves through to the quarterfinals and knocked Juventus out of the Champions League.
Winner: Villareal
Atlético Madrid vs. Man. United
Like Juventus, Atlético started off the first leg well, with João Félix putting the hosts up 1-0 in the seventh minute. Also like Juventus, however, Atlético made little progress after Félix’s effort. Despite putting up 12 more shots across the rest of the 90 minutes, Atlético failed to record any more shots on target. This gave Manchester United the opportunity to draw level, but the English side struggled as well. It wasn’t until an 80th minute attempt by Anthony Elanga that the visitors equalized to make the final scoreline 1-1.
The second leg didn’t go much better for United. Despite 11 total shots, five being on target, the English side was unable to beat Jan Oblak. While De Gea held his ground impressively as well in the United goal, he was unable to deny a 41st minute header by Renan Lodi. With Lodi’s effort being the only goal of the match, a 1-0 scoreline meant that Atlético Madrid would be the team to qualify for the quarterfinals on a 2-1 aggregate.
Winner: Atlético Madrid
Benfica vs. Ajax
The first leg between Benfica and Ajax proved to be one of the most eventful and thrilling matches in this year’s Champions League round of 16. Dušan Tadić opened the scoring for the visitors in the 18th minute, but this was negated when Sébastien Haller put the ball into the back of his own net in the 26th minute to make the score 1-1. Haller then redeemed himself just minutes later, scoring a second goal for Ajax (this time at the right end of the field) in the 29th minute. Benfica was not passive, however, and put up a strong offense in the second half of the match. This paid off, and Roman Yaremchuk’s 72nd minute effort drew the home side level again, and the match ended 2-2.
Despite being at home for the second leg, Ajax performed arguably worse. Whereas in the first leg, the Dutch side recorded 11 total shots with eight of them on target, just two of the 16 shots Ajax took in the second leg were on target. Even though they had significantly more control over possession and passing accuracy, Ajax played mediocrely at best. Although Benfica played highly defensively and recorded just a single shot on target (and four shots total), one shot was all that they needed. André Onana came off his line to punch away a corner, but a header by Darwin Núñez directed the ball past Onana and into the back of the net with just 13 minutes left on the clock. Ajax had no reply, and a 1-0 win made the aggregate 3-2 in Benfica’s favor. This sent the Portuguese side on to the quarterfinals and knocked Ajax out of the European Champions League.
Winner: Benfica

Women’s Swimming and Diving
From March 16-19, the Women’s Swimming and Diving team traveled to the 2022 NCAA Division III Swimming and Diving Championships in Indianapolis. On the first day, several members competed in individual events. Senior Kierstyn Cassidy swam the 500-yard freestyle and finished 36th of 54 with a time of 5:03.15. First-year Emma Hoffman finished 50th in the same event with a season-best of 5:07.85. Junior Bonnie Wang placed 40th of 62 with a time of 2:07.94 in the 200-yard IM. Junior Tiffany Tseng placed 59th in the 50-yard freestyle in 24.32 seconds. The 200-yard medley relay of Hoffman, Wang, Tseng, and Cassidy finished 26th overall with a time of 1:49.54.
On the second day of the championship, Tseng, Wang, Hoffman, and Cassidy once again took to the pool for the 200-yard freestyle relay, placing 25th with a combined time of 1:37.31. Cassidy and Hoffman later competed in the 200-yard freestyle — Cassidy finished ahead of Hoffman with a time of 1:54.68 compared to Hoffman’s time of 1:56.03; Cassidy placed 46th and Hoffman placed 54th.
Wang and Tseng both raced well, reaching the finals of the 100-yard backstroke on day three. Wang finished ninth with a time of 55.50, and Tseng finished just behind, tying for 11th with a time of 55.91. This earned Wang a new school record and both All-America Honorable Mentions.
On the final day of competition, Cassidy finished 11th in the 1,650-yard freestyle with a time of 7:07.20, setting a new school record for the event and also for her 1,000-yard split of 10:22.10. This earned her All-America Honorable Mention as well. Wang and Hoffman both earned All-America Honorable Mentions in 200-yard backstroke. Hoffman placed 14th overall with a time of 1:01.73, and Wang placed 15th with a time 2:01.89. With these All-America Honorable Mentions, Carnegie Mellon finished 24th of 44 colleges with 25.50 points.
Men’s Swimming and Diving
On March 16-19, the Tartans traveled to Indianapolis for the NCAA Division III Swimming and Diving Championships. The first day came with some new school records and some All-America finishes for the Tartans. 
Senior James Kyle finished fourth in the three-meter diving board with a score of 502.50, earning him his first All-America title. Junior Aleksander Tarczynski set a new school record in the 200-yard IM with a time of 1:49.13 in the preliminaries. His 15th-place finish in the event with a time of 1:50.92 earned him All-America Honorable Mention. The 200-yard medley relay of first-year Adel Heddadji, junior Erik Feldmann, and seniors Colin Daniel and Justin Britton placed 14th with a time of 1:29.74, earning them All-America Honorable Mentions. Feldmann also set a school record in the 50-yard freestyle with a time of 20.40, placing 22nd of 65.
The Tartans didn’t slow down on the second day, earning more All-America finishes and breaking more school records. The 200-yard freestyle relay of Britton, Feldmann, and juniors Yousef Hassen and Matthew Nagler earned All-America Honorable Mentions after setting a school record of 1:20.66 in a 12th place finish. Britton then went on to place 10th in the 100-yard butterfly with a time of 47.88, topping his own school record and earning an All-America Honorable Mention. 
Britton also set a new 100-yard backstroke record of 47.77 during the preliminaries of the 400-yard medley relay, topping the previous record he set in 2019. The 400-yard medley relay team of Britton, Daniel, Feldmann, and senior Sean Ream finished 11th overall with a school record of 3:16.93, earning them All-America Honorable Mentions. Senior Richard Dauksher placed 10th overall in the 400-yard IM, also earning an All-America Honorable Mention.
The Tartans took more points on the third day, in large part due to Britton’s efforts. With a school record of 47.50 in the 100-yard backstroke preliminaries and a sixth-place finish of 47.53 in the finals, Britton earned yet another All-America Honor. The 800-yard freestyle relay consisting of Dauksher, Heddadji, Tarczynski, and Daniel narrowly missed the top 16, placing 18th with a time of 6:43.03. Kyle also narrowly missed making top 16 in the one-meter board with a 415.15 points.
The Tartans finished the last day with two more Honorable Mentions and two more school records. Britton performed strongly once more during the 200-yard backstroke with a time of 1:46.52, earning him an All-America Honorable Mention, a school record, and 11th place. The 400-yard freestyle relay of Britton, Hassen, Feldmann, and junior John McNab finished 10th place with a time of 2:58.51, earning themselves a school record and All-America Honorable Mentions. CMU placed 14th overall in the championship with a score of 91.50.
Women’s Track and Field
Members of the Women’s Track and Field team traveled to the 2022 NCAA Division III Track and Field Championships on March 11-12 at Winston-Salem, North Carolina. Junior Liz Barre competed in a variety of events, breaking two school records and earning two additional personal bests. In the pentathlon, Barre broke the school record with 3,399 points. She also won the high jump, clearing 1.66 meters, tying a school record. In the 60-meter hurdles, Barre placed fifth with a time of 9.07 seconds; she also placed 11th in shot put with a mark of 9.91 meters. Both were personal bests. Junior Samantha Giordani also competed, placing 12th overall in preliminaries in the 200-meter dash with a time of 25.47. Giordani did not make it to finals, as only the top eight advanced.
The next weekend, the Tartans had their first outdoor meet of the year at the Washington and Lee Track and Field Carnival in Lexington, Virginia. In her first outdoor meet, first-year Katie Monahan placed third in shot put with a mark of 11.97 meters, breaking the school record. Graduate student Kendra Noneman shattered the previous school record for hammer throw by over eight meters, placing first with a throw of 55.42 meters. First-year Kayla Rountree continued the momentum, placing second in javelin with a throw of 31.65 meters.
On the track, sophomore Isabella Rhee placed second in the 400-meter dash with a time of 59.22. The 4x400-meter relay team of sophomores Emily Lannen, Caitlin Kolb, Rhee, and junior Kavya Tummalapalli took third with a time of 4:09.25.
Men’s Track and Field
On March 11-12, the Men’s Track and Field team traveled to the 2022 NCAA Division III Indoor Track and Field Championships at Winston-Salem, North Carolina. Senior Michael OBroin competed in the 5,000-meter run and earned himself All-America recognition and second place with a time of 14:16.30, a school record.

Senior Justin Kiefel competed in the long jump and placed 10th with a mark of 7.03 meters. First-year Aleksei Seletskiy ran in the preliminaries of the mile run, placing 19th with a time of 4:20.59.
On day two, two more Tartans earned All-American recognition. Kiefel placed second in triple jump, earning a school record after recording a mark of 14.94 meters. Graduate student Bram Miller also placed second in shot put after recording a mark of 16.85 meters. Overall, the Tartans finished in a tie for sixth overall with 26 points.
The following weekend, the Tartans traveled to Lexington, Virginia to the Washington and Lee Track and Field Carnival for their first outdoor meet of the year. Junior Alex Halkias finished in second place in the 200-meter dash with a time of 21.97, a personal-best. He also finished third in both the 100-meter dash with a time of 10.77 and in long jump with a distance of 6.68 meters. A personal best from graduate student Grant Johnson earned him first in the 400-meter hurdles with a time of 54.62.

Often it is difficult for us to conceptualize how the things around us directly impact us. We produce, use, and consume at rates that are too fast for us to truly understand just how far-reaching the effects of our innovations are. We have to go through each of these issues one at a time to truly understand the scale of everything that's wrong. For this week, let’s take a look at: 
Microplastics
There are few things quite as present in the world as microplastics. It is everywhere. There are 51 trillion microplastics in our sea. It’s in our food and water. It’s in our rain. It’s in the deepest trenches of our oceans and it’s also at the summit of our tallest mountains. Microplastics are, well, really small pieces of plastic, typically less than five micrometers, or around 0.0002 inches. Though we have billions of tons of plastic sitting in landfills, microplastics have also made it into our food chain. Smaller animals, like birds and fish, consume the microplastics, which then make their way up the food chain to us and accumulate as the plastics go up the food chain. 
Microplastics are a mix of hydrogen and carbon polymer strands, and they also contain chemicals like phthalates (known informally as plasticizers) and polybrominated diphenyl ethers. Phthalates are used to make plastic more durable while polybrominated diphenyl ethers are used to reduce the fire risk of the plastic. As a result, plastic is not biodegradable, and they stay in the ecosystem for decades and can stay there for upwards of hundreds of years. Similarly, when eaten, they can stay in the body for a long time, and they continue to build up. For years. 
Microplastics are spread through the use and consumption of plastic, and take two forms. First, there are primary microplastics, which make up between 15-31% of the microplastics found in the ocean. These microplastics are purposefully manufactured, and they’re used in many products that are major parts of our life. It’s in cosmetics and beauty products, fishing nets, microfibers in our clothing, as well as in facial scrubs and toothpaste and much more. The remainder of the microplastics are secondary microplastics. These result from degradation of larger plastic products in the environment, like plastic bottles and plastic bags. These are broken down by environmental factors, such as ocean turbulence and ultraviolet radiation. 
The specific composition of microplastics as well as their large surface areas makes them more prone to adhere to organic pollutants in water as well as to more toxic plasticizers that are likely present in the water. One study estimates that the yearly human adult intake of microplastics is 458,000 microplastic particles for treated tap water and 3,569,000 microplastic particles for bottled water. Additionally, studies have found that microplastics can be spread as aerosols, including clear microplastic particles. These get swept up by wind into the atmosphere, which in turn leads to us breathing in air that has microplastics in it. The measurements of the microplastics in aerosols also has measurement error, severely undercounting the actual amount of microplastics that are in the air.
The result is that microplastics became part of our consumption without us realizing. For example, a meta-analysis (analysis of multiple studies on a specific subject) of microplastic presence in salt for human consumption found that the microplastics were in the majority of the samples that were analyzed. This includes sea salt, lake salt, rock salt, and table salt.
The consequences of microplastic consumption are dire. Microplastics can affect immune responses, cause allergic reactions, affect cell membranes, and even cause oxidative stress that leads to cell and tissue damage. Multiple studies have indicated that microplastic exposure can lead to cell death. It is unclear how many people die as a result of microplastic exposure, but the only thing we know for certain is that it is indeed killing us.

CMU RESEARCH: 
Starfish: You can regrow skin? I can regrow my nervous system!
Humans can regrow some parts of their bodies after injury, but a starfish can regrow its entire body back from a single arm. Scientists like Professor of Life Sciences Veronica Hinman wonder how starfish are able to regenerate in ways that humans cannot. Hinman's lab specifically examined how starfish correctly regenerate their nervous system, which few other animals can do and humans struggle to do. They found that when starfish have injured neurons, they express a gene called sox2 that starts programs that create and differentiate new neurons in similar ways to that of a newly-born starfish. They are looking further into how sox2 becomes activated and how it restarts the developmental neurogenesis program.
Legos, but the pieces are 3D-printed parts of proteins
When it's hard to visualize a concept in your mind, it's nice to be able to refer to a model. Three-dimensional (3D) models can be very handy, but are sometimes expensive for classrooms on a budget. Professor of mechanical engineering Rebecca Taylor and senior Caleigh Goodwin-Schoen are looking into ways biology classrooms can 3D-print models of nanostructures like DNA and proteins that are both structurally sound and affordable. The models, printed with selective laser sintering, illustrate how different parts of the model connect and rotate with respect to each other, and should be able to be printed for less than $100. She also adds fabric dye to the models, making it easy to differentiate between pieces.

COVID-19: CDC changes masks guidelines, recalculating COVID-19 risks
With the COVID-19 pandemic, statistics have gained more mainstream prominence than before. But which of these statistics should be used to judge COVID-19 risk? Previously, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) only used case counts to determine the risk of COVID-19 in every state. But as of Feb. 22, the CDC has decided to incorporate the hospitalization rate in determining risk as well. Reasons cited for this change include increased population immunity, focusing on minimizing serious illness, and a need to reflect healthcare strain. It's also because case counts are no longer as reliable, since individuals are taking at-home tests, the results of which are hard to track.
TECH: Netflix is trying to stop users from sharing their passwords
Technically, Netflix accounts are only supposed to be for "personal use only" and "may not be shared with individuals beyond your household," but who listens? Now, Netflix is testing a new feature in Chile, Costa Rica, and Peru, where users outside of your household using your account must be added with an additional fee, with a maximum of two extra users you can add. This fee, which is about three dollars, costs less than purchasing a separate user account. If successful in the select countries, the feature may be implemented globally, in hopes of gaining more subscribers to invest in more content. Netflix in recent years has also raised its prices from $13.99 to $15.49.
SCIENCE: Russian invasion suspends mission to find life on Mars
After Russia invaded Ukraine, the Russian-European mission to find life on Mars, ExoMars, was suspended by the European Space Agency (ESA). ExoMars was planned as a collaboration between the ESA and Russian agency Roscosmos to launch a Russian lander and European rover, originally slated for launch in 2020, but due to the pandemic, was delayed to 2022 and estimated to touch down on Mars in 2023. However, the ESA condemned Russia's aggression toward Ukraine and "acknowledged the present impossibility of carrying out the ongoing cooperation with Roscosmos," and will be looking for other ways to carry out the mission. 
Roscosmos has had other conflicts with European and American space organizations. It has refused to launch European missions on Russian rockets, halted its supply of rocket engines to the U.S., and its head has feuded with NASA astronauts on Twitter.

“With the current climate and rapid pace of machine learning, it really was only a matter of time,” said Carnegie Mellon statistician and legal scholar Randall DiMaggio when asked about the new critical race theory (CRT) trained AI, “Amy.” “Amy,” the pet name given to AMiRaSyst, which stands for “Adaptive Multiend Recursive System,” is the culmination of over three years of research and 200 million dollars of funding. In essence, Amy is a machine learning model that firmly believes race is a construct, racism goes beyond individual prejudice, and that Tyler Perry is a gratuitous shill. 
“I suppose my first question is how you came up with the name, 'Amy.'”
I take a seat in Dr. DiMaggio’s office, eager to begin picking the brain behind this new engine of equality. Looking around I conclude that I am perhaps out of my depth, every shelf stuffed with a dazzling array of literature. “Neural Nets: A History” leans comfortably against “Audre Lorde: A Herstory.” “Anomaly Detection in Climate Data” sublets shelf room to “Can’t I Have A Chocolate Shake in Peace?: The Power of Sit-Ins.” In an academic era of specialization, DiMaggio has proven himself a Renaissance man at first glance.
“That’s an easy one. As you know, 'Amy' is short for “AMiRaSyst,” which came to me once I realized I had yet to use my statistical knowledge for the betterment of minorities. I asked myself over and over, 'Am I racist?' The shame pushed me to start this program, and to name it AMiRaSyst”
I blink a moment. Was Randall working out of white guilt? I realize I actually missed the fact he was even Caucasian, so fixated was I on his office library and the lilting tones of Alicia Keys coming from his desktop. 
“What’s the main purpose of the Amy? What sort of capabilities does it have? I know AI can be helpful with housing pricing-” 
DiMaggio leaps from his seat to cut me off. 
“Yes! Amy is uniquely purposed to counteract all sorts of housing inequities. She can scan petaflops of real estate metrics, neighborhood shapes, and pricing data. In fact, just the other week, she was able to successfully determine that Lawrenceville gentrification was on a trajectory that would have every non-condemned building form a swastika with a Scotty dog in the center. She swears it was just a statistical fluke, but I got Farnam to pull the plug on that really fast.”
My phone buzzed in the middle of his story. I looked down. YouTube notification. New John Oliver out today. It’s about redlining.
“What about redlining? Can she prevent that?” 
Randall, or “Randy,” as I’ve started calling him in my mind, cools down and sighs. 
“Well, to be honest, (air quotes) 'redlining' as we remember it historically doesn’t really happen anymore. At least, not explicitly. What we have to deal with more now is its political cousin, gerrymandering. In fact, AI experts at Ole Miss just built their own “social AI” that focuses on making gerrymandering harder and harder to detect. His name is Jerry.”
Amy and Jerry. Two peas in a cyberpunk pod. I wonder if they know each other. Can these AI programs fall in love? What would that even look like? Can neo-con automata feel shame? Do woke-bots dream of electric sheep?
“Before I head out, is it too soon to ask if you’re working on any more projects?”
“Yes. We’ve just developed a record-breaking visual analysis software to prevent racial profiling!”
“Name?”
“Regression Using Bi-convolutional Legal Analytics”
“...the other name, please”
“Oh. Sorry. RuBLAc.”
“Half, actually.”

Morewood E-Tower isn’t like other dorm buildings. It doesn’t have a pretty little lobby or a cute lounge to walk through on the way in. Like Resnik and West Wing, E-Tower residents have to share their space with other on-campus services: University Health Services (UHS) and Counseling and Psychology Services (CaPS). As a result, the dormitory doesn’t really have a front door, at least not one it doesn’t share with someone else, whether that be UHS, CaPS, or Morewood Gardens. Residents are discouraged from using the most direct entrance, a small room with two elevators and a staircase that leads to all floors of the building, because it's the only entrance for CaPS patrons. The idea is that reserving that entrance for CaPS patrons preserves their anonymity or patient confidentiality. 
While absolutely necessary, it has been pointed out that restricting this access point is somewhat unfair to the five remaining floors of residents, who enter and exit the building with much greater frequency and during a wider range of hours. Though I do not endorse it, people use this entrance regardless of the rules. The problem occurs when the door is locked because CaPS is closed, like at night and during the weekends (something that is not a problem for ResEd staff, whose ID cards, unlike those of first year residents, work on this door). 
A challenge like this, though, is exactly what Carnegie Mellon students were made for. The admissions process selected us because we are ingenious, creative, and determined, and like it or not, regardless of the safety hazards, E-Tower residents are ready to apply those traits to their daily commute. In a way, the phenomenon that occurs almost daily at E-Tower is a demonstration of the best in us as a student body; residents will wedge the door open with whatever is available, showing both their commitment to efficiency, and their consideration for others who also want to use the door while it’s locked. 
The crux of this piece, and my personal entertainment this year, is a list of items I have seen used to keep the Morewood E-Tower CaPS door open during the later hours. I hope it proves not the irresponsibility of E-Tower residents, but the sheer joy to be found in the smallest places on campus for anyone who is willing to look.
E-Tower Health Center Door Stoppers:
The Mask
In a stroke of sheer ingenuity, someone slipped a black paper mask right in the space where the door’s lock slides into place, stopping it from reaching the other side of the lock. Though this method required some maintenance by door users to keep the mask in the right spot, it was subtle enough to make the door seem closed and locked to anyone who walked past without looking too hard. Also, it was kind of a sign of the times. 7/10
The Cardboard
All I remember is that it was enormous. It was probably very near move-in time, when cardboard boxes were plentiful, and someone ripped one apart and slid it in the door. It was a very large piece of cardboard. It did the job. 5/10
The Door Itself
My absolute favorite. I hope my visual description of this doorstop will do it justice. The ID scanner next to the door must have been a little loose from its backing such that it could be rotated without coming off the door frame. The scanner was rotated about 40 degrees so that its corner intercepted the door before it could reach the end of its journey into the frame. It was poetic. It was ironic. It was just a little bit dangerous. 10/10
The Pebble
Extremely subtle. I’m not sure where the pebble came from, but its placement was so precise, it could only have been done by someone who cared a lot. The pebble took advantage of a tiny divet in the concrete before the door’s threshold and caught the bottom of the door by the very skin of its teeth. Surprising and endearing. 8/10
Note: I was informed that there was also a larger rock involved in this list at some point during the year, but the pebble was simply so superior and the rock so uncouth and questionable (where did it even come from?), that I felt that it was unnecessary to include in this list. 
The Screw
Similar to the Pebble/Rock situation in its mystery and size, the screw reliably did the job it was tasked with, with no pomp or circumstance. 3/10
The Ice
Another sign of the times, but with a concerning lack of foresight. Though all the aforementioned stops were temporary, this one was the most. It was never meant to last, especially with the radiators running in the entrance. I almost pitied it, a medium-sized chunk of snow drafted for no apparent reason from amongst its brothers, unwillingly sacrificing itself to the pressure of the door and the heat of the indoor human world. 6/10
The Bottles
Self-explanatory and vaguely squished, the parade of bottles that included those having previously held water, Sprite, and mango smoothie, served time as grotesque doorstops, a kind of harbinger to the 3 a.m. returner. Hopefully they got recycled. 5/10
The Chair
Last but most certainly not least: the Chair. The Chair was a month-long saga in which one brave resident brought a dorm desk chair all the way down from their room and sacrificed it for the good of all. At first it was the whole thing, but as time passed, screws were removed and wood was splintered apart, resulting in smaller and smaller bits of wood remaining. It was hard to watch, but the effort put in by the Chair and its owner was evident to anyone who could identify the mangled pieces as former legs. 9/10
At the very summit of this list, and far too great to be mentioned as part of it, is a concept only E-Tower residents might recognize: the fraction of an inch by which the door stays open when the lock has stopped working, which happens from time to time. It’s something that can only be seen with the finely-trained eye, the eye that searches the door from feet away on a cold, dark night, just hoping for, almost hallucinating, that single centimeter of an edge on the door. For me, it’s a hallmark of my acclimation to residential life at Carnegie Mellon, and Carnegie Mellon’s wholehearted, arms-wide-open acceptance of me.

Name, pronouns, what kind of art do you do?
My name is Mila Fejzo, my pronouns are they/them, and I am mostly an oil painter, but have recently been experimenting with digital and physical sculpture, mold-making, digital imaging, makeup, drawing, illustration and poetry.
Where are you from? Geographically & emotionally?
Before I came to Pittsburgh for college, I lived in L.A. my whole life. 
How did you begin your artistic journey? How old were you?
I wasn't interested in art growing up, until I had one specific teacher in seventh grade who changed my life. I ended up working with her for six years. She helped me grow as an artist, but also as a person. She pushed me a lot conceptually rather than just focusing on building techniques, which meant that I developed an artistic voice quite early on. This later led me to choose CMU's art program for college because it focuses on work with a lot of conceptual weight. 
What is a defining work of art that set you on your current journey?
Vanity (2018) by George Rouy is a piece that has been very influential to my most recent paintings. The way he renders his figures, plays with transparency, and builds color palettes are all inspiring to my current work, as I step away from more realistic rendering. 
What does your personal artistic process look like?
I first start with a general concept I am going to explore in my work, and try to decide what medium(s) would work best to enhance the meaning of the piece. From there, I sketch out potential compositions. Then I look at my document of my favorite current-working artists and saved Instagram posts of art to find color palettes, patterns, textures, techniques, etc., that I want to pull from. I put a bunch of references of artwork into a folder on my phone, and I then draw a secondary sketch that includes color, and notations of patterns and textures. This sketch often doesn't look fully realized to the viewer, but the notes allow me to envision the whole piece in my head. I then start on the piece, allowing for a lot of adaptation as I go. If certain things aren't working, I may stray really far from the references I chose, sometimes just playing with it myself, and other times, going back again to find different references. 
What are some projects you are working on right now that you are proud of and excited about?
I am working with School of Design faculty Brian Russman right now to turn my hobby of experimental makeup into more of an art practice. I am exploring themes of gender, including gender stereotypes, top surgery, body dysphoria, etc. I just finished a photo series on the discomfort I feel when presenting as hyperfeminine. I plan on making a complimentary photo series, that explores the confidence and gender euphoria that comes with dressing in a more androgynous way. 
What’s the best advice you’ve ever been given?
The best artistic advice I've ever been given was to use modeling paste. I've been obsessed with it ever since [Andrew W. Mellon Professor of Art] Susanne Slavick told our painting class about it. It allows you to get thickly textured pieces without spending hundreds of dollars on paint. It also has an interesting quality to it, where if you decided to let it show on the painting and not paint over it, it appears to have some translucency to it despite actually being opaque. I highly recommend working with modeling paste if you are a painter looking to explore texture in your work!
How does your community inspire you?
CMU is a very supportive environment. Artists here really want everyone to learn and grow. Critiques generally feel uplifting, but constructive. 
What made you decide to pursue your art at Carnegie Mellon?
CMU has a very special art program in my opinion. One, its facilities are amazing, and allows for art classes in numerous mediums. The program itself is also very interdisciplinary, and I knew it would get me to expand my art practice from solely an oil painter to a well-rounded artist working in many mediums. I even took a mold-making class this semester, which is a medium I never even thought about trying in high school. Most importantly, as I said above, CMU pushes our artists conceptually. In the transdisciplinary research studios, we can make work out of any medium, surrounding a prompt. This allows us to learn which mediums are used to best express certain ideas, as well as gears us towards a conceptual approach to our work rather than simply a technical one. 
What’s the best part of being an artist right here (CMU, Pittsburgh, the world), and right now?
I make art mostly for myself, and not necessarily for a viewer. Creating is an essential part of maintaining my mental health, and so studying art at CMU, and getting positive feedback in critiques is really rewarding. However, I think that the best part about being an artist for me is when my art informs or teaches someone something. I work a lot with topics of mental health, as well as gender identity, and it is always validating when someone reaches out to me to say that they relate to my work, or have gained insight from it.

Welcome back, Tartinos and Tartinas, we've got a whale of a PILLBOX issue in honor of everyone going BACK TO SCHOOL! Whether you loved your break or you hated it, we hope PILLBOX Issue #5 will make your day a little better. We've got some fine articles here for you. 
Welcoming us back to campus is humorous coverage of the community-wide challenge of keeping the Morewood E-Tower door to CAPs open (see B4-B5, "Doorstop Review"). From sticks to stones to hunks of ice, all solutions have been tried, and are cataloged here with fervor. There's a good bit of comedy throughout this issue to ease you back into school spirit, with two gut-busting satire pieces from Zivan Vasquez. If you want to know more about Ukraine, or whether it is finally time to automate critical race theory, those two articles are for you.  
This week is not just about laughts, however. We're lucky enough to be able to feature plenty of serious criticism, with two film reviews on pages B4-5 and B9. For all of our dedicated music-heads, we've got a great articles about a great bunch of albums by new contributor Aidan Winn, and a seasonal depression-themed playlist music recommendations (B18). We're also thrilled to feature an interview with long-time Pillbox contributor Mila Fejzo about their work and artistic process. In our comics section, you can find another masterpiece from Hannibal Gerald, this time about everyone's least favorite type of doctor, dentists! Last but not least, we're lucky to be able to share an original poem by local poet Rowan Dunlop, "Live from the Warzone" (B13). 
Sit back, relax, and enjoy this week's wonderful little selection of articles and interviews to ease your post-spring break and daylights-savings induced hangover. Take a read - you won't regret it.

Today I watched "Oldboy," an American remake of Park Chan-wook’s 2003 movie of the same name, directed by Spike Lee and released in 2013. While I am not very good at judging movies on any scale other than a spectrum from “I had a good time watching this” to “I had a bad time watching this,” I am at least literate enough to directly compare similar movies to one another. Enter "Oldboy" (2003). The original is so good. I hate reading subtitles on movies, but I had such a good time with this one. It’s dynamic, the plot is unexpected, the fight scenes are so good, I had a GREAT time watching this movie. 
I had heard some criticisms of the American version in the past, but I was like, “It’ll be fine, probably just the film bros being snobs or something,” and settled in to watch Lee’s version. Let me tell you, it sure was a movie. Way early on (knowing how the plot is supposed to go), I realized that they definitely changed things. By including a few small details, they really managed to make the plot way more weird and complicated than it ever needed to be. It wasn’t terrible, I’ve definitely seen many, many worse movies, but "Oldboy" (2013) was just all around disappointing when compared to its predecessor. Josh Brolin and Elizabeth Olsen were pretty good in the lead roles, but the fight scenes were less engaging, the villain was less villainous, the special effects were worse despite 10 years of advancement, and the tone was just… off somehow. As a final imperfect little bow on this imperfect little gift of a remake, the ending was WAY less satisfying than the original’s. Overall, I think I would have enjoyed this movie more if I hadn’t seen the original yet. 
Final rankings for "Oldboy" (2013):
Did I have a good time watching this movie? Yeah. I’d give it like a 6/10.
Do I recommend this movie? Yes! But only if you haven’t seen the original.

On the evening of Feb. 28, psychology professor Anna Fisher logged out of Zoom and broke down. The invasion of her birth country by the country that raised her was devastating enough. But the straw that broke the camel’s back was an event hosted by Carnegie Mellon’s Institute for Politics and Strategy (IPS).
“On the Brink: A Panel Discussion on Russia and Ukraine” was presented by four faculty members who shared their areas of expertise. Yet, for Fisher, something was missing. 
“The forum that included ‘Ukraine’ in its name did not include a panelist with expertise in Ukraine,” said Fisher in an interview with The Tartan. She was deeply upset by the lack of representation of a country that was ostensibly the central focus of the event. 
Fisher, who is an associate professor of Psychology at Carnegie Mellon, was born in Ukraine and raised in Russia. Since war began between the two countries on Thursday, Feb. 24, she has been searching for spaces in which she can find solidarity. 
The panel was scheduled for 5 p.m. but began eight minutes late due to unexpectedly high attendance. At 5:48 p.m., Fisher submitted a message to Q&A, which could only be seen by hosts. In screenshots provided to The Tartan, Fisher commented: “So far the Ukrainian perspective is sorely missing from the panel.” No response. At 6:04 p.m., she tried again: “HOW can we have this forum on Ukraine and Russia with ONLY the Russian perspective represented in the panel?” No response.
At 6:07 p.m., Fisher asked: “Can the first speaker address why Crimea being gifted to Ukraine in the 1950s is relevant, but it is not relevant to mention that in 1994 Ukraine gave up nuclear weapons in exchange [for] guarantees signed by Russia, the U.S., and the U.K. to respect the integrity of its border including Crimea?” Again, no response. 
“We each had a very brief time to speak, which made it impossible to answer all the excellent questions that had been placed in the chat,” explained Paul Mellon Distinguished Professor of History Wendy Goldman, who presented her expertise as a Russian historian at Monday’s panel. Goldman told The Tartan that while planning the event, she and her colleagues decided to speak about their own specialties, to provide students with “a scholarly point of view.”
Professor Andreea Ritivoi, who is the head of the English Department, moderated Monday’s event. “The panel was originally planned well in advance of the current situation in the Ukraine,” Ritivoi wrote in an email to The Tartan. “We originally considered drawing upon the expertise of the Institute for Politics and Strategy’s Military Fellows but given sensitivities surrounding active-duty members of the military commenting on an active conflict, this option did not move forward.”
This narrowed the scope of possible perspectives, given the niche nature of the war. For Global Studies Director Emanuela Grama, an expert of 20th century Central and Eastern European history, that meant speaking about an especially specific subject: Romania. In an email to the event’s organizers, Grama wrote: “I will defer to the expertise of other scholars on the panel regarding the Ukrainian-Russian relations, but I'd be glad to share my knowledge about how the current crisis has been viewed and reported on in the neighboring countries — and more specifically, Romania.”
During his portion of the panel, Assistant Teaching Professor of Russian Studies David Parker debunked Russian President Vladimir Putin’s claims of denazification as a basis for invasion. In an email to The Tartan, he outlined his presentation, which provided “background on the abuse of the ‘neo-Nazi’ label and Putin's leveraging of this history as [baseless] motivation for the execution of this horrible war.” 
The fourth panelist, IPS assistant Professor Daniel Silverman, could not be reached for comment.
While Fisher did not blame the panelists and values academic freedom, she wishes the university had included an expert on Ukraine. Fisher personally disagreed with many of the points made during the event. Yet, after growing up in Russia, a country with a history of strict media censorship, she appreciates the academic freedom intrinsic to American higher education. 
In an email to The Tartan, Grama acknowledged a mistake she made while presenting. “When I briefly mentioned the missiles NATO moved from Turkey to Romania, I said ‘nuclear missiles.’ That is not accurate — the slide of my presentation did mention ballistic missiles on Romania's territory, but I did not say that, and that was a significant mistake,” she wrote. “There are no nuclear missiles on Romania's territory.”
Another source of disconnect from the panel stemmed from its focus on the North Atlantic Treaty Organization’s (NATO) exacerbation of tensions between Ukraine and Russia. But Ukraine, as a sovereign state, can have aspirations to join alliances of its own choosing. 
Grama expressed her hope that the informational shortcomings would be addressed if the panel’s recording was made public to the Carnegie Mellon community.
When a student mentioned to Fisher that another professor was hosting a small event on the evening of Feb. 24, Fisher was eager to join. “I wanted to be with other people who cared,” she explained. 
Fisher gathered around the computer screen with her husband and two daughters that night. They watched, listened, and felt the loneliness slip away for an hour-and-a-half as Grama led an emergency teach-in. 
Immediately after learning that Russian forces had attacked Ukraine, Grama began pulling a presentation together. In an interview with The Tartan prior to the IPS panel, Grama explained that she wanted to introduce her students to the context of the conflict and provide a space for questions.
For Fisher, this was a welcome reprieve from the mayhem of the past few hours. After the session, she sent a thank-you to Grama and drafted an email to her students. Fisher hoped “to host a forum — not for teaching,” she explained, but rather as a space for “people who just want to be together and grieve.” 
Fisher’s informal forum was planned for March 2, but after watching Monday’s panel, she understood that a shift in tone was necessary. In addition to creating a discussion-based space, Fisher unpacked the elements of the previous night’s panel that she found most problematic. “We have many people who left this forum with a lopsided understanding of this crisis,” she explained, necessitating a direct response by university leadership. Fisher emphasized that to support Ukraine, the Carnegie Mellon community must first recognize its legitimacy. 
Ritivoi told The Tartan about plans for a “second panel discussion to continue the conversation about … the crisis in Ukraine. This will include experts on Ukraine’s history, politics, and culture.”
“I think that the Dietrich College has the responsibility to take corrective action,” Fisher wrote in a follow-up email to The Tartan. “Whether or not another forum happens, I think every person who registered for Monday’s event should receive an email with an explanation for why the event was problematic (despite some excellent presentations) and links to resources that speak to [Ukrainian expertise].”

For years, Carnegie Mellon University lacked uniform practices and minimum standards in many aspects of doctoral students’ experiences. The Graduate Student Assembly (GSA) at Carnegie Mellon identified in their 2015-2025 Strategic Plan that key areas in graduate student experience are health and wellbeing, financial security, sense of community, and family support. Two years ago, the GSA and Carnegie Mellon’s leadership worked together to establish a minimum of 50 percent of individual premium costs paid by the university for all eligible doctoral students. The consistent, minimum health care support was the first phase in an effort to implement the aforementioned minimum standards. On Wednesday, March 16, Provost Jim Garrett, in an email addressed to doctoral students and co-signed by Vice President of Student Affairs Gina Casalegno and President of the Graduate Student Assembly Divyansh Kaushik, announced an update that will “advance holistic support of the doctoral student experience at CMU.”
In an email interview with The Tartan, GSA President Divyansh Kaushik explained the key changes announced in the update by Provost Garrett: “Starting Fall 2022, qualifying Ph.D. students will receive a minimum stipend of $2,250 per month depending on the term of their program. They will also receive full coverage for their health insurance premiums, and a minimum of 10 days of time away from their program in addition to the university holidays.” Qualifying doctoral students are defined as having full-time enrollment in a Carnegie Mellon doctoral program, making satisfactory progress toward their degree in line with program policy, and are stipend-supported and not receiving full external support from another source.
“In several departments, ​​current compensation isn’t enough to reasonably live on,” said Kaushik. “And we wanted to guarantee a level of compensation that didn’t force people to live in poverty in order to pursue doctoral study at CMU.” He said that he first discussed establishing minimum stipends with Provost Garret in summer of 2021. He then worked with Vice Provost for Education Amy Burkert who presented a straw proposal to a group of university administrators and the GSA Executive Committee at the Provost’s Graduate Advisory Board meeting in August. The initial proposal included benefits for Ph.D. students like minimum stipends, full health insurance coverage, vacation policy, parental leave, ability to attend at least one conference during their Ph.D., and financial support to allow students to change an advisor for any reason without worrying about loss of funding. “Since then, we have worked to identify the nitty gritty details and identify what we can get done now and what would require more time in the implementation phase,” he explained.
Many of the above initiatives are well outlined in GSA’s 2015-2025 Strategic Plan, Kaushik pointed out, which was a collaborative document developed after months of campus-wide discussions with graduate students, faculty, staff, and administrators. “As former GSA President Surya Aggarwal highlighted in our Strategic Plan document, ‘With the recent decline of public confidence in higher education, the challenges facing graduate education have never been higher. And it is incumbent on us, and institutions like Carnegie Mellon, to produce well-rounded leaders who can change that perception,’” he said.
Taking the idea and turning it into policy was challenging for Kaushik and everyone involved as they got into the depths of implementation and logistics. The idea of looking at graduate education holistically began long ago, he said, and the first phase went into effect in 2019. He believes that they could have gotten Phase Two done sooner as well without pandemic disruptions. He also disclosed, without going into specific details, that “certain colleges had genuine implementation concerns stemming from budget constraints that had to be addressed.” He emphasized that while the process was frustrating sometimes, he’s proud that they were able to find a way to address these issues collaboratively. “I could not have asked for better partners in this than Provost Jim Garrett, Dean of Students Gina Casalegno, Vice Provost for Education Amy Burkert, and so many others who contributed to the collaborative process,” he said, echoing Provost Garrett’s description of the collaboration between the GSA and Carnegie Mellon’s leadership as a “genuine partnership.”
On March 14, two days before the updates were announced, posters were put up across the campus asking “Do Grad Students Deserve Unlivable Low Wages?”, “Is Our Work Worth 7.5% Less Than Last Year?”, and “Is Some Grad Work Worth 22k Less Than Others?” and accompanying graphics depicting related statistics. A Twitter account called “CMU Grad Students Deserve Fair Pay” started tweeting the posters, which contained a QR code linked to a survey which asked respondents to share how CMU’s “unfair, poverty wages” impacted them. Kaushik clarified that although he agrees that Carnegie Mellon should pay its graduate students better, the GSA was not responsible for the posters.
As part of the update on establishing minimum stipends seemed to address some of the concerns of the poster-and-survey campaign, the Tartan reached out to the group of students behind the campaign, who chose to remain anonymous and identified themselves as “members of the Carnegie Mellon graduate student community advocating for fair pay and dignified working conditions.” They revealed that the group had come together through ties with a few individuals in the School of Computer Science, and that after struggling with loneliness and isolation during the pandemic, they started having candid conversations around the systemic issues that were affecting their experience: power imbalances in their advising relationships, a lack of work/life balance, financial insecurity, medical care that didn’t cover our basic needs. They began speaking with GSA members and Carnegie Mellon alumni who previously held leadership roles to gather data, and did casual walkthroughs to meet graduate students from other departments to understand the similarities and differences in their experiences.
Though the group discussed many structural challenges, they said that one issue that clearly cut across departments and individual grad experiences was financial insecurity. “Coming on the heels of CMU’s announcement of our endowment growing from $2.1 billion to $3.1 billion in a pandemic year, we are outraged that our peers in Drama and Design are paid below the poverty line — or not at all,” they said in an interview with The Tartan. “CMU administration often argues that it would be impossible to achieve pay parity across departments because of their wildly different funding structures (grants, teaching stipends, etc.). Even so, there is little justification for not providing a living wage, or accounting for yearly inflation.”
Over the past few days in which the group collected responses from students via surveys, they said they heard that many students are unable to afford basic necessities, choosing between groceries and medical copays, or putting off important surgeries. “One student shared that they are unable to move away from a structurally unsound housing situation because they cannot afford higher rent,” they revealed. Other respondents cited their relatively privileged positions (no dependents, dual income from working partner, or parental support) as the only reasons they are able to participate in their programs. The group pointed out that this has serious implications for Carnegie Mellon’s Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion efforts.
The group agreed that the update instituting minimum stipends and full individual health insurance premium coverage, among other initiatives, is a great step forward and appreciated the hard work that the GSA Executive Committee put in to make it happen. However, they pointed out that for many Ph.D. students, especially those with family obligations, chronic illness with large out of pocket expenses, among other issues, being paid the minimum stipend does not come close to financial stability. As the cost of rent, gas, and food in Pittsburgh continues to rise, students are increasingly struggling to afford their graduate experience. In the face of big problems, this update feels like a small concession.
“Even students with 12-month funding would make $27,000 pre-tax on the minimum stipend, when CMU’s own estimate claims the cost of living in Pittsburgh is about $24,658 a year (excluding health insurance),” they said. “And with inflation at more than 7% and increasing, this one-time change is only going to be less helpful over time.”
The group stated that most graduate students, including most departmental GSA representatives, were not aware of or able to provide input on the details of this plan as it was negotiated with Carnegie Mellon administration. The group also said that although they had not reviewed GSA communications (besides official emails) or meeting notes, they talked to GSA representatives who heard changes were coming, but did not know details until they were released to everyone. They revealed that they had reached out to a GSA executive member a while ago, who was unable to publicly share their goals and plans that they were negotiating with Carnegie Mellon administration. “We don’t fault the GSA exec for this, but one of our goals is to increase transparency for these kinds of negotiations, by creating a space for graduate students to discuss their concerns and contribute to a broader campaign for change,” they clarified. “If this important change can come from the hard work of a few graduate students in GSA exec negotiating with CMU administration, what kind of systemic improvements could we accomplish as a large, engaged, inter-departmental group discussing our needs publicly?”
Kaushik said that specific details, such as the amount of stipend and percentage of health insurance coverage, were not shared until they were sufficiently confident that those numbers would hold. “We wanted to make sure we were on solid ground before announcing any specifics,” he explained. However, he said that GSA representatives were fully in the loop on the fact that the Executive Committee was negotiating minimum stipends and health insurance coverage with the administration and that progress on these negotiations was shared at every GSA general body meeting starting from December 2021. Besides the updates from the GSA, President Jahanian and Vice Provost Burkert shared some details in December, and again Vice Provost Burkert shared additional progress details in a GSA meeting in March. He added that the weekly GSA executive meeting minutes, which are publicly available, also contained updates on the negotiations. Revealing that students had reached out with ideas when GSA representatives shared with their constituents that they were working on the update, he said that they incorporated several of those ideas into their plan.
The group had also pointed out that the update doesn’t cover masters students, who make up a large portion of Carnegie Mellon’s graduate student body. When asked if there any plans in the near future or in motion right now to improve graduate student wages for students in master’s programs, Kaushik revealed that a working group that is looking at the issue with representatives from the graduate and undergraduate student body, GSA, Undergraduate Senate, university administration, colleges and departments, among others.
The group underscored that even if they use different methods than the GSA, they share the same goals: fair pay and dignified working conditions for all graduate students. “Having our group and GSA working on the same problem from different angles is good for everyone — it makes it clear to the university that this is an important issue for graduate students,” they emphasized.
They also brought up that the university continually highlights the excellent research, creative work, and teaching that graduate students do, while many graduate students sacrifice their future financial stability to come here. “It is also important to realize that for many Ph.D. students, a Ph.D. is effectively our first job, often held for five years or more, where folks might otherwise be saving for their future,” said the group. “We should be compensated beyond the minimum cost of living and given benefits (ex. parental leave, medical leave, dental insurance, retirement contributions) to ensure that graduate students can be healthy and adequately prepared for the future financially.”
In the email announcement, Garrett also wrote that the “university academic and administrative leadership, college representatives and GSA will continue to review proposals that would expand the current student maternity accommodation program to include parental leave options and establish an academic ombudsperson to serve as a resource for all students.”
Kaushik also emphasized that they were not just looking at stipends here, and that it is crucial to recognize that the update is a huge and expensive step forward. He believes that the university is on a great trajectory and should not stop here, saying, “We should look at what else our peers are offering, including everything we had in the initial proposal and then vision, dental, and dependent [health] care as well.” 
“It’s not something that changes overnight, and I completely recognize that,” explained Kaushik. “But continuous improvement is something we are always aspiring to on behalf of our students. And the way to do this, in my view, is to work collaboratively to address the barriers that stand in the way.” From his interactions with the Provost and others in administration, Kaushik believes that “everybody wants to get there.” However, he said that having been deep into the weeds of implementation and budgets recently, he also recognizes that it is not an easy task within the constraints of the university’s finances, and hopes that, “we continue to work together to find a way around the hurdles that stand in our way and make CMU a better place for all.”

Last semester, one Chartwells meal supplied three disposable utensils. Containers were to be unceremoniously dumped in the trash, along with the salt and pepper packets, emptied bag of chips, and other meal-related plastics. Those days may soon be over. 
Chartwells dining locations across campus are introducing compostable alternatives to their traditional disposables. In November, Carnegie Mellon’s dining service introduced a new position: Sustainability Coordinator. The post was filled by Kathleen Humphreys, who hopes to usher in a zero waste era on campus. One of the first steps is introducing compost.
In an email to The Tartan, Humphreys explained that Chartwells had planned the initiative prior to the pandemic, but the campus shut-down put the project on pause. “Once I joined the team,” Humphreys wrote, “Chartwells and the University felt that it was a good time to begin this transition back to compostable items.”
Deborah Steinberg, who serves as the Sustainability Manager at Facilities Management and Campus Services (FMCS), expects that one million pounds of CMU waste will be converted into compost for academic year (AY) 2021-2022. But this is just the beginning of a larger plan for a green campus.
“While composting is a great solution to single use plastics, going zero waste is typically a more sustainable option, since there will always be human error landing these items in the landfill,” Humphrey wrote. This part of Chartwells’ sustainability plan has been piloted in Schatz, which is introducing silverware and cloth napkins. Humphreys expects similar initiatives to launch across other campus dining locations, although Chartwells has not creates a definitive timeline for this process. 
Chartwells is not the only group on campus focusing on sustainability. Carnegie Mellon is one of 80 undergraduate institutions participating in Campus Race to Zero Waste (CR2ZW). The competition, which runs from January 31 to March 26, challenges campuses to reduce their net waste. University of Alabama Recycling currently ranks highest, responsible for diverting almost 90 percent of its waste. Carnegie Mellon is ranked 44th, with a net diversion of 31 percent. 
The CR2W website maintained that no material prizes are awarded to winners, because raising awareness supersedes the competition component. Instead, “participants compete for the ‘glory’ of winning and knowing they are making a difference.” They receive much-coveted digital badges for taking part in the challenge, as do category winners. 
Carnegie Mellon currently ranks ninth in the Cans and Bottles category, 24th in Food Organics, and 55th in the Per-Capita Classic. Final results will be released in April. 
Paper, plastic, aluminum, cardboard, and glass recycling on campus have all steadily decreased since AY2014-2015, according to data from Environment at CMU. The diversion rate, however, has grown over the same period. Around 30 percent of Carnegie Mellon’s municipal solid waste was recycled in AY2018-19 (pre-pandemic). 
The Association for the Advancement of Sustainability in Higher Education named Carnegie Mellon among its 64 gold recipients in the Sustainability Tracking, Assessment, and Rating System. Platinum, which was awarded to 12 institutions including ASU, Cornell, and Berkley, preceded gold. The Princeton Review’s Top 50 Green Colleges list does not include Carnegie Mellon.
Humphreys is pushing for sustainability initiatives on campus to gain purchase within the student body. Marketing recent changes is one the greatest difficulties Chartwells’ sustainability team has experienced. Humphreys pointed to “the need for marketing and education,” because many of the alternatives “look and feel like plastic, so students aren’t aware that they’re compostable.”

On Feb. 25, the Center for Disease Control (CDC) — for the second time — told Americans they could take off their masks. Nearly a month later, the country is hurtling, much like it did last summer, towards a post-COVID normal.
Yet this doesn’t feel the same as last time around. On May 13, 2021, the COVID mask guidance was scrapped — to huge fanfare. President Joe Biden gave a victory speech in the Rose Garden, and within hours, states across the country had eliminated restrictions that their citizens had endured for 14 months. Going into proms and graduations, and the only-sort-of-jokingly named “hot vax summer,” COVID seemed to be over. Perhaps we were naïve then, or perhaps we’re just jaded now.
Because this time, after a wave of the Delta variant prompted people to put masks back on and covered students’ faces in cloth just in time for the new school year, and after the Omicron variant seemingly infected everyone and their mother, the government telling Americans that they didn’t have to mask up anymore didn’t even make the front page of the New York Times. Nobody is proclaiming that the pandemic is over in the U.S. — even as life everywhere, including universities, is increasingly going back to normal.
That includes Carnegie Mellon. As of March 28 — next Monday — masks will be optional on campus. At least to me, this seems like a rational decision.
First, COVID-19 case rates are plummeting, both on campus and in the broader community. Nationally, cases are lower than they have been at any point since the brief respite from the pandemic that we enjoyed last summer, and Allegheny County’s hospitals have plenty of breathing room. Carnegie Mellon’s cases are higher, per capita, than the broader community, but only barely; according to the university’s dashboard, our campus had just 16 cases in the week of March 1 to March 7. Despite the stagnant masking policies, in a given interaction, the risk that someone is infected with COVID is now about 30 times lower than it was two months ago, an astonishing difference.
Second, people can protect themselves from COVID if they want to, without a community effort. In the beginning of the pandemic, stopping the spread of COVID-19 required all hands on deck; even a few short months ago, the old axiom that “my mask protects you and your mask protects me” was very much true. Surgical masks were made widely available around campus, but if someone was wearing one in a crowd of unmasked people, they didn’t have very much protection. In order to avoid getting infected, we all relied on each other. But that’s no longer the case. For whatever reason, it took Americans 21 months to adopt high-quality face coverings, but when we came back to school in the midst of the Omicron surge, N95 and KN95 masks had largely replaced the cloth masks we’d been accustomed to wearing before. These masks protect the wearer very well. A study from Tokyo in December found that, against the Omicron variant, N95 masks had 79 to 90 percent effectiveness in protecting the wearer, regardless of whether others around them were masked.
Third and finally, COVID has been largely defanged. Without downplaying the high death tolls still plaguing the unvaccinated population, someone up-to-date on COVID vaccinations is highly unlikely to die — up to 93% less likely than an unvaccinated individual. Just last week, the United Kingdom announced that the infection fatality rate (a measure of the lethality of a virus) from COVID has dropped below that of the flu, something that would have seemed unthinkable a year ago. This is from a combination of vaccines, boosters, increased immunity, and the less-lethal nature of the Omicron variant. The new data shows that for those over 80, the most vulnerable, COVID now has a death rate of around 1 in 200 (0.9 times that of the flu), while for those age 20, the death rate is now 1 in 250,000, one-tenth that of seasonal flu.
All of these factors combine to make mask-wearing far less important than it used to be, and make removing the mask mandate a wholly reasonable choice. Yet, people need the space to make their own decisions. Many people will choose to keep wearing masks, and they should have the freedom to make that decision — not only from university policy, but from peers, too. Likewise, many people will choose to take them off, and they, too, should be allowed to make that decision for themselves without judgment. (For obvious reasons, those who have COVID symptoms or were recently exposed should keep their mask on.) If cases stay low, there is nothing wrong with campus being half-masked and half-not, simply based on people’s personal risk tolerances.
It is worth noting that the pandemic is not over, and this period of back-to-normal bliss could well end up being short-lived. European nations are seeing cases rise because of a new subvariant of the virus, and while we all hope that our country has built up enough immunity that hospitalizations and deaths don’t increase again, it’s impossible to know for sure. But, even though the specter of having to mask again remains on the horizon, for now, we can take them off, safely, and enjoy the fresh air. All of our collective hard work over the past two years has gotten us to this point, and now we can relish in it.

Over winter break, I got back into reading after a long slump. One of the many books I picked up was “The House in the Cerulean Sea” by T. J. Klune. Though the book is just short of 400 pages, I finished the novel in less than 24 hours — needless to say, I quite enjoyed the book and it easily earned five stars from me on Goodreads. However, as I scrolled through other reviews, I stumbled upon an intriguing one-star review.
“The House in the Cerulean Sea” is a fantasy novel set in a world where people can be born with unique magical traits, and when those children are unwanted or abandoned, they are sent to orphanages or schools where they are monitored. The story follows Linus Baker, a Case Worker for the Department in Charge of Magical Youth (DICOMY), who is assigned to a classified orphanage that is home to six children with unusual and dangerous backgrounds. He travels there to find the children are more than their files say they are, and (spoiler alert) ends up quitting his job at DICOMY to help run the orphanage after he falls in love with the man in charge.
The reviewer notes the similarities of Klune’s schools and orphanages to those that were set up in Canada for indigenous children who were taken from their families and placed into government-sanctioned facilities. While I wasn’t necessarily aware of specifics regarding these residential schools in Canada, I have seen some recent headlines regarding them. Upon reading this review, the connections were pretty clear. But, does the inspiration Klune took from the tragedy make “The House in the Cerulean Sea” a bad book?
If Klune merely took inspiration from the “cultural genocide” of Canadian indigenous peoples and based his novel on those ideas, I would be inclined to say no, many books draw from the unfortunate circumstances of those throughout history. While it is a tragedy what happened to all those who were victims of residential schools, the story removed from historical context is solid. 
However, I would draw the line based on some of Klune’s remarks surrounding his inspiration for the novel: “I didn’t want to co-opt, you know, a history that wasn’t mine. I’m a cis white dude, so I can’t ever really go through something like what those children had to go through. So I sat down and I was like, I’m just going to write this as a fantasy.” This is the wrong approach to taking inspiration from a historical tragedy; cultural genocide isn’t just something you can decide to write as a fantasy.
But still, I can’t find it in me to think of “The House in the Cerulean Sea” as a bad book; rather, I more so just lost interest in Klune as an author. His perspective wasn’t that he just took inspiration from the event, but rather tried to write from a fantasy perspective. I think I can be almost positive that no caseworker visited a Canadian residential school and found themself thinking that the children were thriving as Baker did in the story. Klune’s intentions did nothing short of sugarcoating and romanticizing a tragedy.
On the same note, there is a good way to take tragedy and turn it into a solid novel without trying to romanticize it. For instance, Roald Dahl did an excellent job with characters who started in tragic circumstances without sugarcoating their circumstances — Charlie began impoverished in “Charlie and the Chocolate Factory,” Matilda was abused and bullied in “Matilda,” and Sophia has been orphaned in “The BFG.” All these books use personal tragedies to create interesting and engaging stories without trying to sugarcoat the problems that many have gone through.
While a lot of fantasy novels are based on historical events, Klune’s intentions are troubling at best, and he is not the only author who has attempted to rewrite a tragedy into a fantasy that ends with everyone smiling. Let’s face it: there were almost certainly no smiles on the faces of all the children who were taken from their parents. Solid stories should have solid intentions, and “The House in the Cerulean Sea” is a great example of an author profiting off the trauma and violence faced by marginalized groups which they never experienced.

On Oct. 23, 2016, the inimitable Jack Chick died. The unassuming underground cartoonist was 92 years old. In his passing, he left the legacy of the “Chick Tract,” the most controversial and the most-published comic books of all time. These tracts (short religious pamphlets) have slowly begun to fade into obscurity, with the modern Zoomers’ knowledge of them most likely being the “They hated Jesus because He told them the truth” meme. A look at Google trends shows that searches for both Jack Chick and Chick Tracts have steadily diminished since 2004, when Google started collecting its data, with a brief spike on the day of Chick’s death. What were these Chick Tracts? Who was Jack Chick? And who killed Jack Chick?
What is a Chick Tract? A Chick Tract is a propaganda vehicle dedicated solely towards aligning your views with those of Jack Chick and accepting Jesus into your heart. A Chick Tract is homophobic, anti-Catholic, anti-Muslim, antisemetic, and much more. A Chick Tract has very few formats. The primary one consists of a small pamphlet style book with a very simple morality tale, as well as Bible quotes sourcing practically every statement any moral character makes. In these tales, there will be an immoral character (whose immorality can range from being a literal murderer to a generic teenager) and some moral do-gooder. This could be a good Samaritan or, in the case of “This Was Your Life,” one of Chick’s most notorious works, a literal angel. The wrongdoer learns of their evil with well placed Bible quotes, accepts Jesus into their heart, and avoids the eternal fire and brimstone. Sometimes you can have someone else, a non-repenting sinner. They are the bad guy (who Chick considers “broken”), and go to hell forever.
Who was Jack Chick? Well, that’s complicated. Biographically, he’s a pretty accomplished recluse. Born in 1924, it seems that throughout his younger years he was much different than what he is notorious for today. Chick claimed that he was not religious throughout high school, though he did do the drama club, and went to college for drama, so his artistic proclivities seem to have already been there. Chick then joined the army, where he served in the Pacific Theater for three years during World War II, which inspired him to later have his tracts translated into many languages (145 languages and dialects so far, according to Chick Publications). He was a late convert to Christianity, having been non-religious until he met his wife. He began his comic career in the early 1950s and began self-publishing his evangelical work in 1960 with “Why No Revival?,” an influential work missing much of Chick’s later styles. This tract, meant specifically for Christians, has legitimate insights that you cannot find in many other works of Chick on Christian hypocrisy. From there, his little tracts grew in popularity, and he started releasing some full color comics in addition to his tracts through his company, Chick Publications. He continued to work through heavy controversy, with his infamous preaching style and copious biblical footnotes, before his death in 2016.
On the other hand, Chick is a hater. He may have been an all around unassuming guy, and he may have truly just wanted for everyone to enter the Kingdom of Heaven, but he sure did HATE. A core component of his strategy was this hate, both from him and for him. “I routinely ask my secretary if we are getting any hate mail. If she says no, I get upset because I think I’m doing something wrong,” Chick said. In his paranoid confrontational world, Chick needed constant combat, claiming to be taking the abuse and dishing it out as part of his heavenly crusade to convert everyone. Chick was the pure post-war American, a Protestant fighting everyone he hated, all at once. He was a God-fearing Protestant able to combine all of what he hated into simple groups. According to Chick, the Catholic Church has a computer with every Protestant’s name on it, and the Pope invented Communism and also Islam and also the Mafia and homosexuality. Luckily for Chick, many others thought the same way he did.
On the other other hand though, Chick is a lover. As Daniel Raeburn insightfully pointed out in The Imp #2, “Chick tracts are the Tijuana Bibles of Christianity, plain and simple.” Chick builds tales in which men and women alike are saved by good Samaritans teaching “broken” souls about God. Whether accepting or rejecting the teachings of whatever do-gooder is involved in the particular story, our sinful or soon-to-be-sinful protagonist comes to learn the fate that awaits them, and cries for Jesus. This here is the climax, where YOU the READER are meant to understand the fate that awaits you. Jack Chick’s philosophy was broken down to its bare, contradictory, essentials. Anyone, anywhere, at any time, has a 100% guarantee to get into heaven forever, no matter how bad their sins. Whether it be Charlie the literal child, or Terrible Tom the murdering rapist with a bounty on his head, if Jesus (and specifically Jesus) has been accepted into your heart, you’re in. The natural conclusion here is, of course, that there is absolutely no reason to do good deeds, a conclusion that Chick himself perhaps accepts as valid in the tracts.
So then, what killed Jack Chick? Of course, Chick’s corporeal form succumbed to old age at 92, but what of the ideas, ethos, morals, etc. of Jack Chick? Why did we care less and less about his inflammatory tracts every year? Where did it all go? The answer, of course, is that we killed it. Rational citizens have bigger demons to fight, God has been giving more important battles to His strongest soldiers. Men are now born who have never experienced the environments railed against in Chick’s creeds. We’ve simply stopped caring. Long gone are the days of Tijuana-style evangelical comics available on every street corner, angry hate mail towards a hateful man, or early websites mocking the tracts. We now have more efficient ways to hate each other, and simpler ways to commiserate with like minded folks about whatever fresh hell awaits our haters. But gone as well is the artistry. Hate comics functionally died in 1996, when God gave Jack Chick a stroke for submitting “Where’s Rabbi Waxman?,” severely diminishing both his artistic qualities and his already lacking rhetorical ability. We have passed the event horizon, and antisemetic Ben Garrison edits just don’t feel the same.
Acknowledgments:
I have not even scratched the surface of the depths of Jack Chick and Chick Tracts. Interested readers will want to look into: “Lisa,” the Canadian Ban, Jack Chick the internet atheist, official AAVE translations, Fred Carter as artist J, and the lost feature length Chick Tract film, as well as Daniel Raeburn’s The Imp #2, which served as the inspiration and much of the information behind this article.
Also, Jack Chick was obviously morally reprehensible and most likely a bad person.

As students returned to classes following spring break, they were greeted with an email from the Provost and Chief Academic Officer Jim Garrett stating that the university had approved the Academic Calendar for the 2022-2023 academic year(now in full color!). The 14-week semester is here to stay and students will finally have a week-long fall break. Fall and Spring Break are planned for the 8th week of their respective semesters, facilitating a better parallel within the academic calendar.
Garrett cites the 14-week semester as ideal because, “it allows [the university] to better meet the needs of our student’s health and well-being.” But how, Jim? How do students benefit when 15 weeks is squeezed into 14 like an ill-fitting glass slipper? Carnegie Mellon wants to create the queen of calendars, but 14 weeks is no Cinderella.
A semester’s success relies just as heavily on professors as it does on administration. But placing temporal constraints on their teaching can make it difficult to balance content delivery and exam timelines. With the transition this year to the 14-week pilot program, faculty found themselves having to compress or cut content from their classes. Some classes schedule a routine test and a final exam for the same three-hour slot, which does not seem to match the spirit of rest and relaxation proposed by the quashed calendar. With the newly implemented Fall Break, some professors may use that as an opportunity for students to complete some work that was previously cut from the class. If professors use Fall Break as an opportunity for students to catch up on work, by no means will the time actually “provide our teaching and learning community respite in the middle of the semester and a break that allows time for true rest and restoration,” as Garrett wrote.
This isn’t to say that the introduction of Fall Break is necessarily a bad thing; the university is taking action to try and be more mindful of students’ mental health and giving them a break in the middle of both semesters. However, traditionally, these short breaks come at the expense of the semester, becoming breaks in name only. Let’s face it: only having three days off during this year’s fall semester was a recipe for burnout. If students and faculty are actually able to fully step away from academic work during a week in October, it can really be a positive change. But again, this relies on professors also being responsible and ensuring students have minimal work to complete over breaks.
Though Garrett didn’t directly mention it in his message to the Carnegie Mellon community, a fall break will greatly assist faculty who teach mini courses in the fall. With this year’s 14-week fall semester, faculty only had one weekend to wrap up mini-1 courses until mini-2 courses. With the advent of fall break, faculty now have an additional week between mini courses in the fall, which will likely provide an easier wrap up for all involved in fall mini courses, a perhaps unexpected benefit. All in all, semester timing is tricky, but any attempt to address and acknowledge student mental health is a step in the right direction.
