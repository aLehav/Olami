“I kind of [look] like I just peed. I hate this!” thought sophomore hurdler Keegan Barone as she sat in her Art History class. With a leaking ice pack on top of her hip flexor, the art major pursuing an additional major in business administration was just as irritated as she was wet. As track and field member realized how much the situation was affecting her academic life, she thought about injuries other athletes have sustained and how those injuries impacted their academic lives as well. Not a day later, Barone began her interview series on the impact of athletic injuries on CMU students.
The interviews featured nine different athletes, each from different sports on campus. Each had sustained an injury at some point during their college sports career; the amount of time which these athletes were prevented from playing ranged from a week to two years. With each athlete, Barone explores the question of what it means to be a student athlete with an injury. This ranged from how their injury impaired their ability to be on a team, mental state, and academic life. She hoped to reach a conclusion as to why each continued playing their sports after sustaining an injury.
One of the first players Barone thought to interview was her close friend sophomore business administration major and wide receiver Zachary Taylor. As a football player who tore his ACL and meniscus within the first two weeks of practice, Barone was curious as to how he took the situation.
“I was feeling for him, I was just distraught. He’s actually another inspiration for this piece; when I thought of… how [sports injuries] affect [others], I immediately thought of Zach. He is… [so] optimistic. He’s just an inspiration,” said Barone.
Despite interviewing nine players about their lives and emotions, Barone did not originally intend to create a video on sports injuries. Instead, she was trying to get into the news.
As an art student taking Concepts 2, Barone was assigned the prompt of getting into print news. Barone’s first plan was to break the world record for the most Star Jumps — a jump similar to jumping jacks but instead requires one to thrust themself off the ground. After contacting the Post Gazette and The Tartan for coverage, Barone prepared for jumps. Two days before she was to jump, Barone pulled her hip flexor. This eventually led her to creating her documentary piece.
“When I present my art, I usually just show it, and I like to hear what people think before I tell them what the intention was. For me, that’s what my art is about. It’s about other people making connections with my art,” said Barone.
Barone’s video can be viewed on vimeo at: vimeo.com/235046419.

The football team faced off against the Thomas More College Saints at home on Saturday. The Tartans forced four turnovers and scored five touchdowns in the Presidents’ Athletic Conference (PAC) showdown, claiming a 37–17 victory to stay undefeated in the season at 4–0 and 2–0 in PAC play.
From the start of the first quarter, Carnegie Mellon established the tone of the game on both sides of the ball. On the first play from scrimmage, the Tartans defense forced and recovered a Thomas More fumble. Starting the drive deep in Saints territory, junior quarterback Alex Cline only needed two plays to reach the end zone, throwing a 10-yard touchdown to sophomore wide receiver Jamie Greenwell. The score now 7–0, Thomas More’s next series was more successful, driving all the way to the Carnegie Mellon 2-yard line, but the Tartans defense came away from another fumble recovery to stop it. Later in the first quarter, a 53-yard punt return from sophomore running back Willie Richter set the Tartans up at the Saints’ 1-yard line. On 1st and Goal, senior running back Sam Benger rushed for the touchdown, making the score 14–0.
After a Saints three-and-out, the Tartans offense put together another successful drive ending with the third touchdown of the first quarter, this time a 5-yard toss from Cline to senior wide receiver John Prather. The quarter ended with the Tartans leading 21–0.
The second quarter started off slower than the first; the only points were scored with 1:26 left to play in the half. The Saints’ defense managed to contain the Tartans’ offense that made strong plays in the previous quarter. The Tartans’ defense, however, continued its dominant play, forcing another fumble in its own territory, recovering the ball in the end zone. The turnover stopped a 10-play, 96-yard drive by the Saints’ offense that ate up 4:33. However, on their next drive, the Saints put together another long drive that resulted in a field goal, putting points on the board for the visiting team. Though they were scoreless in the second quarter, the Tartans led at the half, 21–3.
Carnegie Mellon came out of the half with aggressive play, quickly making their way to midfield. On 3rd-and-long, Cline scrambled through the Saints’ defensive front for a 56-yard rushing touchdown. The score increased the Cardinal and Gray lead to 28–3. Not to be outplayed, the Tartans defense stalled the Saints to another three-and-out. The Tartans’ next series ended with Cline’s fourth touchdown, an 11-yard pass to Benger. The extra-point went wide right, keeping the score 34–3. On the ensuing drive, Thomas More scored their first touchdown of the game with a long play from just past midfield, chipping away the Carnegie Mellon lead to 34–10. The Tartans answered with a field goal, ending the third quarter with the score 37–10.
Similar to the second quarter, the fourth quarter remained scoreless for most of the period. The Tartans defense tallied its fourth turnover of the game with an interception from senior safety Jacob Johnson. A late Thomas More touchdown closed the scoring of the game, which ended 37–17.
The Saints had 446 yards of total offense, more than the Tartans’ 362 yards. They also recorded more first downs (19 to the Tartans’ 14) and had much higher third down efficiency (58 percent to the Tartans’ 36 percent). However, the Saints’ four turnovers tipped the scales to the Tartans, who took advantage and put points on the board.
Cline finished with four touchdowns, completing 16-of-20 passes for 177 yards and 90 yards rushing with no interceptions. Prather had five catches for 114 yards, recording his seventh career 100-yard game and his second of the season. Prather also became Carnegie Mellon’s all-time career receptions leader with 152. Benger rushed for 51 yards from 12 carries and a touchdown, and added two catches for 11 yards and a second touchdown. Senior linebacker Stanley Bikulege led the Tartans defense with 10 total tackles, four of them solo.
The Tartans will travel to Bethany College to take on the Bison on Saturday, Sept. 30 at 2 p.m.

Another week of fantasy football has come and gone. We laughed, we cried, and some of us got our butts kicked. No one as bad as me, though. With the only team that was not able to score in the triple digits, I was the overall loser this week by more than 20 points. I’ve accepted this dramatic downfall, and I’m ready to unpack where I went so wrong. Check out this week’s highlights from your favorite fantasy football league.
Yes We Cam over Drop It like it’s Crock 126.2-88.3
This was a tough week for me and a tough loss. I faced off against Editor-in-Chief (and my best friend/other half) India Price. After coming off of a stellar performance in week one, a quad injury took Green Bay Packers wide receiver Jordy Nelson out of the game so he scored a whopping zero points for my team. Carolina Panthers tight end Greg Olsen also took an injury this week and only racked up two points before breaking his foot. Without him in my arsenal for the next six to eight weeks, I’ll be scrambling to find a good replacement before week three.
Price’s players, on the other hand, were all perfect beacons of health. Denver Broncos wide receiver Emmanuel Sanders totaled 24.2 points for her against the Cowboys. Atlanta Falcons running back Devonta Freeman also scored a solid 24 points with two touchdowns and 84 rushing yards. Hopefully I’ll be able to come back from this loss so Price can stop using this as yet another excuse to make fun of me.
Justin Tucker Must (not) Die over Third-String Team 126.7-112.2
This was a much deserved win for contributing editor Lula Beresford who had previously lost to a team that had a player on bye week. New England Patriots quarterback Tom Brady did what she drafted him to do. Throwing 447 yards and 3 touchdown passes, Brady scored 30.8 points for Beresford’s team. Green Bay wide receiver Davante Adams also stepped up in the wake of Nelson and Packers wide receiver Randall Cobb’s injuries. He managed eight catches for 99 yards, scoring 23.9 points.
Contrary to the predictions from the first week, assistant sports editor Marika Yang has not managed to pull out a win. Kansas City Chiefs tight end Travis Kelce really carried her team with 103 receiving yards and a touchdown reception to score 24.3 points, a surprisingly high number for a tight end. While Beresford and I have gotten lucky in the past two weeks against Yang, her actual football knowledge is bound to eventually catch up with us. Yang’s team is definitely one to keep an eye on.
Easy Breesy over Team Andah 139.7-111.4
Sports editor Ian Tanaya pulled out a win over SciTech editor Josh Andah’s still unnamed team. Tanaya’s win was very easy breezy with all of his players, except one, scoring in the double digits. Chiefs running back Kareem Hunt scored two touchdowns and rushed 81 yards totaling in 25.9 points for Tanaya. New England tight end Rob Gronkowski also managed to rake in a lot of points with a 53 yard score. He ended the game with 23.6 points.
Despite Andah’s lack of attention to his team, he seems to be fairing surprisingly well. Buccaneers wide receiver Mike Evans managed to catch seven passes on nine targets and a touch down reception. He finished the game with 22.3 points. What really hurt Andah’s team was Chicago Bears Jordan Howard’s shoulder injury. Being limited to only seven carries and nine yards left him with 0.7 points at the end of his face off against Tampa Bay. We’ll have to tune in next week to see if Andah’s strategy of completely ignoring his team will still pay off in avoiding the overall loser spot. Maybe it’s a strategy that could’ve helped me this past week.

Junior midfielder Jamie Wheaton scored his first career goal on Friday, as the 14th-ranked men’s soccer team defeated Grove City College 2–0 on Friday. The Tartans move their record to 6–1 with their sixth consecutive shutout, while the Wolverines drop to 4–2–2.
Junior midfielder Zack Masciopinto put the Tartans ahead 1–0 in the 42nd minute when he connected on a header following a corner kick by junior defender Philip Petrakian. The corner kick was served to the far post where Masciopinto met it with a header to the near post for his fourth goal of the season.
The goal came on the Tartans’ third shot of the half, as Wheaton put a header on frame in the third minute and junior forward Anthony Gulli put a shot high in the 14th minute.
Grove City put their second shot on frame in the 49th minute, but junior goalkeeper Alec Lam pulled the ball down and kept them from tying the game.
Wheaton’s first career goal came in the 73rd minute when he blasted a low shot from the corner of the 18-yard box to the left post. Sophomore forward Alex Dziadosz played a ball to senior Ryan Stinebaugh with his back to the goal. Stinebaugh settled the pass and touched it out wide to Wheaton who dribbled by a defender and fired the shot on goal.
Lam earned his sixth win and third shutout by making two saves.
On Sunday, the Tartans’ shutout streak came to an end against the 5th-ranked John Carroll University. The game ended in a 1–1 tie after both defenses outlasted double overtime.
Sophomore midfielder Elliot Cohen scored the lone goal for the Tartans in the 26th minute, flying past a John Carroll defender to get a shot past the goalie and putting the Tartans up 1–0. From there, both defenses played extremely stoutly, with opportunities few and far between for both offenses. Though it looked like the Tartans would earn their seventh straight shutout and hand John Carroll their first loss of the season, the visiting team remained determined to defy the Tartans. On the 89th minute, John Carroll made their move, getting past Lam at the literal last second to tie the game 1–1. The overtime periods saw both defenses stifle attempts to break the stalemate, ending the game at the 1–1 mark which still managed to mar John Carroll’s previously perfect record.
The Tartans will open up play against their University Athletic Association (UAA) rivals when they face New York University on Saturday, Sept. 30.

The women’s soccer team boosted their record to 4–1–1 Wednesday night with a 9–0 win over the Allegheny College Gators. The Tartans started the game strong and held their pace for the full 90 minutes. Carnegie Mellon’s defense also shone in this game, keeping the Gators to zero shots on goal throughout the entire game.
It was a fast start, as senior defender Katie Strycharz scored her second goal of the season less than two minutes into the first half. Only four minutes later, fellow senior forward Haili Adams scored again, putting the Tartans up two goals early. The Gators tried to get a few shots off, but were consistently pushed back by the Tartans, who kept up the strong offensive pressure. Despite a multitude of offsides calls, multiple drives up the right side of the field resulted in lots of shots. In the 23rd minute, senior midfielder Tori Iatarola scored after a scramble in front of the net, bringing the Tartans’ lead up to 3–0. In the 24th minute, senior forward Grant Wilmer missed an empty net on an unlucky bounce, but assisted on junior forward Kaily Bruch’s first goal of the game in the 29th minute, as Bruch tapped one in off a breakaway. The Tartans continued to dominate play, showcasing their speed on multiple breakaway attempts, finishing the first half with a 4–0 lead.
The start of the second half continued the Tartans’ domination of play, but the pace of the game was much slower to start. In the 55th minute, sophomore defender Camille Williams scored her first goal of the season off a set play, assisted by Iatarola on a corner kick. This goal pushed the Tartans’ momentum forward, and sophomore forward Ryan Casey scored after beating the goalie on a 1-on-1 three minutes later. Capping the first fifteen minutes of the second half, Bruch scored her second goal of the game in the 61st minute.
Despite a goal being called back for offsides, the Tartans continued to control the game, and sophomore midfielder Tara Durstewitz scored the eighth goal for the team in the 73rd minute. The Gators pushed back in the last few minutes of the half, and had some of their best chances in the 79th minute, but were unable to put any shots on net. Finally, in the 87th minute, Casey scored her second goal of the game and fifth of the season to propel the Tartans to a 9–0 win. This goal also gave Casey the team scoring lead.
First-year goalkeeper Carolyn Botz started the game, and shared the shutout with senior goalkeeper Sarah Mahler. The Tartans finished the game with 30 shots, 23 on goal, while Allegheny managed only one shot with none on goal. The Tartans were also called for offsides 14 times.
After defeating Washington and Jefferson College 1–0 on Friday and playing their Senior Day game against Westminster on Sunday, the Tartans will open up University Athletic Association (UAA) play when they next compete against UAA rival New York University on Saturday, Sept. 30.

360-degree cameras are becoming increasingly popular among consumers as major brand names compete for the best price and video quality. The cameras take video from all angles, producing uniquely immersive footage that viewers can "look around" in during playback.
There are many 360-degree cameras on the market, released by tech brands including Samsung, Ricoh, and 360fly. They vary widely in outer appearance and user-friendliness, but they rely on the same technology. Each camera has multiple wide-angle lenses (usually two) that record video simultaneously, and uses powerful software to patch together the views from different lenses in a process called video stitching. 
Video stitching is based on image stitching, which is what happens in your phone when you take a panorama. In the first step, called registration, the software searches for spots where the images' edges line up, then minimizes the distance between them. Next is calibration, when the software makes the calculations needed to reduce distortion and other visual effects caused by the camera lenses, attempting to make the image look as if it was taken with a single perfect lens. Finally, in the blending stage, the adjustments from the calibration stage are applied, as well as a few other final touches: the seams where the images meet are smoothed, and the colors and lighting in each separate image are adjusted for overall consistency in the composite image. Because many 360-degree cameras are designed for live streaming, they are equipped with software powerful enough to complete the image stitching process incredibly fast for each frame of video, so that the video can broadcast immediately.
360-degree photography is not a new invention, or even an uncommon one: security cameras (the ones that look like a black dome) have used the technology for decades. So why is it just now becoming available to everyday consumers? The rise of smartphones.
Smartphones contain the same kind of tiny, efficient, powerful processors that 360-degree cameras need. As manufacturers competed over the past several years to improve these components, they became stronger and more reliable, and their ubiquity drove the price down significantly. As camera quality became a major competitive point for smartphones, the same effect applied to small, portable lenses — also an essential component of 360-degree cameras. Because the prices of parts went down so much, companies can build the cameras for cheaper, and price them cheaper as well. “There are sensors that now cost $1 instead of $1,000 because they’re used in smartphones,” says Jeffrey Martin, CEO of 360-degree-camera startup Sphericam. Finally, many 360-degree cameras are marketed as smartphone accessories and controlled through apps.
According to Futuresource Consulting, 360-degree cameras made up 1 percent of consumer camera sales last year and are projected to hit 4 percent this year.

Researchers detect cosmic rays from a galaxy far, far away
In Argentina, at the Pierre Auger Observatory, scientists recorded cosmic rays coming from outside the galaxy. According to Karl-Heinz Kampert, the spokesman for the Auger Collaboration, he and hundreds of other collaborators are making progress in uncovering the origin of cosmic rays. 
By studying cosmic rays, scientists can understand more about the creation of matter that make up the nuclei in the elements on Earth. Furthermore, it is the gateway to learning more about matter originating from and existing in the solar system, as well as the Milky Way galaxy.
The Pierre Auger Observatory used a type of electromagnetic radiation, called Cherenkov light, to detect the cosmic rays, which make rare arrivals to the atmosphere of the Earth. After studying the distribution of more than several thousand cosmic particles, they discovered that cosmic rays come from outside the galaxy. The findings were published in the journal, Science.
Ongoing research is being done to identify the extragalactic sources of the cosmic rays, which is important as cosmic rays are becoming more rare to find.

Scientists make first attempt to modify human embryo to explore gene function
At the Francis Crick Institute in London, United Kingdom, researchers deleted a gene in human embryos left over from in vitro fertilization experiments for the first time. A gene-editing technique that had not previously been used in human embryos, CRISPR/Cas9 was used order to study the role of the gene, OCT4, on human development. 
After getting approval for their research proposal from the national government, Kathy Niakan, a developmental biologist, and her colleagues spent a year optimizing the experimental technique in embryos and human stem cells. Once they conducted the study, the researchers saw that the removal of OCT4 decreased the formation of blastocysts, which are balls of cells that form several days into fertilization, going with the prediction that OCT4 is essential for human development. 
However, the researchers were surprised when they discovered that OCT4 played an important role in the development of the placenta. Such a finding, which was published in the journal, Nature, has helped scientists acquire further insight into human biology, and maybe, one day, help to improve fertility treatments.

A team of researchers at the Museum of Natural Sciences in Madrid, Spain, conducted an analysis of the well-preserved remains of the Neanderthal child. According to the paper published in Science, the researchers discovered that it takes longer for Neanderthal children to develop their brains than human children. 
The bones of a Neanderthal boy, who was around seven-and-a-half years old upon his death, were uncovered at a site in El Sidrón, Spain, which dates back to 49,000 years ago. By looking at the teeth, scientists were able to make an accurate estimate of his age, and calculated that the Neanderthal boy had 87.5% of the size of a fully developed brain of an Neanderthal adult. On the other hand, a human child at the same age would have around 95% of the brain size of a human adult. 
The findings challenged research that suggested Neanderthals had a faster development period, which is indicative of having less sophisticated brains, than humans. Antonio Rosas, the leader of the research team, stated that their study will support the fact that Neanderthal were not that different from humans.

Pink algae is accelerating glacial melting — you heard that right. Nick-named ‘watermelon snow’, the crimson-colored snow is the result of Chlamydomonas nivalis and similiar speciesgrowing rapidly. This algae grows on icebergs and colors the snow a pinkish-crimson color. The darker color of the snow makes it melt faster. In fact, the algae may have cause up to six percent of glacial melting. 
Interestingly, the more the glacial snow melts,  the the more the algae is prone to growth, causing a negative feedback loop. However, if the algae is cleaned up altogether, the exposed ice-sheet reflects less and absorbs more heat which again, increases the rate at which the ice melts. Also, the amount of fertilizer in the surrounding areas, increases the nutrients in the ice, which causes algae growth to amplify andin turn, increases the rate of melting. 
A team from Alaska Pacific University (APU) conducted a study of the algae. Adding more algae at specific regions caused more melting, scientists found. By using satellite technology over 700 square kilometers, the team found that within the region studied, the algae was responsible for up to 17 percent of melting (the rest was caused by warm weather).
“We used everything from microscopes to satellites,” said Roman Dial, a biologist at APU. This is one of the first times algae’s effects on glacial melting has been studied extensively. Algae needs warmth to grow, which is why warmer climate encourages growth. 
A scientist at the University of Bristol says that “There’s a growing push to understand the impact of microorganisms on glaciers and ice sheets,”. Some scientists believe the last snows on Earth for some time will thus have a pink hue and that should be taken into account while planning and studying conservation efforts.

We encounter words and numbers every day. From subconsciously reading street signs to calculating the number of minutes left until the end of class to absorbing information from texts, our lives are a series of events that involve calculations and reading, simple and complex. Many of the opportunities to grow, learn, and interact with the world become lost to us, when we aren't able to read, write, or perform simple arithmetic.
The RoboTutor Team, led by Professor Jack Mostow, has taken a huge step in reducing concerns regarding uneducated children in developing countries. The team developed the RoboTutor software with a team of over 100 faculty experts, students, and staff members of Carnegie Mellon University. Its primary goal is to teach children between the ages of 7 and 10 basic math and reading skills without any adult supervision or assistance. Incorporating a wide variety of advanced technology like speech/handwriting recognition and facial analysis, RoboTutor is constantly self-refining its functions by utilizing data from children using the software.
Recently, it was named as one of the finalists in Global Learning XPRIZE, a contest for robotics teams from all over the world aiming to develop software (in both English and Swahili) that provides basic education to underprivileged children. The RoboTutor team was one of the five teams to be rewarded $1 million, an incredible achievement since nearly 200 teams from 40 different countries participated in the competition. The next step is for XPRIZE to conduct field tests of the five finalists’ applications in 200 Tanzanian villages, a study that will last over the span of 15 months.
Prior to developing RoboTutor, Professor Mostow led Project LISTEN, which had an automated Reading Tutor that helped children learn to read by using speech technology to analyze their voices reading aloud. However, RoboTutor is a project a bit more special for Professor Mostow. According to a CMU press release, he said, “I have been able to help a few thousand children over my career. It's hard to put into words to explain the gratifying feeling knowing that your career's work, which has helped thousands of children so far, could now potentially change the lives of millions — even billions — of children. XPRIZE and the RoboTutor team have given me the opportunity of a lifetime.”
A bright future lies ahead for developing countries with a severe shortage of competent teachers, as RoboTutor is different from previously-used educational software. In addition to its extensive use of CMU-licensed technology, one particularly distinguishing feature of RoboTutor is the way developers incorporated their knowledge of local cultures in the design of the app. The RoboTutor team, including assistant processor in the Human-Computer Interaction Institute Amy Ogan, tried to tailor the app to meet specific requirements of different cultures in need of educational software.
“Universal access to education is a major priority for XPRIZE, and we are proud to celebrate the change-making teams making impressive strides to ensure every single child has the opportunity to take learning into her own hands," said Marcus Shingles, CEO of XPRIZE Foundation, according to a CMU press release. "The leading solutions born from this competition could provide the key to unlocking literacy for children most in need, access an education they otherwise wouldn't have.”
The fact that a CMU-developed software was announced as a finalist in a world-recognized robotics competition marks a milestone in not only computer science, but also the university’s footprint in the world. At the end of XPRIZE’s 15-month field test, the team that yields the best results will receive a $10 million grand prize. Hopes are high for the RoboTutor team. After all, this exciting and revolutionary work has the potential to help the 250 million children worldwide who cannot read or compute basic math.

Recently, the way we compliment people, especially children has come under scrutiny for promoting certain forms of biases and influencing their development in unhealthy ways. The most prominent point of discussion on this topic revolves around telling young girls they are pretty or beautiful when they dress-up or apply make-up. Experts say that the constant feedback that young girls and women get from our image-obsessed society gives them the unnecessary message that physical appearances matter more than anything else that they have spent their time, energy and effort in. This discussion spawned a whole new set of studies aimed at studying the effect of complimenting children.
A new study published in Psychological Science reveals that praising children for their smartness promotes cheating. Researchers conducted an experiment with 300 pre-school students aged 3 to 5 years old. The students were individually asked to guess a number if the number-card the proctor held in their hand was greater than or less than 6. The children were told that if they guessed 50 percent of the numbers correctly, then they would receive a prize. 
However, after the first round, these children were divided into three groups. The first group was told “You are smart”, the second was told “You did well this time.” and the third received no feedback. They were asked to play the game a second time, but before the game started, the proctor left the cards with the numbers on them in the room with the child for 60 seconds after asking the child to promise that they would not peek at the cards. 
This research found that children in the first group cheated significantly more than the other two groups. It was also found that males across all groups cheated more than females. 
Thus, subtle social cues has an effect on what decisions children make in their life. The socialization, which in this case is the need to ‘uphold their reputation’ of being smart has a detrimental impact on children.

When you talk to a friend about a concert, you usually tell them something along the lines of “I saw the Arctic Monkeys last night" or "I'm seeing J. Cole next week.” However, while you may phrase it that way, most concerts are really about hearing: being blown away by a loud song, bass so low that it makes you vibrate, or singing along with tens of thousands of other fans.
But when it comes to legendary Pink Floyd bassist Roger Waters, seeing is just as much a part of the show as hearing. Don't get me wrong, the music is still amazing. When Waters played last week at PPG Paints Arena as part of the Us + Them Tour, he performed songs from the classic albums The Wall, The Dark Side of the Moon, Wish You Were Here, and Animals, as well as material from his recent solo album, Is This The Life We Really Want? But, while the music is a key component of the show, it is the visual spectacle that will stick in your memory long after the last chords have faded away.
Waters divided the concert into two parts, both literally — there is a brief intermission after the first 13 songs — and thematically. The concert started with some of Pink Floyd's psychedelic classics from The Dark Side of the Moon: “Breathe,” “Time,” and “The Great Gig in the Sky.” These songs are accompanied by trippy graphics, as colorful shapes and lines danced their way across the massive screen that looms behind the band. Waters and his band are not the liveliest group — there's no jumping off of amps like Billie Joe Armstrong from Green Day — but this is for the best. Not only is Waters 74 years old, but his laid
back performance suited the more relaxed cadence of the music. As a result, the audience spent more time watching the screens than the band, since the captivating visuals and calming nature of these songs invited the audience to
simply sit back and enjoy the show. 
Even when Waters moved onto more explicitly dark tracks, the concert's vibe  remained the same. During “Welcome to the Machine,” a vivid landscape appeared on the screen, with shining silver towers flying through and an insect-like creature crawling about. During “Wish You Were Here,” two hands reached out for each other through a fog across the screen, only to slowly crumble into thousands of tiny pieces. These stunning animations made it feel like being at a movie with an incredibly loud soundtrack. In fact, I was tempted to splurge on
overpriced popcorn during intermission.
I'm glad I didn't, however as the second half took a darker turn that would have made such a frivolous activity feel out of place. Waters hinted at this shift with the final song of the first half, a haunting rendition of “Another Brick in the Wall
Part 2.” As he has done in the past on his “The Wall” tour, he brought out school kids for the background vocals. However, this time they were dressed in orange prison uniforms, and as the songs came to a close, they tore off these outfits to reveal shirts reading “RESIST,” the first of what would be many, far more direct, digs at President Trump.
The more political edge of the second set did not mean, however, that the visuals became less prominent — in fact, Waters used the screen as a device to create the politically defiant atmosphere, as opposed to giving speeches like other artists have. Waters opened the second set with the 17-minute “Dogs,” and as the band played a line of screens descended to hover about the floor section, creating the factory found on the cover of Animals, complete with smoldering smokestacks. Gigantic dogs viciously barked on the screens throughout the song, and at the song's end, Waters and his hand creepily gathered about a table donning dog masks.
The next song, “Pigs (Three Different Ones),” a criticism of the leaders who run society, took the darker, more political theme one step further. When Waters
sang the first line, “Big man, pig man,” a photo of Trump filled the screens, and Waters continued to bash the President throughout the rest of the 10-minute track. The screens displated photos of Trump's head on a pig and as Vladmir Putin's baby, as well as a series of Trump's most controversial tweets, such as "If Ivanka weren't my daughter, I'd be dating her." As the song concluded, “TRUMP IS A PIG” appeared across the screens in bold caps. While supposedly some fans stormed out of the concert, cheers rang out throughout PPG Paints Arena. While many other artists have given speeched, Waters' approach to political commentary, letting the music and visuals speak for themselves, was a refreshing take.
Waters did return to the more psychedelic visuals of the first half, using lasers to create a massive three-dimensional version of the prism from the cover of The Dark of the Moon during “Brain Damage” and “Eclipse.” For the final song, however, Waters chose the eerie “Comfortably Numb,” a song about falling into a drug-induced trance.
While Waters spends most of the concert just performing the music, he used “Comfortably Numb” — and the ominous “Welcome to the Machine” that was played earlier — to interact with the audience, raising his fist and urging the fans to follow along. However, the songs he chose for that interaction raise questions about the message Waters was striving for. By selecting a song that compares the music industry to a machine and a song about giving up control, his ability to easily make a packed arena follow his commands suggests that he might have been making a point about social conformity and becoming “comfortably numb” to the control of others.
It is hard to know if this was really his message, or if it was just a way of engaging the crowd. However, what was clear is Waters' political message, and he ended the concert with yet another unforgettable visual display. As the final notes of “Comfortably Numb” rang throughout the arena, the word “RESIST” returned to the screen, reminding concert-goers what they must do to prevent the pigs of this world from hogging and abusing power.

One of my good friends once said, “The best Bond movie is Kingsman: The Secret Service,” Kick-Ass director Matthew Vaughn’s spy-comedy thriller and surprise hit of 2014. The slightly-satirical love letter to Britain played off on classic spy and Bond movie tropes while delivering on an awesome, wholly entertaining story that felt surprisingly fresh compared to every other action movie also playing in theaters.
Three years later, Vaughn prepares to bring audiences back into a world of more convoluted and cheeky British gadgets and an intense, modern spy environment through Kingsman: The Golden Circle. The much-anticipated sequel follows Eggsy and the rest of the members of Kingsman to the United States, where they pair up with their “American cousins,” the Statesmen, to stop drug lord Poppy Adams from wiping out millions of the population and to save the world. Again.
In Kingsman: The Golden Circle, Vaughn delivers pretty much more of everything: more action, more humor, and more of the characters that we know and love. Like the church scene from The Secret Service, all of the action sequences are sleek, calculated, and flawlessly intense. Each scene helps set up the thrilling, comical tone of this movie right out of the gate and further build up on the fun and the heart of the movie that Vaughn has built on since the first installment. In fact, one of the best things about Kingsman: The Golden Circle was this structure and canon that the franchise has built for itself. Without giving too much away, Vaughn makes the most of what he has created, making The Golden Circle fit perfectly into its pre-established world. The connectivity between the two films helped The Golden Circle truly feel like a film for the fans, which only served to enrich the experience.
The film had a surprisingly bigger message and a much clearer intention than its predecessor. While The Secret Service seemed to sharpen its focus towards spoofing every Bond cliché imaginable, The Golden Circle aimed to use its platform to spread a message about human decency and character through spoof. While it felt shoved-in due to the obvious, overt Trump characterization, Vaughn’s message and meaning behind everything felt surprisingly tender in a stylized, high-stakes, slightly raunchy spy movie.
Taron Egerton steals the show once again as young Kingsman agent Eggsy, a good-hearted man who now has more to lose in The Golden Circle. While his character is a lot less of a comedic relief this time around, Egerton shows off his range by making Eggsy a bright-eyed young man who’s still learning a lot about the world around him. Colin Firth’s triumphant return as Eggsy’s mentor Harry Hart was great to see, but still felt very phoned in. Arguably, bringing him back seems like a spoof-y gesture in it of itself to make, but led to a few more plot holes than the movie needed. Newer characters such as Julianne Moore’s villain Poppy Adams and Pedro Pascal’s Statesman antihero agent Whiskey were standouts, but for the most part the film doesn’t use the full potential of its other talented actors.
While Kingsman: The Golden Circle is truly a film for Kingsman fans, the movie doesn’t try to rein in the fun that it’s having or the message that it’s trying to promote. It’s a shamelessly fun action movie that lacks a little bit of the refinement of its predecessor to tie itself into its new American edge. Kingsman: The Secret Service was the kind of movie that you either loved or hated, and there was really no in-between. Kingsman: The Golden Circle delivers a pretty similar experience, but is overall still a mindlessly fun movie perfect for downtime in the fall.

Sinead and I have only been 21 in Pittsburgh for a month and haven’t really acclimated to the bar scene here yet. So when we picked our bar for this week, inevitably at the last minute, Google had to be involved. We picked the Butterjoint because of its closeness to our respective homes and because Sinead had walked by it before and had been meaning to try it out some time.
The location: As was previously stated, Butterjoint is ridiculously close to campus (and even closer if you live in Fairfax or Webster). It’s up North Craig Street a few blocks past Fifth Avenue in a very quiet area. While South Craig is constantly bustling with college students and restaurants, North Craig is desolate and residential.
The drinks: After our cocktail extravaganza of last week, we promised ourselves that we’d go somewhere this week that would be kinder to our wallets. We did not, however, end up keeping that promise. The entire menu was priced a bit higher than we’d have desired, so even though we tried to stick to the cheaper drinks, we still ended up spending more than we’d wanted. There’s always next week, I guess...
In general, the drinks were pretty mediocre. The cocktails were definitely not of the sugary variety geared towards college students, so we went with the boring adult choices of beer and white wine. I asked the waiter to recommend the sweetest white wine on the menu, but the one I ended up with was still pretty dry. The food, on the other hand, was pretty delicious. The burger was juicy and expertly cooked (the perfect last meal for a day when my diet had otherwise consisted of Cheetos and granola bars), and the french fries were perfection, somehow both moist and crunchy. According to Sinead, the pierogies were “pretty good if you don’t have a Polish grandmother.”
The vibe: The vibe was very intimate and adult. Butterjoint is a tiny place with a little bar and only a handful of tables. While last week the crowd was largely under age 30, this week I could spot three people with white hair from where I was sitting, which was pretty significant considering that the joint could probably only seat about 20 people. The lighting was very dim and the atmosphere was very calm and unexciting. Butterjoint is the right place for serious conversation and the wrong place for anything higher energy.
Lit or Nah: I have to go with nah. The combination of the drinks and the vibe was honestly quite dull. If you’re a college student, you probably don’t want to go to this bar for a fun Saturday night out with friends, but it might be a good place to go when your parents visit.

In creative workshops and critiques across campus there is one watch phrase: critique the work for what it is, not what you want it to be. I suppose that was my mistake with mother!, the new psychological horror film directed by Darren Aronofosky. I saw it hinting at themes I’d never seen explored before in a mainstream film, and was disappointed when it turned out to just be another environmentalist cautionary tale.
The film stars Jennifer Lawrence as the character Mother, a young housewife married to Javier Bardem’s character, simply referred to as Him, an acclaimed poet who seems to have reached a level of stardom usually reserved for movie stars. Okay, I’ll suspend my disbelief. Mother spends her days renovating their house while Him struggles with writers’ block. Their tranquil life is interrupted when Him invites a strange man, and later his wife, to stay with them without asking Mother. What follows can only be described as wild. There’s a murder (well, several), a religious cult formed around Him, cannibalism, a literal war zone in their entranceway, and a refugee camp in their living room, and that’s only scratching the surface.
Most people seem to be taking issue with the fact that [spoiler alert] a newborn baby gets his neck snapped and eaten as communion by the crowd that killed him. That’s not my issue with the film. Aronofosky wanted to drive home a point about the cruelty of humanity, and babies getting brutally murdered in war zones every day in the name of religion. The moment his neck snaps and the feelings that surround it are amongst the only moments of realism in the last 30 minutes of the film.
My problem with the film comes at the very end, in Mother’s parting lines to her husband. The first, right before she attempts a murder-suicide, is “I gave you everything, and you gave it away.” The issue here is simple: it got the travesty of pop music – “Last Christmas” – stuck in my head, something I was hoping to avoid till at least October. The second, whispered to Him shortly before she fades out of existence, is “What hurts the most is that I wasn’t enough” (or something to that effect; I admit I do not have the movie memorized after one sitting). To understand why this line hurt me the most we have to back up a bit.
What pulled me into mother! in the first two-thirds of the film was the constant anxiety. The movie was shot on film, giving it a grainy, dreamlike quality. Most of the shots are kept tightly framed around Mother, giving you the feeling that you’re not being allowed to see the full picture and keeping you on the edge of your seat, constantly tensed for a jump scare that never comes. The sounds are often distorted, and people’s voices fade in and out, creating a sense of being isolated and unable to keep up with the events unfolding around Mother.
All of these details put the viewer firmly in Mother’s point of view, which is vital for the movie’s success, because, as the movie moved along, my mind kept trying to claw its way out of her perspective. I don’t want to be sympathetic to Mother. She yells at her husband for taking a dying man to the hospital and comforting his grieving parents. She tries to kick a kid out of her house for trying to use her bathroom. If these events were told from anyone else’s perspective she would seem like a heartless b****, and my social conditioning bucked the idea of finding her sympathetic.
But, as I spent time in Mother’s head I realized that her reactions and emotions were totally reasonable. I, along with all the other characters in the movie, was expecting her to take care of everything and not have any emotional needs of her own. I thought this was a fascinating commentary on what we as a society expect from people, and women in particular. While her circumstances are extreme, I can see my experience as a woman in Mother’s experience. The movie forced me to consider that maybe the expectations I put on other women and myself are unreasonable.
This is just one example of the social dynamics mother! subtly explores in the first hour and a half of the film. The full range is too expansive to cover here, but mother! touches on interesting questions around celebrity, the creative process, and love, to name a few. The movie is divided up into three “acts” and by the time I finished the second I was sold. Then, things started going off the rails.
Like so many horror movies, mother! jumped the shark in the last thirty minutes. Some time around the World War I-esque artillery fire in their dining room, my suspension of disbelief fell apart, and by the time we found out [another big spoiler] Him is immortal and he and Mother are trapped in an endless loop, I was struggling not to crack up. The third act completely abandons the subtlety of the first two thirds, and drops all nuance in favor of a ham-fisted hybrid allegory of the “rape” of mother earth and Biblical imagery.
This brings us to the problem of Mother’s claim that what hurts the most is that she wasn’t enough for Him. After all the work the movie does to deconstruct the domestic goddess, the creative muse archetype, and half a dozen other boxes female characters (and people) get shoved into, that line boils her entire character down to “just want[ing] to please Him.” The worst thing isn’t the entrails of her dead baby strewed about their house. It isn’t her own charred body. It’s that she didn’t please her man.
If you’re in the market for a visually and auditorily stunning movie about the cruelty of humanity and the destruction of Mother Earth, mother! is 100 percent for you. If you want to watch a film about the ego of the male artist, buckle up. But if you’re looking for something new and layered, make sure you leave early.

Warning: Spoilers ahead.
The Adventures of Rick and Morty may just be the perfect sci-fi show. It takes a bunch of mind-bending ideas — the infinite universe theory, fractured time, alien empires, etc. — and crafts a deeply human narrative on their backs. It’s got dysfunctional family drama, high school crushes, and coming of age narratives. But it also has portal guns, Cronenberg monsters, and meditations on humanity’s place in the universe.
Rick is an old, cold, alcoholic, scientific genius. He’s set up as the smartest man in the universe. He’s essentially unstoppable and untamable. He’s also selfish and immature. In one episode, he turns himself into a pickle, infiltrates the Russian embassy, kills everyone there and liberates a captive terrorist. Why? To avoid going to therapy with his daughter Beth, and his grandchildren, Summer and Morty. He’s an unapologetic drunken a**hole. When he’s not collapsing galactic federations, he’s laying bare the family’s myriad of problems with benumbed precision. Everything Rick barks at his family in between labored belches rings sad and true, and we laugh because what else is there to do?
Morty is Rick’s impressionable 14 year-old grandson. He’s a surrogate for the audience, in that he wants what any teenager wants — to be popular at school, to be noticed by the prettiest girl in class, to finish his math homework, and for his parents to get along. Instead, he’s dragged across the multiverse on emotionally scarring adventures by his godlike grandfather. In one episode, the two of them inadvertently destroy the world via a hastily synthesized love potion that turns those infected into giant insectoid monsters. Instead of fixing the world, the two of them abandon it for an alternate reality with two unique features — an alternate Rick has successfully synthesized an antidote, and alternate Rick and Morty have been killed in an explosion. Rick and Morty bury alternate Rick and Morty in the yard, slip into a new reality as if nothing ever happened, and the show goes on. Dragging his own mangled corpse into a shallow grave of his own digging traumatizes Morty. Understandably so. But it also grants the 14 year-old rare perspective.
The duo’s fantastic experiences across various dimensions of time and space are an acknowledgment of two irreconcilable facts: we exist in a universe that is utterly indifferent to us, and our attempts to understand it will always be met with failure. Rick and Morty wastes no opportunity to remind us that there is no meaning to life. Perhaps because of the existential horror that a premise such as this establishes, the scattered displays of sincerity and kindness have extra resonance. Rick may usually be a selfish prick, but his occasional sacrifices — such as when he surrenders to the Galactic Federation so that his family can have a normal life — build him into a complex character who we relate to despite his unsavory exterior. This is sentimentality, cloaked in Lovecraftian postmodernism and delivered by one of the most sardonic characters in television history.
We have gods. We search for meaning. Rick and Morty says that God is an impersonal cosmic force. It doesn’t care about you. At one point, Morty says to his sister, “Every morning, Summer, I eat breakfast 20 yards away from my own rotting corpse. Nobody exists on purpose. Nobody belongs anywhere. Everybody’s going to die. Come watch TV.” Truths such as this are dreadful, and also empowering. They make life precious. They give meaning to hope.
Is Rick happy? He can do anything he wants to. In one episode, he dates a hive mind that controls an entire planet. At the end of that episode, he goes into the garage and tries to kill himself, and fails only because he’s so drunk he can’t pull it off. In the meanwhile, his simpleton son-in-law Jerry is mowing the lawn outside, blissful in his ignorance. The knowledge that nothing matters, while true, gets you nowhere. The universe itself is hurtling towards heat death, and there isn’t a thing you can do about it. The further back you pull, the more you confront the insignificance of everything you care about.
So should you stop caring? Think of this another way. Don’t pull back. Zoom in on Earth, on a family, on a human brain, and a childhood of experiences, you see all the little things that shouldn’t matter, but do. The small, simple things — going to school, falling in love, raising a child — may be fleeting illusions, but isn’t life better with them? It doesn’t matter that they are of no consequence to the universe. They matter because they just do. Every place is the center of the universe. Every moment is the most important ever. Everything is the meaning of life.

Hi Ruth,
I’m trying to get better at accepting compliments. My crippling low self-esteem both craves and shies away from receiving compliments — I’m terrified of coming off as cocky but also don’t want to insult someone by aggressively rejecting their compliments as I am sometimes inclined to do.
Help!!
Stay Humble, Yeah?
Dear SHY,
Just say “thank you.” No, really — it’s that easy.
I mean, it isn’t, of course, because if it were actually that easy then no one would have this problem when, in reality, practically everyone who’s ever existed has struggled with receiving compliments. It’s a pretty standard social script for the recipient of a compliment to try and downplay what they were complimented on — think, “oh, I just had to do laundry today,” or “gosh, I’m not, really,” or anything else along those lines. But why do we all instinctively do this?
The answer is, well, we don’t. At least, not instinctively. Have you ever heard a kid respond to a compliment by demurring gracefully? I certainly haven’t. So why is it that, once we hit puberty, so many of us become awkward when receiving compliments? (Why do we all become so awkward at puberty, honestly?)
It’s because of what you said, SHY. We’re all worried about coming off as cocky or conceited or super full of ourselves if we respond positively when complimented. We’re worried that if we actually appear to like something about ourselves, instead of downplaying our achievements and personality, then we’ll become a social outcast for being obsessed with ourselves.
To be straightforward with you, that’s not going to happen. (Okay, I will admit that there is a subset of the population that wants you to rag on yourself when they compliment you, but it’s usually just people who are trying to manipulate you or people on dating apps who are trying to hook up. They might call you a conceited b**** if you respond to a “you’re hot” with “Thanks! I know,” but honestly, what do you care for their opinions?)
Let’s talk about why people compliment each other. At its most surface level, it’s a method of social lubrication. We’ve all done this — you’re trying to make friends with someone or at least become an acquaintance, so you compliment their shirt, or their hair, or some other random object they have on their person. And it usually works, because people like being noticed, and they like hearing nice things about themselves. The typical response to one of these compliments is a “Thank you! I like your ___,” and then the both of you have been nice to each other and you leave that interaction feeling good.
Then, of course, there are compliments to make someone feel good. People absolutely do this! And if you respond by being negative about yourself, then that puts them in the position to keep talking you up. If that’s what you want? Well, you do you, but beware the fact that they might very well become resentful of you for doing this.
Lastly, there are the compliments you give someone when you just really like something they have going on. Maybe it’s a great t-shirt, maybe their hair looks phenomenal, maybe they said something really smart in class. If you receive one of these compliments and then start rejecting it? Think about what that implies to the person who complimented you. You’re kind of telling them that they’re wrong for liking whatever it is they complimented.
Ultimately, the response that most people actually want is just a “thank you,” maybe with something extra at the end. It acknowledges that they did something nice and that they made you feel good. And more importantly, it trains you out of thinking negative things about yourself whenever someone says something positive.
You look great in that,
Ruth

Every time I’ve gone back home to India in the summer, I’ve been a little troubled by my sheltered urban existence as a resident of Mumbai, one of India’s largest metropolises. This summer of 2017, I wanted to do something a little different. So I packed the largest backpack I could find, just enough money to last me about three weeks, and took off for the (until then) alien North of the country that I call home.
I travelled alone, taking buses and trains, hitching rides and renting cars, meeting people and making plans as I went along. In the process, I became acquainted with more dialects of Hindi than I knew existed, had the best home cooked Indian food I’ve ever tasted, meditated by the banks of the Ganges, saw a couple of tigers in the wild, tried to break up a drunken street fight, and almost got caught in a landslide. Described below are some of the places I visited. These are well off the beaten tourist trail, and should probably not be on your itinerary if you’re visiting India for the first time. But if you’re feeling more adventurous than is probably healthy for you, then read on:
Rishikesh
A small town on the foothills of the Himalayas and the banks of the Ganges, Rishikesh is often called the "Yoga Capital of the World" for the masses of ashrams and yogis one finds. The fast flowing Ganges, the surrounding forested hills, and the warm discipline of the town’s inhabitants create an atmosphere conducive to meditation and mind expansion.
My bus pulled in to Rishikesh on a warm and clear July morning. The first thing I noticed was how fresh the air was. This was my first stop since leaving the polluted haze of New Delhi, and the crisp mountain air jolted me with energy after an agonizing twelve hour bus ride. The next thing I noticed was how welcoming everyone was. I found out that no one in Rishikesh turns down a traveler looking for food, and most people expect repayment only in gratitude. I later found out that this is due to an ancient Hindu practice, prevalent throughout Rishikesh, known as "atithi devo bhav" which roughly translates to "a guest is equivalent to god."
I spent most of the three days I was in Rishikesh hearing about, reading about, and practicing meditation, and I discovered how easy mindfulness is to cultivate, and how difficult it is to master. I even found a favorite meditation spot — on a small ledge by the banks of the Ganges, where I could hear the temple bells and the whistling wind in the distance, and feel the gentle splash of water on my feet.
Kasol, Kheerganga, and Tosh
Getting to Kasol, especially in the monsoon month of July, is an absolute nightmare. Kasol, Kheerganga, and Tosh are amongst a handful of tiny villages high up in the Himalayas, that are famous for some beautiful treks. There are no flights. There are no trains. The only way to get to Kasol is by road — taking the long winded, mountainous, and poorly maintained Shimla Highway. In the monsoon, this highway is notorious for the frequent landslides.
My bus was about 30 miles away when the heaviest landslide of the season hit Mandi, washing away two tourist buses and killing fifty people. They had not finished cleaning up Mandi when my bus passed it later in the day, and when I looked out of the window, I saw two buses that looked just like mine, overturned at the bottom of the ravine. My mood in Kasol was subdued. My original plan was to complete the famous Kasol-Kheerganga trek, a two day uphill climb crossing forests, rivulets and peaks. However, conquering the mountainside like didn’t seem all that exciting (or safe) anymore.
Instead, on a friend’s advice, I took a cab to the nearby Tosh — a place so out of the way that news of the landslide hadn’t spread yet. I found accommodation at the coolest guest house I’ve ever visited, the Pink Floyd Cafe (their bar even served a drink called Comfortably Numb) and spent the next two days exploring the village, and meeting locals and other travelers.
Sariska
I drove down to this quaint town in the Northwestern desert state of Rajasthan for the adjoining Sariska National Park, the nearby Bhangarh Fort, and the peacocks. There are peacocks everywhere. Approaching the hotel, I couldn’t drive more than a couple of thousand feet without slowing down to let a bunch of peacocks pass.
The National Park itself is one of India’s tiger reserves, with 18 adult Royal Bengal Tigers. The tigers are especially difficult to spot in monsoon because they tend to venture deep into the forest, and the increased foliage due to the rains doesn’t help either. My Safari got very lucky, our tracker was able to retrace the steps of a herd of retreating Sambar Deer, and we caught a male Tiger stealthily tracking his prey cross our path.
BuzzFeed and ScoopWhoop have given Bhangarh Fort a reputation for being a haunted fort. It always comes up in those "most haunted places in India" lists, and has thus attracted a generation of millennial spook seekers, myself included. The Fort is built into the side of a hill, think smaller version of Gondor from Lord of the Rings. It was tall and grand, but the steps were dangerously steep and the place felt older than death itself. If you can get to the top, however, you get these amazing vistas of the Rajasthani countryside, with its hills and plateaus, as the fort spreads itself in jagged lines ahead of you.

This past Monday marked a decade since Professor Randy Pausch delivered his last lecture in McConomy Auditorium. Randy Pausch has loomed large in the consciousness of Carnegie Mellon students for the past 10 years. This influence starts from the very first week that first years arrive on campus and endures when people admire the lights of his memorial footbridge or think about the ways in which technology can intersect with any field — pretty much every moment that students spend on campus. It was his lecture that cemented his already impressive footprint into the culture and ethos of our school.
Randy Pausch was a professor of computer science and human-computer interaction here at Carnegie Mellon University. He founded the Entertainment Technology Center, a graduate program that uses game design and storytelling to promote education. This graduate program, which grants degrees jointly from the School of Computer Science and the College of Fine Arts, still teaches the Building Virtual Worlds class that Pausch taught for 10 years.
Pausch was diagnosed with terminal cancer at the age of 45, and chose to spend some of his last months writing a lecture for Carnegie Mellon’s lecture series, titled “Journeys” but formally called the “Last Lecture.” The topic, though most reading this will have read his book, was about achieving your childhood dreams, something Pausch felt qualified to impart after checking nearly all off of his list, with the exception of playing in the NFL. Even though Pausch could have filled the hour just imparting wisdom about his accomplishments, he also chose to teach how to empower others to be able to achieve their childhood dreams.
This message resonated with such a large audience, at Carnegie Mellon and beyond, that Pausch spent months being interviewed about his lecture, and eventually went on to co-author a book with Wall Street journal reporter Jeffrey Zaslow, which spent 80 weeks on The New York Times bestseller list, and is also given to all Carnegie Mellon students before their orientation.
Pausch’s mentality about how to view both personal and intellectual goals forms one of the first common experiences of all Carnegie Mellon students. This year, orientation groups met to discuss the message of the books, but this discussion was led by learning about the origin of each other’s names. “At the core of working in an interdisciplinary environment is knowing that problems are bigger than any one person, and you need other people’s expertise to create something bigger than any one of you could have individually,” stated Cheryl Platz, senior designer at Microsoft and attendee of Pausch’s last lecture, in a video made to celebrate the 10-year anniversary.
The book represents an inspiring rather than a macabre start to the year. “One of the things about Carnegie Mellon is that people here address problems in the real world, and you don’t get much realer than how do you live your life and how do you ultimately face death,” said another attendee, Byron Spice, the director of media relations for Carnegie Mellon University’s School of Computer Science.
This 10-year anniversary will be marked by events coordinated by the Entertainment Technology Center, with a string of events that can be found on the center’s website, including a screening of the lecture and a panel discussion in  McConomy Auditorium where Pausch delivered his seminal lecture. This will take place  Wednesday, Oct. 11 from 4:30 p.m. to 6:30 p.m. “10 years to us is less about a memorial and more about a celebration,” said Drew Davidson, director of the Entertainment Technology Center.

U.S. Senators on the left and the right have proposed health care reform bills in recent weeks. Senator Bernie Sanders (I-VT) announced the Medicare-For-All Act on Sept. 13, and within a few days roughly a third of Senate Democrats announced their support of the bill. Senators Lindsay Graham (R-SC) and Bill Cassidy (R-LA) have led the GOP’s latest effort to repeal-and-replace the Affordable Care Act, and many Senate Republicans have announced their support.
The Medicare-For-All Act would replace nearly all private health insurance with a single-payer, government-run insurance program, much like Medicare, the health insurance currently used by Americans over the age of 65. However, the proposed insurance would be significantly more generous than Medicare, covering a wide variety of health services at minimal cost to the patient. It is still unclear exactly how such an expensive program would be paid for.
The Republican’s bill, often called the Graham-Cassidy plan, takes a very different approach. It would lower the growth in federal health care spending and turn what remains of the revenue from Obamacare taxes into block grants for states to spend on the health care program of their choosing. The bill would also end many of the Affordable Care Act’s federal regulations on health insurers.
The Tartan spoke with Professor Martin Gaynor, who studies health policy at the Heinz College, to understand what impact each bill would have on the country if passed. Gaynor summarized the reform efforts by describing them as “two bills that represent completely different visions of what a health care system should be like in the United States.”
Gaynor said that Medicare-for-All would be successful in achieving universal health coverage and simplifying our complicated health insurance system, which he compared to a “Rube Goldberg machine.” But Gaynor also said that there are many “legitimate concerns” about the bill. One such concern is how to pay for the extremely expensive health insurance program, and whether a tax increase of the magnitude needed to pay for it would be politically feasible. Even if the program could be paid for, though, Gaynor noted that many countries with single-payer health care systems have the problem of patients waiting months for health services. Also, it is unclear whether middle-income Americans will be financially better off on balance if their taxes go up and their health care costs go down.
A key difference between the Medicare-for-All Act and previous single-payer plans is that Sanders’ new bill outlines a gradual transition process to achieve universal coverage over a few years. Even so, Professor Gaynor said that the bill would totally disrupt the health insurance system, and that Obamacare’s implementation was “peanuts” compared to what the transition to a single-payer system would involve. Such a transition would likely include major efforts by lobbyists to change the health insurance system in their favor.
Gaynor said that he doesn’t think the Graham-Cassidy bill is the way to go. He said that giving flexibility to the states makes sense superficially, but there are some health benefits and consumer protections which are important enough that the federal government should impose regulations and not leave these decisions for states to decide. Gaynor believes that healthcare is one area in which the government should provide a “helping hand” to consumers, arguing that the “invisible hand won’t quite get the job done in health insurance markets.” For example, insurers would once again be able to charge higher premiums to some Americans based on their medical history.
Given that both bills have policy flaws and political challenges, Gaynor proposed that Congress and the White House prioritize modest steps to stabilize and improve the current health care system. One such step would be continuing to give out subsidies known as Cost-Sharing Reductions to help low-income Americans afford health insurance. Another would be creating a public option for health insurance to promote competition in the market. Many Republicans seem to want to repeal the individual mandate that Americans have health insurance, but Gaynor suggests that if they do this, they should replace it with an alternative way of getting young, healthy people to purchase health insurance such as an automatic enrollment system.
As of right now, both U.S. Senators from Pennsylvania, Bob Casey (D) and Pat Toomey (R), have yet to come out for or against their own party’s bill. This offers an opportunity for constituents to share their thoughts with their Senators about which direction they would like health care reform to go.

The Andrew W. Mellon Foundation has awarded Carnegie Mellon and the University of Pittsburgh an 18-month-long $60,000 grant to support a project known as “Digits.” The project is led by Carnegie Mellon digital humanities specialists Jessica Otis and Scott Weingart as well as Pitt’s Matt Burton, visiting assistant professor, and Matt Lavin, clinical assistant professor of English and director of the digital media lab. The aim of Digits is to optimize the software containers used in publishing scholarly research in order to make it easier and cheaper for scholars to publish their work and maintain it.
In the age of digital communications, the distribution and general maintenance of many traditional printed scholarship materials fall to the publisher while the same tasks for nontraditional mediums tend to fall to the original authors themselves.
“Hosting costs, maintenance, peer review, and preservation for non-traditional publications almost always fall upon the original authors; the equivalent duties for print scholarship, instead, are taken up by publishers, libraries, or scholarly organizations,” said the leaders of the project in a co-interview over email with The Tartan.
Thus, out of an intent to mitigate this inefficiency, the Digits project was born. The team began using software container technologies — a term that refers to allowing software to deploy easily without much modification across different platforms, which makes software maintenance simpler, more automatic and less costly — to develop, in the project leaders’ words, “an infrastructure that could work like scholarly journals, but is tailored to born-digital publications.”
The current digital publication system can lead to issues such as link rot, which happens when scholars change web hosts or let subscriptions expire, making the publications no longer available. “The responsibility of digital preservation needs to be shifted from individual researchers to journal publishers or university archives,” said Lavin in a university press release.
Another feature of the project will allow scholars to update their work more easily.
“It is often considered double-dipping or even cheating to publish nearly identical research as more data becomes available,” Weingart said in the press release. Thus, the leaders plan to incorporate an update feature into the software infrastructure they develop.
During the grant period, the project is exploring the use of software containers in the sciences, social sciences, and humanities to develop better software systems for future scholarship purposes, and investigating the specific software needs of the Digital Humanities, a field combining the use of computational and digital tools with traditional humanities subjects. At the end of the grant period, the project’s leaders are planning to assemble a board of American and British scholars to create a blueprint for a new digital scholarship platform based on the software container technologies explored in Digits.
The results of the project — including code, documentation, and technical specifications — will be open sourced in various institutional repositories and on GitHub, and are expected to form the basis of the actual implementation of the Digits platform.

Carnegie Mellon University alumni Andrew Leitch (’12) and Eugene Lee (’75) both won Emmys at the 69th Primetime Creative Arts Emmy Awards on Sept. 10 at the Microsoft Theatre in Los Angeles. The Creative Arts Emmy Awards mainly honors behind-the-scenes technical and production achievements in American Television programming, including production design, casting, cinematography, etc.
This is Leitch’s first Emmy award, which he received along with two other members. They won in the category of “Outstanding Production Design for a Narrative Program (Half-Hour or Less)” for the episode “Omaha” on the sixth season of the HBO show Veep. A couple of his current and upcoming set design undertakings include season two of the popular Netflix show, 13 Reasons Why, and a new HBO comedy TV series, Here, Now.
In the past couple of years, much of Leitch’s work focused on set designing for TV series, while before that he worked as an assistant art director and graphics assistant for various projects. While working on Veep during its fifth and sixth seasons, Leitch also worked with fellow Carnegie Mellon alumni Arthur Chadwick (’97) and Rebecca McAusland (’09), and has mentioned working with Carnegie Mellon alumni in different art departments in his past. In a university press release, Lee mentions that Carnegie Mellon’s School of Drama education is advantageous to students not only due to the vigor of the program, but also because of the connections they can make through opportunities like senior year design showcase.
Lee has won two Emmy Awards in his lifetime (2017 and 2013), both for his work on Saturday Night Live, and has been nominated for another 11 Emmy awards. This year, he and his team won “Outstanding Production Design for Variety, Nonfiction, Reality or Reality-Competition Programming.” Lee is credited with working as a production designer on over 450 episodes of SNL and over 250 episodes of The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon.
In an interview with GQ Style in July, Lee explained his experience working on SNL, a show that is built from scratch week by week: “Things change very fast. It can come together the night before. In a way, it’s charming. On one hand, I’ve worked on shows like Wicked where every moment is thought through, every transition figured out. You have a lot of time to get it exactly right. Here, it’s always changing but you always get to do it again next week. Sometimes it all falls together perfectly. People don’t always understand how it happens — it’s very complicated.”
Leitch and Lee are among the 14 Carnegie Mellon alumni that were nominated a total of 17 times for eight Emmy Awards this year. Of the alumni, 13 studied in the areas of design and production from Carnegie Mellon’s School of Drama.
Some other nominees include Noah Mitz (’05) for “Outstanding Lighting Design/Lighting Direction for a Variety Series” on America’s Got Talent, Mitz for both “Outstanding Lighting Design/Lighting Direction for a Variety Special” on the Grammy Awards and Tony Awards broadcasts, Judith Light (’70) for “Outstanding Supporting Actress in A Comedy Series” on Transparent, John Shaffner and Ann Shea for “Outstanding Production Design For a Narrative (Half-Hour or Less)” on The Big Bang Theory, and many more.

Last week, the Vatican stepped in on behalf of a high-ranking priest and diplomat in the Vatican’s U.S. Embassy. American authorities attempted to strip the priest of diplomatic immunity and potentially charge him with possession of child pornography. The priest, who has not been officially named, will be brought back to the Holy See rather than facing charges in the United States.  
This is not a new practice for diplomats in foreign countries. In 2013, the United States recalled a diplomat who killed a Kenyan in a car accident, allowing their diplomat to face any charges on U.S. soil rather than under Kenyan legislation.  What the Vatican’s actions seem to indicate, however, is a continuation of the Catholic Church’s passive attitude towards charges of child sexual abuse amongst their priests. 
Sexual abuse has been an issue in the Catholic Church for a long time. In the past, many cases have been covered up, have had charges dropped, or have simply not been reported. Sometimes the victims are too scared or ashamed to speak up, and often those who do come under fire for accusing priests of such crimes.  In some cases, priests who are accused of sexual abuse are not truly reprimanded, but are simply moved to other parishes. Thomas O’Brien, former bishop of the Diocese of Phoenix, admitted in May 2003 to sheltering at least 50 priests accused of sexual abuse by relocating them to other parishes across the state. It has become a worldwide epidemic. In 2014, Pope Francis stated that 2 percent of the nearly 441,000 Roman Catholic clerics worldwide are pedophiles, amounting to about 8,000 in total, although the Survivors Network of Those Abused by Priests (SNAP) has said that the real number is much higher. 
Unfortunately, sexual abuse and pedophilia is an issue in every community. The Catholic Church, however, seems to have a particularly high number of scandals and charges. Some point to the size of the Catholic population, nearly a quarter of the American population, while others refer to the fact that priests in the Catholic Church are required to be celibate, sometimes leading to secret or unsavory sexual encounters. Furthermore, the position of priests as holy men, exalted representations of Christ, can make it hard for devout members of a parish to see their priest as capable of such acts. The power imbalance between such revered community figures and children often prevents those children or their families from speaking up or demanding justice. 
Pope Francis has spoken out about the horrors of sexual abuse and related crimes since the beginning of his papacy. He has created a reform commission to protect children, and initially planned to create a tribunal to try bishops for covering up abuse. However, in the time since he took the papacy, his tribunal plans have been heavily opposed, and the two abuse survivors that were appointed to his commission have resigned out of frustration.  Furthermore, one of his top advisors, Cardinal George Pell, was charged with sexual assault in Australia a mere three months ago, making critics question Pope Francis’ capability to handle such charges and spot similar offenses in his highest-ranking officials.
The real issue in this case is not the recalling of the Vatican official. It is the worry that if given the chance to serve justice, the Holy See will not handle the crime appropriately, instead opting to cover it up or give it a softer punishment. While it is, to a certain extent, reasonable for the Vatican to want to take care of the official's justice on their own terms, there are few reasons to believe that this will happen based on the long and storied history of sweeping issues like these under the rug.
Pope Francis is trying to take a more direct stand against sexual abuse and pedophilia in the Church, and this is admirable. Maybe a way to demonstrate this change would be to let the priest in question face American courts, be stripped of his immunity and be tried for possession of child pornography. We need to know that the Catholic Church is no longer willing to defend those who put the health and wellbeing of children at risk. If the priest were tried in America for the crime he committed here, that would be a case that would be out in the open. It would be reassurance for followers across the world that these issues will not be swept aside anymore, but will be dealt with in the open.
However, the Vatican has already called back its priest. So now the consequences lie in the Holy See, where the current pope has talked a big game in regards to fighting this issue. Now is the time for Pope Francis to prove he means business when it comes to the proper punishment for perpetrators. Yes, prioritizing discussion of child pornography issues in the priesthood will certainly look bad for the Catholic Church. However, it will not look as bad as the Church refusing to address the issue, insisting on waiting and pretending while other children are taken advantage of at the hands of men who are supposed to be sources of comfort and wisdom. 
In order to truly move forward after this terrible incident and recover from the all-to-familiar trend, the Vatican needs to face this head on, with strict punishment and a transparent prosecutorial process for potential future offenders. Until it does, there will continue to be priests who do not use their positions for good, and who take advantage of children in their communities while betraying the trust that those communities have given them.

Editor’s note:  Transatlantic Thoughts is a weekly column that examines Carnegie Mellon’s student life from a foreigner’s perspective. Find previous installments @thetartan.org.
I would like to start by a disclaimer: I am enjoying my Masters program at Carnegie Mellon and am very happy to learn here with the best professors in well-taught classes. I never found a stronger enthusiasm for academic excellence than I did here, and it's the pride of Carnegie Mellon. However, I want to expose in this installment the downsides of this double-edged obsession with hard work. I could also write a praise article but that would not be constructive and help Carnegie Mellon bring a little more balance to the life of its students.
That being said, let us deal with this week's topic, the most spread disease on campus: workaholism. You may find that pulling all-nighters and having a hard time before finals is the common lot for students; and to some extent it is true. But the intensity and duration of these four to five week periods riddled with assignment deadlines and exams baffled me. I have seen people stay 48 hours confined in one room trying to get an assignment done and desperate students falling into depression after burn-outs.
Some may say that it is the price to pay when you're aiming for excellence. To those I would say that I consider it more like a form of psychological torture, but not because of the reasons that I've exposed above. The real reason of the burn-outs and the harmful behavior that is developed by students is more complex, and this is what this article will try to convey.
As a grad student, I was prepared when coming here to deal with a significant amount of work, but I had a clear goal in mind: use my Masters as a platform to get access to companies I wouldn't have had the possibility to get into with my French-only educational pathway. I was sure of my academic interests and had no hesitations when choosing my courses to develop my knowledge in a specific area. I know why I came here and I knew what I wanted to do after leaving Carnegie Mellon. But making one's mind about one's goals in life takes time and reflection: the periods of my life where all this reflection took place were exclusively periods where I had more free time do to it, both on campus during my undergrad or during internships.
Giving meaning to your work and thinking about your goals in life, both professionally and personally, is in my opinion one of the most important things to learn during college. College is the place where you can experiment, fail, and discover your passions in an environment that is more tolerant to bad decisions than professional life. When I arrived to Carnegie Mellon, I quickly noticed that something was wrong with this. It took me some time to put the pieces together, but I think I can try to describe the mental process that can lead a freshman to become a workaholic in four years at Carnegie Mellon. The following story is purely fictional but I fear it may concern some students at Carnegie Mellon.
As a freshman, you arrive in Pittsburgh with high hopes and big projects. You're young and you don't really know what to do with your life, so you take a lot of introductory courses. That is where the downfall starts: quickly you realize that even introductory courses necessitate that you invest 110 percent of your time to complete their assignments. But the competitive environment with emulation and rewards gives you satisfaction from hard work, and you're happy to finish your first semester with a decent GPA. Nevertheless, you have to drop your second club because you don't have time to invest in it anymore.
During your sophomore and junior years, your greatest pleasure is seeing the autograder return a 100 percent score. Assignments get harder and harder, the teaching assistants become your friends and you really try hard to get that extra credit to compensate for this moment of weakness where you only had 65 percent. Professors are happy about your results, and you wish you were on the Dean's list. Companies are interested in you, so you attend their events, go to the TOC, and apply for generic internship positions that seem tailored for you. During your internship, you're paid by the hour so you work a lot to earn as much as possible to pay for tuition. During the weekends, you frantically visit the new region you relocated to or you simply study for a summer course.
Then comes the senior year, where the courses are hardest; but they have cool end-of-semesters projects that would be a great addition for your resume so you work even harder to complete them. You and your friends are holding all-nighter contests and you have fun spending so much time with your working buddies. Still attending a club at that point seems to be a waste of time because graduation is coming and you really have to land that well-paid job. Fortunately, the company you interned in makes a return offer to you, and you accept to relocate to their shiny campus where so many smart alumni work.
When you graduate, you're happy: you now have a full-time job with a six-figures income in a prestigious company, and you're ready to prove your colleagues that you deserve your position. Isn't it natural to work 70 hours a week when you really have to push this new feature to the client? When you're finished you and your team will have a great party, and after one day of sleeping you will be ready for new adventures.
If you reached that stage, congratulations: you are a workaholic. Your only concern in life is work and professional success. You are the perfect junior employee, and will have a bustling career start. Until you do your first burn-out. Or depression. Because work-life balance is something you learn, and searching desperately for a hobby to fill your weekends at age 25 is not going to help it in a sustainable way. Even ignoring the human consequences of workaholism, training batches of new grads with this harmful behavior is bad for the economy: you can only sustain a few years of self-inflicted work overload before you develop mental disorders, leading to brilliant minds losing productivity.
That is why it is very important to give undergrads some free time during their four years to think about themselves and the meaning of their work. And by that I don't mean organizing a contest to allocate money to projects that "increase the free time value for student," but rather letting the students organize themselves. How to achieve that? Simply by reducing the workload of the first years of undergrad: fewer courses, fewer assignments. And you will see that with true free time, people will find on their own a way to take full opportunity of what Carnegie Mellon can offer them.
I am sorry for the bleak tone of this article, which is meant to provoke by exaggerating traits and behaviors. To those who unfortunately identified with the portrait I've drawn, I hope that I triggered an occasion for some soul-searching: the sooner you realize you're on the workaholic track, the better you can prevent it from happening.

Being pushed to follow your childhood dreams seems to be a consistent part of the Carnegie Mellon University culture. Even before orientation, each of us received in the mail a printed copy of Professor Randy Pausch’s The Last Lecture, the central theme of which was achieving your childhood dreams. The bridge into the Gates Hillman Center serves as a daily reminder of that, as is the constant presence of campus tour guides who bring it up. It has begun, much to my dismay, to feel rather overwhelming.
While I don’t diminish the value of the message in any way, for it truly can be an inspiration to those who interpret it as such, I nevertheless feel isolated the more I hear it floating around. The assumption the message makes is that each of us already has a childhood dream, or some seemingly unreached goal to strive towards. But what if that is not the case? 
I am sure that I’m not alone in this, but I’ve never felt a singular dream call to me in as urging a way as described by the late Professor Pausch. I’ve never felt that I must accomplish something before I die, never had a goal I would sacrifice something valuable for, never wanted to do something “big.” 
Even when I was younger, I never really had all the ambitions I saw in my peers. My friends wanted to be musicians, artists, poets, doctors, spies, but I was simply... content. Of course, I had passing whims, certain short periods of time during which I entertained the idea of being a certain someone in the future. However, those whims were just that — passing. Nothing stayed. Meanwhile, those around me seemed to have stuck with at least a remnant of theirs. Some went to music conservatories, some have decided to pursue the fine arts, while still others are on the pre-med track. 
I cannot say that my childhood dreams had any influence whatsoever in what I am choosing to do currently. I had wanted to be a traditional artist, but soon gave that up as I realized that I was simply mediocre at art. Then, I had wanted to be a writer, but found that inspiration came too slowly. Most recently and perhaps the least childhood-esque dream I had was being a doctor, but I, again, was discouraged, this time because of the prolonged schooling involved. Had I tried, really tried, I would have been able to pursue any one of those paths. For some reason, however, none of them seem quite as appealing to me now, and there simply exists no desire for me to fulfill my childhood dreams.  
So, a natural question might be: am I dissatisfied with myself and with how my circumstances turned out in the end? I wouldn’t say so. Despite the fact that I am surrounded at Carnegie Mellon by some of the most ambitious people I have ever known, all striving for something great, I am certain there are as many who are on the other end of the spectrum — those who will let past dreams lie. 
While I have been jealous of those who do intend to follow Professor Pausch’s words, I want to also say to those who do not that we are not incomplete people. Less conspicuous, perhaps, but not missing a part of ourselves. Though I am often overshadowed by the outspoken dreamers, I am okay with that, because standing out was never a dream of mine.

St. Louis police officer Jason Stockley was recently acquitted of first-degree murder in the death of a black male back in December 2011. Protests broke out over the acquittal of Stockley this week, highlighting the injustice of the decision. More than 120 people were arrested Sunday night after peaceful demonstrations turned violent. CNN affiliated networks reported that officers chanted, “Whose streets? Our streets!” after making arrests that night. On Monday, silent and peaceful protesters locked arms on Market Street. Participant Bryan McClellan stated, “We want to achieve one goal — an end to the disparate killings of black citizens at the hands of police.”
Two issues surround the controversy of this case: whether the officer planted the gun on the victim, and whether the statement the officer shouted caught on his body cam prior to the shooting counts as premeditated murder.
Video footage during the police chase catches Stockley claiming he was “going to kill this mother... don’t you know it.” Prosecutors have accused Stockley of planting a .38 revolver in Smith’s car. Court documents state that Stockley’s DNA “was on every weapon he touched. Anthony Smith’s DNA was not on any.”
This is the full account. Jason Stockley was serving as a St. Louis police officer for five years. Stockley was with partner Officer Brian Bianchi when they were called to a suspected drug buy happening in a parking lot in the Walnut Park West neighborhood. The officers in their SUV attempted to barricade the victim, Smith, who was sitting in his Buick. While exiting the SUV, Stockley wielded his personal AK-47 rifle, but switched to his police-issued Beretta and shot seven times at Smith’s car, which was fleeing the scene. A police chase ensued, until the SUV was able to rear end Smith’s car, forcing it to spin to a stop.
Stockley exited the vehicle and ran to Smith’s driver side. Sensing imminent danger, he fired his Beretta at Smith’s side five times, killing Smith. Stockley claimed that Smith ignored his commands to show hands and was instead reaching for what Stockley believed to be a gun.
This event adds to the recent years’ high-profile controversies of police brutality against minorities, though the practice of overt discrimination by utilizing violence is as old as the United States itself. Black men in particular are affected by the killings, as the officers claim their actions are in “self-defense” as a veneer of justification for murdering the often unarmed individuals. Recent cases include Trayvon Martin’s murder, where George Zimmerman opened fire on the hoodie-clad teen, and the 2014 murder of Michael Brown, where Officer Darren Wilson shot and killed the unarmed teen in Ferguson, MO.
I have my own strong opinions about gun violence, race relations, and police brutality. Having seen the racial profiling and mistreatment of black youths throughout my life, I know where I stand. I can try to persuade skeptics about the immorality of it all, the failure of Reconstruction after slavery and the Civil War, the systemic oppression as a foundation for this type of treatment, the income inequality, the school-to-prison pipeline, the failures of public school in disenfranchised areas where black and Hispanic people heavily populate, and more, because the problem of police brutality and racism is much bigger than one article’s explanation.
However, what is more directly telling are the sheer numbers of black people being killed unjustly every year. What matters is the stigma of black-on-black crime and the so-called “violent tendencies” of this race that somehow justifies these numbers for those most skeptical. Consequently, the rest of this article will be empirical evidence that brutality against black people in 2017 still exists, and in conjunction, violent crimes against black people by American citizens as well.
Black people are being killed by police at persistently higher rates. In 2016, 963 people in the U.S. were been shot and killed by police forces. Of those, 309 of them were African American. Fewer than 1 in 3 black people killed were suspected of a violent crime or armed. However, black people are still three times more likely to be killed by police force than white men, according to the American Journal of Public Health. 30 percent of black victims were unarmed, compared to 21 percent of white victims. Dr. James Buehler, a professor of health management and policy at Drexel University in Philadelphia, found that, “although white men accounted for the largest number of deaths, the number of deaths per million in each demographic population were 2.8 times higher among black men and 1.7 times higher among Hispanic men, respectively.”
This is larger than police violence. Interracial homicides increased last year by its largest margin since the election of Obama. The percentage of black people killed by white people jumped 25 percent, and the number of white people killed by black people rose by 12 percent. However, black people have accounted for nearly half of the country’s homicide victims, despite making up 12 percent of the nation’s population. At first, an argument about black-on-black violence can be made. A 2013 FBI report stated that 90 percent of black people who are murdered are murdered by other blacks. However, the same report continues to state that 83 percent of white victims of murder were killed by white people. Moreover, almost every study done in this field shows that crime is a socioeconomic problem. The Bureau Justice of Statistics reported that between 2008 and 2012, “Poor urban blacks (51.3 per 1,000) had rates of violence similar to poor urban whites (56.4 per 1,000).” Black-on-black crime does not exist — just crime. The question is, why are there so many poor black people? Based off of the United State’s historical treatment of this race, I believe the answer to that is clear.

The beauty industry has been facing noticeable changes recently. CEO of Coty, Camilla Pane, points out that "the beauty industry is becoming increasingly complex... But we either embrace it, or we’re not going to be around.” 
Consumers are starting to care more about ethics behind their favorite products, as can be seen in the move towards brands not testing on animals. The market is easier to enter, putting independent brands on the same playing field as many well-established brands, allowing them to thrive. However, one area has revolutionized the beauty industry and sparked conversation: diversity.
Representation has been and continues to be a concern, especially for racial minorities. Kenneth and Mamie Clark's famous doll experiment showed that children, when presented four dolls of different skin shades, associated positive traits such as beauty to the doll with the fairest skin. Although this experiment was conducted decades ago, we still have a long way to go in terms of accepting beauty of all shades. In 2014, actress Lupita Nyong'o shared her experiences growing up and only seeing beautiful people as those with lighter skin and being taunted about her dark skin. What changed her perception of herself was seeing a celebrated model "dark as night" being praised by many, including Oprah. Seeing that beauty was not exclusive to white people, Nyong'o realized that she, too, was beautiful. Years later, Nyong'o rose to fame and her prominence led to an emotional letter from a little girl who was about to lighten her complexion until "[Nyong'o] appeared on the world map and saved me," teaching her to embrace her beauty.
Western society is not alone in facing this problem; this can be seen in East Asian cultures as well. South Korean beauty products are increasing in popularity, yet the industry fails to adjust to their now worldwide demand by continuing to provide a mere handful of shades that complement Caucasian-like skin shades. Lighter skin is seen as more desirable, and it is not uncommon for people to undergo surgeries or use skin creams to lighten their complexions. Even in the midst of these standards, Korean industries could greatly benefit from expanding shade ranges so that they can expand their market and include consumers from all across the globe.
Recently, an innovator with great power decided to take a step in fixing this problem. On Sept. 8, critically acclaimed singer Rihanna launched her new beauty line Fenty Beauty. This line is more than just another trendy fad created by an influential artist; by releasing products that accommodate an incredibly diverse demographic, she welcomed "everyone...[of] all shades, personalities, attitudes, cultures, and races." Rihanna continued that she "wanted everyone to feel included," confirming the need for the beauty industry to better include all beauty fanatics, not just those with lighter skin. Her sneak peek features women of various skin tones and races, demonstrating that Fenty Beauty was truly meant for everyone. This has led to other brands to put more emphasis on their shade ranges, something that many of them had not done as much prior. Despite all this, there is still much left to be desired in the beauty industry holistically. Many people on social media, most notably black women, are pointing out the lack of inclusiveness.
One prominent example is Nyma Tang, a makeup enthusiast known for testing the darkest shade that various different brands carry. Although there have been some products which have succeeded to include darker skin-tones, she shows that the "deeper end of the spectrum is completely left out most of the time." By leaving out a significant demographic of customers, companies not only harm themselves by missing out on a critical marketing opportunity, they cause their consumers to feel as though they have been "completely disregarded." Despite countless disappointments, Tang has found that Fenty Beauty accommodated her needs and mentioned that seeing other women of her skin color being "matched at Sephora" with the same products filled her with so much elation, knowing that Rihanna recognized and acknowledged her darker-skinned consumers.
People with darker skin are not the only excluded group who find acceptance by Rihanna's line. Krystal Robertson, an African-American woman with albinism, was able to find a perfect match for the first time in her life. Now, her shade is sold out, showing the large demand on this end of the spectrum as well. Her albinism, which lowered her self-esteem and made her victim of bullying, is now celebrated as something that made her beautiful.
Although Fenty Beauty is a line with high-quality products and similar prices with other top-brand cosmetics, that is not its top asset. Keeping a consistent formulation across shades is not an easy task, but the fact Rihanna has been able to do so causes her brand to become a new standard for the beauty industry.
Forty Shades of Fenty has set the new standard for beauty industries. In order to catch up with the expanding market, it is in the best interest of other companies to take on this notion of diversity in their consumers. Makeup is a fun experience, and nobody should be barred from this creative outlet because of skin color.

Last Sunday, Sept. 17, to the curiosity and criticism of many, we witnessed former press secretary Sean Spicer appear during the opening monologue at the 69th Primetime Emmy Awards. “Is there anyone who can say how big the audience is? Sean do you know?” asked host Stephen Colbert as he neared the end of his monologue. Spicer, on an all too familiar podium, wheeled in, jokingly declaring that “this will be the largest audience to witness an Emmys, period — both in person and around the world,” poking fun at himself and resembling Melissa McCarthy’s satirical portrayal of him on Saturday Night Live. 
But, we ask, why did he appear on the Emmys? For what exact reason? To answer this question, we delve into Spicer's past.
On Jan. 21, 2017, all was tense in the James S. Brady Press Briefing Room. It was only the second day of the Trump presidency, and the White House press corps was caught off-guard by the surprise press briefing notice that was issued earlier that day. After keeping the press waiting for more than an hour, Press Secretary Sean Spicer, anxious yet determined, set foot in the room at 5:39 p.m., notes in hand. In his grim, grey suit and with a displeased countenance, Spicer briefly glanced at the journalists in front of him before commencing the first “unofficial” press briefing of the Trump presidency.
“Good evening. Thank you guys for coming,” Spicer began. “I know that our first official press briefing is going to be on Monday, but I wanted to give you a few updates on the President’s activities. But before I get to the news of the day, I think I’d like to discuss a little bit of the coverage of the last 24 hours.”
Following his seemingly congenial greetings, Spicer went on a tirade of arguments and accusations that set the tone of the Trump administration’s hostility towards the press for the many months to come. “Some members of the media were engaged in deliberately false reporting… a reporter falsely tweeted out that the bust of Martin Luther King, Jr. had been removed from the Oval Office,” announced Spicer.
On a more controversial note, Spicer maintained that the crowd at President Trump’s inauguration “was the largest audience to ever witness an inauguration — period — both in person and around the globe,” in reference to photographs comparing Trump’s inauguration crowd with Obama’s. He concluded his briefing by berating the press, characterizing them as “shameful,” “dishonest,” and reprehensible for “sowing division about tweets and false narratives.” Spicer left the briefing room at 5:44 p.m. He took no questions.
Minutes after Spicer’s appearance, social media erupted with criticism and shock. “Jaw meet floor,” tweeted Glenn Thrush, White House correspondent for The New York Times. Ari Fleischer, who served as press secretary under President George W. Bush, commented that “this [briefing] is a statement you’re told to make by the President. And you know the President is watching.”
In the months following, however, it became clear that the briefing on Jan. 21 was not an anomaly. From mistakenly stating that Hitler “didn’t even sink to using chemical weapons” to claiming that “sometimes we can disagree with the facts” to engaging in tense exchanges with April Ryan, White House correspondent for American Urban Radio Networks, over topics regarding alleged collusion with Russia, Spicer’s tenure was characterized by a tumultuous relationship with the press corps and plagued with controversy.
At long last, on July 21, after strong disagreement with the President regarding the appointment of Anthony Scaramucci as communications director, Sean Spicer resigned from his role as press secretary.
Unexpectedly, in the past two weeks — less than two months since his resignation — Spicer has reemerged through talk shows, interviews, and, as mentioned previously, the Emmys. 
“I don’t think it was the best start, no,” Spicer replied, chuckling, in response to Jimmy Kimmel’s question regarding his first press briefing. “Your job as press secretary is to represent the President’s voice and to make sure that you are articulating what he believes… whether you agree or not isn’t your job,” he added. 
As for the Emmys, Spicer’s cameo prompted mixed reactions from celebrities and the public. “Hoping to forget politics for one night and bask in other people’s glory at the #Netflix #Emmys party,” posted actor Jason Isaacs on Instagram. “[He] has the aura of a giant festering abscess. Strange, since he was so charismatic at the (elevated) podium.” 
Now, what is clear from the recent television circuit is that Spicer is on a campaign to rebrand his tainted image. It is true that his role as press secretary under President Trump was a tough occupation, indeed. As Spicer mentioned to Kimmel, his job was not to agree or disagree, but to represent the president’s stance and voice in the public domain. However, as compulsory as it may seem, Spicer played an instrumental role in spreading inaccurate claims from the White House, and his conscious decision to continue his job was purely voluntary. 
Public servants, in this sense, have an additional layer of complexity to their administrative tasks. As citizens themselves, government officials must balance their duties and responsibilities with respect to integrity and honesty, most notably when interacting with the public. In essence, it is a clash of values that must be balanced: while it is important to be efficient and hard-working, public servants ought to be especially critical and conscientious of the orders that they receive. Rejecting facts and actively defending a presidency that upholds falsehoods to advance its political agenda is an unequivocal example of imbalance in this dichotomy. 
Though Spicer has appeared to be apologetic in his latest interviews, we simply cannot forget the integral role he played at the outset of the Trump administration. It is interesting, nonetheless, to observe Spicer’s more authentic personality. For some of us, through this new-found side to the former press secretary, we feel compassionate towards Spicer and the adversities he weathered. 
“A certain part of me felt sorry for him,” Kimmel said on his show, the day after the Emmys. Colbert, the guest on the show at the time, immediately replied, “Really? Because, he wasn’t apologizing… He wants to be forgiven, but he won’t regret anything he did.”
