It seems quite fitting that after a week of dismal weather, the sun rises on our athletes as they go out to shine in the 2015 Quad meet featuring athletes from four schools (Pennsylvania State University: Behrend; Westminster University; Carnegie Mellon University; and Washington and Jefferson University).
The first major event of the day was Men’s Javelin Throw and while — for the most part — the only challenge seemed to be following the javelin as it went into the sun, the wind (traces of Pittsburgh’s harsh winter) caused many foul throws. The event was certainly not lacking in intensity or competition however, with each thrower putting it all on the line — creating an atmosphere that would carry on for the rest of the meet. In the end however, it was a competitor from Penn St. that stole the day with a throw spanning a whopping 60.25m. Carnegie Mellon’s best performances came from sophomore David Ott (5th place with 44.72m) and first-year Jacob Schofel (6th place with 44.67m).
Next up was Men’s Long Jump, which saw a Westminster competitor jump a jaw-dropping 6.33m to achieve first place. Carnegie Mellon sophomore Donald Boyer and first-year Andrew Lee were not far behind placing third and forth place respectively with jumps of 6.24m and 6.12m apiece. Men’s Shot Put again saw Penn St. place first with an astonishing throw ranging 14.55m. Carnegie Mellon first-year David Trzcinski held his own, placing third with a throw distane of 12.73m.
Penn St. dominance in the throwing events carried over to Men’s Pole Vault as a competitor stunned the crowd with a leap of 4.33m. With the exception of Westminster junior bagging second place with a jump of 4.18m, the men from Penn St. nearly filled the table, leaving Carnegie Mellon sophomore Kyle Weaver at sixth place with a jump of 3.58m.
The men from Carnegie Mellon, however, were far from done and they came back with a terrific performance from all their athletes in Men’s Hammer Throw with all their competitors nearly filling the rankings. Schofel came into his own with a stellar throw of 44.96m. Junior Paul Hamerski placed a solid second with his distance of 39.04m. Also performing well during the event from Carnegie Mellon were sophomore David Ott, Trzcinski and sophomore Jacob Brooks.
The Men’s 3000 Meter Steeplechase held the bar set in the Men’s Hammer Throw as Carnegie Mellon held on to the first and second places with great performances from sophomore Curtis Watro and senior Elliot Watson, notching times of 9:54.58 and 9:58.65, respectively.
The Men’s 100-Meter Dash is always one of the most anticipated events at an athletic meet and it certainly did not disappoint today. Despite fierce competition and crippling pressure, a Westminster competitor placed first with a time of 11.23 seconds to cap a breathtaking performance. Sophomore Matthew Sheh’s time of 11.87 seconds put him in sixth place, which should be a clear indicator of the difference between the competitors and the thrilling the performance.
There were few events at the meet that saw more preparation go into them than the Women’s Pole Vault. Everything from the tension among the competitors to the vehemence of their practice routines set the tone for a truly spectacular contest. While each woman pushed herself to the limit in the event itself, all of them aiming for perfection, it was a sophomore from Westminster that stole the show with a remarkable leap of 3.43m that simply left her untouchable by the opposition. Carnegie Mellon did maintain a presence in the event, with sophomore Grace Yee notching a 2.98m leap to put her into fourth place.
Carnegie Mellon headlined the Women’s Long Jump, capturing both the first and second places. Senior Sasha Spalding thrilled the crowd with a jump of 5.23m, putting her far ahead of her competitors. First-year Luise Bering put forward an impressive performance as well with a jump of 4.77m.
Spalding continued to hold the Carnegie Mellon banner high in the Women’s Shot Put as well, notching a throw of 11.09m that was well ahead of second place which was awarded to a throw of 10.66m. Spalding placed second in the Women’s 100m Dash with a time of 13.24 seconds, making her an athlete unlike any other with excellent placements in throws, jumps, and runs.
The Women’s 800-Meter Run saw the true capability of Carnegie Mellon’s women’s athletics as the Tartans occupied 8 of the top 12 positions. Junior Erin Kiekhaefer headlined the performance with an awe-inspiring time of 2:18.87 followed swiftly by first-year Sarah Cook with a time of 2:19.32.
The women from Carnegie Mellon were leaps and bounds ahead of the competition, tallying a formidable 191 points with Westminster coming in second with 124 points followed by Washington and Jefferson (94 points) and Penn St. (82 points). The Carnegie Mellon men’s team (200 points) fell by a measly 12 points to Penn St. (212 points). Westminster came in third with 144 points followed by Washington and Jefferson’s 36 points.
Ultimately, however, the brilliantly balanced performance from Carnegie Mellon (owing to the dedication and practice of its athletes) stole the show as the combined standings put Carnegie Mellon at the top with a whopping 391 points followed by PSU Behrend (294 points), Westminster (268 points) and Washington and Jefferson (130 points).

As she gazes down the fairway, first-year golfer Summer Kitahara knows that she is in a world of her own: just her, her club, and a golf ball. And yet, the computer science major is aware that her team is counting on her to play her role, an particularly prominent one due to the structure of the Tartans’ women’s golf team.
To say that the Carnegie Mellon women’s golf team is unusual in its structure is quite an understatement. All but one member of the team are first-years, and junior mechanical engineering major Yoon Hee Ha spent the fall semester studying abroad. In addition, the fall semester marked the first time the women’s golf team would be competing at the varsity level, having previously competed at the club sports level. Jumping up to the next competitive level would be tough for experienced teams, let alone a group of first-year students entering uncharted territory along with new Head Coach Dan Rodgers and Assistant Coach Nick Dunn.
Kitahara, however, contends that these circumstances have produced remarkable team chemistry. “We bonded really well in the fall because we were really new to the college lifestyle,” Kitahara said. “We were learning to balance tournaments and homework.” This is certainly no easy feat, considering the rigor of courses everyone on the team had. Yet, throughout the course of the year, the team has played very well against their competition, with Kitahara leading the way with an average of 80.3 strokes per round.
Kitahara considers herself well-prepared for her role as one of the team’s leaders both on and off the golf course. Having come from a household with a strong focus on extracurricular activities, Kitahara often participated in swimming, tennis, and golf, becoming more serious in golf as she approached her high school years. She emerged as the number 1 player for her high school during her junior and senior years, and she wanted to participate in golf going into college. The most important thing to her was academic rigor, leading her to Carnegie Mellon.
While the team’s first tournament of the year at Westminster resulted in a very respectable second place finish, Kitahara feels that the team’s performance at Grove City three days later really cemented their place in the competitive scene. Despite the presence of some experienced Division II teams in the tournament, the Tartans ended up finishing in first. “It was a big boost of confidence and made us feel like more of a team,” she said. From there, the Tartans capitalized on their momentum, taking first place at both Thiel College and Saint Vincent College over the course of the next week.
During Spring Break, Kitahara accomplished her proudest performance yet: finishing in the top five at the University Athletics Association (UAA) Championships in Sorrento, Florida. “Going down to Florida, the competition was a lot larger than what we normally have here,” she said. Despite the initial intimidation of the competition, Kitahara was motivated to outclass her competitors. With scores of 80 and 81 over her two rounds, she was named part of the All-UAA first team and Division III Eastern Collegiate Athletic Conference (ECAC) Women’s Rookie Golfer of the Month.
For Kitahara, her feats off the golf course remain more important to her than her already impressive showings on the course. “Overcoming challenges like finding the answer to a 251 problem are even more rewarding,” she said. The competitive drive she shows in golf is heightened when it comes to the academic challenges she faces regularly. “I’ve learned not to give up. It’s really rewarding when you finally solve those problems.”
Nevertheless, she knows that she will be continuing to play golf as she progresses at Carnegie Mellon. “It’s an important part of my life, and I won’t be letting it go anytime soon.”

The Final Four of the National College Athletic Association (NCAA) Division 1 Men’s Basketball Championship is over, and with it the Kentucky Wildcats’ 38-game unbeaten streak for the season. Let’s recap the two semifinal games before looking at the final game of March Madness 2015.
Duke Blue Devils vs Michigan State Spartans 
(81 – 61)
There was a consensus that the brilliant offense of Duke, provided largely by first-year stars Jahlil Okafor and Justise Winslow, would face a tough test in Coach Tom Izzo’s Spartans, but eventually pull through. What we saw was a repeat of the defensive intensity shown in the Regional final against the Gonzaga Bulldogs, where Duke’s perimeter players harassed Michigan State players as soon as they stepped into the half court to severely limit the Spartan offense. Winslow was especially impressive as opponents shot 1–7 with him as primary defender in the first half as Duke built their lead. Okafor did his usual work on the block as he used his massive size to his advantage over smaller defenders to score easy buckets. There was too much firepower in this Duke team for Michigan State to stand a chance, as shown by the emotion in the players after first-year guard Grayson Allen threw down a huge dunk off his own missed three-point shot in the second half and role players like center Marshall Plumlee stepped up to ensure the lead was not reduced against reserves. The end result was an easy 20-point victory for Coach Mike Krzyzewski’s team as he gets a shot at his fifth national title and the first since 2010.
Wisconsin Badgers vs Kentucky Wildcats 
(71 – 64)
The entire nation was waiting to watch this game, a rematch of last year’s thrilling semifinal.
There were several storylines that were spoken of before the beginning. Bo Ryan and John Calipari go head-to-head in a matchup of two of the best coaches in basketball right now and as finalists for the Hall of Fame this year. No one has been able to stop Wisconsin senior center Frank Kaminsky this season, but he hadn’t faced defenders like junior forward/center Willie Cauley-Stein and first-year forward Karl-Anthony Towns yet. Wisconsin junior forward Sam Dekker had shot lights out in the tournament till now, but no one knew how he would fare against the length of another mid first round projection in first-year forward Trey Lyles.
These two teams combined are expected to have 6 players going in the first round of the NBA draft. Players’ draft stocks depended on this game.
The flow of the game wemt largely as predicted as each team made their runs and took brief leads before the other came storming back to level it up or take the lead themselves. The stifling Kentucky defense looked lost at times against the extremely well-spaced Badgers offense with no one in their star front court rotation able to handle Kaminsky down low or at the three-point arc. Kentucky was shooting above 60 percent for most of the game, though, so they were able to keep up with the quick scoring of the Wisconsin offense to whom they were surrendering a lot of offensive rebounds and second chance points.
The dominant play of Kentucky began to show up and they were leading 60–56 and in control of the game with only a few minutes remaining. Wisconsin turned the tables though, turning up defensively with Kaminsky and Dekker playing their part in limiting Kentucky’s several options. Sophomore guard Aaron Harrison air-balled a three with the Badgers leading 68–64 with less than 10 seconds remaining and Wisconsin iced the game at the free throw line as they became the first team to beat the Wildcats this season.
Wisconsin Badgers vs Duke Blue Devils
Monday Night
In a matchup of what are probably the two best offensive teams in college basketball, the difference will come down to who has the better defense on the day. For a large part of the season, most viewers assumed that Wisconsin is better there and would possess the advantage in this matchup, but the last two games have shown that Duke can really step up their  defensive intensity when required. The most fascinating battle will be between the two of the NCAA’s best centers in Okafor and Kaminsky. One of the biggest reasons Kaminsky came back to Wisconsin after last season was to prove that he could win a title for the Badgers and Bo Ryan. To do that he will not only have to score for his team, but also work tirelessly to defend the dominant Okafor. Okafor has not seen a match for him yet this season and the nation was hoping to see him take on Cauley-Stein or Towns, but Kaminsky is a formidable opponent. Okafor will also struggle defensively as he tries to chase Kaminsky and sophomore forward Nigel Hayes around the perimeter from where they are both excellent shooters. Wisconsin has a huge size advantage over Duke, but the Blue Devils’ aggressive trapping scheme has proved to be very effective in pressuring teams into taking bad shots or turning the ball over.
Another battle scouts are salivating over is the clash of Dekker and Winslow. Both have overshadowed their star centers this tournament as they have shot lights out from deep and, in Winslow’s case, been extremely good on defense as well. Dekker could increase his draft stock with a strong showing against probably the best wing in the current draft class, whereas Winslow is already being projected to be a pick in the 5-8 range after the Towns, Okafor, point guard Emmanuel Mudiay and Ohio State freshman point guard D’Angelo Russell quartet. Their contributions on both ends of the court will be vital if their team is to win the championship.
Finally, it all comes down to last clash, which is between two legendary coaches in Wisconsin’s Bo Ryan and Team USA and longtime Duke coach Mike Krzyzewski.
Coach K has reached this stage eight times before and won it four times. He is widely known as one of the best college coaches of all time. Ryan has shown he is no slouch as he’s already outwitted a coach of Kentucky’s John Calipari’s caliber to get here. As Wisconsin guns for it first title in 74 years, Coach K and the Blue Devils will try to ensure they have to wait at least one more year.

Women’s Golf
The Carnegie Mellon Women’s golf team took fourth place at the Purple and White Invitational over the weekend with a score of 738.
After a day-low 77 during the second round of the tournament, first-year Robin Tan followed up on a 91 during day one to tie for the best score at the tournament.
First-years Summer Kitahara and Emma Hoskins were tied for the lead after day one, each shooting an 85. Day one included a 101 from first-year Isabelle Tseng and a 105 from first-year Ginger Glass. Day two brought a 101 from Hoskins, a 98 from Tseng, and a 100 from Glass. Kitahara did not play the second day of the tournament.
As an individual, junior Yoon Hee Ha shot a 106 on day one and a 99 on day two for a 205 score for the overall tournament.
The team continues competition next weekend at the Westminster College spring invitational.
Women’s Tennis
The sixth-ranked Tartans moved to 12–5 on the season after an 8–1 victory over No. 20 University of Mary Washington.
The Tartans swept doubles competition with the team of senior Bryn Raschke and first-year Cori Sidell, the team of sophomore Vanessa Pavia and first-year Stacey Chang, and the team of sophomore Nicholle Torres and junior Brooke Tsu winning 8–5, 8–3, and 8–1 respectively.
In singles play, Pavia took her match at the start of singles play 6–0, 6–1. In the second spot, senior Angela Pratt won her match 4–6, 6–2, 1–0. In the third spot, Torres won 2–6, 6–1, 6–1. Tsu took her match in a tiebreaker 7–6 (9–7), 6–2. Sidell suffered the Tartans’ only defeat of the day, dropping her match 7–5, 6–2. Raschke rounded out singles competition with a 4–6, 6–1, 1–0 (10–7) victory.
The Tartans continue their season Thursday at University Athletic Association Championships.
Men’s Tennis
The No. 9 Tartans defeated No. 12 Case Western Reserve University 6–3 to move to 13–5 for the season.
Seniors Will Duncan and Christian Heaney-Secord secured the only Tartan’s victory in doubles play with an 8–6 win. Sophomore team Jack Kasbeer and Kenny Zheng as well as the team of senior Bryce Beisswanger and junior Yuvraj Kumar both dropped 8–6.
The Tartans took five of six singles matches. Junior Abhishek Alla won 6–2, 6–3, while Heaney-Secord took the Tartans’ sole hit in singles play, dropping 6–1, 6–4. Duncan recovered, however, winning his match 7–6, 6–2. Zheng won his match 6–1, 6–4. Sophomore Kunal Wadwani picked up his match in three sets, winning 6–1, 2–6, 6–0. Sophomore Kiril Kirkov lost a first set before recovering to win his match as well, 5–7, 6–4, 6–3.
The men’s tennis team also competed on Sunday. The Tartans continue their season Saturday against Mary Washington.

With a 5–1 conference record — including a sweep of conference power West Virginia University (WVU) to finish the fall season — the Carnegie Mellon Club Baseball team is poised to grab the Tartans’ first-ever District title.
The series with WVU brought no shortage of excitement. The first two games featured offensive explosions from the Tartans, who scored 25 runs in a pair of big wins. Junior civil  and environmental engineering major Darren Kerfoot, who had pitched five innings in the game one victory, was called upon to close out game three. With the Tartans ahead by one and runners on second and third base with one out, Kerfoot recorded consecutive strikeouts to seal the game and hand the Tartans the 7–6 victory.
The wins have put Carnegie Mellon in the driver’s seat heading into the spring portion of the season. Despite pitching injuries leaving the Tartans with a 2–2 record at their spring break tournament, the team expects more results like those WVU games for the rest of the season.
The team works hard despite limited practice time and makes a point of not getting tied up in how other teams are playing in order to focus on their own game. “[The team plays] really hard, just need to stick to that,” Kerfoot said.
The team’s active recruitment has made Carnegie Mellon baseball more visible, which has led to a wider talent pool and very strong team this season.
The team will need it to achieve the farthest of their goals. According to Kerfoot, this year’s National Club Baseball Association World Series is in Pittsburg, Kan., which would make representatives from Pittsburgh, Penn.. feel right at home. While the Tartans have a long road ahead of them before they set their sights that far ahead, a conference lead is a good place to start.
With a three game set against California University of Pennsylvania (CUP) approaching, the Tartans can soon get themselves back on the path to the conference title.
The team has one other important goal, off the diamond. Carnegie Mellon is currently the only school in the UAA without a varsity baseball team. In his first interview with The Tartan, Kerfoot was quoted as saying “I also really hope to get Carnegie Mellon baseball to become an NCAA sport before I graduate,” and the team is quite close to achieving that feat. There are several important factors to consider, but each key requirement for a varsity team is reachable. The athletics department wants a varsity baseball team, so the Carnegie Mellon club has lots of support in their quest to become varsity. There are several high schools with baseball fields close enough that Carnegie Mellon will have a home field within driving distance required by NCAA. There are several available indoor practice facilities, so the Carnegie Mellon team will be able to practice baseball year round and remain competitive. Finally, the available facilities will likely make it possible to recruit a women’s softball team, creating even more opportunities for varsity athletics on campus. However, the main hurdle is gathering support from local communities. “Our biggest challenge is getting people to know us and respect us,” Kerfoot said, “and all that will come from winning.”
This team has put up no shortage of wins recently and will likely be a varsity team in the coming years.
Due to several cancellations, the team will resume conference play for the spring this weekend with their matchup against CUP.

Medicine and technology are a unique and important combination. Scientists’ understanding of diseases has changed significantly in recent years due to new insights provided by advanced techniques. 
Michael Miller, a professor of biomedical and electrical and computer engineering at Johns Hopkins University and the director of the Center for Imaging Science, visited Carnegie Mellon last week as part of the seminar series for Carnegie Mellon and the University of Pittsburgh’s joint Ph.D. program in Computational Biology (CPCB), and shared his work on using images to better understand the progression of neurodegenerative diseases.
Miller described his field as computational anatomy. His group’s goal is to develop new techniques to analyze images relating structure to disease. Computational anatomy is not a novel idea, and others have attempted in the past to capitalize on the power of computation and the clarity of imaging. However, Miller’s group has developed an efficient method to compare images to determine which aspects of structure have changed over time.
Their approach is very involved and utilizes the tools of linear algebra to effortlessly understand the changes between two pictures. A parallel can be drawn to the games we played as kids where we had to find the differences between two images. Miller’s team developed a method to look at each point in an image and compare it to a relative point on a similar image. The goal is to determine whether the point of interest has changed in any way relative to shape or size.
This approach is related to diffeomorphism, which is the metric study of shape and form. Using two dimensional or three dimensional images, Miller and his team develop vector fields for each image and then compare the vector fields to determine differences. Therefore, each image is compared to both itself and the other image.
Miller provided an great example to explain his method. Using a map of the world, Miller showed points on South America and Africa. In his explanation, the shapes of the continents fit together like puzzle pieces as determined by their algorithm. Each point uses the information of its neighboring points to determine is position and relation to the image which allows for a unique analysis. An animation showed how the two continents joined based on the points analyzed by Miller’s method. When Miller removed the ability for points to share information with each other, the result was chaos. The continents in the image transformed into something unrecognizable. This example showed how powerful Miller’s method could be.
The images are coupled into a network that allows scientists to determine the flow of possible changes to an image. The goal of this project is to determine the structural changes that occur with disease. Miller and his group utilized a collection of images that allowed them compare individuals with Alzheimer’s to healthy controls. They focused on the hippocampus region of the brain, which is known to play a role in the disease.
In addition to comparing to healthy controls, Miller and his group compared patients’ brains before and after the symptoms appear. Many of the patients undergo MRIs due to risk for the disease and, within 5 – 10 years, they develop the disease. This allows Miller and his team to create a time course of the structural changes in the brain upon the advancement of Alzheimer’s.
Using statistical models, Miller and his team decipher which changes are important and possibly relevant to the disease. They identified specific areas that show significant change in relation to Alzheimer’s disease. These results will allow scientists to have a better understanding of the disease as well as identify which areas of the brain should be targeted by therapeutic drugs.

TechBridgeWorld, a research group under Carnegie Mellon University’s Field Robotics Institute, received the Louis Braille Touch of Genius Price for Innovation for the year of 2014. The $20,000 prize is distributed to multiple organizations and individuals every year in hopes of honoring those who implement innovative technologies to help improve the field of tactile literacy. The Automated Braille Tutor, developed by students and researchers in TechBridgeWorld, was awarded $15,000 out of the $20,000 for its developments and impact on partnering institutes from around the world.
TechBridgeWorld was founded in 2004 by M. Bernardine Dias, an associate research professor in Carnegie Mellon’s Robotics Institute. The goal of this research group aims to blend together advancements in technology and their implementations in lesser known communities. In particular, TechBridgeWorld focuses on helping people who live in developing countries and people with disabilities in the areas of education and assistance. 
The Automated Braille Tutor exemplifies a blend of these two fields by providing assistive technology to those who are blind to help improve literacy. Other projects that TechBridgeWorld has been involved with include NavPal, a mobile application aimed to help aid indoor navigation for blind and deafblind users, and Assistive Robots for Blind Travelers.
The Automated Braille Tutor project was started in 2006 by two robotics Ph.D. students, Nidhi Kalra and Tom Lauwers. Initially, the two students were invested in this project as an independent study through TechBridgeWorld. Kalra and Lauwers contacted and tested the tutor on students in the Mathru School for the Blind, in Bengaluru, India. Teachers and students had positive feedback toward the proejct at the time. Over the years, due to its success, the study has been kept alive and continues to live through the support of students at Carnegie Mellon.
The first tutor device developed connects to a USB port on a laptop. The board has typical buttons that allow users to navigate through menu options, an enlarged center Braille cell, and a bottom slate portion with multiple Braille cells that mimic the typical Braille slates that are used with a stylus. Once the device is turned on, students hear instructions from the device teaching them about topics such as the alphabet, spelling, and numbers. The tutor’s software also implements the built-in voice of a Mathru teacher, who provides feedback to the actions of the student. For example, if the device was running through the alphabet, the automated voice would direct the student to press particular cells to spell out the respective letters. 
An important aspect to keep in mind is that in order for blind people to write, the construction of Braille writings need to be punched in from right to left with each letter’s mirror image. Once the writing is complete, the paper can then be turned over so that the tactile feedback can be read from left to right.
The use of the Braille Tutor not only benefits blind students by improving their literacy, but also entertains them. For example, the “Animal Game” plays an audio clip of the noise an animal makes, and in response, the student spells out the name of the animal that made the noise. Project manager of the Automated Braille Tutor, Ermine Teves, states that, hopefully, “giving them the means to enhance their literacy will allow them to become active members of society.” 
With a better understanding of reading and writing, blind people can pursue higher education, help teach others who are blind, and hold industrial and technical positions similar to those without disabilities. In general, the device has been received well by both students and teachers. For teachers, “the idea here is not to replace them,” Teves said. “We want to make their lives easier.”
Most teachers in Mathru are blind themselves, often making the process of teaching literacy difficult without any technical assistance. The need for a teacher to provide feedback to every student would not only be very time consuming, but would also cost a lot in terms of the financial investment in Braille paper.
Over the years, teachers and students have provided TechBridgeWorld with feedback on how to improve the design of the tutor. The most demanded request was a device that worked independently from a laptop. Since then, progress has been made with Stand Alone Automated Braille Tutors. A functional beginner’s device has been implemented and serves as a prototype, whereas intermediate and advanced tutors will be explored in the future. These standalone devices are powered by batteries and connect to mobile speakers to allow for mobility and ease of access.
Both undergraduate- and graduate-level students are involved with TechBridgeWorld. Innovative Student Technology Experience (iSTEP) is a 10-week summer internship program for TechBridgeWorld that heavily involves technology’s impacts on outside connections. 
Although 2015 will be the last year that iSTEP will be offered, the group of four students participating in the internship will work on furthering the research for the Automated Braille Tutor. The upcoming iSTEP team will pursue comparative user studies this summer to continue to enhance the new devices in Mathru.

We spend hours on our phones and computers, tapping away at the brightly colored screens in search of the next dopamine rush. Games like Candy Crush are designed to take advantage of our psychology and be as addictive as possible. For some users, this leads to massive amounts of in-game purchases, despite the fact that the game is ostensibly free to play. This week, Pugwash discussed the ethical issues that come up when games become dangerously close to gambling.
What may have started as an innocent way of passing time can quickly turn into an addiction. 
The line between games like Candy Crush or Trivia Crack and traditional games of chance like poker or slot machines is getting blurrier and blurrier. People fall into the “gambler’s fallacy,” the sort of thinking that causes slot players to continue paying money into the machine, thinking that if they just play one more round, they’ll be able to hit the jackpot (or the high score). And besides, what’s 99 cents here or $1.29 there?
The people who tend to suffer most from this behavior are primarily the uneducated and poor. State lotteries are often called the poor man’s tax for this reason, and it is for the same reason that there are laws against gambling or online poker. Pugwash discussed regulating online games in the same manner, but it acknowledged that regulating anything online gets a little difficult. 
Another proposed solution was to require a prominent notification of how much money users have spent on the game, similar to how cigarette packages in some countries graphically feature the consequences of smoking. This might help people who don’t realize how much they’re spending because it’s only charged in small amounts.
There was also some discussion of the various types of free games that have in-game purchases, or “freemium” games. They’re called that because while they may be free to play, the premium features cost extra. 
There are three main ways that developers make money on these games. One is to have in-game advertisements. Although this doesn’t cost the consumer any money, it isn’t very effective for making money, because each ad view is only worth a very small amount. Another is to have the game let everyone play a little for free, but limit the amount users can play. If you run out of gameplay, you either have to wait a set amount of time to store up more, or you can pay to play more right away. The other main way to make money is to have the entire game free, and no limits on play time, but to charge for extras that change the way the game looks or to increase users’ abilities in game.
While most traditional gamers look down upon the new genre of freemium games, a Pugwash member mentioned that he knew someone who had moved from working in traditional game development to working in the freemium world. He had been disappointed with the game industry not living up to its promises, like when a trailer for a game is not representative of actual gameplay. 
However, because there is very little feedback during development and because early sales are so important to making money, it continues to happen. He moved to freemium games because he saw their model as being better all around. The developer would make a game, and if people liked it, they would provide a continuous, sustainable source of income, instead of developers working behind closed doors hoping that there would be enough one-time purchases to make their work worth it. This person ended up leaving where he worked in the freemium industry, however, because the monetization was too much and it wasn’t as idyllic a model as he had hoped. Every feature he was putting into a game had to be justified to higher-ups as to how it would make more money. 
While it is interesting to see the freemium games as a different, more sustainable model for gaming, that is not what is actually happening. They still are just being exploited to earn as much money as they can.
Additionally, Pugwash discussed how to use the addictiveness of games for good. Visiting Pugwash was a Carnegie Mellon alumnus who now works at Duolingo, a free, online language-learning app. They use gamification to try and get people addicted to something beneficial. 
They’re looking into many of the same ways to earn money that the freemium games use, such as offering different cosmetic changes for money. However, they want to avoid making it “pay to play” or putting content behind a paywall, because in the end, their goal is to provide a free service.
Finally, Pugwash briefly mentioned how journalism is picking up similar techniques. Known as “clickbait,” a common practice is to have headlines that don’t give out very much information, but leave readers wondering, which causes them to click on the link and go to the news site. This gives the news organization more page views and ad revenue, but readers are often left thinking that the actual content didn’t live up to the headline. However, people continue to click on enticing headlines for the same reason they keep playing slots: Maybe this time it’ll be good. 
These practices do degrade journalistic integrity somewhat, but as long as news organizations need consumers’ money to run, they’ll do what they have to. BBC is an example of how a stable source of funding, separate from page views, can help combat clickbait.
The more we learn about how the human brain works, the more we’ll be able to optimize experiences that tickle our pleasure centers. These addicting techniques can be used for good, as Duolingo showed us with their language-learning app, or for purely profitable motives, like in the freemium game industry. To prevent people from being taken advantage of, Pugwash seemed to agree that there should be some regulations in place.

Are plants conscious? Do roses scream when their stems are cut? Can plants smell or hear? These are a handful of the questions that plant researchers have recently sought to answer. In the pursuit of discerning whether or not plants are intelligent, we are left asking ourselves, “What is intelligence?” and what it means to be able to smell or to hear.
Plant neurobiology is an emerging field of research which seeks to understand the mechanisms behind plants’ sensory and adaptive faculties. However, neurobiology is a misnomer since plants do not have nerve cells or a nervous system like animals do. The field’s acceptance has been set back by previous pseudoscientific experiments which “proved” that plants have emotions and can be affected by human thoughts, among other new-age ideas. Some legitimate neurobiologists now argue that plants possess structures that are analogous to a nervous system. Experiments studying plant sensation have shown evidence that plants live sensuous lives, perhaps possessing as many as twenty different sensory modalities.
Charles Darwin, the father of natural selection and evolutionary theory, partnered with his son Francis to perform many experiments on the roots — or “reticles” — of plants. Darwin hypothesized that plants behave like upside-down animals, with the roots (the brain) underneath the soil, and the sex organs (flowers, seeds and pollen) on the outside. 
Michael Pollan, a writer for The New Yorker, asserts in his article, “The Intelligent Plant,” that plant roots can sense not only moisture, light, pressure, gravity, and hardness, but can also sense salts, toxins, volume, chemical signals from nearby plants, as well as determining whether nearby roots are kindred or stranger and therefore if it should cooperate or compete with them. The Darwinian view takes these senses into account and claims that the root is the most analogous structure to the brain in animals, though plants and animals are so different that even analogous comparisons are fuzzy.
The mechanisms of plants’ senses, however, are getting less fuzzy. Recent research by Frank Kuhnemann and a team of scientists at the Institute for Applied Physics at the University of Bonn have found, through highly complex experiments, that plants can be said to scream when they experience trauma, such as having their stems or leaves cut. 
When plants are traumatized in this way, they release a hormone called ethylene, which causes ripening. When the gaseous hormone is captured and vibrated through laser bombardment, it produces sound waves which are recorded via microphones. According to Kuhnemann, the more stress the plant has incurred, the more intense the sound will be.
Ethylene is also a prime example of a plant’s ability to smell. The sense of smell is, at its most basic level, the ability of organisms to take in airborne chemical signals, interpret them, and react to them. Ethylene causes ripening in nearby plants in exactly this way — one plant will release the hormone into the air, and nearby plants will take it in. This is why people store ripening fruit in paper bags; it traps the ethylene and allows the fruit to more easily communicate with each other and ripen at the same time. 
There are also parasitic plants called “dodder vines” which are able to “sniff out” plants they find most delicious. “Given the choice of tomato or wheat, the dodder picks the tomato,” said plant biologist Consuelo M. De Moraes of Pennsylvania State University, a member of the team that conducted the experiment.
Perhaps the most controversial finding in the realm of plant neurobiology is the idea that plants can learn. Monica Gagliano, an animal ecologist at the University of Western Australia, studied the plant Mimosa pudica. Mimosa is known as “the sensitive plant” because its leaves instantly collapse when touched, a reflex thought to frighten attacking insects. Gagliano wanted to see if she could condition the fifty-six plants to learn to ignore an innocuous stimulus through a type of learning called habituation. She dropped the plants repeatedly from a safe distance about sixty times per trial, and after some time, the plants habituated to, or ignored, the stimulus of being dropped. 
What was even more interesting was that the plants were able to hold onto this information for at least a month. The plants exhibited not only a form of rudimentary learning, but a form of long-term memory as well. The mechanisms by which this occurs are still under examination, but recent hypotheses have surmised that plant memory might be due to changes in genetic expression.
Perhaps the root of the rich sensory experiences of plants can be attributed to their immobility. This evolutionary constriction severely limits plants’ abilities to escape predators and survive. In order for this seemingly crippling modality to carry through generation after generation, it has to be conducive to plants’ successful survival. The root of a plant, as stated by Darwin, is essentially the most “conscious” area. One of the most intriguing root-based interactions, apart from the highly sensitive sensory capabilities, is the phenomenon of the “wood-wide web.” 
Michael Pollan writes about an experiment performed by Suzanne Simard from the University of British Columbia, in which the team injected fir trees with a radioactive carbon isotope and followed their spread throughout the forest community. They established that there is an underground network of fungi called mycelium which is used by stronger, older trees to feed young saplings. Evergreen firs would also trade sugars with deciduous trees during the cold months, and the evergreens would call in those debts later on; Pollan calls this system of underground commerce an “underground economy,” which is beneficial to all involved.
The realm of plant neurobiology may not be well funded or popular among scholars, but there are great ramifications in the study of plants. 
By studying the sensory abilities of organisms so different from ourselves, we break free from potentially egocentric ideas that nervous systems are inherently necessary for intelligence, and we gain insight into the rich lives and capabilities of the life all around us. 
So next time you trudge through a forest or buy a bouquet of fresh-cut roses, think of the rich economy of fungus and fir, and the faint screams of agony coming silently from those flowers.

Energy-saving exoskeleton makes walking easier
Engineers at Carnegie Mellon University have recently developed a mechanical exoskeleton boot that, in comparison to normal footwear, reduces the energy expenditure of walking by 7 percent. The device is the first of its kind to not rely on an outside power source.
In the exoskeleton boot, a mechanical clutch is used to hold a spring that expands and contracts during ankle movements. When a person swings their leg forward to walk, the clutch locks into place and the spring expands, allowing the spring to store elastic energy. Once the leg pushes down on the ground, propelling the body forward, the clutch loosens and the elastic energy is released as the spring slackens. In turn, this process can reduce the energy needed from the wearer’s calf muscle.
The team hopes their product will be commercially available to consumers who want to improve walking efficiency, particularly those with walking difficulties. A report was published in the journal Nature.

Scientists plan to send man to planet Mars by 2033
According to space experts, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) may be able to fund a project that could send humans into Mars’ orbit by 2033, and allow the first human to walk on the surface of Mars by 2039.
A discussion about the cost of the project occurred during a workshop hosted by the Planetary Society. The event took place in Washington, D.C. According to Bill Nye, who is the CEO of the Planetary Society, the Mars program would be affordable once NASA leaves its lead role in the International Space Station. During the estimated 30 months of the Mars orbital mission, crew members would be able to study the moons of Mars, as well as possibly remotely operate rovers on the Martian surface. 
However, the experts believe that the biggest hurdle in starting the project lies within politics. It was announced that the mission architecture, which has until now been closed to the public and press, will be released later this year.

New biosensing platform may help diagnose disease
Researchers at Florida Atlantic University, along with other collaborators, have created a novel biosensing platform that may be able to remotely diagnose and identify treatment options for HIV and bacterial infections, such as Staphylococcus aureus. According to their article in Nature, the researchers developed biosensors with low-cost paper and flexible materials that contain electrical and optical sensing modalities, which are reported to be easy to make and use. 
The researchers have also developed a complementary phone app that can use photos to diagnose bacterial diseases in the patient’s blood. The researchers believe that their methods may help to create affordable tools in diagnostics and health monitoring, particularly in poorer countries with limited access to resources and laboratory infrastructure. 
This new platform could also be altered in order to diagnose diseases and pathogens other than HIV and bacterial infections.

New test could improve detection of prostate cancer
Researchers at the University of Central Florida have discovered a simple test that uses gold nanoparticles to detect early-stage prostate cancer.
The test involves mixing only a couple drops of blood with gold nanoparticles. If the patient has prostate cancer, biomarkers present in his or her blood from his or her immune response will attach to the nanoparticles and cause them to clump together. The size of the nanoparticles is then measured through a technique called nanoparticle-enabled dynamic light scattering assay. Larger nanoparticles indicate cancer growth.
This new test offers a variety of benefits over traditional methods, as it costs less than $1 and can provide results within minutes. Initial studies of the test have also shown it to be more sensitive and more accurate than standard prostate specific antigen (PSA) screenings. The transition from PSA screenings to this new technology could also decrease the number of patients required to receive invasive biopsies.

3.67 million-year-old fossil found in central South Africa
A rare Australopithecus skeleton discovered in a cave in central South Africa about twenty years ago has been estimated to be 3.67 million years old, making it one of oldest hominid skeletons ever dated. The skeleton was previously believed to be about  3 million years old. 
Known as Little Foot, this ancestor was determined to predate Lucy, the famed 3.2 million-year-old Australopithecus skeleton that was found in Ethiopia in 1974. With Little Foot, scientists were able to conclude that the earliest australopithecines existed in South Africa.
However, the species that australopithecine Little Foot belongs to remains unknown among scientists. Additionally, based on the findings, scientists have concluded that there was a great diversity of human ancestors in various locations in Africa. Furthermore, evidence from Little Foot may disclose the particular region and species that led to the emergence of the modern human race.

Dinosaur couple found buried together in Mongolia
Researchers at the University of Alberta have identified a dinosaur couple that had been buried together for more than 75 million years. The remains were uncovered in the Gobi desert in Mongolia.
According to the report in the journal Scientific Reports, the dinosaurs, a pair of oviraptors, had possessed different physical characteristics, enough to indicate that they were male and female. Since the oviraptor couple was bird-like, the researchers compared the remains to the anatomy of modern birds. The researchers were then able to identify physical traits that could have allowed for courtship to take place between the two dinosaurs.
It is believed that the oviraptors were killed when a sand dune collapsed and buried them alive. Hence, researchers nicknamed the dinosaur couple “Romeo and Juliet.”

Friday and Saturday evening, Scotch ‘n’ Soda daughter organization Tisbert Sketch Comedy put on its spring show. Modeled after some classic kids’ shows, Sketch by the Foot combined an amusing plot line surrounding the cash-strapped cast of the titular show with Tisbert’s usual mix of sketches about completely mundane situations gone mildly wrong in hilarious fashion. Each transition featured an updated remix of theme music from children’s shows from 15 to 20 years ago.
The night opened with first-year Dietrich College student Briana Hudock explaining that Tisbert Inc. had fallen on some hard times and that, to get by, they needed help from their new “friends” — “can you say corporate sponsor?” — Go-Gurt. The ancient yogurt-like snack tube … things … made frequent appearances and added a late ‘90s to early 2000s feel that fit the backdrop of the show nicely. Hudock’s monologue drew heavily on similar opening scenes from the always-relevant Dora the Explorer, the first in a series of blatant homages to the Nick Jr. classic.
The cast then came on and introduced themselves in a way reminiscent of Zoom and other similar shows from the turn of the millennium. First-year vocal performance major Russell H. Holbert even introduced himself with a middle initial, a necessary element of such a throwback. Each character had their own kids’ show archetype and accompanying explanation, featuring a “cute leader,” a “tough one,” a “smart one,” a “crazy one,” and, of course, the cast baby. By this point I was fairly worried I was going to see an endless round of gags on the shows I barely remember from my childhood, but luckily there was much more in store.
One of the high points of the show was easily a bit of fan service delivered by senior electrical and computer engineering and creative writing double major Brad Plaxen and senior BSA student Alex Petti. After a benign collision, the two lost their shirts and nearly came to blows before realizing that fists is not how they fight at this particular bar. Each then donned a cowboy hat, and, as Hudock counted them in, took three steps back in an old west style shootout. After a quick victory, Plaxen jumped onto junior BHA student Sam Riordan’s back and declared “Welcome to PHI,” a tribute to Carnegie Mellon’s favorite bar.
The show was not without its missteps, though. One scene, featuring girl scouts whose troop leader was replaced by some sort of military character, was funny but ultimately fell on its face. Hudock, Holbert, and Riordan excellently portrayed terrified girl scouts and nearly saved the scene as Petti, their new troop leader, attempted to scare them into being more efficient salespeople. Petti, however, did not help matters. His character featured an accent that seemed like it was going for Vietnam War Veteran, but only made the scene kind of awkward. Even his last quip about becoming addicted to black tar heroin in Vietnam was misplaced, weird, and somewhat confusing.
The kids’ show gags eventually came back, and were still as fresh and exciting as the first time around, despite my fears. Riordan informed the audience that Holbert was missing because he is a kleptomaniac. Holbert, who was excellent for every moment he was on stage, proceeded to run to different parts of the room, struggling to steal things from the auditorium. After an audience led search around Porter Hall 100, the cast finally caught Holbert on stage, and proceeded to convince him he needed to get help with three chants of “Russell no stealing!”
In addition to some of the more shameless rips from popular culture, the more original features of the kids’ show setting were excellent. As the audience entered Porter Hall 100, they were asked to write letters to the cast members. Plaxen, for some reason the only cast member not wearing a solid black shirt, sat down on a stool with the letters by his side and read some of them. Two were scripted, but Plaxen navigated the pair of bizarre and unscripted letters he did pick up seamlessly, managing to both draw on his role as “the tough one” and accidentally let slip that Tisbert Inc. was actually the Illuminati.
The Go-Gurt soaked adventure through the TV show ended when the product placement cash was not quite enough to keep the lights on through the duration of one last song and dance. But while it lasted, Sketch by the Foot, when it hit, showcased more of Scotch ‘n’ Soda’s talent for escalation and absurdism.
As the cast — and totally not Dora the Explorer — would say, muy bien!

Skibo Café isn’t the first place you’d expect to hear live, soulful, acoustic renditions of some of your favorite songs. And yet, a small musical miracle occured last Thursday evening, when Skibo played host to a smattering of independent campus musicians, all of whom played their hearts out in an attempt to enthrall those lucky enough to be present. Some of the music was utterly breathtaking and some of it comparatively ordinary. The sheer intimacy of the setting, however ensured one thing: All of the music was brutally honest. The entire evening felt more like a bunch of close friends just messing around on stage with their instruments than artists performing at a concert.
Although called “Activities Board Presents: Varun Gadh,” the evening was really about so much more than just one guy. He was joined on stage by several others through his set, including an extremely talented percussionist, a female lead who completely stole the show while on stage, and two violinists for the grand finale of the evening. Not to mention, he was opened for by a spectacular duo that played for quite a while — probably more than half an hour.
Sophomore ethics, history, & public policy major Dhruva Krishna and first-year international relations and politics major Dave Matvey seemed so at home on stage that I found it hard to believe them when they told me they don’t routinely perform together. They had the kind of chemistry with each other and the audience that simply cannot be manufactured or practiced. It turns out that they were simply doing the Skibo thing as a one-off for Gadh. When I told them I’d be writing a review, and asked them to name themselves for my benefit, they went with “Benjamin Piatt Runkle,” in a show of extreme reverence for one of their Sigma Chi fraternity co-founders.
They were outstanding as individual musicians as well. Krishna is obviously a very good guitarist, yet his method is restrained and measured in a way that doesn’t make his talent instantly apparent. As a result, although his chord work has no shortage of character, it allows Matvey to take the lead with the vocals. Dave has all the charisma a frontman needs and then some. He effectively channels a combination of Kurt Cobain, Dave Matthews and Jason Mraz. This works really well, as it allows him to switch from rebellious and brash to sensitive and caring at the shift of a chord. Half an hour later, by the time Benjamin Piatt Runkle left the stage, expectations for Gadh were sky high.
Coming on stage with his percussionist, first-year economics major Ariana Mapua, freshman mechanical engineering major Varun Gadh started out with an original called “Shadow On The Wall.” “Shadow” is a fine song, with some amazing lyrics and what seemed like an unusual time signature. And yet, both he and Mapua seemed somewhat nervous and withdrawn throughout the song, as if they were still warming up to the stage. They weren’t as comfortable in the spotlight as the previous duo, and were trying visibly harder to please the audience. While it took them another couple of songs to get in the mood of things, there was no looking back once they did. What soon followed was an amazing cover of Bill Wither’s “Ain’t No Sunshine.”
The two of them play off of each other’s styles well. Gadh has a fine singing voice, and he knows which directions he can take it in without pushing too far. Ari effectively fills in the spaces he leaves behind with some genuinely stunning fills on her Cajon. One of their standouts was the difficult bridge from “Sunshine,” which started simple before building into a grand crescendo, following a crash and leading into the chorus — they completely nailed it.
The indisputable highlight of the evening, however, was when sophomore vocal performance major Mara Yaffee joined Gadh about halfway through the evening. The way they played, the way their voices harmonized, and the way their every move seemed to fit in lockstep was a sight to behold. Watching them play, I got the feeling that they were playing more for the fun of it, and for each other, than for the audience. They opened with a haunting acoustic cover of Soundgarden’s “Black Hole Sun.” “Black Hole Sun” is not an easy song to cover. These guys didn’t just cover it, they went ahead and changed it up. It takes no small amount of courage to do that. By the time they closed with Simon & Garfunkel’s “Mrs. Robinson,” they had won nearly everyone in Skibo over with their earnestness and charm. Although the finale was yet to come, the evening undoubtedly crescendoed with Yaffee’s time on stage.
The finale itself was underwhelming. The two violins that joined Gadh and his group onstage were completely drowned out by the guitar, since they hadn’t been set up all that well. I couldn’t make out much of the lyrics or vocals either. But by that point, it didn’t matter. Opening your heart up to strangers is supposed to be one of the most difficult things in the world. I’d just seen strangers open their hearts up to me and about thirty more people, through music. Although the evening wasn’t perfect, it was most definitely inspiring.

English indie-rock band alt-J performed to a huge audience on April 2 at the sold-out Benedum Center downtown. alt-J, with band members Joe Newman (guitar/lead vocals), newly recruited Cameron Knight (guitar/bass), Gus Unger-Hamilton (keyboards/vocals) and Thom Green (drums), has become famous for their unique sound and haunting lyrics. These musical features have caused the band to carve out a brand of music all their own. Upon entering the beautiful venue, one found a full house calmly chatting in their seats. This isn’t a crowd you would expect to get rowdy, but it was able, eventually, to evolve into a gathering place for devotees of alt-J music’s lyrical depth.
Opening for alt-J was Tycho, where Scott Hansen, an “ambient music” artist and producer from San Francisco, displayed his talent for both techno music and harmonic artistry. His design skills were evident in the mesmerizing displays during his set, which featured mixed elements of beautiful photography and bold graphic styles that matched the lighting of the stage. Playing mostly tracks from his most recent album, 2014’s Awake, Tycho filled the hall with a glistening tone and took the audience on a carefully curated journey. The set was enhanced by his live backing band, whose energy made the performance much more interesting to watch. Though most of the audience stayed seated, 100 some remained entranced for the set and it served as the perfect opener for alt-J.
After Tycho and his band cleared the stage, bright lights rose up over the audience. The audience rose too as the first waves of “Hunger of the Pine” resonated through the building. Accompanying the band members on stage were dynamic LED lights that punctuated every note and set the mood of the entire space as alt-J moved through their set. Their set did an amazing job of flipping between tracks from their most recent album, This Is All Yours, and their first, An Awesome Wave; punctuating more trance-like songs such as melodic “Matilda,” with the arguably more upbeat and pop-sounding “Left Hand Free.” “Every Other Freckle” was a mesmerizing piece, with lights illuminating each band member as they played their part in a sophisticated marriage of light and sound. Unsurprisingly, alt-J excelled both with their lesser known ballads like “Dissolve Me” and with crowd favorites like “Tessellate,” greatly due to the range of Newman’s vocals.
Returning for an encore, the band moved through “Nara,” the three-piece song from their most recent album. The track brings a slightly more narrative nature to the album. Their set ended with my personal favorite “Breezeblocks,” an eerie love song that was much more affecting live than on record. This concert was very enjoyable primarily because of the dedication of the fans in the audience, who knew every word and key change by heart. Overall, alt-J delivered a captivating live performance, matching the talent level fans have come to expect from a group of this caliber. I certainly plan to see them again soon, hopefully in a festival setting so everyone can really get up and dance.

After a lengthy renovation the former Pizza Sola location on Atwood Street reopened a couple weeks ago as the location of Top Shabu-Shabu & Lounge. The restaurant was packed, although it was hard to determine how much of that came from the place being new and how much came from the popularity of the Japanese take on the traditional hot pot style of cooking. Either way, wait times for large parties can be very long and Top Shabu-Shabu does not take reservations, so you may want to plan on arriving early. 
The first thing I noticed when I stepped into the restaurant was the rich smell of dozens of soups being cooked, each spiced to an individual patron’s taste and flavored with their choice of meats, veggies, noodles, tofu, seafood, and almost anything else you might want to fill a pot of soup with. 
If you’re not familiar with shabu-shabu, you may be wondering why the whole place smells like soup. Unlike beef fondue, which uses heated oil to flash fry what you put in it — or some interpretations of hot pot where boiling water or a very light stock is used as the basis for your soup —  shabu-shabu uses pre-packaged cans of rich flavored soup. 
Unfortunately, during my visit, Top Shabu-Shabu only had two choices of flavor available: a very spicy hot option, and a mild hambone flavored white soup. On the plus side, both were excellent, the spicier option imparted its flavor nicely into chunks of fried tofu or slices of chicken breast. The white soup had a milder flavor profile that allowed me to to fully avail myself of the “sauce bar,” a collection of oils, spices, and premade sauces like Sriracha that you can mix and match to create a staggering number of options. My favorite was a mixture of some garlic, chives and hot sauce into sesame oil for a sweeter flavor with a bit of a kick. 
It was over all a very fun dining experience; three friends and I split the check evenly and for about fifteen dollars a person we were able to get three different kinds of noodle, fried tofu, shrimp, potato slices, a plate of chicken and both a meat and vegetable assortment platter. Mastery of chopsticks proved necessary, as you need to hold onto your meat for the 15 seconds it usually takes to cook, otherwise you would need to fish it out of the surprisingly deep pot of boiling soup with a ladle, which could prove somewhat frustrating. 
I didn't have the opportunity to try the more traditional foods on offer, but they seemed very popular with some of the other tables, and our server was kind enough to help us figure out some good things to order off of the extensive menu. He also had to tell us that they currently did not have a number of items, which was disappointing. 
Another disappointment came in the form of the drinks. Despite applying for an alcohol license, during my visit Top Shabu-Shabu had not gotten it yet, which meant the handsome dark wood bar was mainly just for show. My server also advised me not to get the tea since it was overpriced without free refills, which relegated me and my companions to filtered ice water. Some enterprising patrons did bring their own outside drinks though, so if I were you I’d bring your own favorite white wine or a sixer of a lighter Dutch or German style beer. 
The restaurant was a bit loud and my party occasionally had trouble hearing each other across the wide table, but the atmosphere overall was energetic and youthful, much like the crowd. One of my dining companions said he would bring a first date there, but his girlfriend said she wasn't so sure how impressed she would have been.
Personally, I enjoyed myself and the food and I’m willing to chalk some of the absences and shortcomings to the place still gaining its footing. If you've got a few friends who you can share the large portions with and you want a relaxed evening, Top Shabu-Shabu at 114 Atwood Street in Oakland is a solid choice.

Last Friday night, Carnegie Mellon’s a cappella groups came together to perform in the No Instruments Aloud 2015 concert, hosted by the Originals. The groups who performed were Originals, C#, Treblemakers, Soundbytes, and Counterpoint.
The Originals took the stage in their classic shirt-and-tie combo, and entertained the crowd with everyone’s latest musical obsession, “Uptown Funk” by Mark Ronson and Bruno Mars. The Original’s amazing energy and in-your-face charisma on stage had the audience, quite literally, bouncing along to the beat. Everyone loved it.
Following an awkward and slightly rushed MC blunder, Carnegie Mellon’s newest a cappella group, C#, took the stage. They looked ravishing in red as they opened their performance with Florence and the Machine’s “Never Let Me Go.” Their intricate dance moves and powerful voices made it hard to tell that this was one of C#’s first performances. They kept the crowd entertained all the way up to their comical take on the Taylor Swift song everyone loves to hate and hates to love, “We Are Never Ever Getting Back Together.” The only thing more impressive than C#’s vocals was their commitment to humor.
Taking the stage in their classic and recognizable gold and black ensembles, Treblemakers performed their diverse set. Although it has started to warm up for the spring season, their beautiful performance of “Sweater Weather” by The Neighbourhood reminded us of colder times. Treblemakers ended their piece with an exciting and crowd pleasing performance of Charli XCX’s “Boom Clap.” Treblemakers had all the components of a strong a cappella performance, including strong vocals, great song choices, and high energy. But after such a charismatic performance from Originals, and a delightfully humorous ending to C#’s piece, Treblemakers’s performance left something to be desired.
After intermission, the crowd was welcomed back with the concert’s next performers, Soundbytes. Soundbytes did a spectacular job putting a soulful spin on an Elton John classic, “Bennie and the Jets.” Judging by the applause, Soundbytes’ next song choice, “I See Fire” by Ed Sheeran, was also a crowd favorite. The performance was strong and powerful, and it left the crowd on the edge of their seats. The group kept up their energy and momentum well into their third piece, and kept the crowd entertained from start to finish. They closed with an oddly true and painfully relevant “Ain’t It Fun” by Paramore.
Next on stage was Carnegie Mellon’s only all female a cappella group, Counterpoint. The group reminded the audience to always be themselves with their interpretation of Sara Bareilles’ hit song “Brave.” Counterpoint then took a moment to honor senior dramaturgy major Rachel Abrams, who then sang an edgy “Boy” by Little Mix. The “Boy” performance had the potential to be a moment for female empowerment, but in the end fell flat. The group’s voices were together and were quite strong, but the song choice did not have everyone in the audience on the same page. Counterpoint closed their performance on a high note, however, with the popular Katy Perry song, “Dark Horse.” The crowd appreciated both the popular song choice and the group’s commitment to singing the entirety of Juicy J’s rap segment at the end of the song.
To close out the evening, Originals returned to the stage looking sleek and classic in new black shirts and ties. They opened their second set with a beautiful rendition of “Ghost” by Ella Henderson. Originals definitely wowed the crowd during their performance, but they somehow outdid themselves the second time around when they utilized the entire stage to perform new and improved dance moves and intricate formations. The group then serenaded the audience with a mash up of Justin Timberlake and Ella Fitzgerald’s “Cry Me A River”.
Originals then left the stage, and at this point the audience was absolutely content and thoroughly impressed with their performance. But then, in full concert fashion, the hosts once again returned and surprised the audience with a trip through all of our childhoods. The group sang a medley of hits from our friend in a pineapple under the sea, Spongebob SquarePants. The crowd was thoroughly entertained with such songs as “The Campfire Song” and “The Goofy Goober Song.”
Overall, all of the groups who performed made the night an exciting one. Joyful Noise was unable to be in attendance during No Instruments Aloud 2015, but we encourage everyone to watch the group perform on May 2 in the College of Fine Arts. We also encourage you to watch and support all of Carnegie Mellon’s amazing a cappella superstars in all of their upcoming performances.

April 1 came and went this week. To most, it means April Fools’ Day, a day to screw with your friends and have fun. But for me, it means my Grandma’s Sue’s birthday. She would have turned 66 this year. I’m still not very good at talking about how much I miss her. So instead, I want to celebrate her the best way I know how: a cake.
I’ll forever associate this cake with Grandma Sue. It was one of her favorites, and for a good reason. It is delicious and it’s her recipe. When she passed away, her recipe card got added to my mom’s book, and we’ve been making it for as many occasions as possible ever since. The bottom layer is a rich chocolate pecan cake. Then as soon as that comes out of the oven, it gets a generous spread of marshmallow fluff, which just melts into the warm cake. And finally on top is some of the sweetest chocolate frosting you’ll ever taste.
I wish she could be here today to eat cake with me and see that I’ve grown out of my moody-boy-crazy-glued-to-my-phone teenager phase. But since that’s just not how life works, I’d just like to say “cheers” to her, wherever she is out there, and hope that she’s proud of me.
Cake
2 sticks of margarine, room temperature
1½ cups of flour
2 cups of sugar
4 eggs
1 teaspoon of vanilla
3 tablespoons of cocoa powder
1½ cups of pecans
Toppings
7 ounce jar of marshmallow fluff
1 stick of margarine
4 cups of powdered sugar
1/3 cup of cocoa powder
1 teaspoon of vanilla extract
¼ cup of water
Directions
There are some parts of this recipe that I would change if it weren’t the treasured family recipe that it is. For example, in my kitchen, margarine over butter is a sin. I would probably also substitute whole milk for water in the frosting because the more fat the better! I also wouldn’t include the specifications about glass versus metal pans because this is college and I use the foil pans you can buy at the grocery store. Those with less emotional attachment to the authentic version of the recipe can feel free to make those changes!
First of all, preheat your oven to 300 degrees if your pan is metal, or 285 if it’s glass (either way, it should be 9x13). Then mix together the margarine, flour, sugar and eggs for about a minute until they’re all smooth. Then add everything else. So fast and so easy! Spread the batter out into the pan and let it bake for about 45 minutes. As soon as it comes out of the oven, cover the whole top with marshmallow fluff. The combination of hot cake and sticky marshmallow will most likely pull up the top of the cake and make the fluff layer all full of crumbs. Just keep spreading! The frosting will cover it up and it won’t make a difference.
Let the cake cool completely, and try to resist putting your face directly into the melting fluff. To keep yourself distracted, start to make the frosting. Begin by creaming the margarine. Mix it until it’s shiny and smooth. Start pouring in powdered sugar a little bit at a time, adding water when it gets too thick. After all the sugar and water have been mixed, add the cocoa powder and vanilla. Keep whipping it for a little longer so it can achieve maximum fluff. You owe the frosting the opportunity to be its best self. Finally, spread the finished product over the cooled fluff and cake, and that’s it!
A final warning: This cake isn’t for the weak. It’s probably the sweetest and richest dessert you’ll ever eat. My dad once said “I’d love to have it every week but it would kill me.” However, it’s exactly what you need if you’re a chocoholic, a dessert-fiend, or complete hedonist.

One would normally think that a singing competition is supposed to be about the singer, the voice, the performance, and ultimately whether or not the people being discovered actually get discovered and go on to make their music heard. While some shows have amassed Grammy winners, Academy Award Winners, and a few Emmys, others have come short. Over the years, viewership has shifted dramatically between shows and ironically, it has had very little impact on the contestant’s success post-competition.
American Idol started the trend in the US of having primetime singing competitions. During its first season, they found everything they needed in order to ensure continued success for years to come. Their formula was simple: Have a mean British producer that is honest and almost always right, a quirky pop star from the ’80s that has charm and is bubbly and somewhat crazy, and a lovable producer that also knows music but understands completely different genres than the first. With Simon Cowell, Paula Abdul, and Randy Jackson they had the perfect combination of people to judge a singing competition. This competition was focused not on judges though, but on the contestants and their growth as artists. In their first year they found one of the biggest pop idols. Kelly Clarkson has been a star since 2002 and she still continues to make music that people want to hear. This past week, American Idol dedicated the episode to her and had the contestants sing songs from her entire discography. Having been through the competition, she was a clear choice for coaching the contestants during the week and helping them find their voice through her music. American Idol has lost almost half of its viewership; they still, however, maintain the simple premise of the show and they continue to make artists that actually sell music. Of all the U.S. singing competitions, American Idol has sold the highest number of albums. Chart-topping alumni include Carrie Underwood, Daughtry, Fantasia, Ruben Studdard, Jennifer Hudson, Clay Aiken, Katharine McPhee, Adam Lambert, and Jordin Sparks.
Another show that has produced actually successful artists is The X-Factor, although the U.S. competition only produced three acts that can be considered successful: Alex & Sierra, Fifth Harmony, and Emblem3. The show was cut off short on its third season due to low viewership. This was really unfortunate because the show had a lot of potential as it was following in the steps of its British predecessor that launched artists such as as Leona Lewis, One Direction, JLS, Alexandra Burke, Little Mix, and Cher Lloyd. The X-Factor suffered the same fate that The Sing-Off suffered. The Sing-Off was also a not too popular singing competition, and right when they found a group that has had massive success, the network cancelled them. These unfortunate decisions have been rumored to possibly get reversed. In 2014, The Sing-Off had a one day special event competition that was marketed poorly and did not attract viewership; and The X-Factor might return in 2015 according to rumors from past judges of the show.
Finally, we have The Voice. This program has a wonderful concept; a very humane way of selecting acts based solely on their voice. However, the show has one very key flaw: The judges are competing against each other, and they are, except for Pharrell Williams, not known for being producers. Although this show has plenty of viewership and has topped ratings over American Idol, The X-Factor, and The Sing-Off, it still hasn’t been able to produce a single artist that has become a household name or has topped the Billboard Hot 100. Their highest charting artist peaked at 14 on Billboard and he was there for a mere week with a cover from another artist. Meanwhile, the judges that work on the show have released multiple albums in the four years, and eight seasons, that the show has been on, and have become even more successful and achieved greater visibility. The Voice is a great TV show because it’s about the judges, their relationships with each other, and their charisma; it is not about the singers or them finding their voice.
In the 13 years that singing competitions have been part of American TV culture, there has been a shift from shows focused on singing, to shows focused on judging. While the viewership and audiences have enjoyed this shift, musicians that participate in the shows have not benefited from this change since musicians that have come out of the highest-rated competitions have not been able to acquire mainstream recognition through their music. I believe that this is the main reason why American Idol is still going to remain the most relevant singing competition in the U.S.

The long-awaited public bashing of teen heartthrob and hairstyle trendsetter Justin Bieber finally aired on Monday. Comedy Central has aired 14 total roasts, including this most recent one, since it first started the Comedy Central Roast in 2003. The idea of a “roast,” of course, has been around longer than this particular television event, but Comedy Central’s roasts are the biggest and most spectacular roasts in existence. Justin Bieber is the youngest “roastee” to ever participate in the show, having just turned 21 in mid-March. The evening of insults, which can be viewed on the channel’s website, are sure to make viewers laugh uncontrollably and feel like terrible human beings at the same time. But the roast also was surprisingly thought provoking, begging the question of “What is the role of comedy in society?” and what that says about what people find funny.
The Bieber roast was seen by 4.4 million viewers, viewers who are presumably fascinated and frustrated by Bieber’s antics. As current college students represent the age group that grew up with Bieber, they have been close witnesses to Bieber’s rise and fall. Pete Davidson, the youngest cast member on Saturday Night Live and one of the roasters present Monday evening, even called Bieber out on being such a successful and wonderful member of “our generation.”
Other roasters present included Snoop Dogg — yes, he’s back to Dogg from Lion — Ludacris, Martha Stewart, Hannibal Buress, Natasha Leggero, Shaquille O’Neal, Jeff Ross, and Chris D’Elia. Kevin Hart served as an unbelievably funny roast master. Just seeing Hart and O’Neal playfully tussle with each other made the entire show worth it.
Davidson presented one of the most interesting and hilarious roasts of the evening. Much of a roaster’s job is to try to thoroughly destroy other roasters sitting on stage with carefully rehearsed punchlines, before roasting the roastee himself. Some of these jokes are offensive in such a way that they push comedy farther than audiences are used to, and some are insensitive and clearly hurt their targets.
During the roast of Charlie Sheen, comedian Amy Schumer famously angered Jackass star Steve-O by mentioning the death of his fellow castmate and friend Ryan Dunn, which had occurred just a few weeks earlier. Davidson drew gasps from members of the live audience when he talked about his father, who died in the attacks on 9/11. He said to Bieber, “I lost my dad on 9/11, and I always regretted growing up without a dad. Until I met your dad, Justin. Now I’m glad mine’s dead.” There were audible groans and a smattering of slow applause from the audience, who did not know how to react. That was the first of a couple 9/11-themed jokes, and the first of many jokes during which the audience winced.
Various jokes were said throughout the evening that visibly upset the roasters. Hart did not seem to approve of any of the ISIS jokes used, and Ludacris did not seem to appreciate a joke that made fun of his role as a father. Both of their reactions are understandable, but it does raise a few questions: What is the role of comedy in our society? How does humor impact the way we view what’s important? Is comedy a useful tool in combatting societal problems, or does it exacerbate them?
A recurring theme throughout the two-hour episode was the way that the female participants onstage were routinely made fun of. Instead of making fun of career, appearance, family, past life experiences, or even race, most jokes directed toward the female roasters almost exclusively made fun of their sex lives. While these jokes were funny, they begged the question of what is considered funny in this country. Comedians who routinely deliver jokes that walk the line between funny and offensive often talk about comedy as a great tool to talk about difficult subjects. Comedy can also be used to help people heal and get audiences to think about tragedy, while at the same time allow them to emotionally compartmentalize.
This ability makes comedy’s role in this country difficult to understand. In terms of Justin Bieber’s roast, the network apparently cut out a joke delivered by Jeff Ross about the late Paul Walker, so occasionally comedy is truly censored. However, while comedy is great when it comes to joking about difficult issues, is it possible that comedy can play a role in the development of society and progress toward a more equal and just future? When these questions are put in the context of the roast, the answer is simple: Comedy can play a role that furthers equality, but a Comedy Central Roast is not the place where that happens.

Dear Evan,
Have you ever eaten the vegetable fritters from the Tartan Express truck? They’re offered as a side for the mediocre noodle dishes and slightly more mediocre rice bowls, but they’re far more delicious than any of the truck’s main dishes. I’ve been eating there every day for dinner, and I dump the bowls in favor of the two deep-fried, heavenly balls that come with them.
Now I’m running out of money. My budget can’t take much more of the amount of money I’m spending buying dinners for the side dish. But I’ve been eating vegetable fritters for dinner for so long, now, that I feel like I need to subsist on them to survive. I’m addicted.
I’m seriously considering staking out the truck, and stealing all the fritters when they close shop at the end of the day.
How can I combat this addiction?
Hungrily yours,
Fried Rice Isn’t Carried, And Secret Sauce Enveloping Every Dollop Feels Repulsive, but Interesting and Tasty Treats Ever-Replenishing
Dear FRICASSEED FRITTER,
Everyone seems to be writing in about food or restaurants lately. I wonder why that is?
I personally see no problem with hijacking the Tartan Truck and driving it as far as it can take you, starting your own cross-country ramen business, selling your wares for paltry prices to the good, hard-working Americans that don’t have the luxury of even mediocre-quality Asianic noodle and rice dishes, who have gone through their unhappy years of nine-to-fives from the moment they graduated (or didn’t graduate) high school without having ever seen, let alone tasted, an egg roll.
You would be an American hero. And, of course, you’d keep the vegetable fritters to yourself.
But if you really want to kick the fritter habit, you’ll have to find something equally as enticing. If you want to stick to campus eateries (although I’ve no idea why you would), I suggest eating at the hot dog stand for lunch daily — best dogs in the immediate area. If you’d rather stick to vegetarian, you should ... well, no, there’s nothing, really.
Or get off the meal plan and use all the money you save to buy your own food truck,
Evan Kahn

The Imitation Game
Friday, April 10 & Saturday April 11, 10 p.m.
Sunday April 12, 8 p.m.
Everyone’s favorite posh British actor Benedict Cumberbatch stars in this biopic epic. The Imitation Game follows “father of computer science” Alan Turing’s quest to break “Enigma,” a secret Nazi code that existed during the Second World War. Breaking the code allowed the British army to save many innocent lives and win the war much more quickly. Keira Knightley co-stars as a female member of Turing’s team and a complicated love interest. If you are not a fan of Keira Knightley, her performance here probably won’t win you over, even though it earned her a nomination for Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress. In his Oscar-nominated portrayal of Alan Turing, Cumberbatch brings a sensitivity and vulnerability to Turing that audiences have not seen in the characters of Sherlock Holmes or Khan, the roles that launched him to fame. Punctuated with humor and sadness, the movie also follows the tragic life of Turing post-World War II, where he is punished by authorities for his homosexuality. Not only is Turing’s tale impressive and important, but for an audience of computer science-focused individuals, the movie also shows — albeit kind of vaguely — the construction of an early computer, christened Christopher.

Student government election results were released last Tuesday. Junior policy and management and Chinese studies double major JR Marshall and junior information systems major Jibby Ayo-Ani were ratified on Wednesday as the incoming student body president (SBP) and student body vice president (SBVP), respectively.
Marshall and Ayo-Ani won with 37.18 percent of the total vote. Competitors junior information systems major Evan Wineland and sophomore math major Connie Yang came in second place with 31.66 percent, while junior electrical and computer engineering major Divya Kothandapani and third year Ph.D. candidate in mechanical engineering Mark Whiting earned 14.61 percent. The final running pair, senior statistics and economics double major Saif Jedidi and sophomore computer science major Ben Debebe, ended the election with 11.58 percent of the vote.
Additionally, junior math major Benjamin Zhang was elected unopposed as student body vice president for finance (SBVPF). Meanwhile, sophomore chemical engineering and engineering and public policy double major Trevor Hadick was elected over sophomore math and economics double major Ryan LaPré as student body vice president for organizations (SBVPO). Hadick received 42.42 percent of the vote, while LaPré received 29.16 percent.
This year’s election demonstrated a significant increase in student participation. 26.22 percent of total students cast votes, compared with 17.9 percent in 2014. 41.06 percent of undergraduates voted, compared with 32.43 percent in 2014. Meanwhile, 10.36 percent of graduate students voted, almost triple the number who voted last year.
The election was “quite a ride,” Marshall said. He added that it was “really encouraging to get the campus involved in an election” and that all students “deserve a student government that works for them.”
According to Ayo-Ani, she and Marshall crafted a platform that addressed as many students as possible in an effort to increase student participation in the election. “Our goal from the very beginning was to get as many people involved as possible,” she said.
“Students are coming to realize what an important time this is in our long-term history,” Marshall said. He is confident that students are starting to “take ownership of the future of Carnegie Mellon.”
Marshall and Ayo-Ani ran on a platform that emphasized mental health awareness and efforts to combat sexual assault and relationship violence on campus, including getting all campus leaders certified in the Survivor Support Network. In addition, they want to expand acceptance of DineX at businesses close to campus and establish a “Reorientation Day” in the middle of the semester to facilitate students’ mindfulness.
Current SBP and senior electrical and computer engineering and business administration double major Ian Glasner reflected on his own tenure as SBP so far at Senate last week, citing successful campaigns such as the Proud to Be Plaid initiative and committee, the student initiatives website, and the Jared L. Cohon University Center expansion plan.
Glasner’s administration also fought to decrease exceptions to the university’s moratorium on having classes between 4:30 p.m. and 6:30 p.m., so that all students can participate in extracurriculars, and to internalize Carnegie Mellon’s alcohol citation policy.
Glasner emphasized that, though many of his initiatives have become reality, there are still some that have yet to be corrected, such as housing and dining prices, which are much higher than those of off-campus options. He stressed that larger student movements are necessary to make the changes to these policies. “Housing and dining are not going to improve until that happens,” Glasner said.
Marshall and Ayo-Ani do not wish to set any first priority for tackling their administration’s initiatives, as there are “so many issues of equal importance that can’t wait,” Marshall said.
They are already engaged in an “orchestrated, synthesized effort to set [their initiatives] in motion right away and get the right people in place,” Marshall said.
“[We’re] reaching out to administration to move from feasibility talks to talks of logistics,” Ayo-Ani said.
Each of their initiatives starts with student town halls, according to Marshall, to show that students’ voices are their administration’s top priority.
“We want to help give people that springboard to do great things here,” Ayo-Ani said.
“We’re not superheroes,” Marshall said, “but this student body is made up of superheroes.”
Marshall spoke of his working relationship with Ayo-Ani saying, “We really consider ourselves a team. We share the same goals, the same values, and the same future for this campus.”
Marshall additionally expressed his desire to integrate their former competition into their administration: “We want to work with our competitors. They were so gracious, full of integrity, and real pleasure to run against, and they will continue to be just as much a part of the team ... to make the future a little brighter.”
“We’re really thankful that the student body would choose us to lead us through next year,” said Marshall. “We really believe we can leave [Carnegie Mellon] a lot better than how we found it.”

Cigarettes: many students have had one, some want to try them, and some smoke them as a habit.
Currently, Carnegie Mellon allows students and other campus members to smoke in designated smoking areas, often situated in less traveled areas and on the peripheries of campus. But that could change if a tobacco free policy proposed by the Smoking Policy Review Committee is approved by an Undergraduate Student Senate vote on Thursday. The policy also must be approved by the Graduate Student Assembly, Staff Council, Faculty Senate, and University President Subra Suresh before it goes into effect.
The committee, composed mainly of administrators and other employees of the university, will completely remove smoking from campus if their policy is approved.
The committee has sought to eliminate designated smoking zones since its inception in 2013. The committee was formed by Dr. Anita Barkin, the former director of health services, who found that the current policy allowing designated smoking zones is outdated.
In 2009, a group called The Healthy Campus Task Force created the designated areas and enforced a $25 fine for smoking in non-designated areas as part of a program Campus 2010. The fines also pertained to littering cigarette butts.
“The committee was formed to benchmark best practices, to look at other colleges’ policies, and to review the literature to understand from a public health standpoint what was in the university’s best interests,” Dean of Student Affairs Gina Casalegno said.
The argument can be made that Carnegie Mellon is behind in its tobacco policy. 1,514 campuses around the country do not allow smoking, and 1,014 are completely free of tobacco as of January this year, according to the United States Tobacco Free Initiative.
There were about 774 smoke-free campuses and 562 tobacco-free campus when the Smoking Policy Review Committee was created, according to the initiative.
It was not always the case that Carnegie Mellon found itself behind in this policy. Junior decision science major Julia Eddy, a member of Student Senate, sits on the committee as the only undergraduate student representative.
“Early on, our policy of having smoking areas in 2006 was very progressive for college campuses,” said Eddy. “The last time the smoking policy was reviewed, going smoke- or tobacco-free was met with a lot of opposition.”
Casalegno noted that there are smokers on the committee, but that many of them agree that a smoke-free campus is in the best interest of Carnegie Mellon students. She additionally noted that the policy would not look to change an individual’s stance on smoking: “If we adopt this policy, it is not the university saying ‘individual members must quit.’ ”
Though the administration does not wish to actively make smokers quit, a support system for smokers who wish to quit will still be a part of the plan. “We do care a lot about individuals who consume tobacco and wish to receive aid in cessation of those habits” Casalegno noted.
One could argue that the proposed policy is a violation of smokers’ basic personal freedoms, but this is not the stance taken by the committee. Of the smokers interviewed for this article, nearly all stated that the policy would inconvenience them.
As for the general student body’s opinion, there has not been a conclusive smoking survey since the one Carnegie Mellon’s Healthy U project released in October. 
The majority of smokers who took the survey stated that they wished to quit. That being said, Eddy further stated via email that “the administration was concerned with survey fatigue in light of CMU student experience survey and sexual assault and relationship violence studies.”
During discussions, the committee considered the effects of secondhand smoke.
“We do not believe the current system is sufficient in preventing secondhand smoke risks,” Casalegno said. “We want to move smokers’ actions to places where they have less of an effect on others.”
Additionally they discussed the counter-argument for smokers to be able to practice their habit as they see fit.
“We have had a very open and transparent process with engaging the governing bodies and really inviting students, faculty, and staff to talk to their constituencies and give us feedback,” Casalegno said. “So the input we’ve received from people who choose to use tobacco, including members on our committee, [has helped] us shape what we think is the best approach.”

Most students know that the construction to the Jared L. Cohon University Center (CUC) will erect new fitness and performance spaces for student and community use. Those designs are firmly planned and have been the discussion of the expansion for months, if not years.
But on the third floor of the expansion, there is space for student use whose specific design is still in flux — “shell space,” as administrators and students alike have termed it.
The name “shell space” comes from the current building plan for the space: a floor, four walls, and a ceiling, with no definitive current plans for further furnishing — in essence, an empty shell.
Since its initial conception and purchase by Dean of Student Affairs Gina Casalegno and Vice President of Campus Affairs Michael Murphy, planning for the space has passed primarily to student government, and discussions are well underway.
Conception
According to Director of Student Activities Liz Vaughan, the shell space wasn’t part of the original plan for the CUC expansion.
Rather, it became “effectively an add-on to the project” once administrators realized they could seize an opportunity amid the previously planned disruption to the building.
Vaughan said that it’s easier to erect extra space while construction is already altering the landscape than to add onto existing spaces later, even if those spaces are not immediately needed. Furthermore, she explained, “It would be cost prohibitive to ever do that in the future.”
So the initial rationale behind shell space was proactive, anticipating future needs, rather than reactive to current demands.
The creation of additional space was made logistically feasible when it became possible to dig deeper than originally planned in shaping out the lower levels of the CUC expansion. Those new spaces, in turn, allowed for extra capacity on the third floor.
According to Vaughan, the driving question was “How do we take advantage of the construction and maximize the space that could be captured?”
These lower spaces have already essentially been auctioned off. The two biggest purchasers have been Carnegie Mellon Dining and the Carnegie Mellon Bookstore — “neither of [whom] have nearly the storage space they need” currently, Vaughan said — both of whom will be financially responsible for furnishing that space.
While dining and the bookstore filled out the lower levels, it became clear that the extra room on the third floor could be harnessed as student space, with fewer passersby on the upper levels and student organization office space also in use nearby.
Seeing the potential, Casalegno and Murphy found the funds — most of which came from a large past donation to the school — to purchase the space and approach student government with a proposal.
In essence, the third floor was not opened for bidding as were the designated dining and bookstore spaces on the lower levels, but first offered for purchase by Senate and the Graduate Student Assembly (GSA).
“The space would have been opened up for auction for all different parties,” said junior information systems major and Senate Chair Evan Wineland. In his words, Casalegno and Murphy’s gesture indicated, “We want you guys to have priority.”
Once Student Senate and the GSA responded positively to the idea of purchasing the space for student use, the question arose how to divide and design the space for optimal use.
Division of Space
Vaughan explained that a natural division of space arose because of a stairwell in the center of the shell space layout.
In terms of size, GSA’s share is 1,534 nonlinear square feet, while Senate’s portion occupies 3,025 nonlinear square feet.
Both bodies plan to proceed relatively independently, each with their own designs and plans for financing their respective spaces.
Senate: Vision of a Collaborative Space
To determine a function for the shell space, Senate hosted a number of tabling events to launch the discussion, drawing feedback from students who approached their table and completed their surveys.
From the survey results, Senate concluded that students primarily wanted collaborative study space, followed by dining and music spaces. This response prompted a second iteration of the survey, in which Senate asked, “What are the adjectives that make you think of a more collaborative space?”
“We feel like we’ve collected robust enough feedback,” Wineland said.
In terms of what “collaborative space” means, Vaughan described it as an “open, multifunctional space where people can flexibly adjust how it’s being used.”
Junior decision science major and Senate shell space committee chair Julia Eddy said, “We’re looking to expand capacity for midday kind of activities.”
“There’s not a single purely academic space in the [Cohon] University Center because it’s supposed to be the focal point of other aspects of student life,” Wineland explained. But right now, Wineland said, “It’s crowded. It’s cramped.”
The goal is to “make sure that there is more opportunity for student to relax,” Wineland said.
To streamline efforts toward planning for the space, a Senate shell space committee emerged, comprising six student senators and chaired by Eddy.
“Even though the committee is exclusively senators, they were elected to represent the student body,” said sophomore economics major and Dietrich College senator Vaasavi Unnava. “They represent a pretty diverse group of colleges and years.”
GSA: Vision of a Graduate Student Lounge
While Senate conducted its own discussion of how shell space should be used for undergraduate students, the GSA saw its opportunity to dedicate space specifically to the graduate student experience.
“Campus feels completely dominated by undergrads,” Wineland acknowledged.
Vaughan elaborated, “The [CUC] isn’t a center for grad students; it’s a hub for undergrads.”
According to GSA President and Ph.D. candidate in rhetoric Carolyn Commer, the inspiration for a graduate student lounge is drawn from the GSA-sponsored coffee shop that existed many years ago on campus, sometimes referred to as the “Liquid Sky Cafe” or the “Ivory Tower.”
“Our current vision is a bit of a revival of that old coffee shop as a casual lounge space where all graduate students are welcome to socialize, collaborate, or study,” Commer explained via email.
As part of that vision, the space is currently intended to include large, rectangular tables for group discussion, as well as small tables and movable furniture “for either individual study or more intimate coffee house-style conversation.” Also featured will be a kitchenette offering tea and coffee.
According to Commer, GSA collected feedback from and offered opportunities for involvement for graduate students over the past two academic years.
In academic year 2013–14, that feedback mostly consisted of updates and open discussion in meetings with GSA representatives, and in April 2014, GSA representatives began sending email requests for feedback to graduate students and inviting them to join the GSA grad space planning committee.
In September 2014 and February 2015, GSA proceeded with strategic planning sessions with GSA representatives and other graduate students to identify what graduate students need most out of the space.
Financing
Preliminary estimates for cost of the space are $191,750 for GSA and $378,125 for Senate, according to Vaughan. However, by multiple accounts, these number are subject to change substantially once the design details come into focus.
“My hunch is they will pull back from that,” Vaughan said. “You don’t need to be at these numbers to do what you want with this space.”
Wineland and Eddy both described the question of financing the space as a “chicken-and-egg” problem.
“We want the architects to tell us what we can get with a certain price range,” Wineland said. 
At the same time, however, the architects need design details for an accurate estimate, while student government wants to keep those details vague to keep the cost flexible as they look for means of financing the project.
Regardless of actual final cost, Senate doesn’t have the funds to pay for the space upfront. Knowing this, Casalegno and Murphy have offered to loan student government the funds — at no interest — to be paid back in no more than 10 years.
To express its commitment to financing the shell space, Student Senate has put forth a deposit of $50,000. According to Wineland, $18,000 of that money came from budget allocations, while Senate withdrew the remaining $32,000 from its reserve, leaving about $10,000 left in the reserve.
“Previously, that money had been stagnant,” Wineland explained.
GSA is still determining from where it would draw its funds. According to a written statement from GSA Vice President of Finance Mark Whiting via Commer, a Community Improvement Fund was started a few years ago as part of the endowment — a fund which could cover a large fraction of annual loan payments toward shell space.
Other methods of obtaining funds include “using a small amount of our capital, consolidating some main expenses, or raising funds through events or standard activities fee growth. 
Another option which has not been ruled out is to use a very small percentage of the student body’s activities fee account to help in funding the entire shell space buildout project.”
Part of the issue, Vaughan explained, is not just a matter of finding the money, but also justifying allocating funds toward shell space when it could have been spent elsewhere: “How do we best leverage our money so we aren’t reducing services and programming to the point that it’s harming the student experience in other ways?”
Next Steps
For GSA, the primary next step will be reforming its graduate student space planning committee, as many of its current members will graduate at the end of this academic year, according to Commer. That committee will respond to upcoming designs from the architects and present those designs to the student body, as well as solicit feedback and student artwork.
Meanwhile, Eddy and the shell space committee are looking to draft a general plan for Campus Design to get an up-to-date estimate from the architects.

When Jess Klein arrived at Carnegie Mellon University in 2013, the school was still reeling over the Beta Theta Pi scandal.
As the first-ever coordinator of gender programs and sexual violence prevention, Klein was in charge of re-imagining the university’s programs, public perception, and results — no small task. But Klein, in her one-and-a-half-year tenure, has worked to change the campus culture surrounding sexual assault and relationship violence prevention (SARVP), including revamping the survivor support network (SSN) and helping to pilot the university’s first-ever SARV student study.
The survey, made available on April 5 to students at the Pittsburgh campus, will be open until April 27, according to Ashley Sobhani, a junior global studies major who sits on the SARVP committee and is an active member of the SSN and Got Consent?.
“This survey was going to be released next fall, but we decided that if we could do it now, we should,” Klein said. “We know this is important, and we’ve got to do it right.”
Designed by Janel A. Sutkus, the director of institutional research and analysis at Carnegie Mellon, the survey is individualized: Every time a student answers a question, their answer will determine the next question.
“We need this survey on campus, because we realized that there was a very small group ... that had experience with [SARV prevention],” Sobhani said. “The bubble was too small and not representative of our campus.”
Sobhani said that, through the survey, they will be able to target people who have a part in perpetuating SARV issues on campus.
We’ll be able to know and understand their part in it, make them aware of it, and how they can help to change if need be, especially through bystanders,” Sobhani said.
The study is the result of a collaboration between Klein, Director of Upperclass and Greek Student Life Lucas Christian, Assistant Dean of Student Affairs Holly Hippensteel, Dean of Student Affairs Gina Casalengo, Associate Dean of Student Affairs John Hannon, and Assistant Vice President of General Counsel Dan Munsch, according to Klein. 
The study relies heavily on the SSN to both spread awareness of the survey and encourage students to participate.
The SSN is a re-vamped version of what used to be called the sexual assault advisors, according to Klein. The program trains campus community members to respond to requests for help from sexual assault survivors and focuses on changing the perception and stigma of sexual assault on campus. While on campus, Klein has trained over 150 members of the SSN.
“All I’m doing is telling society how to be people — teaching them about why this exists in the first place: because there’s a lack of respect,” Klein said. “My only contribution is really to tell people that we can change that. I want people to know that we have an SSN on campus. I want it to be engrained in the culture here that we have a support network.”
Evan Wineland, junior information systems major and chair of the undergraduate Student Senate, has also been trained by Klein. He said that her work has made him think harder about the way he acts: “Jess challenges all of us to rethink what we’ve been conditioned by society to take for granted.”
“The bigger picture is getting people to understand that we create this problem,” Klein said. “This isn’t biological. This isn’t DNA. This isn’t genetic. This is a socially constructed problem. These problems are more than what we see. I wish we could all look at the complexities of it and understand what it is.”
From the outside, it can appear that fighting sexual assault and relationship violence on campus is an uphill battle. 
The number of sexual assaults on campus has never been higher and continues to rise. Carnegie Mellon reported in its 2014 Annual Security and Fire Safety Report that the number of on-campus assaults reported tripled from 2011 to 2013. 
This statistic could indicate a higher willingness to report and that it is becoming easier for survivors to report their experiences at Carnegie Mellon, an assumption that this study could verify.
While the study is designed to help report more accurate numbers than those contained in the annual report, it is also designed to gauge on-campus sentiment regarding the efforts, according to Klein and Sobhani.
“There hasn’t even ever been a survey of this type before,” Sobhani said. “This survey is powerful in that it looks in-depth at how students feel about these issues on campus. The Clery Act is helpful for spitting out statistics, but we need real student feedback.”
According to Klein, the student attitude at the university is still cynical of the university’s transparency, and she often struggles with students’ views of these situations.
“We’re doing a lot of things right here,” Klein said. 
“I was a student once, but now I see it from the administration’s side. There are a lot of people who care about this very much and are taking this survey and the results we’ll get from it very seriously. We’re lucky here. [President Subra Suresh] supports it, [Casalengo] supports it, and they’re amazing advocates. It’s a top-down approach.”
Both Klein and Sobhani stressed the importance of students’ honest participation in the survey. The results of the survey will dictate how both Klein’s office and the SSN will designate their time in the future, Klein said.
“It’s confidential, so even if this is just a situation that only came up once in your life, this is your chance to vocalize it and how you feel about it to the administration on your own time from your room,” Sobhani said.
Klein is encouraged by the students she works with and the administration and faculty members that support both her and her work at Carneige Mellon: “The mission is to get people to understand the complexities of gender-based violence. Once they have an understanding, that changes perspectives of people. That’s where we start.... Stuff like this isn’t easy to talk about or assess, so the data from this survey is going to tell us where we are as an institution and what we need to change to make it better here for everyone.”

Dietrich College announces opening of the Institute for Politics and Strategy
By the time students return from their summer vacation, the Dietrich Colleges of Humanities and Social Sciences will have a new addition: the Institute for Politics and Strategy (IPS).
The IPS, which opens on July 1, will seek to further political science, international relations, national security policy, and grand strategy at the university through research, education, and initiatives across Carnegie Mellon University.
The IPS will be led by Director of the Center for International Relations and Politics Kiron K. Skinner, who also serves as the university’s advisor on national security policy.
Upon opening, the IPS will offer undergraduate students a bachelor of science in international relations and politics, as well as two minors: one in international relations and politics and one in politics and public policy. The IPS will also offer the college’s Washington Semester Program.
For graduates, the IPS will administer the humanities part of the master’s of information technology strategy program.
“The IPS will be a focal point for research on politics, particularly politics in the international arena,” Dietrich College Dean Richard Scheines said in a university news release. “Along with several important scholars from the Pittsburgh office of the RAND Corporation as well as political science departments at several top universities, the work of the IPS will add a critical dimension to Dietrich’s portfolio in humanities and social sciences.”
In addition to its major and minor offerings, the IPS will house the Center for International Relations and Politics and the humanities part of the Institute for Strategic Analysis (ISA). 
The ISA, with portions in the College of Engineering and School of Computer Science, aims to provide campus members with “high-level, strategic engagements with the defense, diplomatic and intelligence communities through activities spanning disciplines of several colleges at the university,” according to the news release. 
Skinner is the director of both of these programs.
Students receive Goldwater scholarships to pursue science, math, or engineering
Junior biological sciences major Jillian Jaycox and junior materials science and engineering and chemistry double major Joshua Kubiak are recipients of Barry M. Goldwater Scholarships.
They are two of 260 sophomores and juniors chosen from 1,200 nominations for the 2015–16 academic year.
Goldwater Scholars receive up to $7,500 for one or two years to pay for items such as tuition, books, and room and board.
The scholarship was created by the U.S. Congress in the name of Sen. Barry M. Goldwater and is awarded to allow students to study mathematics, the natural sciences, and engineering.
“Jaycox’s and Kubiak’s recognition as Goldwater Scholars demonstrate the embodiment of a CMU education,” said Jennifer Keating-Miller, associate director of undergraduate research and national fellowships in a university press release. “They are fully deserving of their recognition as Goldwater Scholars. It will be an exciting endeavor to see how their respective academic and personal paths will unfold in the coming years.”
Carnegie Mellon has had 20 Goldwater Scholars, according to the release.

Just over two weeks ago, I saw the School of Drama’s production of Steubenville. It was insightful and harrowing; it toed the line between deeply personal and completely universal. It rang true for me as a woman and, as someone from urban Ohio, it felt close to home.
While the show focused on rape culture, it also examined body image. Body image and insecurity aren’t limited to women, but I want to speak from my own experience because body discussions belong in the discourse about feminism and empowerment.
Last week I saw several discussions online about Meghan Trainor’s new song, “Dear Future Husband,” claiming that it is sexist. I’m still on the fence about this; it could also be a satire of relationships and the power dynamics of gender roles, á la Taylor Swift’s depiction of abusive relationships in “Blank Space.” Trainor’s “All About That Bass” from last summer was catchy and felt empowering, but some called it skinny shaming. That debate made me evaluate the way I feel, think, and talk about body size.
I am not thin. I don’t think of myself as fat (most days, anyway), but I am definitely not thin. I know that weight and health are different things, but I rarely feel confident in my body and I haven’t been satisfied with my weight since I was 16. My BMI was once on the border between “normal” and “overweight,” but now rests at the high end of the “overweight” zone. (While I recognize that BMI is not the most accurate measure of health, doctors do say it gives a useful estimate.) I hate that weight insecurity is part of my identity as a woman.
Weight loss is a struggle. With some minor fluctuations, I have maintained the same approximate weight for over a year and half. As someone with asthma, exercise is difficult. Because I take asthma and allergy medications, weight clings to my body a little more tightly. Food habits are tricky, too. I enjoy food (let’s face it: carbs are delicious) and sometimes I use it for non-nutritional ends (snacking helps me stay awake when I’m up too late studying).
Let’s clarify something: Not all eating disorders make you skinny. Compulsive binge eating is a battle for me. Sometimes it’s called food addiction, likening it to smoking or alcoholism. The catch, of course, is that you can’t quit food.
Certainly, all eating disorders are dangerous. Anorexia and bulimia are devastating. Binge-eating disorder differs in its effects, but has similar roots. Food is accompanied by guilt, stress, and shame, which perpetuate in a cycle. Given the choice between an eating disorder that makes you fat and one that makes you skinny, who would prefer the former? Maybe it's flippant to ask. Our consumer culture certainly tells us the latter.
For a long time I thought weight and restraint had to do with willpower. I engaged in skinny-shaming before I even knew the words for it. The truth is that eating disorders are connected to mental health, not self-control. And not all weight gain comes from eating disorders: accessibility, socioeconomics, and underlying health issues (both physical and mental) all play a role. Still, fatness is associated with laziness, sloppiness, and poor self-control. Rooted in objectification and internalized misogyny, the stigma perseveres.
Lots of people are naturally skinny. As a naturally chubby person, I often cannot help feeling resentful of them. I find myself looking at thin women knowing that, even if I lost the excess weight, my rib cage would still be built larger.
The body positivity movement has made strides toward eliminating both "fatphobia" and skinny shaming by emphasizing natural differences in body shape. But while the media represents variations in thin bodies — curvy, wiry, lean, etc. — there continues to be little variation in the representation of overweight women. 
Thin women aren't marginalized in the way overweight women are. In advertising, thin women are aspirational representations of ourselves. In consumer culture, clothes are made to fit thin women; larger sizes are typically enlarged versions of smaller sizes, and don’t account for the way garments fit on differently sized bodies. 
I won’t pretend to understand how thin women feel when they’re called “too skinny” or “anorexic-looking.” Skinny shaming oversimplifies reality for thin women. Many women work hard to stay in shape. Others struggle to put on weight. We shouldn’t discount these challenges, but it’s difficult for me to maintain that outlook when I’m jealous of someone’s thin privilege.
Thin people can struggle with their bodies too, but their privilege comes from judging their bodies by their own standards. To borrow a metaphor from Everyday Feminism, no one else is offended by their beach body. Meanwhile, society sets the standards for overweight people’s bodies. People on the beach do take offense. 
The discussion of privilege brings me back to Steubenville. Rape culture links bodies to sexuality and objectification, and one of the most conspicuous signs of modern rape culture is catcalling. In the show, a woman talked about being catcalled when she runs, and said that it has only happened since she lost weight. 
This makes a connection between objectification and attractiveness. She explained the paradox of wishing she heard catcalling before and hating that she hears it now. Rape culture does that to us; it perpetuates an image of what we should want that differs from what we actually feel. In reality, catcalling isn’t related to attraction. 
Catcallers seek to objectify, making their victims feel threatened and insecure. I've heard women say it feels like a compliment, but I don't think it’s empowering. In particular, when a fat woman is catcalled, there is an additional implication of mockery.
I don’t often wear makeup, but I try to put thought into my appearance. Some days are more effortful than others. No sleep and a long day of classes? Oversized sweater it is. Yet I feel self-conscious on these days. Overweight people are stigmatized to be sloppy and lazy. A thin woman in the same outfit looks like a hipster, but I look like a mess. Is this my own perception? Am I contributing to the stigma by feeling this way? I hope not, but I fear otherwise.
Is the solution to learn to love my body? That seems a little thoughtless. Contrary to comic film portrayals (Bridesmaids, Hairspray, Pitch Perfect), confidence isn’t a catch-all solution for overweight women. I’m happy for those who embrace their bodies, but not everyone feels that way. 
The media also tends to represent two extremes: clearly overweight or conventionally thin women. Medium-sized or chubby women aren’t shown much. I like Mindy Kaling’s comments about being “average American woman-sized.” I’m probably closer to her size and shape than anyone else I’ve seen on television.
Will I continue to try to lose weight? Yes. While I wish I felt more body-positive, I still feel body-insecure. Ideally, feeling good about my body would be independent of my weight. I'm just not there yet.

Last week, 26.22 percent of students voted in the student government election, including 41.06 percent of undergraduate students and 10.36 percent of graduate students. In last year’s elections, only 17.9 percent of students — 32.21 percent of undergraduates and 3.32 percent of graduates — voted. 
This year’s election represents an unprecedented and impressive increase in voter turnout from previous years. Each pair of candidates running for student body president (SBP) and student body vice president (SBVP) presented a platform with a set of goals that were relevant to the student body, graduate and undergraduate. 
At a university known for the apathy of its students, higher student engagement in this election is a refreshing change from previous years. Much of this engagement stemmed from the candidates for SBP and SBVP, who took the election seriously and actively reached out to the student body as part of their campaigns. 
The Tartan commends the candidates for engaging the student body more than ever before; we hope to see candidates in future years look to this year as an example. Although junior Chinese studies and policy and management major JR Marshall and junior information systems major Jibbi Ayo-Ani won the election, they should take advantage of the other motivated candidates by involving them as cabinet members and considering their ideas. This will enable Marshall and Ayo-Ani to be stronger leaders over the course of the upcoming academic year. 
It’s important that students, especially those elected to Student Government, do not forget the passion and drive of this year’s candidates. The candidates for SBP and SBVP — as well as those for student body vice president for finance, student body vice president for student organizations, and Undergraduate Student Senate — have inspired more students to vote than ever in recent memory, creating an important political dialogue on campus that will hopefully lead to tangible change over the course of the upcoming year.

The Wednesday before last I attended an open town hall, the last of three, that the university held to discuss the 2015 Strategic Plan. I also had the privilege of attending a discussion on Carnegie Mellon culture and community at President Subra Suresh’s house the next day with a host of university administrators and about 35 other students.
The Strategic Plan is built on three main pillars: Transformative Teaching and Learning; Transformative Research, Creativity, Innovation, and Entrepreneurship; and The Transformative CMU Experience. Although the details of the plan haven’t been finalized, at the town hall the leaders of each respective branch of the plan presented some of the possible strategies for addressing their focus. 
It is refreshing to see the administration actively working to change the Carnegie Mellon community for the better. Too often the university’s plans focus on abstractions and buzzwords more than implementing strategies that create tangible effects for the student body. At the town hall there were plenty of buzzwords — innovation, entrepreneurship, and metacurricular, for example — but also lots of solid plans for action. Administrators talked about, for instance, the possibility to take more classes as pass/fail and ensuring that the number of units assigned to a class accurately reflects the workload of the class.
The town hall also provided an open forum for students, faculty, and administrators to discuss the Strategic Plan. Although the town hall was not particularly well attended, it is in line with Dr. Suresh’s emphasis on hearing the ideas of the student body, one of the main tenets of his presidency so far.
Suresh’s presidency has also focused on improving the university’s reputation. One thing that affects the university’s reputation — measured mostly by how it’s ranked — more than anything, Suresh says, is current student and alumni giving. The 2015 Strategic Plan aims to create a “Transformative CMU Experience,” one that can be measured by how many current seniors and recent alumni donate to the university.
It’s obviously frustrating when the university asks for more money when many students are already struggling to cover ever-increasing tuition costs. For me, however, it’s more frustrating that the university seems to care about some alumni and students more than others. 
Carnegie Mellon, harkening back to its roots as Carnegie Tech, pioneering advancements in computer science and artificial intelligence in the ’60s and onwards, has always been a school focused on technology. When the university chose Dr. Suresh as its president — former director of the National Science Foundation and an alumnus of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and the Indian Institute of Technology — it was no surprise.
However, Carnegie Mellon will never rise to the ranks of our so-called “peer institutions” — which, according to the administration include schools such as Harvard, Princeton, and Stanford — unless it rounds out its humanities offerings and stops measuring success with metrics that cater to students in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) fields. Although all of these peer institutions boast impressive donation rates and even more impressive endowments, they also have humanities departments with reputations to match their STEM departments, something that Carnegie Mellon glaringly lacks.
At Carnegie Mellon, success upon graduation is measured by salary. Departments of our university, from our Office of Admission to our Career and Professional Development Center, use money as a benchmark of success. For many, Carnegie Mellon is essentially a pre-professional school: You major in chemical engineering to become a chemical engineer, architecture to become an architect, and so on. Carnegie Mellon’s admissions process reinforces this by forcing prospective students to choose a college and intended degree when they apply. 
You can be undecided up to a point. You can, for example, know that you want to be an engineer, but not exactly which type of engineer. If you’re completely undecided, however, you’re part of Dietrich College, which emphasizes a broad “liberal arts” education but, at the same time, makes it difficult for students to experiment with classes across disciplines. The university does not encourage students to pursue educational passions that don't have an immediate professional application. 
As far as salary as a metric goes, Dietrich College is in relatively good standing. Dietrich College's post-graduation salary averages are high, but they are skewed by students in the college's more interdisciplinary programs, like information systems and decision science, which tend to churn out high-earning employees. 
While this is part of a larger, national discussion on the role of the humanities and liberal arts in America, it’s particularly relevant at Carnegie Mellon, a school founded by technical innovators and with a strong focus on technology that it can’t seem to move beyond. 
The university acknowledges the many arguments that have been made for the humanities, at least implicitly. Last October, former Supreme Court Justice David Souter visited Carnegie Mellon to give a lecture full of such arguments. In his lecture, “The Heart of the Matter: The Humanities and Social Sciences for a Vibrant, Competitive, and Secure Nation," Souter reminded students that an education in the humanities teaches students to embrace multiple perspectives both when looking at a problem and defining a solution. 
Carnegie Mellon also sponsors Odyssey, a Winter Break program in which selected sophomores learn to write a personal essay. Carnegie Mellon recognizes the significance of education in the humanities, so why won't it devote resources to improving and bringing prominence to its offerings in Dietrich College? 
The university did take a step in the right direction last week, when it announced the creation of the Institute for Politics and Strategy (IPS). The IPS, according to a university press release, will "serve as a center for research, undergraduate and graduate education, and university-wide initiatives in the fields of political science, international relations, national security policy and grand strategy." Initiatives like this one are encouraging signs that Carnegie Mellon is willing to lay the groundwork for a future that focuses on and recognizes the significance of the humanities. However, they don't go far enough to correct a 100-year-old imbalance. 
The nascent Strategic Plan includes several strong points and proposed initiatives, from what I’ve seen and heard so far. If Dr. Suresh and the rest of the administration want to significantly improve the university’s international stature, however, they need to focus on metrics past money. Instead of deemphasizing the humanities and social sciences disciplines behind a screen of STEM, the university should push their offerings in the humanities and social sciences to the forefront, and devote the same resources given to its other programs to Dietrich College.

After a seemingly interminable period of last-minute negotiating, the five permanent members of the United Nations (U.N.) Security Council with Germany (P5+1) and Iran finally came to an agreement early on Thursday, April 2. 
After months of baseless speculation that Obama was giving the Iranians a blank check to do as they please with the deal, the public details of the framework make it clear that Iran and the P5+1 have achieved a very fair compromise. Iran will roll back significant portions of its nuclear program in exchange for lifting of crippling sanctions that have crushed its economy for nearly 50 years. 
Members of the P5+1 are touting this as a diplomatic solution to Iran’s nuclear ambitions. Iranian leadership feels the combination of lifted sanctions and the survival of all of their nuclear facilities was sufficient, and the framework for a deal was created.
The hits to Iran’s nuclear program are massive. The deal includes the uninstallation of nearly 13 thousand of Iran’s 19 thousand centrifuges; only 5 thousand of the remaining centrifuges would be permitted to enrich uranium. The enriched uranium will be limited to 3.67 percent, which is enough for nuclear power but not nearly enough for nuclear bombs. Iran may not build any new enrichment facilities. Iran’s current stockpile of 10 thousand kilograms of enriched uranium will be reduced to 3 hundred kilograms. 
Iran’s “breakout time” to build nuclear weapons will be extended from two to three months to one year. Iran’s research and development will make it at least 10 years before they can begin building a weapon, and the breakout time of one year will remain the upper limit of their nuclear research for the duration of the deal. Fordow, Iran’s underground nuclear facility, will be prevented from enriching uranium for at least 15 years. 
The U.N. will have the ability to intrusively and aggressively inspect Iran’s nuclear facilities via the International Atomic Energy Agency. This will almost certainly prevent Iran from actually creating a nuclear weapon anytime over the course of the deal. The mere existence of the deal mitigates Iran’s possibly legitimate claim to need nuclear weapons, even if Israel has threatened nuclear action against Iran in the past. 
While Israel is openly skeptical of the deal and says it wants to inspect the nuclear facilities themselves, after this accord it seems silly for them to go through on their threats, considering that the international community’s response would now be even more devastating.
The return Iran gets, however, is significantly more impactful. Since 1979, Iranians have suffered from terrible economic conditions, wreaking havoc on everything from food security to health care access to air travel. Iranians have been denied admission into foreign universities both by force (i.e. the University of Massachusetts’ ban on Iranian students in its nuclear engineering program) and by monetary restrictions (sending money out of the country is a nightmare).
Iran has millions of barrels of oil sitting idle rather than getting sold (although that might be a good thing, considering the impact of fossil fuels). Even the anticipation of lifted sanctions is creating a boom in Iran’s stock market. The effects of Iranian sanctions went far beyond making it more difficult for Iran to increase its military capabilities. This deal signifies a light at the end of the tunnel for many Iranian citizens who never supported their government's posturing and rhetoric to begin with, yet still lived with the burden of economic sanctions that made their lives incredibly difficult.
The resistance to the deal from the American Right will claim that Iran will use the economic relief to further destabilize the region, partnering with militant groups in Hezbollah and the Houthis among other threats to democratically elected governments. While there are certainly problems with Iran’s regional affiliations, the nuclear deal will probably not worsen these situations. Iran is already providing support for these groups; the sanctions were not quite stopping them. 
Furthermore, this deal creates a level of trust between the United States and Iran that has not existed since Operation TPAJAX installed the shah and the Hostage Crisis. This newfound diplomatic pull could be instrumental in pulling Iran to a more moderate position. Between this and joint airstrikes against ISIS, it feels like Iran might be open to diplomatic relations for the first time in decades. Diplomatic relations will calm radicalism by giving Iran someone to answer to.
We will not know the extent of the provisions until the official text is rolled out in late June. There will also be hurdles in both the American and Iranian legislative bodies. However, this deal is exciting. Relations with Iran are by no means perfect, but this deal allows their people to live safer and better lives without introducing yet another avenue to nuclear conflict. U.S.-Iran relations have been impossibly strained for decades, but this creates a precedent for, if both sides fulfill their obligations, a middle ground and mutual trust. It’s by no means Nixon in China, but it’s a powerful start.

Indiana Governor Mike Pence signed the Indiana Religious Freedom Restoration Act (RFRA) into law this week. Critics of the bill point out that the RFRA gives businesses a legal defense to discriminate against consumers for religious reasons. For instance, a Christian caterer could refuse to cater a same-sex wedding, or a Christian coffee shop owner could deny service to a gay customer. 
Of course, anyone can be discriminated against under this law, but LGBTQ people are far more likely to face discrimination "for religious reasons" than most groups of people. Considering the wave of marriage equality and tolerance sweeping through states like Indiana, lawmakers clearly feel a present need to protect discrimination against LGBTQ people.
Defenders of the bill argue that it does not give a “license to discriminate.” Most claim that the bill is no different from the RFRAs of nearly 20 other states. There’s even a federal RFRA, which was signed into law by President Clinton in 1993 with bipartisan support. For liberals to support the RFRAs in other states and protest the Indiana bill, defenders say, is nothing but hypocrisy and politicking.
They’re wrong. The Indiana bill is significantly different from the RFRAs of other states, and the Indiana bill gives businesses a license to discriminate, whereas other RFRAs do not. 
I can understand the confusion. The bills have the same name! Surely they must be exactly the same in every single way, right? Wrong. 
I face this struggle daily. My name is Emmett Eldred, and my grandfather’s name is also Emmett Eldred. I have to remind myself all the time that I am not the exact same person as my grandfather. It gets rather existential. And just imagine how confusing it can get for other people. It seems like at least once a week an elderly stranger from Vermont sends me a friend request on Facebook, and I have to explain to them in excruciating detail why I am not the person they are looking for. 
So I understand your confusion, thinly veiled bigots, I really do. And I’m here to help. The difference between Indiana’s RFRA and other RFRAs is not blatant. In fact, it’s pretty subtle, which I think is exactly the problem. We all know how poorly homophobic people handle subtlety. 
Take a look at the federal RFRA, the model bill for pretty much every other RFRA. According to Section 2000bb, Subsection B, Item 2, the purpose of the federal RFRA is “to provide a claim or defense to persons whose religious exercise is substantially burdened by government.” This sentiment is echoed in Section 2000bb-1, Subsection A, which says, “Government shall not substantially burden a person’s exercise of religion” except in instances of “compelling government interest.” 
This intent is shared by every other RFRA. The bills are designed to do one thing: protect citizens from the government infringing on their religious freedom. That’s a protection granted to us by the First Amendment of the U.S. Constitution, so we don’t really need an extra law to say the same thing, but whatever.
To be fair, the Indiana bill does provide the same protection. It is clear throughout the text that an objective of the bill is to protect the people of Indiana from the state government infringing on their religious liberties. If that’s all the bill did, there would be no controversy. But that’s not all the bill does. 
According to Section 9 of the Indiana RFRA, a person or business can use the religious freedom defense in court “regardless of whether the state or any other governmental entity is a party to the proceeding.” In other words, this bill doesn’t just apply to instances in which the government impedes religious freedom, it applies to any instance in which interacting with any person impedes religious freedom. 
Neither the Federal RFRA nor any of the other state RFRAs include similar language. So when people protest the law, they are not being hypocritical, the laws are genuinely different in a substantial way. And that difference does give businesses the “license to discriminate,” as long as they can argue that they are adhering to their religious beliefs.
So how do we fix this? The Indiana State Legislature must remove section 9 from the bill, clarify in the bill that it does not give businesses a license to discriminate, and expand their nondiscrimination laws to protect LGBTQ people. 
Governor Mike Pence has said repeatedly that Hoosiers are good and decent people who would never discriminate against anyone. This may be true on the whole, but there will always be people filled with hate. A feel-good statement about the decency of your state is no excuse to not protect people from discrimination.
If Hoosiers truly are good, decent people, then they should have no problem with laws protecting fellow Indiana citizens from discrimination. It’s a shame, then, that Gov. Pence has for decades been consistent in opposing nondiscrimination laws protecting LGBTQ people.

This past week, Ellen Pao, current Reddit interim CEO and former junior investment partner for venture capital firm Kleinerm, Perkins, Caufield & Byers, lost her class action lawsuit against the firm filed on the basis of gender discrimination.
Pao felt that her male peers being promoted to senior partner instead of her was a sign of discrimination. She began to voice complaints of this in December 2011, and was then fired in October 2012. Her lawsuit came on the grounds that her being passed over for promotion was on the basis of gender, and that her firing came as retaliation to her complaints, but jurors reported that their decision came down to lack of evidence. 
Throughout the five-week trial, Pao's counsel presented cases of subtle workplace sexism, such as excluding women from firm social events because they "kill the buzz," bringing a woman's maternal status into her professional staus, and labeling Pao as too assertive and "a complainer." 
The performance reviews for Pao stated that she was "too resentful." Higher-ups in KPCB described a successful female investor as one who does not complain. None of these are examples of overt, illegal gender discrimination, but that doesn't make the behavior excusable.
These and other examples mentioned during testimony show very clear signs of a sexist culture at KPCB. But because Ellen Pao lost on all counts, there will be no legal consequences for the company. Some are arguing that the fact that this case made it to trial at all is a success because of how difficult it is to take on such a large firm. But because they've gotten away with it, there is nothing to stop it from happening again.
It is helpful that the case brought attention to the issue and the company, and it may put pressure on the industry to simulate progress until the publicity dies down. But what happens then?
There may be no legal basis on which to punish KPCB, but the company needs to held accountable as women move closer to workplace equality. Raising awareness is not enough to take down these multi-billionaire powerhouses. Washington needs to step in and introduce stricter regulations and punishments so that Pao's case and experiences can be more than just symbolic.

Until April 27, students on Carnegie Mellon's Pittsburgh campus have the chance to give feedback on their perception and experiences with sexual assault and relationship violence (SARV) on campus and how the university can better prevent it. 
The survey, a result of extensive collaboration between the Office of Student Life, the Office of the Dean of Student Affairs, the Office of General Counsel, and the Office of Institutional Research and Analysis, marks the first major effort to gauge not only the numbers behind SARV, but the sentiment. 
Coordinator of Gender Programming and Sexual Violence Jess Klein has been instrumental in this effort, as well as the extended survivor support network. This survey is an important landmark in the campus's fight to address SARV and spread prevention awareness.
Not only does it individualize the questions to make every student's experience unique, but it will come with content warnings and a constant reminder that, should students be emotionally affected by the content, they have many resources on campus. The survey will provide a comprehensive list of these resources and where to find them.
The Tartan sees great potential for the rollout of this survey, the data that will come from it, and most importantly, the watershed moment it represents for Carnegie Mellon. 
Though the university has not always had the best reputation for handling issues of SARV on campus (think the Beta Theta Pi and a Title IX complaint last year), it seems the university is making great strides to change the way SARV issues are handled on campus.
The Tartan staff will be participating in this survey, and urges students all across campus to do so as well. To provide better data to administration and faculty, honest feedback is important from the student body. Campus-wide participation and accurate feedback have the potential to improve SARV policies in a way that current data, such as information compiled in the Annual Security and Fire Safety Report, cannot.
In addition, next fall, when the results from the survey come out, it will be important for the administration to act thoughtfully with the gathered data and to encourage student participation in the survivor support network and other SARV initiatives. We must join together as a campus to work to make Carnegie Mellon a safer place.

Self-confidence is essential when interviewing for a position that requires self-motivation. Remember, you haven't been hired yet — be an attentive listener. 
Your firmness and stability are assets in any office, but when facing a prospective employer, tone it down a notch. Try to be collaborative. 
Your great curiosity makes you invaluable when the unexpected happens. Remember to listen as much as you talk. 
When you enter into the interview room, you might be a little nervous. Be sure to stay calm and clear your head of any anxious thoughts. 
True, you've been called for an interview, but you can't relax just yet. It's your time to shine, so give it all you've got. 
Attention to detail is your gift to any work position, but sometimes an interview is the time and place for getting an overview. Make sure you care about the big picture too. 
Shyness may be a problem, but if this job is worth it, you'll manage. Constantly remind yourself to be assertive. 
You can be hardcore, but a job interview may not be the place for such intensity. Dress conservatively and don't frighten anyone away. 
A take-charge attitude and great organizing skills will make you successful in the future. 
Let your interests and passions come out while you're interviewing. Show that you're genuinely interested in the position. 
Showing up early is much preferred to showing up late. Be there in a timely fashion to make a good impression. 
Be approachable. It's always good to keep the conversation flowing in a positive direction. If there is a topic you don't understand, it is much better to spend more time talking about the topics you have experience in.
