The Pittsburgh Penguins haven’t missed a playoff since Crosby’s rookie season in 2007. But this year might be the end of their 16-season streak. This has me asking, “OK Google, What the $#%& is going on with the Penguins?”
I am not super knowledgeable about hockey in general. However, I chose to become absolutely infatuated with the Pittsburgh Penguins at the beginning of my freshman year, and right now… I’m kind of regretting it. They’re currently doing absolute garbage, having lost just as many games as they’ve won (24-15-9) overall, and just absolutely eating shit in their last 20 games (8-7-5). They’re on an unsteady path towards the bottom of the league, so what gives? 
While most of my Penguins news comes from a few select Instagram and Twitter accounts, I believe I am informed enough to say that the recent slew of injuries is certainly not helping. It all started with Jason Zucker… just kidding. Even before every single player that has ever been helpful went out for various injuries, the Pens started the season off wrong with a seven-game losing streak that crushed my spirit. As far as I can tell, a lot of people like to blame that losing streak on Teddy Bleuger being out for an injury for the first 15 games of the season. I’m not sure how much I buy it, but things did start to look up for a bit after he came back. I personally would like to blame that streak on their special teams being sort of ass during that period. On that specific losing streak, the Pens only scored on four out of a whopping 26 power plays, and allowed seven shots on 22 penalty kills. This is pretty garbage!! Compare this to a stretch of seven better games from the beginning of December, where they successfully scored on 11 out of 27 PPs and killed 18 out of 22 penalties. We know what the Pens are capable of, so what the hell was going on?
Anyway, enough about October, back to the Penguins’ recent major suckage. I’ll go back to blaming this on injuries for now. Since mid-December, the Pens have been coming and going like mad. First Zucker, then Malkin, then Archibald, Poehling, Letang. The one that really broke my heart was seeing my most dearly beloved Tristan Jarry leave the Winter Classic halfway through the first period with a vague lower body injury, but the bad luck didn’t stop there. Just as we started to finally get a few players back, we were hit with more injuries to Petersson, Rutta, and Kapanen. Jarry returned for a whopping two games before leaving again with a brand new, unrelated upper body injury. What the hell is going on here? Do we need to wrap the players in bubble wrap to have a chance at the playoffs? Is this what we get for having the oldest team in the NHL? Am I being punished for something? The questions keep coming, but the answers remain elusive. 
My final Pens Beef™ is their absolute lack of any sort of skill as soon as regulation play ends. If I’m listening to or paying attention to a game, I literally abandon hope as soon as I know it’s going to OT. “But Haley,” you might be saying, “that’s so pessimistic, don’t you have any faith in the skills of your team?” NO I DO NOT! In this season, the Penguins have gone to overtime on 13 different occasions. Out of those thirteen times, do you know how many lead to a Peng-win? FOUR!! What is going on here?! Do they just forget how to play after 60 minutes? Honestly, I wouldn’t be surprised if it was less than that! They like to do this thing where they play one EXQUISITE period, and then proceed to be absolute dogwater for the rest of the game. How in God’s name did they blow a five point lead to the Redwings? Who knows! Certainly not me, and if bestie Mike Sullivan knows, he’s doing a dogshit job of fixing it. 
On a slightly less objective note, I personally like to blame Casey DeSmith for a lot of the Pens’ losses. I know it’s not really his fault, but blaming him is easy and free, and no one can stop me. Besides, how can I not hate him next to Tristan Jarry? With his 7-9-4 record up against Jarry’s 16-5-5, can you really blame me for crying out in anguish every time I hear DeSmith is in the net? 
In conclusion, no one can really name any one reason that the Pittsburgh Penguins are soggy right now. Maybe it’s because they’re old, maybe it’s because they’re injured, maybe they’re not giving it their best effort, or maybe it’s all that damned Casey DeSmith’s fault. Whatever it is, something needs to change fast if we want any shot at another Stanley Cup anytime soon. Better yet, what the hell — why not just tank for Bedard?

It was called the Tournament of Roses, and it was nothing if not a spectacle. A celebration of California, her flowers blooming in the first days of January, while much of the country was buried in snow. In some years it featured a race between ostriches, in others, an elephant was pitted against a camel. Held in Pasadena, it became America’s New Year Celebration: the Rose Parade.
But in the winter of 1902, the Tournament of Roses was none of these things. It was merely the celebration of a sunny city, of beautiful weather. A celebration that needed a central attraction. And they had one – a football game, between the Michigan University Wolverines, and the Stanford Cardinal. They called it the Tournament East-West Football Game.
The game was a blowout. A blowout so massive that the committee refused to host a football game until 1916, fearing that similar scores would push audiences away. But when the game recommenced over a decade later, it spawned a tradition. Through both world wars, through relocation to a new stadium, through it all, it remained. It was the Rose Bowl. It was the Granddaddy of them all.
In later years, the Rose Bowl was tied to conferences. It would host a game between the best ‘pacific coast team’, and the ‘best team in the east’. That ‘pacific coast team’ would become the best team in the Pacific Athletic Conference, the Pac-12, and that ‘best team in the east’ would become the champion of the current Big Ten athletic conference. The stadium would be renovated, rebuilt, and changed bit by bit to provide a stadium for the best of college football to show their skills, playing under the light of a neon sign.
At the last traditional Rose Bowl, Penn State was invited to play against Utah. It’s fitting, considering that a hundred years ago, USC and Penn State battled it out in the first Rose Bowl in the first ever game at their current stadium. A hundred years of that stadium, over a hundred of that tradition, ended with their 35-21 victory over Utah this January. 
The neon sign, red and green, that flickers above the entrance to the stadium, has witnessed the greatest teams in college football play. While it’ll witness many more, after this year, the Rose Bowl will no longer be the East-West game. The game will no longer feature the Pac-12 and the Big 10 exclusively. Those conference tie-ins, what once defined the Rose Bowl, will be no more. The college football playoffs have claimed the sport’s oldest tradition, and the stadium will now feature one of many playoff matchups. And while it’s possible that the Pac-12 will meet the Big Ten at that stadium again, it won’t be an iconic Rose Bowl matchup. It would be a chance meeting, a step on the way to the national championship. It’ll just be another playoff game.
It’s hard to say goodbye. If you grew up watching the Rose Bowl, seeing it become just another stadium is hard. But college football is changing, now more than ever. Conferences have realigned, athletes are making millions. Rivalries forged in blood and sweat have died, and new ones are forming. The last traditional Rose Bowl is the end of an era, one that followed the development and popularization of football. This new era begins with football at its zenith, the most popular sport in America. It begins today, and by 2024, the sport may look completely different. And the Rose Bowl, in one form or another, will continue through it all.

Men’s Basketball
On Jan. 22, the Tartans hosted #22 Washington University in Wiegend Gymnasium. Though WashU opened with an early 7-2 lead, the Tartans scored 16 straight, taking an 18-7 lead. However, the Bears would attempt to retake the lead, getting within six points two more times during the first half. However, the Tartans closed out the half with nine more points to the Bears’ two, making it 35-22 at the half. 
Coming back on the court, Carnegie Mellon took two three-pointers, making it 41-22. However, a series of runs from both followed. WashU had a 10-2 run, making it 43-32 with 13:35 left in the game. For the next four minutes, the teams scored fairly equally, putting the score at 54-43. However, another Bears run would bring them to just a point behind the Tartans, 58-57. Thanks to a large effort in the last five minutes, the Tartans were able to secure a 71-58 victory.
The Tartans, however, wouldn’t see the same success when they traveled to New York University on Jan. 27. Despite opening the game with a 6-0 lead, the Tartans would quickly fall behind the Violets, 11-8. A long run from NYU for the rest of the half had the scoreboard reading 39-19 at the break.
Another run from the Violets at the start of the second half had the Tartans behind by 36 with just over nine minutes left in play, 69-33. Though the Tartans outscored the Violets in the rest of the game, it wasn’t enough to make a comeback, with the scoreboard reading 79-55 Violets at the end. 
The men’s basketball team is now 11-6, with a 3-3 conference record. They’ll be looking to make a comeback against NYU when they host them in Wiegand Gymnasium on Friday, Feb. 3 for a  7:30 p.m. tipoff. 
Women’s Basketball
Looking to break their losing streak, the Carnegie Mellon women’s basketball team took on Washington University on Sunday, Jan. 22. The game opened with a daily close score, with both teams at seven halfway through the first quarter. However Washington would soon pull ahead, recording 17 to the Tartans’ 12 by the end of the first quarter. A Bears run at the open of the second quarter would put them even further ahead, 25-15. The Tartans would continue to fall behind, with the scoreboard reading 40-27 at the end of the first half.
The third quarter would be a totally different story for The Tartans, though. Thanks to the Tartans hitting 42.9 percent from the floor in the third quarter, they came within three points of the Bears at the end of the quarter, 53-50. A three-pointer from sophomore Catherine Or at the start of the third quarter tied the game for the first time since the first quarter, with the Tartans later taking their first lead, 67-66. However, the Bears would score seven straight and the Tartans were only able to come within one. The Bears converted two free throws at the end of the game, giving them a 77-74 win over the Tartans.
On the road, the Tartans traveled to New York University to take on the sixth-ranked team on Friday, Jan. 27. The Tartans weren’t able to find an early rhythm, falling behind 23-9 by the end of the first quarter. However, they were able to keep it just under even in the second quarter, scoring 15 to the Violet’s 19, making it 42-24. They would be able to outscore NYU in the third quarter, but eventually fell behind again in the fourth quarter. As the clock hit zero for the last time, the scoreboard read 77-52, giving the Tartans their sixth straight loss.
These losses have put the women’s team at 9-8 for the season and 0-6 in conference play. They will be looking to make a comeback against NYU when they host them on Friday, Feb 3 for a 5:30 p.m. tipoff.
Men’s Track and Field

The Eagles-49ers NFC Championship was a mess. The audience was put through what was quite possibly the worst game in what has already proved to be one of the most boring NFL playoffs in history. But to get to all that, we have to start at the beginning.
The NFL changed rules for the 2020-2021 season, adding a new 7th seed that could make their way to the Super Bowl and take home the trophy. But those 7th seeds have been terrible. And by terrible I mean god-awful. In the two years before this year, the 7th seed had gone 0-4, losing by an average of 13 points — they were boring slogs that were awful to watch.
So the 2023 playoffs were expected to start terribly, with the hope that things would pick up in the second round. 
Except that’s not what happened. The Jacksonville Jaguars, led by Football Jesus Trevor Lawrence, pulled off a 27 point comeback to beat the LA Chargers. A day later, Miami, playing their backup, lost a fun, close game to Buffalo. The Giants upset the Vikings, while the Ravens and the Bengals played it close. The first round was wrapped up with Tom Brady getting hammered at home, which is always fun to watch.
To keep count, that’s four great games, out of six played, with a couple upsets and one of the biggest comebacks in NFL playoff history to boot. All in all, these playoffs were looking good.
You might have made the mistake of enjoying football. Stop that. We don’t do that here. This is the place where sports fans go to die.
After coming to terms with the fact that no, New York cannot have nice things, the Bills crashed against the Bengals. The Eagles steamrolled over the Giants 38-7, and the Cowboys and 49ers played a game that consisted almost entirely of field goals, with a patented Cowboy meltdown at the end. Only Jacksonville gave us a good time, holding the Chiefs to one score, but even they lost. 
One good game out of four. Where were those fun games we were promised?
Fools had hope for a pair of interesting championship games. Good teams playing good teams in entertaining games, with classic catches and breakout stars.
And that brings us back to the Eagles-49ers NFC Championship, a game that had been hyped to hell and back. And for good reason! 
A lot of us were excited to watch Brock Purdy — Mr. Irrelevant, the last player picked in the draft — prove himself. The Philadelphia Eagles were hungry for their second ever Super Bowl title, boasting one of the best rookie quarterbacks in the league, paired with a ferocious offense. The 49ers had a well-oiled machine, the best defense of the year, and were ready for anything the Eagles could throw at them. Their run game was honed to perfection behind running back Christian McCaffrey, while the Eagles were relying on an amazing wide receiver room to bring home points. It was the unstoppable force against the immovable object.
The game delivered for all of about three minutes. Before even a quarter of the game had been played, Purdy went down to injury, bringing in the 49ers fourth backup QB of the season. You heard me right, the fourth. And that backup backup backup QB got injured too, sending back an injured Brock Purdy to try to salvage the game, only for him to immediately leave. By the end, SF had given up on quarterbacks altogether, and had resorted to handing the ball off to a running back. 
Meanwhile, the Eagles scored off of an incomplete pass (which was so obviously incomplete that the refs must be blind), and had a kick bounce off a camera line. Both teams committed so many penalties that I’m surprised the NFL didn’t suspend the entire game for unsportsmanlike conduct. And that’s not even mentioning the ACTUAL GOD DAMNED BRAWL. 
This game was dirty. It was ugly. It was boring. And worst of all, it wasn’t fun. It’s not fun watching a team that has spent blood, sweat, and tears to make it here have some of the worst luck in history. It’s not fun watching a guy who hasn’t played the sport on a professional level ever get tackled over and over again. It’s not fun watching a team crumble while they can’t do a single damn thing to stop it.
Philly Punched a ticket to the Super Bowl today, and to them, congratulations. They’ll face whoever wins the Chiefs-Bengals game. The 49ers will pack up and go home, trying to figure out how another amazing season ended in nothing more than bad luck. And this mess of a postseason will chug along.
But hey, at least it’s only one more week.

If you don’t like a venture capitalist’s offer, tell them “hell no.” That was one of the many lessons from a Carnegie Mellon alumnus. At the CMU Blockchain Club’s Speaker Event on Jan. 25, Austin Mitchell, co-founder and CEO of the Bitcoin technology startup Synota, shared some tips for future entrepreneurs: communicate, refine, and dream. 
As Bitcoin dropped nearly 50 percent in price in the span of three months, Mitchell wanted to leave his public utility job to ... create a Bitcoin startup. Mitchell saw an opportunity to offer energy services to Bitcoin mining facilities, but because the idea contained cryptocurrencies, it was pushed off the table. So Mitchell assembled a team, raised money for their company Synota in the bear market of May-June of 2021, and by the end of July, they had everything they needed to finish their day jobs. Overall, Mitchell's fundraising experience wasn’t easy, but he did have a high rate of conversations to money. Venture capitalists (VCs) seemed enthusiastic about the intersection between cryptocurrency, energy, and the possibility of solving a big problem. After all, the energy value chain, retrieving and dispersing payments from consumers to multiple suppliers, is filled with overhead and inefficiencies. Synota is the first Bitcoin startup to tackle the issue, and the Bitcoin VCs Austin spoke with emphasized that they had been waiting for this approach for a while. 
Everything is about communication, he stated. Simply put, nobody will give you money if they don’t like you. So build relationships, show respect, show up on time, and do all the right things. People in VC land are just like normal people — dig in and make it a priority to get to know them, because it’s a mutual relationship. If you make VCs feel like a priority, you’re a priority to them. 
Looking back, Mitchell says he grew tremendously as a person and founder. Although Mitchell had no negotiation classes under his belt, he raised over three million dollars in funds. He said that in any situation, you need to be very deliberate. But also take a moment and put yourself into their shoes. Have a 5-10 minute conversation and try to truly understand their wants and needs in relation to your position. 
Mitchell shared with the audience a moment when he had to negotiate a sum of $500,000. About three-quarters into the funding timeline, a Synota investor recommended negotiating hard with another VC. The Synota investor broke down the position for Austin, and he was left with a task: Call someone who’s been in the VC world his entire life, someone who Austin needed a half-a-million dollar check from, and tell him “hell no” followed by a counteroffer. Austin recognized that he didn’t feel good. He shared that at any stage, you’ll have that imposter syndrome, a dreadful thought that you’re just lucky to be there and nothing more. People are lucky, but you also deserve to be there, and how you reconcile with those two things is essential, Austin emphasized. In the end, the VC called him back in 30 minutes and agreed to Austin’s terms. 
Finally, dream big. There is no reward through the startup process by being anything less than bold, Mitchell told listeners. He took inspiration from one of Synota’s lead investors, who always pushed the team to think more boldly. The team could see all the next steps and “what if” questions in their journey, so the investor told them to do and say just that. From the lead investor, to Mitchell, and to the next big entrepreneur, know that you’re trying to change the world; don’t discount yourself or the vision.  
“You guys might forget about me, or [you] can say 'you knew me [back] when [I wasn’t big yet,]’” Mitchell said. If he can brave an intimidating VC, quit his quantitative analysis job when the market looked grim, and still stand to tell the tale, I look forward to telling everyone that I had the chance to speak with him way back when.

CMU RESEARCH ROUNDUP
Enabling speech recognition for lesser-known languages
For computers to recognize speech, they need to be provided with both text and audio. For popular languages like English, there is a wealth of both text and audio data. For lesser-known languages, text data might exist, but audio data is likely to be sparse. This means that of about 8,000 languages spoken across the world, most speech recognition technologies can only recognize 200 languages.
Researchers in Carnegie Mellon's Language Technologies Institute (LTI) hope to bring speech recognition to lesser-known languages by utilizing the similarities between commonly used languages and lesser-known ones. Most speech recognition technologies focus on phonemes, sounds that distinguish one word from a similar-sounding word, like the "d" in "dog" as opposed to the "l" in "log." However, the LTI researchers hope to utilize phones, which are sounds that are physically produced by language speakers, but don't necessarily differentiate between words. 
The researchers are creating a language-approximation tool which analyzes how phones are shared between languages. This could reduce the need for audio data on lesser-known languages and allow models to recognize speech for up to 2000 languages. Currently, their model improves language-approximation tools by about 5 percent, but while they continue to improve the model, they hope that their work could serve as inspiration for other researchers.
80 percent of glaciers could be gone within the century
In a paper published in "Science," Civil & Environmental Engineering professor David Rounce and other international collaborators estimate that in a worst-case scenario, 40 percent of the glacial mass will be gone within the century, accounting for 80 percent of the world's glaciers. In a best-case scenario, over 25 percent of glacial mass will be gone, accounting for 50 percent of glaciers by number. These projections come from a model using shared socioeconomic pathways, data on mass changes for individual glaciers, and calibrations that require the use of supercomputers. Rounce is also working on accounting for different types of glaciers such as tidewater or debris-covered glaciers, which can influence the rate of glacial melt. The researchers hope that nations will make more ambitious climate pledges and lower the 2.7 degree Celsius global temperature goal. 
Matyjaszewski wins 2023 National Academy of Sciences Award in Chemical Sciences
Krzysztof Matyjaszewski, J.C. Warner University Professor of Natural Sciences, will receive the National Academy of Sciences Award in Chemical Sciences in April for his advancements in polymer chemistry. He is recognized for discovering and developing atom transfer radical polymerization (ATRP), a method of forming polymers that allows scientists to easily control their molecular architecture. ATRP has been used in inkjet printing, cosmetics, packing material, adhesives, and could potentially be used for drug delivery, scaffolding for bone regeneration, degradable plastics, and other applications.

At Purdue, Mayer helped achieve record growth in external funding for basic and use-inspired research and diversified its portfolio of major sponsors. Mayer comes from a background in advanced manufacturing of nanoscale electronic, optical and biomedical devices, and has advised government councils and committees on science, technology, and policy issues.
NATIONAL NEWS
ChatGPT and the latest in AI technology
If you're in the tech field, on the Internet, or even remotely social, you've probably heard about ChatGPT, which has taken the internet by storm since it was fully released to the public in November 2022. 
ChatGPT is a chatbot project by OpenAI, an AI research and development company that produced DALL-E, the prompt-driven AI art generator that spawned the AI art craze, as well as the line of GPT language models, the latest being GPT-3, that can generate text response to text prompts. While OpenAI's GPT language models have been available commercially for years, ChatGPT profoundly expanded the public's access to these models by allowing users to submit prompts in a conversational format with a user-friendly interface.
It is safe to say that ever since, ChatGPT has spawned both panic and fascination. Developers, analysts, and writers marvel at its ability to accomplish tasks they perform in their jobs. Some are worried that it signals that AI is beginning to take away white-collar jobs. Others believe that AI can augment human work, ushering in a wave of new opportunities and increased productivity.
Of course, ChatGPT is not the only cutting-edge chatbot or AI-enabled system out there. Google, who developed the neural network at the core of ChatGPT, has also developed their own chatbot LaMDA, or Language Model for Dialogue Applications. The recent AI hype has spawned a variety of AI generators ranging from meeting summaries to marketing videos to obituaries. 
It's still worth noting that ChatGPT still can give inaccurate answers (even on simple math questions), but can be misleadingly confident in its answers. Its simple and concise explanations are persuasive but blend fact with fiction, leading to many worried about it spreading misinformation.
AI-enabled systems can also be used suboptimally. For example, many marketing teams use machine learning for data analytics, identifying users that are likely to stop viewing social media or website pages in order to prevent them from leaving. However, studies show that focusing efforts on users that are about to leave the page might not lead to higher user retention. 
This new wave of AI and AI-enabled systems both excites and merits further consideration about the future of AI, education, work, and society.
FDA contemplates an annual coronavirus vaccine
As COVID-19 persists, it continues to evolve, spawning new variants that can infect those already vaccinated. This has led the FDA to propose offering a booster coronavirus vaccine every fall, much like they already do for the flu. Scientists also hope that the regularity of vaccine administration will incentivize more civilians to get the most recent vaccinations, as only 15 percent of Americans have gotten the latest booster dose.
While those who see the benefits of flu shots may find the proposal appealing, some scientists and FDA advisors found the proposal surprising. 
For one, scientists don't feel that there is enough evidence suggesting civilians need annual doses. Some feel that they would like more information on who is most vulnerable to the virus and tailor the vaccine plan to them.
The FDA must also consider which vaccine to administer. The coronavirus has evolved quickly and is expected to continue creating new variants. The FDA has proposed that these vaccines be bivalent, meaning that they contain strains of the original virus and newer variants. However, studies have shown that bivalent vaccines may not be as effective as monovalent vaccines, because the body is more inclined to recognize the original virus rather than the new virus. Some experts feel that offering only monovalent vaccines tailored to the new viruses would be more effective. Some also suggest simplifying the vaccine to only target specific parts of the coronavirus.

Our new vision is one of a vibrant and living campus, exposed in our pages through text and images. You are the first light to view the pages we have printed here. As goes with our new mission statement, "We strive to curate the best of arts at Carnegie Mellon, including a wide range of diverse voices and highlighting what's new on campus and how it reflects us as a student body." If this is your first time reading pillbox, consider making it your first time writing for pillbox. We believe all students have something valuable to say, and we want to be the ones to make it available to our readers (who now include you!). Once upon a time, Zach and I (Anna) were just regular old folks, and then we became junior staff writers, and then we became friends, and now we're co-editors. This heartwarming story could be yours, for the small price of 700 words. Reach out to acappell@andrew.cmu.edu or zgelman@andrew.cmu.edu if you're interested.

Chances are, if you have been on social media within the past couple of months, you have seen at least one image of the Carnegie Museum of Art’s new exhibition, whether it be the giant gold pillars of balloons crowded within the Hall of Sculpture, the gigantic meat grinder, or a tree with legal bodily autonomy. These pieces, along with hundreds of others, are what make up the 58th Carnegie International. 
The Carnegie International was established in 1896 and, according to the CMOA’s website, “is the longest-running North American exhibition of international art.” The show happens every three to four years and invites artists from all over the globe to participate. This year’s show, curated by Sohrab Mohebbi, focuses on the United States' geo-political impact on other countries. The show, entitled “Is it morning for you yet?”, includes several self-contained segments within the framework of the show itself, including but not limited to: a retrospective of the Indonesian artist Kustiyah, a small collection of works created or owned by Iranian artist Fereydoun Ave, and Refractions, a large part of the show that addresses various international political struggles and how America intervened. 
One of the biggest strengths of the show is how well the pieces that are displayed close together dialectically fit and allow for previously unconsidered connections to be explored by the viewer. The segmenting adds to this strength, and allows visitors to digest the show in pieces, rather than all at once. I will say, it is very easy to get overwhelmed when viewing this show if taken in all at once—not only because of its size and scope, but also because of its subject matter. 
Take the example of the pillar of balloons, created by Banu Cennetoğlu, in the Hall of Sculpture. Though it looks as if the balloons should be proclaiming a student’s graduation or maybe someone's sweet sixteen, each pillar instead spells out one of the first ten articles of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, which was agreed upon by the United Nations in 1948. Though the pillars started the show tall and intense, the balloons have been slowly deflating throughout the duration of International. This deflation, of course, is an attempt to mirror the UN’s (or America’s) waning attention given to the tenets of the Declaration. As if to further highlight this point, the walls of the Hall of Sculpture are beautifully painted by Vietnam-born artist Thu Van Tran in soft, pastel hues; however, upon further inspection, one will realize that they are the exact colors of the herbicides and defoliants used by the U.S. during the Vietnam War. In addition, the Hall of Sculpture also holds Hiromi Tsuchida’s “Hiroshima Trilogy” photos, which document personal items found after the 1945 bombing and if the original owners were ever found (whether dead or alive). 
Though what I’ve described makes up a very small portion of the show, I think it is a great snapshot of “Is it morning for you yet?”; visually striking, part art show and part historically driven interrogation of international relations, something worth witnessing in person (though you will not leave the museum happily skipping back towards campus). The wall text for the exhibition celebrates a now (semi) post-pandemic world, but the International seems to carry the heaviness of the political turmoil and alienation that COVID-19 has brought to the forefront of everyone’s minds. Is this an inevitable outcome of the world-changing events that we have experienced over the past three years, or simply an over-politicized show focused on the negatives in an attempt to stay topical? I think it is up to each viewer to visit the exhibition, hopefully even several times over, and deeply consider everything they experience before coming to their own conclusion.  The Carnegie International is open from now until April 2, 2023, and all Carnegie Mellon students have free access to the museum and its exhibitions.

i know now that my first love is long gone
no matter how much the song is in him
it will never be enough to be enough
that salty, sage smell again from the chest
the rail is a runway for a body
i know now that my last taste is long gone
this last one is about life, he said and
took my hand in every other language
it will never be kindness to be enough
we are arrived at the plateau, the orange
the green, centered teeth on the green altar
i know now that my first love is buried
with an eye-shaped hole in the center of 
my chest i can feel the air, i can see
it will never be your way to be light
breathe, lean back, against me, against water
ask me what i know about white; i’ll say
i know now that my first love is long gone
it will never be enough to be enough

Author's Note: A PDF of the short story I mention is linked in the online version of this article
Over break, I saw The Collaboration on Broadway, a play about the complicated relationship between the artists Andy Warhol and Jean-Michel Basquiat. Starring Paul Bettany as Warhol and Jeremy Pope as Basquiat (and featuring Carnegie Mellon Drama school alum Eric Jensen), the play is carried by the strength of its cast who all deliver extremely compelling performances in a production that is otherwise relatively low on spectacle. However, this isn't a review of that play (recently extended through February 11th! Go see it!).
Admittedly, I knew so little about Warhol that I spent about 20 minutes before the show reading his Wikipedia page, from which I learned that Warhol attended a small Pittsburgh school called the Carnegie Institute of Technology. Not only that, but it's believed that his first two pieces of published artwork appeared in the student art newspaper, Cano (which only ran for eight issues in the late 40s). When I got back to campus, I wasted no time contacting the University Archives to see if I could actually look at these seminal pieces of modern art history. 
I was guided by a blog post by Blake Gopnik, an art critic and Warhol biographer, who meticulously searched every page of every Cano issue in search of any previously unknown Warhol pieces. And on issue eight, he finds an illustration that — for various art reasons I don't understand — he assures us is a Warhol. Seeing as someone else had already done the heavy lifting of finding this piece, it was relatively easy for me to get a hold of it. 
Still going by Andrew Warhola (before he dropped the "-a" to make his name less slavic), the piece depicts a man and woman whose faces are covered in spiraled blotches. Warhol utilizes his signature "blotted-line" technique, something which highly educated art-knowing types get very excited about (read Gopnik's blog if that stuff interests you). It accompanies an extraordinarily depressing short story titled "Only This Hour," written by Jane E. Harris, a sophomore drama student. She writes a story about a young Austrian married couple who are reunited after years of separation due to the war. It's told from the perspective of the husband, Kurt, who finds that the brutal conditions of the work camps have made his wife ugly. He's filled with disgust — and while in a drunken stupor, he realizes that he too has become ugly. Overcome with guilt for the way he has treated his wife, he abandons her. I was kindly sent a scan of this story by the University Archives, so if you have 10 minutes to spare, it's honestly a very good read. 
He then graduated from CIT, moved to New York, and became one of the most famous artists in the world. Andy Warhol has possibly one of the most well-documented lives of any historical figure. He created over 600 "time capsules" — boxes of stuff he made so that future historians would have an ocean of ephemera to wade through when studying his life. He obsessively recorded things on his video camera, and left behind over 50,000 polaroid photos. It's going to be hard to compress his life into an appropriately short two-page Pillbox spread — Gopnik's biography was nearly 1,000 pages, so I'm going to have to triage the important details. 
In short, Warhol was a massively influential modern artists and social critic, whose works comment on the relationship between consumerism, art, and business in a way that is often buried under so many layers of meta-self-awareness that you get a headache trying to understand which level of irony he's operating on. His work can be controversial because it straddles the line between art and a mass-produced commodity, which I'm sure is intended to make some point about the blurry line between art and business (something something capitalism, brands, images, and so forth). I'm endlessly fascinated by "Andy Warhol Performing Eating a Hamburger, 1982," a video in which he eats a hamburger, and then tells us that he has eaten a hamburger. Is it genius? Is he absolutely full of himself? Is the fact that I'm confused (and thus talking about it and perpetuating his art) the point? Probably that.
There are, however, some more controversial elements of his life that feel important to mention. His studio, nicknamed "The Factory," is where workers would mass-produce his pieces and Warhol would direct short (often sexually explicit) films. He brought in artists, aspiring performers, drag queens, musicians, and other creatives, making it the epicenter of the pop-art counterculture movement. However, it was far from the decentralized anarchist artistic collective one might hope for — it was still Warhol's place, and he was in charge. He often expected his workers at the factory to work for free, even though these people physically produced his works that sold for millions. It also seems Warhol fostered a callous, manipulative work culture. Edie Sedgwick was one of Warhol's "superstars" — she had a falling out with Warhol due to a filming scene which she felt was exploitative and abusive. After their relationship soured, Warhol is said to have remarked "I wonder when Edie will commit suicide. I hope she lets us know so we could film it.” Sedgwick died of a drug overdose at age 28. Andrea Feldman was another actress in Warhol's inner circle, who also struggled with substance abuse (something fostered by the culture at the Factory),and committed suicide at age 24.
This is all to say that Andrew Warhol is an extremely complicated person, which can be explored thanks to the almost unimaginable amount of biographical material that exists about him. Maybe that's why we keep making documentaries and plays about him. I won't make any strong conclusions about the man — I only researched him for about a week. But I think his drawings are pretty neat.

Fear not weary reader; no spoilers lie ahead!
Over winter break, I had the opportunity to fulfill my lifelong dream of doing nothing but watching movies all day every day, and it was absolutely glorious. Over the span of 26 days, I was able to watch 40 movies — but only one stood out to me enough that I watched it twice. “Puss in Boots: The Last Wish” was released at the end of 2022 and by God, it was the best thing to come out of that whole year. Taking place years after the events of the SCU (“Shrek” Cinematic Universe), “The Last Wish” follows our favorite fearless hero, Puss in Boots, as he risks his ninth and final life racing a magical menagerie of opponents to find the one thing that will allow him to regain his lives and escape death.
Let’s start with one of the most obvious merits of this movie: the story. Going into the theater, I was expecting something akin to the first “Puss in Boots” — a silly kids movie, fun to watch, but not really that memorable.  HOLY MACKEREL was I wrong! This movie centers around a race towards the Wishing Star, which can grant one wish to someone who uses its map to locate it. The list of our competitors starts with Puss, who wishes to gain more lives, as well as his companions Kitty Softpaws (who you may or may not remember from the first movie) and the most adorably ugly little creature to ever grace a movie screen, Perrito. They also race against renowned crime family Goldilocks and the Three Bears, who will wish for something to make everything Just Right, and corrupt pie magnate Jack Horner (assisted by his Baker’s Dozen), who will wish for all of the magic in the world to be his and his alone. 
As the teams make their way towards the Star, they are forced to travel through obstacles conjured up by the map to make them see what’s really important. I won’t give away too much more plot, because I promised no spoilers (and I need EVERYONE to watch this movie), but I will say that the whole story is genuinely heartwarming, and it had me teared up in the movie theater — both times. All of the characters are ridiculously charming. I especially loved Goldi and the Bears; their family dynamic is so so fun and loving and quirky, and they’re just perfect to me. One last thing — Puss isn’t just after these lives for funsies. Due to his cavalier disregard for danger eight times over, he is now being pursued by Death himself. He has to stay moving and get to the Star, before Death can get to him. Portrayed by a huge wolf with beady, unblinking red eyes, and announced with a low, eerie whistle every time he’s near, Death is a genuinely unsettling character, and I’m not a child. I cannot fathom how scary this guy must be to any actual children who have seen this movie. 
Next on the roster of Immaculate Items is the score. Composed by Heitor Pereira, this score is enchanting and charming all on its own. However, one of my absolute favorite parts of “The Last Wish” was how the soundtrack often synced up with the animation during big action sequences. I was basically foaming at the mouth during the first big fight, where an awakened giant swings a church bell around as a weapon. As he repeatedly swings and misses, huge hits in the music line up with the bell smashing into things as Puss easily dodges the attacks. It is so, so pleasing to witness, especially when paired with… 
The animation style. This is the one thing that really had me absolutely raving the instant the lights came up in the theater. The best way that I can describe this art style is that it’s like if a storybook came to life. You know how “Into the Spiderverse” was all comic book-y? “The Last Wish” is like that, but with painterly storybook illustrations. It is so, so, so charming, and WAYYYY more pleasing to look at than the janky early 2000’s 3D animated Puss that we’re used to seeing. I really can’t give the animation high enough praise, you just have to see it for yourself.
In describing this movie to people, the word that I find myself using most often is “delightful,” because it really is delightful in every single way! Delightfully beautiful, delightfully heartwarming, delightfully funny, the list goes on. That being said, on my world-renowned Good Time-Bad Time scale, “Puss in Boots: The Last Wish” receives an emphatic “delightful, in every sense of the word.”

Soup may not be the first thing that comes to mind when thinking about the Carnegie Mellon community, but the fifth annual Soup Crawl hosted by Carnegie Mellon Dining Services on Wednesday showcased both the universality of soup and how soup can bridge connections between cultures. The Soup Crawl this year featured specialized soup recipes from Chartwells chefs, as well as classic campus favorites that can be found daily at Au Bon Pain, The Exchange, and the Underground. This event not only incentivized students to try dining locations that they don’t usually frequent, but it also provided a few hours of warm, comforting soup slurping amidst a cold and rainy winter day. Through my experience of the Soup Crawl, I found that it was about more than just tasting soups, but was a chance to bond with friends and sample a variety of different cuisines. 
The Soup Crawl was introduced to campus in 2017 by the Program Director of Nutrition and Marketing at Carnegie Mellon Jessica Tones. The idea came from Tones' observation that “We’re a soup-loving campus.” When tasked with creating programs that cast a spotlight on the diverse vendors around campus, Tones noted the unique student interest in soups and saw an opportunity for a low-key event that fit students’ desired participation level. The Soup Crawl also takes place during the SLICE Winter Welcome program, promoting community-building through shared cultural and culinary exploration.
Each year, the Soup Crawl culminates in a vote for the soup that participants deem soup-erior. For the first two years of the Soup Crawl, The Exchange’s soup won the student vote. After that, the winner was a ramen dish from the former dining spot iNoodle. A special highlight of the Soup Crawl is the personalized soups made by Chartwells executive chefs. These chefs compete against each other using recipes of their choice. The next year, Chef Don’s coconut curry chicken soup was pronounced the winner. Last year marked a shocking milestone in Soup Crawl history, as a soup from the Underground and a soup from Au Bon Pain tied for first place. The soup champion for this year has not yet been announced. 
Personally, I found the Soup Crawl to be a source of amusement and joy in the course of the stressful school week. In my pursuit to taste all the available soups, I experienced some emotional highs and lows, but overall had an educational and entertaining experience reviewing soups with my friends. Notably, my favorite part of the Soup Crawl was the Chartwells chefs’ soups. In part, these soups were so special because they were unique to the chef who made them. They tasted like something that a family member would make — a culinary quality that a college student craves while away from home. Chef Vic’s tomato bisque was a creamy classic, and Sous Chef Francine’s vegetable soup offered a tasty vegan option. I greatly enjoyed Chef Tessa’s Thai chicken and rice soup. It was soft and flavorful, with the rice and mild spices adding an element of coziness. In sum, I thought it was the perfect comfort soup. If someone offered me this soup while I was sick, I would probably be immediately healed. However, the real soup-erstar of the Soup Crawl for me was Chef Rob’s white turkey chili. This was simply an impeccable soup. The flavor profile was strong, but not overwhelming. Its texture was ideal, with a mix of ground turkey and whole beans that created a unique mouth feel. First-year Eisa Mazrouei proclaimed that it “tasted familiar even though I’d never had it before.” This soup was truly a bowl-scraper. 
Beneath the surface of this event as a fun opportunity to try soups was the chance for enriching cultural exchange through food. Soup is a practically ubiquitous food, but is different in every culture. I enjoyed the chefs’ soups so much because they were personal — I was learning about someone’s life experiences by eating their food. Tones emphasized this point, saying that “there’s something really universal about the way we can care for other people through the food that we make and chefs love to do that. This is an opportunity for them to tell their food story through the soups that they make.” Student response to this is clearly positive. “When you’re watching students tasting the food and interacting with the chef, you see the gratitude,” Jessica remarked. Through soup — and through participating in the Soup Crawl — we can exchange cultural traditions, learn stories about other people’s lives, spend quality time with our close friends, and become a more connected community.

“Whoa, the movie never ends, It goes on and on and on and on...” - Journey, Don’t Stop Believin'
A sequel of any piece of art implies that the story of the first entry in a would-be series is incomplete. If said first entry concluded with a tight ribbon, the sequel will suffer. Contemporary Hollywood is releasing sequels more frequently than not, with an unofficial guarantee that if a film performs marvelously at the box office, within the next few years, there will be a sequel. This statement is proven by looking at any “Most Anticipated Movies of the Year” list. Every IP is being milked dry, and the artform is no longer populated by ideas formed by visionaries, but industrialized, elongated variations of past stories.
Admittedly, many were shocked when James Cameron actually delivered on this project that has seemingly been in production limbo for the past 12 or so years: a sequel to the behemoth that is "Avatar" (2009). This sequel, according to Cameron, has been planned since the release of the original Avatar with up to three more films, the majority of which has already been shot during the filming for "Way of Water," which, at least to me, bodes ominously for the series.
The original "Avatar" is highly divisive. It was, and still is, a technological miracle. It has some of the greatest visual effects ever. It sweeps you from normalcy, taking you to the far away moon-planet of Pandora, where nine-foot-tall blue people exist. It is practically the pure essence of escapism, but escapism is not all it takes to craft a good motion picture.
The storyline and writing of the first "Avatar" was not given the same amount of time and attention that the CGI received, and it isn’t hard to tell. The story, which can be summed up as “environmental Dances With Wolves but in space,” was at some points sloppy and undercooked. Characters were either flat, one-dimensional, or comically stereotypical, and the big plot target, the whole reason why we should even care about the battle between an army of humans and giant blue aliens was a metal named (get this) “unobtainium.” Isn’t that the most clever writing ever? Suffice to say, it was this underwhelming performance of the dramatics that made it fall flat.
Did they fix the flaws of the first film? Short answer: no. But that’s not to say it was a bad movie. "Way of Water’s" visuals, its wide sweeping vistas, landscapes, ocean depths, and underwater spectacles are some of the greatest visuals ever put to film. I did not think that it was possible to make the first film look more realistic, but "Avatar 2" manages to accomplish just that. A smaller screen does not do it justice, as when projected on giant canvas, you can tell just how much detail every single little object and element has. It is overwhelming to think that this is what modern computer technology is capable of, and that something so fantastical and absurd can appear so tangible and telluric.
It is, however, this constant stream of spectacle that distracts the watcher from analyzing what the film is about. Unfortunately, both "Way of Water’s" story and message are pretty-looking, pretty lackluster rehashes of the original movie. This sequel’s thin plot is a retelling, in which Colonel Quaritch (Stephen Lang) is revived in the form of a Na’vi so that he can raise an army once again and attempt to terminate Jake Sully (Sam Worthington). Following Quaritch on a journey shockingly similar to Sully's in the first movie (including a few sequences replicated shot-for-shot) came off as second-rate. Meanwhile, the other half of the first act has Sully and his family learning how to become water Na’vi, again, similar to the first film. In fact, one of the main complaints of the entire picture is just how much is not happening.
The entire movie’s bloated three-hour and twelve-minute runtime is far too long for the amount of substance that the film delivers, even when taking into consideration the many frequent beauty shots that we are spoon fed to keep us in our theatre seats. Of course, it was those beauty shots which got us into the seats to begin with, but that doesn’t mean that there can't be a beautiful story to go along with the action. You have to remind yourself that this is the same writer/director who did "Terminator 2," which had some of the greatest action ever, as well as a powerful and meaningful story, and also "Titanic," which still managed to pull its weight to be one of the most famous romantic-dramas ever. In comparison, the story of this movie is underwhelming.
At times, the relationship between Jake Sully and his family does bring good scenes of emotion and distress. However, while you do feel weight and risk in some of the action, it sometimes fizzles out. It seems as if many script meetings must have consisted of finding out how many times they could make Jake’s children plunge themselves into danger so that Jake could save them. I understand that it's the kids who are ultimately meant to save the parents in the end, but it fails to weave this thread in a satisfying way.
Another issue is the cliché of the children, who do not develop out of their dumb disappointing dispositions and temperaments. Watching them interact with one another feels more like you’re watching an episode of "The Animaniacs" than a multi-hundred million dollar A-list production, with them annoyingly calling each other “bro” to a cringeworthy degree. Is this what older people think kids sound like? At the same time, Kiri, one of Sully’s children and basically the main one important to the plot, is played by a now 73-year-old Sigourney Weaver and although she is always a welcoming voice to hear, her voice, frankly, does not belong to a child. It is a matter of bad casting.
As the film ends, after the grand battle and all the final emotions spill out, there is no confusion on the point that Cameron wanted to make. Save the oceans, protect the ecosystems, and feel the pain of the animals who inhabit the world with us; all of the same points as in the original, but this time in the sea. It’s something that Cameron clearly believes just as much as he did 14 years ago, and for what it’s worth, he does set up the next films. Quaritch lives in the end, and you know that the army and their guns will keep coming back again and again.
I wanted this film to be great, and it was a wonderful aesthetic experience. The visuals carry this otherwise slightly-better-than-mediocre movie. Just like the first film, where people remember "Avatar's" enchantment rather than the story, "Avatar 2" will surely go down in the same fashion. This film is definitely divisive, and how you feel about it depends on whether you can be entertained by a pretty picture and  comfortably sit through three hours on environmental activism. If that doesn't sound like your cup of tea, I’d suggest saving yourself some money and seeing "Puss in Boots: The Last Wish," which is the better picture out right now.

Dear Ceci,
How did you do it? 
I was always so envious of the snaps you sent me your freshman year; it made me so excited for us to go to college together. We were gonna be absolute menaces in Pittsburgh, like high school all over again. But I guess college isn't supposed to be like high school. Maybe it was better that you didn't stay.
It feels like I'm wasting my time here, to be completely honest. I can never live up to the bar you set, and if I can't do that, I might as well not go to college. When I asked you how I should spend my time, you said "make the most of it." But what does that mean? My brain interprets that as "optimize your life," which means I spend lots of time worrying about the optimal way to live. I can spend a whole hour just staring at my planner going through every possible iteration of my afternoon. I can't simply start my homework, because there's a correct order to do my assignments, with the right group of people in the right spot in the library. Otherwise I'm not making the most of it. But of course, nothing is ever optimized because optimal means perfect. How did you make it work? 
And no, don't tell me to rush a frat. I think you make more sense as a sorority girl than I do as a frat guy. Arthur took me to some Phi Delt rush events, but you will simply not catch me at a frat again. 
I also worry about making the wrong choices here. Because for every decision, there must be one choice which is, objectively, more correct than the other. I don't think I've told you about Sammy yet, have I? Remember how I went with Arthur to a couple swim team parties during O-week? It was fun, because honestly if it weren't for Arthur inviting me along, I would have probably stayed in my room all week. But there was this one girl there, Sammy, who was really into me. And so obviously I was excited, because this is what's supposed to happen in college, right? I was completely out of my depth at those parties, though, since it was only like my third time ever drinking. She was going shot for shot with me, but it only took me around four to get completely wasted. She was a crazy heavyweight. Must be that swimmer's metabolism. So when she suggested we go back to her place, how was I gonna say no? I told Arthur about it like a month after the fact, and then he told me a bunch of very troubling things about Sammy. I don't know, I honestly try not to think about it too much. 
There's a girl in M&I, Toni, who I'm egregiously down bad for. She's from Seattle I think — which I learned during the single conversation we had at Course Center. I'm trying really hard not to let my imagination get the best of me, but damn if she didn't lean in pretty close to see the solutions I had written on my iPad. Maybe I'll have a couple more conversations with her, and then I'll ask her out. I know I say that all the time, but I'll actually follow through this time.
Did you ever study in Sorrels your freshman year? How come you never told me about this place? It's magical. You know how casinos don't have windows and clocks so you can't tell the passage of time? I think Mr. Sorrels had the same idea. You blink and all of sudden you've been studying for five hours. I study better when I'm surrounded by the familiar faces of all the people who also like studying at the high tables. Maybe I should introduce myself to them.
You ever notice how strongly your brain associates people with places? I've never spoken to my Sorrels friends, but when I see them elsewhere they look so out of place. There's this one girl, she has really cool outfits every time I see her studying, and last weekend I saw her at rolls wearing an SDC hoodie. It was jarring. I think when you make a lot of memories in a building, it becomes more than a physical structure. It gives me weird déjà vu all the time. 
Remember those really trippy dreams you had during your first semester? I thought it was just a you thing, but it started happening to me too. Maybe you can use your knowledge of symbols and astrology to piece this one together for me. I'm deep in the Doherty basements, sifting through the original blueprints and floor plans for all the buildings on campus. All of a sudden I come across a manila folder filled with handwritten letters, and I realize they're almost exact copies of my letters to you — except they're dated from 100 years ago. It's as if somebody else named Andy went through the same experiences as me a century ago. But I always get so eager to read into this person's future that I forget to handle the paper delicately, and the letters crumble in my hand. Then I realize I'm alone in the building, and I have no idea how to get out. I look back at the floorplans from earlier to see if they can help, but they're gone. In their place, I find pages filled with hundreds and hundreds of black and white photos of CMU students, organized like a yearbook. Next to each photo is their name, graduating class, and the manner of their death. Then I see my own picture, and then I wake up. 
Pretty weird, huh?
I'm excited to be back for Thanksgiving. I should host something that weekend, because we gotta get the group together again. I want to see Shaun and Rafi and Lily again. I know our group chat has been pretty dead the last month, but I still miss them. 
I have a whole lot more to say, but we'll catch up soon enough. 
From, 
Andy

“We just feel he’s going through the motions,” said NSA operative Hugh Martin, describing middle school geography sub and local domestic terrorist, Paul Gulman. 
A native of Take Your Time, Indiana, Paul has been a semi-active violent agitator for the last 10 years. Initially, his persistent Google searches of knives, automatic weapons, and explosive precursors tipped him off immediately to both the local and federal authorities. But, as time went by, it became clear that Paul was not the threat he seemed to be. 
“You have to understand, we get hundreds of thousands of search history alerts an hour,” NSA Super-Detective and Office Pong Silver Medalist, Bella Valdez reported. “Ninety percent of the time it’s just teenagers who want to blow something up in the woods, and for that, we applaud their youthful exuberance. Nine percent of the time it’s something serious, and we actually conduct an investigation. And that last percent? That’s where Paul is.” 
Gulman is what experts call a “domestic exhibitionist.” Due to his unsatisfying life as an educator, he naturally began to develop anti-social tendencies. “If he’d actually blown something up, believe me we’d get it,” Valdez stated, effortlessly bouncing a ping pong ball off a temp’s forehead into a center cup. “But he hasn’t. Instead he almost appears to be baiting the operatives assigned to him.”
While all domestic terrorist have to make simple search queries on Google, the Dark Web, or Bing’s “After Hours,” Paul’s are almost always preceded by searches that appear to invite investigation. “how much fertilizer can order before cops show up,” “how much PVC to buy if not making marshmallow shooter,” “which guns make sense to buy in indiana,” “illinois?” “alabama but with teacher budget?”
In one egregious example, Gulman downloaded the blueprints of 10 underserved local high schools, put on a trench coat, and waited outside his home, scanning the horizon for law enforcement vehicles. None came, but the FBI agent staking-out his home exited her car, place her hand on his shoulder, and told him, “You’re trying too hard, dude.” The death threats he sent black politicians that week were found to have tear stains.

A suite of proposals from the Mayor’s office are aimed at targeting complaints raised by renters in Pittsburgh, including our own Edboard on A4. But some of Mayor Gainey’s ideas have left housing activists flummoxed, to say the least. To resolve the frequently brought up issue of rocketing rent prices, Mayor Gainey suggested that college students “Grandpa Joe it.” When asked to explain this proposal at a press conference, press secretary Maria Montaño elaborated: 
“In 'Charlie and the Chocolate Factory,' Charlie’s Grandpa Joe, as well as three other of his good-for-nothing grandparents, essentially reside together in a bed, foot to foot, shoulder to shoulder. If our college transplants stopped buying La Prima coffee every day, and started ‘Grandpa Joe-ing it’ in a cheap 1.8k per month situation, they’d even have money left over!” She then showed a crude drawing of Mr. Gainey's purportedly showing the described living situation. 
Another common grievance is that of the maximum renters. Due to a stringent definition of family, and some apocryphal anti-sorority/brothel legislation, the legal maximum of non-family renters in a domicile is set at a pitiful three. Mr. Gainey proposed an addendum to the Pittsburgh Zoning Code article nine, chapter 926, § 76(b). The “Proposal On Which Enterprising Radical People’s Ultimately Found Families Get In Real Long-term Situations” suggests that the college student workers of tomorrow should “stop working so hard, start going out more, meet some nice ladies or gentlemen, and ‘get some.’” Having done so, their newly created familial status will allow them to live together, and even let their third through fifth wheel friends tag along on their newly relational bicycle.
These ideas may prove to have legs, but real Pittsburghers are concerned. Mary O'Malley, a Shadyside resident and mother of two beautiful puppies, worries that these new ideas will permit the spread of loud, unruly, disgusting college students into her neighborhood. And she is not alone. When polled, over 70 percent of homeowners believe that letting college students live in Pittsburgh will lower their property values, salt their crops, and raise the price of eggs. 
So Mayor Gainey, tread carefully!

Construction is set to begin in June on the long-awaited Pittsburgh Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) project. Early versions of this project have been in the works since 2017. In 2020, Allegheny County Port Authority secured $100 million of federal funds to begin construction, and the project has since undergone numerous revisions in scope and budget.
In its current iteration, the BRT plan proposes a two-fold change to the 61, 71 and P3 lines (along with minor changes to other lines). The first and primary change is the construction of a BRT corridor along Forbes and Fifth avenues to better connect Oakland to Downtown. This plan will involve the construction of bus-only lanes, improved bus shelters, and improved bike infrastructure to increase mobility and decrease bus clustering along Forbes and Fifth avenue. The second element will involve a major re-routing of four bus routes that currently run through Oakland.
According to the proposed changes, the 61D, 71A, 71C and 71D lines will no longer run downtown. They will continue to service east-end neighborhoods, like Highland Park (71A), Wilkinsburg (71D and 71C), and East Liberty; however, they will no longer connect these neighborhoods to Downtown. These inbound routes of these four lines will instead turn around at Craft avenue (by Carlow University), which is where the proposed BRT corridor will begin. Passengers on these lines wishing to continue to Downtown will have to get off at Craft avenue and take one of the lines running along the BRT corridor (the 61A, 61B, 61D, 71B, or P3 lines). 
Additionally, the outbound P3 line will terminate at Wilkinsburg, and no longer service the more distant neighborhoods of Hamnett, Rosslyn, or Swissvale. However, the inbound P3 will continue into Downtown along the BRT corridor, as opposed to terminating in Oakland as it currently does. 
This has raised concerns, as it would require those traveling Downtown from these east-end neighborhoods to pay a second fare to board a BRT bus. 
In accordance with Title VI, PRT conducted an analysis of how these proposed changes would impact low-income and minority communities in Pittsburgh. Their report concludes that the changes to all four of these lines "might have a disproportionate burden on the low-income population" in the areas they service. The report has mixed conclusions about the P3 changes, claiming that it would negatively impact the neighborhoods cut off, but would have a positive impact by connecting the P3 to downtown.
However, the neighborhoods that will be cut off by the shortened routes are already underserved by Pittsburgh transportation infrastructure. Furthermore, the increased demand for parking at the Wilkinsburg station will take up additional real estate in the neighborhood, and further complicate the commutes of residents living in the east-end of Pittsburgh. 
Rationales for the change include reducing the number of bus lines that run through Downtown, addressing the bus driver shortage (by allowing the altered lines to run their routes more frequently), and decreasing the travel time between Oakland and Downtown to accommodate the high population of college students in Oakland.
Public hearings for these changes were held on January 18th, but PRT is accepting public comments via letters or an online forum until February 1st.

It’s been two years since the January 6 Attack on the Capitol and the courts system is still hearing cases against rioters. Most recently, the results of the second major sedition trial against members of “the far-right Oath Keepers” were determined, with four more members found guilty of “seditious conspiracy” and charged for conspiracy and obstructing Congress from certifying the election. 
Sarah Lynch of Reuters explained that such charges are “rarely prosecuted” and represent a law from the Civil War era “that prohibits plotting to overthrow the government and carries up to 20 years in prison” as the punishment. In fact, Michael Balsamo of AP News notes that the last successful seditious conspiracy conviction was in the 1954 storming of the Capitol, nearly 70 years ago. 
These charges are huge wins for the Department of Justice (DOJ), with Rachel Weiner of The Washington Post explaining that only 20 of the people “charged with committing crimes at the Capitol on Jan 6” were charged with seditious conspiracy, identified as “not just participants in a violent mob but also leaders using brutality to further a political plot.” However, the DOJ added that 50 defendants received charges of conspiracy, either for “conspiracy to obstruct a congressional proceeding, conspiracy to obstruct law enforcement during civil disorder, conspiracy to injure an officer, seditious conspiracy, or some combination of the four.”
Michael Balsamo of AP News explained that the sedition charges are based on the allegations that Oath Keepers planned the insurrection weeks in advance, including discussions on how to overturn the election, weapons purchases, and “battle plans.” He furthered that such battle-like strategies were allegedly seen in the January 6 riots, with two groups of Oath Keepers in “stack formation” simultaneously confronting security officers and going after the House and Senate. 
Thus far, Lynch explained, there’s been one other major sedition case with five defendants. There, Oath Keepers founder Stewart Rhodes and another Florida-based leader were the only found guilty of seditious conspiracy, but “all five defendants were found guilty of obstructing Congress from certifying the election.” The DOJ added that an additional four of the sedition charges ended in the defendants pleading guilty. Alanna Richer noted that this sought to get a lighter sentence because they were working with the prosecution.  
Another sedition trial is ongoing, this one with five members of the right-wing militant group the Proud Boys. 
Sedition charges are not the only ones being brought against participants in the January 6 riots. Despite the fact that most rioters were not identified the day of the attack, Madison Hall of the Insider explained that with the help of the general public, the FBI has arrested and charged 978 people with crimes pertaining to January 6. However, they added, “only 475 federally charged rioters have entered guilty pleas so far,” and the DOJ’s task of investigating these crimes is still ongoing. 
The breakdown of these crimes depends on the nature of the defendant's involvement in the January 6th riots. The DOJ explains that the range of charges against the more than 284 defendants includes “assaulting, resisting, or impeding officers or employees” with 99 of them additionally charged with “using a deadly or dangerous weapon or causing serious bodily injury to an officer” — statistics that make sense considering there were around 140 officers that were assaulted on January 6th. Another 11 individuals were charged with assault or property damage pertaining to the media, 59 defendants have been charged with destruction of government property, and 36 were charged with theft of government property.
More generally, the DOJ furthers that 860 defendants were charged with “entering or remaining in a restricted federal building or grounds” with 91 of them entering such a restricted area “with a dangerous or deadly weapon.” 295 defendants also have charges of “corruptly obstructing, influencing, or impeding an official proceeding or attempting to do so.” 
Overall, the events of January 6th, 2021 represent a complicated legal situation with many defendants receiving multiple charges, and as such, cases will continue to be determined for some time.

Pittsburgh Public Schools believe social media marketing that targets children has hurt student mental health. They plan to file a lawsuit in federal court against social media platforms, accusing them of contributing to learning loss and increased misbehavior.
The Pittsburgh school board approved retaining law firms for the case against Facebook, Instagram, Snapchat, and TikTok in a 7-0 vote. They will be represented by Levin Sedran & Berman of Philadelphia and Robert Peirce & Associates of Pittsburgh, with one of the firms covering the upfront expenses of the case according to Pittsburgh Public Schools solicitor Ira Weiss.
This lawsuit follows others in the country such as the Seattle school district, which filed a complaint against social media websites for increasing mental and behavioral issues. Their complaint states that between 2009 and 2019 there was on average a 30 percent increase in the number of students “so sad or hopeless almost every day for two weeks or more in a row that [they] stopped doing some usual activities.”
The Pittsburgh lawsuit would look to recover increased costs from various mental health services, learning loss, and counseling. The case has been likened to vaping lawsuits which have been similarly criticized for targeting children. Both have been associated with negative impacts on brain development, and Weiss believes there is a similar theory with vaping lawsuits.
The district’s case will likely be heard alongside the other districts around the country filing similar lawsuits. According to CBS News Pittsburgh, as of Jan. 27 Pittsburgh Public Schools plans to file the suit within 60 days.

Just over a year ago the Fern Hollow Bridge collapsed, falling 100 feet into a ravine and taking five vehicles and one Pittsburgh Regional Transit bus with it. Nine people sustained non-life-threatening injuries, but the incident increased calls to improve Pittsburgh’s bridges, including by President Biden, who was in town to promote an infrastructure bill the day of the collapse.
The bridge has been rebuilt and is on its way to being fully functional again. Michelle Wright of WTAE reported that in late December of 2022, “the newly built bridge reopened to traffic with one lane open in each direction,” with plans to work through the spring to reopen all four lanes and “restore trail access under the bridge.” 
This reopening comes after an ambitious plan to get the bridge back in use. Anya Sostek of the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette wrote that the rebuilding strategy was “special,” and “made possible by state and local emergency declarations” enabling a project that usually takes five years to be reopened in only 11 months. The project was covered by the federal government, offsetting a $23 million cost. This funding came from the bill Biden promoted the day of the collapse, and he even returned to track the progress of the bridge earlier in October. 
However, progress on the Fern Hollow bridge has not translated to progress with the rest of Pittsburgh’s deteriorating infrastructure, especially other at-risk bridges. Mike Wereschagin of the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette observed that after the Fern Hollow Bridge collapse, Pittsburgh Mayor Ed Gainey commissioned a report on the remaining Pittsburgh bridges, which found that there are 32 other city-owned bridges “rated in poor condition.” Problematically, he notes, none of these 32 bridges are scheduled to be rehabilitated in 2023 “under a key government program,” and only 11 of these bridges “are scheduled to be rehabilitated or replaced in the next five years under the Transportation Improvement Program.” 
Wereschagin said that the problem is funding. Competing for limited funding makes it hard for all in-need programs to be added to the five-year plan. According to Wereschagin, “Inspectors downgraded the Fern Hollow Bridge’s condition to poor in 2011, [and] officials put it on a waitlist for public dollars that never arrived." Sometimes the city prioritizes projects in better condition to prevent them from deteriorating. In some cases, Wereschagin concluded, worse-off bridges will collapse before the funding gets to them.
When bridges collapse, sometimes the reason isn’t initially clear. 
In the case of Fern Hollow, research into what caused the to bridge collapse is ongoing. AP News reported that engineers of the Fern Hollow bridge are “examining ‘multiple fractures’ found on the bridge’s legs.” Such analysis includes 3D scans of all four legs, as well as “mechanical and metallurgical tests” that will be compared to the bridge’s original design plan. This update comes after an initial review in February that did not find a cause but identified that the collapse started in the west end of the bridge. Additional information on the cause of the collapse should be released as data analysis concludes.

On Jan. 24, Hindenburg Research released a report titled “Adani Group: How the World’s 3rd Richest Man is Pulling the Largest Con in Corporate History.” This report details the findings of a two-year investigation and claims the group engaged in stock manipulation and accounting fraud schemes over the course of decades. 
Gautam Adani, who was worth roughly $120 billion when the report was released, is the founder and chairman of Adani Group. Over the past three years, he has gained over $100 billion through the group’s seven key listed companies. Eight of the 22 key leaders are Adani family members. 
The report also alleges the mass use of shell entities based in tax havens, including 38 in Mauritius and others in Cyprus, the United Arab Emirates, Singapore, and several Caribbean Islands. The report ends with 88 questions to Adani to “give the company a chance to be transparent.”
Of the 88 questions the Hindenburg report raised, Adani says that 65 of them were related to matters that have been disclosed by Adani portfolio companies in annual reports, while the rest relate to public shareholders and third parties, and some were “baseless allegations based on imaginary fact patterns.”
In the week since Hindenburg Research released their report, the Adani Group has lost about $50 billion in value, while Gautam Adani has lost over $20 billion in value; Forbes estimates his worth (as of writing) to now be $96.7 billion, placing him as the seventh-richest person in the world. 
The Indian stock market slipped on Wednesday, the day after Hindenburg Research released the report. The markets were closed on Thursday in respect of Republic Day. On Friday, some of the companies dropped 20 percent in value, the maximum allowed by exchanges, before trading stopped. Overall, India’s benchmark stock index fell 1.6 percent, the worst drop for the market in more than a month.
Hindenburg Research is a New York-based investment firm that made a name for itself by betting against cryptocurrency companies and unprofitable electric vehicle makers. The report discloses that the group hold short positions in Adani Group Companies through U.S.-traded bonds and non-Indian traded derivatives, meaning they are betting that there will be a short-term drop in the price of these equities.
This isn’t the first time the group has been accused of fraud. Four major government fraud investigations have alleged money laundering, theft of taxpayer funds, and corruption, which total $17 billion. A number of relatives of Adani have been accused of other fraud schemes and were later promoted to director-level positions.
In response to Hindenburg Research’s report, Adani released a 413-page response on Sunday that says the Hindenburg Research report was driven by “an ulterior motive,” that it was a “calculated attack,” and claims the allegations are false. On Thursday, Adani said that it is considering taking action against Hindenburg. Hindenburg, however, responded that they would “welcome it” and that “If Adani is serious, it should also file suit in the U.S. where we [Hindenburg] operate. We have a long list of documents we would demand in a legal discovery process.”

On Jan. 7 at a traffic stop near his mother’s home, Tyre Nichols, a 29-year-old Black man, was brutally beaten by five Memphis police officers. He died three days later due to severe injuries sustained during the beating. 
Police knocked at the door of RowVaughn Wells, Nichols’ mother, at around 8 or 9 p.m. to tell her about Nichols’ arrest. They reported that her son was arrested for a DUI, pepper sprayed, and tased. They told her that Nichols would be going to the hospital and later the police station. Wells reports the officers asking if he was “on any type of drugs” because it was “so difficult to put the handcuffs on him.” According to Wells, she believes they were trying to cover up the beating when they first came to her.
Following the release of footage from the fatal beating on Jan. 28, hundreds of peaceful demonstrators in Memphis demanded justice, accountability and police reform. In the footage, about an hour long, the officers are seen holding Nichols down. They took turns beating him and taunting him as he screamed for his mother, only two minutes away from where he was held. At one point, Nichols managed to get free and ran. He was tased by one officer and the beating continued until he lost conscious. The officers propped his limp body over a police car and exchanged fist-bumps.
After the footage was released, protests erupted around the country. On Saturday, a rally was held in Pittsburgh’s East Liberty neighborhood, with protestors speaking out against Nichols’ killing and the widespread issue of police brutality. 
Cerelyn “CJ” Davis, Memphis chief of police and an advocate for police reform, quickly addressed the growing outrage. The five officers belonged to a unit known as the SCORPION unit, which stands for Street Crimes Operation to Restore Peace in Our Neighborhoods. Formerly responsible for patrolling “high crime hotspots,” the unit has been “permanently” disbanded according to the Memphis Police Department. The five police officers identified in the conflict were fired.
On Jan. 26, they were indicted on charges of second-degree murder, aggravated assault–acting in concert, two counts of aggravated kidnapping, two counts of official misconduct, and one count of official oppression. 
The response of the city and police department has been noted as unique for the fast investigation, dismissal, and indictment of the police officers. State investigators were called in hours after the beating and the indictment came three weeks after Nichols’ death. This has been compared to incidents of police brutality in former years — in 2014, it took Chicago police 13 months and a court order to release video footage of police firing on Laquan McDonald. The footage of Nichols’ death was released three weeks after the beating.
Some believe this reflects a national shift in attitudes towards the police and police brutality. Across the country, many cities have begun reconsidering the use of force demonstrated by their police officers and the standard of accountability upheld by the department. The national conversation around police brutality has also begun to recognize that Black and Latino populations are disproportionately targets of police force. In the case of Tyre Nichols, all five police officers being Black have created new questions about the nature of police brutality.

As of Jan. 29, there have been a total of 49 mass shootings in the US — nearly 1.7 per day. This increased from the 31 mass shootings that had occurred by this time in 2022. The longest stretch of time the U.S. has gone without a mass shooting this year is three days, twice: Jan. 10 through Jan. 12 and Jan. 18 through Jan. 20. 
This year, the first mass shooting occurred in Allentown, Pa. when four people were shot at a recreation center late on New Year’s Day. Since Jan. 16, California has been home to six mass shootings that have left at least 21 injured and 30 dead.
Why have so many mass shootings been happening this year? According to some experts, it’s a case of “mass shooting contagion.” According to James Alan Fox, a professor of criminology at Northwestern University, “Contagion' is a statistical process. It's when the likelihood of a similar crime of another mass shooting increases in the aftermath of another mass shooting.” He also pointed to a 2015 study from researchers at Arizona State University that supported the idea of mass shooting contagion. They found that every mass shooting tends to increase the likelihood of another mass shooting for about 13 days.
Last year, mass shooting contagion was seen following the mass shooting of 10 Black people at a Buffalo supermarket. Ten days later was the Robb Elementary School shooting in Uvalde, Texas. 
It should be noted that, though mass shootings gain the most attention on news sites and social media, they make up less than one percent of annual homicides. 
Though California has stricter gun laws than most states — boasting more than 100 gun laws — it still has mass shootings. Why is that? 
First, it is important to note that it seems like their gun control laws have worked, as they have the lowest rate of gun death in America. But like all states, California has to contend with the gun trade from other states, especially “ghost” guns. “Ghost” guns are those that are bought online and assembled at home — they are unserialized and untraceable. 
Additionally, California law prohibits people who are deemed to be a danger to others or themselves from owning guns. However, those who haven’t been officially flagged by the courts or law enforcement can still own guns. Also, if a gun was legal for someone to own when bought but is now illegal, it doesn’t have to be given up. The gun that was used in the Monterey Park shooting on Jan. 21 was illegal for a number of reasons, but the high-capacity magazine may have been legal, depending on when the attacker bought it. 
So with 29 days down and 49 mass shootings already under America’s belt, should we expect there to be over 600 mass shootings this year? At the current rate, it’s an unfortunate yes.

The Underground’s attempt at cuisine Americana is admirable. And though it’s nobody’s ideal Friday night dine and far from the best on-campus eatery, The Underground stands as the choice place for many students on the north side of Carnegie Mellon. I’ll lay it on the line that, carrying its flaws and character proudly, The Underground receives unwarranted contempt and has rightfully earned its defenders with its steadfast status of readiness.
The Underground, or U.G. as it has been termed through Carnegie Mellon’s patois, is reliably open, a trait which isn’t common among Carnegie Mellon’s dining options. Interestingly, it seems this trademark of the establishment has perhaps spoiled us to take it for granted, by being so accessible during late hours that students have declared it a pis-aller, in case no other dining option is available. That, however, is an unfair assessment of the restaurant as its food choices are not the worst that the campus offers — quite the contrary, actually.
The U.G.’s fries, for instance, are better than Tepper’s E.A.T.'s, Back Bar’s, and Tahini’s, and it is not entirely because of weak competition. Unlike Back Bar Grill, which terribly salt-and-peppers their store-bought bag fries, the U.G. at least serves them decently. Even if fries are out of the question, U.G. has many sides ranging from fruit cups to baked goods. They even advertise themselves as having the most variety on their side menu, an area in which other on-campus eateries are lacking. Back Bar, in contrast, has either mediocre fries or equally mediocre chips. A piece of fruit is an option, but it’s tucked away in the corner. The Exchange has every flavor of chip known to man, but only three fruits. The worst that one could say about the menu is that they do not trust the U.G. fish. There, I do not blame them. It doesn't taste terrible; I haven’t seen any student roll over sick due to it, but since there isn’t an ocean within five hours in any direction from Pittsburgh, I too hesitate to call it freshly caught.
The U.G. staff are also great. No matter what, it seems like the U.G. is well-staffed and never dysfunctionally overwhelmed by orders, even when at full capacity of customers. Other restaurants around Carnegie Mellon are commonly felt to be understaffed, giving them insufferable wait times. This is not a condemnation of the workers at those other restaurants; I can name a handful of food workers that actively attempt to give students the best experience possible, like those at Hunan, or the four gentlemen working the sandwiches at The Exchange. Service workers have difficult jobs, which is why I feel the need to write this review as a grateful gesture to all of our university’s chefs feeding us. Still, we should be able to point out the flaws we experience at the establishment, as a means of bettering the dining services that we fund as part of our student expenses.
The Underground also provides occasional jazz nights or other events. During finals week, it even kept open further into the night, and gave free coffee to students who went there to study. Possibly due to its status as a Carnegie Mellon staple (24 years and counting), The Underground has a connection to Carnegie Mellon and its students that no other dining location can replace. Generations of classes prior have sat at the same spots we have, laughing and talking and crying over classes in the same ways we do. Our experiences will live in those walls as long as it exists, and will continue to exist long after us.
Looking at both the concept art and previous versions of The Underground, it seems that it used to be a place that frequently gave chances for would-be famous singers and bands the chance to show off their talent. It seems that it was supposed to turn out like an old-school diner, like something that could be found in Anytown, USA. It isn’t anything like what it looks like now, and it’s up to the individual to decide whether or not it used to be better than what it is now.

We here at The Tartan Edboard staff agree with the statement from Bobby Lincoln, the Chair of State and Local Affairs of the GSA, regarding Mayor Gainey's comprehensive zoning review. This is the first comprehensive review of Pittsburgh zoning since 1999, meaning this is a critical moment to push for a housing plan that prioritizes multi-family developments near Pittsburgh's universities.
Pittsburgh's college-student population isn't going anywhere, and although Mayor Gainey's administration may wish to attract families that build roots in their communities, we nonetheless need a housing plan that addresses the need for student housing.
When students lack the option to buy housing close to campus, they are driven to rent single-family homes in adjacent neighborhoods. This not only increases the price of homes in the city, but increases the number of people taking the bus and driving cars, overloading the already-packed 61 and 71 lines. If instead the city focuses on densifying Oakland and other areas adjacent to campus, there will be a greater number of students within walking and biking distance from campus. Furthermore, foot traffic is better for local businesses, and reduces the number of cars on the road. Oakland can serve as a model for how a neighborhood can densify, improve the pedestrian experience, and flexibly support a highly transient student population. 
Removing barriers for multi-unit developments can also permit a more uniform densification of neighborhoods. For example, large portions of Shadyside and North Oakland are zoned as "very low" or "moderate" density residential — so when a developer gets approval to build high-density housing, they are incentivized to generate the most revenue on the smallest possible plot. This is how you get developments like One on Centre, a mid-rise apartment building located immediately next to low-density detached homes. This lack of medium-density housing is part of a larger phenomenon called the "missing middle", and is a pattern in many American cities. 
Furthermore, Carnegie Mellon's international students may benefit from living in large, corporately-run multi-unit properties. These businesses have better communication infrastructure for tenants, who otherwise might find it more difficult to seek redress with an individual landlord. 
Much of South Oakland is seeing the consequences of what happens when a neighborhood of predominantly single-family homes is occupied by students. These homes are often illegally rented by students who don't know their rights, and owned by landlords who have no interest in investing money in upkeep. The result is dangerous, crumbling homes that go years without inspection (and even when they are hit with violations, there are often too few regulations to enforce building codes). 
Recently, Majora Carter delivered Carnegie Mellon's Martin Luther King, Jr. Keynote where she emphasized how development can be positive for a community. Density and development is not necessarily gentrification, and in fact it can have the opposite effect — development can, when done right, lower rent costs in a city. Take how Minneapolis abolished exclusive single-family zoning to incentivize the development of multi-family housing units. As a result, Minneapolis has some of the highest rates of home ownership for low-income families. 
Because houses are in such high demand, a lot of single-family homes (particularly those on Beeler) are passed down from one group to another — often associated with a particular club or organization. There is a clear demand for off-campus student housing. Furthermore, thanks to a slew of economic and supply-chain issues and the increased use of rent-pricing software, housing prices are soaring across the country. 
It is imperative that Pittsburgh adopt a pro-housing policy in this upcoming comprehensive review, as we need affordable housing for both students and families. It would be better for these campus-adjacent neighborhoods, and better for the city as a whole, if Pittsburgh's student population had access to more housing nearer their university.

While it was nice to visit my old Boy Scout troop this break, it was hard to ignore how much the troop had diminished since I aged out. I soon learned that I'm not alone in this observation; this is a trend nationwide. Since 2019, BSA membership has plummeted by 62 percent. The pandemic, plus the financial troubles and publicity of rampant, institutionally-protected sexual abuse can explain this drop. But I also think that perhaps American culture has irrevocably shifted past the need for BSA in its current form.
As an Eagle Scout (with a silver palm, I'll have you know), my experience with BSA was very positive. I don't want this to come off as a vicious takedown of the institution, because I think two things can be true at once. Scouting can simultaneously have values rooted in an outdated worldview, as well as be full of very enthusiastic people who want to have a positive impact on young people in their community.
Scouting was founded by Lord Robert Baden-Powell, a British General and war hero from the Second Boer War and a weird guy who was obsessed with stopping masturbation. His ethos on scouting was to teach a generation of young men growing up in newly industrialized cities of Great Britain the value of rugged outdoorsmanship. He saw the youth falling victim to the vices of modern society, and felt the need for an institution that would emphasize a return to traditions and practices that might otherwise be lost. At its core, this is a conservative mentality, although I don't entirely disagree with it. There is value in outdoorsy skills, and I don't think it's inherently bad to criticize how modern society has isolated us from nature.
But these roots of scouting give it a very particular brand of conservative ideology. When transported to America, the image of the noble British imperial scout was replaced by our own mythology of the rugged pioneer. This merged with Norman-Rockwell-style imagery of the idyllic white Christian suburban boyhood, dashes of 20th century military veneration, and just a hint of Native American cultural appropriation to make the unique cultural stew in which BSA thrived for decades. 
Now I want to make a brief tangent (that isn't really a tangent) to talk about the Order of the Arrow (or OA), the self-described BSA "honor society." To be inducted, one must be elected by their troop to attend an OA-sponsored camping trip called an "Ordeal." I was given explicit instructions not to talk about what occurred during my Ordeal. But that is a weird and silly rule, so I'm going to tell you what happened.
I, along with a few dozen other scouts from other local troops, camped under the stars for a night. The following day, we were made to do various camp improvement projects while receiving very little food and maintaining a "vow of silence." After our hard day's work, we were taken into the woods and lined up, while a white man from Westchester, New York wearing a feather headdress told us a Native American legend about the value of resilience and quiet service. They then went down the line and whispered a word into our ear, which supposedly, when translated from the Native language from which it originates, means "to love one another." Having successfully completed our Ordeal, we got to have a big dinner and sleep in a heated cabin. 
I don't have a super strong conclusion to that story, other than I think it's weird to take a bunch of young men through a pseudo-indigenous ceremony (that we, I really want to emphasize, are explicitly told not to discuss) in order to join a secret boys-only club. It's so incredibly bizarre that people often express genuine concern for me when I tell them about it. It definitely was weird, but I think it strikes people as especially weird when they aren't familiar with the cultural milieu that flavors BSA. 
It's also hard to ignore the odd, jingoistic militarism and patriotism woven into the DNA of scouting. It seems pretty strange in this day and age to make children swear an oath to do one's duty to "God and country," and to keep oneself "morally straight." The focus on religion is something that always struck me as very strange about scouting. At every Eagle Court of Honor (the ceremony where scouts are formally awarded the rank of Eagle), there was a particular script the scoutmaster always followed. His speech always included the declaration that, "Of every 100 scouts, it must be admitted that 30 will drop out their first year," followed by a list of statistics about these 100 hypothetical scouts. Some of these seem quite compelling. "At least 1 will use his Scout skills to save another person’s life, and at least one other will credit it with saving his own life." But it also includes the line, "12 of the 100 will be from families that belong to no Church. Through Scouting, these 12 and many of their families will be brought into contact with a Church, and as a result some will continue to be active all their lives." In research for this piece, I discovered a number of troops with their own versions of this speech (I used this one from Troop 111 in Arlington Virginia), all of which differ very slightly in their statistics and none of which cite any sort of survey. So these stats are probably not true. But every one of them makes this claim about religion, as if agnosticism is something people must be cured of. 
For an organization with its roots in white, heterosexual, male, Christian patriotism, it's no surprise the Mormon church makes up a huge part of scouting. In 2018, 18.5 percent of Boy Scouts were from the Mormon church. They severed ties with BSA in 2019 over vague moral disagreements. According to a spokesperson for BSA, the decision stemmed from the desire of the Mormon church to establish a youth organization more focused on preparing young men for their religious missions. But it's not hard to guess what other reasons they might have. In 2015, the Church stated that they were "deeply troubled" by BSA's decision to lift the ban on openly gay adult scout leaders, and in 2018, BSA went co-ed. It's not hard to imagine that an organization which claims that "While same-sex attraction is not a sin, it can be a challenge," might not like the marginally progressive direction in which BSA is moving.
There will certainly be a place for youth organizations that go on camping trips, religious organizations that focus on community service, and pseudo-military organizations for kids who want (or whose parents want) order and discipline. But it's probably not necessary that those all be the same institution, and especially one with such a bizarre heritage of white, male, Christian patriotism. Just because Scouting had a positive impact on me, I don't feel the need to defend its continued existence. Every generation is free to evaluate the institutions and cultural artifacts it gets to inherit, and if my generation is the one that kills scouting I won't opine the loss.

Hey Goodreads, 2010 called — they want their interface back. 
Seriously, I don’t think very many changes have been made to Goodreads since I started using it a decade ago. Up until recently, I would use Goodreads to log everything about the books I was reading. After all, it’s the best option since so many people use it, right?
At first sight, Goodreads seems to offer everything that an avid reader may want: a way to organize what books you have read and want to read, a review system, and recommendations. But each of these things have some sort of flaw to them. The shelf system combines all your books that you’ve ever read and you can’t filter it. For me, this means a “Warriors” book sits next to “Flowers for Algernon.” Don’t get me wrong, both are good books, but my reading taste has changed drastically but there’s no way to filter what I want to see on my “Read” shelf.
The review system also badly needa some updates. On Goodreads, you can only do the standard one to five stars and nothing else. While I may feel a book was a solid 3.5 stars, I’m forced to choose between three or four stars. While my rating is just a drop in the bucket, I would still feel better if there was a better review system.
Don’t even get me started on Goodreads’ recommendation system. I don’t think I’ve ever wanted to read a single recommendation I was given. Half the time, it’s a book with 503 ratings but is “trending this week,” or it’s the world’s most popular book. I’ve never felt like the recommendations were tailored to me, which makes them utterly useless.
I wasn’t really aware of any alternatives to Goodreads until recently, when I saw some people posting online their year-end summary from something called “The Storygraph,” so I decided to check it out. I must say, though, that it wasn’t hard to convince me to try an alternative to Goodreads. 
When making an account on The Storygraph, it gives you the option to import your data from Goodreads, which was an immediate green flag. To me, this meant that The Storygraph clearly knows its audience — people wanting to switch to a more modern book-tracking system. 
I was also pleasantly surprised by the robust information that the books are labeled with on The Storygraph. Depending on user input, each book has a set of tags that you can easily filter, both on an overall preferences or specific preferences level. This means I can get recommendations that fit my general reading preferences or a specific genre I’m looking for. I can also rate books up to a quarter of a star, which I find to be a big plus. This is a vast improvement over Goodreads’ recommendation system. 
This tag system also lends itself nicely to a robust statistics page. You can view your reading statistics for a year at a time or for all-time, which I am a huge fan of. This stats page does a great job of breaking down what kind of books you tend to read, and it’s interesting to see how your reading habits have changed over the years. The all-time page also does an analysis of your "to read" shelf and shows some extra statistics, like year published. 
But all this isn’t to say The Storygraph is a perfect replacement for Goodreads. You can’t easily view what books you have read on The Storygraph, which I find a little annoying. Also, since The Storygraph isn’t as established as Goodreads, there aren’t as many reviews and resources (like author profiles or quotes). I don’t view this as a huge deal, but I expect as more people grow frustrated with Goodreads, more people will migrate to The Storygraph. 
While Goodreads certainly satisfies what it set out to do, don’t settle for something that looks like it’s stuck in 2013. While I like The Storygraph, there are also other options out there. I highly recommend taking a look for other services that aren’t Goodreads — you won’t regret it.

Novel-tea is The Tartan’s literary and language opinion column, so if you like hot takes and reading about cool ideas in the literary community, then this is the place for you!! If you have your own hot take to add to this column, do not hesitate to contact us.
This winter break, I went home with a mission to read the books I have bought but left untouched. Oddly enough, I noticed a theme to what I was reading: mothers. Now, I have a feeling you’re thinking Jen you’re nineteen, what interest could you possibly have in women ten to twenty years your senior and their current/potential children? My answer to that is power.
Within the current structure of the nuclear family, interrogating the role of the mother tells us so much about what we owe to one another and what defines power. I know to some that might seem like a stretch, but current feminist thinking encourages us to look at even the most “mundane” experiences of women in order to fully understand power. The relationship between children and parents often reflects the framework and priorities of our society.
Mieko Kawakami’s “Breasts and Eggs” explores this, and was coincidentally my favorite book I read over break. It is a story about mothers and daughters, but — more poignantly — it is about what we, as a society, ask of children and of mothers. The novel’s protagonist, Natsu, struggles with her womanhood, her relationship with motherly figures, and her desire for children but lack of desire for a partner. One of the most fascinating parts of the book is Natsu’s urge to know her child. She wants to be a mother not for the sake of having children, but because of what getting to know her child means to her. 
This brought up a series of questions about how we, as a society, look at motherhood. Any glance at Mother’s Day advertisements or baby shower memorabilia demonstrates the sheer weight we put on mothers. There is not only an appreciation for, but an expectation of sacrifice. Today, we rely on many mothers to do most of the domestic labor while also working full-time jobs. The stereotype of the exhausted, overworked mother is all too common yet few people do anything to change it. 
Through questioning what motherhood means, we are also questioning what people owe to each other. American media often portrays children as a duty or chore for parents, but questioning this changes the role of mothers. We are all someone’s child, and (ideally) we are not merely a responsibility of our parents but people in our own right. As the poet Kahlil Gibran explores in his poem “On Children,” “They [children] come through you but not from you,/ And though they are with you yet they belong not to you.” 
The idea that children are not duties to fulfill, but people to understand is a radical way of looking at families. The connection between mothers and children built through intensive labor limits how mothers and children are able to relate. It also gives us an insight into society as people view one another in terms of responsibility. People are often prioritized by what they are responsible for, instead of who they are. While this framework is effective in a capitalist society in which responsibility is the foundation, questioning that foundation can prove invaluable to improving our world.
Is that an idealist way of thinking? Yes. But, at least in my opinion, looking at the world for what we think it can be — in addition to what it truly is — helps it improve. That is why I will continue to read about mothers: because they provide a lens through which we may treat each other better.

Almost exactly a year ago, when the Fern Hollow Bridge collapsed into the ravine of Frick Park, I wrote an opinion piece for Forum called “The Gap: What the loss of a bridge really means.” I wrote that piece in what you might call a tizzy; I was feeling a lot of emotions, mostly anger. My path from school to home had just been complicated enormously, and all people around me seemed to want to talk about was how President Biden could have died in the collapse (a myth that has been debunked by the fact that his destination in Pittsburgh that day was nowhere near the bridge). Amongst other assertions, I made the prediction that the bridge would not be replaced for a long time.
As I drove over the brand new, now-opened Fern Hollow Bridge this past winter break, taking my usual curves down the long stretch of Forbes Avenue at the standard five or 10 miles per hour above the speed limit, I wondered, “Was I wrong?”
There has been a lot of chatter in Pittsburgh over the past year about the building of the new bridge. Most specifically, the transportation of a number of literally humongous (150-foot) “pre-stress” concrete and steel beams through the city caught a lot of attention. Somehow, Swank Construction, the firm responsible for the Fern Hollow Bridge, brought nearly 20 of these 100-ton beams essentially from Altoona — where their manufacturer PennStress lives — through the windy Swissvale streets to Regent Square. As a fun fact, PennStress is also responsible for a memorial at the Flight 93 crash site just east of Pittsburgh.
All of this seemed very mystical to Pittsburgh residents, who were used to the traditional steel-arch, takes-37-years-to-build bridge style that predominates our landscape. To most, it seemed that Swank and The Pennsylvania Department of Transportation (PennDOT) were doing everything in their power to have the bridge up as quickly as possible. I cannot pretend that I do not believe that. And although I have a lot of empathy for the struggles and inconveniences that the bridge closing caused for Pittsburgh residents — I myself took a number of hour-long 61B bus rides that were previously only 20 minutes — I also understand that rushing the reconstruction of the bridge would only lead to further troubles. 
Surprisingly, this is actually the Fern Hollow Bridge’s third life. The original bridge was built in 1901, then torn down in 1972 and rebuilt the year after. A construction worker was purportedly killed in the demolition of the original bridge; maybe the 2022 collapse was his work from beyond the grave.
Anyways, considering that nobody was really talking about the possibility of the Fern Hollow Bridge collapsing before it did, it’s natural for there still to be doubts about whether this latest iteration of the bridge will last. I would go as far as to hypothesize that if the collapse hadn’t, by sheer coincidence, been of national attention, there might not have been such an incredible rush, pomp, and circumstance about getting it back up. PennDOT purportedly brushed off requests for input by groups of concerned residents, like cyclists. It also seems that they delayed some finishing touches until after the official opening, like pedestrian walkways and a planned art exhibition. Also, not all of the lanes are actually open to drivers. Given all that’s happened, that might be enough to make any Pittsburgher a little suspicious. 
It was enough to make me hold my breath when I drove over for the first time, and also sort of the second time. I thought about all the things we take for granted; maybe the integrity of giant concrete beams is something I could consider adding to that list.

While many of my fellow Pittsburghers point to the recent uptick in apartment building development as a sign of housing construction gone wild, the truth is that Pittsburgh builds fewer apartments than almost any other major city in the US. Part of the reason for that is the current zoning code, which requires almost any apartment development to seek zoning variances, enters them into a subjective review process in which a small and unrepresentative handful of individuals can stop a project from happening. Because of this, the city has failed to develop adequate housing for its growing student population. Last month, Mayor Ed Gainey announced plans to update the city’s comprehensive plan — a long overdue undertaking. As the Mayor and his team update the City’s comprehensive plan, they should include zoning changes that make it easier for developers to build apartments — changes such as allowing multi-family developments by right, increasing allowable building heights and floor area ratios, and removing minimum parking requirements, among others. Doing so will enable our city to embrace its growing student population without pushing out the families that have built their lives in its neighborhoods - a critical goal of any comprehensive planning effort. 
The City of Pittsburgh is home to over 60,000 college students—a number that is likely to continue growing in the foreseeable future as the universities expand their offerings to serve more students. While these universities should certainly develop more housing for their students, the reality is that most college students desire to live off-campus in privately owned apartments and homes. Because of their inherently transient nature, large multi-family developments are often the ideal option for many of these students, as they provide a level of quality assurance and responsive management that other privately owned rental units do not. This is especially true for Pittsburgh’s large population of international students, who also face additional barriers in seeking fair treatment from landlords due to cultural and language barriers. 
Regardless of whether such housing is developed, however, these students will continue to live in our city and require housing. Today, many students live in converted single family homes, which has reduced the availability of such homes for permanent residents. The decline in available single family homes is most acutely seen in neighborhoods like Oakland, Shadyside, South Side, and Squirrel Hill, which as a result have some of the highest housing prices in the city. However, as the student population continues to grow, this trend will spread further into other neighborhoods if multi-family development continues to be stymied. More students will live in dwellings that could otherwise house families, making it more difficult for those families to establish their lives in the city – a critical issue in a city with an already insufficient supply of suitable family housing.
In the words of Mayor Gainey’s administration, the update to the comprehensive plan will “set a long term, implementable framework for shaping the future of Pittsburgh.” Given the continued growth in student population that the city is experiencing, it is absolutely critical that the new comprehensive plan makes it easier for developers to build multi-family housing in close proximity to the city’s many college campuses. If that is not done, the Mayor’s office will find it exceedingly difficult to make Pittsburgh a city where anyone can thrive.
