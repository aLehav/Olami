The Carnegie Mellon men’s basketball team took the court on Friday to host Emory University in University Athletic Association (UAA) play. The Tartans played a scrappy game, but the Eagles ultimately took the victory 83–68. This loss puts the Tartans at 9–14 overall, and 2–10 in UAA competition.
The game opened with Emory taking a swift six-point lead over the Tartans, demonstrating some impressive ball movement around the Tartan defense, and using their size advantage to make plays around the net. But Carnegie Mellon did not stay down for long. A jumper from sophomore Ryan Maha gave the Tartans some breathing room and decreased Emory’s lead, pulling the score to 20–16 at the 12-minute mark of the first half. The Eagles were having none of that, however. Over the next six minutes, the Eagles put together a 16–4 scoring run to take a 36–20 lead, increasing their lead to 28 at one point, and eventually ending the half leading 53–27.
The game began to look grim for the Tartans as the first half slowed to an end. Emory managed to convert 11 first-half turnovers by the Tartans into 23 points, while the Tartans could only force one single mishap from Emory. After the first 20 minutes of play, the Eagles had converted 11 out of 17 three-point shots, and shot 50 percent from the floor. The Tartans shot a respectable 43.5 percent from the floor, but it was not enough to slow down the train that Emory brought to Skibo Gym. 
Despite the abysmal first half, the Tartans did not give up or throw in the towel. As the second half went underway, it appeared as if the Tartans were genuinely going to make a comeback. Carnegie Mellon opened the second half with an entirely unexpected 24–3 scoring run. Carnegie Mellon kept Emory without a score from the field for the first 10 minutes of the second half. The Eagles missed their first 16 shots in the second half of the game, but despite this dry spell, they maintained a lead that came to five points at its lowest. Once Emory broke out of the spell, they scored the next seven points and pushed the score to 63–51. The Tartans would remain trailing by double digits for the rest of the night.
Though Emory was a good team and Carnegie Mellon was expecting a challenge, this loss hurts for the Tartan squad. Losing is never a fun experience, but the feeling becomes even stronger when you know your team didn’t play well. Of course, this was not the Tartan’s best game. Though Carnegie Mellon did have a higher shooting percentage than Emory from the field, the real difference came in turnovers. Emory doubled the amount of turnovers that Carnegie Mellon created, a whopping 18 turnovers to Carnegie Mellon’s nine. This is the most crucial statistic in determining the Tartan’s mistakes. The points that Emory scored from those turnovers totaled to 35, whereas Carnegie Mellon only managed 12 points off turnovers. The points scored from turnovers total to a 23-point lead by themselves, and any team would have a hard time winning if they give up possession that many times.
Junior Jack Serbin did manage to get his 14th double-double for the Tartans, scoring a team-high 15 points with 14 rebounds. Maha was the only other player to score in double digits with 11 points. If the Tartans want to win games, they’re going to have to stop giving the ball up and be much more aggressive in pressing their advantages.
On Sunday, the Tartan men’s basketball team faced off against the University of Rochester in what turned out to be the highest scoring game of the season, and emerged victorious to a score of 102–97 in a double-overtime heater. The win moves the Tartans’ record to 10–14, 3–10 in UAA play. This win also means that the Tartans are now 21–1 when scoring 100 points or more in a single game since the 1947–48 season.
Carnegie Mellon fell behind at first, trailing 18–6 within the first six minutes of the game. The Tartans then went on a 10–3 scoring run to come within one point at 21–20. With less than three minutes left in the half, senior Blake Chasen gave the Tartans their first lead of the game thanks to a foul shot. At the halftime break, the Tartans held a one-point advantage at 33–32 and were prepared to keep fighting.
Both teams came into the second half with a hot scoring hand. Rochester scored on its first five shots, while Carnegie Mellon converted its first seven. The Tartans continued to edge ahead thanks to the scoring efforts of sophomore Ryan Maha. The game stayed close, and neither team led by more than five points at any point in the rest of the half. Rochester held a five-point advantage with just over a minute left to play in the second half, but a layup from junior Chris Shkil followed by a three-pointer from junior Jack Serbin tied the game and sent it into overtime.
Carnegie Mellon opened overtime with quick scores, draining multiple three-pointers to gain its largest lead of the game. Rochester scored the next five points, and the Tartans were ahead 88–86 with nine seconds to play. However, the visiting team got the last shot and made it count, tying the game and sending it into yet another overtime period.
Maha was the hero of the second overtime period, scoring nine of his career-best 25 points in double overtime alone. With five seconds left, a pair of foul shots from Serbin sealed the victory for the Tartans.
Maha led the Tartans in scoring with his career-best 25 points, as well as four assists. Serbin also made his mark on the game with 19 points and 17 rebounds to record his fifteenth double-double. Shkil also grabbed 12 points and 12 rebounds to record his fourth double-double.
The Tartans will finish the season with a home contest at home against UAA rival Case Western Reserve University on Saturday, Feb. 27 at 5 p.m.

The Carnegie Mellon women’s basketball team competed against Emory University on Friday in a very tough fought game. The Tartans came out on top of the Eagles by a score of 70–62, avenging their 63–52 loss in Atlanta earlier this season.
The start of the game saw the Tartans and the Eagles matching each other for points. At a critical juncture, senior forward Liza Otto was covered tight by two Emory players, but still got the ball out to junior guard Jackie Hudepohl who managed to get an easy basket. From there, the Tartans began to build a lead with junior center and forward Lisa Murphy leading the charge in a 13–0 run. Following this run, Emory took advantage of three Tartan turnovers, bringing the game to 20–15 before the end of the quarter.
In the second quarter, Emory tied the game up 22–22 before taking their first lead since the early minutes of the game as the Tartans were unable to keep up their early scoring run. A foul after Murphy made a basket got the Tartans back into the lead. Both teams continued to fight hard against each other as the Tartans managed to hold onto the lead at the end of the half with a 34–32 score.
In the third quarter, the Tartans were able to build on their lead by scoring seven shots from inside the paint before the Eagles started to come back again. The Tartans held onto a 52–48 lead going into the final quarter.
The fourth quarter saw the Eagles continuing to fight back with a number of three-point shots helping to close the gap. After the Eagles retook the lead when they capped off a 12–6 run, the Tartans came back immediately with a three-pointer by senior guard Lindsay Poss, that kicked off a 12–0 run. As the Tartans continued to expand their lead, the Eagles became desperate to fight the clock, making fouls in an attempt to limit Carnegie Mellon’s possessions. The Tartans refused to relinquish the lead, and the team easily held on to win.
Murphy continues to be one of the biggest contributors to the team’s success. The psychology major has been one of the most dominant players in Tartan history, having broken the school records in points scored, field goals made, field goal percentage, free throws made, and free throws attempted during her first year on the squad. She then proceeded to trump almost all of those marks last season, and she hasn’t stopped there. Murphy has already improved on her records of points scored and field goals made. Murphy’s 32 points during the night was the sixth time this season she scored 31 or more points despite not having even attempted a three-point field goal this season. Though her opponents know she will be a challenge, she continues to find ways to get points from the paint, freeing up her teammates to make plays of their own.
Hudepohl scored 17 points, including four of six free throw attempts during the final minute as Emory tried to make an impossible comeback. Otto came up with 11 points and four assists, and Poss totaled 10 points, 12 rebounds, and four assists.
On Sunday, the Tartans took on the University of Rochester Yellow Jackets and upset their 12th-ranked UAA opponent. Carnegie Mellon held a strong offensive grip on the game and never let up. Hudepohl scored a career-best 29 points and 10 rebounds to record her fifth double-double of the season. Murphy scored 27 points on 11 of 16 shots, and also tabbed 17 rebounds along with five blocks. Otto also broke a career record with 26 points to contribute to the Tartans’ scoring extravaganza.
The Tartans will close out the season in a rematch against Case Western Reserve University on Saturday, Feb. 27.

The Carnegie Mellon men’s tennis team took the court on Friday against 11th-ranked Pomona-Pitzer College in the quarterfinal round of the ITA National Team Indoor Championship. The Tartans defeated the second seed with a 5–4 score, bringing them to 5–2 on the season. The Tartans started the competition off strong in doubles play from the pair of first-years Daniel Levine and Vayum Arora, taking first doubles decisively with a score of 8–3. Seniors Abhishek Alla and Yuvraj Kumar won 8–6 in third doubles, and sophomore Jeffrey Chen fell in a tiebreaker for second doubles with a score of 9–8(9–7).
Carnegie Mellon fell behind 3–2 as Pomona-Pitzer took first and fifth singles, but Levine managed to even the score again in second singles, winning 6–4, 7–5.

Junior Kenny Zheng scored the fifth and final point for the Tartans, winning 7–6(7–4), 3–6, 7–5 in third singles.
On Saturday, the team advanced to the semifinal round of the tournament and fell to University Athletic Association (UAA) opponent Emory University.

Emory tied the match in third doubles, but the combination of Chen and Zheng pulled off a 9–7 victory in second doubles to put the Tartans back in the lead heading into singles play.
Unfortunately, singles play did not go as well as doubles. The only point for the Tartans in singles play came from Chaz Downing in sixth singles, winning 6–2, 2–6, 10–2. The Tartans were disappointed, but they moved on to play in the third place match on Sunday for a chance at some sort of redemption.
That redemption did not come for the Tartans in the third place match. Carnegie Mellon fell 5–4 in a barn burner against University Athletic Association (UAA) rival Case Western Reserve University. The loss drops the Tartans to 5–4 on the season, and they took fourth place in the tournament.
Doubles play gave the Tartans confidence and allowed them to gain a lead. Senior pair Alla and Kumar fought their way to a 9–7 victory in third doubles, while the pair of Chen and Zheng managed to score their own point for the Tartans. The team headed into singles play with a 2–1 lead.
Levine kept the Tartans in the game with a nail-biting win in three sets, edging out his opponent 6–2, 3–6, 6–2 to bring the score to 4–3. Freshman Downing showed his prowess in singles play once again, scoring the final point for the Tartan in sixth singles, 6–4, 6–1. Case Western Reserve managed to find victories in first, third, fourth, and fifth singles to put the Tartans away.
This marks the second fourth-place finish for the Tartans in four appearances at the ITA National Indoor Championship. The next challenge begins for the Tartans on Sunday, March 6 in Claremont, California as they take on Whittier College.

South Carolina voted in the second Republican Presidential Primary on Saturday, turning weeks of speculation and polling into a political reality. In a scene that would have been unimaginable one year ago, businessman Donald Trump took his second primary victory, while former Florida governor and once front-runner Jeb Bush dropped out of the race, allowing Trump to steal the spotlight.
Despite giving a diatribe against the policies of President George W. Bush during the previous Republican debate, Trump still managed to win South Carolina with a comfortable margin of victory. Evidently, Republicans are more open to criticism of the former president when the words come out of a man who completely disregards any and all political sensibility. Cementing his role as the new front-runner, Trump is already looking ahead past the Nevada caucus this Tuesday to Super Tuesday on March 1, when 12 primary elections occur. He hopes to build a considerable lead against the rest of his Republican rivals.
In the fight for second place, Senator Ted Cruz (R-TX) and Senator Marco Rubio (R-FL) both had hopes of unseating Trump for the victory in South Carolina, but they instead found themselves in a virtual tie for the title of first loser. Cruz, the “principled conservative” of this election, is also looking ahead to Super Tuesday, where the number of states with more conservative populations will favor him. Cruz, however, still faces voting day controversy. Both Trump and Rubio have accused Cruz of utilizing dishonest robo-calls, echoing the charge that Cruz’s campaign had lied about retired neurosurgeon Ben Carson dropping out during the Iowa caucus.
Rubio’s recent string of endorsements, including one from South Carolina Governor Nikki Haley, helped him recapture the momentum he had lost in New Hampshire. Despite South Carolina’s population appearing to be easy pickings for Cruz, Rubio’s strong showing serves as a potential sign that Rubio can be the man to unite the Republican Party. Although the clamor for Rubio to become the choice for moderates has once again begun, Ohio Governor John Kasich remains optimistic that he will take on that role when the primaries happen in less conservative states.
For Rubio, the news of Bush dropping out on Saturday can only help his campaign. Bush previously pinned his hopes on a strong finish in South Carolina, where he received the endorsement of Senator Lindsey Graham (R-SC) and hoped to receive Haley’s seal of approval. He finally enlisted the help of his presidential brother, but Trump’s insistence that the Republicans must acknowledge the failures of the Bush administration if they want to win in November seemed to limit the effectiveness the former president may have otherwise had. With the race between moderates down to just Rubio and Kasich, the establishment may yet have a say in this most unorthodox of primary election seasons.
Carson, despite his last-place finish, remains in the race. At this point, he has nothing to gain by remaining in the race, having given it his all during the summer. Perhaps he remains in the running just to keep a small fraction of voters away from Cruz in retaliation for the dishonesty his campaign suffered in Iowa.While this may amount to nothing, this election cycle has proven that anything is possible. If there is a brokered convention and Carson still remains a thorn in Cruz’s side, it may prove to be a considerable factor should the race last that long.

Voters in Nevada voiced their preferences for the Democratic presidential nominee on Saturday. While former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton won with over 50 percent of the vote, Senator Bernie Sanders (I-VT) once again had a strong showing that continues to challenge Clinton for the Democratic nomination.
Shortly after 5 p.m., the Clinton campaign was able to take a sigh of relief for the first time this primary season. After the razor-thin margin of victory in Iowa and the considerable loss in New Hampshire, Clinton finally came away with a sizable margin of victory over her only competitor.
In entrance polling conducted by Edison Research and utilized by a variety of news outlets, Clinton commanded the support of 57 percent of women and 76 percent of blacks, both critical voting blocks for Democrats. In a state like South Carolina where about 60 percent of Democratic voters are black, Clinton’s efforts to win their support will likely pay off.
Meanwhile, Sanders declared in his concession speech that he was proud to have come so close to victory after being behind by more than 25 points a month ago. In entrance polling, 53 percent of Hispanics indicated support for Sanders, suggesting that the senator may yet appeal to diverse voting populations that so far still seem to favor Clinton. CNN exit polls indicated that Sanders won the hearts of 83 percent of millennials, continuing to show his strength among young voters looking to buck the current system. With another moral victory in hand, Sanders is looking forward to Super Tuesday, when he hopes to capture many delegates when the 12 states that vote on March 1 make their choices.
With this Tuesday’s primary in South Carolina likely to be a large margin of victory for Clinton, Super Tuesday is where the Democratic race may change dynamically. Should Clinton win a strong majority of the states and delegates, her aura of inevitability may be restored, and her path to the Democratic nomination would become much clearer. Should Sanders turn out the victor in a strong minority or perhaps a slim majority of the states, his insurgent campaign could continue to wreak havoc on Clinton’s plans. Clinton would still be the front-runner, but Sanders’ challenge would become more powerful and real than just a few early states, potentially allowing him to continue challenging Clinton late into the primary season.
Though the chances of a brokered convention for the Democrats is minuscule compared to the possibility that the Republicans cannot outright nominate anyone, a sufficiently strong challenge from Sanders may force the Democrats to continue debating their choice of nominee for quite some time.

Generally, both Democrats and Republicans tend to be in favor of free trade to an extent, but multiple people are vying for the opportunity to be the most staunchly protectionist president since Herbert Hoover. Free trade has become an increasingly divisive issue since the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) removed trade barriers between the United States, Canada, and Mexico. Trade has become a flash point once again over the past year. Two of our federal trade agreements, the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) — a trade pact which removes many trade barriers between Pacific Rim nations — and the Export-Import (Ex-Im) Bank — a federal agency designed to give out loans to American exporters — have become the subject of high-profile congressional battles. This is one of the clearest wedge issues between candidates within each party.
Hillary Clinton, Former Secretary of State
While Secretary of State, Clinton was a champion of the TPP, but has since reversed her position. She also seems to oppose a trade deal between the Obama administration and Europe. Clinton’s stated reason is that the currency manipulation protections that were in the TPP when she was privy to discussions were absent from the newest version of the pact. Clinton was away from the negotiations for some time, and it is quite possible that the problems she had with the deal were not in the version she saw, but it is also possible she changed her position in order to gain union support. Clinton has a very mixed history on free trade. She defended NAFTA and as a senator she generally voted for free trade agreements with the notable exception of the Central American Free Trade Agreement (CAFTA), which removed trade barriers with countries in Central America and granted test data exclusivity to drug companies to prevent the creation of generic medications. When running for president in 2008, Clinton strongly opposed free trade, calling NAFTA a mistake. The complications of individual free trade deals are probably in play and Clinton likely has a stance individualized to each one. The evidence says she opposes large free trade deals on a conceptual level, but with the right protections she thinks they can be okay, though Clinton still supports smaller deals.
Clinton is less difficult to gauge on export financing. She condemned Republican Congress members for failing to act on the agency’s expiring charter, saying that the jobs supported by the Ex-Im Bank were at risk.
Senator Bernie Sanders (I-VT)
Sanders has long been a vocal opponent of not just free trade, but trade in general. He denounced the Clinton era Permanent Normal Trade Relations (PNTR) with China as shipping jobs over to a country with lax labor laws and hurting the US economy. He had similar concerns with NAFTA and many other free trade deals. Sanders thinks all free trade deals are designed to benefit corporate America at the expense of American workers and give corporations leverage to simply find a new country to operate in if the labor costs get too high. He thinks that globalization nullifies American labor laws.
Sanders also was the  only non-Republican to oppose the renewal of the charter of the Ex-Im Bank, calling it an “outrageous example of corporate welfare.” He believes the bank’s claim that it helps small business is untrue.
Retired Neurosurgeon Ben Carson
In his book in 2012, Ben Carson said heavy tariffs on assembled goods would help America’s trade imbalance. However, Carson has said that he supports free trade, although he thinks it should go through Congress  given the complexities.
Carson also believes that the Ex-Im Bank is a counterproductive government intervention into the free market.
Senator Ted Cruz (R-TX)
Cruz supports free trade, but believes that Congress should be able to vet free trade agreements. He refused to pass the Trade Promotion Authority (TPA), which fast tracked the president’s ability to pass the TPP unless Republican party leadership committed to letting the Ex-Im Bank’s charter expire. The TPA was likely a rebuke of Obama and not free trade.
Ohio Governor John Kasich
Kasich generally supports free trade, but believes there ought be certain limits. His primary issue is that occasionally free trade agreements will allow countries to violate international law and the court challenges take two years while American workers are out of a job. He also plans to focus on currency manipulation, intellectual property, and cyber-attacks when making deals.
Kasich claimed to support the TPP in a Republican debate. However, he has been one of the more vocal opponents of the Ex-Im Bank, saying it is unnecessary corporate welfare that simply exists to fund risky, ventures the market has deemed likely to fail.
Senator Marco Rubio (R-FL)
Rubio has openly supported free trade in the past on the basis that U.S. companies get access to larger markets by selling to foreign populations. He also has a consistent record of voting for free trade deals with other countries such as Panama, Colombia, and South Korea. Rubio has also supported the TPP on the grounds that it will help the United States strategically in Asia as well as economically, despite the political peril of siding with President Obama as a Republican.
Reality Show Host Donald Trump
Trump has been a vicious critic of free trade. In many Republican debates, Trump has said free trade deals have eroded American jobs. In his 2011 book, Time to Get Tough, Trump said 15 percent tariffs should be imposed on all imported goods and called the South Korean Free Trade Agreement “embarrassing.” He wants to impose heavy tariffs on goods from Mexico and China in particular, saying he was not opposed to a tariff as high as 45 percent. More specifically, he has proposed a 35 percent tariff on cars from Mexico andusing international law to beat back China’s tariffs on American goods and export subsidies. Trump said the tariffs on Mexico would reduce the trade deficit with Mexico and force them into building his wall along the Mexican border in Thursday’s Republican Town Hall on CNN.
Trump has said the United States needs “fair trade” and is a staunchly protectionist candidate. He often says China, Japan, Mexico, and Vietnam are beating America at trade.
Trump probably feels negatively about the Ex-Im Bank given that he believes Chinese export financing is illegal.

Former Florida governor Jeb Bush announced that he is dropping out of the 2016 electoral race. The emotional announcement came late Saturday night after a disappointing placement in South Carolina, a state that crucially assisted both of the former Bush presidents in their electoral victories. This is just one of several losses in the early determining primaries in which businessman Donald Trump has continued to lead the Republican Party.
After failure to perform week after week in the primaries, it is clear that the Republican Party is no longer looking for another Bush name. Bush underperformed expectations in Iowa, New Hampshire, and South Carolina, constantly losing to more popular names like Senator Ted Cruz (R-TX) and Senator Marco Rubio (R-FL). Many supporters of the Bush campaign were building off the legacy of his name from his father and brother, George H. W. Bush and George W. Bush, respectively. Many have questioned the Bush lineage, with concerns about his family’s politics present throughout his campaign, but Bush has insisted that a campaign “can’t be about the past; it can’t be about my mom and dad, or my brother, who I love. It has to be about the ideas I believe in to move our country forward.” But voters’ tastes have evolved since the days of the last Bush presidency. What Republicans want now is not what Jeb can give them, but rather what Trump is embodying.
The Bush campaign was meant to encompass traditional Republican values that other candidates overlooked. During his campaign, Bush rejected the tactics of Tea Partiers who have vocally supported a shutdown of the federal government. Jeb has remained an adamant supporter of a reformed Common Core education program and has written a 300-page book regarding his views on immigration reform. However, as the election progressed, it became clear that his campaign was largely reliant on financial strength, as opposed to actual reforms. Bush translated his connections as former governor into donations from longtime supporters, with up to $118 million going to his Super PAC, Right to Rise USA. 
The campaign called this strategy “shock and awe,” but did not think that would be describing  its massive failure.
Yet, as Bush’s campaign proceeded, there was a clear failure on his behalf to embrace voters. He took only 2.8 percent of total votes in the Iowa caucus, despite having outspent his competitors there. Eventually, the donations began to diminish, and his campaign staff had to resort to budget cuts and rebranding. Bush’s withdrawal now frees up millions of dollars to the other Floridian running for the GOP nomination, Rubio, who has ties to the same bidders as Bush.
This lack of voter support stems largely from Jeb Bush’s inability to demonstrate command and leadership to the mass public. As seen through many of the GOP debates in the past year, Bush has always been weaker in attacking his fellow opponents, including his protégé Marco Rubio. He provided long-winded answers to simple questions during town halls with his voter base, and could not give concise answers in televised debates watched by millions. What he lacked in oration, however, he made up with being Donald Trump’s biggest critic. Bush would constantly critique Trump’s strategies and worldview, and assert that “our country deserves a president for everyone.” Now with Bush’s departure from the electoral race, there no longer stands a contender willing to tackle Trump’s boisterous politics.
Despite being in tears during his concession speech, Bush has stated that he will continue to fight for conservative ideals.
While the audience was also heartbroken over the loss of a high profile, true rival to Donald Trump, it is perhaps best that stronger leaders continue the fight to the White House.

When I think about 3-D printing technology, most of my thoughts revolve around printing fancy gadgets. However, researchers at Carnegie Mellon are expanding the application of 3-D printing technology into the realm of prosthetics by partnering with e-NABLE, a global network of passionate volunteers who use their 3-D printers, design skills, and personal time to create free 3-D-printed prosthetic hands for those in need. 
Founded in 2013, the organization has satisfied more than 1,500 requests for assistive devices, but the number of requests is growing beyond e-NABLE’s ability. To ease the short supply tension, HCII professors Jennifer Mankoff and Scott Hudson have teamed up with e-NABLE on a project entitled “Revolutionizing Assistive Devices Via Distributed Innovation, Fabrication and Refinement” to find ways to make the customization, production, and distribution of these 3-D-printed assistive devices more efficient and effective.
According to the project description, “The research will focus on three specific aspects of DIY-AT (do-it-yourself assistive technologies): developing algorithms that improve how makers create computationally customizable physical devices; creating virtual service teams that allow multiple stakeholders to work together smoothly across ability levels and geographic distance to solve bigger, more complex problems; and studying the specific needs of clinical expert participation in assistive technology creation and provision, with the hope of revolutionizing the process.”
e-NABLE consists of over 3,600 members all over the world including engineers, prosthetists, artists, 3-D printing experts, philanthropists, and students. They aim at providing free service for those who can’t afford a professionally made assistive body part. According to e-NABLE, a professionally made, muscle-actuated hand can cost between $6,000 and $10,000, with much of the cost coming from the materials and parts alone. But a 3-D-printed hand assembled by e-NABLE volunteers only incurs about $20 to $50 in material costs for a hand device and $50 to $150 for one arm designs.
e-NABLE also works to design unique prosthetics for individual users. For example, they created a bow holder for a girl born without fingers that allowed her to play her viola. Most e-NABLE hand users are children, so the prosthetics are often developed to serve the purpose of riding bikes, throwing a ball with the dog, swimming, and other activities.
e-NABLE works as a mostly web-based service; there are databases of existing designs and a handful of guidelines that make the process easy and accessible. Users submit requests online with a provided guideline and pictures of their body parts that needs assistive technology. After receiving the request, volunteers help select a suitable design for each user, print, and assemble the 3-D-printed parts, and send the parts to the user.
Since resources are limited, and 3-D printing usually takes a long time, there is still much room for improvement. “We are trying to change the way 3-D modeling happens so we can make it easier for people who are not highly trained while still ensuring high quality results,” Mankoff said. “We are trying to understand how to make 3-D modeling a process that can more easily be driven by requests, that supports testability and quality control, and that is modular.”
The team is working to improve their process by incorporating a research paper Mankoff published that explores three attachment techniques of 3-D printing: print-over, print-to-affix, and print-through. Researchers hope to develop a software that allows users to import a 3-D item and click on where they want to add an attachment, such as a handle, and then let the system do rest of the work to make the design happen.
In addition, since most e-NABLE volunteers need to work in teams to perform different tasks, but can’t meet physically, building more effective teams is crucial to improve communication and collaboration. 
Another HCII professor, Robert Kraut, will lead a section of research on “how open-source communities use information to improve processes to the maker community.”
“The goal is to improve the efficiency of building a customer prosthetic device for a particular recipient by allowing multiple people to contribute different skills in measuring, building and fitting the device, while still presenting a single point of contact for recipients and their caregivers,” Kraut said.
Hopefully by 2040, the process will become quicker and more effective to allow more people to benefit from 3-D-printed technology. “This project is trying to create a capability to create real-world objects that serve real-world needs without requiring the level of expertise that’s currently required — making it easier to make things that matter and that particularly help people with disabilities,” Mankoff said. 
The project aims not only at making assistive devises, but also aims at revolutionizing how computers can better serve humanity. “For now it’s prosthetics, but I hope that eventually we can move beyond that,” Mankoff said.

Several weeks ago Jeremy Searock, a Technical Project Manager in the Carnegie Mellon Robotics Institute, and Sikorsky, an aircraft manufacturer, tested their latest inventions in autonomous warfare technology. Sikorsky designed an Unmanned Air Vehicle, or UAV, and Searock designed an Unmanned Ground Vehicle, or UGV. 
The test involved flying the UAV autonomously and deploying the UGV to an outdoor test zone, and the UGV driving across the test zone, which was constructed to have obstructions and vehicle impediments. The UGV, designed to function autonomously, was successfully able to drive itself across trails and foreign environments by avoiding dangerous obstructions such as rocks and crevices.
The UGV that Searock designed relies on an autonomous system embedded in the vehicle that performs the computational tasks required for self-driving. The autonomous system begins with sensors that can survey the nearby environment of the UGV. The sensors are able to translate the surroundings into an input the autonomous system can read through the use of voxels, which are essentially 3-D computer pixels. 
The voxels, much like regular pixels in 2-D computational tools, paint a picture of what the nearby environment looks like for the UGV and get fed into a perception system and essentially tell the UGV what is in the nearby environment. The perception system then measures the risk level of the environment through a software algorithm developed by Searock and his research team, and makes judgments on how to physically move through the environment. 
“The perception system uses risk management to figure out which direction to follow,” Searock said. If it perceives an obstacle or obstruction, the perception system performs calculations to determine the safest way to travel, and then executes that action through the machinery of the vehicle.
The UGV relies on the union of both hardware and software to accomplish its tasks. The algorithms embedded in the software of the autonomous system calculate the best route to travel on based on the conditions of the surrounding environment. The input from the environment and the execution of actions rely on the electronic hardware of the UGV that can detect physical stimuli and perform mechanical actions such as moving and turning, respectively. 
To provide an analogy, the software is the brain of the UGV, evaluating risk issues and providing instantaneous feedback on how to proceed. Similarly, the hardware is analogous to the limbs of the body, sending messages to the brain about what it perceives and executing the commands it receives from the brain.
The technologies that Searock developed aren’t limited to just the UGV. The algorithms underlying the UGV that allow it to drive are a foundation for future autonomous vehicles. The National Robotics Engineering Center (NREC), a subsection within the Robotics Institute, continues to further push the limit of autonomous vehicles. Searock is currently working to improve the limits of the UGV’s driving capacity to drive through even more deformed and treacherous areas. 
Additionally, Searock is hoping to eventually develop an autonomous boat, capable of navigating and sailing by itself. Physical variables that an autonomous boat must consider that a ground vehicle does not, however, include buoyancy, aquatic animals, capsizing, and sinking, among others. Accounting for these variables requires a different approach to the autonomous system that Searock and his research team have already developed, but they can be built on top of the groundwork from the UGV has already put the project in motion.
In addition, these technologies aren’t limited to just warfare applications. Autonomous driving is a rising interest in automobile industries, and implementing an autonomous driving system is a very attractive feature to consumers. Some of the obvious issues with such a system are risk and safety management. However, the technology Searock and his team have developed are able to combat those issues with success.
Although a pre-determined test zone is very different from the roads and streets of reality, Searock’s developments are an encouraging breakthrough for autonomous driving and industry, and more importantly a breakthrough in the field of autonomous robotics.

This week’s topic in Pugwash is instant gratification. In today’s world, we’re constantly connected through our computers, our phones, and even our watches. 
We can talk to people we know or strangers across the world, or dig into the past and a large portion of humanity’s knowledge, all at a moment’s notice. Is this unfettered access allowing us to reach greater heights than ever? Or is it degrading our attention spans and our ability to focus on issues that actually matter?
Our meeting started out with a short video from Louis C.K., a famous comedian. In it, he complains that even though there’s so many awesome things that come from today’s technology, no one really appreciates it. People spend all their time poking at phones and complaining that their connection is slow.
However, as one member pointed out, Louis C.K. is a comedian, not a philosopher. While he makes funny jokes, he isn’t always the most factual or insightful person. Technology has definitely improved quality of life in so many ways for almost everyone in developed countries, even if people do get frustrated over slow internet connections.
Another point brought up throughout the conversation was that people distracted themselves even before there were smartphones or websites like Reddit or 9gag. Instead of reading comics in the newspaper, we now browse cat pictures on Facebook. 
Instead of twiddling our thumbs or spinning a pencil, we now spin our phones or check them for new messages. Boredom is becoming obsolete.
While you might appreciate the idea of getting rid of boredom while waiting for the bus, some research shows that being bored and allowing the mind to wander is an important aspect of creativity. In addition, if relieving boredom with smartphones turns into having a need to constantly use a smartphone, there would seem to be a problem.
It could be that constantly flipping from one stimulus to another is dulling our ability to really drill down and focus on a task at hand. We do have events like hackathons, which show that being able to single-mindedly focus for long periods of time isn’t entirely a lost art, but can hackathon participants really be said to represent society? 
Maybe for some people, concentrating isn’t a problem, but that might not be true for society as a whole. One Pugwash member even compared instant gratification to opium use in China, as something that could be dulling the edge of our entire society without us noticing.
While we didn’t have answers on this particular question, Pugwash agreed that it would be interesting to see data on how well the entire population can concentrate today versus twenty, fifty, or a hundred years ago.
On the other hand, having instant access to information can make it easier to get invested in a project, as small problems can be more easily overcome, allowing you to keep working on something without getting stuck.
As far as human interactions go, there was a split between those who thought online interactions and instant messaging were just as healthy as in-person interactions, and those who were worried that something was being lost. Even if something is being lost by having conversations over the internet, was it really worth everything that’s being gained? Instead of having in-person conversations end when a fact can’t be remembered or agreed upon, people can look things up and continue. And long-distance communications are entirely positive, as they’re replacing not having any communications at all.
Finally, Pugwash wondered if perhaps the problem with instant gratification is just youths being youths. Younger people have always been seen as flighty or lacking concentration by older generations, and time has different values at different points in one’s life. Every small portion of time means more to people when they’re young. 
One year as a 20 year old is 5 percent of your life, whereas one year as a 50 year old is 2 percent. Life is more chaotic as well, as we’re uprooted from elementary school to middle school to high school to college. Perhaps when people settle down and have a longer perspective, the instant gratification will have less of an immediate draw.
Instant gratification is a large topic that affects us all, and Pugwash doesn’t have all the answers. Whenever you choose to browse Reddit, Facebook, or the like instead of working on that project due next week, you’re choosing the instant gratification of cat pics over a long-term goal. Maybe this is putting society on a downhill slope, or maybe it’s just a side-effect of modern life as a millennial.
Student Pugwash is a non-advocacy, educational organization that discusses the implications of science. This article is a summary of last week’s discussion on instant gratification.

Have you ever felt like a scene of your life was on repeat? Did your surroundings feel unusually predictable, even though that exact scene was nowhere to be found earlier in the script of your life? Did it feel surreal or uncanny, different from the sense of comfort or boredom that the feeling of familiarity usually evokes?
If so, then you are probably one of the 60 to 70 percent of people who claimed to have experienced déjà vu, a particular experience that was first named by Émile Boirac in 1876. 
With the literal translation of “already seen” in French, déjà vu is used to describe the perception that a current situation has exactly happened before, even though it is actually being experienced for the first time. It is an overwhelming experience that generally lasts for a fleeting 10 to 30 seconds.
According to the website  howstuffworks.com, scientists have been trying to rationalize this peculiar phenomenon for a long time. Researchers believe that understanding déjà vu can be helpful in learning more about how memory works.
Studying déjà vu, however, poses many challenges. Since it tends to occur randomly, for short periods of time, data on déjà vu events is heavily based on a personal accounts. Furthermore, people may be confused as to when they are experiencing déjà vu. Or, if taking part in a research study, human subjects may say that they experienced déjà vu primarily out of the desire to give the experimenter the “right” answer.
While déjà vu can be an elusive topic to study, over 40 theories have arisen to explain it, since the 19th century. One theory suggests that déjà vu may be a result of a glitch in the way our brain processes information into short and longterm memories. Researchers found that the medial temporal lobe of our brain plays a role in our conscious memory. 
The brain also includes the temporal lobe, which includes the hippocampus and the parahippocampal gyrus. The hippocampus allows us to recall memories, while the parahippocampal gyrus contributes to our sense of familiarity, without bringing back a particular memory. 
Since incoming information travels through multiple paths in the brain, sometimes the processing centers in our brain become out of sync as they blend information together. As a result, our brains can confuse a memory being experienced as a previous memory.
Another theory focuses on the state of our divided attention. In one study, collaborating researchers from Duke University and Southern Methodist University ask students to look at a series of photographs of locations on a college campus.
Outside of their conscious awareness, the students were shown some photos for 10 to 20 milliseconds each — sufficient time for the brain to register the photos. When the students saw the photos that were quickly flashed, the majority of the students who had never actually been to the locations shown felt as if they had visited those very locations.
While déjà vu was not replicated in the study, the findings suggest that our mind can pick up information outside of our conscious, leading to seemingly inexplicable feelings of familiarity. Hence, this may explain why when we enter a house for the first time, we might feel like we have been there before. 
For instance, after walking in the house, our attention might first be drawn toward the host greeting and chatting with us. During that time, our brains are allowing us to unconsciously process our surroundings. Thus, once we take a closer look at our surroundings, we may feel an uncanny familiarity with the house.
There are also many theories that look at the role of memory in creating déjà vu experiences. Some researchers believe a familiar fragment of your environment can bring back memories that lead to déjà vu. 
Others suggest that other sources of information besides our actual experiences, such as books and movies, can also lead to déjà vu. Some also strongly believe that precognitive dreams, or dreams that predict the future, are the cause for many déjà vu experiences.
So what factors might increase your chance of getting déjà vu? 
It appears that most people start having déjà vu at around the ages of six to ten. Anytime before is probably too early, because young children would struggle in pointing out unusual feelings of familiarity. Occurrences of déjà vu peak among people between 15 to 25 years in age, and afterwards, feelings of déjà vu decline until it disappears once people reach their 50s.
While we might associate older age with increase in memory problems, researchers suggest that déjà vu might be an indicator of a healthy mind, as that person is more capable of recognizing faulty feelings of familiarity. Thus, without having déjà vu, older people could then be more likely to believe that those experiences had actually happened.
Other studies suggest that déjà vu occurs more frequently among people with a higher level of income or education. People with more vivid imaginations or those who have better recollections of their dreams also appear to have more déjà vu experiences. Déjà vu also tends to occur during mundane, everyday experiences. More exciting events are more likely to be remembered, and thus, déjà vu is less likely to occur.
So while the strangeness of déjà vu has made people believe it is a sign of past lives or parallel universes, the peculiar phenomenon appears to be harmless, as it occurs frequently within the general population. 
While there is no consensus on how déjà vu works, with further research advances we may just be able to unlock more secrets on the larger picture and learn more about how our brains process and store memories.

Gravity waves were triggered by black holes colliding
On Sept. 14, the Advanced Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory (LIGO) sensed a disturbance in space-time caused by two massive black holes smashing together. When black holes collide, they merge to form a larger black hole, sending ripples of gravity waves out. The black holes had masses of 29 and 36 suns, roughly twice as massive as the previous record-holders.
“It’s quite an incredible discovery,” said Vikram Ravi, an astrophysicist at the California Institute of Technology. Estimates put the black holes’ collision at 1.3 billion light-years away, and in order to pinpoint the location of the black holes, LIGO is partnering with telescopes around the world. At 0.4 seconds after LIGO’s detection of the collision, the Fermi gamma-ray satellite picked up a faint flash of gamma radiation. While researchers can’t pinpoint exactly where the burst came from, the direction is roughly consistent with LIGO’s prediction.
With these estimates, it is possible that LIGO has previously detected more black hole collisions.

FDA will start testing food for any possible carcinogen herbicide
The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) will begin testing various foods, including soybeans, corn, milk, and eggs, for exposure to glyphosate. Glyphosate is the active ingredient in several of the most widely used herbicides, with more than 250 million pounds applied to agricultural lands in the U.S. annually.
Although it is widely used, regulatory agencies have concluded that glyphosate has low toxicity, and numerous toxicology studies, many of which were conducted by industry as required by the EPA, have found that glyphosate is relatively harmless, which is why there has been no routine testing for glyphosate in food or people.
However, the World Health Organization (WHO) rated glyphosate as “probably carcinogenic to humans,” in part due to finding limited evidence from real-world exposures in humans. Although the call came in 2014 to strengthen monitoring of glyphosate, new methods from the FDA make the process much more financially feasible.

New data calculate land most sensitive to climate change
According to a new study published in the journal Nature on Wednesday, researchers have identified regions of the world where vegetation has responded most to climate change.
The researchers examined satellite data from 2000 to 2013 to see how various ecosystems responded to monthly changes in climate over time. They then devised a Vegetation Sensitivity Index to compare fluctuations in temperature, water availability, and cloudiness to the health of plants in a certain ecosystem. Such geology, soil, air, water, and living organisms contribute to the world’s stock of natural assets, called natural capital.
“This approach now enables us to to do is to start to identify the most vulnerable natural capital stocks provided by vegetation,” said Kathy Willis, the director of science at the U.K.’s Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew, “and this in itself provides an important first step to highlight regions of sensitivity for global food security that we obtain from plants.”

Theoretical five-dimensional black hole hypothesized
Researchers from the University of Cambridge and Queen Mary University of London have successfully shown how an oddly shaped black hole with such amazingly intense gravity could cause Einstein’s general theory of relativity to break down.
Using supercomputers, the researchers simulated how a black hole would behave in a five dimensional world. 
The simulated black hole is shaped like a very thin ring, giving rise to a series of bulges connected by strings, or thin lines, that become thinner over time. When the rings become too thin, they pinch off into miniature black holes, similar to how faucet water breaks into little droplets before completely turning off.
Although physicists theorized ring-shaped black holes back in 2002, this is the first time their dynamics have been modeled. If such a black hole were to exist, the equations of general relativity would break down due to the appearance of a ‘naked singularity.’ The results are published in the journal Physical Review Letters.

Fallen meteorites with iron buried in Antarctic ice
New research suggests that  Antarctic ice could be hiding a layer of iron-rich meteorites that have fallen to Earth over the past few centuries. Few space rocks that fall to Earth are made of iron, and since Antarctica is generally uninhabited, many of the rocks that land have never been acknowledged or recovered.
Based on modeling and experimentation, scientists now say that the rocks may be melting the ice as the sun’s natural light heats them, burying the meteorites deeper in the ice. “The study is proposing a hypothesis—these samples should be there. We just have to go and locate them,” said Katherine Joy from the University of Manchester, a co-author of the paper. 
“Every meteorite we find tells us something new about the Solar System,” Joy said, which is why it is very important that scientists recover the meteorites from the ice—they may learn something new about how our solar system formed or what kind of elements are present in meteors. The research was published in Nature Communications.

New images show remnants of ocean on Pluto’s moon
The surface of Charon, one of Pluto’s five moons, is cracked and fracturing, containing deep ridges, valleys, and chasms.
The moon may have once had a subsurface ocean that froze over, as suggested by new images from NASA’s New Horizons mission. From the images, scientists hypothesize that the ocean froze over and expanded, causing the moon’s surface to stretch and fracture on a massive scale.
Charon’s outer layer is primarily water ice, which was kept warm by the heat provided by radioactive decay when it was younger.Scientists say that Charon could have been warm enough for the ice to melt far below the surface, creating a subsurface ocean which would have frozen and expanded as Charon cooled down. This movement could have produced the massive chasms seen today on Charon.
The images were taken with the Long-Range Reconnaissance Imager (LORRI) on New Horizons in July 2015.

Warning: article contains spoilers
For those who have lasted the past seasons of Grey’s Anatomy and feel like they have the emotional endurance to undergo more of what seems like endless heartbreak, I salute you. I’m not sure if it is the looming midterms, or just the general life panic of a college junior that puts me in a vulnerable mental space, but last Thursday’s mid-season premiere of Grey’s Anatomy on ABC had me raising my eyebrows and saying, “of course,” with a sigh that was both weary and skeptical.
For the past 11 seasons, show producer and creator Shonda Rhimes has guided her beloved Grey’s Anatomy characters through personal tragedy after personal tragedy. These have included, but are not limited to: blossoming romances killed in infancy, multiple cases of Alzheimer’s, car crashes, plane crashes, shootings, near-drownings, serious cancer diagnoses, miscarriages, amputations, and runaway spouses. Even for other, less tragic reasons, beloved characters have walked off the series, much to the bereavement of some of the show’s most ardent fans.
This past Thursday’s mid-season premiere was no different in terms of emotional content; however, Grey’s Anatomy fans are speaking out against it. In this episode, titled “The Sound of Silence,” titular character Meredith Grey (Ellen Pompeo) is viciously attacked and assaulted by a car crash victim she is attempting to treat. 
In typical Grey’s Anatomy fashion, the other members of Rhimes’ diverse ensemble cast surround her bedside and rush to save her life, surrounded by the beeping noises and panic associated with only the most dire of Grey’s Anatomy emergencies.
This is repetitive not just for Grey’s Anatomy, but for Meredith Grey herself, who has suffered medical crises numerous times along with many other personal tragedies, the most recent of which was the death of her husband, Derek Shepherd (Patrick Dempsey). Frantic fans feel that poor Meredith Grey has experienced enough. 
Actress Ellen Pompeo, however, addressed these concerns on a “ShondaLand Revealed” podcast, saying “You don’t think you’re going to have to come up with 12 years of devastating things happening to one character. However, I look at the news every day and read newspapers online, and people have had some pretty unfortunate series of events happen to them in life. Things that you never think would happen. People being at two different mass shootings. Random, weird things do happen. Earth is quite an interesting place. So we can always suspend our disbelief enough to be able to tell some story and learn some lessons.”
Though it is nice to hear Ellen Pompeo recognize that her character has been dealt a bad hand, I can’t help but wonder what lessons viewers experience by watching her — and her castmates to an extent — get repeatedly battered week after week. Lessons can be learned from coping, that’s irrefutable, but most of this show becomes about coping with loss. Watching this show now involves holding your breath week to week, waiting for an inevitable crisis.
Part of me is seriously concerned that Rhimes has sacrificed conveying complex emotional lives for the more sure-fire and reliable emotional punch that these tragedies provide. As much as weeping during movies or television shows is therapeutic to me, I found myself questioning that on Thursday, thinking: does this alone make good television? How much more evidence of life’s impermanence do we need?
My impression, after having watched the episode, is that Grey’s Anatomy has perhaps reached the end of its tether as a show. Eleven seasons after its foundation, it seems that all the characters are working to move past a near continual set of tragedies. The show is still entertainment and, after all, that is its primary responsibility, but it’s hard to be willing to get very invested in a certain character only to have the rug pulled out from under them nearly constantly, and that ultimately diminishes the power of the stories these characters tell.
Rhimes shouldn’t be afraid to shake up the classic Grey’s Anatomy mold at this point. Change is difficult when there are such faithful fans, but it is worth a shot to save the show from floundering.
The mid-season premiere of Scandal and How To Get Away With Murder also aired Thursday night on ABC. These two shows, also run by Shonda Rhimes, both include a fantastic amount of tragedy. Though I’m not a Scandal fan, I am a huge HTGAWM fan, but unlike Grey’s Anatomy, the storyline only consists of characters avoiding conviction for crimes. Though in its infancy — this is HTGAWM’s second season — I worry that the show might eventually devolve into a caricature of itself, the way that the Rhimes-run medical drama has.
If Ellen Pompeo’s defense of Meredith Grey’s tragedy reminded me of anything, it’s that life includes great joys along with great horrors. And it seems that as Grey’s Anatomy progresses, the examination of these happinesses gets more and more cursory. But if life — and entertainment that seeks to explore, albeit in a fantastical way, the diversity of such a life — is an exercise in opposites, Grey’s Anatomy is very much weighted in the tragic direction, to the show’s detriment.

‘Twas Valentines’ Eve, and just off South Craig,
There was no food in the fridge, not even an egg,
Two ladies were pondering what they should have,
And with a quick search, they were off to Central Ave.
In the spirit of Parks and Rec’s beloved Leslie Knope, my roommate and I decided to have a great Galentine’s Day dinner together. The restaurant that caught my eye was an Ethiopian restaurant, entitled “Tana.” Immediately intrigued by the idea of trying of what the website promised to be “authentic cuisine” with “herbs and spices imported directly from Ethiopia,” I called and made a reservation for two.
Because it was well below freezing that night, we decided to take an Uber, and had little trouble finding the place. The restaurant is set up very simply. Tables with simple white tablecloths are positioned to line the plain white walls. There were some intriguing pieces of Ethiopian folk art put up, placed tastefully to cater to the minimalist feel of the establishment.
Ordering our meal was an interesting experience. Much to our surprise, we were told that we had the option of ordering two sides per dish, and the waiter suggested some vegetarian sides to go with our meaty mains. The distinct spices were very new to my South Asian palette. 
They were rich, loud, and well-complemented by the cooling sides. Like Indian food, Ethiopian food is meant to be eaten by hand, by using the carby component of the dish to make small pockets and scoop up the meat and vegetable components. Here’s a rundown of what we tried:
Denich Selata (Potato Salad): This was more mashed down than your typical potato salad, and was bursting with lively acidity from the vinegar and lime added to it. It refreshed the palate in between bites of the flavor-heavy mains, and was a great asset to the meal.
Kay Sir Selata (Beet Salad): I was very excited about this salad and very pleased with what arrived. It was cool, cleansing, and very well flavored. Simple, and delicious. Interestingly, the beets were crunchier than I expected, which added a some much needed texture to the otherwise very soft collection of food items.
Shiro Wat: This dish was an entree that was served to us in a smaller portion as a side. It consisted of roasted chickpeas that were ground up and seasoned. It too was simple, and balanced out the complexity of the other dishes.
Fossolia: The menu describes this as “green beans and carrots in Tana’s special tomato-based garlic and herb sauce.” The beans and carrots were cooked to a lovely softness, and the overall taste was sweet and garlicky all at once. My roommate loved this side the most out of all those we tried that night.
Doro Wat (Chicken): This dish had two sauce options: the Kay Wot (hot) in Berbere Sauce and Alicia Wot (mild) in Turmeric Sauce. We went for the hot sauce which turned out to be milder than expected. Nevertheless, the flavors were rich. 
There was quite a bit of salt in the dish, so if you’re not down with the sodium chloride scene, beware. The chicken arrives on the bone as a drumstick, and is covered in the dark sauce. It was a very unique taste experience.
Tana Tibs (Lamb): This dish was the hero of the night. The flavor of the lamb and the intensity of the Ethiopian spices came together harmoniously. The lamb, like the chicken, was cooked incredibly tenderly, and the flavor from the sauce had seeped into the meat, so no piece felt too dry or too bland. A must try.
Hot spiced tea: With my neverending quest to try all tea that I come across, seeing this on the menu made my heart sing. The tea seemed to be made from a mix of spices, of which clove was the most dominant. It complemented the food well, both because of its heat and its components. A sweeter tea would have broken the flow of flavor that all of the dishes contributed to. I would definitely order it again if given the chance.
Cha-ching: Tana takes both cash and card, and is good with splitting the check for groups.
Herbivores, Omnivores, and Carnivores, lend me your ears: Ethiopian food has great, healthy, protein-rich options for both vegetarians and non-vegetarians.
Are we there yet?: Tana is within walking distance from Target in East Liberty, and Market District on Centre Ave, so if you’re in the area, you won’t have to go too far. From campus, I would either take an Uber (given how cold it is outside), or if you’re willing to time your trip, the 71B from Fifth and Morewood, the 71C from Craig Street at Park Plaza, or the 75 from Ellsworth Ave at Morewood Ave. Here’s the address: 5929 Baum Blvd, Pittsburgh, PA 15206.
Click, click: Tana has a great website, with its menu, an about page, it’s location, catering information, and much more. Check it out: https://tanaethiopiancuisine.com/site/restaurants/tana-ethiopian-cuisine/
For those stay-at-home days: Tana has a takeout option, and you can order what you’d like online from their website. You do have to login and make an account to do this though. There is no home delivery option, unless, of course, you go through a third party delivery service.
Hours: 
Sun–Thu: 5–10 p.m.
Fri –  Sat: 11:30 a.m. – 2:30 p.m. for lunch and 5 p.m. – 11 p.m. for dinner
Here’s a number if you have any questions in regard to reservations, hours, the menu, etc: (412) 665-2770
21+: Tana offers a variety of Ethiopian beer and wine (not seen on the website), although their authentic Ethiopian coffee is much more famous.
Ambience: Relaxed, homely, very friendly. The waiters were very kind and happy to explain how to order the food, and gave great recommendations.
College student friendly?: I was surprised to see many college students, some who even looked like grad students. Most of the people seated in Tana came as fairly large groups, which was understandable after I realized how much food it took to fill me up. The portions are pretty big, so feel free to take the pack out for a feast.
Overall rating: 3.5 Melons

Romeo and Juliet may be his most famous, but Shakespeare’s ultimate tragic pair of star-crossed lovers are Antony and Cleopatra. Last weekend the Carnegie Mellon School of Drama staged a gripping re-imagining of the ancient tale of the powerful Roman general and enchanting Egyptian queen’s doomed love affair and placed it firmly within the racial tensions of present-day America. 
Adapted and directed by John Wells Directing Fellow Eleanor Bishop and senior acting major Chante Adams, who also portrayed Cleopatra, Antony and Cleopatra blended Shakespeare’s Elizabethan text with the words of black performers, thinkers, and activists to present a piece that dialogued with mixed issues of race and feminism. 
Featuring a strong ensemble cast that included junior musical theatre major Joseph Essig as Antony and junior musical theatre major Henry Ayres-Brown as Antony’s rival for the emperor’s throne, Caesar, Antony and Cleopatra showcased the unique strengths of the school’s Studio 201 space on North Braddock avenue in Point Breeze and left audiences with plenty to ponder on the drive home.
Bishop and Adams’s adaptation did much to reorient the focus of the piece on Cleopatra herself, diluting Antony’s significance to a reference point for the piece’s commentary on interracial relationships. Cleopatra’s identity is established as exotic and “other” as the Egypt she rules when compared to the strict, white-bread world of Antony’s native Rome. 
Antony’s brief, politically motivated marriage to Caesar’s sister Octavia, played by senior acting major Cara Ronzetti, is mashed up with commentary from rapper Azealia Banks on white appropriation of hip-hop music and culture as well as the July Twitter exchange between Nicki Minaj and Taylor Swift over the former’s claim that the Video Music Awards nominations favored white female performers over black ones. 
Cleopatra’s slight becomes the slight of all black performers constantly suppressed by a culture that values their contribution but prefers they stay out of sight in favor of the “girl next door.” 
Another stirring combination came at the piece’s climax, with Cleopatra’s capture by Caesar playing out amidst a live performance of the audio taken from the violent arrest of Sandra Bland in July of last year over a moving violation. Bland was later found dead of apparent suicide in her jail cell, and Cleopatra’s suicide becomes the defiant stand of a culture decrying death before submission.
Compared to the grand proscenium of the Chosky Theater in Purnell, the Studio 201 space is immediate, and its bare-bones warehouse aesthetic gives the piece a gritty feel. The set is themed to give the impression the piece is a filming set for “Caesar productions,” and the action of the show was frequently interrupted by cries of “cut” or camera changes. 
Monitors flanking the stage depicted the star-making view of the camera, which at times depicted Cleopatra and Antony as camera-hungry lovers à la Jay-Z and Beyoncé, and other times recast Octavia’s betrothal to Antony as a sexually-charged Taylor Swift music video. The production made smart use of multimedia to add extra layers to the fabric of the piece, leaving no stone unturned in the presentation of its discussion.
The cast was small, eight players in all, so each had to pull extra weight in playing multiple roles. Senior acting major Wesley Jones gave exuberant life to everyone from a Kanye West-inspired Pompey to Cleopatra’s servant Alexas and junior musical theatre major Arica Jackson inhabited Cleopatra’s servant Charmian as well as multiple voices on a Eugene Lang college panel, “Are You Still a Slave? Liberating the Black Female Body,” among others. It was ensemble acting at its finest.
Amidst headlines pronouncing massive protests in the wake of Beyoncé’s Super Bowl performance of “Formation” and the racial themes of its music video, the School of Drama’s adaptation of Antony and Cleopatra touched on discussions that are seeing mainstream sunlight. 
Adams concluded the piece with a painfully honest confession delivered directly to the audience, in which she revealed a childhood wish that she was a skinny white girl named Michelle. She faced the audience and admitted, to a mostly white audience, that she was taught to love them, but had to learn to love herself.
Antony and Cleopatra succeeded in its multi-textual approach to constructing a dynamic discussion on themes of race and feminism in modern America, and fits nicely in the School’s great season thus far.

Walking into The Frick Museum of Pittsburgh is like being transported to another time. The converted 19th century mansion of Henry Clay Frick and his family now houses Fast Cars and Femmes Fatales, a collection of photographs originally taken by Frenchman Jacque Henri Lartigue in the early 1900s. While these photographs can be described as domestic, the life of the Lartigue family had no shortage of action to be captured.
Lartigue was born into a privileged family in 1894 and began taking photographs at the age of six, the same time that the infamous Kodak Brownie camera entered the market, making photography accessible to amateurs and children. He quickly outgrew the smaller, mass-market cameras, and since money was no object for his family, he soon had a full-sized view camera of his own to create images of beautiful quality.
The exhibition displays images from 1907-1958, beginning with some of the boyhood images that were made famous by Charles Rado of the Rapho agency in 1963 when Lartigue was 69. Given that Lartigue was still a child when he took the images, the photographs are strikingly beautiful. What makes these prints from a glass plate negative particularly compelling is that they were created not by a meticulous and practiced professional but by a child.
Lartigue’s father often lent him his camera to use, and the image produced by a view camera with glass plate negatives has a unique quality that is said to transcend even the high resolution of today’s digital cameras. An image of Lartigue’s father driving 55 mph in one of his many cars is blurry because of the motion, but this enhances the image’s accessibility to the viewer. Without the formality of a well-composed photograph, the viewer feels personally invited into the exciting events of Lartigue’s life.
Soon after the boyhood images, the exhibit presents a series of fashion photographs taken in Paris. The hats alone are stunning, and the posture of the actresses and fashionistas radiates confidence. They likely set a precedent for one of the most prominent street photographers of the era, Henri Cartier-Bresson. While Cartier-Bresson’s images were grittier and more representative of the city as a whole, Lartigue’s shots were a study of a microcosm of opulence, celebrity, and beauty.
We also get a glimpse of the Grand Prix of 1913 with racecar driver Dario Resta. One image shows us the perspective from the headlights to the driver’s seat with the long expanse of engine in between. Lartigue also had fun with the audience, capturing a moment where women and men are lounging by the side of the track, in a posture suggesting complete boredom.
His satirical eye is also apparent through many images of the exhibition. One image in particular can elicit a genuine belly laugh in the middle of a generally quiet exhibition hall, so be careful. This image is of a friend, Sascha, whom is pictured getting slammed in the head by a wave. 
This photograph is amazing because, in order to get it, Lartigue had to have brought a 5x7 inch view camera (picture one of those old time cameras with the accordion-looking bellows) into the ocean. After the initial visual impact, you notice the image is titled, “Sascha’s only swim.” These moments of humor are scattered throughout the show, displaying the artist’s playful side.
The women of Lartigue’s life are also represented in the show. The only two color images shown are of Bibi, Lartigue’s first wife. A subsequent series of pictures showcase Lartigue’s two other wives — both of whom are young, beautiful, and fashionable. Their expressions are as practiced as those of models, and the clothing and jewelry makes one suspect that these are photographs from Vogue magazine.
The last, and arguably most famous, series of photographs is a collection on Pablo Picasso, from a time when he and Lartigue were spending time together in Paris. They are rare and intimate photos of the painter in the later years of life.
Lartigue was a painter and photographer that liked to shoot slice-of-life pictures: intimate moments of his family and friends, sporting events like tennis and racecar driving, or outings to the aviation field. His “day-to-day” life consists of almost unbelievable adventure. The photographs’ informal nature and satirical bent combined with their skillful execution invite the viewer to experience France in the early 20th century for themselves.

Trigger Warning: Discussion of sexual assault and suicide
“What do you offer your friends to make them so supportive?” The stage lights come up and the lone woman on the stage plays this refrain from her smartphone. Standing on a coffee table she rotates slowly so that each side of the audience can hear the phrase as it repeats. “What do you offer your friends to make them so supportive?”
This weekend, 4.48 Psychosis, a hauntingly poetic play written by British playwright Sarah Kane opened in the John Wells Studio, the smallest theater space on the first floor of the Purnell Center for the Arts. The play, written as a stream-of-consciousness epic poem without any discernible characters or plot, was brought to life in starkly intimate detail by senior directing student John Moriarty, and intensely performed by junior acting student Mckenna Slone and senior acting student Zach Fifer. With a set created by scenic design senior, Nathan Brown, the audience is allowed to look in on a few days, months, or years of one woman’s struggle with depression.
4.48 Psychosis was first produced by the Royal Court Jerwood Theatre Upstairs in London in June 2000. This was the last work of Kane’s, who, after a life-long battle with depression, hung herself with shoelaces in her hospital room a year before her play would be produced. This current production was influenced and shaped heavily by the real life experiences of Carnegie Mellon students through the Sarah Project, an initiative aimed at discussing issues of mental health through art.
From the moment the audience approaches the door to the studio, it is clear that production has taken a lot of care in engaging with material that can be mentally taxing on audiences. Outside the theater are posted several notices that warn patrons to practice self-care while watching the show. The notices also provide trigger warnings of sexual assault and suicide. These details, along with a message from CaPS on the door (echoed in an insert in the program), are indicative of these artists’ understanding of the play and its potential to take an emotional toll.
The play starts in darkness, and indeed in darkness is where Moriarty’s direction is the most effective. In darkness and silence we hear Ali Miller (Slone) enter her apartment and in darkness we hear her rape occur. This series of actions sets the tone for the 100-minute show as we see Ali struggle with the aftermath of her assault, both alone and with her doctor played by Fifer. There is so much that Moriarty’s production gets right depicting serious depression and the toll it takes on people. He not only touches on the sadness, but also on the anger that anyone who has struggled with depression or who has loved someone with depression is all too familiar with. At one point Ali echoes this feeling outright, “Depression is anger; it’s what you did, who was there, and what you’re blaming.” The credit goes as much to Slone, who is able to believably portray catatonic quiet and incurable rage with equal enthusiasm.
Brown’s set also contributes greatly to the experience closing the distance between audience and performer with his catwalk set. Ali’s apartment spans across the studio with audience sitting on either side. On one end of the set her bed and posters of various historical and fictional women like Audrey Hepburn, Marilyn Monroe, and Daenerys Targaryen. In the center, a desk with two cushions, and on the other side a door and several cork boards hung with bits of this and that, most notably a Carnegie Mellon flag. The effect makes it so that as an audience member you are watching other audience members as much as you are watching the action on stage. And as Ali makes several attempts throughout the show to connect with the audience members, at one pointing showing them a scribbled page from her diary and at various points making direct eye contact with people, the other side becomes a mirror equally implicit to Ali’s suffering and equally silent. The point is driven home when Ali pulls out a sweatshirt from Pi Kappa Alpha, a fraternity on Carnegie Mellon’s campus. She could be any number of survivors walking by on our campus, reminding the audience that by doing nothing to stop the dangerous culture of sexual assault on campus we are almost as culpable as the attackers themselves.
While the play got so much right, as with art that attempts to grapple with complex issues, 4.48 falters in some respects. Fifer, though incredible in presence, isn’t really given much to do or say that wouldn’t have been just as organic coming from the mouth of Ali. Similarly, the way his relationship turns from professional to sexual and then to professional again sends some potentially harmful messages about how assault survivors can begin to heal. After an extended sex scene between the two characters, Slone’s Ali seems much more positive and only sets on the path to kill herself again when he then rejects her. This feels like the production is putting the healing of mental illness on the onus of the person’s loved ones, when anyone who’s had experience with this knows that mental illness can’t be loved away. Healing is an incredibly individualistic journey that loved ones can only support. It is worth mentioning however that the lead up to this sex scene was one of the best examples I’ve seen of using consent to initiate sexual contact. Multiple times we see Ali’s hand rest on an article of the doctor’s clothing, making eye contact with him and only removing the article after he nods yes.
4.48 Psychosis was an intense delve into one person’s struggle with depression. The production, and whatever else comes from the Sarah Project, is a welcome addition to a campus like Carnegie Mellon, where issues like sexual assault and mental illness are still ignored by much of the campus community.

This past Monday, Feb. 15, I was able to witness the sheer splendor that was The Vagina Monologues, produced and performed by members of Carnegie Mellon’s Mobilization of Resolute Feminists (MORF) organization and directed by senior science and humanities scholar, Sophie Zucker. This social-experiment-turned-production is one of my favorites, and while it may be “the classic ‘college feminist’ production,” according to the show’s pamphlet, I truly believe it’s an important piece for one to experience. As a cisgender male, I will never be able to actually perform in this production, but I can sure watch and listen to it whenever I get the chance.
There were several amazing moments in this production. Staged in the Cohon Center’s Peter/Wright/McKenna rooms, with just a row of wrinkly red curtains as a backdrop, no lighting other than the overhead fluorescents, and a room not quite conducive to vocal projection, the show appeared at face-value to be a little under-budget. But consider for a moment that only two years ago, MORF had only three members and was just getting off its feet at this university. Since this organization’s number one mission is not theatre, but the advancement of woman’s rights and freedoms, any critical reader should step back and realize how fantastic this production actually was. 
The namesake “Vagina Monologues” transcend the stage on which they are performed. They are a written chorus of voices, and in line with that, it’s rather lovely how spare the setting was. The Vagina Monologues are a set of spoken pieces which were 
the product of their author, Eve Ensler’s, mission to interview women about their vaginas. The result is a powerful and hysterical production.
Moving onto the actual performance, the scene was set by junior dramaturg Margaret Marchese, graduate music student Katie Russell, and junior architecture major Victoria Yong, who recited the monologues’s introduction. The trio did a wonderful job at conveying their collective “worry” about vaginas, and their comedic timing when describing the various nicknames women had for their vaginas (the best of which being “poopi,” “poopelu,” and “Gladys Seagelman”) was lovely. Through the entirety of this production, each participant held note cards, which for any other production would be a travesty, but for this production, the note cards were apparently mandated by the monologues’ directing rules, which state that one must perform them with a script of some kind to remind the audience that the stories were taken from real women across the world, not simply the lone actress’s experiences.
The performance began with Hair, performed by sophomore English, history, and chemistry major, Karishma Manglani. Manglani held a very nice tone throughout; as she recited this monologue, she hit on some of the deeply emotional aspects. She was vulnerable when she needed to be, when reciting the portion about being forcefully shaved by her husband, and overall, her portrayal of this monologue’s voice was very nicely done. This monologue strikes a chord in anyone who has been told to change to “please” his or her spouse, and it tackles a rather prevalent idea that women must shave to be attractive.
The Wear and Say Lists, performed by sophomore statistics major Lilian Chin, philosophy and psychology senior Naomi Berman, and drama sophomore Kate Burgess, is one of my favorite portions of this show. It’s all about asking women what their vaginas would say and wear if they were capable of coherent speech and could actually dress up. My favorite options are always “something machine washable,” “lace and combat boots,” and “an electrical shock device to keep unwanted strangers away” for the question of “what would [your vagina] wear,” and “remember me?” and “come inside” for the question of “what would [your vagina] say?”
One of the most poignant pieces from this production was The Little Coochie Snorcher That Could, performed by junior science and humanities scholar Alexandria Moriarty. This monologue details a girl’s evolution of vaginal experience, from accidentally impaling her vagina on a bedpost, to being sexually assaulted, to finally being sexually enlightened by a self-empowered feminist woman. It was a very well done performance, and though Moriarty kept using the word “coochie snorcher,” the seriousness of the content and the overall solemn excitement of much of this piece was kept in-tact and respected.
Out of all of the monologues, three of them really stood out to me performance-wise. Out of the many monologues, I have always been partial to The Flood, which is my absolute favorite, about an old woman who had never had sex because she would always get a little too excited. I also love My Angry Vagina and The Woman Who Loved to Make Vaginas Happy, especially in this production.
The Flood, performed by junior creative writing and philosophy student Ariel Hoffmaier, is always my clear favorite, just because I adore the character of this monologue, and if I were at all able to perform it, I would. Hoffmaier is naturally a beautiful fit for the role of an old Jewish woman, and her portrayal was pretty much spot-on to how I pictured this scene unfolding in my head. I particularly love the portion where the woman talks about her dreams about partying with Burt Reynolds, and how they were so happy, until she would inevitably flood the whole restaurant with her excitement.
My Angry Vagina is a great piece. Performed by Heather Graci, a freshman in Dietrich College, this monologue tackles the discomfort of examination and artificial vagina care products, such as tampons and freshening products. Graci’s acting was lovely and hysterical; she really understood the furious comedy of the piece and was able to deliver a humorous and striking performance.
The Woman Who Loved to Make Vaginas Happy, performed by sophomore music student Jacqueline Tardanico, seemed to be far and away the crowd’s favorite performance. Tardanico committed to this role. This monologue describes a woman who used to be a lawyer, but is now a lesbian sex worker, who loves making women moan. This monologue, when spoken, has a wide range of possibilities; around the final portion of the monologue is a list of moan types, and with each one, Tardanico actually got onto the floor and acted out each of them. In detail. She had obviously done her research because her moans were spot-on and spectacular. Needless to say, the audience was living for her beautiful, howling rendition of a lesbian sex worker pleasuring her moaning partners.
The Vagina Monologues is such a powerful exhibition of womanhood and female pride that its got me wishing that, if only for a second, I too could be proud of my vagina.

I believe we’re approaching what the internet likes to call ‘Peak Superhero.’ Studios have realized what makes them the most money, and everyone seems to be in a rush to make as many superhero movies as they can. After the success of films like The Avengers and Iron Man, Hollywood is looking for the proverbial ‘next big movie;’ everyone is trying to replicate that success to get a piece of the pie. With an increasing number of these movies each year, the bubble is likely to burst at some point. Now, being a hard-core superhero and comic book fan, I’m not one to complain. These movies bring with them a lot of hype with the relentless marketing campaigns. I personally savor the wait, reading up on fan theories, learning more and more about the film (avoiding spoilers, of course), and finally leading up to the night I go see it. That’s the fun of it!
Among this sea of upcoming superhero movies, Deadpool arrives. Not only does it make a huge splash, but it turns the water around it red. If you’re a superhero movie fan like me, you should probably be wondering where you’ve heard of ‘Deadpool’ before. That’s right, the character has been on the big screen before, in X-Men Origins: Wolverine. If you’ve seen that movie, you know they (spoiler alert) literally sew his mouth shut in the latter half. So the character lovingly called the Merc with the Mouth has no mouth and cannot speak. Great. Luckily for us, not this time. Fox has let their filmmakers go completely wild, and they have more than redeemed themselves after destroying the character in Origins.
The actual plot of the movie is a standard superhero origin story. Wade Wilson finds out he has terminal cancer, and gets a very special therapy for his cancer, which activates his mutant healing abilities but, to quote from the movie, leaves him looking “like an avocado had sex with an older avocado” and thus unfit to mingle with general society. So he dons a red suit (think Spider-Man meets a ninja) and goes around killing a bunch of people who get in his way. You may be wondering why the red suit? I’ll let the movie answer that, and if you don’t get that reference, please go see the trailers.
The magic of the movie is the fun Ryan Reynolds and filmmakers have had with it. In true Deadpool fashion, the ridiculous gags and demented commentary keep coming, turning the otherwise conventional story completely sideways. Wade Wilson is unglued, and because he is so unglued, he has a tendency to break the fourth wall and speak to the audience. He knows he’s a fictional character! This hyper awareness is classic Deadpool and makes him the perfect medicine to our superhero fatigue. It’s a superhero movie about a guy who doesn’t want to be one.
It’s a superhero movie with nudity and ultra-violence. An R-rated superhero movie? Aren’t these movies meant for kids? Deadpool not only isn’t meant for kids, but the squeamish might have a few gasp­— did that just happen — moments. And surprisingly, despite the insanity, the movie manages to have a romantic backstory that actually just about works, thanks to Ryan Reynolds’ and Morena Baccarin’s sizzling chemistry.
Deadpool makes extensive use of CGI and ‘bullet-timey’ slow motion stunts, but it works perfectly with the general zaniness of the movie. They made this on a (relatively) low budget and what they’ve done with what they had is quite amazing. The opening scene itself is testament to that. The first 20 minutes of the movie are some of the best, and make sure you don’t text during the opening or the closing credits. Also, there are post-credits scenes. Two of them. Do not leave without seeing them.
Deadpool is a celebration of ultra-violence, sexual innuendos, and all around insanity. If you haven’t seen the trailers, go see them NOW. Wait a few hours, let your brain marinate in the awesomeness of what you just saw, and then go see the movie before it’s pulled from the theaters. Oh, and remember to take ID. The movie is rated R, and for good reason.

The Kurt Giessler Foundation for Youth Achievement is an organization that supports young scholars between the ages of 12 and 20 and allows them to pursue their educational interests through the provision of grants. The grants are used towards funding self-directed educational projects that can take on a myriad of different educational foci that include, but are not limited to, undertakings of an inventive, entrepreneurial, or charitable nature. The catch: none of the projects can be school related and must be strictly independent of any influence from the classroom.
Kurt Giessler, a Carnegie Mellon alumnus, is remembered as an outstanding and influential individual who impacted those around him through his zest for life and optimism. Giessler was born in 1980 in Plymouth, Massachusetts. Early on in his life, he faced multiple medical complications that caused him to receive reconstructive heart surgery as well as two double lung transplants in 2001 and 2007. Despite the physical drawbacks he experienced due to his medical issues, Giessler applied himself in all other ways possible and developed a fervent passion towards his education. Giessler “knew his days were numbered and, rather than cower from his fate, he extended himself as much as possible,” remarked his good friend, Phi Kappa Theta fraternity brother and organizer of the Kurt Giessler Memorial, Igino Cafiero (CIT ‘06). “He always tried to say yes, and lived very deliberately,” Cafiero said.
At Carnegie Mellon University, Giessler majored in mechanical engineering and was highly involved in math and the sciences. His older sister, Kristen Giessler, served as his Orientation Counselor in his freshman year at the University, an experience on which she reflected with fond memories. Upon graduation, he moved back to Massachusetts, where his inextinguishable excitement for education led him to become a high school engineering teacher. Giessler believed that, “there is no greater determinant of one’s quality of life than their education,” which is quoted on the banner of the foundation’s website. Through this belief and his contagious enthusiasm, he was able to impact his students by encouraging them to explore beyond the walls of the classroom and develop their own unique educational interests. The idea for the Kurt Giessler Foundation first arose when in 2010, Kurt learned that his chronic lung rejection had resurfaced and that there were no alternative solutions to cure him. The Foundation was launched with the support of Giessler’s sister, Kristen Giessler, and their parents after his passing. The website clearly defines Kurt’s mission as aiming to “support youth in generating and achieving long term ventures by providing the resources necessary to reach those goals and creating a reward system that acknowledges those who succeed.” With the support of friends, family, and other individuals who believe in Giessler’s cause, the organization is “strictly run by volunteers, seasoned professionals, and educated young adults,” as stated on the website.
Alex Hanna (CIT ‘10), organizer of the Deloitte campaign which raised thousands of dollars for the foundation, and Cafiero are two individuals who were a part of the Carnegie Mellon University community and whose lives were touched by the influence of Giessler. Giessler was just a few years older than Hanna and had just graduated with his mechanical engineering degree when he began school in Pittsburgh. He first got involved with the Kurt Giessler Foundation a few years back when he participated as a contributor in an annual fundraising event hosted by Phi Kappa Theta alumni. Since then, he has coordinated donations to help raise money for the foundation as well as contributing to the grant selection process for prospective recipients.
Hanna remembers Kurt as someone who, “carried a sense of charisma that made you feel as if you were the only person in the room when talking to him. I’ll never forget his eternal optimism. No matter the situation, his calming presence and soothing smirk always let me know that it would be alright,” Hanna said.
Cafiero describes Giessler as “a man of principle with seemingly infinite patience and a quick sense of humor.” Cafiero also contributes to the foundation through fundraising efforts from the west coast. He described the annual event as an opportunity that allows anyone who knew Giessler and other Carnegie Mellon alumni to, “spend time together … and laugh and talk about Kurt as if he were among us.”
Grant recipients are chosen through the foundation’s application process, for which they have to answer two questions: “How will this initiative benefit you as an individual?” and “How will this initiative benefit society?” 
Students who are selected can receive upwards of $2000 in grant money for their respective projects. The grants allow the foundation to achieve Kurt’s purpose for creating it in the first place, which is to, in his own words, “challenge the youth of tomorrow, to fund their projects, and to reward them for success.”
For example, Kevin Johnson was an 18 year old when he was selected in 2015 for his idea to develop an advanced wireless theatrical light control system called LightMate, for which he received a $2,100 grant. When his application was selected by the foundation, he had created prototypes to prove that his idea was plausible, and had already evaluated what he could do to continue developing his project. Katie Curran is another example of a student who was awarded $1,000 as a part of the foundation’s Prize for Achievement for her accomplishments with Project Next Generation. According to the website, the award is meant to “recognize individuals who are already making an impact on their community.” Curran’s Project Next Generation is a volunteer and leadership education organization that was created with the intention of, “[inspiring] the rising generation of young leaders to be actively involved in their community,” as stated in her nomination letter.
There are a number of different ways that we can continue Kurt Giessler’s legacy on the Carnegie Mellon campus. The foundation is constantly looking for qualified applicants. Members of the Carnegie Mellon University community can reach out to local Pittsburgh high schools that may need funding for engineering or robotics programs, or refer prospective applicants to members of the foundation. Anything, even simple contributions in the form of small donations, can be helpful to remembering Giessler and supporting the cause that he held so dear to his heart.

Ask a doctor when he or she reached the breaking point in life, and chances are, the response you’ll get is "medical school." Memorizing large quantities of information can sometimes be an insurmountable hurdle for students in a number of fields. Often times, online resources focus on teaching elementary topics and cannot accommodate the learning strategies required for higher education. Luckily, some bright minds in the online-education sphere are working to create innovative solutions to this problem.
Carnegie Mellon alumna Tria Chang (Professional Writing & Communication Design, 2007) currently works as the Director of Content at Memorang, an educational startup company that focuses on “leveling the playing field” for students of higher education. Memorang purports to be a high-quality educational tool that costs less than traditional online-learning websites. The website promotes open learning by offering free tools and material that is user-generated, as well as expert-created content with a subscription plan.
"Students in higher education need the most help." said Yermie Cohen, the CEO of the San Francisco-based startup. Cohen co-founded the company in 2013, and holds Bachelor's degrees in Biology and Mechanical Engineering from MIT. While in medical school at UCLA, Yermie struggled with the switch from problem-solving in college to memorization. He faced the same challenge that confronts many students at institutions of higher learning: study tools designed to work for high school tests were simply ineffective. 
Sensing the need for a service to fulfill this niche, he approached fellow MIT graduate George Courtsunis to create Memorang. Today, the partners work with Tria, software engineers, and a team of content experts to continuously build and update their service. Getting to where they are now, though, was no walk in the park. 
Cohen had some words of advice for those seeking to start their own companies. He said that it is crucial for individuals to "find the strength to pull through, and to do what it takes." In his case, Cohen had to learn to program from scratch. "Learning new skills" is all part of the process, he said.
To say that his efforts have been successful would be an understatement. Memorang has scaled massively in the last few years, with paying subscribers in sixty countries and users having collectively answered 30 million questions. Already, about one in three medical students use Memorang to study for the MCATs, the U.S. Medical Licensing Exam (USMLE), and board exams. 
While many of the students are in medical studies, the website also caters to other types of standardized tests, such as the GRE, and is working towards covering fields such as finance with CPA exam prep. The website is even used by individuals diagnosed with ADHD and learning disabilities, as it uses repetitive teaching styles that solidly anchor material in the mind.
The website offers flashcards and multiple choice questions among an array of other studying techniques. Users can also import materials from other websites, such as Quizlet or StudyBlue. With a subscription, the website offers expert-developed learning tools that are designed specifically to improve information retention. Memorang uses a special technique called spaced repetition to help students concentrate on the topics that are challenging for them. The study time is broken up into sessions that take into account the demanding schedules of many students. 
The website implements learning strategies developed by professionals with expertise in a variety of subjects, from educational psychology to big data analytics and even rocket science. Content experts work to create material that has a real impact. 
In 2014, Memorang was implemented in a study at UCLA. A group of 20 students who had failed their diagnostic medical board exams used the service for six to eight weeks, and saw remarkable results. Their scores improved by an entire standard deviation, with a passing rate of 100 percent.
With initial successes among medical and other graduate-level students, Memorang has plans to expand even further. Beyond helping students in higher learning, Cohen sees the tool as something that can be used by students of all ages. A new version of the service, called Memorang 2.0, was released this past week and includes games and other user-friendly interfaces to help students of all ages grasp concepts. Cohen himself is a true believer in the virtues of his creation, and uses it himself to study for medical exams. After all, he said, the goal is "to build a tool that works." Cohen added that the purpose of the company is to provide help that he wishes he had as a student.
Memorang has potential for implementation here at Carnegie Mellon. With a large graduate student body attending the Mellon College of Science, Carnegie Mellon fits Memorang’s target demographic. The service can help a great number of students study for those all-important standardized exams, whether for medical school or other higher education programs. As a tool designed specifically for students of higher education, Memorang may very soon become a commonly used name on campus.

Last Thursday, Carnegie Mellon University hosted Norman Naimark, the Robert and Florence McDonnell Professor of Eastern European Studies at Stanford University, to discuss his opinions on the definitions of war and genocide. Titled “Horses of the Apocalypse,” his lecture addressed various brutal acts of murder and explained why he believed they did or did not qualify as genocide.
Norman Naimark is considered one of the leading experts of today when it comes to the topic of genocide and ethnic cleansing. He was invited to Carnegie Mellon as part of the series of lectures on war and the humanities, an effort by Carnegie Mellon to promote discussion on the atrocities of war and their effects on the world today.
To begin his lecture, Naimark reminded the audience of a striking image, one that many have heard of before: the four horsemen of the apocalypse. Harbingers of doom and biblical representations of the worst things to happen to the human race, the four horsemen (War, Conquest, Famine, and Death) all take part in the cause of genocide. Naimark’s main argument was that where War goes, genocide follows near after. The two are closely linked, so closely that it is very rare to find an example of genocide that does not take place during a time of war. These four horsemen are the embodiment of the greatest fears of mankind and, as Naimark remarked, even today “the four horsemen haunt modern man.”
Although the term genocide has only been defined fairly recently, Naimark said that “genocide is not a side phenomenon of human history, but part and parcel.” He reminded the audience of Joshua and the battle of Jericho, where Joshua prevented the city of Jericho from being built again at the cost of the children of the people from Jericho, effectively an ancient genocide. While we may think of genocide being solely linked to the twentieth century, people have continuously attempted to annihilate their enemies completely since the beginning of time — and, according to Naimark, will probably continue to do so in the future.
Naimark next discussed a type of genocide that is often overlooked in his discussion of mass murders based on race, a type of violence that Naimark has christened “communist genocide.” Examples of communist genocide include the starvation of the Ukrainians by the Soviet regime under Josef Stalin, the Cambodian genocide led by Pol Pot and the Khmer Rouge, and the atrocities committed by Mao Zedong in his Great Leap Forward. As with almost any mass killing, applying the title of genocide has been met with contention among most of these examples. Naimark is of the opinion that although some of these have not been recognized, they are genocides due to their attempt at extermination of a race of people. In the case of the Ukrainian genocide, many ignore it because it wasn’t a direct killing. It is harder to pinpoint starvation as an active form of killing people, yet it causes death just as surely as the gas chambers of Auschwitz.
Norman Naimark next showed why genocide is often found within wars. Perhaps the most influential part of war is that “war habituates people to killing.” When acts of violence are a part of ones everyday life, it is harder to discern acts of war and acts of genocide. From a modern perspective, it is common for people to study history and ask “how could people commit these atrocities?” Naimark argued that if we examine the context of violence and hate often surrounding these genocides, it becomes clear that people were desensitized to killing and hatred.
In conclusion, Naimark asked the audience to consider the future. The study of history is pointless if we do not learn from its lessons, and the lessons we learn from genocides are the most important of all. He posed a question to the audience: “Has mankind been cleansed by our tribulation?” 
The circumstances surrounding genocide have not left us. After every one of these incidents, the world has been poised to say “never again,” yet these horrors continue to occur. Naimark left the audience with a somewhat ominous message: “The horsemen have not been satiated, and they continue to threaten the Earth.”
Naimark is an expert in the study of genocide and war, and has written several books on the topics such as Stalin’s Genocides, and Fires Of Hatred: Ethnic Cleansing In 20th Century Europe.

This past week at Heinz College, U.S. Representative Tim Murphy of the 18th congressional district of Pennsylvania spoke about his recent bill, the Helping Families in Mental Health Crisis Act of 2015. Describing the alarming state of mental health issues in America today, Murphy demonstrated that our current laws are inadequate in terms of providing a solution.
Currently, Murphy is the only practicing mental health professional in elected government and one of only a handful in government with a background in healthcare. He pointed out that 60 million Americans a year are diagnosed with some type of mental illness, ranging from very mild and transient cases to severe disorders like schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and major depression. Of the approximately 10 million people with severe mental illness, around four million do not get treatment, or even recognize that they have mental illness.
Emphasizing that severe mental illness is a brain disorder and “not an attitude,” Murphy spoke about misguided views on the causes of mental illness that were thought to be true not too long ago, such as blaming schizophrenia on the “schizophrenogenic mother” or autism on “refrigerator parents.” Despite the fact that we’ve now realized how baseless these claims are through the discovery of genetic markers, Murphy said that “a lot of what we’ve been doing in the mental health field hasn’t really changed much for the last century or so.”
To illustrate his point, Murphy referred to the 19th century American activist Dorothea Dix. Dix sympathized with the brutal treatment and imprisonment of numerous mentally ill people, and subsequently created America’s first psychiatric hospitals. Initially serving as places of rest where the mentally ill could get better, psychiatric hospitals “became places where we dumped people [when] we didn’t want to see them,” Murphy said. “We’d send people to the ‘funny farm,’ the ‘loony bin,’ the ‘cuckoo’s nest.’”
As World War II ensued and doctors and nurses were called away to the fight, psychiatric hospitals employed many people who had minimal training, while becoming more and more packed. “Institutions that were there perhaps to house originally a few hundred, became the homes of a few thousand,” Murphy said. In the 1960s and 70s, after a civil rights movement for mental health, two sides emerged. While some people believed too much money was being spent on mental health, others fought for patients’ rights, recognizing the struggle of people who could be easily put away by relatives signing a form and were held captive in psychiatric institutions where abuse and neglect were rampant. Eventually, in the 1980s and 90s, many mental institutions were closed in response to both sides.
In part, the development of medications and psychotherapy did effectively treat some people and reduce the number of those who needed psychiatric help. However, another aspect of the decline of psychiatric hospitals was the subsequent increase in prisons. As more people were let out of mental institutions, some with severe disorders committed crimes. Some, who couldn’t take care of themselves, became homeless. And some were sent to the emergency room where, if there wasn’t enough space and they were too problematic, they were chemically sedated and fully strapped to a gurney, referred to as a “five point tie down.” All of these situations still happen today. Murphy said, “I look upon that and say, ‘What are we doing? Have we really advanced since the 1800s?’ And I believe we have not.”
“We’ve replaced the hospital bed with the prison cell, the blanket on the subway grate, the emergency room, and lastly, the county morgue,” Murphy said. The scale of mental illness-related deaths in America is “staggering,” as described by Murphy. Last year, there were 41,000 suicide deaths and 1.2 million attempts serious enough to require medical attention. 45,000 deaths were from drug overdoses, with many more near misses, and in Los Angeles, it’s estimated that one homeless person dies every day.
“A person with severe mental illness tends to die 10 to 25 years sooner than the rest of the population,” Murphy said, possibly due to medical complications that arise when those who need treatment don’t receive it. Though we don’t know the exact number of mental-illness related deaths, Murphy said that even the most conservative estimate of 85,000 mental illness-related deaths exceeds the total number of combat deaths in the Korean and Vietnam wars combined. Murphy pointed out that in any other case, for example, “if the flu swept through the country and caused 85,000 deaths” we would all be greatly concerned.
Murphy’s bill, the Helping Families in Mental Health Crisis Act of 2015, focuses on breaking down barriers that prevent those with mental illness from receiving treatment. 
A federal investigation initiated after the tragic shooting incident at Sandy Hook Elementary School found numerous flaws in our current system in dealing with mental health. Some notable aspects of the bill deal with modifying privacy rules for physicians that prevent family members from helping their loved ones, increasing the number of psychiatric beds nationwide (currently short by 100,000), increasing the mental health workforce, and refocusing mental health related programs. “We have to change and transform how this country is dealing with mental illness,” Murphy said.
To those who are concerned about the monetary cost imposed by the bill, Murphy responds that the cost of not doing anything is “85,000 lives. How much of a price do you put on each of those lives?” As for concerns about patient’s rights being affected by the bill, Murphy believes that a patient’s right to get well outweighs their right to stay sick. Referring to the tragedy at Sandy Hook that was committed by Adam Lanza, a man plagued with significant mental health issues according to a state investigation, Murphy said, “Those children at Sandy Hook Elementary School had the right to make it through first grade.”

Carnegie Mellon settles its 2009 lawsuit with Marvell on determining data storage
This past week it was announced that Carnegie Mellon University was able to settle its 2009 patent infringement lawsuit against Marvell Technology Group Ltd. and Marvell Semiconductor Inc. As decided from this settlement, the inventors, José Moura, a professor in Carnegie Mellon’s Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, and Aleksandar Kavcic, a former doctoral student of Moura and now professor of electrical and computer engineering at the University of Hawaii, will receive a large portion of the proceeds.
In the early 1990s, Moura and Kavcic decided to focus their research on the challenge of magnetic recording devices being pushed towards their physical limitations. The pair were able to determine the amount of data that was being contained into very small spaces, an important issue that arose over the next couple of years.
The work of Moura and Kavcic led to more accuracy when determining the amount of data being stored in small disk drives of computers. This allowed the data storage industry to progress in recording larger amounts of data in continuously shrinking domains.
“A key part of Carnegie Mellon’s mission is making discoveries that have global impact,” said Carnegie Mellon President Subra Suresh in a university press release. “We are pleased to honor the work of José and Alek, two inventors who provided a major step forward in computing technology, at a time when computing was transforming our world.”
Posner family donates $5 million directed  towards CMU presidential scholarships
The Posner family has recently given $5 million dollars to Carnegie Mellon University to support undergraduate student scholarships. This money will create a minimum of five undergraduate scholarships each year. Students receiving this scholarship will be decided upon based on their academic success and future potential.
This gift adds to the longstanding support that the Posner family has given to the University. The Posner family is currently represented by Carnegie Mellon University Trustee Anne Molloy and her husband Henry Posner III. Posner expressed his pride in seeing the University’s growth from what it was during his father’s time to the global institution it is now.
“Carnegie Mellon is dedicated to attracting a diverse cohort of outstanding students from around the world and all walks of life,” said Carnegie Mellon President Subra Suresh in a university press release. “We thank the Posner family for their generous gift, which will help expand access to a CMU education for many students, allowing us to create an even more diverse student body. Their commitment testifies to the importance of this mission.”
Carnegie Mellon’s Presidential Fellowships and Scholarships program now stands at a value of $156 million, supporting more than 145 students.

Everyone wants to feel safe, but what actually constitutes a safe space is murkier than it seems. According to Advocates for Youth, a nonprofit advocacy group dedicated to sexuality education, it is “a place where anyone can relax and be fully self-expressed, without fear of being made to feel uncomfortable, unwelcome or challenged on account of biological sex, race/ethnicity, sexual orientation, gender identity or expression, cultural background, age, or physical or mental ability; a place where the rules guard each person’s self-respect, dignity and feelings and strongly encourage everyone to respect others.” The concept sounds great on paper. An environment in which everyone can just be themselves, and not be scared of being judged, of being discriminated against or harassed. Sounds almost utopian. This should be exactly what we desire in an educational institution, right?
But something went wrong. This seemingly innocuous idea has cost many careers, led to the imposition of unconstitutional speech codes in some of our country’s most prestigious institutions, and led to books as influential and important as Virginia Woolf’s Mrs. Dalloway and Ovid’s Metamorphoses being censored on college campuses. In a more personal incident, it led to the residence of Omar Mahmood, a student at the University of Michigan, being vandalized for a satirical op-ed published in The Michigan Review  mocking political correctness and trigger warnings. The irony of this incident is greatly exaggerated by one of the scribbled notes left on his doorstep saying “everyone hates you you violent prick.” The idea of a safe-space has turned into a tool for silencing people on college campuses.
In an essay from The Atlantic titled The Coddling of the American Mind, Greg Lukianoff, president and CEO of the Foundation for Individual Rights in Education (FIRE), and Jonathan Haidt, social psychologist and professor at the New York University Stern School of Business, postulate an interesting culprit to explain why safe spaces have gone so astray: the impulse of vindictive protectiveness which creates “a culture in which everyone must think twice before speaking up, lest they face charges of insensitivity, aggression, or worse.” This concept relies on the fundamental misconception that words can, perhaps unintentionally, cause emotional harm equivalent in magnitude and intensity to physical assault. If we base our idea of harm on this frankly absurd foundation, we can easily understand how striving to create a safe-space could lead to some of the troubling circumstances described above.
The most disturbing part of the entire phenomenon is that it is largely imposed by the students. Lukianoff and Haidt go on to describe and comment on the two major tools used by student activists to censor speech and ideas on campuses: trigger warnings and microaggression. Trigger warnings began as just a courteous gesture out of respect for the trauma experienced by victims of sexual assault. You put a warning before any content that might bring up the trauma, and people who need to can avoid the content or go in prepared. Sounds perfectly reasonable right? And in some contexts they are. The problem is, where do you draw the line? A draft guide on trigger warnings from Oberlin College tells professors “triggers are not only relevant to sexual misconduct, but also to anything that might cause trauma. Be aware of racism, classism, sexism, heterosexism, cissexism, ableism, and other issues of privilege and oppression.” This would include most content that would ever come up in a humanities or social sciences class, which would make it difficult to teach.
Of course, you could ask, what is the harm in giving a bit of warning if distressing content is ahead? Nothing, if we had a clear idea of what is considered distressing. The problem with anything based on subjective human experiences, like distress, is exactly that: they’re subjective, and putting warnings on some things and not others can favor on kind of trauma over another. In the end, it boils down to whether the trigger is something you should expect in a given scenario. Of course trigger warnings preceding graphic material pertinent to veterans and victims of sexual assault aren’t being debated. But if you enroll in a course on 20th century literature, it’s almost impossible for you not to expect misogyny, so giving a trigger warning before The Great Gatsby, as proposed by a student at Rutgers University, not only seems redundant, but also unreasonable.
Ultimately, it’s a question of what you are trying to accomplish. The original intent was to be courteous to victims suffering from PTSD. Now, however, the intent seems to be to forewarn, and make optional, even the slightest discomfort that could possibly be experienced in a classroom setting. The impact this could have on the quality of education is summed up brilliantly in the anecdote recounted by Jeannie Suk in The New Yorker, in which law students at Harvard requested their professors not to teach rape law lest it distress students.
The concept of a microaggression is even more problematic. For those of you who aren’t up to date on your politically correct terminology (honestly I didn’t know this word existed until a week ago), microaggressions are small actions or word choices that seem on their face to have no malicious intent, but that are thought of as a kind of violence nonetheless. Yes, you read correctly: microaggressions may seem to have no malicious intent. This means that they could actually have no malicious intent, until willfully misinterpreted. For example, asking an Asian American or Latino American “Where were you born?” may be considered a microaggression, since you could be interpreted as implying that they aren’t a real American. Other statements that are considered microaggressions by the University of California system are: “America is the land of opportunity” and “I believe the most qualified person should get the job.” This is chillingly reminiscent of Arthur Miller’s play The Crucible: all that is needed to prove your case is to generate the right amount of hysteria.
An incident that captures this perfectly was the Halloween debacle at Yale. Following a mass email sent to the student body about appropriate costumes, Erika Christakis, the then Associate Master of Silliman College, sent out an email basically asking the students to decide for themselves whether a costume would be considered offensive or not. “Have we lost faith in young people’s capacity — in your capacity — to exercise self-censure, through social norming, and also in your capacity to ignore or reject things that trouble you?” You would think that granting students the courtesy of autonomy and respect would have resulted in reciprocal courtesy. No such luck. “Be quiet!” a Yale student yells at Nicholas Christakis, the Master of Silliman College, in a temper tantrum fortunately captured on video. When Christakis disagrees with her, rather than responding like an adult, the student goes on to yell “Who the fuck are you?... It is not about creating an intellectual space!... It is about creating a home here!”
There you have it, the fundamental problem, the misconception at the root of this poison tree whose fruit are being plucked on campuses all over the nation. It isn’t about creating an intellectual space, but a home, a safe-space, where we will never feel uncomfortable, never have to face dissenting opinions like an adult, never have to confront conflicting views except through mass hysteria and the strategic use of the magic words trigger warning and microaggression. The macroaggression from the student body ended up causing Erika Christakis to quit her position at Yale due to, as she put it, the climate not being "conducive to civil dialogue."
How does this affect us at Carnegie Mellon? The beauty of it is that it doesn’t. Incidents like this have happened at Yale, University of Michigan, Claremont McKenna and many other prestigious institutions, but not here. We need to realize how lucky we are and try hard to preserve it. In Spotlight on Speech Codes 2016, FIRE surveyed 440 schools on their nominal speech code policies, policies that tend to restrict the First Amendment rights of students. They classify schools as one of either Red, Yellow or Green Light, where a red light institution is one that “has at least one policy both clearly and substantially restricting freedom of speech, or that bars public access to its speech-related policies,” while a green light campus is one whose “policies do not seriously threaten campus expression.” Of the 440 schools, 49.3 percent were found to be red light (including Princeton, Swarthmore, CalTech, and Harvard) while only 22 schools were found to be green light, including Carnegie Mellon! I didn’t realize what a stroke of good fortune it is to attend a college that doesn’t seek to curtail our right to freedom of expression, but apparently it’s quite a lot to ask.
Meanwhile, in a survey of incoming college freshmen released two weeks ago, the Higher Education Research Institute at the University of California at Los Angeles found that 43 percent of incoming freshmen believe that colleges have the right to ban extreme speakers from campus, while a whopping 71 percent think that racist/sexist speech should be prohibited. If we’re not careful, we might not be in the green light for much longer.
In a town hall meeting in Des Moines, Iowa, President Obama stated that the purpose of college is “to widen your horizons, to make you a better citizen, to help you to evaluate information, to help you make your way through the world, to help you be more creative.” He continued to say that “the way to do that is to create a space where a lot of ideas are presented and collide, and people are having arguments, and people are testing each other’s theories and over time people learn from each other because they’re getting out of their own narrow point of view and having a broader point of view.” This process isn’t comfortable. At times it can be quite infuriating. I spent most of a night last week trying to convince my friend that cultural appropriation is actually an issue. Was it frustrating? Sure. But in the process, I uncovered a plethora of assumptions and biases that I had been conditioned not to question. And that’s what college is about: creating a space where it is safe to express any opinion or idea, not just those considered worth protecting.

Last Saturday, Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia passed away unexpectedly in his sleep. His last words were unknown, but they were probably scathing. Scalia, appointed by Ronald Reagan in 1986, was one of the most conservative members of the Court and its most passionate advocate of an originalist reading of the Constitution.
His death, like his life, is full of political controversy because his vacancy throws the ideological balance of the court into uncertainty. Less than an hour after news broke of his death, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) put out a statement saying that the Senate would not move forward to confirm any replacement that President Obama nominates. After years of Republicans in the Senate stalling Obama’s judicial nominees, this is shaping up to be the bitter end to years of partisan divide. The final showdown.
But I want to suggest an alternative path. Instead of Republicans and Democrats in the Senate throwing sand in each other’s eyes over Justice Scalia’s replacement, instead of this being the partisan climax to seven years of ideological strife, Justice Scalia’s death is an opportunity for both parties to come together and nominate a consensus candidate to the Supreme Court. In so doing, they can signal hope that Congress can get something done, that the parties can work together, that the Constitution is bigger than party affiliation.
Both parties have something to give, both parties have something to gain. That’s a strange and exotic formula called (gasp) “compromise.” What Republicans have to give is clear: the decades of a conservative majority on the court are over. They can cry and scream like a toddler who just heard the words “living constitution” for the first time, but they can’t beat their fists against the floor forever.
What Republicans have to gain is a political victory, or at least they’ll avoid a political nightmare. Seven years of obstructionism have taken a political toll on the Republican party. The party is fractured against itself and deeply unpopular with the general public. The party has a tough election year coming up: 24 Republican senators are up for reelection compared with just ten Democrats. At least five of the Republican seats are very vulnerable, and Democrats tend to turn out more during a presidential election. If Senate Republicans spend the last year of President Obama’s administration amplifying their obstructionism to an unprecedented level, they will pay the price electorally: they will lose the Senate, and they will guarantee another Democratic president. And guess what? A Democratic President and Democratic Senate are going to place on the Court a justice far more liberal than the type of Justice that President Obama can hope to nominate.
What Democrats have to gain is clear: a third Obama nominee to the Court and the first liberal majority on the Court in decades. We are one justice away from a sensible liberal majority on the Supreme Court. We are one justice away from overturning Citizens United. We are one justice away from ending the death penalty. We are one justice away from remembering that the phrase “well-regulated militia” is written in the Second Amendment.
What Democrats have to give is hope of replacing Antonin Scalia with a justice who makes Ruth Bader Ginsburg look like Ronald Reagan. It’s not going happen. Instead, Democrats have to stand behind a consensus candidate, a moderate who won’t throw the balance of the Court wildly to the left, but will instead bring it into equilibrium, with four conservatives and four liberals on either side. That is true balance, and President Obama is in a position to make it reality.
If you’re anything like me, you’re tired of a dysfunctional Congress. As college students, we’re in our late teens and early twenties. Harsh partisan division is the only thing most of us have ever seen since we’ve started paying attention to politics. Republicans have to act like adults and come to the table, rather than shooting spitballs at the table from the corner. Democrats have to make room at the table and be willing to put seven years of Republican spitballs behind them. Congress has a choice to make over the next eleven months. Will Antonin Scalia’s death be a turning point for the worse or for the better? The cynic in me tells me that it will be for the worst, but the optimist in me is still holding out hope beyond hope that there’s such a thing as bipartisanship.
Justice Scalia loved the Constitution. He spent his life defending his skewed perception of it. The Constitution is clear about what happens now: the President nominates a successor, and the Senate gets to “advise and consent.” If Obama nominates a qualified, unifying candidate, it is incumbent upon the Senate to confirm him or her. To do anything else would mar Scalia’s legacy and dishonor his life of service.

“Flowers for Algernon” by David Keyes is a fascinating short story. Besides the fact that it is poignant story and a great social commentary on how everyone, without exclusions, deserves the right to live, it also brings to light some of the subconscious biases that people have and how that influences their behavior. The protagonist of the book, Charlie, is “developmentally disabled” man who is mistreated and mocked by his family and co-workers. He undergoes an operation to “increase his IQ” as a part of a science experiment, which has repercussions on his social and emotional life.
I believe the fact that his intellect decides how people treat him is of special interest. He faces social prejudice based on his intellect, which acts as grounds for an “intellect based social divide.” Unfortunately, this divide also exists outside of fiction, and even at Carnegie Mellon.
Prejudices refer to baseless beliefs that one person might hold against another person based on social class (classism), race (racism), sex (sexism), physical attractiveness (lookism), or other factors. One such factor might be the perceived “smartness” of a person by society. It is a subtle bias, and may not be applicable to everyone, but, hypothetically speaking, intellect can serve as a classifier of sorts. People may not belong in the categories that someone assigns them, but these external categories can still have effects.
Not everyone subconsciously types the people around them, but I speculate about the possible existence of an unnoticed bias. The most obvious way that people perceive someone else’s intelligence is through their IQ, their academic or extracurricular achievements, and the kinds of things that they speak about. Even with those characteristics, how do people relate that to themselves? Is being smart defined as a person being able to do things the observer cannot do, or is it when a person can do things the observer can do, only better? If the former case is true in college life then, broadly speaking, people of very different disciplines would consider each other to be smarter. If it is the latter case, then they would consider some of their peers to be smarter than they are. Either way, this perception influences the social life of college students in terms of their social circles, their confidence, and, perhaps, even their performance.
What does it mean to be on either end of the spectrum? Based on the behavior demonstrated by other biases, being on the lower end of the spectrum is definitely an unwanted thing. In this case, being on the higher end may be disadvantageous too. It is even possible that a person seen by somebody else as smart may not be seen as smart by everyone. 
This difference complicates the experience and the observation of this bias. 
If one considers the social circle that a person has, one might even question the motives, the subconscious reason behind picking those particular people as a part of their lives. Can people be divided into three categories — first, the ones who pick friends “smarter” than them, second, those who pick friends “less smart” than them, and third, those who pick friends in the same category as them? If so, then what are the motives behind that? And what role can a university play in avoiding such a separation of intellectual relationships if they do exist? In a university like Carnegie Mellon, where it is hard to perceive someone as not smart, how does this bias affect power play in social relationships? All these questions often go unaddressed in our culture, and it is time to pull them into focus.
In addition, these perceptions are relative to oneself. To some extent the way we view ourselves and our confidence affects our perception of others’ abilities. The distinction between low, high and over confidence must play a role in the way we see ourselves in relation to others, thereby affecting our social circles.
This is the crux of this issue. College students, especially at Carnegie Mellon, are prone to feelings of low self-confidence. The workload and the sudden increase in a surrounding intellectual level, coupled with the feelings of inadequacy at “not being the best anymore” make many freshmen reevaluate their self-perceived capabilities. Here it becomes important to look at intellect as a bias, and understand how it affects people and what one can do to become more aware of it. Since this is a bias that is defined individually for a person and by a person, there is a need to better understand the social implications of this at personal level, which is the action that I ask the reader to take.

On Jan. 19, Mount St. Mary’s University’s student newspaper The Mountain Echo published an article reporting evidence that their University President Simon Newman, was attempting to improve the university’s retention rates by dismissing approximately 20 to 25 first-year students deemed at risk of dropping out early in the academic year before they would have a chance to affect reported retention rates.
Newman’s plan to improve retention rates reportedly involved a survey given to all first-years during orientation. Despite being presented to the students as a leadership tool with “no wrong answers,” developed to help students “discover more about [themselves],” the results of the surveys were actually used to assess whether a student was at risk of dropping out. Newman reportedly asked Greg Murry, the director of Mount St. Mary’s orientation, to compile a list of students whose surveys indicated that they were unlikely to finish their freshman year. The president reportedly told the faculty, “This is hard for you because you think of the students as cuddly bunnies, but you can’t. You just have to drown the bunnies … put a Glock to their heads.” The Mountain Echo also reported an email exchange in which Newman said, “My short term goal is to have 20 to 25 people leave by the 25th [of Sep.]. This one thing will boost our retention 4 to 5 percent.”
The school board stands behind Newman, claiming that while he used an “unfortunate metaphor,” his plan was taken out of context. Newman’s proposal was met with marked concern, however, from some of the university’s faculty, who held that it wasn’t possible to accurately determine who would drop out, and even if it was possible, it was unethical to use the surveys in this way without notifying the students. Several professors and faculty members actively opposed Newman’s plan, spurring Newman to fire several faculty members including David Rehm, ex-provost of Mount St. Mary’s, and two university professors, one of which was The Mountain Echo’s adviser.
This controversy has raised concerns over a variety of issues including freedom of the press, faculty rights, and the influence of business on academics. The Mountain Echo has been severely criticized by the board for using leaked emails, which the board claims goes against the school’s code of conduct. Many are also noting that Newman has prior experience in business, not higher education, and suspect that his business principles influenced his retention plan. While this controversy has sparked a number of important debates, The Tartan is interested in what this story has to say about the dangers of college rankings.
The events at Mount St. Mary’s University are rooted in Newman’s desire to increase the college’s rankings; by encouraging students to leave early in the semester, the school would have lower dropout numbers, which would improve their overall ranking as an institution. Unfortunately, this manipulation of data is far from uncommon. In recent years many colleges have revealed similar scandals, ranging from falsification to mild manipulation. 
Iona College, for example, admitted in 2011 that they had falsified a variety of statistics, including test scores, freshman retention, and acceptance rates. It has since been estimated that this falsification led to a significant increase in the college’s overall ranking, putting Iona at 30th on U.S. News’ ranking list, one of the most prominent college ranking lists in the country. Correct data would likely have put the university at 50th. Other universities have also turned to data manipulation in order to improve their rankings. Bayer University was the topic of a similar scandal in 2008 when they attempted to raise their average SAT scores by reimbursing admitted students who retook the SAT.
This manipulation and falsification speaks to a larger issue: an over-dependence on college rankings. While college rankings are intended to be useful resources for students and universities, they are often used beyond their intended purpose. Prospective students, parents, and universities who wish to make side-by-side comparisons between multiple schools often use college rankings as all-inclusive, concrete sources of information instead of the partial, and often subjective, source of information they really are.
Even if falsification and manipulation of rankings didn’t happen, there would still be the subjectivity inherent in these rankings due to the diverse range of schools the lists encompass. A school’s multi-dimensional presence cannot be accurately encompassed by a number. Every prospective student is looking for something different in a university, so the idea of a “number one” university is illogical.
Despite the natural individual bias of these lists and brazen manipulation of data that occurs, there is still a heavy reliance on college rankings. When institutions gain higher scores they also reap other benefits. Better rankings lead to an increase in the number of prospective students and an increase in alumni donations. Rankings can also influence a school’s funding and ability to attract prestigious faculty.
This dependence puts pressure on schools to boost their rankings in order to stay competitive, attract students, and fund their programs. While some motivation can be healthy and push schools to improve themselves, an overwhelming reliance on college rankings pressures many schools to go to extreme measures to keep their rankings high in order to retain students and funds. This focus on rankings draws attention away from the real goal of higher education: providing students with the best education possible.
College rankings can be helpful, but they need to be used correctly and with caution. Prospective students, universities, and the general public, need to understand the limitations of these resources and realize that they are not all-inclusive, definitive lists. A decrease in the dependence on rankings would allow universities to switch their focus back to the students and away from the numbers game that ranking promotes.

I often hear Bernie Sanders supporters say that the more they find out about Bernie, the more they like him. So I decided to find out more about Sanders and my verdict is: I’m not feeling the Bern. While I love that Bernie Sanders advocates for ideas such as free higher education, the fundamental problem with Sanders is that he touts himself as a leader for revolutionary change, but has no such record of revolutionary leadership. If Sanders was in any way capable of leading a political revolution, it would have happened over a decade ago.
Sanders has been in Congress for 25 years, has seniority, and is the chair of a committee. However, in all of his 25 years, he has only passed three bills into law, two of them renaming post offices, according to Congress.gov. Clinton is by no means a legendary legislator herself, but for comparison, in her eight years in the Senate, she has also managed to pass three bills, and has sponsored bills at twice the rate Sanders has.
Despite his passionate advocacy for healthcare and financial reform, Sanders’ former colleague senator Barney Frank, one of the main authors on the Dodd-Frank financial reform bill, remarked: “I don’t personally remember his playing a meaningful role in moving either health care or financial regulation in the direction he favored when we were considering them,” according to Politico. According to The Washington Times, Sanders’ website brags that he is the “Amendment King,” though most of these amendments were uncontroversial spending changes, and many of his stronger amendments were eventually struck out later on in the legislative process.
Sanders is more of a lone wolf instead of the leader of a pack. He does not seem to reach out to many senators. He doesn’t know how to build bipartisan support for his policies. It is telling that despite his 20 years in the Senate, not a single colleague will come out to endorse him.
Even worse yet, Sanders has no plan of how he will accomplish his platform. Every time he is asked specifics about how his proposals will be implemented, he essentially dodges the question by stating that these systems exist in other countries. What is clear is that he most certainly cannot enact all of them. According to estimates by the nonpartisan Center for Responsible Federal Budget, Sanders’ health care plan alone has a shortfall of over $3 trillion. 
His plan to finance free college tuition with a financial transaction tax is ridiculous; governments in the past have made very little revenue with taxes on financial transactions and some have even lost revenue due to the losses in capital gains taxes that the tax creates, according to the Tax Foundation. His superficial understanding of policy is most apparent in a recent Huffington Post survey on criminal justice, in which Clinton was able to write detailed accounts of issues and solutions in criminal justice, while Sanders could only speak in generalities.
It is undeniable though that Sanders currently enjoys a much more favorable public image than Clinton. Though part of this is due to his populist message, part of this is also due to the fact that he has only recently come into the public eye; he has never faced the same degree of media scrutiny as other more influential figures.
And oh, does Clinton come under media scrutiny, especially from the left. Clinton’s critics from the left seem more to want to vilify her as symbol of Democratic establishment than provide an objective evaluation of her. They say Clinton’s inconsistencies on positions indicate that she is a liar and actually center-right when in fact, FiveThirtyEight points out that Clinton’s voting record shows she is as liberal as Elizabeth Warren. Meanwhile, they conveniently ignore Sanders’ consistent support for the gun lobby, his votes to continue funding the very wars he’s spoken out against, or his efforts to kill a 2007 immigration reform bill because he thought it would take jobs away from Americans. They bring up Clinton’s association with Kissinger but ignore Sanders’ admiration for Churchill, an open bigot whose imperialist policies induced a famine in Southeast Asia that killed millions.
There are even claims of a vast Clinton media conspiracy: Whenever a journalist, politician, or economist voices support for Clinton or criticizes Sanders, there are Sanders supporters who rush in to accuse them of being shills bought by the establishment. 
While its ties with controversial donors are a legitimate point of criticism for the Clinton campaign, these conspiracy claims fall apart under even an ounce of scrutiny. If the Pantsuits Illuminati did exist, one wonders why most of the news articles on Clinton are on her Wall Street speeches or her emails.
Those who claim that people who support Clinton only do so due for money ignore her significant accomplishments in public office. As First Lady she pursued a health care plan which led the way for the Affordable Care Act, lobbied for the State Children’s Health Insurance Program, and created the office for Violence Against Women. In the Senate, she co-wrote a successfully enacted law that better regulated pediatric drug testing, fought for funding for 9/11 aid and services for first responders, and expanded federal healthcare for national reserve members. As Secretary of State, Clinton maintained a frenetic schedule and visited more nations than any other Secretary of State. Known for her solid administration of the State Department, she pushed forward initiatives to expand American influence on human rights, most notably to empower women in the developing world.
Given her contentious public image, however, what is more impressive is how those who have personally worked with Clinton seem to come away with positive impressions of her. When Clinton began her tenure as a senator for New York, she was booed by the relatively conservative New York City police and firefighters once as she introduced a Paul McCartney concert. Yet six years later in her re-election bid, she nonetheless won the endorsement of the NYC Fire Officers Association, according to the 
New York Times. 
According to The Atlantic, many of Clinton’s colleagues in the Senate initially viewed her as nothing more than a celebrity politician, but came away impressed with her commitment to keeping her head down and working with colleagues on low-profile but important issues. Although she faced off with President Obama in a bitter primary, she was steadfastly loyal to him as Secretary of State and became one of his closest advisers.
Clinton is one of the leading figures in politics not because of some vast conspiracy, but because she has a willingness to reach out and work with people, a demonstrated sense of industriousness, and a deep appreciation and understanding of policy.
When Obama was elected into office in 2008, one of the major setbacks that plagued his first term was his lack of political experience. He had simply promised too much without any realistic expectations of how it should be implemented and had to spend most of his first term figuring out what to do. In his second term he has been much more capable in using both the hard and soft powers of the presidency and had much stronger relations within the government, which led to numerous achievements such as more stringent environmental policies, an executive order on immigration reform, and the nuclear deal with Iran.
For Democrats, 2016 is critical. The next president will preside over an era where three of the Supreme Court Justices are nearing the age of 80 and will face an obstructive Republican Congress. They can’t afford for another president to waste four years learning the ropes of the presidency, especially an ideologue as sorely lacking in policy depth and leadership as Bernie Sanders.
It is easy to voice indignant anger, but it is difficult to actually channel this anger into action. In the end, the results speak for themselves: for all Sanders’ impassioned speeches on progressive causes, Hillary Clinton has actually accomplished more of Bernie Sanders’ platform than Sanders himself.
