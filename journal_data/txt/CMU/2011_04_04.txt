Both the men and women’s track and field teams for Carnegie Mellon competed in the Washington & Jefferson Invitational on Saturday, April 2.
The men’s team finished third out of the 19 competitors. Notre Dame, Penn State, and Indiana were some of the notable competitors at the invitational.
In field events, standout first-years Nathan Cheek and Zachary Erra-Hernandez won the hammer throw and the shot put, respectively.
Sophomore Graham Shore finished third in the 10-kilometer run. Sophomore Noel Titus finished second in the 200-meter dash, and first-year Tim Kikta finished sixth.
Sophomore Daniel Ching placed in two events: third in the 400-meter hurdles and sixth in the 110-meter hurdles. First-year Mike Standish finished sixth in the 400-meter hurdles.
The men’s track and field team sports a youthful and talented bunch. The age factor is key for this team, as these competitors will be around for a couple more years, continuing to improve and placing higher and higher in their respective events. This is a great benefit for the Tartans.
The women’s track and field team finished 10th out of 17 teams at the invitational.
Senior Morgan Faer placed fourth in the hammer throw and fifth in the discus throw. Senior Melissa Hwang and first-year Marissa Bynoe both placed in the triple jump: third and fourth, respectively.
Junior Luci Laffitte finished seventh in the high jump, and seniors Laura Mckee and Courtney Baker placed fourth and sixth, respectively, in the 800-meter.
The Tartans compete again Saturday at a Carnegie Mellon-hosted meet at Gesling Stadium. “We’re looking forward to defending our turf next weekend when we get to compete for a home crowd.”

Way back in ’67, the Pittsburgh Pirates may not have been the dandy of Gamma Chi, but they did do something that the current Pirates haven’t done in, well, quite a while: They finished the season with 81 wins and 81 losses. Imagine that — a .500 record. Given that 1967 came right after a 92–70 season and was sandwiched between a 1960 World Series championship and a 1971 World Series championship, this average season was considered quite a disappointment.
It wouldn’t be this year.
Hard times have befallen the few surviving Pirates fans of the past two or so decades. Twenty years ago, Pittsburgh’s hometown team made it all the way to a heartbreaking Game 7 loss to Atlanta in the National League Championship Series. Nineteen years ago, they lost an even more heartbreaking Game 7 to Atlanta in the NLCS. Then the heartbreak just kept on coming until Pirates fans became numb and only those with the toughest hearts could stay true to their team: The subsequent 18 seasons since that devastating 1992 have seen nary a .500 record. Not one.
Hey, Nineteen: You’ve got a tall order in front of you if you want to buck the trend. The Pirates’ 18th straight losing season was their worst in 58 years. Just how bad were the 2010 Pirates? Let’s put it this way: If this year’s team wins up to 23 more games than it did last year, it wouldw still have a losing record. Do the math yourself.
The 2011 Pirates do look improved from their 2010 bunch. Following an offseason that saw the hiring of a new manager and the departure of surprisingly few “key” players (Zach Duke was non-tendered and that was about it), the new Bucs showed some promise during spring training. New first baseman Lyle Overbay tore it up in March and has potential to bring big numbers and veteran leadership to the young Pittsburgh club, and new “top” starter Kevin Correia should, if nothing else, bring stability to a Pirates rotation that has so badly needed it.
Most importantly, though, new manager Clint Hurdle has been doing his best to mold the Pirates’ monster potential into one unit working on all cylinders — and with Andrew McCutchen, James McDonald, Jose Tabata, Neil Walker, and Pedro Alvarez, the Pirates’ youngsters do pack monster potential. Hurdle may not be Joe Maddon, but he has a history of success with helping young players find themselves and develop into the stars that they can and should be.
This season’s opening series with the Cubs certainly showed some positives, including a grand slam from Walker, a two-run shot from McCutchen and a strong performance from Correia on Opening Day, and a scoreless performance from Paul Maholm on day two. There were also, unfortunately, some negatives. After Maholm left the game, Evan Meek pitched the eighth to protect a Pirates lead, and instead gave up five runs (three earned), aided by an Overbay error that snowballed into a big inning for the Cubs.
But, as Maholm said on Twitter, “Tough one today for the team.... I will hand the ball to those guys every game. It happens.”
A .500 season for the Pirates might be enough to get Hurdle the NL Manager of the Year award. Even though we say this every year, the Pirates do have all the parts to have a highly successful season; even so, that’s more true this year than it has been in recent memory. There is immense talent on the Pirates’ roster, but there is also a lot of youth, and although youth brings energy, it also brings immaturity. Not to mention the fact that the Pirates have the ghost of 2010, the ghost of 2009, the ghost of 2008, the ghosts of all the other seasons since 1993, and the ghost of that heartbreaking 1992 season staring over their shoulders. One day, all will be forgiven.
Hey, Nineteen: You’ve got a lot of potential. But please don’t take us along when you slide on down the standings.

The Carnegie Mellon men’s tennis team hit the road for two matches this past weekend. The team first stopped in Lexington, Va., where it faced No. 30 Washington & Lee University. The Tartans fought hard for a 6–3 victory over the Generals. They then traveled to Baltimore, Md., to face Johns Hopkins University, where they were defeated, 9–0. The two games brought the Tartans’ record to 11–7 this year.
The Tartans faced the Generals with a new doubles line-up. Playing No. 1 doubles for the Tartans were junior Jeremy King and sophomore Duke Miller, who cruised through their match to an 8–2 win. At No. 2 doubles, senior Alex Nemerov teamed up with sophomore Jooho Yu. They had a slow start, going down 2–5, but managed to fight back for a 9–7 victory. Senior Bobby MacTaggart and sophomore Harasha Rao fell at No. 3 doubles, and the Tartans went into singles with a 2–1 lead.
The Tartans started off strong in singles. Miller was the first Tartan off the court with a 6–1, 6–2 victory at No. 2 singles. MacTaggart added a point for the Tartans with a 7–5, 6–2 win at No. 3 singles, increasing the Tartans’ advantage to 4–2. Rao clinched the fifth point and the win for the Tartans at No. 4 singles. He fought out a long three-set match 2–6, 7–6 (7–3), 6–3. Then King brought in the Tartans’ sixth and final win with the decisive victory 6–4, 6–2.
Unfortunately, the men’s tennis team was unable to ride the momentum of its hard-fought win into its match with Johns Hopkins. Worn down by the tough match the day before, the Tartans looked tired as the Blue Jays deftly shut them out.
“We had a great match against Washington & Lee, and we are looking forward to our matches next weekend,” Rao said.
The Tartans returned to campus late Sunday night and will spend the week gearing up for their next matches. 
The men’s tennis team will be leaving Thursday and traveling to Kalamazoo, Mich., to compete in the prestigious GLCA tournament. The Tartans won the GLCA tournament last year and hope to have a repeat this year.

Junior design student and track and field star Luci Laffitte reflects on her achievements at Carnegie Mellon, including a newly set record with her relay team.
“I picked Carnegie Mellon because it was the best of both worlds: a great design program and a wonderful track team,” said Laffitte of Wellesley, Mass. “When I visited, I was toured around campus by a very welcoming design professor, Mark Mentzer, who competed on the Carnegie Mellon track team when he studied here. It made me feel instantly at home.”
In the future, Laffitte is interested in either designing educational tools or entering the field of research design.
Her most memorable moment of the season is when the coach made Barnik Saha, a first-year in H&SS, carry all of the throwing implements through security on their way to an indoor conference meet. She also remembers when Lisa Marion Garcia, a junior electrical and computer engineering major, achieved her personal record in pole vault at the indoor conference meet. “She was so happy, it was adorable!” said Laffitte.
Although the outdoor season has just begun for the track and field team, Laffitte believes her best performance so far came from last weekend’s meet when her 4x100-meter relay team broke the school record set two years ago. “It was exciting. Plus, I think we can definitely improve on our time.”
Laffitte loves being a member of the track team. “I enjoy spending so much time with my teammates who come together from all different years and majors. Not only is this useful when you need help in a class outside of your major, but I have made so many friends that I don’t think I would have met otherwise,” she said.
Laffitte’s future track goals include competing in the heptathlon (a seven-event, two-day extravaganza) next outdoor season with several of the other women.

Well, it all comes down to this. After a fantastic two weeks of March Madness with wild upsets and a ton of buzzer-beaters, we are left with a final that not many people could have expected. On Monday, the University of Connecticut Huskies, seeded third in their region, will face off against the eighth-seeded Butler Bulldogs, who have upset a ton of teams to make it this far. Butler, who made the finals last year and lost to Duke, become the first team since those same Blue Devils to have made it to the finals two straight years.
When I think about this game, I immediately think about UConn’s best player, point guard Kemba Walker. Walker, considered to be one of the best players in college basketball, is projected to be picked in the top 10 of the NBA draft this coming offseason, and he has shown why this past month. Just a month ago, Walker led the Huskies to a stunning Big East Tournament Championship, winning the toughest basketball conference in all of the NCAA. He averaged over 25 points per game en route to winning five games in five days, beating four top-25-ranked teams in the process. This included an exhilarating step-back jumper with 0.0 seconds on the clock to beat the University of Pittsburgh in the quarterfinals, one that I’m sure all of Pittsburgh will remember for a while. Walker is considered the most clutch player in the league right now, and I’m sure he’ll be unstoppable.
Coming in with the best player on the court, the Huskies immediately have the advantage from a talent standpoint, but this does not mean that Butler will just roll over. There are several reasons why the Bulldogs are at this point. First off, Butler prides itself on its hard-nosed play and tough defense. You will never see a Butler player not giving 100 percent effort on the court, and this leads to offensive rebounds, fast-break points, and other hustle plays. The  Bulldogs live off the underdog status, and they will be underdogs once again in this matchup, allowing them to be calm and collected if the game comes down to the final shot. 
In addition to this, Butler focuses its offense around two players, forward Matt Howard and guard Shelvin Mack. There are very few players who can take over the game like Walker can, but one of them is Mack. Just yesterday, he showed his game-changing abilities, going off for 24 points on five three-pointers and eight-for-11 shooting. With that type of efficiency, Butler can beat anyone in this tournament, and the Bulldogs will need Mack to come up huge if they want to come out with a win. Howard, on the other hand, is a workmanlike player who dives for loose balls, grabs boards, shoots the three, and works with his excellent post game. 
Howard is the captain of consistency, and the Bulldogs always know what they will get out of him. Add all of this to the fact that Butler has been here before, just last year, and this turns out to be a very even matchup.
So, who’s going to win this one and stencil their names in history forever? My guess is the favorite, the Huskies, because I almost always believe that the team with the best player will most likely win the game. Walker is so much better than anyone who will step on the court, and when it comes to crunch time, we all know who is going to get the ball and shoot it. Also, if freshman Jeremy Lamb shows up for UConn, the Huskies are almost unstoppable, as Lamb has shown the ability to go off for 20-plus points in the tournament multiple times. If they can find a way to control these two, they are in the driver’s seat for this game. However, I just can’t see that happening from college players, as they are normally worse at defense and are playing against a top NBA talent. Of course, nothing is to be expected in a tournament like this one, where highly regarded teams have gotten their butts kicked by “weaker” teams, so it is unfair to say Butler has no chance. No one gave the Bulldogs a chance earlier in the season, so why not defy the odds one last time?
Although none of us has a perfect bracket, this is no time to stop watching college basketball. Don’t feel ashamed. Literally zero brackets have everything totally correct on sites like ESPN, Yahoo!, and CBS Sports. You are not alone when you see a ton of red markings on your sheet of paper. This game will be one for the ages, one team led by veteran coach Jim Calhoun, the other led by new coach Brad Stevens. In the NCAA, referees do not tolerate bad sportsmanship, taunting, or other showboating, which just adds to the pleasure of watching college basketball. This will just be a dogfight, pitting the best player in college against a team that has Cinderella written all over it. Let’s hope the game lives up to the hype.

The Carnegie Mellon women’s tennis team traveled to Lexington, Va., on Saturday to take on Washington and Lee University. Following two big wins at Emory’s Fab 10 tournament the weekend before, the eighth-ranked Tartans were riding high into their match with ninth-ranked W&L. They left glumly, however, after a 6–3 defeat.
The Tartans came out strong in doubles, with the first team of juniors Laura Chen and Courtney Chin taking their match, 8–1. The third doubles team of senior Ashley Herrick and junior Cze-Ja Tam also won its match, 8–3, although W&L’s second doubles team won to send the Tartans into singles play up 2–1.
It was a bad day for the Tartans, as Chen’s 6–2, 6–0 win at first singles was the only singles win of the day for Carnegie Mellon. The Tartans fought hard, sending three matches to a third set, but ultimately dropped each one and ended up disappointed as they left town having let the match get away.
“We fought hard; we just fell short,” Chen said.
The Tartans then traveled to Baltimore, Md., on Sunday to take on Johns Hopkins University. Results will be posted online at www.thetartan.org.

Many members of the Carnegie Mellon community watched in February as Watson, IBM’s latest supercomputing project, beat Jeopardy! greats Ken Jennings and Brad Rutter on national television by a very convincing margin. This feat displayed just how far the computer science and artificial intelligence community has come in developing machines that can recognize natural human language, as Watson took on the tricky, witty language used on Jeopardy! with ease. Last week, Watson and IBM researchers came to Pittsburgh to host a full-day event of lectures and Jeopardy!-like competitions with students from Carnegie Mellon and the University of Pittsburgh. 
“It’s appropriate that today’s event be held here [in Pittsburgh], the home of a number of the early visionaries and pioneers in computer science and artificial intelligence,” Ronald Larsen, dean of information sciences at Pitt, said in his opening remarks. It was the first university symposium for Watson, with lectures from IBM executives about the breakthrough technology and its numerous applications.
David Ferrucci, an IBM research staff member and leader of integration for the Watson project, spoke about the long road the team had traveled to reach this point, the inevitable growing pains, and, of course, the joy of seeing Watson in action.
One of these growing pains involved the infamous Final Jeopardy! question in which the category was “U.S. Cities,” with the clue, “Its largest airport is named for a World War II hero; its second largest for a World War II battle.” Watson incorrectly answered, “What is Toronto??????,” the multiple question marks indicating its overwhelming uncertainty. 
“In Jeopardy!, categories don’t indicate with any strong confidence what the answer might be,” Ferrucci explained. “We have answers that might have really nothing to do with the category. Watson learned this.” For example, there may be a category titled “Authors,” but some of the answers to questions in that category may be unrelated — such as “What is the Book of Job?” or “What is Romania?” — and obviously not authors.
“We could get some signal that Toronto was a U.S. city because they have an American baseball league [and] people refer to it as an American city,” Ferrucci said. “Watson wasn’t determined to find the U.S. city — because it had learned that the category doesn’t necessarily require that.” Interestingly, something that was not displayed during the Jeopardy! broadcast was that Chicago, the correct answer, was Watson’s next best guess, ranking at 11 percent confidence. Watson actually chose Toronto because it had the highest confidence score, a mere 14 percent.
As a demonstration of Watson’s abilities, three Carnegie Mellon students and three Pitt students squared off against the system in a Jeopardy!-like contest. All three students in the Pitt team were members of their university’s quiz-bowl team, though the Carnegie Mellon team students were not.
The first round began with Pitt answering a question correctly in the category “Technologies of the Past,” followed by the Carnegie Mellon team answering a question correctly from the same category. However, Watson buzzed in for the third question, answered it correctly, and maintained its lead for the remainder of the game. 
Watson was extremely fast, most often buzzing in first to answer questions and leaving the student teams in the dust. However, this changed during one of the categories in the Double Jeopardy! round. Questions from one of the categories, “The Northernmost Capital City,” displayed three different cities, and the contestants were asked to choose the northernmost capital of the three. Both student teams figured out that if they buzzed in as soon as they were allowed to, despite not immediately knowing the answer, the 33 percent odds of answering correctly were appealing. As such, the majority of the questions in that category were answered correctly by the two student teams by beating Watson to the buzzer.
However, at the end of the game, Watson remained triumphant, with a final score of $52,100, defeating Pitt with $12,937 and Carnegie Mellon with $7,463.
Despite the loss in the demonstration game, the student contestants seemed to have had a good time. “It was pretty cool to be the first college students to be able to [compete] against Watson. We knew we had no chance of winning, but it was still fun,” said Will Zhang, a junior computer science major and a member of the Carnegie Mellon team that faced Watson.
Connor Fallon, another member of the Carnegie Mellon team, expressed amazement at the power of Watson’s technology, but also joked about its lack of manners. “Watson has no sense of humor.... He’s rude. I wouldn’t invite him to dinner.”

Every year thousands of people get shots to prevent the flu. The flu is something very commonplace in our society, but sometimes complications can lead to death; the Centers for Disease Control  estimates that the H1N1 flu in 2009 took more than 12,000 lives. The flu is caused by a virus; the virus is protected by an outer coat of protein known as a capsid. 
This capsid is the focus of the research group led by Alex Evilevitch, an associate professor of physics, who is working on accurately manipulating the pressure in the capsid of viruses that attacks human cells. According to Evilevitch, this has numerous applications in science and medicine and opens a wide range of possibilities of curing diseases like the flu that occur because of viruses.
Viruses are extremely small infectious agents that attack normal cells and then replicate within them, many times causing diseases. Viruses are “ultramicroscopic” entities, meaning that they are too small to be seen through a traditional microscope. In fact, the average virus is about a hundredth the size of a bacterium, or one-millionth of a meter in diameter. 
Viruses attack cells and inject their genetic material (DNA or RNA) into the cells. This forces the cells to make multiple copies of the virus and release them, causing diseases in the process. One example of a virus is HIV, which causes the widely known disease AIDS. 
Evilevitch explained that, in the capsid of the virus, “there is a lot of DNA packaged in a very small space. So what happens when we push all that DNA inside the capsid? DNA has a lot of negative charges on it, and it is a very stiff molecule. That causes a lot of repulsion between the DNA strands.” Because of all this repulsion inside, the capsid is constantly under pressure. 
According to Evilevitch, this pressure can reach 100 atmospheres (atm), whereas a champagne bottle is normally five or 10 atm. Most viruses use this property when injecting their DNA into host cells, as the pressure difference causes the DNA to “shoot out like a bullet” into the cells.
In Evilevitch’s lab, one of the things researchers do is measure the energy changes that result as the DNA shoots into the cells and causes a small change in heat energy. This is accomplished through microcalorimetry, which measures minute changes in temperature at the level of cells and viruses. 
The researchers at the lab are working on changing the pressure inside viral capsids so that the viruses become ineffective. This is accomplished by measuring effects of salts on the DNA pressure inside the capsid, as the ions from the salts can permeate into the capsid. 
There is a question about the practicality of changing the pressure in viruses to render them ineffective in the future. It is not realistic to inject salts directly into one’s bloodstream. 
Evilevitch explained that injections do not have to be salts; they merely have to be positively or negatively charged particles that can permeate the capsid structure and change the pressure. Even then, the pressure does not have to change dramatically. He said, “It is not the matter of changing the pressure from 100 atm to 0 atm, but instead, it is the matter of changing the pressure slightly to stop the virus from injecting or packaging its genome.”
Evilevitch’s lab is making progress toward the cure for multitudes of diseases caused by viruses. About the future, he said, “We are just about to publish a paper showing that we need to change the density inside of internal capsid charge by 1 percent and viruses will inject into the cell, but it will not repackage [the] genome into virus capsids.” 
This is a major discovery because it means that the virus could be rendered ineffective with only a slight pressure change. Though this pressure-changing process is dependent on many factors, it is a major step toward a day when viruses may not be such a menace to society; perhaps the common flu could be wiped out.

The Institute of Medicine (IOM) released recommended dietary intake values for vitamin D and calcium last November based on already-published research and evidence. While the IOM’s report does not substantially change the recommended intake of calcium, it does elevate the recommended intake values for vitamin D. The report now suggests that the average adult consume about 1,000 and 600 milligrams per day of calcium and vitamin D, respectively. This updated vitamin D intake is an increase of 50 percent from the 1997 recommendations.
Both vitamin D and calcium have been strongly connected to the promotion of healthy bone growth and maintenance. Too little calcium and vitamin D have also been shown to result in poor maintenance of bone health, which provided the evidence justifying the increased recommendations for both nutrients. According to the IOM’s report, “The current evidence, however, does not support other benefits for vitamin D or calcium intake.” Nevertheless, the report notes that too much calcium has been associated with a number of complications, the most common of which is kidney stones. The report did not suggest a similar complication associated with excessive consumption of vitamin D.
Thus far, the suggested calcium intake levels have not caused much controversy due to the substantial amount of evidence for health problems when calcium consumption falls short or is in excess. However, there is some debate around the report’s discussion and conclusions on vitamin D. Authors Ian R. Reid and Alison Avenell, researchers from the University of Auckland in New Zealand, state that they are for the most part in agreement with most of the report’s intake values and conclusions in their article “Evidence-Based Policy on Dietary Calcium and Vitamin D.” They do, however, clarify that what most people know as vitamin D — and what is treated as vitamin D in the report — is not the active component responsible for bone health. Vitamin D is actually converted to the hormone 25-hydroxyvitamin D, also known as 25(OH)D, which is responsible for influencing bone growth and health. 
Reid and Avenell also take issue with the report’s recommendation to avoid sun exposure. They emphasize in their article that “sunlight exposure is a normal part of people’s life, and that the implication that it should be universally avoided is without an evidence base.” Indeed, vitamin D is derived from UV exposure in addition to diet. Reid and Avenell see a complication in releasing a recommended intake value for vitamin D when its primary source is variable depending on the amount of sun exposure a person receives. 
Reid and Avenell’s contentions with the report, however, are minor when compared to the opinions released by Creighton University researchers Robert Heaney and Michael Holick in their article, “Why the IOM Recommendations for Vitamin D are Deficient.” Heaney and Holick accuse the IOM of misinterpreting and neglecting several crucial trials in evaluating the necessary 25(OH)D hormone levels. They argue that a higher concentration of this hormone, and therefore a higher dosage of dietary vitamin D, is crucial for bone health. 
Heaney and Holick cite several studies indicating that a sustained increased level of 25(OH)D reduced the number of fractures people received. In one study, there was a 33 percent reduction in fractures at higher 25(OH)D levels. “The fact that other trials, with less good compliance, failed to reproduce that effect does not negate the evidence of a well-conducted trial,” Heaney and Holick wrote.
The authors also argue that the recommended dietary intake value should be based on the intake that “prevailed during the evolution of human physiology.” They suggest that given our likely sun exposure, humans would have likely received two to three times the IOM’s suggested value. Their opinion is that these values should “be given the presumption of correctness, and the burden of proof must be placed on those who propose that lower intakes … are without risk of preventable dysfunction or disease.”
The IOM has not released any additional information addressing the concerns relating to its treatment, discussions, and conclusions of vitamin D.

Galaxies hungry for other galaxies
Astronomers have long observed some stars in the cores of their galaxies orbiting in the opposite direction of their neighboring celestial bodies of the same galaxy. The leading explanation for this phenomenon is that these stars were once part of another, smaller galaxy that was eventually consumed by the galaxy in which it currently resides. Recently, researchers at La Laguna University in Tenerife, Spain found supporting evidence that the ages of stars in the core of the galaxy are much different than that of the outer stars, which would not be the case if all stars were created within the same galaxy.

FDA: Artificial dyes are safe to eat
A committee of the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) said last Thursday that there is no definitive proof that artificial food colorings cause hyperactivity in small children in an eight to six vote, and that no warning labels for the foods were necessary. However, they did vote that children with existing behavioral problems may see worsening in their behavior after eating foods with artificial dyes. This debate began in the 1970s when doctors began seeing improvements in the behaviors of children with hyperactivity disorders who were prescribed with diets excluding artificial coloring.

Photos of Mercury starting to develop
NASA’s Mercury Messenger spacecraft arrived in the orbit of the closest planet to the sun on March 17, but recently began sending back pictures of Mercury. The trip to Mercury will be the last major planetary exploration performed by NASA for a while, but its spacecraft will study and photograph the planet while maintaining its orbit for at least the next year. This trip to Mercury will be the longest-sustained trip of its kind in history, helping to answer some of the remaining questions about the planet, such as why it has a magnetic field and which minerals make up its surface.

Improved replay for NCAA Final Four
XOS Digital, a digital-media service company, has designed a high-definition (HD) instant replay system for college basketball’s top games, the Final Four. Numerous close and contested in-play calls throughout the years have motivated players and coaches to suggest a better replay technology to address them. The new process hopes to give game officials a clearer measurement of how much time is left on a shot clock during any number of reviews during the games, in addition to other applications like foul calls or whether a shot was worth two or three points.

New hooks can save sea turtles
A type of hook used in longline fishing in Costa Rica has been shown to be selective in the type of fish it catches, reducing the number of sea turtles caught and injured due to the fishing industry. When researchers used a standard circle hook, they found that sea turtles and rays accounted for over 50 percent of the catch. Researchers found that “appendage hooks” dramatically reduced the number of sea turtles and rays caught, and thus have the potential to avoid harming the Costa Rican sea turtle population while allowing for the continued health of the fishing industry.

Tool helps assess risk of falling
New technology is being developed to help identify hospitalized patients who are at a risk of falling, particularly benefitting the elderly. To classify if a patient had a fall-risk, the researchers recorded the patient’s fall history over the past year and tested each patient with several standard clinical tests involving accelerometers that recorded the gait and movement during these tests. The results showed that patients could be classified into one of two categories: fallers and non-fallers.

The Greek organizations at Carnegie Mellon participate in three major annual activities on campus: Greek Sing, Buggy, and Booth. The first of these, Greek Sing, took place this past Saturday at Soldiers & Sailors Memorial Hall, providing plenty of laughs, dance steps, and musical numbers, all for a good cause.
The evening started off with a non-competitive performance from members of Lambda Phi Epsilon, who crept around the stage in stereotypical nerdy outfits before bursting into a step dance routine. At one point, a brother yelled, “Shout-out to UCLA,” presumably referring to UCLA student Alexandra Wallace’s now-infamous “Asians in the library” rant on YouTube. Afterward, Greek Sing chairs Ben Lee, a brother of Delta Tau Delta, and Dana Weinstein, a sister of Delta Delta Delta, came out to introduce the show. The evening then proceeded with the singles performances.
Beta Theta Pi was the first to perform with its original show, “True Life: I Want to Be in CMU Greek Life.” Although the show dragged at times, it did have some witty one-liners, and it poked fun at both Pi Kappa Alpha and the sororities. Beta Theta Pi did not place, but did receive one of the awards for best overall Greek Sing chair. Pi Delta Psi followed with a rendition of 8 Mile, in which DJ Rabbit can only sing, not rap, after he’s hit on the head during a rap battle. Although the musical numbers, which included “Firework” by Katy Perry, were entertaining, an off-color joke about domestic violence may have made some audience members uncomfortable.
Next was Kappa Sigma’s Top Gun. The fraternity won second place for its musical rendition of the 1986 American action film, complete with musical numbers, cardboard box planes, and a fraternity brother strutting around the stage in drag. One of the highlights of this performance was the main character, Maverick, and his love interest, flight instructor Charlotte “Charlie” Blackwood, dramatically singing Berlin’s “Take My Breath Away.” As they sang, another cast member lurked in the background, making hilariously suggestive dance moves.
The only sorority to participate in the singles category, Kappa Alpha Theta, won first place for its original show “Spice Up Your Life.” In the show, a Carnegie Mellon student uses some ingenious programming to bring the Spice Girls to life from a YouTube video, informing them that they have to save the Spring Carnival concert from Justin Bieber. Although one of the Spice Girls occasionally seemed to forget her dance moves, on the whole the performance had impressive choreography and scenery. One highlight was the relationship between Justin Bieber and Baby Spice — they kept the audience laughing with their constant flirting.
Sigma Tau Gamma’s performance was titled “Avenue CMU,” but it appeared to have deviated from the fraternity’s original plan. The Greek Sing program promised “plenty of slacking, a little hacking, and lots of Bed Intruding”; instead, the performance included songs from Into the Woods and Beauty and the Beast, as well as a rap about the Shakespearean tragedy Othello. Although the performance seemed unrehearsed, with some of the brothers forgetting the lyrics, it was still entertaining.
The final singles act was Sigma Alpha Epsilon’s, titled “The Colors of the Wind: A Brief Survey of the Works and Lives of Four Renaissance Artists.” The show consisted of a mash-up of Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles and Disney tunes that won third place. In this act, the Turtles decide to abandon their work as Renaissance artists in Italy and travel to the New World, where they meet Pocahontas and her people. The show was fun and campy, with ridiculous set pieces and a narrator reminiscent of Wizard People, Dear Reader.
After intermission, alpha Kappa Delta Phi presented a non-competitive performance of a somewhat-disorganized dance routine and a step dance routine. The show then transitioned into the doubles acts, starting with Alpha Chi Omega and Alpha Epsilon Pi’s presentation of Newsies! The show was mostly a medley of songs from the show, with a few lines of dialogue between each song to explain what was happening. Their performance was energetic with great choreography, and it won them third place.
Kappa Kappa Gamma and Delta Tau Delta then presented The Wedding Singer, which won second place. The show was slightly disorganized at first, with dancers still rushing into place as the lights came up and the first musical number began. Their main set piece, a large metal stand in the back of the stage, was also still being assembled throughout the first musical number; the construction distracted from the main action, and the set piece itself was more distracting than useful. However, the performance itself was fun and high-energy. All of the leads had strong voices, although some problems with the microphones unfortunately made it difficult to hear some of the singers.
Delta Gamma and Sigma Phi Epsilon won first place with their rendition of Hair. The show started off with a powerful performance of “Aquarius”; the huge cast’s dreamy demeanor and convincing costumes drew the audience into the world of the rebellious 1960s. The show finished with an incredible rendition of “Flesh Failures (Let the Sunshine In)” that featured great dynamic contrasts and strong ensemble vocals. In addition to winning first place in the doubles category, Sigma Phi Epsilon’s chair Dan Burdzy, a junior architecture major, won an award for best overall Greek Sing chair, and Delta Gamma won the Philanthropy Award.
The final competitive performance of the evening was Delta Delta Delta and Sigma Chi’s Nine, based off the 2009 musical movie about an Italian film director struggling to find inspiration for his next film. The performance featured provocative dance routines, as well as impressive gymnastic moves.
As the judges tallied up their final scores, Kappa Phi Lambda presented the final non-competitive show of the evening; the first half of the group’s performance was a hip-hop dance set to a “Black and Yellow” remix, and the second half was an impressively clean step dance routine. The Carnegie Mellon Loyal Scot program also 
presented a quick advertisement, including a rendition of the infamous Old Spice commercials. A representative from the Children’s Institute then came out to speak about her organization.
This year, Greek Sing raised a record-breaking $39,573 for the Children’s Institute, a pediatric rehabilitation facility in Pittsburgh. The Children’s Institute has three main components: a pediatric rehabilitation hospital; The Day School, which serves children whose disabilities might otherwise prevent them from attending school; and Project STAR, which helps find permanent homes for children with developmental disabilities. As a representative from the Children’s Institute explained, the organization, which currently serves 5,500 children, doesn’t turn any patients away, even if their insurance does not cover all their necessary care; the funds raised therefore go to sponsoring those patients that would otherwise be unable to afford care at the Children’s Institute.
Singing, dancing, and cross-dressing, all for a good cause: This year’s Greek Sing was another rousing success.

After releasing a comedy movie that unexpectedly turns into a box office hit, studios are always itching to make a sequel in hopes of recreating the money-making success of the original. More often than not, these turn out to be failures, like Home Alone 2, Weekend at Bernie’s II, and Miss Congeniality 2, to name a few. Usually, studios will leave the game early, maintaining some degree of dignity and respect for the first movie. Other times, studios try desperately, making part threes and part fours (like the unfortunate Shrek movies) until the magic that made the first movie is completely replaced with a cheap, overworked franchise.
When a comedy movie unexpectedly becomes a big hit, the original idea usually consists of a brilliant lightning bolt of inspiration that is combined with a serendipitous mixture of the perfect cast and script. This chance occurrence that leads to a great comedy is usually impossible to recreate when trying to follow the same formula that led to the original success. This is why sequels of such movies just end up stretching the magic of the first movie so thin that it turns into a disastrous nightmare. It’s therefore easy to fear that The Hangover Part II, which is coming out at the end of May this year, will meet such a fate.
The trailer of The Hangover Part II gives away that the plot will be very much like the original: A couple of friends suffer from acute memory loss after a night of drunken debauchery, and hilarity ensues as they try to piece together their night through a series of ridiculous circumstances. The difference is that instead of the bizarre combination of waking up to find a baby, a lost tooth, and a missing groom-to-be in Vegas, the sequel consists of the trio waking up to find a monkey, an inexplicable face tattoo, and a missing brother-in-law in Bangkok. While those are the ingredients that gave the first movie such unprecedented success, making the sequel an enhanced rehash of the original might not be the best way to give audiences what they want. This will just lead to a close comparison of the first and second movies, magnifying the mistakes which the sequel will likely make.
Todd Phillips, the director of The Hangover movies, told MTV News, “I think [the sequel is] a funnier film, and I think it’s a more epic film. It just turned out to be a more satisfying film. We had less constraints on us — and I don’t mean money; just freedom to do whatever we wanted.” While Phillips seems to have no concerns about the possible failure of the sequel, Bradley Cooper, who plays the very handsome and slightly arrogant Phil Wenneck, had some reservations about making a sequel. When approached about The Hangover Part II, Cooper told The Guardian, “This was not a knee-jerk reaction. We met many times to discuss the script. And it was the hardest movie I’ve ever done.” However, the Limitless star believes in the sequel’s potential, saying that “the script was better than the first one. The scope is larger. And Bangkok is like Vegas on steroids.”
When asked of their opinion on The Hangover Part II and if they are willing to see it, Carnegie Mellon students had mixed feelings. Soo Hyun Park, a sophomore biomedical and chemical engineering major, said, “The first movie was just so hilarious that there is no way they can top that. I feel like the second one will just ruin it for me.” Sophomore chemistry major Sarah Rajasekera said, “I don’t care if it’s better or worse than the first one; it’s probably gonna be funny anyway, so yeah, I’ll watch it.” 
Hopefully, The Hangover Part II will deliver and live up to the expectation of fans. But if it doesn’t, then that’s just one more Bradley Cooper film that’s out there, and there’s definitely nothing wrong with that.

Many students get a well-deserved break during Spring Carnival, using the days off to take life slightly slower. Some have parents and friends visiting Pittsburgh to participate in the fun. For most students, getting parents and friends to visit means getting to drive in a car around Pittsburgh, rather than just taking the bus. When students aren’t restricted to the Port Authority routes, they can see how livable Pittsburgh can truly be.
One way to bond with your visitors during Carnival and experience the great food Pittsburgh has to offer is by going out for brunch. Brunch is about taking the comfort of breakfast and magnifying its satisfaction.
Pamela’s Diner
We cannot talk breakfast food without talking about Pamela’s Diner, the local Pittsburgh favorite. With locations in Oakland, Squirrel Hill, and Shadyside, among others, Pamela’s has the hearts of many a college student. Their famous hot cakes have the chewiness of pancake and the salty crisp you yearn for.
www.pamelasdiner.com 
3703 Forbes Ave.
(412) 683-4066
Dor-Stop Restaurant
Dor-Stop Restaurant is Pamela’s without all the grease. It has pumpkin pancakes, as featured on Guy Fieri’s show Diner Drive-ins and Dive, and any variety of griddle cake you can dream of. One particularly good dish is the German potato pancakes with apple sauce; it provides the perfect mixture of salty and sweet.
The greatest challenge is actually traveling to Dor-Stop. Technically in Dormont, not Pittsburgh, Dor-Stop is approximately a 15-minute drive from Carnegie Mellon. You can catch the 61D on Forbes Avenue and change for the Red Line T downtown, but for the first meal of the day, you might not be able to last that long of a trip.
1430 Potomac Ave.
(412) 561-9320
E2
E2 (ESquared), an outpost of the Enrico Biscotti Company, is located in Highland Park. Highland Park may take a while to get to via public transportation; it therefore might be best to take a trip to E2 while you have parents or friends visiting with a car. The restaurant offers Italian-inspired breakfast, dressed up on pretty plates. The well-lit café is a great place for sitting and chatting before you head next door to Food Glorious Food to buy baked goods for an afternoon snack.
www.enricobiscotti.com 
5904 Bryant St.
(412) 441-1200
Coca Café
Lawrenceville is becoming a food spot, and Coca Café is the brunch place worth taking the bus to. The decor is a bit more feminine than E2, and with lines for the weekend, it’s a bustling, busy place. The omelets are more gourmet than one would find at Pamela’s or Dor-Stop, and the cafe’s French toast options are sure to impress.
www.cocacafe.net 
3811 Butler St. 
(412) 621-3171
**Point Brugge Café **
Point Brugge is the prettiest brunch location of them all. This restaurant, styled off cozy European corner cafés, is located half a mile from Bakery Square and has a constant waiting line. The café offers Sunday brunch, but does not take reservations. With steak and fries, waffles, and many other staple brunch foods, it will make you like Pittsburgh a little more.
www.pointbrugge.com 
401 Hastings St. 
(412) 441-3334

The Pains of Being Pure at Heart released a self-titled debut in 2009 to nearly universal acclaim, and it’s easy to see why. Mixing heavy influences from noise-rock bands of the late ’80s and early ’90s like My Bloody Valentine, Ride, and The Jesus and Mary Chain with unbridled energy and lightheartedness, The Pains of Being Pure at Heart appealed to more than just indie kids looking for the next underground band to adore. Music fans with an undying nostalgia for the golden age of shoegaze or with the need to lose themselves in upbeat pop could enjoy the group’s music.
After the hype died down, the question of whether the band would go down as “just another noise-pop band” rooted itself within the minds of listeners and critics alike. The release of the group’s sophomore album, Belong, answers with a resounding no, reminding listeners why they fell in love with the band in the first place.
At its core, The Pains of Being Pure at Heart has not changed its approach to making music. Despite this, there is an undeniable feeling of growth; the band sounds less like a couple of friends playing music for the fun of it and more like an experienced and united group. Songs like “Belong” and “Anne with an E” possess an ethereality that would have seemed painfully out of place on The Pains of Being Pure at Heart, but fit perfectly in the collection of songs on Belong.
The glossier production, which will undoubtedly irk some of its low-fi purist fans, gives the band the opportunity to mature beyond the indie aesthetic it mastered in its debut. The musicians haven’t quite left behind their origins, but they have moved more strongly into the areas of alternative rock and shoegaze.
Belong is a case where the album art is a pretty good reflection of the music. At first glance, there’s not much to really say about it. It’s artistic, pretty, and impressionistic. The fuzzy vocals, the distorted guitars, the prominent hissing of the hi-hats — together they form this musical portrait of juvenile disregard for the banalities of adult life. “College loans? Utility bills? Screw that!” Then, you take a closer look, and you really start to notice the details. Up close, the music isn’t nearly as poppy and pretty as it was from a distance. There’s definitely an aesthetic brilliance to it, but now it’s a bit unsettling; something is not quite right. Listen to the lyrics — they are not those of a happy-go-lucky teenager. They are about heartbreak, loss, and alienation. It is typical melancholy content packaged with a deceptively happy veneer that peels away only after several listens.
Call it nu-gaze; call it noise-pop; call it whatever you want. No matter how you decide to package Belong, it is doubtful that you will be able to find a label that accurately describes the juvenile duality of naive jubilation and insatiable longing that The Pains of Being Pure at Heart captures so poignantly.

Dreams can become reality. For Carnegie Mellon alumnus Perry Sherman, his dream as a student was to be on Broadway after graduation. Today, he is living that dream: He is on his second Broadway production, a member of the first national touring company of Next to Normal, which is coming to the Benedum Center in Pittsburgh next week. 
Sherman has already returned to Pittsburgh professionally before, during the national tour of Spring Awakening. Sherman commented via e-mail that coming back again to perform Next to Normal will be exciting for him. “I’m really proud of Carnegie Mellon. It gives me a lot of pride to have the company come and see where I trained. And it’s cool because I get to bring my friends in production to my favorite places, like the Mattress Factory, the Andy Warhol Museum, and Venus Pizza.”
“CMU is really great because it teaches you all the things you can’t get out of a professional scenario,” he said. “Teachers are there to help you. [It’s a] safe place. You can mess up, get things wrong, and they’re totally there for you to fall back on.... [Carnegie Mellon was a] great place to fall, figure out who I was and what I wanted to accomplish.”
“I have a lot of love for the teachers,” Sherman continued. “Gerry Kline always made time for me. Don Watsburg, my advisor — I keep his number in my phone and I can call him about everything. He has a great eye on the professional world and the world at school. Barbara McKenzee — who was the last acting professor I had at Carnegie — I will always keep in mind as a great teacher.”
“I saw every production Carnegie did when I was in school. Whether it’s the actors, design’s lights, [or] sound, [there’s] always something inspirational that comes out of every production.”
Sherman recalled his fondest memories at Carnegie Mellon to be “Playground, literally pulling all-nighters to get things ready for that festival and working with everyone else so closely.” Sherman explained that Playground was also “the first time I felt like I had to put on something that didn’t have anything to do with the teachers. [It was] just about us putting it together.”
He got involved in Next to Normal unconventionally. Sherman “went to a bunch of open calls in New York for it, I didn’t have an agent at the time. I am a member of Equity from [my time working on] Spring Awakening, and [so I] have the opportunity to go into open calls for Equity productions. I went into the open call and got a callback two weeks later... I got callbacks over the course of about four weeks.” Sherman also said he “had to keep on beating out for this position... And I think that helped me become so invested [in this production].”
When asked what was the most interesting aspect of being in Next to Normal, Sherman responded, “Probably being in it with Alice Ripley,” who won a 2009 Tony Award for Best Actress in a Musical for her performance as Diana Goodman in the show. “I probably gather more from her than she could even know. I go out and watch the show to see her. She’s a phenomenal actress and wonderful in this role... subtle and terrific.”
A highlight of the musical for Sherman is the music. “One of my favorite songs and themes I really like is ‘Make up Your Mind/Catch Me I’m Falling.’ It’s at the end of act one and kind of like everything is culminating into this one number. A lot of different things are happening at the same time — plot lines interweave and mix during the song.”
In Next to Normal, Sherman is the understudy for two characters, Henry and Gabe. He described Henry as the “sweetheart, very naïve — [he has] no idea of what he is getting himself into when he starts his relationship. Playing him [you have to be] open to whatever the actress playing Natalie gives you. [You have to] be willing to play with her and find the fun onstage. Henry’s the light side of the story. Gabe is much more physical. He represents sex in the show. He is a visceral character. He’s all over the set all the time, running and always doing something.”
To prepare for his roles, Sherman explained that for Gabe, “I have to be loose and make sure I’m ready to do the physicality. For Henry, I can’t be thinking about anything else, I need to be in the moment with Natalie onstage.”
In regards to future plans, Sherman is unsure. “I really enjoy writing and directing, and don’t really know [what I’ll do next]. What makes me happy now is acting. Who knows, in a couple of years I might feel a strong pull to a different area. In the age of YouTube, anything can happen. I could write a script for YouTube that could become really big. [With the] crazy way things travel, [if you’re] talented and have ambition it could really happen. Right now I just do what makes me happy and what fulfills me. Next to Normal really does that. It’s a wonderful story, and I’m proud and excited to be a part of it.” 
Alumnus Perry Sherman plays understudy for Gabe/Henry in Next to Normal coming to the Benedum from Tuesday, April 5 to Sunday, April 10. Tickets can be purchased at www.pgharts.org.

Never Let Me Go
10 12
This movie, based off a novel of the same title by the Japanese-born English author Kazuo Ishiguro, follows Kathy (Carey Mulligan), Ruth (Keira Knightley), and Tommy (Andrew Garfield), three students at boarding school in the seemingly idyllic Hailsham, England. Eventually, the three discover that they are scientific specimens created in a laboratory and raised in order to provide their organs to severely ill patients, and that the only way out of their inevitable death is to prove that they can fall in love. Never Let Me Go provides a gorgeous and provocative look at humanity and love, and, as one of the commonly cited best films of 2010, is a must-see.
Black Swan
10 12
This psychological thriller, directed by Darren Aronofsky and starring Natalie Portman, Vincent Cassel, and Mila Kunis, revolves around a New York City dance company’s performance of Swan Lake. In the film, Nina (Portman) is a ballerina who desperately seeks the lead role. While she fits the characteristics of the clean and elegant White Swan, she fails to embody the dark and sensual elements of the role’s other half, the Black Swan. Nina finds the darkness within herself when competing with Lily (Kunis) for the role, and is driven to a place of mental instability and hallucination. Black Swan was nominated for five Academy Awards, and the gross theater average was the second-highest for an opening weekend in 2010 behind The King’s Speech.
The King's Speech
10 12:30
This 2010 British historical drama, directed by Tom Hooper and written by David Seidler, was the recipient of 12 Oscar nominations, more than any other film this year. The King’s Speech tells the story of King George VI, played by Colin Firth, who seeks and befriends an unorthodox speech therapist named Lionel Logue, played by Geoffrey Rush, to correct his stammer. Firth’s performance in this film is undeniably the actor’s best, as his performance earned him a Golden Globe, a British Academy Film Award, a Screen Actor’s Guild Award, and an Academy Award — all for Best Actor — as well as several other awards.
Enter the Void
10 1
Enter the Void is a 2009 French “psychedelic” film written and directed by Gaspar Noé. The film tells the story of Oscar (played by Nathaniel Brown), an American drug dealer who, when living in Tokyo, is shot and killed by the police. Before his death — and in an attempt to stop his drug abuse and cue him into his spirituality — Oscar’s best friend Alex (played by Cyril Roy) had exposed him to The Tibetan Book of the Dead. Oscar’s soul mimics those described in the book as he rises above his body upon death to float around the streets of Tokyo. Oscar then makes it his mission to watch over his sister Linda (played by Paz de la Huerta) and his friends after his death.

100 YEARS AGO
April 5, 1911
“Run a small ventilating fan for 21 hours,” “carry you three miles in an electric brougham,” and “clean 75 pairs of boots” are all items that appear in a list this week of “What a kilowatt hour of electricity will do.” There is no mention, unfortunately, of homework.

March 29, 1961
A questionnaire asks, “Do you think that at 65 you will prefer to retire or work as long as you can be an asset?” A majority of students in each of Tech’s colleges say they prefer to work — except business majors, who are split 50–50. Let’s see what those 70-year-old slackers are up to today.

April 8, 1986
Tartans’ hearts collectively skip a beat this month, as a miscommunication with the city of Pittsburgh delays the necessary permits for Buggy practice. Permits were eventually issued, and Sweepstakes 1986 went on as planned as soon as the Buggy chairs stopped hyperventilating.

U.S. News & World Report ranks Carnegie Mellon’s computer engineering program first in the nation, ahead of MIT and Stanford. In an interview, the head of the electrical and computer engineering department compared the No. 1 ranking to winning the Super Bowl. Fewer riots, though.

The university’s 6:30 Jazz Ensemble performs with two other jazz groups in a Carnegie Music Hall concert. Cool riffs and hot solos were there in abundance; it was just the audience that was missing. One of the student performers said it best: “No one showed up, but whatever.”

Ragtime, a polyrhythmic musical genre that enjoyed its peak from 1897 to 1918, is a forgotten genre; society’s perception of it has been muddled into a caricature of itself. This is unfortunate, because ragtime has had a large amount of influence on notable 20th-century musical styles. Edward Berlin, a ragtime scholar, states in The Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians that it was usually written in 2/4 or 4/4 time with a dominant left-hand pattern of bass notes on odd-numbered beats and chords on even-numbered beats, accompanying a syncopated melody in the right hand. 
While Scott Joplin’s 1899 “Maple Leaf Rag” can be seen as the first true distillation of the musical genre, it’s his 1902 composition, “The Entertainer,” that most listeners can recognize as the quintessential ragtime sound. Ragtime fell out of favor in the ’20s in the United States as jazz was on the upswing, but there have been several revivals in which the music from the early 20th century has been rediscovered. 
Given the storied history of the genre, it’s important to take note of the greatness that its sounds have harnessed. Etta Baker, Reverend Gary Davis, and Wille “The Lion” Smith all used the form and channeled their mighty melodies through the ragtime sound.
That’s where Tom Brier, a California native, comes into the picture. A professional programmer and analyst, as well as a lifetime lover of ragtime, Brier has a virtuosic comprehension of the nuanced sounds of ragtime. He picked up the piano at the age of five and began appearing as a featured performer at the West Coast Ragtime Festival and other festivals right out of high school. At these festivals, he blew away audiences with his understanding of the genre and his gift with sight-reading and improvisation.
To experience the virtuosity of Tom Brier, hop onto YouTube and search his name. You will get hundreds of fun, fiery, and frenetic recordings.

Out on the front of the Carnegie Museum of Art, there is a giant banner with the words Paul Thek: Diver, a Retrospective. On it is a painting of Thek diving into the ocean. The image is calm, soothing, even; one might expect the exhibit to evoke the same feelings. Once you enter the exhibit, however, you are quickly jolted out of your initial expectations into the quirky, twisted world of Paul Thek.
Thek was an American artist whose work, while popular in Europe, often went unappreciated in the United States during his lifetime. His work began to receive more critical attention, however, after his death in 1988. Diver: A Retrospective, co-curated by Elisabeth Sussman; Sondra Gilman, curator of photography at the Whitney Museum of American Art; and Lynn Zelevansky, the Henry J. Heinz II director of Carnegie Museum of Art, includes artwork of Thek’s that has never before been shown in the United States.
The first room of the exhibit focuses mostly on Thek’s “Meat Pieces,” which are “hyper-realistic pieces of glistening, bloody meat sculpted in wax, covered in paint, and housed in a geometric plexiglass vitrine,” as the exhibit text explains. The pieces are all gruesomely realistic — some even have larger-than-life flies permanently perched on the meat, forever feasting.
The next room in the exhibit contains the remnants of Thek’s installation artwork. Most of his installation work was created from disposable, everyday items, and as such few of his installations remain intact today. What does remain, however, provides a glimpse into Thek’s quirky psyche. One piece, “Fishman in Excelsis Table,” has a wax mold of Thek’s body covered in fish and tied to the bottom of a wooden table. Thek claimed that the fish were supposed to represent his friends, and were holding him up. Another, “Untitled (Dwarf Parade Table),” features an oversized statue of a dwarf holding up one end of a wooden table. A large, stuffed black bird is perched ominously in the corner. One cannot help but wonder at the borderline absurdity of it all. This is not art in the traditional sense; this is art that is forceful and full of personality, art that provokes more questions than answers.
The next room of the exhibit abruptly switches away from installation pieces and is instead full of paintings, mostly filled with blues and pinks. Although some still contain quirky images of volcanoes and dinosaurs, others are quieter, more introspective. The room includes multiple paintings of Thek as a diver; as the exhibit explained, “To him, the diver was isolated, physical, delving beneath the surface toward the unknown. This was Thek’s goal.” This sense of isolation is also evident in “Untitled (Burning Book Triptych),” which has three paintings of a burning book floating alone on a vast sea.
Another part of the exhibit, “Bronzes and 1970s Paintings” included just that: a collection of small bronze sculptures and paintings that Thek created, along with pages from his notebooks, which include sketches, notes, and letters. Thek’s sense of humor shines through in some of the works, particularly in “Self Portrait as a Hot Potato,” which is a painting of a potato with arms and legs. Another highlight of this room is “Untitled (Globe),” which has a glowing orb perched carefully on a nest.
The final room in the exhibit, titled “Return to New York,” was filled with small paintings topped with brass picture lights, some of which had kindergarten-sized chairs positioned in front of them. The paintings all featured bright colors and quirky images; despite this, some still held an ominous tension. “Untitled (Five Vertical Lines),” for example, has a cheery pastel background but has fiery-red lines down the center, as though someone had clawed at the painting with bloody fingernails.
Paul Thek: Diver, A Retrospective is not your typical art exhibit, despite what the innocent-looking painting on the museum’s banner might lead you to think. It does not contain art that is merely aesthetically pleasing, suitable to hang on your living room wall. Rather, Thek’s work grabs you by the shoulders and forces you to reconsider all your preconceived notions about what art truly is.

Dear Hoskins Brothers,
I want to throw a luau. Do you have any tips to make it a success?
Sincerely,
Luaus Exceed Imagination
Dear LEI,
The luau is a fine and delicate art. All the pieces must be carefully put into place for it to be a success. There are a few main ingredients: torches, leis, hula, pineapple, roasted pig, and limbo. Now, torches — and the fire-dancing that usually goes with them — aren’t really safe, so instead you should get some sticks and tie flashlights to the ends. It’s just like the real thing! Next, you need some hula girls (or guys) to hand out your leis and do a crappy imitation of a hula dance. Prepare for a lot of “getting leid” jokes. The centerpiece should be your entire pig roasting over an open fire. You can buy one at Costco or Sam’s Club.
The main attraction to any luau is the limbo. This is best done after a few drinks. When limboing, you need to be able to bend not just from your waist, but from your knees. I’d recommend wearing weighted shoes to move your center of gravity forward. If you want to go pro, learn to bend from your ankles. When you can do that, women will be throwing themselves at you.
Wait until Pittsburgh stops messing around and it gets warmer,
Patrick Hoskins
Dear Hoskins Brothers,
The other day I got in a fight with my boyfriend. He claims he can tell the difference between butter and I Can’t Believe It’s Not Butter. No one can do that! How can I prove him wrong?
Thanks,
Butter Lover
Dear BL,
That’s insane! Your boyfriend’s full of it. No one can believe it’s not butter — not even him! I see two options: Prove him wrong and humiliate him, or let him have his victory and be constantly bragging about his tasting abilities. Humiliation it is.
The most obvious solution is to make him do a blind taste test. Give him two cups, one full of butter and the other full of ICBINB, without telling him which is in which, and make him eat them plain.
If he manages to keep the cups of butter down and can’t tell the difference, you’ve won! But if he can, then you are quite possibly dating a super-hero: “The Supertaster,” “The Discerning Palette,” etc. As his girlfriend, it’s your job to help him use his powers to fight crime — how, I have no idea.
Or just give him two sticks of butter and watch him squirm,
Brian Hoskins

Last Monday, candidates running for student body president and student body vice president met with their opponents at a debate held by The Tartan and the Elections Board. The first pair of nominees consisted of Jake Flittner and Sangita Sharma, a junior dual mechanical engineering and public policy major and a sophomore dual materials science and biomedical engineering major, respectively. The second pair of nominees consisted of Turi Alcoser and Kelsey Briggs, both junior dual materials science and biomedical engineering majors.
Voting opened last Saturday and runs until tomorrow, April 5.  
Although both groups of candidates agree on many issues, such as increasing communication with the student body, improving transportation services around campus and Pittsburgh, and working with the Graduate Student Association (GSA), the debates revealed the pragmatic versus idealistic differences between the two tickets.   
With three years of experience as a CIT student senator, Flittner talked in terms of practicality and details, sharing stories about his past projects as well as explaining future programs he hopes to implement if elected.  
“During my years in student government, I’ve been exposed to a wide array of problems on campus. My prior roles have given me the background knowledge necessary to work on these issues,” said Flittner. “Although I’ve enjoyed my past roles, I have been limited by the responsibilities that they have entailed. By being student body president, I will have the opportunity to create the solutions and implement them to improve Carnegie Mellon.”
Likewise, Flittner’s running mate Sharma stressed her experience in various campus organizations and detailed programs to implement if elected.
“We are the best candidates, because our partnership will be the most effective at implementing initiatives,” summarized Flittner.   
In contrast, Alcoser and Briggs, who have not held any positions in student government, focused more on the larger ideals that they would bring to the administration and connecting those ideals with the general student body. “Our outside involvement in things like The Tartan, being an RA, and being involved in Tri Delta and Delta Tau Delta fraternities have taught us about leadership and values, things outside of student government that hold true and should hold true in student government,” said Alcoser. “We live those ideals through our platform.”
The differences between the two tickets’ approaches became most apparent when they were debating issues that they agreed upon, but for slightly different reasons. For example, one audience member posed to both candidates, “Why should graduate students care about undergraduate student government?”
While Alcoser came to the conclusion that “It’s every student’s civic responsibility to know who their leaders are,” in contrast, Flittner stated, “The best work that has been done ... was done by committees and task forces that have been led by the student body president or vice president that brought both GSA members and Student Senate members together to work on full campus initiatives.”
But while both tickets can agree that graduate students should care about the undergraduate student government, the candidates ran into disagreement over the issue of encouraging diversity.
“It sounds bad, but incentives are important to students, and we have to incentivize diversity,” Sharma said. Flittner and Sharma plan to implement a Cultural Diversity Honors program to recognize and encourage commitments to learning about other cultures. “By giving them incentives, students will feel this need to go to all different types of events throughout their four years here, so that by the time they graduate, we will award them with a stole and a certificate,” said Sharma.
“Our ideas follow the principle that meaningful engagement with cultural organizations is key to increasing diversity,” said Alcoser. “It’s not about going to events and it’s not about getting a point. It’s not about getting a certificate of honor. It’s something that you should find honor in within yourself.”
Candidate My Le, a junior business administration major, ran uncontested for the position of student body vice president for finance. Her main platform consists of a pledge to increase collaboration between the Committee on Student Organizations (CoSO) and the Joint Funding Committee.
Candidates for student body vice president of organizations Will Zhang, a junior computer science major, and Varun Deshpande, a sophomore in the Mellon College of Science, met the following day to debate. 
Although both candidates agreed on several issues, such as the need for more interaction between student organizations and representatives on CoSO, Zhang and Desphande differ in terms of experience and on the issue of space management.  
Zhang described himself as the most qualified and experienced candidate for the job. “My wide range of experience in student government allows me to understand the system, its workings, and its limitations,” said Zhang, who, in addition to his three years as a Student Senator, has also taken leadership roles in a variety of student organizations, including the Association for Computing Machinery, Zeta Beta Tau fraternity, and the All University Orchestra. 
“My active roles in these organizations have allowed me to experience what it’s like to run an organization and the problems student leaders face.”
Desphande took a different approach from his opponent, driving forward the issues and his platform, but also being candid about his own personal shortcomings. 
“I’ve been involved in the whole gambit of student organizations, including — well, to be honest, my involvement [during] sophomore year has been a little more withdrawn. Let’s just call it the ‘sophomore slump,’ ” joked Deshpande, who, like Zhang, also has experience in student government and has taken leadership roles in a variety of student organizations, including the International Student Union and Deewane, the university South Asian a cappella troupe. 
“It’s been a little more withdrawn, but I believe my involvement in all kinds of organizations ... has really given me an overarching view of the way organizations function and what they need.”
However, when asked the question of what made him the best candidate, Deshpande positioned himself against Zhang on the issue of space management. 
“My initiatives take into account one thing that his don’t, which is space management,” Deshpande said. “With the limited amount of space on campus, while there is only so much you can do ... I can advocate for student organizations to have more space in the campus master plan.”
With plans to increase student organization real estate factored into his platform, Deshpande took a more lenient approach than Zhang did on the formation of new student organizations. 
“CoSO should recognize new organizations so long as there’s not a complete overlap with another organization’s mission statement,” argued Desphande. “Let an organization find out whether they can be success or a failure all on their own.”
Zhang argued that with so many student organizations competing for limited space on campus, new organizations should only be recognized if they offer something unique. 
“I am a realist, and we currently do have over 250 student organizations. With very limited space and very limited resources, we don’t want three very similar organizations,” Zhang said. “I want to give opportunities to everyone to be in organizations and be a part of organizations that they have a passion for, but I do have to be realistic.”

Every 10 years, Carnegie Mellon is required to produce a 10-year development master plan that will serve as a guide for future campus projects. Carnegie Mellon’s current master plan is poised to expire. As such, the Campus Design and Facility Development department has been hard at work creating another one, which they have recently released to students and the general public. The plan serves as a flexible array of possible construction projects and new building additions that, with a solid source of funding, the campus administration is interested in pursuing.
According to Ralph Horgan, the associate vice provost of Campus Design, one of the main goals of this master plan is to “increase connectivity among current real estate” so that students can easily move across campus and between buildings. Another key goal is to “preserve and enhance the iconic core” that Horgan sees as having provided the school with so much value throughout the years.
The previous master plan included innovations such as the addition of the Gates Hillman Complex to campus. Possible building transformations that are in the current plan include an expanded University Center, an addition to Margaret Morrison for the College of Fine Arts, and more classrooms in Heinz College.
The opinion of Bob Reppe, the director of design, is that one potential change the campus should be most excited about is moving the Tepper School of Business from Posner Hall and the GSIA building to the current location of the Morewood parking lot. Spring Carnival is a common concern among students about this potential change. Carnival has been located in the parking lot for years; moving the Tepper school to the parking lot would ultimately change the carnival’s spot. Reppe addressed this concern by pointing out that Carnival has been moved three times in the past; there are many possible locations for it to move to, such as the Cut, and its current location is not going out of service anytime soon.
The most immediate change that students can expect is the elimination of a lane on each side of Forbes Avenue. These car lanes will be replaced with bike lanes. This is because it is a “minor investment to get a big effect,” according to Reppe. The change has the potential to come out within the next 18 months. The purpose of these changes to Forbes Avenue is not only to make the road safer for pedestrians by making traffic speeds more uniform, but also to “embrace Forbes as the main street of campus.” In the past, Forbes Avenue has acted as a barrier on the edge of campus. Today, Carnegie Mellon has multiple properties across the street, so a goal of this change is to reduce the degree to which it acts as a barrier.
Another addition to campus is a new research facility to be located near Wean and Hamerschlag Hall. This new building is much more likely to be built than other campus improvements, as it already has a source for funding.
Although Carnegie Mellon is obligated to design a master plan, it is not obligated to build anything because of it. However, if a major change is not on the master plan, it is significantly more difficult to enact. According to the Campus Design and Facility Development website, being “flexible and responsive to opportunities” is an important paradigm guiding future campus development.
Correction (4/14/11): The attached map has been updated to reflect a more recent version of the master plan.

This past spring break, a group of Carnegie Mellon students began a week-long immersion into the university’s Qatar campus in order to experience the academic, cultural, and social experiences that it offers. The IMPAQT (Initiating Meaningful Pittsburgh and Qatar Ties) program has sponsored eight student leaders every year since 2008 to spend a week in Qatar. Students attended classes, explored local markets and historical sites, built friendships with students and faculty, and brought back memories to share with the rest of Pittsburgh. 
The 2011 students were Daniel Chow, a junior industrial design major; Arjun Katragadda, a sophomore dual business administration and decision science major; Jennifer Major, a junior psychology major; Jessamyn Miller, a graduate communications and design major; Sara Mouhktar, a sophomore psychology major; Crismely (Cris) Peña, a first-year mechanical engineering major; and Andrès Vèlez, a first-year economics major. Jennifer McNabb, a chaperone from the Office of International Education, accompanied the students on the trip.
Carnegie Mellon’s Qatar campus is located in Education City, an academic community on the edge of Doha, and offers three majors in business administration, information systems, and computer science. In addition to Carnegie Mellon students, Education City features over 1,300 students of more than 70 nationalities from various universities on a 2,500 acre campus. English serves as a common language among citizens and foreigners. In the country itself, less than a third of the population is Qatari, while the remainder are expatriates who have come to live, work, or study in Qatar, according to the students. “A lot of parents do not want their children too far away for college, and the only opportunity to go to a real college, especially for the girls, is to go to Education City,” said Vèlez. 
As the eight arrived in Qatar, they immediately noticed how welcoming the students were. 
Student guides took time out of their academic and religious schedules to accompany the visiting students to activities throughout the city. Mouhktar emphasized “how warmly we were welcomed and the general courtesy of everyone.” Carnegie Mellon’s Qatar students were also very open to answer any questions about their classes, religion in their lives, and social relationships. As Miller noted, “We attended the Global Islam class, and one of Dr. Kaba’s points is that Islam is not homogeneous and every Muslim is not the same. There are so many countries, and each practices in its own way.”
On the first day, students drank traditional karak, or milk tea with spices, while meeting with Qatar students.
On campus, they painted the benches as a link to painting the Pittsburgh campus’s Fence. The students also attended a “Big Questions Dinner” program, a Qalta meeting (a Summit-like program), a photography club lecture, a tour of the future residence hall construction site, and the Doha Debates Forum. They also got a sneak peak at the Carnegie Mellon Pittsburgh room, which will complement the Qatar Room currently being prepared in Resnik Cafe.
When the group traveled off campus, the students visited the traditional Souq Wakif market in Doha; the Museum of Islamic Art; the Modern Art Museum; the Katara Cultural Village; the Emir’s equestrian facility Al-Shaqab, which includes world-renowned Arabian horses; and the FANAR Islamic Cultural Center. They also enjoyed a dhow boat trip with other students. 
On the dhow boat, owned by a student, Katragadda and Chow commented that, “At first it felt awkward because we felt like we were intruding on their vacation, but then we began to break the ice when they started traditional Qatari dances. They did some traditional dancing and played the oud, so we showed them our dances like the electric slide, macarena, and bhangra. We alternated between their dances and our dances.”
One of the missions of the IMPAQT group, upon returning to the Pittsburgh campus, is to spread the message of the Qatar campus and encourage stronger connections between the two campuses. 
“One of the reasons the Office of International Education runs this program is because we do see it as a great way to create closer ties between the campuses. It is a true exchange ... and the program allows students to serve as ambassadors and take back information that others would want to know,” said Melissa Dechamps, director of the International Office of Education in Qatar and a longtime collaborator with the IMPAQT program. 
On April 12 at 10:30 a.m. EST, both campuses will experience communication with the unveiling of the Qatar Room in Pittsburgh and the reciprocal Pittsburgh Room in Qatar. On the day of the opening, there will be footage from the IMPAQT group as well as live video of Doha’s International Week.
Located in Resnik, the room will feature videoconferencing capability during dining hours, a blend of modern and traditional Qatari art, gifts from the student IMPAQT groups, and more events as the room is finished. 
Kim Abel, the director of Housing and Dining Services, has been involved with the construction of the room from the very beginning. When determining the location of the room, the goal was to place it in a common area. “We looked at how it would promote the IMPAQT program, [and] continue to develop interactions with one another from different campuses, and that is really what the intention of the room design was,” said Abel.
For any students interested in the IMPAQT program, applications will be available in early fall 2011. 
The IMPAQT group had a blog running during their stay in Qatar, www.qatarburgh.com, and they hope that students will visit the site to learn more about their day-to-day adventures in Education City and Doha.

TEDxCMU’s 2011 conference was held in McConomy Auditorium Sunday. TEDx, which stands for “independently organized TED event,” is an offshoot of the Technology, Entertainment, and Design conference (TED) series. TED brings together speakers on a wide variety of topics to give lectures, which are available for free online. TEDx events gather speakers on a local level and are organized by individual communities, schools, or organizations. Nine Carnegie Mellon students organized this year’s event, the team led by senior biological sciences major James Pan. This is the second TEDx event at Carnegie Mellon; the first was held last year.  
Many of the event’s attendees found TEDx through TED.
“TED, of course, is really famous,” said Ranjani Kumar, a master’s student in information systems management. “I remember the year before I started here, hearing a couple of seniors talking, saying [TEDx] is really good, and you shouldn’t miss this.”
According to a TEDxCMU press release, the theme of this year’s conference was “ImPossible,” which “challenges speakers to turn that which seems impossible into the possible.” Eight people spoke at the conference: Amber Rae, Mickey McManus, William Gahl, Michaelene Risley, Charlie Hoehn, Jacob Cass, Jenny Blake, and Carnegie Mellon professor Luis von Ahn. Paul Dateh and Kevin Belcher performed. The event was hosted by drama professor Michael Chemers. 
Though only 400 seats were available for the event, TEDxCMU’s website reported that organizers received 909 ticket requests. In keeping with TED’s motto of “ideas worth spreading,” the lectures were available streaming online for people who could not get tickets. “It’s important for us to reach a large demographic here in Pittsburgh through various mediums and using the latest technology so no one misses out on this amazing event,” said Jeesoo Sohn, a sophomore music major on TEDx’s publicity team.
Blake, a self-professed ‘self-help junkie,’ spoke about “what’s possible for creating freedom in your life and your work.” Blake’s lecture pointed out the deficiencies in the traditional “career ladder” paradigm.
“It’s so linear; it’s very fixed,” Blake said. “It’s either straight up or off into oblivion.” It also, according to Blake, creates a false impression that there is a fixed endpoint at which a person’s career stops changing. In reality, said Blake, “CEOs, presidents, people at the top of the game, they still want to grow, they still want to learn, they still want to develop, even at the peak of their careers.” Instead of a career ladder, Blake suggested the metaphor of a ‘career smart phone,’ on which people fluidly download the ‘apps’ that they need at any given time. She emphasized that people don’t have to know exactly where they’ll end up in order to make positive progress.
Glenn Willen, a Carnegie Mellon alumnus with a B.S. in computer science who now works for Google Pittsburgh, enjoyed Blake’s lecture. “I’ve been out of CMU now for three and a half years,” said Willen. “I’ve been trying to figure out where I’m going. If nothing else, it was just inspiration to hear that I don’t have to know everything yet.”
In contrast, Cass was firm in his belief that people who want to advance must know their goals. Cass is a graphic designer who, he said, built his career partially on his strong Internet presence. He spoke on “building a personal foundation, using branding, blogging, and social media.” Cass explained how to design one’s website, blog, and general online presence so as to advance a career. Where Blake spoke about general career philosophy, Cass focused on specific details that people could use to make their websites better, such as putting photographs next to testimonials, which he said increases believability.
Von Ahn’s lecture was particularly popular. Described by Chemers as “the great, wild U.S. marshal of the Internet,” von Ahn spoke about his crowdsourcing initiatives. He is the inventor of CAPTCHAs — the distorted words that Internet users have to type in order to buy tickets and create accounts on social network sites. CAPTCHAs prove that it is a human at the keyboard, preventing people from using scripts to, for example, buy thousands of tickets to a concert, two at a time. According to von Ahn, people spend an average of 500,000 hours every day typing in CAPTCHAs.
Von Ahn then created reCAPTCHA, which puts the time being spent by Internet users to good use. With reCAPTCHA, people can simultaneously prove that they are human and digitize old books. The distorted words presented by reCAPTCHA are actually old printed text which computers cannot parse. Every time a user types a word into reCAPTCHA, he or she is digitizing it. According to von Ahn, 100 million words a day are digitized by over 750 million distinct people — in other words, 2.5 million books a year are being digitized by over 10 percent of the world’s population.
“It is numbers like these that motivate my research agenda,” said von Ahn. Prior to the Internet, he said, even the most major projects, such as the one which put a man on the moon, involved at most 100,000 people. “Coordinating more than 100,000 people, let alone paying them, was essentially impossible,” he said. But the Internet has changed that. “If we can put a man on the moon with 100,000 [people], what can we do with 100 million?”
Von Ahn has the answer. With his newest project, DuoLingo, which has not yet launched, he hopes to translate the Internet. In the process of learning a foreign language for free, people would be able to translate real-world content. When all the beginners’ translations are combined, said von Ahn, they are as accurate as that of a paid translator.
“It’s sort of a slice of the future,” Willen said. “It’s going to be really interesting to follow up on.”

Staff Council sponsors event for staff and faculty children
Every year, Staff Council sponsors a “Take Our Daughters and Sons to Work” day for the faculty members’ children between the ages of 8 and 15. 
This year’s event will take place on April 28, with a theme of “Inventing the Future.”
The day will be filled with various sessions, including “Snake Robots” with robotics professor Howie Choset; “Brain Imaging,” in which participants will get to see how a magnetic resonance imaging machine works; and “Electric Car,” a session in which attendees will get a look at Carnegie Mellon’s electric car and how gasoline-powered cars can be converted to electric power. 
These sessions will begin at 1:30 p.m. with a lunch gathering preceding the afternoon events and programs.
“Designed to be more than a career day, the ‘Take Our Daughters And Sons To Work’ program goes beyond the average ‘shadow’ an adult,” said Carolyn McKecuen, president of the Take Our Daughters and Sons to Work Foundation. “Exposing girls and boys to what a parent or mentor in their lives does during the work day is important, but showing them the value of their education ... and providing them an opportunity to share how they envision the future and begin steps toward their end goals in a hands-on and interactive environment is key to their achieving success.”
New lecture series presents talk on women in business
Nelle Nugent, a producer and general manager of Broadway and off-Broadway shows, will be the inaugural lecturer of Carnegie Mellon’s Sylvia and David Steiner Speaker Series at 4:30 p.m. this Friday. The lecture will be held in the Philip Chosky Theatre, located in Purnell, with a reception immediately following.
The new speaker series, endowed by Sylvia and David Steiner, will feature leaders in the arts, culture, and entertainment industries.
The lecture, titled “Nobody knows anything... including me!”, is inspired by William Goldman’s memoir Adventures in the Screen Trade. Nugent plans to use the premise of the memoir as a launching point for discussing her experiences as a producer of theater, film, and television.
Nugent has received recognition for her work as a producer; she has worked on Tony Award-winning shows such as Amadeus.  She is a dedicated member of the Broadway League as well as the Academy of Television Arts and Sciences, serving as a chair of the subcommittee for funding the league’s Education Committee program. Nugent was also a board member of the American Women’s Economic Development Corporation, a non-profit organization dedicated to teaching business skills to women.

Carnegie Mellon students rely on public transportation for their travel needs; first-years especially need the buses because they are not allowed to have cars on campus. However, due to persistent funding shortages, the Port Authority of Allegheny County (PAT) made significant service cuts last week. Here are some details on the cuts:
30: number of routes eliminated on March 27
79: number of routes with schedule or routing changes
220,000: average number of riders per day on PAT services
$300 million: operating budget for PAT approved in November 2010

In this year’s student body elections we are not enthusiastic about either platform. However, some of each ticket’s ideas sounded realistic and pertinent. Last year, The Tartan decided not to endorse any candidate for student body president, and this year we choose to do the same.
Alcoser and Briggs:
Presidential candidate Turi Alcoser and vice presidential candidate Kelsey Briggs are focusing heavily on their Mind, Body, and Wellness initiative. Although stress is a major issue on campus, many of Alcoser and Briggs’ proposals seemed redundant or unfeasible. While the intentions behind creating “Reflection Rooms” as quiet places for de-stressing are admirable, the idea comes off as impractical and would likely take up space that could be put to better use. In addition, most open spaces on campus are utilized primarily as study rooms, and we feel that these would be no different.
Alcoser and Briggs’ Healthy Rewards program again seems to have good intentions, but the creation of more incentives to promote healthy living is already being tackled by health initiatives in the university’s health services and athletics departments. Expanding on such programs is an admirable goal, yet we believe this should be done through communication with administrative and student organizations that are already involved in student health.
Alcoser and Briggs also discussed giving Counseling and Psychological Services (CAPS) a more positive image. We feel students aren’t taking advantage of the services that CAPS has to offer until they have a serious emotional or psychological problem. Another strong program Alcoser and Briggs mentioned is a lecture series that will focus on health, wellness, and stress. This lecture series has great potential and we see it as very practical and realistic project.
Flittner and Sharma:
On the other side of the debate, presidential candidate Jake Flittner and vice presidential candidate Sangita Sharma’s platform has focused on improving programs that are already underway. However, their new initiatives seem unreasonable. Sharma’s Friday Frenzy is a close relative of the current presidential administration’s unimplemented CMU Connect socials, and we feel that it would be doomed to the same unremarkable fate. Flittner and Sharma’s proposed Cultural Diversity Honors awards are especially ridiculous and potentially offensive. Diversity isn’t a quantifiable activity that should utilize a points system.
Flittner and Sharma also addressed transportation, an important and timely campus issue, as one of their main campaign points. We agree that communication with President Cohon and gathering feedback from students about transportation are both vital, but one idea in particular stood out as far-fetched. They proposed a Tartan Taxi to aid student transportation late at night. This seems like an unreasonable and unachievable solution to transportation issues, and beyond student government control. A more realistic and attainable solution might be to gather student feedback and create a dialogue between President Cohon and the student body about transportation.
We are glad that both candidates stressed the lack of visibility around campus in the recent past and that this is something they wish to remedy. Flittner and Sharma pushed a number of ideas in their debate responses. The Business Affairs Transparency Report, for example, would make public the administrative changes going on in student finances. Both candidates stressed that they would work toward better advertising campaigns as well as make themselves available on campus. In the end, communication and transparency are key to implementing all the changes these candidates propose. 
We hope that, whichever tickets are elected, they will hold themselves to these promises­­ — and that communication will improve between student government and the student body.

Carnegie Mellon’s student body voting process to elect a new student government, which ends this Tuesday, includes a referendum on the Collegiate Readership Program. This program is a USA Today nationwide initiative to “promote civic literacy and global awareness” on college campuses, as stated on its website.
We strongly urge students to support this referendum. 
As an organization that is devoted to keeping students well informed about both campus and world news, we believe this program is an important asset to the university and helps students to be literate and globally aware.
The program at Carnegie Mellon provides students with free copies of The New York Times, USA Today, and The Pittsburgh Post-Gazette at multiple locations throughout campus. Every few years, student government conducts a survey, this time via a referendum, to assess how interested the student body is in keeping the Collegiate Readership Program active on campus. 
The program is surprisingly cheap, only $5 per semester per student, and is paid for by the undergraduate media fee.
It is still important to have newspapers available in print even when they are generally available online. Although newspapers are increasingly depending on the Internet, they are also finding ways to make online users pay for access to content. The New York Times, for example, is putting up a paywall on its website where users will have to subscribe and pay a fee, and other newspapers are sure to follow.
The majority of a student’s time is spent studying in cubicles, putting together elaborate projects, doing research, or working. With the continuation of the Collegiate Readership Program, students can still get news virtually for free from a reliable source, and won’t have to stare at a computer screen to do it.

Jake Flittner and Sangita Sharma’s platform includes ideas that the university is already in the process of executing: creating a Campus Police night watch to improve safety on campus, adding GPS units to all of the Carnegie Mellon shuttle buses, and improving athletic and performance facilities. This last initiative was just published as part of the University’s 10 Year Plan. Jake, a veteran in student government, must have known this — why does he pass off these ideas as original? 
While I’m glad to hear that Jake and Sangita are supportive of these initiatives, the university will see them through whether or not Jake and Sangita are elected. More significantly, Jake and Sangita are dishonest to present those ideas as their own.
They do have original ideas in their platform, but those ideas are largely unrealistic. A glaring example of this is their Diversity Honors Program. The idea that we can quantify diversity with a point system is unfeasible, presumptuous, and offensive. Furthermore, the narrow focus of the program, which includes only “cultural events created by ethnic groups on campus,” reveals the candidates’ own narrow-mindedness. Why should we choose to define diversity as only ethnic differences and ignore areas such as religious diversity, socioeconomic diversity, and diversity of interests? There is so much value in exploring all of these differences and learning from them.
Turi Alcoser and Kelsey Briggs have displayed a more inclusive philosophy. Throughout their platform, they focus on the quality of interaction between the diverse members of our community — not the “quantity.” For example, their platform includes a plan to improve graduate-undergraduate collaboration. Jake and Sangita do not mention graduate students in their platform. The student body president and vice president are obligated to represent both graduate students and undergrads, and graduate student voters should take note of the candidates whose platforms reflect this obligation.
So yes, Jake is the most experienced candidate when it comes to student government. However, voters should consider whether experience is really what matters when it comes to choosing the best student body president. I encourage everyone to check out the candidates’ websites. 
Most importantly, please make sure to vote. You should have a say in who represents you.

Japan continues to suffer through the aftereffects of the earthquake that devastated the Sendai area on Friday, March 11. The tsunami it triggered caused even more destruction, and the residents of northern Japan are faced with a potential nuclear disaster in the Fukushima prefecture. Japan is, in general, well-equipped to deal with natural disasters — the country is located on the edge of a tectonic plate, so earthquakes are a fact of life. In fact, Japan’s meteorological agency records several daily earthquakes that are too small to be felt. Because of this, measures like earthquake-safe building codes and tsunami gates in coastal towns are commonplace safety measures. Although the magnitude of the destruction and death caused by the recent disasters was great, these precautions ensured that the effects were not even worse.
I was studying abroad at Temple University’s Tokyo Campus when the first quake hit. Even in Tokyo where it was comparatively mild, the Japanese I talked with following that Friday said it was the strongest quake they’d ever felt. The school called off classes for the afternoon as everyone tried to find their way home. Growing concerns about the threat from the nuclear plant in Fukushima led to another week of canceled classes; finally, the school terminated its study abroad program altogether and made those students return home. In fact, I’m still waiting for classes to start again; Temple is working to set up online classes for its students so that they can still receive credit for the semester. 
That week of canceled classes for me was a learning experience in wading through the mainstream media’s spin on the situation. Many students in my apartment building were living in states of near-panic because of the crisis at the nuclear plant, a situation that is still evolving now. And depending on where their information came from, their reactions were not surprising — American media coverage of the crisis ranged from apocalyptic to even more apocalyptic. Many headlines played on the knowledge that most Americans couldn’t find Fukushima, Sendai, or Tokyo on a map of Japan if they tried; they made it seem like all of Japan was experiencing the radioactive aftereffects of the fires and other problems at the plant rather than just the immediate vicinity in Fukushima. One article with a wildly inflammatory title admitted at first that the situation wasn’t bad yet, but went on to list all the potential disasters that could result from a nuclear meltdown in gruesome detail.
It was difficult to reconcile the calm atmosphere that surrounded me with what I was reading about online. Tokyo dwellers seemed to be going about business as usual; the only outward sign that anything was wrong was that all of the instant food (ramen and the like) had disappeared from the stores. There was no rioting or looting. Borough-specific rolling blackouts were instituted so that power could be redirected to the areas hard-hit by the earthquake, and people seemed to just work around it. It was nothing like the fear-laden nuclear holocaust that my family and friends back home thought I was experiencing. I’ve been told that fear sells better than sex in the news; however, I can only hope that reporting on this and other natural disasters loses its rampant sensationalism in the future.

The Internet is slowly becoming a battleground of privacy issues and other bureaucratic “red tape” regulations. Facebook, the infamous social networking site, has begun building a defense against any potential policy attacks. By luring former White House members and Congressional representatives to its communications and legal teams, the site is making an obvious move to protect itself.
Facebook’s befriending of Washington has not gone unnoticed. Many political and legal analysts applaud the company’s shift toward having more political figures on its team. “What they’re doing is pragmatic, and it’s pragmatic to do it sooner rather than later,” said Paul M. Schwartz, a law professor at the University of California, Berkeley, in a recent New York Times article. Facebook executives realize the importance of gaining connections with Washington elites; those elites are the ones who have the power to stop others from attacking Facebook with regulations and new policies.
This new policy of cozying up with Washington executives is a direct result of new Internet privacy issues.
According to a Times article, “Facebook’s march into Washington began in late 2007 shortly after its CEO, Mark Zuckerberg, unveiled Beacon, a program that allowed users to see granular details of the online behavior of their Facebook ‘friends.’ Privacy experts, particularly on Capitol Hill, fumed.” It seems to me that all of Facebook’s current and future legal troubles will be a result of privacy policies. The article further stated, “The company’s growth in Washington came as the White House, Congress, the Federal Trade Commission, and several states separately moved to toughen Internet privacy laws.” Privacy is undoubtedly becoming a more important issue to tackle with the rise of the Internet.
The influence of the Internet is expanding so quickly that our government’s laws and regulations barely have time to keep up. Facebook, in particular, is permeating our everyday lives at an exponential rate. There is rarely a moment that we are not updating our statuses with our thoughts, “checking in” at a location, or sending out mass online invitations to events. These acts alone are enough to let any of our “friends” know everything going on in our lives. However, to further this lack of privacy, the website also saves our information and sends it out to other websites. For example, an account on Pandora, the free music website, has a direct connection to a user’s Facebook account and information. This connection allows you to see what songs your “friends” like and if you have any in common.
If we stop to think about this, it’s a little creepy. Having all of your information sent out to the unbound Internet is intimidating; it’s an invasion in the simplest sense. Internet privacy advocate groups have been growing in numbers in recent years. Multiple sites dedicated to safe Internet use have been uploaded. Groups such as these are also marching to Washington, spreading their ideas and messages. The debate is a growing issue that will surely determine how we use the Internet in the future.
Executives at Facebook realize this Internet privacy revolution is brewing, of course. Hence their decision to hire so many Washington politicos. In the aforementioned New York Times article, Marne Levine, a former Obama administration official who joined Facebook as vice president of global public policy, said, “We are looking for people who are passionate about Facebook, who understand and can anticipate policy issues, and who are good at explaining those issues.” To me, this is concrete evidence of a defensive legal strategy.
Although I applaud Facebook executives for anticipating such issues and reacting so quickly, I can’t help but question whether this is a socially beneficial move. Obviously, Facebook benefits from gaining White House members. The company can build essential connections to other White House elites and thus gain serious political power and leverage. These are the connections Washington operates on; without them, no organization has a chance of advancing its political agenda. On the other hand, this does not really benefit those actually using Facebook. Without any separation of third-party corporations and government, there is no freedom from bias. There is no objectivity in deciding regulations and laws. How can a fair law that benefits the majority, rather than the company, come from this system? It does not seem safe to me that the company in question, Facebook, is essentially in charge of determining future privacy policies and regulations. It is a total conflict of interest.
In the New York Times article, Chris Jay Hoofnagle, director of privacy programs at the Center for Law and Technology at the University of California, Berkeley, said that politically connected executives would not only be granted audiences with government officials to discuss substantive issues but, in the case of elected officials, would also have the chance to reinforce the idea that Facebook can be a powerful campaign tool. This will make it incredibly difficult for privacy advocate groups to have a chance of fighting Facebook’s political agenda. Consequently, not every opinion on the subject of privacy will be given a fair hearing, and the ensuing policies will be biased.
This is not democratic. This is not American. This is not just. It is a sad truth that our government operates this way, and, quite frankly, I think it’s the exact opposite of what the Founding Fathers intended for this nation’s future.

Drug policy in the United States is a topic of major concern. Each year, the government spends billions of dollars to deter citizens from drug-related activities, but the question of how to efficiently allocate these funds is still in debate. 
Currently, government resources are focused on punishing users, paying for social services like rehabilitation facilities, and employing forces to carry out drug busts. The existing U.S policy of criminalization is expensive, ineffective, and borderline unnecessary.
In contrast, research studies in other countries prove that deregulation with regard to drugs is a beneficial set of policies to adopt. Instead of punishing violators, the solution to minimizing drug use lies in funding education and awareness programs to educate the public about the short- and long-term effects of drugs.
Marijuana is a very controversial drug because of its reputation as one of the three “gateway drugs,” the other two being alcohol and tobacco. Studies conducted by the National Center on Addiction and Substance Abuse (CASA) support the idea that marijuana is a gateway drug, a substance with moderately harmful effects that can lead to the use of more dangerous, addictive, and typically illegal drugs like cocaine, LSD, and heroin. Among 12- to 17-year-olds, those who had used one gateway drug in the prior month were also 30 times more likely to use another one. 
Marijuana has a very negative image in society, but most people can’t identify why marijuana is illegal when asked to consider at the same time why alcohol and cigarettes are not illegal as well. In fact, the Independent Scientific Committee on Drugs in California conducted a study on 20 different drugs that analyzed the drugs’ effects based on users’ physical and mental health, social implications, and economic costs. This research concluded that on a scale measuring the negative effects of these substances, alcohol had the most negative effects. Yet the  source of so much social distress is a regulated substance.
Clearly, there is a misalignment in government policy. The current policy of criminalizing users isn’t beneficial to individuals, society, or the economy. Looking at the hard facts about the physical and social effects of marijuana, it is rightfully labeled as a gateway drug and should be associated with tobacco and alcohol. Two out of the three substances have been legalized and turned into booming commercial industries that generate high taxes for the government, while the third is illegal.
The government does have a moral obligation to discourage the use of marijuana; however, it should not be outlawed. For most of its history, marijuana has been a legal substance. In fact, it wasn’t until 1913 that the first laws against the drug were enacted because of social tension between Mexicans and Americans. The Mexican revolution led to an influx of immigration and an increase in unemployment in the United States. One of the distinguishing factors of Mexican immigrants at that time was their propensity to smoke and grow marijuana. For this reason, California was the first to outlaw the plant. 
This trend quickly spread to Wyoming (1915), Texas (1919), Iowa (1923), Nevada (1923), Oregon (1923), Washington (1923), Arkansas (1923), and Nebraska (1927). Harry J. Anslinger, the director of the Federal Bureau of Narcotics, also had a large influence on marijuana laws. He and William Randolph Hearst created a great deal of the hype surrounding the negative effects of marijuana by making false, outlandish allegations that associated marijuana with lunacy, promiscuity, and violence. Hearst wrote, “Was it marijuana, the new Mexican drug, that nerved the murderous arm of Clara Phillips when she hammered out her victim’s life in Los Angeles...? Three fourths of the crime of violence in this country today are committed by dope slaves — that is a matter of cold record.” Clearly, the evidence behind the illegalization of marijuana was far from sound.
It would be in the government’s best interest to decriminalize marijuana, which has the capacity to generate a large amount of tax revenue. A study by Gieringer indicates that the legalization of marijuana could save the government $6 billion to $9 billon per year in narcotics enforcement, and raise anywhere from $6 billion to $10 billion per year in the hemp industry, not including the revenue generated by spinoff industries. Decriminalization of marijuana is a course of action that has shown success in states like Massachusetts, and countries such as the Netherlands, Portugal, and more recently, the UK. 
The way to combat negative marijuana use is through education. Similar to alcohol and tobacco, the most effective policy for controlling drug use lies in lowering the demand for the drug market. Educating children and adults about the negative effects of drugs is the best way to reduce consumption, and government resources should be reallocated so that more revenue is focused on spreading awareness.

Time to change your signature on your e-mail to something more fun. Instead of your name and major, why not put your personal likes and dislikes and your relationship status?
It is your job this week to push your friends toward majors they are not suited for.
Whatever you’re thinking while reading this, you might want to rethink it.
Though talking to your homework helps you to get it done, be mindful of your surroundings. Talking to your homework in your room is a good thing; talking to your homework while in the UC, not so much.
Ease up on the photo tagging this week. Some people don’t want others to know how they spent their weekend.
Jeggings are not jeans, no matter how much detail you add to them. Real pockets and realistic zippers do not equal real pants, so don’t go out underdressed this week.
If you feel like saying something mean this week, laugh instead. If your group partner tells you that they just lost your lab notebook with over 20 hours worth of work in it, just laugh your anger away.
Beware of secret cameras installed by your subordinates. It will be easy to find the ones in your room and office, but the one in your backpack will be much harder to find.
Create your own class for next semester called “The World according to Google Doodles,” in which each class is spent analyzing and exploring the history behind each Google Doodle.
Sorry, not even I have a clue how this week is going to turn out for you.
Not all babies can be YouTube stars, so next time you see a toddler doing something cute or funny, don’t rush over to his or her parents pretending to be a casting agent.
Throw caution to the wind: Delete your Google Calendar.
