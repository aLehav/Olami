With the end of that big football game last week, the NBA All-Star Game is approaching quickly, and with it comes the year’s widely anticipated All-Star selections. 
Amid cries that players were stiffed out of well-deserved All-Star appearances, a group of very deserving candidates ended up receiving spots in the game. There is also a group of head-scratchers that truly don’t belong. So, as the yearly debate over who got snubbed rages on, here’s my two cents.
Let’s start with the Western Conference, since it’s far easier to identify which spots should be vacated. It’s almost impossible to say someone was cheated out of a spot when trying to dissect the extremely talented West, since there is a list of about 20 players who could fill the 12 remaining spots left. The only player who does not belong on this All-Star roster, based on play this season, is Kobe Bryant, and that’s only due to an injury.  
Unfortunately, Los Angeles Clippers reserve guard Chris Paul might also miss the game due to an injury, leaving two spots that might open up. Since both players are guards, the two reserves will likely be guards.
However, since there is one spot on the roster that can be either a frontcourt or backcourt player, it is possible that one guard and one frontcourt player will be added to the mix.  
There are four candidates who truly deserve these last two spots. One is Memphis Grizzlies guard Michael Conley. He has played fantastically on the offensive end this season, keeping afloat a Grizzlies offense that has been stagnant over the past few years, even with the absence of center Marc Gasol. What the team has lost in Gasol’s high post-passing they have regained in Conley’s excellent season at the point. 
Conley ranks near the top of the league in both Player Efficiency Rating (PER) and Offensive Win Shares, which are statistics that show how well he has played using a massive volume of the team’s possessions, taking care of the basketball, and taking — and making — good shots. While his defense this year has worsened, his notable offensive uptick has carried a flawed team, plagued by injuries and an awful start, to compete for a playoff berth in the West.
Another deserving candidate is Phoenix Suns guard Goran Dragic. The Suns are one of the NBA’s best stories this year.  Despite preseason predictions that this team was tanking and playing for a draft pick, Jeff Hornacek’s stellar coaching and guard Eric Bledsoe’s development have turned this team into a legitimate playoff threat. In addition to Bledsoe, Dragic, who was known for so long as an excellent backup point guard, was having the best season of his career. Many people thought the Suns of Anarchy, as fans affectionately call them, were doomed when Bledsoe sat out for an undisclosed amount of time due to a meniscus injury. 
These people were wrong. Dragic has been an unstoppable force since taking over as full-time point guard, being near the top of the league in points and assists per game, field goal percentage, PER, win shares, and win shares per 48 minutes. After his massive amount of playing time, it’s time to consider Dragic one of the best guards in the NBA. His defense is above average and very few point guards in the league are actually good defenders, so he gets points for positional scarcity. 
Forget one of the two possible vacancies — Dragic easily deserved the nod above Portland Trail Blazers point guard Damien Lillard. Lillard is having an excellent season and deserves to be an All-Star, but with limited spots, Dragic’s superior offensive and defensive season should rank above Lillard’s impressive clutch shooting. 
It’s splitting hairs at this point, but denying the 47 minutes of star basketball that Dragic provides the Suns in favor of the one minute of superstardom that Lillard provides the Trailblazers seems unfair. Dragic might still make the All-Star Game if Chris Paul is unable to play, but Paul is one of the top five talents in the league, and hopefully he’s back on the court sooner rather than later.
The most baffling omission was New Orleans Pelicans center Anthony Davis. Already known as a premier defensive stopper, Davis was really coming around offensively as well, even placing fifth in the league in PER up to this point, taking high efficiency shots and protecting the ball.  That statistic does not even include how much Davis has improved without the ball. 
He has become a top pick-and-roll big over the course of the season. Despite an injury that stole some of Davis’s season, his offensive and defensive activity has been hugely positive for the Pelicans. This success is quite a task considering that the roster is built around three players with identical skill sets. There have not been any holes in Davis’s game this year, so the problem is figuring out whose spot he deserves.
It’s likely that Davis will get Bryant’s spot, considering that he both deserves it and that the game will be played in New Orleans. The fact that a deserving New Orleans representative was denied a chance to play in this game on his home floor is probably not something the NBA will let happen upon further review.
The fourth and final omission from this All-Star team in the West is Sacramento Kings forward DeMarcus Cousins. He has been an absolute beast offensively, regularly putting up 30 and 10 lines for the Kings. There are two reasons he ended up missing the cut. The first is that the frontcourt spots in the West are extremely difficult to get; there are far more deserving players than there are spots. The second is that Cousins often gets docked for perceived character issues stemming from spats with his coach and teammates as a rookie. 
The truth is that Cousins’s game has been elevated to another level. He’s getting better offensively without the ball and has become unstoppable when he has possession. His defense is still subpar, but it’s no longer the massive liability it was before this year. On a team with more assets than the Kings, he could be an MVP candidate, but his season to date has been excellent. The problem with saying he should be in the All-Star Game is figuring out whose spot he should take. The six big men on the current roster and, potentially, Davis, are all having stellar seasons. Clippers’ Blake Griffin, Houston Rockets’ Dwight Howard, and Trail Blazers’ LaMarcus Aldridge are in MVP talks, and Oklahoma City Thunder’s Kevin Durant is probably the MVP at this point in the season. Dallas Mavericks Dirk Nowitzki is having an excellent year and has been one of the most efficient players in the league to date, and Minnesota Timberwolves Kevin Love is probably the best all-around power forward in the game. Cousins should be in the All-Star Game — there just aren’t enough spots in the West.
The West does not have any true snubs because there are way too many deserving players to fit all of them on the roster. These four only scratched the surface, but players like San Antonio Spurs forward Tim Duncan and Thunder forward Serge Ibaka are also worthy of consideration. The pool of players to choose from made for a tough field more than it resulted in snubs.
The Eastern Conference, on the other hand, probably stretched a bit to find enough players to be in this game. However, there are two definite snubs of players who were more than deserving of an All-Star spot, while others were seemingly chosen for no reason. 
The truth is, of the 12 East All-Stars, only eight deserved their spots. The omissions of Indiana Pacers guard Lance Stephenson and Toronto Raptors guard Kyle Lowry show just how far the East had to reach to find big names to put in an All-Star Game.
The inclusion of Raptors guard DeMar DeRozan over fellow Raptor Lowry makes no sense. With the possible exception of Miami Heat guard Dwyane Wade, Lowry has been the best guard in the East. DeRozan was supposed to be a big piece of the Raptors before the season, but Lowry’s amazing year has put him at the center of the team’s astonishing turnaround, ascending from a cellar dweller last year to a division leader this year. Part of their record has to do with the Atlantic Division, but the Raptors are actually playing good basketball. DeRozan has been relatively inefficient this year, taking tons of bad shots, while Lowry has kept everyone in the offense humming. He has been generally excellent as a playmaker, in addition to being a good shooter. Lowry is having a better year than Cleveland Cavaliers guard Kyrie Irving by a long shot. Irving is having a subpar year by anyone’s standards — let alone the All-Star team’s — but he is still having a much better season than Brooklyn Nets forward Joe Johnson. Lowry probably deserved to be a starter.
Indiana Pacers guard Lance Stephenson was also snubbed. His improvement has catapulted the Pacers from being the third team in the East to comfortably leading the conference. Last year he was a complementary player, but this year he is the best backcourt player in one of the best backcourts in the league. His defense has been suffocating, and he completely eliminates whoever he is guarding. His offense has been okay — it’s been very efficient thus far, but not spectacular. However, Stephenson deserved a All-Star spot in the East, and should not have been denied it because Irving’s name is more recognized (despite his huge regression) or because Nets’ Joe Johnson hit two buzzer beaters despite having a generally bad season.
The Eastern Conference All-Star team, which should have 10 deserving players, only has eight while the Western Conference All-Stars spill over the roster limit. This game will probably not be a classic, but the difference in talent between the East and West might be on full display. The exhibition nature of the All-Star Game means it usually ends up as a highlight contest, so the honor of being named an All-Star matters more than the game. This year, being named an Eastern Conference All-Star might be even less important.

For the third time this season, Carnegie Mellon set out to face a non-Division III opponent, this time coming in the form of Duquesne University. The final count, 7–2, belied a series of close-fought matches, a few of which were decided with tiebreakers. The Carnegie Mellon team picked up its two wins in No. 1 singles and No. 3 doubles by sophomore Abhishek Alla and the team of sophomore Paul Okuda and first-year Kiril Kirkov, respectively. In the end, though, Carnegie Mellon could not pull out the victory over tough competition.
In one of the matches decided by a second set tiebreaker, No. 5 singles first-year Kenny Zheng put up a fight before losing a tough set. After the match, he showed resolve saying, “It’s disappointing to lose a close match. When a match is that close it comes down to mental toughness, and he was just mentally tougher than I was on the big points. That’s something I need to work on going forward.”  
Zheng’s loss was just one in a day full of close defeats, but the takeaway from a day like this is that Zheng, as well as the rest of the team, played hard, and that a few key bounces might have swung some of the matches.
Alla was impressive, winning his round in two matches and providing one of the few major bright spots on the day for Carnegie Mellon.  He picked up his second consecutive individual match, which adds to his recent wins in the USTA/ITA National Small College Championships in October and the USTA/ITA Southeast Regional Championships at the end of September. The regional tournament saw Carnegie Mellon produce three out of four semifinalists — first-year Kenny Zheng, junior Christian Heany-Secord, and the champion.
With only two games in the books in the spring portion of the season, Carnegie Mellon has beaten one Division I opponent and lost to another.  After much success in the fall portion of the season, Carnegie Mellon now stands at 5–2 on the season.  They have a long break to regroup before they play West Virginia Wesleyan College and can try to get back on track on Feb. 22.

On April 20, 2013, Manchester United had just won the English Premier League for the 20th time in their history, a whole four match days early. Striker Robin van Persie, their marquee purchase in the summer, was on his way to scoring 30 goals and carrying the team to the title. He and his partner, forward Wayne Rooney, worked together beautifully, and the emergence of several young players in the squad had fans brimming with optimism. 
All looked rosy until May 8, when Sir Alex Ferguson, the team’s manager for 26 years, decided to call time on his career. Most fans of the club today had never seen United without Sir Alex. There was an uncertainty never before experienced at the club, but in David Moyes, they thought they had appointed a manager in the same vein as Ferguson; someone who could provide stability to the club and continue their unparalleled success.
Fast forward to the present, and the worst fears of United fans have been realized — they are currently seventh in the league and have already lost an alarming four games at Old Trafford. Their playing style is more mid-table than one-of-Europe’s-best. Nothing seems to be working — not the defense, midfield, or attack. Where did it all go wrong?
It would be churlish to suggest that United’s record boils down to one single factor from among the midfield, Moyes’s tactical incompetence, the lack of Sir Alex’s winning mentality, or the absence of chief executive David Gill in the boardroom. The problem is a combination of these individual issues. It all began with the double retirement of Gill and Ferguson. They essentially ran the club together for more than a decade, and the loss of this pair in itself is hard to overcome, even with United’s vast resources.
On top of these problems, it is genuinely hard to imagine that United could have had it any worse in regard to the summer transfer window. United won the league title by 11 points, but that success was solely due to Ferguson, and shadowed the blatant incompetence of several areas of the squad. For starters, the midfield is as barren as it has ever been. Besides Michael Carrick, United does not have a single midfielder capable of slotting into any of the top seven sides in the country. Midfielders Tom Cleverley, Anderson Luís de Abreu Oliveira, and an aging Ryan Giggs were never viable options as Carrick’s partner. 
United needed reinforcements in this position. All they managed to get was Marouane Fellaini, who turned out to be a terrible fit beside Carrick. Midfielders Arturo Vidal, Ilkay Gundogan, Thiago Alcantara, Kevin Strootman, and even Ander Herrera would have been much better options.
There were zero other transfers. Zero! Why is there no new left back to replace Patrice Evra? Why are there no new wingers after the shockingly bad seasons Nani, Antonio Valencia, and Ashley Young have had? Why is there no central defensive cover considering Rio Ferdinand and Nemanja Vidić are aging? It speaks volumes about the miscommunication between the manager and the board when a club of United’s stature cannot lure world-class talent.
The lack of reinforcements meant Moyes had to promote youth, and to his credit, he has unearthed a potential superstar in forward Adnan Januzaj. But a club like Manchester United should not have to rely on an 18-year-old in his first full season to be their go-to man. Januzaj needs experience to have a greater impact, and overplaying him in his first season may cause burnout, just like in the case of Arsenal midfielder Jack Wilshere. 
Moyes has also been hopelessly inept when it comes to making his team play adventurously. He chooses to go wide and cross to his two forwards, rather than play through the middle, despite the quality of players available to him in the attacking midfield spot — Shinji Kagawa, Januzaj, Rooney and the recently acquired Juan Mata. In the post-match interview after their latest loss to Stoke City, Moyes claimed his side played well. “We got to the byline at least seven or eight times,” he said. It is absolutely unacceptable that a manager of a top club thinks that getting to byline is a measure of how well his team plays. Top teams play through the middle, with creative players who can instantly split defenses and make quick passes. There is absolutely no fluidity in play, not even the expected solidity at the back of Moyes’s Everton teams. To put it bluntly, United’s play has been uninspiring and they are one of the worst teams to watch this season.
The club is currently in seventh place and the acquisition of Mata in the January transfer window was supposed to boost confidence and gather momentum to make a push for the top four. There were always going to be questions about where to play Mata, but wide right seemed good enough. After all, Moyes worked well with Kevin Mirallas and Steven Pienaar as inverted wingers on Everton. 
Mata is not a traditional winger, however. Playing him there is a waste of his talent and severely stagnates the attack. He is not quick enough to run at defenders or get past them. Against Stoke City, he was asked to hug the touchline, something he is not meant for. This tactic meant he was largely invisible throughout the game, other than providing an assist for van Persie. Moyes must play to the strengths of his team, and change his approach toward matches. He isn’t at Everton anymore, where seventh place is a good finish.
Going forward, there are many things United needs to do to correct this ship. Seventh position may just be a possibility this season, and United will have to live with that. Aging players such as Evra, Vidić and Ferdinand must depart while serial under-performers Cleverley, Anderson, Young, and Nani must go too. At the very least two central midfielders are required for first team quality. FC Bayern Munic’s Toni Kroos, a mooted option, would be a good start, in addition to a couple of consistent wingers, one world class central midfielder, and a left back. Top youngsters, like United wingers Jesse Lingard and Wilfried Zaha, must be given a run in the team.
Spending on the squad is necessary, but none of it will matter if Moyes continues to make his team play like a mid-table team. A trio of van Persie, Rooney, and Mata should not be put through this mediocrity. If no signs of improvement are seen, Moyes’s job may be under immense pressure this summer, and his players’ futures may lie elsewhere. It’s obvious what’s wrong and it’s obvious what must be done. Over to you Moyes, to show that you truly are the “Chosen One.”

Every two years, the world convenes to celebrate the best every country has to offer at the Olympic games. The athletes spend their entire lives training for sports that go unseen except for two weeks every four years. The biggest, fastest, and strongest in each country train for the love of the game. Except for a lucky few people, these athletes won’t suddenly become household names and make a living off of endorsement deals. The athletes, the true competitors who play for pride and honor — not money and fame — are supposed to be what the games are about. 
The Olympics are intended to be the ultimate show of world unity, with countries setting aside conflict and ideological differences to compete as equals. Nowhere else would Israel and Iran walk side by side, but every year, the Olympics become a soapbox for political and economic commentary. Much like China six years ago during the Beijing 2008 Summer Olympics, Russia wanted to use these games to showcase their country to the rest of the world. Instead, the Sochi 2014 Winter Olympics has been ripe with controversy, further solidifying many of the stereotypes the rest of the world holds against Russia.
The most talked-about issue coming into Sochi was Russia’s homosexual propaganda ban. At a time when many countries are slowly moving toward the legalization of same-sex marriage, Russia signed a controversial law banning all forms of homosexual propaganda in an attempt to limit the exposure of the nation’s youth to this immoral lifestyle. 
Given the explicit non-discriminatory aspect of the Olympics, this legislation sent shockwaves through many of the major winter Olympic competitors, including the United States. This instance was not the first time the United States and Russia had played out political disagreements in an Olympic forum. 
The United States and 64 other countries boycotted the 1980 summer games, held in Moscow, in protest of the Soviet war in Afghanistan. In retribution, the Soviets led a boycott of the 1984 games, hosted by Los Angeles. 
What is lost in these instances of politics interceding sports are the opportunities of hundreds of athletes. Many of these athletes trained their entire lives for one moment, one chance to earn the pride and respect of their nation and the world, but had it all taken away because of political posturing. 
It’s fine to talk about Russia’s conservative social standards, or the plague of corruption that ran the budget of the Sochi Olympics to over four times its original $12 billion budget, or even the shoddy construction that forced one American bobsled team member to break down his bathroom door when the lock got stuck. 
But let’s not forget the true purpose of the Olympics. The Olympics are a celebration of the human race, a display of triumph over nature, pain, and even each other. 
Whatever political overtones the media may try to place on these games, the focus should ultimately be on the athletes. 
Just try and keep that in mind the next time President Barack Obama has a 30-minute interview during what is being advertised as Olympic Games coverage, or another reporter tweets a picture of a shoddy Sochi hotel room. 
These games are about the athletes — a celebration of their life’s work and their chance to earn the pride and respect of not only their nation, but humanity as a whole.

Over the past several years, popular interest in neuroscience has dramatically increased worldwide. This public interest has led to more funding, research, and programs that promote the field of neuroscience, such as the Brain Research through Advancing Innovative Neurotechnologies (BRAIN) Initiative — a research initiative to map every neuron in the human brain announced by President Barack Obama last April. Carnegie Mellon researchers are also taking part in this new research with innovative experimental techniques that could help explain how the brain functions the way it does. Marlene Behrmann, a professor of psychology at Carnegie Mellon, is examining brain plasticity in order to gain insight into its inner workings. 
Behrmann explained that an understanding of brain plasticity — the ability of the brain to change and adapt its structure and function — could have a substantial influence on the way the brain is viewed. “Contrary to received wisdom, the brain is really a pretty flexible machine,” Behrmann said. “There may be ways to optimize brain function, both in normal individuals and individuals with some kind of abnormality.” 
Behrmann’s research focuses on how functions of the brain, such as plasticity, occur. She explains that while scientists understand a lot about how the brain physically works, and understand what the final behavioral products of these actions are, they do not know much about how the final products are generated. “We know a lot about the brain, and we also know a lot about behavior,” Behrmann said. “We know both sides of the equation. We just don’t yet know what the transformation is.”
Behrmann has received funding from the National Institute of Health for a high-risk project that examines the brain organization of children who have had an entire hemisphere of their brain removed. Behrmann explains that these children have such a high number of seizures per day that it is optimal to remove the damaged tissue, which can entail removing an entire hemisphere of the brain. 
Plasticity becomes involved during these children’s recoveries. “Within a space of a couple of years these kids have regained most cognitive functions,” Behrmann said. “How does this plasticity occur? They have got everything that other people have got in two hemispheres in a single hemisphere.” Behrmann explained that the innovative nature of this research gives it the potential to help researchers understand the complex workings of the brain. “There has been very little work that has been done to date,” Behrmann said. “If we can understand this extreme form of plasticity, it may give us some insights into how the system works.”
Behrmann also explained the major impact that technology has had on the research. First, technology has allowed researchers to acquire large data sets. “In humans we don’t have direct access to the brain,” Behrmann said. “The best we can do is record signals on the surface of the scalp, termed electroencephalography, or use magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) technology. Through this technology we can acquire data reliably and precisely, with finely calibrated experiments.” 
Behrmann also noted the use of technology in data science. “The advances that are being made in statistics and machine learning can be used on these data sets,” Behrmann said. “The ability to handle and bring analytics to big data is pretty ubiquitous at Carnegie Mellon.” She explained that several students from Carnegie Mellon’s master’s of statistical practice program will be working with the data collected to bring advanced statistics to the research. “We now have the technology and we have the analytics to be able to begin to scratch the surface of this,” Behrmann said. 
Finally, Behrmann noted the ideal location of her research. “In order to do a project like this, you need the technology and you need the analytics, but you also need the patient population,” Behrmann said. “Because Pittsburgh has fantastic medical facilities and hospitals, it is a large catchment area.”

The human brain contains approximately 100 billion neurons. With this number in mind — pun intended — you can imagine how difficult it is to collect and understand datasets in the world of neuroscience. How, then, can neuroscientists analyze these huge datasets in an efficient yet biologically meaningful manner?
Last Thursday, Carnegie Mellon’s Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering hosted a seminar lecture in which this exact question was explored. Surya Ganguli, an assistant professor of applied physics and, by courtesy, of neurobiology and electrical engineering at Stanford University, spoke in the Scaife Hall Auditorium to discuss how neuroscientists can use high-dimensional statistics and computation to obtain accurate models of neural systems from large datasets.
The topic of Ganguli’s talk is a very unique niche field that straddles the interface between neuroscience and electrical and computer engineering. “I was told that there would be both neuroscientists and electrical engineers here. It’s always a bit tough to pitch a talk to an interdisciplinary crowd, so if anything doesn’t make sense, I’m sure I’ll please half of you, half the time … so I guess I’ll always piss off somebody all the time,” Ganguli joked as he began his talk. For those in the crowd who fell under neither of the two categories, the talk was an ironic struggle to use every relevant brain neuron to understand the vast amount of neurons in our brains. 
Most people — especially people at Carnegie Mellon — are familiar with Moore’s Law, the doubling of the number of transistors on integrated circuits every two years. Ganguli stated that neuroscience has been undergoing a revolution and has its own version of Moore’s Law. By now, approximately 100 to 1,000 neurons can be recorded. However, the circuits in the brain which control our behavior consist of a million to a billion neurons, so the sample that can currently be recorded is still only a small fraction of the total. Ganguli refers to this situation as an “anti-Goldilocks moment” because we cannot seem to obtain a neural sampling that is “just right.”
“On the one hand, we do have a lot of neurons, so the data analysis is not easy,” Ganguli said. “On the other hand, we may not have enough neurons to really understand circuit computation in any meaningful sense.”
He presented the audience with a graph which plotted the firing rates of individual neurons against time of a monkey reaching for an object. The graph appeared very heterogeneous, and no qualitative information could be immediately gathered from it. However, through a method known as dimensionality reduction, the dataset could be more easily interpreted. 
“A widespread practice is to take a pattern of activity across neurons at any instance in time and express them as time-dependent linear combinations of a fixed set of basis patterns of activity,” Ganguli explained. In other words, by decomposing high-dimensional firing space into a smaller number of dimensions of firing rate space and projecting neural activity onto these dimensions, neural datasets can be more readily analyzed. 
These simplified representations are known as dynamical portraits. “What’s interesting about these dynamical portraits is that they reveal a lot about the way that circuit computation works,” Ganguli said. He then went on to show the audience the dynamical portraits obtained by observing a monkey’s prefrontal cortex while it was doing a tactile discrimination task, as well as the dynamical portrait of the entire brain of a zebrafish. He explained the qualitative information that could be obtained by looking at each one. 
While the fact that dimensionality reduction and dynamical portraits can simplify neuronal datasets is a beautiful thing, it leads to many questions. In the abstract for Ganguli’s talk, he posits several key questions: “What is the origin of this simplicity and its implications for the complexity of brain dynamics? Would neuronal datasets become more complex if we recorded more neurons? How and when can we trust dynamical portraits obtained from only hundreds of neurons in circuits containing millions of neurons?”   
The task from which data for Ganguli’s studies was recorded was the monkey-reaching task. A target was shown to a monkey and then taken away, and the monkey had to reach for it. The neurons in the monkey’s dorsal premotor cortex were recorded as the monkey reached in eight different directions. In fact, some of this data was taken by Byron Yu, an assistant professor in electrical and computer engineering and biomedical engineering at Carnegie Mellon. “He’s a man of many talents,” Ganguli said about Yu. “He even knows how to deal with monkeys!” 
The key piece in solving the puzzle of how well we can trust dynamical portraits is by determining why dimensionality in neural recordings can be so low. “In order to do that, we’d like to derive upper bounds on how high a dimensionality could possibly be in any dataset,” Ganguli said. An idea that is currently out there is that dimensionality might be low because of the simplicity of the task. “But nobody has really quantitatively proved it and come up with a definition of, say, task complexity that is somehow related to the dimensionality of neural dynamics,” Ganguli said. This final upper bound, which is a quantitative measure of task complexity, is what Ganguli and his colleagues have derived. 
According to the abstract for the paper in which Ganguli and his colleagues discuss their theory of neural dimensionality, “the dimensionality of motor cortical data is close to [the theoretical upper bound], indicating neural activity is as complex as possible, given task constraints.” 
The underlying consequence of their theory is that it provides a framework for whether neural dimensionality is limited by task complexity or by intrinsic brain dynamics. As the Moore’s Law of neuroscience continues to increase the amount of neurons that can be recorded, this breakthrough will help neuroscientists better design experiments and interpret large datasets in the future.

Ever since we were in kindergarten, we were told to drink milk to soak up calcium and keep our bones strong. However, a significant portion of the population can’t digest lactose. We all know where regular milk comes from (hopefully), but what about the milk substitutes made for our lactose-sensitive or vegan brethren? The processes behind soy, almond, and rice milk are intriguing, so let’s get to it.
As its name implies, rice milk is made by processing rice, usually brown rice. There are multiple methods that can even be done at home to process the rice. First, the rice is cooked normally on a stove top or rice cooker. Then, it is blended with water until it becomes liquefied. During the cooking process, the rice undergoes a natural enzymatic process. The carbohydrates in the rice are cleaved and become sugars, giving the rice milk a natural sweetness. After resting, one can pour the mixture over cheesecloth, a gauze-like cloth used for cheese-making and cooking. Rice milk has less fat than regular milk, but more carbohydrates. Furthermore, there are few natural nutrients in the milk, although most commercially-made rice milk is fortified with added calcium and vitamins.
Almond milk is made through a similar process. At-home methods include soaking the almonds for an extended period of time, blending with water, and then straining through a cheesecloth. Almond milk doesn’t have any cholesterol or lactose and has a lower fat content than cow’s milk. It provides much less protein than milk as well, although it still provides nutrients including calcium.
Soy milk is perhaps the most common milk substitute. Made from soybeans, soy milk has a long history with roots in Asia. Soybeans are soaked overnight and then go through a process called wet grinding to make a wet, pasty substance with the rehydrated beans. Boiling the purée enhances its flavor and sterilizes, while also improving the nutritional value. The liquid milk is then separated from the solids by filtering it through a cheesecloth. Finally, the collected soy milk must be boiled again.
So why are people lactose intolerant in the first place? It usually comes down to genetics and your ancestors’ evolutionary past. 
Lactose is a disaccharide sugar made of galactose and glucose, and is found in milk. Lactose is digested by an enzyme known as lactase, which is encoded by the gene LCT in humans. Mutations in LCT itself are very rare and cause lactose intolerance beginning in infancy. Much more common adult-onset lactose intolerance is instead caused by a lack of expression of LCT post-infancy, which is dependent on other regions of DNA called regulatory elements. Scientists have found a nearby gene called MCM6 that controls the expression of LCT and, therefore, controls the production of lactase.
Some individuals have a variation of MCM6 that allows them to produce lactase all their lives, while others have variations that will stop working in childhood. Ancestry plays a great role in determining whether someone will be lactose-intolerant or not. Populations that historically raised cows and lived off milk for nutrition, such as northern Europeans, have about 95 percent lactose tolerance, according to the National Institutes of Health. Many East Asian populations, on the other hand, have 90 percent or greater lactose intolerance because there was no need for an active MCM6. In fact, around 65 percent of the population loses the ability to digest lactose post-infancy.
When we are unable to digest lactose, it builds up in the digestive system and acts as a food source for bacteria in the gut. The growth of bacteria is what causes the various gastrointestinal maladies lactose-intolerant individuals experience after consuming dairy products.
Whether your milk aversion is due to a non-functioning MCM6, a vegan lifestyle, or taste preferences, milk substitutes can be found in most grocery stores or made at home.

On Feb. 4, Facebook celebrated its 10th birthday. The beloved social networking site has allowed over one billion people to be a part of a giant web of communication. In a recent interview with Bloomberg Businessweek, Mark Zuckerberg suggested allowing users to log in anonymously. “It is somewhat of a burden if you are always under pressure of a real identity,” Zuckerberg said during the interview. 
Anonymity can release the burden of identity by not tying people to the things they do or say online. In one sense, not revealing one’s identity allows more freedom of speech. Anonymity is helpful in avoiding consequences that may come along with an individual’s actions, such as stalking or bullying. 
Yelp, the popular business review site, is a good example of an online space where anonymity allows for more honesty when critiquing businesses. Most people will not go up to their local barber and tell him that the haircuts he gives are terrible, but they might say something to the same effect if they are able to post their thoughts online under a pseudonym. Anonymity can also remove unwanted connotations that come along with identity. For example, female authors, such as the Brontë sisters of the 19th century, wrote under aliases so that people would take them more seriously. Anonymity is powerful in the sense that it decreases the consequences associated with speaking out and allows people more freedom to say what is on their minds.
However, detaching one’s actions from identity can be dangerous. Anonymous communication changes normal social interaction. Because restraints on speech are loosened, people are more willing to speak out. They do not have to think about how they will present themselves because their actions are not associated with their identity. Usually, when we communicate, we subconsciously monitor and adapt to behaviors of others around us. Anonymity in online interactions eliminates this tendency, making bad behavior more likely.
Anonymous is an international activist group in which unnamed members unite under a common cause, usually against the government, religious groups, and corporations. Under the veil of anonymity they can plot international protests and movements without consequence. Anonymity is a key characteristic for the group. The actions of the group cannot be tied to any individual. There is no way to persecute everyone, and there is no way to find an origin to the group’s actions. Also, because there is no individuality, the group can be omnipresent by not needing to rally around a leader. Although Anonymous believes their causes are morally justified, their actions are often illegal. For example, in protest of PlayStation 3 hackers being sued, Anonymous hacked Sony’s servers in 2011. Anonymity has given this activist group a lot of power; however, it is not clear whether they are using it for good.
What will happen if users can create anonymous Facebook accounts? These accounts could create an environment where people are free to share even the most extreme ideas. Or the environment could be conducive to the negative and rash behavior that can occur when people detach their actions from their identity.
Student Pugwash is a non-advocacy, educational organization that meets on a weekly basis to discuss the implications of science, technology, and medicine in society. This is a summary of last week’s discussion on anonymity online.

Scientists find early European footprints on Norfolk coast
A team of scientists led by Queen Mary University of London, the British Museum, and the Natural History Museum have recently discovered footprints on the coast of England in northeast Norfolk that are over 800,000 years old. These ancient footprint findings are extremely rare; the only two footprints that have ever been found earlier are both in Africa and are 1.5 million and 3.5 million years old. If geologists had arrived at the scene of the footprints just two weeks later, the footprints would have already been eroded away by the tide. This fact illustrates the extremely unlikely chance of the discovery and the difficulty with which footprints are found. These footprints provide interesting insight into the movement patterns of ancient humans and provides evidence that they may have been migrating toward Great Britain when it was still connected to the main continent. The researchers used photogrammetry, a technique which pieces together photographs to create a 3-D image, to study the footprints.

Sector of human brain contributes to advanced thought
Researchers at the University of Oxford have determined that the ventrolateral frontal cortex of human brains contains a region that gives humans the unique ability to process loads of information, make informed decisions, and create speech. During an experiment, researchers used MRI imaging and compared the brain activity of 25 adults to the brain activity of 25 macaque monkeys. The monkeys and humans had 11 regions that acted similarly out of 12 tested regions in the ventrolateral frontal cortex. However, the humans used a portion of their brain in the frontal cortex that the monkeys didn’t have. Scientists are hypothesizing that this portion of the brain is correlated with advanced thinking like multi-tasking and speech. This region of the frontal cortex could be what gives humans unique intelligence, given that a close relative of humans does not have this same region in their ventrolateral frontal cortex. The scientists have published their findings in the science journal Neuron.

Gene identified in women that causes their slower growth
Research conducted on the X chromosome is instrumental to determining the factors that cause men and women to be different. The only genetic difference between a man and a woman is that the woman has two X chromosomes, while the man has one X chromosome and one Y chromosome. To this end, researchers from the University of Helsinki, Finland, have found a gene that can help to explain the difference in height associated with men and women. The gene, ITM2A, causes the body to grow at a slower rate. The gene is found on the X chromosome and is active on both the X chromosomes in women. However, they are only found active once in men because they only have one X chromosome. Thus, with more ITM2A, women grow at a slower rate. While this gene has only been shown to contribute to about 1 to 2 percent change, it still could provide further insight and reasoning.

Jakeisrain and C Street Brass released their first collaborative EP, Wop de Wop, this Saturday. Jake Berntsen, a sophomore music technology and philosophy double major, is the man behind Jakeisrain, while C Street Brass is a brass quintet ensemble in residence here at Carnegie Mellon. Originally the brainchild of trumpet player and second-year master’s student Scott Nadelson, the quintet includes Nadelson, second-year trumpet performance graduate student Kyle Anderson, second-year trombone performance graduate student Gabriel Colby, second-year French horn performance graduate student Eric Damashek, and second-year bass trombone performance graduate student Hakeen Bilal on the bass trombone. 
They held a launch party at the South Side Chamber of Commerce on East Carson Street on Saturday night. The venue was a small and warm space with huge, colorful photographs spanning three of the walls and bright chalk drawings on the fourth wall behind the band. The air of intimacy was heightened by the assorted members of C Street Brass and Berntsen moving through the room before the show started, grinning and chatting with members of the crowd. The C Street Brass musicians radiated good humor and buoyancy as they wandered about. “We’re really excited to bring what we do to a wider audience,” Anderson said at the launch party. Bilal added “We’re really excited to be getting a bunch of friends out of their environment, out of the box, doing something different.” 
“Different” exactly describes the collaboration between C Street Brass and Jakeisrain. All of C Street’s musicians are trained in a conservatory, while Berntsen is primarily an electronic musician, with some background in classical piano. Together, they make brass electronic music, which is a relatively new genre. In an interview before the release, Berntsen explained that because electronic brass is so unique, even covers of other songs require arranging by the group, and the band has to write most of its own music. 
The music at the launch party started off with only Bernsten as disc jockey. The crowd clustered close to the stage, some dancing, but mostly milling around. At around 9:30 p.m., Bilal got on a megaphone and announced the official arrival of C Street Brass. 
From the minute the whole group was on stage together, the energy in the room came to a head. The mild feeling of restlessness vanished as Sky High by Big Gigantic, washed over the crowd. 
Before the concert, Colby said via phone, “We were talking about doing something that had never really been done before. No one’s doing it with as tight a setup as we would be. I’m not saying we’re the best, but when you got five people who have classically trained together for a long time, certain things become possible.”
In this case, one of those certain things was the absolutely mind-blowing set that C Street Brass and Jakeisrain played. The quintet members seamlessly complemented each other, interweaving their own unique sound with the heavier electronic music to create a perfect blend of styles. The crowd’s dancing picked up almost immediately as the band played; the set combined high-energy, gorgeous brass sounds over a framework of low, rhythmic bass, which made for perfect dancing music. During the early songs, Nadelson took off with a phenomenal trumpet solo, his hands blurring over the valves of his instrument. Colby’s trombone and Bilal’s bass trombone played off each other beautifully. 
All the musicians were true performers, flashing wide smiles into the crowd and dancing along with the music as they played. From the back of the stage, Berntsen threw himself wholeheartedly into dancing along, while 
the C Street Brass musicians actually danced with some of the audience members, as they were less than two feet  apart. About halfway through the set, Bilal handed his bass trombone off to a girl in the crowd, saying “I don’t want to hold it anymore,” swigged at someone else’s beer, then grabbed his instrument back in time to hit his note. 
The EP itself is a unique spread of music. According to Colby, the tracks “all really represent different parts of electronic music right now.”
“‘Wop de Wop’ is really fun to play,” he said. “‘Move More’ is my personal favorite.” All four tracks on the EP present a unique blend of brass and electronic. “Move More” falls more on the brassy side of that scale, with an anthem-like quality to it, and triphop kind of beat. “Not a Normal Trombone” is the heaviest-sounding track, with a dubstep feel. The notes fall heavily, with a trappy sort of sound. “Cookies N Cream” sounds more electronic, with a faster pace and higher energy. The faster electronic bits mix well with the brass, which slow the piece down a little. “Wop de Wop” blends brass and electronic the most effectively on this EP, as it plays a Big Sean sample over a deep bass drop. 
After they cycled through the four songs on the EP, the band switched to other original work, and some electronic-brass covers. One of the most notable covers was of the Beatles’ “Because,” which sounded simultaneously familiar and strange, as the brass played with the classic sound. During one of their four encore calls, they played an arrangement with elements of Muse’s “Time is Running Out.”
The EP was available for free in hard copy at the launch party, and is also available for free download on the Internet. “I really like the idea of doing things for free. It’s really important to me that people hear the music,” Berntsen said.  “Right now, there’s no way you can actually sell music and expect to get a profit. There are so many platforms, it’s impossible to govern. So it’s more important, I think, to get it in as many people’s ears as possible, so then they pay for your live show. So that’s kind of our philosophy for right now. It’s gonna be a free show, we’re giving out free beer — we just want people to be there. I’m really excited to get things going.” Berntsen was not alone in his enthusiasm to “get things going” — all the band members expressed how happy they were to reveal their work. “We’re just pumped to show people what we’re doing,” Colby said. 
The genuine enthusiasm that radiated off of all the band members during the show is one quality that makes this collaboration effort so unique. These musicians are all deeply talented, and are putting their varied skills together to create something unique, new, and incredible. And this EP is only the pairing’s first release.

The Pittsburgh Symphony Orchestra (PSO)performed The Planets – An HD Odyssey last weekend, which combined the wonders of the galaxy with high-resolution photos from space and the vivacity of a live orchestra into a prime example of the combination of science and arts that Carnegie Mellon prizes.
The Planets – An HD Odyssey consists of seven movements — one movement for each of the planets, excluding Earth. The title associated with each planet described the tone of the piece. For example, the first movement, “Mars, the Bringer of War,” had a militaristic feel with war-like drum rolls and loud, thunderous swells. The music made NASA’s high-definition photographs, which were projected over the stage, especially impressive and breathtaking. Conversely, “Venus, the Bringer of Peace” presented the audience with a more soothing, mellifluous melody to accompany the crystal-clear photographs of the mostly white, gaseous planet.
“Mercury, the Winged Messenger” had a more flighty melody to accompany the science-fiction-like, vibrant photographs of the planet. “Jupiter, the Bringer of Jollity” impressive with its powerful and boisterous medly that accompanied images portraying the sheer enormity of the planet, especially in comparison to the moons that orbit it, as well as the powerful and boisterous melody that accompanied the images. “Saturn, the Bringer of Old Age” aroused chuckles from the audience for the name and had darker, foreboding tones.
Though it came at the tail end of the performance, “Uranus, the Magician” was bottom-to-none one of the most entertaining pieces. A true asset to the compilation of music and photographs, the melody was whimsical and entertaining. The magnificent photos of the massive blue planet, both from the perspective of the sun and from the rear, were fundamentally awesome.
“Neptune, the Mystic,” the final piece, was also the only piece accompanied by the women of the Mendelssohn Choir of Pittsburgh. The soft sound of the women’s voices in conjunction with the tender vibrations of the violins, added to the mystical feeling already inspired by the photos of the planet.
The Planets, composed by Gustav Holst, originally premiered in London in 1918. As his ideas for the piece formulated, Holst said to a friend, “As a rule, I only study things that suggest music to me…. Then recently the character of each planet suggested lots to me, and I have been studying astrology fairly closely.” 
Holst discouraged the connection between his pieces and their mythological namesakes. “If any guide to the music is required, the subtitle to each piece will be found sufficient, especially if it is used in a broad sense,” Holst wrote for the 1918 performance.
Before the performance of The Planets – An HD Odyssey, conductor Manfred Honeck led the orchestra in a five-part piece entitled The Elements. According to the PSO’s website, each movement was “inspired by the city’s environmental history and the natural elements of fire, earth, water, air, and metal.” 
Elements was prefaced by a video of the composers explaining their pieces, which not only contextualized the feelings conveyed by the music and brought specific images of Pittsburgh to mind, but also gave a face to the often-mysterious minds behind the compositions.
Duquesne professor  Patrick Burke, who composed the first piece, “Flourish,” described his piece as “blending the classical tradition, the visceral immediacy of rock, the social awareness of folk, and the meditative quality of gamelan music to form a cohesive, organic whole.” The piece focused on the elements of water and earth and was named “with confidence that my home city will continue to thrive, adapting itself to changing economic, social, and cultural climate,” Burke said. 
Burke and his wife were expecting their first child during the premiere. This piece “is my prayer for the baby’s safe arrival and a healthy, fulfilling childhood in Pittsburgh.” 
The pieces, “Awake,” by Bomi Jang; “Eliza Furnace,” by Mathew Rosenblum; and “Flood Lines,” by Amy Williams, were meditations on the decline of Pittsburgh’s urban forests, the Eliza Furnace Historic Site in Vintondale, Pa., and Pittsburgh’s Great St. Patrick’s Day Flood in 1936, respectively. Each piece was moving on its own and full of zealous, loud melodies. “As the music progresses, it focuses on building up an intense energy and gradually moves to the finale with various timbres of the instruments and lively rhythmic patterns in the chaotic texture,” Jang said of “Awake.”
Reza Vali, who has been a composition professor at the School of Music at Carnegie Mellon since 1988, composed the last of the five pieces, entitled “Ravân,” which is Persian for “flowing.” According to Vali, “‘Ravân’ is designed as a scherzo with a fast first section alluding to the turbulent white waters of the Youghiogheny River, a calmer middle section, like a trio, and a recapitulation of the fast section.”

Have you ever seen artsy dorm room decorations on Pinterest or Tumblr but been discouraged by their long and complicated instructions? Do-it-yourself (DIY) décor can definitely make a room look unique and personalized, but it can seem like a hassle as well. There are, nonetheless, some crafts that do not require much effort or time. Now you can make your dorm room or apartment look like lifestyle store Anthropologie!
The mason jar is currently at the center of most DIY crafts and embraced by hipsters, for good reason. Like most jars, it is versatile and can be used for storage. However, mason jars can also be decorated and used to personalize a room. To spice up a room with a mason jar, use it as a candle holder by placing a candle inside, and then filling the jar with sand to hold the candle in place. 
An alternative is to make the candle itself inside of the jar. This project requires more time, but simply involves placing a wick inside the jar, making the wax, pouring the wax into the jar, and letting it stand. To add a personal touch, place glitter on the outside. 
Another glitter design is what deal-finding website sweetnsourdeals.com calls the “Fireflies in a Jar” night lantern. To create this design, cut open a glow stick, empty it into a jar, add glitter, and seal the top of the jar before shaking it for a glittery glow-in-the-dark lantern. 
Mugs are another small item that you can personalize to make your living area feel more like home. While you could buy a collection of fancy mugs, they are expensive. For a cheaper solution, buy a white-colored mug and use a Sharpie to draw or write whatever you want on it. While black Sharpies can make the mug look serious and artsy, using colorful Sharpies can make your mug look more playful. Some stores sell silk screens with girly floral or butterfly designs that function as a stencil for things that aren’t flat, like mugs. Use these to add fancy designs or letters to your mug.
Lights are another cool option that you can make or decorate on your own to add a unique touch to your living space. The easiest option is to buy a string of lights and put them around your bed or living room (or both, if you’re obsessed). You could also string the lights around a hula hoop spray painted black and duct tape the lights to the hula hoop for a decorative piece that’ll look like it required more time and effort than it actually necessitated. 
Another alternative to stringing lights around your room is to twist the lights into a shape, like a heart, or to spell out a word when putting them up on your wall. 
Another crafty idea, which may not be suited to everyone’s taste, involves wrapping ribbons of different colors and patterns around an empty lampshade. Not only will this touch make a personalized lamp that no one else will have, but the light coming through the ribbon will also make a cool pattern on your walls. You could copy the wire light fixtures sold at Anthropologie by cutting the handles off a wire basket and then cutting open a section for the outlet cover. 
Wall decorations are a major part of making your living space more homey. Decorations can range from posters and bookshelves to something fancy like a tapestry. To create a bookshelf that appears to be floating, attach bookends to your wall and stack your books on top of them. Alternatively, recreate the uneven bookshelf sold at Anthropologie. You could spend the $1,400 for the store-bought version, or glue together small planks of wood in differing sizes and spray paint them so they look classy. 
To add even more flare to a room, spell out your name or a certain word or phrase using large letters. Generic letters can be found at stores like Michael’s Arts and Crafts or Hobby Lobby, but you can personalize them with your own design. Paint them, add glitter, or even cover them with scrapbook paper or fabric for something more individualized. 
Photos are something you can’t really personalize, but you certainly can be creative with the way that you put them up. Looking at photos of your favorite memories may also cheer you up when you’re unhappy. Collages are the most commonly used photo arrangement. Simply arrange the photos in a pleasing pattern in a certain area of the room. 
You can also string photos across a wall. Using string that is somewhat transparent, randomly place regular clothespins on the string. Use the clothespins to hold the photos in place. This arrangement will bring more of a vintage vibe to your living space. 
Jewelry holders are a final way to personalize your room. These are great because they also showcase your pieces of jewelry, allowing them to add to the décor. You can screw tiny hooks into a wooden hanger, and then hang your long necklaces on the hooks. You could also place fancy nails into a plank of wood — possibly spray painted a cool color — and then hang rings, bracelets, and necklaces on the nails. 
There really are countless crafty opportunities for you to personalize your living space, regardless of cost or expertise. Some of them might be time consuming, but making these crafts can be fun or relaxing as well. Make them in your free time or when taking a break from homework. You could even use one of these ideas as a bonding activity for your club or organization.

Are you displeased with the state of modern pop music? Can’t stand autotune, singers who can barely sing, and blasts of distorted electronica and synth? Then Scott Bradlee, a New York-based professional pianist, has a solution for you: Postmodern Jukebox. Under the YouTube channel name ScottBradleeLovesYa, Bradlee and a group of other musicians cover favorite 
(or not-so-favorite) pop hits with a vintage twist.
When Postmodern Jukebox reimagines songs, they become something very different. Justin Bieber’s “Beauty and a Beat” becomes a 1940s Sinatra-esque swing jam and Miley Cyrus’s “We Can’t Stop” a sultry 50s doo-wop. 
Robin Thicke’s “Blurred Lines” is turned into a bluegrass barn dance, and Psy’s “Gentleman” a 1920s jazz song, complete with dancing flappers. 
The lead singer, Robyn Adele Anderson, has a unique voice that radiates suave vintage class while Bradlee and the rest of the band fill the songs with great instrumentation.
But the crowning pinnacle of their work is an album in which they reinvented seven Nickelback songs as if they were produced by the legendary Motown records. Nickelback is a band so infamous for their horrendous music that, in 2011, over 50,000 people signed a petition at www.change.org to prevent them playing as the halftime show for the Detroit Lions on Thanksgiving Day. And yet, Postmodern Jukebox manages to make these songs not only listenable, but insanely enjoyable. 
The album, which is available for free streaming on scottbradlee.bandcamp.com, contains the smooth vocals of Drue Davis and imbues each of the songs with a sense of energy, emotion, and individuality; it’s now actually possible to differentiate between two Nickelback songs! The light, jaunty chords and rhythmic clapping in “Photograph” gives the song more of a carefree and happily nostalgic tone. “Rockstar” is cleaned up with a cool piano riff reminiscent of the blues. “How You Remind Me” is redone with a quicker pace and a toe-tapping beat that plucks the song out of the dreariness of its subject matter.
Other Motown-styled tributes featuring the soulful voice of Postmodern Jukebox friend Annie Goodchild are similarly enjoyable, such as Avril Lavigne’s “Sk8er Boi,” which is remixed with a funky beat and a brassy sound. 
Notable mention goes to songs that include “tambourine guy” Tim Kubart, whose spirited tambourining injects a shot of pure happiness in every video he appears in, such as the vibrant cover of Katy Perry’s "Roar.”
On their webpage www.postmodernjukebox.com, Bradlee describes his project: “My goal with Postmodern Jukebox is to get my audience to think of songs not as rigid, ephemeral objects, but like malleable globs of silly putty. Songs can be twisted, shaped, and altered without losing their identities – just as we grow, age, and expire without losing ours – and it is through this exploration that the gap between ‘high’ and ‘low’ art can be bridged most readily.”
Some songs completely overshadow their modern counterparts. The production on each song is beautiful, and the musical arrangements incorporate a variety of instruments and styles. The channel also contains mashups by Bradlee, including one that mixes Queen’s “Bohemian Rhapsody” with George Gershwin’s “Rhapsody in Blue,” and other piano song covers that Bradlee has worked on. Postmodern Jukebox also features a variety of unique talented artists, including various singers, a Mariachi band, tap dancers, and even a beatboxing flutist. 
The best part of the channel is the tangible passion behind the music; when you hear a song by Postmodern Jukebox, you know they are people that put love into their work. It is a great channel for anyone who has even the slightest interest in music, and will provide you with hours’ worth of entertainment.

Visitors flocked to the Pittsburgh Glass Center (PGC) last Friday night for the opening of the Halfway to Somewhere exhibit by resident artists Granite Calimpong of Seattle and Brent Rogers of Chicago. 
The exhibit is a result of the six-week residency at the PGC between Calimpong and Rogers, who first met in 2013. Halfway to Somewhere is marked most notably by the striking contrast between the styles of the two artists. 
Calimpong, according to his website, originally from Northern California and more recently from Seattle, grew up as the son of a potter and was introduced to glass as an artistic medium in college at the University of California, San Diego. Rogers, born and raised in Seattle but currently living in Chicago, educated himself in glass and illustration at the Pratt Fine Art Center and Pilchuck Glass School. He was also an intern at Benjamin Moore, Inc., according to the PGC website. 
Calimpong’s glasswork is both blown and cold worked — glass that, as the name implies, is shaped with tools like sanders and tile saws rather than the high heat of glassblowing. Calimpong’s work looked more like the traditional vases and jugs that one might expect to see at a glass exhibition, while Rogers’s work was much more abstract.
Many of Calimpong’s pieces were more traditional forms with some distinguishing, more modern characteristics. Calimpong created, for example, vases that looked like ordinary round-bottomed vases, but with the middle third cut out. According to the statement on his website, Calimpong “strives to exhibit work that exhibits balance and clarity of form. Whether the work is tight and symmetrical or loose in its manifestations, I am dedicated to creating glass that is carefully considered, cleanly executed, and exhibits the attention to detail that I employ during every step of the process.”
Calimpong’s pieces were, as the artist said, clean and symmetrical, while Rogers’s work was clean but usually anything but symmetrical. Rogers’ pieces don’t fall into any kind of category of vase that most viewers would recognize. Instead, Rogers makes use of different techniques like painting, lamination, and flocked glass to convey his ideas about “rejection, acceptance, and failure,” according to the PGC website. 
Rogers’ pieces were often difficult to interpret, such as a white, wall-mounted rectangle with a diamond-shaped cutout and blue, angled glass pipes running through it. Some, however, clearly embodied the cyclical human process of creation, such as three rectangular pillars, each containing a pit of smooth glass — one white, one gray, and one so black that at first it is difficult to tell that it is an indentation, rather than a black mark, on the surface of the pillar. 
The strongest pieces of the exhibition came from collaboration between Rogers and Calimpong, such as a sleek red, bullet-shaped piece of glass with a black hole on its flat front, and a series of what looked like crushed, bent glass cylinders with patterns on either end.  
Often, the hard-line contrast between Calimpong’s and Rogers’ works gave the exhibit a lack of coherency; it was hard to glean a theme or message from work that hailed from two completely different planes of the aesthetic spectrum.
While the individual pieces clearly showed the skill and glass-working master of Calimpong and Rogers, too often, looking at two subsequent pieces of the exhibition was more likely to leave viewers disoriented rather than enlightened, between the abstract bright and solid colors of Rogers’ work and Calimpong’s semi-opaque, smooth vases.
Halfway to Somewhere will be on view at the PGC through Apr. 20, 2014.

Last Thursday, Shrek: The Musical premiered at Pittsburgh’s Byham Theater. While it’s not Broadway’s next big hit, the musical is a solid two hours of laughs for the whole family. Long story short, Shrek is about an ogre who must rescue Princess Fiona for Lord Farquaad in return for some peace and quiet. While the original movie thrived on action and comedy, the musical dives into character development. 
Shrek the ogre (Billy Mason) is still crude and sarcastic, but the rest of the cast have subtleties that prevent the musical from being a carbon copy of the movie. Shrek’s sidekick, Donkey (David Toole), is even more hyper than the donkey voiced by Eddie Murphy, Princess Fiona (Emily Lynne Miller) is somewhat bipolar and more ridiculous than her movie counterpart, and Lord Farquaad (Tim Hartman) has been transformed into a fierce diva. However, side characters, such as Pinocchio, are essentially identical to their movie counterparts, and the musical could have benefited from spicing up those characters. 
The musical follows the same tactics as the movie — there are fart jokes for the kids with sprinklings of dark humor to keep older audience members engaged. Some lines were taken straight out of the movie, but the musical has plenty of fresh scenes up its sleeve. Fine moments include Donkey’s rap solo, Fiona’s violent tussle with wildlife, and Farquaad’s perplexing interactions with his lackeys. All scenes are backed up by strong vocals and general talent.
That being said, some scenes don’t translate well from the movie to the musical. Shrek’s battle with the dragon, now reduced to an odd, shaking  head on wheels, has been turned into a hypnotic spectacle involving Shrek flailing his body, lights flashing, and Fiona singing in the foreground. Strobe lights are often used during critical moments, turning serious scenes unintentionally funny. However, these odd scenes add a certain charm to the musical.
Lackluster sets and average costumes really hold the musical back. Many sets are merely painted backgrounds, sometimes with a prop or two to switch things up. Costumes are decent, but a few are mildly terrifying. While playing Shrek, Mason wears an ogre suit that made me uncomfortable whenever I looked into his eyes. 
Hartman’s Farquaad outfit definitely stands out among the rest. The painfully short character is played by a tall actor on his knees. Fake skinny legs are strapped onto the actor’s thighs, while the rest of the real legs are hidden by black fabric and a cape. Farquaad’s outfit is generally impressive, though also fuel for nightmares.
Despite these drawbacks, Shrek: The Musical is worth seeing. The musical has so-bad-it’s-good scenes, along with genuinely clever moments. For Shrek diehards, the musical is a must see. For everyone else, the humor and story is strong enough to make the two hours fly by. 
Shrek: The Musical will be showing in Byham Theater until Feb. 16.

[ITAL]The Notebook[ITAL]
Friday, Feb. 14
7, 9:30, and 12
“If you’re a bird, I’m a bird.” Who can forget the dreamy Ryan Gosling proclaiming his love for Rachel McAdams in this classic Nicholas Sparks tearjerker? This quintessential Valentine’s Day classic revolves around an older man named Duke as he visits an older woman in a nursing home and reads from a notebook the tale of country boy Noah Calhoun (Gosling), who falls in love with the beautiful heiress Allie Hamilton (McAdams). In the midst of World War II, their relationship falters, but, through a miraculous twist of fate, they get a chance to rekindle their love. Full of loveable quotes and some swoon-worthy scenes of Gosling being the ultimate dream boyfriend, The Notebook is the perfect movie to watch either with a loved one or with an equally loved box of chocolates. 
[ITAL]Don Jon[ITAL]
Saturday, Feb. 15
8, 10, and 12
Jon Martello (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) is the stereotypical Italian-American man. He seems to be plucked from Jersey Shore and would be a GTL (gym, tan, laundry) kind of guy. He acquires the moniker “Don Jon” for his womanizing ways, but even his lothario persona doesn’t match the intensity of his pornography addiction. When he meets old-fashioned gal Barbara Sugarman (Scarlett Johansson), he struggles to establish an intimate relationship that doesn’t interfere with his Internet-addicted ways. In Joseph Gordon-Levitt’s directorial debut, there is a genuine sense of lovable-ness about a seemingly provocative topic. With fantastically funny performances, Don Jon is full of laughs and insight into the relationship between media, fantasy, and reality.
[ITAL]Amour[ITAL]
Sunday, Feb. 16
8
For those who would rather avoid the sappy Valentine’s Day couples who quote The Notebook in their Facebook statuses, Amour is a bleak, yet deeply profound story about an elderly couple and the power of their love as it is tested through the hardest of times. Georges (Jean-Louis Trintignant) and Anne (Emmanuelle Riva) are retired music teachers in their eighties living a quiet and peaceful life together. One day, Anne suddenly suffers a silent stroke and her health gradually declines. Georges lovingly tries to look after her but is constantly faced with the inevitability of heartbreak. A realist masterpiece, Amour perfectly captures the cycle of life and the unrelentingly difficult process of letting go.

The Pittsburgh Symphony Orchestra (PSO)’s performance of Gustav Holst’s The Planets was definitely the most heavily advertised event last weekend at Heinz Hall. But tucked at the beginning of the program was an event with local flavor: the world premiere of the PSO’s “Elements” series, a piece commissioned from five Pittsburgh composers by the Orchestra.  
Among those five composers is Reza Vali, a Carnegie Mellon professor of composition and director of research and education at the Center for Iranian Music on campus, which Vali co-founded last year. Vali wrote one of the five movements in the piece, connected to the other movements by a common motif: the elements — fire, earth, wind, water, and metal.  
Vali chose water. As a Pittsburgh composer, he’s inspired by the bodies of water that shape the city. His favorite is the Youghiogheny River, a wide body of water that flows into the Monongahela River, one of the three rivers of Pittsburgh. “Pittsburgh is the city of rivers,” he said. “But I particularly like the Yough.”  
The river inspired the name for Vali’s movement: “Ravân.” The title is a Persian word meaning “flowing,” but its root comes from the Persian verb ravar. Sound like an English word you know?  “If you say ‘river’ in the Pittsburgh dialect, you get very close to that,” Vali said. 
Despite his love of Pittsburgh rivers, Vali grew up on the other side of the globe. He was born in Qazvin, Iran, about 100 miles north of Tehran. When he was young, his father bought an accordion for his younger brother — but Vali picked it up instead. He was too small to play it upright, so he laid it on the ground, playing it by pushing and pulling it horizontally across the floor.   
When he was 13, Vali read in a magazine that the great 20th-century composer Béla Bartók had collected Hungarian folk music. “The idea of collecting folk music really appealed to me,” he said. He began doing research of his own, recording the oral traditions of Persian musicians on cassette tapes. In his studies, first at the Tehran Conservatory of Music and later at the Academy of Music in Vienna, Vali immersed himself in Western music, but he eventually found himself drawn back to Persian music.  
The Persian music system is called dastgah — a word that comes from the roots for “hand” and “place,” named for the act of pressing fingers to a fingerboard. After opening his eyes to dastgah for the first time, Vali said, “It kind of blew my mind.” 
“Persian music intervals are different,” Vali explained. The Persian octave has 24 notes, as opposed to the 12 in a Western chromatic scale, so Persian musicians actually have more notes at their disposal than traditional classical composers. In the Western system, these would be called half-tones or quarter-tones: pitches that don’t count as “true” notes because they lie between the notes of the Western system. 
But Vali faced a serious obstacle in his desire to pursue dastgah. In order to understand Persian music, he said, “You have to play a Persian instrument, and I couldn’t.”   
As a trombonist, Vali was too practiced in Western music to easily pick up a Persian instrument. Furthermore, dastgah is an oral system; according to Vali, it takes 25 to 30 years to become a proficient Persian musician, just because the process of memorizing the music takes so long.  
But Vali was determined. His solution? If he couldn’t pick up a Persian instrument, he would invent one. “I cheated,” Vali joked, explaining, “I wanted to know how the system really works.” Thus, the arghonoon was born — a silent keyboard hooked up to a computer, which uses software to send a pitch back to the instrument.  
Vali’s work is now based primarily in dastgah. “Ravân,” of course, was an exception; writing a piece for Western instruments in Persian scales would essentially be asking those musicians to relearn how to play. “It would be a nightmare,” Vali said. Several Western instruments, like the oboe, don’t even have the capacity to play pitches between notes.  But these limitations haven’t stopped Vali, or some of his colleagues. Vali recently struck a deal with Neal Berntsen, a professor of trumpet and chair of the brass division at Carnegie Mellon. Vali would compose a piece for Berntsen for trumpet, but only if Berntsen learned to play Persian trumpet.  
Incredibly, Berntsen complied. He ordered a custom alteration to one of his trumpets, adding a fourth tab to the instrument. This tab could lower the pitch of a note by a quarter of a tone, allowing the trumpet to play the notes-between-notes dictated by the Persian system. The result was, as Vali called it, a microtonal trumpet.  
With diverse pursuits in both musical traditions, Vali found himself immersed first in Western music, then in Persian music, and finally in a fusion of the two. As for his Persian trumpet collaboration with Berntsen, Vali hopes it will be ready for the Brevard Music Center Festival in North Carolina, where he hopes to premiere it this summer.

[BOLD]Dear Matt & Ryan,
Valentine’s Day is the worst. I’m always single and have nothing to do, and all of my friends have significant others so while they go out and have fun together, I’m all alone in my room with nothing but my laptop and sadness for company. Can you give me some advice on how to pass the worst weekend in the world? I’m sure you’ve dealt with this kind of thing in the past.
Sincerely,
Sad Over Acquired Loneliness, Only Neighbor is Edible
Dear SO ALONE,[BOLD]
First of all, we have no idea what you’re talking about. We are two extremely handsome, debonair, and intelligent men who have never had trouble wooing a lady for Valentine’s Day. That said we do have … friends … who have had to deal with being alone on this day. At any rate, here’s a few ideas that we’ve found tried and true … for our friends, of course.
1) Ice cream. Eat all of it. All. Of. It. 
2) Watch an action movie. No romance or anything. 
3) Play a video game. 
4) Get together with your friends who aren’t doing anything and go out. 
Above all, don’t wallow in your own misery. So what if it’s Valentine’s Day? It’s just another day. Call up your friends.
[BOLD]But don’t call me, I’ll be in Canada,
Ryan & Matt
Dear Matt & Ryan,
I’m freaking out. You know   awkwardfamilyphotos.com? My family’s Thanksgiving photo just made it on the front page. It has only been up for a day, and already has 743 likes, and 312 shares on Facebook! I’m doomed. No one will ever talk to me again, and my family will be the next big meme, like the Star Wars kid, Doge, or that one with the porcupine. What do I do?
Miraculously Elected Major Entertainment, But Alas, Internet Talks
Dear MEME BAIT,[BOLD]
It now has 745 likes and 314 shares on Facebook. Matt and I thought it was hilarious. Unfortunately, as you know, once an image is on the Internet, its there forever. There are a few solutions: You can change your name and try to get into the witness protection program, or figure out who leaked the photo and retaliate. However, what is probably in your best interest, is to sit back and enjoy your 15 minutes of fame. Also, do you know how many stupid images people post everyday? Chances are, very few of those 314 shares are actually genuine clicks to the image. Plus, there will be a new very popular meme by the time this goes to print anyway. I don’t even remember the Star Wars kid.
[BOLD]Go search for cat GIFs­ ­— you’ll feel better,
Ryan & Matt.[BOLD]

Starting in 2015, Carnegie Mellon’s beloved tradition of Spring Carnival will be relocated from the parking lot of Morewood Gardens to the parking lot of the College of Fine Arts (CFA). A town hall meeting was held last Thursday in the University Center’s Danforth Lounge to inform the student population about the changes.
In November, David Tepper announced a generous donation of $67 million to help finance the construction of the new Tepper School of Business, which will be built in the parking lot where Spring Carnival is currently held. Although not yet officially decided and announced to the public, the relocation of Carnival has been discussed since last June, according to Tim Leonard, coordinator of student activities, who led the town hall.
Although it presents a major change, some students recognize the benefits of moving Carnival.
Junior communication design major Sam Ahmed said, “I think it’s better that Carnival will be in the middle of campus, rather than on a parking lot by the freshmen dorms. It makes more sense than for Carnival to be so far.”
The Office of Student Activities also considered Gesling Stadium, the East-West Walkway, and the fourth floor of the East Campus Garage as possible locations for Spring Carnival. All of these locations presented their own challenges — because of Gesling Stadium’s brand new turf, for example, the university would be forced to cover the whole stadium so that the turf wouldn’t be ruined, a procedure that is both tedious and costly, according to Leonard.As a result, Leonard said, CFA parking lot and lawn appeared to be the least complicated and most efficient choice.
As of now, booth will take place in the CFA parking lot. The Main Tent, where the comedian will perform, will be on CFA lawn, while the rides will be on the CFA lawn and the Mall.
Last but not least, the concert will take place on the Mall. Since Carnival will predominantly surround the CFA building, Student Activities has recognized the potential of noise complaints from CFA professors and students.
Freshmen fine arts major Bridget Quirk said, “I think CFA students are already so used to things going on around the building, so I don’t think the students will be really affected by the noise.”
On average, about 25 student organizations participate in Booth for Carnival, Leonard said. 
The location will not be completely finalized until the next academic year, when Student Activities will get the final count of participating groups.
As part of Carnegie Mellon’s Kappa Alpha Theta sorority, first-year decision science major Colleen Hamilton said, “I think it will be harder for those in the Greek Quad to bring stuff over for booth to CFA. It also looks like there is less space for everything to fit, but other than that, I don’t have any major concerns.” Hamilton, who lives in Pittsburgh, has frequently attended Spring Carnival in the past, and predicts that the event will remain enjoyable and popular in its new location.
Leonard and Student Activities have consulted and will continue to consult with Alumni Relations, AB Tech, and many other committees before the next academic year. 
The next steps to finalize the relocation include continued collaboration with faculty and figuring out the specific placement of booths and rides, according to Leonard.

Carnegie Mellon announced that the average undergraduate tuition rates for the 2014–15 academic year will increase by 2.9 percent. 
This increase places tuition for incoming students and current first-years at $48,030. 
For sophomore students, the tuition will be $47,560, and for juniors and seniors, the tuition will be $47,110. Tuition rates for graduate students are set at the program or college level. 
This 2.9 percent increase in tuition is similar to the percentage increases made in past years, with tuition rising by 3 percent last year, and 4 percent the year prior to that.
The official communication sent by email detailing the increase also detailed that the housing fee for a standard double room will be $7,280, and the standard first-year meal plan will cost $5,120. 
The email states that this new pricing results in a 3 percent increase in the total cost of attending the university.Some required payments by students, such as the activities fee and technology fee, are also higher this year. 
The activities fee is rising to $242 in the upcoming year from the previous value of $194, the technology fee is increasing from $360 to $380, and the transportation fee is now $120 instead of $110. These various fees contribute in different ways to the student experience at Carnegie Mellon.
The official email sent by Vice President for Campus Affairs Michael Murphy acknowledged the financial burden that increased tuition places on families and students, but stated that this increase is “relatively modest” and “is consistent with our goal of containing costs and managing our resources appropriately.” 
Murphy justified the increase by saying, “we will continue to invest in key priorities, including financial aid support for eligible students, and to work with you to maintain and enhance our uniquely vibrant and engaged undergraduate experience, just as you deserve.”
Students are frustrated with the continually rising tuition, and many feel kept out of the loop. 
Although a campus-wide email was sent out about the raise in tuition, many students still feel like it’s unclear where their money is going. 
“I would like [the administration] to keep me more informed,” said sophomore chemical engineering and biomedical engineering double major Liz Starck. 
Starck said that she wishes the university would be more transparent.  “Did they say anywhere what the money is going toward? Didn’t we get some huge donations recently? What is the point of this tuition raise?” 
Starck was referring to the $67 million donation by David Tepper, announced in November on the day of President Subra Suresh’s inauguration. 
Sophomore biology and psychology double major Su Baykal said that, for her, nothing could excuse this year’s increase in tuition. “[The increase] is definitely not justified. Unless tuition is divided by five, it will not be justified for me — even if they don’t raise it,” Baykal said via email.  
The announcement also stated that undergraduate student fees include $120 for the Port Authority, $380 for technology, a $246 activity fee, and a $10 media fee.

In a recent interview with Emma Watson for Wonderland magazine, J.K. Rowling, came out of left field to take a kick at perhaps one of the most cherished aspects of Harry Potter: Ron and Hermione’s romance. During the interview, Rowling admitted to Watson that Hermione might have been better off with Harry.
This revelation sent shock waves through the social networking world, and soon enough, fans voiced their confusion, anger, and disappointment. Tweets ranged from expressing heartbreak to denial to triumph as long-settled shipping wars erupted again throughout the fandom.
As a fan of the series, and having read all the books cover to cover, I was a little perplexed by the buzz surrounding Rowling’s comments. After all, Rowling has made similar comments in the past, such as declaring Dumbledore to be gay and stating that she seriously considered killing off Ron halfway through the series.
But Rowling’s comments beg the question: Why do the fans care so much about what Rowling says? In fact, why are fans angry that she has come out and said what she has about Ron and Hermione’s relationship? 
It’s extremely important to note that she had been answering questions in an interview — a formal venue that is sure to guarantee fan buzz online. Aren’t we, the fans, the reason that she feels prompted to throw these details out during such an interview?
Moreover, Rowling has left us with this comment and has obviously angered some of Harry Potter fandom. Fans are angry because they are taking her comments to heart. I don’t think we should. 
As readers, we should evaluate a piece of work as it stood when published, not what the piece of work could have been. In fact, does Rowling’s post-writing opinion on the novels matter at all?
Harry Potter should stand alone as a series. Even though Rowling is the author and Harry Potter was her work of art, any commentary or inference should be based on the work itself. 
Rowling can say anything about the novel, but the fact is that it really doesn’t matter. Rowling stated that the reason she wanted Ron and Hermione together was out of a personal choice, and not for literary reasons. 
What fans and Rowling alike are forgetting is that novels, and artwork in general, are reflections of an author’s personal choices, and these choices do not have to be strictly artistic or literary. If they were, we would be left with a dry piece of work, devoid of any humanity that makes art moving or relatable.
As an artist, Rowling is allowed to look back and wistfully think, “I wish this” and “I wish that.” That response is natural, and it is her right to develop as both a writer and an artist. Readers and fans alike should not allow any of Rowling’s thoughts, however, to affect the way in which they read and interpret the text. 
Even if Rowling had made some point or suggested some change that fans found agreeable, readers should still focus on the novel itself because, as a work of art, it is relevant only to the specific context in which it was created. 
The shifting thoughts from the author or society should not change people’s relationship with the original text.

The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) just released a fatal report  about the effects of the Affordable Care Act (ACA) on the economy. According to this report, the comprehensive healthcare reform bill will result in a decline of working hours equating to the loss of 2.3 million jobs by 2021. Additionally, the CBO reports that by 2024, this country will still have 31 million nonelderly uninsured.
This bill represents nearly everything that can go wrong in our republic, and its passage, content, and implementation are not only making the middle class incredibly worse off, but are also threatening the very fabric of the government that by and large has worked for us throughout American history.
Let’s start at the stage of passage. This bill was jammed through Congress on a completely party-line vote in just about a week. Several members of Congress hadn’t even read the bill, and a few were bought out by the administration, in particular Louisiana and Nebraska senators, who saw their states receive extra federal money or other benefits in exchange for their votes for the bill.
Minority leader of the United States House of Representatives Nancy Pelosi famously said, “We have to pass the bill to find out what’s in it.” Aside from all of this shadiness, former senator Scott Brown (R–Mass.) won a Senate election in deep blue Massachusetts campaigning as “Scott Brown 41,” to represent that he’d be the 41st vote to sustain a filibuster against the bill. However, the bill was passed — using a technique called budget reconciliation that’s not meant for this type of bill — before Scott Brown could take office.
The passage of this bill is a perfect representation of tyranny in the majority that our founders feared. In the Federalist papers, James Madison spoke of our party system as a way to guard against the “superior force of an interested and overbearing majority.”
This isn’t democracy. This isn’t the will of the people. According to RealClearPolitics.com, the ACA’s disapproval rating has always been higher than its approval rating.
Now let’s look at its implementation. Aside from a completely mismanaged rollout that required a Bain Capital executive to fix, the ACA was sold to the American people on false promises. At several points throughout his candidacy and this debate, President Barack Obama promised that the ACA would lower the average family’s premium by $2,500 a year, lower the country’s overall expenditure on healthcare, not raise taxes on the middle class, allow patients to keep their health plans if they like them, allow patients to keep their doctors if they like them, and not add a penny to the deficit.
The ACA breaks all of these promises. According to the recent CBO report, the ACA will raise federal revenues by $1.058 trillion over the next 10 years. Seventy percent of this revenue will come from couples earning less than $250,000 a year and individuals earning less than $200,000 a year. Since Obama took office, the average family’s premium rose by nearly $3,000 per year — a far cry from a $2,500 reduction.
Additionally, government actuaries in Obama’s own administration have found the act will increase healthcare spending in the country by $621 billion over the next 10 years, according to cms.gov. Again, these facts are a far cry from Obama’s claims that the ACA will bend the cost curve down and lower our country’s overall spending on healthcare.
On to Obama’s most famous promise, that those who liked their health insurance could keep it. It’s been well chronicled that, because of the ACA’s minimum standards for coverage, people whose plans didn’t cover all 10 ludicrous areas of coverage saw their plans cancelled.
We’re down to the final two points. Because the cost of covering all 10 areas of minimum coverage are so high, insurers have narrowed the network of healthcare providers that patients can see in order to reduce costs, which has caused tons of people to lose access to the doctors they liked and had relationships with. Even people with cancer or other serious chronic medical issues are losing access to specialists who were familiar with their circumstances.
Finally, as far as adding to the deficit, the CBO’s recent report indicates that the ACA will spur anemic economic growth, as we will have fewer people working than we do now. Because of this growth, deficits are projected to rise at a rate faster than they have in recent years, and will greatly exceed the deficits we have now or have had during Obama’s term by the end of the CBO’s projection period of 10 years.
As much as I love being right, I really wish I wasn’t. Sure, you can tout benefits of the act like free birth control, but we all know that it isn’t actually free. We’re just paying for it through the cost of higher premiums. This bill takes away all consumer choice, and any economist will tell you that the way to make people better off is to increase the options they have.
If these effects weren’t enough, the way that the ACA has been handled by the Obama administration has broken our system of government. Obama has amended the law by executive order so much that another president opposed to the law could just take office and on day one amend the bill into extinction.
Additionally, what nobody is talking about are the effects that this bill has had on our democratic process. Republicans looking at an immigration reform compromise entailing a path to amnesty for immigrants that are here, in addition to increased border security, are skeptical of their plan actually coming to fruition. 
They believe that if they pass a bill, a path to amnesty will be created — but Obama could just write out the increased border security via executive order.
This atmosphere is breaking our already dysfunctional government and sowing the seeds of mistrust amongst our people. Historians will not look back on Obama as a president that united a people and made our government work. His will be remembered as the presidency that started the slow unraveling of our government through deceit and a willful nonchalance toward the Constitution.

One of the most talked-about commercials from this year’s Super Bowl was not a comedic one from Budweiser or Geico, but what was meant to be a moving and inspiring video from Coca-Cola. The company's advertisement depicted Americans of various ethnic backgrounds singing "America the Beautiful” in seven foreign languages. While many people saw the commercial as representative of the diversity and heart of America, many were outraged by the idea of it.
Following the airing of the commercial, hashtags such as #boycottcoke and #f***coke quickly made it to the top of Twitter’s trending list. Critics of the commercial expressed their dissatisfaction with Coca-Cola in statements such as one Twitter user's prominent comment “Nice to see that coke likes to sing an AMERICAN song in the terrorist's language. Way to go coke. You can leave America.” Traditionalists argue that true Americans speak English.
It is sickening that people try to take a message of hatred out of a commercial with a message of unity. After all, almost all Americans descend from people that were once immigrants of a foreign country. 
Many conservatives, such as former congressman Allen West (R-Fla.), have expressed their dismay at the commercial. In a blog post on his website, West described Coca-Cola as a "company as American as they come" and stated that this “truly disturbing commercial” was a sign that "we are on the road to perdition." 
What is scary is that the West actually believes that increased diversity and acceptance of others is leading America to some form of eternal punishment. By making such a statement, he is violating the principles of his own Christian religion and insulting the reputation of those that are truly religious by those principles. 
The controversy caused by this commercial is completely ridiculous. Coca-Cola's decision to air the commercial was a logical one, as they have recently received criticism for being a major sponsor of this year’s Sochi 2014 Winter Olympics in Russia, a nation that recently legislated strong anti-gay laws. Coca-Cola's commercial, with its inclusion of people from diverse backgrounds, as well as the first gay couple to be shown in a Super Bowl commercial, showed that the company does not support discrimination against any culture or lifestyle.
Additionally, critics of this commercial are wrong to claim that English is the official language of the United States. Yes, English dominates all industry and media in America. However, according to the U.S. Census Bureau, 60 million people in the United States speak a language other than English at home, and 7 percent exclusively speak a language other than English.
Does the fact that this 7 percent does not speak English make them less American than you or I? America does not have a universal culture, but an array of cultures from around the world. This array of cultures is what makes our nation different. When conservatives associated the foreign languages spoken by the people in this commercial with illegal immigration and terrorism, they essentially insulted all members of cultural communities, such as Chinatowns, Germantowns, and countless others. These communities embody the heritage of the people living in them, and how are they any less American than the small homogeneous communities of Caucasians or African-Americans speaking English? America is not a Caucasian community, nor is it only a Chinatown or Germantown. America is a melting pot.
Over the past century, America has made extensive progress in civil rights and equality. However, the fact that many still associate a single language with the nation shows that there is progress still to be made and that many are reluctant to change. Perhaps if Coca-Cola airs the same commercial in 20 years, people will simply see it as another ordinary, uncontroversial commercial, or better yet, as an accurate representation of this nation.

Last Wednesday, CVS Caremark — America’s most profitable chain drugstore — announced its intention to stop selling tobacco products. The transition, nearly unprecedented in major retail history, will be completed by October.
According to company executives, the decision arose from a desire to bring the company’s future plans in line with its current actions. CVS leads the trend of drugstores becoming increasingly affiliated with the American healthcare system. Of course, drugstores offering prescriptions and flu shots is nothing new, but CVS and others are becoming more and more like mini-clinics. Currently, the company employs over 26,000 nurse practitioners and pharmacists who are responsible for everything from consultation and diagnosis to basic care, according to The New York Times.
CVS plans to continue moving in this direction, and so — in its eyes — cutting out tobacco may have been the only reasonable decision. Miraculously, a company in the retail industry recognized hypocrisy when it was staring it in the face and determined it wanted no part of it. For a company dedicated to serving people’s health, continuing to sell a product that remains the single most prominent preventable cause of disease, disability, and death in the United States would have been hypocrisy at its most heinous.
It’s hard to comprehend anyone being opposed to such a sensible, positive decision — even to smokers, it is likely to be only a minor inconvenience — but there are always the critics.
Fox News has loudly expressed concerns about the legality of a private business choosing to deny the public the cigarettes that are their right, according to Media Matters for America. If you think this stance contradicts Fox News’s usual support of ethos in the free market, you’d be right.
In fact, the only way to make sense of the channel’s reaction is to consider President Obama’s outspoken approval of the CVS initiative. Fox News evidently views CVS banning tobacco as yet another example of Obamacare shoving its greedy fingers into everything Americans hold dear. Then again, Fox News would surely find an objection to strawberry ice cream if they found out Obama had a particular liking for it.
So CVS made the right call — despite the fact that it estimates the move will cost them $2 billion in tobacco-related sales. No one reasonably expects to see a huge drop in smoking rates as a result of the change. There will always be another store at which to fuel smokers’ addictions. However, CVS hopes that others will follow its example and that the trend they launched will eventually culminate in noticeable change.
In the meantime, CVS plans to initiate a program this spring designed to get smokers to quit. For reasons both of making up for lost revenue and cementing its anti-tobacco reputation, CVS plans to help half a million smokers recover.
It would be foolish to depict CVS as a hero, selflessly protecting America’s health. Despite their healthcare leanings, CVS is still a retail company, primarily on the lookout for its own best interest.
In this light, removing tobacco from shelves makes perfect practical sense, as doing so lines up with its healthcare image.
But is that so bad? Regardless of their interests or their intentions, CVS is doing a good thing for this country and its people, and inspiring others to take its example. CVS does not necessarily deserve praise, but its initiative does. A little selfishness can go a long way for a positive outcome.

Phillip Seymour Hoffman died of an accidental drug overdose last Sunday. The 46-year-old actor won an Academy Award for Best Actor in the 2005 film Capote, and received three Tony nominations for his extensive work in theater, according to The Washington Post. The actor relapsed into drug use after 23 years of sobriety.
Hoffman’s death from heroin overdose was both a tragedy, and an important reminder that addiction is a medical problem, not a moral one.
Hoffman was sober for 23 years until a relapse in May 2013, according to Slate magazine. Drug addiction causes serious and permanent changes in the human brain, rewiring neural pathways and altering neurochemical reactions, according to the Journal of Neuroscience. Hoffman’s long period of sobriety did not change the fact that his brain had been fundamentally altered by drug use.
People with addiction problems have the same inability to control their condition as a person with any other disease, according to the Journal of Neuroscience. 
Addiction is not a condition that can be solved with a 28-day stint in a rehabilitation center or forced away through sheer willpower; it is a lifelong and ongoing condition that requires constant management.
Despite these facts, our judicial system tends toward punishing addicts as if they were criminals, rather than seriously ill people in need of medical care. 
The United States represents 5 percent of the world’s total population, but accounts for 25 percent of its prison population. An estimated 75 percent of incarcerated people have some kind of problem with drugs or alcohol, according to the Center for Addiction Management. Nearly 25,000 people are convicted on federal drug charges every year, according to NBC.
Hoffman’s death was certainly a tragedy, for his family and for the acting community at large. It also revealed the importance of recognizing addiction for the disease that it is, instead of criminalizing addicts for needing help.

Last June, Carnegie Mellon’s chapter of Beta Theta Pi came under fire for several allegations of sexual misconduct on campus. The fraternity was suspended in the midst of these allegations of filming and distributing sexually explicit videos. 
The suspension was followed by the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU)’s formal complaint against the university for violating the federal Clery Act of 1990, according to the Huffington Post. Under Title IX, with its intent of achieving gender equity, colleges receiving federal funding are required to respond to matters of sexual misconduct and to have preventative measures in place to prevent such matters.
Our university is not an anomaly. According to Tyler Kingkade, who has spent more than a year reporting for The Huffington Post on sexual assault cases on college campuses, the U.S. Department of Education received 30 complaints pertaining to the mishandling of sexual violence cases in the university setting in the 2013 fiscal year. This is a marked increase from 2012, when the department received only 17 complaints.
On one hand, an increase in sexual assault reports is upsetting because it proves the prevalence of the crime on college campuses nationally. 
However, Kingkade points out in an email that “just because a number is high doesn’t mean there are more sexual assaults at a school. It’s likely the opposite; that a high number means more women feel comfortable reporting.” 
The number of sexual assault reports in the college setting will only continue to increase as people feel more comfortable making them, which should be seen as a good thing. Through his experience, Kingkade compiled an infographic that pinpoints those schools accused of mishandling sexual assault cases — information he gathered by “remaining connected with victims and constantly bugging the Education Department to stay on top of it.” 
However, there exists no official report of exactly which schools were accused; the only people who know for certain are “a handful of attorneys and their staff” in the Department of Education”, according to the infographic.
This information should be public knowledge, and the Department of Education should release a formal report on the accused schools. 
While one could argue that an accusation doesn’t necessarily mean that a sexual assault occurred at that school, the likelihood is high, since sexual assault cases are severely underreported, according to USA Today.
Hopefully, as society grows more open and people feel more comfortable reporting it, sexual assault will cease to be an underreported crime.

Last week, sophomore directing major John Moriarity spoke to Student Senate on behalf of the “Anything But Coke” protest group.
“Anything But Coke” encourages participants to boycott Coca-Cola products in opposition to the Coca-Cola company’s sponsorship of the 2014 Winter Olympic Games in Sochi, Russia. 
With Russia’s opposition to gay rights and freedoms, this group views Coke-Cola’s sponsorship of the events as taking a stance against gay rights.
Moriarity encouraged Student Senate to vote to formally recommend to the university that campus stores cease the sale of Coca-Cola products for the duration of the 2014 Winter Olympics. 
Senate approved the motion and will be following the recommendation.
This recommendation is an ineffective form of protest and violates the consumer rights of Carnegie Mellon students. If students wish to boycott the products of the Coca-Cola company, they can do so voluntarily. 
However, these actions make those who are not in full support of the “Anything But Coke” protest participate without choice. If a campus group opposed the use of contraception and tried to ban Entropy+ from selling condoms, that would be unacceptable. 
Unless the store owner refuses to carry an item in his or her shop, another group should not have the power to ban others from purchasing it.
Additionally, the selection of Coca-Cola as the sole product to protest makes little sense. Visa sponsors the 2014 Winter Olympics, yet protesters are not trying to prevent campus stores from accepting Visa cards.
The Olympics are often viewed as an international competition that raises national spirits and can bring representatives of the world together. The fact that they are hosted in a nation that does not support gay rights is troubling, and the Russian government should face immense international pressure to alter this stance.
However, these games are not the first that have been hosted in a country that did not respect the rights of all people, and Coca-Cola is just one of many sponsors for the athletic competitions. 
This sponsorship does not necessarily indicate a support of Russian political policies, and banning individuals from the ability to make their own purchasing choices is an unacceptable option to protest gay persecution in Russia.
