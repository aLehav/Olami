Fans of Carnegie Mellon University’s women’s volleyball were in for a treat last weekend, as the team won every single one of their final four home games. The Tartans' clean sweep began on Friday afternoon, in the first game against the Hiram College Terriers. 
Though the home team took an early lead, the visitors fought back, overtaking them by six points to four in the first set. The Tartans responded immediately and earned six consecutive points — the final a service ace by senior Kayla Yew — to make the score 10-6. A timeout called by Hiram seemed to stall Carnegie Mellon’s momentum, but only temporarily, and though the Terriers scored several more points, they were unable to match the pace of the Tartans, who continued to score thanks to well-aimed kills from the likes of senior Erika Foose, along with a service ace by junior Diana Balta. Carnegie Mellon went on to win the first set by an impressive score of 25-12.
Hiram came back strong in the second set, and though Carnegie Mellon took the lead by a margin of 6-1, the Terriers caught up quickly. Both teams traded points until the very end of the set. A final push beginning with a service ace by Foose and continuing with kills by sophomores Vivian Beaudoin and Carrie Stewart gave the Tartans the second set with a much closer 25-22 scoreline. Though Hiram scored first in the third set, a series of six kills courtesy of senior Sahara Aqui and Beaudoin gave Carnegie Mellon a sizable lead — a margin that only expanded as the game went on. With a service ace by sophomore Anna Cao, the Tartans took the set 25-12 and the game 3-0.
The Carnegie Mellon team averaged a considerably strong kill percentage of .333, with Beaudoin scoring the most points — 12.5 points out of the total 51 were attributed to her.
The second game on Friday was against Southwestern University, and the Tartans started strongly, with a series of six points being scored, one being a service ace from senior Maia So-Holloway. Although Southwestern tried to respond, their efforts were outmatched and Carnegie Mellon won the first set 25-15, the final point coming from an efficient service ace by first-year Stella Yan. 
Though the beginning of the second set saw the visitors attempt to gain momentum off of scoring the first two points, a service ace by junior Julia Kim opened the scoring for the Carnegie Mellon side. Both teams traded points for the rest of the set, however, and it progressed much like the first, finishing 25-16 in favor of the Tartans.
Southwestern gave the third set their best effort, reaching set point with a four-point lead, consecutive well-placed kills, a service ace from Yew, and a strong block by Foose and Beaudoin ensured that Carnegie Mellon would come back from behind to win the set 26-24 and the game 3-0.
The Tartans averaged a kill percentage of .298. The scoring distribution seemed to be more spread, with Beaudoin leading in terms of points scored at 9.5 points out of the total 54, followed closely by Aqui and Stewart with nine points each, along with Foose and Cao with 8.5 points each.
Saturday’s opponents were tougher. In the first set of the match against the SUNY Geneseo Knights, the Tartans looked strong, taking the lead right away and winning by a formidable 25-14. Geneseo responded with intensity in the second set, however, and scored five consecutive points right off the bat. A timeout called by Carnegie Mellon stifled their momentum, though, and the Tartans responded in kind, with several solid kills and a service ace from Yan bringing the scoreline to 8-9. 
The Knights then extended their lead to 13-10, but, once again, the Carnegie Mellon team caught up, thanks to a strong kill by sophomore Erin Westberg, an attack error on the part of Geneseo, and a service ace from Foose. The Knights still managed to hold off the Tartans, winning the set 25-17. 
The third set was tightly contested, with both teams trading points all the way to the end of the set. Consecutive kills from Stewart and Beaudoin allowed Carnegie Mellon to take the set with a margin of 28-26. 
The fourth set was close as well, but well-timed kills gave the Knights the set, 25-21. Geneseo took the lead early on in the final set, but steady attacks from the Tartans earned them seven consecutive points. Though the Knights attempted to respond, they were outmatched, and a service ace from Cao and forceful kills from Cao, Westberg, and Foose saw Carnegie Mellon emerge as the victor, winning the set 15-6 and the game 3-2.
The home team finished the match with an average kill percentage of .256, with the top scorer being Beaudoin once again, earning a total of 16 points out of 73.
The Saturday evening game against Ohio Wesleyan University marked the last home game of the season, or Senior night. The game itself was once again hotly contested, and though Carnegie Mellon gained a short lead thanks to a service ace by Yew, Ohio Wesleyan quickly caught up. However, kills from Beaudoin, Foose, and Westberg, along with a few Ohio Wesleyan attack errors saw the Tartans open up the margin — one they maintained till the end of the set, allowing them to take the first set 25-20. 
Ohio Wesleyan bounced back in the second set, and despite a strong performance from the Tartans including service aces from So-Holloway and Cao, consecutive kills by Ohio Wesleyan saw the visitors steal away the second set 21-25. 
The home team managed to secure a six point lead early on in the third set, but Ohio Wesleyan caught up. Both teams traded points, tying at 24-24 before a service error and a phenomenal block by Cao and Aqui granted Carnegie Mellon the victory at 26-24. The fourth set began with both teams vying for a win. A service ace from Yew, along with a series of powerful kills from Foose, Cao, and Aqui opened up the margin in the beginning, and though Ohio Wesleyan attempted to fire back, the Tartan defense held strong. 
A final offensive push saw the Tartans score seven consecutive points — two of those points from service aces by Yan to take the set 25-13 and the game 3-1.
Although the average kill percentage was relatively lower compared to the others in the same weekend at .214, it was still an exceptional senior night game. The top scorer was Foose, to whom 13.5 of the 68 total points scored by Carnegie Mellon were attributed. With an individual kill percentage of .476, this seemed like an excellent final home game for Foose.
These latest victories bring the overall win record up to 21-5 and the home win record up to 9-1. With a five game winning streak, the Tartans look poised and ready, bringing incredible momentum into the UAA Championship Quarterfinal on Friday against New York University.

On Oct. 30, the Washington Nationals captured the World Series in Game 7 against the Houston Astros with a score of 6-2. As a Washington D.C. native and Nationals fan, I was obviously excited to see the Nationals capture their first World Series, giving D.C. its first World Series since 1924. But it was especially shocking to see the Nationals add to a remarkable turnaround in D.C. sports.
These Nationals had already done D.C. proud by being the first Washington D.C. baseball team to make the World Series since 1933. Additionally, they accomplished what previous iterations of the Nationals could not, in that the journey there was fun for the fans. The Nationals of the past few years were crushed under the weight of high expectations. 
Bryce Harper, a former National League MVP and Nationals superstar, left for the Phillies in free agency before the 2019 season, and the Nationals were pronounced dead before a game had even been played.
The Nationals seemed to be another D.C. team that could never get over the hump, going 19-31 in their first 50 games. The Washington Capitals- the NHL team for Washington, D.C. — had won the Stanley Cup Championship in 2018, but they endured a long stretch of early playoff exits beforehand. The Nationals were never going to do any better than that. At least, that was what most people thought. 
But the Nationals exploded after a players meeting and some in-season acquisitions like pinch hitter Gerardo Parra. The Nationals went 74-38 the rest of the way to get into the playoffs and battled to defeat the over 100-win Los Angeles Dodgers and Astros.
Most impressive about their run was the culture that the team built for their D.C. fans. Like the Washington Capitals of 2018, the Nationals played relaxed and loose. The minimal expectations of the 2019 season allowed them to play freely, and they began to surge with this new mindset. Parra famously added to the team’s fun when he made his walk-up music "Baby Shark," a catchy kids' song with an accompanying dance.
It's clear now how much this change in culture meant to the Nationals. They not only had fun and won games, but they also brought in a new generation of Nationals fans while bringing back some older, casual ones. It was clear how different these Nationals were when Parra came in to the 6th inning of games and Nationals Park would erupt with fans singing "Baby Shark." Win or lose, they were a fan favorite.
Now that they have won, the Nationals seem to have everyone in D.C. paying attention (who isn't a Dodgers fan). They became favorites in part because they won, but they would have still given D.C. a great team to root for had they not. Juan Soto's goofy plate rituals, Sean Doolittle's lightsaber skills, and the dugout dance parties highlighted how fun the Nationals were and gave fans more to cheer for than baseball. With NHL and WNBA championship wins since 2018, Washington D.C. now has the Nationals as another great team capping off the resurgence of D.C. sports.

This is Penalty Shouts, The Tartan’s sports column inspired by the The New Yorker’s column Daily Shouts. This satire-fueled column will focus on anything and everything funny in the sports world that is deserving of our comedic attention.
I usually like to keep penalty shouts pretty short. After all, brevity is the soul of wit or something. But this past week, there was a news story that hit close to home, as the interim editor-in-chief of Deadspin was fired after refusing to capitulate to the demands of their owners, G/O Media Group.
Usually, Deadspin does exclusively sports coverage. However, their current owners recently pushed a mandate that boiled down to “stick to sports,” and sticking to sports coverage is not a good look for anybody. Exclusive sports coverage doesn’t make money and is often extremely tedious.
Additionally, the political suggestions of asking people to “stick to sports,” as Colin Kaepernick has been told many times, ignores that placing sports in a box where it has no connection to the real world and is simple entertainment means there is nothing to it. There is no meaning behind the violence perpetrated in any sport. The thousands of deaths in professional sports in the 20th and 21st century look no different than a death in a gladiator’s ring. We watch the NFL per panem et circenses.
As of Friday, all of the writing and editing staff at Deadspin quit their jobs in protest. It’s been a long few months, where the company has changed hands twice from Gawker Media to Great Hill Media to G/O Media, and the interim editor in chief rose to the position after the previous editor in chief left because of her relationship to Great Hill Media.
Megan Greenwell, the old editor in chief who quit because of Great Hill Media, published an essay on her last day of work for Deadspin titled ("The Adults in the Room")[https://theconcourse.deadspin.com/the-adults-in-the-room-1837487584]. She writes, “A metastasizing swath of media is controlled by private-equity vultures and capricious billionaires and other people who genuinely believe that they are rich because they are smart and that they are smart because they are rich.” In the essay, she talks about how everyone in the writer’s room just wants to help the company make more money, but the supposed adults in the room — the owners of the media groups — refuse to play the part. They won’t listen to the people who know where the money comes from.
Our newspaper, The Tartan, doesn’t really have to worry about money, fortunately. We do sort of, but if we really got into trouble, the college would be there to help us out. Although, it might mean that the college (read: corporation) would try to turn us into another media office of theirs. We would have no obligation to report on anything, except the things the corporation would tell us to report. Currently, our only obligations are to ideals of newspapering. I couldn’t imagine what it would be like to have another person’s agenda breathing down your neck, like the case of Deadspin.
How do I make this funny? It’s been, like, a news article so far. How am I going to dig myself out of this hole? First, break the fourth wall. Second, follow in the footsteps of a canonized satire. With the first step complete, it’s time to "A Modest Proposal" this situation.
I’m inside the offices of Deadspin right now, and it’s a ghost town. Every desk is empty, but the papers and photos and office supplies are still lying around. The lights are shut off, and the blinds are drawn. As I walk around the office with its open floor plan and fake potted plants, I decide to take a peek at a few desks. That’s when I see it. A note scribbled on paper in blood, or just red pen, reads, “AHHHHHHHHH.” And on the next desk: “they’re eating her!” And on the final desk: “and then they’re going to eat me!” Oh my god. What happened here? Did some deleterious demon destroy the entire staff of Deadspin? I had to find out. My investigative journalism skills took over.
I traced people’s steps, their shoe prints outlined in blood. My hard-hitting journalistic abilities told me to follow the bloody prints. My hard-hitting journalistic abilities also told me to head down the ghostly hallway with blood splatters on the wall, a lonely light in a room at the end of the hallway, and gnashing jaw sounds coming from the room. I wasn’t scared. My journalism skills made me not scared. Because journalism isn’t human. It’s journalism. Anyway, I crept down the hallway. It smelled metallic. A soft, musical noise was drifting down the hallway. It was Wagner’s “Ride of the Valkyries.” My hand went to the doorknob, slowly pushing it open, and the gnashing sound stopped. There was a low growl.
I peeked around the corner.
Inside, a Babylonian beast with the words “G/O Media Group” written on the side was consuming the non-sports related content off of a rebellious sports news website site. In that instant, website turned into a baby, and the baby’s face morphed into the logo of Deadspin, but it didn’t last. The baby's face returned in a bright flash of light. I stood in silence. A giant bird ripped off the ceiling of the building. It revealed a cloudless sky, and I looked up to see the stars.

With ever-increasing emissions and climate change, removing greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide from the atmosphere is of critical importance. Researchers at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) have developed a means of removing carbon dioxide from a stream of air that functions at nearly any concentration level, making the technology far more versatile than others before.
MIT postdoctoral student Sahag Voskian, who worked under Chemical Engineering Professor Ralph Landau, published the findings in the journal Energy and Environmental Science. His technique involves forcing air through a stack of charged electrochemical plates, and releasing gas as the electrodes charge up. Previous attempts at carbon dioxide removal have required higher concentrations of the gas in the air, but Voskian’s device requires significantly less energy and works under more conditions.
“The greatest advantage of this technology over most other carbon capture or carbon-absorbing technologies is the binary nature of the adsorbent's affinity to carbon dioxide,” explained Voskian in an MIT press release. The electrodes are coated with a carbon nanotube-based compound called polyanthraquinone, so they have a natural affinity for carbon dioxide molecules and react with the gas even at low concentrations. The device can even supply some of the power required for the process of ejecting the carbon dioxide gas, unlike alternative methods that require substantial input energy, often in the form of heat.
Voskian continued, “This binary affinity allows capture of carbon dioxide from any concentration, including 400 parts per million, and allows its release into any carrier stream, including 100 percent CO2.” In other words, carbon dioxide will be emitted from the device regardless of the gas blown through its electrochemical plates. A common use case may be for the carbonation of bottled beverages, currently done by burning fossil fuels to generate the necessary carbon dioxide gas.
“In my laboratories, we have been striving to develop new technologies to tackle a range of environmental issues that avoid the need for thermal energy sources, changes in system pressure, or addition of chemicals to complete the separation and release cycles,” Hatton added. “This carbon dioxide capture technology is a clear demonstration of the power of electrochemical approaches that require only small swings in voltage to drive the separations.”
The electrodes can be manufactured using existing technologies, making the device relatively inexpensive to produce. On a larger scale, the cost can be reduced to around tens of dollars per square meter of the electrodes. More importantly, Voskian’s system consistently uses approximately one gigajoule of energy per ton of carbon dioxide captured. Other methods of carbon dioxide capture can use up to 10 gigajoules per ton and are composed of more expensive components
The researchers are commercializing the device through a new company called Verdox and hope to build a pilot plant within the coming years. Voskian believes it will be easy to scale up from there: “If you want more capacity, you just need to make more electrodes.”

A group of American researchers have discovered an antibody against potentially lethal influenza viruses in mice. The antibody may assist in the development of a universal flu shot capable of either treating or preventing every flu strain. The study was conducted at Scripps Research alongside St. Louis’ Washington University School of Medicine and New York’s Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai and was published in Science on Oct. 25.
Ian Wilson, Hansen Professor of Structural Biology at Scripps Research, is one of three senior co-authors of the study. According to Wilson, the antibody under study binds to neuraminidase, a protein that plays a vital role in inducing the replication of the flu virus in the body. This protein is found on the virus’ surface, and triggers the release of the virus from infected host cells, thereby allowing it to spread throughout the body. The flu medicine Tamiflu, most commonly used to treat dangerously severe flus, accomplishes this through the inactivation of neuraminidase. Even so, there exists a variety of forms of neuraminidase as they can vary depending on the flu strain. As a result, drugs such as Tamiflu are not always very effective. Worse, these drugs decrease in effectiveness even more with each passing year, since the flu virus develops a resistance to these drugs. 
“There are many strains of influenza virus that circulate so every year we have to design and produce a new vaccine to match the most common strains of that year. Now imagine if we could have one vaccine that protected against all influenza strains, including: human, swine and other highly lethal avian influenza viruses. This antibody could be the key to [the] design of a truly universal vaccine,” said co-senior author and assistant professor of immunology and pathology at Washington University, Ali Ellebedy in a Scripps press release. 
Ellebedy was the first to discover the antibody in 2017 at Barnes-Jewish Hospital. It was hidden in blood drawn from a patient who was stricken with the flu. While working on a different study with the Washington University Emergency Care and Research Core investigating the human immune response to flu infection, Ellebedy received a multitude of blood samples from consenting flu victims. One of these blood samples was unusual, as it contained antibodies that acted against the main protein located on the virus’s surface, hemagglutinin, as well as antibodies that targeted something else entirely. 
“At the time we were just starting, and I was setting up my lab so we didn't have the tools to look at what else the antibodies could be targeting,” said Ellebedy. Three of the flu samples were sent to another co-senior author, a microbiology professor at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, Florian Krammer, Ph.D. As an expert on neuraminidase, Krammer tested the antibodies he received from Ellebedy against many neuraminidase proteins. One of these antibodies was capable of blocking neuraminidase activity in every known type of neuraminidase in flu viruses; these proteins were found in both human and nonhuman strains. 
“The breadth of the antibodies really came as a surprise to us. Typically, anti-neuraminidase antibodies can be broad within a subtype, like H1N1, but an antibody with potent activity across subtypes was unheard of. At first, we did not believe our results. Especially the ability of the antibodies to cross between influenza A and influenza B viruses is just mind-boggling. It is amazing what the human immune system is capable of if presented with the right antigens," said Krammer in a Scripps press release. 
Krammer and his colleagues gave the antibodies to mice who were dosed with a lethal quantity of influenza virus in order to determine whether the antibodies were able to treat severe flus. They were all capable of protecting against multiple strains; one in particular, 1G01, was able to cure all of the twelve tested strains. 
“All the mice survived, even if they were given the antibody 72 hours after infection. They definitely got sick and lost weight, but we still saved them. It was remarkable,” Ellebedy added. “It made us think that you might be able to use this antibody in an intensive care scenario when you have someone sick with flu and it's too late to use Tamiflu."
The discovery of this antibody is nothing short of groundbreaking, as it tells scientists that they may have to take an entirely different approach to deal with particularly severe flu cases, as well as flu pandemics. In the near future, severe cases of the flu may be a thing of the past.

I walked into the movie theater, got my ticket scanned, and was directed to the IMAX auditorium. I entered only 10 minutes before the scheduled start of the film and was immediately confused to find complete silence.
As I turned and made my way up the stairs to my seat, I came upon another striking realization: there is no one else in the auditorium. Shocked, I heard my slow footsteps echo across the room as I took my seat. Was I in the right theater? I walked out, checked, walked back in. Yep, this was the right one.
My echoing footsteps lead me back to my seat, and I wondered for a moment if I had made a wrong decision. There were no advertisements, no trailers, no distractions—just the sound of a movie playing in the neighboring auditoriums and the squeaking of my own chair. Suddenly, as the clock struck 5:15 p.m., the sound of a projector swooshed and the empty screen before me turned on.
The lights above me dimmed, and alone in the pitch black darkness, the surround sound audio boomed with the sound of a choir singing the “Hallelujah” part of Kanye’s song “Selah” — intense and quiet, chanting over and over until the screen all at once revealed a bright image, the choir singing at an increasingly higher pitch, the passion in their voices palpable as the camera panned out. In wonder, I leaned forward in my seat and took in the sounds and sights. I had made the right decision.
Throughout Kanye West’s experimental concert short film, Jesus is King, director Nick Knight presents raw and powerful Gospel that captivates the soul in a manner undeniable and inspiring. There were no scripts, no scenes between fictional characters. Only raw, though intentional, footage of Kanye’s Sunday Service Choir singing classic Christian hymns under an open circle of sky light, the clouds visible and the sun shining happily on their faces.
I was enthralled by the beauty of the sound of this gospel choir and their pure, honest praise to Jesus Christ. The short film in itself displayed so many profound, human aspects of the Christian experience shown after the choir had a powerful session of praise and lovingly embraced one another as they wiped each other’s tears — from a deep-seated place of misery and longing, to the joy and lightness that comes with the peace of the Holy Spirit, to the pure awe and worship of Jesus Christ with a heart so grateful the words are sung through tears, to the community and fellowship that comes with the journey. It was a beautiful experience to sit through, one that had me clapping, singing, crying, and smiling.
The film ended after a close up of a young child in her father’s arms, with Kanye singing “Use this Gospel,” a song about the importance of putting faith in the Bible, and in trusting Jesus. The credits rolled as “Jesus is Lord” gave the speakers their final boom, and the screen turned off. The projector swooshed off and the dimmed lights reentered the auditorium as I took in the half hour, unapologetic statement that was this film. I looked around in awe to seek the reaction of others in spite of myself, completely forgetting I was, still, the only one in the theater. I rose from my seat, my echoing footsteps lighter and the glimmering sunlight outside brighter. Beautiful, spiritual, and impactful — Jesus is King uplifted the energy of an empty room that should have been packed.

Welcome to Maddy's Monthly Meme Madness, where we take a look at the Top 5 most-liked memes on the Facebook group, Carnegie Mellon Memes for Spicy Teens, posted in the past month.
1) "Makin' my way downtown" by Jack Kim-Biggs‎ (10/10)
Given how late in the month the viral sinkhole incident occurred, I’m surprised it snuck its way twice in this month’s meme roundup. Nevertheless, I am not unamused, and join hundreds of yinz who welcome our new city icon.
2) "Grad school" by Alisar Mustafa (10/10)
The meme is more seasonal, but it still carries a universal theme that students can relate to year-round. Although I cannot speak for the grad student experience, I can concur that I sometimes (okay, often) feel like the lifeless husk of the college student that I aspire to be.
3) "Piazza praise" by Alon Pe'er (10/10)
The caption on this meme was “When you ‘good question’ your own Piazza question.” I didn’t know that this was a thing until I saw this meme and how it racked up over 500 likes this month. Still, I can understand the appeal and validation from doing so. You do you.
4) "Soul(less) food" by Iris Pei (10/10)
I, like many other people who commented under this meme, have one question: how does this make no sense at all yet make so much sense? Much like this franchise, the mac & cheese at ABP really does lack texture or flavor, but alas it is one of the few hot grab-and-go options for vegetarians at ABP.
5) "Art of the bus" by ‎Kate Borst and Amalia Martinez (10/10)
Once again, we are faced with yet another sinkhole bus meme. Martinez photoshopped the meme and Borst publicized it, making the “’You dream it, We meme it collaboration™” one of the most ambitious crossovers since Infinity War. I suppose anything with an upwards slope can now be connected to Walking to the Sky or the sinkhole bus (does it have a name? At this point, it should).

This past Saturday, I got the chance to expand my musical pool of knowledge. Not only did I get to listen to some indie music, a genre I usually avoid, but I also got to meet some very interesting personalities.
smallpools, a six-year-old indie pop band, kicked off the night with a selection of performances from their album The Science of Letting Go. True to its title, the tracks described the various stages of ending a relationship, including denial, sadness, and eventual acceptance. As a single girl though, I thought some of the songs could be seen as describing letting go of a certain part of your life, like breaking up with a major or an activity that has started to turn toxic.
Towards the end of their segment, smallpools brought a rather quirky story about their name. During their early years, they used to google their name, only to meet results about the hazards of keeping killer whales in small pools. As a tribute, their subsequent performance featured a killer whale balloon being bounced among the audience, much to the delight of the students who eventually got to take home a souvenir.
At around 8:50, gnash was ready to take the stage. His look bore similarity to Justin Bieber’s Mumbai performance: a loose Mickey Mouse graphic t-shirt with shorts. Performing tracks from his latest album we, gnash’s songs seemed to revolve around the theme of mental health. He seemed to truly hit some sensitive spots with the crowd with his songs, especially “insane” (“Tomorrow’s the day I might go insane”), and his special mentions about self-love.
Now by this point, my inner cynic would have inhaled her fifth cup of black coffee and screamed, “Stop acting like my therapist,” and “this is not an after-school special!” I’ll admit that his persona reminded me of the seasonally appropriate candy corn: funky-colored with a lot of sugar. The eccentric clash of neon lights with jewel-toned ones certainly didn’t contrast that image. And while I’ll admit that I found his music to be a little redundant after five songs, I certainly admired his charisma. His willingness to be vulnerable in front of the audience made him much loved by the audience both during and after his show.
All in all, it was a great experience and a night well spent, although I think the music of both bands might take more than just one performance to truly earn a place on my playlists. Personally, I’d say that the repertoire of smallpools fit my usual preference of alternate bands, although I certainly wouldn’t mind a gnash tune from time to time.

It appears that everyone who went through a middle school emo phase in the early 2010s, and repressed it, has since come out of the shadows. Maybe I’m projecting. Maybe I’m just bitter at not being allowed to exclusively wear band merchandise and clothes from Hot Topic. Regardless, A Day to Remember is one of the first bands that encapsulates my coming-of-age.
A band named Can’t Swim was the first of many bands to open for A Day to Remember. I only got to catch the last song of their set, “Stranger.” I had never heard of them prior to the show, but I’m not opposed to listening to more of their songs or keeping my eye out for new releases. The band was enjoyable, but I didn’t find it too special. The screaming to vocals ratio was a bit higher than I would like, but maybe I’m just jaded. Maybe I only cling onto OG bands like A Day to Remember because of their sentimental value. Regardless, I’m happy to add “Stranger” to my “Songs I’ve Heard Live” playlist.
Beartooth came next. Although I had heard much praise for them over the summer, I pushed off listening to them until the concert. Even my concert-going accomplice’s enthusiasm wasn’t enough to sway me. I’m now kicking myself for being stubborn and for not giving them a listen earlier. They struck a nice balance between vocals and screaming and had the audience jamming and moshing.
I Prevail was another band that I heard so much about, but had never listened to. They are on the track to prevail my upcoming “Favorite November Tracks” playlist. Their style was closer to that of Beartooth than of Can’t Swim, which I don’t oppose at all. The energy was high in the first two sets, but it seemed to intensify for this third set.
A Day to Remember truly did live up to their name through their performance. They started off with one of their classic tracks, “The Downfall of Us All.” They kept the audience on their toes with older releases from their albums Homesick and Common Courtesy while also including new tracks. “Rescue Me” is a recent collaboration with Marshmello — which I had initially been unsure about — but the fusion of rock and EDM somehow works. “Degenerates” is the band’s most recent release from their upcoming album You’re Welcome which comes out in just under two weeks. The track is definitely more on the pop-punk side, but I’m eager to see what direction the band takes with their sixth album.
The band finished off the show with an encore of three songs. Before they showed up on stage again, I was left sort of empty. How could the band not perform “If It Means a Lot to You,” perhaps one of the most iconic emo songs? The second that lead singer Jeremy McKinnon swapped his electric guitar for an acoustic guitar and called for the audience to turn on the flashlights on their phones, I knew exactly where the show was heading.
Much like I did when I was in junior high after a rough breakup, I was screaming along to the anthem of my adolescent heartbreak. “All Signs Point to Lauderdale” was next on the encore list. If I had to summarize angsty pop-punk adolescence in a song, this would be it. Even though everyone was exhausted by the encore, the energy didn’t die out. The mosh pits kept forming and I kept finding myself flying around like a ball in a pinball machine. But hey, I’m not complaining: it was A Day to Remember.
If you told the teenage version of me that I would see A Day to Remember, I would’ve called you a liar. Yet, I got to see them from the pit. I even got in my first mosh pit. Maybe next time I’ll be adventurous enough to crowdsurf.

This review contains no spoilers.
Jojo Rabbit is the latest film from Taika Waititi, the writer and director behind Hunt for the Wilderpeople, What We do in the Shadows, and most recently Thor: Ragnarok. The film is essentially an “anti-hate satire”/coming of age story that happens to take place in Germany during the later years of WWII. We follow Jojo Betzler (Roman Griffin Davis), a 10 year old German boy, and his imaginary friend Adolf Hitler (Taika Waititi), as Jojo leads a life totally committed to the Hitler Youth. However, this worldview is challenged when he finds out that his mother (Scarlett Johansson) is hiding a Jewish girl (Thomasin McKenzie) in his home. The film also stars Rebel Wilson, Stephen Merchant, Sam Rockwell, Archie Yates, and Alfie Allen.
Before going into this film, I was initially a bit skeptical if this project was ultimately going to work out. The marketing and promotional materials seemed to focus on portraying this film as a parody. Mostly, I was worried about whether this film would be able to blend its emotional beats with the comedy. I felt that Waititi’s previous film Thor: Ragnarok had too much bathos, where emotional scenes are interrupted by comedic moments that didn’t allow the film to fully immerse the viewers into the story’s sentiments. It certainly didn’t help that this film had to tackle what was possibly the one of the most devastating periods in human history.
Fortunately, Waititi is very aware of this and takes a more sensitive approach to this story than he did in his previous films. The themes of tolerance and anti-hate that the film had to handle are all well-employed within the story without being preachy. Even though the film has its share of satirical elements, it is self-aware and makes sure they don’t overstay their welcome. I’d argue the large portion of the film’s comedy doesn’t even come from Waititi’s performance as an imaginary Adolf Hitler. He is portrayed as an imbecile for comic relief, but the story maintains its focus from portraying all events from the protagonist Jojo’s perspective.
Roman Griffin Davis’s performance of Jojo is absolutely the centerpiece that makes this film work. Just like the film itself, he is funny, charming, and fully captures the heart-wrenching moments whenever the story needs it. His chemistry with both McKenzie and Johansson is also joyful, and their performances are also charming. The entire supporting cast is lovable regardless of which side of the war they support, and the goodwill that these characters build for themselves truly make the darker parts of the film work effectively.
Another important aspect the film got right is its balancing of tones. There is almost no bathos throughout the film, and the humorous and heartfelt tones are fully employed within a scene without one taking over the other. Waititi completely nailed the balance of tones and made a film genuinely full of heart.
The only flaw that I would point out in this film is that the story doesn’t have a ton of buildup during its second act. Having a slower first act to have the audience invest in the characters is great, and it is something I want filmmakers to do more often. However, it became an issue for me by the second act when there was not much story buildup. There were also beats within the third act that I felt were a bit predictable.
However, none of these flaws prevent Jojo Rabbit from being the film it needs to be: a crowdpleaser that utilizes its characters well to do justice to the time period that it is portraying. It is sincere and tackles its anti-hate themes incredibly well. Jojo Rabbit is currently playing in theaters nationwide.

This past week, the touring production of the musical adaptation of Mean Girls made its appearance in Pittsburgh at the Benedum Center. With its catchy numbers, innovative choreography, and creative scenic design, it was a truly remarkable experience.
The backdrop for Mean Girls was an arrangement of large digital screens, with entrances cleverly hidden by projections shown on the screens or movable pieces. Although the projected images could sometimes feel a little minimalist, it drew focus to the actors on stage and conveyed the mood to the audience appropriately, sometimes even providing comic relief, such as during Karen’s (Jonalyn Saxer) song, “Sexy.”
This relatively minimalist design extended to the set pieces and most of the props as well. However, it seemed that the simplicity of the set, which included (but was most certainly not limited to) several tables and school desks on wheels, helped transitions feel a bit more fluid. This fluidity and simplicity really helped the storytelling.
Perhaps the most inventive part of the musical was the use of lunch trays during “Where Do You Belong?” when Damian (Samuel Gerber at the Tuesday performance in the place of Eric Huffman) shows Cady (Wade) around the cafeteria. With the bright red trays contrasting with the cooler colors of the background, tables, and costumes, there was just enough flair to really accentuate the scene. Additionally, the ensemble’s utilization of the lunch trays for percussive purposes was uniquely clever.
“Stop,” the tap number at the top of the second act, was a refreshing change of pace. The number’s choreography clearly differentiated it from others, creating a slight disjointedness that perfectly accompanies the time skip and brief change in narrative perspective — doubtlessly one of the highlights of the show.
The Mean Girls tour sported a strong cast, featuring stellar vocals from Danielle Wade, powerful belting from Mary Kate Morrissey, and splendid riffs from Mariah Rose Faith. Outstanding dance numbers performed by dance captain Ixchel Cuellar, Marcus Shane, Sky Flaherty, and the incredible swings and ensemble members enhanced the vivid animation of the play as a whole.
Mean Girls builds upon the movie’s satirical elements and brings in some of the film’s iconic lines, but changes certain narrative elements to shed light on a variety of contemporary social issues. While these differences are slight in the grand scheme of things, the impact on the overarching message is considerable.
Instead of solely satirizing vicious high school dynamics, the musical also builds on the ideas introduced in Ms. Norbury’s “girl-on-girl crime” speech from the film. These details range from small quips about the double-standards in traditional gender roles and objectification, to entire musical numbers encouraging female self-advocacy — most notably, Janis’s (Morrissey) “I’d Rather Be Me.” These additions result in the transformation of a classic teen comedy into a feminist work of art while retaining the elements of satirical absurdity.
The message of strength despite marginalization echoes through in the finale. The final notes of “I See Stars” not only see a reconciliation between Cady (Wade) and everyone her choices have hurt, but also a resounding message peers to support one another, stepping back to take in the collective beauty and brilliance of good-spirited individualism.
Flashy, bold, and “Fearless,” Mean Girls is a fun show that balances the lightheartedness of satirical comedy with the seriousness of the pressing social issues it addresses — definitely a show worth watching.

The Frame Gallery, on the corner of Margaret Morrison and Forbes Avenue, opened its Kilo of Green showing on Thursday, Oct. 31. The gallery featured artists including Paola Mathus, Miranda Miller, and Jenn Gooch.
The first painting that I stumbled across was Mathus’s “What’s Not Lost in the River, 2018.” By combining different mediums, Mathus was able to flawlessly overlay two very different scenes on one canvas. Mathus brought forth gripping images that distinguished themselves against the other white-textured foreground. This imagery of two foregrounds coexisting in this painting brings forth a reflection of the duality of the sacrifices we make, the ways that our identities intersect, and the journeys that we undertake because of those sacrifices and intersections. 
Miranda Miller’s “Allohmon yellow,” was a three-hour performance where Miller was enclosed in a three-walled room of translucent plastic, and used their body to coat the room in a version of Pittsburgh’s proprietary paint color, Allohmon yellow. After they covered the room, they divided the wall that separated them from the audience. The performer took up space in the room by lying still in a dominant seated position for two hours while the audience viewed them. The picture itself is of a sectioned-off part of the room after the performance had finished, and the artist was seated. The picture includes the tub of paint, a section of the performer’s outstretched legs, and a portion of the room. The room is not just covered in paint, but drenched with it, almost drowning in it. The yellow of Pittsburgh is painted on everything we do here. All the actions we take, good or bad, are covered in Allohmon yellow, drowning in the pigment. Miller describes the piece as a golden triangle, a marking of territory, a reclamation.
Coco Allred’s “Magnificent Retro Lounger, 2017” was situated openly in the center of the room. The uneven texture was reminiscent of a piece of furniture, long overused and tired, that would surely crumble if any person tried to use it. The shade of the couch was a sickly green, mirroring its decaying state. It’s clear that at one point this couch could have been beautiful, a staple in the home of a proud owner, but now as it decays, it has become wretched and tired. Perhaps, it is simply well-loved and well-used, a metaphor for the things that we appreciate and cherish. Everything that is material, everything that we can feel will decay at some point. We can dread that moment, we can try and hide from it, but our possessions will expire, turn lumpy, uneven, and maybe even a sickly green color. What was once an integral part of our home is now tucked away in a corner, in the attic, or maybe in storage, but to see this lounger stunningly placed in the middle of the room, unabashedly and unashamedly, reminds us that we should not be afraid of our things as they decay. Decay deserves to be the centerpiece. Decay is beautiful.

Make Possible, Carnegie Mellon’s nine-year, $2 billion fundraising project has just entered its public phase. The announcement came with a new website, and a video that featured faculty, staff, students, and trustees showcasing some of the projects and performances under development at the university.
The campaign, which began in the fiscal year 2016, has already raised over half of its goal from more than 42,000 supporters.
The Make Possible Campaign is structured around 4 pillars: “accelerating technological advancements to benefit humanity; fueling artistic expression and creative inquiry to shape modern culture; achieving breakthroughs in discovery by transforming how scientific inquiry is pursued; and fostering a dynamic experience that enables CMU students to thrive,” according to the press release.
The campaign will direct resources to each of the schools and colleges at Carnegie Mellon, which will help the university “tackle the challenges whose solutions lie at the nexus of technology and humanity,”  said university president Farnham Jahanian in a letter about the campaign and in the accompanying video.
In an interview with The Tartan, Scott Mory, vice president for University Advancement, echoed this sentiment, stressing the “emphasis again on being at the nexus of technology and humanity, and how that really can encompass all parts of the university,” from the Tepper School of Business to the College of Fine Arts.
When asked about specific improvements students would see from this massive influx of capital, Mory said that students are “going to see some real improvements in the quality of life on campus,” with the campaign seeking to “improve facilities for health, wellness, and athletics.”
From a “$50 million dollar gift for undergraduate scholarships,” to “the launch of the Tartan scholars program,” to the installation of “a chair for the director of civic engagement to provide new resources for SLICE [Student Leadership, Involvement, and Civic Engagement],” the campaign “will have a lot of direct impacts on student life, and of course, as an alum of the university, the increased reputation of the university, as it’s able to use these resources to advance its mission…will have a long term benefit for every alum of Carnegie Mellon,” Mory said.
The Make Possible campaign, in addition to endowing dean’s chairs and providing funds for undergraduate research, includes capital projects like the Tepper Quad and the Hazelwood-based Mill 19, a joint project between Carnegie Mellon’s Manufacturing Futures Initiative and the nonprofit Advanced Robotics for Manufacturing. According to an article from 90.5 WESA, Mill 19, a former steel mill, will be “a high-tech resource for manufacturers in the region,” testing new ways to automate manufacturing tasks.
Another project under the Make Possible umbrella is the Block Center for Technology and Society, which seeks to “[ensure] that the benefits of technological change are widely shared, opening new paths to prosperity for all,” by investigating the ways technologies like AI and automation can be used without concentrating the benefits in the hands of a few people, or negatively impacting those whose jobs are displaced due to automation.
The Make Possible Campaign’s section on Technology and Humanity says Carnegie Mellon is “changing the way we live, work and connect to one another for good.” As Jahanian puts it, “this is our moment. If we are very intentional, if we are unapologetically bold, and if we commit to taking risks, Carnegie Mellon will take the lead in writing the story of this century... I’m excited to see what we’ll make possible, together.”

On Thursday, a car in the parking garage of the Robert Mehrabian Collaborative Innovation Center (CIC) caught fire. The fire filled the first floor of the CIC with smoke, but no one was injured in the incident, according to Jason Maderer, the senior director of Carnegie Mellon media relations.
Students and staff were evacuated from the CIC at approximately 2:40 p.m. It was pouring rain outside and most people gathered under a covered space near the main entrance of the building.
“It smelled like plastic burning when we walked out,” said Tricia Flinn, a Senior Technical Writer & Content Strategist in SEI, who regretted leaving her laptop inside. “It’s just that I’m on a deadline. But all the people are out and that’s what matters.”
Many people weren’t sure why they had been evacuated, but remained calm through the ordeal. Carnegie Mellon security officer Justin Iaquinta was informed of a fire in the garage but did not know any other details. Many exiting the building waited inside Newell-Simon Hall while waiting for the CIC to be cleared.
Thomas Ogden, Carnegie Mellon Police Chief, said that the main safety concern on the situation was the smoke produced by the downstairs fire. “The whole building is filled with smoke,” he said, as safety officials evacuated the building.
The Pittsburgh Fire Department and Carnegie Mellon police responded to the incident, according to Maderer, as did Carnegie Mellon’s Environmental Health & Safety, Facilities Management and Enterprise Risk Management.
The fire was extinguished by 3:15 p.m. Fans were used to clear out the smoke and people were able to re-enter the CIC at about 4:00 p.m. “12 straight sunny days and this happens today,” Ogden said, referring to how people had to wait outside in the rain.
Carnegie Mellon’s Enviromental Health and Saftey department’s guidelines suggest that in the event of a fire, those involved should evacuate calmly, listen for instructions, crawl below the smoke, test doors for heat carefully, avoid using elevators, and avoid re-entering the building until directed.

North Carolina-based Fortune 100 conglomerate Honeywell is constructing a new robotics facility in the Strip District, building upon existing relationships in Pittsburgh.
Honeywell operates four business units: Honeywell Aerospace, Home and Building Technologies (HBT), Safety and Productivity Solutions (SPS), and Honeywell Performance Materials and Technologies. 
The new facility will house Honeywell Robotics, a division focusing on applying artificial intelligence and advanced robotics for use in warehouse automation and e-commerce distribution.
The company joins the likes of Argo AI, Uber, Apple, Bombardier, and Facebook in what is now called Robotics Row, a dense collection of tech companies who’ve found a home in Pittsburgh’s former wholesale district. Honeywell will take over a 25,000 square foot space previously occupied by Robert Bosch in the Strip’s 3 Crossings business development.
In a company press release, Pieter Krynauw, president of Honeywell Intelligrated, said that “Honeywell has been at the forefront of warehouse automation technology for more than 25 years helping customers improve productivity and efficiency.”
They hope the automation solutions provided by this new branch will address what they see as a labor shortage in the growing e-commerce market.
Joseph Lui, a former IoT and Robotics head at Amazon, is set to be the General Manager of Honeywell Robotics. In an email statement to The Tartan, he says that the corporation chose the Strip District for this facility due to its proximity to Carnegie Mellon University and the density of robotics professionals in the region.
“Our decision to set up Honeywell Robotics was to stay close to advanced robotics and software development talent,” he said, citing Honeywell’s collaboration with researchers at Carnegie Mellon University’s National Robotics Engineering Center (NREC). The company first partnered with the NREC in 2017 to develop robotics technologies for distribution centers.
Lui says Honeywell has created a “strong bond” with researchers at the NREC, and wanted “to stay close to one of the largest robotics communities in the world.”
“The relationships we’ve built with the NREC and Honeywell’s history in Pittsburgh — our voice technology business, which makes voice-guided systems for warehouse and distribution centers, is in the area — makes the city, and where we’re specifically located in Robotics Row, a great place to be,” Lui said, referring to Honeywell’s Vocollect product development in the company’s Penn Hills facility.
Lui can’t say for certain if any of the staff of the new facility will come from Carnegie Mellon, but notes that “we hope they will.” Honeywell is “actively recruiting” staff for the robotics center, Lui says, seeking artificial intelligence and robotics experts, software engineers, program managers, computer vision scientists, and several types of engineers.
Honeywell wants “to bring together some of the brightest minds, partnerships and investments to create breakthrough technological advancements for customers of all sizes, and ultimately deliver values to end-consumers,” said Lui.

It's no secret that college can be a challenging environment, and Carnegie Mellon is no exception. Last week, on Tartan Community Day, Dietrich professor David Creswell presented the results of the Life@CMU study, a project that began in 2017 to attempt to quantify aspects of students' wellbeing. Although our campus has been engaging in an ongoing conversation on mental health, this study made the topic feel less abstract and more approachable.
The results of the research suggest that Carnegie Mellon isn’t particularly more stressful than other colleges. That leads to the million-dollar question: why do Carnegie Mellon students dub the school a soul-sucking institution or give it catchphrases like “fun dies at Carnegie Mellon”?
The phrase “stress culture” oversimplifies the scope of the problem our campus faces. It is easy to assume stress culture simply refers to students’ stress levels. If this were the case, the research that suggests Carnegie Mellon isn’t abnormally stressful compared to other college campuses would dispel the claim of a distinct stress culture. However, the concept of stress culture extends further than the pressure to excel in the classroom or earn a prestigious summer internship.
Our culture equates more work to better work. Life@CMU found that the average student goes to bed at 2:23 a.m. and wakes up at 9:30 a.m., making the average amount of sleep close to 7 hours per night. However, the study also found that students estimated that their classmates slept an average of 5.6 hours. This flawed perception can push students to get fewer hours to match up with their concept of the “average student.” If they sleep more than their classmates, what does that say about their own productivity and progress? Logically, it doesn’t say anything in and of itself. Harder work doesn’t mean better work, and sleep deprivation has been shown to have a serious impact on students’ performance. Still, students internalizing and glorifying an unhealthy lifestyle can cause hits to their mental health.
Isolation is another detriment to students' mental health. The Life@CMU findings suggested loneliness increases as the semester progresses, making students more susceptible to stress and depression. On top of the pressures of being a college student, students may feel pressured to maintain an image that hides struggles or perceived "weakness." This pressure can further exacerbate isolation and thus cause further mental health problems.
This leads to one of the larger gaps on our college campus: the lack of dialogue. Even if students are cognizant that Carnegie Mellon is not an easy place to be, going from being a big fish in a small pond to swimming in a large ocean is a daunting experience for anyone. Events like Fresh Check Day are appreciated, but we need more consistent initiatives throughout the year to provide support for students and to continuously show that they are not alone in their struggles. It's difficult to handle the responsibilities of a college student. Combining that with mental illnesses, difficult in their own right, creates a weight that is impossible to carry alone. By not having dialogue, students may feel alone in their experiences and consequently isolate themselves.
This is not a task that students can tackle on their own. Despite the 2017 expansion of Counseling and Psychological Services (CaPS), students are often faced with long wait times between appointments, assuming they can even schedule an appointment at all. Students have also expressed dissatisfaction with the services offered at CaPS. This demonstrates a need for more comprehensive mental health resources for students. Students need a space where they can get adequate care, including individual therapy sessions and group therapy programs, without having to jump through hoops or wait for weeks.
To paraphrase Andrew Carnegie, our "hearts are in the work." However, there comes a point in which we need to fill our hearts with more than just "the work." We need to make time to adopt healthy lifestyles and maintain strong relationships with others. It’s not a task that one student or one project can accomplish alone; it's a collaborative effort that requires continuous efforts and initiative from students, administration, and faculty. These forms of self-care and more candid conversations don't promote self-indulgence; they promote responsibility.

At the end of every week, I find myself sitting on my bed with my laptop open and music playing. Across from me are my suitemates, giggling and catching up after a long week of classes, tests, and activities. As the clock nears 1 a.m., our laughs fade and the music grows somber as the conversation shifts to the topic it always ends up being: existing at Carnegie Mellon University as underrepresented minorities. Whether we’re talking about stares, treatment, or undisguised disrespect, we often think of the looming question that many students like ourselves face at Carnegie Mellon: Do we belong here?
I grapple with this question almost every day, even knowing that I am part of the upper-middle class. Nonetheless, the post-Celebration of Diversity fantasy of an all-inclusive Carnegie Mellon community has faded. It's not just me who feels this way. Time and time again, I have seen the blatant disrespect and struggles that underrepresented minorities face on campus. With so few Native American students at Carnegie Mellon — only six in the class of 2023 — I cannot even begin to fathom what “belonging” means to them. To scope out whether or not underrepresented minorities feel they belong, I opened up a form for students to express their sentiments. 
“Yes and no,” John, a first-year in CFA replied. “I know that I deserve to be here because I worked as hard as everyone else and [I] have something of value to offer. However, the institution itself is not designed to accommodate underrepresented students and instead decides to cater to the majority — in CMU’s case, white and East Asian students.”
“Not really,” responds Monica, a sophomore in Dietrich College of Humanities and Social Sciences.“I just feel a little isolated at times, and when I walk around certain buildings — Gates, for example — I feel like people know that I, as a Black person, don’t belong there.” 
“Yes,” Ralph, a CIT sophomore says. “I worked just as hard to get here as anyone else.”
“The simplest answer is no,” Jessie, a sophomore in MCS, states. “Not only am I one of the few women in my major, but I am the only black woman.” 
“I feel like I belong within the Black community,” says Lisa, a junior in CIT. “But in Carnegie Mellon as a whole, probably not.”
The most rampant form of disrespect faced by underrepresented minorities at Carnegie Mellon is microaggressions, comments or actions that unconsciously or unintentionally express prejudices toward minorities. Most responses to the form, which asked about students’ relationship with race since being at Carnegie Mellon, discussed the insidious nature of microaggressions. 
“I know people who just think of it as being normal because the number of microaggressions [is] too tiring to pay any mind to,” John states. “From racial assumptions based [on] where someone is from, to faculty focusing solely on Eurocentric curricula, there isn’t a sense of urgency or priority towards minority stories or history.”
“I get called the wrong name all the time,” Monica shares. “Whenever I am in a space with more than one Black woman, I am always mistaken for the other one. It’s a bit aggravating.”
“A lot of people seem afraid to converse with me, even my neighbor right down the hall who I see every day,” says Olivia, a first-year student in Tepper. “It just seems kind of weird sometimes. It’s like they’ve never seen someone who looks like me before.”
Other times the microaggressions are more blatant.
As Ralph puts it, “It's always small comments from others when people say ‘I can't relate’ because I'm Mexican, or when they comment that I'm one of the few Mexicans on campus. They’re comfortable crossing these verbal boundaries and saying these insensitive things, often without realizing how it makes me feel.”
“I'm undermined so often, even when asking for help,” shares Lisa. “And this is something that happened when I was trying to get help from a TA.”
“My race and ethnicity have been tied to my socioeconomic status from friends of mine,” shares Zachary, a sophomore in CIT. “And it feels like they have set lower bars for me simply for being a minority.”
“Many of my authority figures are racist,” Jessie states. “I’ve had teaching assistants take one look at my skin and ask me which part of Africa I am from. When I complain, they say they are just trying to get to know me and my heritage better. But is it not racist to ask every black person you encounter which part of Africa they are from?”
Microaggressions, as subtle as they can be, are mentally taxing for underrepresented minorities. Underrepresented minorities must exist within a space where they often question whether they even belong while dealing with the stress of Carnegie Mellon academics. On top of that, mental health is often disregarded and seen as shameful in many of our cultures, making effects much worse. I cannot even begin to describe the psychological toll microaggressions have on students right here, right now, but Zachary hits the nail on the head.
“I have gone through feelings of rejection and tried fighting to have my identity noticed here,” he shares. “But ultimately, I have grown numb to the alienating forces of this school’s student body. This is something that, sadly, I feel a lot of my peers have felt also.”
Our students should not be feeling numb and helpless due to parts of their identity they cannot change; however, it is not surprising. Why is there such a lack of outrage from not only the administration, but the faculty and the rest of the student body? What can Carnegie Mellon do from here on?
First, the institution must realize that diversity, equity, and inclusion efforts are urgent. While I believe the institution has the best intentions in efforts to “do better”, and our university is improving in comparison to accounts from 2015, effective and direct diversity efforts can only come with a realized sense of priority. This does not equate to simply saying that you will listen, or that you care: Urgency demands immediate, thoughtful action.
Another issue Carnegie Mellon deals within its diversity, equity, and inclusion efforts is the lack of visibility. To clarify, I understand there are ongoing task forces, committees, and safe spaces to improve the state of diversity and inclusion here at Carnegie Mellon. I do not discredit the work of undergraduate and graduate students, faculty, staff, and professors who are working toward the creation of programs, scholarships, and resources. However, I know of these efforts because I happen to be part of them. What about students who are not? Or students who are applying to Carnegie Mellon? Students from marginalized groups should not be lost when they feel uncomfortable or alone.
The urgency and visibility of current efforts ultimately warrant transparency. Effective diversity, equity, and inclusion efforts require complete honesty with how things are now. Why are we, in a way, lying to students? Whether it is to prospective or current students, why are we patting ourselves on the back for a job well done, when we also know the job is far from being done? Several of the students interviewed shared feelings of being disillusioned during the Celebration of Diversity weekends that are offered a few times a year.
“Like many college advertisements, the weekend was a distortion of the true diversity of the campus and the associated resources it offers,” states Kyle, a senior in Dietrich College.
“Celebration of Diversity made me feel like I finally had a space to learn and grow without having to worry about the color of my skin every minute,” Jessie reflects. “But my first few weeks of college confused me. This wasn’t the representation that was presented at the diversity weekend.”
“The best part of it was connecting with other students applying,” shares David, a sophomore in Dietrich College. “It’s unfortunate, though, because I don’t even remember the programs or panels.”
When discussing transparency in Carnegie Mellon’s diversity, equity, and inclusion efforts, David and I reflect on the Building Our Network of Diversity Luncheon that we both attended in September. Being transparent would facilitate diversity efforts and invoke real change, allowing students to trust the administration.
However, as we observed at this luncheon, the institution refuses to acknowledge faults. Following an excessive twenty-minute faculty introduction, the Office of Admissions presented data showing the increase of “low-yielding underrepresented students” and women from 2015 to now. The Office of Administration did not present numbers on a school-to-school basis, avoiding acknowledging that many of our undergraduate schools have serious racial and class diversity issues.
“I understand not wanting to show numbers that go against you,” David reflects. “But pretending does so much more damage.”
The Admissions Office and faculty also invoked The Tyranny of the Meritocracy by Lani Guinier. The book, which discusses the broken education system that exists in the United States, was a microscopic band-aid of an excuse — because of the “way things are,” there is only so much that Carnegie Mellon can do. If the institution can quietly raise over $1 billion for multiple high-tech, modern buildings, and thirty endowed faculty chairs, they can spare a dollar for effective recruitment methods. 
“Carnegie Mellon wants to hold us, the students, to certain standards,” David says of the matter. “But the institution should also be held to the same standard.”
Why has there not been urgency, visibility, and transparency in diversity and inclusion efforts in the first place? If my time here has taught me anything, it is this: Carnegie Mellon University fosters a culture of political apathy which in effect, makes urgency, visibility, and transparency in current efforts less important to the administration. Why take direct action when it is easier to pretend?
Political apathy is the lack of interest in the state of politics. I understand to a certain extent the implications, especially for international students, of taking a public political stance, and I certainly do not blame them as individuals. I am more disconcerted with Carnegie Mellon’s pledge for diversity and inclusion efforts as the institution itself treads lightly in politics and taking action. Simply put, diversity and inclusion are inherently political projects. 
For example, Carnegie Mellon cannot pledge support for Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) students, while partnering with Palantir Technologies, a top software company that has given important technologies to Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE). Carnegie Mellon cannot grant themselves the badge of “doing better” while our professors benefit from telescopes placed on sacred land and encourage the construction of the Thirty Meter Telescope. Carnegie Mellon cannot simply hire more faculty members of color while current faculty lack the training necessary to interact and positively connect with students from marginalized groups. The institution cannot promise to listen to the student body’s concerns and then do little productive action beyond listening. They are putting on an act, and I am not buying it.
At this point, I am desperate. I am begging. By refusing to acknowledge the intersection between diversity efforts and politics in the American context, the administration is complicit in the suffering of underrepresented minorities at Carnegie Mellon. With a complicit administration comes a complicit student body, and that is unacceptable. We have suffered and continue to suffer in silence.

Through different eras of human civilization, gold has been considered a precious commodity, a word synonymous with wealth and used to symbolize status and power. Thousands of years later, nothing has changed, and people continue to seek out gold along with other precious resources like silver and oil.
It’s often the case that physical assets become imbued with incredible value, and where there’s value, there’s trade. Although we no longer trade gold the old-fashioned way by directly exchanging gold bars or bullion, most people obtain gold in the context of buying jewelry or commemorative items. Investing in physical jewelry is a common way to become involved, but the process of doing so is self-explanatory. Instead, we’ll focus on trading gold and other important assets like oil and silver on the stock market.
Buying things like gold, oil, and silver is considered trading in commodities, a very popular option when the market is taking a downturn. The reason is simple: precious resources are wanted the world over, and as a result, they maintain their value more consistently over time. So even if the market is dropping, your assets will not suffer significantly.
Precious resources tend to fluctuate in the short term since their valuation is likely to change. The price of oil, for instance, jumps up and down, as does the price of gold. If you’re thinking about getting rich off dramatic jumps in the market, commodities usually don’t spike nearly enough to make a meaningful difference, but if you’re looking for a slow, low-risk investment that’s capable of guarding against ailing markets, then you might want to consider commodities as a serious option.
There are many ways of trading commodities on the market, and with modern online systems for trading, buying into commodities is just as easy as buying stocks or funds. One of the easiest ways to become invested in commodities is to buy into commodity-related ETFs, or Exchange Traded Funds. As we’ve discussed before, ETFs are baskets of different securities chopped up into tiny, low-price pieces that are then made available to consumers. ETFs that track commodities contain assets and perhaps physical ownerships relating to one specific precious resource, and shares of the ETFs are made available on the market. You might see a little more volatility in ETFs as compared to their underlying commodity, but ETFs tend to track their targets.
Another option is to buy the stocks of the companies. This is a more indirect way of investing in the resources, but it makes sense since if the commodity is doing well, then the company making the resources is probably doing well too. Of course, company valuations depend on more than the commodity itself, and it’s entirely possible that a company fails out of a profitable industry.
There are other options such as buying certificates or timed investments that operate based on future returns, but these are slightly more complicated than obtaining the usual investments on the market. And while investing in commodities is considered less risky than purchasing stocks, there is still the risk of losing money on an investment.
Next time, we will talk about the all-important topic of how to best invest in stocks and what indicators to look at while choosing your investments.

Whenever I write for this section, I tend to take what I talk about seriously. I can’t take the elections seriously, so by extension this article isn’t serious. Now that I have broken the fourth wall, let’s talk about the elections. 
Recently Beto dropped out of the race, which was a revelation for anyone who wanted it to be. I personally hope it’s so he can focus on his dead punk rock career. Beto dropping out likely wasn’t his idea. I can imagine a Democrat fixer showing up at Beto’s house one day and blackmailing him. Either way, I don’t know why Beto didn’t run for the Senate in 2020 against the guy that isn’t Ted Cruz (John Cornyn) in the first place. The Democrats should have sent a fixer the minute Beto announced he was running for the presidency. Beto should have realized that almost winning Texas doesn’t mean you can win the country. 
But it shouldn’t be surprising that Beto dropped out. In fact, there are so many people who should drop out next (I won’t name names) but still want to lead the country. Here’s my question. 
Why? 
If you’re not polling in the double digits, and you have a better shot at positions better suited for you, why do you keep trying? Being the president looks awful. Obama lost thirty years of his lifespan in the span of eight years. I even feel bad for Trump, too. He hasn’t had time to golf more than three times a week. More importantly, if Democrats want to win the election, why are they giving people more than 5 options, let alone 20? Americans aren’t good at choosing things. We can barely choose which sob story to vote for on America’s Got Talent.
The infighting also doesn’t help the Democrats. It’s a sad day when two war hawks in the party are fighting each other on Twitter about who is a better war hawk. I, of course, refer to everyone’s favorite Clinton and every Indian’s favorite politician, Tulsi Gabbard. The debates don’t help either. They’re all shams, but I’m glad NBC, CNN, and whoever else hosted it made a good amount of money. All I’ve learned in the whole ordeal is that there are more people who think public-private partnerships are a good idea than there should be.
I don’t know if the Democrats have the chance of winning next year on their own merits. Either Trump is going to continue putting his foot in his mouth to the point that he alienates everyone who isn’t a hardcore supporter, or he wins again because of the sheer incompetence of the Democrats. No one should be shocked that the Democrats are aloof. After all, that’s what happens when the one percent who get corporate money try to relate to the lowly citizens, barring a few. 
There’s nothing else to say that is useful. Everything’s a mess, and the world is near the end. Just go vote. They give out free stickers that make you feel important. Isn’t that all we need to feel at this point?
