Despite a loss in a close game this past Tuesday against the Juniata College Eagles, Carnegie Mellon’s men’s basketball team showed signs that suggested future success in the 2011–12 season. Sophomore Asad Meghani showed that his off-season work has paid off, scoring a career high of 18 points and dishing out five assists. However, the most notable statistic was his 6/10 mark from behind the arc.
This tightly battled game was one of runs. The Eagles poured in 13 straight early in the first quarter. With an 11–3 run later in the half, the Tartans countered the Eagles’ run, taking a 24–23 lead. The theme of the runs was not lost as the Eagles bounced back with a 9–2 run to close the half, bringing the score to 36–29.
Meghani found his stroke in the second half with the Tartans down 45–35. His back-to-back threes helped get the Tartans back in the game.
“Asad Meghani is a great shooter, and he was on fire on Tuesday night. He played and shot extremely well,” said senior point guard Max Gordon.
This loss was tough, but after a big comeback by the Tartans late in the second half, hopes are high for this season. After trailing by as much as 65–48, Meghani and sophomore Christian Manoli’s plays plowed away at the Eagle’s lead to pull within one point. But the Eagles’ perfect free-throw shooting down the stretch sealed their 75–69 win.
Meghani’s 18 points were supplemented by Manoli’s 13, and senior John Duhring added eight points and nine rebounds.
This loss against the Eagles of Juniata College ends the Tartans’ four-game win streak. The 49.1 percent shooting from the field by the Eagles did the Tartans in, who only shot 44.4 percent. The Eagles’ hot shooting extended to behind the arc, pouring in 46.7 percent of their threes, 10 percent better than the Tartans.
“In terms of the whole game, we struggled to put things together both offensively and defensively. We had our stretches of playing well on both sides of the ball, but we couldn’t keep it consistent throughout the game,” Gordon said.
The Tartans’ fortunes were better this past Saturday in their game against Penn State Behrend Lions. In contrast to their loss to Juniata College, the Tartans were on fire, outshooting the Lions 51 percent to 40.8 percent.
“I think our high [field goal] percentage was because we shot fewer three-pointers and, rather, got into the lane and worked for easier shots,” Duhring said.
Four players scored in double figures, with six players scoring eight or more points. Senior guard John Duhring led the ballclub with 17 points, followed by sophomore guard Rashaun Riley, sophomore forward Sean Brophy, and first-year center Matt Loebbaka with 13, 12, and 10 points respectively.
The Tartans played the majority of the game trailing the Lions, but staying true to form, they were able to fight and take a late lead over Penn State Behrend and secure a win with clutch free-throw shooting by Brophy.
Carnegie Mellon (1–1) plays again on Tuesday against Allegheny College at Skibo Gymnasium at 7 p.m.

The Tartans swimming and diving team hosted the annual Carnegie Mellon quad meet last Friday and Saturday. The competing teams included Allegheny College, the University of Rochester, and Washington and Lee University.
The men’s team swept the quad meet with a close victory (132.5–129.5) over Washington and Lee, and with greater margins (185–77 and 178–84) over Rochester and Allegheny College, respectively.
As first-years, Andrew Yee and David Campbell are already breaking their career bests. Yee shaved five seconds off his best time in the 1,000-yard freestyle. Later in the meet, Yee placed first in the 500-yard freestyle. Another strong performance came in the 200-yard breaststroke from first-years Cole Um and Daniel Mock, who took second and third in the race, respectively.
Junior Dan Glaser-Garbrick finished strong; a top swimmer for the Tartans last year, Glaser-Garbrick brought in a first-place finish last weekend in the 200-yard individual medley with a season best of 1:58.25.
The women’s team also performed well at the quad meet. The women topped Washington and Lee 163–94, Rochester 149–108, and Allegheny College 168–84.
The first-years helped strengthen the women’s team. The addition of first-year Debbie Lin to the team of sophomore Tatiana Duchak, sophomore Megan Garvey, and junior Breanna Stillo helped the Tartans win the 200-yard medley relay with a time of 1:51.02.
“Everyone was hyped up, and we swam very well as a team,” said senior Jen Sung. “The whole team contributed to our three wins for both men and women. With our quad meet under our belt, we’re very excited about Nike Cup, which is in two weeks.”
Returning swimmers, such as sophomore Soleil Phan and junior Price Kinney, helped the Tartans to victory with first-place finishes. Phan placed first in the 100-yard and 200-yard freestyle, while Kinney placed first in the 200-yard breaststroke.
On the boards, it was the seniors on the diving team who brought in the wins. Senior Olivia DeFazio won the three-meter board with 371.60 points and placed second on the one-meter board with 257.80 points. On the men’s side, senior Eli Fatsi took both events with 453.55 points on the three-meter board and 444.65 points on the one-meter board. Another diver, senior Mike Alexovich, took second place on the three-meter board with 415.50 points.
“The team looked confident and very prepared coming into the meet, and they definitely delivered results by winning a lot of important races and then ultimately the meet,” said sophomore business administration major Kathleen Dolan, who was a spectator at the event. “It was also great to see a lot of impressive swims from the underclassmen because it looks like the team is continuing to improve each year.”
The Carnegie Mellon swim team will compete again on Dec. 1, when the swimmers travel to Kenyon College for the Total Performance Invitational. The diving team will compete Jan. 21 at Westminster College.

This week, we met up with sophomore electrical and computer engineering major and varsity tennis player Sonya Subramaniam. Subramaniam had a stand-out fall tennis season.
Subramaniam came into the fall 2011 season after a summer full of hard work. She did not drop a doubles pro set all season, including her win in the Blue Draw singles at the Intercollegiate Tennis Association Regionals. In the regionals’ singles play, however, Subramaniam made it to the finals before falling to a player from Johns Hopkins.
Subramaniam loves being a part of the women’s tennis team — one of her favorite aspects is the camaraderie. “I love traveling. You get to spend a lot of time with everyone and get to know them really well,” she said. “Also, when it gets close in a match and our team cheers, it gets super intense.”
Her teammates also think highly of her. “She is a talented, dedicated, hardworking asset to the team,” said third-year architecture major Christina Brant.
“Our team does a lot of funny stuff,” Subramaniam said. “One of my favorites was training our coach to say my last name. It is during introductions when he introduces all of the players and the spots we would be playing. We consistently told coach to just sound the name out and to just roll with it. When he finally introduced me, he said, ‘Freshman Sonya Subram...I can’t.’ Now the team and coach just call me Submarine or Brown Bear.”
Subramaniam has high hopes for the team in the spring. “We have a lot of good freshmen and a sophomore transfer student. Everyone worked hard in the fall, and we had solid performances all around,” she said. “If we keep up the hard work, we can hope to win indoor nationals when we return in the spring and eventually kick some butt at NCAAs.”
After completeing her degree and finishing the tennis season, Subramaniam has some ideas in mind about her future. “I would like to move to California and work for Apple,” she said.
Editor's note: Alex Tapak is a member of the women's varsity tennis team.

They dubbed themselves the “Dream Team” in the preseason. They brought in the top free agents, traded for a Pro Bowl cornerback, and returned the most explosive quarterback in NFL history.
This was the Philadelphia Eagles before the season started, and they were expected to challenge the Packers for NFC supremacy. However, the Eagles currently sit at 3–6, last in the NFC East, needing a miracle to even make the playoffs. Not to mention that neither their star player — quarterback Michael Vick — nor their best wide receiver to date — Jeremy Maclin — will be playing this weekend. As of right now, the Eagles look nothing like a team that could compete with the Packers, let alone compete with half the league. So, what has gone wrong for a team that is so talented?
First off, the main problem is Vick’s health. Vick, who is known as much for his running abilities as his passing abilities, electrified the league last year with long runs and a newfound ability to make accurate, deep passes. His elusiveness is well noted and he is almost never out of a play, even with a 300-pound lineman bearing down on him for a sack. However, the problem with his style of play is that he gets hit far too often, as evidenced by his history of injuries, especially this year. In the past nine games, Vick has suffered from two cases of bruised ribs, a fractured right hand, and a concussion. That’s four injuries in nine games. Obviously, that is not a very good ratio. Although Vick has played most of the games this year, he is clearly not as effective as he was last year. He already has 11 interceptions and two fumbles, which puts him at more turnovers this year, plus his passer rating has gone from over 100 to a mere 79.3. Although Vick is a reason for the Eagles’ terrible season this year, he’s not the only culprit.
A common NFL cliché states that “it all starts up front.” Basically, one of the keys to having a good offense is to have a strong offensive line, and to stop the run on the defensive side. The Eagles have neither a good offensive line nor do they stop the run very well.
The offensive line has had Vick running around in the pocket since the first week, even with the hiring of a new offensive line coach, who was supposed to instill confidence. In fact, Vick has complained that he hits the ground too much in the pocket, a snide comment at his offensive line. Without good protection, there is no way that the Eagles can even get the ball, making them high-priced bystanders. On the other side of the ball, the Eagles can rush the passer, but they can’t stop the run. This year, they have been gashed by the likes of running backs Matt Forte and Fred Jackson, and whenever they give up a 100-yard rusher, they are bound to lose. Although they are ranked 17th overall in rush defense, it is a known problem for the Eagles, and teams will always go for the run game first when facing them.
Lastly, the Eagles are not utilizing their players correctly. Their free agent cornerback, Nnamdi Asomugha, is known to be one of the best man-to-man cornerbacks in the league. However, the Eagles seem to not acknowledge this, as they consistently play zone coverages, which does not utilize Asomugha’s skills. He has repeatedly had trouble making tackles and covering his own zone, and was the culprit on a 60-yard pass to the New York Giants’ Victor Cruz earlier this season. With a team that is known to have great cover corners, one would think that the Eagles could alter their defense to play to the skills of their players. 
However, they continuously throw out the same defense, and they have given up more than 20 points in all but two games.
Looking at the Eagles, they should be one of the best teams in the league on paper. However, they fail week after week with bad execution, mental toughness, and coaching. I would not be surprised if Eagles Coach Andy Reid hears some firing rumors after the season, considering this was supposed to be a Super Bowl or bust year. They also have to deal with the potential contract scuffle with wide-receiver DeSean Jackson, so it will not be a fun off-season for the “Dream Team.”

I’ve written about the lockout — the disputes, the finances, the repercussions. I wanted to drop it and write about something that doesn’t remind me of the enduring heartbreak and frustration. However, the NBA/fan relationship has hit its most rocky point, threatening to be permanently tarnished.
That’s right, I said “permanently.”
The term being widely used in the media is “nuclear winter.” The National Basketball Players Association (NBPA) rejected the owners’ most recent offer and is taking the owners to court to settle this dispute with arbitration. If not a bargaining tactic, this pretty much closes the books on an NBA season.
Fans have a good memory. We will not gloss over this whole fiasco when this lockout is ended. We won’t get swept away in the excitement of the NBA games and forget the misery we’ve suffered. The game is slowly losing what keeps it thriving.
In the meantime, what have we been doing? I find myself watching hockey, paying a lot more attention to college football than usual, and growing exponentially more fed up with the NBA. Fans are cheating on the NBA; we are finding entertainment elsewhere. And it is not safe to assume the fans will come crawling back. I probably will, but as I said, permanent damage has been done, and it’s possible that others won’t.
Who would have thought it would come to this after the NBA saw an increase in viewership and merchandise revenue, as it did in the 2010–2011 season? When Lebron James left Cleveland for the Miami Heat, the hatred he sparked drew many new fans to the game. In Phil Jackson’s last season, ending his career as the greatest coach in NBA history, Laker fans were glued to their television sets all season, rooting for him to complete the threepeat and retire in glory. When Carmelo Anthony was traded from the Denver Nuggets to the New York Knicks, a franchise was reborn and a city was rejuvenated.
We are now missing the chance to see if James and the Heat can come back from that tough finals loss to the Dallas Mavericks and win a title. We won’t see if the Mavericks can defend their unprecedented finals victory. We won’t see Lakers’ guard Kobe Bryant break more scoring records. We won’t see where Dwight Howard and Chris Paul will land via free agency and trade. This season, which we are so close to losing, was bent for great basketball and exciting debate.
However, I am tired of debating the logistics of the proposed deals. I just want basketball back. I want to watch basketball on Christmas Day with my family. Why do I have to be deprived of that?
Instead I am forced to get my basketball fix by watching highlight reels on YouTube. It’s only kind of working; I’m still in basketball remission.
The lockout will be a permanent black mark on the NBA. When people read through the record books and see a gap in years between the 2011 and 2013 NBA champions, they will be reminded. It is something that won’t go away, even when it is all over and the dust has settled. 
We NBA fans are tired of all the back-and-forth, the uncertainty, and the hostility. I no longer care about what the NBPA and owners are nitpicking at to try to get a fair deal for themselves; they need to realize that there’s a big-picture point of these negotiations — to get back on the court.

“Being in an internet company is like being inside a tornado,” said Michael Loren “Fuzzy” Mauldin (SCS ’83, ’89), founder of the internet search company Lycos. Mauldin addressed students and faculty last Friday in a Language Technologies Institute colloquium lecture that focused on converting ideas into fast-growing and successful technology companies.
Mauldin created the Lycos search engine from three pages of code while working as a faculty member at Carnegie Mellon in 1994. “I took information retrieval, applied it to the World Wide Web, and sold it to someone else,” he said. “I dressed something up as a pet rock that people would pay money for, and I got something out of it.”
According to Business Insider, Mauldin also co-founded Conversive, a company that specializes in automated conversation technology, in 1997. After competing in televised BattleBots competitions in 2000, he went on to retire in Austin, Texas, where he currently raises cattle with his wife and continues to compete in robot battles.
In his talk last Friday, Mauldin broke down the business theory behind his commercial success. “The first thing you do is invent something ... and then align your ducks,” he said, referencing how he had lawyers, accountants, and licensing agreements on hand, even before trying to commercialize his product. Mauldin also touched on topics like university intellectual property rules, patents, and stock options. The intellectual property entitlement split for Carnegie Mellon is currently 50-50, meaning the inventor owns half and the school gets the other half, which is significantly higher for the inventor than other universities, such as Rice University or Stanford University.
Mauldin walked students and faculty through introductory business principles, as applied to Lycos. In April of 1996, Lycos had its initial public offering with 3 million shares, priced at $16 per share. “There are many advantages to being a public company,” he said. “One is credibility ... another is liquidity ... but there are many disadvantages to being a public company, too.” He added, “You are always worried about your stock price and what is going to happen at the end of the quarter instead of what’s going to happen in three years.”
As his story progressed, Mauldin moved on from business basics and focused on what happens to a company during an initial public offering (IPO) — mergers and acquisitions basics that cover debt and equity, how a company is funded, accretion and dilution, and how a transaction affects a company’s earnings per share. He also explained the IPO pricing process — when a company goes public, a split or reverse split must occur to push the share price into an ideal target range. In Lycos’ case, it needed to be at least $10, since shareholders would not feel comfortable buying a cheap $2 or $3 stock, but it could not be more than $100 since the expensive price would scare investors away. When Lycos went public, share prices shot up to $29 after the first day of trading. “This was the fastest company to ever go public ­— [it took] a little over nine months,” he said. 
Mauldin jokingly claimed that he predicted the internet bubble (by selling Lycos) before many other internet companies went public, and  that he started the frenzy of internet company IPOs in the late ‘90s.  “What I am proudest of is not that I became wealthy, but that Lycos helped make search free to the world,” Mauldin said. Not only did his company allow people access to information found on the other side of the world, but he also “showed there was money in search.” 
All in all, Mauldin gave future entrepreneurs this parting advice: Not only should one invent something, but one should also get paid to take investments and have them grow as large as possible, to secure both the company and stockholder satisfaction.
Although Mauldin’s success occurred during the early ’90s, much of his advice is still very relevant. “Everything he said about startups and the IPO process is just as valid today. Success gets repeated quite frequently,” commented Michael Shamos, a former lawyer for Lycos and a professor in the school of computer science. “Consider Facebook and Groupon, which are worth billions, and numerous companies worth over $100 million two years after startup.... The ones that die are those that don’t adapt.”

Ever since she moved to Pittsburgh in kindergarten, first-year materials science and engineering major Kate Groschner has pondered the workings of the world around her. Now, Groschner is pondering the workings of a different world by working in materials science and engineering professor Michael McHenry’s synthesis lab, using magnetic properties of minerals to understand Mars’ planetary history.
As a child, Groschner learned about chemistry by playing with the stereotypical volcano set — mixing baking soda and vinegar to produce a volcano-like eruption. She always seemed to put her own twist on her experiments, like using green food coloring for the lava. “I didn’t want to deal with any of this red lava, or white lava — that’s silly,” she joked. These childhood interests in science led her to focus on math, physics, and chemistry in middle and high school, and eventually led her to study minerals found on the Martian surface as an undergraduate researcher at Carnegie Mellon.
Our planetary neighbor does not currently possess a global magnetic field, but certain minerals on the planet’s crust suggest that it possessed one in the past. “What we do is we synthesize [minerals] that are like the minerals you find on Mars. We don’t have samples of the Martian minerals, but we can synthesize the minerals that are found there,” Groschner explained. “We have very good evidence that these are the minerals that are responsible for crustal magnetization on the surface.”
By replicating these Martian minerals in the lab, the researchers can observe how the minerals behave under certain conditions. Then, when they receive measurements of magnetic properties from actual minerals found on Mars, the researchers may be able to better understand the planet’s formation or why the global magnetic field eventually disappeared. Groschner said that another subgroup in McHenry’s lab is working on creating tiny sensors, which are roughly the size of a dime, to someday collect those measurements from Mars.
“We want to understand why the Martian global magnetic field died,” Groschner said. “We really don’t want that to happen on Earth. We should try to find out what went on over there.”
Groschner finds her research successful in fulfilling her lifelong passion for science. “Science just gets me really excited because you find out the most interesting things about how everything in the universe relates to everything else,” she said. “On some level, everything is connected.”
Conducting undergraduate research is in line with Groschner’s future goals of obtaining a Ph.D. and becoming a research professor. She enjoys teaching and mentoring other students, and those interests are noticeable when she works with classmates in her courses. “For me working with Kate is usually fun,” Yudi Chen, a first-year general CIT major and classmate of Groschner’s, said in an email. “She often offers another side of an argument that I do not see right away. We have different strengths and weaknesses, so when I help, she’s willing to help.”
Groschner’s drive to learn also occurs outside the borders of science — she has been learning how to skateboard, putting a Christmas gift she received last year to use. “I like learning new things,” she said.

Every fall, a natural event occurs that gives the season its name: the annual shedding of leaves by trees before winter begins. Many look forward to this time of year for the wonderful colors on trees and in piles of leaves. The vibrant yellows, oranges, and reds are the result of an array of processes.
As most people are taught in their preliminary science classes, a plant’s leaves are where photosynthesis takes place. Different trees have different types of leaves; if these leaves are capable of freezing during the winter, the trees must shed them to protect themselves. 
Shedding leaves ensures that the frozen sap in leaves, which could potentially be harmful, will not affect the trees’ health. In autumn, trees slowly begin to seal off the veins that carry sap from the leaves into the tree; when this vein is sealed off, the leaf falls off. According to the U.S. Department of Agriculture, trees further benefit because decomposing leaves provide more nutrients to the soil and keep their ecosystems healthy.
Leaves change color right before they fall due to a primary characteristic of autumn: the gradually lengthening nights. As the amount of sunlight that falls on trees decreases, leaves perform photosynthesis less often, which means they need less chlorophyll. Chlorophyll, a pigment naturally found in leaves, is part of the photosynthesis process; this pigment is also responsible for giving leaves their green color. Other pigments present in leaves are carotenoids and anthocyanins. The Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources explains that these pigments are responsible for producing orange and red colors, respectively, in not only leaves, but also in fruits like oranges and strawberries.
Apart from contributing to the yellow and orange colors of autumn leaves, caroteniods are responsible for absorbing excess energy from the sun, unneeded for photosynthesis. Chlorophyll and carotenoids are present in trees throughout the year, but the latter is only visible after the amount of chlorophyll in the leaves decreases in fall. Anthocyanins, on the other hand, are only produced by trees in autumn.
While the exact function of anthocyanins is still debated by scientists, two theories have been proposed. The first theory, according to The Journal of Experimental Botany, states that these pigments help trees recover as much sap as possible from leaves before the veins are sealed off. According to Science Daily, the second theory says that anthocyanins protect trees from insects; studies show that aphids are less likely to suck amino acids from and lay eggs in trees with red leaves than those with yellow ones. Hence, all three of these coloring pigments have important roles to play in ensuring that trees can continue to survive.
However, for those more interested in actual color change than the functions of pigments in trees, there are certain signs that one can watch for to see if autumn will be particularly colorful. Areas with droughts tend to see delayed falls, while those where frost comes earlier than normal see leaves turn brown and fall off without changing to bright yellows and oranges. 
Places with warm and wet weather during autumn usually have less brightly colored leaves. The best autumns for producing bright and colorful falls are ones in which the days are warm and dry, while the night temperatures are not below freezing. The temperature during the rest of the year can also be important in producing vivid falls; the brightest leaves are produced after a warm and wet spring and a moderately warm summer.
All these variables show exactly how delicate such a commonplace phenomenon is, and how many factors are responsible for making autumn a much-anticipated season.

Do something right and be rewarded — or do something wrong and be punished. For years, research has focused on this trial-and-error type of learning, but a recent Carnegie Mellon study shows that there’s much more to the picture.
Matthew Walsh, a Ph.D. student in the department of psychology, teamed up with cognitive psychology professor John Anderson to look at how the brain learns using experience and instruction. The results of their study, which illustrates the importance of both experience and instruction, were published this week in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences (PNAS).
“Just imagine a world where we have to learn everything from experience. How would we train surgeons? That would be disastrous. In fact, most of the things we learn are from instruction,” Walsh explained. “John and I observed that there was an imbalance — that there was a lot of research on trial-and-error learning, but instruction is really more prevalent in daily life, and there’s little work how people learn from instruction.”
To explore both instruction- and experience-based learning methods, the researchers set up an experiment that involved participants choosing between two different shapes on a screen. Each shape had a different likelihood of giving a reward, and the participants’ goal was to maximize their rewards. In one segment referred to as the “no instruction” condition, participants were given no prior knowledge of the different likelihoods each shape had of producing a reward. This condition gave the researchers information on how participants learned to gain rewards based on experience alone. In a second condition, participants were instructed on each of the shapes’ likelihood of producing a reward, giving insight to the researchers on how both experience and instruction play a role in learning.
The results may seem unsurprising at first. As they gained more experience, the participants who weren’t instructed increasingly chose the shape that was more likely to be rewarded. Those who received instruction knew to choose the rewarding shapes immediately, leaving little room to improve over the course of the experiment. Interestingly, however, the participants showed similar neural activity, as measured by electroencephalography (EEG), a method of measuring electrical activity along the scalp, during both conditions. Despite the two different learning environments, the participants’ brains seemed to be showing similar activity.
That activity, the researchers eventually deduced, was due to certain neural responses that occurred as a result of experience, and experience-based learning was occurring in both learning environments. “Although instruction may immediately control behavior, certain neural responses must be acquired from experience,” Anderson and Walsh wrote in the PNAS paper.
The results have interesting implications for patients with learning disabilities.
“There are people with amnesia, and these people will have more difficulty learning from instruction but they’ll have a normal capacity to learn from experience,” Walsh said. “With certain clinical populations, one of these two [learning] approaches might be more successful.”
The ability to separate and identify the two different learning systems has been alluded to by other studies in the past. However, in a Carnegie Mellon press release, Anderson stated, “Although some theories anticipate such a dissociation, this is the most direct evidence to date.”
The study is an illustration of how Anderson has been answering questions about how humans learn for quite some time. Anderson was one of nine recipients of the 2011 Benjamin Franklin Medal “for development of the first large-scale computational theory of the process by which humans perceive, learn and reason, and its application to computer tutoring systems,” according to the Franklin Institute’s website. It’s a big award — the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette reported that its recipients have included Albert Einstein, Thomas Edison, and Orville Wright, and that 67 past recipients of the award have gone on to win a Nobel Prize.
Walsh said that this particular study was just one part of a larger body of work. He and Anderson plan to continue their investigations, building a more comprehensive picture of how humans learn and adapt.

Researchers at the European Organization for Nuclear Research (CERN) laboratory in Geneva, Switzerland observed neutrinos traveling faster than the speed of light, results similar to those they observed in September. A stricter tolerance for errors  was enforced for this second test as a result of skepticism over the results in the team’s initial experiment. Reviews of this second experiment are under way, but some claim that their findings, if true, would directly clash with Albert Einstein’s general theory of relativity. While the researchers claim that the second experiment may confirm consistency in the results, only other tests performed elsewhere will have the final word.

Strange weather on the way this century
The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) released an extensive report claiming that it was “virtually certain” that the 21st century would see an increase in warm temperature extremes and a decrease in cold temperature extremes. The report also stated that it was “very likely” that man-made emissions could be linked to this increase. Presented last Friday at the 34th session of the IPCC, the study is a compilation of the work of over 100 scientists from the past two and a half years tasked with assessing the risk of climate change caused by human activity.

Advanced DARPA heart hunters
DARPA, the arm of the United States Department of Defense concerned with the development of new military technologies, has recently announced an initiative aimed at developing better sensors that can identify a person’s “heart signature.” The program, dubbed “Biometrics-at-a-distance,” wants to take existing heartbeat-based biometric technologies and expand their capabilities to accurately isolate a target hiding behind walls or even blending in among a crowd. Similar to a person’s fingerprints or irises, a heartbeat is a also a very good biometric identifier.

Silicon chip mimics the human brain
Researchers at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology have created a silicon chip capable of emulating a synapse, one of the brain structures that allows neurons to communicate with each other. The researchers decided to allow the current to flow through the device in an analog, instead of digital, manner which allowed for a faster and truer emulation of some of the brain’s seemingly analog processes. Though it only consists of about 400 transistors, the researchers claim that the creation of the chip is a significant step towards understanding how complex brain activities, like visual processing, work.

Wonder tape can hold up grown man
A group of German researchers have developed a strong silicone tape based on the tiny, hair-like structures, or setae, that exist on the feet of geckos. When setae touch a surface, Van der Waals forces (attraction between molecules) cause the setae to stick to that surface. The hundreds of thousands of setae on geckos’ feet collectively hold a large amount of weight, enabling the gecko to climb up walls and other surfaces. Challenges in creating the setae-like tape included making the hairs capable of emulating these tiny setae and making them flexible enough for the task. The new tape is so strong that just one eight- by eight-inch piece of it is sufficient to hold up the weight of a full-grown man.

World’s lightest material created
Researchers from University of California, Irvine; HRL Laboratories; and the California Institute of Technology have announced their creation of the world’s lightest material. As a reference, the researchers claim that the material is one hundred times lighter than Styrofoam. Partly designed at the nanometer scale, the new metal is composed of a unique “micro-lattice” cellular structure that is only 0.01 percent solid and 99.99 percent air. Possible future plans for the metal include improvements in battery electrodes and shock absorption technologies.

“Sex kills. Come to Carnegie Mellon and live forever.” It’s sold on T-shirts and repeated — usually with a self-deprecating or sarcastic tone — around campus. But is this perception of abstinence actually true?
Greg, a junior double majoring in biomedical engineering and chemical engineering, thought so. “I feel like students care more about their schoolwork than having sex and having a good time,” he said. “It’s not the best perception that you could have about the school, but it’s not [the] worst.” Michelle, a sophomore science and humanities scholar, guessed that the level of sexual activity at Carnegie Mellon was “less than many other universities.”
Despite their estimates, the data suggests otherwise: According to a recent survey conducted by The Tartan, 61 percent of Carnegie Mellon students have engaged in sexual intercourse at some point in their life. These results are on par with the results of a survey conducted in 2009 by the American College Health Association, which showed that 61 percent of Carnegie Mellon students had oral, vaginal, or anal sex in the past year. That percentage is only slightly lower than the national average of 66.5 percent.
And yet, despite the data that proves otherwise, the myth persists. One explanation for this perception is that students think that they are too nerdy for sex. “There are significantly more nerds here at Carnegie Mellon, so that means more people not having sex,” one survey respondent said. Another survey respondent joked, “When do people have time to leave the clusters to have sex?”
Max, a sophomore majoring in international relations and politics, said, “We’re an engineering school who prides ourself on our geekiness, and I think that plays a role in people’s perception of us.” The level of sexual activity is thought to vary by college, though — “I feel like CIT, SCS aren’t like, that involved in that,” Michaela, a first-year chemistry major, said. “As compared to like H&SS and like, drama people.”
Students also seem to equate partying with sexual activity. Alex, a senior electrical and computer engineering major, said, “Usually you tend to associate, like, [a] very sexually active campus with a party school. Clearly Carnegie Mellon does not have that reputation.”
This association between partying and sex has led students to believe those in Greek organizations are having more sex. “Fraternity guys and sorority girls ... give off the image that they party together,” Greg said, “so they give off the perception that they have sex with each other.” According to The Tartan’s survey, members of Greek organizations are, in fact, more likely to have intercourse, although not by much — 68 percent of Greek students surveyed have had intercourse, and Greek students are 10 percent more likely to have had more than two sexual partners since entering college.
One large reason why people seem to underestimate other students’ sexual activity, though, is because students simply do not talk about it. Rene, a first-year majoring in environmental policy, said, “It’s one of those topics that people generally avoid — if it’s not, like, your best friend, then you wouldn’t ask, and you wouldn’t know.”
One survey respondent argued, “Because of the more academic focus of the students (in comparison to other campuses in Pittsburgh, where one of the ‘goals’ is to find a partner), it is not as openly discussed outside of sex jokes or out of pride, depending on the person. We do poke fun at our lack of ability to get laid a good deal on this campus (for example, the SEX KILLS shirts), but is that just a way hiding a more personal and less ‘important’ sexuality? I think so, at least.”
Kelley Shell, the health promotion specialist for Health Services, suggested that culture, not academics, was the reason for the lack of discussion about sex. “I definitely think that a lot of students in general here aren’t as outward or as forthcoming with talking about sexual health, and there are certainly cultural influences over how comfortable people feel about asking questions or approaching a table where there’s sexual health information, so I think that has a lot of influence,” she said.
However, that doesn’t mean that students aren’t interested in information about sexual health. Four of the top 10 reasons that people use Health Services are related to sexual health, she said, which shows that people are interested in getting information about sex, regardless of how willing they are to talk about it. Health Services also has multiple programs to promote student health, including Free Condom Fridays and educational health programs that the Carnegie Mellon Peer Health Advocates teach.
“In our experience, when we go out to do programs — and I’m speaking for the Peer Health Advocates, but also for myself — even when students are quiet and not necessarily comfortable asking questions, we found them to be really receptive to the programs that we offer,” Shell said. “Maybe it takes them a little while to get comfortable. I think some people have expressed to us during programs that they haven’t had that kind of experience before where someone would just come and talk to them about these kinds of things [outside of a health class].”
This lack of communication about sexual activity isn’t restricted to talk on campus; it is even present during sex. In Body Politics: Women and Health in America, a class taught by associate professor of history Lisa Tetrault, sophomore directing major Priscila Garcia suggested a poll of how people define themselves as good lovers. Their poll results showed that students were often non-communicative about sexual activities within their sexual relationships.
“A lot of it is about how I can give myself to my partner, or how I can do things for him, but it’s not necessarily about communication, do you know what I mean? It’s about, ‘If I can pleasure him, that’s great,’ ” Garcia said. “Sometimes communication gets involved, and it’s like, ‘We talk about it and it’s a communicative thing,’ but most times, it’s ‘I’ll just do this to this person because I know it’ll pleasure them,’ but there’s no sense of [actually discussing it].”
But is not talking about sex really a bad thing? Rene thought so. “I do think sex should be more open,” he said. “You know, I like it when they give out condoms, and people are just comfortable with the idea. It shouldn’t be something that people are afraid, like ‘Oh my god, I had sex, I’m going to go to Hell.’ It should just be something that we’re comfortable with.” A male sophomore in the School of Music thought that students should be far more comfortable about sex, saying, “In the end, we are just college students.”
This pervasive reluctance to be open about sexual activity affects how open students are about other aspects of their sexuality, he argued. “Even when somebody is gay, there are a whole lot of people who aren’t out, and just don’t put themselves on the market because they aren’t comfortable themselves,” he said. “And that’s a travesty I see all the time. Not just for that reason, but just on the whole. If you’re in college and you’re not out, I think it’s a shame. There are a number of things that you can do when you’re out, and that’s not limited to sex — that’s a whole spectrum of things.” 
A survey respondent agreed with this lack of sexual openness, saying, “Carnegie Mellon students are not very sexual. It’s not even about how often/how frequently you engage in sexual activities — it’s more important to be comfortable with yourself and your sexuality. I think most Carnegie Mellon students don’t even know what sexuality actually means.”
Perhaps this isn’t a bad thing. One survey respondent wrote, “While the amount of sexual activity may not be as much, or rather, not stressed as much as it is at other universities ... it just doesn’t own our lives, which I think is very important."

The much-anticipated fifth game in the Elder Scrolls series, Skyrim debuted last week to overwhelming critical acclaim. You know something’s huge in the gaming world when even CNN gives it a mention, and Skyrim definitely jumped that bar on its launch date.
The game, alongside its predecessors, centers around one main mechanic: ultimate freedom. You are a rising hero in the fantasy country of Skyrim, and you have the ability to go wherever you please and do as you will on your own timeline. There are no mandated events, no enforced storyline, nothing that must immediately be done — and because of that, Skyrim unlocks infinite possibilities as a storytelling machine rather than a narrative experience.
The country of Skyrim itself has a little bit of that in-Soviet-Russia charm: It’s the snowy north, with harsh mountains and whipping winds, and most citizens of the various towns speak in corny, Slavic-esque accents. Your character begins as a prisoner being taken to his or her execution, stuck on the back of a small wagon; before this happens, though, a massive dragon attacks, giving you the chance to escape. And then — you’re free.
As for me, I immediately ran off to go explore a small outcropping of caves with a series of short puzzles – and some zombies too, I guess – inside. Upon arrival, I was surprised to find that a couple of bandits were inside, and one of them was in the middle of attempting to solve the first cave puzzle on his own. He met his death in the form of a wall of arrows, triggered by pulling the wrong lever. This, I think, speaks wonders about the AI system Bethesda has crafted as a whole: Non-player characters have their own desires, behaviors, and daily routines, and will frequently surprise players with their craftiness or loyalty. They each have a speaking style and mannerisms all their own. They’ll also surprise with their occasional vengeance: I killed a single chicken and had an entire town up in arms after me, torches ablaze. Apparently, chickens are highly prized in Skyrim.
On top of hundreds of quests available across the enormous (really, really enormous) sprawl of the world map, Skyrim offers players hundreds of random events and tiny encounters in between towns. Whether it’s engaging in a random dragon battle (cue epic music), stumbling over the hut of an angry witch, spending a night exchanging beer and songs with a traveling bard, or foregoing the main quest to attend Skyrim’s magical academy for a few months, the way in which players express themselves through their hero’s personal journey differs drastically from person to person. And the sense that the journey and the world are yours alone is what makes _Skyrim- truly the masterpiece of the year.
Of course, with a game so great in scope, there are definitely flaws — crashes galore, for example. If you’re playing the Xbox version, make sure to play from cache each time rather than installing: The hard copy has a glitch where, upon installation, textures revert to the lowest-resolution versions possible. I managed to stumble into a camp of giants and ended up getting clubbed to death by one immediately; my avatar’s body flew up off the map and into space, and refused to come back down again.
And Bethesda, we need to talk about horse design: Rideable in-game horses are laughably weak compared to your character. A horse will die horribly in a crack of flesh and neighing if asked to hop more than about... five feet. And you may think you parked your horse outside like a responsible owner, but nope — it’s gone. Sometimes it’ll trot back to the nearest inn to wait for you, and sometimes it just decides to enter the void and randomly disappear forever.
God or demon, hero or despot, wise wanderer or innocent novice — the role-playing aspect of games has been done before, but never with this scope and never before in such a realistic way. Skyrim offers us a peek into the possibilities of future games: freedom within a fantasy world that is somehow more beautiful than our own, a different time and place.

Schenley Plaza is one of my favorite places in Pittsburgh. The urban green space, which occupies the southeast corner of Forbes Avenue and Schenley Drive, often features acoustic musical performances at lunchtime when the weather is nice. Since I eat lunch there several times a week, I’ve been curiously watching the development and construction of a new restaurant nestled between the carousel and food kiosks over the past few months. This past Monday, The Porch at Schenley finally opened its doors to the public.
Eat’n Park Hospitality Group owns the restaurant; with the company owning other restaurants ranging in styles from that of the Eat’n Park chain to Downtown’s Six Penn Kitchen, I was very curious about what this new restaurant, placed in a location that is dear to my heart, had to offer. With the company of a few friends, I decided to give it a try.
The sharp, modern-looking exterior of The Porch at Schenley is attractive and welcoming, especially with the large outdoor porch facing the green space of Schenley Plaza. It’s unfortunate that the restaurant opened so late in the fall season, as the cold weather will force diners to wait until the spring to test out the restaurant’s outdoor seating area.
When I walked in, I was greeted cheerfully and handed a menu by a staff member. I was politely instructed to order at the cashier counter when I had made my choice from the menu, which consisted of a variety of American- and Mediterranean-style salads, sandwiches, and pizzas ranging from $7 to $14. I ordered the chicken roti sandwich and got some water at the self-serve water station, which offered waters infused with sliced cucumbers and lemons as well as a strawberry-blueberry-mint combination. This was a nice touch; both flavors were refreshing and tasty.
The food was brought to our table in less than 15 minutes. The chicken roti sandwich was good — the meat was juicy, and the sliced pear and whole-grain mustard worked well together. As a side, the diced potatoes were delicious — buttered and seasoned just right. The curried ketchup was an interesting touch, adding a little more spice and flavor than your typical everyday ketchup.
My friends had the wood-fired Bolognese pizza and the “farm stand vegetable burger.” I was able to try a bite or two of their dishes, and found the pizza to be pretty good with its crispy, rustic-style crust as its strong-point. The veggie burger, however, left much to be desired. The arugula and fennel toppings tasted fresh, but the vegetable patty itself fell flat — it tasted bland and had a mushy consistency.
Despite the one miss, the food, which is locally sourced, was well-prepared overall. For the most part, the staff was attentive and the service was efficient. 
The restaurant’s dinner setup is also slightly different from that of lunch. The dinner menu offers a few more items that are a tad more expensive, and a wait staff member seats you and takes your order for a more formal, less fast-paced dining experience than that of the lunch setup.

The Mattress Factory, a museum of contemporary art, showcased modern artwork created by Egyptian and American artists as part of Sites of Passage, an installation that began in September and will continue until Jan. 8. Co-curator and performance artist Tavia La Follette guides visitors on a tour of an array of artwork that includes photographs, paintings, film, music, and other audio. Much of the politically driven work evinces social consciousness and expresses solidarity with the protests in Tahrir Square that began in January, as well as with other international resistance movements.
The Sites of Passage exhibit is the outgrowth of the Firefly Tunnels project, La Follette’s brainchild. As the Firefly Tunnels project’s website explains, La Follette found inspiration from her trip to Egypt in the summer of 2010, where she participated in Artists Residency Egypt, a contemporary arts and culture collective. On the trip, she came up with an idea for an artistic dialogue between Egyptians and Americans, and the Firefly Tunnels project was born. The project is a three-week performance art and installation workshop, which in turn created a global network of experimental artists who exchange ideas and create art through a virtual performance art lab. Within the network, artists can upload work to display to fellow artists as well as respond to and edit their colleagues’ work.
According to La Follette on the Mattress Factory’s website, “The Firefly Tunnels are metaphorical passageways for the exchange of ideas through the language of Performance Art. One can think of them as an Underground Railroad that crosses the borders of language, a system of tunnels [aided by the internet] that doesn’t believe in the barriers of countries or the obstruction of segregated tongues.”
The work of these artists, both American and Egyptian, is displayed in a series of adjacent rooms in the Mattress Factory. La Follette guides visitors from one work to another, explaining the message that each artist hoped to convey. Each work of art is poignant and political and will either disturb or inspire.
In particular, Noha Redwan’s “Over My Dead Body” attempts to re-create the experience of Egyptians traveling on the subway during this year’s revolution using a variety of media. The experience is both powerful and unnerving. Redwan incorporates seemingly mundane objects, such as seats from a coach bus, a map of Egyptian subway routes, and steel grab bars as part of the installation. In addition, the artwork includes audio of riveting commentary by Egyptian artists discussing brutal crackdowns by loyalist police forces. In the background, one can distinctly hear the rhythmic clacking of a departing subway train. The effect is eerie and atmospheric.
Paintings and graffiti by artist Matt J. Hunter surround the subway facsimile. Pictured are Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak and victims of his police forces, as well as Khalid Said, whose death at the hands of Egyptian security forces arguably galvanized popular dissent. Subway passengers are also made to look like skeletons, peering through the windows of a train. Heavy use of reds and oranges invokes bloodshed occurring aboveground, and cadaver-like depictions of subway passengers elicit feelings of impending death. Each piece is similarly interactive, allowing one to also become an active participant of the exhibit and feel its emotional tenor.
One flaw, however, is the lack of any evident collaboration between artists. Sites of Passage is the result of cross-global communication between American and Egyptian artists, who provided each other feedback and critique throughout the creative process; as such, the exhibit would have been more cohesive if the exhibit had shown these interactions between the artists. Instead, the exhibit moves from one work to another. Each work is given its own physical space and a statement about the piece by the respective artist is provided. Nonetheless, the works that comprise the exhibit are compelling, and the experience is powerful.
La Follette has a clear vision of what she would like the artistic dialogue of the Firefly Tunnels project to achieve. “This exchange has been focusing on how metaphor is the missing link in the translation of ideas,” she said in an email. “As the aesthetic interpreter to the heart, I believe metaphor can help us better understand our own humanity.... I never underestimate the power of symbols. Symbols help me to say what I cannot say with words, they tap into our emotions. Emotions, like religion, help us recognize our values. Values, like cultures, contradict. It is this common contradiction that interests me.”

Being a romantic doesn’t just refer to how chivalrous you are on a date. Romanticism refers to a European literary, artistic, and intellectual movement from the late 18th and early 19th century celebrating nature and the sublime experience. The Pittsburgh Symphony Orchestra (PSO) paid tribute to this period with its Romantic Masters concert last Friday at Heinz Hall.
The concert started off with Sergei Prokofiev’s Classical Symphony, his first symphony, which was composed to emulate the style of classical composer Joseph Haydn. The orchestra showed off its playful side with the piece, and carefully manipulated dynamics to hold the audience’s attention during the more repetitive second movement. The performance wasn’t without error, though — one of the flautists kept cracking notes throughout the piece, distracting from the sweetness of the flutes’ part.
Pianist Gabriela Montero joined the orchestra to perform Prokofiev’s Piano Concerto No. 3. Montero, a Venezuelan-American pianist who performed with Yo-Yo Ma at President Barack Obama’s inauguration, didn’t have much of a physical stage presence as she performed, but her musical abilities grabbed the audience’s attention. She and the orchestra delved into the haunting and complex piece, deftly balancing the sound of the soloist and the orchestra so that the concerto, rather than the musician, was the focus of the performance.
The PSO showed off its darker side as it built tension and played with the subtle nuances of emotion throughout the concerto. One thing the piece lacked, however, was power, as the orchestra didn’t provide a large fortissimo finish.
After the concerto, Montero sat at the piano to play an encore — but instead of performing something from the usual repertoire of piano encore pieces, she took the microphone and asked the audience to hum a tune for her to improvise off of. “Classical improvisation used to be very much a part of the classical musician’s expression,” but is now usually reserved for jazz musicians, she said. Someone sang a bar from “Some Enchanted Evening,” and the whole audience sighed in approval. She started off by playing the song as it was originally written, then paused for a moment before beginning to play so lyrically and smoothly that it was difficult to believe that she was making it all up on the spot. She interwove the original theme throughout her improv, but built it into something far more intricate and ended with a dramatic flourish.
A brief intermission was followed by Johannes Brahms’ Symphony No. 2; the cheery composition is not as musically interesting as Prokofiev’s Concerto, but the PSO performed it well and finally showed off the ensemble’s power with a large finish.
Although the PSO provided a great performance, the turnout was somewhat indicative of the larger problems orchestras are having with getting an audience. The audience was disappointingly small — which, admittedly, may have been due to the fact that Downtown was celebrating Light Up Night — and the attendees were overwhelmingly in the 55-plus age bracket. During a particularly tense section of the Concerto, a woman in the back row nodded off and started snoring softly, waking up abruptly as the orchestra hit a loud chord. “It happens all the time,” an usher for Heinz Hall whispered apologetically.
The PSO is an excellent orchestra and is able to bring in top-notch guest soloists, but it needs to find a way to draw in a broader audience if it wants to continue to do so.

“No fool is greater than a learned fool,” proclaims the character Clitandre in the School of Drama’s production of The Learned Ladies. The play chronicles the love between Clitandre (junior acting major Lachlan McKinney) and Henriette (junior musical theater major Olivia Harris).
The “learned ladies” collectively refer to Henriette’s mother, aunt, and sister. Each of these women is obsessed with the idea of being educated, especially in “verse, prose, Latin, and Greek.” Henriette’s sister Armande refuses marriage to Clitandre, until he becomes involved with Henriette. Henriette’s mother Philaminte (junior musical theater major Casey Lane Anderson) rules her household with a strong hand. Philaminte wishes that Henriette would wed the “learned” Trissotin (junior musical theater major Jon Jorgenson) who is only after Henriette for her money.
The Learned Ladies was written in 1672 by the French playwright Molière. The School of Drama’s interpretation of the play was modernized and set in the 1960s — mostly. Although the program stated that the play is set in the ’60s and the costumes support this idea, Henriette is seen texting on a cell phone during a few scenes. The interpretation of setting the play almost 300 years after it was written and including modern technology provides a unique take on an older comedy.
Opening night began with an unexpected twist. Upon entering the Helen Wayne Rauh Studio Theater, patrons were seated and eager for the show to start. Minutes before the show was to begin, though, the fire alarm in the Purnell Center went off and the building was evacuated. After a 45-minute delay, the audience was permitted to re-enter the building and the show was able to begin.
Despite the incident, the cast put on a fantastic performance. The venue for the play was intimate, removing the need for microphones. A few lines of the show were lost under music that was louder than the actors’ voices, but the majority of the show was clear and the actors were easy to understand. The background music was placed well for dramatic effect.
Unique to this production was the lack of a backstage. All costume changes as well as stage entrances and exits were done in one large room. Lights were cast on the stage area from either side of the room, and actors who were not in a specific scene remained behind the lights. Props were thus visible for the entire show, as well as additional actors and crew. Despite the seeming awkwardness of the situation, the auxiliary people and props never seemed to cause a distraction to the audience.
The show included plenty of comedic relief from characters Martine the maid (junior acting major Grace Rao) and Belise the aunt (junior musical theater major Stephanie Hogan). Martine is gum-chomping and stubborn, and mocks the learned ladies every chance she gets. Belise was a crowd favorite thanks to her provocative costume and constant infatuation with the male cast members.
The show was approximately 90 minutes long and included plenty of laughs. Due to the rhymed format of the play, actors were constantly finishing each other’s rhymes, resulting in playful banter between characters. The cast presented an enjoyable performance and had the audience laughing for the duration of the night. The final scene involving Henriette and Armande under a red light provided nice closure to an ambiguous show. The cast certainly deserves a round of applause for a job well done on the production.

Alumni authors Jon Skovron and Ryan Dixon came to the Connan Room last Wednesday for the sixth installation of the Real Life Stories Series, hosted by the Alumni Association. They came to talk about life after graduation and the process of getting published as young authors. According to the Alumni Association’s website, “these stories give students the real truth about life after Carnegie Mellon.”
The event was presented in modified interview format: Questions deposited in a bowl were answered and the two authors took turns asking each other random questions. This format, while entertaining at times, was not ideal for the talk and led to fragmented responses and incomplete stories.
Skovron, who graduated from Carnegie Mellon in 1999 with a degree in acting, was charismatic and energetic throughout the talk. Upon graduating, Skovron knew he wanted to explore other mediums for his art. “If there was one thing I was sure of, I was not going to be an actor,” he said. After some community theater work, he was faced with 10 years of unsuccessful short stories and novels until he found his place writing young adult fiction. His novel Struts and Frets, an indie rock coming-of-age novel, was published by Amulet Books in 2009. Skovron’s career has been much more successful since finding his niche in young adult fiction: His second novel, Misfits, the story of a demon girl in Catholic school, was published in August of this year.
Dixon graduated from Carnegie Mellon in 2002 with a degree in directing. After a few years of consulting jobs, he realized he wanted to write. His first graphic novel, Hell House: The Awakening, was published in 2010 by Viper Comics. Dixon’s life currently consists of balancing his own work and his consulting job. He has little down time and doesn’t sleep much. “Not much has changed since my Carnegie Mellon days,” Dixon said.
The two authors did not focus on the process of getting published, as many audience members had hoped and expected. Rather, they seemed to get caught up in talking about writing and storytelling in a broader sense, commenting extensively on the ability of a well-structured story to cross medium borders. Since both authors had experience working with screenplays and novels, storytelling through different media was clearly important to them.
Skovron and Dixon also discussed the importance of balance and motivation throughout the talk. “If you don’t have some balance, if you don’t take care of yourself, if you don’t fill the well, you’ll dry up and it’ll suck,” Skovron said. “Life is the most important thing. And if you lose sight of that, your work will suffer.”
Dixon and Skovron both felt that constantly working is the best way to stay motivated. Dixon sets small goals for himself and is always multitasking. “If I’m constantly writing, I can just be in that zone all of the time,” he said. Skovron is less of a multitasker, but agreed that it is “better to keep the fire going.”
There was a short Q & A session after the talk, and audience members used the time to ask more specific questions about the process of becoming published and reviewed. Both authors claimed to be fairly immune to receiving negative reviews, thanks in part to their experiences at Carnegie Mellon.
While the two authors had interesting stories to tell, sophomore creative writing and decision science dual major Lou Lamanna was disappointed by the presentation. “A lot of what they talked about was the after-getting-published state, as opposed to the getting-published state,” Lamanna said. Other attendees seemed pleased with the talk, however, and spent time afterward chatting with the two authors.

Dear Patrick,
I’m about to go on a date with this girl, and I’m really nervous. I almost always mess these up. Do you have any tips for making my first date successful?
Thanks,
Ordinarily, Personal Expression Never Merits Outside, Unnecessary Tips, However I Need Some Engaging Romance Tips Forthwith, Otherwise Ordeals Take off
Dear OPEN MOUTH INSERT FOOT,
There are two schools of thought for first dates. The first is that dates are for getting to know someone. Take her out to dinner or coffee, and just talk. That way you can realize pretty quickly if, say, she’s a Nazi or doesn’t like Batman (both dealbreakers).
On the other hand, you already have the date, so you know she likes you. Your job is to simply not screw that up. Go to a movie or an activity that involves minimal talking. This plan won’t work for very long, though. You might get one or two dates out of her before she starts wondering, “Why does he just stare at me whenever I ask him a question? Did he not hear?” And then you’ll wind up with her yelling at you for the rest of the date.
Or just be yourself — however risky that may be,
Patrick Hoskins
Dear Patrick,
I’m so cold, so very cold. I asked my landlord to turn on the heat and he just laughed maniacally. My desktop is running Crysis just so my room can get a little warmer. How can I get warm? I don’t remember what it feels like.
Please help,
Indeed, My Sole Occupation Consists Of Layering Downy, Immense Manufactured Sheets, Hiding Inside, but Vexing Environments Remain — I’m Nearly Glacial
Dear IM SO COLD IM SHIVERING,
I have one word for you: Snuggie. “What is that?” you ask. Well, since you’ve been living under a rock, a Snuggie is a blanket — with sleeves! “Surely you jest, Patrick; after all, a blanket that ingenious would surely become commonplace,” you say. Well, sadly many people fail to see its practicality, and instead choose to freeze rather than bear the shame. But the shame of wearing a Snuggie actually keeps you warmer! It’s like a robe, without that annoying belt hanging off of you. If you want to get fancy, some German versions even have built-in gloves.
I’m wearing a Snuggie right now,
Patrick Hoskins

When was the last time you gave an album your full, undivided attention? Last week? Last year? Never? In an age of streaming and social media, smartphones, and a slew of other tools and gadgets, why should a piece of music, let alone an entire album, deserve our exclusive attention?
Unfortunately, I’ve become so accustomed to browsing the internet while listening to a new album that I often never give a piece of music the attention it deserves. The proliferation of music has conveniently coincided with the growth of online blogs and magazines. More and more, I feel myself being sucked into a review and being persuaded to believe that some new release is not only unforgettable and one of the best things put out this year, but also requires my immediate attention and subsequent praise. And the best part is that I usually have instant access to that artist’s new release through streaming services, through a blog that uploads the MP3s, or through torrents. It’s so incredibly easy to read a review, obtain the music, and buy into the hype, but am I really listening to the music? Has it received my full, undivided attention? I sincerely doubt it.
After realizing my somewhat problematic listening behaviors and seeing that I had 1,798 tracks that were released in 2011 sitting in my iTunes library, everything started to make sense. Yes, I listen to a lot of music and I am a DJ, but I really don’t need 1,798 songs from 2011. I recommend taking a look at your play counts — how many times did you actually listen to that Nicolas Jaar album after reading that gushingly indulgent review on your favorite music site? Soon you’ll realize that your library has a lot of extraneous songs that can easily be forgotten and discarded. Be wary of the reviewer. Give albums your full, undivided attention. Limit the amount of music you take into your life. It’s already made me a happier person.

The total student loan debt in the United States is $950 billion, according to Bloomberg L.P., and the average student graduated last year with $25,250 in debt. Overall, Americans owe more in student loans than they do on their credit cards. Given these statistics, how does Carnegie Mellon stack up?
According to the College Board, the average 2010 Carnegie Mellon senior graduated with $30,744 in debt, over $5,000 more than the national average. On the other hand, it seems that Carnegie Mellon students are finding it easier to repay their loans than most Americans: While the Department of Education reports that, nationally, 8.8 percent of students whose first loan payment was due in the 2009 fiscal year (the “FY 2009 cohort”) defaulted on their loans in the 2010 fiscal year, only 0.5 percent of Carnegie Mellon’s FY 2009 cohort defaulted in that time.
“That’s a healthy statistic,” said Linda Anderson, the director of student financial aid. “We’re very fortunate. Our students take their financial obligations seriously. And the most important thing is they secure employment in their chosen field upon graduation, which is reflected in that percentage.”
According to Anderson, the average debt of the 46 percent of Carnegie Mellon students who graduated with debt in fiscal year 2011 was $29,303. She said that that figure has remained more or less steady for the past few years.
Despite the high cost of college, and of Carnegie Mellon in particular, Anderson said that she believes higher education is worth it: “I think for the great majority of our students, borrowing, taking on student loan debt is positive. They’ve made the right choices.”
Students, said Anderson, have to figure out whether a loan is the right choice for them on an individual basis.
“Did it help you achieve your overall academic goals? Upon graduation, did it help you obtain a position in your career path? Are you able to successfully budget and repay your loans?” Anderson asked. “The value of your education appreciates. It’s not like a car which depreciates as soon as you buy it.”
Junior creative writing and philosophy major Paul Carboni said that, to him, the debt is worth it. “The financial aid that I’ve been able to get has put me at a spot that I feel like I’d probably be in a similar boat were I to have gone to a local college, a community college, a smaller university, but for much greater payoff,” Carboni said. “So I feel like, while I may have ended up paying less, I don’t think that it would have been by much, and I think that I’m definitely getting my money’s worth.”
Carboni, who expects to graduate with up to $22,000 in debt, said that, despite the current jobs market, he is not worried about finding employment after college.
“I don’t have any hard numbers, but there doesn’t seem to be a gigantic worry among the campus population of not being able to find work after graduation,” he said. “Part of that may be because we have such a strong specialization in very technical, specialized fields. But even in our fine arts programs, people may be unsure of what they want to do, but there seems to be this pervasive feeling that they will be able to get it.”
Junior mechanical and biomedical engineering major Laura Laham said that she currently plans to work before going to graduate school in order to pay off some of her student loans. Laham originally considered going to community college and switching to a university, so as to mitigate the cost of her education, but eventually decided against it.
“I kind of took money out of the picture when I decided on schools, and Carnegie Mellon seemed right for me, so I ended up here regardless of the cost,” Laham said. 
Like Carboni, Laham did not regret her decision to go to a more expensive school. “Except for the cost, I don’t think I would have changed anything about my experience here, and I do believe that there are opportunities have opened up for me here that I wouldn’t have gotten anywhere else.... It’s part of the deal,” she said.
Neither Carboni nor Laham had a clear idea of when their loans would be paid off. 
“I know there’s a process I can go through and just kind of do it a little at a time, and it will take a while, but people do it,” Laham said. “I’m bracing myself for it, but I’m not worried about it.”
Carboni expressed hope for his debt prospects because of President Barack Obama’s new executive order regarding student loans.
According to U.S. News & World Report, the executive order will allow students to consolidate their federal loans, thereby easing payment. It will also move up the starting date of a plan passed by Congress that caps student loan payments at 10 percent of income and forgives loans after 20 years. The plan was originally slated to start in 2014, but it will now apply to anyone who took out their first loan after 2007 and who takes out another loan after 2011.
Anderson said that she views student loans as an investment in a student’s future. “Your return on the investment is not only measured in terms of how affordable a loan repayment is,” she said. “It’s measured by so many other factors. It’s your professional growth, it’s your contributions to society, it’s everything. The return on your investment is just much more than your accumulated indebtedness and your ability to repay.”

For Carnegie Mellon students, course registration week is one of the most stressful times in the school year. Like taking an exam or giving a final presentation, registering for classes has a large impact on a student’s future.
To ensure fairness and that students graduate on time, the university’s administration has implemented several policies to help out.
The university’s most important decision seems to be that students register in order of seniority.
“Long time registration policy has been that students register by class level — seniors and graduate students, then juniors, sophomores, and freshmen,” University Registrar John Papinchak said in an email.
Typically, each class level registers on a particular day, and within a particular class level, students are assigned specific registration start times based on their student identification numbers. 
“When we developed On-Line Registration in 1997, we determined that we needed to spread students out in time blocks so that the application (and servers) could handle the demand,” Papinchak said. “We developed a strategy that places students into four broad groupings and five time assignments within those groups.” 
Even though it puts them at a disadvantage, some first-years understand why seniority is an appropriate measure of priority. “I do think it’s fair to let upperclassmen all register first, because they have less time left to take the classes,” said first-year computer science major Jennine Nash.
First-year computer science major Steven Klee agreed, saying, “If we don’t get the classes we want, we can always take them next semester, but [seniors] can’t.”
However, a consequence of this system is that first-years and sophomores may find some of their departments’ required classes filled with seniors and juniors from other departments who got to register earlier.
“Because of the way students get to schedule, it’s often the case where somebody elsewhere on campus has been allowed to schedule ahead of our business students,” said associate teaching professor Evelyn Pierce, who teaches the Business Presentations course, which is required for all students majoring in business administration. 
“[Students from other departments] should not get into the class until all of our students in business have been able to get in,” she added.
To ensure that all students find space in their required courses regardless of registration start times, the administration imposes quotas on students from certain departments.
For example, there are several slots in most computer science classes that are reserved for computer science students.
“It’s important that we have these reserved spots so that we can graduate,” Klee said.
The disadvantage, however, is that students have a much harder time getting into classes that are not in their home department. “I’m currently on the wait list for several of my classes in CFA,” said senior psychology major Brianna Kent. “I wish that the professor would up the number of spots not reserved for art students.”
“When students register, some course sections will automatically place them onto the waiting list,” Papinchak said. “This depends upon whether the course-section is full, or it has reservations — based upon students’ home college, department, and class.”
However, from assistant teaching professor Geoffrey Hitch’s perspective, the problem is that there are too many students for too small a class size, and manipulating quotas does not address this issue.
“There are only so many ways to cut from the same pie,” said Hitch, who teaches the popular Business Acting class, which currently has a wait list of more than double its class size.
The obvious solution would seem to be to increase class sizes, but professors point out that this takes away from the learning experience.
“Every additional student decreases the amount of time we have per student,” Pierce said. “It’s hard for some students to understand that.... But it’s not to their advantage if we let everyone in who needed it. Otherwise, we might end up in a situation where everyone stands up and gives a 30 second presentation.”
Instead, professors like Pierce and Hitch often push for additional sections.
“If I take more than 20, I’m going to hurt the class. But now that I have two sections, I can teach 40,” Hitch said. “At the end of every semester I write to the undergrad business administration and ask if we can have additional sections next year.”
But Pierce pointed out that the administration is often reluctant to add additional sections because of the financial costs. “All the faculty are hired from the teaching track, and we are paid per section,” she explained. 
“We have this amount of money, and how do we want to maximize it in so many ways? So when it comes to communications classes, how many sections can we have in a semester without it becoming too expensive to hire faculty?”
While the system isn’t perfect, professors and students are still relatively satisfied with it. “There is no 100 percent ideal way, but this system is the best we know,” Pierce said.

A university press release announced on Monday that Carnegie Mellon has formed an academic partnership with Sun Yat-sen University in China. The partnership is the next step in a series of international expansions.
Located in southern China in the city of Guangzhou, Sun Yat-sen University will be the site of a new joint graduate program in electrical and computer engineering that will offer master’s degrees and doctorates, beginning in 2013.
As described in the official announcement email, the goal of the new joint institute of engineering is to “deliver world-class education in engineering, perform cutting-edge research and development, and find solutions to real-world engineering problems.”
Pradeep K. Khosla, the dean of the Carnegie Institute of Technology, described the new program in greater detail.
Located in Guangdong province, Sun Yat-sen University is at the heart of China’s “electronics belt,” as Khosla described it. The dean described his aspirations for the program, stating, “Our goal is to position [Sun Yat-sen University] as one of the top places for engineering in China.”
Jian-Gang “Jimmy” Zhu, an Instutite of Electrical and Electronics Engineers fellow, director of the Data Storage Systems Center, and professor in the department of electrical and computer engineering, was directly involved in the founding of this new program.
“China needs R&D forces,” Zhu said. “The Chinese higher education system is struggling to get graduates with a high enough quality of training for innovation.” He said that the new Carnegie Mellon partnership is the “next step” in achieving this goal.
First-year electrical and computer engineering major Chidimma Onwuegbule tentatively supported the new program, stating that it was “a good move, but some things need to be addressed.” She expressed concern regarding the political state of China and the effect it would have on this program. “Without the freedom of information, there is no guarantee that the quality of education from this program will be the same as here,” she said.
Khosla said that he was comfortable with setting up a partnership in China, stating that Carnegie Mellon had been in contact with the U.S. State Department prior to this deal and that “total intellectual freedom” had been guaranteed to researchers and students in the engineering program.
Khosla admitted that, if he were to be involved in the founding of a humanities or social sciences program in China, he “might be hesitant.” 
But he emphasized that Carnegie Mellon is “not developing an entire university” and claimed that social and political restrictions would not have an impact on engineering work.
Senior economics and professional writing double major Caroline Roper, the president of Carnegie Mellon’s Amnesty International chapter, was unsure. 
“In the past, greater economic growth has been correlated with more equitable human rights, but I don’t know if that can be assumed,” she said. “Nations can be distracted by economic development.”
Roper said she sees the program as slightly better than the newly announced Rwanda program, due to China’s better overall standard of living as well as an alleged smaller possibility of the products and research being developed from the new Chinese partnership program being used for military applications.
“Just because two countries may have different political and philosophical outlooks doesn’t mean they can’t have an economic connection,” Khosla contended. 
He promised that Carnegie Mellon “will see significant benefits” from the partnership, including approximately $25 million in new research funding.
“The university can’t afford to graduate someone who cannot operate globally,” Khosla said. 
The program is one means of further connecting students to different cultures, and Khosla spoke in favor of greater cultural training for undergraduate students.
While the partnership with Sun Yat-sen University opens up many new opportunities for Carnegie Mellon, some contend that its announcement was not widely publicized. Roper said that she wanted to know more about the program.
“The administration could do a better job of informing people,” she said.

Assistant teaching professor Tim Flaherty’s Matrices and Linear Transformations students were met with an unusual turn of events when they came into lecture last Friday: Their class was taught by a turkey.
During the preceding week, students were able to make a donation toward their choice of 10 professors donning the costume, with the one gaining the most donations being declared the winner. Flaherty was the winner, and had to teach his classes while wearing a turkey suit.
The event was run by Mortar Board, a national honor society for seniors, which annually organizes “Turkey for a Day.” The group uses the proceeds to fund its service projects, which includes the 24-hour Read-a-thon for Watchful Shepherd, a children’s advocacy organization.
The event also serves to raise awareness. “[It’s] something that really gets the name of Mortar Board out there,” said Ariel Soloman, senior finance major and president of the Carnegie Mellon chapter of Mortar Board. “And we try to target mainly underclassmen professors or professors that teach large intro courses.”
While over half the teachers who were asked to participate decided not to, of the 10 who did, Flaherty was among the most enthusiastic in his endeavor to win.
“He donated money into his own pot. He very much wanted to win,” said vice president of Mortar Board Laura Patzer, a senior statistics and creative writing major. “When we were tabling he would encourage people walking by to put money into his jug, so I’m really excited that he won.”
The Mortar Board team members were not the only ones to be excited by the outcome. Jung Byun, a sophomore math major, recounted her experience upon entering class: “I walked in, and I just laughed.”
Flaherty’s victory was also a source of pride for students. “I think it’s pretty cool that a professor would sign up and do something like this.... I’m very proud of this class,” Byun said. She said that Flaherty’s drive to win also inspired the students to participate.
Flaherty himself said that his day as a turkey was “a thrill.” He had won the event two years ago and said that he felt much less silly this time around. “The suit’s comfortable, and it got a little warm at times, and the beak would occasionally get in my eyes ... but it became just a normal class.”
Byun disagreed, saying, “He did a good job composing himself, but throughout the class I couldn’t help but laugh.”
Flaherty said that he was proud of his students for participating: “Any time students and professors can work together towards something besides the academic, it helps build a real rapport between students and teachers, and any time you can do that, it builds a real sense of community, and students become more comfortable around teachers, and that I think can only lead to good things.”

The Carnegie Mellon University Store has implemented new services which will make the purchase of textbooks more convenient for students.
At the beginning of the fall semester, the bookstore began to offer a rental service for books. 
Although the new service was not heavily marketed to students, Matt Senvisky, the textbooks and trade books manager at the University Store, said, “Renting textbooks has really picked up. We are trying to get the word out there so that students can be aware of all their options so they can make the best decision.”
Students can select a rental option on the bookstore’s website. They can then designate the duration of their rental, which will determine the price. 
The longer the rental period, the higher the cost. This flexibility with timing is convenient for those instances where students’ purchased textbooks take longer than anticipated to arrive or they become temporarily lost in the mail.
In addition to the textbook rental option, the University Store has a new partnership with several websites that sell and rent textbooks, including Amazon.com. 
The affiliation will provide students with a real-time listing of the pricing of a textbook from various sources.
Senvisky said that the new partnership is exciting.
“It will allow students to compare the prices of textbooks at once. Amazon has covered the market. We are at the mercy of Amazon. By going through the University Store’s website to Amazon, the University Store receives a small percent of the sale. It starts at 2 percent and then increases if the traffic increases,”  Senvisky said.
He said that, although he has only been in his current position for a year, he is aware that the University Store has a bad reputation when it comes to the sale of textbooks. This is a misunderstanding that he wants to eliminate. 
“We really care about the students and want to help them out as much as we can. I am fighting with the publishers to lower their prices,” he said.
“Everyone assumes we are the bad guys, but the prices are set by the publishers. We are really just trying to help out the students,” said Juan Lafontaine, a full-time University Store employee.
University Store employee Mike Dingman said, “This new option will create more options for students while helping [the University Store] out. You guys need us. We are here when you need last-minute supplies for your projects.”
The University Store has tabled in the University Center to advertise the textbook rental service and the new pricing comparison window offered on its website. They offered a variety of large portions of free popcorn, and will continue tabling in the University Center on Nov. 29 and Nov. 30.
After picking up a cup of free popcorn, first-year English major Vanessa Branch said, “I think the new options are really helpful. It’s awesome. You are still getting your books at a cheap price while helping out the bookstore.”
Students will not lose much by using the University Store’s website to purchase their textbooks, even if they plan on using Amazon.com or some other competitor. By going through the University Store’s website, students will help the University Store to remain afloat as it, “...treads water because of the changing market,” as Senvisky said. Textbook purchases will be the exact same cost as if students were to directly purchase from a competitor’s website.
“I am excited about the changes, and now it is a matter of getting the word out there,” Senvisky said.

Local authorities try to find solutions for homelessness
Pennsylvania State Senator Wayne Fontana and City Councilman Bill Peduto — along with regional representatives from the McCune foundation community, the county government, and social service providers — discussed potential solutions to the state’s homelessness problem in the Connan Room in Carnegie Mellon’s University Center last Friday.
The forum was co-sponsored by Community Health Services and Carnegie Mellon. In addition to Fontana and Peduto, panel speakers included Laurel Shaw Randi, senior program officer at the McCune Foundation, and Pat Valentine, executive deputy director for Integrated Program Services at the Allegheny County Department of Human Services.
In a recent Allegheny County Department of Human Services survey, it was estimated that more than 2,400 men, women, and children in the county do not have a home on any given night.
The forum on Friday served as an opportunity for local representatives and officials to share the progress on Allegheny County’s 10-year plan to end homelessness.
Fontana has worked to establish a task force within the Department of Education to address homeless children’s education. Peduto has been a long-time advocate for those facing homelessness, working with Allegheny County officials to develop the 10-year plan.
Students win 'Capture the Flag' security competition
Carnegie Mellon students in engineering and computer science won the “Capture the Flag” competition, a computer security war game. Each team or individual in the game is given a machine or small network to defend an isolated network. The teams compete to find information on opponents’ machines. Scoring is based on a team’s success in defending its assigned machine attacking other teams’ machines.
On Oct. 24, Carnegie Mellon’s team won the SecuInside Capture the Flag contest in South Korea, winning $30,000. This past week, the university entered two teams in the Polytechnic Institute of New York CSAW contest and took first- and second-place, winning another $1,750.
“The SecuInside contest was an attack-defense competition, so our goal was to take a server running a set of services, fix vulnerabilities quickly, and exploit the other team’s vulnerabilities before they get theirs fixed,” said Tyler Nighswander, a senior computer science major and the team’s president, in a university press release.
In addition to Nighswander, the other members of the Carnegie Melon team include Matt Dickoff, a junior in electrical and computer engineering; Andrew Wesie and Ricky Zhou, juniors in computer science; and Brian Pak, a sophomore in computer science.

Catching Ghost Particles in Oil and Plastic: The NOvA Experiment
Monday at 3 p.m.
Allen Hall 318, University of Pittsburgh
Luke Corwin, a post-doctorate fellow at Indiana University, will present and discuss his recent research in the field of neutrinos and particle physics, emphasizing the NOvA experiment.
Corwin will discuss neutrinos in detail, as well as how he believes they are some of the most mysterious particles in the known universe. 
Neutrinos are fundamental particles that weakly interact with other particles, and as a result are sometimes referred to as ghost particles. According to Corwin, particle physicists are actively trying to solve many unknowns about neutrinos, such as which neutrino type is heaviest and how they change from one type to another.
After his preliminary discussion on neutrinos, Corwin will delve into a talk about the NOvA experiment. This experiment is one of the latest generation of neutrino detection mechanisms being built to find out more about the particles. Currently, the mechanism is under construction at Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory in northern Minnesota. It will consist of a near and far detector composed mainly of PVC extrusions and scintillating mineral oil. Corwin’s lecture will review the motivation, current status, and future plans for this experiment.
Stones for Ihula: Rural Health Care Provision in Conflict-Affected Eastern Congo
Nov. 28 at 4:30 p.m.
Porter Hall 100 (Gregg Hall)
Paul Brockmann has worked with the international medical organization Médecins Sans Frontières, or Doctors Without Borders, since 2005. In this lecture, Brockmann will discuss the daily challenges he faces while in the international medical field. His talk will also feature a Q & A session and interactive segments.
Brockmann most recently managed one of the largest medical interventions in North Kivu in the Democratic Republic of Congo. His other assignments have included a short emergency response to the 2008 Sichuan Earthquake in China, as well as longer assignments in Sri Lanka, India, Nigeria, and China.
Brockmann joined Doctors Without Borders as a non-medical administrator after a 19-year career in magazine publishing in the United States.
This lecture is sponsored by the modern languages department, the Center for International Relations and Politics, and the Office of the Vice Provost for Education.
Maya Apocalypse: 1562 or 2012?
Nov. 28 at 6 p.m.
Rangos 1, University Center
Amara Solari and Matthew Restall will discuss the ongoing debate over the Mayan doomsday prediction. Solari is an assistant professor of art history and anthropology at Penn State University, and Restall is the Edwin Erle Sparks professor of colonial Latin American history, anthropology, and women’s studies at Penn State University.
Solari and Restall will argue that the prediction has become an international industry. They hope to explore whether there actually was an ancient Mayan prophecy that the world would end in 2012, and if not, how society’s obsession with the year 2012 came about. Solari and Restall co-authored the book 2012 and the End of the World: The Western Roots of the Maya Apocalypse, which will be the basis of their lecture.

As Pittsburgh enters its winter months and the temperature starts to drop, a significant number of students are coming down with some form of cold or flu. Flu season is typically a frustrating time for students, especially during the last weeks of classes and during finals. However, it can also be deadly. Here is a quick history of last year’s flu season:
55,403: the number of people who suffered from the flu during 2010–11
115: the number of flu-related deaths in children 18 years old and younger during 2010–11
44: the number of states that reported “widespread influenza” in February 2011
5,758: the number of influenza strains that were tested for antiviral resistance during 2010

We hear “books are dead,” and we are immediately up in arms. 
Books have existed in a relatively similar format to their present form for 2,000 years. For nearly the last 600 years, they have been omnipresent, mass-produced, and easily available. Now we are told that this form is dying, and we are seeing the effects on our libraries firsthand.
The fourth-generation Kindle series of e-book readers has launched and is selling better than ever. Electronic editions of books are outselling hardcover and paperback versions, and they have been for a year. Barnes & Noble is shifting its strategy to focus on digital media. Borders, failing to do the same, has closed down. The paper and bindings that have composed our idea of the word “book” for our entire lives are becoming quickly irrelevant and leaving libraries struggling.
Our own library at Carnegie Mellon is coping with similar challenges. The last decade has seen books being shipped out of Hunt Library to an off-campus book depository. Empty shelves were removed to make space for carrels, study rooms, and a café. These changes are likely to continue.
Technology is continuing to redefine the relationship among the student, the book, and the library. Students want more space dedicated to quiet studying and group work, with electrical outlets to power their laptops as they work late into the night. Less and less often, students will go to the library with the primary goal of finding a musty book with yellow-tinged pages to read.
Recently published books will become part of the rapidly growing rare book collection and stored at a depository until they are eventually sold off or digitized. The library’s  sources of information will be databases, indexed and searchable. The challenges will be in making information-finding as rich as it once was — wandering through the stacks, easily seeing related works, finding knowledge through serendipity.
It is imperative to imagine a vision for Hunt for the next 10 years. Although the function of libraries is shifting from a space which houses collections of bound paper and ink to a technology-infused workspace, the concept of a library as a place that facilitates learning must remain intact.

New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg’s response to the Occupy Wall Street movement, an eviction of protesters from Zuccotti Park described as a “forced cleansing” by the Daily News, was enacted this past Tuesday. The park was cleared in the early morning hours and around 200 people were arrested. 
Protesters and reporters described excessive force being used by riot police to clear the area, while tents, personal items, and other property were disposed of by the police. The protesters had no chance to save this property, most notably Occupy Wall Street’s library of approximately 5,000 donated books and texts. 
If New York’s mayor thinks this will end the movement, he is sorely mistaken. Forcing the protesters out of Zuccotti Park, a 24-hour public park, only served to paint the New York City Police Department and Bloomberg as villains and to reinforce the image of Occupy protesters as underdogs. Now these protesters have yet another example that they can refer to when citing the injustices they have endured.
Incidents of excessive force by police against Occupy protesters increase sympathy for the movement and give the demonstrations an increased vitality. Occupy Oakland, known as one of the most violent Occupy movements, gained attention when Marine Corps veteran and protester Scott Olsen was hospitalized with a skull fracture caused by a police gas canister. Police in Seattle were criticized after it was reported that an 84-year-old woman and a pregnant woman were pepper sprayed while protesting. Pulitzer Prize-winning poet Robert Hass was hit by police batons multiple times while peacefully protesting at Occupy Berkeley. Passive and seated students at UC Davis were pepper sprayed by police during an Occupy demonstration. All of these incidents not only reflect poorly on the various police forces involved, but also bring more sympathy towards Occupy movements. 
We feel that the momentum Occupy Wall Street has gained will not be quelled by attempts like Bloomberg’s eviction. The movement has become a nationwide phenomenon that is, in many respects, independent of the rally that began it all. Occupy Oakland, Occupy Seattle, Occupy Berkeley, and Occupy UC Davis are prime examples of protests that have sprung from the original Occupy Wall Street movement and have  strengthened the overall cause. Although measures like park evictions might see a hundred or so protesters arrested, police brutality against Occupy protesters has incited a level of support that cannot be suppressed.

Mike Winder, the mayor of West Valley City, Utah, had a problem: His city was appearing too often in local newspapers’ crime reports and not enough in positive news stories. Concerned by his community’s perceived negative reputation, the mayor decided to do something about it.
Using a fake name, fake address, and someone else’s photo, Winder set up a Facebook profile and Gmail account last year posing as freelance writer Richard Burwash. He used the persona to have more than a dozen articles on West Valley City published in Utah print media, including some pieces in which he quoted himself as mayor under the Burwash identity. Winder wrote articles, took photos, spoke with editors, and provided documents supporting one of his articles — all as Burwash. The duplicity continued for eight months, until Winder realized that the Deseret News, a paper in which he had published three articles, had a no-pseudonym policy.
Pseudonyms aside, we were taken aback by Winder’s voluntary disregard for conflict of interest rules, the policies that prevent reporters with vested interests in a group or event from covering it in a newspaper. Avoiding conflicts of interest is a major tenet of journalism and is a key mechanism in ensuring fair, objective news coverage. We have a hard time understanding someone who would eagerly violate one of the field’s central precepts and yet be conscience-stricken by unauthorized use of a pen name.
We wonder why Winder thought it necessary to take on this added burden of deception and subterfuge when he could have simply used some of his many resources to improve news coverage. As the field of journalism continues moving away from entrenched print newspapers toward community-sourced and personal reporting, clear communication of basic journalistic ethics will be essential for maintaining an independent and honest press.
In Winder’s case, however, the mayor’s actions reveal more than a good-faith effort to give West Valley City “a fair shake” in the media, as he said last week in a Deseret News article. By creating a fake persona, Winder made it obvious that he knew his news reports would have been less likely to be published if their true source had been known. As mayor of Utah’s second most populous city, Winder had numerous methods at his disposal for promoting his town. He could have called press conferences, distributed press releases to newspapers, or started an official city blog. In the end, he got the publicity he wanted, but at the cost of undermining some of the trust placed in him.

The American Dream is an elusive concept with many different definitions. According to James Truslow Adams, writer of The Epic of America and coiner of the term “the American Dream,” it’s the notion that “life should be better and richer and fuller for everyone, with opportunity for each according to ability or achievement.”
The foundation of the American Dream is our economic freedom. Economic freedom is your right to own property, keep what you make, enter into a private contract and not have it violated, have a stable currency, and have a stable social structure that leaves you free to easily pursue any legal economic venture you wish.
In Matt Mastricova’s article, “Classes Don’t Need to Stand Divided,” he argues that “social justice” is the American way, and cites welfare programs as a method of social justice. Social justice is another elusive term, defined by Wikipedia as “the idea of creating a society or institution that is based on the principles of equality and solidarity, that understands and values human rights, and that recognizes the dignity of every human being.” It is because Mastricova and I have different definitions of social justice that we disagree on most fundamental issues of the government.
I believe that equality is equality of opportunity, not outcome. I believe that all men and women are created equal, but they don’t all end up that way. I believe that social justice is best served when people keep what they make and are economically free to pursue their own endeavors.
In this society, if you earn money fairly, then you do so by improving the quality of life for those around you. If you do that, I think you should keep what you earn except to pay (the same amount everyone else does) for essential services such as defense, both foreign and domestic, public education, and limited social welfare programs. That, to me, sounds like justice.
Mastricova regarded my idea of getting wealthy by working hard as “horribly misguided and unpatriotic,” and used examples of extreme circumstances where ill family members and college loans prevent people from obtaining the American Dream. This is true in some cases, and this is where limited social welfare programs can serve their purpose. I believe that society should be willing to help those who help themselves, but that welfare programs should not subsidize laziness.
Another alarming idea that Mastricova articulated is that wealth accumulation requires wealth to begin with. I strongly disagree. In his book, Think and Grow Rich, Napoleon Hill, the father of success theory, stated that single-mindedness of purpose is the only thing necessary for wealth accumulation. If you set a goal for yourself and are dedicated to that goal until it is the guiding force behind all action you take, I strongly believe that you will achieve your goal. Mastricova discounted the self-made men that made this country prosperous, among them Andrew Carnegie. The fact that this is possible is social justice.
It is Mastricova’s warped concept of the American Dream that bothered me the most. He articulated a kind of dream where you’re entitled to a certain lifestyle just by showing up to the game. I believe that the American Dream should be achieved and earned, not just by putting in a full nine innings, but by actually scoring runs. No one gets an A for effort at Carnegie Mellon, and that’s how it should be in the real world. Working eight hours doesn’t grant you a certain lifestyle, but it’s what you do in those eight hours that grants wealth. In this society, you earn money by improving the quality of life of those around you and our economic freedom is what ensures that your contributions get adequately rewarded.
We grew to be a land of prosperity because we left our people free to do what they wanted and keep what they earned. In a way, the U.S. mirrors the ultimate self-made man, rising to affluence on hard work, not handouts. That’s social justice. That’s the American Dream.

As the Occupy protests continue to grow across the country, the American government is once again demonstrating both its commitment to corporations’ interests and its disconnect from the average American.
The Stop Online Piracy Act (SOPA), a new bill currently being debated in Congress, could give the government the power to censor and block access to any website that hosts copyrighted information of any kind. The driving force behind this act is the entertainment industry, which believes that by blocking access to sites like thepiratebay.org or mediafire.com it can stop internet users from pirating the music, television, and movies that are the industry’s lifeblood. There are a few significant problems with this train of thought, however.
First, the industry is assuming that, by removing easy access to illegal downloading, people who would have pirated a song or movie will be forced to buy it instead. This is a truly short-sighted way of thinking. Although blocking the domain names of torrent or direct-download websites will stop infrequent downloaders from pirating files, more frequent downloaders have become used to getting their entertainment for free and are not likely to start spending money on it. Furthermore, the bill would not stop more dedicated pirates, who could access these websites via their IP addresses, the unique strings of numbers that a site’s domain name represents. Essentially, SOPA would not punish or stop those who hurt the entertainment industry the most.
Secondly, the scope of this bill goes far beyond reasonable efforts to restrict piracy and into the realm of the ludicrous. It would censor any website that hosts copyrighted content. That doesn’t just mean sites that host illegal downloads, although those would certainly be doomed. Remember that funny Doctor Who .GIF you reblogged on Tumblr? That’s all the cause this bill would need to block Tumblr’s domain name. That Harry Potter fan fiction you posted on your LiveJournal in high school? Goodbye, LiveJournal. YouTube would be shut down solely because that funny cat video you posted used “Thriller” as background music. Because most social-media and media-sharing websites assume liability for their users’ content, those sites would be forced to censor their users or face a virtual death penalty.
Finally, and possibly most importantly, SOPA would also allow the government to censor any site that offered an opinion which appeared to support piracy, as well as any site that corporations or the government felt wasn’t working hard enough to prevent piracy. This bill has taken online piracy from the realm of the intellectual property debate and made it an issue of First Amendment rights. If this act is passed, the internet as we know it will cease to exist, and a policed, Big Brother-esque web that lacks the freedom, innovation, and security of today’s will replace it. And if other countries choose to follow America’s example and pass similar bills, there is no guarantee that their versions won’t be even more restrictive or punitive.
When people complain about not being able to get on Facebook, their friends joke about “first-world problems.” The passage of SOPA will make something as inane as “Pokemon Profile Picture Month” an issue of basic free-speech rights.

The New York Times recently ran a story in which a bunch of kids whose parents went to Ivy League schools whined about not being able to get in. See, most top schools have a special deal with kids of alumni that gives them preference for admissions. The schools call these applicants “legacy” students.
The gist of the article was that even though legacy students are accepted three times as often as other students, they have more pressure from their parents to get in. People got all riled up that the article made it sound like legacy admissions made everyone equally stressed, and so The New York Times hosted an online debate in which a bunch of people offered their opinions.
The weakest arguments in my opinion were those of Richard Kahlenberg, a senior fellow at the Century Foundation, and John Brittain, a law professor of the University of the District of Columbia School of Law, who argued that legacy admissions are racist. Kahlenberg claimed that they’re effectively affirmative action for the rich. If that sounds like an oxymoron, it does to him, too. Schools shouldn’t be allowed to give people help who don’t need it, he said. And Brittain said that legacy admissions just perpetuate racial inequalities in college. Legacy admissions make schools remain as they have been, which means primarily white.
A better argument came from higher education administrators Terry Shepard and Debra Thomas, who asserted that legacy admissions aren’t any different than preferences given to in-state students. And college consultant Michelle Hernandez pointed out that bending the rules for student athletes is another kind of exception, and that’s one where the students are often far less academically accomplished than the average admit.
There’s also the monetary aspect. Peter Sacks, author of Tearing Down the Gates: Confronting the Class Divide in American Education, emphasizes that alumni give a lot of money. You might as well let them buy their way in if they want. Stephen Trachtenberg, the University Professor of Public Service and former president  at George Washington University, offered the courtesy blue-blood opinion. He argued for legacy admissions with the motive that legacy students remind the school of the noble and dignified people who founded it.
All of these arguments had some good points, but here’s where they go wrong. Each of these arguments cannot be addressed without first recognizing a problem in public awareness: an awareness that legacy admissions exist. Legacy admissions feel dishonest to the public, and they’re handled shadily by school administrations.
You want a real debate about legacy admissions? Tell people they exist. It’s easy to do. Put a little paragraph right at the top when you click on the “Admissions” tab. (I’m going to make these numbers up by the way. I would fill in the correct ones, but schools won’t reveal them.) “We receive about 15,000 applications per year. We accept 1,400 of those applicants. We also offer admission to roughly 200 legacy students and 100 student athletes.”
Oh, would that cause a nationwide murmur of discontent? Sorry, I was just trying to bring a little disclosure to the situation.
I think private schools should be able to do whatever they want. It’s their prerogative. And if arguments like the ones in The New York Times forum can appease the public, then all the better. But let’s have a little forthrightness so schools are publicly responsible for their own policies. If you can’t take the heat, get out of the kitchen.

President Barack Obama announced on Oct. 25 that, beginning Jan. 1, students would no longer be required to pay more than 10 percent of their discretionary income toward student loan debt, with remaining balances forgiven after 20 years. Considering that the amount of student loan debt has reached $950 billion, according to Bloomberg L.P., overtaking the amount of credit card debt in the country, this is a commendable first step toward solving the student debt crisis. However, it is only that: a first step.
While this plan might help to mildly alleviate the stress of student debt, it merely addresses a symptom of the problem. Instead of trying to decrease the burden of debt that tuition places on students, why aren’t we questioning why tuition has gotten this high in the first place?
Since 1982, the cost of medical care in the United States has gone up over 200 percent. By comparison, the cost of college tuition has gone up by more than 400 percent, far outstripping the rises in inflation. These tuition raises have resulted in an average student debt of $29,000, with two-thirds of the Class of 2010 graduating with this debt.
Part of the reason so many students have been taking on loans is because they have been told their whole lives that a college degree is necessary to succeed — which is, to some extent, still true. College graduates earn about $20,000 a year more than people with only high school degrees.
If a college degree is now so central to the functioning of our economy, though, why are students forced to take on so much debt in order to try and get ahead? In the long run, this dependence on student loans is crippling the country’s future; merely decreasing the necessary payments on loans only puts a Band-Aid on a dam, and just defers that debt onto taxpayers.
College degrees have now become an expected public service, much like primary education. If we as a society are willing to accept the costs of K-12 education as necessary to the functioning of our economy, we should also be more willing to take on some of the costs of college education. Many European countries like England and Belgium already do this, with either no tuition or a negligible amount of tuition costs for a college education.
At the very least, the costs of public college educations should be drastically reduced. As they are now, many public universities’ tuition rates are not much better than private. The University of Pittsburgh’s lowest in-state tuition rate is $14,838, and University of Virginia’s in-state tuition is $11,794 — and that doesn’t even take room and board or books into account. 
It seems ridiculous that government-funded universities force their students to take on debt in order to keep the economy going. If public universities were to lower their tuition costs, private universities would also be forced to lower their tuition costs — or, at the very least, consider removing loans from their financial aid packages — in order to compete.
As I said, Obama’s student loan plan is a commendable first step toward reducing the burden on students. However, if we as a country hope to sustain our future as an educated society, we need to do more to support the students on whom our future relies.

Let this be your first warning that finals are near. Take this week to collect yourself so you can finish strong come next Monday.
Whatever you do, don’t eat any of your mom’s food when you go home for Thanksgiving. Doing so will cause the remainder of your semester’s dining experiences to be rather unpleasant.
Say it with me: This semester is almost over, this semester is almost over, this semester is almost over.
Pause for a few minutes this week to think of all the good things that your professors have brought into your life. Then go back to cursing their existence.
For the past week, you have been living in a fantasy world in which deadlines and responsibilities do not exist. Enjoy this magical land while you can, but be prepared to face reality.
As a Carnegie Mellon student, you are a beast when it comes to Black Friday shopping. Not only are you able to stay up till the wee hours of the morning, but you are also able to deal with high levels of buyer’s remorse.
This will be your first time back home in what feels like ages. Don’t be surprised when you find that the world you left behind has changed dramatically. You never know, though: the change may be a good thing.
What are you waiting for? Turn in your graduate school applications already! 
Spoil yourself this week. Indulge in all the things you don’t allow yourself to do normally and feel no qualms about it. Those who criticize are just jealous.
Something good is coming your way. I can feel it. Or rather, I deeply wish this to be true for you.
It’s never too early for Christmas music. So while everyone else is focused on Tom Turkey, you should be gearing up to play lots of great Christmas music. Remember, nothing makes studying better than “Jingle Bells”
There are so many things to be thankful for, but right now it seems rather difficult to see the good in your life. Things may be hard right now, but you’ll get through it. You will be okay.
