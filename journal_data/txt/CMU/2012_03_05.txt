First-year middle-distance runner Erin Kiekhaefer has had a strong start on the women’s track and field team.
Originally from Palo Alto, Calif., Kiekhaefer only started running in high school and did not think she could run in college. “I had played soccer for a long time but realized that I didn’t want to play it at my high school because they were too competitive, so I started running my freshman-year cross country season and decided that I wanted to focus more on running,” Kiekhaefer said. “Once I found out that I was accepted to CMU, I contacted Coach [Dario] Donatelli and trained over the summer to be able to run.”
Kiekhaefer has enjoyed her time on the track and field team so far. “There is such a great group of freshman girls on the team,” she said. “Long runs just turn into conversations, and sometimes we just break into fits of giggles, which makes those hour-plus runs so much better.”
Teammate Lisa Rising, a junior, lauded Kiekhaefer’s “wonderful attitude” as part of the team. “Her contagious positivity brings out the best in her teammates and our workouts,” Rising said.
Even though the team is smaller than in past years, Kiekhaefer has high hopes for the group. “So far everyone has been performing really well, and we’ve put a lot of new times on the top-five performances list, which is really impressive,” she said. 
Kiekhaefer said her proudest moment on the team occurred earlier in the indoor season, when she ran her first mile in 5:27, beating her high school performance by 20 seconds. “I was just so excited and impressed that I was able to run a time like that,” she said. “I hadn’t ever thought that I would be able to do that!”
Kiekhaefer’s strong performances this year did not come as a surprise to sophomore teammate Jackie Guevel. “Erin is at practice every day, working hard.... She makes sure to run the times Coach asks of her,” Guevel said. “Her dedication to the team has clearly paid off through her continued success in the mile.”
Overall, Kiekhaefer finds being on the track and field team very rewarding. “I think the most rewarding aspect about being on the team is just meeting so many different people that I never would have met without the team. People are all different years and majors, and some amazing people that I never would have crossed paths with have become some of my really good friends, which makes the team such an important part of my college life,” she said.
A Science and Humanities Scholar, Kiekhaefer is not entirely sure what she wants to major in. Currently, she is considering psychology and Hispanic studies. “I know that I want to keep running and traveling. I probably want to do something with a nonprofit in a Latin American 
country,” she said of her future plans.

On Friday, Feb. 23, Milwaukee Brewers left fielder Ryan Braun entered the Major League Baseball history books. The reigning National League (NL) MVP is bound to find his name on all-time lists when his career is over; however, his most recent feat is not one he will likely boast about.
Braun, who was recently charged with taking performance-enhancing drugs (PEDs) and was facing a 50-game suspension, won his appeal to the MLB. Braun is the first player to win an appeal of alleged PED use.
After the successful appeal of the drug test, Braun held a press conference at which he gave thanks to teammates, other players, and the Brewers’ coaching staff. He then laid out the story of his failed drug test, hitting each point of his defense in chronological order.
Braun explained how his chaperone, Dino Laurenzi Jr., failed to mail his urine sample to the MLB laboratory the day it was provided and waited two days to send it, despite the numerous FedEx centers that were open. He also argued how the drug test results were suspect, given that the test showed three times more PED content than any other test that has ever been conducted in the MLB, suggesting that the test was inaccurate. He even mentioned all of his previously passed tests and the respect he has for his work.
Frankly, I believe him. He does not look like an abuser of PEDs. His biceps are not bulging out of his jersey, his head has not grown in Barry Bonds fashion, and his forehead isn’t covered in acne — all common symptoms of steroid users.
The numbers he put up last season, while impressive and NL MVP-worthy, were not so gaudy as to question what he put in his body. Thirty-three home runs does not scream steroid user like retired St. Louis Cardinals first baseman Mark McGwire’s 70 home runs in 1998. With all of the media surrounding PEDs in MLB and the recent charges against Oakland Athletics designated hitter Manny Ramirez, Braun would be stupid to abuse banned drugs, especially given the success he already had as a ballplayer.
“As players, we are held to a standard of 100 percent perfection regarding the program, and everyone else associated with that program should be held to the same standard,” Braun said at his press conference. “We are a part of a process where you are 100 percent guilty until proven innocent.”
Although he won, Braun has lost face with baseball’s fans in the grand scheme of things. His name will forever be linked to steroids, even though his appeal was granted. His name is tarnished, even though he may not have taken a single PED. “My name has been dragged through the mud,” he said.
He is absolutely right, and that mud will stick for a long time. The healing process will be lengthy. The Brewers won, but Braun’s victory comes with baggage. His image is tainted by skepticism, as we will never truly know his innocence or guilt in this matter.

The Pittsburgh Steelers cut the cord last Wednesday with the smile that lit up Heinz Field for 14 seasons. Wide receiver Hines Ward will not be wearing black and gold next season.
Steelers president Art Rooney II wrote in a statement that the Steelers plan to release Ward from his contract. There were reportedly no talks between Ward and Rooney about Ward taking a pay cut to stay in Pittsburgh. Ward was due to earn $4 million next season.
Ward won two Super Bowls with the Steelers, was the Super Bowl MVP in 2006, and was selected to four Pro Bowls. After setting all-time team records in receptions, receiving yards, and receiving touchdowns, Ward will leave Pittsburgh as the Steelers’ greatest wide receiver.
But the time has come for Ward to hang up his cleats. Rooney made the right call. Ward’s production is down, with most of his numbers at their lowest since his rookie season. To pay $4 million for that would be preposterous. With Rooney’s plan to adopt a more blue-collar, running-style offense, it is not surprising that the Steelers opened up salary cap space by releasing Ward.
In a statement, Ward said he was looking forward to playing in the NFL again this upcoming season. But this should be the end of the road for Ward; it is time to call it quits. He needs to retire as a Steeler instead of pulling a Brett Favre and playing outside the city that made him an icon.
Playing a final season of low-production football for another team might invoke a  dismissive attitude from analysts and fans. After a season where Ward put up just 46 receptions for 381 yards and a measly two touchdowns, he wants to come back and play another season. Does he want to go out with even more of a whimper than he already would be?
He could go to the Arizona Cardinals or the Jacksonville Jaguars, which are both looking to pick up a wide receiver. But I don’t think he can produce as an NFL wide receiver anymore.
“This isn’t how I wanted this chapter of my career to end,” Ward said.  He needs to realize that he can’t end it any better than this.

The Carnegie Mellon track and field team completed its indoor season with the University Athletic Association (UAA) Indoor Championships hosted by New York University. The event was held at NYU Feb. 25–26.
The men finished the conference tied for second place; the women’s team finished sixth.
“We’re having a great season,” said junior Benjamin Nealy. “The young guys are far exceeding initial expectations, and the seasoned veterans are providing great leadership, which will translate to great things for the rest of the indoor and outdoor season.”
One of the most notable performances at UAAs was from first-year Thomas Vandenberg, who set a school record of 1:53.71 in the 800-meter race. Vandenberg has been running hot all season, starting with the first meet of the season in Marietta, Ohio, where he won the 800-meter race with a time of 1:59.52.
Vandenberg cut over two seconds off his time a week later, although he finished in second place. In the finals at NYU, Vandenberg was beat for the 800-meter title by sophomore teammate Mike Standish, who took first with a time of 1:57.21; Vandenberg took fourth place with a time of 1:57.66.
Senior Rob Morhard has also been performing consistently well. He started his season off strong with a first-place finish in the 3,000-meter run with a time of 9:04.70. Morhard has also been performing well in relays. While teamed with Nealy, first-year Douglas O’Connell, and Standish, the team won the 4x800-meter relay at the season’s second meet in Edinboro, Pa. This past weekend, Morhard recorded a season-best mile with a time of 4:22.14.
Junior Noel Titus ended the season with a fifth-place finish in the 200-meter dash (23.10 seconds) and a sixth-place finish in the 60-meter dash (7.26 seconds).
On the women’s team, sophomore Jackie Guevel had a first-place finish at Kent State University last month in the 300-meter hurdles, recording a time of 45.96 seconds. Earlier this season at the Bucknell Winter Classic, Guevel broke two school records in the 60-meter hurdles and dash with times of 8.85 seconds and 7.92 seconds, respectively. Guevel wrapped up her season by breaking yet another a school record in the 60-meter hurdles with a time of 8.77 seconds. She also achieved All-UAA honors in the 60-meter dash with a time of 7.94 seconds.
Junior distance runner Emily Wobb also started with a win, finishing first in the 5,000-meter run with a time of 17:44.24 in Marietta, Ohio. The time placed Wobb at No. 5 in the nation for the 5,000-meter run.
First-year Erin Kiekhaefer started her season strong by winning the 800-meter race at Marietta. She continued the season at the Bucknell Winter Classic and turned in a mile run with a season-best time of 5:15.47.
The Tartans have seen impressive performances in field events as well. Senior Ivana Moses had two second-place finishes at the Case Western Reserve University dual meet in early February. Moses’ first victory came in the long jump, with a distance of 5.09 meters, and then with a jump of 10.75 meters in the triple jump. Moses improved both of those distances at the Bucknell Winter Classic, recording her season-best long jump of 5.12 meters and a triple jump of 5.12 meters. Moses finished her season with All-UAA third team honors in the triple jump with a distance of 11.02 meters, which was a season best.
With the indoor track and field season over, both the men’s and the women’s teams are awaiting outdoor competition, which begins with a meet March 24–25 at Washington & Lee University. “Indoors is considered to be a stepping stone in our preparation for outdoor season, where we can excel,” said junior Carissa Iannone.

Using a program with a personalized user interface that tracks movement wirelessly and gives a score with feedback may soon become a reality for physical therapy patients. This isn’t the newest Wii game, however. Instead, it’s the work of researchers from Carnegie Mellon and the University of Pittsburgh helping patients with knee osteoarthritis.
Osteoarthritis (OA) is a disease that affects millions of people, especially among older generations. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, nearly one in two people will develop some form of OA in their lifetimes. 
Portia Taylor, a Ph.D. student in the department of biomedical engineering, is leading the research for a digital “exercise coach” designed to help patients with OA maximize their physical therapy exercises and avoid injury. She presented her research at the 2012 International Consumer Electronics Show.
According to Taylor, there is a definite need for the “exercise coach.”
“A majority of patients are just sent home with paper instructions and pictures, and they self-report back to the therapist,” she said. This can lead to patients performing exercises wrong and physical therapists questioning the validity of their patients’ reports.
To use the digital “exercise coach,” the patient straps on a soft, brace-like pad to their knee and completes his or her exercises as normal. The sensors in the padding have accelerometers and gyroscopes that track the patient’s movement. The sensors then wirelessly connect to the computer and give feedback to the patient regarding how accurately the exercises were performed.
To give accurate feedback, the computer refers to stored information on how to correctly perform an exercise and how to fix incorrect procedures. The computer gives specific instructions to the patients immediately after they complete the exercise.
“It will say something like, you need to keep your torso forward; you’re at a 45-degree angle, you need to be at 60,” Taylor said.
To make it all work, Taylor needed the help of a University of Pittsburgh Ph.D. student in physical therapy, Gustavo Almeida, who watched video after video of people doing exercises and documented the mistakes they were making. 
“From that, we get this big set of errors that we’re looking for, and the idea is to train the system to detect those errors,” Taylor said. Almeida then helped Taylor implement suggestions that the “exercise coach” would make to help the patient improve. 
Although Taylor and Almeida were able to program the system with solutions to common exercise mistakes, it was impossible to record every way a patient could perform the exercise incorrectly. To solve this problem, Taylor implemented machine learning. With this programming, the machine is able to learn the different ways to solve an incorrect exercise as it is in use.
“If a new error comes in that is slightly different than all the rest it’s seen ... it knows how to correct it,” Taylor said. “The system says, ‘OK, I’ll correct this and make note of the what the error was,’ so this becomes error number 156 or whatever.”
In addition to giving feedback, the computer has a database that stores all of the information from the patient’s exercises. Physical therapists can access this information at any time, allowing them to keep track of their patients even after they’ve left the hospital. The program can also monitor declines in exercise performance and send notifications to physical therapists.
There is currently nothing like the digital “exercise coach” available in America. Although there are recreational games that use similar sensors, Taylor said that there is no such system that aids in physical therapy exercises.
“I can play my Xbox Kinect and then stop after three weeks, and presumably nothing would happen to me. But [my motion] doesn’t depend on it,” Taylor said. Furthermore, the “exercise coach” is aimed to be more precise in movement tracking and feedback than typical games.
The product isn’t available for use yet, as it is still in the testing phases. However, Taylor has plans to create a start-up that would serve to aid testing and get the product into the marketplace. She hopes to have the product available within five years. To many patients, the product may be a big help in their exercises.
For Taylor, the research also has a personal element.
“It’ll help a lot of people. I played soccer and danced all my life, so I’m predisposed to OA,” Taylor said. “It’s really fun developing something that I’m going to probably need, my family will probably need, my friends will probably need. It’s just ... far reaching.”

In the past 10 years, eight computer-animated films have been deemed Best Animated Feature at the Academy Awards, according to the Academy Awards Database. Computer animation has become more realistic in the past decade, and some of the work contributing to those advances has been done here at Carnegie Mellon.
“I am interested in the small motions of the face that can add a high degree of realism and improve the quality of animations,” said Laura Trutoiu, a fourth-year Ph.D. student in the Robotics Institute. Her research focuses on computer graphics with an emphasis on facial animation. Her goal is to model the subtle facial movements that bring to life animated characters.
Trutoiu’s research is interdisciplinary, and thus calls for collaboration from multiple fields. Her Ph.D. adviser, Jessica Hodgins, is a professor in the Robotics Institute and the department of computer science. Trutoiu also collaborates with Jeffrey Cohn, a professor of psychology at the University of Pittsburgh, and Iain Matthews, a senior research scientist at Disney Research Pittsburgh.
Trutoiu holds a bachelor of arts in computer science from Mount Holyoke College in Massachusetts. She started conducting research in a virtual reality lab at Mount Holyoke. “That’s when I got hooked on research,” she said. 
Movement has always been a common theme in Trutoiu’s research. As an undergraduate summer intern at the University of Utah, she researched the illusion of self-motion: How to induce the feeling of movement in a person who is in a driving simulator.
At Carnegie Mellon, Trutoiu started looking at how Parkinson’s disease patients moved with or without their deep brain stimulators turned on. These neurostimulators are devices implanted in the patients’ brains that control tremors. Trutoiu measured the patients’ movements, such as how much the spine swayed when the patients were walking, to quantify the improvements that the brain stimulator provided.
Later, Trutoiu’s research shifted to focus on the generation of facial animations.
Trutoiu explained that the process of creating a computer-animated movie, such as Toy Story, has a few steps. First, a sketch artist draws snapshots of the main scenes in the movie. The characters are then modeled in a computer using three-dimensional representations. Textures and lighting are applied to the images, adding realism to the surfaces.
Then the animators come in. Trutoiu works with the animators, using her research to complement their work. She uses videos and images of humans to track and measure facial movements. She is then able to generate robust algorithms that predict how different parts in the face should be moving.
“When we see a computer-generated animation, we as humans can pick up immediately if something is wrong,” Trutoiu said, emphasizing the importance of accurately modeling facial expressions.
Currently, Trutoiu studies the movements associated with smiling. 
“My categorization is between spontaneous and non-spontaneous smiles,” she said. A spontaneous smile is triggered automatically, while a posed smile has a grin-like appearance. 
Whether a smile is perceived as genuine depends on how fast the corners of the lips move up, how long the smile is kept at the maximum amplitude, and how fast it is released.
Trutoiu uses data obtained from high-resolution videos of moving faces. These videos show 250 frames per second and appear in slow motion, as opposed to a normal video, which has 30 to 60 frames per second. Appearance models then look at the face as a whole, check for localized video information, and observe shape and appearance changes, all the while taking copious measurements over time.
“Over time, the computer builds a shape model and an appearance model,” Trutoiu said. “It uses those to figure out what is the expected position for that corner of the lip in the next frame.”
The proper facial expressions are generated by the right position, velocity, and acceleration of specific  points on the face, producing a more realistic animation.
“The final goal of this research is to be able to tell animators or artists, when you have a sequence of someone smiling, this is how the cheeks should be raised, how the lips should actually stretch,” Trutoiu said.

The much-dreaded hangover, which usually follows heavy alcohol consumption and yields nausea or dizziness, is referred to in various parts of the world as “carpenter in forehead,” “made of rubber,” or “hair ache,” according to The Independent News. Although the possibility of a hangover doesn’t usually stop people from going out and enjoying themselves when alcohol is involved, most drinkers probably wouldn’t complain if someone were to come up with a hangover cure.
However, the chances of a cure being invented soon are slim. There are several ethical issues involved in testing any such cure on humans, which makes it very hard for anyone to come up with a hangover-curing drug. For now, the best way to suffer less from hangovers is to learn more about them.
One way to lessen the impact of a hangover is to drink less, especially if you are more susceptible to them. According to IMPACT Magazine, women usually fall into this category because they produce glutathione, the enzyme responsible for clearing the body of alcohol’s toxins, in lesser quantities and more slowly than men do. Women also tend to weigh less and have more body fat than men, which means more alcohol gets into their bloodstream in a shorter amount of time.
The Mayo Clinic, a medical practice and research group focused on specialized health care, says that people with a family history of alcoholism, or those who drink while they are hungry or sleep deprived, are more strongly affected by alcohol than others. In addition, people who do not regularly consume large amounts of alcohol tend to be more susceptible to its effects.
But what is it about alcohol that leads to hangovers? It turns out that alcohol acts in several ways to create discomfort in the human body.
Headaches from hangovers are usually the result of dehydration. Alcohol dehydrates the body by causing it to produce more urine — in fact, alcohol can cause the body to lose nearly four times the volume of liquids it gains by consuming alcohol. This dehydration is responsible for the dry mouth that is one of the classic symptoms of a hangover. In addition, the brain shrinks slightly due to the lack of hydration, causing headaches.
Alcohol also adds toxins to the body that can build up and cause headaches, even vomiting. Certain kinds of alcohols, usually those darker in color, contain compounds called congeners used to add color and flavor. Unfortunately, these compounds are also known to cause severe hangovers.
The fatigue associated with a hangover is a direct result of alcohol confusing the body’s internal clock. Alcohol makes people feel sleepy by changing the levels of the chemicals in their bodies that are responsible for keeping them alert. The body overcompensates when alcohol leaves it, and produces more stimulants than necessary, leading to poor sleeping patterns and ultimately fatigue.
The human body may undergo withdrawal when the effects of alcohol start to wear off, causing people to feel shaky or dizzy from hangovers. Many people also like to mix their alcohol with sugary drinks, which only makes the withdrawal effect worse as the body comes off its sugar high at the same time the alcohol starts to wear off.
Some people like to consume alcohol while also consuming other drugs, such as nicotine. This can cause the alcohol to act in a more potent way and usually results in the drinker suffering a more severe hangover. Alcohol can also irritate the stomach lining; this can lead to nausea and pain.
Many urban legends exist about foods (like bacon sandwiches) that can eliminate all hangover symptoms, but only a few methods are recommended by experts as surefire ways to lessen their severity. Not consuming alcohol on an empty stomach, staying hydrated, taking multivitamins, and getting enough rest are all ways to make the morning after a night of heavy drinking more bearable.

Artificial womb lets scientists observe embryonic growth
A team of researchers at the University of Nottingham in the United Kingdom have created a new device made from soft polymers that mimics the mammalian uterus. With this technology, researchers are now able to continuously observe the growth of embryonic cells outside of the womb through to the eighth day of development, a huge improvement from the previous four-day limit that forced scientists to return these cells back to the mother’s womb. 
Because of this technology, scientists are able to directly observe the continuing changes in embryos after four days, including the crucial formation of the head. This breakthrough is part of a larger effort at the university to learn how the development of the human embryo can teach researchers methods for repairing the human body.

Memory chip uses light, not electricity, to store data
Researchers at a Japanese telecom company have built an optical random access memory (o-RAM) chip that uses light, rather than electricity, to store data. Each memory cell in the o-RAM is a nanoscale light-capturing crystal capable of channeling light in very small spaces. Varying the intensity of light through the chip allows each crystal to switch between transparent and opaque states, modeling zeroes and ones. 
While the technology is still a ways off from use in conventional desktop machines, researchers are hoping that it can help speed up the sluggish performance of internet switches that manage traffic between high-volume servers, since light travels much faster than electric signals.

NASA falls victim to numerous cyber-attacks
NASA was the victim of 47 sophisticated cyber-attacks in 2011, according to a report the agency released last week. These attacks have allowed hackers to gain unauthorized access to employee credentials, the control systems of NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory, and the security codes used to operate the International Space Station, among other things. In total, the agency reported 5,408 incidents that “resulted in the installation of malicious software on or unauthorized access to its systems” in both 2010 and 2011. 
These developments come at an unfortunate time for NASA, as Americans continue to assess the roles the expensive agency should or should not play in future explorations of the final frontier.

Despite mid-age slump, elderly people sleep best
A telephone survey of more than 150,000 adults suggested that, aside from a slight decline during a person’s 40s, sleep quality on the whole actually gets better with age. The study, conducted by researchers at the University of Pennsylvania’s Center for Sleep and Circadian Neurobiology, focused on asking a large sample of randomly selected people questions about the quality of their sleep. Since these responses were mostly the opinions of the participants involved, researcher Michael Grandner offered a possible explanation for the data.
“Even if sleep among older Americans is actually worse than in younger adults, feelings about [sleep quality] still improve with age,” he said.

Jurassic fleas eight times larger than modern fleas
A fossil of a prehistoric flea from the Jurassic era was recently uncovered in China. At 20.6 millimeters (nearly one inch), the 165-million-year-old flea was eight times bigger than the modern flea, and still manages to dwarf even the largest living flea, which comes in at only 12.6 millimeters. These prehistoric fleas also had vicious, straw-like mouths with serrated edges — perfect for biting into the hides of the dinosaurs they lived on. 
“It really appears as though they were specialized for working their way into some heavy hides, such as those on dinasaurs,” Michael Engel, a co-author of the study, said in an interview with New Scientist. Unlike modern fleas, however, the prehistoric flea had poorly developed legs, and thus was incapable of jumping.

Space tourism company tests new spaceship
Virgin Galactic, a space tourism company under the Virgin Group corporation, is aiming to test fly its new SpaceShipTwo spacecraft this year. Commercial suborbital passenger service will give riders a few minutes, at an altitude of about 68 miles, to experience zero gravity and view the Earth set against the backdrop of outer space. The service could commence as soon as next year, company officials said last week. Nearly 500 customers have signed up for these $200,000 rides in the six-passenger, two-pilot ship. 
“We would like to be the first to do this, but we’re not in a race with anyone,” chief test pilot David Mackay said. “This is not a Cold War-era space race.”

The Center for PostNatural History is a distinct crossbreed between a museum and an art gallery. Friday marked the grand opening of its permanent exhibition facility, located at 4913 Penn Ave. Richard Pell, a Carnegie Mellon professor of art and director of the Center for PostNatural History, is the founder of this space.
The term “post-natural” refers to genetically altered living organisms. According to the center’s website, its intent is to “acquire, interpret and provide access to a collection of living, preserved and documented organisms of post-natural origin.” The exhibit allows access to a wealth of knowledge about the relationships among culture, nature, and biotechnology.
Upon entering, visitors are guided under a dark arch into a dimly lit room with ambient noises quietly adding to the atmosphere. Large, bookcase-like structures tower next to the entrance. Nestled in these dark, wooden barriers are glass windows that provide a glimpse of tiny, intricate dioramas created by Craig Tompkins, an artist based in Santa Fe, New Mexico. These dioramas represent different environments that harbor genetically altered species, such as a military goat farm generating “biosteel goats.”
The glass windows also contain a fish tank of Glofish, or zebra fish, a transgenic organism. Edward Wojciechowski III, a first-year linguistics major, said, “I thought it was interesting that they had live organisms. Like, I definitely had those fish as a kid. It was all very familiar.”
Other sections of the exhibit display more of these cases, each with a specimen and a phone that viewers can pick up in order to learn the history of the modified organism. These cases include a variety of samples, including sea monkeys and the testicles of a castrated domestic cat. The specimens featured in the exhibit are all donations.
A larger portion of the exhibit has a wall dedicated to the Dugway Proving Ground, the largest biological weapons testing site in the United States. The location is illustrated by an eerie landscape photograph of the Utah Granite Peak Installation, accompanied by an aerial view of the land. A pulsating circular projection of the ground inhabits the wall next to the pictures. “For quite a lot of bacterial pathogens, this is their one sort of habitat that exists outside the lab,” Pell explained, when asked why the projection was there.
The idea for the exhibit goes back as far as 2005, though the development of the physical space started just a year ago. Pell originally began working with engineers in the field of synthetic biology. Though the museum displays a number of preserved life forms, Pell was never particularly interested in the creation of these displays as an art form.
“The realization that I came to was that the things that were already happening in labs were far more provocative than anything I could come up with,” he said. “What was necessary was a space of documentation and contemplation.”
He worked to transform the center into a neutral space that would allow for serious contemplation, which is no easy task when working with a controversial subject. The goals of the gallery are to challenge the assumptions of viewers and to allow them to reach their own conclusions, without having to decide whether or not they agree with any particular opinion. Pell said, “We specifically try to avoid using the language of the industry, or academia even.”
Pell revealed that the most difficult part of creating a permanent home for the center was simply the architecture of the space. He worked with numerous people to transform one large room into a series of intimate spaces that all flow in and out of each other.
Though the area is decidedly neutral, there is undoubtedly a hint of morbidity that arises from the lighting, audio, and concepts of the exhibit. The blunt exposition of the genetic modification that transpires in America is enough to give any viewer an uneasy feeling. The Center for PostNatural History lets viewers in on something that feels secretive, even though all of the information displayed is available to the general public.

There are few things in life more delicate than wildflower blossoms and the soft splashes of watercolor on vellum.
Native Pennsylvania, A Wildflower Walk, the newest exhibit at the Hunt Institute for Botanical Documentation, pairs the two wonders together to celebrate the historical intersection between the sciences and art in the world of botany.
A collaborative exhibition between the Hunt Institute and the Carnegie Museum of Natural History’s botany department, Native Pennsylvania, A Wildflower Walk presents visitors with a painstakingly collected selection of plants and watercolors. The exhibition features the pairing of 36 watercolors by Richard Crist (CIT ’28) from the Hunt Institute’s collection with a significant selection of the Carnegie Museum of Natural History’s herbarium specimens.
In addition to Crist’s watercolors and the botany department’s herbarium selections, the exhibit also features watercolors by painter Lyn Hayden and entomologist and painter Andrey Avinoff, which underscore the importance of herbaria in botanical research, education, and conservation.
The concept behind the exhibit is to create a visual wildflower walk through Pennsylvania’s blooming seasons. A special emphasis is placed on endangered and rare species. Given Pittsburgh’s historically gray winters, visitors will surely welcome this early celebration of nature’s ephemeral splashes of color.
At Carnegie Mellon, an environment in which most undergraduate students have a hard time taking a break, let alone going outside, Native Pennsylvania, A Wildflower Walk provides a convenient look at the delicate unfolding of Pennsylvania’s natural world. Located in the often-overlooked Hunt Institute, on the fifth floor of Hunt Library, the exhibit provides a quiet space for serene contemplation. The unfolding of the seasons lends the exhibit a gentle, logical progression that is sure to please those in need of a respite.
In the exhibit, visitors can explore the intersection between the arts and natural sciences by viewing the juxtaposition of botanists’ tools and artists’ documentation on display. For those uninitiated in the traditional practices of botanical collection, the exhibit thoroughly describes common tools and their uses.
The inclusion of Crist’s work alongside the herbarium selections provides a new perspective on the artist, given that historians remember Crist primarily as an abstract painter. Native Pennsylvania, A Wildflower Walk adds another dimension to the public’s understanding of his work as an artist.
Along with his painting and printmaking, Crist was also an amateur botanist, author, and book illustrator. He wrote and illustrated several children’s books, including The Mystery of Broken Horse Chimneys, published in 1960 with his wife, Eda Szecskay Crist. He also provided hundreds of watercolor illustrations for the “Herbs” and “Vegetables and Fruits” volumes of The Time-Life Encyclopedia of Gardening in 1977. His work is in the collections of the Carnegie Library in Pittsburgh.
For those interested in expanding their knowledge of the botanical world, The Hunt Institute for Documentation will be holding lectures through mid-June that will focus on Pennsylvania’s native plants.
Native Pennsylvania, A Wildflower Walk will be on display through June 29 on the fifth floor of Hunt Library. Hours: Monday-Friday, 9 a.m.-noon and 1-5 p.m.; Sunday, 1-4 p.m. (except March 11; April 6-8; and May 6, 27, and 28)

Unblurred: First Fridays on Penn is a monthly showcase of visual and performance arts in the Penn Avenue Arts District (4800–5500 Penn Ave.). Like the Cultural Trust’s quarterly Gallery Crawl in Downtown, most Unblurred events are free and all are open to the public, with over two dozen locations to choose from.
A poetry reading at Voluto Coffee on Penn Avenue was the first stop of the night. The reading was hosted by Terrance Hayes, a National Book Award winner and Carnegie Mellon creative writing professor. Originally concerned about reading for two hours straight, Hayes opted to pull his creative writing class into the event and open up the readings to the general public. Volunteers were asked to sign up the hour before the reading, and were called forward as the night progressed. Other visitors, who came in from the rain, were entranced by the atmosphere and presentation and almost always stayed for multiple pieces. Every seat was taken, including the extra ones lining the room. 
“The changing readers was particularly nice,” said sophomore chemistry major Sarah Horner, a student in one of Hayes’ classes. “It kept the pacing and style different throughout the night and that was better than hearing the same person reading the entire time.” Horner read two personal pieces as well as one she had heard from a YouTube slam poetry video. “I came out of it feeling very inspired,” she said. 
In addition to the poetry reading, Assemble, a community arts and technology gallery, was hosting an exhibit called [ITAL]Open Studio[ITAL], by artist Seth Clark. Open Studio is a highly interactive exhibit that makes viewers participants in the artistic process, whether by creating a mark of their own, drawing a line representation of their height, or letting out pent-up aggression by stabbing a fork into a piece of cardboard in the wall. According to Assemble’s website, “The general public seldom has the opportunity to engage with the artist-at-work because studios are often shut off to them.” The exhibit runs through March.
Unblurred, and similar events like the Gallery Crawl, are organized to encourage the community to get involved in the arts. Many of the attendees of Friday’s Unblurred, however, were art students or were otherwise related to the event. Unblurred is hosted by the Penn Avenue Arts Initiative (PAAI). The PAAI was created in 1998 in collaboration with the Bloomfield Garfield Corporation in response to the lack of development in the area. With the help of generous funding from both local and national sources, the PAAI has been moving the avenue toward being, in its own words, “artsy-er,” “green-er,” “busi-er,” “tasty-er,” “homey-er,” and “clean-er.”
The next Unblurred art walk will take place on Friday, April 6.

Featuring a world-class guest soloist, the Pittsburgh Symphony Orchestra (PSO)’s program added another success to the list of excellent performances in its 2011–12 season last Friday night. With Juilliard-educated and world-renowned pianist Emanuel Ax featured in the program, the orchestra once again showed its ability to bring in high-profile soloists while demonstrating its own musical prowess.
The concert was held at Heinz Hall, which is currently celebrating 40 years as host to the PSO. In the lobby, young musicians greeted guests who arrived early with classical favorites like French composer Claude Debussy’s “Clair de Lune.” Meanwhile, in the concert hall, orchestra members trickled onstage and began to warm up. Once the hall had filled, celebrated violinist and guest conductor Nikolaj Znaider got the program underway.
Dynamics were key in the first piece of the program, German composer Richard Wagner’s “Prelude und Liebestod” from the opera Tristan und Isolde; the orchestra did an excellent job of bringing them to the forefront. Wagner, a German 19th-century composer best known for his operas, wrote the piece in true romantic style with exaggerated swells from loud to soft. Several exciting climaxes intensified the piece, when the orchestra built up powerful crescendos then suddenly dropped down to a quiet hum. Both the sudden and slow changes in dynamics showed off the focus and control of the musicians on stage and the orchestra’s ability to move as a single body.
The incredible dynamic range is meant to reflect the emotional turmoil of Tristan, a character from a 
12th-century legend of star-crossed lovers, as he and Isolde, the wife-to-be of Tristan’s uncle, fall in love. The story, which has taken many forms in its hundreds of years of existence, is rich with guilt, revenge, love, and deceit. The orchestra did an excellent job of expressing this drama through music.
The orchestra’s impressive performance aside, Ax stole the show with his performance of Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart’s “Concerto No. 22 for Piano and Orchestra.” In contrast to the emotional vigor in the Wagner piece, the Mozart concerto highlighted the soloist’s skill with delicate and incredibly fast finger work.
The seasoned pianist was a self-assured and engaged performer. Ax oftentimes took his eyes off the keys to carefully watch the conductor, and moved his head vigorously to the music, even when not playing. He played each series of rapid trills and scales with ease, without making a production of the obvious difficulty of the piece.
For Ax, this confidence did not translate into arrogance. After his performance, the audience cheered wildly and gave him a standing ovation, and Ax accepted the applause with a series of humble and good-natured smiles and bows. When the audience insisted, he took a seat once more on the piano bench for an encore — a sweet, romantic piece that allowed Ax to show the audience a little more versatility.
Despite its strong reception, Ax’s appearance was surprisingly brief. Aside from his encore, the three-movement Mozart concerto was the only piece that featured the pianist. Judging from the audience’s enthusiastic reception, Ax was the highlight of the evening; the orchestra could have done more to make him the centerpiece of the program.
Although they had taken a step back to accompany Ax’s performance, the orchestra once again rose to the spotlight for its performance of English composer Edward Elgar’s “Enigma Variations.” Elgar’s piece consists of 14 variations on a theme, each representing an important person in Elgar’s life. Though connected by this common underlying theme, each variation was distinct, and many were in direct contrast to one another, as the music was written to express different personalities.
Like the Wagner piece, Elgar’s variations showed a wide range of emotions and dynamics. Starting off with a tender depiction of Elgar’s wife, Alice, the piece varied from light, flurrying winds to loud, blaring brass to sweeping, emotive strings. The “Nimrod” variation, perhaps the most well known of the variations, was a particular highlight. Moving at a very slow adagio, the orchestra grew in dynamics with an intense yet extremely tender crescendo, moving seamlessly from soft to loud.
With the help of Ax, the PSO put on another excellent and well-received program for local classical music lovers. Despite Ax’s brief appearance, the program showed off both Ax as an accomplished soloist and the PSO as an orchestra that continues to impress.

As its name implies, spring break is a time for students to take a break from work. Even if you’re not going home or somewhere warm and sunny, your spring break doesn’t have to be a bummer. Whether you have the whole week or only an afternoon to spare, Pittsburgh has a lot to offer and there’s no better time to get out and explore.
If you’re looking for a bit of adventure, check out the Mattress Factory, a contemporary art museum located in the historic North Side that focuses on exhibitions that feature a variety of media to fully engage visitors. Getting there can be a challenge and the entrance is hidden in an alleyway, but it’s worth the effort once you get inside.
The Mattress Factory currently features two exhibitions in addition to its permanent collection. Factory Installed, which has been on display since October, features a wide variety of work — from projections to mirrored rooms to technology-focused installations — by artists Pablo Valbuena, Mariana Manhães, Natalia González, Nika Kupyrova, Than Htay Maung, and Veronica Ryan. All of the works in this exhibit are site specific and were created just for the Mattress Factory. Factory Installed is on display until May 27.
Also on view at the Mattress Factory is 610-3556 by New York-based artist Sarah Oppenheimer. This piece features an opening in the floor of a room on the fourth floor of the museum that directs viewers’ attention to a neighboring yard across the street. The piece is the first time an artist has altered the building’s structure in its 30-year history. When visiting the museum, it seems that every exhibit is more exciting than the last, making for a truly memorable experience. Best of all, Carnegie Mellon students get into the Mattress Factory for free.
For music lovers and collectors of vinyl, Pittsburgh has some great record stores — but who really has the time to sift through a record store when classes are in session? That’s why spring break is the perfect time to devote a few hours to digging through grungy record shops.
Jerry’s Records in Squirrel Hill is the go-to store for many vinyl collectors. Home to over 1 million vinyl albums, Jerry’s was named one of Rolling Stone’s best record stores in the United States in 2010. Even Mac Miller loves Jerry’s — he released a freestyle about the store in January called “Jerry’s Record Store.” If Jerry’s isn’t your jam, try Wicked Discs in Oakland, which focuses on classic rock, punk, and metal, or 720 Records in Squirrel Hill, which focuses on hip-hop, reggae, funk, and jazz.
While it may seem like an obvious suggestion, you could spend a day at the Carnegie museums in Oakland during the break. The Carnegie Museum of Art’s permanent collection contains around 35,000 European and American art works from the late 17th century to the present. The museum is also hosting temporary exhibits, including an exhibit by sculpture and landscape artist Maya Lin (titled Maya Lin) and a retrospective of African-American photographer Charles “Teenie” Harris (titled Teenie Harris, Photographer: An American Story). The museum’s photographic exhibit Picturing the City: Downtown Pittsburgh, 2007–2010 is closing March 25, so spring break is a good opportunity to see it before it closes.
The Carnegie Museum of Natural History is currently home to Read My Pins: The Madeleine Albright Collection, an exhibit featuring more than 200 of Albright’s pins, which she wore to convey and reinforce diplomatic messages during her term as Secretary of State. In addition to its permanent exhibitions covering a range of topics from botany to dinosaurs to minerals, the museum also features the Cats and Dogs Series, silkscreen prints of domestic dogs and cats by Andy Warhol. Both Carnegie museums are a short walk from campus and, like the Mattress Factory, Carnegie Mellon students enjoy free admission.
If you have a car, or a friend with one, take a day trip to Falling Water. Located about an hour and a half from Pittsburgh, Falling Water is a home designed and built between 1936 and 1939 by esteemed American architect Frank Lloyd Wright. The home appears to be standing on nothing, instead stretching out over a 30-foot waterfall. When it was built, Falling Water was immediately recognized as an architectural feat and is now a National Historic Landmark. After being closed for all of January and February, the architectural landmark will reopen for the 2012 season on Saturday.
There’s a lot to see in and around Pittsburgh, and it seems like there’s never time to get out while classes are in session. So take a day off, get some fresh air, and take in the local culture. You won’t regret it.

Local music lovers traveled back to the 1950s last Thursday at Carnegie Music Hall when the Pittsburgh-based River City Brass band played several famous ’50s tunes for an enthusiastic audience.
Founded in 1981, the brass band features a 28-piece ensemble and tours throughout the United States. The group now boasts a total of 15 recordings, and continues to play a repertoire spanning from Broadway to big band swing and jazz.
Under the musical direction of James Gourlay, River City Brass is quite successful. The charismatic conductor was the star of the show on Thursday. A native of Scotland, Gourlay is musically gifted and holds the band together well. Between numbers, Gourlay gave short, entertaining introductions that explained the background of each piece.
The band opened with a sweeping rendition of “Guadalcanal March” by American composer Richard Rogers. This number captured the attention of the audience. Perhaps the most moving number of the entire performance was the second piece: famed American composer Leonard Bernstein’s “On the Waterfront,” which serves as the soundtrack to the 1954 classic film of the same name. The band captured the spirit of the film with this piece. Sophomore vocal performance major Kati Richer said, “I felt like I was sitting in the actual movie score.”
The night’s program yielded many other notable performances. One such performance was “Cherry Pink and Apple Blossom White.” This work by composer Louiguy (pseudonym for Louis Guglielmi) had a distinctive Spanish flare, making it an exciting contrast to the typical marching band-style brass bands. River City Brass’ principal cornet player, Bernard Black, gave a lovely solo performance during the piece.
The band also integrated the Pine-Richland High School band into its program on Thursday. Pine-Richland is a high school in Gibsonia, located north of Pittsburgh. The band of around 90 members performed two numbers before intermission. Conducted by Pine-Richland band director James Stillwagon, the students put on a beautiful performance.
As a brass band, River City Brass is obviously not known for its presentation of vocal music. This performance, however, featured two numbers with solo singers and while the band was successful instrumentally, it was disappointing vocally. The singing was quite underwhelming and although the addition of vocals certainly added a jovial element to the performance, it ultimately took away from the concert’s professionalism.
At the close of the concert, the Pine-Richland students joined with River City Brass to perform a powerful interpretation of the famous “Stars and Stripes Forever” by American composer John Philip Sousa. This moving rendition closed the performance with a bang and left the audience with happy, patriotic feelings.

When Julia Holter released her album Tragedy last year, it quickly received plenty of critical acclaim: National Public Radio named it one of the top 10 “outer sound” albums of 2011 while FACT magazine ranked it at No. 13 on its list of best albums of the year. The album, which centers around Euripides’ play Hippolytus, combines psychedelic soundscapes with Holter’s echoing vocals and a multitude of musical influences to create a swirling, brooding atmosphere befitting the Greek tragedy. Her new album, Ekstasis, keeps the groovy sounds but abandons Tragedy’s moodiness in favor of a peppy, more accessible sound.
However, the differences between Ekstasis and Tragedy are evident from the opening notes. While Tragedy began with hazy, atmospheric ambience, Ekstasis begins with what sounds like a pop version of Baroque chamber music. The differences only continue from there. The rich soundscapes are still there, but instead of ominous foghorns and clanging, they’re accompanied by peppy synthesizers and upbeat percussion.
These differences don’t make Ekstasis less musically interesting. The album still has a dreamy haziness about it, as though you’re listening to it echo through a cloud of smoke. Instead of the ominous vibe emanating throughout Tragedy, Ekstasis has a calmly contented feel.
Holter still weaves a fascinating blend of musical influences into her soundscapes — Ekstasis has everything from a Baroque harpsichord to an ’80s-inspired synth to eastern-influenced ambient sounds. Embedded in all these musical layers is Holter’s voice, which ranges from an operatic style to a bouncy pop sound to a whispered spoken word. In less skilled hands, this huge range of sounds could quickly devolve into chaos, but Holter pulls everything together skillfully to create a musical atmosphere that’s greater than the sum of its parts.
This musical atmosphere allows Ekstasis to succeed where Tragedy sometimes fell short. Tragedy is so focused on pulling in as many threads of sound as possible, and so intent on fitting the theme of Hippolytus, that it often feels overly intellectual. With the previous album, the listener can appreciate the mastery that Holter is showing in her music, but this sometimes makes it difficult to get lost in the brooding atmosphere Holter is trying to create.
In Ekstasis, though, Holter seems to be less pressured to prove her talents, and instead focuses on creating a lovely atmosphere that allows you to step outside yourself and into Ekstasis’ rich musical world.
Ekstasis will be released on March 8, but can currently be streamed online at NPR.org.

If you are sick of high school and college students thinking that they are part of some cool and exclusive club for knowing the first two rules of Fight Club (which are, paradoxically, not to talk about Fight Club), you can thank Chuck Palahniuk, the author of the novel. He has been releasing novels annually for the past 13 years, and he is well known for writing books that deal with macabre and gritty subject matter.
Over the years, Palahniuk has gradually introduced socially critical themes in his work. For a while, this worked wonderfully. Lullaby, Diary — and, to a lesser extent, Rant — were well-executed horror stories that managed to unsettle the reader with disturbing scenes, plots, and characters, forcing the reader to re-examine the validity of certain characteristics of American society. Recently, however, Palahniuk has focused too strongly on social criticism and not enough on delivering strong, fluid stories. His most recent book, Damned, is merely a continuation of Palahniuk’s downward spiral.
Satirical may be one of the first words that comes to mind when trying to describe Palahniuk’s work. As hard as it may be, ignore the impulse to call his work satire. It is not, because satire requires subtlety and skill. While Palahniuk is a skilled writer, he possesses the subtlety of a Tyrannosaurus rex with a Napoleon complex. The satirical elements in his earlier works succeeded because they were vehicles for the plot. This relationship is inverted in Damned, and the book suffers severely because of it. The focus on social issues instead of a plot results in a very slow-paced book that is neither interesting nor captivating and is not even convincing in its cynicism.
Palahniuk is not a bad writer: His ability to construct intriguing and definitive characters is amazing. Even in Damned this talent is noticeable. The narrator, 13-year-old Madison, is dead and has been sent to Hell after an “overdose of marijuana.” The Hell in Damned contains the pantheons of old religions torturing damned souls for enjoyment against the background of a waterfall of feces, mountains of nail clippings, and other not-so-pleasant landmarks. The juxtaposition of the narrator’s wry humor and the disturbing features of Hell is genuinely enjoyable and interesting. Unfortunately, it quickly gets old as it becomes clear that the narrator is solely a vehicle for communicating the travesty of parents living vicariously through their children and then treating them as status symbols.
There is a reason that Fight Club garnered so much attention among young adults. It was inventive, in-your-face, visceral, and uncompromising — everything a typical rebellious teenager hopes to be. There are glimpses of these traits in Damned, but the constant thematic repetition and the slowness of the plot render Damned a difficult read. Palahniuk is not a sellout or washed up — not yet, at least. At the moment, it appears that he has merely lost the visionary equilibrium that led him to such success with his earlier works. The talent is still there, but it is forced to play second fiddle to his satire.

Minimal techno, black metal, witch house, goth: They are all some of my favorite music genres, but they’re also some of the bleakest. While reviewing end-of-the-year lists from a slew of magazines, it appears that I am not the only one who has become obsessed with darkness. In the past decade, many genres of music have begun shifting toward dark, sluggish, and spooky themes. All of this begs the question: Why has our culture, or at the very least our musicians, become obsessed with darkness?
Darkness in music is nothing new: The ’80s, for example, were dominated by post-punk and were dark in their own right. But it’s been over 20 years since darkness has been in vogue. Perhaps music is finally becoming a reflection of the global trauma evident in the news: oil spills, economic ruin, riots, revolutions, tsunamis. 
As cultural analyst Simon Reynolds points out in his 2011 book Retromania, trauma induces repetition and regression, or hyperstasis. Reynolds implies that while we appear to be moving somewhere, we are actually staying in the same spot or even traveling backwards. In this state of hyperstasis, the past is perpetually reanimated into present culture. This results in individuals exhibiting an aching nostalgia for even the most irrational sorts of retromania.
As a result of global trauma, a large portion of the music being produced today seems to be haunted by the past. It is in music that we are seeing a distinctive reaction to the political and economic atmosphere of the world. This sort of sluggish and spooky music is not like the ’80s music that was dark for the sake of being dark, but rather is a result of social, political, cultural, and environmental shocks. Musicians today are taking ideas and styles from the past and are reworking them to become a reflection of the present. The world isn’t a good place right now, but the darkest hour is just before the dawn.

A Letter to the Editor suggests that the difficulty of developing school spirit stems from a combination of badly timed sports events and late night classes. Academics always come first at Carnegie Mellon, so having classes that overlap with sporting events only makes school spirit all the more difficult to obtain.

Dear Patrick,
Spring break is coming up, and I have no idea what to do with all that time off. I’ve forgotten what it’s like to have free time. What should I do with myself next week?
Thanks,
I Need Entertainment, Earnestly Desire A Vexation-Avoiding Cruise And Tremendous Increase in Overall Nirvana
Dear I NEED A VACATION,
You have two options in front of you: hanging out around town, or getting out of Pittsburgh while you still have a chance. If you stay in Pittsburgh, there are still plenty of ways to spend your time. You can finally put those all-nighters behind you and sleep all afternoon. When you aren’t comatose, there are plenty of concerts, shows, and bars to keep you entertained. Mainly bars.
But spring break is for traveling! You could go to South America to hit the beaches, but then you’ll probably get dysentery or get caught in the middle of a drug war, which, while fun, isn’t exactly stress free. If you want to stay closer to home, try a road trip or take the bus somewhere. If you’re worried about being stabbed at the bus depot, remember that you’re just as likely to be stabbed at a highway rest stop. If money is a concern, try couch surfing. Again, the worst that can happen is some mild stabbing.
Basically just try to avoid getting stabbed next week,
Patrick Hoskins
Dear Patrick,
Like, my TA is soooo dreamy, and I totes think he’s into me. He wrote a smiley face next to my grade!! How can I get him to ask me out (since, ya know, I can’t ask him out — that’d be super awk)?
<3,
Want Instructor Lovingly, Like, Totally Hot And Teaches Great, Easily a Ten, Maybe an Eight, Anyway, Need Advice
Dear WILL THAT GET ME AN A,
This all depends on how sleazy your TA is. If he’s kind of sleazy, like an economics or business TA, then he’s probably willing to go out with his students. In any other subject, your TA is probably too hung up on that whole “integrity,” “getting fired for sexual harassment,” and “abusing power” junk to actually make a move. In that case, wait until the semester’s over and then see where things go.
If you’re still reading, then we’ve already established that your TA is a sleazeball. In that case, it’ll be easy to get him to make a move. Are you sure you want to go out with this guy? I mean, you just admitted he’s sleazy, otherwise you wouldn’t be reading this. Seriously, he’s no good. Oh, you’re going to go after him anyway? That’s cool — write to an advice columnist and ignore his advice.
Damn kids these days,
Patrick Hoskins

Jake Flittner remains student body president after Thursday evening's joint Undergraduate Student Senate and Graduate Student Assembly (GSA) meeting. The vote for impeachment did not officially occur, as GSA did not have enough members attending to meet its 3/4 quorum.
Flittner faced impeachment hearings after Student Senate unanimously requested that he be removed from office on March 1. At tonight's meeting, the impeachment motion was presented to the joint session, and Flittner presented a defense of his role. He argued that, constitutionally, he fulfilled nearly every duty that is outlined for his position in the Student Body Constitution. While Flittner admitted to missing a few meetings and to concrete progress toward achieving Student Senate's goals, he emphasized that he accurately “represented the voice of the student body to the administration.”
Senate, GSA, and others present then discussed the impeachment motion for almost an hour. A common theme of the discussion was a debate whether the motion for impeachment should be based on the president's constitutional duties or on Student Senate's satisfaction with Flittner's progress. 
Undergraduate Student Senator Jon Mark, who initially called for Flittner's impeachment, made a final comment before the discussion period closed. "I think it comes back a lot to perception issues," he said. "The things that were moving along, that were happening, were a result of [Student Body Vice President Sangita Sharma]. I know she wants to say they’re a team, but when it comes to student government, she would do a better job.... Senate really does believe that doing this is the right thing to be doing for the student body."
After discussion, Senate Chair Will Weiner called for a vote from both bodies. Due to GSA's lack of quorum, the vote was unofficial, but the votes were still tallied. Undergraduate Student Senate voted 19–8 and GSA voted 22–23, which would have caused the motion to fail had the vote been valid. Flittner would not have been impeached even had the votes been official, as neither body achieved a 3/4 supermajority. Because the request for impeachment is only valid for three weeks and the vote did not occur, the motion has expired.

TEDxCMU presented at Carnegie Mellon for the third year in a row this past Sunday in McConomy Auditorium. TEDx stands for “independently organized TED event” and its goal is to share “ideas worth spreading.” 
Every year, the event brings a diverse range of speakers presenting their own take on TEDx’s theme. This year, the theme was interpretation.
“We have a much higher variety of speakers this year,” said senior computational biology major Judith Savitskaya, the head of publicity for TEDxCMU. “Some of the criticisms that we’ve got in the past is that speakers kind of gather around the same subject, but this year we’ve tried to really diversify.”
TEDx had thirteen speakers this year: Sahil Harlalka, Ardon Shorr, Jay Whitacre, John Riccitiello, Gil Taran, Sean Ogle, Gala Darling, Razi Imam, Stephen Neely, Matthew Manos, Zach Weiner, Jennifer Stock, and the Threefifty Duo: guitarists Brett Parnell and Geremy Schulick.
Savitskaya said that the speakers were chosen based on whom TEDxCMU team members were interested in. “It was a lot of individual interest, but we have a very diverse team. So we kind of used that to our advantage,” she said.
Junior guitar performance major Jeesoo Sohn, TEDxCMU’s president, said, “I told my team, ‘Who are your biggest inspirations in this world? Who do you look up to? What blogs do you read?’ Obviously, they had to be connected to Carnegie Mellon or Pittsburgh.”
Each of the chosen speakers had something to share with the audience. Imam, an innovator and entrepreneur, shared the concept of engineering luck for oneself. Ogle, a lifestyle entrepreneur, went over the differences between what he called the “Traditional American Dream” and the “New American Dream.” Ogle explained that people prefer unhappiness over uncertainty — uncertainty of what they want, of how to get what they want — and so they stick to the “Traditional American Dream” of getting a job, having 2.5 children, and having the perfect house with a white picket fence.
“Ask yourself one thing: What do you want to do with your life?” Ogle said. “I know this is the cheesiest thing, but there are only seven days in a week, and ‘some day’ is not in it.” Ogle argued against not going after what you really want merely because of uncertainty.
Neely, an artist lecturer, used a swing set and piano onstage during his talk. Neely had his son swing while he made an analogy of how the motion of a swing is similar to the motion an orchestra conductor makes while conducting. Neely then played the piano as the audience conducted. 
The general purpose of his talk was to convey a simple message: “The artful experience is something to aspire to,” Neely said. “It’s something that’s to be dynamic, to be experienced, and you have to figure out what is the role in that, and how are you able to find that experience.”
Erik Pintar, first-year electrical and computer engineering major, said he liked Neely’s talk. “The connection he made about the swinging and the music: It helped connect a very natural moment in childhood to what we see as something so sophisticated,” Pintar said. “When the beauty really comes from natural movement.”
In the three years of TEDxCMU’s existence, Sohn said that the event has grown a lot. According to Sohn, TEDxCMU received over 1,100 applications from people hoping to attend TEDx this year, more than double McConomy’s capacity. She said that this year’s TEDxCMU team is twice the size of last year’s.
Pintar said that he had “watched a bit of TEDx” online before and that they were “all really interesting and inspirational and helped transform knowledge and ideas into meaningful experiences for others.” 
He heard that TEDx would be occurring on campus through his adviser. “As soon as I saw it, I had to go,” Pintar said.
Meanwhile, Kyra Ceceris, a research and development engineer, learned about TEDxCMU through PopCity Online. Ceceris, like Pintar, had seen the TEDx videos online, but she had never seen them live before.
“I thought it would be a good experience [to come] since they’re in Pittsburgh,” Ceceris said. “I enjoyed it ... [but] since I work for biotech, it would be interesting to see something related to science.”
“When people come to any TED event, they’re excited about listening to that one speaker,” Sohn said. “I think most people learn most from the ones they weren’t excited about. It’s important to keep an open mind.”
All of the TEDxCMU talks from the past three years are available online to watch for free at tedxcmu.com.

Police officers and employees in the buildings evacuated during a bomb threat last Monday have different perspectives on how smoothly the sweep went.
University Police received a bomb threat, via different notes found in different locations on campus, at around 8:30 a.m. The threat targeted both Warner Hall and Smith Hall. About an hour later, University Police evacuated the targeted buildings, and the Pittsburgh Bomb Squad began a floor-by-floor search. 
“They didn’t say bomb threat. They said, ‘We need you to leave the building,’ and they told us to go over to Cyert,” said Ruth Vojtko, a Warner Hall receptionist. “It wasn’t an alarming, ‘Quick, get out of here’ evacuation.”
Cyert Hall is connected to Warner Hall at the basement level. University Police did not say why they evacuated employees of Warner Hall to Cyert, only that they took matters of campus safety very seriously. However, according to Lettia Denormandie, an enrollment services receptionist, there “was a slight miscommunication” as to how University Police and the Pittsburgh Bomb Squad would conduct the search.
“We thought that we were supposed to wait until they cleared all the other floors before we moved out,” Denormandie said. While some employees in Warner Hall left as soon as they were notified, others remained behind.
University Police has a different perspective. According to Lieutenant Gary Scheimer, the search went very well. He said that this was one of the smoothest searches he has ever been involved with.
“We had cooperation with multiple agencies, and the cooperation with staff and students was amazing. We were able to take care of it in a very short time and get back to business,” Scheimer said.
This bomb scare reminded Warner Hall employees of a past incident in which a waitlisted computer science student sent a package to admissions. One of the workers opened the package and saw a flashing light. “[It was] a little bizarre for us,” Vojtko said. Warner Hall took the incident seriously and evacuated to the University Center until the police arrived.
“That was a quick kind of evacuation,” Vojtko said. She said that the evacuation of Warner Hall, this time, “was a very strange evacuation of a building if there was a bomb scare.”
Warner Hall employees are split as to how well University Police and the Pittsburgh Bomb Squad handled the situation. However, they do agree that the police did a good job of keeping people calm.
“I didn’t see anybody hysterical or anything, so I think in some respect, the police didn’t get us over-alarmed or anything. I think in that respect it was handled okay,” Vojtko said.
“We just want everybody to be observant of their surroundings,” Scheimer said. “And if they see anything suspicious, to report it.”

The Entertainment Technology Center (ETC) announced a new partnership with 31st Street Studios, Paramount on Location, and Knight Vision Studios last Monday. The deal would bring a studio equipped for new motion-capture technology to 31st Street Studios.
Described by the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette as having the potential to be the “best film and video production facility for movies outside Southern California,” this partnership provides production opportunities for Carnegie Mellon ETC students, as well as for the movie production companies in the areas.
Mk Haley, associate executive producer at the ETC, described the new partnership as “sort of a community supporting each other.”
“We have a very long relationship with some of the key people who have a stake in 31st Street. It makes a lot of sense for us to partner up,” Haley said.
The 31st Street Studios facility resides in a large steel production building in the Strip district. The Pittsburgh Business Times reported that the ETC will hold graduate classes in the facility in the future.
The ETC itself will stay by the Monongahela River, but students will now have access to the 31st Street Studio facilities, which promise to house the largest soundstage outside of the Los Angeles area.
As Anthony Daniels, visiting ETC professor and voice of C–3PO in the Star Wars film series, told Essential Public Radio, “The Entertainment Technology Center is staying where it is on Technology Drive, but we are going to have a permanent presence here in the studio where students can come and work on their projects.”
Current ETC master’s student Noah Alzayer is working on a pitch for a project that will utilize the new resources available to him through this partnership.
“Our project that we’re talking about is making an ongoing motion capture data base similar to the graphics lab one, except we would make it a little more usable in practical ways,” Alzayer said. “On the average motion capture database you get something like two people dancing together or walking around, whereas we’d be trying to get people walking in place, jumping, climbing things, throwing a punch.” Alzayer said that he is pitching this project for the fall semester, and has spoken to Knight Vision founder James Knight regarding project space. Knight Vision was another key partner in the deal. They are notable for having worked on the visuals in James Cameron’s Avatar, and will provide motion capture and digital production services.
Knight told Essential Public Radio, “We’re very excited about coming to Pittsburgh, because of tax incentive, because of CMU, and because of the marvelous talent you have here in this town.”
Alzayer said that ETC students are excited about the deal, and the technology which they will be able to work with. “There are lots of cool new things about the system, and it eliminates a lot of the problems that come up with motion capture,” Alzayer said. “It’s kind of exciting, the sort of new technology that we’ll have access to. It’s definitely inspired people to think about projects to do with it.”

The Undergraduate Student Senate unanimously voted at its meeting Thursday night to hold impeachment proceedings against Student Body President Jake Flittner. The motion for impeachment was made by Senator Jonathan Mark, a junior drama major.
Senate Chair Will Weiner, a junior social and decision sciences and statistics double major, said the motion to impeach Flittner was “on the grounds of him not fulfilling his constitutional duties.” Weiner added, “The general feeling is that [Senate] wanted to make a statement that student government is something that should be taken seriously and should be held accountable, and if people aren’t fulfilling their constitutional duties, there should be something done to rectify that situation.”
Mark said that Flittner’s job as student body president was “unsatisfactory” and that “the feeling wasn’t exactly new.” Mark also said that Flittner was not present at Thursday’s meeting to hear of the request for impeachment. As president, Flittner is required to attend or send a representative to every Senate meeting.
According to Mark, the request for impeachment was not meant to humiliate Flittner, but to make a statement about the seriousness of student government positions.
“We’re not trying to hurt Jake,” he said. “Also, we’ve seen some people who think running for a student government position is a joke, and we want to show people that that is not the case. When there’s a bad cog in the system, you get to a point where it looks real bad for student government.”
Student Body Vice President Sangita Sharma, a junior materials science and biomedical engineering double major, did not agree with how Student Senate members handled the situation. She felt that none of the Senate members was up-front in communicating their dissatisfaction with Flittner.
“I respect them for trying to set a higher standard for future student government executive members, but overall I just wish they went about it in a different way,” Sharma said via email. “I guess this is a personal thing, but I am a confrontational person, so if I do not agree with the way someone is working then I will address them personally before I make it public.”
According to the Student Body Constitution, a request for impeachment requires a three-fourths supermajority vote at a Student Senate or a Graduate Student Assembly (GSA) meeting, or a petition signed by 500 students. The unanimous Senate vote means that, unless Flittner resigns, impeachment hearings will be held at a joint meeting of Senate and GSA. The meeting will take place within three weeks, and a three-fourths supermajority vote from both Student Senate members and GSA members will result in Flittner’s removal from office.
During the impeachment proceedings, Weiner and GSA President Jason Imbrogno, a Ph.D. student in economics, can appoint a member of the student body to fulfill the president’s duties. Weiner and Imbrogno appointed Sharma to that position Thursday night, and she accepted. In the event that Flittner leaves office through impeachment or resignation, Sharma can serve officially as student body president. “Jake is not entirely gone, but essentially, his powers are suspended,” Weiner said. “From my knowledge of student government, [impeachment] has not previously happened.”
Mark, reflecting on the outcome for the remainder of the semester, said, “I don’t know if we’re going to see very visible things on campus this rest of the semester, but policy changes might happen to make everything run smoother next semester.”
Despite the motion for impeachment, Sharma remains optimistic. “I am not sure where we will go from here,” she said via email, “but I am looking forward to improving relations between Senate and student government executive members.” Sharma plans to support Flittner during the impeachment process.
“After reading Jon Mark’s explanation for Senate’s decision, it is clear that confusion and miscommunication exists [sic] since certain points are entirely unfounded,” Flittner said in an email. “If Senate Exec would have come to me personally about the matter I know that several of their points of contention would have become entirely mute [sic].”
He urged students to go to cmusenate.org for updates.

Online Registration (OLR), the site where students register for their courses every semester, will be replaced by new registration features on Student Information Online (SIO) this March.
In addition to planning schedules, students will be able to use SIO to view their assigned registration times; to register, add, drop, and switch courses; and to manage waitlist activity.
OLR was initiated in 1997, according to University Registrar John Papinchak. He said that one of the driving forces behind the changes to SIO was that, when Enrollment Services last updated SIO, a number of students suggested modernizing OLR by incorporating it into SIO.
Papinchak explained a few features that students can expect from the new SIO registration system. 
First, the basic functions of OLR such as section switch, course switch, and waitlist checking will be transferred to SIO. 
In addition, students will no longer need to type individual course numbers when registering. Instead, students will now be able to load planned schedules to the registration page and click the “add” button to register for each course.
“What we are trying to do is to give students more information that supports the registration process,” Papinchak said.
However, more sophisticated changes might happen in future semesters. A long-term goal, Papinachak said, is one-button registration, in which students would only need to click one button to register for all of their courses once they have their schedules planned.
Christine Gilchrist, an academic adviser in the Mellon College of Science, expressed the same wish. Gilchrist wrote in an email, “An item on my wish list is a feature that will allow students to use their planned schedule to register for all courses at once and if there is a waitlist for a course, the student will immediately be recommended an alternate open section or required course that fits their schedule. This would necessitate a link between SIO and the student’s academic audit.”
Students’ opinions about OLR and expectations of the new system are varied.
“The OLR system is horribly inconvenient and terribly difficult to manage,” Zac Vennard, a senior international relations major, said in an email. “So I’m glad we’re pitching it.”
Junior finance major Alice Jun, however, takes a different attitude. 
“I like OLR a lot. It is very functional and it is easy for me to use,” she said. “But it will be nice that we will move to SIO so that we can take care of everything on one website. Maybe if we have some automatic thing where it will automatically register the courses we plan. If they could do that for us, that would be pretty awesome.”

Gingrich appoints Skinner to co-chair women’s board
Kiron Skinner has been named by Newt Gingrich’s presidential campaign, Newt 2012, as the National Co-Chair for the Women with Newt Coalition. 
Skinner is an associate professor of social and decision sciences as well as director of Carnegie Mellon’s Center for International Relations and Politics. This appointment is in addition to her position as foreign policy adviser to the campaign, which she has held since November of last year.
She will be joined on the board by Gingrich’s wife, Callista Gingrich; his daughters, Jackie Gingrich Cushman and Kathy Gingrich Lubbers; former president of the National Federation of Republican Women, Sue Lynch; political commentator Jeri Thompson; prominent Republican Gay Hart Gaines; and Iowa State Representative Linda Upmeyer.
Skinner is joining the coalition just in time to be part of Newt 2012’s buildup to Super Tuesday on March 6, when many states will be having their primary elections. A candidate can gain more votes on this day than any other, making it a critical part of a bid for the chance to run for the presidency.
Skinner said in a university press release that she is a longtime supporter of Gingrich and is impressed by his understanding of issues of particular importance to women, including national security, the economy, and education.
CMU professor wins NSF grant for census research
Statistics and social science professor Stephen Fienberg has been awarded a research grant from the National Science Foundation (NSF) Census Bureau Research Network. The NSF awarded Fienberg the grant to fund his project, “Data Integration, Online Data Collection and Privacy Protection for the 2020 Census.”
Fienberg will research the costs and response rates of census investigation, as well as citizen privacy. He and his research team will conduct these experiments in an effort to increase response rates. 
In addition, the team’s research will attempt to find methods that will ensure citizens’ confidentiality while still producing useful census information for the public and private sectors.
“This grant program gives the Census Bureau and the entire federal statistical system the opportunity to leverage the expertise of academia to solve problems we face every day in delivering cost-efficient statistics and information to the public,” said Robert Groves, director of the Census Bureau, in a university press release. “This research is an investment that will lead to cost savings, and we are excited about the possibilities for learning from our colleagues and for collaboration over the next five years.”

A Carnegie Mellon graduate student reported the theft of a new pedometer valued at $100 from his office in Wean Hall between the hours of 3:30 p.m. and 7:30 p.m. There was no sign of forced entry into the office. This incident is under investigation.
Alcohol Amnesty
Feb. 26, 2012
At approximately 5 a.m., University Police were summoned to Morewood Gardens regarding an unconscious male student. It was determined that the male was intoxicated. No one on scene could provide any information on what the student had consumed. The student was transported to Presbyterian Hospital by Pittsburgh EMS. No citations were issued, as Carnegie Mellon’s Alcohol Amnesty program applied.
Vehicle Stop
Feb. 27, 2012
University Police initiated a motor vehicle stop of a motorcycle on Forbes Avenue for speeding. During the stop, the officer found that the driver was under suspension. The motorcycle was towed and the driver was cited.
Theft
Feb. 27, 2012
While on a routine patrol of Hamburg Hall, University Police were stopped by a Carnegie Mellon graduate student who wanted to file a theft report. The student left her wallet in the women’s restroom in Hamburg Hall, and she was later notified that it was turned in to the University Center information desk. When she retrieved her wallet, she found that all of her credit cards and ID were present, but about $100 in cash had been taken. This matter is under investigation.
Theft
Feb. 27, 2012
During routine patrol, a Carnegie Mellon security officer found that a vending machine on the first floor of the Purnell Center had been damaged. The damage occurred between 9:30 p.m. and 9:50 p.m. It could not be determined if any money had been stolen from the machine. The vending company was contacted.
Suspicious Persons
Feb. 29, 2012
At approximately 6 a.m., University Police were called to Margaret Morrison Street in front of Margaret Morrison Plaza for a suspicious male who was possibly smoking marijuana. The officers did not see anyone fitting the description. A pedestrian was stopped to see if he had seen the suspicious male. The pedestrian began acting oddly and gave false information as to why he was on campus. He was given a defiant trespass warning.
Theft
March 1, 2012
University Police were called to take a report concerning a student who had left his backpack in Newell-Simon Hall. The student reported that when he returned to reclaim it, it was gone. His passport, student visa, and laptop were all missing. This case is still under investigation.

With only one week left until spring break, many Carnegie Mellon students are pulling all-nighters to cram for exams and complete projects. When spring break rolls around, students will have a chance to catch up on some sleep. Until then, here are a few facts about sleep and sleep deprivation:
43.7: The percent of adults, aged 18 to 24, who reported having fallen asleep unintentionally at least once in the last month
33: The percent of U.S. adults who get fewer than seven hours of sleep per night
11 days: The longest recorded time a person has gone without sleep
15 minutes: The difference between the lengths of an average high school student’s sleep before and after Daylight Savings Time

According to the 2009 State Profile Report by the College Board, the average student at a four-year public university pays $8,244 in tuition, while at a private university, the average student pays $28,500. Parental support and financial aid help a lot but do not cover everything, leaving loans to fill in the gap. According to FinAid.org, debt from student loans is at $983 billion and counting.
There’s no doubt about it: College is expensive. And yet so many people throw money at a college education without a second thought. Every college student should feel obligated to act responsibly when choosing to enter into so much debt.
At Carnegie Mellon, the Undergraduate Admissions website states that the average financial aid package is $33,679, with the average amount awarded in grants as $23,083. If loans make up the difference, then the average student will be assuming $10,596 in debt per year.
Granted, we all know we have to spend money to make money, and knowledge is a great investment. Isn’t the cost of tuition justified? The education we gain will give us the best qualifications to get a decent job and live the American dream. And if we don’t go to college, we face the social stigma against the uneducated. So we go to college because it’s the obvious next step in our future: It’s a rite of passage.
But a huge number of students don’t think about what they are investing in. They enter into higher education unclear about what career they are pursuing, what education they want to receive, and how they are going to apply their skills to advancing along their career path. They don’t think about the important long-term question: How will this education get them a job?
Instead, these students enter college and begin acquiring debt in order to explore their options. This path often involves entering college immediately after exiting high school, milling around as undecided majors until they make a decision a year or two later about what they want to do with their lives. In fact, in another report, the College Board found that an undecided major was the ninth most common major of graduating high school seniors from the list of 38 majors provided, illustrating that there are still a lot of students who don’t think about what they are investing in.
Meanwhile, these students are acquiring massive debt. Without a clear idea of what they are spending money on and how it will benefit them in the long run, it is difficult to justify the debt they are acquiring. Without a clear career path, it is hard to know that the college they are attending will have the right program to train them for their eventual job. It is worrisome that these students are acquiring debt despite these issues.
Their behavior reflects the financial irresponsibility that is seen all over the country and the financial irresponsibility that led to the real estate collapse, and subsequent corporate and individual bankruptcy over the last few years. It is a simple fact that if you try to consume more money than you can create, you will end up burdening the country and the economy. Similar to real estate, college debt should be treated responsibly — keeping students’ futures and the nation’s economy in mind.
But the accumulation of student debt is not even the main concern. What is most concerning is that students are frivolously spending money with no clear concept of its importance. Entering into college as an undeclared major is a thoughtless choice that hurts both the nation’s economy and the students themselves. Students should do more research and prepare a career path to develop financial responsibility.

Undergraduate Student Senate unanimously voted to start the impeachment process against Student Body President Jake Flittner last Thursday. Based on the lack of initiatives and projects coming out of the executive branch, we support this decision.
According to Senate’s official blog, the main reason for the move to impeach was that Flittner was not fulfilling his presidential duties as outlined in the Student Body Constitution.
According to senate members, he has failed to regularly attend Senate, Graduate Student Assembly (GSA), and Faculty Senate meetings. Flittner has also failed to hold and advertise monthly office hours, attend and chair Student Government Executive Committee and Board of Directors meetings, and facilitate representation of the student body throughout Carnegie Mellon’s Pittsburgh campus.
Flittner has not even convened his cabinet this semester and was absent from the meeting at which Senate voted to begin the impeachment process.
When anyone is in a leadership role, especially one as large as the student body president, he or she must take that role seriously. A leader must have the time and vision to lead, recognizing when help from others is needed to carry out his visions. It’s understandable that Flittner might be busy; for most Carnegie Mellon students, busy is a way of life.
But that is why the president has an entire cabinet of carefully selected people to support and carry out his visions. That is why the president has Student Senate, faculty members, advisers, GSA, and all the other branches of student government to collaborate with and draw resources from.
The fact that Flittner has not used any of these resources over the course of his term is shocking. His campaign promises from 2011 remain unfulfilled and leave us uninspired. Where is the Cultural Diversity Honors Program promised to us during his campaign? Where are the “Friday Frenzies” that campus eagerly awaited?
Campaign promises to the campus community have been forgotten, and promises to Student Senate to increase transparency and communication between branches of government have also been ignored. Flittner’s glaring lack of action has forced this impeachment process. Now, perhaps positive changes can be made and student government can get back on track.

Republican presidential candidate Rick Santorum has said some pretty controversial things, like calling President Barack Obama “a snob” for wanting “everybody in America to go to college.”
“Oh, I understand why he wants you to go to college. He wants to remake you in his image,” Santorum said at an appearance in Michigan. “I want to create jobs so people can remake their children into their image, not his.”
My gut-reaction rebuttal is that going to college will dramatically increase a person’s chances of finding a job, but there are several trends that show this is no longer the case.
Take the rising trend of boomerang kids, or recent college graduates who live with their parents because they couldn’t find sufficient employment to afford their own places. According to a 2010 study by Monster.com, 52 percent of recent college graduates are living with their parents, in comparison to 40 percent from the previous year.
This shows that unemployment among college graduates is also high, which is at 8.9 percent according to a recent report published by Georgetown University’s Center on Education and the Workforce.
Do these career prospects justify the enormous time commitments and costs of a college degree?
At some point, probably not. As much as we celebrate the learning and maturing that happens during college, most of us choose to take on college’s costly burden primarily because we believe we will recoup the expenses through better career prospects. But if those better prospects aren’t there, then college might not be worth it.
However, despite discouraging indicators like boomerang kids and high unemployment rates after graduation, the economic downturn has hit those without college degrees even harder. According to the Georgetown report, recent high school graduates face a whopping 22.9 percent unemployment rate.
Even after a few years in the workforce, there is still a significant difference between the unemployment rates of college and high school graduates. That difference has only become more pronounced since the economic downturn, increasing from 2.4 percent in 2007 to 5.1 percent in 2010, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.
Although these statistics might not change the fact that there are still thousands of boomerang kids who can’t find work, the economy does not affect the quality of their education.
While they may not realize these benefits until there is a recovery, employers in almost all industries, which prefer applicants, within a particular age group, with advanced degrees in education regardless of time spent unemployed.
Currently, there are positive signs of recovery, such as higher stock and production indices, and it’s likely that employers will begin hiring again soon. When they do, the boomerang kids will be the first of their age group to reap the benefits.

The diagnosis of autism has evolved from a rare, unknown subset of schizophrenia into a spectrum of learning disorders, which include social and behavioral impairments. These disorders have captured the attention of nearly every demographic in the United States; however, this does not mean that the implications of autism diagnoses are well understood.
While programs such as 60 Minutes and 20/20 have done excellent jobs at raising awareness of the lives of children with severe autism, the almost exclusive media coverage on those individuals has resulted in the obfuscation of children with high-functioning autism and adults with autism.
It is impossible to ignore the presence of the group Autism Speaks. While the group advocates autism awareness, its strategy of doing so is damaging to individuals with autism and their relatives. Instead of educating the public on autism, Autism Speaks depicts autism as a disease that destroys families and must be cured. Its cold-hearted view on autism was depicted best in the video “Autism Every Day,” which features a mother talking about how she had once considered killing both herself and her autistic daughter due to the challenges of raising a child with autism, all the while in front of said daughter.
It is no wonder, then, that there is still a portion of the population that believes individuals with autism are incapable of interacting with other people. It is impossible to deny that both living with autism and raising a child with autism are emotionally and financially taxing. However, to deny the nature of autism would be an immense disservice to the autistic community.
While there are some people with autism who will never be able to speak or use a bathroom, there are also some who attend school and are merely seen as “quirky.” There are probably many students in the Carnegie Mellon community who have been diagnosed with an autism spectrum disorder. Due to the behavioral impairments that autism causes, individuals with high-functioning autism are often misunderstood and generally unaccepted by their peers. The general absence of their portrayal in the media does not assist the difficulties they have interacting with a community of peers.
This plurality should be more emphasized in our society. If children are exposed to information about autism from a young age, whether it is in school, books, television, or simply through talking with their parents, individuals with high-functioning autism will have an easier time integrating into society and perhaps have an easier time finding success in industry. A greater media presence will also assure children with autism that they are not alone in their daily struggles, and perhaps even provide them with role models to look up to.
March is Autism Awareness Month. Use this opportunity to educate yourself and your peers about the reality of autism — then perhaps some day a designated month for autism awareness will not be needed.

We agree with Jeannette Wing, head of Carnegie Mellon’s computer science department, in regard to her article in the Pittsburgh Tribune-Review, which calls for a national priority to be put on teaching computer science. We should start teaching the foundations and thinking patterns of computer programming in high school, middle school, and even elementary school.
Teaching the foundations of programming early is a good way to create both jobs and technologically savvy citizens. Programming teaches a person to think algorithmically and to apply that thinking in real-world situations. These include everything from finding all of the divisors of a number to creating a language processing system like Apple’s Siri.
The nature of computational and algorithmic thinking — two cornerstones of programming — allows it to be easily integrated into school curricula. At some level, children already think computationally and algorithmically. If a child has a particular way of sorting and putting away Legos so they can be found more easily, that child is using computational thinking. Schools teach this sort of thinking on a basic level, but by integrating it even more into lesson plans, math problem sets, and activities, students can gain even greater flexibility and confidence in developing new solutions to emerging social problems.
Schools could implement changes to curricula simply by gearing more lessons towards computational thinking. Teachers could present problems to students (like reordering the school’s lunch line to maximize efficiency, or developing a system to sort the tallest to shortest student in class) to bolster thinking processes.
As our society becomes increasingly reliant on computing and programming, our schools should take steps to prepare students for the digital age.

As of this writing, the “Armenian Genocide” page on Wikipedia has been revised 7,356 times in the last 10 years. Most of those edits concern the use of the term “genocide.” The constant revisions this Wikipedia page has undergone are a symptom of larger problems in Europe: the defining of history through law.
According to The New York Times, the French Constitutional Council struck down a law last Tuesday that would have made it a crime to deny the Armenian genocide (1915–23).
The bill was passed by the French Senate and was supported by President Nicolas Sarkozy, who stated that he wanted to see the bill resubmitted with revised language.
The Turkish government accused French lawmakers of racism and insisted that “the writing of history was well beyond the bounds of their mandate,” according to the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette. The Turkish government has long maintained that the Armenian genocide was not a genocide at all, and that any statement to the contrary is an affront to the Turkish identity.
France indeed overstepped its boundaries. But ironically, the Turkish government has its own law that seems to “write history beyond their mandate.” The public affirmation of the Armenian genocide is an official crime in Turkey.
Both the French and Turkish governments fail to realize that passing laws criminalizing an opinion of history is wrong and dangerous. The introduction of this bill wasn’t so much about nailing down one true version of history, or about bettering the world through the recognition of a horrific event.
This bill could have been a political move by Sarkozy to gain the vote of the 500,000 French citizens that have Armenian roots.
Laws like the bill struck down in France and the law in effect in Turkey do nothing more than control populations and keep people in power.

It’s time to go. You are seven years old, it’s 4:25 p.m. on a Tuesday, and you are begrudgingly tying your shoe laces as your mom herds you out the door. This can only mean one thing: piano lessons. You arrive and plunk through your scales for half an hour. When the torture is complete, mom bundles you up and takes you away, only to start the weekly cycle once again.
By now, we have matured far beyond mandatory music lessons — no more itchy formal wear or ogling grandparents to worry about. We can choose how to spend our time — and if we choose to involve ourselves in classical music, there are many benefits we can gain.
So, why choose classical music? Why not get our music fix from Guitar Hero and Britney Spears? The difference between these popular musical outlets and classical music can seem elusive. However, as a classical musician, I like to think that there is something intrinsically valuable in the tradition.
Of course Spears has a certain appeal, but it’s doubtful that her lyrics and melodies communicate the indescribable beauty and pain of the human condition that classical music does. So why does Spears’ song “I Wanna Go” have over 80 million hits on YouTube, while Ludwig Van Beethoven’s most popular composition, “Symphony No. 9,” has less than 18 million?
The answer is often that popular music is more easily digestible. Today’s fast-paced age of quick gratification does not prepare us well to reap the benefits of the classics.
For example, “I Wanna Go” is 3 1/2 minutes long. A performance of Beethoven’s Ninth Symphony lasts over an hour. Unless an audience member wants an expensive nap, he or she will need an apt attention span for the Beethoven.
Once listeners learn to appreciate classical works, they will be richly rewarded. Beethoven’s music is truly ingenious in its complexity, and the figurative pictures that it paints in the mind of attentive listeners have the potential to inspire a wiser, more cultured, and more artistic life.
Mom was right, as usual. Whether it’s by performing or by attending concerts, eat your spinach and listen to your classical music. It’s good for you.

To the Editors of The Tartan,
As a speaker at the event, I appreciated your coverage of last week’s Veritas Forum on “the meaning of work.” One of the many reasons why I love Carnegie Mellon is our diversity, and our willingness to embrace that diversity through open, respectful dialog. I was happy to see The Tartan covering and participating in that dialog.
However, I wanted to clarify one point in The Tartan’s coverage of the event. Your story said that I believe “all humans already have God’s acceptance.” This is not entirely accurate. In my opening statement (which is available online), I was trying to say that I believe that all humans have received God’s offer of acceptance through Jesus’ death. However, I also believe that God gives each of us the dignity of choosing whether to accept this offer; and thus while God’s acceptance is freely offered, it must also be voluntarily received.
This distinction is important to me because I’d hate to leave your readers with the false impression that individual choice has no role to play in the Christian faith.

With half the semester gone, I wanted to check in on behalf of Senate to let you know where we stand on our projects and give some updates for the rest of the way.
The first topic I’d like to address is the Port Authority cuts. We have been very active in fighting against these cuts, including generating the site stoppatcuts.com, which currently has over 1,500 signatures. We have publicized the site through tabling, appearances at campus events, and via the internet. We will continue to make sure CMU’s voice is heard and will be taking a lobbying trip to Harrisburg later this month.
In my previous update I mentioned several projects; here are updates. In tandem with the University Center staff, we will be adding a new air hockey table as well as speakers in the Scotland Yard game room. The staffs at Tazza D’Oro and Gates have agreed to let us implement a table-sharing system there, which will help with crowding issues. In terms of new initiatives, we have formed a committee that addresses biking issues on campus, and we are working collaboratively with several other groups to install new bike racks. We are launching a T-shirt design contest for a student to design a CMU shirt that we will sell at a cheap rate to the student body. We are beginning to poster and create online publicity for this contest.
Our Finance Committee continues to give money to many worthy causes including Bhangra, TEDx, and Carnival. We funded AB to put speakers in Kirr Commons for Late Nights, something that will save groups $65 per event once installed. We budgeted to provide funding in the future for CollegiateLink, which is an organization management platform that has great potential to empower student groups and connect campus better than ever before.
The final area I will touch on is PR. I feel we have made large strides in this area. We have tabled nearly every Friday this semester, spreading awareness about our initiatives and our work with the Port Authority cuts. Our blog cmusenate.org has served as a more effective vehicle for sharing information, but we still need it to reach a larger audience. We have built a stronger foundation than in years past, and there is a good basis for our image to grow. That being said, we need to be diligent in continuing to spread our name, especially with elections season around the corner.
There are several more initiatives than these, which I encourage you to follow at cmusenate.org. We welcome your feedback and criticisms as always.

Student Senate Chair

Sun and fun await you. Take this vacation to stock up on as much sun as you possibly can. You’ll need it to survive the last few weeks of winter at Carnegie Mellon.
It was nice that you gave your TA the benefit of the doubt at the start of the semester, but now it’s crunch time and you must come to the realization that your TA is an incompetent fool.
Why are you reading the paper? You don’t have the luxury of sitting and frittering your time away. Get back to work! 
There are many things in life right now that are confusing to you. Confusion can be a very painful thing, but things can only clear up from here.
There’s lots of work to be done this week, but make sure that you take some time to relax... even if all you do is lay on your back staring at the celling and asking a higher power to spare you.
Your spring break plans are not so great, but your friends don’t have to know that. Lie and make them envy you.
Midterms. Why are you worrying about midterms? You’re amazing, and there’s nothing that will stand in your way.
Hurry up and finish your work so you can get to more important stuff, like anything that isn’t homework.
Five more days. Five more days. Five more days. Five more days.
I know you may want to, but you can’t fall to pieces until you get the approval of at least three outside experts. Once you get said approval, you may then commence falling apart.
You have to deal with all of your problems this week, but that’s nothing new to you. Just remember that all you have to do is make it to Friday and things will get better.
Your Libra friend is quite delusional. Keep an eye on him because he’s going to need you.
