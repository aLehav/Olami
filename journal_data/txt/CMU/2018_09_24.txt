The Carnegie Mellon University football team welcomed Saint Vincent College on Saturday, Sept. 22. The Tartans opened their home schedule with a 42–27 win over the Bearcats, moving to a 2-1 overall record on the season, and 1–1 in Presidents’ Athletic Conference (PAC) play.
The game began slowly, with the first points coming late in the first quarter. The Bearcats opened with the ball first, but their first drive ended with a sack by senior defensive end Long Tran and junior linebacker Darian Cohen. The next two drives were three-and-outs, but the Tartans found some rhythm in the following drive. The Tartans started the drive with great field position on the Bearcats 48-yard line and marched down the field. At 5:09, senior quarterback Alex Cline threw a 24-yard strike to senior half-back Karl Kumm in the back of the endzone for a touchdown. The Bearcats responded, however, making their way from their own 27-yard line to the Carnegie Mellon 26-yard line. After gaining 11 yards on 3rd down and 11, the Bearcats decided to go for it on fourth down. The gamble paid off, ending in a touchdown and an even score, 7–7.
In the second quarter, the Tartans picked up where they left off, with three consecutive completions from Cline to lead the home squad to the red zone. Cline threw a quick 8-yard dart to wide receiver Kris Hughes to retake the lead, 14–7. On the next drive, the Bearcats couldn’t put anything together against an aggressive Tartan defense. An 8-yard loss on a sack by Tran brought the Bearcats back to the Carnegie Mellon 35-yard line, away from field goal range on 3rd and 10. Following a punt and touchback, the Tartans extended the lead by two touchdowns when Cline found junior running back Will Richter for a 70-yard touchdown on the first play of the drive. In response, the Bearcats chewed up nearly six minutes of the clock on a 12-play, 71-yard drive that ended with a 15-yard touchdown, making the score 21–14, still in favor of the Tartans.
The Tartans jumped back to a 28–14 lead on the opening kickoff of the second half. Senior running back Rory Hubbard took the kickoff on the 5-yard line and ran down the sideline to the endzone for the second kickoff return for a touchdown of his career. Later in the third quarter, a Tartans drive stalled at the 28-yard line. Saint Vincent blocked the ensuing punt, scooped up the football at the 10-yard line, and ran it in for a special teams touchdown. With the score now 28–21, the teams went to work, but couldn’t find any momentum. Over the next five minutes, both teams had two three-and-outs. The Tartans again found success with a short field, beginning a drive on the Saint Vincent 48-yard line. A 17-yard pass from Cline to Richter set the Tartans up in the red zone, and Hubbard ran the ball in from six yards out for his second touchdown of the game.
Compared to the previous three quarters, the fourth quarter was a quieter affair. The 35–21 score didn’t change until 3:44 left in the game, when junior running back Chris Haas rushed through the left side of the field for a touchdown. The Bearcats fought back and played the football game until the final second, improving the score to 42–27 with another touchdown.
The Tartans finished the game with a balanced offensive attack, 207 yards through the air and 162 on the ground. The Bearcats threw for 339 yards, but couldn’t get their running game going, recording only 62 rushing yards for the game. The Tartans only held possession for 23 minutes of the game, but didn’t turn the ball over, while the Bearcats coughed it up three times. Cline went 15-for-27, 207 yards, and three touchdowns in the win. Hubbard led the team on the ground, with 81 yards, and recorded 228 all-purpose yards. Richter was the team’s top wideout, with 111 yards on four catches and 1 touchdown.
Next week, the Tartans will welcome the Grove City College Wolverines to Gesling Stadium on Saturday, Sept. 29. The game is set for 1 p.m.

The first set went up, reached the apex of its parabolic arc, and fell down back to Earth like a firework climbing into a black night sky, and was spiked into the ground for what would have been a point if the match had started yet. Instead, the hitter’s face ended up mashed into the net for an awkwardly exciting start to the second home match of the Tartan’s volleyball season. The Tartans were 6–5 on the season, with a four game win streak coming into their matchup against the Franciscan College Lady Barons on Tuesday, Sept. 18.
After playing the first seven points and a Lady Barons timeout, the Tartans were up by a score of 6–1 thanks to two double hits by the Lady Barons; the only Lady Barons point came off a miscommunication in the Tartan backcourt at the end of a long point. The Tartans kept the pressure up over the next few points, forcing a few more Lady Baron errors and a timeout at a score of 11–2 Tartans. For the first points, the Tartans played a conservative brand of volleyball to establish their quick lead, but after some poor serves and one or two poor on-court decisions, the Lady Barons showed a little bit of life. However, a few errors—an illegal block and an illegal spike—and three aces in a row pushed the Tartans to the 25 points needed to win the first game.
The second set started back and forth between the Lady Barons and the Tartans, with each team making various errors or serving mistakes. Then, the Tartans slowly added two or three points to the Lady Barons one, and quickly, the Tartans were up 15–7 in the second game. After the unsure start, the Tartans dispatched the Lady Barons in short order, winning ten of the last twelve points in the game for a final game score of 25–9.
At the start of the third game, the Lady Barons took the first point, but the Tartans again found themselves with a solid lead of 6–2 early into the third, and hopefully, final game; over the next handful of points the Tartans and Lady Barons went back and forth, until two mishits off the Tartan serve led to a lead stretching into seven points halfway through the game. Off a series of services from junior Maia So-Holloway, the Tartans strong armed to a streak of ten points that ended with the score 24–8 Tartans on a serve that went just long. In a frankly melancholic ending to a dominant performance by the Tartans, the last point was won off a tap over the net into open court with no chance of being dug out by the Lady Barons’ libero.
In a total match time of just two minutes over an hour, the Tartans beat the Franciscan University Lady Barons by a score of 3–0 (25–9, 25–9, 25–9). The Tartans began the game by stomping on the gas, and they never let up; the Lady Barons never had a chance. So-Holloway was one of the standout players in the game, with 16 of the Tartans’ 25 assists in the game and 8 service aces—the most by any player on the court—of the team’s 24. Lauren Mueller had the second most service aces, 7, but had zero service errors through all of her attempts. First-year Vivian Beaudoin and senior Sydney Bauer had the most kills and digs, respectively, on the night, with Beaudoin garnering 6 kills and Bauer recording 9 digs. In total, the Tartans had 29 kills to 9 attack errors and 24 service aces to 5 service errors. Franciscan struggled considerably more, with a negative ratio of kills to errors—12 kills to 14 errors—and a negative ratio of service aces to errors—1 ace to 3 errors. On top of that, zero of the 24 services aces by the Tartans hit the court without a Lady Baron hand hitting it; that means all 24 aces by the Tartans were off Lady Baron return errors. The Tartans may have been pushing the envelope the entire game, but the number of errors by the Lady Barons tell that they didn’t put up much of a fight, either.
At the Carnegie Mellon DoubleTree Invitational held on Carnegie Mellon’s campus in Skibo Gymnasium this past weekend, the Tartans swept all four of their opponents to extend their winning streak to nine matches. In the home tournament, they posted 3–0 wins against Marietta College, Kean University, the University of Mount Union, and the University of Mary Washington.
The Tartan volleyball team has been on fire recently, and they hope to keep the momentum going forward, as they have just one week left until the beginning of their conference tournament. On Saturday, September 29, the Tartans will be at Brandeis University to kick off the University Athletic Association (UAA) Round Robin #1.

Welcome back to the second and final part of The Tartan’s MLB regular season wrap-up, this time on the National League.
The National League has not had nearly the disparity of the American League. Nine of the fifteen teams in the N.L. are currently playing better than .500 baseball, but there aren’t any standout powerhouses like in the A.L. The Dodgers, for example, responded to a franchise record setting season in 2017 by ending up, as it stands right now, a game and a half back from the Colorado Rockies. The entire N.L. East is topsy turvy, except for the Marlins occupying last place, which might just happen every year for the rest of time. Who knows? If the season ended today, The Braves, Cubs, Rockies, Brewers, and Cardinals would move into the postseason, but both of those wildcard spots are still up for grabs. Only three teams, the Reds, Marlins, and Padres, have been mathematically eliminated from playoff contention, although most others aren’t far behind. Look for some intense playoff race baseball from the Dodgers, Diamondbacks, and Phillies as they all try to knock out the two N.L. Central wildcard teams.
The Atlanta Braves are a little ahead of schedule this year. After a rocky 72–90 finish last year, they’ve burst into the playoff picture ahead of projections. This has been courtesy of rookie Ronald Acuna Jr. and veterans Nick Markakis and Freddie Freeman slugging their way into contention. The pitching staff has done their duty, with Julio Teheran, Mike Foltynewicz, and trade acquisition Kevin Gausman all putting up excellent numbers. The Braves look like a team that’s going to be in contention for a long time, and what better way to start off the whole thing than with a World Series win?
The Chicago Cubs are pure evil. I have heard that manager Joe Maddon likes to spit on puppies and Anthony Rizzo steals candy from babies with Kris Bryant. Okay, that’s not true at all, and Anthony Rizzo is actually a pretty good guy, but that will never stop me hating the Cubs with everything I’ve got. That 2015 Wildcard game will never stop hurting. Anyway, the Cubs have a great lineup and you probably know their names already. Rizzo, Bryant, a now-skinny Kyle Schwarber, Javier Baez, the list goes on. This team won it all in 2016 for a reason. They’re a good club, top  to bottom. Their pitching isn’t anything to shake a fist at, either. Kyle Hendricks, Jon Lester, and the trade deadline acquisition Cole Hamels all throw mean heat. If this team is rolling in sync, you better watch out. I hope they get knocked out in the first round, though. Go Pirates.
The N.L. West is a little more unpredictable this year. There are three great teams in the Rockies, Dodgers, and Diamondbacks, who are all vying for that top spot in the West. All three of the teams have great pitchers and solid hitters, like Nolan Arenado and Kyle Freeland of the Rockies, Manny Machado and Clayton Kershaw of the Dodgers, and Paul Goldschmidt and Zach Greinke of the Diamondbacks. The West is anybody’s game, but I think that this might be the year that Rocktober returns. Look for those Rockies, but don’t sleep on the Diamondbacks or Dodgers sneaking into a Wildcard spot.
The Milwaukee Brewers are a good team, through and through. They’ve got depth in their lineup, and made some big moves at the trade deadline to add to it. Sluggers like Mike Moustakas, Travis Shaw, and Jesus Aguilar make for a dangerous hitting lineup, but the pitching staff isn’t as good as one would want for a postseason contender. Chase Anderson, Jhoulys Chacin, and Gio Gonzalez help make a pretty strong rotation, but if the Brewers have a weak point, their rotation is certainly it.
The St. Louis Cardinals have used some magic to rocket themselves back into postseason contention after an off year in 2017. They stuck with Matt Carpenter through his hitting struggles, and now he’s on a blistering hot streak and one of the most dangerous leadoff guys in the game again. Marcell Ozuna and Jedd Gyorko also provide a big power boost in their lineup. Miles Mikolas, pulled in from Japan, wasn’t expected to be as dominant as he has been, and Jack Flaherty and John Gant have been just as dangerous on the mound. I could see the Cardinals riding their momentum all the way to the World Series, but they’ve got a long way to go if they end up retaining that second wildcard spot.
In looking at the whole league, my ideal World Series scenario is that the American League’s Oakland Athletics and Braves face one another in the World Series, and the A’s win in seven. Realistically, I think we’re going to be looking at a Red Sox vs. Cubs matchup that will see the Sox sweep the Cubs. I don’t know that any of the teams in the N.L. have the strength or depth to go up against the Red Sox, but it’s baseball, so anything can happen!

At 38 years old and with 18 IndyCar/CART seasons under his belt, you would expect Scott Dixon to be slowing down. In fact, the opposite is happening—on Sept. 16, Dixon took home his fifth drivers’ championship with a second place finish at the Grand Prix of Sonoma.
The race, held at Sonoma Raceway in California, saw Dixon battle it out with title challenger Alexander Rossi for the honor of donning the number one next season. Rossi, who was 29 points behind Dixon in the championship, went into the race with work to do, qualifying four places down on Dixon in sixth. Veteran Ryan Hunter-Reay, though out of the championship picture, started from pole position. Penske drivers Josef Newgarden, the defending champ, and Will Power had an outside shot to swipe the title, starting third and seventh respectively.
There was drama immediately after the green flag was waved, with Rossi bumping the back of teammate Marco Andretti’s car, which broke his front wing and punctured his front right tire. Rossi limped back to the pits, his chances for his first drivers’ title now in jeopardy.
Now down in 25th place, Rossi knew he needed to make an incredible charge to even have a fighting chance against Dixon. He pushed hard, making an excellent pass on Newgarden into the Turn 5 hairpin and battled up to finish seventh. Newgarden’s race had been unraveling since he stalled the car leaving his first pit stop—he finished a disappointing eighth. Power ran a solid race to take a podium. But Dixon’s smart, conservative race led him to a second place finish behind polesitter Hunter-Reay, securing the championship.
With his fifth title, Dixon has entered the ranks of all-time greats—he now stands just two championships behind legend A.J. Foyt. He also moved ahead of Mario Andretti, Sebastien Bourdais, and Dario Franchitti, all with four championships.
Dixon had a strong season, with three wins and six other podiums, along with one pole position. Rossi was a strong competitor—he also had three wins and six separate podiums, but captured three poles. However, he finished outside of the top five seven times, losing ground to Dixon who only did four times.
Dixon’s championship celebrations outshone a commanding win by Hunter-Reay, who led the most laps as he cruised confidently to convert pole to a race win. Power’s third place in the race secured him third in the championship, with Hunter-Reay one place behind. Newgarden’s dispiriting day gave him fifth overall.
Fans also got to see the highly touted Patricio O’Ward in IndyCar machinery for the first time. Having already won the Indy Lights feeder series this year, O’Ward was ready to step up to the top level. He did quite well, despite struggling with tires in the early stages, and finished ninth.
The 2019 IndyCar season will kick off with Grand Prix of St. Petersburg on March 10, and will run for 17 races. The series will visit the Circuit of the Americas, home to Formula One’s United States Grand Prix, for the first time on March 24, and will return to WeatherTech Raceway Laguna Seca for the finale on Sept. 22. Tune back in to watch Dixon defend his title.

Welcome to the Tartan Fantasy Football League Week 2 recap! Once again, my team played tragically, and the Sports Editor was the worst player of the week. This week, some teams bounced back after the first week of the season, while others continued to flounder. Here’s how the week went:
Last Manning Standing over Pillbox 108.64 to 95.66
After a dismal showing last week, Publisher Caleb Miller’s team Last Manning Standing scored the most points in the league in a win over Pillbox Editor Izzy Sio’s team Pillbox. Miller’s team moves to a 1–1 record, while Sio’s is 0–2.
After Thursday’s game, Last Manning Standing held a one-point lead that it never gave up. Jacksonville Jaguars running back Leonard Fournette failed to score a single point, but Miller’s team boasted solid performances across the board: Kansas City Chiefs tight end Travis Kelce scored 22.90 points with 109 receiving yards and two touchdowns, Minnesota Vikings wide receiver Adam Thielen finished with 131 yards through the air and one touchdown for 19.10 points, and Pittsburgh Steelers wide receiver JuJu Smith-Schuster added 18.10 points with 121 yards and 1 touchdown.
Sio’s team Pillbox had a chance to win this matchup, with great performances from Los Angeles Rams running back Todd Gurley (29.30 points from 73 yards from scrimmage and three touchdowns) and Vikings wide receiver Stefon Diggs (26.90 points from 128 yards and two touchdowns). However, much of the team let her down: Los Angeles Chargers wide receiver Keenan Allen, Indianapolis Colts tight end Jack Doyle, and Seattle Seahawks running back Chris Carson all recorded point totals in the single digits, Rams kicker Greg Zuerlein was injured in warmups and therefore did not play, and the Baltimore Ravens defense disappointed with minus-one point.
futbol over Slugs 98.70 to 84.94
This week, undefeated teams futbol, of Visual Editor Tracy Le, and Slugs, of Operations Manager Adam Tunnard, faced off. In the end, Le proved victorious, and moves to a 2–0 record on the season, while Tunnard is now even at 1–1.
Le’s team was carried by two performances. Carolina Panthers quarterback Cam Newton passed for 335 yards and three touchdowns, adding 42 rushing yards, for 27.60 points. Cincinnati Bengals wide receiver A.J. Green caught five passes for 69 yards and three touchdowns, finishing with 24.90 points. Chiefs wide receiver Tyreek Hill and New England Patriots kicker Stephen Gostkowski also had decent weeks, scoring 15 and 8 points, respectively.
Tunnard’s team Slugs’ sole 20-point performance came from Chargers running back Melvin Gordon, who recorded 66 yards from scrimmage and three touchdowns, one passing, two rushing, all for 24.60 points. The team had some solid performances from Green Bay Packers quarterback Aaron Rodgers (16.04 points), Chiefs running back Kareem Hunt (14 points), and Tampa Bay Buccaneers wide receiver Mike Evans (12.30 points), but it wasn’t enough to beat Miller’s Last Manning Standing.
newz over TARTAN FANTASY 100.34 to 95.60
In the closest match of the week, News Editor Nora Mattson’s team newz pulled past Photo Editor Lisa Qian’s team TARTAN FANTASY to continue undefeated (2-0). TARTAN FANTASY now has a record of 1-1.
Mattson’s team newz was led by Houston Texans quarterback Deshaun Watson, who bounced back from Week 1’s lackluster performance with twice as many points, 22.80, from 310 yards through the air and two touchdowns. New Orleans Saints wide receiver was next, scoring 18.90 with 89 receiving yards and two touchdowns. Despite no points from Seahawks wide receiver Doug Baldwin, who is injured, Mattson still managed to take the win.
Qian’s team TARTAN FANTASY fell short despite some strong performances; her vice was leaving so many points on the bench. Chargers quarterback Phillip Rivers passed for 256 yards and three touchdowns for 22.74 points, Texans wide receiver DeAndre Hopkins hauled in six catches for 110 yards and a touchdown en route to 17 points, and the Rams defense finished with 13 points. However, these performances were dragged down by paltry weeks from players who could have been replaced with others on the bench. But alas, such is the unpredictability of fantasy football.
mmichelle123 over Gin and Bear It 92.02 to 68.94
Such unpredictability is the reason why I have been the dead-last and dead-worst player in this league. That, and a mix of bad luck and bad decisions. Pillbox Editor Michelle Madlansacay’s team mmichelle123 scored less this week than in her loss last week. That’s saying something. She moves to an even 1-1 record, while I am winless at 0-2.
Madlansacay’s team mmichelle123 was carried by Vikings quarterback Kirk Cousins, who scored 33.50 points with 425 passing yards and four touchdowns. Packers wide receiver Davante Adams also had a good week, with 12.40 points on 64 yards and a touchdown, but overall, mmichelle123 didn’t have a great week across the board. But a win is a win, I guess.
For my tragic team, Gin and Bear It, Seahawks quarterback Russell Wilson let me down with only 14.74 points, a significant downgrade from last week’s 20.42 points. I remembered to start a running back that was  actually playing, James Conner of the Steelers, who had a decent 14.50 points, but that performance couldn’t hide the fact that four of my seven offensive players finished with less than 10 points. At this point, I’m looking into potential trades, and hoping one of my bench players has a breakout season. If only.
Tune in next Monday to see how the Tartan Fantasy League fared during Week 3 of the NFL season!

Social media giant Facebook has come under scrutiny for their online advertisement targeting system after a charge was filed against the company by the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), the law firm Outten & Golden, and the labor union Communications Workers of America. The complaint asserts that Facebook’s advertising system enabled illegal discrimination against women. 
The charge was filed on behalf of three women (residents of Pennsylvania, Illinois, and Ohio) who were unable to view advertisements for employment on Facebook from 2017 to 2018, and was submitted to the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC), a government agency that deals with discrimination in the workplace. According to the ACLU, the 10 employers who used gender targeting (including window replacement company Renewal by Andersen and the City of Greensboro Police Department in North Carolina) are in traditionally male-dominated fields.
Outten & Golden civil rights lawyer Peter Romer-Friedman says that the practice of limiting employment ads to a specific gender is a violation of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. He believes Facebook is much more than an impartial intermediary. “They're profiting from thousands of ads that are being hidden from women,” Romer-Friedman told NPR.
Galen Sherwin, senior staff attorney for the ACLU’s Women’s Rights Project, thinks modern ad targeting on Facebook is simply a continuation of long-running discrimination in recruitment. “The only difference between Facebook’s ad targeting practice and the sex-segregated classified ads of yore is that Facebook — unlike newspapers, which are distributed to the general public — can actually ensure that specific ads are only delivered to its male or female users,” she said in a post on the ACLU’s website, comparing the phenomenon to “Help wanted: Male” and “Help wanted: Female” ads in The New York Times in the 1960s that prevented women from attaining senior positions.
What should Facebook do to prevent employers from discriminating by gender in their ads? Stop allowing advertisers to target specific genders, ethnicities, or ages on their website, Sherwin recommends. Currently, anyone who is willing to pay for space on Facebook’s massive advertising platform can simply check a box to use the company’s inferred user profiles to limit their content to certain groups. While these capabilities have increased ad profits and click-through rates, they have been controversial since introduction and have put the company in hot water before.
In Aug. 2018, the United States Department of Housing and Urban Development filed an administrative complaint against Facebook alleging that its advertising tools allow real estate owners to engage in housing discrimination, a violation of the Fair Housing Act. Earlier that month, the company announced that they were removing over 5,000 targeting options to “prevent misuse” of their platform after they were subject to an exhaustive investigation into discrimination by King County, Washington.
Romer-Friedman thinks Facebook hasn’t yet acted on the charge of gender discrimination because it is too valuable of a revenue source for executives to consider preventing it. “We know now that this is a leadership problem, from the top down. This is not a technical problem. They could solve this in an afternoon,” he said.
While the lawyers behind the charge are adamant that Facebook should change their ways, the company isn’t bowing to outside pressure. In a statement, spokesperson Joe Osborne insisted that “there is no place for discrimination on Facebook; it’s strictly prohibited in our policies.”
Similarly, the companies cited in the complaint deny allegations of gender targeting in their ads. Adam May, a spokesperson for Renewal by Andersen, refused to comment on specifics but told NPR, “We are an equal opportunity employer, and we are proud of the diversity of our workforce,” adding that the primary focus for Renewal by Andersen is to “build a talented and dedicated team, regardless of who those folks might be.” 
Public information officer Ron Glenn made similar remarks in defense of the Greensboro Police Department. “We are committed to seeking and hiring an inclusive and diverse workforce. We adhere to our city's policy of diversity and inclusion,” he said, clarifying that “Facebook is one channel of an extensive recruiting strategy for the Greensboro Police Department.” 
Ultimately, it is in the hands of the EEOC to decide whether to move forward with the charge. According to the ACLU, millions of women were potentially denied the opportunity to view advertisements for employments. Romer-Friedman is confident that this violation is significant enough for the EEOC to act. He said, “The ten [employers] we identified today in the charges are, we think, a sample of the much larger numbers of employers that have done this.” Even if the federal government doesn’t file a lawsuit, the ACLU likely will.

Imagine a deep sea fish. Are you picturing large eyes, sharp teeth, maybe even a light extending from its head? You’re probably seeing something along the lines of an anglerfish, a la Finding Nemo. How about something more translucent, small, and scale-less? “Jelly-like,” even? 
The elusive “jelly-like” snailfish is one of many deep sea creatures that makes its home in the oceanic trenches. Its appearance is wildly different from other creatures in the harsh deep-sea environment, and there are over 400 described species of its kind — one of which is the deepest living fish ever recorded, the Mariana snailfish. However, there is an even greater number of undescribed species — a theme common in the study of deep sea creatures and their habitats. But recently, after exploring the depths of the ninth deepest trench in the world, a multinational team of over 40 scientists discovered three new species of snailfish: the pink snailfish, the blue snailfish, and the purple snailfish.
These new species reside in the intense cold and extreme pressure of the Atacama Trench, which lines the coast of Peru and Chile, reaching a maximum depth of about five miles and approximate length of 3,666 miles. The scale-less snailfish are top predators, thriving in this normally inhospitable environment.
In an article by ScienceDaily, Dr. Thomas Linley, one of the team’s UK scientists who hails from Newcastle University, speaks about the adaptations of the Atacama snailfish: “Their gelatinous structure means they are perfectly adapted to living at extreme pressure and, in fact, the hardest structures in their bodies are the bones in their inner ear which give them balance and their teeth. Without the extreme pressure and cold to support their bodies, they are extremely fragile and melt rapidly when brought to the surface.”
Dr. Linley is no stranger to snailfish. As part of a similar expedition in 2017, he and a team of researchers from the U.S. and U.K. set out to recover samples of a potentially unique species of snailfish documented by Japanese scientists earlier that year. Their efforts revealed footage of a new species — the Mariana snailfish. Named after the trench it inhabits, the fish was found at a depth of over 26,800 feet and was the deepest living fish ever found.
So how did they manage to document fish nearly five miles deep into the ocean? By using new technology developed by Newcastle University engineers and scientists that allows more efficient exploration of “ultra deep environments” using a unique “lander” system. Two “landers” (types of rovers) were outfitted with HD cameras and traps to hunt the elusive fish. After sinking thousands of feet to the ocean floor, the landers were able to take samples and record the environment. After 12 to 24 hours of waiting, the research team deployed an “acoustic signal” to a trap connected to the lander, triggering weights to fall off the lander so it could float back up to the surface.
The most recent snailfish expedition deployed the landers 27 times at the deepest point of the Atacama Trench, known as Richard’s Deep, to record 100 hours of video and 11,468 photographs. Researchers were able to catch one for observation, carefully monitoring its habitat to ensure its survival. While the process seems lengthy and time-consuming, the results were rewarding: three new species discovered on the floor of the ocean, one of which they were able to capture. 
As an extra surprise, the team also recorded an incredibly rare species of long-legged isopods called munnopsids. Isopods, an order of the class crustacean, are a type of invertebrate that look more like bugs than crabs. The most familiar isopod is the pill bug or, as it is colloquially known, the “roly poly.” However, unlike their tiny terrestrial cousins, munnopsids are about the size of an adult human’s hand and they have a unique way of moving about. The creatures swim backwards and upside down, almost paddling with their tummies "before righting themselves on the seafloor and spreading their long walking legs out like a spider,” Dr. Linley remarked. “We don’t know what species of munnopsid these are, but it’s incredible to have caught them in action in their natural habitat – especially the flip they do as they switch from swimming to walking mode.”
These discoveries point to the unimaginable biodiversity that lurks in the deepest parts of our oceans. They serve as an awe-inspiring reminder of how incredibly hardy and tough nature can be, and how life can evolve to not only survive but thrive in those environments. Those interested in experiencing some of this biodiversity can view the captured snailfish at Newcastle University, where it will be featured as part of the Challenger Conference 2018.

Apple's Sept. 12 reveal of its new XS Max — the company's largest phone yet — generated excitement in the tech world. That was predictable. 
The less predictable response? Exasperation.
The day after the phone's release, a Twitter thread from well-known techno-sociologist Zeynep Tufekci had tech scholars asking: Is the XS Max too big for women's hands?
"'We want to reach as many customers as we can with this incredible technology,' Apple marketing chief Phil Schiller said, without irony, while Apple phased out the only phone I can hold without risking dropping. Stuck with Apple for security reasons," tweeted Tufekci on Sept. 13.
Feminists and media scholars from around the world immediately jumped into the discussion, and most agreed with Tufekci. "It’s so painful to experience @apple’s descent from making technology people love to making technology which they feel held hostage by on account of the sheer irresponsibility of other options. Just give me a human sized phone... please," tweeted Chris Peterson, an information researcher at MIT, in response to Tufekci.
The XS and XS Max are Apple's new flagship devices; Apple is discontinuing their predecessor, the iPhone X, only a year after its announcement and 10 months after it went on sale.
"Women like me with small hands who need the most secure phone for safety reasons are stuck with something they can't hold and constantly risk dropping," continued Tufekci's Twitter thread. "[Apple] could even — gasp — introduce a newer small phone. Take away whatever bells and whistles you want. Androids aren't safe or secure, and the only maybe feasible alternative, Google Pixel, is also too big... Given my line of work, I simply cannot use Android phones.... I'm stuck with discomfort, inconvenience and replacing screens."
The average women's hand size (6.9 inches) is a full inch smaller than the average men's hand size (7.9 inches), and a very small percentage of women have larger hand sizes than the male average. The numbers back Tufekci up: the XS and the XS Max, at 5.8 inches and 6.5 inches respectively, fit larger hands much more comfortably.
Of course, too-big phones are only a symptom of the real problem: Apple doesn't design for women.
Often, when we think of designing 'for women,' we think of products marketed specifically to women, as a special demographic. But as the iPhone XS highlights, products designed for 'everyone' are too often just designed for men. 
Apple's product design and branding is legendary. But if their design leaves out women — half of all people — is it really good design? 
Last year, when Apple's new headquarters opened, commentators noted the glaring lack of any childcare options in a $5 billion campus that includes seven cafes, a 100,000 square foot fitness facility, 600 electric car charging stations, and a visitor center selling exclusive Apple merchandise.
"Every molecule of the campus was designed within an inch of its life. They designed the door handles, the specific angle of the windows, the goddamn pizza boxes," explained tech writer Cassie Murdoch when the center was unveiled in May 2017. "They didn’t forget to put a daycare in, they just didn’t want one."
Sophie Walker, leader of the Women’s Equality Party in the U.K., told The Telegraph, "Apple's UK Headquarters has a gender pay gap of 24 per cent, and men's bonuses are 57 per cent higher than women's. So do I think the boys at the top consider women when making design decisions? No I don't."
"The boys at Apple are obviously obsessed with size but sometimes performance matters too."

Imagine a future in which humanity wants to expand its domain to distant stars and colonize other planets, but that all the sci-fi stories had it wrong, that faster-than-light travel really is impossible. Could we still conquer the final frontier?
Alpha Centauri, the star nearest to our solar system, is 4.5 light years away. The closest known Earth-like planet is 12 light years away, orbiting Ross 128. Even if we build ships that can approach relativistic speeds, actually traveling to other star systems would take several generations for those on board the ship. Time dilation gets the opportunity to wreak even more havoc, because different parts of the galaxy are moving at different times relative to each other, causing events that seem simultaneous on Earth to appear out of sync on other planets. On top of all this, space is expanding exponentially. Galaxies far, far away are getting even further away, some of them faster than the speed of light, as the space between our galaxies inflates.
Even simple communication between colonies and the homeworld would be limited to the speed of light, meaning several decades of delay for a message roundtrip. This is a significant barrier to political cohesion. History has shown time and again that the span of a civilization is limited by the speed of communication. At the highest point of the Roman Empire, the fastest trip from Britannia to Rome would have taken 30 days, as shown in ORBIS, an interactive travel map from Stanford University. In case of a crisis, it would take at least two months for the Emperor to hear of a problem and to send instructions for a course of action. When the idea of colonialism swept through western Europe in the 1600s, ships relied on good winds during the two month journey to make it across the treacherously large Atlantic Ocean.
One solution to the long journey would be to put the passengers’ lives on pause by slowing down down their metabolism with long term hibernation, or halting it entirely with cryogenics. Such a ship would be fully automated, with systems in place to attend to the precious cargo. Upon arrival, an army of robots would assemble the basic necessities of survival, repurposing the ship as a temporary shelter. The colonists would wake up to the beginnings of functioning city, where they could start a new life far away from anything the have ever known. Choosing the life of a colonist and abandoning any prospect of life on one’s home planet requires a lot of incentives, however.
Even with apparently insurmountable challenges in the way, there are multiple reasons why humanity might wish to colonize other planets. Overcrowding on Earth may push some to look for a new place to put down roots. The prospect of new research or insatiable curiosity might push others to explore far away star systems, and return with invaluable data on quasars, planetary nebulae, and possibly extraterrestrial lifeforms. The wealth of information waiting to be discovered and applied to improving our technology is incalculable. The sites of recent supernovae are likely to be resource-rich, and mining asteroids could be the future for extraction of rare metals. But in the most long-term sense, spreading to other planets increases the chances of our survival as a species, and maybe one of the most important stepping stones in the history of life on Earth. 
If you find yourself interested in delving into the details of complex ethical and scientific dilemmas, or if you enjoy inspecting the future of technology from multiple angles, join us in Wean 5310, every Thursday at 5:30 p.m. Come for the pizza, stay for the discourse!

When the main character finally gets the love interest, the audience is supposed to cheer for them, be elated – overjoyed, even. It’s the moment of joy that the whole movie has been building up to, leading to a satisfying and heartwarming end. However, as I watched Sierra Burgess finally kiss her love interest, Jamey, I found myself yelling “Nooo!” at the top of my lungs.
The Netflix original Sierra Burgess is a Loser is a teen romcom centered around the titular character, Sierra Burgess. Sierra is an overweight band geek, surrounded by the typical high school mean girls reminiscent of Mean Girls or Heathers. The “Regina George” of the school, Veronica, gives Sierra’s number to cute football player Jamey, and Sierra subsequently decides to catfish him for two weeks. She teams up with Veronica to dupe Jamey in exchange for tutoring, and the pair successfully manage to orchestrate a carefully coordinated FaceTime call, a real life date, and several in-person meetups. In this, an unlikely friendship between Veronica and Sierra develops, but as her fake relationship with Jamey gets more and more out of hand, Sierra gets a little too desperate to keep up the charade. After seeing Veronica kiss Jamey, Sierra decides to hack Veronica’s Instagram account and spread the fact that Veronica once got dumped over DM. As a result, their friendship crumbles, Jamey finds out that he’s been catfished, and Veronica becomes the biggest loser in the school. In an attempt to repair her relationships, Sierra writes a song expressing her feelings and plays it for each of her friends; this ends up being more than enough, and Sierra manages to fix everything and go to the homecoming dance with Jamey, finally getting the guy.
While this ending is supposed to be a big victory, it comes off as empty and slimy considering everything Sierra has done up until this point. Sierra Burgess may not be a loser, but she is most certainly a terrible person. Aside from catfishing a poor man, she kisses him without his consent, hacks her friend’s Instagram account, spreads an embarrassing photo of that same friend, and repeatedly lies and flakes on her best friend. We as an audience have no reason to empathize with Sierra, because she’s a terrible person. The weak introduction of her body insecurities is not enough for an audience to empathize with her, and she seemingly goes out of her way to trick poor Jamey over and over. But strangely enough, the movie seems to push the audience to root for her – every bad thing she does is followed with some positive dialogue about how they had a “moment” or a “connection.” Her terribleness, though, is not the issue. Protagonists can be a terrible people – it can be incredibly interesting to see their arc as they grow, but that’s the problem – Sierra doesn’t grow as a character. She never learns from her mistakes, nor do we see her realize that her actions were bad and have consequences.
Those are the reasons why the ending had felt so off. She had done nothing to earn everyone’s trust back, and there is no good reason for her to get the perfect happy ending. The song she crafts at the end is very self-focused: it is about her feelings and her feelings alone, and it serves as more of a justification for her actions rather than an apology – which is what it should’ve been. After abandoning her best friend for a guy, hacking an Instagram account, and catfishing a guy for 2 weeks, all Sierra does is focus on herself. She doesn’t acknowledge the pain she’s caused everyone else, so she never learns that what she did was, in fact, terrible. Jamey even tells her at the end that what she did was “bad, like, really bad,” and she somehow turns that into a justification for her actions – she had felt like the “whole world is against her.” Her feelings are valid, real experiences that teens have, but the speed at which the movie tosses aside her catfishing – which, by the way, is legally dicey – shocked me. Sierra receives no repercussions for her actions. The most she gets punished is by her father, who attempts to ground her after she comes home drunk one night; even then, it’s unclear as her mother and father drift offscreen to discuss her punishment. Somehow, after everything she’s done, her single non-apology song is enough for everyone in her life to forgive her. The movie actually rewards her for her terrible behavior, strangely placing catfishing into a positive light. If anything, a better ending for the movie would’ve been Sierra going to Jamey to advocate for Veronica instead of the other way around, so that Veronica ends up with Jamey. This would’ve been a more direct apology and an active attempt on Sierra’s part to selflessly ameliorate the situation, something that is desperately missing from this movie.
Sierra Burgess is a Loser falls shorter than short when it comes to teen romcoms. As much as I appreciated the “unconventional lead” – though even this is a stretch, because Sierra is a pretty girl – that issue of insecurity and self-esteem was barely explored in this movie. This casting felt more like a pat on the back rather than an aim for better body diversity, which makes the movie feel even cheaper than it already does. In addition, what little humor in the movie was often at the expense of the LGBTQ+ and disabled communities; a cheap joke instead hides positive deaf representation as Sierra pretends to be deaf to avoid exposing herself as a catfish. The issue of consent was a big issue in one of the defining moments of the movie, as Sierra kisses Jamey without his knowledge. Sierra clearly understands boundaries as, in a later scene, we see her avoiding someone trying to kiss her shirt, yet she doesn’t understand the fundamental wrongness of the kiss. It’s weird opposing ideas like this that make the movie more confusing than nuanced.
The only good things about this movie are RJ Cyler as Sierra’s sassy friend Dan – who is himself another stereotype – and Noah Centineo as love interest Jamey. Dan provides a good balance of humor, often speaking as the voice of the audience and constantly criticizing Sierra’s actions, only to be ignored. Centineo does a great job capturing the rather one-dimensional character of Jamey, but his charm and dorkiness prevent the character from seeming too dull. If anything, watch this movie for them.

Mission Impossible: Fallout, released on July 27, 2018, is the latest addition to the over two decade old Mission Impossible franchise. Despite the longevity of the series, the latest entry doesn’t disappoint. Fallout stands out from its predecessors with an engaging plot line and crucial character development, but also ties in with the rest of the films by bringing back old characters and sticking with the death-defying action sequences that have always defined the Tom Cruise films. Characters such as Julia Hunt, Ilsa, and Solomon Lane, as well as the core team of Benji and Luther make for strong individual performances. Unlike the more recent films, Fallout isn’t just another Ethan Hunt story. 
Rebecca Ferguson’s Ilsa is nothing short of Ethan Hunt’s female counterpart. Her entrance into the film was arguably the best and she proves crucial to the team as the movie progresses. Strong-willed and brave, with a backstory developed throughout the previous films, she steals every scene she appears in. Henry Cavill’s August Walker was also a treat to watch. Despite the huge contrast to his notable role as Superman, Cavill still pulls off a good villain alongside Sean Harris’ Solomon Lane. The strong contrast between Solomon Lane and August Walker adds depth to the darker side of the film. Walker plays Ethan Hunt’s physical opponent while Lane plays on Hunt’s emotional turmoil. The combination of both characters put Hunt through more in this latest mission than any of his previous ones. 
This film stands out as more than an action film with its emphasis on Hunt’s character, or what I’d call the humanization of Hunt. First off, the action sequences are more believable. They aren’t any less dangerous than the scaling of the Burj Khalifa, but  they are woven into the film more seamlessly, instead of the plot fitting around the action. Secondly, Ethan Hunt’s heroics were motivated by human reasons. Throughout the majority of the franchise, Hunt rushes to save the world alongside his team simply because his moral compass is in the right place. He may not have been a superhero in a cape, but he had the heart of one. It gave his stunts a more superhero quality as well. In Fallout, Ethan’s rush to save the world becomes more personal with the increased screen time of his wife, Julia Hunt. One of the most pivotal interactions in the film for Hunt’s character is between Hunt, Julia, and Solomon Lane. It underscores Ethan’s greatest fear, losing his wife to the danger that surrounds his work. His fear comes to life in the final moments of the film, making the climax of the film heartbreaking and the final helicopter sequence more believable and integral to the development of Hunt’s character. Ethan Hunt becomes a man fighting his worst fears, and grows stronger for it at the end of the film. Fallout stands out from the rest of the films in the franchise by giving its protagonist more growth than all of the previous films combined. 
All of this aside, Mission Impossible: Fallout is still an action film, and an excellent one at that. Action sequences, such as the bathroom fight, the bike chase through Paris, the parachute jump and many more make Fallout any action’s lover’s dream. Keeping with Mission Impossible tradition, Fallout has a compelling plot full of twists and turns, and its action sequences are harrowing, with lives hanging in the balance until the last second of the film. The movie doesn’t slow down from start to finish. Brief comedic sequences keep the film lighthearted as well. Visual effects were never overdone since Tom Cruise was performing his own stunts as per usual.
Knowing this fact only makes each stunt more fascinating to watch. The film is a reflection of Tom Cruise’s commitment to his action sequences. At 56 years old, the actor did his own stunts, breaking two of his ankle bones in the process. He also trained 16 hours a day to get a pilot license for the final helicopter sequence and jumped off a helicopter 106 times for the parachute sequence. All-new gear was developed for Tom Cruise’s parachute jump just so his face could be seen. The scene only lasted two to three minutes in the movie, but the making of it took well over three months. The payoff could be seen on screen, making Fallout the best entry into the franchise.
Mission Impossible: Fallout is an effective culmination of the films thus far, but still leaves loose ends for the films to come. The Apostles are still out there and Ethan Hunt’s next mission, should he choose to accept it, will most likely tie in there to add another bold, daring, action-packed film to the Mission Impossible franchise.

Late-night TV has become a significant platform for political discussion in the media as well as an echo chamber for critics of President Trump. Since Trump announced his bid for the presidency, he has been the target of endless mockery from late night TV hosts. The jokes always write themselves, with each tweet, antic, or new policy development increasingly looking like a South Park episode come to life. 
It was funny for a while, but after three years, it’s definitely grown stale.
Coming from a person who agrees with the jokes, at this point they’ve become oversaturated. The problem isn’t the fact that they make fun of the Trump administration, but how redundant and ineffective the commentary is. There are two aspects to this that need to be evaluated: late-night TV as a work of comedy, and late-night TV as political commentary.
As comedy, late-night TV isn’t inherently boring. Most of the material is pretty solid, with zingers and clever jokes that elicit light chuckling or the occasional laugh. The issue is that Trump jokes are so one-note and repetitive, with all the hosts saying different versions of the same thing. Despite the President’s erratic tendencies, there is predictability in his unpredictability, which becomes the source for a lot of the punchlines. The President said that 3,000 people didn’t die in Puerto Rico? Make some joke about how the Presidency keeps hitting new lows. The daily format doesn’t help, likely prompting the writers to go for easier jokes; it’s already tiring to hear about him on a daily basis through media coverage, so unoriginal nightly jokes just make things worse. Many of these shows were also apolitical prior to Trump, which further solidifies just how easy and it is to use Trump as a source of comedy and a gateway into politics.
As commentary, it’s very poor. Now, of course, many will defend this by stating that these hosts are comedians first, and their main job is to entertain. This is fair to acknowledge, and I agree. However, when the jokes you make are about something relevant to the real world, then it must also be evaluated on the basis of what it says about the real world. The commentary is asinine for the most part: late-night TV hosts will get applause for saying our President is a narcissist with several scandals five times a week. Their target audience, most of them Democrats or left-leaning individuals, exalt them for being so “woke,” and then go to sleep, comfortable with the fact that their views are being reaffirmed in an echo chamber of like-minded people.
Something Jon Stewart understood incredibly well about political commentary is that you had to focus on the costs associated with bad decision processes. He would spent entire segments just looking at one specific Congressional meeting, dissecting the ineptitude of Congressional leaders and really highlighting how nothing was being done. The Colbert Report did very well with its own twist, as does Trevor Noah to a lesser extent (since Noah falls into the same trap of cheap Trump jokes as other current late night hosts). Last Week Tonight with John Oliver takes this principle even further than Stewart, spending upwards of thirty minutes on a topic and really diving into the costs of bad decision processes, with only briefer jabs at Trump for the most part — though it is important to note the inherent left-leaning bias.
Late-night TV hosts are a small subset of Trump critics, but many of them exhibit everything wrong with how political criticism is approached. There is so much focus on Trump as a person and on his specific actions, but what really needs attention is the administration as a whole, its failures, and what it costs the nation. In fact, if anything, Trump himself should be mentioned less or not even mentioned at all. When Jon Stewart or Michael Moore made fun of the Bush administration, no one was really talking about Bush. In the modern political landscape, the same should be true in order for criticism to be effective. Trump thrives off the attention he gets, and it distracts us from the real issues at hand. But taking that attention away while focusing on what his administration neglects or is responsible for is a far more effective strategy, and it transcends the self-congratulatory echo chamber that late night TV has become.
The Democratic Party has an opportunity to retake the House — if not the senate — with mounting frustrations against the administration from the general public. But they have failed to capitalize on this simply because they spend so much time focusing on the wrong issues. Democrats’ tactic for criticizing Trump is the same as late-night TV hosts, which is to focus on Trump himself while claiming the moral high ground. This doesn’t do anything, as the Democrats also have to contend with their own scandals and reputation, and it doesn’t change the minds of those who don’t care about what Trump does or says individually. The only way for Democrats to get through to voters is to present them with something that forces them to fundamentally reevaluate the way they view the administration, judging based on whether or not Trump’s policies are actually good for the nation. Until then, just like late-night TV hosts, their criticisms are empty and meaningless.

You’ll find everything you’re searching for in 2018’s best thriller, Searching.
To be honest, I didn’t expect much from Searching when I first heard of it. I’d heard that it was yet another movie about a father trying to find their lost child. I’d heard that it took place almost entirely on laptop and smartphone screens. I’d heard that John Cho, most famous for Harold and Kumar and Star Trek, was the star. I was impressed that a mainstream Hollywood thriller starring an Asian-American actor even existed, but I didn’t think the tired premise could pull me in. I’ve seen the mystery play out thousands of times already, so what could Searching do that thousands of other movies, books, TV shows, games, plays, and more haven’t done before? As it turns out, a lot. A whole lot. I went in thinking it’d be mediocre; I left thinking it’s a modern classic. 
Searching is a thriller, but it sets up a better mystery than any actual mystery movie I’ve ever watched. Searching is just as revolutionary as Crazy Rich Asians in terms of positive Asian representation in Hollywood movies, but far more original and captivating. I certainly loved Crazy Rich Asians, but it admittedly tread the same ground that has been trodden for decades. Searching, on the other hand, is filled with innovative ideas and plots. The main gimmick is that most of the movie takes place through screens. In a few segments of the movie, you just watch main protagonist’s David Kim’s (John Cho) mouse pointer move across the screen and click links and pictures. While such scenes may seem incredibly boring, you have to trust me. Director Aneesh Chaganty is definitely a talent to watch; some of the seemingly boring scenes are the most emotional and tense I have watched all year. Chaganty put more emotion into a dad moving his mouse pointer across the screen than some other movies where you actually see the actors’ faces. 
When you first heard of this movie, you may have been thinking of a 2014 film that relied on a similar gimmick: Unfriended. I watched this movie last year, and I can say with confidence that the only reason I enjoyed it was because the majority of the movie depicted a Skype call. Without that interesting touch, Unfriended would be just another campy, overly gory slasher. That said, don’t let it dissuade you from watching Searching. Searching goes leaps and bounds beyond Unfriended in terms of advancing this burgeoning subgenre. More importantly, it would still be a fantastic movie with a spectacular plot and amazing actors, even without the social media gimmick. 
Searching is the kind of movie that is hard to talk about without spoiling twenty completely different things. It’s the kind of movie where one random sentence hidden in one random corner at the very beginning of the movie foreshadows the ending. It’s the kind of movie where plot twists are layered on top of plot twists stacked on top of other plot twists. Most movies with so many twists and so much misdirection falter in the end, and, admittedly, Searching faltered a bit as well. For a movie with such a complex mystery, most of David’s discoveries actually seemed fairly believable; there was one revelation near the end that felt a little contrived, but another revelation five minutes after made up for it in spades. 
With all that said, it’s probably time to actually describe the plot a bit. David Kim is somewhat estranged from his daughter, Margot Kim (Michelle La) for reasons I won’t elaborate on. He also has a bad relationship with his brother, Peter Kim (Joseph Lee). However, when Margot goes missing one night, David does everything he can to find Margot, estrangement be damned. Detective Rosemary Vick (Debra Messing), a powerful and well-respected detective in the San Jose PD, helps David’s search in any way she can. And that’s pretty much all I can say without spoiling a lot. My friends and I were gasping in shock and excitement every five minutes near the end of the movie. 
There’s one more important thing you should know: all the actors are fantastic. Chaganty and writer Sev Ohanian truly bring out the actors' innate potential. Searching has a lot of misdirection, but also a lot of beautiful character development and family moments. La and Lee had only appeared in the most minor of minor roles before Searching, but you wouldn’t know it from their performances. Messing and Cho are most well known for their comedic roles, but this movie allows them to flex their dramatic muscles. Chaganty has said multiple times that the part of David was written specifically for Cho, and I don’t doubt his claim at all. All in all, if you’re looking for a fresh, interesting thriller, your search can stop with Searching.

Unless you’ve been living under a rock for the past nine months, chances are you’re probably familiar with the films Black Panther and Crazy Rich Asians. It's equally likely that you’ve read and heard all about how these two films are transforming Hollywood and the movie industry, breaking down racial boundaries for actors and actresses, combating the hateful tides of racism, and empowering minority youths all around the world.
That certainly sounds impressive, but the impact that these films have had is severely overhyped. Now don’t get me wrong: both movies were engaging and fun to watch, and they both have excellent entertainment value. But just having a predominantly minority cast is about as far as they go in terms of social progressivism. And yes, I know that Black Panther alluded strongly to slavery and racism within the film itself, but that still doesn’t justify praising it as revolutionary, or as an absolute breakthrough.
The reason is simple: just having a minority cast is not enough. In fact, it has the opposite effect. After all, isn’t it ironic that we exalt these films as exemplars of diversity and inclusion when their cast composition is anything but? For movies—or any media, for that matter—to truly leave their mark, the content itself must be meaningful and thought provoking, leaving the audience with a lasting impression and an urge to further discuss the central issue long after the ending credits. Otherwise, any perceived impact is at best superficial and short-lived.
That’s where films like Black Panther and Crazy Rich Asians fall short. Rather than leaving an impression on the audience through its social commentary or writing, both films rely instead on a peripheral factor, that being the ethnicity of their actors. Not only does this mean that these films will have a transient effect, but it also reinforces the dangerous idea that the message of the film may not be as important as the actors playing in it, and that championing diversity is as simple as casting minority talents.
Going back to Black Panther: as I previously noted, Black Panther does focus a lot on slavery and oppression and the unfair treatment of African Americans in American society. It’s an important issue, and one we continue to grapple with. The message isn’t the problem; rather, it’s the context in which it was delivered. From the outset, a superhero movie is not the best platform from which to preach about social integration and racial equality, as the inherent element of fantasy dilutes the gravity of the topic at hand (Marvel’s super-science is basically another word for magic). Furthermore, despite Killmonger’s radical stance on the racial power dynamic and his aim on global domination, it might not have been the best idea to villainize someone who is fervently anti-slavery and anti-oppression (as evidenced by his ending—and rather explicit—monologue), though I am in no way advocating for radicalism.
There are, however, films that do it right when it comes to social commentary, and an excellent example would be Spike Lee’s BlacKkKlansman. Though on the surface it may feel like nothing more than a buddy cop comedy, it’s really a brilliant and scathing denunciation of racist and hateful white supremacist organizations such as the Neo Nazis and the Ku Klux Klan. And, might I add, it features winning performances from both black and white actors.
Admittedly, BlacKkKlansman was a bit preachy and over-the-top at times, but its success comes from the fact that the film invested in its screenplay and its content more than anything else, creating an engaging narrative that was moored in reality, set in Colorado Springs in the early 1970s (I won’t spoil anything here). With a solid historical foundation, the film lost none of its shock value, steering away from fantastical scenarios while delivering its blunt message full-force.
Therein lies the difference: none of these films are perfect, but I guarantee you that BlacKkKlansman left a deeper impression on audiences than Black Panther or Crazy Rich Asians, prompting viewers to think more critically about race relations and racial inequality. And given the current state of our politics and society, these are the films we need more of.
Once again, I’m not saying that Black Panther or Crazy Rich Asians are bad movies. They’re all good films, and if you haven’t seen them, then you should. Rather, what I’m arguing is that we should give credit where credit is due and leave the social commentary to the movies that are designed accordingly. In the end, when it comes to social reform through cinema, there’s a right and a wrong way to go about it.

Not everyone likes rap, but every person I’ve talked to has at least heard of Eminem. It’s not that surprising, however. As a 15-time Grammy winner, Eminem has reached legendary status in the music industry. His road to greatness was full of obstacles - a poor background, an absent father, an abusive mother - making his success even more uplifting and inspirational. 
I first heard Eminem (and hip-hop in general) when I was in middle school in China. My friends blasted “Love the Way You Lie” from Eminem’s 7th album Recovery as we played video games, and I was hooked not by Rihanna’s catchy hook, but by Eminem’s thumping rap verses. After that, I started looking him up myself and streaming his older songs, like “Without Me,” “Lose Yourself,” “Mockingbird,” “’Till I Collapse,” and so on. The things I love about Eminem, and what I think distinguishes him from most other rappers, are the emotions and energy he puts into his delivery. Words spew from his mouth like a fast-flowing river, as I the listener sit on a raft, barely able to keep my balance but enjoying every moment of the ride. 
Maybe it was because of my high expectations that I was disappointed by Revival, his ninth studio album, which came out in 2017. First of all, just by briefly skimming through the tracklist, one can see that it was filled with features. Of course, there is nothing wrong with features - this formula has worked out really well for Eminem, evident in the success of “Love the Way You Lie” and “The Monster.” His previous album The Marshall Mathers LP 2, also included lots of features. On Revival, however, he had really gone over the top. Additionally, his rap verses had become more monotone and lacking in flow. Moreover, his bars on some of the tracks, such as “Heat”, or the single “River” featuring Ed Sheeran, sound very awkward. Other songs, like “Framed”, have decent rap verses, but then the hook kicks in and ruins the whole feel of the song. Overall, the production was lazy, badly planned, and the three singles from the album (“Walk on Water”, “River”, “Nowhere Fast”) were all very questionable. 
Critics’ responses were polarized, but most people can agree on one thing: Revival is the worst Eminem album. Eminem, of course, had been hearing these criticisms since the album’s release. In a remix of the song “Chloraseptic” released in January, he threw in extra verses in response, with lyrics such as “‘Walk on Water’ sucked? B****, suck my d***.” 
Maybe that’s why when Eminem dropped Kamikaze on Aug. 31, some of his fans weren’t so surprised. Eminem has dropped many diss tracks in his career, so why not a whole diss album? In 12 out of the 13 tracks on Kamikaze's tracklist, Eminem takes shots at people he either dislikes, or who have criticized him in the past, ranging from rap artists and singers to music critics and government officials. 
All of these tracks were written, recorded, mixed, and produced in less than a year, and yet this album to me is a truer album than Revival. His inflated ego and flamboyant hostility make a comeback in many of the tracks such as “The Greatest” (not hard to see from the title), “Not Alike”, where he called his alter-ego Slim Shady a “demi-god” and rapper Machine Gun Kelly a “blond fairy cornball”; and “Fall”, one of my personal favorites, where he again emphasizes his greatness and his legendary status. The production is also much cleaner, and his flow reminds me more of some of his old albums.
The release of Kamikaze has caused an uproar in the music industry. Many of the people Eminem dissed on the album have given their responses. The most famous of these is probably Machine Gun Kelly’s diss track “Rap Devil,” a name chosen to mirror Eminem’s self-proclaimed “Rap God” title. These responses, however, are exactly what Eminem welcomes. The purpose of Kamikaze is equivalent to the WWII Kamikaze planes, with Eminem as the pilot. He’s throwing himself at those he sees as “enemies”, resulting in a powerful explosion. To me, music is just a tool for artists to channel their inner thoughts and emotions, which in Kamikaze is anger. Revival did not revive Eminem’s career: Kamikaze does, in his signature way.

Over this weekend, two very different comedies will be screening in McConomy Auditorium: Love, Simon and Sorry to Bother You. 
Love, Simon is a charming and funny coming-of-age story focused on the titular character, Simon (Nick Robinson), who is a closeted gay high school student. The film isn’t anything particularly special, but for what it is, it’s generally well done, paying homage to classic 80s teen rom coms while adding its own set of twists to the genre and its tropes. All the cast members are on point, with the standout performance coming from Nick Robinson as the protagonist. Most of the film’s humor lands well, although a lot of it is more in the realm of earning a light chuckle than making your stomach hurt from laughing.  What makes the film stand out from the large sea of romantic comedies is how honest and painful the film can get. Character choices have consequences that makes the audience care about and relate to them. The film also handles the subject matter of Simon’s orientation very sensitively. Rather than treating it as an exclusive part of his identity that the film harps on for manipulative dramatic effect, the writers integrate his orientation seamlessly into the narrative. Overall, if you are looking for a fun and pleasing film to watch alone or with friends this weekend, Love, Simon is certainly worthy of your time, and you’ll leave the theater with a smile on your face. 
On the completely opposite end of the spectrum is Sorry to Bother You, an absurdist arthouse comedy that falls into the genre of “what on earth did I just watch?” Set in an alternate universe, the film follows an Oakland resident, Cassius Green (Lakeith Stanfield), who rises in the world of corporate telemarketing by using his “white voice” to sell products to customers, and events spiral out of control the higher he climbs up the corporate ladder. The film throws itself full force into its unique and stylistic blend of satire, parody, and absurdism, with a unique and eclectic set of characters, all representing exaggerated versions of people in the real world. It touches on modern capitalism, race relations, entertainment, protest, and art, and does so in a way that never gets preachy. Much of the humor will simultaneously leave the audience laughing out loud and squirming in discomfort. The world created in the film is rich and full of life, with a lot of visual humor foreshadowing later events in the story. If there is any flaw with the film, it’s that it drags when it occasionally ditches the absurdist humor. But overall, Sorry to Bother You is a giant, colorful, insane, unpredictable, and ambitious middle finger to everyone, and while it’s not perfect, it’s certainly a must-watch for anyone looking for a unique, well-directed comedy.

Dear Michelle, 
I feel like I’m not enjoying or learning anything from my classes. I just started college, and I’m already dreading all my assignments...I thought once I got to here, I’d finally get to study all the subjects I’m actually interested in. I don’t get why so many of my classes are reviewing what I’ve already covered in high school. All my classes at the moment are basically just intro/pre-requisite classes. I really thought I’d be done with calculus and history after high school. It just feels like a waste of my time to have to cover all these things that I’ve already learned before. What can I do, if anything, to enhance my learning experience this semester? Please let me know! 
Sincerely, 
Tired Of Over  Estimating Actual Skills, Yikes
Dear TOO EASY, 
I know it can be annoying to have to review a bunch of material you’ve covered before, especially right after starting college. I mean, in a way, it makes sense why most intro classes are structured like this. They’re just there to give you a refresher and make sure you’re best prepared when you go on and take more advanced courses. Trust me, everyone goes through this, and all I can really say is hang in there for the semester. But also know that learning doesn’t have to stop outside of the classroom. There are so many great resources you can look to to learn more about the topics that fascinate you, including my favorites: podcasts and documentaries. 
I’ve recently been introduced to podcasts, and I honestly think they’re one of the best sources of information. You can listen to them while you’re walking to class or doing chores, and the best part is, lots of them are free to listen to! There are so many podcasts, covering such a wide range of topics, that you’re bound to find one that covers something you’re interested in. If you want to start looking for podcasts to listen to, my suggestion is to simply Google “best podcasts on (insert your topic of interest).” From there, you can start listening to different ones and hopefully find your favorite!
Like listening to podcasts and watching documentaries can also be both fun and educational! There are tons you can find on Youtube, Netflix, and other places online! What’s so great about documentaries are the visual components, which can really provide a fully immersive experience. 
Of course there are other wonderful resources you can look at (let’s not forget classic books - they have an endless supply of knowledge to teach), but podcasts and documentaries are my current go-to resources for information when I feel like I’m not learning what I really want to in the classroom. Seeking out other forms of education is a great way to enhance your learning experience and really open your mind to new ideas and perspectives. This doesn’t just apply to college freshmen, but to anyone who seeks new ways of learning.

The weather is getting colder, but exams are warming up. I wanted to find a place to have a quick meal before sitting down and getting to work, but I also needed to stop by Giant Eagle to get some groceries. While I was walking around looking for somewhere to eat, I found that Té Café was perfect for my circumstances.
The location: Té Café is located midway through Murray Avenue, so depending on which 61 bus you take, it can still be a fair bit of a walk after getting off the bus. Nevertheless, it’s still pretty convenient for Carnegie Mellon students. There are some colorful outdoor benches, but they were mostly empty. However, in warmer weather I could imagine people sitting there, eating food with their friends. 
The food: By far the coolest thing about Té Café was the kind of food it served. It looked like a sit-down café and had the typical coffee, hot chocolate, and La Prima biscuits, but also sushi, bubble tea, and teriyaki rice bowls. It took me by complete surprise when I checked out their menu, and I think makes the place stand out among the other Asian restaurants and small cafes and diners in Squirrel Hill.
I ordered their strawberry bubble tea because I am a girl of habit. Te Café’s bubble tea didn’t stand out to me like other well-known bubble tea places in Pittsburgh, but it definitely was good. I decided not to order one of their teriyaki rice bowls, instead getting their shrimp gyoza dumplings (girl of habit) and their special, a grilled cheese panini. The dumplings were surprisingly savory, and I was even tempted to order a second helping. The panini was also a good sandwich that I hope Te Café keeps on their regular menu; the sesame seeds in the toast of the panini gave it a lot more welcome flavor.
The vibe: Inside there were a few comfy chairs, some small tables, and a large cushion-y bench perfect for sitting down and doing work – which was what most of the customers in Te Café were also doing. They had ordered drinks – whether bubble tea or a large cup of coffee - and were doing homework. As a result, it was pretty quiet, but exactly what I needed. It felt surprisingly serene and welcoming in the chilly summer weather, and I felt like I could just sit in that restaurant for way longer than I ended up doing so.
Lit or nah: So I arrived at Te Café at 11:00 a.m., which is also when the restaurant opened. As more people started to come in and do work, it felt a little bit more lively – but not by much. Despite this, Te Café is still a small treasure amidst all of Pittsburgh’s restaurants, and establishes itself through its interesting mix of Asian and café offerings, with its chill vibes reverberating through every aspect of the restaurant.

This past June, it was announced in a Carnegie Mellon University press release that a fire prevention algorithm developed by Michael Madaio, a Ph.D. student in the Human-Computer Interaction Institute, would be adopted by the City of Pittsburgh. However, the algorithms’ potential did not stop there for city officials. They hoped similar predictive models could be applied to policing.
As for the success of the fire prevention tool alone, optimism for its potential is far from irrational: when the predictive software analyzed 22,000 Pittsburgh properties, it returned 57 properties that were considered high risk. Of those 57 properties, “50 experienced a fire incident of some type within a year of being tagged by the system,” the previously mentioned press release notes.
In a Heinz College Metro21 Smart Cities Institute press release, Madaio spoke of the future of the tool, saying, “the [Pittsburgh] fire department is already using this...we are partnering with fire departments from several other cities, including Dallas, to help them adapt the model to their cities.”
This August, Mayor Bill Peduto said to Pittsburgh’s WTAE Action News, in reaction to this success, “the question was asked of [Carnegie Mellon researchers], what type of technology can be utilized in looking at crime and how can that help us through predictive analytics to identify where the next crime will occur so we can stop to before it happens.” What Peduto referred to is something known as predictive policing, utilizing algorithms to try to prevent crime by knowing what areas to prioritize as a potential threat.
This application of algorithmic policing is often considered controversial due to its potential to reinforce preexisting biases in policing, rather than remove them. Madaio, whose fire prevention tool inspired Mayor Peduto to meet with the Pittsburgh Chief of Police and Carnegie Mellon representatives to discuss implementing such predictive policing measures, disclosed in an interview with The Tartan that he has “serious misgivings about the ethical risks of using predictive policing algorithms.”
Madaio continued, “One major risk is that these algorithms are often trained on biased data from chronically over-policed neighborhoods and populations, and may have an inequitable impact, especially on low-income, minority populations. Given all the research showing the potential for predictive policing to amplify existing inequities, I would be concerned about the City of Pittsburgh adopting predictive policing technologies,” citing a Royal Statistical Society study titled “To Predict and Serve?”
Despite this sentiment from the leading researcher of the fire prevention tool, the City of Pittsburgh and the Metro21 Institute have followed through with their efforts on predictive policing: this January, it was announced in a Carnegie Mellon University press release that “a neural network model [that] predicts locations that will likely have crime flare-ups in the following week” had been “built, rolled out to all Pittsburgh Police, and [was] in its evaluation period using experimental controls.”
Considering the issue of over-reliance on algorithms in public policy, Madaio said that his research team and him spoke with Mayor Peduto during the roll-out of the fire prevention tool to give their insights on the ethics of machine learning and “advocated for conducting transparent audits of the equitable impact of machine learning systems,” as told to The Tartan.
The fire tool itself, which has been made open source and available for both application across the country and for “public transparency and accountability” has already made a significant impact, Madaio describes: “In San Francisco, the local Code for America brigade has adapted our model using their own data, and our team is in discussions with data scientists from several fire departments on how to best adapt the fire risk model for other cities.”
The goal of increased public safety could certainly be achieved with the fire prevention tool, but the public benefits of things like predictive policing are, at least according to many data scientists, machine learning researchers, and Madaio himself, less clear.
In The Tartan’s conversation with Madaio, he concluded that “Ultimately, I would hope the fire risk analytics project would contribute not only to public safety in Pittsburgh, but also to the larger conversation around fairness, accountability, and transparency in machine learning, especially as part of civic life.”
Transparency, accountability, and fairness may be characteristic of Madaio’s open source fire prevention tool, but of the proprietary predictive policing algorithms currently deployed in Pittsburgh, the same cannot be said.

Anthony Foxx, former Secretary of Transportation under President Obama, has joined Carnegie Mellon as the distinguished executive in residence for the 2018-2019 academic year. He will be working on issues that intertwine policy, environment, and engineering. A university press release summarizes: “In his new role, Foxx will...help students understand how to most effectively bring people, policy and technology together to significantly improve the quality of life for citizens living in metropolitan areas.”
The newest Carnegie Mellon distinguished executive in residence indeed has a distinguished resume.
He earned a J.D. from the New York University School of Law in 1996, and worked for several years as a lawyer before starting out in politics serving as a city council member in his hometown of Charlotte, NC. He then was elected as Charlotte’s youngest mayor in 2009 and reelected two years later, the first Democrat to lead the city since 1987. In 2013, President Obama nominated him to be the Secretary of Transportation (a position he held until Obama left office), and he was confirmed in the Senate with a unanimous vote.
Unsurprisingly, given the description of Foxx’s upcoming role in the university press release, most of his political career was spent working on issues relating to metropolitan areas, both short-term and long-term.
As the mayor of Charlotte, he was immediately confronted with a city in the worst recession in over eight decades, hit hard by the 2008 financial crisis. Jobs were bleeding out of the city, which had been America’s second largest financial center; the 25,000 jobs lost represented an existential crisis. Foxx crafted a plan that included balancing the city’s budget, creating a demand-driven workforce development model that is now used nationally, creating incentives friendly to small businesses and entrepreneurs to boost Charlotte’s economy, and leading the city council to passing the largest bond package in Charlotte’s history.
With his plan, he was able to announce that over 4,000 new jobs were created, which was one of the first positive job indicators in 18 months. He transformed Charlotte into a critical energy hub, and lobbied for economic recovery measures from the Obama White House. When Duke Energy opened its new headquarters in Charlotte, President Obama was there to highlight the good news. He also led the completion of several significant transportation infrastructure projects and investments in Charlotte that drew the attention of other city mayors and President Obama.
During his time as Secretary of Transportation, two of the most significant achievements of the Department of Transportation were the Smart City Challenge and passing the Fixing America’s Surface Transportation (FAST) Act. The Smart City Challenge challenged moderately-sized cities to submit plans that laid out the cities of the future—using data, applications, and technology to make transportation of people and goods cheaper and more efficient. 78 cities responded—from Seattle to New Orleans to Boston—and seven finalists were chosen to develop their plans further with support from the Department of Transportation. The FAST Act authorizes $305 billion in funding over four fiscal years to invest in all areas of infrastructure—from highway and vehicle safety to research and statistics programs. Essentially, the Department of Transportation website describes it as a “down-payment” for “building a 21st century transportation system.”
Here at Carnegie Mellon, Foxx will keep contributing his expertise and experience to Carnegie Mellon’s Metro 21: Smart Cities Institute program. He has already taken part in the INTERSECT@CMU Conference, where he was part of a moderated panel called “At the Intersection of Technology and Business: Smart Home, Smart Car, Smart City,” which was hosted by the Tepper School of Business.
University administration members are excited that Foxx is joining. “As a distinguished executive in residence with the Heinz College team, Secretary Foxx will provide real-world applications and strategic counsel on our smart city initiatives,” Ramayya Krishnan, dean of Heinz College, said in the university press release.
James H. Garrett Jr., the dean of the College of Engineering, praised the breadth of Foxx’s experience. “Secretary Foxx’s smart city experience—on both the local and national levels—will provide an invaluable learning opportunity for our students.”
Foxx wants to use this opportunity to share his accumulated experience in the public sector with the next generation and prepare them for the future. “It’s an honor to be joining an institution that is at the forefront of using technology and policy to transform city life,” he said in the press release. “I look forward to sharing my passion with the CMU community and sharing our model for innovative future cities with the world.”

Last week, former U.S. President Barack Obama stepped back into the public eye on a platform conspicuously popular among young people: Snapchat. In his NowThis Politics interview, Obama made his message very clear: “Young people, in particular, need to vote. And they need to vote in midterms.”
These words, coming from the man who made civic engagement cool and gained the preference of young voters by a margin of 4 to 1 in 2008 (according to TIME), are intended to be a call to action for the upcoming midterm elections. The occasion is as clear as the words themselves: if Obama is coming out of hiding to get students to the polls on Nov. 6, something big must be happening. The challenge facing this effort is also clear: the United States Election Bureau found that only 16 percent of young people turned out to vote in the 2014 midterm elections.
In seven weeks, the inhabitants of all 435 seats of the U.S. House of Representatives and 35 seats of the Senate will be decided in voting booths across the country. Governors of 39 states, including Pennsylvania, will be decided. Hundreds of local positions will be decided. The scope of these elections includes college campuses across the country, including Carnegie Mellon.
Students walking through Hunt and Sorrells Libraries last Monday passed by red-clothed tables arranged with voter registration paperwork and frosted “Vote!” cookies as part of Carnegie Mellon Libraries’ Constitution Day celebration. Library workers answered questions and registered first-time voters as well as students in need of absentee ballots. Outside the Cohon Center, student activists do similar work for Next Gen, a nonprofit political action committee funded by billionaire Tom Steyer meant to promote fighting climate change, hollering out to passersby about voter registration and — of course — free pizza.
Francisco Delgado, a recent chemical engineering graduate, is one of the student organizers registering students on campus. “Millennials make up such a large part of the electorate, but many of us don’t vote,” he explained, spitballing a 51 percent voting rate during years with a presidential election for those between the ages of 18 and 35. According to the Center for Information & Research on Civic Learning and Engagement (CIRCLE), his numbers are accurate: just under 50 percent of eligible voters under 25 turned out for the 2016 presidential election, with slightly higher rates (55 percent) in swing states.
Francisco cited apathy as the main culprit for low turnout, though he can empathize with busy students. Having been a student here, he reflected that for much of his undergraduate experience, he was so focused on work that it was hard to pay attention to things going on in the outside world, even voting. Now that he’s outside, he sees an opportunity for other Carnegie Mellon students to form civic habits early: “We get out of here and we hold positions of power, making a lot of money, and we should make efforts for positive change.”
Darya Kharabi, who also works to register student voters at Carnegie Mellon, didn’t wait to get involved. A junior major in Environmental Studies and Art, she began tabling for voter registration during her first semester at Carnegie Mellon, the fall of 2016. Since then, she has worked in a number of social and political activist groups, both on campus and off, but is cautious about the (not so obvious) politics of activism. “I’m not someone who has grown up in Pittsburgh, and I know that in Pittsburgh there’s a lot of emphasis on neighborhoods, and a lot of neighborhood pride,” she said after being asked about off-campus work. “I don’t feel it’s my right to walk into these communities of people whose lives and whose stories I’m not familiar with and say ‘you need to register to vote.’” Her most effective sphere of influence, she saysa, is within the Carnegie Mellon campus, where she tables six hours per week and canvasses on weekends.
In addition to outside organizations, there was a new effort this August to register first-year students during Orientation Week. Hannah Daniel, a sophomore biology major, was inspired when she attended the March For Our Lives last spring, and worked with a collection of students from both the University of Pittsburgh and Carnegie Mellon to define actionable initiatives on each campus.
Over two tabling sessions during Orientation Week, while events like House Wars, Playfair, and Casino Night captured the energy of many first-years, Hannah and her colleagues managed to register about 80 first year students to vote. Though that number is smaller than she would like, she’s not discouraged. “I felt successful because I was coming into this with little experience and resources,” she said, describing the challenging process of starting this program from the ground up. “I hope that this is not just a one-time program,” she concluded, “and that this is a catalyst for further voting initiatives here at CMU.”
The scope of this election spans from Obama’s measured Snapchat interview, to Orientation Week registration, to the tables outside the Cohon Center, to the table in Hunt Library for Constitution Day, all pressing one idea: college students need to vote. Students here have taken matters into their own hands and turned that idea into action, in hopes of raising that 50 percent turnout by Nov. 6.
For more information about campus voting initiatives, make an inquiry at the SLICE office on the first floor of the Cohon Center.

Diversity is an important part of any college campus, which is why it is always part of a conversation as a university grows over the years. “Diversity” can mean many things: it can signify the distribution of the majors that students choose to engage in, or the balance of genders at a school. Diversity today, however, is commonly used to talk about the racial makeup of a college’s student population.
At a school like Carnegie Mellon, where there is a large white and Asian student population (around 30 percent for each), and a substantial international population (around 20 percent), it comes as no surprise that the school’s student body is lacking in black and Hispanic individuals, who make up 4.5 and 8.3 percent, respectively. These small percentages are common across most major private universities.
Carnegie Mellon has made many strides in the past few years to tackle this issue, such as the Center for Student Diversity and Inclusion, which seeks to connect underrepresented and first generation students. But as stated on the university’s page for Diversity and Inclusion, “we can do better.” 
Professor Nico Slate, a Professor of History and the director of Graduate Studies at Carnegie Mellon who has explored in his research civil rights movements in the U.S. and internationally, affirms this and believes that much more can be done to make Carnegie Mellon more diverse and inclusive at all levels “from our undergraduate student body to our graduate students and faculty.”
“I would also stress that our diversity efforts should, in my opinion, have a special focus on underrepresented populations and students from low-income backgrounds or [those] who are the first in their families to attend college,” Slate continued.
While the racial diversity of the student body is important, it is crucial to look at the many educational benefits that can be attained by also having a diverse faculty. According to a 2017 headcount report released by the university, the percentage of  professors who self-identified  as minorities across each college are 2.5 for the Entertainment and Technology Center, 2.69 for the College of Engineering, 5 for the School of Computer Science, 5 for the Tepper School of Business, 6 for the College of Fine Arts, 6.9 for Heinz College, 7 for the Dietrich College of Humanities and Social Sciences, and 7 for the Mellon College of Science. Dietrich and Tepper had the largest percentage of female faculty and staff members, both over 50 percent.
With such a small number of minority professors, it’s no surprise that the visibility of such professors is often easy to miss. Many of us here at The Tartan took a moment to think about our own experiences taking courses with professors who were mainly black or Hispanic. After wracking our brains for over a minute, many of us were only able to identify one experience we had with a professor that is of a racial minority. Some, who have been at this college for over three years, could not identify having interacted with any.
What’s also surprising is the lack of minority professors when looking at specific departments within a college. In particular, the Physics department has zero black professors while the chemistry department has one. Whereas quite a few of us here at The Tartan are in Dietrich College, which does have a handful of minority professors, a common theme we found is that many of their courses were focused on race. While the perspectives of such professors are highly valued on such topics, it does seem that there’s room to expand on the application of the perspectives of these professors.
While increasing the diversity of the student population is, of course, important, there is a lack of representation of the people that students will be interacting with and looking to for guidance as they pursue their chosen fields of study. As generations and generations of students keep transitioning in and out of the school, many of the faces that teach these new young scholars remain constant. Apart from the invaluable knowledge that they impart daily, professors have the responsibility of representing what accomplished individuals look like in various fields, in a sense, being the face of those fields for students. It is clearly problematic when many minority students are scarcely able to see themselves reflected in their teachers. Additionally, professors are often involved in research that Carnegie Mellon puts out. If diverse perspectives are not included in this research, its focuses and conclusions are not accurate representations of the world and therefore may be biased.
Having a more diverse faculty can clearly have a great educational impact, as it can produce more diverse readings, scholarly ideas, and even teaching methods. It can expose students to different cultures, helping them to value differences and connect with more people from different walks of life.
Professor Slate is a strong supporter of the President’s Postdoctoral Fellowship, one program that is attempting to diversify the school’s faculty. According to the program’s website, the program seeks to recruit new faculty to the university by offering the possibility of a postdoctoral position with the prospect of a succeeding faculty position.
Another important program is the 12-person Committee on Faculty Diversity, recently created by President Farnam Jahanian to “gain insight into the challenges and opportunities of diversity on the CMU campus” and to advise President Jahanian on how to recruit a more diverse faculty. Professor Richard Purcell believes that this initiative shows the university’s “commitment to creating a university experience that mirrors the cultural and intellectual diversity of our planet.”
“In the face of efforts by the current [Trump] Presidential administration and other entities to roll back the hard fought victories achieved by people of color, women, and LBGTQ+ folks I hope our university continues its commit to diversity that addresses historic patterns of discrimination in the United States,” states Purcell.
While efforts are beginning to be pursued to address such issues at Carnegie Mellon, no doubt due to feedback from student, faculty, and staff members, it is important that we as a community note the important educational and societal benefits that such a potential commitment on the university’s part can have on the entire population here at Carnegie Mellon. “Our responsibility as students, faculty and staff is to make sure we hold our university accountable to that commitment,” states Purcell.

The calendar says 2018, but it feels like we’re living in George Orwell’s 1984.
If there is one thing President Trump has achieved during his tenure, it’s to normalize lying. It seems that the President feels the need to lie on an hourly basis, whether to slander his rivals and the media, assuage his own ego, or just for the sake of tweeting something.
Being an ordinary liar is bad enough, but the problem becomes exponentially worse when that individual also inhabits the most powerful and prestigious office in the nation, if not the world. As a result, Trump isn’t the only one blasting ludicrous untruths; staunchly conservative news outlets (e.g. Breitbart and Fox) and Congressional Republicans back him at every turn, the latter willing to turn a blind eye if it’ll help them force their agenda through without bipartisan support. Who needs checks and balances anyway, right?
This is tantamount to gaslighting the American people, desensitizing us and whittling away at our common sense with a ceaseless barrage of fabricated statements, gradually convincing us that the administration is doing a great job when in reality, it’s working toward the pro-life and gun-toting country that the NRA and radical conservatives dream about.
President Trump isn’t the first demagogue to ever inhabit the White House: American history is riddled with similar characters like Andrew Jackson and Warren G. Harding, and every president is controversial in some respect. However, Trump stands out in the sense that he lies boldly and frequently to the people, and many of his claims are offensive and inappropriate.
And nothing proves that better than the recent tweet regarding Hurricane Florence.
Crises are generally seen as proving grounds for a president and depending on how well the sitting commander in chief responds, the public may reward their efforts at the polls and ballot boxes; this was evident when George W. Bush’s approval ratings jumped significantly following the terrorist attacks of 9/11.
Hurricanes aren’t comparable to something like the falling of the Twin Towers, but they can still destroy millions of homes and take countless lives, leaving wide swaths of destruction in their wake. In these dark times, Americans look to their leader for comfort and support, relying on them as they face the tremendously difficult task of rebuilding.
As Florence made landfall, battering the coast with its strong winds, torrential rains, and dangerous flooding, Trump not only offered few meaningful words of consolation, but he felt the need (as he often does) to correct a past “mistake” by the fake news media. So, on Sept. 13, Trump took to Twitter and proved that even pathological liars can reach new lows:
“3000 people did not die in the two hurricanes that hit Puerto Rico. When I left the island, AFTER the storm had hit, they had anywhere from 6 to 18 deaths. As time went by it did not go up by much. Then, a long time later, they started to report really large numbers, like 3000…”
Trump then goes on to blame this “incorrect” reporting on the Democrats:
“...This was done by the Democrats in order to make me look as bad as possible when I was successfully raising Billions of Dollars to help rebuild Puerto Rico. If a person died for any reason, like old age, just add them onto the list. Bad politics. I love Puerto Rico!”
So not only did the president actively deny the deaths of 3,000 American citizens following Hurricane Maria, he then had the audacity to blame the “false” number on the Democrats, taking what was a tragic situation and politicizing it to meet his own twisted goals.
Although this outburst sickening, it proves that much like the authoritarian state of Oceania in Orwell’s dystopian world of 1984, Trump will say anything to make himself look better and to preserve his position of authority, even if it means crossing the line. Unsurprisingly, Trump’s tweet drew fire from Democrats and Republicans alike. But underlying the vociferous denunciations was the sad realization that this was the norm and that things are only going to get worse.
The reason this tweet is so concerning is not only because of the insensitive content, but also because it provides more insights into Trump’s ghastly character, painting him as an unstable, impulsive narcissist who makes questionable and outright poor decisions, such as when he seemed incapable of criticizing the Neo-Nazis and white supremacists after the Charlottesville protests, insisting that there were “good people on both sides.”
This is the person in charge of our international relations and trade, domestic policies, and the nuclear launch codes. Frankly, that’s not a little disquieting, especially in the context of the current controversy over Brett Kavanaugh’s Senate confirmation hearings for the Supreme Court and the escalating trade war with China. Trump’s amorality may have served him well in the business world, but running a country and a company are worlds apart.
It’s important to remember that even though things seem bleak, as college students, we don’t always feel the full force of the administration’s capricious policies, the exception being specific policies targeting international students or students without established American citizenship, or policies affecting federal loans and financial aid. For the most part, the consequences of the government’s decisions manifest among the non-matriculating, working and middle-class citizens of America. But just because we are not directly affected doesn’t mean that we’re exempt from action.
We are lucky to be in such an insular atmosphere during a time rife with uncertainty and fear, but it’s equally important to remember that with that privilege comes responsibilities. Historically, colleges have been hotspots of progressive thinking and political activism, and we should do our best to educate ourselves about the State of the Union and the world. To that end, I encourage everyone to read literature from both sides of the political spectrum and to engage in the dying art of civil discourse, reaching across the chasm that our Congressional representatives seem incapable of bridging. Through understanding opposing perspectives, we can better discern fact from fiction and form our own educated judgments and conclusions about the news we encounter every day.
Political activism is the duty of every citizen because a democracy cannot stand on a foundation of ignorance. But activism doesn’t mean that we must have weekly protests over every single controversial issue; just the simple act of staying informed — and voting when elections roll around — is enough. After all, we are the future, and if we do our best to become worldly citizens who stand upon a foundation of truth, then our representatives will reflect our values and restore some much-needed honor and dignity to our politics.
The calendar says 2018. As a nation, let’s start acting like it.The calendar says 2018. As a nation, let’s start acting like it.

It happened when Anita Hill testified in 1991. It happened when Hillary Clinton ran for president. And it will most likely happen again if Christine Blasey Ford testifies before the Senate Judiciary Committee this week. In fact, female Republican senators and politicians have already begun to demolish Christine Blasey Ford’s credibility. Why? Because women are incapable of empathizing with and supporting other women. This very societal problem helps explains why Hillary Clinton did not win and why Kavanaugh will likely be confirmed to the highest court of the land.
When news broke of the sexual assault allegations against Brett Kavanaugh, the news media immediately drew parallels to Clarence Thomas’ Supreme Court confirmation in 1991. Clarence Thomas, then nominee, was accused of sexual harassment in the workplace by Anita Hill. Hill testified before the all-male Senate Judiciary Committee and was gravely discredited.
The question now is whether or not Ford, Kavanaugh’s accuser, will be believed if she testifies this week. Christine Blasey Ford has been forced to negotiate her testimony because she demanded that an FBI investigation take place before she testifies. However, Republicans would never agree to an investigation, as they are trying to ram Kavanaugh’s vote through before the midterm elections. Ford’s demands for an investigation have prompted Republicans to discredit her allegations. It is unfortunate that politicians are unable to realize how hard it is for survivors of sexual assault to testify and tell their stories, especially since we are living in the #MeToo and Time’s Up era.
Female survivors of sexual assault have their stories dismissed before they even have a chance to tell them. When female survivors do have the opportunity to stand against their accuser, the accuser has to confirm that the incident happened for society to fully believe the survivor. This is due to the fact that we live in a patriarchal society that values the voices of men over the truths of women.
Since revealing herself to the public, Ford has faced a number of death threats. It is during times like these that America needs to take a look in the mirror to see the monster it has become. Ford was probably halted from coming forward sooner due to fear and the inevitable fact that women are never listened to when the accuser is a man of power.
Over the past few days, Republicans have once again proven that their agenda is their top priority. Now, they are facing pressure from Trump and Evangelical groups to push the confirmation through the Senate. And women like Kellyanne Conway have demonstrated on national television that they have clearly learned nothing from the Time’s Up or #MeToo movements.
This past year, a lot of progress has been made towards listening to women who are survivors of sexual assault and harassment in the workplace. Many industries have taken action against powerful men who have sexually harassed or assaulted women. Harvey Weinstein, a powerful producer in Hollywood, has been blacklisted from the business. Matt Lauer, who was arguably one of the most famous TV morning hosts, was fired and publicly condemned for his years of sexual harassment in the workplace. The CEO of the CBS Corporation recently stepped down due to allegations that he sexually abused women. Many allegations have come out of the woodwork this year and many have been met with serious consequences, but when are our public officials going to start taking sexual assault allegations seriously?
If Kavanaugh is confirmed to the Supreme Court, not one, but two male judges will have been knowingly accused of sexual assault. This should not just concern women. It should concern all people that care about societal progress and equal rights. If we have two judges on the Supreme Court that have been accused of sexual assault, it will show our country that cruel behavior against women is okay because our politicians approve of it.
Any politician that votes for Kavanaugh should be ashamed of themselves. The female Republican senators need to recognize the ripple effect that this Kavanaugh decision will have on our society and the progress it will erase. This is bigger than politics. This should be bigger than political parties. It should be about listening to a woman who has been violated. It should be about supporting her after she had the courage to stand up for herself.
1991 was 27 years ago, and if Kavanaugh is approved, our politicians will prove that politics and party are more important than social progress and gender equality.

“Sisters and Brothers of America.”
This was how Swami Vivekananda began his address to the World’s Parliament of Religions in Chicago on Sept. 11, 1893. By accepting people of a country different from his as his own, he embodied the very essence of the universalism of humanity, the idea of Vasudaiva Kutumbakam — “The whole world is one Family”.
It is important for us now, 125 years later, to revisit this speech that remains as relevant now as it was then. In a world that actively spreads hatred and intolerance towards fellow human beings, his message holds the potential to unlock a wave of change that can transform the world for the better.
Swami Vivekananda, his mission, and his speech have played a huge role in shaping the way Indian culture, religion, and history are perceived by Indians themselves, as well by people from other countries. Former President Barack Obama, in a speech during his visit to India in 2010, said, “...It’s the richness of faiths celebrated by a visitor to my hometown of Chicago more than a century ago — the renowned Swami Vivekananda. He said that, ‘holiness, purity, and charity are not the exclusive possessions of any church in the world, and that every system has produced men and women of the most exalted character.’”
Standing in the Chicago Art Institute 8,000 miles away from his motherland, Swami Vivekananda called upon the teachings of his Master Shri Ramakrishna Paramahamsa and the wisdom contained in ancient texts like the Vedas, the Upanishads, and the Bhagavad Gita to give one of the greatest speeches ever delivered.
The Swamiji wove a rich tapestry of Indian culture and heritage, speaking about India’s history of giving refugees a home, of tolerance, acceptance, the idea of the oneness of oneself with the world, and of rejecting hatred and fanaticism. He rejected the idea of humans beings as sinners and instead endorsed the purity and immense power of the human soul, that we are the masters of ourselves: “Come up, O Lions, and shake off the delusion that you are sheep; you are souls immortal, spirits free, blest and eternal; ye are not matter, ye are not bodies; matter is your servant, not you the servant of matter” (“Paper on Hinduism.” Chicago Address, Vivekananda Institute of Human Excellence, 2018.)
Though he’d come in as a representative of the Hindu religion, he spoke not just of Hinduism but of the peaceful and harmonious coexistence of all religions, of learning from one another to achieve a higher state of being, saying that “...the Christian is not to become a Hindu or a Buddhist, nor a Hindu or a Buddhist to become a Christian. But each must assimilate the spirit of the others and yet preserve his individuality and grow according to his own law of growth.”
In today’s world, as forces trying to sow unrest spread vitriolic hatred; as fanatics, extremists, and “religious leaders” preach the supposed greatness of their own religions or ideas over others’, and for the destruction of those who do not fit into their narrow worldview; as demagogues and charlatans try to create divisions based on religions, races, creeds, and origins, never had Swami Vivekananda’s rousing call of action been more relevant: “...upon the banner of every religion will soon be written, in spite of resistance: ‘Help and not Fight,’ ‘Assimilation and not Destruction,’ ‘Harmony and Peace and not Dissension.’”

Sept. 15th marked the start of Latin Heritage Month. Latin Heritage is something to be proud of, and to celebrate. Labeling your heritage is an important part of many people’s identities. I am Ecuadorian-American. I am Latina. It seems simple enough, right? For some, however, labeling in the Spanish language has become difficult, particularly when a label for you doesn’t seem to exist.
Today, I want to take a closer look at a certain aspect of the Latin identity that is relevant and necessary for society: gender-neutral terms for those who identify as gender non-binary. For English speakers, non-binary pronouns include “they” and “them;” however, in many Latin countries, the idea of gender-neutral terms has simply never come about. Don’t assume that this ignorance is due to bad intentions — for now, at least, what Anglo-saxon cultures criticize as the “gendered nature” of Spanish is normal for Spanish speakers. But we are reaching a time where the norm isn’t good enough anymore; we need to address the growing population of people who aren’t comfortable identifying as Latino or Latina.
The fight for the gender-neutral term, “Latinx,” to become standard has been a long and turbulent one; historically, it has been tough to find a single unifying term to describe all people from Latin countries such as Cuba, Mexico, and Peru. We are all from different cultures and identities, so combining it into one all-encompassing word is difficult. “Hispanic” alludes to Spanish colonialism, while simply calling Latin Americans “Spanish” is extremely ignorant. However, Latinx has certainly gained steam in the United States, especially in left-wing politics and colleges nationwide. It is easier to say than Latino/a, let alone “Latin@”, and is becoming more and more acceptable. But we have to ask ourselves: is this a good thing?
Besides homophobic complaints about the “horrid” political correctness of the word Latinx, other arguments against it are valid and worth listening to. While Latinx, with the futuristic “x” ending, has a special ring to it, we need to realize that gender neutrality needs to apply to the rest of the gender-natured language (e.g. bello versus bella). How does the “x” fit? How would it sound? Bell-x? It simply does not make sense on a broader scale. I commend the intentions of Latinx — in the end, it is a step forward in the language to be more inclusive. However, the mere fact that Latinx is a word created and spread by Americans almost completely invalidates it. It is modern linguistic imperialism, another failed attempt to unify us under one term in the guise of 21st century “wokeness.”
Fortunately, there is an alternative to the “x” ending. Back in June, a young Argentinian girl went viral after a video of her explaining the importance of gender neutrality to the Spanish speaking LGBTQ+ community was posted on Facebook. What she says is enlightening, and a total game-changer: “There are trans people who identify as women. But there are algunos y alugnas y algunes that don’t identify as either man or woman… Nosotras, nosotros, and nosotres respect how we want to be called. We also need to respect how ellos, ellas, and elles want to be called.”
If we were to apply her “e” ending alternative to Latinx, we’ll get Latine (pronounced LA-TEEN-EH). Is it as trendy-sounding as Latinx? Maybe not. Nonetheless, it’s a step forward in figuring out the confusing intricacies of labels.
It is worth admitting that many, if not all, Spanish-speaking countries in South America are traditional, and have not even taken the strides to incorporate Latinx. So what will make them consider Latine, as well as the “e” ending rule? That is a question I do not have the answer to. The arguments against gender neutrality in the Spanish language are rigid: it infringes on the language, it ignores the differences between American culture and theirs, and it is simply something “no one cares about.”
Perhaps, in the distant future, all Spanish-speaking countries will recognize the importance of gender-neutral terms to those who are non-binary. But for now, we should take a hard look at ourselves in the mirror as Americans, and as citizens of a country growing more diverse and aware of our differences. Is Latinx a good start? Sure. Is it worth making the word nationally standardized? No, at least not in my opinion. It is our responsibility as Americans, in this era of holding ourselves accountable and being aware of cultural differences, to do more than just grab and digest any woke-sounding term that arises — especially when it completely ignores the possibility of expanding gender neutrality past just one word.
