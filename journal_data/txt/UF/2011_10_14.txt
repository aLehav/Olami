more Alexander Cohen, 20, checks his Fa-cebook once or twice a day for about 30 minutes on his computer. He checks it once an hour for about a minute on his phone.  
  But the time he spends on Facebook, 
he said, has no effect on his grades or his studies.
  “I keep it on in the background of my 
computer, and if someone messages me, I answer them,” Cohen said. 
  However, according to a recent study by 
a UF graduate, Cohen is not in the norm. 
  Reynol Junco, 40, who graduated from 
UF in 1994 with a bachelor’s degree in psy-chology, conducted a study that showed the time spent on Facebook was negatively related to overall college GPA. 
  His ﬁ  ndings were recently published 
in a paper called “Too much face and not enough books: The relationship between multiple indices of Facebook use and aca-demic performance.”
  The study gathered ﬁ  ndings from 1,839 
students from one university. Junco would not disclose the speciﬁ  c university for ethi-cal reasons. 
  In a survey, Junco asked students 
about the average amount of time they spent on Facebook and how fre-quently they checked the website.Junco, a professor at Lock Haven Univer-sity in Pennsylvania, also analyzed what Facebook activities students frequented. Students’ grades were accessed through the university registrar, Junco said.  Study shows

  The occupation is starting to move from downtown toward 
campus.
  About 30 people attended Occupy UF’s  informational meet-
ing Thursday on Turlington Plaza.
  The group stands with the Occupy movement across the 
U.S. and on other college campuses.  Occupy UF’s agenda for the meeting focused on three topics: 
education, unions and the environment.
  “Education is under attack,” said Skye Schmelzer, a psychol-
ogy sophomore. “What do we do when education is under at-
tack? Stand up, ﬁ  ght back.”
  Attendees discussed reaching out to the community.  The Students for a Democratic Society and the International 
Socialist Organization voiced their opinions at the meeting.  “The Occupy movement is important to [ISO] because they 
understand and are angry about the greed of corporations and their inﬂ  uence in our politics speciﬁ  cally,” said Erin Cass, a po-litical science and European studies senior.
  After returning in 2008 from two tours in Iraq, Eugene Hat-
ley Jr., an anthropology junior, said, “This is not the 60s … This is about making things better for everybody.”
  He said what happened on Thursday is exactly what needs 
to happen.
  “We are trying to create order and nationalism,” Hatley 
said.  Students hold ﬁ  rst meeting, begin organizing for Occupy UF� THEY NORMALLY SELL OUT THE

  Despite expectations, tickets for the Flor-
ida-Georgia football game did not sell out 
Wednesday evening.
  As of Thursday afternoon, 500 of the 
5,500 student tickets were still available, said Mark Gajda, the assistant athletics di-rector for ticket operations.  “It’s much slower this year,” Gajda said.  Tickets for the Florida-Georgia game, 
considered one of the season’s biggest rival-ries and most popular games, usually sell out on the day they go on sale, Gajda said.
The slower ticket sale may be attributed 
to a sluggish economy and students’ appre-hension to travel because of relatively high gas prices, Gajda said.
  The time, date and location of the game have not changed from last fall. The game will be in Jacksonville on Oct. 29 at 3:30 p.m. and will be broadcast live on CBS. Tickets for students cost $40 and can be bought on-line through gatorzone.com.
  The Gators ticket ofﬁ  ce used Facebook 
and Twitter as part of an aggressive mar-keting campaign to encourage students to attend.  
  Bianca Cassouto, a 19-year-old geogra-
phy  sophomore, expected tickets to sell out fast Wednesday, but she bought her ticket  Florida- Georgia tickets still available

It happens every year.
Herds of bearded punk-rock 
enthusiasts flood the streets, and a cloud of excitement settles over the city for a weekend of music and ca-maraderie known as the Fest. 
As many as 6,000 lovers of 
punk, hardcore and indie music come from as far away as Europe to see their favorite bands and par -
take in 72 hours of unadulterated crusty glory. 
The Fest 10 is scheduled for 
Oct. 28 through 30 at 11 venues in Gainesville. 
Weekend tickets are sold out, 
but a limited number of walk-up tickets will be available on the day of some individual shows. Ticket-ing information is available at thef-estfl.com.
This year marks the 10th an-
niversary of the Fest, which was introduced in 2002 by Tony Wein-bender. 
Weinbender said there was 
no way he could’ve foreseen how much the Fest would grow or that people would still be interested 10 years later.
“I was just trying to get through 
the first one,” he said. 
While in college in Virginia, 
Weinbender put on a music festival called MACRoCk. After he moved to Gainesville in 2000, friends who had been to MACRoCk asked him if he would consider organizing a festival in Florida. 
Weinbender started inviting 
bands from all over, and the first Fest kicked off in October 2002. Six-ty bands played during two days at five venues, he said. There were 500 attendees, including the bands.
This year, Weinbender antici-
pates 6,000 attendees. The set list sports more than 250 bands, includ-ing groups from Japan, Slovenia, Austria and the United Kingdom. 
The economic impact on 
Gainesville is huge, he said. 
The Fest always happens over 
the Florida-Georgia football game weekend, when the exodus of col-lege students makes Gainesville a ghost town. 
Bringing in 6,000 Fest-goers, 70 
percent of whom Weinbender said come from outside of Florida, is something local businesses appre-ciate.
But the cultural impact of the Fest is probably even greater than the economic impact. Although its fame is more underground, “Within the punk rock community … Gainesville has been acknowl-edged and respected for a really long time,” Weinbender said. 
He said he doesn’t have a long-
term goal for the Fest; it happens year-to-year. But, he said, as long as he’s able to keep putting it on and it’s a good thing, he will. 
The Fest’s past has occasionally 
been marred by negative episodes, such as an incident during Fest 8 in which four people were arrested for allegedly assaulting a police of-ficer at an after-party. 
Weinbender said Fest organiz-
ers had nothing to do with the par -
ty, and none of the arrested people were even attendees of the event. 
Gainesville Police Sgt. Tscharna 
Senn said crimes at the Fest are usually committed by people who come from out of town looking for a place to stay. She said GPD in no way wishes to deny Fest-goers their rights of assembly, but if they break the law, they will be dealt with accordingly.
“We just hope that people act 
like adults and that they don’t vio-late the law,” she said. 
Every year, in preparation for the Fest, GPD officers talk to venue owners and attend meetings with organizers to get an idea of how many people will be in Gainesville during the weekend.
Based on those expectations, 
GPD makes a forecast about how many officers will need to be on hand.
Senn said officers will not be 
posted at every venue, but if there is a traffic issue or an altercation at any venue, GPD will send officers out to it. 
There were no significant inci-
dents at last year’s Fest, and Senn said she doesn’t anticipate sending extra officers to venues this year.
“We always go into it hoping 
that it’s going to be both productive for [organizers and venue owners] and a non-issue for us,” she said. 
Jen Vito has owned 1982 bar, 
one of 11 venues participating in Fest 10, for “a few years.”  
She said the Fest has used 1982 
as a venue almost every year the event has been around. It’s one of the only all-ages venues at the Fest.
Vito said 1982 always hosts a 
pre-Fest show on the Thursday be-fore the event, featuring some local bands and some from overseas.
Since 1982’s first Fest, she 
guessed the bar has hosted hun-dreds of bands. 
Because there usually aren’t too 
many bands with female members playing the Fest, she said, she al-ways asks to get some radical fe-male bands at the bar. 
“We try to bring a little more 
equality to our version of the Fest because that’s what our venue is about year round.” 
Vito said the best part of Fest 
weekend is meeting the people who come from Europe to see the shows. But, she added, “I’d be ex-cited about any [band] that has 
radical politics.”

The Alachua Coun-

new adoption facility is open for business, and the animals are ready to greet you at the door.
The humane soci-
ety is holding an open house to celebrate its new building, which is 30,000 square feet, sits on four acres of land and cost $2.1 million, including renovation expenses.
The open house is 
Saturday from 10 a.m. to 2 p.m. It will fea-ture KTK 98.5’s Storm Roberts, the Alachua County Sheriff Of-fice’s Canine Unit and behind-the-scene tours of the facility.
The humane society 
has already seen an in-crease in adoptions in the few months it has been in the new build-ing. Eric Van Ness, the 
executive director of the humane society, said the new prop-erty will help facilitate adoptions countywide.
“What we’re trying 
to do right now is end euthanization in Ala-chua County. It’s really been our focus for the last 10 years or so,” he said. “The adoption rate is definitely going to go up. Our limit-ing factor right now is funding. We’re getting to the point where we need more funding to do more adoptions.”

ty Humane Society is located at 4205 NW Sixth St. For more in-formation, visit alach-uahumane.org.  FRIDAY, OCTOBER 14, 2011 § ALLIGATOR, 5

Jeffrey Kaplan, 25, UF Hillel’s program director, helps to construct 
one of Florida’s largest sukkahs.

JULIA GLUM
Alligator Contributing Writer
While many UF students were road-trip-
ping back from Baton Rouge, La., on Sunday, 
Alpha Epsilon Pi fraternity brothers and UF Hillel members were building a large suk-kah.
A sukkah is a temporary hut built for Suk-
kot, the Jewish holiday for the harvest festi-val, said Jeffrey Kaplan, UF Hillel program director. 
It took Kaplan, 25, and about 20 AEPi 
brothers 30 hours over three days to build the sukkah. Its 2,273-square-foot structure is made from all-natural materials, includ-ing 24 plywood boards and two tons of palm fronds.
The Hillel’s sukkah is is one of the largest 
sukkahs in Florida, Kaplan said. 
Executive director Keith Dvorchik chal-
lenged him to surpass 1,800 square feet.
Computer engineering sophomore Greg 
Valle, 19, designed the plans for the sukkah.
A Jewish commandment says people 
should dwell in their sukkah as they would their house, Kaplan said.
To support this idea, UF Hillel will host a 
week of events inside its sukkah. 
UF Hillel hosted a sleepover in the sukkah 
Thursday night. Tonight, guests can eat Shab-bat dinner there following services. 
For information about other events, visit 
ufhillel.org.
Kaplan estimates that about 600 to 800 non-
unique visitors will see the sukkah before he takes it down Oct. 24.
“All I can think that is if the Tyrannosau-
rus rex was a Jew, this is the kind of sukkah he would hang out in,” Kaplan said. Students build one of state’s largest sukkahs Humane Society to

OPINIONS EDITORToday’s question: Do you want tickets for the Florida-
Georgia game?
Thursday’s question: Due to a technical error, the poll 
results are unavailable.Steve Jobs embraced life’s hardships
Recently, the world mourned the loss of a revolution-ary figure: Steve Jobs. Jobs reconciled philosophy, courage and technology to significantly alter the 
way that we look at the world. 
Jobs’ success goes beyond Apple. He defined this era of 
technology with a passionate drive to simply live the life that he loved. His heartbreaking death reminds us to keep alive the boldness and fearlessness of his personality.
Once a student like many of us, Jobs sought a sense of 
identity during the beginning stages of his college career. However, instead of conforming to the norms of the aca-demic culture of his time, Jobs went his own way. 
Many of us who must deal with financial or social hard-
ships or a lost sense of self often believe that there is no alternative. Instead of finding another way, we continue on the conventional path of life so as not to risk uncertainty. Somehow we’ve equated convenient settlement to happi-ness.
I hope that Jobs’ life journey can teach us that there is 
always another way to succeed and be happy — and this way is not always through complete normalcy. 
As a nonconformist by nature, Jobs dropped out of col-
lege simply because he knew that spending his parent’s well-earned money on tuition was not beneficial anymore. After attending only six months of college, Jobs found him-self in dangerous territory; with no money and no degree, he had no idea where he was going with his life. Despite his confusion and frustration, Jobs vehemently relied on one virtue to get him through this precarious time in his life: trust. 
Fiercely independent of the watchful eyes of a judgmen-
tal society and the daunting voices of enemies, Jobs stayed true to himself and never doubted his decision to take his own path in life. In fact, looking back at his failures, Jobs noted that such hardships directly led to his success at Ap-ple, Inc. 
Jobs also possessed another salient quality: the ability to value even the most unusual of circumstances. It takes a very daring and confident person to appreciate adverse situations that seem to have no short-term benefit. Instead of condemning the moments in his life where he suffered so greatly from lack of financial resources or emotional support, Jobs was always able to 
“connect the dots” in the future, as he mentions in his com-mencement speech at Stanford University in 2005. 
From contracting an illness during a spiritual journey in 
India to getting fired from his own company in 1985, Jobs rarely lived a life of pure certitude. However, despite the turbulence that he experienced, Jobs never lost sight of his prevailing emotions. Jobs’ unconventional path allowed him to develop unique and progressive beliefs and turn them into innovative ideas — the same ideas that were eventually implemented in his multibillion-dollar industry. Jobs is perhaps the greatest innovator of our time precisely because he relished hardship. He took risks and persevered. Most importantly, he took the path less traveled. 
Jobs began a project in his garage and turned it into an 
empire. Through determination and a vigorous drive to ex-cel with minimal resources, Jobs certainly put a “dent in the universe.”  We too should learn from the power of his fervent and unrelenting willpower that shined in the face of adversity. 
Jobs returned to Apple just as the company was going 
bankrupt. He fused life into the failing company with the introduction of the iMac and more. Alas, if there were only a way that we could have come to his rescue during his last moments. 
Rest in peace, Steve Jobs. Akansha Mishra is a pre-law junior at UF. Her column ap-
pears on Fridays.For this installment of the Alligator’s weekly tradition, 
we’re turning over a new leaf.
We are not going to make fun of anyone or anything. 
We’re just going to talk about good things that people 
have done this week. 
We’re going to point out all those out there who are try-
ing to make a difference in the world.
That’s why we’re proud to present this week’s who-are-
we-kidding edition of... 
Darts & Laurels
First, we throw a math-and-science-and-math-and-sci-
ence-and-math-and-science DART to Gov. Rick Scott for 
his plan to reduce the state’s emphasis on liberal arts pro-grams. 
Where in the hell are these politicians getting the idea 
that math and science are the key to prosperity? Even in the world of empty talking points, this kind of babble is too much.
Steve Jobs didn’t even need college to make technologi-
cal innovations. 
Next, we give a keepin’-it-calm-and-peaceful LAUREL  
to Occupy Gainesville. 
We appreciate your peaceful enthusiasm and hope that 
your protests occur without any problems. 
We will also be throwing a sometimes-change-is-not-a-
good-thing DART to Newberry for trying to steal the fair -
grounds from Gainesville. 
Why waste the money for a change that nobody seems 
to want?  
Although we must place some blame on our next award 
winner for allowing these monstrosities campus, we decid-ed that, overall, UF deserved a now-we-can-all-go-around-
campus-without-wondering-whether-someone-is-a-damn-statue LAUREL for removing the random statues from 
campus this week. 
Now people can have fun imitating the statues and freak-
ing out those who didn’t know they were removed. 
And, of course, we cannot end this week without throw-
ing a we-hope-this-doesn’t-happen-again DART to UF Stu-
dent Government for blowing this entire election process. We hope that students remember all that has happened next semester. 
And to our readers who seem to think that we are simul-
taneously pro-Unite and pro-Students Party: We have not endorsed a single candidate or party this year. 
We have been highly critical of this entire situation and

Cassouto, who attended the game 
last year, plans to drive with four 
friends to Jacksonville on that Satur -
day and return Sunday.
“Everyone was doubting the 
Gators, and winning in overtime was one of the most exciting moments I’ve ever been through,” Cassouto said. “I hope the game will be a lot of fun.”
Lyndsay Wolfe, a 20-year-old zo-
ology sophomore from Jacksonville, was afraid tickets would sell out.  
“It’s the biggest tailgate party of the year,” she said.
Wolfe, who has attended the 
game before, said it’s one of her fa-vorite days of the year.
“If you’re a Gator, and you 
haven’t gone, you’re missing out,” Wolfe said. 
Students can purchase tickets un-
til Friday, and if any tickets are left by 5 p.m., the ticket office will close the sale and regroup to figure out the best way to sell any remaining tick-ets.
Students who have purchased 
tickets for the game will be able to pick up their tickets during the week of Oct. 29. Further details will be emailed to students after the ticket sale ends.Students can 
pick up their tickets from Oct. 25 to 27CLARE LENNON

Anthony Reynolds and Juan 
Rodriguez make eye contact, 
ask about someone’s day and give handshakes and hugs.
They’ve both expressed 
how much they love interact-ing with other UF students. Reynolds plans to start hang-ing out on Turlington Plaza, just to talk with students.
That’s why Reynolds ran for 
Student Government vice pres-ident in spring 2011: to interact with and represent students. 
With the recent resignation 
of former President Ben Mey-ers, Reynolds has taken over the president’s office. 
He said he feels the presi-
dent traditionally works more with the UF administration than with the students, which is why Reynolds plans to go out of his way to talk to his constituents directly.
Rodriguez now represents 
the students as the SG vice president. Rodriguez previ-ously served in the Student Senate, where he was a mem-ber of the Budget Committee and advocated co-sponsoring events and increasing funding for Multicultural & Diversity Affairs.
Rodriguez is a former presi-
dent of the Hispanic Student Association, and he still gives advice to the current president, 19-year-old family, youth and community sciences junior Stephanie Salazar.
“He is one of the most de-pendable people I’ve ever met,” Salazar said. “And not just dependable, but I can call him at any time for profes-sional or personal reasons, and he’ll be there.”
Meyers said he’s excited 
to see what the pair will ac-complish, especially his good friend Reynolds. 
Meyers stepped down last 
week due to personal reasons.
“One of the things that com-
forted me was that Anthony was going to take over,” Mey-ers said.
Reynolds said he actually 
was focused on a different or -
ganization when he started out as a Gator. 
He was active in the Asian 
American Student Union right away, and he eventually decid-ed to get involved on campus on a schoolwide level.
Reynolds worked his way 
from a Unite Party volunteer to party president, and he served in multiple SG cabinets. 
He was a director of Stu-
dents Taking Action Against Racism and chaired the cam-pus division cabinet, which al-lowed him to work with then-Vice President Marcus Dixon.
Reynolds was the first 
AASU member to be Student Body vice president, and now he is the first to be president.
AASU president Michael 
Satyapor befriended Reynolds during their sophomore year in AASU. 
The pair also worked to-
gether on the cabinet, and even though they’re both busy, Sa-tyapor said they make time to talk or hang out weekly.
Satyapor said Reynolds is 
“always the same person,” no matter the situation.
Reynolds and Rodriguez are the first racial minority president-vice president team at UF.
“It’s a historic moment for 
The Gator Nation,” Reynolds said.8, ALLIGATOR §  FRIDAY, OCTOBER 14, 2011

� THEY CALLED FOR A RAISE FOR 
THE IMMOKALEE FARM WORKERS.
MINA RADMAN
Alligator Writer
Nine protesters traveled to Ocala early 
Thursday morning at the grand opening of 
a Publix supermarket to rally against wag-es they say are unfair for farm workers. 
The protesters, members of the 
Gainesville Interfaith Alliance for Immi-grant Justice, attended the 7 a.m. ribbon-cutting ceremony and 8 a.m. grand open-ing of the Publix at 3305 SE Maricamp Road. 
They left Gainesville at 5:30 a.m. and 
stayed in Ocala until 8:30 a.m. 
They were protesting against the refus-
al of Publix officials to pay an increase for Florida tomatoes.
Representatives of the Immokalee farm 
workers, who harvest the tomatoes, have been negotiating with various corpora-tions to raise the price of tomatoes by a penny per pound, said Kimberly Hunter, a co-founder of the Gainesville Interface Al-liance for Immigrant Justice.Publix has refused to pay the extra pen-
ny, Hunter said.
She said the slight increase would 
greatly improve the quality of life for the 
workers, who are currently paid 50 cents 
for a 32-pound bucket of tomatoes.
If Publix agreed to the increase, the 
workers’ wages would increase for the first time since the 1980s, rising to 82 cents per bucket.  
Hundreds of local residents came out 
for the store’s grand opening.
The residents were surprised to see pro-
testers and even more surprised to learn about the grocery chain’s refusal to pay the extra penny, Hunter said.
“A lot of them had no idea what was 
going on,” Hunter said. “They were sur -
prised that Publix has refused for almost three years to sign something that less pro-gressive organizations have signed years ago.” Group protests workers’ wages at Ocala Publix opening
STUDENT GOVERMENT
Reynolds assumes role of Student Body President
How time is spent on the site determines its impact on grades
Junco also looked at different Facebook 
activities and found some had a positive re-
lationship with grades, such as sharing links and checking friends’ profiles.
But posting status updates had a negative 
correlation. 
Using Facebook for socializing is nega-
tively related to GPA, while using Facebook for collecting and sharing information is pos-itively related, Junco said.
Sociology sophomore Elesa Paschke, 19, checks her Facebook every hour for a minute or less. She checks for notifications and posts links on people’s walls but rarely updates her status or goes through friends’ statuses. 
“I think Facebook has benefited me be-
cause I learn about things I wouldn’t normal-ly search for,” Paschke said. 
The study did not find a strong link be-
tween the time spent studying and the time spent on Facebook. 
“Facebook does not prevent me from 
studying,” said accounting senior Austin LeFevre, 21. LeFevre goes on Facebook to post links, check friends’ activities and talk to friends about three times a day for two minutes to 20 minutes. 
Although the study may have been statis-
tically significant, the real-world impact was minimal, Junco said. For example, the aver -
age time a student spent on Facebook was 106 minutes. Every 93 minutes above that time, that student’s GPA would decrease .12 points, which is not a big relationship, Junco said.
There have been three other published 
studies of Facebook use and academic per -formance, but this one is the first to use a large sample, include better estimates of time spent on Facebook, connect the survey data to actual grades and use high school GPA as a control, Junco said.
One of the previous published 
studies found no relationship be-tween Facebook use and grades.  
Junco said he thought he would have similar findings. However, he did not.
“It is not whether or not students use Fa-
cebook, but how they use it, that is impor -
tant,” Junco said.

working for gaming websites for years. Laster helped start XBLAFans.com, a site focusing on Xbox Live Arcade games.

He once had a dream. Today , he 
stands 30-feet-tall, peering over the 
hurdles he tried to overcome before he died 43 years ago. 
In elementary school, Martin Lu-
ther King Jr. is usually the first per -
son introduced during lessons on the civil rights movement.
“He was a preacher, supported 
nonviolence and was a peaceful man,” said biology freshman Mar -
gaux McIntyre, 19. “He was a big part of American history.”
On Aug. 22, King’s memorial on 
the National Mall in Washington, D.C., officially opened to the pub-lic. 
President Barack Obama, as well 
as members of the King family and civil rights leaders, will gather Sun-day morning in the nation’s capital to dedicate the memorial.
The memorial originally was to 
be dedicated on Aug. 28, the anni-versary of King’s “I Have a Dream” speech. Hurricane Irene postponed the event.King’s statue is situated on a 
four-acre plot between the Jefferson 
Memorial and 
the Lincoln Me-morial. 
The Na-
tional Capital Planning Com-mission and the U.S. Com-mission of Fine Arts approved 
the site location in December 1999.  
Some people are dissatisfied with the message inscribed on King’s statue.
Just days after the opening of 
the memorial, poet Maya Angelou spoke with CNN’s T.J. Holmes, ex-pressing her disapproval of the 1963 quote inscribed on the statue, which reads: “I was a drum major for jus-tice, peace and righteousness.”
“Each word he spoke was cho-
sen carefully , and you can hear that he was very careful in the words he used to express his thoughts,” An-gelou told Holmes. “In this case of the statement on the sculpture, as it stands now, that’s not an apt report-age of what Rev . King said.”   
Despite Angelou’s misgivings, 
about 50,000 people are expected to attend this weekend’s dedication, according to dedicatethedream.org. 
Sharon Austin, director of the UF 
African American Studies Program, said she is happy King’s memorial will be added to the historic sites in Washington, D.C.
“It’s a good thing to see a promi-
nent African-American listed as someone who has the same type of respect as Abraham Lincoln,” Aus-tin said.

As a law student, John Laster is a 
novice. 
But as a businessman in the online 
gaming community , he’s a pro. 
Laster, a first-year law student at UF, 
has added bucks to his bank account 
and years to his business experience by working with gaming websites since he was in high school. 
He previously worked for The-
GameReviews.com, first writing re-views and later being paid to manage the website while he was studying economics at the University of Central Florida. His responsibilities included managing a budget of up to $5,000, al-though its size diminished over time as the economy and advertising revenue dipped. 
That’s when he and Ben Fisher, who 
originally owned TheGameReviews.com, decided to start a new website. This one focused on a niche market, as opposed to trying to cover gaming in general. 
“If we try to do every single thing, we 
won’t do anything well,” Laster said. 
Laster and Fisher started XBLAFans.
com about two years ago, providing game reviews and other news about Xbox Live Arcade games. These games are less popular than 
big-name titles like Halo and Modern Warfare, which gave XBLAFans the op-portunity to make a name for itself by including content on a subject that isn’t as well-covered by other gaming sites, Laster said. 
Microsoft releases these download-
able games on the Xbox Live Market-place, accessible on Xbox 360 consoles, although they started as features for the first Xbox system.  
“We weren’t really expecting to 
make money right away ,” he said. “But we were hoping to grow it.”
The website is still in its early years, 
gathering fans and regular visitors. 
“We’ve been really embracing social 
media,” he said.
XBLAFans.com often gives away 
free copies of arcade games using Twit-ter. Its account, @XBLAFans, has 3,337 followers. 
Andrew Crews, 29, community 
manager for the website, said he enjoys working with Laster. 
“He doesn’t run a tight, strict ship. He lets you be an individual,” Crews said. “He puts you in a position to be successful.”
When he needed a break from work-
ing on the website so he could move from Pittsburgh to Seattle to take a job at Microsoft, Laster didn’t mind.  
Crews’ work with XBLAFans even 
helped him land the job, he said. The site has a working relationship with Mi-crosoft because of its coverage of Xbox arcade games. 
Laster is proud of how well XBLA-
Fans is growing, although he has had to reduce his daily role in the com-pany due to his law school workload.  He isn’t allowed to work more than 10 hours a week as a first-year law student, so he is focused more on big-picture projects and handles communications with companies like Microsoft while delegating much of the work to other employees. 
He has wanted to go to law school 
since he was in high school and hopes to later work with video-game companies in a legal capacity. 
His online experience in the gam-
ing community has helped him make contacts with industry professionals in the field, which may be helpful in his career. 
“There isn’t anyone else who’s doing 
what we’re doing right now,” he said.

� UF TRYING TO AVOID THIRD 
STRAIGHT LOSS IN OCTOBER. 
TOM GREEN
Alligator Staff Writer
Florida has been here before.
The opponent was different, so was the 
venue. The makeup of Florida’s team was, too. 
But the stakes will be the same when Flori-
da (4-2, 2-2 Southeastern Conference) hits the road to take on No. 24 Auburn (4-2, 2-1 SEC) on Saturday at 7 p.m. Just like last year, the Gators will be trying to avoid a three-game October slide.
“Being an older guy, I’ve been through this 
before — last year’s team,” junior defensive tackle Omar Hunter said. “The thing is, with this team, we’ve got a lot of young guys.”
That youth and inexperience — the Gators 
have just 11 seniors on scholarship — has been a factor in Florida’s freefall the last two weeks against No. 1 LSU and No. 2 Alabama, when the Gators mustered just 21 combined points and their defense faltered.
A lack of consistent leaders is a byprod-
uct of a team light on seniors, particularly the last couple of weeks. That is something the Gators will need if they hope to avoid a third

Florida will need improvement on a young defense to avoid a three-game losing streak 
and a repeat of a disappointing 2010 season that finished with an 8-5 record. We here at the alligatorSports 
Brand Picks Column appre-ciate fine art. 
Elitists place sportswriters at the 
bottom of the creative totem pole, but trust us: We’re cultured. Nobody enjoys the spots and squiggles of ab-stract paintings, the soundtracks and subtitles of foreign films, the beeps and boops of jazz music more than us.
And we can spot a phony from a 
mile away. That’s why we are glad to see the end of “Crossing Paths” — or, as it is better known in the artistic community, “That super sucky pro-gram for which UF paid like $40,000 to put creepy statues everywhere.” 
Good riddance, scary window 
washer outside Einstein Bros. Bagels. 
At its heart, football is an inspir-
ing work of art; it’s why we became sportswriters in the first place. Run-ning backs in motion conjure the grace of the ballet. Pissed-off coaches deliver monologues ripped from the pages of Shakespeare. Quarterbacks and receivers display a spiritual con-nection akin to that of the flute and the piccolo.
Football players will surely lift 
our hearts this weekend with elegant play, but one game in particular has stirred debate between two of the sport’s snobbiest consumers. We let them present their cases.
Texas A&M (-9) will put on a five-
star show because…
The Aggies are minimalist artists. 
A&M won’t be fancy Saturday be-cause it doesn’t need to be. There is nothing more embarrassing than per-formers who try too hard anyway.
Expect the Aggies to run on first 
down, run on second down and run more on third down — if A&M ever has to face such a challenge. Baylor is in over its head, especially against a proficient running attack.
The Bears have the fourth-worst 
rush defense in the Big 12, and the Aggies have a pair of stout backs in senior Cyrus Gray and junior                      Picks

eND OF gRegULATION
The schedule says Florida’s season is 
half over, but in many ways it feels like it’s just starting. 
What have we really learned through six 
games? 
The Gators, on talent alone, were defini-
tively better than FAU, UAB, Kentucky and Tennessee. And, by the same token, they were unquestionably worse than Alabama and LSU. 
But what does that really mean? If you said they ranked anywhere from 
third to eighth in the Southeastern Confer -
ence, or anywhere from 15th to 50th nation-ally, I couldn’t really argue with you. 
Every year, fans are told to discount dom-
inant wins against the lesser opponents that open the schedule, but this year it’s im-portant to do the op-posite, too. 
The same way 
Florida doesn’t learn a ton from wins against Kentucky and Tennessee (once 
Justin Hunter got hurt, anyway), LSU and ‘Bama did not learn much from dominating UF. 
This weekend is when the real answers 
start. 
Florida finally gets to face an average op-
ponent. Not a dominating juggernaut sure to flatten the Gators, and not a puny push-over — just an average opponent. Auburn is ranked No. 24 in the nation, right about where the over/under would be set for Flor -
ida’s 2011 finish. 
Both teams enter under similar circum-
stances. Each is coming off a blowout loss, and each has questions at quarterback. 
Auburn is the control in the experiment 
that is Florida’s season. 
That’s why sophomore center Jonotthan 
Harrison called this game a defining mo-ment. So did sophomore guard Kyle Koeh-ne. 
“This is a huge week,” Koehne said. “We 
really have to come together as a team. De-fense and offense have to play together as Finally time to find out who the Gators are

See gReg, PA ge 20Christine Michael. Also, quarterback Ryan Tannehill can 
tuck it and run here and there if he feels like it.
But don’t expect that too much; the Aggies are accom-
plished and confident. Their art is clean, simple yet effec-tive.
— TYLER JETT
Baylor (+9) will leave A&M dreaming because…Robert Griffin III is Salvador Dalí reincarnated as a Heis-
man candidate. Unlike the pedestrian “art” of the Aggies, Griffin III and Baylor lead an eccentric and grandiose per -
formance every time they take the field. 
Like Dalí, RG3 sees things differently. Soft zone, all-out 
blitz, he doesn’t care. He creates what he wants on the field, painting a scene unlike any before him. On the strength of his arm and improvisational ability, Baylor is fourth in the nation in scoring at 47.6 per game. 
While the Aggies lead the conference in rushing defense, 
they’re last against the pass — where Griffin will torch them in the second half, just as Oklahoma State and Arkansas did in come-from-behind wins. 
Like the creature in the center of Dalí’s “The Persistence of 
Memory,” A&M will fade away after yet another collapse.

Now, on to the picks! Sitting atop the standings with a 29-18 record is alligator -
Sports assistant editor Matt “I just spilled my soul” Watts, who upchucked a mysterious black liquid after a hazy Fri-day night in New Orleans. To create the devil’s cocktail, Matt mixed three ingredients: Marlboros, hand grenades and hate — lots and lots of hate.Following closely in a logjam at 27-20 is alligatorSports 
staff writer Tyler “What am I supposed to do in this place?” Jett, whose staunch membership of Team Sober had him looking quite out of place on Bourbon Street. We couldn’t tell who didn’t belong more, Jett or the evangelical preach-ers.
Tied for second is FightinGators.com’s Cody “I can’t 
get enough Timmy” Jones, who is pinning the hopes of his fantasy team on one certain ex-Gator-turned-NFL-icon quarterback. The addition of Tebow now gives Team Jones (real creative, Cody) four mediocre signal-callers to go with “scrappy” guys like Eric Decker and Jackie Battle. How is your team 4-1?
Still climbing the standings and now tied for second is 
the Associated Press’ Mark “Real athletes wear leotards and codpieces” Long, who wouldn’t shut up about his love for Cirque du Soleil this week. Translation: Can you please put on tighter pants, Chris Rainey?
In fifth at 26-21 is InsidetheGators.com’s Kyle “Do I really 
have to?” Maistri, who would rather spend his days “liking” Zeitgeist posts on Facebook than doing the job for which he earns a paycheck. Sorry, Kyle, but you’re expected to make the grueling trek to Jacksonville for the Florida-Georgia game. 
Next up at 25-22 is alligatorSports staff writer Greg “Let’s 
remove the human element from fun” Luca, whose love of statistics led to the creation of an Excel spreadsheet outlin-ing his “Madden NFL ‘12” performances. Greg can tell you the average number of touchdowns scored, turnovers com-mitted and time spoken about said topic before the opposite sex walks away.
In next-to-last place at 24-23 is the Florida Times-Union’s 
Mike “Are you dropping SBDs now?” DiRocco, who was yet another person to feel the wrath of a certain writer’s tribula-tions (no trials, just tribulations) on Bourbon Street. Just be-cause your best friend wasn’t on the trip doesn’t mean you were going to spend a whole game in the press box without some invasion of your nostrils’ personal space. Sorry, Mike.
In dead-ass last place with a piss-poor record of 23-24 
is alligatorSports editor Tom “Because my insider sources said so” Green, who was taken aback when Jacoby Brissett started against LSU after his high school coach told Green otherwise. Don’t be too upset, Tom, Jack Daniels gave you something for free: a lesson.18, ALLIGATOR §  FRIDAY, OCTOBER 14, 2011

  “When you say ‘youth,’ you prob-
ably don’t have a bunch of older 
guys,” coach Will Muschamp said. “So who are your leaders? Who are your guys that are going to step up and take it by the horns and push for-ward?”
  Hunter said plenty of younger 
guys, including the sophomore trio of defensive end Sharrif Floyd, de-fensive tackle Dominique Easley and Buck linebacker Ronald Powell, have stepped into those leadership roles. 
  But Florida will need more than 
just leadership from those three. 
  It will need production, too, if it 
hopes to stop the conference’s No. 3 rushing offense, which is led by run-ning back Michael Dyer’s 113.2 yards per game.
  Against both Alabama and LSU, 
Florida’s defense failed to make tackles at the point of contact. That proved costly, as the Gators allowed 464 yards and seven touchdowns on the ground.
  The UF rush defense, which was 
among the best in the nation to open the season, was challenged and failed to answer the call.
  “When your opportunity comes, 
you just have to embrace it and make the play,” Hunter said. 
“Sometimes you don’t get those 
opportunities. But when it comes, your number’s called, you got to make the play.”
  Florida was unable to do that the 
last two weeks.
  Defensive coordinator Dan Quinn 
said Florida missed 12 tackles against LSU, while Muschamp said some players decided to do things their own way rather than how the coaches wanted them done.
  But Florida’s inexperienced team 
will have to grow up fast, and correct those errors in Jordan-Hare Stadium to stop Dyer, who has amassed 679 yards and eight rushing touchdowns, and defending national champion Auburn.
  “You’ve got to grow up, and every 
day you’ve got to take on that respon-sibility and treat every day the same,” Hunter said. 
“You can’t have one off day, and 
then another good day, and then an off day. You’ve got to be consistent with it.”

  Florida freshman forward Annie Speese (center) has grown in her ﬁ  rst season in 
Gainesville by improving her passing and play off the ball.   JOSH JURNOVOY
 Alligator Writer
 Annie Speese has been ter-
rorizing opposing defenses ev-
ery time she touches the ball.
  However, an improvement 
of her skills without the ball is what has led to her recent suc-cess.
  As No. 11 Florida (12-3, 
5-1 Southeastern Conference) continues the remainder of its SEC schedule tonight against Ole Miss (5-8-1, 1-5 SEC) in Ox-ford, Miss., Speese will look to extend the torrid scoring pace she has been on the last month, scoring seven goals and four as-sists in nine games.
  Before that streak, Speese, a 
freshman forward, had just one assist and no goals through the Gators’ ﬁ  rst six games.
  She broke through with 
three assists in UF’s 5-0 win against Florida Gulf Coast on Sept. 11, and she followed that performance by scoring both goals in a 2-0 win against Mis-souri.
  Since then, Speese has notched a two-goal game against Kentucky with two more goals and an assist against Alabama last Sunday.
  She said her increased pro-
ductivity has not been due to technical improvements, but rather learning to become a bet-ter player off the ball in a system predicated on quick passing.
  “We say receive-pass-offer,” 
Speese said. “So if we are try-ing to move the ball around as quickly as we can, we have to always be looking to get open for each other and have other options.”
  She said that her ability to 
play off the ball has helped sup-port teammates when they are making runs and has put her in a better position to score. Also, she has become an improved passer because she can see the ﬁ  eld more clearly.  Florida coach Becky Bur-
leigh said that Speese was al-ready a strong technical player when she got to Florida, and she came from the same sys-tem the Gators run, the 4-2-3-1.  Thus, learning to play without the ball was more important for Speese than any other aspect of her game.
  Speese was always the go-
to ball-handler in high school, but the forward had to learn to trust her teammates to get the ball back to her after she passes it off, Burleigh said.
  “She has learned the nuanc-
es of the players she is playing with,” Burleigh said.
  Junior midﬁ  elder McKenzie 
Barney said she has become a more effective player thanks to Speese’s strides.
  “I love playing with her be-
cause she can see exactly the type of runs I want to make and the types of runs that aren’t re-ally runs, but ones that I want to make to get the defender out of position,” Barney said.
  “It takes an amazing soccer 
mind to realize that.”

  Florida coach Mary Wise said her team should not look past Ole Miss, 
even though the Rebels currently have a 1-7 record in the SEC. 
  BRYAN HOLT
 Alligator Writer
   
 Ole Miss is the best 1-7 team 
the Southeastern Conference has 
ever seen.
  As ludicrous as that title  
might sound, it’s exactly how Florida volleyball coach Mary Wise has described the squad her team will face tonight at 8 in Oxford, Miss.
  “It seems like such a ﬂ  uke for 
all of us that their record is what it is,” Wise said.
  Last year the Rebels ﬁ  nished 
second to only LSU in the SEC’s West division. Ole Miss made its third trip to the NCAA Tourna-ment in ﬁ  ve years and picked up its ﬁ  rst-ever All-America selection in then-junior middle blocker Regina Thomas.
  Heading into 2011, expecta-
tions were high. The Rebels re-turned their leading player at each position on the court, also getting Thomas and fellow mid-dle blocker Courtney Cunning-ham back from season-ending ACL injuries.  “We have to stay healthy,” 
Ole Miss coach Joe Getzin said before the season. 
“That will be a crucial part of 
our game plan.” 
  But so far this year, the Reb-
els (5-11, 1-7 SEC) look nothing like they did last season. Thom-as took time to adjust to game-speed early in the year and is just now returning to All-Amer-ica form.
  “We all knew that as soon as 
they got h e a l t h y t h e y ’ d be really 
dangerous and it looks like they are healthy now, and we’ll get to see them playing their very best,” Wise said.
  The signs of an Ole Miss re-
surgence are on the horizon. On Sunday, Ole Miss went to Knox-ville, Tenn., and took the SEC’s ﬁ  rst-place team to match point in the ﬁ  fth set before losing, de-spite out-hitting the No. 19 Vol-unteers.
  “They deﬁ  nitely do a good job 
of exposing weaknesses, getting you out of your comfort zone, placing the ball in places where we’re going to have to work ex-tra hard to make sure we can get solid contact,” junior middle blocker Tangerine Wiggs said.
  Helping Ole Miss recently has 
been sophomore outside hitter Kara Morgan, who is currently just six kills shy of her season mark from 2010. Although the Rebels have been error-prone on offense, they are near the top of the conference in blocks. 
  “This is the same team it was 
last year, and their record was reversed,” junior middle blocker Betsy Smith said. “We totally re-spect them, and we’re ready for their best shot.”
  No. 13 Florida (13-3, 6-1 SEC) 
will look to continue its four-game winning streak in which the Gators have out-hit oppo-nents .355 to .188. And while Ole Miss might boast experi-ence, Florida players insist it’s that same experience that could hurt them.
  “We know a lot of their ten-
dencies already,” Wiggs said. “We have a pretty good picture of Ole Miss and their identity as a team.” 
 Despite record, No. 13 Gators not underestimating Rebels
a group. We’ll really be put to the test this week.”
  And when Florida gets put to the test, 
we should ﬁ  nally be able to get some an-swers. 
  There isn’t a single unit on the team that 
has performed consistently from week to week. 
  The rush defense was No. 5 in the nation after four games, allowing just 61 yards per contest. But that number quickly skyrock-eted, as UF gave up 232 yards per game against LSU and Alabama.
How good is the Gators’ rush defense?  Florida’s secondary was an unexpected 
bright spot in the ﬁ  rst ﬁ  ve weeks, giving up just 4.9 yards per attempt through the air.But LSU put up a dominating 15.4 yards per passing attempt against UF. Corner-backs Cody Riggs and Marcus Roberson, who had looked so good early in the sea-son, were both burned on deep balls
Which is the real Gators’ pass defense?  Chris Rainey and Jeff Demps were dom-
inant on the ground to start the year, high-lighted by UF’s matchup with Kentucky, where the Gators recorded 405 rushing yards. Against Alabama, just seven days later, they ran for 15. 
How strong is the Gators’ rushing 
game?
  Through ﬁ  ve weeks, senior quarterback 
John Brantley was leading a consistent passing attack, but now he’s out with an ankle injury.
So what’s UF’s passing offense going to 
look like?
  Even with half of Florida’s games al-
ready in the books, there are signiﬁ  cantly more questions than answers. 
  But this weekend, facing a middling op-
ponent for the ﬁ  rst time, the true Gators will have a chance to start showing them-selves.
