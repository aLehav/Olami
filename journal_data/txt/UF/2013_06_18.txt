Students and residents will have to alter 
their usual transportation routes to get from 
point A to point B between summer terms.
Regional Transit System will adjust bus 
routes between the Summer A and Summer B break. 
Beginning Saturday, UF campus service will 
be suspended, and city routes 21 and 38 will be canceled for the break. 
Routes 1, 9, 10, 12, 13, 16, 17, 20, 23, 34, 35, 36 
and 43 will have reduced services. Routes 2, 5, 6, 7, 8, 11, 15, 24, 25 and 75 will be unaffected. 
Later Gator routes, which haven’t been available since Summer A began, will resume July 5.
In observance of Independence Day, no 
buses will run July 4.
Chip Skinner, supervisor of marketing and 
communication for RTS, said that reduced service means that buses will run less frequently 
during the break. 
“The reason that is, is due to funding, 
which is between UF and Santa Fe College,” he 
said. “They account for over 50 percent of our 
operating budget.”
Skinner said RTS negotiates its services with 
the schools prior to each semester.

Midtown may be gaining another bar, 
but one of its late-night restaurants will be 
relocating.
Munchies 420 Cafe, a Midtown restau -
rant popular for late-night snacking, will be  replaced by The Rowdy Reptile bar.
Munchies, located at 1702 W. University Ave. in the UF Plaza, will be reopening at a different Gainesville location, but owner J.D. Chester said he couldn’t yet disclose where.
Chester, who also owns the downstairs 
bar Fat Daddy’s, said the space is being remodeled for The Rowdy Reptile, which will offer drink specials and affordable bar food.
The space has been undergoing reno -vations for about two weeks now, Chester said, and it could be open as soon as Fri -
day.
Although menu items and prices have 
not been finalized, he said he expects the most expensive menu item will cost about $4.
He said moving Munchies and replacing 
it with a bar was a better fit for the area’s consumer base.“The bar downstairs is so monumentally 
successful that we decided it made more sense,” Chester said.
The first of the two Munchies locations, 
which originated in Sarasota, was featured in the reality show Man v. Food about three years ago.
Chester said he felt that moving the 
Gainesville Munchies to a smaller space could evoke a small-town feel similar to that of the original restaurant.
The move will also give Munchies a Munchies 420 Cafe to relocate from Midtown’s UF Plaza
Former space will become The Rowdy Reptile barKELCEE GRIFFIS and LANDON WATNICK

A UF linebacker was arrested Sunday 
after police said he punched a bouncer 
over a cover charge.
A group of men was waiting in front 
of Kava Lounge, 1007 W. University Ave., when 19-year-old Antonio Morrison cut the line. 
He walked up to bouncer Omar Ala-
jlani to ask about the entrance fee, accord -
ing to a Gainesville Police arrest report. The lounge’s Facebook page lists its price range from $0 to $10.
At about 2 a.m., Morrison started argu -
ing with Alajlani and yelling because he didn’t want to pay full price, according to the report. 
“Don’t you know who I am? I’m a UF 
football player,” he said, according to the report.  “I’m Antonio!”
When Alajlani told Morrison he must 
pay full price, Morrison punched him in the head and left, according to the report.

Painting Workshop
Come to Painting from the Divine Feminine with Batya Weinbaum on July 13 from 10 a.m.-6 p.m. with an evening presentation and display by at least twice during the ordeal, ac-cording to a report Saturday in the Press Enterprise of Bloomsburg. But the group eventually yanked off the jar and set the animal free.
“I thought, ‘No one is go-
ing to believe us,’” said Morgan Laskowski, 22, the bartender at the Jamison City Hotel and a member of the impromptu bear-wrangling team.
Area residents first spotted the 
100-pound bruin with its head in a red jar on June 3, but it eluded game wardens. The animal was attracted to the container because it appeared to have once contained cooking oil.
“He put his head in and had a 
problem,” said Mike Jurbala, 68, another rescuer. “He’d have died in a couple more days.”
Jurbala saw the bear Thursday 
night as he was leaving the bar at the Jamison City Hotel. He called Jeff Hubler, a local employee of the state Game Commission who had been among those trying to cap-ture it for days with a lasso.
“You knew where he was be-
cause you could hear him banging into things,” Jurbala said.
Hubler said people should keep 
lids on food jars they throw away.
No joke: Jester wanted at Austrian hotel
VIENNA — Wanted: A jester. 
Wallflowers need not apply.
It’s no joke. An Austrian hotel 
is advertising for a modern-day court fool, who is communicative, extroverted, musical, creative and imaginative.
Applicants are asked to bring 
— and play — their musical in-strument during the job interview. Also welcome: creative costumes. The successful candidate will earn 1,400 euros — around $1,900 — a month.
Hotel director Melanie Franke 
says those interested should not think they’re on a fool’s errand in applying. She says the idea is to treat guests like royalty, noting that “jesters were a luxury that royal families indulged themselves in.”
The hotel in Austria’s Styria 
province was designed by famed Austrian artist Friedensreich Hun-dertwasser and Franke says the jester concept fits its hotel’s color-ful appearance.

the Alachua County Jail early Sunday on a 
charge of simple battery. 
He told officers he got into a scuffle with 
the bouncer, according to the report. 
He said he didn’t remember much be-
cause he was drunk at the time. 
He was later released. 
In an official statement, UF football 
spokesman Steve McClain said Will Mus-champ was aware of the situation and was handling it. 
Morrison was expected to start at middle 
linebacker in the 2013 season as a sopho-more after being listed as a starter on UF’s first depth chart released by Muschamp fol-lowing spring practices.
He arrived at Florida in 2012 as a four-
star recruit out of Bolingbrook, Ill., and ap-peared in all 13 games last year — starting three in the regular season.
Morrison finished 2012 with 34 tackles, 
a sack and a forced fumble — a key play against Florida State that shifted momen-tum in Florida’s favor during its 37-26 vic-tory Nov. 24.
He is the 14th Gator arrested or cited 
since Muschamp began his tenure at Florida in January 2011, including former players Janoris Jenkins and Matt Elam and current players Marcus Roberson and Loucheiz Pu-rifoy.
The last Gator football player arrested for 
battery was A.C. Leonard, who police said physically abused his longtime girlfriend in February 2012, according to Alligator ar-chives.4, ALLIGATOR � TUESDAY, JUNE 18, 2013

Ben Meyers said he first saw the 
word when he drove past the wall on 
the morning of June 11. 
“S--t” was spray-painted black 
against a yellow background about 5 feet long.
“When I first drove by, I didn’t believe 
what I was seeing,” said the 23-year-old food and resource economics first-year graduate student.  “The second time I drove by I was like, ‘Woah.’ Then I took a Snapchat.”
But by the next morning, the profani-ty on the 34th Street Wall was gone. An-other artist painted over it and spelled out “Happy Summer” in big, black let-ters.
The incident isn’t isolated, but it’s 
also not rampant.
Gainesville Police spokesman Offi-
cer Ben Tobias said any type of graffiti is technically illegal citywide, but al-lowing the 34th Street Wall tradition to continue is an unwritten rule.
“We have never had an arrest related to someone posting graffiti on the wall,” he said.
In recent years, the 1,120-foot-long 
landmark has experienced few inci-dents of profanity, said Gina Hawkins, the executive director of Keep Alachua County Beautiful. She said she can re-call two. 
But Hawkins said that the organiza-
tion is rarely notified of incidents be-cause other graffiti artists usually paint over any distasteful remarks.
Tobias agreed that the wall is moder-
ated by residents. 
“The wall almost polices itself,” To-
bias said. “People maintain the wall.” 34th Street Wall polices itself against grafitti

chance to create a better atmosphere, he 
said.
“It needs bumper stickers all over the 
wall,” Chester said. “This place is just too big for that.”
The new location could possibly be a 
Munchies Express, Chester said, but all of the most popular items will be there.
Crispyn Coller, a 23-year-old UF 
alumnus who works at UF Plaza, said he was a little disappointed by the deci-sion to turn the space into a bar because there are already so many drink venues in Midtown.
Munchies contributed to Midtown, 
Coller said, because it stayed open later than other nearby establishments.
Coller said he usually ate at Munch-
ies because it was convenient, and now that it’s moving, he said he’ll miss the Dankalicious Chicken Nugs, which he said were his favorite.
“If (the new location) is in the area, 
I would eat there,” Coller said. “But I wouldn’t necessarily go out of my way.”

LifeSouth Community Blood 
Center received approval for a 
cord blood manufacturing license from the Food and Drug Admin-istration.
This achievement means UF, 
along with UF Health Shands Hospital and LifeSouth will be able to help more people, said LifeSouth Media Specialist Gary Kirkland. LifeCord, a program of LifeSouth, is the first blood bank in Florida and fifth in the nation to earn the license.
Dr. John Wingard, director for 
UF Health Shands Hospital Bone Marrow Transplant Unit and deputy director for research at UF Health Cancer Center, said cord blood is important because some-times people cannot find bone marrow matches for transplants. With cord blood, the matching process is more flexible, allowing more people to get what is neces-sary for their health.
Wingard said stem cells are 
taken from newborns’ already-de-tached umbilical cords and frozen in a blood bank. They’ll eventu-ally be used to treat diseases like sickle cell anemia and leukemia.
“The unique thing about the 
cord blood is that the immunity of a newborn is very immature, and we don’t require any stringent matching with the recipient, mak-ing it very attractive,” Wingard said.  
Kirkland said the road to the approval was a long one.
In 1996, the three groups creat-
ed a cooperative agreement. From there, they set out to meet their goal of getting the license for cord blood manufacturing.
“When we originally started, 
we were a new drug protocol,” Kirkland said. “We were trying to figure out how this cord blood stuff worked, and what was the best way to go about it.”
Investigation into questions 
like these, along with 17 years of rigorous procedures, was what he said finally made achieving the goal possible.
“We got the license, and now 
we’re going to have even higher standards,” Kirkland said.
Not only will the transplants 
be given to more people in need, but they will also be held to FDA standards, making the procedure safer than before, he said.

A woman was arrested 
Wednesday after police 
saidthey found hundreds of names, birth dates and social security numbers written on pages in her car.
Tallahassee resident Lutia 
Satedra Pratt, 23, was driv-ing a white Volkswagen with three passengers when Florida Highway Patrol Trooper H. E. Ogden pulled her over for fol-lowing too closely, according to the arrest report.
The officer smelled mari-
juana and had a drug-sniffing dog search the car, according to the report.
The search resulted in lo-
cating two small plastic bags of marijuana, according to the report, and several notebooks filled with hundreds of names and identifications.
Most of the information 
was handwritten, but some of it appeared to be copied from medical records, according to the report, and some of the in-formation had dollar amounts written beside it. Pratt said she wrote the information down and planned to sell it, accord-ing to the report.
One of the passengers, 
Voronica Polite, 23, said one of the notebooks with about 65 names in it belonged to her. Another passenger, Timothy Walker, said the marijuana belonged to him.
Pratt was arrested on 428 
counts of fraud/imperson-ation, and Polite was arrested on 65 counts.
As of press time, Polite had 
been released, but Pratt re-mained in the Alachua County Jail with bond set at $856,000.A Gainesville man was ar-
rested early Monday morning after police say they found items in his ex-girlfriend’s apartment drenched with tea and milk.

James Alford found Rhawnlie Anne Brown’s couch, laptop, bed and pillows covered with milk and tea, according the ar-rest report.
Daniel Eli Hoffner said he 
was angry with Brown about their relationship and said he splashed her belongings, ac-cording to the report.
Alford also found mari-
juana inside a cigarette pack in Hoffner’s pocket, according to the report.
Brown was arrested and 
booked into the Alachua County Jail on charges of criminal mischief and posses-sion of less than 20 grams of cannabis. As of press time he remained there with bond set at $5,000.

Obama’s problem 
in the Middle East
Some time ago, the president said the use of chemical weap-
ons against rebels in Syria would constitute crossing a “red line.” 
Now, that red line has been crossed. Syria, which has been in a state of civil war for about two years, is said to have used sarin, a nerve gas, against rebels. This puts President Barack Obama in a difﬁ  cult position. What should he do in regard to Syria?
Some say there isn’t yet enough evidence to say that any red 
lines have been crossed. The White House wants the United Na-tions to investigate whether chemical weapons were used at all. 
Others believe that action is the clear next step. Although the 
president has said he doesn’t want any “American boots on the ground in Syria,” there is still plenty of room to help the opposi-tion.
Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., has been a supporter in recent 
days of intervention in Syria. He believes we should create a safe zone for the rebels, institute a no-ﬂ  y zone over the country and then arm the right rebel groups, according to a video released April 25 by the Associated Press on YouTube. 
Those on the other side believe we should stay far away 
from the Syrian exchange. Russia in particular has taken a vocal stance against American intervention in Syria. On Monday, the Foreign Ministry of Russia said it would not abide with no-ﬂ  y zones in Syria. 
Russian President Vladimir Putin spoke up about the arm-
ing of rebels after a meeting with British Prime Minister David Cameron: “One does not really need to support the people who not only kill their enemies, but open up their bodies, eat their intestines in front of the public and cameras,” Putin said, prob-ably referring to an incident involving a rebel commander who was ﬁ  lmed cutting a dead soldier’s torso and biting into a piece of his organ. 
The G8 summit, which started Monday, was already off to 
a rocky start with the Syrian conﬂ  ict taking a central role. But with 93,000 dead already over the course of the conﬂ  ict, why is it suddenly so important? Is the use of chemical weapons really the reason we are on the verge of getting involved?
Some remind us of the propensity of our government to 
keep us in the dark. As Bradley Manning and Edward Snowden have taught, the government does keep secrets, and oftentimes they’re secrets that the American public aren’t in favor of. Could there be a secret here, too?
Speaking of the American public, a recent Gallup poll shows 
that the majority of Americans are not in favor of arming the Syrian rebels. Will that affect the president’s decision to inter-vene? 
Others remind us of the problems that started when Osama 
bin Laden, himself once a “freedom ﬁ  ghter,” was armed by the U.S. years ago to ﬁ  ght the Soviets. Would intervention create a future problem for the U.S.?
The answers to all of these questions are unclear right now, 
but with pressure closing in on all sides, Obama has a tough de-cision to make. No matter what he decides, he’s sure to frustrate a lot of people. Let’s hope he makes his decision for the right reasons. The Tea Party movement is a farce
It is beyond comprehension why anyone would con-
sider the Tea Party movement to be any different than Occupy Wall Street. Both movements were spurred by 
a sense that something was wrong, but neither seemed to know quite exactly what it was. Both movements were up in arms about the Wall Street bailout, but one group blamed Washington while the other blamed Wall Street. Though I feel both movements are equally laughable, at least the Occupiers are consistent in their ideology as op-posed to the Tea Partiers, who exemplify a strangely mix-matched, ideologically inconsistent, statist agenda.
What could have become a singular movement against 
corporate welfare during the height of the Occupy and Tea Party movements instead became yet another left-ver-sus-right rhetoric battle.  Despite both movements being fed up with Washington shoveling money to politically connected businessmen, and both agreeing that the mid-dle class was being shafted, one of these two movements refused to join in solidarity with the opposite side of the aisle. Not surprisingly, that movement was the Tea Party.
Despite their commonalities with Occupy Wall Street, 
Tea Partiers reacted to Occupiers the way any conserva-tive right-winger would react to anything they don’t un-derstand: with hostility and a pointed ﬁ  nger.
Tea Partiers parade themselves around as if they are 
limited government enthusiasts just as Occupiers parade themselves around as collectivist radicals. The only dif-ference is that Occupiers are collectivists through and through while Tea Partiers merely employ libertarian jar-gon while supporting big government, big spending and socially backward politicians. I believe this is why people tend to see the left as the “good guys” and the right as the “bad guys.” As terrible of a reality as it is, at least the left doesn’t lie about its bad intentions.
Two of the Tea Party’s shining stars in Washington 
are Rick Santorum and Paul Ryan, both who exemplify the very behavior the Tea Party seems so vehemently op-posed to. Both of these ortho-dox cavemen supported the No Child Left Behind, the Medicare Modernization Act, housing and infrastructure subsidies as well as the invasion of Iraq and Af-ghanistan, all of which cost the American taxpayer more than an arm and a leg. The combination 
of this progressive spending agenda with hypernational-ism and religious extremism comparable to that of radical Islamists makes for a political sideshow act only conserva-tives can pull off.
A vast majority of Tea Partiers are also anti-LGBT and 
anti-abortion, two positions that require massive govern-ment intrusion into personal freedoms that have econom-ic impacts as profound as their social impact. Unlike the Tea Party, at least Occupy Wall Street is open about huge spending and employing bailouts again, except this time to bailout indebted college students as opposed to bank-ers. Both movements demonstrate the tendency to respond with knee-jerk reactions to any stimuli and are incapable of reacting logically in the face of turmoil.
The Tea Party is the Christian right’s cry of mourning 
for the George W. Bush years, despite the fact that Bush’s surveillance state radicalism has now been normalized under Obama. Bush’s tax policy for the middle class and building the American empire abroad are two more ex-amples of the many commonalities Bush and Obama pos-sess.  
The Tea Party should just throw in the towel, return to 
being simply referred to as Republicans and quit stealing Libertarian rhetoric to propagate lies about its platform. At least Occupy Wall Street is honest about wanting to repeat the very same actions that got us here in the ﬁ  rst place.

� ADULT SMARTPHONE USERS 
NOW TOTAL 56 PERCENT.

Most Americans now own smart-
phones.
According to a recent Pew Research 
Center study, smartphone ownership is 
especially high among adults in their 20s and 30s and those with relatively high education and household income levels.
According to the study, 56 percent of 
all American adults now own a smart-phone.
Gainesville smartphone technician 
Ben Steele said he attributes the rising smartphone ownership to the fact that they’re becoming a necessity to daily life. 
“The amount of information people 
need on a daily basis is massive,” Steele said.
Tan Wong, a professor of electrical 
and computer engineering at UF whose main research interest areas include wireless communication and networks, said varying demographic groups use their devices differently.
Wong said the rise in ownership may 
be because smartphones have become relatively inexpensive — not to mention their convenience and utility.
Kristin Hawkins, a 20-year-old UF 
health science junior, said she doesn’t know how she would survive without a smartphone.
“It’s my everything,” she said. “With-
out one, I think a person is limited.”� THE STATE HEADQUARTERS

The Florida branch of Future 
Farmers of America will soon call 
Gainesville its home. 
The organization geared toward 
teaching middle- and high-school-ers about agriculture announced plans to build a new 6,000-square-foot state headquarters on Florida Farm Bureau’s property at 5700 SW 34th St. 
The project will cost about $1.5 
million, said G.B. Crawford, a spokesman for the Florida Farm Bu-reau. Individual donors, businesses and private groups will contribute $150,000 toward the construction of the building, he said. 
Ronnie Simmons, the executive 
director of Florida Future Farmers of America Association, said the organization has been leasing office space at the Farm Bureau office for the last two decades. 
“Not only will the new facility 
give us quadruple the space, but it will allow us meeting space, confer-ence facilities, dormitories for our student officers and an increased in-house production capacity to better serve the needs of our 17,000 Florida FFA members,” Simmons wrote in an email. 
The current state headquarters 
is located about 130 miles south of Gainesville in Haines City.
Simmons said the new head-
quarters location can bring more op-portunities for students.
Grady Roberts, an associate pro-
fessor at UF, said Gainesville is a good choice for the headquarters be-cause the university’s Department of Agriculture Education and Com-munication already works closely with Future Farmers of America. 
“This will allow the Florida FFA 
Association to more effectively and more efficiently deliver their pro-grams that may have an indirect im-pact on the university,” he said.
Kaitlyn Donaghy, a 20-year-old 
UF agricultural education and com-munication junior and an officer in the UF Collegiate Future Farmers of America chapter, agreed. 
“I feel confident that the mem-
bers will benefit directly,” she said. “I can only imagine the possibilities that will be opened up.”8, ALLIGATOR � TUESDAY, JUNE 18, 2013

Although the outline of the officers’ bul-
letproof vests still showed beneath their blue 
polos, and guns glared from holsters on their belts, they smiled kindly at the room full of elementary school children jammed into the humid Pine Ridge Community Center.
One-by-one, the children waited to stand 
with GPD Officer Mose Rochelle, who rested his hands on their shoulders and praised them for their contributions to the summer camp. 
Then, he handed them diplomas. “This community is important because you 
are important,” he said.
On Friday, 12 children graduated from the 
five-day pilot program GREAT. GPD hosted the summer camp in a low-income housing complex in northwest Gainesville.
The international program GREAT — Gang 
Resistance Education and Training — was originally formed to combat a trend of large-city gangs recruiting elementary-age children to commit crimes, Rochelle said.
During the five-day camp, GPD officers 
taught children alternatives to using violence to settle disagreements, and they led the chil-dren in role playing to practice conflict man-agement.
The Pine Ridge camp was the trial run 
for the violence prevention program in Gainesville, Rochelle said, and at least four more camps in other neighborhoods are slated for the summer.
“We’re going to be following up all over 
the city in all different kind of areas,” he said.
After the ceremony, 6-year-old Destiny 
stood by the window eating a cupcake. She grinned and said that “not fighting others” was her take-home application from the week.
Her mother, Cantrice Johnson, said the 
program reinforced positive social skills, such as “the polite way to make a friend.”
“It’s great,” she said. “It’s making kids dif-
ferent.”Kids graduate from GPD campLOCAL iPhone, uPhone: majority of

In a new survey, about 90 percent of les-
bian, gay, bisexual or transgender adults said 
society is more accepting of them now than it was 10 years ago, and they expect the trend to continue. 
The Pew Research Center survey found 
59 percent of 1,200 LGBT adults said there is some acceptance of the population, 19 per-cent said there is a lot of social acceptance and 21 percent said there is little or no ac-ceptance.
A UF Student Ambassador for LGBT Af-
fairs and 20-year-old linguistics junior Iain Randall said he feels tolerance is increasing because LGBT issues like marriage equality are becoming more public.
According to the survey, 58 percent of 
LGBT adults said they had been exposed to some type of discrimination — usually in the form of jokes and slurs. Nearly 40 percent said a family member or friend had rejected them because of their identity and 30 percent said they had been threatened or physically attacked.
“I’ve experienced my share of disrespect-
ful slurs to get a rise out of me, but it never works,” Randall said. “It is something that can affect individuals in our community be-cause it’s degrading and wears down on you after a time.”
About half of the people surveyed said all 
or most of the important people in their lives know they’re LGBT. Fifty-six percent have let their mother know their sexual preference or gender, and 39 percent told their fathers.
“For a lot of people there’s a percep-
tion that women are more accepting due to the socialization and experience of being a woman,” UF Director of LGBT Affairs Lau-ren “LB” Hannahs said. “When it comes to masculinity and homophobia, there’s always been a double standard.”
LGBT adults feel more socially 
accepted, Pew survey shows
Other findings from the survey 
include:
� 23 percent said Barack Obama is most

� 18 percent said Ellen DeGeneres
� 3 percent named Anderson Cooper
� 3 percent named Hillary Clinton

About $75 million in renova-
tions and reconstruction at the Reitz 
Union will begin soon. 
Fencing and barricades are 
around the colonnade in prepara-tion for its demolition, scheduled for the end of July, said executive director Eddie Daniels. The founda-tion for a new addition will be con-structed in October.
The infrastructure being built in 
place of the colonnade will go up to the third floor. It will connect the Constans Theatre to the doors of the Reitz Union. The new union will be about 90,000 square feet larger, Daniels said.
“One of the things we want this 
building to be is uniquely UF,” he said. 
Cannon Design and Joe Walker 
architects are heading the project. Surveys, focus groups and meetings were conducted to ask students, staff and faculty for input before the design process began.
“Instead of closed-off spaces, the 
Reitz will be more open, allowing students to collaborate, network and get involved,” Student Body Presi-dent Christina Bonarrigo wrote in an email. “It’s truly a facility for the way we socialize and engage with one another.”
The Reitz Union was built in 
1967 when the school had about 20,000 students and 150 clubs and organizations, Daniels said. UF now has about 50,000 students and more than 950 clubs and organizations. 
“The Reitz was originally built 
for 19,000 students,” Bonarrigo said. “More than 20,000 students use the facility every day.” 
Planned changes include a new-
and-improved Orange & Brew, more study spaces and dance stu-dios.“The design presents an inter-
esting new direction in the archi-tecture of the campus by stepping away from the brick aesthetic that our campus is so well-recognized for without completely abandoning its roots,” said 22-year-old UF alum-nus Mark Dunn.
Discussion for renovations be-
gan in 2008. In 2009, engineers sur-veyed the Reitz Union. Their report showed about $42 million worth of deferred maintenance issues.
“Some of the systems in this 
building are over 45 years old,” Daniels said, “Like some of the plumbing, the electrical and some of the HVAC [heating, ventilation and air conditioning] equipment. We knew there were some pretty critical issues there that needed to be dealt with.”
The project is to be completed in 
Fall 2015, but the Reitz Union will continue to operate during recon-struction.
“I look forward to the changes,” 
said UF 20-year-old nursing junior and Reitz Union worker Carolyn Harnish. “However, all the in-between, the construction, the de-molition — it’s going to be quite a pain.”
Student fees will not be increased, 
Daniels said. The only money being used from students is existing activ-ity and service fees.
“This is going to be just a great, 
great building once it’s done,” he said.

Alligator Contributing Writer
In January 2006, the first World Race 
launched in Mexico.
On July 4, a UF alumna will begin her 
World Race in Atlanta.
Katie Olson, 22, graduated in May 2012 
with degrees in psychology and applied phys-
iology and kinesiology. She’s been preparing for the World Race since her graduation.
The World Race is an 11-month mission 
trip across 11 countries, which includes Thai-land, South Africa and India. Olson will join 46 other people in one of four squads.
Every year, there are three World Race 
start dates: one in January, one in July and one in September. 
According to the World Race website, 
about 600 people between the ages of 21 and 35 take part in the mission trip every year. 
After passing an application process, Ol-
son and her teammates attended a weeklong training camp.
“It was an intensive week in the wilder-
ness in north Georgia to prepare us for some of the conditions, allow us to meet our squad, to learn some of what we’d be doing and to get in the right mindset,” she said. In the year leading up 
to the race launch, Ol-son worked to fundraise $15,500, which covers air-fare to the 11 countries, food, water and other ne-
cessities. 
Additional costs include 
vaccinations, which are 
required for internations travel, a tent, sleep-ing bag and transportation to Georgia for the training camp and to the launch pad in July. 
Olson has been outside the United States 
three times, all of which were trips to Europe. She has never been to an impoverished coun-try. UF nursing student Kimberly Swanson, 23, 
has experience in those areas. She has volun-teered in Cameroon, Senegal, Kenya and the Republic of Georgia.
“You don’t think about your culture until 
you’re forced to see a different culture and setting,” Swanson said. “Learning diversity allows for education.”
Packing for 11 months is a challenge for 
Olson. Everything she will need for almost a year must fit in a hiking backpack and day-pack. 
She said the nerves haven’t kicked in yet, 
but she expects them to.
“It is a giant leap of faith and way beyond 
anything I’ve ever done before,” Olson said.Eleven months, 11 countries: UF alumna to join World Race

UF Alumni Association has part-
nered with Tailgate Guys for the up-
coming football season.
The company, which sets up and 
takes down everything fans need to tailgate, will operate on the Reitz Union’s North Lawn on home game days. 
Chip Howard, UAA’s executive associate athletics director for inter-nal affairs, said in a press release he feels Tailgate Guys will enhance the gameday experience.
Tailgate Guys started in 2009 at 
Auburn University and has spread to Texas A&M University, the Chick-fil-A Bowl and now UF, said Tailgate Guys President and CEO Parker Duffey.
“The amount of real estate that 
[UF] site allows is about the same that we have at Auburn,” Duffey said. 
“We have had a standby list 
[there] for about two years now.”
The company offers four pack-
ages: the Varsity Package, the All Gator Package, the Club Package and the Media Package. Prices start at $300 and can be customized, Duf-fey said.
Options include supplies like 
tents, chairs, coolers, paper goods, koozies, tables with tablecloths and TVs with satellite service. Packages went on sale for reservation last month.
Erica Macon, a 20-year-old UF 
animal sciences junior, said she wishes she’d thought of the Tailgate Guys idea.
“First, I didn’t even know that ex-
isted, but the company sounds awe-some,” Macon said. “If one wanted to tailgate and didn’t want all the hassle of setting up, this is the way to go because they have variable op-tions that could suit anyone.”
Duffey said rain or shine, as long 
as the Gators play, the Tailgate Guys will stay.

UF students will soon have 3-D printing 
capabilities, use of more iPads and access to 
Wi-Fi in the Natural Area Teaching Lab in the southwest corner of campus, thanks to the 2013 technology fee awards.
The technology fee awards focus on en-
hancing instructional technology resources, said UF Information Technology spokeswom-an Tracy Gale. The money for the projects comes from a state-mandated technology fee, which was ﬁ  rst implemented at UF in 2009.
This year, about $700,000 in funding was 
allocated for 11 upcoming campus projects.
“Technology changes so fast,” she said. 
“The tech fee allows us to deliver cutting-edge software and services to meet the changing needs of not only the technology but our stu-dents and faculty.”
Gale said students, faculty and staff were 
all eligible to submit proposals. In May, a com-mittee evaluated this year’s 30 submissions. The winners will receive funding in August.
The committee looks for proposals that 
will improve the academic technology envi-ronment for the greatest number of students, she said.With funding being allocated in the Fall, 
Gale said, the time it takes to implement the projects will vary. Proposals that call for class-room renovation would take place in the sum-mer, she said.
Sara Gonzalez, a science and technology li-
brarian, applied and received funding for the 3-D printer that will be in the Marston Science Library. Because several ﬁ  elds are now requir-ing employees to be able to use these printers, she said, the 3-D printer is something students should become experienced with before they graduate.
Peggy Carr, associate dean and professor 
for the College of Design, Construction and Planning, received funding for the creation of a joint digital fabrication laboratory.
“We think that this is an area of student in-
terest that is going to grow,” she said. “We re-ally feel like it’s essential to have these facilities for our students.”UF funds technology projects

An Oaks Mall department store is get-
ting a major makeover — $3.7 million 
worth. 
Renovations aimed at expanding mer-
chandise and offering a more upscale shopping environment are now under-way at Belk.
“Our new store will reﬂ  ect the latest in 
retail layout, decor and merchandise pre-sentation,” store manager Dan Mixson said in a press release from Belk. 
The new store will feature refurbished 
restrooms and ﬁ  tting rooms, more de-signer brands and a 6,000-square-foot women’s shoe department, Mixson said. A Coach section will also join merchan-dise on the ﬂ  oor. 
The renovations will put all women’s 
merchandise on the ﬁ  rst ﬂ  oor and men’s merchandise on the second ﬂ  oor, said Michael Gravley, vice president regional manager for North Florida. Construction is slated for completion Oct. 1.
The store also has a special event in the 
works which will coincide with the end of the renovations, Mixson said. It will host a gala on the evening of Oct. 13, and the proceeds from the $5 tickets will beneﬁ  t the United Way of Alachua County.
However, the ofﬁ  cial grand reopening 
is set for Oct. 16.  
Kim Hunter, a 39-year-old Gainesville 
resident, said she expects the changes will create a better experience for shoppers.
“I think the renovations make it a 
friendlier, neater environment,” she said. 
Meanwhile, 20-year-old biology junior 
Sabrina Urs said the renovations aren’t too much of a hassle while shopping.
“The construction is a bit of an eye-
sore, but I think they’re keeping the store really organized under the circumstanc-es,” she said.
Belk ﬁ  rst opened the Gainesville loca-
tion in 1941. It moved to The Oaks Mall in 1978 and hasn’t been remodeled since 1996, according to the release. Belk gets costly makeover

Florida basketball picks up 2015 recruit
Kevarrius Hayes, a forward out of Suwannee High in Live Oak, committed 
to Florida on Monday. Hayes is Billy Donovan’s ﬁ  rst commitment for the Class of 2015. Former Gator named to USA team
Former Florida softball player Michelle Moultrie was named to the USA Softball Women’s National Team on Friday.Former UF golfer Billy Horschel stunned golf fans with performance, pants at U.S. Open. See story, page 20  “Do you know who I am? I am a UF 
football player. I am Antonio.”
  That’s what Florida linebacker An-
tonio Morrison told a bouncer at the Kava Lounge early Sunday morning, according to Gainesville Police Department spokes-man Ben Tobias.
  If you hadn’t already heard, Morrison 
was arrested after punching that bouncer in the head when he didn’t allow Morri-son free entry into the club, according to a police report.
  Is that the kind of culture being perpet-
uated at Florida? 
  Former coach Urban Meyer was criti-
cized for letting the players run the team and not exerting enough control over his players off the ﬁ  eld.   On the other hand, Will Muschamp was 
praised early in his tenure at Florida for getting his players in line. Muschamp was the no-nonsense leader. He was going to ﬁ  x UF football’s attitude problem.
  He even made a statement early in his 
head coaching career, opting to dismiss All-Southeastern Conference cornerback Janoris Jenkins from the team after Jen-kins’ second arrest for marijuana posses-sion in a three-month span.
  But since Muschamp took over as the 
Gators’ head coach in January 2011, 14 UF players have been arrested or cited – an average of more than ﬁ  ve players a year. That’s not the kind of statistic that wins bowl games.
  He’s quickly approaching former coach Urban Meyer’s gaudy total of 30 players arrested. Meyer averaged ﬁ  ve players ar-rested per year.
  The best you 
can say for Mus-champ is that 
most of the players under his watch were arrested for nonviolent crimes. Most were arrested for possessing alcohol or marijua-na. However, there have been more seri-ous crimes under Muschamp. 
  Tight end A.C. Leonard was charged 
with battery. Leonard was arrested in Feb-ruary 2012 after he a ﬁ  ght with his girl-friend.  Offensive lineman Jessamen Dunker 
was arrested for grand theft auto in Janu-ary.
  Where does it end? Where does it even 
begin? Are the players who come to Flor-ida thugs, or is the atmosphere conducive to players thinking they can do what they want?
  Is the Kava Lounge cover too damn 
high?
  Or maybe it’s the fans.   Maybe it’s the treatment that Morrison 
and other players get from regular fans and boosters that make them think they’re the kings of Gainesville.
  Morrison thought he deserved to walk

Michael Frazier II has achieved his summer 
goal. 
The rising sophomore guard made the USA Bas-
ketball U19 squad’s ﬁ  nal 12-man roster, the team announced Monday night following its evening training session in Colorado Springs. 
“Getting down to 12 is the real hard part because 
in a lot of respects we [easily] could have kept 14-15,” said Florida and USA U19 coach Billy Dono-van.
“There were some tough decisions, difﬁ  cult deci-
sions, but I think we feel overall that we have select-ed an athletic and versatile team. Our style of play will be an aggressive, up-tempo, running, pressing style. From an execution standpoint we’ve got to get better there, a lot of the other teams over there have been together for quite some time and that’s probably a strength of their teams, so we felt that we have to rely on some athleticism.”
As a freshman in 2012-13, Frazier averaged 5.6 
points on 44.6 percent shooting in 18 minutes per game. Of players who took at least 100 shots, he ﬁ  nished with the highest three-point shooting per-centage (.468) on Florida.
The 6-foot-4 Tampa native showcased his abil-
ity to crash the boards, averaging 3.1 rebounds per contest. His 34 assists were ﬁ  fth best on UF. 
The USA U19 squad will compete at the 2013 
FIBA U19 World Championships in Prague from June 27 to July 7. 
The team shifts its training camp to the Washing-ton Wizards’ practice facility in Washington, D.C., on Wednesday. 
Ryan Arcidiacono (Villanova), Damyean Dotson 
(Oregon), Marcus Georges-Hunt (Georgia Tech) and James Robinson (Pittsburgh) were eliminated from the ﬁ  nal cut. 
“Obviously there’s been a physical toll on them, 
but I don’t think you can underestimate the mental toll of these kids trying so hard to make the team,” Donovan said. “I think the focus up to this point of time by them has been ‘make the team,’ ‘make the team,’ ‘make the team,’ and we’ve got to now move it towards trying to win.”

TRACK AND FIELD
� GATORS RETURN EDDIE LOVETT, 
MARQUIS DENDY, BUT LOSE OMAR CRADDOCK, JEREMY POSTIN.
GORDON STREISAND
Alligator Writer
With the 2013 track and field season in 
the books, Florida looks to 2014, trying to 
sustain the momentum it has been carrying for three years.
The Gators men won their first NCAA 
Championship during the 2010 indoor sea-son. Since then, the men have won either an indoor or outdoor title every year. In 2012, Florida swept both the indoor and outdoor championships.
Key performers for the men this sea-
son included senior Omar Craddock in the triple jump, junior Eddie Lovett in the hurdles, sophomore Marquis Dendy in the long jump and the 4x400 meter relay squad. 
Craddock earned the Southeastern Con-
ference and NCAA titles in the outdoor men’s triple jump, and he was the runner-up indoors for both the Southeastern Con-ference and NCAA indoor meets.
Lovett’s peak success this season came 
indoors, earning the SEC and NCAA titles in the 60m hurdles. In the outdoor season, he was runner-up at both SECs and NCAAs in the 110m hurdles. 
Like Lovett, Dendy also flourished in-
doors, winning SEC and NCAA indoor titles in the long jump. 
However, it was the 4x4 squad that ex-
emplified 2013 for the Gators. 
Freshmen Najee Glass and Arman Hall, 
and sophomores Hugh Graham Jr. and De-dric Dukes powered the Gators to their sec-ond consecutive national outdoor title. 
The Gators trailed by nine points head-
ing into the event. The team won the race, earning 10 points and clinching a share of the title for UF. 
This season, the Florida men also fin-
ished second in three events to SEC cham-pion Arkansas at the SEC Indoor and Out-door Championships and at the NCAA Indoor Championships. Although the women did not have the 
same level of success as the men, they had a strong season in their own right as they tried to defend their 2012 SEC indoor title. 
At the SEC Indoor 
Championships, junior Cory McGee won titles in the women’s mile and as a member of the women’s distance medley relay 
squad along with Mandy Perkins, Agata Strausa and Amani Bryant. 
Collectively, the women turned in a 
fourth-place finish. 
The women also won two titles at the 
SEC Outdoor Championships. 
Underclassmen Ciarra Brewer and 
Marija Vucenovic won titles in the long jump and javelin throw, respectively. 
But like indoors, the Gator women 
finished fourth at the outdoor champion-ships. 
Heading into the 2014 season, the Gators 
have some big shoes to fill, although the turnover this year won’t be nearly as hard as the transition from 2012 to 2013. 
After the 2012 campaign, Florida lost 
Olympians Jeff Demps, Tony McQuay and Genevieve LaCaze. 
This season, they lose seniors Craddock, 
Jeremy Postin, Leo Seymore, David Triassi, Amani Bryant, Ugonna Ndu and Perkins. 
However, both teams have youth wait-
ing in the wings for their turn. 
One athlete who takes the center stage 
in 2014 will be Dendy, a junior looking to fill Craddock’s shoes. Dendy competes in both the men’s triple jump and long jump. 
Dendy was named an honorable men-
tion on the United States Track and Field and Cross Country Coaches Association All-American team.
“Thats why we recruited Marquis,” 
coach Mike Holloway said. “He showed flashes of brilliance this year. 
We’ve got to get Marquis to be a little 
more focused during the outdoor season. Marquis told me that his plan is to get 20 points at nationals next year. I’m not go-ing to argue with him. That’d be my plan also.”
Florida seniors cap successful careers with outdoor title
Craddock
into a club, free of charge. Morrison is a 
sophomore linebacker who has started three games at UF. He’s not quite Tim Tebow. 
  Most people don’t seem to care what 
players do off the ﬁ  eld if they perform on Saturdays. But we’ve seen what happens when a program gets too big for its own good, when people turn a blind eye to what happens behind the scenes: People get hurt.
  Muschamp needs to right his ship in-
stead of just blowing smoke.

alligator.org.   Scottie Wilbekin was suspended indeﬁ  nitely 
from the UF basketball team for the second time in eight months last week. Wilbekin 
violated undisclosed team rules, according to the school. Wilbekin will need to battle for play-ing time. Although basketball season is months away, alligatorSports editors Adam Lichtenstein and Landon Watnick will debate whether Wil-bekin will have a major impact for the Gators next season if he’s a member of Florida’s roster come October.
  
  Adam: If Billy Donovan goes bald, you can blame Scottie Wilbekin.
  The senior has 
been a major head-ache for the veteran coach, and you can tell Wilbekin has fallen out of Dono-van’s favor.
  Donovan sus-
pended Wilbekin at the beginning of the 2012-13 season and started traditional shoot-ing guard Kenny Boynton at the point for the ﬁ  rst time in his college career.  With Wilbekin’s 
second suspension in the past eight months and other options at point guard on the roster, don’t be surprised if Donovan takes an even harsher stance towards Wilbekin’s 
shenanigans this time around.
  Although the team has not disclosed what 
Wilbekin did to draw Donovan’s ire, a ﬁ  ve-game suspension or longer seems likely for the repeat offender. 
  Fool me once, shame on you. Fool Dono-
van twice, and he’ll put you on the bench for a while. That’s where Wilbekin will be for much of the season.
    Landon: History should repeat itself in 
the Wilbekin saga.
  When Florida ﬁ  rst suspended him on 
Nov. 8 for breaking team rules, we initially thought his developmental curve would ﬂ  at-line. 
  We were wrong.  Despite missing Florida’s ﬁ  rst two reg-
ular-season contests, Wilbekin worked his way back into the rotation and eventually re-earned his starting role by Game 6 of 2012-13. The junior responded well to Donovan’s punishment and had a breakout season, aver-aging 9.1 points, ﬁ  ve assists and 2.9 rebounds in 31.9 minutes per game. 
  During his sophomore season, Wilbekin 
averaged 2.6 points and 1.6 assists in limited playing time.
  It’s obvious in the face of this latest sus-
pension that he became too complacent and reverted back to his old bad habits – what-ever they may be. We’ve seen Wilbekin re-spond to adversity before, and I’m sure he’ll get his head back in the game, respond again and have another solid season. 
    Adam: That’s if he even has a chance to 
have a solid season.
  Wilbekin could have assaulted a referee 
in the middle of a game on ESPN last season and still would have been in the lineup at point guard.
  Florida had no one else to step in to ﬁ  ll 
Wilbekin’s role. The Gators’ backup point guard was their starting shooting guard.
  That won’t be the case come October. 
Highly touted recruit Kasey Hill will be in Gainesville soon. The ﬁ  ve-star prospect has more talent than Wilbekin could ever dream of.
  Wilbekin had a solid season as a starter, 
and he had some good games, but he just can’t match Hill’s potential. I think when push comes to shove, Donovan will start the talented and inexperienced Hill over the scrappy but troubled Wilbekin.
  That’s not all Wilbekin’s fault – he just 
isn’t as good as Hill. He’s the Yeezus to Hill’s Late Registration.
    Landon: Adam, wait until Wilbekin gets 
his money right.   Money meaning maturity, of course.    We witnessed Wilbekin’s potential last 
year, and you’re not giving him enough cred-it. Although he was a little trigger-happy at times, he improved drastically as a scorer and became UF’s best on-ball defender. Wilbekin helped hold future NBA players Kentavious Caldwell-Pope, Phil Pressey and Michael Sn-aer to paltry offensive showings.
  His commitment to the defensive end of 
the ﬂ  oor is one of the main reasons why Flor-ida ﬁ  nished the season with the third-best adjusted defensive efﬁ  ciency rating in the country, according to KenPom.com.
  The 6-foot Hill is good in his own right 
as a defender, but not as stout as the 6-foot-2 Wilbekin. While Hill probably has a brighter future professionally, he’s got plenty to learn about college basketball before he earns the “Late Registration” label. 
  Kanye West’s album set the standard in 
2005. Right now, Hill is just a really good EP. 
    Adam: Chicks dig the long ball, Landon, 
not defense. And while Wilbekin is good in a limited role, he’s never going to be an of-fensive threat.
  He may drain an occasional three, but 
those shots are the exception, not the norm.
  Even Donovan admits it.  “Scottie Wilbekin can create a shot, but it’s 
never gonna be a good one,” he said during the season. 
  While Wilbekin led the team in assists and 
steals, Hill can likely do the same. He’s one of the most hyped point guards in the nation – Rivals.com ranks him as the second-best point guard in the country. And he can prob-ably do it without making Billy Donovan pull out his hair.
  Hill has the talent to seize the starting role, 
and by getting himself suspended again, Wil-bekin just handed him the opportunity he needs.
    Landon: This is not football where one 
quarterback leads the offense. Hill and Wil-bekin can coexist in a starting backcourt. 
  They’d actually compliment each other 
very well. Wilbekin would provide the de-fense and experience, and Hill would bring the ﬂ  ashy passes and explosive scoring abil-ity. Wilbekin is big enough to be a combo guard.
  Rutgers transfer Eli Carter’s waiver re-
quest to play in 2013-14 is still pending, and he’s more of a natural shooting guard, any-way. He’ll mostly likely be cleared, but he wouldn’t be the answer as a backup point guard. 
  Donovan needs Wilbekin to provide that 
stability and experience at the point next sea-son. After a likely 5-10 game suspension, the senior point guard should work his way into the rotation and eventually snag back a start-ing role. I’d be surprised if that doesn’t hap-pen that way. 
  By December, it’ll be like nothing ever 
happened. Think Erik Murphy back in 2011.

  After two days at the Merion 
Golf Club in Ardmore, Pa., former 
Gators golfer Billy Horschel was tied for the lead in golf’s second major of the year. 
  It was only Horschel’s second 
start in a U.S. Open and the second start in a major in his entire PGA career. 
Horschel has had a successful 
2013 so far, including a victory at the Zurich Open earlier this year. 
F  or at least a round, he was the 
best golfer in the ﬁ  eld at Merion. 
  After a back-nine performance 
in the ﬁ  rst round that included three bogeys, Horschel rebounded with a virtuoso navigation of a course set up to test even the most skilled golfer. 
  Despite the adversity of the 
course, he hit all 18 greens in reg-ulation Friday afternoon – a feat that hadn’t been accomplished at a U.S. Open since 1992. He did so en route to four birdies, third most in any single round during the en-tire tournament. Horschel capped his round off with a birdie on hole No. 18, which was birdied only 11 times the entire tournament and zero times on Saturday or Sunday. 
  Horschel is also the PGA tour 
leader in birdies with 265 this sea-son.
  His second round score of 67 
(-3) tied a tournament low for a single round throughout the week-end. It was good enough to vault him into a tie for the lead after Fri-day’s play.
  “I was not in the zone, trust 
me,” Horschel said to Bob Harig of ESPN.com after his second round. “The golf course, even though it’s soft, is still a tough golf course. 
I know what in the zone is for 
me. I don’t get nervous. I just see the shot and go. And I saw the shot and went with it, but I was still nervous with a lot of them. Your misses here can be bad if you miss in the wrong spots.”
  Horschel didn’t repeat his 
second-round performance over the weekend. Three bogeys on the front nine during his third round forced him to a 72 (+2) and tied him for ﬁ  fth heading into the ﬁ  nal round. 
  Wearing an attention-grabbing 
pair of navy blue pants adorned with white octopi, Horschel was not up to the challenge. Although he entered the day only two shots back of the lead, he struggled dur-ing his ﬁ  nal round. 
  Four of his six Sunday bogeys 
came on the front nine, effectively knocking him out of contention for the championship midway through his round. 
  He ended up ﬁ  nishing tied for 
fourth, and took home $291,406 for his efforts this weekend. Horschel also earned an exemption for next year’s Masters and U.S. Open. 20, ALLIGATOR � TUESDAY, JUNE 18, 2013

  Former Florida catcher Mike Zunino 
played high school baseball at Cape 
Coral Mariner High. Now he’s making an impression with the Seattle Mari-ners.
  Since the Mariners called him up on 
June 11, the rookie catcher has started  four games with solid results.
  Zunino made his major-league debut 
in the Mariners’ 6-1 loss to the Houston Astros on Wednesday, notching a line-drive single to center ﬁ  eld for his ﬁ  rst hit in the big leagues.
  “It was a great 
experience,” Zu-nino said after his ﬁ  rst game. “I 
had a blast. Looking forward to making more strides with this team.”
    But in his second game, Zunino an-
nounced his presence with a little more force – launching an 80 mph changeup from Athletics pitcher Tom Milone over the center-ﬁ  eld wall for the go-ahead run against Oakland.
  Zunino singled to right in his third 
career game on Sunday and was  0 for 2 at the plate against Angels pitcher Jason Vargas as of press time on Monday.
