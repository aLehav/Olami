“MASK OFF”
Laura San Juan // Alligator Staff
More than 100 people gathered on the corner of West University Avenue and Northwest 17th Street after several businesses in Midtown reopened on Saturday. 
Wait staff were required to wear face masks—customers were not. Pita Pit, Relish and Midtown Pizza served food for patrons while Fat Daddy’s, JJ’s T avern and The 
Rowdy Reptile provided an outdoor bar.
THE TEST STILL NEEDS 
TO BE SAMPLED AND 
APPROVED BY THE FDA
By Ariana Aspuru
Alligator Staff Writer 
The solution to COVID-19 testing 
shortages and long lines outside test-
ing facilities can now be found in a 
strip of paper, according to two UF 
researchers. 
Piyush Jain, a UF chemical engi-
neering professor, and Long Nguyen, 
a 28-year-old UF chemical engineering 
graduate student, say they have devel-
oped a COVID-19 test that can be ad-
ministered at home. Using saliva and 
a paper strip, the test tells users if they 
are infected with the virus in about an 
hour, Jain said. 
The pair hopes to make it available before the end of the summer and are 
currently talking to manufacturers, 
Jain said. He said they aim to make 
it accessible worldwide and cost $1 to 
$2. 
Jain and his graduate assistant, 
Nguyen, originally began creating the 
testing system to detect genetic dis-
eases like HIV, prostate cancer and 
hepatitis C, Jain said. They started 
eight months before the World Health 
Organization declared COVID-19 a 
public health emergency of interna-
tional concern. 
On March 17, Jain received a text 
message from Nguyen around 8 p.m. 
with the simple phrase, “It worked.” 
The text, along with a photo of a 
positive-result paper strip, meant that 
their COVID-19 test was successful. 
“That night, when it was going the 
way I expected it to, I was jumping 
because I found something,” Nguyen said. 
After they obtain patient samples 
of saliva, the researchers can begin 
testing them and apply for approval 
from the U.S. Food and Drug Admin-
istration. Approval usually takes six 
months when under a priority review, 
but the administration has started ex-
pediting COVID-19 tests, according to 
its website.
The two said they are motivated to 
keep the cost for the product as low as 
possible while maintaining the accu-
racy and accessibility of the test.
“I’m feeling empowered in being 
able to give back to the community, 
which is something I have been want-
ing to do,” Nguyen said.
The test takes about 45 minutes to 
an hour to deliver results and is simple 
enough for anyone to use, Jain said.

The fear she feels now is 
new. She works every day be-

‘COVID toes,’ other rashes latest 
possible rare virus signs
“COVID toes” are among some 
of the newest symptoms of 
COVID-19. Boston dermatologist 
Esther Freeman said she 
expected to see skin complaints 
as a result of the virus, but she 
didn’t think they would show up 
on toes. The symptoms of COVID 
toes include itchy swellings 
that are red and can be sore. 
Doctors say there is no need 
to go to the emergency room if 
you have COVID toes and that 
telemedicine is the first step to 
diagnosing the side effect. In one 
study of 88 COVID-19 patients in 
Italy, 1 in 5 had some sort of red 
rash on their bodies. 
In Detroit, NYC, kindness comes 
one slice at a time
Shalinder Singh used to spend 
his Sundays passing out food at 
his gurdwara, a place of worship 
for Sikhs. Once the pandemic 
began and his gurdwara closed, 
Singh decided to give back to 
first responders by delivering 
pizzas to hospitals, firefighters 
and police stations in Detroit. 
In New York, Japreet Singh 
has delivered more than 1,000 
pizzas since he began delivering 
to first responders and minimum 
wage workers in March. Japreet 
has been paying for the pizzas 
with his own money, but he 
has been using social media 
to raise funds. He has raised 
$2,000 and has begun working 
with the owner of two Papa 
John’s restaurants in Queens 
and Brooklyn. 
Tropical storm Arthur forms, 1st 
named storm of the season
Tropical storm Arthur formed 
off the coast of Florida Saturday. 
With the formation of Arthur, 
this marks the sixth year in a row 
for a storm to form before the 
official start of hurricane season, 
which begins on June 1. The 
U.S. National Hurricane Center 
in Miami issued a tropical storm 
warning for North Carolina’s 
Outer Banks in its 5 a.m. Sunday 
advisory. Forecasters predict that the storm will stay far off 
the coast of Florida, Georgia 
and South Carolina on Sunday. 
On Sunday night and Monday, 
the storm is expected to bring 
1-3 inches of rain to the coast 
of North Carolina. In Florida, 
residents can expect dangerous 
coastal surf conditions, and rip 
currents are expected to spread 
northward to the mid-atlantic. 
Puerto Rico to hold statehood 
referendums amid delusion 
Puerto Rican Gov. Wanda 
Vázquez Garced announced 
Saturday that she will host 
a nonbinding referendum in 
November to decide whether 
Puerto Rico should remain as a 
territory of the U.S. or become 
part of the U.S. Puerto Rico 
becoming a state would have 
to be approved by the U.S. 
Congress, but it comes with 
opposition from the island’s 
independence supporters. The 
pro-statehood party believes that 
becoming a state will help the 
island when it comes to receiving 
federal aid for natural disasters 
such as Hurricane Maria and 
the COVID-19 pandemic. Puerto 
Ricans are U.S. citizens but 
cannot vote in U.S. presidential 
elections. And while the island 
is exempt from the U.S. federal 
income tax, it still pays Social 
Security, Medicare and local 
taxes and receives less federal 
funding than U.S. states.
US military’s mystery space 
plane rockets back into orbit
The U.S. military’s mystery 
space plane launched into orbit 
Sunday in Cape Canaveral, 
FL carrying an extra load of 
science experiments. This is the 
sixth flight of an X-37B, a solar-
powered plane that’s flown by 
remote control without a crew. 
Officials haven’t said what the 
purpose of the mission is or how 
long the rocket will be in orbit. 
Since the first flight in 2010, 
the space plane has spent 2,865 
days in orbit. The space plane, 
which is the second launch 
for the new Space Force, was 
delayed by one day due to bad 
weather. Sunday’s launch was dedicated to health care workers 
and people working on the 
frontlines. 
Pence to visit Orlando nursing 
home, also talk tourism
U.S. Vice President Mike Pence 
will be visiting an Orlando 
nursing home on Wednesday, 
where he will be delivering 
personal protective equipment. 
This is part of his initiative 
to deliver PPE to more than 
15,000 nursing homes across the 
U.S. After visiting the nursing 
home, Pence is scheduled to 
participate in a discussion with 
leaders in the hospitality and  
tourism industry. Tourism is 
Florida’s No. 1 industry, and it 
has crashed due to COVID-19 
concerns. Dana Young, head 
of Visit Florida, said that hotels 
saw a drop in revenue of $1.6 
billion during a six-week period 
in March and April of this year 
compared to last year. 
Florida health care system: 35K 
virus tests ‘unreliable’
The results of more than 35,000 
COVID-19 tests ordered by a 
Florida-based health care system 
and performed by a third-party 
lab are unreliable, according to 
AdventHealth. AdventHealth 
is a faith-based health care 
system. AdventHealth said 
that the situation has created 
“unacceptable delays.” The 
health care company did not 
name the third-party company 
that performed the tests. The 
company plans to notify anyone 
who took a COVID-19 test with a 
letter and a phone call. The tests 
were a mixture of positive and 
negative results, and some of the 
results have not been returned 
yet. 
Gyms, museums, libraries set to 
open in Florida
Republican Florida Gov. Ron 
DeSantis said Friday that people 
who are healthier are less likely 
to die from the coronavirus, 
which is part of his rationale 
to reopen gyms in Florida on 
Monday. Starting Monday, 
restaurants will be allowed to 
have 50 percent capacity, up 
from the original 25 percent that 
Gov. DeSantis originally set. 
Gyms, libraries and museums 
will be allowed to operate at 
50 percent capacity, but movie 
theaters and bars will remain 
closed. DeSantis said he thinks 
gyms can be run without 
extreme risk of spreading the 
virus if the equipment is spaced 
properly and then sanitized after 
each use. Florida has had more 
than 43,000 confirmed cases of 
COVID-19.VOLUME 114 ISSUE 78

Gainesville’s wedding in-
dustry began the year prepar-
ing for “Wedding Christmas,” 
a period of heightened busi-
ness from late December to 
late May. Instead, the season 
ushered in cancellation after 
cancellation as COVID-19 
spread.
Alisha Alsbrook, the own-
er of The Wedding Cycle, a 
local bridal shop, said she 
felt the changes in February. 
Shipments of wedding 
dresses started to take longer 
to arrive–nearly four weeks 
longer. Requests for wedding 
planning and ofﬁ  ciating de-
creased by 70 percent, and 
nearly 80 percent of sched-
uled events were canceled.
Alsbrook closed the shop 
for three weeks in March 
to disinfect it, but business 
still hasn’t returned to nor-
mal. The store is only open 
to groups no larger than ﬁ  ve 
who made online appoint-
ments ahead of time. Employ-
ees wear masks and gloves, 
and customers are asked to 
do the same, she said. 
All of the dresses are cov-
ered in plastic. Only stylists 
and brides can look through 
the gowns. 
Alsbrook said she has 
tried to see the light despite 
the chaos. As a registered 
minister, she’s performed 
two backyard wedding cer-
emonies over the past seven 
weeks. The ceremonies were 
limited to 10 people, but com-
puters were set up to share 
the couple’s special moment 
through Zoom. 
Her advice for couples during the pandemic: Focus 
on why you’re getting mar-
ried. 
“You can always have a 
party, you can always renew 
your vows, you can always 
get together and go on a va-
cation,” Alsbrook said. “But 
being with the one person 
that you love uncondition-
ally will always be the reason 
why you’re getting married.”
Keith Watson has owned 
Keith Watson Events, a local 
event and wedding planning 
service, for 18 years. He said 
the pandemic has had drastic 
effects on his business. 
The business had six wed-
dings rescheduled for fall and 
winter, three downsized to 
social-distancing-style cer-
emonies and one canceled 
entirely.  
However, Watson contin-
ues to offer his expertise. 
On April 30, the Alachua 
County Clerk of Court’s of-
ﬁ  ce offered a special drive-
thru deal: $30 weddings for 
couples whose plans were 
disrupted by COVID-19.
Watson and his team 
heard about the event that 
morning and immediately 
gathered to help. The staff 
gathered at noon and made 
35 ﬂ  ower arrangements to be 
donated, Watson said. 
Inspired by the event, he 
started his own version: the 
drive-in wedding. In a May 
6 Facebook post, Keith Wat-
son Events announced a cer-
emony package that allows 
a maximum of 20 guests to 
watch the couple tie the knot 
from their cars.  
“We have a loading dock, 
so I thought we could deco-
rate it like a wedding venue,” Watson said. “We could have 
20 cars of friends and family 
drive up to watch the wed-
ding for an hour or so, take 
photographs and be socially 
distanced and safe.”
Couples can choose from 
four theme packages: classic, 
1970s, country or Vegas. 
“The fun thing is that it of-
fers to all ages,” he said. “A 
couple having their second or 
third wedding, who wants to 
relive their times in the ‘70s 
or ‘80s, can have a disco ball 
turning and Elton John. If a 
couple loves Vegas, Elvis can 
ofﬁ  ciate your wedding.” 
While Watson’s business 
has struggled because of the 
virus, he believes the drive-
in wedding will have book-
ings soon.
Christine Plumley, a 
Gainesville resident and own-
er of CWP Photography, said 
her business has also strug-
gled since March due to can-
cellations and rescheduling.
Nevertheless, one couple 
that was unable to reschedule 
opted for a drive-in wedding 
at Clark Plantation in June. 
Clark Plantation, located 
in Newberry, has been re-
building since a ﬁ  re damaged 
the location’s main building 
in February, Plumley said. 
However, the venue is ex-
pected to be ready for drive-
in ceremonies this summer.
“As long as you’re mar-
rying the right person, how 
you’re marrying them, how 
big the crowd is, where it is 
and what time of year should 
not matter,” Plumley said.

alotz@alligator.org Inside a changing industry: weddings 
With the beginning 
of Summer A & C 
last week, let us 
be reminded of 
the opportunity 
that the Summer season 
presents. Summer is a 
time for us to not only get 
ahead of our academics but 
to also make advances on 
our personal and long-term 
goals. Summer provides us with more 
time to dedicate to our hobbies and 
to restore our work-life balance. So, 
take advantage of this time. Yes we 
ﬁ  nd ourselves in an unprecedented 
moment, but today is the time to 
capitalize on tomorrow.
My administration has done just 
that. On Tuesday, the UF Student 
Government Senate passed a rent 
relief bill that will allocate $500,000 
to students who might be struggling 
with rent payments as a result of 
COVID-19. My team and I will be 
releasing an application for these 
funds on Wednesday, May 20. Keep 
an eye on the UF Student Government 
website and Facebook page for updates 
regarding the rent relief application.
It’s important to note that the rent 
relief bill is just one of the many 
ﬁ  nancial resources available to students 
during this unprecedented time. There 
are many ﬁ  nancial aid applications out 
there, and it may be confusing. Here’s 
the deal for each one:
Aid-a-Gator : Aid-a-Gator is 
intended to grant funds to students in 
need of ﬁ  nancial help for costs related 
to unanticipated travel, additional 
technology requirements or other needs 
related to an emergency situation. The 
maximum grant for Aid-a-Gator is 
$1,000. The best part is, all UF students 
are eligible to receive these funds.
CARES Act : UF has received funds 
from the CARES Act, which will then 
be allocated directly to UF students 
to help cover unanticipated expenses. 
There are some notable guidelines to 
receive these funds, so make sure to 
check out the Student Financial Affairs 
website for more information regarding 
eligibility. Students who do not qualify 
for CARES are still able to apply for Aid-
a-Gator and SG’s Rent Relief program.
GNVCares : The City of Gainesville received $3.2 million in federal aid 
intended to help our community. 
Applications are available for small 
businesses and individuals 
experiencing a disruption 
in their income due to 
COVID-19.
In the month of May, 
SG has also provided a 
sponsorship to the Hitchcock 
Field & Fork Pantry in order 
to help stock its shelves 
and accommodate rising 
food insecurity. Because SG 
sadly could not host spring 
programming events, we felt there 
was no better way to allocate our food 
budget than to give it right back to 
students. This sponsorship is intended 
to help purchase the essentials, such 
as food, toilet paper, nonperishables, 
baby items and menstrual products. 
Regardless of your ﬁ  nancial situation, 
you should stop by the pantry. It is an 
amazing resource led by some very 
talented Gators.
Typically, Summer is a time where 
our new Executive Branch would 
be hosting summer programming 
events for students to engage with 
campus life. While circumstances may 
have changed, our efforts to provide 
meaningful events have not. For the 
duration of Summer A, every Thursday 
at 8 p.m. you will have the opportunity 
to participate in our Virtual Game 
Show Series: Trivia Nights. Each game 
will give out $300 in prizes to about 
20 students. Later in the semester, we 
will be kicking off the start of #UF24’s 
Preview Days and bringing a night 
dedicated entirely to UF-themed trivia. 
Start brushing up, Gators! Here’s the 
link to attend: bit.ly/ufgameshow.
 Along with this, Accent Speakers 
Bureau will be consistently hosting 
virtual programming events throughout 
the Summer.  Be on the lookout for 
frequent sign-ups for the opportunity 
to listen to unique guest speakers.
 To wrap things up, one of the 
best parts of being a Gator is the 
unparalleled feeling of being part of 
something greater. In times where 
the only constant is uncertainty, we 
have proven over and over that our 
Gator pride is the driving force behind 
our everlasting resilience. From one 
student to another: be safe, have fun 
and go Gators!Hey, Gators!From the Student Body president

NIVA was formed in March in response to COVID-19-
related business shutdowns to support independent music 
and entertainment venues.
WITHOUT FEDERAL HELP , 
SMALL VENUES ATTEMPT 
TO NAVIGATE THE FUTURE
By Chloe Greenberg
Alligator Staff Writer
The National Independent Venue 
Association has joined forces with 
music venues and supporters to 
give a voice to the industry at a fed-
eral level—three of these venues call 
Gainesville home.
Gainesville’s The Florida The-
ater, High Dive and The Fest punk 
festival have joined NIVA along with 
1,600 other venues nationwide. The 
venues are aiming to achieve rec-
ognition from legislators and secure 
federal ﬁ  nancial assistance for them-
selves and businesses like them, 
which many believe is essential to 
their survival.
NIVA was formed in March in 
response to COVID-19-related busi-
ness shutdowns to support inde-
pendent music and entertainment 
venues. Venue owners from across 
the country began meeting and com-
municating virtually, seeking a more 
powerful voice in the federal legisla-
tive process, leading to NIVA.One of the venues included in 
these talks was High Dive, facility 
and events manager Pat Lavery said. 
As High Dive navigates this uncer-
tain time, Lavery said it’s incredible 
to see people coming together to 
save the industry and to save music. 
“It’s a delicate ecosystem and 
industry,” Lavery said. “We’re all 
linked and we all rely on each other. 
And so the health of one venue af-
fects the health of another venue. 
The health of an artist affects the 
venues. It goes on and on.”
NIVA’s most immediate goal is 
lobbying Congress for the inclusion 
of independent venues in the CARES 
Act and a review of the Paycheck 
Protection Program to include ven-
ues, NIVA Vice President Stephen 
Chilton wrote in an email.
“The original stimulus in April 
did not work for venues at all even 
though we have been the hardest 
hit businesses,” Chilton wrote. “No 
venue will survive if we don’t get big 
federal help. 90% of our members 
said they could not last 6 months 
without aid.”
To help, Chilton said individu-
als can visit the NIVA website or 
the #SaveOurStages site. Supporters 
can send a prewritten letter to their state senators and representatives—
it takes about 30 seconds. 
Much of the ﬁ  ght for federal as-
sistance for these independent estab-
lishments rests in the argument of 
their pivotal role in a community and 
its economy. NIVA approximates 
that for every dollar a music venue 
makes in ticket sales, up to $12 can 
be made by surrounding businesses, 
Chilton wrote.
“Right now we are just hoping 
for survival,” Chilton wrote. “We 
need large support right now or no 
independent venues will survive 
this. None of us will survive without 
aid. Not even the largest and best 
known.”
Chilton hopes to see NIVA contin-
ue to grow and effect change for the 
businesses and industry it’s ﬁ  ghting 
for now. However, he can only see it 
doing so with help from the public in 
gaining Congress’s recognition.
“Ours is a truly grassroots move-
ment,” Chilton wrote. “We are tell-
ing D.C. how important we are to 
people and we need everyone to tell 
D.C. how true that is.”

A GLIMPSE INTO HOW 
MEMES KEEP GATORS 
CONNECTED TO WI-FI AND 
EACH OTHER
Lonnie Numa
Avenue Staff Writer
For many Gators, sharing a laugh 
over a meme about Zoom lectures 
is one of the few methods they can 
use to still feel connected to fellow 
students. This sense of community is 
thanks to the efforts of those behind 
popular UF-centric social platforms 
embodying the spirit of life on-cam-
pus from home. 
The Black Sheep UF, a multi-plat-
form social media account run by a 
team of seven students, entertains 
more than 15,000 followers on Insta-
gram and 10,000 on Twitter. Content 
for its accounts is mainly inspired 
by niche experiences at UF—such 
as receiving an alert from University 
Police that the local Bojangles’ has 
been robbed at 2 a.m. or coming to 
the realization that no one uses the 
revolving door at Library West to 
save energy. 
Ryan Novak, a 21-year-old UF telecommunication junior, has de-
vised a method for maintaining the 
madness that is The Black Sheep 
UF’s Twitter account. But producing 
daily content as a social media con-
tributor throughout quarantine has 
been challenging.
“The issue is creating content that 
still stays fresh,” Novak said. “You 
can only make so many Zoom-re-
lated memes before you’re just like, 
‘Am I really about to do this again?’”
Though the fear of redundancy 
has kept its social media contributors 
on their toes, The Black Sheep UF 
has seen more audience engagement 
than average during the pandemic. 
Fellow social media contributor, Jen-
na Barry, a 20-year-old UF advertis-
ing senior, attributes this to the team 
expanding the range of its content as 
its audience has grown. 
“It seems like since everyone is in 
the same boat, a lot of our content 
has been more broad,” Barry said. 
“More people are on social media, 
and everyone is kind of bummed 
right now, so I feel like a lot of people 
look for comedy.”
With so much shared frustration 
surrounding the pandemic, there’s been a revelation in how a lot of 
comedy comes from shared pain, 
said Novak. And somehow, express-
ing mundane desires such as hoping 
UF will eventually dump Pepsi for 
Coca-Cola has kept students con-
nected. 
“I like to think that people, maybe 
even if they aren’t actually communi-
cating it, they kind of feel like they’re 
still part of UF, no matter where 
they’re at,” Novak said.
There’s more than one online 
community that aims to bring lev-
ity to the UF community during the 
COVID-19  pandemic. Swampy UF 
memes for top ten public teens, a 
Facebook group created by UF alum-
na Rebecca Ragan in March 2017 has 
accumulated more than 46,000 mem-
bers. Over the years, the group has 
become notorious for its members’ 
abilities to photoshop Florida Gators 
baseball caps onto any photo. 
Brandon McKay, a 20-year-old 
UF biology sophomore, has always 
loved the community as a whole and 
said he was inspired to become one 
of three moderators working along-
side 12 administrators in the group.
As a moderator, McKay said he typically spends about an hour a day 
on the page because activity within 
the group has remained consistent 
throughout quarantine. Maintaining 
a lighthearted atmosphere within 
the community is a task distributed 
evenly among the staff of modera-
tors and administrators, who evalu-
ate submissions and approve them 
based on inclusivity, relevancy and 
quality. 
At the start of the pandemic, the 
Swampy memes staff made an an-
nouncement that they would not ap-
prove any memes centered around 
people who had contracted the virus, 
McKay said. 
“That’s what the moderators are 
all about,” McKay said. “Making the 
Swampy memes page a good com-
munity for people at UF.
Although the pandemic has 
stretched the UF community far and 
wide, the Swampy memes page and 
other platforms like it have sent out a 
uniﬁ  ed message that anyone having 
trouble coping with the times is not 
alone. UF has over 50,000 students, 
many of whom will never meet or 
share a class, but still connect with 
each other through liking the same 
meme, McKay said.
“I think that’s what the meme 
page does especially well in times 
like this,” McKay said. “A lot of us, we all come from different back-
grounds, different places, some of us 
different states and different coun-
tries, but we’re all experiencing a lot 
of the same things.”

THE VICTIM ESCAPED 
BUT HEARD HER PUPPY 
“SCREAMING” INSIDE 
Sarah Mandile
Alligator Staff Writer
The Alachua County Sheriff’s 
Ofﬁ  ce arrested a woman accused 
of burning down a woodshed with 
a woman and her dog inside May 
9.
Robin Hamilton, 57, of 14134 
SE 174th Place in Hawthorne, was 
charged with attempted murder, 
arson and animal abuse. 
The Cross Creek Fire Depart-
ment responded to a ﬁ  re at 14125 SE 174th Place in Hawthorne 
around 3:30 p.m. According to an 
ACSO report, the building on ﬁ  re 
was a woodshed Hamilton had 
been renting to the victim for the 
last six months.
A few minutes earlier, the vic-
tim had gotten in an argument 
with Hamilton about a missing 
towel. The report said the towel 
had sentimental value to her. 
According to the report, the 
victim said Hamilton returned 
the towel. She was paying $225 
a month to stay in the shed and 
said it was a temporary arrange-
ment until she “could get back on 
her feet.” The victim told ACSO Hamil-
ton began threatening her saying, 
“You won’t have a place to stay by 
Monday” and “I’ll burn you out.”
About 20 minutes after argu-
ing, the victim was inside the 
shed with her dog and started to 
smell smoke. The report says she 
realized the shed was on ﬁ  re af-
ter turning off her air conditioning 
unit and seeing ash land on her 
skin.
She saw ﬁ  re near her dryer vent 
and tried to grab her 6-month-old 
puppy hiding under her furniture. 
She wasn’t able to reach the dog 
and opened the door. The ﬁ  re rap-
idly engulfed the shed. The victim heard her puppy 
“screaming” as the ﬁ  re intensiﬁ  ed, 
according to the report. The puppy 
died.
While the victim’s hair was 
burned, she told ACSO she felt 
parts of her face were also burned, 
the report said. She said she strug-
gled to breathe because she suffers 
from chronic obstructive pulmo-
nary disease. 
Afterward, a witness also over-
heard Hamilton saying, “That’s 
what you get” and threatening 
another neighbor by saying, “I’ll 
burn you out too,” the report said.
A video camera facing the shed 
from a home across the street re-corded the events leading up to 
the ﬁ  re. According to the report, 
Hamilton can be seen crouch-
ing down by the shed. After she 
leaves, the ﬁ  re starts.
Hamilton told ACSO she didn’t 
know how the ﬁ  re started and 
that she’d been burning bamboo 
near the shed. However, Hamilton 
eventually admitted she started 
the ﬁ  re after drinking alcohol and 
smoking cannabis that morning.
Hamilton is currently being 
held at the Alachua County Jail 
with her bond set at $80,000. 
@sarahmandile
smandile@alligator.orgWoman arrested, accused of burning woodshed with tenant, dog
system, which is a genetic engineering tool used to edit, or 
cut, selected DNA. The two were working on detecting other 
diseases before modifying it for COVID-19, as CRISPR can be 
redesigned to target any genetic disease, Jain said. 
Nguyen proposed switching their focus to COVID-19 when 
it became more prevalent in January. 
Although CRISPR has already been used to detect COV-
ID-19, Jain said their system is faster. The ﬁ  rst CRISPR-based 
test for coronavirus was approved by the FDA in early May.
The ﬁ  rst step in the researchers’ at-home test is to pour 
water that is 140 to 158 degrees Fahrenheit up to the ﬁ  ll line 
of the provided cup. Next, spit into the provided tube, seal it, 
place it in the cup and wait 30 minutes.
The tube contains chemicals that open cells in the saliva, 
including any coronavirus particles, converts them from RNA 
to DNA and then multiplies them, which makes the virus de-
tectable, Jain said. This process is similar to one that happens 
in the test currently used for COVID-19, the Centers for Dis-
ease Control’s authorized RT-PCR test, which uses a sample 
swabbed from the nasal passage. 
After waiting 30 minutes, transfer the sample into a sec-
ond tube containing the CRISPR-ENHANCE test, designed by Jain and Nguyen. Let the tube rest at room temperature for 
15 to 20 minutes and then place the provided paper strip into 
the tube. 
Within 30 seconds, the results from the exam will begin to 
appear. Similar to a pregnancy test, if two bands appear, it is 
positive. If one appears, it is negative.
Jain said he hopes to provide test takers with a way to 
photograph their results and upload them to a server, such as 
MyUFHealth or an app, so it can be analyzed by a health care 
provider to conﬁ  rm the results. 
In March, the two found the lab short-staffed because of 
restrictions to minimize the spread of COVID-19, Nguyen 
said. On Friday, they were approved to add one more person 
to their lab, allowing them to now have three people working 
in-person.
They hope to get approval for more people in the lab in the 
near future, when campus becomes more accessible. 
The sooner the test is implemented, the more people it can 
help, Jain said. People who test positive can stay home, and 
people who test negative can return to work, he said. 
“You are not only saving your life, but you are saving 
other people’s lives if you are detecting it early,” Jain said. 
@arianaluzzz
aaspuru@alligator.org TESTING,  from pg. 1It’s faster this way
without access to federal aid, it’s a risk she has to take. 
“We cannot afford to stay home,” M.J. said.
M.J. is an undocumented immigrant from Honduras. She 
came to the U.S. 18 years ago to work and send money back to 
her mother and sister. 
“As Hispanics, we came to work like crazy,” M.J. said. “We 
are the ones behind hotels and restaurants, working the long 
shifts.”
During the pandemic, M.J. lost weekly hours working at the 
hotel but said things are slowly going back to normal as the 
state lifts restrictions. However, she is still worried about being 
exposed to the virus at work.
“I’m out here, I’m getting exposed,” M.J. said. “I don’t want 
to bring it back to my son.”
M.J. is one of many with similar stories in Gainesville. Ac-
cording to the 2016 report from the U.S. Census Bureau, around 
8,650 residents in the community are non-U.S. citizens. Of those 
residents, the Human Rights Coalition of Alachua County said 
about 5,000 are undocumented.
M.J. and other undocumented workers are excluded from the 
$2 trillion federal coronavirus relief package passed on March 
25 as they need a social security number to receive a stimulus 
check. She also did not receive the $500 bonus given for depen-
dent children under 17 for her son, who is a U.S. citizen. 
“They very speciﬁ  cally excluded people related to undocu-
mented immigrants from receiving that check,” said Anastacia 
Greene, an immigration clinical fellow at UF Levin College of 
Law.
Undocumented immigrants worry about unemployment as 
they do not qualify for government beneﬁ  ts, Greene said. This 
fear has heightened amid the pandemic. 
More than ﬁ  ve nonproﬁ  t organizations in the Gainesville 
community are working to bring these immigrants aid. Mary 
Elizabeth Ibarrola, the Human Rights Coalition (HRC) of Ala-chua County director of immigration concerns, said the organi-
zation is working with the Alachua County Labor Coalition, an 
organization calling for economic justice, to speak with families 
about their employment status. Working Food, a non-proﬁ  t or-
ganization with a food relief response plan, is also partnering 
with the coalition to deliver food and make sure families are 
adequately fed. 
One of their biggest projects, Ibarrola said, is giving ﬁ  nancial 
aid to 50 families in Gainesville. 
“The stimulus relief situation is a big frustration, and we 
would ideally like for every undocumented person to receive 
those same kinds of funds that citizens and residents are receiv-
ing,” Ibarrola said.
The HRC has raised more than $20,000 in private donations 
through its website and Paypal. The coalition also submitted a 
$30,000 proposal to the City of Gainesville government. 
Lee Feldman, the Gainesville City Manager, said he is work-
ing with local nonproﬁ  ts to try to meet the needs of undocu-
mented immigrants in the community. Federal and state restric-
tions do not allow the local government to give direct aid, he 
said.
The amount the coalition will receive has not yet been ﬁ  -
nalized, said Feldman. Once decided, the money will be taken 
from Gainesville City general funds and go to the Community 
Foundation of North Central Florida, which will then distribute 
the money to the HRC. 
With this money, Ibarrola plans to give each family a $1,000 
check and said she hopes to begin distributing the money to 
families as soon as possible. However, she is worried the pan-
demic will have lasting effects on undocumented families.
“Even when the restrictions are lifted, we’re going to see that 
the industries where most undocumented people work have al-
ready been irreparably disrupted,” Ibarrola said.
Restaurants in Gainesville, like Felipe’s Mexican Taqueria, 
have lost revenue due to the pandemic. With indoor seating lim-
ited to 25 percent capacity, Ibarrola said people will still face 
unemployment and lower working hours. 
The HRC and Feldman said they will continue collaborating 
with organizations in Gainesville to support these families. M.J. said she is not alone in Gainesville. 
“Thank God there is a lot of support here,” M.J. said.

GYMNASTICS
By River Wells
Sports Writer
Perfection.
Often sought and rarely 
achieved, perfection and the pur-
suit of it is the ultimate goal for any 
sports team that competes at a rate 
where it’s possible. And sitting at 10-0 after a March 7 meet against 
the Penn State Nittany Lions, the 
Gators gymnastics team was well 
on its way before the season was 
canceled due to the coronavirus 
pandemic before the close of the 
regular season.
But what if it wasn’t?
Could the Gators have truly reached the ultimate achievement? 
Could they have marched through 
SECs, blasted through NCAA Re-
gionals and semis and emerge as 
the nation’s best squad in the ﬁ  -
nals?
The answer lies in some of the 
strongest young talent the Gators 
have had in years—and a certain 
sophomore from York, Pennsylva-
nia.
UF was led by head coach Jenny 
Rowland, who, after the season 
had been canceled, netted both 
the SEC and WCGA Coach of the 
Year awards. Rowland’s recruit-
ing and coaching efforts had hit 
peak production in 2020, as junior 
Alyssa Baumann was named to the 
WCGA ﬁ  rst-team All-American for 
the ﬂ  oor and second-team for the 
beam while senior Rachel Gowey 
and sophomore Savannah Schoen-
herr were named ﬁ  rst-team on the 
beam and second-team on the un-
even bars, respectively.
And then there was Trinity 
Thomas.
To call Thomas dominant is an 
understatement. She was named 
a ﬁ  rst-team All-American in every 
event except for the vault, where 
she made second-team. She was 
the SEC Gymnast of the Year, won 28 events across the season, set the 
nation’s highest all-around score 
against Georgia (39.825), earned 
four 10s on the year, won SEC 
Gymnast of the Week eight times 
and was a ﬁ  nalist for the Honda 
Award, given to the nation’s best 
collegiate gymnast.
With Rowland at the helm and 
Thomas on cruise control, Florida 
would almost certainly defeat its 
ﬁ  nal regular-season opponent in 
unranked 6-10 Texas Woman’s 
University.
After that, the Gators would 
head to the SEC Championship. 
The closest any SEC team got to 
beating the Gators was both Ala-
bama and LSU at 0.6 points behind 
Florida in its respective matches. 
While it isn’t entirely out of the 
question that one of the two could 
beat them, both teams lost at least 
two matches across their regular 
seasons, and it would be more 
likely than not that UF’s hot streak 
would continue.
With their likely SEC victory out 
of the way, the Gators would per-
haps learn from their mistakes after 
not making the ﬁ  nals last season 
and overcome the divisional and 
semiﬁ  nal rounds of NCAAs. Once 
it got to the ﬁ  nals, it would almost certainly come face to face with its 
longtime rival.
The top-ranked Oklahoma Soon-
ers were also undefeated at the 
end of 2020, and they had a better 
meet-high and average score than 
Florida did. OU had its own Trinity 
Thomas in senior Maggie Nichols, 
another Honda Award Finalist who 
netted Big 12 Gymnast of the Year 
and ranked No. 1 in all-around at 
the season’s end.
UF had already beat a poten-
tial ﬁ  nalist in Denver earlier in the 
year, but could it beat Oklahoma?
It would be more likely than not 
that the Sooners would topple the 
mighty Gators. UF has beaten them 
before, though, but if Rowland and 
her squad managed to steal a vic-
tory in Fort Worth, Texas, Florida 
would complete what would have 
been its best season in program his-
tory. If not, it would still be Row-
land’s best effort as head coach and 
continue the reign of terror that the 
two programs have held over the 
women’s gymnastics world.
Perfection is far from easy. But 
for the Florida Gators, it was far 
from a pipe dream.
