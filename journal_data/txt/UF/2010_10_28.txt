of one month instead of two. Chris Voigt told the Tri-City Herald that — as good and healthy as potatoes are — there’s only so many ways they can be prepared. And, about halfway through his tuber diet, he’s had them boiled, baked, steamed, grilled, fried, marinated and mashed.
The Moses Lake man is executive director of the Washington

In its efforts toward sustainability, 
UF gets a B+.
The Sustainable Endowments Insti-
tute has issued its college sustainability 
report card for 2010, and UF has moved 
up from last year’s B grade.
The Cambridge, Mass.-based non-
profit organization released its report Tuesday. 
The institute works to promote sus-
tainability in campus operations and endowment practices.
UF’s overall grade reflects individual 
grades in areas such as student involve-
ment, transportation and green build-
ing — all of which received A’s.
According to Rob Foley, a senior 
research fellow 
at the institute, 
qualities like in-stituting a bike-
sharing program and requiring all-new construction projects to meet Leader -
ship in Energy and Environment De-sign Gold criteria helped garner a high grade.
“The university having A’s is just a 
really great achievement and accom-plishment,” he said. 
“It’s not something most universities 
can do.”
UF spokeswoman Janine Sikes said 
the grade is an indication of the univer -
sity’s increased focus on using limited resources wisely.
The only failing grade for the uni-
versity was in the area of endowment transparency.

nonprofit group responsible for manag-

Picketers gathered on the courthouse steps Wednes-
day to publicly voice their opinions on a proposed air -
boat curfew. 
The fate of late-night airboaters rests in the hands 
of Alachua County voters, who will vote on Initiative 
Ordinance 1 on this year’s election ballot. The proposed ordinance would set a 7 p.m. to 7 a.m. curfew for air -
boats. 
Supporters of the proposed curfew said they are con-
cerned about how much noise the airboats make, which they claimed disturbs residents and local wildlife.

Strawberry research at UF just 
got a whole lot sweeter.
The USDA National Institute of 
Food and Agriculture awarded a 
four-year, $2.9 million grant to the strawberry research team at the Gulf Coast Research and Educa-
tion Center, located at the UF Balm 
campus in Wimauma.  The grant was announced Monday.
The grant will help the multi-
state research team, led by UF plant pathologist Natalia Peres, find better ways to fight fruit rot that plagues the strawberries in Florida fields and refrigerators ev-
ery year.
Mark McLellan, dean for re-
search with UF’s Institute of Food 
and Agricultural Sciences, said Peres and her team have devel-oped a new system to predict dis-ease threats that will “extend the 
impact and nature of guidance for 
strawberry growers in Florida.”
With the exception of Califor -
nia, Florida produces more straw-
berries than any other state and is the only state that 
can grow them during the win-
ter.  
According to 
Peres, her system 
is Internet-based 
and uses a network of weather sta-tions across the state. 
If the conditions at any of the 
stations are favorable for disease, alerts are transmitted to growers 
via e-mail and text messages along 
with treatment information.IFAS gets $3 million 
to study strawberries� A UF STUDY SUGGESTS THE 
ECONOMY MAY BE IMPROVING.
By MEREDITH RUTLAND
Alligator Contributing Writer
The economy may be improving, accord-
ing to a new UF study. 
Consumer confidence, which is measured 
by the price consumers are willing to pay for 
household items and services, went up six 
points in October, according to Chris McCarty, 
director of the UF Survey Research Center.
The greatest increase in consumer confi-
dence came from senior citizens. 
He said this is strange because he expected 
the recent announcement of Social Security changes to decrease that number. 
He added that college students are still 
“fairly pessimistic” in terms of consumer con-
fidence.
This is mainly because it is difficult for col-
lege students to find jobs, he said.
Even though the number jumped, it proba-
bly won’t stay at its current level of 74, McCa-rty said. He said the number went up possibly 
because of the midterm elections and may go down after the elections are over.
David Denslow, UF economics profes-
sor, said that the midterm elections probably didn’t affect consumer confidence too much.
“I would imagine that after the election, 
the winners would feel a little more confident, the losers a little less,” he said.
McCarty said gas and food prices may in-
crease around the holiday season, but he said other goods may actually be a “real deal” 
since too many were made — like flat-screen 
TVs.
“I think it’s going to be a better holiday 
season than last year, but not a stellar one,” he said.
McCarty said he thinks the consumer con-
fidence rating will stabilize between 68 and 72, which is historically low but much better than the all-time low of 59, which was a result 
of stock market and housing problems in June 
of 2008. 
He said the number probably won’t in-
crease past the low 70s until unemployment is dealt with.Consumer confidence up

Three blindfolded students raced to open condoms and 
place them on plastic model penises while others guessed 
how many condoms were in a jar Wednesday. 
Sex on the Lawn takes place annually on the North 
Lawn under a large white tent. Sponsored by VOX, the stu-
dent Voices for Planned Parenthood, the event provided 
students with information regarding birth control meth-ods, STD and HIV testing, and free condoms. 
Free HIV testing took place in the Reitz Union base-
ment.
“It’s our way to disseminate knowledge about safe sex-
ual health practices in a way that’s fun and comfortable, nonjudgmental, open and safe-sex positive,” said VOX 
president Rocio Lopez.
Students got free pizza, Subway and baked goods for 
participating in a variety of activities, such as the blind-
folded condom race and a trivia game.
Kristen Waylen, director of education for 
Planned Parenthood, drove from Jacksonville 
to be the event’s “sexpert.”
“Students are mainly asking about birth control and 
HIV,” Waylen said. “There’s a lot of misinformation out 
there about sex.”
Students from the Pro-Life Alliance peacefully protested 
nearby, holding up signs that described a fetus’s develop-
ment throughout pregnancy. 
According to Patricia Aguerrevere, co-president of the 
alliance, the students were not protesting the message of the event, but rather the company sponsoring it. 
Planned Parenthood is the No. 1 provider of abortions 
and abortion services in the United States. However, those services make up only three percent of Planned Parent-
hood’s services.‘Sex on the lawn’ event offers food, free condoms, sex ed4, ALLIGATOR � THURSDAY, OCTOBER 28, 2010

Andrew Nichols has used Ouija 
boards, locked his wife in a dungeon 
and stared as a grandfather clock ro-
tated completely around by itself — all 
in the name of his career as a parapsy-chologist.
Nichols became interested in the 
paranormal when he was 12 years old, 
and his deceased older sister appeared 
to him one night in her prom dress.
“I did some research and realized 
what I had was called an apparitional experience and that other people had them, too,” he said. “I’ve been hooked ever since.”
Nichols, who has taught at Santa 
Fe College since 1995, gave a lecture titled, “Ghosts, Hauntings and More!” Wednesday at SFC. About 20 people attended. 
Helene Janssens, 28, said she is 
skeptical of the paranormal. She de-cided to attend because she thought it would get her ready for Halloween.
“I’m not even sure I believe in it,” 
she said. “I’m looking for documenta-tion and proof.”
Nichols doesn’t believe spirits can 
be filmed or photographed.
“These are experiences in the mind; 
they’re called psychic phenomenon for a reason,” he said.
Nichols holds a doctorate in clinical 
psychology, but his thesis focused on the psychological aspect of demonic possession.  
He will teach in the spring on para-
normal investigation and dream analy-sis for  $20 per student.Santa Fe gets spooky

Marilyn M. Thomas-Houston 
has spent the past 10 years study-
ing racism in Nova Scotia — but 
now all of her research is gone. 
Earlier this month, burglars 
broke into the UF anthropology professor’s home and stole more 
than $11,000 in goods, including TV 
sets, speakers, jewelery, bed sheets and two external hard drives.
The hard drives contained the 
culmination of more than 10 years 
of anthropological research, Hous-ton’s life’s work.
“I’ll try to replace the material 
things, but I can’t replace my work,” 
she said. “I’ve done over one hun-
dred hours of interviews. Some 
of those people are dead now.” 
Houston stayed at a Hilton for a 
week after the robbery. When she 
came back home, she asked her 
son to sleep in her bedroom so she could associate it with a fam-
ily member instead of the robbers 
who violated her home.
She was in Nova Scotia when 
the burglary occurred and called police when she returned from her trip on Oct. 3. 
Gainesville Police Capt. Ed Book 
said the officers who responded to 
the 911 call per -
formed a neigh-borhood canvass 
but didn’t come 
up with any 
leads. 
He said po-
lice have the se-rial numbers of 
the items and 
are waiting to see if any turn up. 
For the past 10 years, Houston trav-
eled to Nova Scotia to study the fight for equality of descendants 
of black British loyalists during the 
Revolutionary War. It’s about the struggle against racism, and Hous-
ton is distraught over the loss.
“They took my life,” she said. She bought her house with 
large windows so she could enjoy the light. 
But she keeps the blinds closed 
now, and she’s considering pur -
chasing a gun. The police told her 
it might have been someone she knows.
“It’s very painful for me,” she 
said. “I’ve always been afraid of animals and bugs, and the only 
thing I ever trusted were human 
beings.”
She can’t sleep, and when she 
does she dreams about the robbers. She wants to know why they did 
this to her.
Since the robbery, she installed 
a brand new security system, and 
even though it’s been almost a month, she still doesn’t feel safe.
“Every time I hear my ice mak-
er, I jump,” she said.

SUSTAINABILITY , from page 1Experiment samples will be brought back in Feb.
Wagner Vendrame, associate profes-
sor in the Department of Environmental 
Horticulture in Homestead is one of the main researchers on the project.
Though he could not be reached for 
comment, Vendrame explains on his website that the Jatropha curcas has been identified as a potential alterna-
tive energy crop for biofuel production and such studies may lead to significant 
discoveries related to plant biology and medicine. 
The experiments, in cooperation 
with the University of Colorado, will be 
carried out in specially designed fluid-
processing cylinders that will travel in-side an automated, suitcase-sized device used on more than 20 NASA shuttle mis-sions.
According to Green Energy News, the plant itself produces seeds, also known as Barbados nuts, that are an excellent source of biofuel. The seeds yield more than four times as much fuel per hectare as soybeans and more than ten times 
that of corn. They also have some medic-
inal qualities. The space shuttle Discov-ery will blast off Monday. Experiment samples will be on the space station until the next mission at the end of February when they come home to Earth.

Similar proposed ordinances have been defeated here
Community Plaza. Quiet Lakes is responsible for getting the 
curfew on the 2010 ballot. 
“The ordinance is a fair compromise since airboats can still 
operate while everyone else gets their 12 hours of peace and qui-et,” Halback said. “No rights are denied; no one is discriminated against. Just noise is discriminated against.”
Opponents of the ordinance said it is too discriminatory and 
will negatively impact those who make a living from their air -
boats. 
The United Sportsmen & Airboater’s Alliance led the opposi-
tion rally . 
“We’re going to fight with everything we got,” said Jerry 
Wetherington, president of the alliance.
Wetherington said the ordinance would require a sheriff’s of-ficer to enforce the curfew, which would cost taxpayers more money . 
He also said that airboaters are environmentally conscious 
and hold lake cleanups. 
However, Halback feels that the noise ordinance in place is 
ineffective because it’s unenforceable.
“The cost for the proper noise level-measuring equipment is 
not in the sheriff’s budget, and paying for it would actually cause a rise in taxes,” Halback said.
Halback added that the curfew would allow 
the operation of airboats for emergency, research 
and official government use, and that locals who make a liveli-hood from their airboats still have different ways to access the 
waterways.
The proposed curfew is the latest attempt at solving the con-
flict over airboat noise. Similar curfew ordinances have been 
proposed and defeated in Alachua County.PROTEST , from page 1

quaint city of Morristown, Vt. And according to the state, Raymond is a murderer.
A story in the Burlington Free Press describes how 
this model citizen is being shafted for a nonexistent 
crime. Police say Raymond gave her husband’s antide-
pressant medication to her 4-month-old grandson in an attempt to quiet him while she was away at a doctor’s appointment. The child eventually stopped breathing and later died. For this she is being accused of second-degree murder, on top of counts of child cruelty. 
My question is: Why?Yes, this woman’s actions most assuredly led to the 
death of her infant grandson. There’s no question this 
former nurse, whose license was twice revoked for di-
verting medication, was the one most directly respon-sible for this tragedy. This woman, however, whose medical background makes her oversight even more egregious, is a victim of a hypocritical legal system and society.
This death was an alleged accident and the result of 
a lack of respect for medical law and the intention of prescription parameters. 
So if this unintentional murder is going to be pros-
ecuted to the full extent of the law, I’m a little confused: What should abortion clinics be charged with? 
Abortion is an incredibly purposeful process when 
done in the most socially acceptable medical way. This procedure often has extensive medical or surgical ele-ments that are obviously well within the knowledge of both the doctor administering the abortion and the mother of the fetus being aborted.
Given all these points that contribute to the inten-
tionality of abortion — a process in which a not-fully-developed human is destroyed — how is Raymond, involved in an allegedly inadvertent murder, more cul-pable than the average abortion doctor?If the difference is time, I can’t 
see how that’s anything but an ulti-mately arbitrary standard. What’s the difference between 12 weeks 
and 38 weeks or, in Raymond’s case, four months? If it’s 
acceptable to kill the fetus 18 weeks from conception, 
why not 100 weeks from conception? As you might’ve learned from the abortionbreastcancer.com folks yes-terday on the Plaza of the Americas, there’s strong evi-dence for an abortion and breast cancer link. The risk to the mother, which is the reason abortions are restricted to first and second trimesters, would most assuredly be greatly reduced if the abortion happened after birth. 
If the only difference is the status of the fetus and 
its dependence on the mother, the justification is once again subjective. 
Premature babies have a small chance of surviving 
the dangerous process of early birth, so even when the natural process of a baby coming to a status of being able to survive outside the womb is interrupted, there’s a chance the baby can survive. If this is true, then what means of differentiating between those eligible and in-eligible for abortion do we have? 
There’s always the chance an aborted baby would’ve 
been born into a situation judged not worth living for. 
Though I’m not clear on who it is that decides these 
things; if we’re using this justification, then the actions of Raymond are a happy accident at worst and a com-mendable action at best. If the child had not died at this point, he would’ve been at the mercy of a quack nurse and a short-tempered grandfather, possibly to be abused far more painfully than the peaceful death by 
means of antidepressants. 
All I’m asking for is some consistency, America.

Amendment 
Showdown
We don’t have much time here, so let’s get down to busi-
ness.
Don’t be fooled by Amendment 1’s brevity. It’s the most con-
fusing, mind-spinning ballot bubble option you’ll have this year 
unless you’re a Democratic-leaning fetus. If passed, Amend-
ment 1 would end government funding of certain statewide 
political campaigns voters passed in 1998. And as Florida finds itself in deeper economic trouble than Bernie Madoff with no change to spare, we want you to vote “Yes” on 1. 
But as we say that, we’d like to follow it up with our hopes 
that citizens of Florida can gather enough petitions to start a new amendment proposal to place a cap on political spend-ing in Florida. This way , everyone can have a fair shot and see through the sludge particular millionaire mudslingers (read: 
Rick Scott) can afford to throw. 
This year, Amendment 2 is not about putting heterosexual 
families first, as Floridians worked out that mess two years ago. 
Instead, Amendment 2 is proposing to give deployed military members who own property an additional tax break. As we said with Amendment 1, Florida just can’t afford to lose any more Benjamins here. We realize soldiers do an invaluable service in wars that many Americans are against, but the buck stops here. Vote “No” on 2.
Now this is where it gets confusing. Amendments 3 and 7 
were taken off the ballot by the Florida Supreme Court, but no one updated the numbers on the amendments. Don’t  worry. Your ballot is fine.
Amendment 4 this year is the whole enchilada of media at-
tention. If passed, this mother of all ballot initiatives would give voters additional power to veto any changes in comprehen-sive use plans. Don’t like the industrialized look of Clearwater Beach now? Hate the loss of trees in West Palm Beach? If passed, 
you’d have a voice to stop that kind of overdevelopment. The 
major opponents of this amendment? Realtors and builders, ob-viously. Take back what’s yours. Vote “Yes” on 4.
If passed, Amendments 5 and 6, affectionately referred to as 
the “Fair District Amendments,” would put an end to that time-less political process known as gerrymandering. The legal- but-frowned-upon-by-the-political-party-not-in-power-and-thus-not-engaging-in-it process involves drawing legislative and congressional districts to favor one political party over another. 
These are common sense amendments, Gators. V ote “Yes” 
on Amendments 5 and 6. 
Remember what we said? No Amendment 7. Again, your 
ballot is fine. Keep working with us.
Remember when a majority of voters approved smaller class 
sizes in 2002 and Florida never really enforced it? Amendment 8 is designed to “relax” that ruling. Stick it to ‘em, Gators. Show Florida we want the same smaller classes our parents voted on eight years ago. Vote “No” on Amendment 8.
But thanks to an amendment we also passed in 2006, ironi-
cally with less than 60 percent of the vote, any amendment needs at least 60 percent to pass. Good luck, Amendment 4 pro-ponents.

Reader disappointed with endorsement
Wednesday’s endorsement for attorney gen-
eral was the worst endorsement yet in the series 
of political endorsements. 
The editorial wasted half the page attacking 
Bill McCollum, who isn’t even on the ballot. It 
spent the rest swooning over Dan Gelber’s vague 
and flowery stances on “protecting children” and “taking on Wall Street” sans any substantive policy proposals, with a few lines mischaracter -
izing Pam Bondi’s positions whilst speculating on what you feel she will do peppered in.     
Maybe, if you did your journalistic duty, you 
would contact her campaign about her stance on “protecting children” instead of claiming she has 
no stance because you were too lazy to go be-
yond skimming her website. Maybe you would have seen that Bondi has been a tough and suc-cessful prosecutor in Tampa and has real-world experience going after criminals and defending citizens.
Meanwhile, Gelber has spent the last decade 
in Tallahassee biding his time for a higher office.

Block tuition a discriminatory policy
Francisco Sotomayor’s Tuesday letter com-
pletely ignores the struggles of working-class students. Sure, block tuition might be great for someone who wants to take underwater basket weaving, but some of us actually have to work 
to get through college.
I find block tuition to be a offensive policy that 
only shows how out of touch the Board of Gov-
ernors is. Students who have to work one or two jobs to pay their way through school shouldn’t be punished just so Sotomayor can take a sports or art class he doesn’t want to pay for.
I hope students here will stand against this 
discriminatory proposal.  UF is a diverse institu-
tion. Let’s not let it become a place where only 
the silver-spoon elites can make it.

On April 8, 2009, Dr. Hunt Wil-
lard and four of his students met Duke football coach David 
Cutcliffe in his office. 
The topic of the 90-minute talk was 
not game plans or football strategy, but 
genetics: how to predict athletic success by studying gene codes, and how to prevent injuries by identifying particu-lar genes.
The discussion was new to the Yoh 
Football Center, and it promised a col-laborative — if improbable — future be-tween Duke’s football program and the Institute for Genome Sciences & Policy.
“[Cutcliffe] was very forthcoming 
and said he was a big believer in it,” said Willard, the Institute’s director. “He said he can sort of see the kids who have an in-born talent.”
Few tangible results for Duke foot-
ball, though, have come from the meet-ing. 
The more immediate issues awaiting 
the football program and the rigors of a 12-game season have taken precedent with the program.
But a unique opportunity awaits 
Cutcliffe and his team. One day, given the Institute’s early data, the football program will be able to look at athletes’ gene codes and identify the injuries to which they are most susceptible. 
This information could change the 
way all of Duke’s varsity teams train, practice and play.
“[Hunt] is a pretty phenomenal in-
dividual,” Cutcliffe said. “If [the plan] prevents injuries then I’m all for it.”
Willard is a lithe man with a body 
more suitable for a running track than a football field. 
He was a realist about his football 
talent, knowing it would take him no farther than high school, and he would have to get his football fix in the future by rooting for his beloved Boston (now New England) Patriots.All of this 
— other than the rooting alle-giances, perhaps 
— would not change if he had been 
dropped on the doorstep of, say, Archie 
and Olivia Manning as an infant, he said. 
He would have grown up in an en-
vironment that fostered football excel-
lence, but his body would never allow 
that level of success. 
Willard’s genes simply are not sup-
portive of a high-level football player.
He denied, though, that simply 
looking at genes allows someone to see whether an athlete will be successful. 
Intelligence and work ethic, not to 
mention the sheer number of human 
genes, ensure that.
“I think genetics plays a role in our 
physical abilities, but I think there are 
thousands of genes that contribute to that,” Willard said. “So testing for them 
is naive.”
Predicting the degree of success an 
athlete will have in a given sport is such 
an imperfect science, in fact, that Wil-lard and his students began to move 
away from it early in their studies. 
Instead, they began focusing on in-
jury prevention.
“[The genome sciences] have limited 
capability for predicting athletic abili-ty,” said Sally Liu, a student in Willard’s 
capstone class and Marshall scholar 
who is now a first-year medical student at the University of Pennsylvania. “I think from a medical standpoint, it can have an impact on the type of training you can do.”
Around the same time that Willard’s 
students set up a meeting with Cutc-liffe, the doctor identified 18 genes with variants related to athletics. 
Willard found the gene C0L1A1 re-
lates to ACL tears — it manufactures collagen, the protein crucial to keep-ing ligaments strong. If an athlete has a “wonky” version of this gene, in the words of Willard, he has an increased risk of injury.
“They’re not going to bother you 
walking around,” he said. “But when you’re putting stress on [the knee], there’s an increased risk that it might tear.”
Another gene identified by Willard 
was the AP0E gene, which has implica-tions for athletes suffering from head injuries. 
A variety, TT, may increase the risk 
of dementia and long-term neurological 
damage, especially if a football player 
takes repeated hits to the head. 
Another variance, AP0E4, may con-
tribute to early-onset Alzheimer’s.
Willard said he never sees a day when 
those who test positive for the variance are not allowed to play football. 
He does, however, believe that if 
testing becomes common, these athletes 
would have to sign a liability waiver.
“The genetics angle is much trickier 
with concussions,” he said. “If someone 
came to me and said, ‘Your kid is at a genetically increased risk for suffering 
early memory loss or early dementia,’ 
I’m buying the kid a tennis racket.”
The scientific findings had the ath-
letic department excited. The overall 
health of the athletes could rise with the 
project, and the school would have an 
impre sive recruiting tool.
“He got me fired up… on a level of 
the welfare of the kids and doing what 
we can to prevent injuries,” Deputy Di-rector of Athletics Chris Kennedy said. “It’s a lot cheaper to prevent injuries than it is to treat them, and it’d be a heck of a recruiting thing. High school kids and their parents see we’re on the cutting edge of this stuff, and that’s at-tractive.”

Scary flicks, local picks
By JOSH SAVAL
avenue contributing writer
If you’ve ever wandered around 
the student ghetto post-midnight — or 
shopped at the Oaks Mall — you know 
that Gainesville can be creepy. Really creepy.
But not as creepy as these movies. 
Here to help you gear up for Halloween, 
the Avenue’s movie night picks are in-
spired by our own creepy, creaky college town. Watch with caution.
“Night of the Creeps” (1986)
Those Human vs. Zombies kids would 
be proud: An alien experiment crashes to earth and infects a fraternity mem-
ber who is then frozen but accidentally 
thawed in the 1980s by two pledges. The corpse then proceeds to infect the campus with parasites that enter their 
victims through the mouth and transform their hosts into killer zombies.
“The Gainesville Ripper” (2010)
This is a real horror story — a story 
that hits as close to home as they come. 
Telling the tale of a true monster, killer 
Danny Rolling, this movie was filmed in 
Gainesville and retells the brutal mur -
ders of five college students. Remem-ber those that were lost, as they were 
Gators, too.
“Sorority Row” (2009)
This remake of “The House on Soror -
ity Row” (1983) goes out to all those 
pranksters out there. 
If a prank goes horribly wrong and 
someone dies, don’t cover it up because someone will hunt you down at a “killer” party — if you catch my drift. 
Luckily, pretty much the only thing the 
sorority girls around here have to worry about is shopping at the Oaks Mall.
Get lost: Gainesville corn maze celebrates Halloween  
By MELINDA CARSTENSEN
avenue writer
All is still and quiet at Rog-
ers Farm but for a faint breeze 
and the soft, muffled clucks of a 
few chickens behind barbed wire.  
Near them are ponies, donkeys, goats and a mule, all of which roam slowly within their pens while 
a few dusty pigs lie in peace, side 
by side.
Next to a mini maze of hay and 
a deflated, gigantic bouncing pillow 
are dozens of big, orange pump-
kins, some bright orange, some tawny —  all waiting to be inspected and selected by one of the thou -
sands of children on field trips who 
will visit the farm this week.
In the distance, ensconced in 
hushed rays of sunlight, rustles a 
seemingly eternal stretch of 6-foot-
tall corn stalks. Within the patch lie 
downtrodden stalks and dusty dirt trails, deserted and silent for now 
— though they won’t be for long.
On October weekend nights, the 
rows are alive with the shrieks of 
playful victims and games of masked 
men with chainsaws and cloaked 
monsters with pumpkins for heads.  
All of these things — the vegetables, the maze, the hay, games and scares —  are part of Rogers Farm’s second 
annual Corn Maze and Fall Festival.  
Started in the mid-70s by Larry 
Rogers, Rogers Farm consists of 2,000 acres of land that grows 
sweet corn, strawberries, okra and 
15 varieties of beans and peas year-round.
After hearing from a friend and 
fellow farmer in Georgia about the 
success of fall festivals and corn 
mazes, Rogers decided to open his 110-acre farm headquarters, 3831 NW 156th Ave., to the public.  
With the help of his son Greg, 48, and grandson Sidney, 25, he organized all the festivities, and the event has been a hit not only among Alachua County resi-dents, but in all of north Florida.  
During the week, from 9 a.m. to 1 p.m., elementary school students from as far north as Jacksonville 
and as far south as Ocala pay $6 
to visit the farm during its non-haunted hours. Haunted hours start at 8 p.m. on weekends, when guests pay $12 to wander the 10-
acre maze where people in spooky 
Jason X masks and bloody nurse, clown and witch costumes scour the premises. Guests who don’t 
partake in the haunted zones pay 
$8 on weekends for festivities alone.
So far on non-haunted week -days this month, about 4,600 el-ementary school students have visited the farm — more than four times the number of students who visited last October, said 
Rogers’ grandson Sidney, man-
ager and co-owner of the farm.  
Last weekend, more than 3,000 people came by — a significant in-
crease from the farm’s best week -
end last October, when only 500 
came.
Sidney, who graduated from UF 
in 2007 with a bachelor’s degree in 
business, is one of the main players 
behind the farm’s recent success.  
In a management style he de -
scribes as “aggressive, yet polite,” 
he continually ensures that guests 
have a functional, reliable website to access, that trash on the premis-es is picked up, that no guests are drinking alcohol or smoking on the 
farm and that the Porta-Potties are 
cleaned frequently.
Also, he takes it upon himself to 
ensure that no physical arguments 
occur, constantly monitoring the 
10 divided quadrants of his 10-acre corn field, map and flashlight in hand. Mainly, he makes sure his employees and volunteers are 
doing their jobs by not touching 
guests and that guests are follow -
ing his strictly laid-out rules by not touching them, either. 
And, when he’s not work -
ing, he’s taking part in the fun.  
On weekends, he works along-side his 29 other employees as a “scarer” on the Spook Trail, a 
200-yard slice of woods with quick -
sand (a mattress under leaves), 
strobe lights and fog machines.  
Trading in his T-shirt and jeans 
for a “teethy” vampire-like 
mask, Sidney hides in a little nook among the trees, pops out and scares those walking by.  
“I’ve had people urinate them-selves, fall down,” he said. 
He also remembered a 
time when a guest got so 
scared she had a panic attack.  
“I got a call on my walkie-talkie,” 
he said.
“[The guest] was freaking out. I 
practically had to carry her out of the corn maze.”
While guests can use flash-
lights by giving a $3 safety deposit, he said, where the “scarers” are — within the maze or the Spook 
Trail — it’s nearly pitch black.  
“There’s no lights,” he said, “…just 
the moonlight.”
Sunday is the last night to walk 
through the Spook Trail.

ave Tricks to look like a treat
  By ALLISON BANKO
 avenue writer
  Sure, you’ve been going buck wild in 
all of autumn’s glory: breathing in sweet 
smells of cinnamon, indulging in can-dy corn, busting out the pumpkin spice candles. You may think you’ve got the fall feel down, but does your wardrobe? Fall’s fashion trends are chic and so vogue, but pulling them off may not be 
as straightforward as your Snooki cos-
tume will be this weekend (Hair poof? Orange tan? Boobs? Check!). Follow the Avenue’s tricks to looking like a true fall fashionista treat. Consider this our supersized candy bar to you on your trick-or-treat stop.
  Treat: Military boots Trick: The military lace-up boots 
have been trotting Hollywood’s streets on the regular. Celebs from Kim Kar-dashian to Lindsay Lohan (outside of the Big House) to Rachel Bilson have been spotted donning pairs of these babies. Because this trend is one of the boldest of the season, be sure to balance out the bulky look with lighter pieces. Military boots are a fabulous 
date for skinny jeans, and they add some attitude to an innocent dress and deep-hued tights. You’ll be com-
manding a stylish salute in no time. 
  Treat: Fur vests  Trick: The fall 2010 collections on 
the catwalk were exploding with fur accents. Sophisticated designers, in-cluding Oscar de la Renta, Derek Lam and Michael Kors, spotlighted the look in their shows. However, the Avenue is 
most certainly not going to urge fash-
ionistas to go shooting in the woods of Alachua in hopes of a fab outﬁ  t. Opt for (way cheaper) faux fur pieces. And please, only one piece at a time so you don’t have that whole Cruella de Vil thing going on.
  Treat: Cut-out dresses   Trick: Peekaboo! Cut-out dresses 
are the solution to hanging on to sum-mer’s sex appeal in your closet. Stars like Katy Perry, Halle Berry and Rihan-na have all ﬂ  aunted this fall trend. Cut-out dresses are usually tight-ﬁ  tting, ex-posing small areas of skin such as the collarbone, shoulders or back. When choosing your cut-out dress, be sure that the slits are subtle — we wouldn’t 
want you to look like you just got busy 
with Edward Scissorhands. The dress-es are form-ﬁ  tting and generally solid in color, so keep the overall ensemble

simplistic to maintain a classy look 
with a sprinkle of sexy.
  Treat: Sheer layering   Trick: Have you noticed the frigid 
chill in the air? Yeah, we haven’t either. 
While the rest of the country is pop-
ping fall coats off their hangers, it’s a little too soon for us Floridians. Right now, temperatures are in the awkward place between tanks and sweaters, and the Avenue has just the solution — sheers.
Alexander Wang’s Fall 2010 col-
lection was oozing with black, sheer 
pieces. Utilize your classic summer 
camisoles by accenting them under a delicate sheer, long sleeve blouse. Pair the look with a pair of shorts and presto! You’ve got a fashion trend tran-sitioning summer into fall that won’t leave you dripping in sweat.
  Treat: Polished blazers  Trick: Modern fashion has slipped 
on a unisex cloak over the years, chan-neling menswear into closets normally full of frilly dresses. Polished, simple-colored blazers are an effortless way to add sophistication to any fall out-ﬁ  t. Just don’t pair your blazer with an identical colored pant. Too much menswear is more Hillary Clinton than Hilary Swank. ALISTEach Thursday, the Avenue is serving up the best in entertainment,

Saw 3D
What better way to celebrate Hallow-
een than by getting scared out of your 
wits from the suspense and grossed out 
by all the gore that “Saw” movies always unfailingly provide? Although this movie is the seventh install-
ment in the series and Jigsaw – that freaky, sadist 
clown with those big, bulging eyes – just doesn’t seem to tire of torturing people, this time around, the movie’s producers are sure to show audiences a few new tricks. Sure, it’s no surprise that the ﬁ  lm’s in 3-D, but its usual brand of gruesome content may be even more spine-tingling in this format. Audiences will be so close to the action, they’ll feel like they’re almost able to touch the splattering blood and guts. Spooky.  see Speak Now
 Taylor Swift’s highly anticipated third 
album drops this week, and it’s sure to 
send girls young and old alike into a frenzy, push-
ing and shoving to get to music shelves and hurriedly clicking away on iTunes. Though the album’s theme 
isn’t fairytale per se – as was “Fearless,” her sophomore 
project and the best-selling album of 2009 – you can bet it’s bursting with teenage romance. And because old habits die hard, you can also bet she’ll implicitly bash her presumed former ﬂ  ames –  “Glee” star Cory Mon-teith, “Twilight” heartthrob Taylor Lautner and possibly even Twitter-quitter and pop-rocker John Mayer.
Back to the Future Trilogy
 It’s been 25 years since Marty McFly ﬁ  rst 
hopped into the DeLorean and embarked 
on one of Hollywood’s funniest and most

was released on Blu-ray this week – appropriately on 
Oct. 26, the day Marty met Doc Brown and traveled back to 1955. The three-disc package includes two hours of bonus footage, including ﬁ  lm of Eric Stoltz, who was originally set to play Marty until Michael J. Fox replaced him ﬁ  ve weeks into production. Also, watch 16 deleted scenes and a six-part documentary with interviews from the cast and crew. buy Be a gentleman — ladies ﬁ  rst
    Dear Jared,
  When you’re with a girl who is less verbal or au-
dible during sex and it’s not always easy to know when she’s had an orgasm, how are you supposed to know when you’re good to go for yourself with-
out just blatantly a  sking? Guys, you may know, are 
much easier to tell   when this event has happened.
  Sincerely,  Waiting For Release
  Nothing is more irritating during a headboard-rocking,hitting-her-with-your-best-shots sweat fest than a bedmate who seems like 
he or she would rather be at the Arby’s down the street.
  I mean, a little acknowledgment that you’re 
not entirely bored while you’re working up a sweat is always appreciated. Then again, no one wants 
a screamer who insists on yelling for you to say her name or one who thinks loudly labeling you “Daddy” while your roommates are trying to share a bowl of quinoa in the kitchen is appropriate sex etiquette. But a teensy moan of encouragement just gets the groove back in your gyrate.
  And yes, honey, thank you for pointing out to me 
a man’s race to the ﬁ  nish is much more noticeable 
than a woman’s. 
  Perhaps you should just give the whole sleeping 
with a man thing a go, as this would seem to solve all our problems.  But no, I suppose that’s 
not very realistic. 
  Also, I applaud you on 
your chivalry for wanting to please your lady and ﬁ  nish 
last. We might not wear 
armor or live in castles, la-dies, but at least we want you to ﬁ  nish ﬁ  rst. I doubt even Lancelot had that much dedication.
  And ﬁ  nishing ﬁ  rst, especially if you’re always the 
only one who’s crossing the climatic ﬁ  nish line, can be a bit awkward as you begin to examine your abili-
ties to help your naked teammate. 
  I have minimal experience sexing up the less-
certain climaxing sex, but the ability and the need 
to communicate about sex is something both sexes can appreciate. 
  Even though guys have a much more noticeable 
ﬁ  nishing process, communication is still key. Talk about your hoo-hoos and wee-wees. Does she even like the way you lick her feet? Maybe she’s not get-
ting there as fast as you are because she can’t get 
off unless you smother her with cabbage. Blatantly asking her, which is apparently what you’re afraid to do, might just be the key to what she’s been missing from you. 
  C’mon, baby, let’s talk about sex.  Have a question for our resident sexpert? Send 
Jared an e-mail at Jmisner@alligator.org. Your name will not appear in print or online if selected.  sex and the swamp 

Start the Fest-ivities: Amping up for a weekend of rock 
The Crusty: A poem about our favorite Fest goer
By RICHARD STEHLI
avenue writer
Editor’s Note: This humor poem was 
inspired by Edgar Allan Poe’s “The Raven.”
Once upon a late October, while I 
studied starkly sober,
Over many a boring textbook, prepar -
ing for some dreaded test.
While I drifted, my eyes blinking, sud -
denly I smelt a stinking,
As of some unwashed folks slinking, 
slinking about near my nest.
“‘Tis some visitors,” I ventured, 
not sure who, but un-distressed.  
“Maybe hipsters,” I did guess.
I pulled the window curtains back, 
peering out into the black.
Outside stood some gothic figures, 
pierced all over, strangely dressed.While into the blackness peering, I  
saw they were crusties — tattooed, leer -
ing,
In my direction smugly sneering, unin-
vited, ten abreast.
“It might be rude, but I must wonder, 
why you’re here,” I said, this time, dis-tressed.
Said the crust punks, “It’s the Fest!”Barefoot on my porch they sauntered, 
by my spurning all undaunted,
Smoking cigarettes and shuffling, 
apathetic and unimpressed.
Clad in black with ‘hawks and dreads, 
dirty bandannas on their heads,
Wearing all sorts of punk-rock 
threads, vests and ripped jackets across their chests, “Leave us be!” I said with vigor, “Can you follow my request,  
And find some new place to infest?”
Jeering at my inquisition, taking up 
the opposition, Stepping forward as their spokes-
man, a dreadlocked crusty with a ragged vest.
“Shut your mouth and stop your whin-
ing, no amount of crabby pining,
Will prevent us from reclining on your 
porch, as unwanted guests.
The town is ours for our own purpose!There’s no need to be depressed:  
Join us! 
Come enjoy the Fest!”By the thousands all converging, into 
Gainesville, proudly surging,
Their look, their noise, their unwashed 
smell, none of which can be suppressed.
Taking space at my favorite bar, Crack -
ing cans of PBR, 
Our town is soiled, used and marred,  
as though that was a crusty’s quest.
Love or hate them, they’re here 
this weekend, tolerable at best.  
Brace yourselves, ‘cause it’s the Fest.
By BENJAMIN EVANS
  avenue writer
If you’re downtown any time between Friday and Sun-
day, you’ll probably notice an influx of 15-passenger vans, 
Paul Bunyan beards, bicycle traffic and Pabst Blue Ribbon 
beer cans on the side of the road.
Don’t be alarmed. It’s just the Fest.  
Back in 2002, No Idea Records, a local punk label, or -
ganized the first Fest, a music festival held at several of 
Gainesville’s downtown bars, music venues and restau -
rants. Since the first Fest, the event has expanded from six 
venues to 12, and from two days to three days.This year’s fest is expected to bring in about 
4,000 people, according to Cam Taylor, a representa-tive of No Idea Records. Even from the beginning, the Fest has been more than just bands playing. People from all across the country roll in to town to get be -
fuddled with friends in one of America’s punk meccas.  
To put it in a Fest veteran’s words, it’s simple: “Booze. Ho -
tel parties. House parties. Street parties — and watching bands, I guess,” said Cory Manning, The Riot Before bass-ist, who will be playing the Fest for the fourth time this year. 
Taylor’s first Fest was Fest 5 in 2006.
“I was 19 years old and drank a whole lot,” he said. “I 
didn’t think I would get away with it. It was awesome.”only in gainesville

Come Friday, Gainesville will be flooded with out-of-
towners from all over the world who come to take part in 
the famous Fest. But let us not forget that Gainesville owes 
its ability to host a huge indie festival due to its own healthy 
and vibrant local music culture. Ready to go local? Here are three Gainesville-bred acts you can’t miss at the Fest.
 Assassinate The Scientist
Where: Rum Runners, Saturday, 6:20-6:50 p.m.
Sounds like: Technical punk with a pop sensibility, or, “a pterodactyl with a megaphone,” according to singer and guitarist Gary Kreitzer.
Want to know more? These guys came together in 2007 
and are rocking the Fest for the third time.
 Coffee Project
Where: Civic Media Center, Saturday, 6:10-6:40 p.m.
Sounds like: Straight-forward, personal acoustic ballads, featuring the trombone player of Less Than Jake.Want to know more? The pair started jamming together 
when Less Than Jake was still touring, but started releasing 
their own records and lining up gigs in 2007.
 Greenland Is Melting
Where: Rum Runners, Friday, 7:20-7:50 p.m.
Sounds like: Bluegrass folk punk only Gainesville can de -
liver.Want to know more? This is Greenland’s first time playing 
the Fest.Local bands need 
love, too, at the FestClassifieds ALLIGATOR

POLL RESULTS UF BASKETBALL TEEING OFF WITH MIKE McCALL MISSISSIPPI STATE’S CHRIS 
HUGHES WAS SUSPENDED 
FOR A FLAGRANT HIT.
By TYLER JETT
Alligator Staff Writer
tjett@alligator.org
 
Urban Meyer is in favor of strict 
punishment for helmet-to-helmet 
hits.
The topic came up just hours 
after the Southeastern Conference suspended Mississippi State line-backer Chris Hughes on Wednesday Hughes was not punished for lead-ing with his helmet, but for making unnecessary contact with UAB wide receiver Frantrell Forrest away from game action, SEC officials said. 
Helmet-to-helmet hits received 
national attention when the NFL fined Steelers linebacker James Har -
rison for his hit on Browns receiver Mohamed Massaquoi on Oct. 17. When discussing the issue, Meyer noted that his 11-year-old son, Nate, will start playing football next year.
“I never studied it, never thought 
about it because that’s a harsh penal-
ty for playing a very physical game,” 
Meyer said. “But if you launch your head into a guy , I think that warrants a suspension. A face-up, hard-colli-sion hit, that’s part of the game. But if you are projecting yourself into a guy, I do believe that (deserves pun-ishment).”
Florida-Georgia Recruiting:  
While Meyer said the coaching staffs from UF and Georgia are always competing for the best high school players, he doesn’t think the pag-eantry surrounding the annual rival-ry factors into a player’s decision.
“That’s more of the previous re-
cruiting days,” Meyer said. “This is 
now all about opportunity to play 
and that kind of stuff. That’s what I’m noticing.”
The Bulldogs feature 14 Florida 
natives while the Gators feature 10 players from Georgia. One of those players is defensive tackle Omar Hunter.
Hunter attended Buford (Ga.) 
High with Bulldogs offensive tackle Kolton Houston, guard Dallas Lee and long snapper Billy Johnson. 
Injuries: Running backs Jeff 
Demps (sprained left foot) and Mike Gillislee (hamstring) have not prac-ticed at full speed this week, Meyer said, but Emmanuel Moody (thigh bruise) has looked good. 
Kicker Caleb Sturgis practiced 
Monday , and Meyer said he will probably play against Georgia on Saturday . 
Wide receiver Chris Rainey , 
meanwhile, remains eligible. 
“He’s done everything he’s sup-
posed to do,” Meyer said. “(Today) is the deadline that I set with him and myself.”

Earlier in the week coach Mary Wise 
warned her players that despite South 
Carolina’s last-place standing, it was go-
ing to test Florida with defense and con-stant effort. 
Through two sets, it looked like she 
might have been right. 
But then the Gators (19-1, 12-0 South-
eastern Conference) took their game to another level and showed a national TV audience why they’re the No. 1 team in 
the nation, rattling off a 25-13 third set to 
beat the Gamecocks (5-17, 2-10 SEC) 3-0 (25-20, 25-17, 25-13) Wednesday night in the O’Connell Center.
Senior Callie Rivers and junior Kelly 
Murphy led the way for Florida, as each recorded 11 kills and five digs against South Carolina.
Murphy hit .375 for the match, while 
Rivers went errorless on her way to a .524 hitting efficiency. 
“Callie’s play, both back row and front 
row, was pretty special today,” Wise said.  
“She had it going. She was in a zone serv-
ing, passing and hitting. 
It was just one of those nights where it was like the game was going slow 
motion for her because 
she just saw the whole 
court, and really it was one of the best per -
formances of her career, fun to watch.”
Rivers also led the Gators with four 
aces, three of which came during a 10-0 run after South Carolina took the opening Rivers leads three-set 
win against Gamecocks
It is said that God built the world in 
six days and rested on the seventh. 
But Urban Meyer has a much 
tougher job in front of him.
The UF coach has had no time to lay 
back in the two weeks leading up to Sat-urday’s game against Georgia.
How could he?Florida has lost three straight regu-
lar season games for the first time since 1988 and the team has shown little signs of turning the ship around in its first 
seven games.
While players went home to visit 
their families and eat some home cook-
ing during their week off, Meyer was 
watching film. Lots of film. He studied the 
Gators’ offense, 
which we all know is not an enviable 
job with the snail-
like pace it uses to move down the field. And he didn’t just skim 
over snaps, the 
coach dissected 
each and every one.
But is it enough to help the nation’s 
97th best offense? 
I’m a strong believer that talent wins 14 days still not enough time 
for Meyer to fix UF’s offense

Scottie Wilbekin has been going 
up against bigger and older com -
petition his entire life. 
The freshman guard played on an eighth grade team at age 9, and 
had made the jump to Gainesville 
The Rock’s varsity team by the 
time he was in sixth grade.
Wilbekin will again be one of 
the youngest players on the court 
tonight as the 17-year-old begins 
his collegiate career with No. 11 Florida’s exhibition matchup 
against Florida Tech at 7 in the 
O’Connell Center. 
Although he will be playing 
alongside veterans like senior Ver -
non Macklin — who has seven 
years, eight inches and 65 pounds 
on Wilbekin — the freshman is confident he can fit in at the colle-
giate level. 
“I’m used to it by now,” Wil-
bekin said. “In AAU I’ve been playing with people that tall and 
that big, so it’s really not that big 
of a difference.”
One thing the veterans and 
coaches point to as a potential 
hang-up for incoming freshmen is the increased conditioning re-
quired to physically compete in 
the Southeastern Conference. 
But Wilbekin says that the con-
ditioning hasn’t been that tough, and that he is yet to reach a point 
where he really struggled or fell 
behind some of the older players.
The freshman, who has always 
been known as a hard worker, has been putting the 10 to 15 pounds 
he added in the weight room since 
the summer of 2009 to good use.
“He’s a strong kid, he’s a physi-
cally strong kid for a young kid,” coach Billy Donovan said after 
the team’s first weekend of two-a-
days. “We’re going up and down and running and doing that stuff 
on a regular basis, and I don’t see 
him really physically getting tired 
or totally overwhelmed.”
This level of conditioning and 
physical preparation is surprising from Wilbekin, who decided to 
forgo his senior year of high school 
at The Rock to get an early start at 
UF. 
Wilbekin ended his junior year 
needing only a single English cred-it to earn his diploma, and he was able to complete that requirement 
just a few weeks after the semester ended.
While skipping senior year 
would be a huge decision for al-
most anyone, Wilbekin had a rath-
er easy time with it. He knew he 
was choosing to fulfill his lifelong 
dream of playing in a Florida uni-
form.
“Overall, I knew that I wanted 
to be a Gator,” Wilbekin said. “So it really wasn’t that big of a deci-
sion.”
Wilbekin’s presence has already 
given the team a boost in practice, 
as the addition of another talented guard means returning starters Er -
ving Walker and Kenny Boynton have an additional player to work against as they try to improve. 
Wilbekin should also be a major 
help to Walker and Boynton dur -
ing games, as the freshman said he can be relied upon to give the two starters a breather due to his high 
basketball IQ and solid ball han-
dling ability. 
“I’ll come in for Erv, come in for 
K.B., just give them rest so they can perform to their highest abilities,” 
Wilbekin said. 
Donovan said that Wilbekin, 
like every other player on this 
year’s roster, should expect to see 
15 to 25 minutes of action tonight. 
Regardless of how long he 
plays, Wilbekin is excited to have 
the chance to compete in front of 
his friends, family and fans.
“I’m gonna be excited,” Wil-
bekin said. “It’s been a long time and it’s finally here. The freshmen, we’ve talked a little bit about it, 
and we just can’t wait.”18, ALLIGATOR � THURSDAY, OCTOBER 28, 2010

Junior backup goalkeeper Brooke Chancey has seen the field in two 
games during her career at Florida.
By JESSE SIMONTON
Alligator Writer
 
When Brooke Chancey was in 
high school, she was a star. 
A big fish in a little pond, the 
goalie from St. John’s Country 
Day School, a small Jacksonville 
private school, led her team to 
two Class 2A state titles and set the Florida high school record for shutouts in a season. 
Yet on weekend afternoons in 
Gainesville, most fans at No. 8 Florida’s soccer games probably couldn’t even tell you who she was.
Such is the life of a collegiate 
backup goalie.
While tons of athletes come to 
college and have the realization that they are no longer super -
stars, backup soccer goalies have little opportunity to prove other -
wise.
Chancey, a junior, is the de 
facto second-string goalie for the Gators, but she has played in just two games throughout her entire 
career. 
“It’s a definite struggle, every 
single day,” she said. “Working hard, getting up at 6 a.m., going 
to weights, going to practice, just to know that you’re going to be second [string] at best, it’s hard.”
It’s a common struggle for 
goalies all across the country. 
They’re expected to show up ev-
eryday with a positive attitude and hard-working mindset, just to know that in all likelihood 
they won’t play. 
“It’s the hardest thing on the 
team,” starting keeper Katie 
Fraine said. “In most other posi-tions you’re still getting playing 
time. It is truly a humbling expe-
rience.” 
Fraine is speaking from per -
sonal experience. Despite be-ing an All-Southeastern Confer -
ence keeper, she too, had to ride the pine before finally getting a chance.
“When I was splitting time 
sophomore and junior year, it 
was the hardest time for me in 
my career,” she said. 
Fraine explained that as a 
backup goalie there are so few 
opportunities to stand out, but when you get that one chance there’s so much pressure because 
if you don’t prove yourself it can get swept under your feet. 
Chancey, who grew up root-
ing for the Gators, has taken her 
role in stride. 
Knowing she is still just one 
play away from being the starter, 
Chancey said she competes her 
hardest waiting for her opportu-
nity.
“I have to make sure my atti-
tude is right everyday. We [other backup goalies] joke that we’re 
here to get Katie better.”
On Sept. 3, Chancey’s dream 
of finally entering a game came 
true. 
At halftime, up 3-0 against 
Jacksonville University, the coaches told her she would go in once the Gators scored another goal. Overwhelmed with excite-
ment and anticipation, she went 
and pleaded with her teammates to score again. 
Just four minutes into the sec-
ond half, McKenzie Barney, who promised Chancey they would score for her, scored the goal that signaled a rare opportunity for the backup. 
Chancey allowed zero goal 
during her time in net..
“The whole team pulling for 
me was so cool,” she said. “I was 
so nervous, but so excited.”Bench role proves difficult
Gators recorded nine aces, nine blocks
point of the third set.
Rivers’ fourth service ace came 
later in the same set, and only a questionable call kept her from an-
other one. 
“That was one of the things we 
worked on this week in practice, we 
worked on a ton of serving,” Rivers 
said. 
“I think serving is one of our 
identities. We try to be really tough servers and work on different types 
of serves, so I’m glad it worked in 
this game.”
For the match, the Gators re-
corded nine aces and nine blocks, 
proving why they’re in the top 25 in 
the nation in both categories. 
South Carolina was able to hang 
around in the match and force a number of scramble points through effective defense. 
Although they only tallied two 
blocks, the Gamecocks combined for 38 digs, led by senior libero Hannah Lawing who had 16 for the 
match and 10 in the first set. 
“I think South Carolina did re-
ally well defensively,” Rivers said. 
“They have one of the best liberos 
in the SEC and she played great 
against us.”
But her efforts were not nearly 
enough, as the Gators were able to 
use a strong serving and blocking 
performance to hold South Caro-lina to just .057 hitting, including -.042 in the final set. RIVERS , from page 17“The whole team pulling for 
me was so cool. I was so 
nervous, but so excited.”
McKenzie Barney
UF midfielderChancey is UF’s backup goalie
games, not coaching. However, in this case coach-
ing will have to prevail if the Gators’ offense is go-ing to have any hope of improving, let alone pass 
North Texas, Utah State and Ball State in the offen-
sive rankings. 
The talent just isn’t there for the players to fix 
this themselves. 
If there was one problem area to focus on, it 
would be easy. But everywhere you look there is a hole and not the type of hole a running back can run through, either. I’m talking about personnel problems.
The blame always seems to fall on offensive 
coordinator Steve Addazio, but is it really all his fault? 
Or is John Brantley’s incredible ability to use the 
check-down option as his primary target the reason for the offense’s struggles? 
Maybe it’s the offensive line’s disappointing 
play this season? 
Or could it be Deonte Thompson’s inability to 
catch a football?  
Surely, it must be the injuries to all three of UF’s 
running backs, right? 
Could it be that the offense misses the presence 
of Chris Rainey, who was suspended for the past five games?
Question marks fill the struggling unit. This is 
where coaching comes in. Can Meyer and his assis-tants somehow find a way to make this all work? 
At this point, I say no. 
But if God could build all of what surrounds 
you in six days, maybe Meyer can save this offense 
in 14. 
I’m not sure which feat would be more impres-
sive.ANTHONY , from page 17 THE JUNIOR HAS RECORDED 22 
CATCHES FOR 365 YARDS IN FOUR 
GAMES THIS SEASON.

Following Georgia’s lead may sound 
like an odd desire for Florida, but if the 
Gators are seeking a blueprint for an of-
fensive resurgence, the Bulldogs are a good example.
After a 55-7 win against Louisiana-Lafay-
ette in the season opener, UGA dropped its next four games, averaging just 17 points and falling to 0-3 in the Southeastern Con-ference.
Since then, the Bulldogs have reeled off 
three conference wins in a row to break even, scoring more than 40 points against Tennessee, Vanderbilt and Kentucky, a turnaround that has them back in the con-
ference title race.
“It’s been tough,” quarterback Aaron 
Murray said. “It’s been up and down, 
a pretty crazy season. We start off with a great first game and then went downhill for 
a little bit on a four-game skid and it got a 
little rough. We managed to dig ourselves out of the hole.”
Receiver A.J. Green has been the shovel.
UGA coach Mark Richt cited Murray’s 
growing confidence and more intense prac-
tices as reasons for the offense rebounding, but the biggest change was Green’s return.
Green was suspended for the first four games after he admitted to selling his jer -
sey, but he didn’t miss a beat when he re-turned to the field.
In the last four games, he has racked 
up 365 yards and four touchdowns on 22 catches, better production than any Florida 
receiver through seven games.
He made his presence felt early with a 
leaping, spinning, one-handed touchdown 
grab in a loss to Colorado, and he has a re-ception of 30 yards or longer in every game 
(UF has three total).
“He’s a difference-maker for them,” UF 
defensive coordinator Teryl Austin said. 
“Their offense was functioning well with-out him, but he’s really opened some things 
up for them. Obviously he has the big-play 
capability and can make some catches you can’t defend. You can be in great shape, think you have great coverage and he 
makes the catch anyway.”
But his impact goes beyond big plays.
Murray said he hasn’t seen a team leave 
Green in single coverage once this season, and the focus on Green has made life easier 
for the other 10 players. 
Georgia has three 100-yard individual 
rushing performances since Green’s return 
compared to none in the opening four con-tests.
“They’ll put a safety position to help a 
corner or whoever it might be on [Green], 
and that’s presented more one-on-one cov-
erage for our other receivers and tight ends, and I think it’s also removed a safety a little bit further from the running game,” Richt 
said. “When you get to the safety and he’s 
a little further away, you have a chance to make that guy miss. I think he’s helped a lot.”20, ALLIGATOR  THURSDAY, OCTOBER 28, 2010
