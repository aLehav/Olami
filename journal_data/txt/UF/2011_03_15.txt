MARCO ISLAND — A dolphin 
weighing between 600 and 700 pounds 
jumped onto the deck of a boat, injuring a woman in South Florida.
Isles of Capri Fire spokesman Keith 
Perry says a charter boat captain called 911 Sunday afternoon after the dolphin jumped on the boat and landed on one of his passengers.
The woman who was hit by the dol-phin suffered a sprained ankle. 
The woman’s name was not avail-
able.
Officials from the Isles of Capri Fire 
Department, the Florida Fish and Wild-life Conservation Commission and the Collier County Sheriff’s Office used an immobilizing board and a rope to push the dolphin back into the water.

The 8.9-magnitude earthquake that 
rocked Japan Friday left several nuclear 
power plants unable to cool their reactors, sparking concern about a nuclear crisis in 
a country that is no stranger to the  effects 
of nuclear radiation. 
David Hintenlang, interim chairman 
of the UF Nuclear and Radiological En-
gineering Department, doesn’t believe the plants’ cooling problems will cause long-term damage to the country or its people. 
“You see ‘nuclear’ [and] it gets big 
headlines as a nuclear disaster,” Hinten-
lang said. “For the general public, I don’t 
think there’s a huge radiological issue for them.” 
While some workers may be at risk 
for potential harm either from radiation or, more likely, from structural or me-chanical problems, other citizens should remain mostly safe, he said.

UF student Bryno Gay, 20, was diagnosed with Hodgkin’s lymphoma on Feb. 2. You can contribute to the cause 
through donations at helpbrynobeatlymphoma.chipin.com.
n BRYNO GAY WAS DIAGNOSED WITH HODGKIN’S 
LYMPHOMA LAST MONTH AND HIS INSURANCE MAY NOT COVER ALL OF HIS EXPENSES.
By MORGAN WATKINS
Alligator Writer
Just three days after learning he had Hodgkin’s lympho-
ma, 20-year-old UF student Bryno Gay wanted to run in a 5K 
charity race.
While his friends convinced him to take it easy that day, it 
was that mindset that prompted Gay’s friend and housemate 
Nico Sayavedra to launch a “Helping Bryno Beat Lympho-
ma” Facebook group the following week to raise money for Gay and to provide a place for people to provide emotional support for him through comments.
People have donated about $2,000 since Sayavedra started 
the Web page on Feb. 8. It has 841 members. 
Some donations  have come from Gay’s friends while oth-
ers have come from people who didn’t know him personally but were touched by his story . 
Gay has Stage 3 lymphoma. His fiancée, Tina Diem Tham 
Nguyen, noticed a lump on his throat last fall, and he had a bi-opsy in January, Sayavedra said. He was surprised when Gay told him about his diagnosis, partly because Gay had always been dedicated to eating healthy and exercising.
“I was devastated. I ended up giving him a hug and cry-
ing, but I was trying not to do that,” Sayavedra said. “I want-ed to stay strong.”
Gay’s treatments may cost between $200,000 and $250,000, 
but his insurance may not cover all expenses, in which case Gay may have to pay between $15,000 and $45,000 for medi-cal treatments, Sayavedra said. 
A greater financial strain Gay faces is the need to pay back 
some of his student grants because he isn’t a full-time student this semester, having taken medical leave after his diagno-sis. While UF isn’t making him pay for his I. Douglas Turner grant, Sayavedra hopes donations will help Gay pay the other Friends raise money for student’s battle

UF freshman Molly Ammon, 19, was 
found dead  Sunday morning in Pinellas County by friends who were staying with her at a condo for Spring Break. 
The cause of death is still unknown, ac-
cording to Cecilia Barreda, spokeswoman for the Pinellas County Sheriff’s Office. 
She said the investigation into Ammon’s 
death is still ongoing and she could not re-lease any more information. Barreda said deputies were dispatched to 
13910 Gulf Blvd. Apt. 102 in Madeira Beach on Sunday at 10:55 a.m.
The toxicology and medical examiner re-
ports are still pending.
Barreda said the medical 
examiner’s report usually ar -
rives quicker than the toxicol-
ogy report but that there is no way of know-ing when both will be completed.
Ammon was an accounting student from 
Tampa and a member of Delta Delta Delta sorority . Freshman dies on break

 As it prepares for a curriculum over-
haul for new students, UF’s journalism 
department will be led by a new chair-man.
  Wayne Wanta, who was an associate 
professor at UF from 1999 to 2001, was named the new head of the department Monday.
  Wanta, who is leaving his position 
as the Welch-Bridgewater chairman of sports journalism at Oklahoma State University , was praised by interim chairman David Ostroff as one of the top journalism academics in America. 
  Ostroff added that his familiarity 
with UF was a big selling point.
  “Because he’s been on faculty be-
fore, he knows the culture a little bit,” Ostroff said.
  William McKeen, who led the de-
partment since 1998, left UF last year for a position at Boston University . Since then, Ostroff, who is also the telecom-
munications department chairman, has 
led the journalism department.
  John Wright, the dean of the College 
of Journalism and Communications, said another of Wanta’s selling points was his experience with sports journal-ism and international journalism. 
  Wright said he expects Wanta to 
work with the University Athletic As-
sociation to expand the journalism 
school’s involvement with GatorZone.com and GatorVision, the athletic as-sociation’s news programs, and further the sports journalism options at UF.
  Wanta has eight years of newspa-
per experience, which includes jobs at the Austin American-Statesman, The Albuquerque Journal and The Wiscon-
sin State Journal, as well as 27 years of 
teaching experience.
  Wanta’s one shortcoming, Wright 
said, is his lack of administrative expe-rience.
  “He’ll ﬁ  nd challenges with sched-uling and making sure every single student who needs a seat in a class to 
move forward toward graduation gets 
one,” he said.
        Ostroff said he’ll help ease Wanta 
into his position, most likely starting with assigning graduate assistants to different classes for the fall semester.   
  “Once you step down as an admin-
istrator, you try to step back and get out of the next guy’s way ,” he said. “It’s his department now.”
  Wanta was not available for com-
ment by press time.

 After all the sign-waving, door-knocking and 
hand-shaking, election day has ﬁ  nally arrived.
  Pam Carpenter, supervisor of elections, said  
voters should go to their designated precincts to 
vote. The polls will remain open until 7 p.m.
  In the last Commission race, which was in 
2009, an at-large seat and the District 1 seat were contested and 20,232 people voted. This ac-counted for 26.9 percent of registered voters in Gainesville.
  Carpenter said there were 73,914 eligible vot-
ers in Gainesville as of Monday afternoon.
  “I would encourage anyone to vote, especially 
here at the local level,” she said. “The representa-
tives here making decisions at the local level are the ones making the decisions that have the most impact on 
your life.”
  With 13 candidates in the race, she hinted at 
the possibility of run-offs. Her staff has planned for one or more, just in case.
  Ozzy Angulo, a candidate in the District 3 race, 
said voting is essential to the political process.
  “That’s the most important piece of all of this,” 
he said.
  At-large candidate Richard Selwach, however, 
offered a different take.
  “If you don’t go out and vote, you’re going to 
get what the other guy voted for.”

Gay is facing 12 chemotherapy 
treatments, spaced two weeks apart. 
He has already completed two. 
Gay is a member of the Southern 
Scholarship Foundation, a Florida-based group that provides housing for financially needy students. There are five of these houses at UF, and Gay lives with Sayavedra and four -
teen other students in one of them. 
The organization has been very 
supportive of Gay , donating 80 percent of the proceeds from their 
annual “Date and Cake” auction, 
where they auction a variety of des-serts and many students as “dates,” to his medical costs. So far, they have raised $1,100 for Gay.
The SSF is also letting Gay contin-
ue to live in the organization house through the fall, although normally the SSF requires that all students liv-
ing in its houses must be full-time students. 
Gay’s friends visit him often 
when he is at Shands Hospital. His 
roommate, James Welch, comes to see him almost every day that he’s there. 
“I love him like a brother, and I 
wasn’t going to let him go through this by himself,” Welch said. 
The fundraising efforts for Gay 
have caught the attention of many , including Jamal Sowell, special as-sistant to UF President Bernie Ma-chen and a former UF student body president. Sowell wants to discuss potential fundraising options for Gay , and Sayavedra hopes to meet with him this week.  
With more than $3,000 raised for 
Gay in a month-and-a-half, Sayave-dra hopes to see that total grow.

BRYNO , from page 1Japan nuclear plants can’t be rebuilt
NUCLEAR , from page 1
“I believe that compared with people 
in other nations, Japanese people 
are more prepared for incidents such 
as an earthquake and a tsunami.”
Yasuo Uotate
UF Japanese LecturerThe impacted power plants must release some 
radiation-containing gases to relieve pressures 
in the core, but Hintenlang doesn’t expect the emissions to cause long-term damage because winds should sweep most of the gases toward 
the ocean. 
It will probably take a couple weeks to fully 
cool the reactors and stop the nuclear reactions, 
but the plants won’t be usable again. 
The plants are using saltwater to cool the 
cores, which can cause corrosion. Paired with the 
structural damage, these problems put the opera-tions in a tough spot.  
“Those plants will never operate again unless 
they rebuild them from the ground up,” he said.
Hintenlang said it could take years to fully 
disassemble the plants. 
Despite the country’s post-earthquake nuclear 
problems, he doesn’t expect them to make Japa-nese people leery of nuclear power use. 
“I think the Japanese people by and large 
accept technology and have embraced nuclear power largely because they don’t have other op-tions,” he said. 
Yasuo Uotate, a UF Japanese lecturer from Ja-
pan, said in an e-mail interview that he felt many Japanese people were uncomfortable with hav-ing nuclear power plants in the country but un-derstood its necessity . 
“Most Japanese people have never liked hav-
ing nuclear power plants,” he said.  “However, some towns couldn’t reject having one … [for] financial and political reasons.”  
Japan’s lack of natural resources such as gas 
and oil also makes nuclear power an important option, Uotate said.
He said he expected the nuclear power plant 
problems to make Japan more cautious about building new ones, and said stricter guidelines for crisis management at plants should be imple-
mented. 
“I believe that compared with people in other 
nations, Japanese people are more prepared for 
incidents such as an earthquake and a tsunami,” he said. “However, I don’t think regular Japa-nese people are prepared for nuclear power plant problems.”By JACOB ROMOSER

Barb Thomas is happy to welcome both 
friends and strangers into her yellow 1976 Ford 
Maverick.
All of Thomas’s passengers have one thing 
in common: They have been diagnosed with 
cancer.
Thomas, 57, who fought and won her own 
battle against the disease five years ago, now 
helps current cancer patients with their strug-gle.
She is one of 13 active drivers for the Ameri-
can Cancer Society Road to Recovery program in Alachua County. The program pairs cancer patients who lack transportation with volunteer 
drivers, who pick up patients from their homes, 
drive them to their treatment facilities and take them back home once the treatment is over.
“It is an invaluable service for patients who 
don’t have any other way of getting to their treatment,” Thomas said.The program, however, has hit a roadblock.According to Mel Toran, an area executive di-
rector with the American Cancer Society, Road to Recovery’s need for volunteers is desperate. 
“People are missing their treatments due to 
lack of transportation,” he said.
Toran and Thomas agree that a combination 
of high gas prices and a struggling economy are to blame for the lack of volunteers.
“Sometimes I drive once a month, sometimes 
four,” Thomas said. “It’s a great way to give back after all the help I received while I was in their shoes.”

Three UF students are working to bring the third-largest 
international relief and development charity in the United 
States closer to campus. 
Since summer, Kayla Cochran, Krista Hadeed and Ash-
ley Quintal have been coordinating, meeting and planning 
the debut of Students for the Poor at UF.
The student group would represent Food for the Poor, a national organization that gives more than 96 percent of its 
profits to feeding the poor and providing emergency relief to citizens of 17 Caribbean and Latin American nations. 
Students for the Poor will hold its first 
meeting on March 22 in Little Hall, Room 125. Cochran expects there to be about 30 people in attendance. 
Cochran, a sophomore English major and co-founder 
and secretary of the group, was looking to get involved in a nonprofit organization. “I was especially interested in a nonprofit that had a big 
emphasis on Haiti,” Cochran said. 
SFP is different because it teaches sustainability. The or -
ganization is founded on the principle of teaching a man to fish in order to provide for himself, said Hadeed, a junior linguistics major and co-founder and president of group.
Quintal, a sophomore accounting major and another co-
founder, said building a tilapia farm overseas is a way the organization can sustainably help the poor.   
Cochran said the goal of the first meeting is to present 
the organization and tell students what they can do to help the poor.Students bring new non-profit organization to UF

Stephon Lewis brought $650 of 
his own money when he met the UF student hoping to sell his iPhone 4, 
but Lewis’ friend brought a gun.
Lewis, a 22-year-old UF employ-
ee, was contacted a few weeks ago 
by his lifelong friend Raymond Ste-phenson about robbing a person on Craigslist of his iPhone, according to a Gainesville Police report.
They responded to the student’s 
online advertisement and agreed to 
meet him Sunday at Lexington Cross-
ing Apartments, 3700 SW 27th St.
At 9:40 p.m., Lewis met the stu-
dent at the basketball courts in the complex. Stephenson and another man walked up to Lewis and the student with handguns and said, “This is a robbery,” according to the report.
The two armed men took the 
phone and the money and ran away. 
Lewis told police he was supposed to get his money back from Stephen-
son later.
Lewis was ar -
rested by 11:40 p.m., and he ad-
mitted to police 
that he had helped 
plan the robbery. Text messages con-firmed he knew guns would be in-volved. He is charged with armed robbery.Armed men take iPhone

Today’s question: Did/will you choose your major based solely on economic factors?Monday’s question: Have you ever received an automatic traffic ticket?
74 TOTAL VOTES12% YES88% NOOur hearts go out to the nation of Japan, which is 
coping with a natural disaster combined with a nuclear threat, the likes of which it has never seen. 
Most of us have witnessed the horrific images of the dam-age in the wake of this confluence of problems, be it via Internet, television or newspaper. 
As we have seen time and again, such events bring out 
the best in people. 
They can also highlight the worst.We wonder if someone can publish a disaster policy 
guide to show individuals, businesses and media how to respond to such a scenario. 
We’re no experts on the topic, but with our experience 
in catastrophe-related distastefulness, we ‘d like to volun-teer some suggestions.
Suggestion One: Don’t crack jokes at the expense of a 
devastated area. It’s both unpalatable and unfunny.
Gilbert Gottfried, who was fired from his voice-over 
work with Aflac for tweeting terrible tsunami jokes, knows what we mean. 
Suggestion Two: Don’t try to harness the human urge 
to help in order to advertise your products, no matter how tempting and goodhearted it may seem to do so. 
Microsoft will remember this rule after the scathing 
response to a Twitter post. The company told people it 
would donate a dollar for every re-tweet of a post, but the 
idea came off as a marketing ploy gone completely wrong. It sounded like people had to choose between increasing Bing’s popularity or letting Japan go without their help. The relief effort shouldn’t come with product placement 
opportunities.
Suggestion Three: Give it to us straight. If you don’t 
know what’s happening, tell us so, but don’t make the 
situation sound worse than it is. 
It’s a disaster. People are dying and having their worlds 
dramatically changed. 
In the face of such a pervading sense of hopelessness, 
you shouldn’t make people worry more than they need to. 
Here, we look to all the news channels that reported on 
the nuclear situation in Japan before they had confirma-tion from any officials with the foreign government. We watched CNN cycle through guest after guest, fishing for 
bits of alarming information unearthed only by stripping 
away the logical explanations of various experts. Other channels were little better. 
Which brings us to Suggestion Four: Be polite. This one’s also directed to the media. As we watched 
the painful discussions the news channels had with nucle-ar experts, it dawned on us how rude the anchors were. They not only badgered guests with questions but they then misconstrued their words or sought out someone 
willing to advocate a more outlandish theory.
It’s no time for joking, cashing in or misrepresenting 
information, but rather a time to be upfront and thought-
ful. We can only hope people who lose their way after such an unfathomable event — ourselves included —  could re-
member to be empathetic in times like these. 
Remember that even if they’re on the other side of the 
world, the victims deserve that much.Empathy Lesson
Suggestions for 
approaching a disaster 
Major selection: security over dreams
My mother recently forwarded me an article that list-
ed some popular college degrees, spotlighting ones 
the author considered “winners” and “losers.” His 
rankings are not the focus, but rather the article’s topic. As 
a college student, I have many friends who graduated with 
bachelor’s degrees and are putting them to little use at res-
taurants and retail stores. Understandably, it takes talent, persistence and luck to land any entry-level job, especially 
in the current market, but should four or more hard years of 
collegiate work result in jobs also held by  high school teens? It seems ridiculous, unfair even, but with some of the degrees 
many students choose to pursue, they find themselves emo-
tionally satisfied but unable to secure stable employment. For many people this is irrelevant — their ships on collegiate 
years having sailed — but for those of us still exploring aca-
demia, picking majors, minors, internships and the like, it’s imperative we make smart choices now. “If you love what 
you do, you don’t work a day in your life.” How many 
times have we heard that one? In theory , it’s brilliant. Find something you love, pursue it with all your heart despite the 
odds, and you’ll end up employed with a contented smile on 
your face. However, I’m a bit of a skeptic and find this a little too sweet to palate. It would be incredible if I could make 
money designing jewelry or playing professional basketball, 
but things don’t happen that way for everyone. A very small percentage of people are lucky enough to have the resources 
and opportunities coincide to allow them to work and play 
simultaneously, but for the rest of us it comes down to prac-ticality . Don’t get me wrong, I admire those who follow their 
passions and have the confidence and drive to achieve their 
choice of career, but who has a passion for finance, chem-istry or accounting? Nobody loves those classes or spends 
hours dreaming about equity mortgages and market port-
folios, but those are the practical skills that will allow gradu-ates an easier job search and stable pay opportunities. More and more of the passion-chasers are finding themselves out of luck after 
college, but four years of hard work 
and thousands of dollars aren’t easily forgotten. It’s a fine balance 
between what you love and what is 
practical, and college is the time to get serious about the equilibrium.
I’m not trying to knock any de-
grees here, as they all take talent 
and dedication to achieve. I just want to point out the inop-
portune situation some graduates face when they choose a 
degree out of pure passion and no practicality . As it’ll say at the end of this column, my major is finance and, honestly, it 
kind of sucks. I’ll put it on the record I am in this area almost 
solely for post-collegiate rewards in a job search, and hope-fully financial security and job stability. Those are things I’ve 
chosen to value, and they reflect in my degree choice. Is it 
selling out? Maybe, but after years of thinking on it, I’ve de-cided it’s the smartest choice for me. 
As for that article, the author urges the dreamers to keep 
up their zeal for their studies, preparing themselves for a pos-sible difficult job search, and I’d like to do the same. College 
is a place to blossom and learn about the world and your -
self, but let’s not forget why we’re here. Eventually, we’ll 
want homes and cars and we’ll have kids who need clothes 
and food. While it may seem distant now, it’s closer than 
we think. Make your collegiate years count. Be social, make connections, learn life skills and, most importantly, leave UF 
armed with a degree you are proud of and will take you as 
far as you’d like to go. Twenty years from now, it probably won’t really matter what you majored in, but right now, it 
does.

Aiko Kuromori is a Boise State alumna 
who lives in Tokyo, Japan. Aiko was at work when the earthquake hit. What fol-lows is her story.
I was at my office when the earthquake 
struck with a sudden shock that shook my office building. I felt a drop in my stomach 
as I ducked under the table. The lateral move-ment changed into a parallel movement. It got 
stronger and stronger.
I held onto my colleague. I was shaking in 
fear, hoping it would stop. I was on the 20th 
floor of my office, and the quake lasted for 10 minutes. It felt like centuries. Other buildings around us were rocking as if they were trees in the wind. The thought of death crossed my mind.
After the first earthquake slowed, we evac-
uated from that floor to the floor above so we were all on the same floor. They gave us hel-mets, and we sat under desks. My co-worker and I held hands. She told me that she was ra-happy not to die with a stranger. Then the sec-ond big earthquake hit us. We closed our eyes tight and, with sweaty palms, held hands. I 
noticed that had we ducked underneath a desk 
next to the window. I mentally prepared my-self in case the window shattered. All I could think of was just wanting to be on the ground and not in a skyscraper.
Everybody was safe. We gathered around 
the TV to find out what had happened. On the screen they showed the Sendai Tsunami. A 30-foot-high wave was eating the city alive. 
Houses were being washed away. It was as if I 
was watching the film “Independence Day.”
I surrendered myself to Mother Nature. I 
realized how frail we are in the face of natural disaster. The fear I had experienced was noth-ing compared to what the people in Miyagi and Sendai were expe-riencing.
Moments later I saw 
a huge explosion in the 
sky . The Cosmo Oil storage facility in Chiba had exploded. The explosion was followed 
by a fiery red mushroom cloud. I saw it be-
hind the skyscrapers. Trying to comprehend soemthing like that is the weirdest feeling. I went back to my desk and saw the same ex-plosion on the screen. On a different screen there was an enormous whirlpool that was triggered by the earthquake. We finally got the all-clear to leave the building and we got to the ground. It was such a relief to be on the 
ground. However, we couldn’t use our cell 
phones and the trains were not running. There was a four-hour line at the taxi stand. Some people ended up sleeping at the office or on the ground at the train station. 
The next day I went to the store to buy wa-ter and food, and the shelves were empty. All I got was a ton of chocolate.
When I got home, I heard the news about 
the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant explosion. The nuclear power plant is 125 miles from where I live. I don’t have a TV , so I 
relied on social media, e-mail and text messag-
ing for information. All sorts of rumors were spreading. I was hearing not to go outside be-cause of the meltdown and to keep windows closed. I stayed inside my apartment all day with my computer trying to get more informa-tion. Everybody was worried. Nobody knew what to do or what to expect. The little,  ev-eryday things that worried me were no longer 
important. I am still sitting in my apartment, 
waiting to take action if needed.
 I am concerned for those who are missing 
and grieve with those who lost loved ones.

n UF FELL 12-11 LAST YEAR 
TO COLGATE IN OVERTIME.
By JOHN BOOTHE
Alligator Writer
For the second time this season, 
the No. 10 Gators are not only out 
for a win. They are looking for re-
demption.
Of Florida’s eight losses last 
year, only two were within four goals or fewer. The first was a 13-
11 heartbreaker at the hands of 
Georgetown. The other? A 12-11 overtime upset by Colgate.
After avenging their loss to the 
No. 13 Hoyas with a 17-10 victory at home on March 9, the Gators (6-
1) have turned their attention to 
the Raiders (3-3, 1-0).
“We want to beat them more 
than Georgetown, I feel like, be-cause we lost to them in overtime,” 
sophomore Emily Dohony said 
Saturday. 
“We want to kill them like the 
score of this game,” she added, referring to UF’s 19-4 win over 
Temple.
Colgate will come to Dizney Stadium today at 6:30 p.m. to face 
a UF team that has outscored op-
ponents by an average of nine 
goals through five of its scheduled 
nine straight home games this sea-
son. Florida split its only two road 
games so far, with 
the next coming 
April 2 at Penn 
State.
“Last year, it 
was a home game 
for them. It was our first year, and 
we weren’t really a good traveling 
team,” Dohony said. “Our heads 
weren’t in the game. This year, we have our fans, and we have our home field.”
The Raiders haven’t been keep-
ing attackers away from goal, with 
201 shots reaching their goalies this 
season. This shortcoming plays perfectly into Florida’s attack, as 
UF has outshot its opponent in 
each game this season. 
“Our defense is getting the ball 
in our attackers’ hands, and our attackers are finishing,” UF coach 
Amanda O’Leary said. “It’s a com -
bination of both, and they’re start-ing to really come together and 
blend as a team, which is exactly what you’re wanting to see head-ing into your conference play.”
O’Leary expects Colgate to use 
an offensive scheme that draws 
defenders out then dumps the ball 
within the 8-meter arc, but she said the Raiders might reveal some sur -
prises like Georgetown did with its full-field press.
“Each and every team we play is 
going to throw something different at us,” O’Leary said. “Georgetown 
threw a very different defense at us 
... so we’re going to have to play a 
much better defense as a team ver -
sus individual defense.”Gators out to avenge 2010 loss to Raiders at home

Florida coach Kevin O’Sullivan, left, said UF must simply play 
better to halt its current four-game losing streak against FSU.
By JESSE SIMONTON
Alligator Staff Writer
jsimonton@alligator.org
While the top-ranked Gators 
won’t admit they have a nemesis, 
their adversary from Tallahassee 
has certainly stepped into that role. 
The Florida-Florida State base-
ball rivalry has been particularly 
one-sided lately, as the Seminoles 
have won five of the last six meet-
ings — including four straight — and nine of the last 13.
Before No. 1 UF takes on No. 4 
FSU tonight at 7 in McKethan Sta-
dium, coach Kevin O’Sullivan will 
address the team as usual. But he doesn’t know exactly how it will go.
“If you guys have any sugges-
tions, I don’t know what to say,” O’Sullivan said. “We’ve got to play better. 
“Florida State has played bet-
ter than we have. It’s as simple as that.”
Earlier this month, the Semi-
noles (15-1) captured a 5-3 victory in their annual showdown with the 
Gators (14-2) in Tampa. In the loss, 
a familiar issue plagued Florida: its starting pitcher couldn’t slow down the FSU lineup. 
In its last five losses against FSU, 
UF’s pitching staff has sported a 5.60 ERA, but the starters have been 
putting the team in deep holes. 
In the March 1 
showdown, senior right-hander Tom-my Toledo went 
just 2.1 innings, al-
lowing three runs and five baserun-
ners. 
Highlighted by Anthony DeS-
clafani’s wretched start on March 
2, 2010, when he didn’t escape the 
first inning, Florida starters have combined to toss just nine innings with a 15.00 ERA in the five de-feats. 
Tonight, in the second of four 
meetings this year between the in-state rivals, lefty Alex Panteliodis (1-0, 4.66 ERA) will toe the rubber for his second start of the season. 
The junior came on in relief two 
weeks ago against Florida State, throwing 2.2 innings and allowing two runs.
“We’ve just got to play bet-
ter. There’s nothing more to it,” O’Sullivan said. “We’ve got to play a whole lot better than we have in the past.”
Although the Seminoles ended 
the Gators’ season in last year’s Col-lege World Series, slugger Preston Tucker said their recent struggles aren’t in the players’ heads. 
“I wouldn’t say it’s a mental 
hump,” Tucker said. “We need to put things together. We need to perform the way we know we can. 
We’ve got a really good team, and I 
think timely hitting, good pitching and good defense is going to win you ball games.”Gators look to snap skid vs. ‘Noles

 THE TWO COACHED 
TOGETHER WITH THE MIAMI DOLPHINS IN 2006.
By ADAM BERRY
Alligator Staff Writer
aberry@alligator.org
Will Muschamp has made it per -
fectly clear he doesn’t want a coach-
ing staff full of yes men at Florida. But his defensive coordinator has all the makings of a reliable right-hand 
man, and that suits the new Gators 
coach just fine.
When Florida’s spring football 
practice opens Wednesday , Dan Quinn will be installing his scheme and calling plays for the Gators, but he will work closely with the defen-sive-minded Muschamp throughout the process.
“Dan and I worked together be-
fore, so that’s kind of why we get along so well — we have a philo-
sophical belief in how you play ,” said Muschamp, who ran Auburn’s defense for two years and Texas’ for 
three before taking the job at Florida. 
“I plan on him 
calling it right now as far as what we’re doing, but I’m go-
ing to be involved. 
In my role, you play 
to your strengths, and my strength is on defense, special teams and re-cruiting.”
Quinn joins UF after 10 years in 
the NFL, having worked with Mus-champ on the Miami Dolphins staff in 2005 and most recently as the 
defensive line coach for the Seattle 
Seahawks.
The two bonded instantly due to 
their similar coaching philosophies, and they remained in contact after going their separate ways. Quinn said he would often cross paths with Muschamp at Auburn and Texas to evaluate potential NFL prospects, spending his down time visiting his former co-worker.
So, when Muschamp said there 
was an opening for a defensive co-ordinator on his staff, Quinn’s re-sponse was never in question.
“[Muschamp] had all the right 
stuff about him as a coach, and when it came to having the opportunity to work at a place like this, it really was easy for me,” Quinn said. “I had a great experience in the 
NFL, loved it and made some terrif-ic connections with players, coaches and front-office people, but it was 
just a new challenge for me and 
something I was looking forward to doing.
“I don’t know if anything can pre-
pare you for being a coordinator in the SEC without having done it, but my experience the last 10 years has prepared me to play in big games and be involved in that way.”Quinn said he hopes to turn the 
Gators into a “4-3 team with 3-4 principles,” and his philosophy falls right between rushing four linemen 
and all-out blitzing. 
He encourages versatility in all 
his players, something already evi-
dent in Ronald Powell’s switch to the “Buck” position (a hybrid defen-sive end who can fall back into zone or defend receivers), Josh Shaw’s move from cornerback to safety and Leon Orr’s transition from the offen-sive line to defensive end.
But one consistent aspect of 
Quinn’s defense is its pressure on the quarterback —  an emphasis he 
and Muschamp plan to bring to Florida this season. It may not al-ways show up as sacks in the box score, but he and Muschamp share a focus on “affecting” the quarterback on every play.
“Will and I see football a lot in the 
same way,” Quinn said. “That cown-nection is what brought me here.”

Even before the NCAA Tournament se-
lection show came to a close, the Gators were 
facing criticism for receiving a No. 2 seed. 
ESPN’s Doug Gottlieb called them the 
tournament’s “most overseeded” team, while 
Charles Barkley said Florida was overrated. 
Even some of UF’s players were surprised 
by the decision. “The two seed kind of shocked me,” se-
nior forward Chandler Parsons said. “But I 
think we deserve it. I’m happy with it.”
With the exception of Sunday’s 70-54 loss 
to Kentucky in the Southeastern Conference Tournament finals, the Gators closed the sea-son as hot as any team in the nation. 
But early season losses to Jacksonville and 
UCF were significant blemishes on an other -
wise-strong resume, and many assumed they would keep Florida off the No. 2 line. 
“I had a feeling we were going to be a three seed, honestly,” Parsons said. 
Although projected as 
a three by most prognos-ticators, coach Billy Dono-van said Florida’s No. 7 nonconference strength of schedule and 11 wins over RPI top-50 teams were 
enough to push the Gators over the top. 
SEC Commissioner and 
former member of the NCAA Tournament Se-lection Committee Mike Slive advised Dono-van that scheduling a difficult nonconference slate would be critical, and the committee is less concerned with how a team performs in the conference portion of its season. 
“I wasn’t necessarily surprised by it,” 
Donovan said. “We probably got rewarded for the whole body of work of what hap-
pened during the course of the season.”

didn’t make a difference where they were 
seeded, the No. 2 spot may have both positive and negative effects on the team’s postseason. 
While the higher seed is meant to give UF 
an easier path to the Sweet 16, it also puts a 
target on the Gators’ backs. 
“We’re going to get every team’s best shot 
because we are the two seed and a lot of peo-
ple have stuff to say about that,” sophomore guard Kenny Boynton said. “What it’s going to come down to is who wants to win the most.”
Parsons said what experts think about their 
seed is insignificant, and Florida is only fo-
cused on its next opponent. 
Boynton took a different approach, saying 
his team can be inspired by the criticism. 
“We’re going to use the most motivation 
we can,” Boynton said. “They don’t feel like 
we’re a two, so we’ll show them.”

The Florida women’s basketball team will fin-
ish its season exactly where it began: in the Na-
tional Invitation Tournament.
After being left out of the NCAA Tournament 
discussion, Florida (18-14) will host Maryland Bal-
timore County (20-11) on Friday in the O’Connell 
Center in the first round of the Women’s NIT.
Only four Southeastern Conference teams (Ten-
nessee, Kentucky, Vanderbilt and Georgia) were selected to participate in the Big Dance and, for the second straight year, the Gators were left at home. 
UF has been to three NITs and only one NCAA 
Tournament in coach Amanda Butler’s four years 
as head coach. 
Following the loss to Tennessee in the SEC 
Tournament, Butler said she felt 
her team had done enough to be 
considered for the field of 64. 
The Gators won four of their 
last five games to close out the 
season. Florida notched quality wins over Tournament teams 
Georgia, Vanderbilt and Central Florida. UF lost 
by one point to DePaul and by two points to Flori-
da State, both No. 3 seeds in the Tournament. 
UF, ranked No. 50 in RPI according to realtim-
erpi.com, finished eighth in the SEC with an 8-10 
record and played the 11th-toughest schedule in the nation. 
But eight losses in 10 games late in the SEC 
schedule, as well as losses to Brown and Hampton, likely did in the Gators’ chances.
South Carolina received the SEC’s automatic 
bid for the NIT and Florida was one of four at-large teams selected from the conference.  The SEC had just two teams in the NIT last season.
UMBC won the regular-season American East 
championship and earned an automatic bid to WNIT. The ticket prices and tip-off time have yet to be determined.Gators earn

Florida senior center fielder Bryson 
Smith has been suspended following his 
arrest late Sunday on a charge of driving under the influence.
“I am aware of the charges against 
our baseball student-athlete and we take these very seriously,” UF coach Kevin O’Sullivan said in a statement Monday . 
Smith was stopped by a Gainesville 
Police Department officer at 11:50 p.m. at 1600 NW 23rd St after the officer wit-nessed Smith make two wide turns and 
drift into the curb on 
NW 16th Avenue.
When the officer 
performed the traffic 
stop, he observed Smith swaying while standing outside of the car, according to the arrest report. He also noted Smith’s eyes were bloodshot and glassy, and there was a smell of alcohol coming from his breath.
While standing with the officer, 
Smith urinated himself, according to the report. He said he only drank one beer and was picking up a group of friends from 101 Cantina.
Smith was then arrested and trans-
ported to the Alachua County Jail, where he refused to give a breath sam-ple to the officer and was booked at 1 a.m. Monday morning.
Smith has since been released from 
the jail. Smith suspended after DUI charge

n FLORIDA’S FIRST SPRING 
SESSION IS ON WEDNESDAY.
By ANTHONY CHIANG
Alligator Staff Writer
achiang@alligator.org
One of Will Muschamp’s first deci-
sions as Florida’s head coach has been 
met with disapproval from the fans. But he isn’t letting that bother him.
Since the team announced last 
Wednesday that spring practices were going to be closed to the public and media, it has been a popular topic of discussion among those interested in the Gators.
“I have got to make a decision 
that I think is best for the program and what’s about winning football games and doing it the right way ,” Muschamp said. “Unfortunately , in my position when you do make deci-sions, you affect a whole lot of people, and there are always going to be peo-ple that don’t like the decision being made.”
Muschamp is already distancing 
himself from Urban Meyer, as Meyer never closed spring practices during his tenure at Florida.
The Gators will begin practice 
Wednesday , culminating April 9 with the Orange and Blue game, which will be open to the public.
“We need to concentrate on us 
right now,” Muschamp said. “We need to get better and continue to de-velop the identity of what we want to be as a football team on both sides of the ball and on special teams.”
POSITION CHANGES: As expected, the 
quarterback position is going to look a little different next season.
Trey Burton and Jordan Reed, who 
both saw time in the shotgun last year, are moving away from that spot.
Muschamp announced Monday 
that Reed will become a full-time tight end. Burton will focus on lin-ing up out wide and in the backfield 
in a versatile position termed F-21.
Also, Leon Orr has 
moved from offen-sive line to defensive tackle, and Gerald Christian will play 
linebacker next season, along with a little bit of fullback and tight end, his original position, in short-yardage situations.
INJURIES: Florida will be missing 
some players during spring practice.
Cornerback Janoris Jenkins (shoul-
der), running back Mike Blakely (shoulder) and linebacker Neiron Ball (congenital syndrome) will all be ab-sent from UF’s practices due to injury . Running back Jeff Demps will also 
stay off the field as he spends the se-
mester running for the track and field team. Muschamp defends

KR Andre Debose  Solomon PattonDepth ChartBefore the Gators be-
gin their 2011 spring practice season on Wednesday, take a first look at UF’s initial 
depth chart. It omits 
players missing or 
limited in the spring 
due to injuries or other 
athletic commitments, coach Will Muschamp said Monday.
Offensive coordina-
tor Charlie Weis ex-plained the chart’s de-tails, particularly the 
F-21, F-12 and F-11 
positions. The first 
number refers to how 
many players line up 
in the backfield, while the second shows the 
number of tight ends. 
For example: When 
Deonte Thompson is the F-11, UF will line up one running back, one tight end and 
three receivers.
“Instead of giving you 
some bogus depth 
chart that doesnt’ re-
ally tell you anything and just lines up with two wide receivers, we figured we would give you ... what we are thinking,” Weis said. Football
