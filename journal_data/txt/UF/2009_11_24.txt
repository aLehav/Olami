ACLU files suit defending anti-Islam shirts
By CJ PRUNER and
EMILY FUGGETTA
Alligator Writers
The American Civil Liber-
ties Union filed a federal lawsuit
Monday on behalf of the Dove
World Outreach Center claimingthe Alachua County school dis-
trict's policy against anti-Islamic
T-shirts intrudes upon the wear-
ers' freedom of speech.
The shirts, which read "Islam
is of the devil," raised controver-
sy when students were sent home
from local elementary and middleschools for wearing them.
The church's families said the
shirts are protected
Local by the Constitu-
News tion under the First
Amendment as reli-
gious expression.
Alachua County School Dis-trict spokeswoman Jackie Johnson
said the district will stand by its
decision to enforce the dress code
and prevent students from wear-
ing items that are "disruptive to
the learning environment and of-
fensive to students."
But according to ACLU ofFlorida executive director How-
ard Simon, the messages are pro-
tected under the First Amend-
ment, which the Supreme Court
has done a good job of outlining
in terms of public schools.

Student arrested for using
counterfeit bills at Moe's
A UF student was arrested and banned
from campus Sunday after police say he used
counterfeit money at a campus restaurant.
Maxime Sparfel, UF industrial and sys-
tems engineering junior, used a counterfeit
$10 bill to pay for his meal at Moe's South-
west Grill at the Student Recreation and Fit-
ness Center, according to a University Police
Department report.
After receiving his change, he asked the
cashier for two $5 bills in exchange for an-
other $10 bill.
According to the supervisor on duty at
the time, the cashier sensed something was
wrong because Sparfel was visibly nervous.
She marked the bills with a counterfeit
detection pen and showed them to her su-
pervisor, who then called UPD.Police found 15 additional $10 bills in
Sparfel's pockets and backpack, according
to the report.
All the bills had the same serial number
and failed the counterfeit bill pen test, ac-
cording to the report.
Sparfel, a French citizen, was arrested
and charged with one count of possession
of 10 or more forged bills and two counts
of passing a counterfeit bill, all third-degree
felonies.
UPD has consulted the United States Se-
cret Service, which handles counterfeiting
cases, for assistance.
Sparfel was released from the Alachua
County Jail Monday afternoon.

Food banks fight rising hunger
0 THE COUNTY PLANS TO EXPAND
LOCAL FOOD PROGRAMS.
By EMILY HANSON
Alligator Contributing Writer
Ray Howard was known as the guy with
the loud laugh by his colleagues at Santa Fe
College, where he worked as a private tutor.
To his doctors at Shands Health Care at
UF, he was known as a fighter battling brain
cancer.
And even with a college degree, he ended
up living outside an abandoned steakhouse
on Archer Road and was discovered by a po-
lice officer and former classmate.
With the economy in shambles and un-
employment rates at their highest since theearly 1980s, the face of hunger is changing in
Alachua County.
The faces are starting to look more like
Howard's.
"The problem is that food is
harder to get."
Anne Voyles
Bread of the Mighty Food Bank director
The hungry include educated citizens with
homes and families caught in an economic
rip current that haven't yet made it to shore.
Alachua County has published a plan to
reduce hunger that includes ideas like ex-
panding the customer service capabilities
of emergency food programs, increasing the

up and go to work
for one of the larg-
est, most-respected
public universities
in the country -
filled with students
who infuse this
campus with their Paula Varnes

The University of Florida
carillon is nestled atop perhaps
one of the most iconic sites
on campus, Century Tower.
The carillon's bells and chimes
resonate throughout campus
when played by live performers
at 12:35 p.m. each weekday, and
by an automated system at each
quarter hour.
In its 30 years at UF the
carillon has transitioned from
the center of controversy to a
cherished campus icon.
At the carillon's dedica-
tion in 1979, numerous
protesters disputed the
use of student funds for UFs Centurythe instrument. Hand-. Tower is Jill Mendoza (left) and Dani Gretz play aheld signs read Educaton, 157-feet tall. duet on the carillon. The keyboard wires
students marched near Century pull on clappers, striking the bells just
Tower. above the performers.
The sound of the carillon is now an integral part of campus life. It is as much an icon as the tower
that houses it.
Dani Gretz, sophomore biology major, is a member of the carillon studio, which consists of eight
students who play the afternoon programs. She said the studio plays each day so the campus com-
munity can be involved and listen to the carillon.
"The carillon and its music is an icon of UF's campus because it is a big part of UF's history,"
Gretz said.
A carillon is a European instrument with a minimum of 23 bells and at least two octaves. UF's
carillon consists of 61 bells and five octaves, and is among the largest university carillons in North
America. It is played on a keyboard from the tower's 11 h story in a small, dimly lit room just below
the bell chamber.
After Thanksgiving break, listen for holiday carols ringing from the tower as Laura Ellis, associate
professor of music, or a member of the carillon studio plays the 12:35 p.m. program each weekday.
A member of the studio will play holiday music prior to the UF College of Fine Arts School of
Music's annual Sounds of the Seasons program on Dec. 6. The carillon recital at 3 p.m. on Dec. 13
also will include holiday melodies.
Ellis said, "There are not that many universities that have carillons. I think that in itself makes
UF stand within a unique crowd."

Local artist turns hobby into career after injury
* HUDSON LEARNED TO
CARVE WHEN HE WAS A
MERCHANT MARINER.
By CLARE LENNON
Alligator Contributing Writer
With his brown hair, gray sweat-
shirt and Philadelphia Eagles base-
ball cap, Pete Hudson seems like any
other guy. He lives in Gainesville
and calls himself a Gators fan.
He also has two titanium cages,
two rods and six screws in his back
-a setback Hudson used to propel
a hobby into a new career.
Hudson is an artist who carves
wood into figurines and has re-
cently decided to carve a niche in
the Gainesville market by creating
wooden alligators.
Hudson had to give up his long-
time job as a merchant mariner be-
cause of an accident, during which
he broke his back when he was
hauling debris from the Sept. 11 at-
tacks on a barge in January 2002.
"Ruined my whole life, just like
that, because someone wouldn't
take five minutes to tighten a nut,"
he said. "It's crazy."
While he was confined to a walk-
er between the accident and his
2003 surgery, Hudson would sit in
his garage and carve wood.
He originally picked it up from
the captain of one of the ships he
worked on with the merchant ma-
rines.
Hudson said that after watching
the captain carve ducks with just aknife and Dremel, he began carving
in his early 30s.
"I started doing fish, then whales
and bullnosed dolphins, then tur-
tles," he said.
The Hudson family moved to
Gainesville in May 2008, and this
past October, Pete Hudson carved
his first alligator head at the sugges-
tion of his son Matt. It is currently
on display and will be raffled off at
Tutoring Zone.
Meanwhile, Hudson is workingon two smaller alligator heads and
said he has a customer who wants a
set of three for Christmas. Like the
carving that is already finished, the
set will include a Florida State Sem-
inoles spear snapped in half inside
the gator's mouth.
"It's all been word of mouth,"
said Hudson, who also paints sea-
side scenes and repairs and refin-
ishes antique furniture. "I can't
show you any of my pieces because
they've all sold. They're all over."
Emily Fuggetta / Alligator Staff
Wood artist Pete Hudson, 54, sits in his outdoor workshop where he cre-
ates wooden alligator sculptures.Hudson hopes to turn his carv-
ings into a steady business.
"I'd like to see my e-mail light
up. That would make my day," he
said.
"It keeps him busy, and it also
adds to our income," said his wife,
Judy, noting that her husband's only
regular income right now comes
from disability checks because of
his injury.
"I went from making in a week
what I make in a month, and it
hurts," Hudson said of his injury.
He plans to keep carving and
hopes people will become interest-
ed in his work.
The couple has showcased the
pieces at craft fairs in Satellite
Beach and plans to start attending
art shows in Gainesville, he said.
"I do enjoy doing it, especially
now that we're starting to get a
change in the weather. It's nice,"
said Hudson.
He said he enjoys when his
16-year-old daughter, Katie, helps
him sand or perfect details like the
gators' teeth.
Judy said the couple have dis-
cussed building a workshop for
Hudson if business picks up. Hud-
son set up a Web site for his work,
www.gatorgrowlcarvings.com, and
encourages anyone interested to e-
mail him at pghudsonl3@yahoo.
com.
"I'll carve anything," Hudson
said. "I'd like to do a whole gator."

Jazz Spiritual Lounge combines music and God
By JOEY FLECHAS
Alligator Contributing Writer
Under the colored lights of
the Orange & Brew stage, Nilson
Ramirez told a crowd of about
50 that he still loved his second-
grade teacher.
"If God chose tonight to bleach
my life, she would still be the
highlight of it," he pined.
The UF junior recited a self-
penned, semi-serious poem about
love and education as part of UF
Campus Advent's first annual
Spiritual Jazz Lounge.
Campus Advent is a student
group associated with the Sev-
enth-Day Adventist church.
According to master of cer-
emonies Paola Ortega, the show
was about combining an open mic
atmosphere and a God-centered
message.
"We just wanted to have a way
for people to express their God-
given talents," she said.
UF junior and Jazz Lounge or-
ganizer Lecelle Clarke said that as
a huge fan of jazz and its artistic
approach, she thought it would be
a creative way of getting Campus
Advent's name out there.Performers were recruited by
a committee of Campus Advent
members, with one criterion at the
center of the process.
"It had to be a positive mes-
sage," Clarke said.
Ramirez recited two poems,
the aforementioned ballad about
his unrequited love for one Ms.
De Leon and another about grow-
ing up with his mother's caring
love.
"Our purpose is to minister
and be able to reach out to
students."
Paola Ortega
master of ceremonies
An a capella hymn, two Spanish
guitar solos and a Gospel-infused
saxophone solo kept the night
moving, as audience members
raised their hands and snapped
their fingers to show their appre-
ciation.
Ortega was happy that the
night fit right in with the idea of
Campus Advent.
"Our purpose is to minister
and be able to reach out to stu-
dents," she said.
About 27,000 in county get food stamps
FOOD BANK, from page 1
amount of healthy food available in assis-
tance programs and educating the commu-
nity about the government programs.
John Skelly, Alachua County's Poverty Re-
duction Program director, said about 27,000
people in the county already receive food
stamps as part of the Supplemental Nutri-
tion Assistance Program. He estimates that
number is only one-third of the people who
qualify.
Skelly said government programs are just
a Band-Aid for the problem.
"Charity is filling in the gap where there's
a lack of justice," he said.
Bread of the Mighty Food Bank is a food
pantry trying to fill that gap.
"The problem is that food is harder to get,"
said Anne Voyles, the director of Bread of the
Mighty Food Bank.
She said that during this time of year, with
Thanksgiving and Christmas approaching,
the charity receives a large amount of per-
sonal donations.The organization tries to help about 400
people on Thanksgiving Day but can't always
feed the largest amount of people possible be-
cause it has to save food for regular days too.
Bread of the Mighty Food Bank also helps
smaller groups with their own Thanksgiving
meal projects.
"Everybody wants something to be thank-
ful for," she said.
Voyles said she gets calls
Local from people who have never had
News to ask for help before.
When callers ask her to for-
give them, she said she reminds them that
one day they will be back on their feet and
can return the favor.
It could be someone like Howard, who
spent four months living on the street, suffer-
ing from seizures caused by his brain cancer
and eating only by the kindness of strangers.
"To be on the other end of that is quite a
wake-up call," he said.
"If there's anything I learned from being
homeless, it would be that you don't give up
when you're in a bad situation."Magazine gives law
school 'super' ranking
* UFS LAW SCHOOL RANKS
EIGHTH NATIONALLY.
UF has produced a lot of Super
Lawyers in its day, but they don't
wear capes.
Law & Politics magazine re-
cently released law school rank-
ings based on the number of high-
caliber lawyers, or Super Lawyers,
produced.
UF's Levin College of Law
placed eighth overall nationally,
fourth among public schools and
first in Florida.
Nationally, UF's law school beat
those at Yale University, Boston
University, Boston College, CornellUniversity, UCLA, Stanford Uni-
versity and Duke University.
In order to be nominated as a
Super Lawyer, lawyers undergo
a vigorous selection process. The
candidates are formally nominated
by other lawyers.
After a candidate is nominated,
he or she is added to the pool of
potential winners and evaluated
by the Law & Politics research de-
partment. Following the research
phase, candidates are evaluated by
their peers.
Robert Jerry, dean of UF's Levin
College of Law, believes the rank-
ing is a testimony to the students
and professors at the college.

Editorial
Preachy Keen
ACLU is right to defend
church's freedom of speechWhen the Dove World Outreach Center, a local church,
chose its name, the story of Noah must have come to
mind.
After the great flood, Noah released a dove, which returned
carrying an olive branch, revealing that somewhere there was
land. The dove has since symbolized peace.
But don't let this church fool you -its message is not even
close to one of peace. On the contrary, it was probably another
part of the flood story that attracted this church to its name-
sake: the drowning death of the wicked, corrupt masses.
Yes, this church hate-group doesn't stick to run-of-the-mill
Internet hate speeches. You know, the tried and tested (yet
somehow consistently vile) "Abortion is murder, homosexu-
ality is sin" stuff. That's certainly part of the church's platform,
but they take their mission to "preach and challenge" to an
entirely different level.
The church's Web site plainly states that followers must
"take a stand against Islam," which is actively "leading people
to hell." They encourage all Christians to take this message
directly to the people (and the sinners).
Which is exactly what some church members did at a
Gainesville high school football game in early October. Along
with their children, these weekend crusaders wore matching
shirts that read "Islam is of the devil." School officials and po-
lice, understandably perturbed by this visible hate speech, de-
manded that the parents and students leave school property.
Unfortunately, this is a somewhat familiar story. But some-
thing is missing.
Enter the ACLU.
Not those whiners, you might be saying to yourself. The
same thought crossed some minds here at the Alligator.
Now, we hate hate-speech, probably more than these pho-
ny "Christians" hate people with different beliefs.
But we were (somewhat reluctantly) pleased to hear that
the ACLU filed a federal lawsuit on Monday on behalf of
the church. The suit claims that the school intruded on these
crusaders' freedom of speech when it removed them from
the football game. The suit also seeks to reverse the Alachua
County School District's decision to bring disciplinary action
against students who wear similar shirts to school.
How can the Alligator defend this hate-mongering, espe-
cially when the church seeks to send its message out on the
chests of children?
We can, and we must, because without absolute freedom of
speech, we might not be able to call the Dove World Outreach
Center a bunch of crazy assholes.
Were it not for the freedom of the press and other freedoms
we enjoy as Americans, we might not have the opportunity to
share views about this church or other contentious issues.
The First Amendment is designed to protect the thoughts
and opinions of everyone, and by necessity, it must include
those fringe elements of society that we all wish would just
shut up.
While we doubt the church will be successful in its efforts
to spread its message through the schools, as the Supreme
Court has routinely ruled that students give up many rights
when entering school doors, we defend their right to do so.
Further, we applaud the ACLU for taking on the difficult job
of representing them.
The Alligator supports civil dialog, controversial discourse,
and downright belligerent argument (we especially like argu-
ments), even when we painfully disagree with others' view-
points.
So don't censor the hate-groups. Just hate them back -
publicly.

Holidays create 'Garden State moments'
or many first years, the Thanksgiving holiday isthe first real opportunity in the semester to go back
home. And thus, it's often the first real opportunity
to have what I call a "Garden State moment."
An obligatory disclaimer: Even after the post-"indie flick
becomes popular" backlash and the trendy hate for Zach
Braff, I still unabashedly love the movie "Garden State," and
it still means a lot to me. I know that doesn't make me unique
-at least half of your friends born between 1986 and 1991
probably feel the same way.
One of the more resonant scenes in the movie for me is
when Zach Braff's character talks about the point in your life
when you realize that "the house you grew up in isn't reallyyour home anymore." And that's the Garden State moment
-the moment you feel that something with which you grew
up that seemed so significant, comforting or protective just
isn't all that relevant to your life anymore.
That can certainly involve your home. Living away in
your own place (even if "your own place" is a tiny dorm
room lined with Tila Tequila posters) creates a reasonably
close approximation of being all grown-up and independent
(even if you're not paying your own cell phone bill). The feel-
ing of going back home can resemble that of going back to
your old high school after graduating: It's familiar and nice,
but it seems like it's an artifact from your personal history.
You might not even take off your shoes at the front door.
But more often than not, Garden State moments involve
seeing your friends for the first time back home and won-
dering if they're still relevant to your life -or if you're still
relevant to theirs.
It sneaks up on you -you call your old circle of friends
from high school and figure out who's coming home for
Thanksgiving break, and you make plans to hang out, just
like back in the old days. Then something goes awry.
You might try to recreate an old tradition -Friday movie
night, followed by midnight bowling -only to find yourselfJoe Dellosa
ietters@a iigator orgwondering why you thought this was
fun enough of an idea to do this every
damn week during senior year as you
halfheartedly chuck your bowling ball
down the lane with a plastered-on
smile.
Or you might grab some coffee with
a friend with whom you've always
had long, meaningful conversations,
only to discover that the only things
you have to talk about are memories that you've hashed and
rehashed several dozen times -in the same conversation.
Or you're just hanging out with your best friend as they
talk about their college experiences and how many cool, new
people they've met, and you realize, with creeping minor
horror, that they've kind of moved on from their old life and,
despite their insistence to the contrary, you're not their favor-
ite friend anymore.
Or, you know, none of this could happen and you'll have
a really nice holiday catching up with some good buddies.
But Garden State moments do happen, and it can be a
really awful feeling when they do. Nobody usually expects
to be someone's best friend forever, but the hazy phase of
quasi-adulthood can be intimidating enough without having
to go through it in the middle of an uncertain economy and
an unsure future. Old friends are supposed to offer stabil-
ity in unstable times, and the notion of friendships becoming
vestigial -"being friends only because we're friends" -can
be scary.
It's very easy for a friend to slip out of relevance -time
and geography has a way of doing that -but fighting to
protect a friendship means finding new relevance if it's there,
and, appropriately enough, being thankful for what the
friendship was if it's not.

Letters to the Editor
Dems should be cautious with reform
Thank you, Editorial Board, for writing the
"Party Poopers" editorial in Monday's paper.
You were dead on. Those stupid, cautionary
senators, Ben Nelson and Joe Lieberman, need
to keep their mouths shut so we liberals can
ram through health care legislation we think
is appropriate. If any Democrat questions
whether it's financially sound, screw 'em!
They can join those loser Republicans, who
for eight years got to be fiscally irresponsible.
Well, now it's our time, damn it. Who cares if
we're in a recession?
For all you moderate Democrats out there,
or you Liebermanites, you're Judases for not
wanting the government to take control of the
health care industry, like it took over the auto-
mobile industry or the banks. Get out of our
way, because we won't stop until government
controls everything.

Many Christians share liberal values
This is in response to Monday's article, "UF
study shows religious left more active." I am
glad that someone has finally said something.
I have been waiting to hear this for a long time.
It is true that not all Christians are Republican.
Many of the Christian students I know are
conservative when it pertains to issues such as
abortion and gay marriage but are as interested
or more in historically liberal-leaning causes,
such as better health care and education for
this nation's poor. One of the Ten Command-
ments is "Thou shall not kill." I believe there
are other ways to kill that are just as important
as the abortion issue, ways that are completely
ignored in the Republican arena.
There is a tendency in the popular media to
link all Christians under a conservative Repub-
lican banner. Conservative Democrats have al-
ways existed and now, due to the health care
debate, are called by name.
There is something inherently wrong with
claiming to be a Christian and supporting
abortion and gay marriage. But there is also
something inherently wrong with being a
Christian and not recognizing other social ills
that kill Americans. I believe the latter ideal is
what college students identify with more.

Regulation should be left to states
This is in response to Monday's editorial
about the Environmental Protection Agencyand nutrient limits for Florida's rivers and
lakes. In case you didn't know, FDEP (the
Florida Department of Environmental Protec-
tion) has passed down this year nutrient limits
for nitrogen and phosphorus present in Flori-
da waterways like the St. Johns River.
The goal is, of course, to reduce the very
algae blooms of which you speak.
So this is not some problem that no one is
taking care of. This is a state issue being han-
dled by a state agency. Why are you looking to
get the EPA involved in Florida's waterways
when the Florida Department of Environmen-
tal Protection is already there?

US must engage Cuba to spark change
This letter is in response to Dayme San-
chez's recent opinion piece, "Cuban embargo
should remain in place."
While Sanchez's historical facts are well-
documented, her support for the Cuban em-
bargo draws upon questionable analysis.
First off, Sanchez argues that lifting the em-
bargo would be the equivalent of supporting
Cuba's numerous human rights violations.
However, as can be seen in the case of U.S.
diplomatic overtures to China and the former
Soviet Union, simply opening diplomatic
and economic channels with another country
does not mean the United States supports said
country's ethical shortcomings. If the United
States were to base all of its foreign policy pre-
rogatives on a regime's adherence to moral
principles, our nation might as well slap em-
bargos on 80 percent of its trade partners.
We must also pay attention to the fact that
the Castro regime has lasted long after the
collapse of its largest benefactor, the Soviet
Union. While Cuba's economy has undoubt-
edly suffered as a result, the continued per-
sistence of the Castro regime is a testament to
its ability to draw upon the strong feelings of
anti-Americanism that run deep in the minds
of Cuba's population.
So long as the embargo is in place, the
United States cannot expect Cuba to change
its opinion.
Only through a policy of engagement can
the United States hope to foster better relations
with its island neighbor. Consistently ignoring
more than 11 million Cuban citizens right on
our doorstep is a fallacy that has persisted for
far too long.
Recognizing the Castro regime's existence
as the current authority in Cuba is the first
step to acknowledging a hard-to-swallow, but
nonetheless present, reality. That acknowledg-ment, however, does not imply moral callous-
ness on our part. We remain committed to our
principles, but we cannot hope to spread those
values by overlooking every nation that has
slighted us in the past. The United States, after
all, is too mature to cut off relations with an-
other country just because it doesn't like that
country's government.
Ultimately, supporters of the Cuban em-
bargo want it both ways. They wish to see
domestic change within Cuba, yet at the same
time they are unwilling to acknowledge the
necessary steps the United States must take to
help foster that goal.
So long as we treat diplomatic recognition
of Cuba as anathema, then Cuba's unfavor-
able opinion of the United States will continue
in perpetuity. So long as that feeling survives,
Cuba will never see any need for reform, and
any progress we may hope to have with our
neighbor will remain in stasis.

People in spotlight face more scrutiny
In response to Nicole Martingano's letter
yesterday, I can only say that I wholehearted-
ly agree that anyone can be a drunken driver.
After all, the first thing you learn in driver's ed
is how the immediate effect of alcohol is not
the slight dizziness so many students seem to
enjoy, but the lack of judgment. (Drunken tex-
ting, anyone?)
If you choose to be in the spotlight in good
times, however, prepare to be in the spotlight
in bad times as well. Kristen Gillis knew, better
than anyone, the responsibilities and obliga-
tions for which the Student Body elected her.
Asking for her case to get the same attention
(or lack of) as any "regular" student is like ask-
ing Fox News not to demonize Obama were
he to be found drunken driving, even though
he represents us all as a country.
Furthermore, if you choose to campaign
against drunken driving, or any other cause,
make sure you practice what you preach, or
face the consequences. Regarding Martin-
gano's claim that UF doesn't have enough
amazing students like her friend: I completely
disagree. I have only been here for one semes-
ter, yet I have met so many people that make
me smile every time I see them. Just because
you are a Greek "celebrity" on campus or you
publicly announce how dedicated you are to a
cause doesn't make you better than everybody
else. On the contrary, humility is a value that is
rather lacking nowadays.
Michel Schoemaker
UFphysics freshmanUF should spend on education, not pride
With the current stimulus plan showing
few signs of creating real economic stability,
maybe the leaders of the free world should
take a look back a few centuries.
In 1790 Edmund Burke's scathing attack on
the French Revolution ignited what would be-
come centuries of debate.
He argued the justification for wealth was
found through the hope it brought to the
poor.
More than 200 years later, the same ideas
hold true.
UF, which is just one of the many univer-
sities struggling with severe budgetary con-
straints due to the economic downturn, has
plans to plug $70 million to $80 million into
the Reitz Union for an "expansion/renova-
tion" project.
Though funded by Student Government,
the administration fully supports the measure,
which will likely charge students a fee in order
to cover around $56 million of the cost. Back
track to pre-Revolutionary France -Burke
argued that large and commanding cathedrals
emphasized the hope of a better tomorrow for
those in the streets, and it further served to sig-
nify to the nobles that they had an up-to-par
partner in government.
In Burke's world, this translates roughly
into the following:
The university playing the role of the cler-
gy -the students as the paupers, and the 46
schools ranked higher than UF as the nobility.
Status is as still as big a part of our world as
it was in Burke's, just as universal in nature as
the principle of inevitable inequality.
Therefore, if renovating a building, regard-
less if there is real need or not, regardless of a
hiring freeze, regardless of creating a new stu-
dent fee, regardless of the recent hike in tuition
cost -if the building increases pride, power
or prestige -build it.
Now, in an age of debt and deficits, the
stimulus funds given to state universities may
be seen by some as "free" money.
But -and nothing but respect toward
Burke -if that same institution is forced to
lay off professors and cut tens of millions of
dollars from the budget, and if that same in-
stitution strives to produce students with civic
responsibility to have a positive impact on so-
ciety, maybe it is sending the wrong message
by spending money on pride rather than edu-
cational tools with tax dollars.
Then again, perhaps it is only fair to spend
money obtained by fiscally irresponsible
means on fiscally irresponsible things.

Jones says other churches
should follow Dove's lead
SUIT, from page 1
sex or drugs," he said. "It's
about [the students'] views on
politics, religion and history."
Simon said the district's de-
cision to forbid the students
from wearing the shirts crosses
a line that shouldn't be set by
the school system, which is al-
lowed to forbid certain clothing
based on its offensiveness.
He said if every school re-
stricted freedom of speech
based on offending others, the
freedom wouldn't exist.
Simon said the students
were not sent home from
school the first day they wore
the shirts because there was no
disruption, but the schools lat-
er decided to forbid the shirts
because of their message.
While the shirts' message
is distressing, Simon said,
their appearance should have
sparked school-wide discus-sions about religion and poli-
tics, being used as a learning
tool.
"Rather than restricting
speech," he said, "it should
have opened the door to more
speech."
A spokesperson from the
DWOC declined to comment
on the case but referred to a
statement from the Rev. Terry
Jones, the church's senior pas-
tor.
"What we are doing is what
every church should be doing,"
part of the statement from
Jones reads, "but the churches
in America and in Gainesville
have become cowardly. The
church's job is to stand up and
speak out on issues. .and warn
against false religions like Is-
lam that masquerades itself as
a religion of peace. Their desire
is to destroy America, Israel
and western civilization and to
institute Islamic law."t r

Meyer squashes N
By BOBBY CALLOVI
Alligator Staff Writer
bcallovi@alligator org
Notre Dame coach Charlie
Weis' future has not been decided
yet, but the rumors of the Fighting
Irish planning to try to get Florida
coach Urban Meyer to replace him
have already started swirling.
Notre Dame is 6-5, bringing
Weis' overall record to 35-26, and
many believe he will be fired at
the end of the season.
Meyer was an assistant coach
at Notre Dame from 1996-2000
and was a candidate for the job in
2005 before deciding to come to
Gainesville.
He has also said Notre Dame
was his dream job.
Meyer was quick to put the ru-
mors to rest when asked about it
Monday.
"I'm ready to dispel those,"
Meyer said. "I'm going to be the
coach at Florida as long as they'll
have me, so I'll make that clear."
Senior quarterback Tim Tebow
said he did not think Meyer had
any interest in leaving Florida.
MEYER'S SUCCESSOR: While Mey-
er has made it known he plans on
Home losses
t's finally time to say goodbye.
Tim Tebow will be making
his 21st and final start inside The
Swamp on Saturday.
Ben Hill Griffin Stadium has been
mostly a place of refuge for the face
of college football. He has walked off
a loser only twice, but it was those
times that he fell short that meant
most to Tebow's career.
Each blemish led to moments of
greatness.
The 20-17 defeat to Auburn in 2007,
Tebow's first loss as a starter, showed
the first chink in No. 15's armor. The
then-sophomore of an undefeated
team had the ball in a tied game with
4:49 left. The next three plays were
an incompletion, option to Kestahn
Moore for no gain and an incomple-
tion. The Gators punted and the Ti-
gers marched down the field, runningstaying at UF for a while, he may
have already started picking his
replacement when he does decide
to leave Florida.
He hopes two of the seniors
that will be playing in their last
games in The Swamp on Saturday
will eventually return to coach
their alma mater.
"Tebow or (redshirt senior
linebacker Ryan) Stamper, I guess,
will someday lead this program,"
Meyer said. "That's
every coach's dream
to come in, make it
a little better andFootball just leave it in good
shape and leave it
to someone who will carry on."
He also said junior defensive
end Justin Trattou would make a
great coach.
Tebow said that future in-
trigues him, and he would not
shut the door on a coaching ca-
reer.
REMEMBERING GUILFORD: Dur-
ing Monday's press conference,
Meyer had to pause several times
to fight back tears when talking
about his departing senior class.

Gators take seventh at NCAAs
By JESSICA ETTER
Alligator Writer
The Florida women's cross country team
achieved its preseason goal Monday but left
the NCAA Championships less than satisfied.
The No. 5 Gators finished a school-record
seventh out of 31 teams in Terre Haute, Ind.
It was UF's first top-10 finish at the national
race in the program's 30-year history, but the
team's 260 points were less than 10 shy of a
top-five finish. Sixth-place finisher West Vir-
ginia had 259 points and fifth-place Princeton
had 251.
Coach Todd Morgan said being so close to
a top-five finish was bittersweet.
"The girls left the course today a little ir-
ritated," Morgan said. "We plan on coming
back here next year and doing even better."
Redshirt sophomore Rebecca Lowe (14th,
20:19) and junior Charlotte Browning (19th,
20:26) led the way, earning Florida's first All-
America honors since Becki Wells in 1995.

"It's phenomenal for these girls who

slipped to 7-4 on the season. Still, no one

UF MEN'S BASKETBALL
Gators look to snap streak
By ADAM BERRY
Alligator Staff Writer
a berry@alligator org
Florida isn't spending too much time wor-
rying about the garnet-and-gold monkey on its
back.
UF (3-0) has dropped three straight match-
ups against Florida State (3-0), and no player
on the Gators roster has walked off the court
in his college career with a victory against the
Seminoles. Even Florida's second national
championship team lost to FSU, falling 70-66 in
Tallahassee in 2006.
But when the teams square off in the
O'Connell Center tonight at 7, the rivalry's re-
cent history will be far from the Gators' minds.
"This is a whole new team from last year.
They've got a different team," sophomore
point guard Erving Walker said. "The streak
really don't mean nothing. Both teams are to-
tally different, so it's 0-0 for us."
FSU returns three starters from the team
that beat UF 57-55 last year in Tallahassee, but
with a renewed commitment to defense and
some new personnel, UF has already proven to
be different this season than it was last year.
"To me, anything that has happened in the
past is over with and has no bearing on how
we go out and perform," UF coach Billy Dono-
van said. "That's the beauty about competition.
Anytime you line up and play, what happened
previously has nothing to do with what's in
front of you."
Instead of looking back on previous years,
Donovan and his team have spent most of their
time preparing for FSU's big men. With their
projected starting frontcourt standing 6-foot-
8, 6-foot-9 and 7-foot-1, the Seminoles are a
matchup problem for nearly every team theyface.
FSU center Solomon Alabi in particular
will present a new challenge to Florida's post
players, especially centers Vernon Macklin and
Kenny Kadji, who have yet to face a player
down low like the Seminoles 7-footer.
Alabi is averaging 12.3 points, 6.3 rebounds
and three blocks while playing just more than
20 minutes per game.
"We have some guys who can hopefully
match up. We don't have anybody the size of
those guys or the length of those guys, but nei-
ther do most teams in the country," Donovan
said. "It's not like we're drastically undersized
playing against them. I think most teams that
play against FSU are going to be drastically un-
dersized."
INJURY UPDATE: Donovan said Alex Tyus
will likely play against FSU after suffering
a sprained ankle in UF's 80-58 win against
Troy on Friday night. The junior power for-
ward practiced Sunday with no contact but
returned to full-contact practice Monday.
Chandler Parsons'injury is a more pressing
concern for the Gators. The junior forward suf-
fered a hip flexor strain against Troy and did
not practice Sunday or Monday.
Parsons has been a spark off the bench for
UF this season, averaging 14.7 points and a
team-leading 8.3 rebounds per game.
"My gut feeling is he's going to want to
play, regardless," Donovan said. "How effec-
tive is he and where he's at while he's playing,
I don't know where that is, but I think he'll be
cleared to play. Just I don't know what we'll be
able to get out of him, missing two days.
"We can still do different things offensively
and defensively if he's not able to go or if he's
not 100 percent."L IW f32

UF center Vernon Macklin will face his biggest challenge so far this season when
Florida State comes to town. The Seminoles boast three players at least 6-foot-8.
UF will wear new Nike Pro Combat uniform vs. FSU

moments was when former Gator Michael Guilford was
brought up.
Guilford, who died in a motorcycle accident on Oct. 12,
2007, would have been a senior this year.
The walk-on was most well known for acting as former
Ohio State quarterback Troy Smith on the scout team prior
to the 2006 BCS National Championship Game.
Meyer said he will be honored during Senior Day
against FSU on Saturday.
"We're going to invite his family down, and he's still
part of this group," Meyer said.
"You love the jersey that you played in your
last four years. But also you're going to have
a new jersey, and it will be something that's
cool and special to this one game."] -I Tim Tebow

NEW UNIFORMS: In their last game in The Swamp, the
Gators' seniors will not be wearing the uniforms they have
worn for almost every game of their college careers.
Instead, UF will be wearing the Nike Pro Combat uni-
form, which is being described as the lightest football uni-
form Nike has ever created.
The new uniforms were unveiled before the FIU game.
Florida joins Clemson, FSU, LSU, Miami, Virginia Tech,
Missouri, Ohio State, Oklahoma and TCU in debuting the
new Nike uniforms this season.
The Gators' future jerseys will be made out of the mate-
rial used in the special uniforms Saturday, but they will
-, reflect the traditional Florida uniforms.

Florida looks to get off to better start against UAB
* THE GATORS ARE COMING
OFF BACK-TO-BACK LOSSES.
By EUGENIO TORRENS
Alligator Staff Writer
etorrens@alligator org
It may be early in the season,
but the Florida women's basket-
ball team is using its performance
in Pittsburgh, an 81-58 loss on
Friday, as a wake-up call.
While it wasn't a make-or-
break game, the loss dropped the
Gators to 1-2 on the season, and
players and coaches are not go-
ing to completely disregard it.
"You have to stress the se-
riousness of the situation.
If it's not corrected, you
could spiral (downward)."
Susan Yenser
UF senior guard
"You have to stress the seri-
ousness of the situation," senior
Susan Yenser said. "If it's not cor-
rected, you could spiral (down-
ward)."
When UF hosts UAB today at
4:30 p.m., the Gators will be hop-
ing to find the effort and inten-
sity missing against the Panthers.
They hope the pair of intangibles
can help them get off to a better
start.
"We didn't come out with the
same intensity we had at the FSUgame," freshman Jennifer George
said. "We all know that we can't
come out like that again. Nothing
explains why we came out like
that."tempo on defense against the
Panthers, struggling to generate
offense through steals and fast-
break points. Florida forced just
12 turnovers and finished with
The Gators failed to set the only five fast-break points."The starting five got out there
and didn't set the tone," Yenser
said. "That's still no excuse. Even
the people on the bench have to
be ready to come in and be the
tone-changers if we have to be."
UF guard Susan Yenser has gone 4 of 7 from beyond the arc, making her the team's second-best long-
range threat so far behind Sharielle Smith. Florida is making just 31 percent of its three-pointers.Coach Amanda Butler
pointed out how the defense
has been impacted by the
way the team plays offense.
Lately, that hasn't been a good
thing.
Shooting a combined 39 per-
cent from the field in its last two
games and a worse-than-expected
33 percent from the 3-point line
in those two contests, the offense
has been unable to put points on
the board.
Butler said that may have
been a reason for the lax defense
against Pittsburgh.
"You become more distracted
by the fact that the ball isn't go-
ing through the hole as opposed
to refocusing your energy and
going 'OK, the ball isn't going
through the hole, let's buckle
down and play some defense,"'
Butler said.
The Gators may find getting
buckets a bit easier back at home
against a UAB team that doesn't
boast the frontcourt prowess of
FSU and Pittsburgh. If Florida
can establish a more formidable
post game, that will take some of
the pressure off the guards and
the perimeter shooting.
"It'll be nice when we finally
experience that game when we're
finally shooting to our potential,"
Yenser said. "Until then, we can't
let it bother us. We can't let our
shooting dictate our intensity or
our demeanor."
UF SWIMMING
Gators host Seminoles in rematch
By TONI-ANN MILLER
Alligator Writer
This past weekend, Florida
battled seven teams in the three-
day Georgia Tech Invitational. The
Gators left Atlanta with a bitter taste
in their mouths when both men's
and women's teams came up short
behind Florida State.
The No. 4 men fell 1055-787, and
the No. 5 women lost 977.5-933.5.
Both teams traveled back to
Gainesville on Sunday, and with just
one day off from competition, the
Gators will get another shot at the
Seminoles in a one-on-one matchup
in the O'Connell Center today.
The meet will serve as an unoffi-
cial kickoff to a trio ofUF-FSUbattles
in Gainesville this week, as it is the
first of three different sports match-
ups (swimming, basketball and
football) between the two schools.
But make no mistake, the rivalry inthe pool is just as intense as it is in
the other sports.
"There's no love loss," coach
Gregg Troy said. "About four years
ago we lost a dual meet to them; no
one was happy.
They came back
the next year, and
we had the house
filled-up here, and
we put a shellack-
ing on them."
Troy said that
because some
of UF's athletes
have ties to FSU, there is an added
element to the meet.
"It's always good to swim them,"
he said. "We have a couple kids on
our team whose parents swam at
FSU, and they chose to be Gators
instead, so it always adds a little dif-
ferent dynamic."
He added that taking on FSU
would be good competition at thispoint in the season, and that he ex-
pects the meet to go down to the fi-
nal relay.
UF senior Roberto Gomez said
the opportunity to compete against
FSU so soon after the loss at Georgia
Tech gives UF a chance to work on
some things the team didn't do right
and that the lack of time between the
matchups would not be a factor.
"If anything, we'll be better,"
Gomez said. "It will be like a five-
day meet, with one day when you
don't have to swim."
Gomez said the team feels pretty
confident going into the meet, even
after the result they had just two
days ago.
It is possible that UF has moved
passed the loss in Georgia and is
looking forward to today's chal-
lenge, but one can only expect that
Sunday's result will only fuel the
Gators and enhance the competition
between these two perpetual foes.
UFs strong finish will help recruiting for next year
CROSS COUNTRY, from page 13
The team never finished worse than seventh this
year and won three times.
Looking ahead to next season, the Gators anticipate
finishing with better results than this year.
As of right now, the women's team will only lose

and again he delivered. Leading by three with 9:59 left, Florida
went 76 yards in 11 plays and ate up 6:52 off the clock. On the
Gators'next possession, Tebow ran out the clock.
Against Arkansas this year, he led a 14-play, 69-yard drive
to set up Caleb Sturgis' game-winning field goal. He ran or
threw the ball on all but two plays.
The 31-30 loss to Ole Miss in 2008 was not Tebow's fault, but
he came up short on the game-ending fourth and 1. He uttered
The Promise after the game, a moment that was so shocking yet
underwhelming that while covering it live, I had no idea I had
watched history.
Twenty-one games later, Florida still hasn't lost.
In two years of covering him and four years of watching
him, that's the thing that has stuck out most about Tebow -
his will to win. Nothing eats at him more.
It sounds unfathomably corny. That makes it no less true.
Now as he wraps up his time in Gainesville, he is in the
midst of his worst year as a starter. Florida has, at times, won
despite Tebow. The Gators' defense erases errors and gives the
offense a safety net.
He has likely erased all chances of being the best college
football player of all time in my book. That doesn't make him
any less impressive to me.
Are some of his feats blown out of proportion? Is he some-
times judged unfairly against his otherworldly 2007 numbers?
Do plenty of people sit and wait hoping he fails?
The answer to all three questions is yes.
I don't know if Tebow will succeed in the NFL. I don't
know if he will win his second Heisman or a third national
title. I don't know if he will ever turn it around this season.
But when you walk out of the stadium Saturday, you know
you won't ever forget watching him.
When you finish watching UF's win over Florida State, try
to cherish your memories of a once-in-a-generation guy.
Just know it took those two low moments to lead to so many
great moments.Tr oy
