“PEANUTS” COLLECTION WILL BE ON DISPLAY.

Charlie Brown may have once feared 
the Environmental Protection Agency 
after he bit a tree, but at UF, he and the “Peanuts” cast have come to teach visitors about caring for the environment.The “Peanuts … Naturally: Charlie 
Brown and Friends Explore Nature” ex-hibit will kick off from 10 a.m. to 3 p.m. Saturday at the Florida Museum of Natu-ral History.
The exhibit focuses on Charles Schulz’s 
exploration of the natural world through his “Peanuts” comic strips, said Tamara Herchel, the museum’s marketing and public relations coordinator.
It includes samplings from his comic 
strips and videos that touch on topics like the universe, elements and gardening.On Saturday, the George A. Smathers 
Libraries’ collection of vintage “Peanut” 
memorabilia will be on display, Herchel said.
The Sequential Artists 
Workshop will give dem-onstrations on drawing and inking comic strips, 
and representatives from UF’s School of Ants proj-ect will explain to attend-
ees how to participate in ant research in their own backyards.“I like to call it ‘edu-tainment,’” Her-
chel said.
The exhibit will run from Saturday to 
Jan. 2. Admission is free this weekend for UF students.
Paige Pitisci, 19-year-old telecommu-
nication sophomore, grew up listening to her dad read “Peanuts” to her, so she’s ex-cited for the exhibit.
“Using the comic strip will be an enjoy-
able way for people to learn about science and the environment and bring back child-hood memories,” Pitisci said.

Rainbow ﬂ  ags will ﬁ  ll Uni-
versity Avenue this weekend 
when this year’s Pride Festi-val hits the streets.
The annual Gainesville 
Pride Festival will take place from 1 p.m. to 9 p.m. At noon, a parade will start at Wild Iris Books, 802 W. University Ave. For an hour, marchers and ﬂ  oats will trickle down University Avenue. By 1 p.m., the parade will ﬂ  ood into Bo Diddley Community Plaza.
Patrons can expect drag 
queen performances and live performances by local bands. Food vendors will be present throughout, as well as rafﬂ  es and other activities for chil-dren and adults alike.
“Every part of the commu-
nity that is LGBT-friendly will be involved,” said Bridget Siegel, president of UF Pride Student Union.
The Pride Community 
Center of North Central Flor-ida hosts the festival, and or-ganizations like Pride Student Union will volunteer at the event to spread awareness.
“This is our time to shine,” 
said Siegel, a 20-year-old reli-gion junior.

UF Student Government po-
litical parties started campaign-
ing this week for Tuesday’s and Wednesday’s elections.
Both the Students Party and 
the Swamp Party appeared  around campus and provided students with information about their campaign platforms and party messages.
This semester, both parties 
have new platform points gen-erated by student input. For ex-ample, the Students Party aims to bring more options where of-age students can buy alcohol on cam-pus.
Students Party campaign man-
ager Dave Bradshaw said many UF students are old enough to consume alcohol responsibly, in-cluding more than 15,000 gradu-ate and professional students.
Currently, students who can drink legally can only buy alco-hol at the Orange & Brew.
“It seems to be a little harsh,” 
Bradshaw said.
One of the points on the 
Swamp Party’s platform is to in-stall sunscreen dispensers in Ben Hill Grifﬁ  n Stadium. Swamp Par-ty spokesman Daniel Landesberg said it’s a completely new idea.
He said party leadership was 
sitting around brainstorming platform points, and a lot of them had sunburns from a football game.  
“It can really prevent poten-
tial skin damage and certainly be beneﬁ  cial to students,” Landes-berg said.
Both parties’ platforms said 
they hope to establish more scooter parking on campus and increase funding for student or-ganizations.

◗ THIS IS THE FIRST TIME ALACHUA 
COUNTY WILL HAVE DIRECT ACCESS TO THE SYSTEM.
PHILLIP A. NUNLEY
Alligator Contributing Writer
Alachua County has broadened its 
countywide emergency management sys-
tem to add precautions that will warn resi-dents faster in the event of a disaster.
The Emergency Alert System now gives 
the president, state government and local government the ability to broadcast about natural and man-made disasters or life-threatening situations, according to a coun-ty press release.
This is the first time Alachua County 
will have direct access to the system. Pre-viously, the county had to contact the Na-tional Weather Service in Jacksonville to get updates about severe weather, said Dave Donnelly, county emergency management director.
He said employees have been through 
training, and all proper paperwork has been filled out to allow Alachua County di-rect access to the emergency system.After Sept. 11, there needed to be a way 
for the president to contact the whole na-tion simultaneously, he said.
The Emergency Alert System can only 
broadcast through television and radio.
In case of an actual emergency, a web-
site and phone number are given to citizens for direction on what to do.
The system has been around since the 
1950s, but due to technology issues and an outdated platform, it was unavailable to the county.
Alachua County updated its system, 
which allowed officials to tap into the Emergency Alert System.
Another way for citizens to get infor -
mation in cases of an emergency is the Co-deRED system.
CodeRED allows people to sign up to 
receive the same notifications the Emer -
gency Alert System sends. It will send in-formation through subscribers’ mobile and home phones, email and hearing-impaired systems.
“In this day and age, everyone has a cell-
phone on them,” said Mark Sexton, county spokesman.
The system, combined with CodeRED, 
allows more people to be reached in cases of emergency, Donnelly said.County updates emergency 
system to provide fast alerts2011 festival.  This year, Hannahs 
said she is expecting about 100 vendors.
“Gainesville has a thriving 
pride festival,” Hannahs said. “It’s an indication that the local LGBT community is thriving in itself.”
Hannahs said protesters often 
come out for the festival, but safe-ty volunteers and police will be present as a precautionary mea-sure.
The LGBT pride festival isn’t 
limited to the LGBT community, she said.
“Sometimes pride festivals 
get a bad rep, but ours has a lot of representation throughout the community,” Hannahs said. “The festival is for folks from all walks of life.”
Bobby Brito, a 19-year-old po-
litical science junior, said the festi-val is a great experience.
“Pride shows people that aren’t 
necessarily ‘out’ yet that there is a large system of support for every-one within Gainesville,” he said. “It’s wonderful.”4, ALLIGATOR � FRIDAY, SEPTEMBER 28, 2012

The UF Student Government 
Election Commission ruled Thurs-
day that the Swamp Party cannot be referred to as “the former Unite Party” — or any variation thereof — in campaign materials.
Sen. Truman Williams, on behalf 
of the Swamp Party, filed an elec-tions violation complaint against Sen. Umair Asghar and the Students Party for misrepresenting a fact in a guest column Asghar wrote for the Alligator.
Asghar wrote that the Unite Par -
ty had been replaced by the Swamp Party and most of its members had been in the Unite Party, which Wil-liams argued was false.
“We created this party as a new 
party for the University of Florida,” Williams said.
Christian Chessman, who repre-sented Asghar and the Students Par -
ty , said the column was protected as political speech and not campaign material.
Williams said only 10 Swamp 
Party candidates have been involved with the Unite Party.
Students Party representative 
Sen. Carly Wilson said 15 were af-filiated with Unite.
The commission said neither is a 
majority of the slated candidates.“If new leadership emerges and 
starts a new party , and that party doesn’t want to be associated with the old party for any reason, they shouldn’t be,” said Commission Chairman Wes Stephens.The commission unanimously 
ruled a cease-and-desist on the is-sue. But this rule can’t stop people from stating fact, such as saying a former Unite Party senator was a former Unite Party senator.
“Fortunately, I believe in Uni-
versity of Florida’s system of justice, and we’ll appeal it,” Chessman said after the hearing.

This football season, the 
Gators’ success on the field 
will aid more than just their record.
The fourth annual Aca-
demic Sports Challenge will bring in money to the George A. Smathers Libraries for ev-ery touchdown scored in the season. Students, faculty and alumni can pledge dollars per touchdown to donate to the li-brary system.
At the end of the 12-game 
season, donors pay their dona-tions based on the number of touchdowns scored, said Bar -
bara Hood, UF library spokes-woman.
Students can join the chal-
lenge by filling out an online pledge form, which can be found at the UF libraries’ web-site.
Pledges can range from 25 
cents to more than $100, de-pending on what the donor wants to contribute. Students can join the challenge at any time during the season, Hood said.
“The good thing about it is 
people can also choose where they want their money to go to,” she said.
Donors can choose to have 
their donations go to specific collections and libraries, she said. The pledge sheet has sev-eral collections and libraries listed, but donors can write in other specific locations they want to direct their donation toward.
Since the program started, 
it has been expanded to in-clude basketball as part of The Florida Basketball 3-point Challenge, which works simi-larly to the Academic Sports Challenge.
Donors can pledge money 
for every successful 3-point shot made during the regular basketball season for the men’s and women’s teams.
“The funds we raise from 
the challenge are for all the students,” said Samuel Huang, library associate dean for ad-vancement and development. 
“It is to meet all the stu-
dents’ learning needs.”
Richard Carris, a UF alum-
nus and member of the Library Leadership Board, presented the idea for the challenge four years ago.
While watching the 2009 
BCS championship game, the idea came to his then 13-year-old son Brent.
“I thought it would be smart 
to have some sort of donation to the school for every touch-down,” said Brent, now 17.Donation program

With sneakers on their feet, competitors in 
the upcoming Gainesville Beer Run 5K will 
race to the finish line for a cold, frothy prize.
Runners and beer enthusiasts will gather at 
the Gainesville House of Beer today at 6 p.m. to run a 5K to benefit nonprofit organizations A Walk in My Shoes Inc. and the Pledge 5 Foundation. Race director and event coordina-tor Dan Phillips said 200 people have already registered.
Mayor Craig Lowe plans to attend and will 
fire the starting gun.
The race will start at the Gainesville House 
of Beer and will make a circular route through Midtown. At the end of the race, each com-petitor will be given a mug to taste craft beers, such as Bold City and Yuengling Oktoberfest.Not all who sign up intend to run. Some 
paid $15 to spend the event drinking beer.
While some health enthusiasts will attend, 
the focus of the run is craft beer, Phillips said.
“As soon as I cross the finish line, I’m gon-
na go get a beer right away,” said Cady San-dler, a 22-year-old UF  public health master’s student.
Caryn Barry , CEO of A Walk in My Shoes 
Inc., said the event aims to target people from various walks of life.    
“Beer is going to be a popular thing any-
way,” she said, “which is what we’re learning towards.”A Walk in My Shoes Inc. collects lightly 
worn shoes, cleans them up and ships them to Haiti, according to Barry. It started gathering used footwear in 2007. 
The organization will be collecting shoes 
for donations before and after the Gainesville Beer Run 5K.
Phillips said Gainesville’s culture fits with 
the mission for the run.
“Everyone likes to give back to charities 
and Gainesville is known as a heavy running town and also as a very well-known party town,” he said. “So I figured why not combine all three?” Runners to sprint for a drink and donations at Beer Run 5K

UF students can now bowl against someone across the coun-
try without having to travel far -
ther than the Reitz Union’s Game Room.UF is the first university in the 
nation to offer XBowling, a social mobile application that combines traditional bowling with technol-ogy. It allows bowlers to connect with players worldwide, said Bill Fasig, chief marketing officer at its parent company, Sports Challenge Network.
Students can download the app 
for free on any smartphone.
“XBowling is bowling without 
boundaries,” he said. “We eliminate the physical and time boundaries to allow people to bowl with someone around the world.”
Sports Challenge Network set 
up a server in the Reitz Union’s Game Room that reads live scores and transmits them to users’ mobile devices within seconds, said Fasig, 49.
All users have to do is download 
the app to their smartphones, set up an account and register their loca-tion to see their game live, he said. Most challenges are free, but some may cost up to 10 cents.
Not only can users play their op-
ponents live, but if a competitor is only able to bowl later in the week or month, the scores can be record-ed at separate times, Fasig said. For the later bowler, the score will show up as if the game is live, with the competitor’s score showing up frame by frame.
Game Room manager Char -
lotte Dare said she thought using the app was a good way to stay in touch with someone without physi-cally being with them.
“I think it’s the next big thing 
that’s happening,” she said. “I think it brings a little bit of newness to bowling, a little bit of excitement to bowling.”
Dare said she hopes having the 
app at UF will increase the amount of Game Room bowlers.
Philosophy junior Brett Pal-
aschak, 20, checked his XBowling app as he bowled his third game Wednesday in lane 15 of the Game Room.
“I don’t really understand it ful-
ly yet,” he said, “but I’ve been using it to keep track of my averages.”
Palaschak said he would chal-
lenge people once he learns more about the app.
Fasig said he hopes UF can take 
the lead using the app, eventually challenging other schools, doing in-tramurals or even conducting char -
ity events via XBowling.
“What I love and see is people 
getting excited about the ability to connect with anyone in the world,” Fasig said.UF is first university in nation to offer bowling application

Darts & Laurels
Were you upset about the replacement referees in the NFL so 
far this season? Well, the original refs ﬁ  nally came to an agree-ment with the team owners over their labor dispute. Thank goodness, because fantasy football leagues everywhere were failing miserably or something. We give a maybe-they-hate-their-uniforms-because-they-get-confused-with-Foot-Locker-employees DART to the NFL replacement refs. We hear yellow 
ﬂ  ags are on sale for half off.
MEME ALERT! “Grumpy Cat” is the latest Internet sensa-
tion. Tard, short for Tartar Sauce, is kind of a dwarf cat with a frown of gold. She’s cute, trust us, but she just looks perpetually sad — so don’t take it personally. We give a please-tell-us-that-you-love-us-because-it-doesn’t-look-like-it LAUREL to Tard the 
Grumpy Cat. While you look so sad in photographs, we abso-lutely love it when you smile.
Do you believe everything you read on the Internet? Well, 
you shouldn’t. This week, though, some big time journalists took a satirical Politico column seriously . They really thought that Paul Ryan’s nickname for Mitt Romney was “the Stench.” It even got Paul Krugman who, when he found out it wasn’t true, to call it “really clumsy satire.” We give a OK-but-it-was-a-total-ly-believable-nickname DART to serious journalists in the biz.
Sometimes things are hard to understand. We’re simple-
minded folk, so if a tough topic is explained with a helpful graphic, then we are more likely to absorb information. That’s why we appreciate Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanya-hu’s illustration during the United Nations General Assembly this week. He wants to stop Iran’s uranium enrichment program before it reaches a dangerous level; he drew a red line on a draw-ing of a bomb at the “90 percent” line. We give a that-bomb-totally-looked-like-it-was-made-by-ACME-but-we-like-your-effort LAUREL to Netanyahu. (Note: Not Matisyahu.)
We’re going to talk about rappers now. We’re not happy that 
Lil Wayne now holds the record for most Billboard Hot 100 hits. This is a bad thing because it means that Elvis Presley , arguably the man you can thank for most current music, no longer holds the record. There’s no way that future generations should look back at our Billboard charts and think that Lil Wayne was more successful or awesome than Elvis. That’s just not OK. We give a however-if-you-did-a-mashup-of-Hound-Dog-and-Mr.-Carter DART to Lil Wayne.
Everyone should be super stoked that Childish Gambino, 
aka Donald Glover, is performing tonight at Flavet Field. The concert is free, and Hoodie Allen is performing before Gambino takes the stage. We’d like to apologize that we are not UCLA — you’ll get it if you listen to his songs. Speaking of which, listen to his songs. He’s more than a hilarious actor on NBC’s Commu-nity; he’s also a genius lyricist. We give a is-there-anything-this-man-can’t-do LAUREL to Childish Gambino.
Stay safe this weekend, Gators, and try not to get swamped!
A love letter to Alyssa for her kindness
For those who actually read my column (thank you!), you know I devote it to progressive politics. Well, you won’t be hearing about that today.
You may be surprised to learn that I do indeed have many 
other interests, one of which is dancing my ass off at of Mon-treal shows. So I’m going to tell you a little story.
After a miserable weekend of being sick and then not be-
ing sick and then getting sick again and hating myself for getting behind in my coursework and feeling like an incom-petent idiot, I allowed myself to be excited at the prospect of seeing one of my favorite bands at the Reitz Union for free — the one and only of Montreal.
If you’ve never listened to of Montreal, imagine dancing 
on the surface of the sun while tripping on acid.
I arrived for an afternoon class on Tuesday and decided to 
stop by the University Box Ofﬁ  ce to ask what time I should line up later that evening for the show.
Before I had the chance to close the door behind me, I saw 
four words that crushed my mood further than I thought it could get: of Montreal — SOLD OUT.
I had no idea they gave out tickets on Friday!I went out of town over the weekend and thought you 
only had to show up and line up for the concert. Needless to say, I was wrong.
Despite an enjoyable class, I couldn’t get over the dis-
heartening thought in the back of my mind that I missed out on seeing one of my all-time favorite bands for free. I had seen them once before, but it was without a doubt one of the most fun shows I’d ever been to. At one point, the frontman, Kevin Barnes, emerged from a papier-mâché cofﬁ  n covered head to toe in shaving cream. Enough said.
After leaving class, I called my very good friend Summer 
on the phone to vent my frustration.
Being the amazing person she is, she encouraged me to go 
to the Reitz and try to get in anyway.
She simply told me, “You’ll get in.”Unlike her, I’m not optimistic. I also gave my friend David 
an earful. I considered trying to buy a ticket from someone in line, but I realized I left most of my cash in my car.
I had two one-dollar bills in my wallet.By this time, I’ve given up all 
hope.
David suggested the same 
thing as Summer: “Just go and try .” He offered to let me borrow $20 to buy a ticket off of someone in line. I hesitated, but he con-vinced me.
Outside the Rion Ballroom,  a 
large crowd and line had already 
formed for the show. I waved the $20 around and repeatedly asked aloud, “Anyone want to sell their ticket?”
No hope.Most of them had already gotten their tickets punched 
and wristbands secured. No one responded. Most everyone looked at me like I was a martian.
I was giving up hope again. Why would anyone want to 
sell their ticket? I was just going to leave.
But then a girl walked up to me and presented her ticket.“You need it?” I lit up: “Yeah!”I was about to give her the $20. She said, “Just take it for 
free.”
I was confused: “Why? No, I can’t do that.”She told me she’s a member of RUB. Someone randomly 
gave her the ticket, and she didn’t need it. I couldn’t believe my luck — there was no way this was happening. She hand-ed me the ticket, marked it with her hole puncher and an-other RUB member put a wristband around my wrist. I was in! I asked the girl for her name, and it’s Alyssa. I gave her a hug and thanked her.
Thank you, Summer, for your optimism. Thank you, Da-
vid, for your encouragement.
And thank you, Alyssa, for your generosity.If you’re reading this, I want you to know I love you, and 
I will never in my life forget you.
Now you can understand why I took a brief departure 
from my usual politics during these columns; with a little op-timism and positivity, the world goes ‘round.

In a world buzzing over cell-
phones and high-speed Inter -
net, ultra-fast networking, so-
cial media and text messaging, one can easily believe that he or she is always “in the know.” We crave news and thirst for more informa-tion. We desire it now ...
Well, here it goes: My name is 
Erik, and I’m Pedro Bravo’s room-mate.
Pedro was a randomly assigned 
roommate, and he seemed like a pretty nice kid. He was quiet, thoughtful and courteous.  
Three or four days a week he 
just wasn’t here, but when he was, he kept to himself. He was like a ghost. He stayed in his bedroom and always shut his door. When he came out it was to refill his cup, eat a quick snack or make himself something to eat. He rarely washed his dishes.
He enjoyed watching “Futura-
ma,” “Family Guy” and really any-thing on Comedy Central. He was very artistic and enjoyed keeping a journal. Pedro never said much about it, but I was curious, so I would look.
I saw pictures of hearts; red and 
pink hearts, shattered hearts, hearts in tiny pieces, broken hearts. Next to his illustrations there was usually a caption — perhaps even a poem.Several reporters have asked me 
if his behavior before the incident was odd, suspicious or unusual. It wasn’t. It was Pedro. I lived with him, but I hardly knew him.
The first time the investigators 
came by was Friday night between 11 p.m. and midnight. I had just finished cooking dinner and was cleaning up, when I heard a knock at the door.
I told a friend to answer it.When asked by the officers if Pe-
dro was home (which he was not), he called me downstairs.
After 30 to 40 minutes of in-
terviewing, I had so many unan-swered questions.Was my 
roommate OK? Was he safe? Was he missing?
Or was he a suspect in a poten-
tial homicide? Was he dangerous? Should I feel threatened — should I leave?
I’m still here.I’ve been asked “off the record” 
if I think he did it. Sadly, I know as much as you do. I don’t know ei-ther. But nevertheless, here’s what I do know:
I saw Pedro for the last time 
Thursday afternoon, between 1 p.m. and 2 p.m.
I was sitting at my living room 
table eating lunch when he came out of his bedroom. He was wear -
ing the same exact outfit as the one depicted in that surveillance photo taken at Best Buy: dark, navy-blue jeans and a black shirt.
He said goodbye and left.I stayed at the apartment until 5 
p.m., when I left for an event at UF.
Pedro hadn’t returned.After the event was over, I came 
back to my apartment, and by then it was between 10 p.m. and 11 p.m. According to my other roommate, Pedro came back between 8 p.m.  and 10 p.m.
He didn’t stay long.He walked quickly up the stairs 
and disappeared into his bedroom — no hello, nothing.
In less than five minutes, he left, 
walking back down the stairs with his backpack.
My roommate vaguely remem-
bers what he was wearing, or if he appeared to be dirty, muddy or sweaty. I keep the apartment very clean, vacuuming almost every day; I didn’t see anything suspicious.
Because of my tough schedule, I 
didn’t go to sleep until early Friday morning — 4 a.m.
Still no Pedro.That Thursday, Pedro put a question on the little white board attached to our fridge asking how much the tickets were for Satur -
day’s football game. I answered the question. 
By the time I woke up Friday 
morning, after only five hours of sleep, there was a new question, a question — again — asked by Pe-dro: How many tickets can students buy? –Pedro.
In other words, Pedro came 
home between the hours of 4 a.m. and 9 a.m. and left.
Christian Aguilar was last seen 
at 6 p.m. on Thursday near Streit’s Motorsports on Northwest 13th Street. His cellphone was shut off at about 8 p.m., according to reports.
Since then, police officers, detec-
tives, forensics units and reporters have been in and out of our apart-ment.
A receipt for a shovel, dated 
Sept. 16, was found in Pedro’s bed-room. They’ve been back and forth, searching for anything, clues, evi-dence that could lead them to the whereabouts of Christian.
On Saturday evening, after re-
turning from the football game, I found something suspicious in our washing machine.
It was one outfit, the same outfit 
that he was wearing that last time I saw him. It was washed, but it was still damp.
I’ve been asked a lot about his 
bedroom — what it looked like, what was in it. 
It was usually messy, but the last 
and most startling thing I saw was a quote on his white board, which read:
    “Death must be so beautiful. 
To lie in the soft brown earth, with the grasses waving above one’s head, and listen to silence. To have no yesterday, and no tomorrow. To forget time, to forgive life, to be at peace.”  — Oscar Wilde

Regional Transit System’s bus 
routes will change Saturday due to 
the 2012 Gainesville Pride Parade.
The parade, which will start at 
noon, will go from Ayers Medical Building to Bo Diddley Community Plaza. Four of RTS’s transit routes will be affected. The routes will change from 12:30 p.m. to 1:30 p.m.
Routes 27 and 6 will only make 
one trip during the course of that hour, but the routes will use differ -
ent roads, which could make the ride 10 to 15 minutes longer.
Routes 15 and 5 will make six 
trips and will be about 15 minutes longer than usual.
All of the routes can be seen on 
the homepage of RTS’s website un-der the “Pride Parade Detours” sec-tion.
RTS tries to provide notices about 
any changes in information about a week before they occur, said Chip Skinner, RTS spokesman.
“We try to give enough of an 
advance notice so people can adjust their schedules,” he said.
Patrons can also check the RTS 
Facebook page, or use its online tracking application to see the changes.About 55,000 people ride RTS 
buses per weekday , about 29,000 ride on Saturdays and 7,700 ride on Sundays, Skinner said. He said about 75 percent of riders are students.
Richard Israel, 19, takes the No. 5 
from the Rosa Parks RTS Downtown Station to get to his job at Gator Cor -
ner Dining Center.He said the rerouting would 
make getting to work harder, but he’d still be taking the bus on Satur -
day.
“It’s my only transportation, so 
I’m still going to take it,” he said. “I just have to walk a little farther.”

Ian Elsner was 8 years old 
when he learned how to ride a 
unicycle.
A family that unicycles to-
gether, stays together, his dad always said, and although El-sner has fallen hundreds of times over the years, he’s still unicycling.
Elsner, 23, is hoping to 
share his passion at the first Gainesville Unicycle Festival. It’s scheduled from 5 p.m. to 7:30 p.m. today on the North Lawn and Saturday from noon to 5 p.m.
Roughly 20 to 30 unicyclists 
  — ranging from UF, Florida 
State University and University of Central Florida students to unicycle club members from Jacksonville and Sarasota  — 
will participate in the event. 
The festival is free and open to spectators.
The goal is to create a space 
where the best unicyclists in the state can compete, learn and have fun with each other, said Elsner, the former president of Objects in Motion, UF’s jug-gling club.
Today , the unicyclists will 
try to stay balanced as they pedal during a game called “UniBash,” which is similar to football, said the first-year digi-tal arts and sciences graduate student.
On Saturday , spectators 
can watch participants on the North Lawn compete in games like hockey or “polo,” joust-ing, slow and fast races and even sumo wrestling — all per -
formed on a unicycle.
Trophies will be awarded to 
the winners of each competi-tion, and all the unicyclists will ride to a restaurant downtown.
“The goal of this is to start 
a unicycling tradition here in Gainesville and to make this festival an annual thing,” El-sner said.
He said being with a group 
of unicyclists is a lot more en-joyable than unicycling alone.
“If you are in a group of six 
to 10 people going down Uni-versity Avenue looking for a place to eat, you can joke about the stares,” Elsner said.
Shelley MacLean, who 
graduated from UF in 2009, has been unicycling for more than a year. She said she is excited to get together with others at the festival.
“It’s an awesome feeling 
when everyone shares some-thing in common,” she said.
MacLean, 26, said some 
people are even able to solve a Rubik’s Cube while unicycling.
“Anything you can do on 
two feet, you can do on a uni-cycle,” she said.
Journalism senior Jenn Riek 
said she almost had a collision on her bicycle with a unicycle.
“I don’t think bicycles and 
unicycles mix too well,” she said. “It’s a funny story.”
But Riek, 21, said she ad-
mires unicyclists’ balancing skills and courage.
“They are brave because 
I’ve tried unicycling, and it’s extremely hard,” she said. “You can’t be afraid to fall.”Gainesville Unicycle

A study released last week by 
an electronics warranty service 
provider estimated that Ameri-cans have spent $5.9 billion on iPhone repairs since the first re-lease in 2007.
SquareTrade surveyed more 
than 2,000 iPhone users and then combined the cost of repairs, re-placements and insurance de-ductibles for broken iPhones.
Younger iPhone users are more 
likely to damage their phones, ac-cording to the study. Half of iP-hone users under 35 have had an accident.
Addie Alter, an 18-year-old 
nursing freshman, is among them. She has damaged her iP-hone three times.Each time, Alter chose to get 
the phone repaired, which has cost her more than $200 total.
“I would freak out,” she said. 
“It stressed me out the entire day. I just needed to get it fixed even if it cost money.”
Instead of visiting an Apple 
store to repair her phone, Alter used the iHospital above Pita Pit in the UF Plaza. Alter said she chose to go there because it was cheaper and more convenien, and because there is no Apple store in Gainesville.
The study found that the need 
for iPhone repairs most often results from being dropped. Im-mersing iPhones in liquid came in at No. 2.
iHospital Mac surgeon James 
Franklin Baldwin said about 80 percent of customers are stu-dents. He said the top reasons for iPhone repair visits are cracked screens, which typically cost about $120 to fix, and water dam-age, which costs about $50.
Baldwin said he wasn’t sur -
prised by the survey results.
“No time before now have 
people had pieces of glass in their pockets all the time,” he said.

The Gator Wesley Foundation’s campus pastor 
believes it was a BB shot from a passing vehicle that 
shattered its glass door Wednesday night.
The majority of the United Methodist campus min-
istry was upstairs worshipping when the left door of the first-floor entryway had a quarter-inch hole punched into its upper right corner, leaving a web of cracks across the pane.
Early childhood education senior Emily Minter 
was studying alone in the lobby when she heard the thwack behind her.
“It sounded like when someone jerks on the door 
when it’s locked,” the 21-year-old said.
When she turned around, Minter noticed the 
cracked glass. She could hear it splitting as she ap-proached.
“One crack would go, then it just kept cracking,” she said.
Minter fetched former staff member Jessica Jollie, a 
21-year-old sociology senior. Jollie ran upstairs to find the pastor, who then called the police.
Narcie Jeter, 32, the executive director and campus 
pastor, said there were no security cameras.
Jollie said she didn’t think it was intentional to-
ward the church. Because the door remained intact, she wasn’t too worried about security.
“If someone wanted to get in here, there wasn’t 
much stopping them,” she said. “It was just a little girl down here by herself.”
Pam Petersen, the ministry’s 58-year-old office 
manager, said she spoke with multiple companies on Thursday about replacing the door.
The damages were originally estimated by the min-
istry at about $2,000. A police report put the amount to be about $500.
“We budget for maintenance, but it would have 
been wonderful to use that money for the ministry, student outreach or a mission trip,” Jeter said. “We just want to make sure the students are as safe as pos-sible.”

Gary Simpson makes it out on 
the water, rod in hand, about 40 
days a year.
He is among millions of other 
Florida fishers. Florida was ranked as the state with the most recre-ational fishers earlier this month in a study released by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service.
“I can remember at 5 years old 
realizing fishing was very impor -
tant to me. It goes all the way back 50 years,” said Simpson, manager of Gary’s Bait and Tackle Shop on 13th Street.
The 2011 National Survey of 
Fishing, Hunting and Wildlife-As-sociated Recreation State Overview said Florida had 3,092,000 anglers in 2011. The report included hunting and fishing trends nationwide.
Simpson said Florida’s extended 
fishing season is possibly one reason why there are more anglers in the state.
“There’s always a lot of inter -
est in fish catching in Florida, all the way from the panhandle to the Keys,” he said. “That’s obviously a function of our year-long spawning season. Florida is just set up in such a way that it has the best fishing.”
Robert West, secretary for a UF 
bass fishing club, said Florida is great for fishing because of the diverse an-gling areas, even if Gainesville isn’t right next to the ocean.
“We have the best access to fish-
ing,” West said. “If you think about Central Florida, there’s tons of lakes and springs — and the whole state is surrounded by water.”
Though Florida had the most ac-
tive fishers, Alaska had the highest proportion of fishing residents at 40 percent. Florida was also ranked third for most in-state wildlife watchers.
The study also found that nation-
wide participation in recreational fishing increased by 11 percent and hunting was up 9 percent. 
West said he’s glad to see that 
more people are taking an interest in one of his favorite sports. He said he loves the thrilling feeling he gets when he hooks a fish.
“Not necessarily bringing it in,” 
the religion senior said. “But hook-ing it and feeling that adrenaline rush. It’s amazing.”

A mouse’s ability to repair its dam-
aged ear tissue may have implications 
for new regenerative therapies in hu-mans, according to a study published Thursday in the journal Nature.
The African spiny mouse could be-
come a new base for regenerative medi-cine research in mammals, said Ashley Seifert, a 36-year-old Department of Biology postdoctoral fellow at UF who worked on the study.
After hearing about a mouse that 
could shed its skin to evade predators, Seifert packed his bags for Kenya in May 2009 to begin trials at the Mpala Research Centre.
“A mouse losing its skin doesn’t 
make any sense,” he said. “To locals, it was a novelty and not really something to look into.”
The researchers punched holes into 
the mice’s ears to test the ear tissue’s regenerative abilities. The team of six, which included Seifert, found that the African mice’s hair follicles regrew in the wounds.
He said in a regular lab mouse, 10 
days of growth would produce a scar but leave the original hole. The African spiny mice generated new cartilage and “a pretty good reconstitution of tissue.”
Seifert said the mice’s ability to re-
generate ear tissue is similar to sala-manders’ ability to regrow limbs dam-aged by predators. However, this is rarely seen in mammals.
The findings have implications for 
multiple fields like regeneration biol-ogy , and wounding and scarring in mammals, he said.
“The hope is future research on 
these mice will lead to human therapies down the road,” Seifert said.
Seifert, who usually works with am-
phibians, said he was surprised mul-tiple times during the process.
“Going into the project, it was like 
‘This sounds really interesting, but we need to confirm this,’” he said. “It was just a series of ‘Wow, this is real.’”UF study finds mice to have 
regenerative properties

 Phil Duncan knows how difﬁ  cult it is to 
help his team when he’s stuck on the sideline. 
He understands the adversity of not being with the team or participating when it mat-ters most. 
After more than a year and a half spent 
battling injuries, Duncan has ﬁ  nally returned to training day in and day out, doing what he loves to do.
  Duncan, a sophomore on Florida’s cross 
country team, underwent knee surgery last winter. He missed most of his freshman sea-son with a stress fracture in his foot. During his senior year in high school, lower-body injuries forced him to miss most of the track season.
  “I lost a lot,” Duncan said. “A lot of time in 
training. Right now, I feel like I’m better than I have been before, but I’m not where I could have been had I not gotten hurt.”
  The road back was a long one for Duncan, 
but his trust in the coaching staff helped him along the way.
  Duncan had to remain committed in order 
to return, as runners’ long, winding practice routes prevent coaches from keeping an eye on them. 
  “Your focus has got to be 100 percent,” 
Duncan said.
  His hard work has started to pay divi-
dends. 
Duncan ﬁ  nished seventh on the team at 
the Mountain Dew Invitational 8K on Sat-urday with a time of 26:01.86 and a No. 21 overall ﬁ  nish.
  The men’s and women’s cross country 
teams will travel to Saint Leo this weekend to compete in the Saint Leo Invitational. The men begin at 7:45 a.m. followed by the wom-en’s 6K at 8:15 a.m.
  The top seven Gators at the end of the 
regular season will become the travel squad for the Southeastern Conference and NCAA Championships.
  Duncan looks to close the gap with John-
Logan Hines, Eduardo Garcia and Matt Miz-ereck, who sit in positions 4-6.
  “You want to have a group of seven guys 
all running well in case somebody has a bad race,” Duncan said. “Then you have someone else right there that takes their spot.”
  The team atmosphere is important to coach 
Paul Spangler. It helps athletes realize that competing against opponents is more impor-tant than competing with each other.
  “As long as they’re getting better, it’s help-
ing the team,” he said. Runner overcoming injury  history

 Freshman Brianna Morgan has 
made more progress than any play-
er assistant coach Dave Balogh has seen in his time at Florida. 
  “Brianna, (in) the last two weeks, 
has improved more than any player I’ve had here in my 13 years,” Ba-logh said. “The jump that she has made in two weeks is very impres-sive.”
  Balogh described Morgan and 
fellow freshman Danielle Collins as impressive, coachable and power-ful.
  “They just do a good job with 
all the little things, in terms of the standard that the upperclassmen have set,” Balogh said. “They came right away and just ﬁ  t right in.”
  In their ﬁ  rst collegiate tourna-
ment last weekend, both put on an impressive display. 
Collins went 6-0 in the tourna-
ment, winning her three doubles and singles matches.
  Morgan went 3-0 in her singles 
matches but could not pick up a win in doubles, going 0-3. Despite Morgan’s winless effort in doubles, Balogh did not overreact. 
  “You can’t get too caught up in 
the result, especially in the fall,” he said. “The fall is more about devel-oping, getting better, getting stron-ger and getting faster.”
  Collins and Morgan would not 
have progressed as quickly if not for the inﬂ  uence of their veteran teammates. 
Upperclassmen Soﬁ  e Oyen, Ol-
ivia Janowicz, Alexandra Cercone, Caroline Hitimana and Lauren Em-bree have helped the freshmen ad-just to college tennis.  “They all have done a good job 
in telling [the freshmen] how we compete, how we prepare and how we stick together,” Balogh said. “Be-fore matches, during matches, after matches and just how we go about doing our business. Sometimes you see the results right away, and sometimes it takes a little while.”
  Collins and Morgan have seen 
early results. Balogh said the con-tinued development of the fresh-men is key as Florida seeks its third consecutive national title in 2013. 
  “To win, you’ve got to have all 
seven players on the same page,” Balogh said. “It’s very important for those two freshmen to see and learn how the upperclassmen do things, because to win it at the end is a combination of all the little things.”
  The Gators will compete in the 
Riviera/ITA All-American Cham-pionships starting on Saturday. 
The pre-qualifying round is Sat-
urday and Sunday, the qualifying round is Tuesday and Wednesday and the championships are Oct. 4-7. 
All seven Gators will be compet-
ing in the tournament.
  “Our whole philosophy here, 
especially at the beginning, you’ve got to be really process oriented,” Balogh said. 
“If we can just stick to the pro-
cess, then the bottom line is in May … winning the national champion-ship.” Freshman duo making 
progress for UF tennis

Gators kicker Caleb Sturgis is a semifinalist for the William V. Campbell Trophy. The award recognizes the nation’s top football scholar-athlete. On Thursday night, the NFL 
welcomed back referees who are actually qualified to offici-
ate professional football games. What a concept! 
With the exception of Seattle, pig-
skin fans across the nation rejoiced with 
a powerful fervor the Earth has not felt since referee Ed “Big Guns” Hochuli’s most recent bench press. We like our referees ripped and swole, thank you very much. Hochuli 2012!

Now, onto the picks! 
Ohio State (+3) will make gam-
blers everywhere happier because...
While a reported $300 million 
changed hands in Vegas due to the 
replacement referee debacle in Seattle, there isn’t any shady exchange of mon-ey at Ohio State. Oh wait, that’s why the No. 14 Buckeyes aren’t participat-ing in bowl season this year. Ohio State has nothing to lose. 
Braxton Miller will be the difference. 
He’ll extend his darkhorse Heisman campaign with the kind of balanced running and passing performance the Urban Legend likes from his quarter -
backs.

Michigan State (-3) will channel 
their inner Hochuli because...
Football is all about big guns, and 
Sparty has Brutus vastly out-broliced. The overrated Miller hasn’t seen a defense the caliber of Michigan State, which ranks in the top 15 nationally against both the run and the pass. Mill-er’s two threats will become none. This game calls for a strong, physical back like Le’Veon Bell, who will be looking to assert himself in the early Heisman talk.

� JENKINS SUFFERED A FRACTURE IN HIS 
RIGHT THUMB ON SEPT. 8. 
ADAM PINCUS
Alligators Staff Writer
 
Jelani Jenkins has an important doctor’s appointment 
today.
The junior linebacker will see a specialist on Friday 
to remove a pin in his fractured right thumb. Jenkins 
suffered the injury in the first quarter of Florida’s game against Texas A&M on Sept. 8. 
He missed UF’s last two games, against Tennessee and 
Kentucky , but is expected to be back on the field on Oct. 6 against LSU.
Gators coach Will Muschamp asked team trainer An-
thony Pass on Wednesday morning whether Jenkins would be in action against the Tigers.
“He said, ‘Coach, we’ll see,’” Muschamp said. “If ev-
erything goes as we feel like it planned, there’s a possibil-ity of that. He’ll probably be in a cast.’”
Muschamp said Jenkins’ status for next week will be 
based on the results of today’s evaluation. 
Jenkins underwent thumb surgery the morning of Sept. 
10. He started working in the weight room with strength coach Jeff Dillman during his second week of recovery.
“I want to say the first week he was pretty limited, did 
nothing,” Muschamp said. “This past week, he’s been running and lifting as much as he can with a cast.”
If Jenkins plays against LSU, he may need some time to 
adjust to competing with the cast.  
“The longer you go with it, the easier and more accus-
tomed you get to playing with it,” Gators defensive co-ordinator Dan Quinn said. “The first time out when you play with a cast sometimes (you think), ‘Ah, it feels big,’ or, ‘Can we trim it off this spot here to get it where it feels just right?’ And then after you play with it and practice with it for a few days, then you make the necessary adjustments to it (and) then usually you have a better feel for it.”
Before he suffered the fractured thumb in the first 
quarter against the Aggies, Jenkins racked up five tackles with one tackle for a loss.
Freshman linebacker Antonio Morrison started the past 
two games at Jenkins’ weakside linebacker spot. While the freshman contributed seven tackles and is tied for fifth on the Gators with 16, he doesn’t have Jenkins’ experience. Injured linebacker could play with cast vs. LSU

The Florida defensive linemen are get-
ting their rest. That wasn’t always the case 
in 2011.
Last season, UF coaches did not feel 
they had enough linemen on the roster that they could trust to perform in games, so the starters were on the field for a high percentage of snaps.
The backups have made strides this 
season, and it has allowed coach Will Mus-champ and defensive coordinator Dan Quinn to rotate fresh players into the game while giving the starters added rest. “They are taking less snaps,” Mus-
champ said. “As a result, I think we’ve 
played better as the game has worn on.”
Buck linebacker Dante 
Fowler Jr. and defensive 
end Jonathan Bullard headline the Gators’ im-proved depth. Both true freshmen earned playing time in each of Florida’s four games and have 
combined for 15 tackles, including two for a loss. Bullard made his first career start last Saturday against Kentucky.
Other players have stepped up and made an impact after not doing so for multiple years. Redshirt senior Earl Okine made two tackles against the Wildcats while sophomore Leon Orr tallied a career-high four tackles in the game. Orr has nine tackles on the season after recording only 10 all of last year.
Junior college transfer Damien Jacobs 
also earned the trust of the coaches early on. Quinn likes his ability to play both three-technique defensive tackle and nose tackle.
“He’s got good quickness,” Quinn said 
of Jacobs. “He can push the pocket.”

Jenkins, in his third season as a starter at line-
backer, has made 25 starts. He has racked up 14 
tackles in two games against LSU. 
The junior can also rush the passer and drop 
into coverage. Jenkins has two career intercep-tions, including one in the first quarter against former Tigers quarterback Jordan Jefferson in 2010. 
“He provides some real speed for us on the 
field,” Quinn said. 
“The guy’s a terrific blitzer. He can certainly 
match up tight-end wise when we get into our nickel package, and then just his experience playing linebacker. I don’t think you can over -
look that. So those three things, to me, would be big if we could get him back into our lineup. Hopefully everything goes well with his check-up moving forward.”

PickS , from page 16Rested Gators generating more pressure
Okine and Orr take is one less 
play starters Sharrif Floyd, Dominique Easley, Lerentee McCray and Omar Hunter are on the field. Quinn said he and Muschamp have specific times they like to rest their starters.
“Usually it’s at maybe the 
start of a series,” Quinn said. “It might be when their team is backed up. That’s usually how you end up starting with a rotation. And then as you get into third downs or some criti-cal downs, you try to get a guy like that back in the game.”
With well-rested linemen, 
the Gators can consistently generate pressure without blitzing. Coaches have rushed just four linemen regularly this season, which allows the linebackers to drop into cover -
age
“Are we getting as many 
sacks as we’d like?” Quinn said. “No. Are we getting to affect the quarterback some? Yes. So, in that way, I’m pleased with the four-man rushes. We are able to affect the quarterback where we feel a little bit more with four may-be than we had in the past.” 
Muschamp said the coach-
es have tried to decrease the number of snaps the starters play by 12 to 20 per game. He specifically mentioned that Floyd’s snaps have decreased from roughly 65 per game last season to 50 in 2012.
“When you talk about an-
other 15-18 snaps to a 300-plus pounder, it takes its wear and tear,” Muschamp said. “You’re also taking on a double team with their guard and tackle, and the combination of over 700 pounds for another two or three power plays, it makes a huge difference.”

If the hardware hanging in coach Gregg 
Troy’s office isn’t enough to prove he’s ac-
customed to winning, the hardware around his swimmers’ necks should be. 
Troy is entering his 14th season coaching 
the men’s and women’s swimming and div-ing teams at Florida. 
Counting his numerous individual ac-
colades is a long, tiring process. He’s been named the Southeastern Conference Men’s Swimming Coach of the Year four times, the NCAA Men’s Swimming Coach of the Year three times, the NCAA Women’s Swim-ming Coach of the Year once and the U.S. Swimming Coach of the Year once.
On Sept. 7, Troy was inducted into the 
American Swimming Coaches Association Hall of Fame. When he accepted the award, Troy passed credit to his assistant coaches and athletes. 
The Gators are led by a man who will 
forever be enshrined as one of the sport’s best. Even with his admittance into the Hall of Fame, Troy holds one honor above all —  his time spent as the coach of the 2012 U.S. Olympic men’s team. 
“There’s a little different level of pres-
sure and a little bit of anxiety that goes along with it,” Troy said. “(It’s) a good ex-perience and a tremendous amount of fun. This is one where it’s fun more when you look back on it than while you were doing it.”The U.S. brought home 104 medals at the 
2012 Olympics, more than any other coun-try. Thirty-one medals came from the swim team. The men’s team racked up 16 medals, eight of which were gold. 
“The United States has a tradition of be-
ing the best swimming country,” Troy said. “ You don’t want that to fall under your own watch.”
Junior Elizabeth Beisel is a two-time 
Olympian for the U.S. and one of the top female swimmers in the SEC. She said Troy was a major reason why she chose to attend Florida. 
“I can’t thank him enough for everything 
he’s done,” Beisel said. “He’s gotten me to the Olympics and got me two medals.” 
The Gators will participate in the third 
annual All-Florida Invitational today, and it will continue through Sunday in the O’Connell  Center. The competition in-cludes Florida Atlantic, Florida Gulf Coast, Florida State, Miami, North Florida, Nova Southeastern and Rollins College. 
The meet will give Florida a chance to 
gauge its strengths. 
“It’s a real long season,” Troy said. “It’s 
extremely early to be swimming a meet, es-pecially if it’s three days, but it gives you a real good feel for what you have on the team.”Swim coach racking up awards

When Tyler McCumber wants to get 
away from the golf course, he tackles 
the enormous swells on Barbados’ east coast at Bathsheba Beach.
Away from Barbados and back on 
the fairways, McCumber helps guide the Gators. 
“The team is a huge priority in my 
life,” McCumber said. “I want our team to be organized and prepared for every tournament. It isn’t about how well I play, it’s about how well the team per -
forms. We want team victories.”
McCumber’s maturation has not 
gone unnoticed. The senior has estab-lished himself among the most deco-rated players in the Southeastern Con-ference, garnering Division I PING Honorable Mention recognition and earning a selection to the PING All-Southeast Region team and All-SEC second team during his junior year. 
“His maturity level has improved 
enormously,” coach Buddy Alexander said. “He grew into the player that he is now by virtue of the fact that he makes better decisions. He controls his emo-tions better and consequently he’s a much more consistent player.”
McCumber’s driving remains his 
strength, but he’s added another di-mension — an improved short game.
During the season opener at The 
Ocean Course in Kiawah Island, S.C., McCumber led the team in birdies with 10 for the three-round tournament. He credits Alexander’s emphasis on devel-oping his chipping and putting.
“Since I’ve been here I’ve worked 
tremendously on my short game,” Mc-Cumber said. “Alexander stresses the importance of having a short game in golf. It’s like a Band-Aid for a bad day on the golf course.”
Alexander said McCumber has 
shortened his drives to improve accu-racy, allowing him to hit the ball in the fairway more consistently. 
“He’s a much straighter and short-
er driver than he was as a freshman,” Alexander said. “His driving is a little shorter, but that’s OK. When you’re 
that long, you can cer -
tainly afford to give up 10 yards to get it into the fairway.”
Tyler’s father, Mark 
McCumber, also played an influential role in advancing his golf game.  Mark played on the PGA Tour from 1979 to 1994 and Champions Tour from 2001 to 2008. 
Tyler feels the Gators are talented 
enough to contend in both conference play and the NCAA Tournament if they continue to stay the course. 
Florida’s next opportunity to pre-
pare will be Sunday at the Illini Invita-tional in Olympia Fields, Ill.
“To be honest, I think all this team 
needs to do is take each day at a time,” Tyler said. “Prepare as much as we can so that when post-season rolls around we’re ready to go.”Senior maturing, improving

Adriana Leon only needed one 
goal to get her confidence flowing. 
Since the junior forward netted 
her first score as a Gator — a game-
winner in overtime against Auburn on Sept. 16 — she has been shooting feverishly. 
“I have a good shot, so I’m going 
to try to shoot it as much as I can,” Leon said. “I have a pretty good chance of getting the ball in the back of the net.” 
Leon scored a goal against Ten-
nessee on Friday and has taken 10 of Florida’s 29 shots in its past two matches.  
Despite playing in only seven of 
the Gators’ 10 games, Leon is second on UF in shots (21) after senior mid-fielder Erika Tymrak (30). 
Coach Becky Burleigh has encour-
aged Leon to be daring.
“You can’t score if you don’t 
shoot,” Burleigh said. 
“Adriana is a very aggressive 
player going to goal. She’s a player who’s starting to understand our system more and more the more she’s been with us.”
Leon joined the squad two weeks 
into the season after competing for Canada at the FIFA U-20 Women’s World Cup in Japan.  
The transfer from Notre Dame 
initially struggled to mesh with the offense. Following rough showings against Florida State and FIU, Leon said her touch was off and she was mentally exhausted.
She finally found her groove with 
a golden goal against Auburn.
“She really wants to get better,” 
Burleigh said. “It’s a transition from just a different way of playing than what she’s played before. But I think she is very open-minded about it.”
Leon showcased her fancy foot-
work and creativity in wins against Tennessee on Friday and Georgia on Sunday.She caught the Volunteers’ defense 
off-guard in the sixth minute, boot-ing a 20-yard shot that clipped the bottom of the crossbar and bounced into the net. 
The goal was Florida’s earliest 
this season.  
“I just saw the open space in front 
of me and wanted to shoot it,” Leon said after Friday’s match. 
Burleigh said Leon finally un-
derstands that if she passes the ball to a teammate on the attack, she can eventually get it back. 
“To me, if I’m an opposing team, 
that’s just makes her more danger-ous, because you know she can cre-ate her own shot,” Burleigh said.
When No. 24 Florida (6-3-1, 3-1 
Southeastern Conference) hosts Ole 
Miss tonight at 7 and Arkansas on Sunday at 1 p.m., Leon will face fa-miliar challenges.   
Tymrak said she expects the Reb-
els (9-2, 2-2 SEC) and the Razorbacks (4-5-1, 1-2-1 SEC) to utilize a bunker, which is when a defense packs the penalty area in order to reduce the amount of space the opposition has to attack. 
Ole Miss has allowed only 10 
goals in 11 matches this season, in-cluding five shutouts.
With Tymrak (sprained left ankle) 
and redshirt senior forward McKen-zie Barney (swollen right knee) still day-to-day, the attack might rely on Leon this weekend to chisel away at both squads’ prevent-style defenses.  
“The thing with a bunker is 
that you have to break them down somehow,” Tymrak said. “Let’s say we’re passing for a while, they’re going to expect us to make another pass. When [Leon] shoots it out of nowhere, that’s the element of sur-prise.”KATIE AGOSTIN

Tonight’s matchup against 
South Carolina is a perfect op-
portunity for Taylor Unroe to showcase her talents.
Although she can use scout 
teams to get ready for the Gamecocks’ offensive style, the sophomore libero will have to wait until she gets to Columbia, S.C., before she can really prepare for one of the most difficult venues the Gators will visit in Southeast-
ern Conference play this sea-
son — the Volleyball Competi-tion Facility.
“It’s a low ceiling, there’s 
not any room to play balls off the court and so the ball control will be a premier,” coach Mary Wise said. “Fortunately for us, our libero is playing some of her best volleyball now.”
So far in SEC play, Unroe 
has accounted for 36 percent of UF’s digs while also record-ing 10 assists and two aces. 
Like Wise, Unroe is con-
fident in her ability as No. 12 Florida (9-2, 3-0 SEC) faces South Carolina (13-2, 2-2 SEC) on the road tonight at 7 p.m. 
The Gamecocks, who play 
in a much smaller venue than other SEC teams, are undefeat-ed at home this season.
Unroe believes her im-
provements from last year will help her in an unfriendly envi-ronment.
“My personal serve-receive 
passing has improved a lot,” Unroe said. “With my overall game, I feel like I’ve grown as a college player, and I feel like the whole team has grown from last year to this year.”
Out of 192 serves Unroe has 
received this season, she al-lowed only one to hit the floor — a team-high 99.5 percent ef-ficiency rate. The sophomore has also excelled in preventing kills, which is expected to be a valuable skill against arguably the toughest hitter she will face this season.
South Carolina’s Juliette 
Thevenin currently ranks sec-ond in the SEC with 4.31 kills per set and third with 4.73 points per set.
“One of their best players, 
[Thevenin], she’s really good, she’s a really high-IQ player,” Unroe said. “The whole team is very high IQ, and they’re a hard working team, so it makes us feel like if we work hard, only the best can come of it. That’s all we can ever do is go against a team and work hard and hope for the best.”
Thevenin presents a chal-
lenge for the UF defense, but Unroe is a formidable counter.
Unroe ranks fourth in the 
SEC with 4.47 digs per set. She finished last season averaging 3.69 digs per set.
Unroe has posted those 
totals despite Florida’s high- powered offense, which ends points quickly and rarely gives her the opportunity to touch the ball. The Gators lead the SEC with a .318 hitting clip. 
South Carolina is close be-
hind Florida. The Gamecocks rank third with a .287 hitting percentage and 753 kills, aver -
aging 14.21 per set. 
Despite UF’s success with 
attacking, Wise knows having Unroe on the court will only increase Florida’s chance to win.
“We’ll have our work cut 
out for us in a big way on Fri-day night,” Wise said. “(But) when Taylor Unroe is touch-ing the first ball, good things happen, and we’ll really need that to happen both Friday and Sunday.”

 Through a trio of injuries 
that led to a shufﬂ  e at tackle, 
Florida’s line has held the of-fense together. 
  Matt Patchan has yet to 
play this season due to a strained pectoral muscle, Chaz Green has missed the past two games with a left ankle injury and Xavier Nixon is dealing with a shoulder in-jury. D.J. Humphries and util-ity lineman Kyle Koehne have stepped up in their absence, supporting the unit that coach Will Muschamp said was one of the keys to UF’s fast start. 
  “We’re able to do more of-
fensively because of up front,” Muschamp said. “We’re just better on the offensive line. … Much more physical up front, a year older, more mature, experienced, understanding a little bit more about climbing on the second level and those sort of things.”
  Nixon, a senior who came 
to Florida as a four-star re-cruit and the No. 3 offensive tackle in the class of 2009, has started the ﬁ  rst four games at left tackle. 
  After struggling to keep 
weight on during his ﬁ  rst three years at UF, Nixon has bulked up to 314 pounds this season. 
  Muschamp sees the ben-
eﬁ  t in improved run blocking, even as Nixon has dealt with what Muschamp called a “le-gitimate” shoulder injury.   “He’s a guy who has pushed 
through it,” Muschamp said. “Run assignments the other night were very good. He blocked extremely well in the run game. He didn’t ﬁ  nish on a couple of things. Protection is something we need to solid-ify as far as his pass protection is concerned.”
  Patchan started the ﬁ  nal 
seven regular-season games of 2011 at right tackle but has not played a snap in 2012. 
  Muschamp said he expects 
Patchan to play at some point this year but added that the injury is painful and difﬁ  cult to recover from, especially for an offensive lineman. 
  On Wednesday, Muschamp 
said Patchan “will probably be out the next couple weeks.”  Although Green is expect-
ed to return against LSU, UF’s coaching staff has said posi-tive things about Koehne’s performance in his absence. 
  Koehne, who the coaches 
feel comfortable using at all ﬁ  ve offensive line positions, has started at right tackle the past two weeks. 
  Humphries stepped in for 
Nixon at left tackle against Kentucky on Saturday, taking the majority of the second-half snaps.  Coaches were com-plimentary of Humphries, a freshman who enrolled dur-ing the spring as a ﬁ  ve-star recruit. 
  “D.J. deserves to play,” 
Muschamp said. “He played well.”
  Said offensive coordinator Brent Pease: “He’s getting bet-ter and better, and he needed that game to get some expe-rience of real live situations instead of just practice. … He did a really nice job. I thought he got a lot better.”
  Although Humphries is 
listed at only 275 pounds on Florida’s roster, Pease said the freshman has become stronger because of the team’s work in the weight room. 
  Muschamp said the major-
ity of the linemen beneﬁ  ted from their offseason work with strength and condition-ing coach Jeff Dillman. 
  “We’re a stronger football 
team because of the weight room,” Muschamp said.
