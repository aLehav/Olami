If Saturday’s game against Ala-
bama was Florida’s first difficult 
test under first-year coach Will Mus-champ, assigning a passing grade would be just as tough.
The Gators came in with a run 
defense ranked in the top five in the nation, dominating the line of scrim-mage with ease through four games. But they had not seen a team like Ala-bama, had not seen a running back like bona fide Heisman Trophy candi-date Trent Richardson.
Now they have, and now, that 
defense doesn’t look so dominant, as No. 17 Florida (4-1, 2-1 Southeastern Conference) lost 38-10 to No. 2 Ala-bama (5-0, 2-0 SEC) in front 90,888 in Ben Hill Griffin Stadium.
“We got beat by a better team,” 
Muschamp said. “We were inconsis-tent in stopping the run in the first half. They’ve got a good football team — we knew that going in. ... Richard-son’s a really good back. We knew that going in. They’re a good football team, and you can’t afford to make mistakes.”
After Florida received the kickoff 
and took a 7-0 lead on a 65-yard com-pletion from John Brantley to Andre Debose, Richardson and the Alabama offense took control. The 5-foot-11, 224-pound junior rattled off 35 yards on five carries on the Crimson Tide’s opening drive, then added 25 yards and a touchdown on the following se-ries to tie the game at 10.
As poorly as the Gators played 
against the run, Florida showed the ability to compete early on. But, like last season’s 31-6 loss in Tuscaloosa, Ala., a turnover helped make the dif-ference. 
Courtney Upshaw’s 45-yard inter -
ception return of a Brantley second-quarter pass put the Crimson Tide ahead 17-10. Florida went three-and-out on its next two possessions, and Alabama added another score to make it 24-10. 
Pushing to put points on the board 
before halftime, the Gators drove into the Crimson Tide red zone with less than a minute and a half to play.
But Brantley was sacked on con-
secutive plays, and Florida failed to score as Caleb Sturgis missed his first field goal attempt of the season from 52 yards out.
Brantley was injured on the second 
sack and had to be assisted to the lock-er room. He did not return, and fresh-man Jeff Driskel played the remainder

The Student Government Election Com-
mission upheld the results of the fall Stu -
dent Senate elections at a meeting Friday 
afternoon, despite alleged complications with the new electronic voting system.
The Students Party petitioned to have 
the results nullified on the basis that they are “a severe statistical anomaly,” said Stu-dents Party member Jonathan Ossip at the hearing. At the end of the hearing, Ossip an-
nounced the Students Party’s intention to appeal the decision to the UF Supreme Court. 
The appeal hearing is scheduled for 5:30 
p.m. Monday. 
Supreme Justice Matt Michel said the 
location will be determined this morning. Students will be able to find the finalized hearing details on a notice in the SG office.
The Students Party wants to postpone 
the Student Senate’s Tuesday vote on whether to validate the election results.Senate Minority Leader and Students 
Party member Gillian Leytham filed a com-
plaint with the American Civil Liberties Union of Florida.
Students were able to 
vote for Senate represen-tatives on Tuesday and 
Wednesday. Fall elections are based on students’ ad-dresses, which are catego-
rized by dorms or into districts. 
Students Party members contested the results after they realized there was an in-crease of about 800 percent from last fall in voter turnout for District E, the commuter students’ district. 
Students who had their permanent home 
addresses filed with the registrar rather than their Gainesville addresses would have been placed in District E.
Reitz Union Systems Administrator 
Steve Bourdon said during Friday’s hear -
ing that 491, or about 92 percent, of the 535 District E voters cast their ballots before about 1 p.m. Tuesday. 
At that time, Bourdon changed the loca-

The Florida Innovation 
Hub will receive its first ten-
ant, UF’s Office of Technol-ogy Licensing, on Friday.
Located at 747 SW Second 
Ave., the Innovation Hub is a 48,000-square-foot business incubator designed to house start-up companies grown out of technology developed at UF and around the state. 
“We’re very excited about 
this,” said Jane Muir, associ-ate director of the Office of Technology Licensing.  She said the office is 
working to get the 13 start-up companies that applied for space in the incubator through the approval pro-cess. As of Thursday , eight of them were slated to move into the facility on Oct. 10. 
When it’s complete, In-
novation Square will be a dense, full-service urban community . It will have all the elements of a larger city contained in a smaller space — the area will contain resi-dential housing, a grocery store, hotels, restaurants, re-tail shops and businesses. Construction has not yet 
begun on any buildings oth-er than the Innovation Hub, said Ed Poppell, vice presi-
dent for b u s i n e s s affairs and economic 
develop-ment of In-novation Square.
“Right 
n o w 
Gainesville is a very spread-out community,” Poppell said. “Do you see any tall buildings? No.”Innovation Hub, which 
sits on the 12 acres of land formerly occupied by Shands at AGH, will house start-up science and technology busi-nesses, need more space to expand or have just relocated to Gainesville, Poppell said. 
By nurturing them in-
side the business incubator, he said he hopes to increase their growth and graduate them in one to three years. 
Poppell said construction 
on the next phase of Innova-tion Square, an office build-ing for graduated companies, will begin in early 2012.

Hundreds of butterflies will be re-
leased Oct. 22 and Oct. 23 as part of 
the annual ButterflyFest.
The event is hosted each year by 
the Florida Museum of Natural His-tory to celebrate the migration of hundreds of Monarch butterflies to central Mexico.
The museum is home to one of the world’s largest butterfly collections.
“The festival’s goal is to educate 
the public about the importance of in-sects in our everyday life,” said Lee-ann Bright, marketing and public re-lations coordinator for the museum.
Last year, more than 5,000 people 
attended the festival, Bright said.
All activities will be free, but visi-tors must still pay to enter the But-terfly Rainforest. Tickets for children ages 3-17 are $6. Adult tickets are $10.50, but $9 for Florida residents.
Activities at the festival will in-
clude races, bingo, butterfly releases, plant sales, presentations and work-shops.
“The presentations will inform 
people of the important role of polli-nators in everyday life,” Bright said. 
Naomi Pierce, the Hessel Professor 
of Biology at Harvard University, will be this year’s keynote speaker.

Darlene Pifalo wants to fight for the right to 
tailgate.
Pifalo, a 69-year-old at-large 1 candidate, is 
running for a seat on the City Commission.
A Gainesville resident since 1985, she said she 
wants to run on a campaign of common sense 
that encourages business growth and empowers citizens.
She said she will keep damaging regulations 
that restrict businesses, including those that con-fine gameday tailgating, out of the city.
“I think with the university’s football, the city 
is making a lot of money,” she said.
In August, City Commission staff came up 
with a proposal to limit tailgating in the single-family neighborhoods around UF’s campus. It has since been sent back to a committee for evalu-ation. 
During Saturday’s game, she said, she was 
constantly on the phone with her dad celebrating and grieving. 
And she said she knows there are thousands 
of people in Gainesville doing the same thing.
Born in Campton, N.J., she moved to Ft. Lau-
derdale in the late 1960s. She lived there for 10 years, then moved to Port Charlotte, Fla., for an-other 10 years. 
She said she came to Gainesville for the col-
lege-town feel, and she wants to preserve that.
“The camaraderie of a college town — you 
can’t beat [that],” Pifalo said.
Dressed in red pants, a white dress shirt and 
a red vest with an American flag pin, she also spoke of her commitment to real estate.
Pifalo, a Republican, said it’s a constitutional 
right to own property and said she has been up-holding that right since she got her real estate li-cense in 1973.
Her credentials include membership in the  
Gainesville-Alachua County Association of Real-tors as the political involvement chair.
“My first love is real estate,” she said. “My 
second love is animals.”
At home, she cares for her eight cats: Lucky III, 
Sweetie, Babe, Pretty Boy , Precious, Ms. Magic, Sammy and Ms. Shadow.
Her business card pictures her holding a white 
cat, Mr. Lucky, and reads, “Your Purrrfect Real-tor.”
Pifalo said if she’s elected, she will look closely 
at the biomass plan to see what it costs and how it will affect residents.
The city has been planning for years to build 
the wood-fueled power plant.
“I think all the citizens of Alachua County , not 
just Gainesville, are going to be affected by that,” she said.
Also, she said she wants to encourage citizen 
involvement by giving people who show up at City Hall more than two minutes to speak.
She said she also wants to review the city 
landlord permits to see if there’s any way to re-duce the cost of the permits.
If she hears city staff’s recommendations, 
she’ll ask for input from the city residents, too.
She said she agrees with City Commissioner 
Todd Chase, a city businessman, on many issues and applauds how he asks tough questions of the commission.
She said she doesn’t agree with some of the 
ways the city spends its money, such as a sug-gested $120-million streetcar system.
Although City Commissioner Thomas Hawk-
ins said he’s interested in looking into streetcars as a mass transit idea, the city has not officially decided to finance or build them.
Pifalo said members of the current commis-
sion may disagree with some of her views, but she thinks she’ll be able to work with them to come to a compromise.
“I don’t expect to change anybody’s mind,” 
she said, “but I think sometimes if you ask ques-tions, then questions get answered.”
SG officials blamed discrepancy on user error, uneducated voters
saw before they cast their ballots — to direct students to fill 
out affidavits with their addresses. 
During Friday’s hearing, Students Party members count-
ed nine rules broken by elections staff and SG Supervisor of Elections Toni Megna. Ossip said the broken rules and the 535 students who voted under District E this year, up from only 65 last fall, are cause for an elections redo. 
Megna declined to comment on the Election Commis-
sion’s decision.
Ossip said Sunday that the question is whether students 
cast their ballots for the wrong districts. 
“The blame game is irrelevant,” he said. Ossip said the implication that UF students are not in-
telligent enough to vote properly is “incredibly offensive to students.”
Senate Allocations Committee Chairman Joe Pardo, who 
will represent the Student Senate in the UF Supreme Court hearing, said he thinks any discrepancy is a result of user error.
“I think it should be emphasized that we assume and de-
mocracy assumes a voter is educated,” Pardo said. 
Leytham, a law student, said Florida law mandates that 
in an electronic-ballot election, voters must be able to change anything on the ballots before they actually cast their votes.
UF’s electronic voting did not allow students to go back 
once they had reached the candidate lists for their districts. Thus, students who realized they shouldn’t be seeing the list for District E couldn’t go back at that point.
Ossip said the numbers in District E make it clear that 
there was a problem.
“What’s the harm of an investigation?” he said.4, ALLIGATOR §  MONDAY, OCTOBER 3, 2011

The Murphree Area has got meat. 
More than 250 students and alumni 
gathered around the Murphree Com-mons Courtyard from noon to 4 p.m. Sunday to enjoy about 200 sausages, 80 hotdogs and 50 veggie burgers. 
The Murphree Area Council and 
the area’s RAs served the sausage at the annual SausageFest.
The cookout was free and open to 
the public, but participants could pur -
chase T-shirts for $10 and pie RAs in the face for $1 to help raise money for the Humane Society. Organizers raised about $150, according to Joey Prusa, SausageFest committee chairman and Murphree RA.
“This is a good time for the resi-
dents of Murphree area and all of their friends to come out, enjoy the nice weather and participate in a tradition that’s eight years strong,” said Mur -
phree Area Residence Life Coordina-tor Matt Scruggs.
Visitors splashed around in the big-
gest water slide in the history of Sau-sageFest, and they enjoyed a new ad-dition to the event: snow cones. 
As for the sausage, it was, as de-
scribed by psychology sophomore Claudia Noah as she took a bite from a freshly grilled link, “awesome.”

Get ready. Drop clothes. Run.
The Great Underwear Dash took off at light-
ning speed on campus Friday night as partici-pants stripped down to their underwear and dashed from Turlington Plaza. They avoided running into cars and received hoots and hol-lers from people in midtown as they ran down University Avenue, turned around at Buckman Drive and ended back in Turlington.
More than 1,000 people attended the run, 
which has been a semi-annual school tradition since UF alumnus Beau Bergeron created the first underwear dash in 2005.
Event organizer Josh Kelley , a 20-year-old 
mathematics junior, said tallying the number of attendees is difficult.
At 11:30 p.m., participants threw their clothes 
into a large pile and took off running. 
The clothing will be donated to the Stu-
dent Alumni Association Operation Cover-up Gainesville campaign.
Some girls wore sports bras and shorts and Victoria’s Secret lacy underwear ensembles, and guys donned colorful boxers and man-thongs.  
Greg Accocella, an 18-year-old psychology 
freshman, wore a pair of pink, heart-designed boxer shorts and a purple Victoria’s Secret bra, which he borrowed from some of his female friends.
“It looks dead sexy,” Accocella said. “I’ve 
been receiving a lot of compliments.”
Sophia Akhiyat, a 20-year-old biology junior, 
wore a neon-green body suit and a Bud Light Lime box on her head with holes cut in it so she could see.
“I didn’t actually drink it,” she said. “It was 
green and at my friend’s apartment, so I wore it.”
Kelly Youngquest, a 21-year-old general edu-
cation student at Edison State College, traveled from Punta Gorda, Fla., to attend. Youngquest and her friends rode their unicycles instead of running.
Eighteen-year-old freshmen Justin Kelsey, a 
business management major, and Jacob Turner, a biology major, lit the way for the crowd by wear -
ing yellow hard hats, bow-ties and man-thongs with a shining light attached.
“We wanted to lead the pack,” Kelsey said.For more undie run coverage, visit alligator.

SG moves to validate 
election despite errors
The alleged glitches of the UF Student Government elec-
tions last week and the subsequent behavior of SG offi-cials make Chicago politics appear clean and tidy . 
What the Editorial Board fails to understand is why SG of-
ficials have been so quick to dismiss the results of this election as anything but problematic. 
V oting in District E increased by more than 800 percent this 
semester (535 votes) compared to last fall (65 votes). 
Steven Bourdon, systems administrator of SG and the Reitz 
Union, said this event was nothing more than an “anomaly .” 
Clearly , it is much more than that. Instead, election officials want to blame voter ignorance for 
the problem. 
According to Friday’s edition of the Alligator, “If students 
were placed in District E, their voting screens Tuesday morn-ing would have indicated that. The page also listed each ZIP code not included in District E. Students who noticed zoning errors could select to complete affidavits with their correct ad-dresses.”
In other words, the burden was placed on students to ensure 
they actually lived in a District E ZIP code. 
Fair elections should never place the burden on the voter to 
ensure that the information is correct. 
SG Supervisor of Elections Toni Megna told the Alligator 
“any students that go [to the SG website to check their district] are the ones that are interested in being educated voters.”
Well, that didn’t sound condescending. You cannot expect that every voter will check to make sure 
he or she is voting in the correct district before the election. 
This situation really has nothing to do with party identifica-
tion or corruption in SG. The main problem with this whole is-sue is nothing but pure laziness. 
Any responsible governing body would admit that a mis-
take occurred and would do everything it could to fix the error. By blaming the voters and playing off the entire situation as an “anomaly,” officials show that they do not care about the fair -
ness and equity of the election process. 
Instead of completely trying to push the situation under the 
rug, the Unite Party should have come out in favor of investigat-ing these results with a louder voice than the Students Party . That would have been a responsible public relations move, shin-ing a new light on the party commonly accused of corruption. 
Instead, the Unite Party opted to try to hush the entire situ-
ation and is looking to validate the results on Tuesday . Party members just want to move on with their lives as if nothing hap-pened. 
As we said in Friday’s Darts and Laurels, what harm would 
there be in checking the results? The Unite Party would have swept the elections either way , but at least it could have done so with a clear conscience. 
Social Security depletes government funds
A few weeks ago, presidential candidate and Texas 
Gov. Rick Perry called Social Security a Ponzi scheme and was labeled as a far-right extremist. 
While his choice of words was indelicate, Social Security is a deeply flawed system that will not exist in its current form for anyone in college right now.
Social Security payments account for about 21 percent 
of all government spending. Though its trust fund is not projected to run out until 2037, this figure is misleading because the government routinely borrows from the fund to pay for other budgetary items. In other words, if the bond markets ever decide to punish us for having such a high debt to gross domestic product ratio, Social Security Trust money is not as safe as it is purported to be. 
When the program was started in 1935, citizens started 
receiving benefits at age 65, and the average life expectan-cy was 66. This demographic reality meant the program was essentially an insurance program against living much longer than the rest of the population. Social Security was able to pull countless seniors out of poverty and gave them the assurance that the government would help take care of them in the midst of a depression. If you judge a program by how well it achieved its objectives, this version of So-cial Security worked. 
Now the average life expectancy is 77.8. Social Security 
has gone from an old-age insurance program to a national pension. Billions of dollars in taxes are taken out of pro-ductive use to be forcibly lent to the government so people who failed to plan adequately for their retirement can be taken care of. 
Furthermore, Social Security is, indirectly, a wealth re-
distribution program from black males to white females. I use this example because, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the average life expectan-cy for black males is 70.2, and for white females it’s 80.6. White women can expect to collect hundreds of thousands of dollars more than other demographic groups because of their gene pool. Moreover, black males tend to be more economically disadvantaged than white females, making the payroll tax used to fund it quite regressive. Social Security pays out dis-
ability claims on top of pensions. As I was flipping channels re-cently, I watched a woman on “Divorce Court” brag about how she made more money in child support and her son’s Social Se-curity disability payments than her husband did working at his construction job. While I was 
waiting to pick up a prescription at Walgreens, I discov-ered after chatting with a man in line that he was on full Social Security disability for a back injury he sustained in construction. Instead of working a less physical job, he is now on the government’s welfare roll for the rest of his life. 
In total, 8 million people receive Social Security dis-
ability payments. I find it hard to believe that even half of these people are so incapacitated that they cannot work in some form of a job. Besides disability payments, children of seniors receive hundreds of dollars a month just for ex-isting. This path is clearly unsustainable.
Our generation must prepare for a lower standard of 
living because of the payments demanded by the genera-tions above us. Eventually interest payments on the debt will force us to make hard decisions that won’t involve el-ders alive today. The federal government currently spends $7 on the elderly for every $1 it spends on those under 18. This imbalance is pathetic. 
America can continue to be the most powerful country 
in the world, but we must accept that attempts to promote equality limit future growth, lowering everyone’s stan-dard of living in the long run. 
Regardless of if it means raising the retirement age, 
making participation in Social Security optional, or allow-ing some form of private investment accounts, something must be done so that our future government has money to pay for public goods besides drug benefits for Grandma.

understanding the electronic voting sys-tem during the SG election?Today’s question: Did you strip down for the Great 
Underwear Dash? MONDAY, OCTOBER 3, 2011 § ALLIGATOR, 7
The term “big government” has been loosely bandied 
about for several decades. Certainly it has been used to point out the over-spending by elected officials and their 
entities, something that now not only disturbs many of those in the higher tax bracket but also many people hurting in today’s staggering economy.
During this presidential election year, as in others in the re-
cent past, Republicans especially will use these words in hopes of getting votes. Some might call it scare tactics designed to trick the white poor and middle-class to actually vote against their own interests through fear. 
How many dollars spent and governmental programs are 
too many, and where should one draw the line? Is it too ex-pensive to provide every American who needs assistance with basic necessities like food, shelter, education and health care? Is this what makes government too big, and is this where we are going wrong?
Although many people would be hard-pressed to really de-fine how big is too big for government, they will hear this phrase and imme-diately be filled with rage, especially  toward Democrats and those who re-ceive some kind of governmental as-
sistance. But the question that should naturally occur to any thoughtful person is: What does the phrase “big government” really mean?
Try posing that question to your average anti-big-govern-
ment tea party enthusiast. An awkward moment may follow that question because many tea party members would  prob-ably be showing strain on their faces in an  effort to do some-thing quite different from engaging in their usual blind rage: namely, critical thinking.
It just seems to me, to borrow a phrase from George Carlin, 
that the American people should not be worried about big gov-ernment but rather corrupt government. I don’t know about you, but government used against the interests of the general population for the gain of a few wealthy interests is indeed cor -
rupt. One needs to look no further than tax loopholes that en-able a huge profit machine like General Electric Co. to pay no taxes and the military industrial complex.
The American people should really start thinking critically 
about how they have been manipulated to vote against their own interests through the brainwashing box called the tele-vision that hasn’t reported real news since the retirement of Edward R. Murrow. Yes, that’s an exaggeration, but it is none-theless closer to the truth than how politicians and greedy cor -
porate interests have deceptively used the phrase big govern-ment to procure what they want from the corrupt system.
Yes, corrupt government is more like it. Corrupt govern-
ment means a government used by interests outside the in-terests of the American people for the purposes of corporate greed. Government should be as big as it needs to be. No less and no more.

Corrupt government a bigger threat than big governmentGuest column

Speaking Out
Since the ‘90s, it’s been a common right-
wing practice to have a bake sale in-tended to demonstrate the inherent 
unfairness of using race as a factor in col-lege admissions. White men get charged $2 for the brownies or muffins the Republicans baked to prove their point, while other races get charged a sliding scale based on the Re-publican protesters’ perception of the sever -
ity of racial bias against different groups. 
For instance, women might get discounts 
of 25 cents, Asians 50 cents, blacks a whole dollar, and Native Americans would get the baked goods for free. Never mind the strange hierarchy of discrimination (or repressed guilt); this doesn’t make sense even if you are a pro-market ideologue.
Here’s why: A fair market value is how 
much a willing seller and a willing purchas-er will agree to exchange. This is the basis of arm’s-length business dealings, and it is ide-ally how things are priced. 
But arm’s-length doesn’t imply blind, and 
a smart baker will charge different prices to different people based on their ability to pay. Any white person who has traveled to Africa is familiar with this concept. While living in Tanzania, I frequently attempted to bargain with stall vendors. I had some successes in that I didn’t always end up paying the first price offered. But I could never, even as my Swahili improved, get close to the prices that my Tanzanian friends paid. And I noticed that even among my Tanzanian friends, prices weren’t equal. Most stall vendors ap-peared to have a miraculous intuitive grasp of how much money another Tanzanian per -
son had, and rich Tanzanians, though they never paid as much as I did, paid more than their poorer counterparts.
It makes sense from the stall vendor’s 
perspective. If he has sufficient inventory, he should sell all that he can at whatever margin he can and not wait to make a sale at the best price. Yes, you might argue, but someone might undercut him and sell at a lower price to everyone. This would be more efficient, right? And surely rich people should be de-manding this, right? Of course this happens.
What does this have to do with affirma-
tive action? To start, college admissions are not essentially an exchange process. If the only thing universities were thinking about in the admissions process was their endow-ments, they would only admit the rich-est students because not only is wealth a good predictor of 
academic success, it is also a good predictor of future wealth. 
The problem with viewing universities’ 
admission policies through an exchange lens is that they have values that have nothing to do with exchange. They seek to recreate and improve society, to grow goodwill and to protect their public image, and they often have a have a social agenda that values a di-verse learning environment. 
To go back to the original metaphor, uni-
versities see it as part of their job to make sure that brownies are available to everyone. From a university’s perspective, it makes perfect sense to lower barriers for people whose admission will help them further pro-mote these other goals. Seen in this light, you could even say that it was fair.
Furthermore, even if universities used a 
strict merit approach, not every university would fill their total enrollment, and then, of course, it would make sense to have different standards to fill the remainder of their open spots. But the Supreme Court has made it clear that universities can’t have race-based set-asides. The court has taken the view that any government action that is based upon race (as opposed to merely considering race) is precluded by the Constitution. 
If this seems like a strange reading of the 
Fourteenth Amendment’s (that’s the amend-ment that made ex-slaves citizens) equal protections clause to you, don’t worry; you aren’t alone. But, the argument goes, if the school had used a strict approach, someone else would have gotten in and deserved it more. The argument forgets that a university has other values besides numbers and that universities know from experience that the numbers don’t always prove merit; they of-ten merely reflect inequalities.
The bottom line is that universities’ ad-
missions people should consider race in ad-missions just like they should consider class, geography and a multitude of other quali-ties. If they didn’t, they wouldn’t be doing their jobs.

Ponce de Leon is dead.
The Spanish conquistador’s 
death knell has been scribbled onto the backs of at least seven chairs in Turlington Hall along with an-nouncements that the Chamber of Secrets has been opened and some-one named Will was at one time present.
Students in Weimer Hall’s Gan-
nett Auditorium attend the “Uni-versity of Flopida,” according to the sign on the lectern, while students at Library West publicly bemoan their lack of friends, lack of sex lives or lack of knowledge of organic chem-istry on the study carrels and tables throughout the library.
Though most of the vandalism 
is minor — a fraternity name here, a heart and initials there — it has ac-cumulated over the years. 
“I think expression is essential,” 
said Cary Putnal, a 24-year-old phi-losophy junior.
Sometimes it can even be helpful 
or inspirational.
Chairs in Little Hall boast math 
theorems, and Putnal said a run-ning debate on chaos and control can be found in a men’s bathroom in Matherly.
He’s also found the line “All 
power to the imagination” scrawled on a bathroom stall in the Reitz Union.
“There’s a big distinction be-
tween creative graffiti and ignorant, mindless stuff,” said Steven Kanner, a 20-year-old environmental science junior.
Others, like economics major 
Matthew Schaler and mechanical and aerospace engineering major Kyle Gooding, both 20-year-old juniors, think the “mindless stuff” can add a little something to a class, even if it’s just a smile.
Stuff like a supply-and-demand 
graph on another Matherly bath-room stall analyzing the cost of, well, whatever’s produced in a bath-room stall.
Curtis Reynolds, assistant vice 
president of the UF Physical Plant Division, said there aren’t any rou-tine checks for vandalism of campus buildings.
Signs and desks are replaced 
once they are no longer functional and on an as-needed basis, he said.
Reporting those types of incidents 
is the responsibility of the college or department that owns the building. Reynolds said if an act of vandalism is considered to be particularly de-facing or debilitating, the University Police Department should be noti-fied before the Physical Plant. 
He said he’s not aware of much 
vandalism on campus, and there haven’t been any recent incidents that have required police involve-ment.
“I think the students who come 
to our university take a level of pride in their campus and their facilities,” he said.8, ALLIGATOR §  MONDAY, OCTOBER 3, 2011

Quarterback John Brantley left Saturday’s game late in the second quarter with a reported ankle 
sprain and did not return. Freshman Jeff Driskel replaced him and played the second half.
�FRESHMAN JEFF DRISKEL 
WOULD START AGAINST LSU IF BRANTLEY CAN’T PLAY.

When John Brantley entered the 
locker room prematurely, Florida’s un-
derlying fears bubbled to the surface.
The adversity came on a Saturday 
night in front of a national TV audi-ence. It was the end of the first half, and Brantley had just absorbed a body blow, a KO.
The Saturday, of course, was two 
weeks ago — a 48-10 victory at Ken-tucky. The injury Brantley sustained did minimal damage — a hard hit to the midsection. He was only held out for much of the rest of the game as a precaution. The opponent was, after all, Kentucky. Florida was already up by three touchdowns.
Still, that moment raised questions. 
What would happen if Brantley was knocked out for good? Was his back-up, freshman Jeff Driskel, prepared to face Alabama in the Southeastern Con-ference’s trial by fire?
“I’ve got all the confidence in the 
world in Jeff,” coach Will Muschamp said after the Kentucky game. “All the confidence in the world.”
Muschamp showed that confidence for 30 minutes Saturday, as Driskel took all of Florida’s snaps in the sec-ond half. For the second week in a row, Brantley exited a game with an injury. This time, the injury appears more se-rious.  
Dropping back on a third-and-20 
with 45 seconds left in the half, Brant-ley was hit from the blind side by Ala-bama linebacker Courtney Upshaw. Brantley’s right leg bent back as he was slammed to the ground, and the quar-terback was noticeably in pain as soon as he hit the grass.
The extent of the injury was not 
known Saturday night — Muschamp only let on it was to Brantley’s “lower leg” — but reports have surfaced that he suffered a high ankle sprain.  
Driskel entered the stage facing a 24-
10 deficit, and his appearance brought a mix of anxiety and excitement. 
As a senior at Oviedo Hagerty High, 
Driskel was the No. 1 quarterback prospect in the nation, according to Ri-vals.com. At the same time, he is still a freshman — prodigy or not — and he was staring down the No. 3 defense in the nation. 
In those 30 minutes at Florida Field, 
Driskel looked far from the hyped quarterback of the future. In those 30 minutes, Florida’s offense managed just 46 yards and two first downs.

After four weeks of dominating 
inferior opponents, the Florida rush-
ing attack ran into a buzz saw against Alabama. 
The senior running back duo of 
Chris Rainey and Jeff Demps aver -
aged 182.8 yards per game in the first month of the season, but combined for just 8 against the Crimson Tide. 
“It was very frustrating,” Demps 
said. “It was hard to really get in the groove [Saturday], so we’ll just kind of slow it down. We’re just going to look at it as motivation from here on out.”
The Gators ran for minus-17 yards in the first half and 15 for the game. Only a 31-yard rush by freshman quarterback Jeff Driskel kept UF’s rushing total in the black. 
Coach Will Muschamp said Ala-
bama’s large lead and the injury to 
senior quar -
terback John B r a n t l e y made it more 
difficult to run the ball consistently and effectively . 
While big leads in the first four 
contests allowed Demps and Rainey to carry the ball 24.3 times per game, the large deficit against Alabama lim-ited them to a combined 14 carries.

Will Muschamp said it best Saturday night: The Gators simply got beat by a better team.
No. 17 Florida came out swinging against 
No. 2 Alabama in The Swamp, but the over -
matched Gators just couldn’t withstand the blows from a true heavyweight team.
Alabama was bigger, stronger and more 
physical than Florida in a 38-10 blowout, con-trolling the line of scrimmage on both sides of the ball. 
The Tide did to Florida what Florida did to 
FAU, UAB, Tennessee and Kentucky, showing the Gators they aren’t among the nation’s elite right now.
Alabama made Florida’s then-fifth-ranked 
rush defense look nonexistent, as Trent Rich-ardson plowed over defenders and through arm tackles, dragging Gators for yards at a time en route to a career day.
But what Richardson and Alabama’s of-
fense did Saturday night shouldn’t be Flori-da’s biggest concern, nor should the injury to quarterback John Brantley’s knee, or ankle, or whatever part of his right leg bent the wrong way in the second quar -
ter.
The Gators’ biggest 
concern after a demor -
alizing loss to the Tide (again) should be the team’s inability to run the ball against a good 
defense.
Which quarterback takes the snaps in the 
Florida offense doesn’t matter so much as the success of the guys who take the handoffs, and offensive coordinator Charlie Weis said as much after Florida’s season opener against FAU.
With Florida up big in that game, and the 
outcome well in hand, Jeff Driskel relieved Brantley because the coaches said they want-ed to get him meaningful playing time. 
But the Gators rarely threw the ball with 
Driskel in the game because Weis wanted to pound the rock. 
Florida’s identity is a run-first, smash-
mouth team, and Weis wanted to make sure Deficiencies exposed in blowout

Tom Green and Maegan Dennis / Alligator StaffLoss to Crimson Tide second worst at home in last 30 years 
of the game.
But even with Brantley , the 
Gators didn’t have much of a chance 
at stopping Alabama and Richard-son. He ran through Gators defend-ers all evening, totaling a career-high 181 yards and two touchdowns on 29 carries. After the game, Florida defenders could do nothing but lev-el praise Richardson’s way.
“He’s a tough running back, 
that’s why he’s a Heisman candi-date,” defensive tackle Omar Hunt-er said. “Give him a lot of credit, he did a great job, him and his offensive line.”
Said linebacker Jelani Jenkins: 
“He’s definitely a back who we’re going to see at the next level.”
Defensive tackle Jaye Howard 
was also impressed, calling Richard-son “a great player,” and saying, “it takes more than one person to bring him down.”
Leading up to the game, Mus-
champ and seemingly every player on the Florida defense talked about the importance of tackling. They talked about how impressive Rich-ardson was with the ball in his hands.
Muschamp said, without ques-
tion, the combination of Richard-son and fellow running back Eddie Lacy would be the toughest test the Gators’ young defense had seen.
They were right.“It was a matter of missed tack-
les,” defensive lineman Sharrif Floyd said. “We got to do a better job of wrapping up and swarming to the ball.”
Even when the defenders ap-
peared to have Richardson wrapped up, which wasn’t often, the bruising back eluded their grasp.
Early in the fourth quarter of a 
two-score game, Howard was in the backfield in position to stop Rich-ardson for a loss. But Richardson cut left, shaking the arm tackle from Howard, and galloped into the end zone to put the game out of reach at 31-10.
Alabama coach Nick Saban at-
tributed the win and success of Richardson to the offensive line. An experienced unit returning four starters from a season ago, the Crim-son Tide offensive line was in com-mand from the start.
Seeing it first hand all night, 
Howard admitted as much after -
ward.
“The defensive line, we didn’t 
control the line of scrimmage,” Howard said. “There were times we looked good, and there were times when they ran right through us. We got to come back and correct that.”
As a team, the Crimson Tide 
racked up 226 yards on the ground — just 4 yards shy of the 230-yard 
average with 
which they en-tered the game, trailing only Flor -
ida for best in the conference.
But the Gators 
ran for just 15 yards in the sec-ond-worst loss at 
home in the last 30 years. Saturday’s 28-point loss is behind only the 36-7 defeat against LSU in 2002. Saban was the coach in both.
Alabama is now 8-2 in The 
Swamp — the best record of any SEC opponent.
“We put so much into this one,” 
Hunter said. “I really wanted it. I feel like I put everything in this off-season just for this game. ... To come up short is disappointing, but we’ll get through it.”

Gators tight end Jordan Reed had a team-high five receptions against Alabama for 
31 yards. It was Reed’s first game back after missing the last two weeks with an injury sustained in the UAB game on Sept. 10. 
Debose catches first TD in loss; Saunders suspended; Reed returns
business as usual for the Crimson Tide, which 
boasts by far the nation’s No. 1 rush defense, al-lowing just 39.6 yards per game. Second-place Virginia Tech allows 58.2 yards per game. 
“We heard a lot about their offense and it 
being number one, and their running game is supposed to be the best,” Alabama senior line-backer Courtney Upshaw said. 
“We just wanted to come out and prove 
what we could do.”
Debose making noise: Although the Florida 
wide receivers were almost invisible through the first four weeks of the season, sophomore Andre Debose needed just a single snap to make their presence felt. 
On the game’s first offensive play, Debose 
lined up split out to the left and streaked past Alabama cornerback Dre Kirkpatrick. 
Brantley hit him in stride and Debose did 
the rest, strolling into the end zone for a 65-yard touchdown, the first touchdown reception of his career. 
The single catch more than doubled De-
bose’s yardage total for the season. 
He came into the game with five catches for 
64 yards. Debose left Florida’s game against Tennes-
see due to injury and did not play against Ken-tucky, but Muschamp liked what he saw from him in practice. 
“Andre’s done a good job,” Muschamp said. 
“He’s practiced hard. … Very pleased with his progress.”
Saunders suspended: For the first time this 
season, freshman safety De’Ante “Pop” Saun-ders did not start Saturday. 
Muschamp said Saunders was suspended 
for violating team rules and that he’d be back next week.
Junior Josh Evans started in his place. Demps banged up: Demps said he was mo-
mentarily hurt after a kick return in the first quarter, but that he was “fine” postgame. 
He said he fell on his left knee and felt a little 
discomfort, but that it “wasn’t that serious.”
All three of Demps’ carries happened after 
the injury. 
Reed returns: After missing Florida’s match-
ups against Tennessee and Kentucky with a lower-body injury, sophomore tight end Jordan Reed returned to action against Alabama. 
He caught a game-high five passes for 31 
yards.

Teammates have confidence in freshman quarterback Driskel
pass attempts. He looked uncomfortable in 
the pocket, scrambling unsuccessfully on a pair of third-and-longs and taking one sack. He fumbled a snap.
Florida’s offensive ineptitude put too 
much weight on its renewed defense, which stopped Alabama on three straight drives after halftime. Staying on the field for 18:40 in the second half, though, the defense even-tually wore out, not that players blamed the new quarterback.
“We have faith in Driskel; it’s not like 
he went in and everybody put their heads down,” defensive end Sharrif Floyd said. 
“No, it’s not like that. We’ve seen Driskel. We know what Driskel can do.”
That was the theme among players after 
Florida’s 38-10 loss: confidence in Driskel. This week, Florida faces LSU — the No. 9 
defense in the nation. If Driskel has to start, the Gators are cool with that.
“We tell him all the time, ‘We trust you, 
man, so just go out there and be you,’” wide receiver Andre Debose said. “Driskel’s a great player.”

his offense would be able to run it when it absolutely 
needed to.
Well, the Gators needed to run it Saturday — and they 
weren’t able to at all.
Chris Rainey and Jeff Demps, who have done every-
thing on offense for Florida this season, were swallowed by a hungry Alabama defense. 
Alabama dominated Florida’s offensive line, limiting the Gators to half a yard per carry on 29 attempts and recording three sacks on the night. The holes created for Florida’s running backs in the first four games weren’t there Saturday night, and Demps and Rainey couldn’t 
break runs to the outside because of Alabama’s team speed.
Florida’s run game worked 
against its first four opponents be-cause the Gators were bigger and 
the running backs were faster. 
That wasn’t the case against Alabama. It won’t be the case against No. 1 LSU this weekend. It might not even be the case against the remaining 
teams on the Gators’ schedule, outside of Furman and Vanderbilt.
While Alabama was clearly the superior team in The 
Swamp, if Florida can’t establish itself in the running game moving forward, Muschamp will find himself re-peating his opening statement from Saturday.
“We got beat by a better team tonight.”Contact Tom Green at tgreen@alligator.org.toM , from page 14“We have faith in Driskel; it’s not
