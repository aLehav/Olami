Students rally in rain for
public health care option
By JARED MISNER
Alligator Writer
A little rain didn't ruin this rally.
In the aftermath of the Senate Finance Com-
mittee's approval of legislation to revamp the
country's current health care system, the UF
College Democrats and the Alachua County
Young Democrats held a rainy rally Wednes-
day on the Plaza of the Americas.
"We really hope to show Congress that
young people care about and want health care
reform," said Ben Cavataro, UF College Dem-
ocrats' vice president for political affairs.
Gainesville city commissioner and mayoral
candidate Craig Lowe also took the micro-
phone. Lowe spoke without the protection of
an umbrella, and his words were frequently
cut short by the echoing microphone.
"Health care reform is definitely something
that benefits all of us, regardless if we're in
good health or bad health," Lowe said. "It's
something that impacts the economy. It's
something that affects our ability to do the
best we can."
As Lowe concluded his speech, the
Gainesville city commissioner asked rally
participants to demand a public health option
from their representatives in Washington.The Senate Finance Committee's version of
the health care legislation, which Sen. Bill Nel-
son, D-Fla., voted to pass Tuesday, does not
include a public option. The approval readies
the bill for the floors of the House and Senate
and faces heated Republican opposition.
Bryan Griffin, chairman of UF College Re-
publicans, said the current legislation pro-
vides little oversight.
"Any reform that goes
through with the public op-
tion, we as conservatives and
Republicans cannot support,"
he said, citing veterans and
government-run hospitals as
some of most imperfect in
the country.
Cavataro Eric Conrad, editorial
chair of UF College Demo-
crats, reminded students that just because
the Senate Finance Committee approved the
health care bill does not mean the yet-to-be-
finalized plan is in the clear.
"We can't stand by and let [our elected of-
ficials] decide how we live," Conrad said.
As the rain wore down to a drizzle and
the rally ended, Ferdaouis Bagga, UF College

Man drops shades,

A local man ran his father's Chevy Silverado 1500 into the
back of an RTS bus on Southwest 20th Avenue at 3:30 p.m.
Wednesday.
Shane Chiarell, 32, said he had just turned out of the Sweet-
bay parking lot and was driving west when his
Local sunglasses fell off his head. He bent down to
N ews pick them up without realizing that the bus in
front of him had stopped until it was too late.
When asked if he'd been injured, Chiarell said, "Physi-
cally, no. Mentally, yeah. My dad's gonna kill me."
By the time police arrived, the bus passengers had left the
scene, presumably uninjured, said GPD officer Al Moore,
who responded to the scene.
Chiarell said he was driving about 30 mph when the crash
happened.
The front end of the truck took the brunt of the damage
and had to be towed from the street. The bus appeared to be
undamaged.

HEALTH CARE
Senators prepare to merge bills
By ROBERT HARRINGER
Alligator Contributing Writer
The Senate Finance Committee
passed its version of health care
legislation without a public option
Tuesday.
Only one Republican, Sen. Cyn-
thia Snow of Maine, joined the com-
mittee's 13 Democrats to pass the
legislation in a 14-9 vote.
Andre Koop, a biology junior,
wasn't supportive of the commit-
tee's bill, but was glad it didn't in-
clude a public option.
"I'm against the public option
because it would take away free-
dom from the doctors," Koop said.
Nearly 63 percent of physicians
support a public option, according
to a Robert Wood Johnson Founda-
tion study.
Health care reform now falls into
the hands of Majority Leader Harry
Reid, D-Nev., who will merge the
Finance Committee's bill with the
Health, Education, Labor and Pen-sion Committee's proposal, which
includes a public option.
Cynthia Braasch, a UF sopho-
more, hopes the final version has a
public option.
"I'm against the public
option because it would
take away freedom from
the doctors."
Andre Koop
UFjunior
Her father was provided insur-
ance though his work, but for many
years of her life, she and her siblings
went uncovered due to cost.
"Everyone deserveshealthcare'
Braasch said. "I think it's a right."
Democrats, with the indepen-
dents who caucus with them, have
60 members in the senate, enough to
block a filibuster. However, some,
like Sen. Joe Lieberman, I-Conn.,
said they will not vote for a final bill
similar to the Finance Committee's.

Be DeterminedAccording to a press release
issued by the committee's chair-
man, Sen. Max Baucus, D-Mont.,
the committee's proposal prevents
insurance companies from dis-
criminating against people based
on health status, denying coverage
because of pre-existing conditions
or imposing annual caps or lifetime
limits on coverage.
The bill would also establish a
mandate for most legal residents to
obtain health insurance and signifi-
cantly expand eligibility for Medic-
aid.
The nonpartisan Congressional
Budget Office determined the bill
would result in an $81 billion net
reduction in the federal budget
deficit.
Some Democrats and Republi-
cans are unhappy with a new tax
included in the bill.
Cadillac Insurance Plans, those
with premiums costing more than
$8,000 for individuals and $21,000
for families, would be taxed.

Editorial
Jailed Gymnast
Lack of logic put
Sinclair behind bars
fter UF gymnast Melanie Sinclair's arrest Tuesday,
a lot of questions remain unanswered.
The nine-time All-American gymnast found
herself tangled in the web of the Gainesville Police Depart-
ment's crackdown on a local burglary and gun-dealing
ring.
It seems implausible at best that a standout college ath-
lete, who by virtue is expected to set a moral example for
the student population, finds herself on the business end of
three felony charges.
But let's pause before we lump Sinclair in with the others
involved in this crime ring and think about how someone
with so much to lose even gets into this sort of situation.
In a convoluted, murky chain of events, police used
taped phone conversations between Sinclair and her two-
time felon of a boyfriend, Bud Williams, 21, to trace the sto-
len goods. Williams told the gymnast to deny any knowl-
edge of the nine firearms that were apparently stashed
in her home at Brandywine Apartments, 2811 SW Archer
Road.
It's a shame that Sinclair's boyfriend didn't have the
foresight to realize he didn't have the luxury of privacy in,
you know, jail.
But this is the same guy who was arrested earlier this
month for brandishing a loaded shotgun around his apart-
ment complex, so realizing the consequences of actions
are clearly not his strong point. In fact, he was in jail on
11 counts of possession of a firearm by a convicted felon,
one count of armed burglary and two counts of grand theft
from a dwelling.
It's hard to imagine what it must be like to be in Sin-
clair's position, and it's even harder to imagine how she
got there.
It seems strange that Sinclair, who has been a standout
gymnast on UF's highly competitive gymnastics team,
would leave practice at the end of the day, sweaty and cov-
ered in chalk, and drive to a home full of stolen guns and
a cracked safe.
It's hard to imagine her waking in the morning and
walking past a stack of ripped-off computers and not ques-
tioning how they got there.
Sinclair told police she knew something was wrong
with the activities going on in her apartment, but didn't
know what it was.
While we would love to give her the benefit of the doubt,
we find it hard to believe that Sinclair wouldn't have at
least wondered about the mysterious stash of high-ticket
items accumulating in her house.
And with a boyfriend who has past felony convictions,
we think this may be a classic case of someone getting in
with the wrong crowd and losing sight of her goals for the
sake of her social life.
Additionally, her boyfriend even offered her a pearl
necklace from the safe, according to the police report. It is
at this point that Sinclair should have put on her thinking
cap and realized that her boyfriend may have been up to
no good.
Either way, we feel bad for Sinclair, who has been sus-
pended from the team indefinitely and is being held with-
out bail.

Mystery tale, thriller keeps audience in suspense
Attiyya Anthony
avenue writer
Carpet. Envelope. Wallpaper.
Cigarette. Jelly.
Does that make any sense? Am I
the crazy one, or are you?
Friday at 8 p.m. the pieces will
fall into place at the Hippodrome
during Anthony Horowitz's play,
"Mindgame."
"Mindgame" is a psychodrama
filled to the brim with serial killers,
intrigue, sex, bondage and vio-
lence.
The cast of characters includes
a true crime journalist named Mark
Styler, played by Tod Zimmerman;
Easterman, the serial killer whose
tale holds the key to Styler's next
big story; Dr. Farquhar, an eccen-
tric and contradictory psychiatrist,
played by David Sitler; and Nurse
Plimpton, played by Sara Morsey."It is all about the nature of
perception. What we see is not al-
ways what we get," director Lauren
Caldwell said.
The play is set in an office at the
Fairfields Institute for the Criminally
Insane. As the story progresses,
Styler realizes that no one can be
trusted, no one knows who they are,
and nothing is as it seems, not even
things he witnesses with his own
eyes.
"Once you see the twists and the
turns and everything else, it's a real
roller coaster ride. It's a lot of fun,"
said Sitler, who also performed as
Neil in "The Pursuit of Happiness"
on the Hippodrome stage and trav-
eled with Broadway's "Frost/Nixon."
"I was sold on my first line."
The script is Quentin Tarantino-
inspired. There are songs from
"Pulp Fiction," moments that re-
mind you of "Reservoir Dogs" and"Kill Bill"-esque abuse that doesn't
cease throughout the play.
Bottles are broken on the backs
of heads, scalpels come dangerous-
ly close to faces and the heat from
lit cigarettes threatens the flesh.
"It is all about the nature of
perception. What we see is not
always what w z gt."
LAUREN CALDWELL
hippodrome director
"The script is just a framework.
This is our show; we don't know how
it's done in New York or anywhere
else." Caldwell said. "The music
choices, the staging, the actor's in-
tentions, the characters and all that,
that comes from our own show."
"I'm in rehearsal making choices
and seeing what works and what
doesn't -it's the process of com-ing up with who I am," Zimmerman
said.
In true mind game spirit, the sto-
ry ends, but somehow it doesn'tfeel
like it's finished. The cat is still chas-
ingthe mouse once the curtains are
closed.
Caldwell's goal is not to tell us
what to think, only to get our syn-
apses working.
"If four people walk out and they
have four different opinions, they'd
have something to talk about over
a glass of wine," she said. "If that's
what you think, then that's what
happened. The conclusions are your
decisions."
Tickets are $30 on opening
night, and reduced pricing for each
night after. There is an advance
screening tonight that costs $12 for
students and $15 for adults.
"The play's not finished until the
audience is here," Sitler said.Mindgame Events

FSF opens doors to fashion world
By MARY MANCHESS the fashion arts and business. They
avenue writer award about 8 h It 000 schnirshins
Being surrounded by executives
from high-end fashion labels such
as Ralph Lauren, Kenneth Cole and
Tommy Hilfiger is every fashionista's
nirvana.
Krista Boyer, a senior marketing
major, got a chance to rub elbows with
these fashion powerhouses in April
when she won the Fashion Scholar-
ship Fund's $5,000 scholarship.
"I was actually in the car on the
way to the beach over Spring Break
when I found out," she said. "It was a
great addition to that week."
According to its Web site, the FSF
is a national nonprofit association
consisting of influential members
from the fashion community who are
dedicated to promoting education of,
annually and provide internship op-
portunities and career guidance for
students.
Boyer used her winnings to live in
New York City over the summer and
intern with Tommy Hilfiger, an op-
portunity that the FSF set up for her.
About 20 or 30 different companies
participate in the internship program.
"At Tommy Hilfiger, they have this
huge apparel closet where celebri-
ties come and get clothes for photo
shoots," she said.
"Katy Perry came in a couple of
times, and some of us were like, 'Is
that who I think it is?"'
This opportunity for Boyer has
been surreal because prior to enter-
ing college, she wanted to go to de-
sign school but wasn't accepted. Her

Krista Boyer with Tommy H ilfiger at the YMA Fashion Scholarship Fund intern social at
the Tommy Hilfiger store in SoHoparents then encouraged her to go to
business school at UF
"I really wish every person on this
campus would apply," Boyer said. "It
opened a lot of doors I didn't think
were accessible, and I have met so
many high-end executives that have
personally given me their card and
said, 'Send me your resume when
you graduate."'
While UF doesn't have a fashion
design or merchandising program,
the FSF still recognizes the David F.
Miller Center for Retailing Education
and Research as an important com-
ponent of the fashion industry.
According to FSF administrator
Debra Malbin, the FSF doesn't re-
quire applicants to be majoring in
fashion design but to have a passion-
ate interest that they could invest in
the industry.
"We are looking to get the best
and the brightest who want to be in
the fashion industry, and we try to
help groom their careers and get
them involved in the business to be-
come new leaders," Malbin said.
"We want the students who apply
to the FSF to be liberal arts majors,
math majors, business majors, in
the fashion industry or whatever, we
don't care. We just want to have our
next group of leaders in the fashion
industry."
Boyer is graduating in May, and
she already has two possible job op-
portunities with Tommy Hilfiger and
Neiman Marcus.
"In this economy, having the pos-
sibility of multiple job opportunities
for just winning a scholarship speaks
for itself," she said. "It has changed
my life."
Now Boyer is applyingfor the FSF's
Geoffrey Beene National Scholarship,
which awards $25,000 to four recipi-
ents.
All students applying must have
been previous recipients of the
$5,000 scholarship. They must also
write a 20-page research paper on
how to deal with the changing con-
sumer in reference to men and wom-
en's sports lines.
Boyer isn't sure what she would do
with the money if she won the schol-
arship, but in the future she would
like to start her own store that would
produce a unique retail format and
compete with companies like H&M.THURSDAY, OCTOBER 15, 2009 +ALLIGATOR, 9
Band creates song
for Gator Growl
By ASHLEY ROSS
freelance editor
KSipping a Blue Moon and
munching on sweet potato
fries on the front lawn of the
Swamp Restaurant wouldn't be
nearly as enjoyable without the
charming sound of two cute
guitar-playing guys strumming
and singing to some of your fa-
vorite songs.
Between Swamp Fridays,
this year's Gator Growl tal-
ent night winner, will open for
headliner O.A.R. on Friday with
their first original single, "Uni-
versity Avenue. "
While band members Chris
Blackburn and James Dein-
inger, both UF seniors in the
business school, have known
each other since preschool,
they didn't start collaborating
until late into the college expe-
rience.
"About a year ago we just
said, hey, we can do whatthose
guys at Swamp do," Blackburn
said.
The two learned a set of
popular songs and played a
demo for the managers at
Swamp.
Since then, they've been
playing regularly to excited
football fans, girls in sun-
dresses and returning alumni
on Mondays, Wednesdays and
Fridays.
Deininger, who plays elec-
tric guitar, said the band almost
missed talent night because
of misreading the date on the
Web site.
"We thought talent night
was a week later than it ac-
tually was," Deininger said.
"When we realized it was in
two days we literally sat down
with a handle of vodka to write
the song."
But with a poetic buzz and
the help of their Phi Delta The-ta fraternity brothers, the two
musicians created the perfect
marriage of chords and lyrics.
Blackburn, who's on vocals
and acoustic rhythm, said their
first single is a reflection and
celebration of their last four
years at UF.
"We knew what people re-
sponded to, so we mirrored our
experiences at UF," Blackburn
said.
The original band name
was The Big Black D, which
was a way to combine their last
names in a sly yet racy fashion.
After winning talent night, they
decided to choose a more ap-
propriate band name for the
event.
Aside from the chance to
meetO.A.R. backstage atGator
Growl, the band is also playing
a special VIP
reception af-
ter the event
where they'll
have the op-
portunity to
meet Dana
Carvey, Danny Wuerffel and
others.
They draw inspiration from
Oasis, Nirvana, Eric Clapton
and 311. So expect a soft rock
sound on Friday night.
The two have plans to con-
tinue writing music together
and will try to get more gigs
around Florida while they're
still in school, but as far as
their future in the music indus-
try is concerned, everything's
up in the air.
"We've thrown around the
idea to move down to Key West
and be beach bums and play
music for a couple of years,"
Deininger said.
But Blackburn said they'll
still continue to prepare for life
as if they're not rock stars.
Gator Growl tickets are $15
for students.
Getting the degree.

with it and make a great first impress

374-0934 1228 W Univ AveDancing is sexual,
lacks coordination
By MEAGAN MCGONE
avenue writer
I think the dance floor is one place where humans can be seen
actually de-evolving
If you don't believe me, go to XS on a Friday night. Spot the girl
adorned in 6-inch heels and a mini dress, grinding so furiously on a
stranger that he has to grip the pole on the stage to stay upright. Ob-
serve the guy with his shirt unbuttoned, un-rhythmically dry humping
the girl in front of him for three '80s jams in a row.
What was once a venue for artistically moving our bodies has be-
come a place to unleash our pent up inner-freaks.
Lastweekend, I wentto myyounger sister's birthday partyto chap-
erone. I completely expected to break up
kids making out in the hallways and was
not fooled by the contents in their "water
bottles," but I nearly choked on the birth-
day cake when I saw a 16-year-old girl fully
bent over between two boys on the dance
floor. There are few people who actually
look good booty-dancing, and the rest lookMeagan McGone like a bunch of sexually peakingcavemen.
Columnist Call me old-fashioned, but I miss the
days of slow dancing and "The Electric
Slide."
Duringthe party, I stepped out of the ballroom and into a nearby
bar to catch a glimpse of the UF-LSU game (and to grab a well-de-
served gin and tonic). I must have walked through a time machine.
The barwasfull of gray-haired men and women swing dancingto jazz
on the dance floor. The 70-year-olds were twisting and twirling like
they were in their primes, using more coordination and class than I
have ever seen in a bar full of 20-year-olds.
I stayed to admire for a while until Irealized I should probably get
back to babysittingthe horny teens. I got up, braced myself for what
I would see next and pushed the door to the ballroom open. I walked
right into more than 100 teens bent over and shaking their asses in
what they call a "grind line."
I'm scared to see what that will look like when they are 70.
Key pieces transform
wardrobe for winterTHURSDAY, OCTOBER 15, 2009 + ALLIGATOR, 1 1
By KARINA GALVEZ
avenue writer
Mornings and evenings are greet-
ing us with chills, but balmy Florida
afternoons aren't going anywhere -
and neither are our tank tops and shirt
dresses.
Keep your breezy, warm weather
wardrobe in action by adding simple
cover-ups that are easy to slip on over
dresses and shorts and easy to slip
into schoolbags. Oversized shirts, snug
cardigans and vests, and pashmina
scarves are perfect solutions for the
cool mornings leadingto winter.
The "boyfriend" look is in this
season, so throw on your boyfriend's
comfy oxfords over tanks and shorts
or dresses and tie them with a knot
or a belt for a fitted look. Don't have a
boyfriend? Don't fret -a brother, taller
friend or bigger sizes do the trick. Look
for a neutral color like white, shades of
blue or a muted plaid palette to acces-
sorize a greater variety of outfits.
Cardigans are small enough to
keep in your schoolbag without taking
up too much space and can provide
the right amount of warm comfort in
the morning. The bus is still blasting
air conditioning like in August, so these
little sweaters are great for commutingor for days when you leave the house
without checking the weather. Blacks,
browns, grays and dark shades of navy
blue go with almost every outfit and
can stay in your bag for days without
getting dirty.
Sweaters or button-down
vests can act as dresses or cover-ups
over plain or graphic T-shirts. For a
cover-up solution, opt for a long open
vest that won't cover your printed top
or can be belted around a form-fitted
dress. Wearing a sweater-vest as a
dress is best done by
Fashion taking the boyfriend-
look approach -
selecting vests one or
two sizes larger than
normal. American Apparel offers unisex
vests that work well both as dresses
and cover-ups for $5 to $40.
Keep your neck warm and in
style with a silk or cotton scarf. Choose
a longer pashmina scarf to use as a
shoulder cover on cold mornings or in
chilly classrooms. When the tempera-
ture rises, the scarf can come off and
become an effortless accessory by
tying it to the straps of your schoolbag.
The gradual shift toward winter
does not mean covering prints and
texture. Keep your breezy summer flare
for as long as possible by addingthe
right pieces to your autumn wardrobe.
12, ALLIGATOR * THURSDAY, OCTOBER 15, 2009
Gators T-shirts have hidden individuality- it just takes a pair of scissors to cut it loose. Follow
these simple steps to transform your old gym shirt into a custom-made halter-top for Game Day!
1. Pick
a shirt and
size you will
use. Most
cotton T-
shirts, like
the one
pictured,
will not
have a
skin-tight
fit, which
is fine.
2. Flip
over your
shirt and cut
from the cor-
sleeve to the
other. Make
sure you are
only cutting
through the
back side of
your shirt.3. Cut
straight down
the center
of your shirt
from the
neckline
until it meets
the cut you
just made.
Remove the
tag.
4. Cut
off both
sleeves
next to
the seam.
If you lift
the pieces
still con-
nected to
the shirt,
you can be-
gin to see
the straps.5. This is where you can
customize your shirt. Try
it on to see how low you'd
like the neckline. Depending
on the image on the front
of your shirt, you can cut it
into a V-neck, swoop, square
or any other cut you imagine.
Follow the cut of your neckline
into the straps. You can make
them as thick or thin as you'd
like. Fold the shirt in half so that
you can make them even.
6. Admire the final
product. Remember
that each halter-top
is unique and will fit
every body type dif-
ferently. Once you've
tried it on, mess
around with each cut
to perfect it. Enjoy!

ARKANSAS FOOTBALL
Mallett leads SEC's top pass offense
By BOBBY CALLOVI
Alligator Staff Writer
bcallovi@alligator org
It's not hard to see a big reason why Arkansas'
offense has improved since last season.
It's 6 feet, 7 inches tall, 238 pounds and takes \
the snaps at quarterback for the Razorbacks.
Sophomore Ryan Mallett transferred to Ar-
kansas in January 2008 from Michigan after the
Wolverines hired Rich Rodriguez to run a spread-
option offense, which is not suited for Mallett's
style of play.
"We were fortunate that Ryan Mallett
was here for a year and a half and
was able to go through two spring
footballs and a fall while redshirted,
so he understands the offense, un-
derstands what we are doing,"
Bobby Petrino
Arkansas football coach
The big-armed quarterback had to sit out last
season due to NCAA transfer rules, but the year
holding the clipboard has helped him succeed
quickly in his first season as UA's starter.
"We were fortunate that Ryan Mallett was here
for a year and a half and was able to go through
two spring footballs and a fall while redshirted,
so he understands the offense, understands what
we are doing," Arkansas coach Bobby Petrino
said.
Through his first five games, Mallett has been
one of the best in the nation. Currently, he is in
the top 15 in several passing categories, including
passer rating (15th), yards per game (13th) and
touchdowns (6th).
His performance this season has helped in-
crease Arkansas' passing yards per game to 318.2
from 259.6 in 2008.
Mallett has gotten help on offense from run-

Scoring rules changes help even SEC playing field
* SETS WERE SHORTENED
TO 25 POINTS IN 2008.
By ANTHONY CHIANG
Alligator Writer
achiang@alligator org
The Gators have dealt with
more changes to the scoring rules
than regular-season conference
home losses under coach Mary
Wise.
During her 19-year tenure at
Florida, there have been three
changes to the scoring format
and only two such losses. But theadjustments to a match cannot
be overlooked; they have trans-
formed the strategy involved.
When Wise first arrived at UF
in 1991, each set was scored up to
15, but a team could only score
off a serve. In 2001, there was a
monumental shift to sets that
would end at 30 points and rally
scoring -meaning a team could
score even if it was not serving.
Then, in 2008, the current scoring
format was adopted, each set was
lowered to 25 points and rally
scoring was kept.
The only thing that stayedconstant through the whole pro-
cess was the fifth set, which has
always been up to 15 points.
"If the match is shorter, does
that give the underdog a bet-
ter opportunity
to beat a better
team? I think
that answer isVolleyball yes," Wise said.
"That's why you
are seeing matches with wins and
losses that you just would not see
in the olden days."
The 30-point system privi-
leged the favorite because it isharder for an underdog to main-
tain a lead in a longer set. Under
that format in 2003, the Gators
did not even drop one set against
an Southeastern Conference op-
ponent all season.
Now, an unforced error made
by a team is magnified because of
the length of a match.
"Errors are huge. Giving oth-
er teams points in such a short
game, they're huge," junior set-
ter Brynja Rodgers said. "They're
not a fraction of the game any-
more. They're a big chunk of the
game."Just this season, No.9 UF (12-
3, 6-2 SEC) was pushed to five
sets by Ole Miss (7-11, 1-7 SEC)
because of 14 service errors that
helped keep the Rebels in the
match.
In the one-and-a-half seasons
the new system has been in place,
the underdog has been at an ad-
vantage. UF has already lost four
conference matches and 23 total
sets in conference play during
that time.
"I think the 30 points kept the
separation, but now at 25, one er-

Strong earning praise for D
UF No. 1 in total defense
By MIKE DIFERDINANDO
Alligator Staff Writer
mdiferdinando@alligator org
As Florida coach Urban
Meyer put it Wednesday, "It's
the Charlie Strong show" in
Gainesville these days.
The defensive coordinator
has built one of the nation's
most dominating defenses,
and with the offense sputtering
through three games of South-
eastern Conference play, it's
been Strong leading the march
toward another national title.
The Gators lead the nation
in total defense (202.6 yards
per game), passing defense
(115.2 yards per game), scoring
defense (6.4 points per game)
and passing defense efficiency
(78.32 rating)."He's on top of his game
right now as a coach .He
calls a really fine defense for
us," Meyer said.
"The way he relates.
The way he motivates.
The way he gets a
group of 11 to play
like one. That's what
makes a coach."
Urban Meyer
UF football coach
The Gators have given up
just 32 points through five
games this year and have al-
lowed only two touchdowns.
Florida had given up 47 points
through the first five games in
2006.
Tennessee's MontarioHardesty rushed for 96 yards
against UF on Sept. 19, but
no other opposing player has
rushed for more than 53 this
season. And cornerbacks Jano-
ris Jenkins and Joe Haden held
LSU's Brandon LaFell and Ter-
rance Toliver, two of the SEC's
most talented receivers, to a
combined six catches for 58
yards.
"It's much deeper than a
guy who calls a play," Meyer
said. "The way he relates. The
way he motivates. The way
he gets a group of 11 to play
like one. That's what makes a
coach."
INJURY UPDATE: Defensive
tackle Jaye Howard was seen
on crutches Wednesday.
Meyer said Howard is suf-
fering from a bruise below his
knee and the injury is not seri-
ous.UF defensive coordinator Charlie Strong leads a unit that has allowed only two
touchdowns so far this season.
Razorbacks look forward to another matchup with elite SEC defense
ARKANSAS, from page 18
ning backs Michael Smith and Ronnie Wingo
Jr., who average 6.5 and 7.3 yards per carry,
respectively.
The running duo brings a balance to an
offense that has become one of the premier
units in the conference.
The Razorbacks' offense is 11th in the
nation in scoring and has scored at least 40
points in four of its five games this season.
The only exception came against No. 2
Alabama, when Arkansas was held to just
seven points and Mallett had his worstgame, throwing for 160 yards on 12-of-35
passing with one touchdown and an inter-
ception.
Petrino hopes his team can learn from
that game and be better prepared to face
great defenses like the Crimson Tide's. Sat-
urday, the Razorbacks will get to see how
much they have improved since the Ala-
bama game when they go against the best
defense in the country.
"Bama's speed and strength took us out of
our game and took us away from using our
techniques, our fundamentals and hurrying
and rushing everything, and hopefully thatexperience against that fast and that physi-
cal of a team will help us," Petrino said.
Arkansas' passing game looks similar
to the gameplan from last season, but with
Mallett under center, it has been more suc-
cessful.
"They are way more im-N proved. They run a lot of the
same plays, but with Mallett.
That's why they are doing so well now," UF
linebacker Ryan Stamper said. "It's going to
be one of the best offenses we'll see all sea-
son.",
Stamper said the biggest flaw to exploitin Mallett's game is his dislike for running
the ball, so the Gators' defense will be trying
to pressure him to force him to tuck the ball
and run.
Mallett has carried 17 times for nega-
tive-21 yards this year.
But if Mallett gets going, it is no easy task
bringing down the big quarterback.
"You got to hit him pretty hard," Stamp-
er said. "We watched the Georgia-Arkansas
game, and the linebacker from Georgia, No.
35 [5-foot-11 Rennie Curran] -he actually
ran on the blitz and had to jump to tackle
him."

Round-robin schedule adds to parity
VOLLEY, from page 18
ror is magnified," Wise said.
Last season, the first year
under the new scoring system,
the Gators did not clinch the
SEC until the final conference
match -the longest they have
ever had to wait.
This season, UF is already
two matches behind confer-
ence leader Kentucky in the
loss column.
"If the match is shorter,
does that give the
underdog a better op-
portunity to beat a bet-
ter team? I think that
answer is yes."
Mary Wise
UF volleyball coach
The 25-point sets have
helped increase the competi-
tion in the SEC, a conference
the Gators have dominated for
the last 18 years.
All that, coupled with the
fact that the SEC switched to
a double-round-robin sched-
uling format in 2006 (each
team in the conference plays
each other twice), has made it
tough for UF.
Increased familiarity be-
tween conference teams and
a scoring system made for up-
sets has diminished the gap
between UF and the rest of the
SEC.Harrison Diamond/ Alligator Staff
UF volleyball coach Mary Wise thinks 25-point sets give under-
dogs a better chance to pull an upset.MCCALL, from page 18
picking up the same number
(22), allowed four of 11 third-
down tries and led time of
possession by 4:40.
Everyone agreed it was a
shellacking, but this year's
meeting went better.
Beatdown 2K9 happened
inside Tiger Stadium on a Sat-
urday night, a situation where
LSU had won 32 straight.
The Gators imposed their
will. Take a look at their
drives: 82 yards (field goal), 45
yards (turnover on downs), 80
yards (touchdown), negative-1
yard (kneel before halftime),
76 yards (missed FG), 15 yards
(punt), 44 yards (field goal), 3
yards (interception), 12 yards
(running out the clock).
There are three bad drives
in there, and the interception
could have been a touchdown,
but at any rate, the game was
never really in jeopardy after
the Gators stopped running
back Charles Scott on third
and goal from the 2.
Florida is just as dominant
as last year, maybe moreso.
It's just being done in a differ-
ent way now.
This is a defensive team.
The offense still has explosive
capabilities, and I expect some
blowouts, but this team isn'tequipped for the type of show
it put on last year.
The loss of Percy Harvin
was and is a big deal, and I
credit Urban Meyer for tight-
ening up and using his team's
strengths rather than risk sure
wins by playing a different
style to impress pollsters.
A year and a week ago,
everyone was tripping over
themselves to criticize the
Gators' waste of talent. Subse-
quent events led to a massive
change of heart, and I can see
the same thing happening this
year.
From a look at the stats, they
don't even have as much room
for a dramatic turnaround as
they did last year.
Compare their stats now
to after five games last year,
and they're getting 106 more
rushing yards and three more
points per game with just
10 fewer passing yards per
game.
They rank best in the nation
in four defensive categories
and third in passing efficien-
cy. The only major steps back-
ward are in turnover margin
and punt returns, but the most
important difference is they
haven't lost.
And based on the way they
overcame the toughest chal-
lenge of the season last week, I
can't see them losing for quite
a while.
