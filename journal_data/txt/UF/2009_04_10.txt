Human society could cease to 
exist in as few as 30 years, author 
Jared Diamond said to about 1,600 
Gainesville residents Thursday.
With this grim message, Dia-
mond offered a glimmer of hope. 
With responsible use of resources, 
there is no foreseeable end to soci-
ety, he said.
The author of “Collapse” and 
“Guns, Germs and Steel,” Diamond 
spoke as the kickoff to UF’s obser-
vance of Earth Month.
His works focus on how and why 
civilizations rise and fall.                                                                                                                         Diamond evaluates a society’s 
performance by five factors: envi-
ronmental, governmental, resource use, friends and enemies.
The mysterious fall of civiliza-
tions such as Easter Island and the 
Maya has captured Diamond’s 
imagination since he 
was a young child, he 
said.
In his speech, he 
discussed factors that contribute to 
human successes and failures, using civilizations from around the world 
and throughout history as case stud-
ies.
“There are experiments in social 
science,” he said. “Nature has al-ready carried them out.”

The Gainesville Police Depart-
ment might not be able to main-
tain the same level of service after meeting 5 percent budget cuts de-manded by the Gainesville City 
Commission, GPD spokesman Keith Kameg said.
GPD will propose a $1.3 mil-
lion cut to the  Commission on 
April 16. Its annual budget is $30 million.
“Like every department in the 
city, we don’t want to lose one dol-lar,” he said. “But we understand. It’s pretty clear what’s going on out there with the economy.”
Kameg said that GPD has been fortunate in the last two budget cycles.
“Although we have proposed cuts that included laying off peo-ple, the City Commission has not accepted any of them and has left our budget untouched.”
Along with every city depart-
ment, GPD will have to defend 
their services to the Commission.
“They have incredibly hard 
decisions to make, and we realize 
that law enforcement is half of the city’s budget,” he said.Kameg said while GPD will 
prepare for the worst, he is hoping for the best.
“This year will be especially 
hard because we anticipate cuts to our budget and an increase in 
crime,” he said. 
Those things together are the 
worst factors imaginable for law LOCAL

UF President Bernie Machen walked out-
side his office Thursday and perched himself on a bench to discuss looming budget cuts and 
tuition increases with Students for a Demo-cratic Society. 
About 10 SDS members sat inside Tigert 
Hall in peaceful protest for about an hour. 
“It’s a game of chicken with careers and education,” Machen told protesters about the 
state Legislature’s unwillingness to take neces-
sary action, such as raising taxes.
An open dialogue between Machen and 
SDS students began at about 12:30 p.m., half an hour after members arrived and began de-bating among themselves about alternative solutions to UF’s fiscal shortcomings.
Participants said they believe that, although 
a slight tuition increase would be acceptable, 
they’d prefer the state to increase income tax-
es, sales taxes or both. “Tuition increases make education inacces-
sible and makes class divi-sions,” said Tina Steiger, a UF political science senior and member of SDS.   
The group also support-
ed the 1-cent increase on sales taxes during the next 
three years being lobbied for by the Florida Education 
Association. 
The extra money would benefit Florida public education, Steiger said.  
During the discussion, SDS informed Ma-
chen about a survey that said 77 percent of 
Florida citizens would favor the sales tax in-crease. 
Machen said the state Legislature had its 
own polls saying the majority of Floridians were completely opposed to any tax increas-es.

Man hit by car after wife gets out to help
NEW PORT RICHEY (AP) — Authorities say an elderly Tam-
pa Bay man died after being hit by his own car, which his wife had 
not shifted to park.
The Florida Highway Patrol says 77-year-old John Anzalone 
got out of the car shortly after noon on Wednesday and was walk-ing toward a barber shop at a strip mall when he fell in the park-ing lot. His wife, 72-year-old Patricia Anzalone, went to help him but left the car in gear. The unoccupied vehicle moved forward and hit her husband. The New Port Richey man was airlifted to a hospital, where he later died. FHP is still investigating the inci-dent and says charges are pending.OnCampu s

FDA reversal OKs morphine 
painkiller for terminally ill
NEW YORK (AP) — A liquid 
morphine painkiller given by fam-
ily caregivers to dying patients can remain on the market, federal reg-ulators have decided after hearing 
protests over their decision to re-
move it.
The Food and Drug Adminis-
tration announced last week that it would order manufacturers to stop making 14 medications, includ-ing the liquid morphine. All were developed so long ago they had never received FDA approval.
But on Thursday, the FDA’s Dr. 
Douglas Throckmorton told The Associated Press the morphine liq-uid will remain on the market until it’s replaced by an approved ver-sion or some equivalent therapy.
The reversal was welcomed by 
experts in hospice care and pain relief. One doctors’ group had told 
the FDA that last week’s order 
would “cause extreme suffering for many patients who are nearing the end of life.”
The order has not changed for 
the other painkillers, at least for now, said Throckmorton, deputy director of the agency’s Center for Drug Evaluation and Research.

Kanye says ‘South Park’ put him in check
NEW YORK (AP) — “South 
Park” may have accomplished 
the impossible — getting Kanye West to check his ego.
The Comedy Central show 
skewered the famously self-important rapper on its show Wednesday night, painting him as a narcissistic figure so out of touch with reality he couldn’t even take a (very politically in-correct) joke.
West’s love of himself and his 
work has been almost as integral 
to his image as his music: Just 
last year, he told The Associated Press that he was the “voice of this generation.” Also recently, he was quoted as saying his greatest regret was not being able to see himself perform live.
Yet, on his blog Thursday, 
West appeared chastened and 
ready to turn over a new leaf.
In typical all-caps mode, he 
wrote: “SOUTH PARK MUR-
DERED ME LAST NIGHT AND IT’S PRETTY FUNNY. IT HURTS MY FEELINGS BUT WHAT CAN YOU EXPECT FROM SOUTH PARK! I AC-TUALLY HAVE BEEN WORK-
ING ON MY EGO THOUGH. 
HAVING THE CRAZY EGO IS PLAYED OUT IN MY LIFE AND CAREER.”
West said that he started 
stroking his ego long ago to build up his self esteem — but he now realizes he needs to “GET PAST MYSELF.”WHAT’S HAPPENING

After Tom Miller’s paintings 
are sold, some are thrown down 
the stairs.
Some are shot at. Some are 
painted over by their owners. Some are hung in frames. And sometimes these paintings make 
their way back to him, the local 
artist and music maker said.
”I think it’s pretty cool that 
paintings, just like people, can have a life and show evidence 
that they’ve been around,” he 
said. Tonight, self-proclaimed jack of all trades and master of about three, Tom Miller, will 
hold his first painting show in 
over a decade.
At 8 p.m. at The Story House on 11 S.E. Fifth Ave., Miller’s “Paintings and Dirty Little Magic Marker Drawings” exhibit will feature 10 paintings and 45 magic 
marker drawings.
“The paintings are abstracts, 
which come 
rather quickly 
and have an 
emotion con-
tent to them,” Miller said. “Some are whimsical and some are dark, the same as my poetry.”
Miller said the magic marker 
drawings satisfy his filthy need to freak out, entertain and make people gawk, gasp and wonder.
When looking at his art, Miller 
said people don’t know whether to leave, admire it, throw up or look at the world differently.
Some of the paintings cost be-
tween $15 and $20, he said.Local art show to

Though three months have passed, Scott 
Sakowitz still can’t believe it.
Sakowitz, a UF zoology junior, won $19,400 
on an episode of “Wheel of Fortune,” which 
was shown on Wednesday night. The prize in-cludes cash and a trip to Barbados for two.
The win came as a surprise to Sakowitz, who considered the prize just the icing on the cake to being on the show, which has a huge applicant pool, he said. 
“I just spun this giant wheel,” he said. 
“Many people don’t stumble on that kind of money without working.”
Sakowitz, who is also a member of Alpha 
Epsilon Pi Fraternity, said he plans to spend a large portion of the money on dental school tuition. 
But, he said, he’ll also use some of it for fun, 
adding he plans to throw a party and buy a 
new computer.
“I need to let myself enjoy it too,” he said.The money and vacation to Barbados will 
be available starting in August, and the trip 
expires next April, Sakowitz said. He doesn’t 
know who he’ll invite to come with him yet.
Sakowitz tried to keep his win a secret until 
the episode, which was taped on Dec. 15, was 
aired.
He said at first he wanted his win to be a surprise for everyone, but a lot of people be-gan asking for the outcome, so he decided to share the secret with those who really wanted 
to know.
“I think it’s all luck,” he said of his win.
Sakowitz applied to be on the show during 
summer and was invited to audition in Sep-tember. 
“I tried not to get my hopes up, though,” 
he said.
When he found out he was chosen to be 
on the show, he was excited to meet Pat Sajak,

The passion Adam Amir fights with just 
won him $30,000.
Amir, a 20-year-old UF junior, was 
named a Truman Scholar for 2009 last 
month.
He was one of two students attending a 
Florida university to win the award, which reflected his efforts in pursuing a career in leadership and public service.
Sixty students in the U.S. received the 
award overall.  
“It legitimizes a lot of the thankless, 
hard work throughout college,” Amir said. “It’s one great figurative pat on the back.”
Amir said two of his more prominent 
leadership positions have included being Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual and Transgender cabinet affairs director for Student Gov-ernment and serving as a district court in-tern in Gainesville.
He also participated in four differ-
ent trips with Florida Alternative Breaks, where he spent time doing community service instead of vacationing.
Amir recalled leading a trip last year 
to Nashville, Tenn., where he counseled gay, bisexual and transgendered teenagers from local schools. 
He said personal growth from the trip 
was rewarding.  
“Conversations that we had with the 
students were eye-opening,” he said.   
Amir is also a J. Wayne Reitz Scholar 
and a Florida Opportunity Scholar, a need-based award funding low-income, first-generation and underrepresented mi-norities at UF.
The award has given him more confi-
dence to continue his fight for the rights of lesbians, gays, bisexual and transgendered people, Amir said.
Ignited by the anti-gay environment in his hometown of Coral Springs, Amir said 
he inherited “a big mouth and confidence 
you need to get involved in politics,” from his older sister, Morgan. 
Amir said one of his favorite memories 
at UF was working with the Obama cam-
paign and celebrating with his best friends after the votes had been counted.  
Jeanna Mastrodicasa, as-
sistant vice president 
for Student Affairs and Gainesville City Com-
missioner, directs the J. Wayne Reitz Scholars program and agreed that 
Amir had a penchant for politics.
“Adam is an inspiring student with a 
true passion for change,” she wrote in an 
e-mail. “He works hard to understand the 
issues and how to make a difference.”
She wrote Amir worked hard during 
this year’s local elections to ensure the defeat of a discriminatory charter amend-
ment that would have, if passed, removed 
protections from sexual orientation and gender identity discrimination in the city.
Amir said he hasn’t decided on the de-
tails but plans to attend law school after graduating from UF as a political science major . 
He is also pursuing a history major fo-
cused on homosexuality in Nazi Germany, 
a self-created program under history pro-
fessor Geoffrey Giles, a leading expert on the issue, according to a UF news release.
Amir, who is Jewish, said he feels there 
is an inherent sense of persecution and jus-tice in America’s history and culture.
“As a gay kid growing up, I noticed a 
homophobic world around me,” he said. 
Other than fighting for equal civil 
rights, Amir said another goal goes back to family.
“I’m just trying to make my parents 
proud of me,” he saidCITY NEWS

An internal investigation that 
began in November ended in 
written warnings given to three Gainesville police officers for harassing people and throwing eggs.
GPD Officers Brett Robinson, Billy Long and Joshua Hinson drove through the Porter’s Neigh-borhood in Southwest Gainesville near Depot Avenue. They were intending to harass prostitutes and drug dealers, as earlier re-ported in the Gainesville Sun.
University Police Officer Keith 
Smith was also involved.
On Nov. 2, while Robinson 
was driving in the Porter’s Neigh-borhood with his roommate Di-ego Ibanez and University Police Officer Keith Smith, GPD Officer Charles Owens stopped Robin-son’s car. 
According to the report, when 
Owens saw Robinson in the car, he told the group to leave the area.
On Nov. 8, Robinson, Ibanez, 
Smith, and GPD Officer Billy Long drove to downtown bars. 
When returning from the 
bars, Robinson drove the group through the Porter’s Neighbor-hood.
Robinson stopped at intersec-tions and waited for people who were standing on the corner to approach the car, the report stat-ed.  
According to the report, when 
a person walked up, someone in the car would say something to them and Robinson would drive off. The next day, Robinson, Smith, Long and Ibanez met two women at a downtown bar.
When driving home, Robin-
son directed the person who was driving his truck through Porter’s Neighborhood.
The group stopped at differ-
ent street corners and threw eggs from the bed of the pickup truck, the report stated.
According to the report, Of-
ficer Owens saw the truck’s cov-ered license plate and pulled it over. When Owens saw who was in the truck, he again told them to leave the area.
No victims or witnesses were 
found and no property was dam-aged, according to the report.

OPINIONS EDITORAfter getting up close and personal with chilly weather 
more akin to Northern New Jersey, the Department of Darts & Laurels assures you sunshine and warmth is 
here to stay. While North Central Florida’s innumerable out-door activities can be paired better with grain alcohol than late-

we urge you to proceed with caution.
There’s no denying the allure of locking lips with a handle of

Typically when the words “sports car,” “tight corner” and 
“going too fast” are paired in the same sentence, the results 
tend to conjure imagery nothing short of horrific. For caus-ing $125,000 in damage to her boss’s Ferrari after flipping the vehicle, the Department of Darts and Laurels chucks a why-
couldn’t-you-just-have-had-your-picture-taken-with-the-car? 
DART at one soon-to-be unemployed California woman. To 
put that in perspective, we’d have to work somewhere in the neighborhood of 8,800 days just to pay off the repairs.
Word out of Los Angeles reveals news of a woman who 
seemingly struck gold but played the role of good Samaritan. The Department of Darts & Laurels awards a did-you-at-least-think-about-how-many-trips-to-In-N-Out-Burger-you-could-have-made? LAUREL to Talon Curtis for returning a $357,959 
cashier’s check to its rightful owner. While we don’t condone stealing, we can’t say for sure if we’d do the same thing. 
Last Saturday saw a worldwide pillow fight ranging from 
locales like Wall Street to downtown Chicago — minus the state of Michigan. For breaking up what could have been the most epic battle between individuals clad with pillows ever, the Department of Darts & Laurels launches a don’t-you-guys-have-more-serious-things-to-worry-about-than-a-bunch-of-feathers? DART at the Detroit Police Department. Maybe it’s 
just us, but we’re pretty sure Detroit doesn’t need the negative press considering that little ol’ problem called the automotive industry.
When we think of a church service, we tend to visualize 
overcrowded pews stuffed to the gills with Holy-Rollers all decked out in their Sunday’s best — not bar stools and rock ‘n’ roll. The Department of Darts & Laurels extends a we-hear-bourbon-and-ginger-goes-great-with-the-Book-of-Daniel LAU-
REL to The River Church for planning to hold Easter Sunday 
services at a Little Rock bar. Just a friendly word of advice for those of you planning to make the trip up to Arkansas; there is a no-suit-allowed policy being strictly enforced at the door.

”technical”-error-that-caused-the-problem DART at the New 
York University admissions office. Hell, if the office really wanted to get some laughs, they should have just filled an un-popular co-worker’s cubicle to the brim with packing peanuts. 
While a career in law enforcement means putting one’s life 
at risk during each shift, one of the many rewards include the chance to save a man’s life. The Department of Darts & Laurels proudly presents a you-are-a-true-American-hero-even-if-you-

pulling a man out of a burning vehicle mere seconds before it exploded. During a time in which news headlines overflow with negativity, we can take solace in the fact that heartwarm-ing stories transcend the Lifetime Channel.

packing for the extended weekend, I unwittingly gath-ered a specific set of socks and boxers. Two days later, while suiting up for our first game against the University of Rhode Island, I realized the extent of my superstitious 
loser-ness. 
The same Bart Simpson boxers I had worn in every big 
game the past three seasons. The same two pairs of crusty 
socks, yellowed by the ungodly funk living in my skates. 
I even put my equipment on in specific order: left skate, 
right skate, tie the right, tie the left, left shin guard, right shin guard, right elbow pad, left elbow pad. To coin a fa-vorite phrase of one of my roommates, “Embarrassing.” 
To make matters worse, I began thinking about previ-
ous superstitious atrocities I have committed — and there were a lot of them. In the summer of 2004, I was playing a tournament in Atlanta, Ga., and I only listened to two songs the whole weekend: “Grand Illusion” by Styx and 
“I Can Tell” by the 504 Boyz. I was named tournament 
MVP, and rather than crediting myself or my teammates for hard work, I gave the glory to my bizarre musical tastes. 
In one of my current classes, I have taken every test 
sitting from the same seat. After acing the first exam, I convinced myself the seat had good mojo, so I refuse to sit anywhere else. How did I let this happen? At 
what point did I disregard all logic in favor of putting faith in special 
underwear?  What self-respecting 
adult, young or old, believes in playlists and inanimate objects rather than the Bible, science or his 
own efforts? 
I’ll tell you because I’m not go-
ing down on this ship by myself.  
First, the whole city of Detroit 
are a bunch of superstitious turds. Red Wings fans throw octopi onto the ice during playoff games because, back in 
the 1950s, the Wings only needed to win eight games to hoist the Stanley Cup. Eight games, eight tentacles. Sure, back then that made a little sense, but now a team has to 
win 16 games to be top dog. They still throw their slimy 
sea creatures, though.
In basketball, dozens of players have perfected their 
pre-foul-shot rituals, most notably Rip Hamilton. Even the darling of international politics, President Barack Obama, 
acts on superstition. During his campaign, Obama toted 
around a lucky poker chip, an American eagle pin and a small statue of the Monkey King. He also noticed that he faired better in primaries and caucuses on days he played 
basketball. Naturally, Obama balled on Nov. 4. 
I’m a little ashamed of my nerdy habits, but most of us 
probably have a few. Whether my superstitions actually 
affect anything, I don’t really know. What I do know is that, come job-hunting time, I definitely will be wearing 
my Bart Simpson boxers.

Well, America sure has been great 
for these past two centuries. 
I mean, we did some pretty 
cool stuff. 
We invented Coca-Cola. We pioneered 
the reality show. 
Hell, we’ve unleashed the dulcet tones of 
The Backstreet Boys into the world. Yeah, it was a great country for a while, but unfortu-nately, it looks like it’s time to go. Pack your bags, folks, and I’ll see all of you in Turkey.
Why are things as we know them coming 
to an end? Why is it time for America to--as the saying goes--pack it in? Gay marriage, of course! 
Yes, now that gay marriage has been le-
galized in Vermont and Iowa (in about a one-week period) the total number of states permitting same-sex marriages is up to four. And, according to some, our great democ-racy is about to plunge into a bedlam un-
equalled since Sodom.I know it may 
sound hard to be-
lieve and maybe even 
painfully idiotic and 
closed-minded, but, rest assured--now that four states have 
legalized same-sex 
marriage, it’s only 
a matter of time until people are legally al-lowed to marry animals! Sounds bad, huh? Well just wait until the next roll down the 
“slippery slope.” Soon, you’re going to see 
men marrying toasters and women marry-ing rocking chairs. 
I think it should be obvious to everyone 
that if two people of the same gender who love each other are allowed to spend their lives together and call it “marriage” and re-ceive the same benefits and rights to happi-ness and--in some cases--misery as a hetero-
sexual couple, then clearly the End of Days is upon us.
Yes, the Devil has his hooks in America, 
but good. Gay marriage? Marriage is be-tween a man and a woman! Any deviation 
from that and you’d better put on your ga-loshes, because as some French kings might say, “After gay marriage, the deluge!”
Alright, as fun as it was to step temporar-
ily into the body of an arch-conservative, I’m going to have to step right back out again for reasons of sanity and decency.
I have to say, I’m very proud of Vermont 
and Iowa. 
These states mark the first legalizations 
of same-sex marriage through legislative ac-tion instead of court order, and this bodes 
very well for gays, lesbians and--well--any-
one else who thinks it’s only right and fair that every person be treated equally in the eyes of the law.
I know numerous people who are op-
posed to gay marriage, and I’ve never quite been able to understand why. Essentially, I hear either that “marriage is between a man and a woman” or else that “God says it’s 
bad.” Neither of these arguments strike a 
chord with me. 
Marriage is a word. When we’re younger 
we learn it’s what two people do when they 
love each other. Is it so intolerable for those 
two people to have the same parts? 
The God argument annoys me even more. 
God is Love, right? You’d think he would be a fan of this idea. 
And that bit where the Bible says it’s bad? 
The Bible also says we should stone adulter-ers and use the womenfolk of our enemies as sex slaves, but we don’t do that.
Good work, Vermont and Iowa. Way to 
be trend-setters. Well, I’m not certain about what happened in Guantanamo Bay, but at least I hope we don’t.

Florida’s legislators are wrestling with an unprecedent-ed decline in general revenues. While some talk about embracing Indian gaming as part of a solution, there’s 
a much higher-stakes game in play — a game that risks the future of Florida by dismantling badly needed state pro-grams, including public higher education.
Make no mistake about it: Reductions under consider-
ation for higher education and other government programs will severely damage our state’s efforts to become a home for talent and innovation. They will not only set back uni-
versities but also thwart the state’s efforts to build a critical 
mass of innovation for at least a generation to come. 
Enterprise Florida, our state’s primary organization de-
voted to statewide economic development, says, “Education is the new bedrock for economic development. Skilled, edu-
cated talent at all levels . . . is key to Florida’s economic suc-cess for high-wage jobs and innovation.”
That’s why “Build World-Class Talent” is Enterprise 
Florida’s top priority in its strategic “Roadmap to Florida’s 
Future.”
Consider the words of University of Chicago economist 
and Nobel laureate Robert Lucas, who maintains that “spill-overs in knowledge that result from talent-clustering are the main cause of economic growth” (The Atlantic, March 2009). Where does talent cluster? Around universities with the re-
sources to support undergraduate, graduate and postdoc-toral research and creativity.
The future of our state mapped 
out by Enterprise Florida and oth-
ers lies in the generation of ideas. The last decade has seen a shift and 
surge in our state as Gov. Bush and key legislators worked 
to attract Scripps and other named research centers. At the 
same time, all universities have dramatically increased their research activities.
The choices our legislators are facing can be summarized 
in one overriding and important question: Would the im-pact of dismantling state programs be worse for the future of the state than the impact of increasing taxes on Floridians during a recession?
The answer is not simple, because not all expenditures 
made by the Legislature have the same impact, and not all 
taxes affect economic prosperity the same way. 
However, there are options that can go a long way toward 
closing the state budget gap and retaining necessary services 
for Florida’s residents, including public higher education.
Consider the idea of a measured and temporary change 
that raises the state sales tax one cent for the next three years. A one-cent sales tax increase would reduce the budget cuts by $3 billion.
Such an increase would barely affect individuals mak-
ing more than $100,000 a year. For those earning less than $25,000, the impact would be about $150 per year. However, the forthcoming federal tax cuts combined with the expen-ditures that are part of the federal stimulus package would offset that negative impact.
To grasp the nature of this impact, our legislators should 
compare it with the alternative: deep cuts in government 
services and state programs, such as public higher educa-
tion. These are priorities that the Legislature has debated and repeatedly supported over the past decade.
Our efforts to build our state’s economy through nurtur-
ing education, talent, innovation and creativity now hang in the balance — perhaps to be undone in the current budget. And, if lost, that momentum is not easily regained. Failing decisive action, Enterprise Florida’s recommended route could become the road not taken.
In the coming weeks, the Legislature will place its bet on 
Florida’s future. 
We encourage our elected representatives to play the 
odds-on favorite by following Enterprise Florida’s economic development strategy and supporting our public universi-ties.

A Reitz Union Wendy’s em-
ployee was fired Monday after 
being charged with repeatedly 
punching a man in the face at 
the McCarty Drive bus stop last 
week, according to a University 
Police Department report.  
Rafael R. Robinson, 23, got 
into an argument with Antonio 
M. Mosely, 26, after they got off the bus on McCarty Drive near the Reitz Union according to the report. The two men knew each 
other, the report stated. 
Mosely told police Robinson 
hit him in the face while they were arguing, knocking him to 
the ground. 
While on the ground, Robin-
son punched Mosely in the face and head repeatedly before flee-ing toward the Reitz Union, the report stated.
Mosely was bleeding profuse-
ly from the mouth, 
the nose and right 
ear when police ar-
rived, according to 
the report. Mosely’s right eye was swollen shut, according to the report. He was transported to Shands at UF.
Police searched the area for 
Robinson but could not find him.
After contacting Robinson’s 
probation officer, police learned 
Robinson had a ”no contact with 
minors” order against him. 
Police informed a manager at 
the Reitz Union Wendy’s about the order, and Robinson was fired immediately, according to the report.
Robinson will be banned from 
the UF campus as soon as he is lo-
cated. As of Thursday afternoon, 
no trespass warning had been posted on UPD’s Web site.
Robinson has been charged 
with felony battery for an inci-dent.

Participants in “Stomp the Swamp for 
Autism” will run or walk the stairs and 
benches of the stadium for as long as they 
want. The event will raise money to benefit UF’s 
Center for Autism and Related Disabilities.
The organization is a state-funded pro-
gram that supports children and adults with autism, said Amanda Cruz, the event’s co-
ordinator. 
The person who runs the most will take home the Biggest Stomper Award. Inside 
the stadium there will be three different tracks for participants’ varied fitness levels, she said.
“‘Stomp the Swamp for Autism’ is a good 
way to show the children that they’re not alone and that they have a whole commu-nity to support them,” Cruz said.
Because the event is scheduled Easter 
weekend, Cruz said she would be happy if about 50 to 100 people attend. The event will begin at 10 a.m. and costs $15.99 online be-
fore the event and $15 the day of the event.

� TEAM PREDICTS 11 TO 
14 NAMED STORMS.
RALEIGH, N.C. (AP) — The 
2009 hurricane season will be less 
active than last year’s flurry of storms, and there’s less than a 50 percent chance that a hurricane 
will hit the southeastern U.S., a re-
searcher said Thursday.
On the Gulf Coast, however, 
there is a 70 percent chance a hur-ricane will make landfall.
The North Carolina State Uni-
versity team’s forecast of 11 to 14 named storms for the Atlan-tic season, including six to eight 
hurricanes, was generally in line 
with predictions from Colorado State University researchers. They called for an average season with 12 named storms, including six hurricanes — two of them major.
Last year was one of the most 
active hurricane season’s on re-cord, with 16 named storms, in-
cluding eight hurricanes, forming 
in the Atlantic. Five of the eight hurricanes were at least Category 3 strength.The forecast from the N.C. State 
team led by Professor Lian Xie said there was a 45 percent chance a hurricane would hit the southeast coast and a 40 percent chance a major hurricane would hit the Gulf Coast.
“We anticipate the overall activ-
ity of the 2009 Atlantic hurricane 
season to be close to that of an average season seen in the past 20 years,” said Xie, whose team 
evaluated 100 years of hurricane positions and intensities along with weather patterns and sea sur-
face temperatures.
Last year’s forecast was for a 
slightly more active season than 
average with 13 to 15 named storms, he said.
“I would also like to emphasize 
that long-range hurricane predic-tions, although they have shown some skill in the past, are still not a 
precise science,” he said.
The federal government will 
release its forecast May 21. The At-
lantic hurricane season runs from June 1 to Nov. 30.Experts expect fewer 
hurricanes this season

DIAMOND , from page 1� SHE WAS A THIRD-YEAR
ARCHITECTURE MAJOR AT UF.
By CHELSEA KEENAN
Alligator Writer
UF student Starr Bishop was a straight-
shooter who loved the outdoors. She snow skied and skydived. She even spoke out in a town meeting against a proposed park-ing garage that would block access to the St. Johns River, which flows through Jackson-ville, her hometown. It was an argument she won. 
So it wasn’t surprising when she chose to 
build a set of outdoor swings last fall as her school project. Her goal was to push chil-dren to play outside instead of watching a TV screen. 
Starr, a third-year architecture major, 
completed her project before she died on March 14 of Lou Gehrig’s disease, which af-fects the brain and spinal cord’s nerve cells.
Meghan O’Reilly and Gail Milano, the UF 
graduate students who helped Starr com-plete her project last fall, hung the swings in the architecture building’s atrium to honor 
her. 
“She was so much more about continuing 
on with life than being sick,” O’Reilly said.  
“She was so funny and talented.”
In March 2008, Starr was diagnosed with 
Lou Gehrig’s Disease on Good Friday. She was 20 years old. 
She continued to attend UF, however. As it progressed, the disease affected 
Starr’s ability to speak, swallow and, at 
times, raise her arms. So in order to continue 
work on her project, she hired O’Reilly and 
Milano through UF’s Disability Resource 
Center to help.
Melody Bishop, Starr’s mother,s said she 
didn’t even know Starr was working on the 
project until she saw the private on-campus 
studio O’Reilly and Milano built for Starr 
during a visit to Gainesville. 
“She never tooted her own horn,” Bishop 
said.
But Starr’s project wasn’t the only thing 
Bishop was unaware of. 
While Bishop said she knew her daughter 
would always go out of her way to include others, she has been overwhelmed by the number of people who have e-mailed, called 
and written letters describing how Starr im-
pacted their lives.  
Bishop recalled a two-page letter written 
by the father of a friend of Starr’s who re-counted the first time he met her during din-
ner with him and his daughter, who had just 
moved to Gainesville. 
“He was so impressed,” 
Bishop said in a voice thick 
with emotion, “He was so 
impressed by her loving-
ness and kindness.”
Jenny Sprunt, a friend 
of Starr’s, said the two met freshman year of high 
school, where they competed in science fairs 
together.  
“She had more personality in her pinky 
finger than some people have in their whole 
body,” Sprunt said, adding Starr could be friends with anyone.
“She was outgoing, bubbly and 
sporty,”Sprunt said. “She was very honest. She would tell you how it is, a real straight-shooter.”
Bishop agreed. She said when Starr was young, she chastised her mother, who lost 
her temper and was rude to a store clerk. 
“She said, ‘Mom, you weren’t very nice 
in there,’” Bishop said. “She always remem-
bered the right things to do.”
By December, Starr’s disease had become 
so aggressive she had to move home to Jack-sonville. However, because she could still 
type, she remained enrolled by taking online 
classes.
“She never gave up,” Bishop said. “She 
always wanted to be a student. She loved Gainesville and the Gators.” 
Bishop added Starr was a football fan and 
started attending Gator games with her fam-ily when she was 2 years old. 
Once Starr went into respiratory failure 
on March 4, she was in a coma for 10 days 
before her parent’s chose to have her taken 
off life support. 
“She ended up donating her heart, both 
lungs, liver and kidney,” Bishop said. 
“So somebody out there has a really great 
heart.”

hold a memorial in honor of Starr later on in 
the semester.Student remembered for heart, outgoing personality

TAMPA, Fla. — Merchant mari-
ners have always endured hard la-
bor, monotony and the threat of pi-
rates for the adventure of life at sea, but the vocation has grown more dangerous with the times.
Crew members on cargo ships 
describe living in close quarters for 
months at a time with few techno-
logical amenities and the frequent threat of storms and fires.
And the piracy threat continues 
to grow, with heavily armed bandits chasing down ships and taking hos-tages. The U.S.-flagged Maersk Ala-bama was the latest target this week 
off the coast of Somalia.
“It’s hard, but it’s our profession,” 
former Alabama crew member Go-
ducel Pascua said in a phone inter-view from his home in Elmhurst, 
N.Y.
Greater automation has allowed 
even the biggest vessels to have 
smaller crews, so fewer jobs exist in 
the industry, but the intense work 
and tedium at sea are largely un-changed.
Commercial vessels typically 
have 20 to 30 crew members, includ-
ing two or three cooks and stewards 
in the kitchen and four engineers to run the power plant. Most crew members are classified as “able sea-men,” performing deck, wheelhouse and other duties.
“It can be hard work, but that de-
pends on the type of ship and how 
automated it is,” says Mark Rivers, 
40, a Brooklyn, N.Y., native who has been at sea since 1991, sailing waters 
from the Great Lakes to the Indian 
Ocean, often as a helmsman.
Salaries have not changed much 
in the past quarter century. On the largest cargo ships, pay can range 
from about $150,000 annually for the 
captain, down to $50,000 or so for a seaman, according to Doug Wray, 
a former mer-
chant mariner 
who is now marketing di-
rector for the company that operates the Port of Tampa.
As for amenities, Rivers said food 
aboard the ship is usually good, but liquor is not allowed, and satellite television is dependable only within 100 to 150 miles from shore. Send-
ing an e-mail costs 50 cents per mes-
sage.
Zoya Quinn, whose husband, 
Ken, was second mate aboard the 
Alabama when it was attacked early 
Wednesday, said the life is cold, gray and isolated. He goes to sea for four months at a time, during which he can e-mail once a day and is rarely 
allowed to use a telephone.
Other crewmen who worked 
on the Alabama in recent years de-
scribe a cycle of frequent job changes and months-long stints on different ships from around the world. Life on board consists of little more than 
working, eating and sleeping.Pascua, who worked on the Ala-
bama in 2007, recalls crew members 
standing near-constant watch for 
pirates along the dangerous African coast.
“There’s a lot of sighting boats,” 
Pascua said. “You don’t know if it’s pirates or not.”THE ASSOCIATED PRESS
MANCHESTER, N.H.  — Three generations of job seek-
ers — more than 10,000 — descended on a job fair at a New 
Hampshire college gymnasium Thursday, jamming traffic for miles and forcing organizers to cut off admission to the event after just two hours.
Officials shut down shuttle bus service from a nearby mall 
to the overwhelmed Southern New Hampshire University campus by noon, several hours before the heavily publicized event was to end.Job applicants ranging from college students to unemployed 
executives in their 60s waited in seemingly endless lines for buses to the event, then to speak with recruiters, then for buses back to their cars. Police Lt. Maureen Tessier gave an unofficial crowd estimate of more than 10,000, and hundreds more were turned away.
“People are very serious about employment and not just 
running around grabbing goodies for the sake of filling up 
goodie bags,” said Don Legere, who was looking to hire people 
for his financial services firm Modern Woodmen of America.
He was seeing about 25 people an hour, looking to hire two to four people immediately and another six to eight by the end of the year.
“I’ve seen a lot of good, quality people,” he said.Maureen Maslanka, 52, of Nashua, was laid off in Septem-
ber from an electronics job. She said she left the event, her first job fair, “a little optimistic.”
“I spoke with the people that I’ve been sending resumes 
over and over and over to,” she said. “So I got to give it to them 
by hand.”
Chris Duchaine, 32, of Johnson, Vt., got shut out because of 
the gridlock.
Duchaine and a friend drove to Manchester after dropping 
off resumes at a job fair in Massachusetts Thursday morning, 
but he got there after the shuttle buses stopped running. Du-chaine joked that he met people in line in Massachusetts who already had been to the Manchester event.
He was philosophical, even though he struck out in Man-
chester.
“The effort you put in is what you get out,” Duchaine said, 
mentioning that a friend who hunted hard just landed a job paying 25 percent more than the one he lost.
Sponsors WMUR-TV, the state and the college said more 
than 150 employers looking to fill 1,500 full- and part-time jobs took part, including Burger King, the U.S. Secret Service and defense contractor BAE Systems.
General Manager Jeff Bartlett said the turnout was far more 
than anyone expected.
“I think the bottom line to all of us, despite all the traffic 
problems, is that hundreds and maybe over a thousand people will get a job out of this job fair, and that’s a pretty good day if you can put that many people back to work,” Bartlett said.
New Hampshire’s unemployment was 5.3 percent in Febru-
ary, the most recent month available. That translated to 39,290 people seeking jobs.FRIDAY, APRIL 10, 2009 � ALLIGATOR, 11

FORT CAMPBELL, Ky. — Every soldier 
who’s gone to war in the past year paused be-
fore leaving to take a brain test — basic math, 
matching numbers and symbols and identi-
fying patterns to measure response time and 
accuracy. Now that some of these troops have 
returned, they’re taking a fresh round of tests, 
all part of a broad effort by the military to bet-ter treat head injuries.
The Department of Defense is also deploy-
ing some unusual weapons for treating the injuries, including paint guns and motion-sen-
sitive video games integrated into therapy at new trauma centers around the country.
Funding for the treatment of these injuries 
is expected to increase under President Barack Obama, who said Thursday his new military and veterans affairs budget will focus on di-
agnosing brain injuries and psychological dis-abilities that have gone untreated.
More than 150,000 service members from 
the Marines, Air Force, Army and Navy have 
undergone the testing that became mandatory 
last year. Those who suffer a concussion or similar head injury will get a follow-up test.
The 101st Airborne Division is the only di-
vision going a step further and testing all sol-diers again over the last few months as they have been returning to Fort Campbell from 
tours in Iraq and Afghanistan.
The tests alone can’t diagnose traumatic 
brain injuries, the signature injury of the wars, 
potentially crippling and sometimes hard to 
detect damage from blows that can include an 
exploding roadside bomb, a mortar blast or a 
vehicle crash.
But the tests help doctors zero in on which mental functions are damaged, and the best way to treat that is by comparing an individu-al soldier’s brain function before and after the 
injury.
Dr. David Twillie, director of a newly 
opened brain injury care center at Fort Camp-
bell, says the individual results are necessary 
“because the brain is a fairly complex organ and because when they experience a fall or a 
blast, there’s no way to necessarily pinpoint 
what particular structures within the brain 
were injured, because the injuries are micro-
scopic in nature.”
“So it’s not really one-size-fits-all,” he said.
Military doctors estimate that 10 percent to 
20 percent of soldiers sent to Iraq or Afghani-
stan suffer a TBI. Symptoms can range from 
minor headaches or dizziness to memory loss or vision problems. And it can take some sol-
diers a while to realize how severely they’ve been affected.
Spc. Christopher Ottney hit his head in a 
vehicle rollover in Afghanistan in May 2008. He woke up in a medical helicopter and had trouble walking and talking. His doctor first 
saw him walking down hallways hanging 
onto the walls to keep himself upright.
Ottney said it took him a couple of months 
to really grasp how the injury affected him, but he’s made quick progress at Fort Camp-
bell since then.
“I’m pretty stubborn,” he admits. “I was in 
full denial of my injuries, and I didn’t take it 
seriously what was wrong.”
His cane is gone now, but he still hasn’t re-
gained all his balance and his eyesight. Still he 
says, “I’ve made a lot of outward progress.”
Ottney’s injury was severe enough that 
doctors could diagnose it without checking his 
pre-combat brain test. But experts say milder 
injuries or concussions can often be hard to de-
tect and can have different side effects for each individual. For mild cases that aren’t easy to 
diagnose, a sharp decline in performance on 
the test can be a warning sign of a brain injury, 
Twillie said.
The pre-deployment computer exam takes 
about 20 minutes. Some Fort Campbell sol-diers will take the post-deployment test mul-
tiple times, along with a survey about injury 
experiences during deployment, for a special 
brain study with Walter Reed Army Medical 
Center.12, ALLIGATOR � FRIDAY, APRIL 10, 2009

TAMPA, Fla. — Police have 
arrested a volunteer at a small 
Port Tampa congregation who 
is accused of stealing more than 
$216,000 in church funds to sup-port drug and gambling habits.
Tampa police say 46-year-
old Michael Wayne McKenzie served as volunteer treasurer for the Port Tampa United Methodist Church since Janu-ary 2006.
There are about 40 members in the congregation.
McKenzie was arrested on 
Tuesday.
McKenzie is charged with 
two felony counts of grand 
theft, one felony 
count of orga-
nized fraud and one felony count 
of fraudulent use of personal 
information.
Jail records show he is being 
held on $52,500 bail. It was not 
immediately known if he has an attorney.Man faces charges

LOS ANGELES — YouTube 
and Universal Music Group are 
teaming up on an online music 
video venture that will launch later this year with Universal’s 
entire catalog of about 10,000 
music videos.
The companies will share ad 
revenue on the Vevo.com site, on a Vevo channel on YouTube and on a tailor-made video 
player that can be placed on so-
cial-networking pages and oth-er sites. The free-to-view pack-
age will carry ads, including 
video spots of up to 15 seconds preceding the music video.
“We believe that video is the 
best opportunity for revenue generation right now,” said Rio 
Caraeff, executive vice presi-
dent of Universal’s eLabs digi-tal business strategy unit.“The advertisers and brands 
are more comfortable with vid-eo as a vessel for their message 
and their advertising spend. 
Streaming audio is harder to monetize under an ad-driven 
model right now,” Caraeff 
said.
As an added incentive to Uni-
versal, the player will feature a 
button enabling users to easily 
buy the tunes digitally through Apple Inc.’s iTunes and Ama-
zon.com Inc., which send most of the revenue from music sales 
to the labels. For now, videos will not be for sale.
Universal will spend tens of 
millions of dollars on the proj-ect, and Vevo will be a wholly 
owned Universal subsidiary, 
Caraeff said. YouTube, a sub-sidiary of online advertising 
and search leader Google Inc., 
will provide the technology.
Universal, a unit of France’s 
Vivendi SA, is the world’s larg-est recording company and already has the most watched 
channel on YouTube with some 
3.8 billion views since August 2006.
Doug Morris, Universal’s 
chief executive, is in talks with the other major recording labels 
— Warner Music Group Corp., 
Sony Music Entertainment and EMI Group Ltd. — about par-
ticipating in the venture.YouTube, Universal team up

the best opportunity for 
revenue generation right 
now.”

PORT RICHEY, Fla.  — Pasco County Sheriff’s Office de-
tectives are searching for three men who broke into a home 
and sexually assaulted an elderly woman.
The sheriff’s office said the men broke into 
the house early Wednesday morning, assaulted 
the 89-year-old woman in bed and ransacked 
her home.
The woman went to a neighbor’s home for help, and 
the neighbor took her to the hospital, where deputies were called. The woman has been released from the hospital and is recovering.
The woman told deputies the suspects concealed their 
faces, and she was unable to give a good description.
The sheriff’s office said it is possible the suspects are the 
same people who broke into her home last week and stole her vehicle, which was later found.Police searching

NEW ORLEANS — Fluorescent rodent feces, a 
promising new mosquito repellent and a better flytrap 
are all part of a war on bugs designed to protect U.S. troops around the world.
Researchers in the Pentagon’s Deployed Warfighter 
Protection Research Program highlighted pest-fighting innovations this week at the American Mosquito Con-trol Association convention attended by some 800 sci-entists and insect control experts. Their aim: to take no prisoners among disease-carrying flies, mosquitoes and other bugs that threaten Americans in uniform abroad.
Even the common fly is counted among the enemy.“When you’re deployed, I would say 90 percent of all 
soldiers, service members, are going to have issues with 
filth flies,” said Army Lt. Col. Jason Pike, executive of-
ficer of the 65th Medical Brigade’s Force Health Protec-tion and Preventive Medicine program headquartered in South Korea.
“Filth flies carry many organisms which cause diar-
rhea ... It might not be fatal, but one soldier out of com-mission affects a lot of other people,” he said.
Begun in 2004, the Deployed Warfighter Protec-
tion Research Program dispenses $5 million a year to 
find new ways to combat disease-carrying insects that 
threaten the troops — applications that ultimately could protect the public at large.
Military-driven research has produced past innova-tions against malaria and dengue and helped develop DEET, a key ingredient in most modern repellents. It even has led to chemical-treated fabrics that ward off ticks and mosquitoes.
Fighting bugs is a “global perpetual need,” said pro-
gram coordinator Graham B. White of the Armed Forces Pest Management Board. “Even if nobody went to war for a long time, these things would still need to be de-veloped.”
He said small insecticide sprayers developed through 
the program are now in use. The program also backed 
testing that secured recent Environmental Protection 
Agency approval of an insecticide spray that is highly toxic at low doses to adult mosquitoes but safe for mam-mals.
Now Navy Corpsman Joe Diclaro II is taking aim at 
the housefly. 
“I like to think of it as a death device,” Diclaro said of 
a fold-up flytrap designed to ship flat and be rolled into bug-catching tubes in the field.NATIONAL

� BOTH TENNIS TEAMS WILL 
FACE ALABAMA, BUT THE MEN WILL BE PLAYING ON THE ROAD IN TUSCALOOSA.
By JOSEPH R. HOLZER
Alligator Writer
With everything it has en-
dured this spring, there is one 
constant: The No. 21 UF women’s tennis team wins at home. Every time.
That’s good news for the 
Gators (10-8, 4-4 Southeastern Conference), as their final three dual matches will be played at Linder Stadium. That streak starts with No. 26 Alabama today at 3 p.m.
UF fell five spots in the rank-
ings after dropping two away matches last weekend to LSU and Arkansas. The match against the Tigers marked the sixth time the Gators were defeated 4-3. 
They are coming home at just 
the right time. 
After a 15-0 start, No. 8 Marrit 
Boonstra suffered back-to-back defeats. The junior admittedly feeds off the energy of the home crowd.
The Crimson Tide’s highest-
ranked player is Tiffany Welcher at 105, which also bodes well for Boonstra. 
In doubles, Welcher and Courtney McClane are No. 73.
Still, Alabama (13-5, 3-5 SEC) 
is no pushover. 
This is conference play, where 
rivalry makes up for differences in talent. 
UF is tied for fourth in the SEC 
East. A strong finish will keep them close to the division’s lead-ers.MEN FACE TIDE: The No. 10 UF 
men’s team will finish its season on the road with hopes of being  a host to regionals in May. The Gators (14-6, 5-3 SEC) play the No. 15 Crimson Tide in Tusca-loosa, Ala., today at 4 p.m. 
Carlos Cueto, hot off a win 
against No. 13 Blake Strode in 
UF’s shutout of Arkansas last weekend, said he is feeling better physically and has regained his confidence. The No. 27 singles player will need both against Alabama’s Saketh Myneni, who is No. 34.
Gators coach Andy Jackson 
believes Cueto responded well in defeating Blake after the fresh-man’s loss in his rematch with 
LSU’s Michael 
Venus.
Jackson said 
doubles are also doing well in setting the paces of the matches. The No. 17 duo of Antoine Ben-
neteau and Joey Burkhardt will likely face No. 35 Ricky Dover-spike and Mathieu Thibaudeau. Burkhardt, like Cueto, feels ev-erything is going right with his game and said going on the road against three top-30 teams were each just another match.
The businesslike approach 
was echoed by Jackson.
“We’ve played a lot of match-
es on the road and mutual courts against top-25 teams, so we’re not really going to be scared about it,” Jackson said. Women look to continue winning streak at homeFRIDAY, APRIL 10, 2009  �  ALLIGATOR, 21

les tendon. That was just the 
final blow. Before that, the Gators saw Nicole Ellis, Kailey Tissue and Rebekah Zaiser all on the sidelines. They waved goodbye to Alicia Goodwin, too. For the first time in a long, long time, you’d expect there to be more ice, heating pads and crutches in practice than smiles, perfect landings and pointed toes.
So excuse them if they don’t 
make history as NCAA cham-pions. Where would the UF men’s basketball team have been four years ago without Joakim Noah? 
Not that the gymnasts care 
about any of this. After those injuries, they had some of their best practices, and a fragment-ed team on the training table morphed to a cohesive unit in the gym.
“We’re doing even better 
with what we have than we would be doing with every-body healthy,” Hartung said. “When you’re dealt hard, tough times, you work harder and pull yourself together more as a team. If you focus on the bad things, then bad things are going to come. … I think if any other team was in this situation, they wouldn’t have come this far.”
Maybe not. But who cares 
if another team would have? It doesn’t matter. That’s because we have no reason to tell a group of individuals who have seen a third of their group get hurt that they haven’t achieved success. 
“We’re never going to settle 
for giving up,” junior Melanie Sinclair said. “We’re never going to stop pushing. We’re never going to be seen as the weak team. That’s not us.”
It could have been, though. “This team, mentally, is 
stronger right now than we were the last three years be-cause they’ve had to deal with so much adversity,” UF coach Rhonda Faehn said. “They had to either fight, or they would’ve died and given up. They did not do that.”
This time, success really 
isn’t going to be shown in the standings. If you see a mem-ber of the gymnastics team in a week and a half on campus, and she’s smiling, then the team succeeded. With how these past few weeks have gone, it won’t be surprising to see some goofy grins on their faces. In this case, victory can be seen on a face and not in a box score.
to continue shuffling Adams, Mike Mooney, Jerico 
Weitzel and Clayton Pisani in the two middle-infield positions until he finds a fit he likes. The foursome has combined for 33 of the teams miscues.
“We got to catch the ball better,” O’Sullivan said. 
“If we don’t play better defense, unfortunately, I can assure you that it’s going to be up and down.”
The more extra outs UF gives opponents, the 
harder it is for the Gators’ pitchers. 
O’Sullivan has named Jeff Barfield (2-0, 2.84 ERA) 
tonight’s starter and plans to use either Stephen Locke or Nick Maronde, both lefties, on Saturday. 
One of his main concerns was the number of pro-
ductive left-handed hitters on Auburn’s roster, and he will probably trot out whichever pitcher doesn’t start Game 2 on Sunday.
the team’s comeback.
Enea admitted how unusual 
it was to dogpile after midseason games, but she still wanted the team to meet her at home plate.
“It’s so funny because last sea-
son, we won to go to the World Series, and we jumped up and down like little 12-year-old girls and didn’t even dogpile,” Enea said. “We always make fun of that. Then when Kelsey hit hers and we dogpiled, we were like, ‘We dogpiled against Mississippi State but not to go to the World Series.’”
The Wildcats enter Friday’s 
doubleheader fresh off a come-from-behind victory of their own. Kentucky used back-to-back home runs in the seventh inning to top No. 12 Tennessee 6-5 on Wednesday. 
Kentucky also brings quality 
pitching into the conference se-ries. Freshman Chanda Bell has struck out 193 batters in 149 in-nings this season,  comparable to pitcher Stacey Nelson’s 205 strikeouts in her 163 2/3 innings of work. Bell also threw the first no-hitter in school history earlier this year. 
If the Gators pull off another 
dramatic victory on the road this weekend, another dogpile wouldn’t be much of a surprise considering the emotion this team has displayed in the last week.
“It’s awesome. I don’t even 
know if they’re doing it on pur-pose. You can’t fake passion,” Walton said.WALESZONIA’S RECOVERY ‘ON SCHEDULE’:  Center fielder Kim 
Waleszonia, who has missed the last 24 games with a tibial pla-
teau fracture in her left leg, was wearing her usual No. 5 jer-sey for Wednes-day night’s 
game against FSU. Walton said her recov-ery is “right on 
schedule,” and he hopes to have her back for the postseason. 
“She’s exactly where she needs 
to be,” Walton said. “The goal all along was postseason. We’re not going to push much earlier than at least senior weekend (May 2-3).”

If earning the team’s first 
Southeastern Conference 
road victory against Vander-bilt was learning to walk, then a series win in Auburn this weekend will be learning to run for UF.
After a pair of midweek 
home wins against Bethune-
Cookman and Central Flori-
da, the Gators (21-11, 7-5 SEC) will take their 1-5 conference 
record on the road to Plains-
man Park to take on the Tigers 
(22-10, 6-6 SEC) in a three-
game set. 
“Any SEC weekend is 
big,” senior Avery Barnes said. “And we have a little bit 
of making up to do after last 
weekend.”
The Gators are 3-7 away 
from Gainesville this season, 
including a 3-0 loss to North 
Florida in Jacksonville, but 
Auburn may be just the place to get on track.
The Tigers are 16-6 at 
home, including two losses to Elon, and only two of those 16 wins have come against SEC opponents. 
“I don’t want it to be any 
more important this week-
end then the next,” UF coach 
Kevin O’Sullivan said in an SEC teleconference on Thurs-day. “They’re all important. At some point this season, we have to learn to play on the road.” 
The biggest challenge for 
UF will be holding Auburn’s high-powered offense in check. Five hitters on the Ti-gers’ roster have eight or more home runs, and no starter has less than three bombs on the season. 
By comparison, freshman 
Preston Tucker leads the Gators with seven round-trip-pers, and six of those came in his last three games. UF’s of-fense, which has averaged 9 runs in the last nine games, has been nothing to scoff at lately and is lead by a potent top of the order.
The No. 1 through 5 batters 
are hitting .337 for the season 
and have a combined on-base 
percentage of just over .430. 
The task of holding down 
the Tigers’ offense falls as 
much on the infield defense 
as it does on the pitching staff. 
The Gators’ team ERA is 3.82, but they are allowing 5 runs per game because so many 
of the opposing teams’ scores 
have been unearned. UF has 
made 52 errors on the season, and all but two of them have come in the infield. 
O’Sullivan said he plans

I don’t know. And that’s not because 
I’m just of average intelligence.
You don’t know either, and there’s a 
good chance you’re smarter than I am.
Only 16 people in the world know. 
They’re the athletes and coaches of the UF 
gymnastics team. 
If the Gators advance to the Super Six at 
the NCAA Championships in one week as the rankings predict them to, nobody out-side of the team can evaluate their success.
If they become the fifth team ever to win 
an NCAA title, great. If they bow out on 
Day 1 and don’t even advance to the Super 
Six finale, it’s up to them to measure their 
level of disappointment for not winning. 
But it’s also up to them to measure their pride for making it as far as they have with one-third of their team on injured reserve.
When UF opened its season against 
Oklahoma about three months ago, this wasn’t the case. The Gators were on 
course to become 
the fifth team to 
ever win a cham-
pionship, or at the very least be one 
of the favorites to. 
That was the obvi-
ous goal, and it was 
a legitimate one. UF 
had one of its most talented and experi-
enced teams in a long time.
“We had the talent and the amazing 
routines to win,” senior Corey Hartung said. “It was just a matter of making sure 
each girl believed that.”

When the UF softball team beat Cali-
fornia to advance to the Women’s Col-
lege World Series last season, the players didn’t properly celebrate the occasion on the field. Coach Tim Walton said his team didn’t know what to do after the 4-2 victory.
After two walk-off home runs at 
home in the last week, the Gators have found their preferred method of on-field celebration: the dogpile. 
The simple act of team camaraderie, 
first displayed Saturday after Kelsey Bruder’s walk-off grand slam against Mississippi State, impressed Walton more than anything his team has done on the field all year.
“As many games as I’ve coached 
here, Saturday was the first time we’ve ever executed a dogpile and executed what looked and appeared to be a lot of fun,” Walton said. “Kelsey hitting that grand slam on Saturday kind of gave us a shot in the arm and fired everybody up. I was more excited about the dogpile than I was about any of the wins we’ve 
had this year.”
The No. 1 Gators 
(40-3, 18-1 Southeast-ern Conference) will look to take that en-
ergy to Lexington, Ky., where they will take on the Wildcats (24-13, 7-8 SEC) in a 
three-game series, starting with a dou-bleheader today at 4 p.m.
UF capped its 4-3 walk-off win 
against FSU on Wednesday with an-other dogpile at home plate, this time on top of left fielder Francesca Enea, whose solo shot to left field completed Dogpiling UF faces ’Cats

 Two years after escaping a con-
gested backﬁ  eld at Southern Cali-
fornia, Emmanuel Moody is in fa-miliar territory.
Moody transferred to UF hoping 
to become the Gators’ every-down back, but injuries and a slew of tal-ented teammates have him ﬁ  ghting for playing time.
From the beginning, Moody 
had concerns about whether or not he would be able to ﬁ  t into UF’s spread offense.
“Coming in here, that’s deﬁ  nite-
ly one thing I had on my mind,” Moody said. “But sitting down with coach Meyer and the other coaches, they were just telling me, ‘If we have a back that can do it, we will do it.’”
While the 6 foot, 210-pound 
Moody spent his time in and out 
of the lineup during UF’s national-
championship run last season, the smaller, quicker Chris Rainey and Jeff Demps combined for 11 touch-downs and nearly 1,300 yards.
Moody rushed for 417 yards 
and a touchdown in 2008, but most of his carries came well after games were in hand.
Moody said he spent the off-
season with his playbook and has eased concerns coaches once had about his knowledge of the offen-sive schemes.
“Right now, I feel real comfort-
able with the offense and real com-fortable with the coaches,” he said.
With Demps opting to forgo the rest of spring practice to focus on track, Moody hopes he can start to win over the coaching staff.
“Trust is simply consistency,” 
Moody said. “It’s to be consistent 
every day — about not having one 
good day and then sucking the next day. (It’s about) day in and day out, being consistent and having a good attitude and showing the coaches that you’re here to play.”
Running backs coach Kenny 
Carter said Moody is playing with a new mentality this spring and 
that he’s running the ball with more 
conﬁ  dence than he did a year ago.
“The thing that 
happened to him from the end of the season to now coming into the spring is he has really bought into 
what we’re trying 
to do in our sys-
tem,” Carter said. 
“He understands what we’re doing, and he’s more comfortable. We ex-pect him to really take off now and be the guy that we expected him to be when he transferred here.”
With the departure of playmak-
er Percy Harvin and the addition of under-center I-formation pack-ages to the offense this spring — 
which may not make it to the fall 
— Moody might be seeing more of the ball in the future.
“It means a lot to him (to be the 
No. 1 running back),” Carter said. “And you can see it in the way he’s playing.”
Moody rushed for 459 yards on 
79 carries for two touchdowns in just 9 games in his lone season with the Trojans.
“Could he be that guy? Abso-
lutely,” UF coach Urban Meyer said. “But that means pass protec-tion. That means every day. We haven’t seen that yet.”
Moody was a Parade All-Amer-
ican in high school and named the Paciﬁ  c-10 Conference Offensive Freshman of the Year in 2006 before transferring to UF.“All I can handle is what I can 
handle,” Moody said. 
“All I can control is my attitude. 
I try to just be positive and have a good attitude about the situation I’m in.” FRIDAY, APRIL 10, 2009 � ALLIGATOR, 23

 THE ASSOCIATED PRESS 
  
 BOSTON — It’s like the off-season never 
happened for Matt Garza and the Tampa Bay 
Rays.
Garza pitched seven innings of four-hit 
ball, and the Rays hit three homers off Daisuke Matsuzaka to beat the Boston Red Sox 4-3 on Thursday and win their opening three-game 
series.
Evan Longoria had three hits, including a 
two-run homer, and Matt Joyce and Shawn 
Riggans also homered for the defending American League champions.
“We just wanted to establish ourselves ear-
ly in the season, set the tone and let the people know it wasn’t a ﬂ  uke,” said Garza, who al-
lowed 1 run and three walks, striking out ﬁ  ve 
to improve to 6-1 in his career against Boston. “We’re here to battle for a while.”
Matsuzaka was MVP of the World Base-
ball Classic for the second straight time, but his season debut more closely resembled his performance in Game 5 of last year’s ALCS, when he gave up three homers in four innings 
before the Red Sox rallied from a seven-run 
deﬁ  cit to win 8-7 and force the series back to Tampa Bay.
“The mistakes really hurt him,” Red Sox 
manager Terry Francona said. 
“They’re a good team. We’d like to think 
we are.” Tampa Bay takes season-opening series against BostonCarter
