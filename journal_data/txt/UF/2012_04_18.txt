Fifth-year Ph.D. student Joshua Horton, 27, and others protest budget cuts proposed to the computer and information sciences and engineering department Tuesday. They staged a sit-in outside of College of Engineering Dean Cammy Abernathy’s ofﬁ  ce from 3 p.m. to 5 p.m.

Some of the about 100 students at Tues-
day’s Save CISE sit-in analyzed algorithms 
as they lined the walls of Weil Hall. Others programmed. One played Farmville.
But ﬁ  ve met with College of Engineer-
ing Dean Cammy Abernathy and university Provost Joe Glover to discuss Abernathy’s proposal created in response to the college’s budget for the 2012-13 ﬁ  scal year.
Gov. Rick Scott signed a budget today 
that would decrease the college’s budget by 5.86 percent, or about $4 million. Aber-
nathy’s proposal involves restructuring the Depart-
ment of Computer and 
Information Science and Engineering rather than spreading cuts across all 10 engineering departments. Since last week, students, faculty and community 
members have conducted 
protests to urge her to reconsider.
Tuesday, the dean extended the input 
period to May 7, according to a post on the college’s website. Abernathy also released some ﬁ  nancial data.
“The people who we’ve wanted to at-
tract attention from have ﬁ  nally decided to 
acknowledge that there is a student commu-
nity, and we have concerns as well,” said 26-year-old Ph.D. student Shivashankar Halan. “They showed that they were interested and listening to us.”Engineering students’ sit-in results in discussion

� THE GOVERNOR HAS UNTIL 
FRIDAY TO SIGN OR VETO THE TUITION INCREASE BILL.

Gov. Rick Scott signed Florida’s bud-
get Tuesday , conﬁ  rming $300 million in 
budget cuts for the State University Sys-tem.
Despite leaving UF’s wallet $36.5 
million lighter, the $70-billion budget includes $6 million for the completion of a research and academic center at Lake Nona in Orlando, where construction was stalled due to lack of funding.
Board of Governors Chairman Dean 
Colson said in a statement that the board is grateful to the governor and the leg-islature for funding some long-awaited construction projects like Lake Nona.
Scott vetoed $142.7 million in state 
and local projects from the legislature’s spending plan — less than a quarter of 
the amount he vetoed last year.
Tuesday’s budget included a 5-per-
cent tuition increase in the Florida Col-
lege System, which doesn’t affect Flori-da’s 11 state universities.
Scott approved the allocation of mon-
ey for the possible creation of a 12th state university, Florida Polytechnic Univer-sity in Lakeland, but he hasn’t yet ap-
proved the bill that would create it.
Scott also has yet to sign a bill that 
would allow UF and Florida State Uni-
versity to increase tuition more than the current 15-percent cap, although he must make a decision by Friday.

UF students will soon be able to use their 
free printing credits without standing in lines 
in the Reitz Union’s Student Government Printing Lab.
Student Body President Anthony Reynolds 
signed an executive order Tuesday night that extended the free printing program to ﬁ  ve ad-ditional locations on campus. Previously, stu-dents were able to print 250 pages free each semester at the lab in the Reitz Union.
Students will be able to print for free at La 
Casita, the Institute of Black Culture, the Asian Paciﬁ  c Islander American Affairs Resource Room in Peabody Hall, Levin College of Law’s JUMBA resource room and McCarty Hall A.
La Casita and the Institute of Black Culture already offer free printing, Reynolds said, and he hopes they will be linked to UF’s system that keeps track of students’ printing by the start of Summer A. His goal is to have all the extension 
labs open before Summer B or by the end of the 
summer at the latest.
SG has been seeking op-
tions for expanding free 
printing, he said, and it’s 
been especially important 
since he stepped into the role 
of president.
“I think that would be a 
very tangible way to help 
the Student Body,” he said.
Reynolds said UF Student Affairs will foot 
the estimated $200,000 bill.

Jose Soto, co-president of UF’s Graduate Assistants United, speaks about budget cuts to the 
computer and information science and engineering department at the Student Senate meet-ing Tuesday night.
Student government
SAMANTHA SHAVELL
Alligator Writer
The Student Senate passed two bills at 
Tuesday night’s meeting that propose re-
structuring part of Student Government’s executive branch. The bills need one more round of approval to go into effect.
The bills focus on reorganizing agen-
cies and cabinets within SG. Agencies are more autonomous and focus on specific programs, while cabinets deal with pro-grams for groups of students, said Student Body President-elect Tj Villamil after the meeting.
The Agency Reorganization Act will 
cut the Gator Health and Safety and Muse-
um Nights agencies. It will also amend the 
IMAGE Agency to Action SG, which will promote events, activities and interests of SG through media.
Sen. Max Stein said the changes will 
make it nothing more than an advertis-
ing agency . He said that while IMAGE 
has clearly defined duties, the proposed agency does not.
During the meeting, however, the Sen-
ate re-added the responsibility to broad-cast meetings of Student Senate, which may contain the Senate committee meet-ings. The bill then passed.
Villamil said he was planning on film-
ing the Senate meetings anyway.
The Cabinet Reorganization Act will 
downsize the 23 cabinets to 17. The bill also changed the name of the president’s cabinet to Campus Executive Secretaries, 
which will deal with policies.
Several senators were concerned that 
the bill proposed would cut the Graduate 
and Professional Affairs cabinet.
Sen. Carly Wilson said the bill elimi-
nates the graduate and professional stu-dents’ representation from cabinet. The bill also proposed to change the Secretary of Family to the Secretary of Family, Grad-
uate and Satellite Affairs.
Villamil said he planned to have un-
dersecretaries who would deal with those 
specific areas.
Sen. Elizabeth LaRue, a sponsor of both 
reorganization acts, said these changes will enhance transparency in the Senate.
“A lot of the changes made will reduce 
redundant positions,” she said.
The Senate unanimously passed a bill 
supporting the efforts led by students to protect UF’s engineering departments, es-pecially the computer and information sci-ence and engineering department.
Last week, the College of Engineering 
dean proposed a budget cut of about $4 million.
About 20 senators spoke on behalf of 
the bill in support of the the department.
“As voices for our constituents, we can-
not support those cuts,” said Sen. Joey Mi-chaels.

� THE APP WILL SHOW MALE-TO-
FEMALE RATIOS AT BARS.
CHRIS ALCANTARA
Alligator Contributing Writer
Students will soon be able to check out 
Gainesville bars and clubs without leaving 
their apartments with an extension of an app made for barhopping.
SceneTap LLC, a Texas-based social-net-
working company, will add information about seven Gainesville bars and clubs to its free nightlife app Tuesday.
The app will include The Vault Night 
Club, Gator City , Rockeys Dueling Piano Bar, Envy, Stereo Nightclub, Infusion Hookah Bar & Lounge and Sharab Lounge. It shows users the average age of people in the bar or club as well as the male-to-female ratio, said Marissa 
Betley, a spokeswoman for SceneTap.
The app will also allow venues to post cou-
pons and specials for users to buy, and it will 
show the drink specials at various locations.
SceneTap is free to download for both iP-
hone and Android devices.
SceneTap collects gender and age data 
through the two sensors installed at the en-trances and exits of each venue, Betley said. 
One sensor will keep an updated person 
count, while the other will detect faces to fig-ure out how many males and females are in the room.
All data will be collected anonymously, she 
said, meaning there won’t be pictures taken of people who walk into the venues.
Since SceneTap’s launch in July 2011, about 
78,000 people have used the app, Betley said.
Gainesville will be the fourth city to go live 
with SceneTap. Chicago, Austin and Bloom-ington, Ind., are included in the app.
After Gainesville’s launch, the app will go 
live next week in other college towns, includ-ing Athens, Ga., and Madison, Wis.
Jon Petrie, general manager of Sharab Lounge, said he believes SceneTap will help adjust drink specials for patrons.
“If the technology works and pinpoints 
what kind of demographic we are getting in here, I think it will be great,” he said.
Brandon Eberhart, a 20-year-old business 
administration sophomore at Santa Fe Col-lege, said he thinks the app will help him plan his nights before he walks out the door.
But he said there’s a chance that the male-
to-female-ratio data could be skewed if a male has effeminate features or vice-versa.
Mark Hatton, a 22-year-old political science 
senior at UF, agreed but said he thinks face de-tection by SceneTap sensors will upset some people who are concerned about privacy.
“People may not like the idea that their 
faces are being scanned,” he said.App to bring people-tracking technology to Gainesville bars

Tussock moth cocoons, like those clustered under a pavilion at Maguire Village, can be found under park 
benches, signs and other crannies. Allergenic caterpillar hair, which may cause a rash on some people, might be trapped in the cocoons, said Eileen Buss, an associate professor and extension specialist with UF’s Department of Entomology and Nematology.
ELIZABETH HAMILTON
Alligator Contributing Writer
Fuzzy, tan cocoons might not 
look as threatening as hordes of 
crimson-headed caterpillars, but 
touching them can still cause stu-
dents and area residents to have allergic reactions.
Contact with the tussock moth 
caterpillar’s black and white hairs can cause localized swelling and itching. The caterpillar popula-tion this year is especially large.
People should also be careful 
with the cocoons. 
The caterpillars’ hair gets 
trapped in them, making them 
equally allergenic, said Eileen 
Buss, an associate professor and extension specialist with UF’s Entomology and Nematology Department.
This is the largest population 
since 2001, she said, but Buss didn’t know the numbers. 
She said population size is 
cyclical, but the warm weather 
might also be partly responsible.
Ambrose Coulliette, a 24-year-
old electrical engineering senior, 
said he saw caterpillars raining 
from trees when he walked from 
the bus to Hidden Village Apart-ments.
“There’s a whole s—t-ton of 
them between Archer and Old 
Archer,” he said.
Buss recommended pressing 
packaging tape against skin irri-
tated by the hair. 
Pulling the tape off will re-
move the tiny hairs, she said, but prescription-strength cream 
might be necessary to alleviate 
symptoms.
She also recommended people 
throw away cocoons instead of spraying them with chemicals to 
reduce next year’s population.Caterpillars, cocoons can cause allergic reactions if touched

The term “Freemason” has been cloaked 
in secrecy and rumors over the years, but an 
Ocala Masonic lodge hopes to satisfy curios-ity by hosting a rare open house.
Marion-Dunn Masonic Lodge No. 19 of 
Ocala, located at 1810 SE 36th Ave., will host an open house at 6:30 p.m. Thursday.
Gainesville and Ocala residents are in-
vited to attend, said Lodge Master John Ma-cias.
This is the second time the lodge has host-
ed an open house for the public in its 163-year history. The first was hosted last July.
Macias said he expects 30 to 45 people to 
attend, the same as the last open house.Seating is limited, so attendees are en-
couraged to call ahead to reserve a seat.  
Masonic leaders will give a presentation 
on the basic structure, precepts and order of 
Freemasonry, the oldest active fraternity in 
the United States, Macias said.
“We believe in patriotism,” Macias said. 
“We believe in being respectful to yourself and women. We believe in the public school system. These are American tenets, and you should want your sons to know these.”
Male community members will have the 
opportunity to express interest in joining the 
Masonic order during the open house. 
Very few people know how to get in-
volved with Freemasonry, Macias said, but 
it’s as simple as going to a lodge and asking.
Macias, a military veteran, said the lodge is hosting the open house to inform people about what Freemasonry is and to dispel any negative rumors.
He said the definition of Freemasonry var -
ies based on the motives of the individual. 
His definition is a fraternity of like-mind-
ed men who help each other and the com-munity grow.
“We want the community to sit down with us and understand that we are normal guys here to help the community, and for wives to know that their husbands are not a part of a drinking club,” he said.
Cree Armstead, a 23-year-old UF alumna, 
has a close friend who is part of the Masonic order, but she thinks of it as an underground society.
“I’m a lot more familiar with the tradition-
al Greek organizations because I attended a lot of their events and have very close friends who are members,” she said. “Freemasons were always kind of on the hush-hush.”
Macias disagrees. “There nothing really secretive about us,” 
he said. “For whatever reason, people are scared of Freemasons or something. We’ve heard the rumors out there.” Ocala Freemason lodge to host its second open house in historyTYLER JETT

A Gainesville man almost 
ran over his girlfriend Monday 
afternoon.
Antwan D. Mosley, 23, of 
3220 SW 26th Terrace, was ar -
rested on charges of aggravated battery and failing to stop after a crash that involved an injury , according to Gainesville Police.
Mosley and Tiare Green got 
into an argument at about 3:20 p.m. at Lewis Place at Ironwood Apartments, 4121 NE 15th St. Green told GPD she and Mosley 
have a child and, until recently, 
lived together.
After the argument, Mosley 
steered his car into Green. He drove forward after hitting her, and she gripped the driver-side door so he couldn’t run over her, police said. Mosley dragged Green for about two feet before she fell out of the way.
Mosley then drove away . Green called GPD and told 
officer Mary 
Davis that 
the left side of her body hurt. 
Davis did 
not see any injuries.
M o s l e y 
turned him-
self in at about 6:45 p.m. 
He denied hitting Green, 
but he was held at the Alachua County Jail on Tuesday in lieu of a $25,000 bond.

Alligator Writer
The county is moving forward 
with an agreement that will reim-
burse the St. Francis House and the Alachua County Housing Author -
ity for homeless services.
The county approved a two-year 
agreement with the city and the two organizations in October that said the county would pay $25,000 for an emergency shelter for the homeless.
The city will provide an addi-
tional $25,000 for the shelters.
The county recently received the 
paperwork necessary to pass the funding to the organizations, said county spokesman Mark Sexton.
The agreement is intended to provide funding for this year and next year. However, next year’s funding could be more or less than $25,000, depending on the available funds for the 2012-13 fiscal year.
Sexton said the funding will 
be distributed within the next two months.
Emergency shelter is opened 
whenever there is a threat to the safety of those who sleep outside. This includes when the tempera-ture dips below 45 degrees, if it’s unbearably hot or if there is a natu-
ral disaster.
Kent Vann, executive director 
of St. Francis House, said his shel-
ter was able to cover the costs out-of-pocket, but it has taken longer than usual to get funding from the county.
“We provide the services to the 
people that need it, then we bill [the 
county],” he said. “I don’t know 
why it took so long.”
On an average night, St. Francis 
House can shelter 35 people tempo-rarily and an additional 33 people in permanent housing. During an emergency, it can open up to 60 ad-ditional beds.
The shelter routinely provides 
refuge during frigid nights, such as in 2010 when temperatures dropped below 30 degrees Fahrenheit.
The Alachua County Housing 
Authority provides low-cost hous-ing to families and individuals in need of financial assistance.
Minnie Rolark, assistant direc-
tor for Alachua County community 
support services, said this is the 
seventh year the county has pro-vided the funding. She also said the county received the necessary pa-pers from the city recently, and it’s not unusual for the payment to be delayed within the county.
“The paperwork has to go 
through two legal teams,” she said, 
“so sometimes it takes a little bit 
longer.”

WASHINGTON — The 
Secret Service prostitution 
scandal escalated Tuesday with the disclosure that at least 20 women had been in 
hotel rooms with U.S. agents 
and military personnel just before President Barack Obama arrived for a summit with Latin American lead-ers. The head of the Secret Service said he had referred the matter to an independent government investigator.
Secret Service Director 
Mark Sullivan, shuttling be-tween briefings for lawmak-ers on Capitol Hill, was pep-pered with questions about whether the women had ac-cess to sensitive information that could have jeopardized Obama’s security.
Sullivan said the 11 Se-
cret Service agents and 10 military personnel under in-vestigation were telling dif-ferent stories about who the women were. Sullivan has dispatched more investiga-tors to Colombia to interview 
the women, said Rep. Peter 
King, R-N.Y., chairman of the House Homeland Security Committee.
“Some are admitting (the 
women) were prostitutes, 
others are s a y i n g 
they’re not, 
they’re just 
women they met at the hotel bar,” King said in a tele-phone in-
terview. Sullivan said none 
of the women, who had to 
surrender their IDs at the ho-tel, were minors. “But prosti-tutes or not, to be bringing a foreign national back into a secure zone is a problem.”Officials investigating

Gainesville Police arrested a man accused 
of throwing eggs and breaking a front-door 
window with a 2-by-4 on Tuesday morning.
Justin A. Arredondo, 25, of Hawthorne, 
was charged with attempted burglary and 
criminal mischief. 
Arredondo moved in with his brother 
and Katie Williams at 730 NE 10th Ave. in 
March. He promised to stay only two weeks, Williams said. He stayed four.Williams said she and Arredondo bick-
ered. He depressed her, telling her he was worthless and belonged in jail.
Also, he brought women back — too 
many of them. Williams works as a cook and server at Leonardo’s Pizza of Millhop-per and often doesn’t come home until after 
2 a.m. Sometimes, she would wake up two 
or three hours later to Arredondo’s screams during sex.
Williams left a message for Arredondo 
on Sunday: Stop bringing women home. Later, a neighbor told Williams that Arre-dondo had entertained three women that 
day. When she came home from work at about 2:30 Tuesday morning, she told him he needed to leave.
Arredondo refused. He 
told Williams the only way 
he was leaving was in the 
back of a police car, she 
said. Then, he ran outside with about 15 eggs and a 
beer bottle.
Arredondo ran to a neighboring duplex, chucked the beer bottle up an outdoor stair -
case and unloaded his eggs against a front door, Williams said. He then grabbed a 12-foot-long 2-by-4 that he had brought back from a construction site where he worked.
He threw the wood against the front door 
several times. Once, the 2-by-4 bounced off a 
pole and hit Arredondo in the face, Williams 
said. Eventually, he smashed the window on the front door, according to police.
He was held at Alachua County Jail on 
Tuesday in lieu of a $20,000 bond.

and don’t be afraid to get dirty at the Florida Museum of 
Natural History on Saturday.
The first Earth Day BioBlitz, which runs from 10 a.m. to 
3 p.m., is part of the museum’s Earth Day celebration. The 
event is free and open to all ages.
Catherine Carey, public programs coordinator at the 
museum, said a bioblitz is a quick way to get a population 
number for plant and animal specimens.This bioblitz is a little bit different. Instead of going into nature and counting populations, 
participants will see how scientists get specimens.
“Why look at the environment when you can look at all 
the things in the neighborhood?” Carey asked.
Leeann Bright, marketing and public relations coordi-
nator for the museum, said there will be a variety of ac-
tivities for all ages.
Inside the museum, the UF entomology department 
will have some displays, and other organizations will talk 
about their mammal and bird collections.
Outside, the UF Natural Area Teaching Laboratory will be set up along three different trails to show collec-tions and field research techniques.
Visitors can also learn why researchers need to collect 
plants and animals for study and the importance of col-lecting.
“The environment truly affects all of us, so it’s impor -
tant to see how research is done,” Bright said.
Carey said the teaching laboratory areas will be sta-
tioned along the Upland Pine Trail, the Old Field Trail and the Storm Ecological Enhancement Project Trail, oth-erwise known as the Wetlands Trail, behind the museum 
and the Phillips Center for the Performing Arts.
The trails are easily accessible with man-made paths 
and a boardwalk through the SEEP trail, Carey said.Florida Museum of Natural History to host ‘bioblitz’ for Earth Day
� RABBI GAIL SWEDROE WILL 
ARRIVE THIS SUMMER.

After conducting a national 
search, UF Hillel has hired a new 
campus rabbi.
Rabbi Gail Swedroe, a Califor -nia native, will join the UF Hillel staff this summer.
She will be the first female rabbi 
to serve UF students.
“Rabbi Gail will bring a pres-
ence not just to UF Hillel, but to the university itself,” UF Hillel Execu-tive Director Keith Dvorchik said.
Swedroe is a fifth-year rabbini-
cal student at the Jewish Theologi-cal Seminary in New York City. She will graduate this spring.
Jessica Davis, Jewish student life 
coordinator at UF Hillel, said she is 
looking forward to Swedroe’s ar -
rival in Gainesville.
She said Hillel interviewed 
many candidates on the phone and 
brought three to campus for small group meetings with students and one-on-one meetings with the staff.
Dvorchik said he believes Swedroe will help connect all faiths across campus.
Swedroe will join Rabbi Daniel 
Wolnerman, a traditional rabbi, and become the second full-time rabbi at UF Hillel.
Davis said Hillel hired Swedroe, 
a conservative rabbi, to better serve the needs of about 8,000 Jewish stu-dents on campus.
Based on the population of stu-dents that visits UF Hillel, Davis said, there are more conservative and reform Jewish students on 
campus than traditional students.
Swedroe said she is looking for -
ward to her move to Gainesville.
“I am really excited to work 
with students and find ways to 
make Judaism and Jewish tradition accessible and meaningful in their lives,” she said.UF Hillel hires first female rabbi after conducting nationwide searchFree event runs from 10 a.m. to 3 p.m. SaturdayArredondo

The scene with the most impact in “The Shawshank Redemption,” for me, is the one in which Brooks ties a rope to the ceiling, scribbles “Brooks was 
here” on the wall, and kicks the chair from under him-self.
What’s significant about the scene is that Brooks had 
recently been released from a long prison sentence. He seemed OK in prison. But life outside — freedom, the opportunity to attain material goods and all the other things people equate with happiness — was too much for him.
To me, the scene underscores the relativity of satisfac-
tion and happiness: One can be satisfied in what others perceive as abysmal circumstances and vice versa.
On Sunday, a college student with all the opportunity 
in the world ended his own life. Presumably, the lives of a mother, a father, a friend and many others  were changed forever when he tragically jumped to his death.
I don’t know what the student was going through. I 
don’t know if he had talked to anyone before he jumped, and I don’t know his mental state or the circumstances surrounding his death.
All I know is that his death was a tragedy. And for 
every person who commits suicide, there are hundreds, if not thousands, of others who are considering it.
When we look at the lives of students who commit 
suicide, it seems like they have everything the world can offer: youth, education and endless opportunity. In other cases, they may have hidden, underlying personal prob-lems.
Either way, satisfaction is relative, and we can never 
be sure what someone is going through.
One thing that is difficult for people with psychologi-
cal problems is the stigma of seeking help for them. So many are unable to find help for their problems out of shame and fear of judgment.
Indeed, the judgment surrounding psychological ill-ness is extreme in America.
A study in 1991 by the Na-
tional Mental Health Associa-tion found that 43 percent of Americans viewed depression as a “personal weakness.” Al-though the study was done more than 20 years ago, chances are our views on this illness haven’t changed very much.
Putting aside our uncertainties of mental problems, 
no matter what one believes a particular mental problem is, the goal of seeking help is still the same: to rid oneself of the mental problem and to go on and live a prosper -
ous life.
Nobody wants to live in a world where everyone is 
depressed. One does not put a burden on the world by seeking help. One should not be ashamed for seeking help. Getting help for mental suffering is best for the one seeking help and for society as a whole.
College life presents unique circumstances. Some find 
the challenges inspiring, and some find them difficult.
There’s an abundance of students who live in social 
residence halls, go out and dance at Sharab until 2 a.m. and go back to their dorms still feeling like they are alone in the world.
If you’re considering seeing a professional for mental 
help — even if you’re just going through rough times — then help yourself and see them. Somewhere, someone cares.
If you are feeling low, reach out to someone. If you 
notice a friend who seems to be in a bad place, reach out to him or her.
In either case, there are a lot of resources at your dis-
posal.

Campaign Conundrum
SG Election codes 
raise questions
Politicians, especially those who have been in office for a 
while, often talk a lot about reforming the “system.”
Many have lauded efforts to reform campaigns and 
elections, whether it be through finance laws, advertising regu-
lations or disclosure requirements. However, one has to wonder 
if these reforms are meant to encourage a more open political 
discussion, or if they are meant to prevent new voices from en-
tering the discussion by insulating those in power from success-
ful challengers.
When looking through the pages and pages of UF Student 
Government’s “700 codes,” the rules and regulations govern-ing SG elections, most rules seem logical and somewhat tame in 
their approach to keeping the system fair.
However, some of the codes are quite questionable, especially 
when it comes to their possible implications for free speech.
The first questionable, and probably most troubling, rule per -
tains to code 762.0, which states that campaign material “shall be labeled with the phrase ‘Registered Political Advertisement’” followed by the name of the person “who authorized the cre-
ation of, disbursement of, or payment for” that campaign mate-
rial.
While there may be a seemingly coherent argument for want-
ing to make sure that all campaigning materials distributed are 
legitimate, it is in the definition of campaign material that one 
becomes concerned.
Code 700.4 (e) defines campaign material as “any print or 
electronic material used for the purpose of supporting a can-
didate or political party for an elective Student Body office, an initiative, a referendum question or proposed constitutional 
amendment.”
This is a somewhat disturbing rule, especially in the age of 
online communication and social networking. If I have a conver -
sation with a candidate running for office on Facebook and that candidate fails to put “Reg. Pol. Ad” after everything he or she 
says, is the candidate violating election codes?
If someone posts something that the party in power does not 
like and the poster of that material fails to put “Reg. Pol. Ad,” can the party in power bring charges of election code violations 
against the minority party?
Let’s face it, the party in power will likely appoint people to 
the Elections Commission that are favorable to that party, given 
the current codes.
We want to make sure that we are clear: This is not about 
Unite Party versus Students Party.
Our argument stems from our overall concern about the stu-
dents’ ability to be fairly represented and their ability to debate 
and discuss issues without fear that their speech might come 
into question.
Tomorrow, we will discuss another SG election code we feel 
has problematic implications for the free speech of students at UF.

As many of us already know, a member of The Gator Nation, 
Michael Edmonds Jr., took his life Sunday . I write not only out of my grief at having lost a friend, but also out of grief 
at my own actions. I find myself in a position that is my personal nightmare: Michael Edmonds Jr. asked me for help Saturday, and I 
did not come through for him the way I could have. I write to share 
his words and my regrets in the hope that these experiences can inspire others to a steadfast commitment to respond to members of our community who express a need for connection, no matter how busy life gets.
Michael and I often met up when he was feeling down, but, of 
course, I never imagined it would come to this. On the day of his death, I was on my way back to Gainesville from Cedar Key when I received his message: “I need your help sometime soon.”
We sent a few messages back and forth, and made plans to meet 
Thursday night (when my life as a grad student, teacher and re-searcher had calmed down). He assured me he’d be at work Sun-day afternoon, and I promised to call him when I got back into town at about 4 p.m. I didn’t get back at 4 p.m. When I did get home, my workload was such that I flat-out forgot to call. Links about “someone” who had jumped off the stadium flickered on my Facebook newsfeed a few times. I didn’t give them a second glance. Tragedies happen every day, and I never dreamed the per -
son in question could have been Michael.
After a night of grading and lesson planning, I showed up to 
teach the next day, planning to call Mike in the afternoon. One of my students asked, “What do you think about this guy?” and held up a copy of the Alligator.
“What guy?” I asked“Michael Edmonds Jr.,” he read aloud.My legs went to jelly . I started to shake. My gut soured. I could 
have called him. Stopped by. Anything.
I immediately started to make excuses in my mind: “I didn’t 
think it was that serious.”
“He didn’t tell me he was suicidal.”
“I didn’t know it was urgent. I was 
going to make time later.”
This lapse in judgment is even 
more tragic when I think back to my Sunday . I woke up to a stressful email from one my bosses, obsessed over 
my work for a few hours, took an hour off to go to church and then meant to head back home. The message at church was “Hugs, Kisses and Prayers,” and that we all need to connect and feel loved in an increasingly difficult world, especially in times of struggle. Michael reached out to connect. I took time to text him back and shoot up a quick prayer. And that’s it.
Even after hearing this message and letting it move me to tears 
while in the service, I didn’t call back. My work, my grading — MY life — kept me from feeling like I had the time to sit down and hear 
Michael, listen to him and comfort him. 
I cleared a space in my personal life for my work rather than 
clearing a space in my work life for myself and my loved ones. We 
must choose to make time to take care of each other, and defend those choices to those around us. This will be one of my life’s great-est regrets; it contradicts the commitment to human connection and love that drives my work as an anthropologist and as a teacher at this university.
I cannot apologize to Michael. I cannot do anything to make this 
better. I will dedicate myself to the service of our community in his honor, but I’ll never again get to enjoy his laugh or hear his ideas. 
The last thing Michael said to me when I apologized for being 
out of town was, “It’s not your fault.” This last text is the greatest gift he could have given me as a friend. I do not think what hap-pened to Michael was my fault, but I do think it’s my fault for not living my belief in connection and for taking “a day off” from my values rather than from work. Those of us who, like Michael and like myself, have felt so much pain that this life seems impossible 
know never to underestimate the power of an affectionate pres-
ence in times of grief or fear.
Michael Edmonds Jr. isn’t just some guy who took his life — 
a meme, a sound-clip on the news, a “did you hear?” story . He should be remembered for many other things: an advocate for those suffering through mental illness and physical pain, a pas-sionate cyclist, a comedian, a budding journalist, a humble and de-pendable friend and an active and loving member of his family. 
I want to argue here that we remember him also as a reminder 
of the importance of human connection, affection and affirmation. 
May his memory convince us all to be there when someone tells 
us he or she needs our help.

Students: Take time to 
be there for your friendsGuest column
This year, some Japanese researchers applied 
their marvelous engineering talents to one of the most abominable creations in modern his-
tory: the SpeechJammer.
The SpeechJammer is essentially a gun that, 
when aimed at a speaking person’s mouth, prevents them from talking mid-sentence. 
Go ahead and search YouTube for it — a video 
demonstrating it has gone viral. 
If the video does not invoke rage, then you’re not 
taking the First Amendment seriously enough.
When I first read about this “thing” last month, I 
expected a firestorm of political controversy. It was not forthcoming. 
The invention was mainly covered by technol-
ogy blogs and the science section of newspapers. 
Where were The New Republic and The New 
York Times with cover stories on the dangers such a device poses to freedom of speech?
 I fear that this device, relatively under the radar 
now, will have disastrous results for democracy.
The inventors of this gun have been very coy 
about its application, suggesting that it could be used in libraries or other such nonsense. 
There is something much more sinister at work 
here. 
Imagine the market for such a machine.Despotic regimes could order the thing in droves 
once it left the prototype stage, not to mention pri-vate citizens. 
The researchers involved with this device are not 
stupid — they know exactly who the buyers of the SpeechJammer will be. 
In a just world, they would be called to an inter -
national court to explain themselves.
Over and over, the modern age has presented 
technological hurdles to overcome. 
We no longer have to fight battles only with 
other human beings. Now we must also do so with technology.
Think for a moment about the effects of a Speech-
Jammer in one of the wings of the U.S. Capitol. 
Sure, the reason to have it would be something 
mundane, such as to keep long-winded congress-men from exceeding their allotted time to speak. 
Yet in an instant, it could be turned to malicious 
uses by a government intent on quelling dissent.Imagine the dangers if 
it were used in private, as well.
Do we truly want people 
roaming the streets with the ability to impinge upon others’ freedom of speech with the click of a button? 
Again, it would start 
out as mundane. 
Perhaps it would be used by pranksters to inter -
rupt a stranger’s cellphone conversation.
But this device works by sending radio signals 
directly into someone’s consciousness. 
That is nothing short of cognitive rape.
Americans should not expect other countries to 
fight against this devilish machine. 
No other nation values freedom of speech as 
highly as we do. 
While other countries have laws against “hate 
speech” and other such legislative claptrap, we in 
the United States believe that speech is always le-gal, no matter how insensitive or unwelcome it may be. 
Congress should immediately move to outlaw 
this device and any additional renditions of it.
If there is no public outcry, then we deserve our 
fate. 
The battle for freedom is never won; people must 
constantly fight for it. 
That may sound revolutionary for a stodgy con-
servative such as myself, but those on both the po-litical right and left can agree that dissent should 
never be silenced. 
We may disagree on how dissent should be ex-
pressed and by what mechanism — for example, whether Occupy protestors should be allowed to 
infringe on public property indefinitely — but one thing should never be questioned: The act of speech itself is invaluable and should be protected by ev-
ery possible measure. 
These Japanese researchers should hang their 
heads in collective shame, for they have introduced a potential menace to the free world.

Services, Tuesday afternoon. Soon some of the cats will be moving to a new adoption facility in the lobby.

Furry felines will be lounging in 
luxury in their new adoption facility 
at Alachua County Animal Services, thanks to some help from UF.
Animal Services will open a new 
adoption facility this week within its current building.
The facility will include colony-
style housing for cats rather than individual cages.
The new housing includes cages 
with several rooms that are con-nected through circular portals, al-lowing the felines to move between 
the spaces to socialize.
The new facility was designed 
with help from UF’s College of Vet-
erinary Medicine.
Veterinary faculty and students 
advised county animal services staff  on what features would be best when housing the felines.
Funding for the project came 
from donations from individu-als and organizations to Alachua County Animal Services.
V ernon Sawyer, acting director 
for the animal organization, said the new facility will give cats more room to live and play. He said this is important because cats are prone to upper-respiratory problems and infections when they’re stressed.
“This new facility will give the 
cats a bigger living area and a place to play , exercise and socialize,” Sawyer said. “We think it will keep them healthier and happier.”
Sawyer said three to four cats 
will be housed together at a time, and the new areas will include cat trees and other toys for the animals.
The project has been in the plan-
ning stages for about five years, he said, but it had been stalled nu-merous times due to budget con-straints.
He credits the project’s much-
awaited completion to UF’s assis-tance.
Sawyer said UF veterinary stu-
dents come weekly to examine and treat animals.
Gwen Jones, administrative co-
ordinator for ACAS, said the orga-
nization encourages anyone with a 
love for animals to volunteer.

es plans to have a “Cinco de Meow” open house from 1 p.m. to 4 p.m. May 5 at 3400 NE 53rd Ave. to cel-ebrate the new adoption facility.Alachua County Animal Services to open new adoption facilityLocALADRIANNA PAIDAS

Gainesville Police Depart-
ment wants to keep a stricter 
lookout for people who don’t 
wear seat belts at night.
Because people are statistical-
ly less likely to wear seat belts at 
night, GPD is asking the Florida 
Department of Transportation’s 
Safety Office for a $37,800 grant to fund a nighttime seat belt enforcement program, said Sgt. Joe Raulerson of the GPD Traffic 
Operations Division.
The money will be used to 
pay officers overtime to patrol 
areas such as Archer Road and West University Avenue for those who are not wearing their seat belts early in the evening 
and late into the night. The over -
time officers will patrol for seat 
belt violations at least one night a week, Raulerson said.
“We just want to have some 
extra eyes out there,” he said.GPD plans to submit the 
grant request after city staff re-view the application.
The Florida Department of 
Transportation reviews grants in the summer. GPD will not know if the grant money is ap-proved until fall at the earliest.
In Alachua County, a driver 
is fined $104 if the driver or the person in the passenger’s seat isn’t wearing a seat belt. In 2011, GPD wrote 1,748 tickets for seat 
belt violations.
Raulerson said there was no 
spike in seat belt violations or 
car crash fatalities that prompt-
ed him to apply for the grant. 
Instead, he got the idea during a conference a few months ago.“For our size, the number of 
traffic accident fatalities is low,” Raulerson said. “But one is still too many, so we need to do ev-erything we can to decrease them.”
Last year, there were seven 
traffic fatalities in Gainesville, according to GPD. 
Raulerson said wearing a seat 
belt was the biggest factor in whether a person lived through those crashes.
University police strongly 
enforce the seat belt law on cam-
pus, said Sgt. Kristy Maculan of 
UPD.
Maculan said UPD encoun-
ters a lot of students who don’t 
want to wear seat belts because 
the strap is uncomfortable or be-cause they think it is not needed for short distances across cam-pus.
“Statistically, people get into 
accidents in areas where they feel more comfortable,” Macu-lan said. “Distance doesn’t mat-
ter. It should be habitual.”

The Gainesville community 
will get the chance to relax in the 
sun while listening to the sounds of Rooney and Mac Miller on Sat-urday at UF’s first Swampfest.
Swampfest is a festival that 
brings together national music acts and local bands,  said  Stu-dent Government Productions chairman Jeff Schnier. The event will also feature local artwork, food and bounce houses.
Swampfest will start at 4 p.m. 
on Flavet Field. The event is free 
and open to the public.
Headlining Swampfest is na-
tional hip-hop recording artist 
Mac Miller, an artist the UF Stu-dent Body has expressed great interest in, Schnier said.Rooney, RAC and Tokyo Po-
lice Club will also perform along with local bands Twylight Zone and The Hush.
The festival is sponsored by 
SGP , UF VISA and the Reitz Union Board Entertainment.  
Kelly Richard, a 21-year-
old journalism senior and RUB bands committee co-director, said RUB was excited about get-ting involved when SGP had the idea for Swampfest.
“It’s a great opportunity to 
bring live music to school,” Rich-ard said, “especially at the end of the year for a last celebration.”
SGP has hosted numerous 
concerts throughout the years, but Swampfest is different, Schnier said.
“I think the combination of 
the number of artists, the qual-ity of artists and the fact that it’s free is something that we haven’t normally had,” he said. Swampfest to host

Five of students’ six demands remain unaddressed by faculty
The sit-in was technically a “study-in” for students in-
volved. They came prepared with laptops, textbooks and 
power strips.
Halan said the proposal was not changed during the meet-
ing.
Glover explained to the students that their demand of a 
June 15 deadline is not feasible because the fiscal year begins July 1. To get them approved, Glover must have all proposals by May 7, Halan said.
Glover told the students he had seen Abernathy’s plan and 
supports it, said Nuri Yeralan, a 28-year-old Ph.D. student. Although the students argued that the Legislature states these budget cuts are one-time, Glover said UF President Bernie 
Machen has interpreted that they are recurring.
The students also suggested involving a third party to 
evaluate the proposals, Yeralan said.
UF spokeswoman Janine Sikes said the meeting resulted 
in productive dialogue between the students and administra-
tion.“The students were going to be there outside the dean’s 
office, so it made perfect sense to sit down with a few of them and hear what their concerns are,” she said.
The only demand proposed by the students at Thursday’s 
Faculty Senate meeting that administrators met was the dead-
line extension. The other five, which include improved trans-
parency and a majority of faculty vote, still stand.
“We think we are in a better position than when we en-
tered into the meeting, but we definitely have not made sig-nificant progress,” Halan said. “We feel better.”

  Florida junior Brian Johnson hits a three-run home run during the ﬁ  rst inning of Tuesday’s win against Georgia Southern. Johnson tied a career high with ﬁ  ve RBI in the win. 
  Florida appears to ﬁ  nally be back 
on the right track.
  After a rough 11-game 
stretch that saw the No. 5 Gators go 5-6 and drop from their perch atop the college baseball rankings, things 
are ﬁ  nally clicking again, and it’s be-
cause Florida’s triumvirate of juniors — Nolan Fontana, Mike Zunino and Brian Johnson — are getting back to their usual ways.
  Earlier this season coach Kevin 
O’Sullivan said his team goes as those guys go. And right now, the going is good. Actually, it’s better than good — just look at how the trio fared in Tues-
day’s 8-2 win 
against Geor-gia Southern.

  When Michael R. Edmonds Jr. took his own life by jumping from Ben Hill Grifﬁ  n Stadium’s upper level 
Sunday night, the meaning of the location was permanently changed.
  For so long, the stadium had a simple, 
yet strangely important, meaning to me. 
  On one hand, it was a place where stu-
dent-athletes gathered to play relatively in-signiﬁ  cant football games. 
  On the other hand, Ben Hill Grifﬁ  n was 
paramount. It was the place where gladia-
tors battled for supremacy, driving a multi-
million dollar industry in front of thou-sands of fans pushed to the edge of riots by the outcome. 
  But for that to happen right there, for 
Michael to leap from the same heights I rapidly descend in the closing seconds of every home foot-
ball game, it makes 
me question my ca-reer choice. 
  Why do sports re-
ally matter, and why am I covering what 
I’m covering? 
  The one thing that sticks out to me, that 
keeps me on the career path I’m on, is how 
sports can act as a channel or a source of 
hope for all people, especially those in dis-tress.

SOUTHERN 8-2 ON TUESDAY.
  BRYAN HOLT
 Alligator Writer
   
 After carrying Florida to a series win 
at Tennessee during the weekend, Bri-
an Johnson took a curtain call Tuesday 
night. 
  Stepping in with two outs in the ﬁ  rst 
inning, Johnson launched a three-run 
homer off the right-ﬁ  eld video board and 
went on to tie a career mark with ﬁ  ve RBI. 
In his last four games, he is now 8 for 16 with 11 RBI and two home runs. 
  “I just feel a lot more comfortable,” 
Johnson said. “Early in the season I was 
probably just fouling that (home-run pitch) 
off and digging myself in a hole. Now I’m making contact with that pitch.”
  Propelled by Johnson and a lineup that 
saw eight of its nine starters get a hit, No. 5 Florida (29-8) took a routine 8-2 victory against Georgia Southern (22-17) on Tues-day night. 
  For the second time in as many games, 
the Gators jumped out to an early lead 
courtesy of Johnson. 
His ﬁ  rst-inning homer came two days 
after a bases-clearing double in Knoxville, 
Tenn. Unlike Sunday, he was not on the mound to reap the immediate beneﬁ  ts of 
the lead. 
  Senior right-hander Greg Larson got his second start of the season and his 
fourth win. 
He was told before the game by UF 
coach Kevin O’Sullivan that he would work three innings, and he did just that. 
Larson allowed four hits and one earned 
run and left after 39 pitches. 
  “I kept the ball down and all my pitch-
es were working,” Larson said. “That’s 
all I wanted to do: just go three strong in-
nings.”
  After Larson’s departure, the Gators 
continued to tack on runs — something they struggled with against the Volun-teers. Florida notched at least one run every inning from the ﬁ  fth through the eighth, highlighted by a two-run Johnson 
double in the seventh. 
  Freshman Justin Shafer singled in 
fellow freshman Taylor Gushue in the 
eighth. The Gators’ other two runs came 
when Nolan Fontana scored on a passed 
ball in the ﬁ  fth and a wild pitch plated Casey Turgeon in the sixth. 
  Florida scored all of its runs with two  Johnson continues hot streak,

THE TOM GREEN SHOW� 11 GAMES REMAIN ON REGULAR-
SEASON SCHEDULE.
JONATHAN CZUPRYN
Alligator Writer
 
Rounding the last turn, the Gators now 
have the finish line in sight. And with help 
from the veterans on the team, Florida has a 
chance to outsprint the competition.
With only 11 games left on the regular 
season schedule, junior Ensley Gammel 
and the rest of the Gators (38-5, 18-2 South-
eastern Conference) look to wrap up what’s 
left in the regular season and move onto the postseason. 
Gammel, who has been to the past two 
Women’s College World Series and SEC 
Tournaments with Florida, said she loves 
this part of the year 
and looks to help the younger players ad-
just to the pressure.
“Every postseason is always really excit-
ing and I’m really excited to see where we 
end up this year,” Gammel said. “I don’t always have to be like, ‘Let’s go!’ because 
they (the freshmen) want to win just as 
much as we do. I really think we can lead by example and experience.”
At this point last year, the Gators were 
37-7 behind five seniors who were part of the winningest class in UF softball history. Florida then went 19-4 en route to their sec-ond appearance in the WCWS Champion-
ship in three years. 
But even with only one senior in Mi-chelle Moultrie, junior Kelsey Horton said 
her team can make a deep run with help 
from the rest of the upperclassmen. 
“My role has changed a little bit this year, leading the team more vocally,” Hor -
ton said. “I just try to remember how I felt looking up to those five seniors. They were 
kind of our rock. Now I try to do the same kind of things for the younger players.”
Of course, it’s not like the freshmen and 
sophomores aren’t carrying their load for the team. In fact, the underclassmen ac-count for 58 percent of the team’s total hits and RBI and 49 percent of the home runs. The entire pitching staff, which ranks fourth 
nationally in ERA, consists of a sophomore 
and two freshmen.
“It’s definitely different, especially for 
the people who are older because they are 
such a minority on the team,” freshman 
Lauren Haeger said. “We take what [Moul-trie] says very seriously and same with Horton or even the sophomores, they are leaders on the team, too. It’s a new thing 
for all of us.”
Florida is just one of five schools in the 
country to start at least five freshmen in 
every game this season. But because the 
Gators rely so heavily on their youthful 
players, it is important for them to not crack under pressure in the home stretch and let their nerves get to them.
Horton learned that with experience.
“I guess I get a little nervous thinking 
about [the postseason],” she said. “But once 
I get in the game, I’m not nervous at all. I was more nervous watching the (Gators’

Florida junior Kelsey Horton singles against Auburn on April 15. Horton said she has 
taken on a more vocal role this year, helping underclassmen adjust. 
Moultrie, older Gators helping underclassmen in stretch run
a career-high-tying five runs, including three on a first-
inning home run.
But Tuesday’s results are just the tip of the iceberg.
In Sunday’s win against Tennessee, Fontana returned 
to the leadoff role for the first time in just more than two 
weeks after struggles at the plate. The All-American short-stop was stuck in a lengthy rut, going a combined 5 for 36 
(.139) during a nine-game stretch to open Southeastern 
Conference play. As his batting average dropped down to .274, Fontana dropped in the order.
Fontana responded with an 18-for-40 (.450) tear that 
has not only boosted his average up to .326, but propelled 
him back to the top of the Gators’ order.During Fontana’s time lower in the lineup, the Gators 
went just 4-5, but O’Sullivan said the initial shakeup 
was necessary to get Fontana in the right spot mentally. 
O’Sullivan believed the soon-to-be first-round pick wasn’t 
seeing the pitches he should have been taking advantage of. 
However, that has changed during Fontana’s surge. 
He is working the count against pitchers and then mak-
ing them pay when they give him what he is looking for, 
driving in eight runs during the stretch and reaching base at a .542 clip.
Similarly, things have started to click all around for 
Johnson. After turning in one of his best performances on the mound this season in Sunday’s win — six scoreless innings against the Vols — and pounding Tennessee from the batter’s box en route to his first career Southeastern Conference Player of the Week honor, Johnson kept at it Tuesday. The Gators’ two-way star is now 10 for his last 21 with 12 RBI and three home runs, a stretch he said Tues-
day was the most comfortable and confident he has felt at 
the plate since his freshman season.
Zunino, meanwhile, is continuing to prove why some 
believe he could go No. 1 overall in June’s MLB Draft. He’s hitting a team-leading .346 this season with 10 hom-
ers and 39 RBI, both of which are also team highs. The SEC 
offices might as well go ahead and engrave his name on the SEC Player of the Year trophy for the second straight year and save some time.
When all three of these guys are rolling at the plate, 
it’s nearly impossible to derail Florida, and that’s a scary thought as the season approaches its final leg.

Florida coach Kevin O’Sullivan approaches the mound for a meeting with catcher Mike Zunino 
(3) and pitcher Daniel Gibson. Six UF pitchers combined to not allow a walk in the 8-2 win.
Whitson makes rare relief 
appearance in eighth inning
outs and only struck out twice.
“Obviously we’ve got a long way 
to go with the season only being half 
over, but I am pleased with how we 
played,” O’Sullivan said. “Really pleased.”
Sophomore right-hander Karsten 
Whitson made his first career relief appearance with Florida leading 7-1 in the eighth inning. O’Sullivan talked with Whitson earlier in the day and said, “He just quite hasn’t been him-
self.” 
Whitson was in command during 
one inning of work and needed only 
eight pitches to get the ball to Austin Maddox for the ninth. 
“He needed that,” Johnson said. 
“He got some confidence there and that’s all he needed.”
Maddox gave up a leadoff hit that turned into the Eagles’ second run of the night before ending the game in a seven-pitch ninth. 
The revenge factor might not have 
been in full effect, but O’Sullivan 
made sure his players remembered 
what happened the last time Georgia Southern was in Gainesville. 
The Eagles beat 
the Gators 7-0 on March 8 last season.
“The coaches put 
the box score up from last year in the locker 
room as a little bit of 
motivation,” Larson 
said. “We’ve moved 
on.”

MIAMI (AP) — Ozzie Guillen 
emerged from the clubhouse tunnel 
three hours before game time Tues-
day, saw the horde of media waiting 
for him in the dugout and uttered an expletive in surprise.
He’s back.
Returning from a five-game sus-
pension imposed after he praised Fi-
del Castro, Guillen rejoined the team for Tuesday night’s game against the Chicago Cubs, a game Miami 
won 5-2.
“I feel great,” said Guillen, seat-
ed in the dugout and facing about 
50 reporters and cameramen three 
hours before the first pitch. “It’s nice 
to come back and do what I love to do.”
The talkative, opinionated, pro-
fane Guillen said he won’t change 
— but then added he’ll steer clear 
of certain subjects from now on. He also said he’ll be more careful about what he says around people he 
doesn’t know well.
“Obviously talking about some 
issues is not my business,” he said. 
“My business is to talk about base-ball. ... I learned a very tough lesson. 
You learn from mistakes. I hope this 
mistake makes me a better person.”
No demonstrations were evident 
at the ballpark Tuesday , and there 
was no reaction when Guillen took 
his seat at the dugout railing just be-fore the game.
The V enezuelan’s comments about Castro in a magazine inter -
view angered Cuban Americans, who make up a large segment of the 
Marlins’ fan base. He apologized 
repeatedly during an extraordi-nary news conference a week ago, then began the suspension only 
five games into his tenure with the 
team.
Contrite but upbeat, Guillen said 
he spent his idle week at home in Miami and watched Marlins games 
on TV , which he found weird. He 
said he visited with Cuban exiles and was moved by the stories they told.
“The most difficult thing was 
looking directly in their eyes,” Guil-len said in Spanish. “One gentleman spent 26 years in prison. Tears came out. I asked for their forgiveness. I 
still feel bad because I injured many 
persons.”
He said he hopes to repair dam-
age done by winning games and be-ing active in community outreach.
“Obviously people are still a little 
bit upset,” he said. “I don’t blame them a bit, but I feel a lot of people supporting me. No matter what I do, 
it’s not going to be enough — there 
are some people out there who are going to feel the way they’re going to feel.”When asked about the possibility 
he’ll be booed by Marlins fans, he shrugged.
“I can’t control that,” he said. 
“If they’re going to boo, I’ve been booed before — in way different situations. This one maybe hurts a 
little bit more or makes me a little bit 
more embarrassed, maybe.”
Guillen met with his players be-
fore the game with the message of getting back to business. First base-
man Gaby Sanchez, whose parents 
are Cuban exiles, said the situation has been difficult but the team is glad to have Guillen back.
“Everybody knows how he is as 
a person and what he actual means and feels, so everybody supports him,” Sanchez said.
Closer Heath Bell agreed, and 
said the team can help Guillen by playing well.
“We knew where his heart is,” 
Bell said. “He messed up. He’s go-
ing to make up for it. All we can do 
is support him by trying to win for him, and don’t let the off-the-field distractions distract us on the field.”
Last week a group of about 100 
Cuban Americans protested outside the ballpark during Guillen’s news conference, demanding that he be fired. Guillen said he never wor -
ried about that happening and was pleased to receive support from the organization, even if team officials were unhappy about the situation.
When asked if he considered his 
return from suspension a fresh start, he said no.
“I put myself on probation about 
growing up and being better and don’t trust too many people,” he said. “That was my problem. ... I was 
hurt, and I hurt a lot of people.”�  FIBA AMERICAS U18 CHAMPIONSHIP 
WILL BE HELD JUNE 16-20 IN BRAZIL

Florida coach Billy Donovan has found a 
summer job.
On Tuesday, Donovan was named head coach 
of the U.S. men’s junior national basketball team 
for the 2012  FIBA Americas  U18 Champion-ship, held from June 16-20 in Sao Sebastiao do Paraiso, Brazil.
Joining Donovan, the USA Basketball Men’s 
Junior National Team Committee — chaired by Syracuse coach Jim Boeheim — selected Gonza-ga’s Mark Few and VCU coach Shaka Smart as assistant coaches on the U.S. team’s staff. 
Smart worked under Donovan as an assistant 
coach at UF from 2008-2009. 
“It’s always an honor to be selected to repre-
sent your country, and I’m incredibly thankful for this opportunity to be a part of USA Basket-ball,” Donovan said in a statement. “I have great respect for Shaka Smart and Mark Few, and I’m 
looking forward to working alongside them.”
Donovan will open training camp on June 5 
at the U.S. Olympic Training Center in Colorado 
Springs, Colo., to the approximately 25-30 in-coming college freshmen and rising high school 
seniors trying out for a roster spot on the team. 
Only players born on or after Jan. 1, 1994 are eli-gible. After three or four days, Donovan will make 
cuts and name his finalists for the team, which ultimately has to be trimmed to 12 players by the time they leave for Brazil.
This is the second consecutive year Donovan 
has worked with USA Basketball following a stint last June as a court coach for the 2011 U19 World Championship Team. 
That squad featured current Gators center 
Patric Young and went on to finish fifth in the tournament.  
“Coach Donovan has been one of the premier 
coaches in college basketball over the past 15 
years. He’s won at the highest level of college 
basketball, and I’m sure that 
experience will translate well to the USA Basketball Men’s U18 National Team,” Boe-
heim said. “The USA Men’s 
U18 Team is going to benefit from having some of brightest 
teachers in college basketball 
guiding them.”
The USA is the reigning champion from the 
2010 U18 FIBA Americas Championship, which 
also  had Young in its lineup. 
Donovan’s squad will compete against seven 
other teams in the 2012 U18 zone qualifier, in-
cluding Argentina, Brazil, Canada, Columbia, 
Mexico, Puerto Rico and U.S. Virgin Islands. The top four finishers in the tournament will also qualify for next summer’s 2013 FIBA U19 World Championship.

Florida freshman midfielder Nicole Graziano checks Vanderbilt’s Brandi Byner dur -
ing Saturday’s 17-5 win against the Commodores. 
JOSH JURNOVOY

 The Gators’ offense has gotten quite a 
bit of attention.
The unit ranks second nationally in goals 
per game with 17.25, and Florida is one 
of two teams in the country to have four 50-point scorers.
What has been equally as impressive this 
season, but has not received as much atten-tion without the gaudy statistics of the at-tack, is the play of the UF defense.
“Often times defenses go under the ra-
dar,” coach Amanda O’Leary said.
Florida put together one of its most im-
pressive defensive showings of the season in a 17-5 win at Vanderbilt on Saturday.
“Containing their (Vanderbilt’s) offense 
was something we were worried about,” O’Leary said. “We had not done a very good job in the past couple of games of contain-ing 1 v. 1 opportunities for our opponents… I thought they came out and executed the 
game plan very well defensively.”
The Commodores’ 13 shots were the few-
est the Gators have ever surrendered to an 
American Lacrosse Conference opponent, 
with the previous low being 19 in an 8-7 
win at Vanderbilt last season.
Florida lowered its goals-against aver -
age to 6.63 and moved into sole possession of first place in the country in scoring de-
fense after Saturday’s win.
The team results have been strong for 
Florida despite the fact it does not have a 
player ranked in the top 50 in the country 
in either ground balls or caused turnovers. 
O’Leary cited the continuity of the defense a reason for its strong play. 
“They have played together now for two-
and-a-half, almost three years,” O’Leary 
said. “They are getting to know each other. The communication has gotten better.”
Whereas the attack lost senior Caroline 
Cochran to a torn ACL in her left knee ear -
lier this season and the midfield lost junior 
Janine Hillier to transfer in the offseason, the core of the defense has remained intact 
since 2010. Juniors Kayla Stolins, Sam Far -
rell, Haydon Judge, Jamie Reeg and Emily 
Dohony have all been mainstays in Flor -
ida’s defensive backfield since the team’s inaugural season.
The depth of the unit has been strength-
ened as well with the addition of freshman Sally Jentis. She has seen action in 14 of the 
Gators’ 16 games this season, collecting 11 
ground balls and causing six turnovers.
Her most impressive moment this season 
came when she was subbed in for an injured Dohony in the second half of Florida’s 13-12 
win against Johns Hopkins on April 7. The 
Blue Jays won the opening draw of the sec-ond overtime, but Jentis forced a turnover 18 seconds later, and the Gators scored the 
winning goal on the ensuing possession. 
“She’s certainly somebody we can put in 
there at any point in time,” O’Leary said. 
“She certainly walks in there and is flaw-less.”
With a showdown at top-ranked unde-
feated Northwestern looming Saturday, O’Leary was glad to see her team stifle Van-derbilt.
“I’m really just excited with our defense,” 
O’Leary said. “I thought it was good for our 
defense to be challenged in the last couple 
of games. They came out on Saturday and put it all together.”Florida’s defense draws praise with Northwestern match looming
wrote in the obituary that ran in our paper on Monday, Michael was a member of Team Florida Cycling who was often at his happiest when riding. Friends used to laugh at 
the Gators-themed rants he would post to his Facebook.
About six or eight months back, a friend of mine basi-
cally asked me why I was wasting my time writing sports. 
There are so many other things to be worried about: the 
national debt, capitalism, healthcare, human rights, so on 
and so forth. 
In his eyes, I was providing the circus end of the “bread 
and circus” that government was using to keep society appeased while atrocities went unchecked. 
But being a sportswriter isn’t a vote for ignorance, and 
it’s not a message that keeping up with news and politics is unimportant. 
It’s a chance to highlight all the good things in sports, 
from inspirational underdog stories to everything a man 
like Jackie Robinson did for racial equality. It’s about a 
father and son sharing a moment at the ballpark, and all those who need an escape. 
What we’re aiming to do is provide an avenue for 
people with problems to forget about them for just a few 
minutes, to find a beacon of hope in a world filled with 
trouble. 
But, for some, that won’t be enough. For Michael, a back injury suffered in a biking accident 
left him in a brace and unable to ride, cutting off his sport-ing outlet and adding to an array of issues that included bipolar disorder. 
“I never knew it was possible to miss something this 
bad,” he posted to his Twitter account. “...can we rewind life and restore my back? I NEED to ride a bike.”
Even though Michael was starting to come around — 
he had bought a new bike and gotten medical clearance 
to ride in the past few weeks, according to the Florida 
Times-Union — the events of Sunday passed as they did. 
Those in distress need to know they can fall back on 
friends, family and loved ones in their time of need. When that’s not enough, that support system can extend to UF’s 
Counseling & Wellness Center, which is available any 
time at 352-392-1575. 
While nothing we cover in Ben Hill Griffin Stadium 
this year will be nearly as significant as what happened 
just outside its walls on Sunday, my only hope is that our 
work at alligatorSports puts a smile on at least a few peo-ple’s faces, and that those who need to will know where to go for help if they need it.
