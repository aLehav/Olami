Tuesday morning’s raging 
thunderstorm brought along with 
it ﬂ  ooding, power outages and two 
fatal accidents — one involving an 
airplane.
At about 9 a.m., in the midst of 
heavy rain and wind, ofﬁ  cials with 
the Marion County Sheriff’s Of-
ﬁ  ce found a pilot dead in a small 
airplane crash near Micanopy, ac-
cording to a press release.
The pilot, Riley Stevens, 64, of 
Anderson, South Carolina, was the 
plane’s sole occupant.
Stevens was ﬂ  ying from Se-
bring, Florida, to South Carolina 
when the crash happened, accord-
ing to the press release. 
Ofﬁ  cials from the Federal Avia-
tion Administration and National 
Transportation Safety Board are in-
vestigating the crash.
MCSO said ofﬁ  cials are unsure if 
the storm was a factor in the crash, 
although it happened during severe 
weather.
About four hours later, once the storm had passed, an Alachua 
man crashed his SUV into a tree off 
Northwest 13th Street after losing 
control on the roadway.
The vehicle ﬂ  ipped, ejecting 
55-year-old Theodore Williard Rob-
erts and killing him, Gainesville 
Police spokesperson Ofﬁ  cer Ben 
Tobias wrote in an email. 
The vehicle wound up on its 
roof.
GPD closed a portion of the 
road while ofﬁ  cers investigated the 
crash.
Amid 30 mph winds, about 
1,800 Gainesville Regional Utili-
ties customers lost power in their 
homes at about 8 a.m., said senior 
communication specialist Tiffany 
Small.

A Gainesville Police ofﬁ  cer has been sus-
pended with pay and faces criminal charges 
of aggravated assault, stalking, false imprison-
ment and battery.
Ofﬁ  cer Patrick Hopkins is accused of bat-
tering his girlfriend, pointing a gun at her and 
stalking her after they broke up, according 
to sworn complaints submitted by Alachua County Sheriff’s Ofﬁ  ce. The 
ﬁ  rst incident recorded in 
the court records took place 
Dec. 3, 2016.
Hopkins’ ex-girlfriend 
told ACSO the couple had 
an argument that night, 
which escalated later after 
Hopkins drank alcohol, ac-
cording to the complaint. In fear for her safety, 
she went to her closet to pack a bag and leave.
Hopkins came into the closet and argued 
with her, according to the afﬁ  davit. When she tried to walk past him, he pushed her to the 
ﬂ o o r  a n d  p o i n t e d  h i s  d e p a r t m e n t - i s s u e d  h a n d -
gun at her, according to the complaint. She 
didn’t leave the home, and when Hopkins so-
bered up, he apologized.
According to the sworn complaint, Hopkins 
was threatening and emotional when his girl-
friend tried to break up with him following the 
incident.
“Ruining your life and reputation just be-
came my number-one goal,” he wrote, accord-
ing to the afﬁ  davit.
Hopkins was suspended with pay Feb. 21, GPD spokesperson Ofﬁ  cer Ben Tobias said. 
GPD Internal Affairs Division will run a sepa-
rate investigation from the criminal investiga-
tion conducted by ACSO, Tobias said.
Hopkins was hired in April of 2013 and was 
assigned to the K-9 Unit. 
He was given a medal of heroism by Gov-
ernor Rick Scott in January 2016 for saving a 
Gainesville woman from her burning home, 
according to Alligator archives.

Although the doors of the 
O’Connell Center opened at 7:15 
p.m. on Tuesday, Lil Wayne didn’t 
take to the stage until 11:26 p.m., to 
a mix of shouts and boos. When the lights for the concert 
went out at about 8:22 p.m., pockets 
of empty seats were still visible. 
Once the two opening acts, 
BAS and CyHi the Prynce, ﬁ  nished 
around 10 p.m., the crowd had 
steadily increased, only to have to 
wait another hour and a half for the headlining rapper to perform. 
Lil Wayne, whose real name 
is Dwayne Carter Jr., was paid 
$125,000 to perform, according to 
Alligator archives. About 3,000 peo-
ple attended the concert, which was 
sponsored by Student Government 
Productions and the O’Connell Cen-ter, estimated Dillon Knox, chairper-
son of SGP.  
Lil Wayne opened the show to 
the song “Mr. Carter,” wearing a 
black hoodie and bandana, while the 
crowd booed and wooed.
At the beginning of the show, Lil 
Wayne didn’t mention why he was 
late, instead praising God.
“We all ain’t s--- without the man 
above,” he said, opening his perfor-mance among a sea of colorful lights 
on stage.
Following the performance, the 
O’Connell later posted on its Face-
book page that the rapper’s plane 
had been grounded in Atlanta due to 
high winds.
Karan Sharma, a UF computer 
science senior, left the concert while 
Lil Wayne was still performing at Students frustrated after Lil Wayne hour late to concert Hopkins

A Doorway to the Divine: 
Islamic Bodies and the Sufi Saints as Connecting the Living to the DeadA historian of the Islamic world, France and medicine from McMaster University will give a free public lecture Thursday at 5:30 p.m. in Smathers Library, 
Room 100. Ellen Amster will 
discuss the role of the bodies of saints in healing the living in precolonial Morocco. For Muslim pilgrims visiting the tombs of the saints, these holy bodies offered cures by link-ing heaven and Earth. These traditions and beliefs were 
challenged by French colonial-
ism and notions of science in the late 19th century and early 20th century. This event is the seventh in an eight-part series called “Death: Confronting the Great Divide,” during which in-ternationally renowned schol-ars and filmmakers explore 
unique cultural and historical 
confrontations with death. This event is free and open to the public, and it includes time af-terward for questions and dis-cussion.

gees

the Evangelical Immigration Table, will give an update on what is going on nationally with churches to address refu-gee and immigration issues. An open discussion will fol-low. Welcoming Gainesville, InterVarsity and the Evangelical Immigration Table are sponsor-
ing the event  from 7 p.m. to 9 
p.m. on Thursday at Parkview Baptist Church, located at 3403 NW 13th Street.

The Gainesville Police Depart-
ment and City Commission are 
working together to protect resi-dents from towing practices that violate city ordinance.
After receiving complaints about 
aggressive towing practices by email, phone calls, Facebook and even Reddit, District 4 City Com-missioner Adrian Hayes-Santos said he plans on amending Gainesville’s 
towing ordinance to ensure resi-
dents are treated fairly.
Hayes-Santos said he’s received 
complaints that Ultimate Towing of Gainesville, located at 907 SW Third St., has not been accepting credit card payments, which violates Sec-tion 14.5-30 of the Gainesville City Ordinance. The ordinance states 
that businesses with a permit for 
trespass towing must accept pay-ments in “cash; major credit card; and/or debit card.”“They need to accept credit cards 
— not everyone has cash. I don’t have cash,” Hayes-Santos said. “It’s 
taking advantage of people, it’s a 
predatory tactic for towers.”
GPD is currently investigating 
Ultimate Towing and has informed owner Stephen O’Grady that if he does not follow the city ordinance, they will begin the process of revok-ing his business’ trespass tow ser-vice permit, GPD spokesperson Of-
ﬁ  cer Ben Tobias wrote in an email.
“Mr. O’Grady has until Wednes-
day to reply before we begin the 
process of revoking their tow ser-vice permit,” Tobias said.
O’Grady said that as of Mon-
day morning, Ultimate Towing has begun accepting credit cards once again. He added that he doesn’t be-
lieve his actions ever violated city 
ordinance since it says “and/or deb-it card” instead of just “and.”
“I work with GPD on a continu-
al basis, so I don’t see that there’s much of a story there,” O’Grady said. “I don’t believe we were ever in violation.”
Hayes-Santos said that in the 
past few years, issues regarding towing in Gainesville have ﬂ  ared up. 
In 2014, Stan Forron, the former 
owner of Ultimate Towing, was ar-rested after stealing two scooters to stage them as if they were parked illegally so that he could then tow them, according to Alligator ar-
chives.
Hayes-Santos said he’s looking 
to revise the ordinance so that other 
unfair towing practices, such as the use of spotters hired by towing com-panies, are eventually banned.
“The city needs to prohibit pred-
atory towing tactics,” Hayes-Santos said. “My goal is to have an amend-
ed ordinance that puts Gainesville 
residents ﬁ  rst by the start of the Fall semester.”

UF Student Senate approved 
revisions of codes to include two 
new executive agencies.
Senate unanimously approved 
additions and revisions in the Ad-ministrative General and Execu-tive codes. The changes included adding codes to legitimize The Big Event, a day-long community ser-vice event held for the ﬁ  rst time with UF students participating Saturday, and the Florida Student Government Institute, a Florida student government conference in June, along with minor wording 
changes. 
Judiciary chairwoman Emily 
Dempsey said it’s standard proce-
dure to add executive agencies cre-ated in the past year and codes that 
deﬁ  ne the roles of the chairs.
“It commemorates their hard 
work put forth over the school 
year,” she said. 
During the ﬁ  rst reading, Senate 
unanimously approved the 2017 to 2018 Student Government funded academics budget of $435,752, mainly for UF colleges’ council boards. Senate also approved the 2017 to 2018 SG funded organi-zational budget of $1,043,202 for various student organizations. 
If approved again during next 
Tuesday’s meeting, the budget’s ﬁ  scal year will start after June. 
Budget and Appropriations 
Chairman Ian Green said the bud-get committee ensures every stu-dent and academic organization 
operates effectively and efﬁ  ciently. 
“I want to condone the student 
organizations who came in with a 
ﬁ  scally sound budget,” he said.
University Police spokesper-
son Cpt. Jeff Holcomb gave his 
monthly report during the meet-
ing, discussing students not wear-ing helmets while riding scooters or motorcycles in light of a student 
in critical condition at UF Health 
Shands Hospital after a motorcycle 
accident on March 20, according to Alligator archives.
He said it’s difﬁ  cult for ofﬁ  cers 
to enforce the rule that scooter driv-
ers under 21 have to wear a helmet 
due to complicated laws that justify pulling scooter drivers over. 
“Basically, our hands are tied 
by the current law,” he said.

Gainesville Police arrested a 
married couple behind a Midtown 
bar after gunshots were heard 
Tuesday.
Berman Jose De Jesus Lozada, 
28, and Sandi Jane Henneman, 
25, were pointed out by a witness 
as being involved in a shooting behind Balls sports bar, located at  1716 W. University Ave., at about 
12:25 a.m., according to an arrest report. 
Police found three bullet cas-
ings from a 9 mm gun behind a 
dumpster at the scene, said Offi-
cer Ben Tobias, GPD spokesper-son.
While police were speaking 
with De Jesus Lozada, he read-justed his genitals and a maga-
zine containing 9 mm bullets fell 
out, police said. 
When the magazine fell, De Je-
sus Lozada stepped on it with his right foot to hide it from the of-
ficer he was talking to, according 
to the report.
He said he owned the maga-
zine but had not shot anything, 
according to the report. Police searched for a gun and 
asked to look in Henneman’s purse, according to the report.
They found five small bags of 
cocaine — weighing about 3.5 
grams — on Henneman, Tobias said.
De Jesus Lozada served six 
years in prison in Puerto Rico for robbery, Tobias said.
Police arrested De Jesus Loza-
da on a charge of concealing evi-dence and Henneman on charges of possessing a controlled sub-stance and possessing drug para-
phernalia. 
Authorities took the couple 
to Alachua County Jail. De Jesus 
Lozada remains, as of press time, 
in lieu of a $5,000 bond, and 
Henneman was released Tuesday afternoon on her own recogni-zance. 
She could not be reached for 
comment.

New rankings place eight UF 
programs in the top 10 across all global universities, with UF’s en-
tomology and nematology depart-
ment ranked first in the world.
The Center for World Univer-
sity Rankings, based out of Saudi 
Arabia, compiles rankings for top 
programs based on the amount of research published in top-tier academic journals and released their rankings Monday, said UF 
spokesperson Steve Orlando. 
Business First, a group based 
out of Buffalo, New York, ranked 
UF No. 12 in the nation among 
public universities Tuesday, ref-
erencing high test scores and se-lectivity.
Orlando said although the or-ganizations use different criteria to rank schools, he expects UF to continue scoring high in the fu-ture.
“As the university continues to 
rise in stature and preeminence, we are hopeful you will see these kinds of rankings,” Orlando said.
In the Business First results, 
the University of Michigan ranked No. 1, and Florida State Univer-
sity — the only other Florida uni-
versity ranked — placed No. 29, according to the organization’s website.
Blair Siegfried, the chairperson of UF’s entomology and nematol-ogy department, said the depart-ment succeeds because of strong graduate students and faculty. 
“The quality and recognition 
of our research is really a mat-ter of us being able to work with graduate students and train good students that go on to be success-
ful,” he said.
Siegfried said the department 
has been working in vital areas 
like mosquito control and pro-
tecting biodiversity, which helped 
them to be noticed.
“We do a lot of good things, 
and it’s nice to be recognized,” he said.

More than 300 graduate students 
waited in line for massages, henna 
tattoos and a yoga class for UF’s 
second annual Graduate Student 
Appreciation Week.
The wellness event, hosted by 
UF’s Graduate School, was inspired 
by a focus group of 10 graduate stu-dents, said Erin Rice, an event or-
ganizer. She said the event was to 
share campus resources with gradu-ate students, who may assume the 
resources are only for undergradu-ates.
“We want to make sure our 
graduate students know they have these resources here on campus to 
help them if they’re feeling anx-
ious,” she said.The event had several vendors 
from wellness groups at UF and in 
Gainesville, including the Counsel-ing & Wellness Center, who spon-
sored the event.  
Tessa Wimberly, a CWC psy-
chology intern, said graduate stu-
dents can experience a high level 
of anxiety and depression, and it’s 
important for UF to have resources 
for them.“I think it’s kind of a stigma-
breaking thing, to talk about men-tal health and how a lot of graduate 
students are struggling with mental 
health,” she said.
Miguel Rodriguez, a 29-year-old 
UF computer science doctoral stu-
dent, wandered between the color-ing table and massage line wearing a “UF Graduate Students Rock” pin. 
He said he feels valued by the uni-
versity because of the appreciation 
events. 
“As a grad student, it’s easy to 
lose track of everyday things be-
cause of the work and whatnot, so it’s important to have these spaces 
where you can refocus on yourself a 
little bit,” he said.

THEY SPOKE TO ABOUT 
100 PEOPLE IN THE REITZ 
UNION ON TUESDAY. 
By Aubrey Hoffman 
Alligator Contributing Writer 
A spiritual teacher and psychol-
ogist talked about how they came 
together to combine their studies Tuesday in the Reitz Union. 
Michael Singer, author of the 
book “The Untethered Soul,” 
and Trish Ring, psychologist and 
equine coach at Blue Star Ranch, a ranch where Ring provides her form of therapy in Cashiers, North 
Carolina, talked with about 100 
people in a Reitz Union meeting room. The two discussed how people can use spirituality to ad-dress emotional concerns. 
Singer explained how people 
can practice mindfulness to learn 
from good and bad experiences in 
their lives. 
“It’s not about how to make 
yourself feel mindful. Mindfulness 
is your natural state,” he said. 
Ring said when people com-
bine spirituality and psychologi-
cal practices, they become more rested and soothed.
“The work I have done as a 
psychologist is informed by my 
own spiritual journey, and that 
the work that I do in psychology is actually a portal to my own spiri-tual growth,” Ring said. 
Ring said while her and Singer 
have different theories, they end up with the same conclusions.
Veronica Paz, a UF internation-al studies freshman, said she read Singer’s book two weeks ago and thought it was inspiring. 
“He has helped my family 
through a lot, so I was excited to hear what he has to say,” the 18-year-old said. “I want to just 
hear what he has to say so I 
can pass it on to my family and friends.” UF graduate students relax during appreciation week

Gainesville Police arrested a man 
in connection with a burglary spree 
in Northwood Pines on Monday. 
De’Alvion Jaquis Williams, 18, 
told police he stole from more than 
12 cars in the North Gainesville neighborhood, according to an ar-
rest report. Most of the burglaries 
took place at 2 a.m. before Williams 
took a joyride in one of the cars he 
broke into, police said.
After the car went missing from 
the driveway of a home, an ofﬁ  cer 
spotted it in a nearby Wal-Mart 
parking lot, according to the report. The ofﬁ  cer watched Williams leave 
Wal-Mart and almost sit in the car’s 
driver’s seat before running at the 
sight of approaching ofﬁ  cers.
Williams was identiﬁ  ed by his 
passenger and Wal-Mart surveil-
lance footage, according to the re-
port. He was brought in for ques-
tioning and admitted to stealing the car and burglariz-
ing other cars.
He said his 
passenger, who 
is a juvenile, par-
ticipated in the 
crimes and found 
the keys to the 
car before they 
both decided to steal it, according 
to the report. It is unknown if his 
passenger was also arrested.Williams identiﬁ  ed items he 
stole from other cars including a 
Taser and spare change, police said.
Williams was arrested on charg-
es of grand theft auto, unarmed 
burglary and petty theft. He was 
taken to Alachua County Jail where 
he remains, as of press time, in lieu 
of a $35,000 bond.

Alachua County libraries are 
helping formerly incarcerated peo-
ple or anyone interested in getting 
back in the workforce gain the nec-
essary skills through several work-
shops.
The Re-Entry Conference will be held at Library Partnership, located 
at 1130 NE 16 Ave, from Monday 
to April 13. In a collaboration with 
their community partner Career-
Source North Central Florida, the 
Re-Entry Job and Resource Fair will 
be held April 24 from 10:30 a.m. to 
1:30 p.m. at Alachua County Head-
quarters Library, located at 401 E. 
University Ave. After working in libraries for 
more than 16 years, Linda Cue, 
Alachua County Library District 
librarian, worked to create all-in-
one workshops to give people the 
resources they need to get back on 
their feet. 
From women who are recently 
divorced, to people who have been 
battling illnesses, Cue is hoping the event will attract people from all 
walks of life.
“We’re expecting not only people 
who have criminal backgrounds, 
but also people who have been out 
the workforce for a long time,” Cue 
said. 
Nickie Kortus, a marketing and 
public relations director for the Ala-
chua County Library District, said the events were put together with 
everyone in mind. 
“Linda wanted to get everybody 
in one location, so that they can get 
the resources they need and back on 
a good track,” Kortus said.
Registration for the event can be 
done in person at the Alachua Coun-
ty Library District or by contacting 
the library directly at 352-334-3939.  A l a c h u a  C o u n t y  l i b r a r i e s  t o  p r o v i d e  j o b - s k i l l s  w o r k s h o p s
THE OFFICIAL LAUNCH IS 
SET FOR AUGUST. 
By Jennie Mason 
Alligator Contributing Writer 
A UF alumnus’ communication 
app is now available for UF organi-
zations to try out. 
The app, Agora, is a platform 
for student group communication, 
said Steven Buchko, the app’s cre-
ator. It integrates organizational 
tools such as messaging, alerts, 
calendars and location services 
into one app to improve communi-
cation between large groups, said 
Buchko, who graduated from UF 
in 2015 with a bachelor’s degree in 
industrial and systems engineering. “The ultimate goal is simplic-
ity,” the 24-year-old said.
He said the beta version is now 
available for UF student organiza-
tions to use. The ofﬁ  cial launch is 
set for August on all iOS and An-
droid smartphones for free, but 
students can start using the current 
version now by emailing Buchko 
through Agora’s website. Once the 
app is released, there will be an un-
determined cost for premium ser-
vice features.
Buchko said he began brain-
storming ideas for the app his 
sophomore year at UF after being 
discouraged by how his fraternity, 
Zeta Beta Tau, handled organiza-
tional duties. 
“We were using an email List-
serv to handle fraternity duties,” he said. “It was disorganized and 
confusing.”
He said he chose the name Ag-
ora because it’s an ancient Greek 
term for public meeting spaces. 
Israel Ojalvo, the College of 
Liberal Arts and Sciences Student 
Council president, said he uses the 
app for event reminders and send-
ing out updates to organization 
members.
“Agora seems like the best way 
to reach all the members quickly,” 
Ojalvo said.  U F  a l u m n u s ’  a p p  a i m s  t o  i m p r o v e  c o m m u n i c a t i o n  i n  g r o u p s

Believe in something else besides yourself
I can’t count the times I’ve heard a pop icon 
or a public ﬁ  gure say, “Just believe in your-self.” A famous person is asked something along the lines of “How did you get to where you are today?” and the response is normally 
the same: “I believed in myself.” It is said so often that it has become a platitude. But why is it said? And what does it actually mean?
I have tried in my life to believe in myself, 
in my abilities and self-worth, but I have never succeeded. By success, I mean achieving the sort of self-conﬁ  dence that is a form of being comfortable in one’s own skin. I imagine this self-conﬁ  dence stretches over the self and covers over a multitude of insecurities, so that I no longer stare at myself in a mirror with silent loathing, and a fear public speaking because I am afraid of putting myself out there, fear being criticized, etc. To me, this is what we mean when we say we ought to believe in ourselves: Have faith that we are not as embarrassing, dull and imperfect as we think we are. Believe that we have something positive to offer to the world and ourselves. 
Isn’t it interesting that such a statement is frequently 
and publicly made? For it admits that the self naturally does not believe in itself, though it ought to. It reveals a sort of disposition that we struggle with and need to overcome in order to move about and operate in the world — an inclination to feel uneasy about ourselves and about who we truly are. I mentioned that I never succeeded at believing in myself, and this is why: I could never simply will myself to be at ease with myself. Something always felt off. For some reason, I felt that in believing in myself, I would be lying to myself and that I would be consciously overlooking who I was — lonely, lustful, chubby, proud — to try to convince myself that I was who I wanted to be — the opposite of all those things.
A high-school friend once told me that she 
started every morning in front of her bathroom mirror, where she would speak to herself audi-bly and say things such as: “You are beautiful, smart, funny,” or “You are worthwhile.” She suggested that I try the same thing to boost my 
self-esteem. Of course, I never adhered to her advice be-cause I was, and am, the type of insecure person who takes pleasure in wallowing, not overcoming. I think it was good that I did not take her advice, although I know her heart was in the right place. Indeed, I think our culture has a good end in sight, yet the means trouble me. I could sense it then, but I think I can see it more clearly now. If the problem is self-doubt, then how can the solution be found within the self? What good is it to tell a person who struggles to accept himself to simply accept himself? That is like telling a man with a broken leg that if he wants to have his severed bone mended, he needs to simply get up and walk. It ignores the malady and thus ignores the cor-rect treatment.
This is how I see the phrase, “Believe in yourself.” It 
is  an incorrect prescription to a serious illness. Though our culture senses that there is something wrong, and we feel something is broken within ourselves, the belief that the answer lies within the self is nonsensical. Imagine our friend with the broken leg attempting to limp through life, as if his femur were working properly. Shouldn’t he ﬁ  rst be told that his leg is broken before he can be treated?
I will explore this question next week.
Scott Stinson is a UF English sophomore. His column 
appears on Wednesdays. This is part one of a two-part 
series.Memes and Dada: 
Making sense out 
of nonsense 
The Dada art movement, which began during World War 
I, was characterized by a rejection of all previous no-tions of art. Dada artists did not want to create some-thing pretty or pay tribute to rich patrons, religious icons and classic myths. Dada’s goal was to portray 
nonsense and irrationality, as a commentary on capitalist so-ciety, the brewing war and rampant nationalism. One of the most famous works of Dada art is Marcel Duchamp’s “Foun-tain,” which is a urinal with the name “R.Mutt” signed on the side. Dada was about rejecting past artistic conventions and challenging society, and one of the ways they did that was by purposefully elevating everyday objects into nonsensical art forms. 
Let’s compare the tumultuous turn of the last century to 
our current age. In both times, there was a rapid increase in technological advancement: the turn of the 20th century went from horse-drawn carriages to the ﬁ  rst working plane; at the turn of the 21st century, we were still using clunky desktop computers with dial-up connections, and now we can access the internet from almost anywhere just by whipping out a smartphone that can ﬁ  t in our pockets. These technologies co-incide with an increased focus on consumerism, and although in the 21st century we have yet to see a global war at the scale 
of World War I, there is fevered nationalism brewing in both 
Europe and America, just as there was in the 1910s.
The people of the 1910s reacted in their art by creating 
nonsensical pieces, eschewing the pursuit of order in their tu-multuous time. If you think about it, we in the 21st century do a very similar thing. What we do is create memes.
We’re not trying to discredit the artists of today. We want 
to illustrate how during tumultuous times, humans create the nonsensical to grasp at meaning in chaos.
We must adjust for this century, of course. Nowadays, ac-
cess to images, art, and the ability to create is more spread out — as well as access to art. Unlike the 1910s, when only a privileged few could travel to gallery showings, in the 2010s, the Internet allows us to create and share content to millions of people at a time.
What we create is the nonsensical.A striking example of Dada art which resonates deeply with 
meme culture is another Duchamp piece, “L.H.O.O.Q.,” which 
is a postcard of the “Mona Lisa” with facial hair scribbled 
across it. The name of the piece, if pronounced by a native French speaker, sounds like the phrase “Elle a chaud au cul,” which roughly translates to “She has a hot a--.” This is a piece that takes a revered cultural symbol and turns it into a joke — something common in today’s meme culture, where screen-shots of iconic movies, television and even historical events (and quite profoundly, sometimes classical art) are juxtaposed with often alarming, but hilarious text.
In true Dada fashion, we take pictures of everyday objects, 
of nonsensical things like frogs on unicycles, a gorilla that made the news, and we elevate them into things that have meaning. What meaning, exactly? That’s not deﬁ  nite. One could debate the true intentions of “dat boi” and Harambe but the fact is, much like Marcel Duchamp’s “Fountain,” no one would be talking about them had we not selected them and thrust them into the spotlight. This is our way of rejecting past norms, of trying to make sense out of rapid change and chaos.

“I see it as an incorrect 
prescription to a serious illness.”WEDNESDAY, APRIL 5, 2017   ALLIGATOR   7
What makes a person good or evil? 
For many, the answer lies in in-tent and individual responsibil-ity. Today, I’m going to tell you why it has little to do with either. 
At least, not in the way you think.
Western society has had a long love affair 
with dichotomy. Choices are presented to us as “one or the other.” This is comfortable, it is easy, and it draws clear lines between right and wrong. When former President George W. Bush said “Either you are with us or you are with the terrorists,” he delib-erately created a dichotomy for Americans to declare which side was theirs and which was wrong. While most people understand that the world is not this black and white, we continue to behave as though it is.
When it comes to morality, our principle 
concern is addressing another dichotomy: Is so-and-so a good person or a bad person? Even when the issue is less clear, we tend to treat people as though they are one or the other. Odds are, someone in your circle of friends has done something you disagree with. For a while you feel what is called cognitive dissonance; the conﬂ  ict between the belief that your friend is not a good person and the behavior of continuing the friendship. After a time, you either let the incident slide, or you stop being friends. You resolve this dissonance by sorting the person into one camp or the other: bad or good; friend or not.
Our biggest concern, though, is not with 
our friends’ moral status, but with our own. “Am I a good person?,” or “What would a good person do?” This way of framing mor-al questions is a pillar of what I will call “puritanical morality.” Puritanical morality in religion is chieﬂ  y a concern for the state of one’s soul, but as a way of looking at morality it has become pervasive in West-ern culture as a concern with one’s status as “good” or “evil.” Because puritanical moral-ity derives from a belief in judgement after death, where one was believed to receive either absolute punish-ment or absolute paradise, it re-quires that morality be reduced to two opposites.
This reduction creates two 
problems for puritanical moral-ity. First, it is concerned only with the sum of our actions. If a person is mostly good, then we treat them as wholly good. This 
approach means we overlook many small evils and believe that evil actions can be outweighed by unrelated good actions (or, more strangely, by suffering as penance). We see this in ﬁ  ction constantly. At the end of “Return of the Jedi,” Darth Vader, the villain, rescues the protagonist, Luke Sky-walker, in what is meant to be a redemptive moment, and we forgive his reign of fear and violence. Of course, this action hasn’t changed the past. Vader still killed count-less innocents, and he has made amends to no one he actually harmed. Whether he was “a good person” is irrelevant: his actions and their effects remain.
This brings us to the second issue with 
puritanical morality: its concern with intent. If being a bad person means knowingly do-ing harm, then we cannot be evil if we don’t understand the harm we are doing. This is why we avoid seeing documentaries like “Food, Inc.” and “An Inconvenient Truth.” So long as we refuse to learn, we can plead ignorance. When facing judgement, we can say we are still good because we didn’t know our actions were bad.
The problem is, the harm exists whether 
you know it or not, whether you atone for it or not. Whether you are a good person is irrelevant, intent makes no difference and ignorance is no excuse. Every person read-ing this paper has the resources to make informed decisions: from libraries to the in-ternet. What you don’t have is an excuse.
David Billig is a UF linguistics masters 
student. His column appears on Wednes-days. 
When we ask questions of moral 'good' or 'bad,' we are missing the pointColumn
One of the more frustrating aspects of 
a college education is how separated the subjects are. Divided into their own depart-ments, teachers and class catalogs, each major is treated as a unique thing. But when you look at the variety of majors and sub-jects available, it becomes clear that many of them address the same kinds of issues. That is why it’s important to be interdisci-plinary, to look outside your major and see what else you can learn.
Although the typical undergraduate has 
to take a number of broad “core classes,” they might ﬁ  nd few opportunities to apply this basic material to their later studies. It is certainly vital to learn the basics of math, science and history, but most undergrads can do without much more than the intro classes. In fact, students can sometimes ful-ﬁ  ll these requirements within their own ma-jor, opting not to venture too far from what they’re used to.
Yet being interdisciplinary is more im-
portant now than it ever has been. In mod-ern universities, there is a huge variety of majors, all highly spe-cialized. Even large-scale scien-tiﬁ  c majors often have specialized sections, with biology and chemis-try departments eschewing broad teaching in favor of preparation for speciﬁ  c careers. Of all of these narrow disciplines, students have to try and learn the most they can.
This is not to disparage the 
beneﬁ  ts of specialization. Indeed, the abil-ity to focus narrowly on one problem has allowed people to study things with more clarity than perhaps ever before. But some-thing is missing in all of this. As more and more students are working on complex is-sues within their ﬁ  elds, it seems more frus-trating that they don’t often talk to each other. The higher the quality of education, the more important it is to reach out of the discipline and see what else there is to of-fer.
Amid all this specialization, many disci-plines deal with shockingly simi-lar problems. Economists and political scientists both study economic policy; anthropologists and historians both study events from the past. In scientiﬁ  c dis-ciplines, the shared foundations are even more obvious, as biol-ogy and chemistry rely on some of the same introductory mate-rial. The separate disciplines can 
potentially prevent students from working together on common problems.
Being interdisciplinary doesn’t just mean 
taking classes from different majors. It means being open to how another school of thought could change your mind. Exploring something from two different points of view can reveal things that would’ve been lost if you had just looked at it from a single van-tage. Academic disciplines tend to use their own set of methods to address a problem, a ﬁ  ne practice that can stiﬂ  e creativity if it is done too often. Being interdisciplinary means trying as many techniques as you can to resolve the issues you care about.
The most important reason to be inter-
disciplinary is that it can help you realize how connected our world really is. After studying something for almost four years, it can be easy to think that it is the only area of study that matters. Interdisciplin-ary study means looking at the big picture and realizing that there is always more to learn, especially from those that have dif-ferent backgrounds. Understanding the sheer number of people working on today’s problems can provide endless opportunities to gain new knowledge.
The next time you’re looking for a class 
to ﬁ  ll an extra spot, consider being interdis-ciplinary. Look at a major similar to yours, and see if it is addressing some of the same questions. Given the complexities of the problems that face us, the least we can do is get a second opinion.

liams ran in the Daily Utah Chronicle.

by noon, she said.
Several Regional Transit Sys-
tem bus routes were delayed and 
rerouted after a branch fell in front 
of Gainesville High School. 
RTS bus routes 8 and 29 were 
rerouted and route 10 was de-
layed, said City of Gainesville As-sistant Public Information Ofﬁ  cer Chip Skinner.  
During the peak of the storm, 
Alachua County Fire Rescue sent out a tornado warning alert at 9 a.m. after the National Weather Service noticed conditions on the 
radar that could cause tornadoes, 
Chief Larry Stewart said. 
The tornado warning was lifted 
45 minutes later, and the ﬂ  ood 
warning was in effect until 11:30 
a.m. 
Stewart warned residents 
against driving due to fallen trees 
and broken trafﬁ  c lights.
“Pay attention to what the 
weather is doing,” he said. “Stay off the road if at all possible.”
However, some students 
trekked through the heavy rain and were met with ﬂ  ooded hall-ways. 
In an email to her students, UF 
associate professor Beth Rosenson canceled class as a result of the storm. 
She warned students that 
Matherly Hall was ﬂ  ooded, and classrooms would be inaccessible 
for hours. 
Cleanup crews spent the morn-
ing draining the ground ﬂ  oor of 
Matherly, UF spokesperson Janine Sikes wrote in an email.
“We received so much rain 
this morning that the drains were unable to keep up with it,” she said. “This was an unexpectedly lengthy downpour.”
Alligator Staff writers Max 
Chesnes and Romy Ellenbogen contributed to this report.

11:50 p.m. He said he wasn’t happy about the 
rapper’s delay, and he had to leave so he could wake up for his internship Wednesday morn-ing at 9 a.m.
“The show was supposed to close around 
11, not start,” the 23-year-old said. “I think they treated us like s---.They shouldn’t have done that.”
Prior to Lil Wayne going on stage, Omar No-
ble, 21, was frustrated that there was no sign of the rapper, and the DJs were playing the same songs.
“I knew he’d be a little late, but I expected 
he’d be here at like 9 p.m.,” the UF mechanical 
engineering junior said. “It’s not ‘07 anymore. 
But I still got love for him.” 
Asharib Khan, a UF computer science soph-
omore, said he expected the concert to end around 10:30 p.m. so he didn’t ﬁ  nish a class assignment that was due at midnight. The 19-year-old had to run to Marston Science Li-brary to submit his homework. 
“It would’ve been nice if he came out ear-
lier, but it is Lil Wayne,” Khan said. “He is a big star. If it had started an hour earlier, it would’ve been way better.”

Three former Gators on MLB rosters to start season
Catcher Mike Zunino is beginning his sixth year with the Seattle Mariners, 
while reliever Darren O'Day starts his sixth year with the Baltimore Orioles. 
Starting pitcher Anthony DeSclafani is expected to join the Cincinnati Reds 
after he comes off the 10-day disabled list. Coach Amanda O'Leary and 
the Gators lacrosse team take on Marquette today at 1 p.m. Read O'Leary's pregame comments, pg. 15.By Matt Brannon

As seniors Kasey Hill and Justin Leon 
move on, the NBA draft could create even more holes in the starting lineup for the Gators basketball team. 
On Tuesday, coach Mike White said he 
expects center John Egbunu and forward Devin Robinson to declare for the NBA draft.
“I think he’ll probably test the waters 
and see what type of feedback he gets,” White said of Egbunu. “That’s probably what he ends up doing, and we’ll support him as best as we can.”
Egbunu’s season ended on Feb. 14 
when he tore his ACL at Auburn. With Egbunu looking to be evaluated by NBA teams before announcing his decision, White said the injury will only make the process tougher for the redshirt junior.
“I don’t know how 
much thorough feedback he’s gonna get,” White said. “He can’t go try out. He can’t travel. He can’t do individual workouts. He can’t do a vertical jump test, you know?”
To complicate things, Egbunu gets his 
degree this semester.
“(For Egbunu), it’s a matter of ‘Do I 
apply for grad school, or do I pursue the professional basketball thing?’” White said.
Egbunu led Florida with 6.6 rebounds 
per game in the 2016-17 season and averaged 7.8 before his season-ending injury.
The Gators will also 
likely lose their second-highest scorer in the NCAA Tournament to the draft in Robinson. White said he’d be somewhat surprised if Robinson 
returned for his senior year.
In 2016, Robinson declared and then 
withdrew his name from the NBA Draft after his sophomore season.
“With this being his second go-around 
pursuing this thing, I think that it may be difﬁ  cult for him to not follow through this year,” White said.
Robinson averaged 12.5 points 
per game during four March Madness games, including 24 points against East Tennessee State. After his performance in the tournament, White said Robinson returning would be a huge advantage for the program’s recruiting prospects.
“A big recruiting coup this spring would 
be if Devin recommitted to being a Gator,” White said.
White said Florida’s postseason run 
likely elevated professional prospects not only for Egbunu and Robinson but also players aging out of UF, like Hill, Leon and graduate transfer Canyon Barry. 
“Hopefully it (will) open up more doors, 
more opportunities for these guys that are on their way out,” White said.

Kevin O’Sullivan has never lost to 
Stetson in his 10-year tenure as Florida’s head coach.
And even though his 5-0 record against 
the Hatters looked to be in jeopardy with UF down 10-1 in the ﬁ  fth inning on Tues-
day night at McKethan Stadium, that will 
have to wait for another day. 
Streaks of lightning zigzagged across 
the Gainesville sky in the top of the ﬁ  fth 
inning, halting Florida’s midweek contest less than six outs before a full ﬁ  ve innings — the shortest a game can be ended and considered ofﬁ  cial — were played. The 
game will not be resumed and will not be 
made up, and all stats won’t count. It's 
as if the game was never played.

time this season one of Florida’s games were delayed, canceled or rescheduled Rain saves Gators from lopsided loss    BASEBALL
Patrick Pinak / Alligator Staff
Florida's matchup with Stetson on Tuesday was canceled during the ﬁ  fth inning due to lightening. Florida was trailing 10-1 when the game was called off. The game will not be rescheduled.
Last week I asked coach Jim McElwain if he thought the word adversity was overused in sports. He stuttered once, stuttered again and ﬁ  nally gave a winding response that didn’t an-swer the question and somehow brought up 
the questionable nature of participation trophies. 
I don’t blame him. 
It was an unusual question. After being inundated 
with typical leading inquiries like, “Who’s separating himself in the quarterback race?” or, “How much im-provement have you seen from the offensive line?” or, “How has (insert new coach here) reinvigorated 
(insert position group here)?” answering something 
about the nature of adversity is tough on the spot. I get that. I would’ve had a tough time, too. 
But before that question, I’d asked something 
much simpler: Is receiver Dre Massey progressing 
after tearing his ACL last season, and do you still 
plan to use him in special packages? Here’s how he responded:
“Yeah,” he said. “He and Kadarius as well.”
That’s where most of his answer to a two-part 
question about Dre Massey ended. The rest of his 
answer was largely praise for C.J. McWilliams, a Please, coach

due to inclement weather. UF 
pushed back a home bout with 
Jacksonville originally set for Feb. 22 to May 3. 
Before play stopped on Tuesday, 
the hits poured in from Stetson’s 
batters.
By the end of the third inning, 
Stetson had already amassed seven 
runs on nine hits. 
And by the time the two teams 
scattered off the field into their dugouts 1 and 1/2 innings later, those numbers sat at 10 and 14, respectively. 
The bulk of Stetson’s runs came 
in a six-run second inning. 
UF freshman Nate Brown 
served up four straight hits to start the frame, which included an 
Austin Hale two-run home run to 
net Stetson a 4-0 lead.  
Two hits and two outs later, 
Brown was pulled. In his fourth 
career start, the freshman was 
knocked around to the tune of 
six runs on six hits in 1.2 innings, striking out none in the process. 
Fellow freshman Austin Lang-
worthy then entered, surrendering 
two more hits to push the Hatters’ lead to 6-0. 
In all, Stetson tallied eight hits 
in the frame — four doubles, one homer and three singles. 
The rest of Florida’s bullpen 
didn’t fare much better. 
Nick Long and Kirby McMullen 
combined to yield three runs over 2.1 innings before the game was called. 
The Gators did fight back in the 
third, however. 
Following a Keenan Bell single 
and a Deacon Liput walk, Jonathan India roped a run-scoring double down the left field line. The rally fell short after that. 
Had the stats counted, the 14 
hits would have been the most Florida’s pitching allowed at home 
this season. UF surrendered 12 to 
LSU on March 26.

THE GATORS PLAY MARQUETTE  
AT 1 P .M. IN WISCONSIN.
By Jake Dreilinger
Sports Writer
Florida was up 2-0 over Vanderbilt on Saturday 
when attacker Mollie Stevens won the ensuing 
draw control.
After getting fouled, she raced downfield and 
saw Sydney Pirreca open in front of the goal. She passed the ball to Pirreca, who turned and shot it into the net. 
The Gators now led 3-0 thanks to two goals 12 
seconds apart.
Pirreca’s goal was part of a scoring effort that 
saw nine Gators record at least one goal in the team's dominant 16-6 win over the Commodores that helped the Gators (9-2, 3-0 Big East) stay perfect in conference play.
“(I) thought they played really well,” UF coach 
Amanda O’Leary said after the Vanderbilt game. “I think it goes to show the fact that they distributed the ball really well. They have confidence in one another.”
After three Big East games, Florida is the only 
undefeated team in the conference with the help of a potent offense.
The Gators have scored 51 goals in three 
conference games and have let up 24. Attackers Stevens and Shayna Pirreca rank No. 1 and No. 2 in the Big East in total goals with 37 and 35, respectively.
As a team, Florida ranks No. 1 in the conference in goals per game (15.82), assists per game (7), ground balls per game (23.09), shots per game (35.36) and points per game (22.82).
And out of 180 minutes of conference play, the 
Gators have only trailed for 3:28. 
While Florida’s offense has been extremely 
effective, its defense has been impressive in its own right. 
The defense has held nine of its 11 opponents 
under their season averages. Taylor Bresnahan leads all defenders with 15 caused turnovers and Caroline Fitzgerald leads with 30 ground balls.
In goal, Haley Hicklen leads the conference in 
save percentage with .485 on 98 saves and 104 goals allowed.
Due to strong play all around, Florida, like it 
has since it joined the Big East in 2015, is continu-ing to dominate.
And the Gators will look to stay atop the Big 
East when they take on Marquette (4-7, 2-1 Big East) on Wednesday.
The Golden Eagles are coming off a 20-6 win 
over Villanova and a close 17-16 overtime loss to Temple. Attacker Julianna Shearer and midfielder Grace Gabriel lead Marquette’s offense with 32 goals and 29 goals, respectively. 
“(Marquette does) a terrific job in the draw 
circle and play especially well at home,” O’Leary said in a release. “We’re looking forward to a really great challenge tomorrow.”
The game starts at 1 p.m. in Milwaukee at 
Valley Fields Dome.

cornerback who’s also coming off 
injury:
“On that note,” he said, “I think 
one of the guys who has really stood out as well has been C.J. Mc-Williams in the secondary at cor-ner. He’s been doing a really good 
job as well. Those guys that aren’t 
able to go in all of the drills.”
Then he went back to Massey: “Dre has really showed up, as 
we knew he would,” he said. “That 
was a big miss for us a year ago. 
What that guy gave us.”
Then back to McWilliams: “Just mentioning some of the 
other guys, C.J. has done an out-standing job. He’s a great, great guy that’s going to be able to help us.”
It’s become common for McEl-
wain — a man known for his sar-casm as much as his football coach-ing ability — to dodge even simple questions like that one, even if it 
seems unintentional. Another ex-
ample occurred this Monday when McElwain was asked to retell the story of his first meeting with quar-terback Kyle Trask and whether 
he’s still the same guy. 
“Yeah,” he answered. “He 
hasn’t changed a bit. The guy kept 
coming to camp and competed 
against everybody and is doing 
the same thing. You know, excited about him and what he brings and really the way he, let’s just say 
nothing bothers him. He stays very 
level and does a great job of study-ing what we’re trying to do.”
There’s a little bit of an answer 
in there as far as him being the 
same guy, but the part about their 
first meeting is mysteriously ab-sent. And this problem extends far beyond these two questions. 
Again, I’m not saying he does it 
on purpose. It just seems to be his nature. He’s a sarcastic guy, and there’s nothing wrong with that. 
I also acknowledge I’m nitpick-
ing. His job is to be a good football coach. Not to be articulate. 
But whether he dodges ques-
tions on purpose or not, the fans 
are the ones who suffer. The fans 
who want to escape into sports are the ones who don’t get quality con-tent about their team. 
And yes, it’s definitely annoying 
for me as well, but I don’t expect a newspaper reader to care about my “plight” as a sportswriter. I also suspect that Florida fans don’t care 
about his answer habits as long as 
the Gators are winning. I get that. 
However, it’s not hard to see 
how this becomes a much bigger problem when the Gators aren’t 
winning. When McElwain gives 
half-answers after a string of loss-es. Or, even worse, in the midst of a scandal. 
Perhaps it’s just better to get out 
of the habit now.COLUMN,  from pg. 13

Just like last year’s squad, the Gators 
softball team has built a 33-2 record 
through its ﬁ  rst 35 contests.
It’s one of the only things that hasn’t 
changed between the two seasons.
UF’s most glaring difference is the 
absence of ﬁ  ve key players who graduated 
in 2016 and played important roles for 
Florida’s offense.
Now in 2017, the Gators have just 
two seniors to bolster their depth in the batter’s box in Justine McLean and Chelsea Herndon. Only McLean had seen consistent 
action throughout her ﬁ  rst three years.
Due to this lack of veteran players, 
Florida has relied on new faces to replace 
the missing production. 
It turned out to be a great move for the 
Gators.
“We’re all kind of like the underdogs,” 
redshirt freshman Sophia Reynoso said. “A lot of us don’t have the big wins under our 
belt that the class last year did.”  
Last year’s senior class brought with it 
the experience of two national champion-
ships in 2014 and 2015 and tons of SEC wins to back them up.
Losing them hasn’t hurt the Gators’ 
ability to swing the bat, however.
That’s because the additions of freshmen 
Reynoso, third baseman Jaimie Hoover and catcher Jordan Roberts in the starting lineup have helped the offense explode to 
new heights.
Florida has outscored SEC opponents 
67-7 through its ﬁ  rst 11 conference games, 
as opposed to last year’s team, which held 
a margin of 46-21.  
While the team plays well on both 
sides of the ball, communication between teammates has been key to their growth as 
a unit.
“We all look to each other for advice 
and ways to get to where we need to be,” Reynoso said. “It all transfers back to the ﬁ  eld.”
Getting along with each other has never 
been an issue. Although 11 of the players are from out of state, their connections through play prior to their college careers makes communication simple.
“It’s funny, even on off days we’re al-
ways together,” sophomore Alex Voss said. “We’re comfortable with each other and have genuine happiness towards each other… . It translates on the ﬁ  eld.”
Of course, one aspect of the Gators 
hasn’t changed much, and that’s the pitching.
The trio of Kelly Barnhill, Aleshia Oca-
sio and Delanie Gourley has combined for 
31 of Florida’s 33 wins.
The UF pitching staff leads the SEC with 
a team ERA of 0.74. The second closest in 
that category is Texas A&M at 1.18.
UF also ranks second in total strikeouts 
at 323, trailing only Alabama with 350.
The Gators hope that play translates to 
their midweek non-conference game with North Florida today and into the weekend 
against Georgia.
Florida is 23-1 against non-conference 
opponents this season. And the team hasn’t 
played the Bulldogs since losing to them in 
the NCAA Super Regionals last year in a 
series that ended UF’s season. 
The Gators begin their ﬁ  ve-game home 
stand today when they face the Ospreys at Katie Seashole Pressly Stadium with ﬁ  rst 
pitch set for 6 p.m.
