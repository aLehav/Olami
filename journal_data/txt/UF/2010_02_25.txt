NOT-SO-CLEAN SWEEP
0 THE STUDENT ALLIANCE
PARTY WON 20 SENATE SEATS.
By ELIZABETH BEHRMAN
Alligator Writer
Screams from the Unite Party were
followed by chants of "No fee!" from the
Student Alliance party at the Orange &
Brew Thursday morning.
The Unite Party won a majority once
again, claiming the executive ticket and
29 of the 49 available Senate seats.
The Student Alliance party grabbed
20 Senate seats, including eight gradu-
ate seats, the architecture seat, three en-
gineering seats, the nursing seat, the fine
arts seat and six seats form the College
of Liberal Arts and Sciences.
The Unite Party presidential and vice
presidential candidates got 5,376 votes
and the Student Alliance Party received
3,921 votes.
During fall's election, the two minor-
ity parties won a total of three seats.
Supervisor of Elections Ariana Al-
fonso announced the results of the Stu-
dent Government spring elections early
Thursday morning.
About 130 members of the Unite Par-
ty and about 45 members of the Student
Alliance party anxiously awaited the re-
sults at the Orange & Brew.Alfonso said 9,775 students voted
during the election. About 9,800 stu-
dents voted in the spring 2009 election.
Ashton Charles was elected as the
new Student Body president, Marcus
Dixon was elected as Student Body vice
president and Virlany Taboada will hold
the position of Student Body treasurer.
"I'm just so honored to be able to
represent the students of the University
of Florida, and I'm just so proud to be a
Gator," Charles said.
Charles' parents were there to sup-
port her when the results were an-
nounced.
Lona Vuskovich, Charles' mom, said
her heart was going crazy.
"It was worth it all," she said. "All
the work paid off."
Ben Meyers, Unite Party spokesman,
said he was pleased Unite won a major-
ity of the seats.
"It's gonna be a great year," he said.
Although Unite gained the major-
ity of the Senate seats, members of the
Student Alliance party cheered when
Alfonso announced that 56 percent of
students voted against a fee to cover the
repair of the Reitz Union and 55 percent
voted against a fee to cover the expan-
sion of the Reitz Union.
They grouped together by the Reitz
Union amphitheatre and shouted "No

Pub to feature laser tag
By KATHERINE BEIN
Alligator Writer
The latest downtown dive is putting a
twist on childhood pastimes.
Mars Pub and Laser Tag, located at 239
W University Ave., where Wise's Pharmacy
used to be, opens tonight.
However, the laser tag arena, at about
3,000 square feet, will be running within a
week, said co-owner and recent UF grad
Melissa Del Valle.
Unable to find fulfilling jobs, Del Valle,
21, and fellow Gator alumnus Gabriel Pefia,
24, decided to open the business.
Games cost $8 a person and $7 for stu-
dents, with a maximum of 14 players.Children are welcome during the day,
but Mars is 18-and-up after 10 p.m.
Del Valle said they'll stay open until
midnight Sunday through Wednesday, but
adults can drink and play until 2 a.m. Thurs-
day through Saturday.
Del Valle and Penfa
Around are excited to open their
Gainesville doors after about eight
months of preparation.
"We had no idea how many people it
would really take to get everything done,"
Del Valle said, adding that they've made lots
of new friends along the way.
"It's been a really great relationship," she
said. "We're excited to be part of the down-
town community."ON CAMPUS
Speakers talk politics
By LYN KRAMER
Alligator Contributing Writer
Compromise and civility are non-
existent in Florida, according to a
Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist, a
former mayor of Jacksonville and a
former state senator.
Lucy Morgan, John Delaney and
Rod Smith spoke to a crowd of about
50 people at "Bipartisanship in Flori-
da?" Wednesday night in Pugh Hall.
"If we're going to limit the topic
of bipartisanship," said Morgan, the
journalist, "it would be a 30-second
conversation and we would say good-
night."
The state's capital and the nation's
capital simply lack bipartisanship and
civility, Morgan said."There is no civility anywhere,"
she explained. "It has evaporated
from politics."
"I've long hoped for more civil-
ity in public debate, because
there is a need for it. We can
disagree, but let's find a com-
promise."
John Delaney
former mayor of Jacksonville
John Delaney, former mayor of
Jacksonville and University of North
Florida president, expanded on the
idea of civility.

A wanted man was arrested after he
tried to escape police in a high-speed chase
in a stolen car late Tuesday night.
Claude Stephens, 41, drove away with
the car when he saw it parked and run-
ning outside a gas station, according to a
Gainesville Police report.
The car's owner immediately called
police, who ran the vehicle's description
over the radio.
Officer Anton Lipski noticed a carmatching the description and tried to pull
it over for a traffic stop. The driver sped
up and turned into a residential neighbor-
hood to escape.
An Alachua County warrant was out
for his arrest for violating parole. He has
previously been charged with auto theft,
burglary and dealing in stolen property,
and Stephens is a registered sex offender.

Crisis system debuts
By ASHLEY LARA MOSES
Alligator Contributing Writer
Alachua County is going red.
Alachua County Emergency Man-
agement is encouraging residents to
register for CodeRed, a new emergen-
cy-alert system.
CodeRed is a high-speed telephone
communication service that delivers
customized, prerecorded emergency
messages to homes and businesses.
This service allows county officials
to quickly deliver messages to target-
ed areas or the entire county.
"We need to have a toolbox of
mechanisms to reach people," said
David Donnelly, emergency manage-
ment chief for Alachua County.
CodeRed allows individuals and
businesses to register a primary
phone number, an alternate phone
number and an e-mail address, Don-
nelly said.
Cell phone users can also choose
to be notified via text message.
Alachua County is one of 13 Flori-da counties to have the CodeRed sys-
tem.
Gainesville Police Department
Cpl. Tscharna Senn said the system
will benefit Gainesville residents.
"Anytime we can give knowledge
to people in an easy way, it's a plus,"
Senn said.
"We need to have a toolbox
of mechanisms to reach
people."
David Donnelly
emergency management chief for
Alachua County
According to Donnelly, the county
is in a two-year agreement period
with CodeRed, which will last until
Oct. 1, 2011.
The system is funded by a Home-
land Security grant.
Residents will not be called unless
they are in the system's database.
Residents can register with Co-
deRed at www.coderedweb.com.at7 C 'y~he M 'er .

Crist says jobs are first
priority during session
THE ASSOCIATED PRESS
TALLAHASSEE -Governor Char-
lie Crist has one last year to make a last-
ing mark on Florida and he says his first
goal as the 2010 legislative session be-
gins with "jobs, jobs, jobs."
Just so happens that creating jobs was
also his goal when last year's legislative
session and unemployment has since
gone up from 9.8 percent to 11.8 percent
in December, even with the billions of
dollars in federal stimulus money Flori-
da received and Crist traveling the state
to listen to concerns of businesses.
This year, Crist has several propos-
als to try to create jobs, including $57.4
million in corporate income tax cuts, re-
storing a tax holiday on back-to-school
clothes and supplies, delaying an in-
crease in unemployment compensation
tax, cutting red tape for licenses and
permits and setting aside money to at-
tract businesses and help the space pro-
Legalize it. Don't criticize it!

With as little as two hours every week,
students can impact a child's life and fulfill
volunteer requirements for class.
After School Gators, part of UF's Center
for Leadership and Service, is in need of stu-
dent mentors for elementary students, kin-
dergarten through fifth grade, from 2 to 5:30
p.m. Monday through Thursday.
Meghan Taffaro, director of After School
Gators, said they would love to take as many
volunteers as possible because the school's
paid staff members are overwhelmed.
Taffaro, a UF senior, has been a volunteer
for about four years and said the experience
has been rewarding for everyone involved.
"I have developed a relationship with a
bunch of students, and the staff really ap-
preciates us," Taffaro said.

Five election complaints were filed as of 8 p.m. Wednesday
RESULTS, from page 1 tion, and 79 percent of students voted for UF mom has been in Gainesville since Monday chanting "U-N-I-T-E," with Meyers i
fee, no fee."
Cavataro, who hugged Charles after the
announcement of her victory, said he was dis-
appointed with the results but still proud of
the 20 Senate seats his party won and the vote
against the fees.
"That's a Gator revolution," he said.
Charles said the Reitz fee represents some-
thing students have voted against, and she
wants to make sure to represent them.
Students voted in favor of an amendment
that will update the Student Body Constitu-to join the Workers Rights Consortium, which
works to correct labor violations in factories
that make clothing with university logos.
Campaigners braved the rain Wednesday
in a last-minute attempt to get students to
vote. Members of both parties offered their
umbrellas to passing students.
When the polls closed at 8 p.m., about 75
members of the Unite Party headed over to
The Swamp Restaurant while about 11 mem-
bers of the Student Alliance party went to
Mother's Pub & Grill.
Charles arrived with her mom, stepdad
and younger brother at about 10:30 p.m. Herand made cookies for all the party volunteers.
At Mother's Pub & Grill, members of the
Student Alliance party snacked on $2 burgers
and sweet potato fries. Some drank Red Stripe
and Pabst Blue Ribbon, but many Student Al-
liance party hopefuls were
Student t at home resting beforeGovernment heading to the restaurant.
The Student Alliance
party trickled into the seating area outside the
Orange & Brew beginning at 11:20 p.m. They
smoked cigars and, wearing their green T-
shirts, chanted "Green means go."
The Unite Party came at about 11:40 p.m.n the lead,
wearing his lucky shorts despite the cold.
Alfonso said that the election was a smooth
one overall, despite concerns over double-vot-
ing. She said the election commission will look
into double voting by the end of the week.
"It was raining a little bit
today[Wednesdayl," Alfonso said. "I think
that hurt us."
Andrew Brown, chair of the Election Com-
mission, said there were five election com-
plaints filed as of 8 p.m. Wednesday, and he
anticipates more will be filed. He said the elec-
tion commission will be meeting on Friday at
6:30 p.m. in room 287 of the Reitz Union.
Rafael Yaniz, Student Alliance party treasurer candidate, claps during the
election results Thursday morning at the Orange & Brew.None of the speakers were paid
BIPARTISAN, from page 1
in public debate, because there is a need
for it," Delaney said. "We can disagree,
but let's find a compromise."
He said finding a balance will leave
people walking away happy and satis-
fied.
Rod Smith, former Florida senator,
said compromise is not a bad thing all
the time. The United States was built on
compromise, he said.
"You have to make sure that within
your own party you don't get too nar-
row," Smith said. "Talk to people you
don't agree with and find a middle
ground."
Jordan Barrish, a public relations
junior, holds the same mindset as thethree-member panel.
"I completely agree that we need
more communication between parties,"
she said.
Nicole Flikier, a public relations se-
nior, felt the political conversation lacked
a means to an ending of bipartisanship.
"I believe that bipartisanship and ci-
vility need to happen," she
On said, "but I would have liked
Campus to know how they're work-
ing to make it happen."
Ann Henderson, director of the Bob
Graham Center for Public Service, said
the event was the perfect way to high-
light the issue of bipartisanship in Flor-
ida before it is brought up in the state
legislative session in March.
Henderson said none of the speakers
were paid to speak.

together telling us about how stupid and ungrate-
ful our generation is and how, in his day, every-
thing was much better. But imagine if he sat down and wrote
a book about it.
Mark Bauerlein, an English professor turned author of "The
Dumbest Generation: How the Digital Age Stupefies Young
Americans and Jeopardizes Our Future (Or, Don't Trust Any-
one Under 30)," claims young people are so attached to the In-
ternet and texting that technology is making them stupider.
We can't argue with Bauerlein's assertion that a change is
occurring. But the world changes, and we come out on the other
side better for it. Is our generation dependent on the Internet?
Yes. But does that mean we scratch our heads at the printed page
or dissolve into chaos when hurricanes knock out our power?
Although we are so interested in ourselves that we constantly
post for the world to see, we can't be any more selfish than the
group that was dubbed Generation Me. While we find surfing
the Internet for our information faster and easier, we aren't shy-
ing away from higher education or reading for pleasure.
Bauerlein may see us as a dull-minded mass shifting from
place to place as we attempt to stay forever plugged in, but we
see individuals affected differently by the world and its chang-
es. The Internet opens minds rather than closing them and helps
us learn about things that might otherwise have been out of
physical reach. And we're not afraid that we'll drop the written
word or the way we've preserved it since the ancient Egyptians
started scrawling on papyrus.
Bauerlein may see us as a mass of young people sans iden-
tity and individuality. But we're people who, like Bauerlein
probably was at our age, are tired of being told how much bet-
ter things were before we came along.
Serial Killer Whale
Once again, a captiveanimal has killed its
trainer, and this time,
it's close to home.
On Wednesday, SeaWorld
Orlando's 6-ton killer whale
Tilikum killed his trainer dur-
ing a performance. And this
might not be his first offense.
In 1991, he was in the water
with two other orcas when a
trainer was forcibly drowned.
Eight years later, park em-
ployees found a dead man
draped over Tilikum's body,
though no one knows how
he ended up in the water. The
Associated Press published a
list of notable maulings, and
they're averaging two a year.
So what do we see that the
rest of the world seems to be
missing? OK, we'll paint you
a picture.
You're walking to class
one day and out of nowhere
a giant net scoops you up and
puts you in a hot tub. And
you live there for the rest ofyour life. Sure, you're not so
smart. Sure, they give you
lots of cupcakes. But you live
in a hot tub. And maybe they
throw in a random guy you've
never met.
Is it really surprising that
animals that were born to
swim thousands of miles or
run over expanses of land
snap and attack the people
who padlock them into cages
and confine them to glorified
bathtubs? We don't think so.
Aside from the undeniably
unfit enclosures zoo animals
are restricted to, the prisoners
are expected to perform rou-
tines and interact with other
animals they might not be
paired with in the wild. This
causes stress, which causes
them to act out.
Until Americans stop im-
prisoning animals for fun and
profit, we can't blame Tili-
kum or any other living thing
in unjust captivity for lashing
out against its captors.

America has chance to prove itself
s one of the most important battles in the war onterror rages in the Taliban stronghold of Marja, Af-
ghanistan, another battle is being fought on Amer-
ican soil over the fate of suspected terrorists.
Namely, the case of Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, self-
proclaimed mastermind of Sept. 11, has gained much pop-
ularity in the media.
While some believe that Mohammed should be tried in
civilian court, others think of him as a military combatant
and therefore only fit for trial in a military court.
Then there are those who believe the mere presence
of Mohammed within our borders is enough to spark
Armageddon.
It isn't a matter of the American justice system or
what court this mad man should be tried in. Just pure,
instinctual fear.
It's exactly what terrorism calls for: an unbridled fear
that sends people into a panic.
That panic often leads them to think and do irratio-
nal things.
But what are people afraid of, and what does the fear
accomplish?
There is no doubt the threat of terrorism is real, but
at the same time it must be put into perspective.
Terrorist attacks do not occur in this country on a
daily basis (though I'm sure the 24-hour news outlets
would love to see the ratings boost from all the cover-
age).
In the almost nine years since Sept. 11, attacks have
been foiled on people like Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab
who, even with thoughts of 72 virgins waiting for him
in the afterlife racing around in his head, could not wire
a bomb to properly explode from its hiding place in hisEric Tegethoff underwear.
Speaking Out If attempted attacks on this
country are numerous, they are
about as well thought out as that
last minute idea you had for a party in your dorm fresh-
man year with your RA sleeping in the room next door
to you.
Sept. 11 itself stands alone as a wholly tragic fluke in
our history.
So, to imagine that one man in custody of the U.S.
government could wreak such havoc is quite preposter-
ous.
But if terrorism is really just a mind game, then it
appears that Mohammed may have some American citi-
zens beaten.
The question for the remaining, rational Americans
is: What do we hope to accomplish with the trial of the
Sept. 11 mastermind?
A civil trial for Mohammed has its inherent prob-
lems. Evidence obtained from torture cannot be used in
court.
However, a civil trial for such an evil man is more
like a testament to American rule of law for the world
to see.
Though spreading democracy and the American way
of life are immensely pompous ideologies in foreign
affairs, the power of equality under the law, a coun-
try's moral compass to a large extent, is a policy worth
preaching.
In addition, it gives us the chance to show our en-
emies we're not afraid of their bully-like tactics. Terror-
ism only works if it causes us to live in complete terror.

Online voting would solve problems
Double voting has been a concern in Student
Government elections for years, and there have
always been allegations directed at the Greek
houses. If Supervisor of Elections Ariana Alfon-
so is worried about double voting, she should
advocate for a switch to online voting tied to UF
IDs. The centralized list of who has voted would
prevent any double voting and save the Student
Body tens of thousands of dollars each election.

Gainesville's priorities are lacking
I find it interesting that there is no limit to
how many stacks of pancakes IHOP can give
away, and yet the city imposes a 130-meal limit
when St. Francis House feeds the homeless.

In response to David Hanan's letter likening
UF's tolerance of the Dove World Outreach Cen-THURSDAY, FEBRUARY 25, 2010 U ALLIGATOR, 7
ter on campus to tolerance of genocide, I'd like
to make a few points.
The members of Dove World Outreach Cen-
ter spoke in a free-speech zone. If you have a
message of intolerance to push, feel free to have
a shouting match with some crazies. The rest of
us would rather get to class on time than argue
with idealogues, but we don't condone hate.
Genocide still happens and proud citizens
of the free United States know it. Despite this,
atrocities continue and the death and displace-
ment of millions of people as a result of politi-
cal violence in Africa is unchecked. Maybe if our
government stopped trying to push sanctions
on Iran and tried pushing some on the Demo-
cratic Republic of Congo, something could be
done for these people. As it is however, the West
continues to buy coltan (used to make all your
cellphones and iPods) from violent warlords
and support governments that turn a blind eye
to genocide. Lastly I would like to request that
UF students stop equating everything to the Ho-
locaust. Neither the Student Alliance Party nor
members of the Dove World Outreach Center
are Nazis, and we cheapen lessons taught by
a dark page in history when we take the Holo-
caust out of context.

There is no way to pack so much
excitement into a single beer pur-
chase as with a brewery sampler
pack. Featuring four to six different
beers, usually spanning the entire
spectrum from light to dark, a 12-
pack of beer and a handful of friends
can quickly become your very own
beer-tasting party.
Short of physically going to the
brewery where the beer is made (also
highly recommended), sampler packs
are by far the most efficient way to
taste an entire line of beer. Many dis-
tant breweries ship only variety packs
to Gainesville, and sometimes you
can even find a bottle or two of limit-
ed-release or seasonal beer tossed in
with the standard fare.
For maximum visual appeal, pour
half a glass of every style so you can
see the color range from light to dark.The aroma will be best in these big-
ger glasses, so even if you don't share
the glasses to drink, let everyone
smell the beer in a big glass. Drink an
ounce or two of each down the line in
the same order (light to dark) to get
a general feel for any beers that you
particularly like, and then focus in on
your favorites in larger quantities.
In the end, think of it as a three-
step process: Buy theBehind sampler pack, drink
* * the sampler pack and
profit. My methodol-
ogy is only a suggestion; however,
with a few close friends and a variety
of beers to choose from, I guarantee
that you are going to have a good
time.
The best place in Gainesville to
find variety packs is Ward's Super-
market, located at 515 NW 23rd Ave.

Students take over blogosphere
By BENJAMIN EVANS
avenue writer
It's no secret that blogging can
put you on the fast track to success.
But how much you achieve out there
on the Web depends on the amount
of work you're willingto put in.
Marissa Fuchs, 21, tries to get
in about four posts a day. Brenton
"Ace" Brown, 21, aims for about 25.
Fuchs launched her fashion blog
last September, and Brown's music
blog is less than 2 months old, but
thetwofriends have already received
an overwhelming amount of positive
feedback. It didn't take long after
meeting them to see why.
Fuchs met me for our interview
with her Blackberry in hand, dressed
in frilly, Indian-inspired shoes, ripped
jeans and a loose black shirt hanging
off one shoulder. The Longlsland na-
tive is one of those people you meet
and instantly know she can teach
you a thing or two about fashion.Her blog, MarissaCaseyTrend.
com, grew out of bored days in
her room and the library, scouring
fashion sites and blogs for the lat-
est trends. She shared her fashion
tips with friends and soon saw that
people were interested in what she
had to say.
"Most people don't have the time
to go to different sites, so I do it for
them," Fuchs said.
One goal Fuchs has for her blog
is to show what celebrities are wear-
ing and find affordable alternatives
for college students who might not
have the money for designer duds,
she said.
Brown also keeps his subscribers
up-to-date on fashion trends, letting
them know about the newest kicks
on the market or the latest designer
Kanye West is wearing. Butthe main
focus of his blog, AKidNamedB.com,
is hip-hop.
"I wanted to create a place for me
to get my music out there, get othermusicians heard," said Brown, who
has opened up for Drake, Redman
and Method Man under the name B.
Brown, formerly Boogs Milli.
Brown's secret to success is sim-
ple. He's almost always at his com-
puter working on his blog. When he's
away, he's only thinking about get-
ting back to do more, he said. All his
work has luckily not been in vain be-
cause he's even beaten some of the
top hip-hop blogs to news stories.
Chances are, if you hear a new
song, Brown heard it two weeks ago.
"I like to be the gatekeeper of a
lot of music," he said.
Fuchs plans on movingto L.A. af-
ter college to begin a career in event
planning. Her blog could jump to the
next level this year, with talks of ce-
lebrity photos being exclusively put
on her blog, she said.
Brown was recently asked by Cali-
fornia-based clothing company Circle
of Success to go to L.A. to blog about
its clothes.Take a look inside,

'Defiance' opens at The Hipp
By JON SILMAN
avenue writer
You may not know who John Patrick Shan-
ley is, but you may have heard of the Tony- and
Pulitzer-winning author's famous melodrama
"Doubt," recently brought to the silver screen.
The author's second play in a trilogy about Ameri-
can hierarchy, "Defiance," is storming the Hip-
podrome theatre tonight in a run that will last
through March 21.
In a special preview price tonight, tickets are
$15foradults and $12for students. They'll normal-
ly run $25 to 30 for adults. Jessica Hurov, director
of advertising and marketing at the Hippodrome,
is excited about the prospect of this production.
The play's setting is a North Carolina marine base
in 1971. The camp is awash in racial tensions and
a young black captain is promoted in an attemptto
stemtheracialtideofdiscontent.Theyoungcaptainand his superior officer are soon caught in a "rivet-
ing web of moral issues that set the stage on fire."
In order to realistically portray marine protocol,
Hurov wentto the local armed forces recruiter and
Veterans of Foreign Wars to ask for some help.
"We talked to active duty and retired marines
to make sure it's true to life,"
Hurov said. "They collaborated
with us on everything from how
to salute to the authenticity of
the costumes."
The Hippodrome is a self-
producing professional theater
that plans its season a year in
advance. When a play is successful, an agent for
the playwright will make the rights available to
regional theater. According to Hurov, "Defiance"
was grabbed as soon as it became available.

Corey Smith introduces new album at The Venue
By MICHELLE PROFITS
avenue writer
Georgia native Corey Smith has
amassed a reputation for singing
songs about feelin' good. And just
how good? Read on tofind outwhy he
wants to give you his music for free,
why his fans are bloodthirsty and why
John Mayer annoys him. Smith plays
at The Venue tomorrow at 9 p.m. with
tickets starting at $15.
How does it feel to be a Bulldog
in Gainesville?
Gig at every big rivalry in every col-
lege town in the SEC, I look at it like
that. It's a lot of fun, but I hope thatpeople know me for my music and my
songwriting and not that I'm a Geor-
gia football fan.
Tell us about your new album.
I've always written from personal
experience about things that were
important to me. I've never thought
a lot about what people would think.
If I did, I wouldn't have written songs
like 'Purple' or 'If I Could Do It Again.'
I knew there were gonna be some
fans that were not gonna like it, but
if it's about making records that were
only attempts to get more people to
like me, I wouldn't be doing my job,
right?
What's your writing process?I think most of them are my at-
tempt to resolve some sort of conflict
I'm having internally. Writing for me
is therapeutic. It's my way of dealing
with things. I don't think a lot about
what people are going to think of if
I deal with my issues openly in the
songs, then the songs will resonate.
What do you love about being on
the road?
The food is awesome. Seeing the
country, meeting the people. I just
love to travel, but at the same time, I
don't like being away from my family.
Why do you let your fans down-
load your music for free on your
Web site when all your music is oniTunes?
I would rather have people lis-
ten to my songs than not listen to
my songs. I love it when they pay
for them. It's great I can support my
family, but more than that I just want
people to listen to them. I just make
it available to people. For me, it's
not about the money as much as it's
about the whole experience.
How do you think Twitter has in-
fluenced the music community?
I'm not sure about Twitter yet. I've
been doing it for four or five months
now, and I'm still not sure about it.
I think I delete more tweets than I
post. No one cares about what I'mdoing. As cool as I think John Mayer
is, I don't really want to know John
Mayer. I think the more we get to
know these people, the more flaws
we are gonna find and the less we
will respect them.
Craziest fan moment or experi-
ence?
One time, I got bit by a fan. I was
taking a picture with this lady in Ar-
kansas, and she was drunk and old-
er. I take pictures with everyone ev-
ery night, and she just reached over
and bit me. Hard, almost drew blood,
WTF. I was so pissed off. Damn lady.
I don't know how I'm going to explain
the bite mark.

Digging for
fashion gold
By ASHLEY MCCREDIE

While transitioning into spring save by mak-
ing a trip to local consignment shops. If you dig
through them, you will find some treasure.

backs has been in Gainesville for 26 years and
has everything from cowboy boots and vintage
prom dresses to Old Navy sweaters and leather
jackets.
2. Fashion Exchange of Gainesville, 2032
NW Sixth St. -The Fashion Exchange only has

petites and plus. It's the most organized of the
stores and has good-quality basics.

Best burger for your buck
By DREW WATKINS
and JOHN LANSING
avenue contributing writers
I Drew: Find yourself hungry on the weekend?
Then stay the hell away from Mac's Drive Thru,
' cause it ain't open. These two critics learned
that the hard way, but that's one of the few flaws
of this classic Gainesville eatery.
You might have some trouble finding Mac's:
It's in a tiny little shack across the street from Tu-
toring Zone. Pretty ordinary on the outside, but it
grills up a mean burger on the inside, and that's
L@)f R@ g d® ®®
Lauren Joos/Alligator
Mac's Drive Thru, 129 NW 10th Ave , serves up the
juiciest, best-hangover-cure burger in Gainesvillejust about all it grills up. The menu consists of
burgers and a few different types of sandwiches,
but in this case, less is more.
John: Is it time to talk about the fish sandwich
yet?
Drew: No, not yet. Once you receive your
Mac's meal (preferably via drive-thru ), you'll
have little to no idea about where you just got
your burger from. Mac's serves it up in a plain
white paper bag, and you drink your drink in a
pretty nondescript cup. Who said commercial
branding matters these days?
John: They also serve up a prime fish sand-
wich. Just as Mac's burgers are better than your
average burger, the fish sandwich steps up its
game as well. At around $2, pretty much every-
thing on the menu is fired up right there in front
of you.
Drew: Mac's basically took the childhood
concept of managing a lemonade stand and just
biggerized it. Any closing comments?
John: While Mac's Drive-Thru is a bit of a trek
away from where you probably live, it's a good
spot for a Tutoring Zone Tuesday or just an es-
cape from your everyday mass-produced burger
chain. It's got all the grease and satisfaction of
your standard McDouble without the feeling that
usually comes after. In fact, you'll wish you'd or-
dered more.Ashley McCredie/Alligator
Flashbacks, Fashion Exchange of Gainesville and
Sandy's Savvy Chic Resale Boutique offer fun findsBy MICHAEL PERRONE
and AMELIA HARNISH
avenue writers
He says.
"Do you mind putting on a condom?" is one
of those questions that make men cringe with
disappointment. Of course I mind. I mind having
to put the foreplay on pause. I mind having to
stumble in the dark for my pants and dig through
the pockets.
But even though it is such a monumental
hassle, I comply. In the interest of safe sex and
of ensuringthere won't be any mini-me's running
around anytime soon, I make sure to wrap it up,
every time.
And in reality, it's a no-brainer. With all the
negative consequences of sex today -unwanted
pregnancy, HIV/AIDS and other STDs -there is
no reason not to wear protection. The '70s are
long gone. The era of carefree sex has been re-
placed with an era of awareness and responsibil-
ity.
Now, the only way to guarantee that you won't
knock anybody up or get syphilis is abstinence.
But that's no fun. According to the National In-
stitutes of Health, condoms have an 85 percent
success rate at preventing pregnancy and STDs
when used properly.
As men, it is our duty to always have the nec-
essary protection at our disposal. That means
keeping a supply in your bedroom, car and pock-
et. Just don't store them in your wallet. All the
friction from opening and closing your wallet will,
over time, degrade the latex, which means that
the jimmy you've been keeping in there since
high school isn't to be trusted.
And speaking of friction, never double up. You
may think that you are taking the safe road by
twin-bagging it, but this can cause your rubbers
to break.
We can all agree that sex with a condom
doesn't feel nearly as good, but using lube can
help remedythat problem a bit. Using petroleum-
based lubricants like Vaseline break down the
latex. For the chemistry majors out there, it's like
acid to your condom.
To close on a serious note, there is no reason
why you shouldn't be practicing safe sex. Every
time you knock boots without some form of con-
traception, you are playing a dangerous game,
where losing means having a baby, catching
something or worse. So wise up, and do like the
Boys Scouts say. Always be prepared.

Litl gadget, big world:- Netbook makesWeb surfing too easy
By JON SILMAN
avenue writer
The litl is a big idea from a small
computer company based in Boston.
In its purest form, it's a computer so
simple to use that you don't have
to spend an irritatingly long hour
explaining the way it works to your
grandmother -she can (gasp) figure
it out on her own right out of the box.
It's kind of like a netbook, but it ex-
ists "in the cloud."
Cloud computing is a nerdy term
for Internet computing where every-
thing exists on the Web. It's the idea
thatyou don't actually need to install
anysoftwaretothe machine because
everything you need is on the Web.
"Computers are like cars," said
James Gardner, VP of Marketing for
litl. "Some people like manual trans-
missions where you have more con-
trol of the engine and maintenance
of the vehicle. Others prefer an au-
tomatic transmission, so they don't
have to worry about any of that."
In this analogy, the litl would bea car that drives itself. The com-
pany sent me one to try out, and it
came in fancy compartmentalized
cardboard packaging along with a
note welcoming me to the litl family.
The litl's simple design had me on
the Internet within seconds, but I
wanted to take it through the pac-
es.
I went on Hulu and watched
an episode of "Family Guy" while I
checked my e-mail. The litl was fast
and responsive, and I was surprised
with the lack of Internet lag. The in-
terface is divided into "cards" (think
channels on the Nintendo Wii) on
the screen, which represent differ-
ent Web sites and built-in features
like weather and a "media wall."
The screen also flips to feature an
"easel mode" in which the computer
basically becomes a viewingscreen,
and it's easily controlled by a knob
that rotates through the on-screen
cards.
The litl has a HDMI input that lets
you use your TV as a viewingscreen,
and its browser is based on Mozillasoftware and is similiar to Firefox.
The keyboard has a "litl" key that
automatically takes you back to the
home screen from where ever you
are, making navigation a breeze.
It incorporates many of the Web
2.0 applications (like Shutterfly and
flickr) right out of the box. Because
nothing is stored on the computer,
there is no way to lose any of your
data. Also, the litl presents every-
thing neatly without all the usual
desktop clutter of atypical Macor PC.
The unit can be ordered online and
costs $699.
With a comparable netbook from
Acer on the market for $300, I asked
Gardner to explain the price point.
He said that the litl is a premium
product that's great for your par-
ents and grandparents or younger
children to use. There's no main-
tenance, software or updating to
worry about. The high-tech screen
was designed to be viewed from
any angle, and the litl's durability
makes it ideal for any room of the
house. Litl comes with an uncon-Provided by Lisa Hendrickson
Order the Litl online for $699 at litl com and follow the company on Twitter @asklitl
ditional two-year warranty, and it
has a USB port so you can upload
pictures from your digital camera.
Whether the litl will do for comput-
ing what the Wii did for video gam-ing remains to be seen.
However, it's an innovative prod-
uct that actually takes all of the
hassle and guesswork out of com-
puting.

No. 5 Gators hold off late charge to top Knights 7-6
U FRESHMAN HUDSON RANDALL THREW FIVE
SCORELESS INNINGS.
By TYLER JETT
Alligator Writer
tjett@alligator org
Hudson Randall's first start was just like he imag-
ined. Only wetter.
Rain pushed Randall's debut back 30 minutes
Wednesday, but once he took the mound, the fresh-
man pitched five efficient innings, allowing no runs
on only three hits as No. 5 Florida (4-0) beat UCF (3-1)
7-6.
Since signing with the Gators during his senior
year at Atlanta Dunwoody High, Randall said he
constantly thought about making his first start at
McKethan Stadium.
"(The game) was everything I pictured," he said.
"It wasn't the best of days, but I worked with it and
did what I could."
Randall threw first-pitch strikes against 12 of the
18 batters he faced and used his two-seam fastball to
- help induce nine ground-ball outs.
"He was in total control of the game," UF coach
Kevin O'Sullivan said. "I thought he was outstand-
ing."
O'Sullivan is keeping the Gators pitchers on a short
leash early in the season, and Randall was restricted
to 71 pitches. But in a combined 18 1/3 innings, the
Harrison Diamond/ Alligator Staff UF starters have yet to surrender an earned run.
UF freshman pitcher Hudson Randall pitches early in the Gators' 7-6 win against UCF at McKethan Stadium on Wednes- Florida jumped on UCF starter Brian Adkins early
day night. Randall did not allow a run in his first start, which was delayed 30 minutes because of rain. SEE BASEBALL, PAGE 19
UF WOMEN'S BASKETBALL
Florida falls to No. 22 Vandy
By EUGENIO TORRENS
Alligator Writer
etorrens@alligator org
Jennifer George played one of the best
offensive games of her young career, but it
was Vanderbilt's Hannah Tuomi who had a
career night.
Despite entering the game averaging just
9.6 points per game, Tuomi scored a person-
al-best 26 points on 10-of-10 shooting and
was one rebound shy of a double-double.
Her effort was enough to lead No. 22
Vanderbilt (20-8, 9-6 Southeastern Confer-
ence) past UF 71-60.
In a game more tightly contested than
the final score indicated, the Gators (14-14,
7-8 SEC) came within one point of tying the
Commodores but were never able to claim
the lead.
"We were dominated in the paint by
Hannah Tuomi," UF coach Amanda Butler
said. "Just really disappointed with our post
defense that we couldn't do a better job onan individual that generally does not per-
form a scoring role for their team."
Vanderbilt came into the game as one
of the top-shooting teams in the SEC and
didn't disappoint Wednesday night. The
Commodores shot 57.8 percent from the
field, including 41.7-percent (5 of 12) from
beyond the arc.
UF shot 40.4 percent
from the field, but that
number picked up sig-
nificantly in the second
half, when the Gators im-
proved their shooting to
Butler 46.7 percent.
George contributed
seven points before the break while UF
struggled from beyond the arc, shooting a
27-percent clip.
She was whistled for her fourth personal
16 seconds after coming in at the 10:54 mark
in the second half, and her minutes were

Forget Preston Tucker.
Tucker, a member of the pre-
season watch list for the Golden
Spikes Award -the sport's version
of the Heisman Trophy -is a baller,
but the Gators' fate doesn't rest in his
hands.
The first baseman won't get to
swing much unless his teammates
are a threat as well, and that's the key
for UF.
Last year, Tucker hit .364 with 15
home runs and 85 RBIs and earned
the National Collegiate Baseball
Writers Association Freshman Hitter
of the Year Award.
In UF's five NCAA Tournament
games, he hit .650 with three homers.

UF SWIMMING
Gators hit water for first of two primers for NCAAs
By MATT RUBIN
Alligator Writer
With the Southeastern Conference behind
them, the UF men's and women's swimming
and diving teams are ready to look toward the
NCAA Championships.
The Gators have two tune-ups left before
the women hit the water in West Lafayette,
Ind., on March 18, and the men take the pool
in Columbus, Ohio, on March 25.
They'll compete in the first of those today
through Sunday at the Florida Swimming Se-
nior Championships in Orlando.
Following the SEC Championship Meet in
which the men's and women's teams both fin-
ished second, Florida will use the meet to shift
its focus toward the national scene.
That means getting as many swimmers
qualified for the NCAA meet as possible, aswell as developing younger swimmers for
depth.
For this reason, the Gators won't bring a
full roster to Orlando. They'll focus on swim-
mers who failed to qualify at the SEC Champi-
onship and those who didn't compete at all.
"We've been really fortunate here at Flori-
da to bring along some younger athletes that
are a little less experienced and we take maybe
a few more then some other teams in the coun-
try do," UF coach Gregg Troy said. "But some
of those people become the Conor Dwyers and
the Jeff Raymonds. Jeff Raymond has scored a
lot of points for us. They're the ones that really
help us down the road, so we're developing."
Dwyer notched five NCAA automatic-
qualifying times at the SEC Championship,
two as an individual and three as part of relay
teams. Overall, the Gators had five qualify-
ing times on the women's side and 13 fromthe men, and they'll be looking for more this
weekend.
By having more swimmers earn low
NCAA provisional-qualifying times or even
automatic-qualifying times, they'll not only
increase the chance of individual swimmers
doing well, they'll better
the odds of placing high as
a team at the national meet.
"On the men's side,
we have four or five guys
that are kind of one-event
guys," Troy said. "We don't
take them to conference
meet but they're special-
ists, maybe in the distance
freestyle or they're really good in the butter-
fly but not quite as well-rounded. This is their
opportunity because they can still get to the
NCAAs."We think we might have two or three
more become standard and a couple of them
can even score at the NCAAs, so it's really im-
portant for us team-wise, those couple of extra
points. We've got to give them a great chance
to see if they can qualify."
Former Olympian Gemma Spofforth tal-
lied three of the women's squad's five auto-
matic-qualifying times at the SEC meet, but
Troy said he was happy with his swimmers'
performances overall.
"The women did a great job of fighting
last weekend," Troy said. "We have some-
where between ten and fifteen qualified for
the NCAA meet. I feel really good about our
chances moving forward that we're going to
be outstanding at the NCAA meet. We were
certainly not pleased about being second, but
we were really happy with the performanc-
es."
Adams' RBIs prove pivotal after UCF comeback
BASEBALL, from page 18
-taking a 3-0 lead in the second -and never trailed. Af-
ter hitting 1 for 9 in the opening weekend, Bryson Smith
was pivotal for the Gators' offense, going 2 for 2, drawing
two walks and scoring twice.
Smith hit fifth against the Knights, a spot higher than he
did while struggling. O'Sullivan said he hoped the move
would give the junior college transfer more confidence.
"I don't know if that's the reason why he got two hits,
but I'm sure it said something to him when he saw his
name in the lineup hitting fifth instead of seventh or
eighth," O'Sullivan said.
Second baseman Josh Adams added two important in-
surance runs in the sixth when he hit a double to right-
center field, driving in freshmen Nolan Fontana and Mike
Zunino. Adams himself scored later in the inning on an
Austin Maddox double that gave the Gators a 7-0 lead.
But seven runs weren't enough of a cushion. UF reliev-
ers Nick Maronde and Greg Larson struggled following a
rough weekend against USF in which the two allowed a
total of five runs in 1/3 of an inning on Sunday.
Maronde entered in the sixth on Wednesday and gaveaway three earned runs in two innings. Larson relieved
Maronde but only lasted 1/3 of an inning, allowing an-
other three runs.
In the young season, Maronde and Larson have ERAs
of 23.14 and 16.87, respectively.
O'Sullivan said Maronde's struggles are due to his in-
ability to put batters away. The UCF rally began after Ma-
ronde gave up consecutive two-strike hits.
"I know he's a little down," O'Sullivan
said, "but to be quite honest with you, I'm
encouraged with the way he threw tonight.
Baseball He's just got to make better two-strike
pitches."
Junior Kevin Chapman was able to stop
the bleeding for the Gators, forcing a flyout to end the
eighth and shutting down the Knights in the final frame.
With two outs and the potential tying run on first,
Chapman ended the game by striking out UCF left fielder
Chris Duffy, who hit a two-run homer in the eighth.
"Anytime there's a tight situation. I love getting in,"

-we were giving up just as much on
the other end," Butler said.
VU outscored Florida 36-30 in the
paint and outrebounded UF despite
being one of the smaller teams the
Gators have faced. UF had bettered
some of its taller opponents, like Ten-
nessee, on the glass but found itself
on the short end of the boards 31-24.
"They haven't been one of the
stronger rebounding teams in our
league this season," Butler said.
Eleven first-half turnovers allowed
the Gators to stay in the game and
prevented VU from opening the lead,
but the Commodores' hot shooting
neutralized their miscues.
Florida used a 9-2 run in the sec-
ond half to chip away at Vanderbilt's
lead. But every time UF threatened,
the Commodores either got a three-
pointer or a Huomi and-one layup,
which happened after a Jordan Jones'
free throw that left VU up by one be-
fore Huomi converted on the three-
point play.

baseman Josh Adams hit ahead of Tucker, and
designated hitter Austin Maddox is behind him
at cleanup.
Odds are Tucker is going to get his this year.
The question is whether opponents will have
to pitch to him, and if they don't, whether he'll
make it past first base.
Florida got this season off to a very prom-
ising start in this department, as the formula
for success was on display in the first inning
against USF on Friday.
Against Bulls ace Randy Fontanez, the pre-
season Big East Conference Pitcher of the Year,
the Gators' first four at-bats yielded four runs.
Den Dekker singled, Adams brought him in
with a towering home run to left field, Tuck-
er walked (of course) and then Maddox came
through with an opposite-field blast. UF coach
Kevin O'Sullivan couldn't have drawn that up
any better.
"The whole key to our offense, I believe, is
Josh and Matt getting on base and forcing other
teams to have to pitch to Preston," O'Sullivan
said. "If they do that, I think we're going to
score a bunch of rims."
Maddox is the biggest question
mark in that plan. Den Dekker and Ad-
ams are veterans with solid seasons un-
der their belts, while Maddox is a newbie.
And as the guy behind Tucker, he's the most
important.
He impressed in his first two games by hom-
ering in each, but he's hitting .210.
Luckily, he has a good mentor one spot above
him in the batting order, as Tucker knows what
it's like to be a freshman in the spotlight.
"There's always a lot of pressure, not from
your peers, but you're putting a lot of pressure
on yourself trying to prove that you do belong
here," Tucker said. "The first swing he took at a
college ball, he hit it out.
"He showed that you can't pitch around
me every time because he'll put up some num-
bers."
Tucker hasn't put up crazy numbers him-
self so far (.267, zero home runs, zero RBIs), but
O'Sullivan isn't worried.
"He gets upset, but he'll be fine," O'Sullivan
said. "That's part of it. If you look at anybody
who has had the success he has had, you're go-
ing to get pitched to differently.
"I'm not worried about him. He's going to
stay in that third spot all year."
He's right not to worry about Tucker. It's a
long season, and he'll hit his stride. Whether the
Gators hit their stride as a team will depend on
the other guys keeping pace..
