3 MORE FRATERNITIES FACE 
HAZING ALLEGATIONS 
By Hope Dean
Alligator Staff Writer
While UF’s chapter of Chi Phi 
was suspended from campus, three 
other fraternities have been placed 
under limited activity directives — 
all due to hazing allegations. 
Alpha Epsilon Pi, Pi Kappa Al-
pha and Delta Upsilon can only host 
events with new members from 
8 a.m. to 10 p.m. Excluding Delta 
Upsilon, events with new members 
must be monitored by the fraterni-
ty’s chapter adviser or the house’s 
landlord during University Police 
investigations, according to letters 
sent to the fraternities by Dean of 
Students Heather White.
Alpha Epsilon Pi is also on de-
ferred suspension, which is a review 
period that could end in suspension 
for at least a semester for not com-
plying with administration rules, ac-
cording to UF Student Conduct and 
Conﬂ  ict Resolution sanctions. 
The letters don’t say what the 
hazing allegations are or when the directive will end. 
White declined to comment be-
cause of ongoing investigations. As-
sociate Director of Student Conduct 
and Conﬂ  ict Resolution Mick Earley 
referred The Alligator to UF spokes-
person Steve Orlando, who could 
only provide White’s letters. 
The Alligator emailed Alpha Ep-
silon Pi President Eric Jacobowitz, 
Pi Kappa Alpha President Joshua 
Murillo and Delta Upsilon President 
Jacob Fiore. They did not immedi-
ately respond to requests to com-
ment. 
Pi Kappa Alpha’s letter includes 
a bolded paragraph warning the 
fraternity members against “acts of 
retaliation,” which include threats, 
harassment or any other “endanger-
ing behavior” against anyone who 
reported hazing or is involved in the 
investigation. It is unclear why this 
paragraph was not included in the 
other letters. 
All three fraternities have a his-
tory of breaking UF’s Student Code 
of Conduct, according to UF’s SCCR 
website.

SHE HOPES TO RAISE 
AWARENESS FOR 
VICTIMS’ MENTAL HEALTH 
By Dana Cassidy
Alligator Staff Writer
Editor’s note: This is part two in 
an ongoing series investigating sexual 
violence on campus. The following 
story discusses suicide and rape.
She remembers walking along 
Stadium Road to the Homecoming 
football game with her friends. 
She doesn’t recall how she got separated, but knows a man took her 
hand and led her away. 
Kaitlin Lyttle, a 24-year-old UF 
master’s student studying early 
childhood special education, said 
she is the victim mentioned in the 
Oct. 7 University Police public safety 
alert about a sexual battery that hap-
pened before the game. She said a 
man forced her to perform oral sex 
on him.
The alert came after a string of 
sexual attack incidents publicly re-
ported since August, when Ian Mi-
laski, a 21-year-old UF resident as-
sistant, was arreast and later charged 
with attempted sexual battery. Lyttle posted about the incident 
and resultant suicide attempt on her 
personal Facebook and spoke to The 
Alligator. She provided The Alliga-
tor documents indicating she was a 
sexual battery victim in contact with 
campus police. 
On the afternoon of Oct. 5, Lyttle 
said she was walking alongside the 
UF marching band to perform with 
them as an undergraduate alum dur-
ing the halftime show. At some point, 
she was separated from her friends.
A man approached her and start-
ed walking away with her, she said. 
He either looked like someone she 
knew or said something to convince her to walk with him.
He then brought Lyttle in an area 
between the inﬁ  rmary and the Flori-
da Gym along Stadium Road. While 
there, the man forced her to perform 
oral sex on him, she said.
The alert said police are looking 
for a white male about 5 feet 8 inches 
tall and between 18 to 25 years old. 
He was described as having straight, 
dark blonde hair and wore khaki 
pants.
“He restrained me so I couldn’t 
ﬁ  ght,” Lyttle said. “I couldn’t help 
myself.”
Afterwards, Lyttle said he walked 
away. She sat there for a bit before leaving to ﬁ  nd her friends.
When she arrived at the stadium, 
the noise and chaos were overstimu-
lating. A friend took her to the ﬁ  rst 
aid station after Lyttle told her some-
thing was wrong, but they returned 
to the game after the visit.
Lyttle thought she was ﬁ  ne at 
ﬁ  rst. But her memory became cloud-
ed after she drove home that night.  
She doesn’t remember exactly 
how it happened later that night, but 
knew she swallowed a bottle of pills. 
She woke up in UF Health Shands 
Hospital the following afternoon after UF student raped before Homecoming game speaks out

THE NON-PROFIT 
SANCTUARY RUNS 
ON DONATIONS
By  Nicole Chang
Alligator Staff Writer
On a 335-acre farm, a mother and 
her son are outnumbered by their 
148 horses and four donkeys.
But Mary Gregory will say the 
one who runs it all is the dachshund, 
Minnie. 
With Minnie by her side, she di-
rects the farm 30 years after chasing 
a dream with her late husband Pe-
ter. The couple moved to the city of 
Alachua from South Florida in 1984 
to open Retirement Home for Horses 
Inc. on Mill Creek Farm, a home 
for abandoned, abused and retired 
working horses.
Mary Gregory and her son Paul 
call the farm a “labor of love.” 
In 2014, after his father’s death, 
Paul Gregory came to the farm to 
help his mother care for the animals. 
What started as a two week visit 
quickly turned into a lifetime com-
mitment. He left his successful real 
estate business career behind in Ft. 
Lauderdale, moved onto the farm 
and became the executive director of 
operations.
“I felt very proud taking this 
over,” Paul Gregory said. “Our motto 
here is ‘It takes a team to maintain 
this dream.”
But, the dream also comes with 
nonstop work. 
Paul Gregory and a team of 20 
to 30 volunteers spend every day 
grooming and feeding horses, mov-
ing and ﬁ  xing fences and cleaning 
and ﬁ  lling buckets.   
“If you enjoy what you’re doing, 
you never work a day in your life,” 
Paul Gregory said. The farm costs about $400,000 a 
year to maintain and relies entirely 
on public donations and volunteer 
help. On Saturdays, the farm is open 
from 11 a.m. to 3 p.m. 
Admission? Just two carrots as 
treats for the horses, a tradition Peter 
Gregory started more than 30 years 
ago.
Children ran around and laughed 
gleefully as horses munched carrots 
from their hands. At the front, Nora 
Denslow, a volunteer and one of 
about 150 sponsors, welcomed them 
with a warm smile. 
Trails are all around the farm for 
families, volunteers and sponsors to 
walk through and look at the horses 
and its namesake creek that runs 
through it. 
Denslow ﬁ  rst met the Gregorys 
in 1992 while trying to ﬁ  nd a rescue 
home for her pig, Rudy. She’s been 
an active volunteer since. 
When a horse arrives, Denslow 
said the farm assesses the horse’s 
temperament for a couple days to 
ﬁ  nd which of the 44 pastures would 
be most compatible. 
Once a horse is in a pasture, it 
will stay there unless there’s a spe-
cial circumstance or the horses have 
not adapted well. This is done to not 
break up the herd, Denslow said. 
Visitors can sponsor a horse, 
which costs $600 a year and helps 
fund the farm. Sponsors also receive 
a certiﬁ  cate, updates and photos of 
their horse, she said. 
Cynthia Lucia, a volunteer who 
has been coming to Mill Creek Farm 
for 11 years, sponsors two horses: 
Rusty and Traveler. 
She drove a golf cart loaded with 
bags of apples, bananas and carrots 
to ﬁ  nd Rusty and Traveler in their 
pasture behind a wooden fence and 
hand fed them their favorite treats. 
“This place is absolutely wonder-ful,” Lucia said. “It’s so much bet-
ter than having a horse of your own. 
Here, there’s over 100 horses and 
you can be friends with them all.”
Mary and Peter Gregory moved 
from England to the Bahamas 60 
years ago. From there, they went to 
Jamaica, then South Florida, ﬁ  nally 
retiring in Alachua, she said. 
Building the Retirement Home for 
Horses was not easy. In fact, Mary 
Gregory said many of her friends 
thought she was crazy for moving 
to Alachua after a lifetime of living 
oceanside. 
“They said, ‘Oh, you’ll hate it,’” 
Mary Gregory said. “I never missed 
the ocean.” The couple shared a dream of 
starting a retirement home for horses 
when they ﬁ  rst met at the University 
of London. They agreed if they ever 
had enough money, they’d do it. 
“I know that people would think 
I was crazy but it’s what I always 
wanted to do,” Mary Gregory said. 
She never wants to exit the prop-
erty’s gates. She goes to Publix on 
every Wednesday and gets all her 
errands done so that she can stay 
in her sanctuary for the rest of the 
week. 
“I’ve got everything that I love 
right in front of me and it doesn’t 
cost me any money,” she said. 
After Mary passes away, the Ala-chua Conservation Trust ensures the 
land can never be sold or owned by 
anyone else, she said. Instead, it will 
belong to the horses, which can’t be 
taken off the property. 
“I’ve had a wonderful life,” Mary 
said. “I’m so lucky to have been able 
to do everything that I’ve done and 
lived in different places, and now 
we’re here and I love this property.”

A young boy, Liam, pets a horse’s nose at Retirement Home for Horses Inc. Liam’s family, meanwhile, 
has the attention of another horse nearby. 
FEATURE FRIDAYtrying to end her life. 
She said she’s been back to her daily 
routine since, but owes her recovery to her 
friends and family. They realized some-
thing was wrong that night when she kept 
asking people to take care of her dogs after 
she died. 
“When I woke up, I remember thinking 
that I didn’t want to die,” she said.
When a victim of sexual assault or bat-
tery recounts what happened immediately 
following an attack, they don’t always tell 
every detail, said Lt. Brandon Kutner of the 
Alachua County Sheriff’s Office. People’s 
bodies try to defend against being attacked 
and can block out parts of traumatic inci-
dents.
“The mind tends to recall more of the 
incident when it’s given time to rest,” he 
said.
Law enforcement also uses special in-
terview techniques to look for smaller de-tails of what happened, he said. These 
could be as simple as what someone 
smelled, heard or even felt. For example, 
a victim remembering the scent of some-
one’s cologne can help narrow down a 
suspect in a case, he said.
Kutner said victims may be reluctant 
to report because of the stigma surround-
ing sexual assault and battery and the 
worry that law enforcement may not be-
lieve them.
“We don’t want to make that situation 
any more uncomfortable,” Kutner said.
It’s a word of advice Lyttle shares to 
others now: Make sure to ask for help in 
a time of need.
“Reach out for yourself because if 
people were willing to help me do that 
and care about me, you’re not alone,” she 
said.

SHE FACES A MAXIMUM 
OF 35 YEARS IN PRISON 
IF FOUND GUILTY 
By Jordyn Kalman
Alligator Staff Writer
A former City of 
Gainesville employee ac-
cused of stealing more 
than $91,000 in taxpayer 
dollars, part of which was 
used to pay for a butt lift, 
will go to court Dec. 2 after 
rejecting a plea deal. 
Former city staff spe-
cialist Natwaina Clark, 
36, was arrested in 2017 
after making 169 unau-
thorized purchases on 
company credit cards over 
a 16-month period from 
2015 to 2017, according to 
court records. 
Clark initially faced one 
charge of grand theft, two 
counts of money launder-
ing and one scheme to de-
fraud charge, according to 
court records. 
According to county re-
cords, she used the funds 
on several personal items, 
including: 
- $8,500 on a Brazilian 
butt lift 
- $854.40 on plane tick-
ets to Houston, Texas
- At least $3,485 on gift 
cards to various stores
- $318.97 on fruit ar-
rangements
- $373 on seafood
- $1543.80 on Sprint 
purchases
- $1,788.93 on medieval 
faire attire and gear
- $345.37 on two iPods
- A $1,300 70-inch 4K 
TV
Records show money was also spent on:
- A drone
- A dining room table
- A touch-screen laptop
- Kevin Durant shoes
- Two drifting scooter 
boards
Clark had a seven-year 
plea deal on the table from 
prosecutors but rejected 
the offer, according to 
county records.  
Clark is now being 
charged with seven counts 
of felony grand theft in 
addition to the previous 
charges of money launder-
ing and scheming to de-
fraud, which have a maxi-
mum of 35 years in prison 
upon conviction, accord-
ing to court records.
Clark’s trial and jury se-
lection had been resched-
uled at least twice before 
the most recent resched-
uling of Nov. 4 to Dec. 2, 
according to court records. 
Clark was released from 
Alachua County Jail after 
paying a bond of $20,000.

He stood up for the poor and the 
disadvantaged throughout urban 
America — but Elijah Cummings was 
principally the strong voice and politi-
cal advocate for Baltimore, where he 
was revered as his hometown’s cham-
pion.
The Democratic congressman lived 
at the doorstep of some of the city’s 
worst rioting, including violent 2015 
protests following the death of a black 
man, Freddie Gray, in police custody. 
Cummings’ involvement, taking to the 
streets with a bullhorn, helped quiet 
the storm.
Cummings, who died early Thurs-
day at age 68, also defended his 
majority-black city against President 
Donald Trump, who called his con-
gressional district “disgusting” and 
a “rodent-infested mess,” after Cum-mings criticized 
administration 
officials in over-
sight hearings.
“Mr. Presi-
dent, I go home 
to my  district 
daily. Each 
morning, I 
wake up, and I 
go and fight for 
my neighbors. 
It is my consti-
tutional duty to conduct oversight of 
the Executive Branch. But, it is my 
moral duty to fight for my constitu-
ents,” Cummings tweeted.
“He was so noble,” said city resi-
dent Mary Bianchi, who dropped 
flowers outside his home and walked 
away wiping tears off her face. “He 
was a lion, and I’m very sad. He died 
too young.”House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, who 
grew up in Baltimore and whose fa-
ther and brother were mayors of the 
city, said she was “personally devas-
tated by his passing.”
In his 12 terms in Congress, Cum-
mings steered support to the city. In 
recent years, that included funds to 
boost job training, address lead-based 
paint and fight homelessness, as well 
as grants to help fight heroin and 
other illegal opioids. He also battled 
for hundreds of millions of dollars in 
federal support for a light rail project 
to improve transit in the city, but Gov. 
Larry Hogan opposed the plan’s de-
sign and didn’t include state funding 
for it in 2015, killing the project.

News that should prompt real change
Many university presidents want 
only to hear and share good 
news. However, the only way our 
university can grow stronger and 
become greater is if we understand 
and are open to what needs to be improved. 
Keeping that in mind, this month I received 
news that greatly troubled me.  
The rate of reported sexual assault and 
sexual misconduct at our university and other 
universities is not declining. 
Instead, it is increasing.
UF conducted a climate survey of students on sexual 
assault and sexual misconduct with 26 other universities 
in 2015.  The Association of American Universities, a 
group comprising the nation’s top 60 public and private 
research universities, led the survey.  
The results were alarming and heartbreaking. 
In summary, 23 percent of undergraduate female 
respondents – nearly one out of every four female 
undergraduates – and 5 percent of undergraduate male 
respondents reported experiencing nonconsensual 
sexual contact by physical force, threats of physical 
force or incapacitation since enrolling at their university. 
UF’s numbers were lower, but still similar to the overall 
AAU reported results.
Any occurrence of sexual assault is unacceptable. 
UF’s goal is the elimination of any and all incidents of 
nonconsensual sexual contact. Given the survey results, 
we committed in 2015 to making a real difference in the 
incidences of sexual assault at UF. 
The AAU repeated its sexual assault and misconduct 
survey this past year, and this week they released the 
results. Again, UF participated along with 32 other 
universities. We are still analyzing the UF data, but 
the preliminary results are very distressing. Instead of 
seeing  fewer experiences of sexual assault compared 
with 2015, UF students reported more such experiences instead.
For the participating universities, the rate 
of nonconsensual sexual contact increased to 
26 percent for undergraduate women and 7 
percent for undergraduate men. There were 
also increases among graduate students 
and other identifiable groups. The rates of 
nonconsensual sexual contact for women,  
transgender, genderqueer and nonbinary 
students were significantly higher than for 
men.   
We will share UF’s survey results and analysis as 
soon as available, which I expect will be early next 
week. What is abundantly clear is that we need to do 
more to eliminate sexual assault. 
Following the 2015 survey, UF took a number of steps 
to reduce sexual assault, including implementing new 
sexual assault prevention training programs, creating a 
Student Advisory Board to help guide our prevention 
efforts and launching a nationally recognized bystander 
intervention model, “Green Dot.” 
Today, I am discouraged and disheartened by what I 
have learned from the latest survey. I expected progress 
in eliminating a significant problem on our campus, 
and instead the problem is even more significant than I 
understood four years ago.
With this year’s survey, UF needs to take a close 
look at what more we can do, while identifying our 
shortcomings and reexamining our approaches. We also 
need to do more to look out for each other’s well-being. 
Together, we must create a safe, supportive and caring 
university for all.
In order for UF to be truly great, it must lead in 
eliminating sexual assault.

dark clouded sky framed by large pine trees and leaves 
rustling in the cool wind. You’re suddenly thankful you 
wore your hoodie and jeans. It seems like autumn is fi-
nally here. With midterms over, you have time to enjoy 
one of the finer things in life — pumpkin patches.
Looking around, you see a field full of friends and family who 
are all transfixed by different shapes of the same fruit. 
You, on the other hand, are mesmerized by a strange cat.
It wanders through the pumpkin field as if it’s looking for 
something. As you start to approach it, it stops and stares at you. 
The cat’s green eyes look deeply into yours before it stalks away 
into the surrounding woods, making sure to look back at you 
before black fur merges into the darkness.
It’s almost as if the cat wants you to follow it.
You take one step forward, and then one step back.
Not today, Satan. Not today.
Your friends distract you from your potentially life-threatening 
adventure. Apparently, they found a pumpkin that looks like the 
shape of Rihanna’s shadow. From a distance, it looks like an in-
sult.
When you look closer you see...
Darts & Laurels 
The weather is starting to fit the season for once. For the most 
part, the mornings stay a cool 60 degrees and we no longer have 
to sweat on the walk to class. A laurel goes to the weather for 
finally gifting us with hoodie season. 
Unfortunately, some bad things come with this season as well: 
one of them being the college application process.
According to the Washington Post, at least 44 public and pri-
vate universities across the nation rank applicants before they 
even apply. They track applicants’ activity on their respective 
websites, how long they stay on a certain page and even informa-
tion regarding their financial status. This is extremely problem-
atic as they tend to accept students with a higher income, which 
favors those who require less financial aid and will likely spend 
more money on the school. A dart goes to these institutions for 
scamming people before they even get accepted. At least some 
schools have the decency to do it afterward. 
On Thursday, America was robbed of a hero. Longtime con-
gressman and civil rights activist Elijah Cummings died. The Alli-
gator Editorial board would like to give him a laurel for his work 
as a public official and thank him for fighting for those who are 
often marginalized.
Rest in power, Congressman Cummings. The world needs 
more people like you.
Unfortunately, the world is filled with people who clearly 
don’t know much about anything — one of them currently lives 
in the White House. President Donald Trump sent a letter to the 
Turkish president on Oct. 9, urging him to not attack Kurdish-led 
forces in Syria. 
Of course, the Turkish president ignored him, promptly throw-
ing his letter away. We can’t blame him, really, as the letter was 
written at a third-grade reading level. We have to give a dart to 
the Trump for not knowing how to communicate like an adult.
Despite this, some people in the U.S. government are actually 
behaving their age and making great changes while doing it. 
U.S. and international law enforcement have recently shut 
down one of the biggest child pornography sites. There have 
been 337 arrests around the world, including Jong Woo Son, one 
of the site’s administrators. The last laurel goes to the IRS and 
Homeland Security officials for making the world a safer place 
for children.
We’re hoping for changes as great as this one every week.

As a Florida resident, the impacts 
of climate change on my imme-
diate environment are not lost 
on me. As an avid bird watcher, 
the impacts of climate change on 
the local bird communities are also not 
lost on me. One of the potential effects of 
climate change is an increased intensity of 
natural disasters. In 2016, Hurricane Mat-
thew devastated Florida’s coastline, and I 
experienced ﬁ  rsthand the changing sand 
and vegetation composition. Shorebirds, 
such as terns, were heavily affected be-
cause their breeding grounds are on these 
beaches.
According to the Audubon’s new sci-
ence report “Survival by Degrees,” almost 
two-thirds of North American bird spe-
cies are at risk of extinction from climate 
change. As Audubon explains: “A higher 
global temperature will trigger larger scale 
impacts that will grow over time like sea 
level rise, which we are already experienc-
ing in places like Florida and the Caroli-
nas. A particular bird’s range may not be 
dramatically altered by changes in temper-
ature or precipitation locally, but coastal 
bird species will experience catastrophic 
habitat loss as nesting sites become inun-
dated with water as sea levels rise.” The 
numbers from this report are staggering 
and gut-wrenching. The good news, how-
ever, is that the science also shows that 
if we act now, we can help improve the 
chances for 76 percent of at-risk species.
So, what can we do? For starters, just 
talking about and sharing the ﬁ  ndings of Audubon’s science report educates others 
on the issues that our natural communi-
ties are facing. Also, there are organiza-
tions that you can join, including Divest 
UF: an organization of activists dedicated 
to ﬁ  ghting climate change by demanding 
that UF “cease investments in companies 
that buy, sell or trade in fossil fuels.” 
Moreover, there is an Audubon Campus 
Chapter at UF dedicated to avian conser-
vation through outreach and education. 
In the greater Gainesville community, 
the Civic Media Center serves as a link 
between environmental activist organi-
zations and the community by offering 
resources on progressive grassroots activ-
ism through its library, organization fairs 
and other events. There are many people 
who are already doing the work of ﬁ  ght-
ing against climate change and for the en-
vironment, it’s just a matter of connecting 
with them and offering your help.
The fact that bird populations are de-
clining means that a part of what makes 
campus beautiful is being threatened by 
climate change. Birds are a vital part of 
our environment; they are pollinators 
and seed dispersers and control the insect 
population. Without them, our natural 
communities will become imbalanced and 
unstable. This is everyone’s issue, not just 
bird watchers’ like me. The ﬁ  ght for our 
future is an everyday struggle but a neces-
sary one.

For some reason, there always 
seems to be some pushback 
when things don’t fall in 
straight lines, including hair. 
Despite how common curly 
hair is, curls still tend to be confus-
ing for hairstylists across the U.S. As 
someone with frizzy curls, the major-
ity of stylists didn’t understand my hair 
growing up. They complained that my 
hair was crazy, and it felt like they were 
guessing their way through the process 
— which you could clearly see in the results. The 
only time that they refrained from insulting my 
hair was when they were straightening it or re-
laxing it through keratin treatment, a process that 
chemically damages your hair. 
Either way, the process was attached with a 
higher price tag than expected. 
The DevaCut, the revolutionary “must-have” 
haircutting technique for curls, can range from 
$85 to $200. The technique dry-cuts curls to ac-
curately see the natural shape of curls, as op-
posed to the usual practice of cutting hair when 
wet. Hairstylists have to be specially certiﬁ  ed in 
the DevaCut. In other words, this technique is not 
taught in beauty schools, as cutting ethnic hair is 
not considered a normal practice. 
Topher Gross, a stylist at Seagull Salon in New 
York City told Bustle that many beauty schools 
exclude natural hair and kinkier textures from 
their lessons. Instead, they focus solely on ﬁ  ne 
and straight hair. 
“You [have to] go back to school,” he said to 
Bustle. “Or [pay to] get extra training for textured, 
natural and ethnic hair.”  
Gross added that styling textured hair was 
not a part of the New York State exam that he 
took in 2008, despite the diverse population of 
New York City. As a result, hair styling bills for curly and coily hair are increased, with 
added charges for being too difﬁ  cult 
and unfamiliar. This only pervades 
the standardization of straight hair as 
the social norm. It complements the 
discrimination against kinkier hair tex-
tures throughout the country.  
According to a recent report by 
Dove and its partnership with CROWN 
Coalition, black women are 50 percent 
more likely to either be sent home from 
work or know someone who’s been 
sent home from work because of their hair. In 
2002, a New York Times article concluded that 
“Straight-haired women have more fun,” detail-
ing how curly-haired women performed damag-
ing procedures to straighten their curls for hun-
dreds of dollars. In the 17 years since this article’s 
publication, society has become more accepting 
of different hair textures.
Beauty campaigns are gradually becoming 
more representative of different skin tones and hair 
types. California and New York are the ﬁ  rst states 
to implement laws against hair discrimination. 
However, it doesn’t change the fact that these 
laws shouldn’t need to be created in the ﬁ  rst place.  
In the same way that a makeup artist should 
be familiar with applying makeup on different 
types and shades of skin, all hairstylists should 
become familiar with different types of hair. 
Nobody chooses what type of hair ﬂ  ows from 
their scalp. Regardless of its shape or texture, all 
hair is beautiful, and all hair should be celebrated. 
To help do so, there needs to be an integration of 
all different hair types into beauty schools. 
Ignoring curly, natural and textured coils is ig-
norant to the diversity of hair that’s out there.

The Gators’ meetings 
with the Gamecocks this 
season and last have both 
come at precarious times 
in Florida’s grueling 
schedule. For the second 
year in a row, the Gators 
will head into the game 
following a loss, which 
is quite the coincidence 
considering UF has lost 
just four games in the 
past season and a half.
Florida’s win over 
South Carolina last sea-
son changed the percep-
tion of Dan Mullen’s first 
season as the Gators head 
coach. UF trailed by 17 
points near the end of 
the third quarter of that 
game. Florida was also in 
danger of losing its third 
game in a row to an SEC East opponent after back-
to-back losses to Georgia 
and Missouri.
I’m sure you know 
how that turned out: 
Feleipe Franks leads the 
comeback, shushes the 
home crowd and Florida 
rattles off 10 subsequent 
victories.
If that comeback 
doesn’t happen? The 
Gators miss out on a New 
Year’s Six Bowl and Mul-
len’s first season win total 
falls to nine which, while 
respectable, just doesn’t 
have the same ring to it 
as a 10-win campaign.
Now, 11 games later, 
Mullen and the Gators 
square off against Will 
Muschamp’s South Caro-
lina team on the heels of 
a loss once again.
But this time around, 
Florida heads into the game with a top-25 de-
fense and improved of-
fense in tow. This is not 
the same group that was 
reeling when these two 
teams met last year.
The Gators total of-
fense is up 48 yards per 
game despite a dip in its 
passing efficiency (184.9 
to 140.7 this season), 
which is due to an offen-
sive shift toward the pass 
led by quarterback Kyle 
Trask. Through seven 
games last year, Florida 
ran the ball on 59 percent 
of its plays compared to 
49 percent this season. 
Accordingly, UF’s offense 
averages almost 100 more 
yards per game through 
the air this year going into 
the South Carolina game 
than last year.

The last time Florida’s soccer team faced Auburn 
was in the 2018 SEC Tournament play-in match.
That game went the distance, with the Gators 
advancing to the quarterfinals in a penalty-kick 
shootout despite playing a man down after former 
midfielder Sarah Troccoli received a red card in the 
57th minute.
Now, nearly a year later, 24th-ranked UF will 
have to dig deep once again, as the Tigers come 
to Donald R. Dizney Stadium on Friday night for a 
rematch of last season’s thrilling meeting between 
the two sides.
“Auburn always comes in here fired up, I mean, 
always,” coach Becky Burleigh said. “I cannot ever 
remember an easy game against Auburn. I think 
they’ll be ready to go.”
The Tigers have lost two consecutive games in 
the past week, falling to Mississippi State and then-
No. 17 Texas A&M. Their recent form, however, 
has not changed Florida’s preparation for Friday’s 
conference battle.
“We’re doing lots of scouting, lots of mimick-
ing what Auburn does,” forward Kit Loferski said. 
“Teams tend to play their best whenever they play 
us, so it makes practice that much better for us.”
Tigers midfielder Bri Folds, who Burleigh 
dubbed “one of their best players,” leads Auburn 
in goals (6) and shots (31). Folds has also shown 
flashes of her passing abilities, which is evident by 
her three assists this season.
The Lakeland, Florida, native may cause prob-lems for a UF defense that has failed to record a 
clean sheet in three straight games. The Gators 
have been exposed at the back as of late, commit-
ting hapless mistakes and failing to track the runs of 
opposing attackers.
“Teams like Auburn will capitalize on that,” for-
ward Deanne Rose said. “So that’s just something 
that we talked about (that) we needed to clean up.”
When available, Rose has been the focal point 
of Florida’s offense due to her combination of speed 
and strength. But injuries and national team duties 
have hampered her playing time the past two sea-
sons.
She struggled in Sunday’s game against Ken-
tucky, missing two clear-cut chances to find the 
back of the net. One of those was a breakaway in 
which she kicked the ball right at the Wildcats goal-
keeper. The other was a shot from inside the box 
that sailed over the crossbar.
Luckily for the Gators, a trio of freshmen stepped 
up to provide a spark offensively.
Midfielders Laney Steed and Ava Kuyken scored 
their first collegiate goals for the program against 
UK in the 26th and 39th minute, respectively, while 
forward Kouri Peace registered her second career 
goal in the 50th minute.
“It’s just good to know we can trust everyone, 
not just rely on D(eanne Rose),” Steed said. “Every-
one is an amazing player, but knowing that I can hit 
one from outside the box or Vanessa (Kara) can hit 
a tap-in is just a good feeling.”

LSU quarterback Joe Burrow threw 
as many touchdowns as he did in-
completions on Saturday: three.
That’s also how many alligator-
Sports football writers sauntered 
into the state of Louisiana for the first 
time to cover that game. None of us ex-
cept Dylan — a Bayou State native — 
had ever experienced the delightful Ca-
jun accents and debaucherous streets of 
New Orleans.
Drunken frat guys wearing Florida 
polos may have invaded Bourbon Street 
before the game, but getting loaded off 
overpriced liquor would be the only win 
they’d experience.
The Gators suffered the first tick in 
the loss column, and the football staff 
gained a greater appreciation for playing 
night games in Death Valley, which is — 
frankly — loud as hell.
Florida has the chance to bounce 
back big time this week with a game 
against a 3-3 South Carolina team that 
*checks notes* just upset No. 3 Georgia 
in Sanford Stadium.
Our panel of football experts will 
tell you if the Gators can avoid the trap 
game, but first, Sports Editor Tyler Net-
tuno and Assistant Sports Editor Mari 
Faiello will debate the Battle to Finish 
Second in the Big 10 East: No. 16 Michi-
gan at No. 7 Penn State.
Michigan will win because… 
Jim Harbaugh rarely loses to Penn 
State. In his four tries against the Nittany 
Lions, he’s 3-1, including a 42-7 win last 
season. 
Quarterback Shea Patterson scored 
three touchdowns in that game. The 
senior is off to a good start this season 
with 1,246 yards, nine touchdowns and 
three interceptions. Against a PSU de-
fense that’s yet to face a dynamic passer, 
he could replicate some of last season’s 
success.
Also, people may be reading too 
much into Michigan’s 35-14 loss to Wis-
consin. The Badgers could legitimately 
be one of the best teams in the country, 
and since then the Wolverines have won 
three straight. PICKS

WOMEN’S TENNIS
By Victor Prieto
Sports Writer
The Gators women’s 
tennis team is sending four 
representatives into enemy 
territory this weekend to 
compete in the ITA South-
east Regional Champion-
ships. 
McCartney Kessler, Syd-
ney Berlin, Tsveta Dimi-
trova and Marlee Zein will 
travel 149 miles north to 
Tallahassee, slated to com-
pete in both the singles and 
doubles draw at the tour-
nament hosted by Florida 
State. 
Main draw play starts 
Friday morning, as Berlin 
and Dimitrova pair up for the second time this sea-
son, while Kessler and Zein  
will make their Gators dou-
bles debut together. 
Kessler, ranked No. 6 in 
the region, has had a busy 
fall season, notching the 
most matches of any Gator 
with 15. She’s held strong 
with a 10-5 record thus far 
and looks to improve on 
that in her second tourna-
ment in as many weeks. 
No. 85 Zein, Dimitrova 
and Berlin haven’t had the 
same experience, though, 
with the regional champi-
onship marking just their 
second tournament of the 
season. 
Last season Kessler 
was crowned the doubles champion alongside team-
mate Victoria Emma in the 
2018 ITA Southeast Re-
gional Championships in 
Atlanta, Georgia. She’ll try 
to repeat that performance, 
again, this year. 
Players from 17 dif-
ferent schools across the 
southeast region will com-
pete for an automatic bid 
to the 2019 Oracle ITA Na-
tional Fall Championships. 
Winners of both the singles 
and doubles draw will earn 
automatic bids to Newport 
Beach, California.

CROSS COUNTRY SWIMMING

Florida will compete in the Arturo Barrios 
Invitational in College Station, Texas, on Sat-
urday at 9 a.m., hosted by the Texas A&M Ag-
gies. It will be UF’s ﬁ  nal meet before the SEC 
Championship.
The Gators are coming off their second 
sweep of the season after visiting FSU on Oct. 
11. For the ﬁ  rst time in a while, the team is 
optimistic after dealing with sickness and 
multiple setbacks.
One runner who has appeared to be imper-
vious to the distractions of the season thus far 
is Jessica Pascoe.
The senior has done everything she can 
for the Gators in the last three meets, plac-
ing ﬁ  rst in all of them. Pascoe was recognized 
after the FSU Invitational by the USTFCCCA 
on Monday as the NCAA Division I Women’s 
National Athlete of the Week.
Assistant coach Chris Solinsky has been 
able to depend on her while some of his best 
runners have been plagued by sickness.  
Junior Payton Capes-Davis has stepped 
up for the women as well. The transfer from 
Bucknell University has been the second Gator to cross the ﬁ  nish line in every meet so 
far this season.
“This is the most mentally comfortable I’ve 
ever been with racing and running in my life,” 
Capes-Davis said.
The New York native said that she’s often 
struggled with anxiety and nervousness be-
fore races in the past but feels like this is the 
best she has ever been in her career.
The men’s team, on the other hand, has 
been up and down this year, as it is coming off 
a ﬁ  rst-place ﬁ  nish at FSU as well, but before 
that placed ninth at the Virginia Invitational 
— a low point of the year.
In addition, the Gators will be missing two 
key runners over the weekend.
Florida will be without redshirt seniors 
Elisabeth Bergh and Jack Guyton when they 
travel to College Station because they will 
both be on a travel-abroad trip for school.
Solinsky has often preached to his team 
that it needs to be aggressive and conﬁ  dent 
in situations like this. The Gators will get that 
chance come Saturday.

UF’s swimming and diving teams are on 
the road, again, against Missouri in their ﬁ  rst 
SEC matchup of the year. It’s Florida’s ﬁ  fth-
straight road meet before returning home.
The No. 10 women’s squad will face the 
No. 6 Tigers, while the No. 7 men will go up 
against No. 13 Missouri.
Friday’s meet begins at 10:30 a.m. at the 
Mizzou Aquatic Center.
Top-10 matchup for the women
While Florida and Missouri are SEC rivals, 
the two teams are only readying to face each 
other for the second time. Their ﬁ  rst meet oc-
curred during the 2013-14 season, when the 
Gators won 181-109 in Columbia, Missouri.
UF’s women’s team is led by the three-
headed attack of Sherridon Dressel, Talia 
Bates and Vanessa Pearl. All three athletes 
have won six events to start the season.
Ashley McCool continues to own the 1- 
and 3-meter events on the diving board. The 
junior has won seven-of-eight events so far 
this season and has taken home back-to-back 
SEC Women’s Diver of the Week awards.If the trio’s trend of winning continues, the 
Gators will have a much better chance of de-
feating their ﬁ  rst SEC opponent of the year.
Coach Jeff Poppell is excited about com-
peting against their ﬁ  rst SEC opponent.
“It should be a good test as to where we 
are as a team currently,” he said in a release.
Toughest test yet for the men
The men aren’t racing against a top-10 
team like the women, but Mizzou’s No. 13 
men’s team will present many challenges.
That’s why All-American swimmers Ki-
eran Smith and Clark Beach, along with SEC 
Freshman of the week Eric Friese, must con-
tinue their dominant starts to the season.
Each swimmer has earned multiple wins in 
every meet this year.
The men have yet to face an opponent as 
tough as Missouri, however.
Smith understands the challenge the Tigers 
present in the pool, but he believes the Gators 
can use the challenge as fuel.
Like the women, the men have only faced 
Missouri once. The men won 169-130 in the 
2013-2014 season.

Both teams have a com-
mon opponent — Iowa — 
and both won in comically 
stereotypical Big 10 fashion. 
But Michigan allowed three 
points against the Hawkeyes 
and won by seven, while 
Penn State allowed 12 and 
won by ﬁ  ve. 
The transitive property 
is scientiﬁ  cally proven to be 
an accurate way to compare 
teams, and due to that un-
ﬂ  inching law, Michigan will 
earn a big win Saturday.
— Tyler Nettuno
Penn State (-9.5) will win 
because…
There’s no other way to 
say it: I’d hate to be the team 
playing in Happy Valley on Saturday night.
Penn State’s “White Out” 
is one of the best college 
football traditions and you 
can’t convince me it isn’t an 
intimidation factor when a 
road team comes into Beaver 
Stadium literally greeted with 
a sea of white. 
That alone gives the Nit-
tany Lions the edge over Ick-
chigan.
The Lions have had a nice 
start to their season, going 6-0 
heading into this weekend’s 
matchup.
Quarterback Sean Clifford 
is second in the Big 10 with 
1,560 passing yards on the 
season, second to Michigan 
State’s Brian Lewerke (1,596 
yards). In six games, he has 
tallied 13 touchdowns and 
thrown only two intercep-
tions. 
And if we’re going the 
history route, it’s not really on Harbaugh’s side. The UM 
coach is only 1-9 against 
top-10 teams in his ﬁ  ve-year 
reign. He’s also 1-6 in games 
on the road against ranked 
teams. 
But PSU’s coach James 
Franklin isn’t getting off clean 
either. Franklin’s 1-3 against 
the Wolverines since Har-
baugh took over the program. 
The PSU coach’s sole win 
against UM came in 2017...at 
Beaver Stadium...in a White 
Out…
— Mari Faiello
Now onto the picks…
Tied for ﬁ  rst at 38-17 is 
Kyle “I Can’t Pick A Proﬁ  le 
Pic” Wood, who decided to 
change his Twitter proﬁ  le pic, 
again. Yes, that’s right. Go 
check it out, ladies. I guess 
Kyle didn’t think his Miami one was up to par, or may-
be he just felt like he had to 
show off the fact he covered 
a Gators game in Death Valley 
and got to go on the ﬁ  eld. We 
get it, Kyle. You’re cool. Now, 
pick a pic and stick with it. 
Also in ﬁ  rst is Tyler “I 
Will Die In My Jags Gear” 
Nettuno. Oh, Tyler. I applaud 
your devotion to your beloved 
Jaguars, but it’s a little dis-
tasteful to wear a Jags shirt in 
Louisiana when the Saints are 
playing. C’mon man, that’s 
just bad form. I mean, they 
did *checks notes* lose 13-6, 
so I guess it wasn’t too big of 
a deal at the end of the day. 
The Saints prevailed, so you 
were just the odd man out. 
Nothing new to see here.

TEM @ SMU (-7.5) SMU TEM TEMFlorida’s defense is 
also performing much 
better than the team that 
the Gamecocks hung 31 
points on at Ben Hill Grif-
ﬁ  n Stadium in 2018. UF is 
ranked top-ﬁ  ve in sacks 
per game, takeaways, in-
terceptions and opponent 
red zone touchdown per-
centage this year, all im-
provements from last sea-
son’s rankings.
Along with the of-
fensive and defensive 
upgrades are personnel 
changes. Instead of Ja-
chai Polite anchoring the 
defense and Franks lead-
ing the offense, Jonathan 
Greenard (who Mullen 
said is a gametime deci-
sion) and Trask took over 
those roles.
Trask did not play 
against the Gamecocks last 
season after he was hurt 
in practice following the 
Missouri game. Similarly, 
South Carolina is rolling 
out a new quarterback, or 
potentially quarterbacks, 
against the Gators. 
Ryan Hilinski took over 
for the injured Jake Bent-
ley but was hurt in the 
upset last week against 
Georgia. In his place, Da-
kereon Joyner ﬁ  lled in. 
When asked about going 
up against Joyner, Amari 
Burney compared him to 
Emory Jones and Kadarius 
Toney.
“He’s a little bit like KT, you know, a little, 
quick guy,” he said. “He 
can shake us, run the ball 
and things like that, do 
read options and things 
like that, just like Emory.”
These are two entirely 
different teams from when 
they last met playing for 
very different things at this 
point in the season. South 
Carolina has the potential 
to play spoiler against a 
top-10 team from the SEC 
East for the second week 
in a row. Florida can as-
sert its lead in the division 
if it takes what Mullen is 
billing as the biggest game 
of the season.
“Big challenge obvi-
ously this week, really the 
biggest game of the year 
for us right now,” he said. 
“You know, you can look 
coming in, the last two 
weeks, top-10 matchups, 
were big games but they 
weren’t against SEC East 
teams.”
This game was buried 
by some when discuss-
ing Florida’s four-game 
stretch including Auburn, 
LSU and Georgia, but after 
South Carolina downed 
Georgia, it proved this is 
not a game that can be 
overlooked.
