� THE UNIVERSITY FEE COMMITTEE RECOMMENDED  
RAISING FEES BY $5.79 PER CREDIT HOUR.
By KATHERINE BEIN
Alligator Writer
The University Fee Committee decided unanimously Friday 
to recommend the UF Board of Trustees raise overall undergrad-
uate tuition costs by $5.79 per credit hour, starting in August.
The decision comes almost a week after Gov. Charlie Crist 
signed legislation allowing Florida universities a one-time op-portunity to raise student fees more than the usual 5 percent. 
On Tuesday, the committee accepted three new fees totaling 
$2.80, on top of the $1.15, or 5 percent, fee hike 
approved in December.
The allocation of a potential $1.84 fee was 
put off until Friday. This fourth new fee was initially proposed to be used to fund 40 percent of the graduate student health care program, GatorGradCare.
Student Body President Ashton Charles 
said it made her uneasy to have undergradu-
ates pay for health coverage they would not receive.
“It’s a bad precedent to set,” she said. “[The money] could be 
tailored to services all the students could use.”
Though the committee acknowledged GatorGradCare is im-
portant for attracting good graduate students to UF, members agreed it is not fair to burden undergraduates with fees they Tuition fees

Amid renewed controversy sur-
rounding Israel’s seizure of an in-
ternational aid boat headed to Gaza, 
about 50 people demonstrated at the corner of Southwest 34th Street and Williston Road, calling for the U.S. government to take a stand against 
Israel’s actions.
Protesters gathered at the north-
west corner of the intersection and 
lined Southwest 34th Street with 
signs that read, “Building supply 
= contraband,” “End the blockade now,” and “Free Gaza.”
Organized by the Gainesville 
chapter of the International Social-ist Organization, the demonstrators stood at the intersection from 4 p.m. to about 5 p.m. and then walked down Southwest 34th Street to the 
Gainesville office of Florida Rep-resentative Cliff Stearns, chanting 
all the way.

A large water pipe burst Saturday evening, 
flooding the intersection of Southwest 10th 
Street and Southwest Fifth Avenue for about 
two hours.
The pipe, which runs under Southwest 10th 
Street, burst around 7 p.m., causing water pres-sure for the surrounding area to drop severely, according to Tony Cunningham, senior envi-ronmental engineer with Gainesville Regional Utilities.
Officers from the Gainesville Police Depart-
ment quickly blocked off the flooded street and intersection, which remains blocked off while the pipe is repaired, Cunningham said.
“It looked like the street was erupting with 
like, white water rapids,” said Brian Greenfield, 22, who was on his way home nearby when he saw the flooded street. “It was just spewing out with water and spreading everywhere.”
GRU employees were able to turn off the 
feeding valve to the broken main and isolate it, 
which stopped the flooding, he said.
According to Cunningham, GRU worked 
quickly to restore water utilities to those affect-
ed. Most residents were back on track by Sun-day morning. By Monday, everyone’s utilities had been restored.
Cunningham said GRU continues to run wa-
ter quality analysis tests and can assure residents that their water is safe to drink.
Although Cunningham could not say for 
sure when the intersection will reopen for traf-fic, he said GRU will be working on repairing the broken main into the next week. 
“We don’t know exactly because we’re get-
ting the parts to repair it,” he said, “and deter-mining the best solutions for repair.”Pipe, road repairs not done

CLARIFICATION
During the June 1 Student Sen-
ate meeting, the Unite Party pro-
posed an amendment to the Sat-
ellite Campus Voter Participation Act. The amendment would not require the  Supervisor of Elections to send an e-mail to every student telling them where to find the bal-lot online, as required in the origi-nal version of the bill.The amendment passed with 
a vote of 50 to 18.
Student Alliance party Senate 
Leader Jonathan Ossip and other members of the party said the amendment made the bill less effective and seem “watered-down.” 
He said the Gator Times does 
not send out a link to the absen-tee ballot and most students are 
unaware of it because the SG 
website is difficult to navigate.

The Santa Fe College Teaching 
Zoo flooded visitors with conserva-
tion tips to celebrate World Oceans Day over the weekend.
This year, in light of the recent oil 
spill in the Gulf of Mexico, the zoo provided information about the spill and about the Association of Zoos and Aquariums. The organization is working with the zoo to help animals affected by the spill by rehabilitating them and releasing them back into the wild. 
About 200 attended both days 
of the event, which was intended to help educate people on how their daily activities affect the oceans, said Tarah Jacobs, the event coordinator and a conservation education special-ist at Santa Fe.
The event, which is in its third 
year, featured coloring, an arts and crafts table with seafood origami, 
and a children’s sea turtle researcher 
game.
World Oceans Day, which is to-
day, was recognized by the United Nations in June 2008.
Jacobs said there are simple things 
people can do to help with the ocean’s ecosystem like shutting off the water 
while brushing your 
teeth or choosing your 
area’s most sustain-able seafood items at 
restaurants because most seafood is over-fished.
The zoo’s conservation efforts in-
cluded ocean facts posted around the zoo and information packets based on Seafood Watch, a seafood advi-
sory list.
Kristen Reecer, Santa Fe zoology 
technology student and an event vol-
unteer, said she hopes that what peo-ple learn at the event, they’ll share with others, which will bring more awareness to the issue.Zoo holds Oceans Day

With costs rising for city services, churches 
and nonprofit organizations will soon have to 
pay a fire service fee.
The special assessment fee for fire services, 
which was adopted by the Gainesville City Commission on Thursday, was created to bal-ance shortages in Gainesville’s budget for next year.
The notifications about the fee should be re-
ceived via mail by June 24. All property own-ers, residential homes and business offices are included in the assessment, and no properties 
are exempt.
The fee won’t be the same for every build-
ing. The City Commission has proposed to es-
tablish the amounts based on factors such as the building’s hazard class, which is dictated 
by what the building is made of, the rate of 
flame spread and occupancy.
As of now, the City Commission has not set 
exact rates. 
Gene Prince, interim fire chief for  
Gainesville Fire Rescue, said 14 percent of the city’s budget is for the fire department, and the department’s availability, demand and in-
cident reports are used to determine the costs of operating and the level of service for the community. He said the fee is a stable funding method because the charges won’t fluctuate like other taxes.
Kent Vann, executive director at the St. 
Francis House said this is another financial burden placed on nonprofit organizations. But he said he understands the fee may be needed as an effort to save other services.
“I don’t think the City Commission realizes 
how insulting this is to volunteers,” said Jas-mine Nebhrajani, a UF political science senior. “Charging charities and nonprofit buildings just isn’t right.”
The final meeting for the City Commission 
fire service special assessment will occur July 15.City adopts fire service fee

realizes how insulting this is to

CITY MEETINGS SINCE LAST YEAR.

Praying won’t get you a free meal if 
you’re the 131st person in line at the St. 
Francis House.
The Gainesville ordinance, which 
caps the number of free meals at home-
less shelters, was criticized again by res-idents  at Thursday’s City Commission 
meeting.  
The city threatened on April 2, 2009, 
to shut down the St. Francis House, a 
homeless shelter and soup kitchen in 
downtown Gainesville, if it did not begin 
complying with the city code’s section concerning soup kitchens, which limits the number of daily meals to 130. This made social workers and local church 
members question the reasoning behind 
the strict enforcement of the ordinance.
Miriam Elliott, who used to work at 
St. Francis, said she was saddened by the 
city forcing the shelter to lock its doors 
while it still has food to serve.  
Assistant City Manager Fred Murry 
listed the Supplemental Nutrition As-sistance Program, formerly known as the Food Stamp Program, the Salvation Army and Arbor House, a facility for homeless, pregnant women, as potential 
options for those who are turned away 
from food by the 130-meal limit.
Elliott, who now works at Arbor 
House, said the Arbor House is not open to the public and does not give out 
meals. The house’s residents, who are 
single mothers and pregnant women, use food stamps. 
She also said the Salvation Army be-
gins service at 4:30 p.m. while the meals at St. Francis are served at noon, which would make one wait for more than four hours to be fed.    
The issue of meal limits 
have been debated since early 2009 when the city began enforcing the 1993 
city code amendment, which limits the 
number of daily meals a shelter could 
provide, restricts certain areas from providing meals or shelter and caps the number of people who could stay the night at a shelter, according to the  com-
mission meeting’s agenda. 
The City Commission approved a pe-
tition on Feb. 18 to lift the meal limit on 
Thanksgiving Day, Christmas Day and 
one additional day to be determined by 
the shelter.130-meal limit criticized
THE ASSOCIATED PRESS
WASHINGTON (AP) — Presi-
dent Barack Obama said Monday 
he’s been talking closely to Gulf Coast fishermen and various experts on BP’s catastrophic oil spill not for 
lofty academic reasons but “so I 
know whose ass to kick.”
The salty words, part of Obama’s 
recent efforts to telegraph to Ameri-cans his engagement with the crisis, came in an interview in Michigan with NBC’s “Today” show.
He strongly defended his role in 
dealing with the crisis that began 
with the April 20 explosion on a BP-
leased oil rig in the Gulf.  “I was down there a month ago 
before most of these talking heads were even paying attention to the Gulf,” Obama told NBC’s Matt Lau-er. “I was meeting with fishermen in 
the rain talking about what a poten-
tial crisis this could be.”
Some have criticized the presi-
dent for not engaging passionately enough on the spill, even though he’s been to the Gulf coast three times since the disaster, his most re-cent visit on Friday. Obama said he has talked to a variety of “experts” 
on the oil spill besides fishermen.
“I talk to these folks because they 
potentially have the best answers — 
so I know whose ass to kick,” the president said.
NBC aired a portion of the in-
terview on Monday evening in ad-vance of Tuesday’s “Today” show.
Obama also launched a salvo 
at Tony Hayward, BP’s CEO, over some of his comments, including saying at one point that “I want my life back” and that the Gulf was “a big ocean” and that “the environ-mental impact of this disaster is like-ly to be very, very modest.”
“He wouldn’t be working for 
me after any of those statements,” 
Obama said, according to excerpts 
released by NBC.
Earlier, Obama sought to reas-
sure the nation that the Gulf Coast would “bounce back” from the worst oil spill in the nation’s history, but not without time, effort and re-imbursement from BP.
Surrounded by Cabinet mem-
bers, Obama said that not only is he confident that the crisis will pass but also that the affected area “comes back even stronger than ever.”
The president and top federal 
officials were briefed on the gov-ernment’s battle against the spill by Coast Guard Adm. Thad Allen, who 
is overseeing the government’s ef-
forts in dealing with the tragedy.
Allen earlier Monday said a cap 
on the damaged oil well is now keep-ing up to 462,000 gallons of oil a day from leaking into the Gulf. That’s up from about 441,000 gallons on Satur-day and about 250,000 on Friday. BP in a statement put the amount being 
captured at 466,200 gallons. Allen 
said the government was using its own flow-rate calculations and not relying on those from BP.

UF students and faculty mem-
bers received emergency text 
messages and e-mails early May 31 warning of a crime that oc-curred in the pedestrian tunnel under 13th Street.
There was just one problem; 
the robbery likely did not hap-pen, according to UPD Capt. Jeff Holcomb.
Brett House, a 19-year-old 
Gainesville resident, called the University Police Department at 8 a.m. on May 31, accord-ing to UPD Lt. Alton McDilda. House reported that he had been robbed.Holcomb said House told 
police that at 3 a.m. someone hit him from behind and stole about $45 worth of marijuana from his backpack.
Later during questioning, 
House admitted to making up the crime, blaming it on his narcotics 
use, Holcomb said.
“He didn’t remember report-
ing the crime to us,” he said.
UPD will file a complaint with 
the State Attorney’s Office against House for filing a false police re-
port, Holcomb said Thursday. 
The complaint can turn into a criminal charge. House did not answer repeated phone calls.UF tunnel robbery

TALLAHASSEE — After a 
wait of more than five weeks, 
lawmakers finally sent Gov. Charlie Crist the most conten-tious bill of the 2010 legislative 
session on Monday.
Lawmakers passed a health 
care bill on April 30 containing 
some last-minute amendments that would require women seek-ing an abortion during the first tri-mester to undergo an ultrasound exam and pay for it. Estimates on the cost of an ultrasound varied 
from a few hundred dollars to 
about $1,500.
The amendments tacked onto 
the otherwise non-controversial measure would require women to view the live ultrasound im-age or have it described by a doc-tor unless they could prove they were victims of rape, incest or 
domestic violence.That language and the way 
the Republican-led Legislature pushed it through in the final 
hours of the session created heartburn for Crist, who has al-ready used his veto pen several times this spring.
Crist, who has until June 22 to 
decide whether to veto the bill, 
has previously said on sev-
eral occasions 
that he was troubled by the anti-abor-
tion language added in the final hours of the session 
without going through any com-
mittee hearings.
“Gov. Crist has concerns 
about House Bill 1143 and will 
fully consider it now that it has reached his desk,” press secretary Sterling Ivey said Monday.House Republicans said Mon-
day the bill provides women an 
opportunity to make an informed 
choice. The delay by the House before sending the measure did result in more calls and letters be-ing sent to the governor’s office in support of the bill. Of more than 39,000 messages, letters or calls directed to Crist, roughly 60 per-cent were in support, his office 
reported Monday.
The bill also extends a state 
and federal policy prohibiting tax 
dollars from being used to pay for elective abortions. 
Crist’s vetoes and decision 
in April to leave the Republican Party to pursue his bid for the U.S. Senate without party affilia-
tion has made him a virtual out-
cast in most GOP circles.
The state Constitution says 
the Legislature can forward legis-lation to the governor on a “prac-ticable” timetable.Crist receives abortion bill

178 TOTAL VOTES47% YES53% NOThursday’s question: Should grad students pay for their own health care?Today’s question: Should bars be held responsible for underage drinkers?Cheating in class is easy, unacceptable
By now you’re probably in “lazy-days-of-summer” 
mode. Staying up late doing nothing productive. Sleeping in. Wanting to lay out by the pool. Think-
ing and moving in slow-motion.
Convincing yourself to walk to class may take some se-
rious persuasion because it feels like you’re in a convection oven out there, and you need a bath by the time you get 
to class. Or if you’re taking one of some 200 online classes 
this summer, you have to motivate yourself to power on the computer and make it to WebCT, resisting the beckon-ing of Facebook, Twitter, and e-mails.
Lazy, lazy, lazy. That is how summer can feel.  You 
may be tempted to cut corners with your classes so you can minimize work time and maximize play time. 
So, in the midst of Summer A finals, exams and proj-
ects, when you feel farthest away from the motivated, 
focused version of yourself, I want to remind you not to 
compromise your work ethic. Not to cheat.
You may be rolling your eyes right now. You may not 
care or want to care about it. You may think you won’t get caught, or that everyone cheats. But I, and many other 
students, earn my grades.  Summer or not summer, this is 
your degree you’re working toward. Your name will go on that diploma. And you will use it to get a job.
It pains me to see friends and classmates lying to 
themselves and their professors when they cheat — and online classes make it easier than ever. With no teacher click-clacking down the aisle to look over your shoulder or separate you a few desks away from your neighbors, cheating on online assignments and quizzes goes unmoni-
tored. It is out of your professors’ control and completely 
in yours. You are trusted to complete the tasks alone, but who would catch you if you got help from a classmate or a friend or an online resource?  
An athlete who cheats his or 
her way through practices will 
not perform as well in games; in 
the same way, if you cut corners in classes, you might not 
perform as well in your jobs. If you cheat while you’re on a diet, you’re not going to reach your health goals. Estab-
lishing a work ethic is work, and summer is the toughest 
time to keep it together and persevere. So here’s a little voice of encouragement: You can do it yourself.
I think the true test with online classes today is one of 
integrity. Can you resist the temptation and convenience 
of cheating? You may downplay the downfalls of cheating 
because you may be used to it, immune to it or even com-fortable with it. But I’d rather the world be full of honest people than “successful” people. Hard-working people 
who aren’t afraid to try hard, play fair and get what they 
earned are much more admirable than lazy people who lower their ethical standards for the sake of convenience and “success.”
It’s a bold move to decline a tempting invitation to col-
laborate on an individual assignment. A bold, smart, ad-mirable move.
If only we would be more caught up in being good and 
honest than on looking good on our transcripts.  If only 
we could be truer to ourselves and our studies, and to our 
teachers and classmates.
Just because it’s the lazy days of summer doesn’t mean 
you don’t have to take your classes seriously. Lock your-self in the lovely air conditioning of the library, and ham-
mer out the best work you can — by yourself. You can still 
find time for poolside margaritas with your friends.
Kathryn Stolarz is a journalism senior.FAU firestorm
Florida Atlantic Univer-
sity’s first step to toning down its  student news-
paper, University Press, was to fire long-time adviser and former editor-in-chief of the Alligator Michael Koretzky on May 18.
The reasoning behind Ko-
retzky’s firing is still unclear — FAU claims it wanted him out of the part-time advis-ing position so the univer-sity could hire a full-time em-
ployee to help the students 
at the paper. However, the university also said Koretzky was not allowed to stay on as an unpaid volunteer because FAU policy requires advisers of student groups to be uni-versity employees.
FAU has refused to com-
ment on the issue or detail what the punishment would be if students met with Ko-retzky against the school’s wishes.We are nothing short of 
disgusted over how FAU is handling this situation. It is effectively censoring its stu-dent newspaper and enforc-ing its rule through threats of disciplinary action. Some-times we forget how lucky we are to work at an indepen-dent paper because things like this still go on at student papers across the nation.
We are glad to see Kore-
tzky is still meeting with stu-
dent writers against FAU’s 
wishes. But we would be hap-pier if FAU would acknowl-edge its mistake, apologize and consider changing its  policy for non-employees.  
Anyone who volunteers 
to assist students in their area of study should be able to do so  as long as he or she is qualified. Someone with about 20 years of journalism experience sounds qualified enough to us.for drinking violations
Whenever we go to Midtown we have to wade through a seemingly endless amount of 18- to 20-year-olds. They edge in front of us at the bar 
only to stare blankly at the bartender before ordering a “ro-man coke” or whatever it is that grown-ups drink. They look so innocent trying to tape together a discarded wristband they found behind a Dumpster, and it’s hilarious every time we see a 19-year-old girl drunkenly crying behind Balls.
But seriously, when are they going to stop ruining the fun 
for the rest of us? The Swamp, 101 Cantina and Rum Runners are all facing some serious legal trouble because of underage antics. It’s not even really their fault. The police said most of the infractions come from people using their friends’ IDs or having someone else get them drinks once inside. How can the city honestly expect bars to know every time they are be-ing lied to by an underage patron?
We have a new solution. Instead of punishing the bars for 
being duped, why not punish the kids? Yeah, they already get in a little bit of trouble for drinking underage, but obvi-
ously it is not enough. If someone gets caught drinking un-
derage, he or she should be slammed with a huge fine and banned from entering another bar until he or she is 21. Then the cops can hit repeat offenders with a trespassing charge.
It’s hard enough to do business in this economy, and this 
ordinance is only making it harder for bars to operate in the black, so if the city really wants to crack down on underage drinking it should think about implementing a one-strike policy on underage drinkers instead of hurting local busi-ness.Bar blues

Letters to the Editor
Fee increases strain students.
I have one question to the administration, 
Student Government and anyone in favor of 
the 25 percent hike in fees: Are you crazy? I mean are you that out of touch with reality that you would endorse such an irresponsible 
hike in one sitting? These tough economic 
times call for every American, Floridian and UF student to cut back, tighten their belts and use common sense when it comes tuition in-creases. I know this is a new concept for many in the upper echelon of the university, but it’s called fiscal responsibility. We should be cut-ting back and limiting non-educational servic-es, not expanding them at the costly expense 
of Joe and Jane Student. People could argue 
that progress comes at a cost. I push back by saying that there is nothing wrong with de-layed, systematic progress. University officials need to stop, think and then spend instead of this reckless attitude that seems to get worse with every passing school year.
The most disturbing fee proposed is the one 
that would require undergraduates to pay 40 
percent of graduate students’ health care. I had 
to read that part of the Alligator article twice to make sure I wasn’t seeing things that weren’t there. Our fearless leader Machen gives no public explanation as to why he feels this is appropriate. News flash, President Machen: It’s not appropriate. Even as a potential gradu-ate student I feel that this fee is inappropriate and wrong on so many levels. It should not be 
passed. I have to wonder if Machen reads the 
things he approves before they become public because they make no sense. Either offer health care to all students who pay for it or don’t, but do not make undergraduates pay for a portion of graduate students’ health care.
I am all for making our university the ab-
solute best, but I am not for doing so while breaking the financial backs of our students and their families, or putting college out of reach for your average middle-class family.

Gulf oil spill is a call to action.
Attention Congress,The continuing tragedy in the Gulf of Mex-
ico only underscores what we have known for decades — that all life must reach balance with the Earth and with all other life. Life on this 
planet is completely interdependent. Carbon 
cycles to and fro, passing through all life forms and returning to them as the cycle continues.
We must learn to live sustainably on this 
planet, utilizing the best technologies that our collective minds can conjure and employ.
Congress and the president must act now 
to pass robust transformative energy reform legislation in 2010 to promote a swift transi-
tion to renewable, clean, sustainable forms of 
energy and their more efficient use. This is the change needed to revitalize America and the world. This is the legislation America needs to invigorate our economy. This is the most robust action we can take to improve our na-
tional security. This is the policy that will in-
spire, educate and employ the next generation of scientists. This is the action urgently needed to protect our fragile and rapidly dwindling natural world. We must act now and strike while the iron is hot.

Alligator overlooks mental health fee.
I wanted to comment on the new fees and 
on the Alligator’s commentary on them.  First, let’s look at the mental health program fee the Alligator failed to comment on: “But until evaluations of UF’s mental health care finish, 
the money is given to SG.” What?!  The Alliga-
tor accepts this?!  “We want to use this money for mental health later, but for now, let’s go ahead and collect the money and throw it at SG. It’ll be fun!” 
If the administration wants a fee to support 
a mental health program that doesn’t yet ex-ist, then it should either delay the fee until the program exists or save the money that is col-
lected from the fee now to support the mental 
health program later.  Just giving the money to SG doesn’t make sense.
Now let’s talk about undergrads supporting 
graduate health care. Actually, despite being a former graduate assistant and GAU member, I agree with Ashton Charles and other under-graduates that the undergrads shouldn’t have to pay for grad students’ health care.  On the other hand, I think the 60-cent per credit hour fee that will keep grad students’ overall fees down is a great idea — undergrads won’t feel that too much, and it will lift a substantial weight from grad students’ shoulders.
I also want to correct some misconceptions 
of the editorial board.  You assert that poten-tial graduate students choose UF because it will further their careers and not because of financial concerns during grad school. This is not true. The funding you get in grad school is a huge determinant your school decision. If a highly qualified graduate student is being courted by UF and another school that is of-fering a similar salary, the free health care here 
could convince that student to attend UF.  Did 
you ask any grad students why they chose UF before writing?
Another misconception: the purpose of free 
health care is not to lure in more grad students, but rather to increase the quality of students recruited. The administration’s argument is not that supporting health care this way will lead to more sections being offered. Rather, 
it will lead to the sections that are already of-
fered being taught by higher quality teachers.  I think that this is a serious assumption on the administration’s part. Being a good researcher does not mean you’re a good teacher.  I just-want the Alligator to understand the position it’s arguing against.

Fellow Gators,
I know you all have heard so much about how im-
portant it is to fill out the 2010 Census, but this is the 
final stretch.
Participation in the census is crucial for college and uni-
versity students around the state who have been tradition-
ally underrepresented in the past. Standing up for the count is our best way to impact the amount of funding our school 
and community receives. We must ensure students here are 
counted in Gainesville in order to obtain the federal funds our college community is eligible to receive. Although you may still receive support from your parents or consider their house your permanent address, this is the community where 
you live and sleep most of the year, and where you should be counted.
With this data collected only every 10 years, it is impor-
tant a complete count of the student population is obtained in 
order to properly plan for future 
growth, including college tuition 
and grant and loan programs. In 
addition, the census can help our 
school receive funding for important research done by faculty, 
students, librarians and community leaders. Census data also 
determine funding for critical community resources such as transportation, public safety, medical care and road repairs.
Students who live off campus received their forms last se-
mester while those living in group quarters on campus were 
counted through May. Soon you may receive a knock on your door from an enumerator if you did not return your form. If 
so, please take 10 minutes to fill out the form with the official 
census taker. These professionals will not ask to enter your 
home and will only ask you the 10 short questions.
Fellow Gators, if you filled out and returned your census 
form, thank you. If you didn’t, don’t worry. Helpful census takers will visit throughout the summer to ensure that you are counted. 
Just a few minutes of your time will help strengthen our 
generation’s voice. It’s up to all of us to stand up and be counted.
Best Regards and GO GATORS,

Speaking Outcould not be ignored.
“We think the occupation and blockade 
of Gaza is just inhumane, an injustice to 
human decency,” Cenker said.
Tattersall said the plan was to give 
Stearns hundreds of hand-signed letters that called for him to make an official an-nouncement against the act.
“They’re trying to starve the people 
out,” Tattersall said. “We’d like to see him 
openly denounce the attack.”
The protesters were met outside Stearns’ 
office by his district aid Jene Plough, who told them Stearns was not available for comment. 
Plough promised, however, to take the 
letters to Stearns, as well as listen to their demands and forward them to the con-
gressman. 
Plough said Stearns’ official statement 
on the subject could be available via his 
press secretary in Washington, D.C., Paul 
Flusche.
Flusche was not available for comment 
by press time. 
Muhammad Rushdi, a graduate stu-
dent in computer science at UF, brought his daughters with him on Monday.
He came to protest because he thinks 
the situation represents is a double stan-dard in foreign policy.
“Israel has broken international law in 
what they’ve done,” he said. “We claim to be neutral, but we’re supporting those 
who support the blockade. This is a big problem.”8, ALLIGATOR � TUESDAY, JUNE 8, 2010

PROTEST , from page 1�THE LAW TAKES EFFECT SEPT. 1.
By ANDREW PANTAZI
Alligator Writer
The Florida Legislature is kicking bicycles to the curb.
A new bill signed by Gov. Charlie Crist on Friday will force 
cyclists to ride in bike lanes if one is available after Sept. 1.
A section of the 81-page bill will amend the current law, 
which states bikes must ride as close to the edge of the road as 
practical, to say that if a bike lane is present then cyclists must 
stay in the bike lane.
Bicycle advocacy groups, such as Florida Bicycle Associa-
tion and Green Mobile Network, opposed the bill because it takes power away from cyclists.
The bill contains exceptions to the law. For example, if an 
animal runs in front of a cyclist, then the person can swerve out of the way.
The executive director of Florida Bicycle Association, Laura Hallam, said she thinks the bill will hurt bike safety.
“What’s going to happen is it’s just going to make things so 
much more confusing over whether a bicyclist is in the right place,” she said. “Whereas, it would be much better for bicy-clists to make their own judgment on where the safest place on the roadways is.”
Tui Popenoe, a computer science and business administra-
tion junior who works at the Student Govern-ment Bike Repair, said the bill makes a reason-able request.
“If the bike lane is there, then bikes should 
ride in it,” he said. “If it’s not there, then the law 
doesn’t change anything.”
The main problem with the new law, said Gainesville law-
yer Cherie Fine, is too much is left up to interpretation. She said she hopes Gainesville will interpret the law to mean that cy-clists should ride in bike lanes only if it’s safe to do so.
One problem that can arise, she said, is if courts use the law 
as an excuse to give tickets to cyclists. She fears that “this could make cyclists second-class citizens.”There are different types of cyclists, according to Dekova 
Batey, the program coordinator for the City of Gainesville’s Bi-
cycle/Pedestrian Program. For more relaxed cyclists, using a 
sidewalk is more appropriate since they don’t need the speed of the road. However, for people who commute by bicycle, they are more likely to need the speed of a bike lane.
Cyclists on the road should operate like motor vehicles, 
while cyclists on sidewalks should operate like pedestrians, he said.
Another portion of the bill, which Hallam said Mothers 
Against Drunk Driving supports, changes driving under the 
influence restrictions.
Previously, people receiving a fourth DUI conviction would 
permanently lose their licenses. Under the bill, they can regain 
their license by connecting their cars’ ignitions to alcohol-test-ing devices.
The bill is a better alternative to making sure drunk driv-
ers aren’t driving without a license, Hallam said. This option makes sure the government is tracking drivers with a history of driving under the influence, she said.Law orders cyclists stick to bike lanes when possible
would not directly benefit from.
The committee decided the 
additional $1.84 fee should be 
adopted and split up to be used 
for all students’ interests. It will recommend that $1.20 go toward student activities and services, 
and the remaining 64 cents be 
spent on the university’s health department.
Organizations and groups 
on campus who want funding can make their arguments to student government in the com-
ing months.
Committee members said 
that raising fees by $5.79 per 
credit hour is necessary for UF 
to remain a credible academic 
institution. Currently, UF’s tu-ition rates are below average for the state. To ignore this one-time chance to raise student fees 
would put UF at a disadvantage 
to other schools in the state, committee members said.
T.J. Villamil, UF undergradu-
ate student and committee chair-man, said the money is badly needed all around campus.
“Every year when this fee 
committee meets they’re ... nick-
el and diming, they’re strained,” 
he said. “It’s a shame as the flag-ship university of this state to be so behind. It was a landmark 
[decision] because it was a one-
time thing.”Committee

� THE SHOOTER COMMITTED 
SUICIDE AFTER THE ATTACK.
THE ASSOCIATED PRESS
HIALEAH — A gunman shot and killed 
his wife outside a South Florida restaurant 
where she worked, then targeted women 
inside and killed three others before com-mitting suicide, police said Monday.
Police said 38-year-old Gerardo Regala-
do bypassed at least two men when he fired 
at the women inside. Three women were 
hospitalized in critical condition, Hialeah police Detective Eddie Rodriguez said.
“He went straight for the women,” Ro-
driguez said.
Regalado is the half brother of former 
baseball star Orlando “El Duque” Hernan-dez.
The shooting began Sunday night in a 
parking lot outside the Yoyito Restaurant 
in Hialeah, where Regalado of Coral Ga-
bles was seen arguing with Liazan Molina, Rodriguez said. According to Florida mar-riage records, the couple married in 2007.
According to police, Regalado shot and 
killed Molina, 24, then entered the restau-rant and fired on six women inside.
One employee called her brother after the shooting, saying she had been shot and was bleeding.
Felix Fuentes said his sister, Ivet Coro-
nado, told him to “please call 911.” He said the 36-year-old woman was recovering Monday from surgery for gunshot wounds to her chest and one of her arms.
Regalado drove off after the shooting, 
police said. Officers found him dead of an apparent suicide a few blocks away, with the same weapon used in the restaurant shootings, Rodriguez said.
People inside the Coral Gables house 
where Regalado and Molina lived refused to answer a reporter’s knocks at the door. 
A person who answered the phone iden-
tified himself only as a family friend and 
said the family didn’t want to talk.
Hernandez’s agent, Mike Maulini, told 
the Spanish-language newspaper El Nuevo 
Herald that the family does not know what 
caused Regalado to shoot seven women.
“This has taken everyone by surprise,” 
Maulini said.
Regalado came to Miami from Cuba in 
2006, he said.
“We do not know what might have hap-
pened. He was a good kid. Since he arrived he has tried not to depend on his brother and do his own work,” Maulini.
In a statement, Hernandez’s family of-fered condolences to the families of the seven women. “It is with great pain that we reach out to everyone affected and of-
fer our prayers in this time of sorrow,” the 
statement said.
It was not immediately clear if all the 
women shot were restaurant employees or customers. The shooting began shortly af-
ter the restaurant had closed.
A series of 911 calls released by police 
record breathless Spanish-language call-
ers urging dispatchers to send ambulances Sunday night.
“Hurry! Hurry!” said one terrified 
woman in Spanish to the dispatcher. “That 
man killed them.”
A male caller in Spanish is 
heard on another recording at 10:11 p.m. breathing rapidly 
and telling the dispatcher, 
“He entered the Yoyito Restaurant and be-gan shooting like crazy.”
He tells the dispatcher that the man and 
a woman had argued before the shooting started.
“They were arguing out in front of the 
restaurant ... he killed the girl,” the man says.
A spokeswoman for Jackson Memorial 
Hospital declined to release any informa-
tion about the three women being treated there because all had requested privacy. 
No contact information for one survivor, Yasmine Dominguez, could be found. 
There was no answer at the Hialeah Gar-
dens mobile home of the third, 55-year-old Mayra Delacaridad.
No working phone number could be 
found for Molina’s relatives in the Miami 
area. At the Hialeah home of 56-year-old 
Zaida Castillo, a relative said her family did not want to speak with reporters.
Two other victims, 32-year-old Maysel 
Figueroa and 47-year-old Lavina Fonseca, 
lived next door to each other in Hialeah. 
People inside Fonseca’s home refused 
to answer the door, and a neighbor said 
Figueroa had lived in her small cottage for 
only about six months.
Regular customers in the city, which 
has a large Cuban-American population, 
gathered in shock outside the restaurant 
on Monday.
“They are good people,” said Valentin 
Perez, 52, who visits the restaurant for his Cuban coffee every morning.
Octavio Guzman, another customer, 
said the restaurant workers are always gen-erous with those who can’t afford a meal.
“You tell anyone here, ‘I’m hungry and 
I don’t have money,’ and they give it to 
you,” Guzman said.South Florida gunman kills wife, three other women

POLL QUESTION UF BASEBALL TEEING OFF WITH TOM GREENThomas Plevik / Alligator Staff
UF sophomore Tyler Thompson hit three home runs with six RBIs to eliminate FAU on Sunday and lead the Gators to 
the NCAA Super Regional. He came into the game with just two round-trippers on the season.

TEXAS A&M THIS WEEKEND.

An unlikely bat rose to the occasion and hit the Gators 
into the next round of postseason play.
Sophomore Tyler Thompson, who leads the team with 
49 strikeouts and has struggled to provide productive at-
bats, has been stuck at the bottom of the order all year. 
But on Sunday he showed why coach Kevin O’Sullivan 
has stuck with him through the tough times.
The left fielder became the first Gator in postseason his-
tory to drill three homers in a game. He racked up six RBIs 
along the way to power No. 4 Florida (45-15) past FAU 15-0 
and into the NCAA Super Regional. UF outscored its op-
ponents 32-5 in the Gainesville Regional.
The Gators will take on the winner of today’s 1 p.m. Cor-
al Gables Regional final between Miami and Texas A&M, 
which was delayed Monday night due to weather.
“I feel really good about this team at this point,” 
O’Sullivan said. “I think we’re clicking. We are playing re-
ally good defense and are pitching well, while getting pro-duction from up and down the lineup.”
Thompson got it started in the second inning with an RBI 
double down the right-field line to drive in freshman Mike 
Zunino and give the Gators an early 1-0 advantage.
He then followed up back-to-back round trippers from 
Brian Johnson and Zunino in the third with his first of the 
night as he crushed a ball over the scoreboard in right field UF advances to 
super regionals
The old adage is proving to be true 
– be careful what you wish for.
College football fans from all 
across the country have been pushing 
for the termination of the BCS in order 
to implement a playoff system.
Well, there seems to be some change 
on the horizon, just not the type every-body expected.
Conference expansion is causing 
shock waves all around the nation. But 
people aren’t realizing that it would 
not only transform the sport, it could 
also go a long way in accomplishing the change we have been asking for – 
the institution of a playoff.
If the Pacific-10 Conference does 
end up becoming the Pac-16 by adding 
Texas, Texas A&M, Texas Tech, Okla-
homa, Oklahoma State and Colorado, this will force the hand of the 
other conferenc-
es to move in the 
same direction.
The Big Ten 
has already reached out and 
offered  Nebras-
ka and Missouri 
spots in its con-
ference.
This leaves the Southeastern Con-
ference, the Big 12, the Big East and the 
Atlantic Coast Conference with some 
decisions.
In the end, the SEC will have to make 
some moves if it wants to maintain its Expansion could bring playoffUF SOFTBALL

OKLAHOMA CITY – After his team’s 
16-3 loss to UCLA on the first day of the 
Women’s College World Series, UF coach 
Tim Walton said rebounding to win a na-tional championship would be “next to im-possible.”
Evidently, he knew what he was talk-
ing about – but at least his team went down swinging. 
Just a few hours after valiantly staving 
off elimination with a 5-0 victory over No. 9 
Missouri (51-13), No. 4 Florida’s (49-10) sea-
son officially came to a close Saturday with  a 3-2 loss to No. 6 Georgia (50-12).
With the Bulldogs holding a 3-2 lead in 
the top of the sixth, the Gators put runners on second and third with just one out, only to follow with five consecutive swinging strikeouts to end the game and the season. 
“The pitcher that came in was throwing a really good game and we just didn’t make 
the adjustments that we should’ve made,” 
senior Corrie Brooks said. “I don’t think we really communicated well with each other, like the first person striking out going to the next person.”
These late-inning shortcomings over-
shadowed the heroic efforts of junior Stephanie Brom-bacher and freshman Brit-
tany Schutte, who fought 
their hardest to keep UF’s 
season alive. 
Brombacher had a stel-
lar bounceback perfor-mance, allowing just three runs on the day despite 
throwing 13 innings and 182 pitches in the sweltering Oklahoma City heat. 
“I thought Stephanie really showed a lot 
of heart today,” Walton said. “She went out there and gutted it out through 13 innings Gators ousted from WCWS

NEW YORK — The wait is over. 
Mike Stanton is joining the Florida 
Marlins.
The highly-touted slugger will 
make his major league debut to-night in Philadelphia, part of a ros-ter shakeup designed to spark the slumping Marlins.“He’s a great talent and he’s 
going to be a big addition to our lineup,” outfielder Cody Ross said after Sunday’s 7-6 loss at the New York Mets. “It’s going to be fun to watch him play finally.”
Stanton wowed the Marlins dur-
ing spring training with his power but the 20-year-old outfielder was sent to Double-A Jacksonville for seasoning. He responded by domi-nating the Southern League, hitting .311 with 21 homers and 52 RBIs in 52 games to earn the promotion to the majors.
“I think he’s going to be fine,” 
second baseman Dan Uggla said. “He’s a very humble kid with a huge amount of talent and I think he’s going to continue to work hard. Hopefully, he’s going to be able to help us out.”
Stanton’s anticipated debut 
comes at a key time for Florida (28-30), which has lost four of five to sink to fourth in the NL East. But the Marlins were quick to dial down expectations and were con-fident the 2007 second-round draft pick would be able to handle the hype.
“The young man is mature and 
humble and I think he’ll handle it just fine,” said manager Fredi Gonzalez, who declined to get into where Stanton will play and how he fits into the lineup.
Washington Nationals rookie 
pitcher Stephen Strasburg will also make his big league debut today.

� HE BECAME THE HIGHEST-DRAFT -
ED JUCO PLAYER OF ALL TIME.
THE ASSOCIATED PRESS
 
SECAUCUS, N.J. — The Washington Na-
tionals selected junior college slugger Bryce 
Harper with the No. 1 overall pick in the MLB draft Monday night.
Harper, a 17-year-old with prodigious 
power from the College of Southern Nevada, is one of the most-hyped players in draft his-tory because of his eye-popping talent at the plate.
A year after taking similarly hyped right-
hander Stephen Strasburg, the Nationals got him a potential batterymate, although Harp-
er was announced as an outfielder at the draft 
site at MLB Network studios by commission-er Bud Selig.
He has shown solid defensive instincts 
behind the plate and called pitches much of 
the time. Still, some believe – including the 
Nationals, apparently – his bat could get to the majors even faster if he moves to the out-field.
The 6-foot-3, 205-pound Harper surpassed 
former big league pitcher Alex Fernandez, 
who went fourth overall to the Chicago White Sox in 
1990, as the highest-draft-
ed JUCO player.
He hit .443 with 31 
home runs and 98 RBIs in 
his first college season after skipping his fi-
nal two years of high school and getting his 
GED.
Harper is expected to seek a record con-tract through his adviser, Scott Boras, who last year negotiated a record-breaking four-year, $15.1 million deal with the Nationals for Strasburg. 
The Nationals have until Aug. 16 to sign 
Harper, who has said he has plenty of options, including going back to Southern Nevada for another year if negotiations go awry.
Harper was the subject of a Sports Illus-
trated cover story while still in high school, 
and has reportedly hit balls over 550 feet. A 
hitter has not garnered that much national at-tention since possibly FSU’s  J.D. Drew. Nationals select Harper with first overall pick in draft
to extend the lead to 6-0.
He then smacked his second 
homer in the fifth and capped his 
night off with a three-run dinger 
to right-center field in the eighth. 
Thompson racked up more home 
runs against the Owls than he had managed to hit all season before 
Sunday’s performance – which was 
just two.
“(After the third one) I was just 
thinking ‘no way,’” Thompson said. “I was just trying to put the 
ball in play.
The Gators put on an impressive 
display of power as they banged a season-high six balls over the fence 
against FAU (37-24).
“There are a couple stretches 
of games where we are swinging the bats as well as anybody in the 
(Southeastern Conference), and 
there are some other games where 
we are struggling,” said Preston 
Tucker, who hit a three-run homer in the eighth. “Fortunately we were 
swinging the bats well this week and we just have to continue that.”
Just one of those home runs was 
enough for Johnson, who started 
for UF and threw seven scoreless 
innings. It was an encouraging per-
formance from the left-hander who came into Sunday’s start with a 
10.23 ERA in his last four outings.
But he didn’t just excel on the 
mound – Johnson 
helped himself at 
the plate too.
He picked up 
three hits, including 
a solo home run of 
his own. Johnson’s 
success in both aspects of the game led him to be named the regional’s 
Most Outstanding Player.
The Gators’ pitching staff was 
tough on hitters all weekend. It  gave up only five runs in 27 innings 
while striking out 30 batters.
“I think if you plan on advanc-
ing to the College World Series and 
have a chance to play on the last 
day of the year – you have to hit, 
you have to pitch and you have to play defense,” O’Sullivan said.and did a great job.”
On offense, Schutte stepped up and carried 
the load for Florida. 
The freshman went 4 for 6 with three home 
runs and four RBIs between the two games, ex-
tending the UF freshman records to 19 and 59, respectively. 
“That wasn’t a freshman running around 
the bases out there – just a really good player,” Walton said. “She’s a hard worker and has re-ally developed into a ferocious hitter.”
The Gators also got another big day from 
junior Kelsey Bruder, who contributed a solo homer in Saturday’s opener and hit .565 with five home runs and 11 RBIs over the course of the NCAA Tournament. 
The primary keys to UF’s early win against 
Missouri were timely pitching and defense, as the Tigers left eight runners on base for the game. 
With two on and one out in the first, Mis-
souri’s Ashley Fleming hit a fly ball to right, where Bruder was able to make the catch and throw a tagging runner out at third. The game was still scoreless in the third 
when Missouri loaded the bases only to see 
Brombacher strike out Fleming to end the 
threat. 
The Tigers’ final opportunity came when 
trailing 2-0 in the fifth. They once again put runners on first and second before Nicole Hud-son popped out to Brombacher and Fleming grounded out to third to complete the frame. 
“The high fly ball that Stephanie caught 
was probably the biggest play of the game,” 
Walton said. “That could’ve been a disaster 
because we don’t work with our pitchers on catching fly balls at all … but she caught it like she’s been doing it her whole life.”
Unfortunately for the Gators they could 
not carry that momentum into the nightcap, as Georgia’s Alisa Goler gave her team a 2-0 lead just three batters into the bottom of the first with a home run to right. 
Florida battled back as Schutte homered 
in the fourth and pinch-runner Lauren Heil scored on a wild pitch in the fifth. But Georgia answered in the bottom of the frame with an RBI single from Brianna Hesson which gave it the 3-2 lead that would become the final. TUESDAY, JUNE 8, 2010 �  ALLIGATOR, 19

� THE FAMILY OWNS MAN U AND 
THE TAMPA BAY BUCCANEERS.
THE ASSOCIATED PRESS
 
LONDON – The American owners of Man-
chester United are $1.6 billion in debt, leaving 
their control of the club in doubt, the BBC re-ported Monday.
The BBC said its investigation found the 
Glazer family’s debts are $570 million greater than previously known. Malcolm Glazer and his sons own the Tampa Bay Buccaneers as well.
All the extra debt comes after the Glazers 
borrowed extensively against their shopping mall business in the United States. The extent of the debt could fuel a further revolt by a 
group of United fans who oppose the Glazers’ ownership.
The Glazers took over United in 2005 in a 
leveraged buyout worth $1.4 billion.
The BBC said it saw mortgage documents 
showing the Glazers have borrowed $570 mil-
lion against shopping malls owned by their company Allied Corporation. That’s in addi-tion to $1 billion in debts tied to Manchester United and $95 million to the Buccaneers.
The Buccaneers released a statement Mon-
day assuring Tampa Bay fans that the Glazer family is “as financially well-positioned as ever before.”
“Companies they own generate revenues 
in excess of $800 million each year,” Bucca-neers director of communications Jonathan Grella said.
The Glazers have said they have assets to-
taling $2.9 billion.
“I don’t think anybody can be satisfied with how Manchester United are being run,” Dave Whelan, chairman of Premier League club Wigan, told the BBC program “Panorama.”
“They have got somewhere in the order of 
a three-quarters of a billion pounds worth of 
debt. That has got to be eliminated and elimi-
nated quickly.”
The research for the BBC program was car-
ried out by Andy Green, a London financial analyst who is part of a campaign by disgrun-tled United fans to oust the Glazers.Thousands of United fans attended match-
es at Old Trafford last season adorned in green and gold colors instead of the club’s usual red. The homage to United’s original 19th century 
colors is a protest against the Glazers.
In March, United chief executive David 
Gill said the club’s debts were easily covered 
by the income.
“In an ideal world people would like to 
not have a mortgage on their house, but that doesn’t mean they don’t enjoy the benefits of living in that house and can’t afford that house,” he said.
The Glazers have said they will not sell the 
club.
“Sophisticated real estate experts know 
that the family’s refinancing of their commer-cial real estate before the global meltdown has proven to be the wise move,” the Buccaneers statement said.Glazer family’s debt leaves team’s future up in air

status in the college football world. 
Adding Miami and FSU would 
make the most sense. It would keep 
the conference within the southern 
region and both squads have rivals 
in the conference.
These expansions would de-
stroy the Big 12 and the ACC, so the Big East could add some of the 
other teams left behind in the ruins 
of these two former college football 
powers.
All of this would give us four 
super conferences. The consolida-tion of college football is the starting 
point to a playoff system.
It will basically have the same 
format as the NFL at this point. 
Each conference could have its 
own championship game – like 
many do now – and the winners of 
those will automatically earn a berth 
into the playoff. That will fill up four 
of the spots.
Then, much like the NFL, there 
could be two wild-card teams – or in this case, at-large bids. This will be for teams such as Boise State and Utah, which will unfortunately not 
be part of the big four. It could also 
be useful for a scenario where two 
teams from one of the super con-
ferences deserve a berth – like last 
season’s Alabama and Florida co-nundrum.
With the design of the system 
already in place, the logistics are the 
only things left.
The top-two squads, by ranking, 
would earn a bye in the first round 
while the remaining four battle it out for a chance to advance.
Then it would just take the form 
of a classic semifinal round and championship game.
All of this is still very up in the 
air. Conference expansion is just an idea that hasn’t come to fruition yet. 
But the way things are going, it 
looks like it is very possible. 
So instead of looking at it as the 
demise of the sport, let’s put another adage to use and see this glass as 
half full.ANTHONY , from page 17Baseball“Companies they own gener -
ate revenues in excess of $800

“Finish the Mission” has been the 
Gators’ anthem all season. A last op-
portunity awaits to do just that.
After capturing a men’s NCAA 
Indoor Championship, men’s South-eastern Conference  Outdoor Cham-
pionship, women’s SEC Cross Coun-
try Championship and SEC Indoor Championship, the Gators track and field teams look to complete what has been a remarkable season by adding two more team championships this week at the NCAA Outdoor Champi-
onships in Eugene, Ore. 
Florida enters the final meet, which 
runs from Wednesday through Satur-
day, hot off dominating the East Pre-liminary Round, sending 19 Gators to compete in 21 slots. 
As the defending NCAA Indoor 
Champion, the No. 2 men’s team looks to become just the fourth team in 
NCAA history to win both the indoor 
and outdoor national titles  in the same season.
If either team does complete the 
final quest, then it would mark the first time in program history a men or women’s team has claimed a NCAA Outdoor Title. 
The men qualified for 13 spots in-
cluding the 4x100-meter relay team, which will be looking to win its second consecutive NCAA Championship. 
Jeff Demps qualified in multiple 
events and returns to the track where he became the co-owner of the U.S. 
Junior World Record (10.01) in the 
100-meter dash.
The women’s team qualified for 
eight spots including three in the shot put. All-American Mariam Kevkhish-vili, who holds the nation’s top shot put toss this season, heads to Eugene looking to cap off an undefeated sea-son and defend last year’s title. 
Kevkhishvili will be looking for her 
second consecutive NCAA Outdoor title, after already claiming the SEC Indoor title, SEC Outdoor Champion-ship and NCAA Indoor title. 
The season-long mantra of “Finish 
the Mission” was established after the Gators track and field teams felt that after a successful 2009 campaign, ulti-mately, it could have been better.
According to UF coach Mike Hol-
loway, who was recently named the South Region Men and Women’s Head Coach of the Year, his teams were inspired by the theme that the 
Florida football team used en route to 
its 2008 National Championship.
The mantra has obviously been 
taken to heart as the Gators look to complete one of their most prosperous years in school history.

ing the meet at its historic Hayward Field this year.  20, ALLIGATOR � TUESDAY, JUNE 8, 2010

It was a devastating conclu-
sion to the season for the Gators. 
No. 6 Florida finished the National Championships 
on Thursday tied for 11th place, a stroke shy of quali-fying for match play. 
Match play is a when a team earns a point for each 
hole in which it defeats its opponent and it is reserved for the teams who finish in the top eight of the Na-tional Championships.
UF carded a 293 (+5) on the final day and posted a 
final team score of 869 (+5).
“The final day was very disappoint-
ing,” senior Tim McKenney said. “Ev-ery single one of us looks back on the tournament and knows that we could have saved a couple shots. This is very 
heart breaking.”
After a sub-par start, the Gators needed to step up 
on the back nine.
“We got off to a very poor start,” McKenney said. 
“I think between the five of us we only had two bird-
ies on the front nine. I don’t know if it was nerves 
or not, but coach (Buddy) Alexander was being posi-
tive and we started to fight back and gain a little more confidence on the back nine.”
Seniors Tyson Alexander and McKenney didn’t 
finish their notable collegiate careers on a  high note, as both players carded their worst round of the tour-nament Thursday. Alexander dropped from 43rd to 64th place and shot a 75 (+3), while McKenney fell to 72nd after scoring a 76 (+4).
“I didn’t play very well,” McKenney said. “Tyson 
also didn’t play particularly well. We didn’t step up when we needed too, and it’s disappointing to only lose by a shot.”
Although McKenney has finished his career at UF, 
he hopes to continue with golf.
“I’m moving back home to Arizona,” he said. “My 
goal is to turn pro and make a living off the game of golf.”Gators endure
