MERRIMACK, N.H. — It’s not Picasso but a New Hampshire 
woman hopes a piece of art painted by a chicken will raise money 
to rebuild a playground.
The 8.5-by-10-inch painting called “Feathered Fireworks” is 
being auctioned on eBay.
Wendy Thomas of Merrimack says she created the piece by 
dipping the chicken’s feet in paint then placing the hen on can-vas.
WMUR-TV said Thursday that bidding started at $9.99.The proceeds will help rebuild the Kids Kove playground in 
Merrimack.

Briona Johnston, 7, holds a bearded dragon, a potential birthday present, at 
Hogtown Reptiles Tuesday. “I can watch TV with it and feed it my vegetables,” Johnston said. Owners Doug Foster, Dave Neven and Chris Glass opened the shop in May and say they approach the business as an interactive experience for customers. Neven said about half of the store’s customers are students. The shop hosted a grand opening on Saturday, and people played with a small, furry, monkey-like animal called a kinjakou.

UF may institute an experimental pro-
gram that would give incoming students 
the option to spend their time at UF en-rolled in classes only during spring and summer terms.
UF Provost Joe Glover said the idea 
was born out of the need to address the university’s enrollment levels across terms.
He said while fall enrollment is con-
sistently at capacity, winter and spring graduations lead to a drop off in enroll-ment numbers.
“We believe that there is a group of 
students out there that would like that op-tion,” he said.
He spoke of the pilot program in Jack-
sonville Wednesday at a meeting of the Florida Board of Governors, which over -
sees the state university system and advo-cates on behalf of universities to the state legislature.
In order for such a program to proceed, 
lawmakers have to repeal a state law that allows students entering with nine or more accelerated credits to be exempt from having to take a summer term.Most UF students are typically exempt 
due to high admission standards.
Once universities are allowed to re-
quire students to enroll for summer, which Glover hopes can be accomplished during the upcoming legislative session, the program can begin.
Board members supported the repeal-
ing of the law.
Glover said the uni-
versity would go to the legislature to ensure that the roughly 1,000 students in the program 
could use their Bright Futures scholarships to-ward tuition.
He said he realizes 
how different the ap-
proach is, but that there’s no reason the fall-spring model can’t be changed.
“There’s nothing sacred about that,” 
he said.
Glover said the program could be in 
place by January 2013, with new and trans-fer students making up the pilot class. 
The program, he said, would allow 
students who might not have been accept-
ed for fall to enroll. They would have the 
choice to accept or go elsewhere.UF may force some 
out of fall semesters

� UF STUDENTS TOOK OUT MORE 
THAN $216 MILLION IN LOANS IN THE 2008-2009 SCHOOL YEAR.
By LIDIA DINKOVA
Alligator Contributing Writer
Americans owe more in student loans 
than credit card debt. 
Consumers now owe $826.5 billion in 
credit card debt, compared to $829.785 
billion in student loans, according to the 
Wall Street Journal. 
But UF students’ debt isn’t increasing 
as drastically as the national average. 
For the 2008-2009 academic year, 
17,577 UF students took out more than 
$216 million in loans, said Rick Wilder, associate director of UF Student Financial Affairs. 
That amount is about $19 million more 
than the loans taken out the previous year and $22 million more than borrowed in the 2006-2007 academic year.   
He said these numbers show a “mod-
est” rather than “drastic” increase and at-tributed the growth of money loaned to UF loan debt not rising 
as rapidly as nation’s

� SOME OF THE SHOP’S  
ANIMALS ROAM THE STORE.
By LIDIA DINKOVA
Alligator Contributing Writer
A young boy loudly announced 
what most had already noticed at 
Hogtown Reptile Shop Saturday af-ternoon.
“It got out of the cage!”
The subject of concern, a 5-foot 
iguana, sat on top of a cage and la-
zily stared back at the finger point-ing in its direction. 
The owners smiled and explained 
that it didn’t need a cage. 
Then they showed 4-year-old Da-
vid Sneed the large tortoise strolling across the aisle, the possum sitting 
on the counter and the kinkajou, a 
small, rain forest mammal related to raccoons,  perched on a customer’s shoulder. 
Doug Foster, Dave Neven and 
Chris Glass, the owners of Hogtown Reptile Shop, approach their busi-ness as an interactive experience. They have been working on creating that intimate atmosphere since May 1 when the shop first opened. 
The trio, 51, 45 and 33 respective-
ly , started Hogtown Reptile Shop because of their long-time love for reptiles. Glass bought his first snake at Foster’s old store, Hogtown Her -
petological Supply , when he was 12 years old.
They are the only workers at 
Hogtown Reptile Shop, located at 2104 SW 34th St. near Sweetbay 
Supermarket. Glass said it makes 
the days long, but they aren’t hir -
ing other people because he wants their customers to be given quality service when they come to the store, something that he believes is lacking in bigger chains like PetSmart.
“Employees have no idea what 
they’re talking about,” he said. “No offense, but they’re students just try-ing to get a paycheck.” 
At Hogtown Reptile Shop, the 
owners breed more than 50 percent of the animals themselves. 
Saturday marked the grand-
opening celebration for the store. 
Regular custom-ers and first-time customers alike eyed the corn 
snakes, played with the kinkajou and asked the owners questions. 
At least 50 percent of the custom-
ers at Hogtown Reptile Shop are col-
lege students, Neven said.
Saturday was Kathryn Rush’s 
first time at the store. She brought 
along her son, David, who moved excitedly from one reptile to the next. Rush brought David over on a 
wagon. They pass the store during their walks, and David was thrilled 
to stop this time, Rush said. 
“He was playing with the iguana 
in the back, and then he found a 
tortoise walking around, and then a kinkajou was crawling all over him,” she said of their first trip. “It’s like a hands-on zoo.”
Matt Anderson, a senior at UF, is 
a regular at Hogtown. He came in to 
the grand opening to trade his big 
chameleon for a baby chameleon. 
Anderson used to go to different 
stores before Hogtown opened. He said he comes to Hogtown now be-cause there is a better selection, the workers are friendlier and the prices are more reasonable. 
Because of the large variety of 
reptiles, there is a considerable range in prices. A yellow-bellied slider turtle can cost as little as $15, while a mata mata turtle costs $750. 
Snakes can cost anywhere from 
$15 to $1,000. According to Neven, 
the biggest factor in price is the color. 
Albino and pied snakes are always more expensive.
The most popular pet is the leop-
ard gecko because of the low main-tenance and price, and the most ex-otic reptile in the shop is the alligator snapping turtle, but it is a felony to sell it. Instead, customers can pay $2 
to feed it, adding to the interactive 
experience.
Alex Deme, a sophomore at San-
ta Fe College, took full advantage of the opportunity to participate Satur -
day. 
He watched Glass’ possum, 
Chauncey, eat a mealworm and then decided to try one himself.
“It was juicy ,” Deme said of 
the mealworm. “I bit into it, and it pussed out.”

A 46-year-old Gainesville woman was being held on a 
$30,000 bond Thursday for leaving three children in a locked 
car with no air conditioning.
Shyrl D. Williams, of 6123 SW 10th Place, was arrested 
after she left the children in her sedan for about 20 minutes Wednesday while she shopped in Winn-Dixie, according to 
the Alachua County jail arrest report. 
The outside air temperature was 89 
degrees with a heat index of 93 degrees. 
Williams was charged with three counts 
of child abuse and three counts of child 
neglect.
According to the report, two witnesses 
saw the children — Williams’ two-month-old grandson, and a 5-year-old and a 
3-year-old who she was caring for — sweating profusely. The report did not state if the children needed medical at-
tention.
The incident happened at about 4:20 p.m. Wednesday at 
the Winn-Dixie at 2500 N Main St.Kids left in hot car

The Reitz Union can now add a Redbox kiosk to 
its list of student services.
The kiosk, located outside of the Wachovia Bank  
on the ground floor of the Reitz Union, was installed 
on Sept. 9.
It is funded by Student Government.Redbox offers DVD rentals that cost $1 a day and 
Blu-ray discs for $1.50 a day. The cost is charged to a credit card.
Students can rent movies on campus and return them whenever they want to any Redbox kiosk in the area.
Student Body Vice President Marcus Dixon said 
the Redbox kiosk provides another movie rental op-tion for students who live on campus or who do not have cars.
According to Dixon, SG has gotten positive feed-
back about the machine. 
Sophomore Caleb Trainor noticed the Redbox 
kiosk Monday, and he has already used it three times.
“I’ve been sick, so I’ve just been sleeping and 
watching movies,” Trainor said.Redbox kiosk debuts on campus
Default rates fluctuated
an increase in the number of stu-
dents, higher tuition and the devel-opment of more loan programs. 
Currently UF has about 15 loan 
programs, the two biggest ones be-
ing subsidized and unsubsidized 
Stafford Loans.  
In a subsidized loan, no interest 
accumulates to the student’s bill until six months after leaving the university.
For the 2008-2009 academic 
year, UF students who borrowed money graduated owing an aver -
age of $15,932. 
That is about $600 more than 
the previous year.
“If you can figure out another 
way to fund your education, then don’t borrow,” Wilder said. “If you can’t, then borrowing is a very good tool.”Economics professor David 
Denslow said UF students might not take out as large or as many loans as students at other univer -
sities because of Florida Prepaid plans and Bright Futures scholar -
ships.
Default loan rates, which rep-
resent the amount of money bor -
rowed from the university by stu-dents and not paid back, fluctuated 
from 1.1 percent to 2.7 percent in the past 10 years, Wilder said.
“Our default rates 
are very, very low considering the size of our loan portfolio,” Wilder said. “Our students at UF are very 
good at paying their loans back.” 
Usually students are able to 
pay back their loans in about ten 
years, but the time frame can vary if they borrowed a significant sum of money. LOANS , from page 1

Starting Oct. 1, Gainesville Regional Airport will offer 
two direct, round-trip flights to Miami, Fla., courtesy of 
American Airlines.
Michelle Danisovzsky, a spokeswoman for the airport, 
said the substantial business travel between the two cities 
was the main reason for opening the new flight.
“People were forced to make a significant drive to fly 
from other airports,” she said. “We listened to the feed-
back. The timing is right, and we had the aircraft avail-able.”One-way airfare for the flight is set as low as $99, but 
she warned that airfares change frequently.
The distance by car between Gainesville and Miami is 
about 350 miles one way. 
AAA reported an average of $2.62 per gallon of gas 
in Florida, and Cars.com said the 2010 average miles per gallon is approximately 20, making a trip to Miami about 
$46.
The cost difference would be negligible 
for people with business meetings, said 
Danisovzsky.
But for those who need to be there and back for a one-
day meeting, it would be about 10 to 12 hours of driving 
as opposed to two hours of flight, she said.
“That would be a long day,” she joked.For students looking to use the flight, she said there are 
student discounts available online.
Stevie Funk, a 21-year-old history major at UF, travels 
to Miami every few months to visit her family, and she has to take a flight from Tampa to do so.
She said that she gets a rate of about $65 one way from 
the Tampa International Airport, but that she would use the new flights from Gainesville because they’re more convenient.
The 11:15 a.m. flight from Miami on Oct 1. will be the 
first flight of the program, and Danisovzsky said there will be a free event at the airline terminal beginning at noon to celebrate. 
There will be food, ticket giveaways and a special guest 
speaker from another American Airlines hub.Airport adds direct flights between Gainesville, Miami

55 TOTAL VOTESMonday’s question: Are you glad we can do either/or poquestions now? 61% GLAD11% NOTToday’s question: Have you taken out any student loans?Growing up doesn’t end at childhood
Growing up we’re taught the very important lesson of determination. We can accomplish anything we put our minds to, we’re told. Our goals are noth-
ing but a few steps away. Our childhood dreams would always come true.
Well, not to sound bitter or anything, but I’m still wait-
ing for the day when my dreams of flying, breathing un-derwater, owning a talking tiger and having my own uni-corn farm come true.
Obviously, I’m not bitter. Not at all.When we’re children, we’re encouraged by our parents 
to be whatever we want to be. No matter how ridiculous 
our dreams may be, they’ve always nurtured them. 
At one point in my life I dreamed of becoming a pop 
star. Of course my parents approved, saying if I worked 
hard enough anything was possible. The fact that I couldn’t 
hold a tune to save my life was irrelevant to them. 
I’m still waiting for that record deal, by the way.
Our parents don’t realize that by being so encouraging 
they set us up to fail. 
Now before everyone flips out, I’m very thankful for 
my parents’ encouragement and support. They’ve been nothing but perfect. 
But by the time we go through school, we learn the 
many factors that deter us from our dreams. 
Sure, some dreams are halted by personal impediments 
like allergies, and others are killed by the realization that scrubs will never be flattering, but all childhood dreams come to a crossroad. They either progress or get sent to that imaginary unicorn farm you realized is never going to be built.
Our parents eventually do their job. They raise happy, 
imaginative children with dreams that will one day lead them to a fulfilled life. What parents ultimately for -
get is to be realistic with us. Yes, hard work and perseverance will get you wherever you want to go, but that’s not enough anymore.
Kids are realizing that fulfill-
ing your dreams takes a bit more than hard work and imagina-tion.
Those distant dreams of becoming a top-notch surgeon 
get replaced by realistic career plans that don’t require ten 
years of studying, your sanity and your parents’ life sav-
ings. 
Your dreams become more achievable. 
Sure, some kids do go on to be everything they wanted 
to be and more. Some become doctors, lawyers, clowns. 
Others become teachers, pilots, astronauts. Yet those few 
who wanted to become princesses, ninjas, fairies and pi-
rates woke up to find that working at Disney is as close as they’ll ever get. 
Imagination is the one thing keeping kids from becom-
ing adults. Once our imagination wears off we become jaded and bitter toward our failed dreams. 
Our determination gets replaced with a very adult 
term: settling. 
Settling is to adults what growing up is to kids. We all 
grow up eventually. 
So in time, we ignore that corny saying that encourages 
us to aim for the stars. Instead, we aim for the ground in hopes of being grounded enough to understand this is life.

We know it’s been two weeks since you’ve last seen us. 
We know we had to take a tiny vacation to deal with the whole Muslim-holy-book-burning situation, but we’re back. And to compensate all of you for lost time, we’re not wasting any more. 
So without further ado, we present you with our perhaps 
first of its kind Holy-Crap-We-Have-So-Many-Darts-And-Laurels-To-Throw-To-Make-Up-For-Last-Week’s-Absence-We-Don’t-Even-Know-Where-To-Start-So-We’re-Giving-You-A-Double-Dose-Today edition of 
Darts & Laurels
There’s one special lady who went above and beyond a 
double dose at one of the least-meaningful and most-dis -
cussed award ceremonies our pop culture has to offer.  
Our favorite bubble-wrap, meat-dress-wearing “Fame” 
fanatic picked up eight VMAs this week while also announc-
ing the name of her next album “Born This Way.” 
For being our favorite obsession we’re not even afraid 
to admit, we’re giving you a soy-laced-because-we’re-tired-of-the-stinky-dehydrated-jerky-frock-and-you-clearly-had-one-of-the-best-videos-of-all-time LAUREL  to Lady Gaga. 
But there are some things we are really afraid to admit 
keep happening. 
When our football stars become the stars behind bars, we 
get more and more disappointed with our school each time.  
Can we just get through one semester without one of our 
star players getting arrested? That’s all we want, and we don’t think it’s too much to ask. 
For being a textaholic with an affinity for aggravated stalk-
ing and scintillating 160-character messages, we’re throwing 
a  Way-2-Go-G8rs-W/-Da-Felonees-Plz-Try-2-Stop DART at 
Chris Rainey. Time to get our acts  together. 
Like our flip-flopping governor trying to make things 
right in our state. 
He’s getting his act together. And even though we think 
that’s all his campaign is — an act — we’re glad he’s doing 
some things right. So, for showing the thousands of children in government custody and the thousands of gay Floridians you’re considering caring about their civil rights and well being, we’re throwing Gov. Charlie Crist a We-Don’t-Care-
What-Party-You-Are-If-You-Keep-Up-That-Florida-Tan-To-Represent-Our-State LAUREL  for considering dropping 
a state appeal to keep a ban on Floridian gay couples from adopting. 
And then there are people who we just despise occupying 
our state. You guys totally thought we were talking about those Dove people right? Wrong. 
No, we’re talking about those infamous tow-truck drivers 
who take sadistic pleasure in charging poor, can’t-pay-for-groceries college students inordinate amounts of dough for parking in a spot for 10 minutes too long.
And for towing one of our own editors while he was cov-
ering an event and charging him almost  $100 on the day of his birthday party (seriously, could you be more of a meanie?), we’re throwing all of you a We-Wish-We-Knew-
How-To-Get-Our-Hands-On-One-Of-Those-Boot-Keys-To-Unlock-Our-Own-Cars DART. 
OK,  so we’re running out of room, and you still need a 
double shot. Let’s go through these quickly. 
Humans and zombies alike, we’re throwing you a DART, 
not a Nerf ball. 
UF football team, stop starting out the game losing and 
then winning, and we’ll keep throwing you a LAUREL . 
And to Gainesville, here’s a LAUREL for the first week-
end with no threat of Quran burning! We’re proud of you.

Speaking Out Media avoids real issues
  After reading how the Alligator staff responded to the 
Chris Rainey story, I was thoroughly disappointed. Say-
ing Rainey “just sent a sexy text message that said ‘Time 
to die bitch’ among other sweet nothings” is trivializing a 
serious issue. In addition, one of your sports editors
  claimed because the girlfriend didn’t really want to 
press charges “this isn’t that big of a deal.” This is a false 
statement. Current statistics report one in ﬁ  ve college 
females will experience some form of dating violence. Focusing on ”Will Rainey ever get to play again for the Gators?” isn’t the real issue. The real issue is that women ages 16 to 24 experience the highest rate of intimate part-
ner violence of any age group. 
  I would like to see the university and community use 
this incident as a wake-up call
  that no matter who it is, this behavior is never OK.   If you have experienced dating violence, rape or other 
intimate partner violence, you are not alone. You can make 
an appointment with a UF Victim Advocate at 352-392-1111 or with the UF Counseling Center at 352-392-1575. 
  I can only hope in the future the Alligator and other 
news sources will concentrate more on the real issue at hand rather than one athlete’s downfall.

 Columnist makes ﬂ  awed argument
  What a silly argument Bryan Grifﬁ  n has against the 
health care bill. He seems to think faceless government bureaucrats are somehow different or worse than faceless 
insurance company bureaucrats. At least with the govern-
ment   we have a level of organizational transparency.
 Chad Kimes
5EGLetters to the Editor
I hate to say it, but Washington, D.C., has a pretty ter-
rible record of helping the little guy, even when they 
try the hardest.
It seems like a never-ending saga. Our representatives 
have lengthy monthlong arguments about the exact de-
tails of any bill in consideration, and then sometimes they 
give us Americans a piece of garbage bill we’re supposed 
to be happy about.
A perfect case and point is the Credit Act of 2009. The 
idea behind the Credit Act was good in nature, but like 
most government ideas, the people the government was 
trying to protect actually got hurt. Washington was try-
ing to regulate credit card companies that were suddenly 
raising interest rates on their most risky customers.
Those same companies were also swindling their cus-
tomers by putting shady rules into the often overlooked 
contracts that it had each of its applicants sign.
However, since the inception of the Credit Card Ac-
countability and Responsibility and Disclosure Act of 
2009, we have only seen interest rates on credit cards go higher; completely the opposite of what Washington’s 
original intention was.
Since the passage of the Credit Act, Americans have 
seen the spread between the prime rate and their credit 
card interest rates climb to new 22-year highs: 11.45 per-cent. Ouch. On average, Americans are now paying 14.7 
percent on their consumer credit cards, a rate which is 
only expected to grow in the future.
Business leaders tend to be much smarter than their 
Washington counterparts when it comes to looking out 
for their constituents.
The original intent of the Credit Act was to give card 
issuers less ﬂ  exibility to raise interest rates in a snap of the ﬁ  nger. Those who were hit with the stark increasing rates were almost always people who were missing pay-ments.
Nowadays, credit card companies are just giving new 
card applicant’s higher starting rates and not worrying about the potential default of individuals, as the default risk is already ﬁ  gured into the higher initial rates.
Overall, everyone is paying for the mismanagement of a select few due to the passage 
of the 2009 Act. As we experience 
one of the greatest credit freezes 
ever seen, credit card companies 
are now earning more proﬁ  t and taking fewer risks thanks to Washington’s attempt at helping the little guy.
I have always been convinced that businesses employ 
some of the brightest individuals on Earth, not Washing-ton, and laws like this give me conﬁ  dence in my think-ing. I don’t blame them either. Why make $140,000 a year working for Washington when you could be making mil-
lions upon millions working as an executive for a big ﬁ  rm. 
The intelligent characters at these credit card companies 
are becoming much more innovative as Washington puts small obstacles like the Credit Act in their way.
Spurring credit card innovation has almost never re-
sulted as a beneﬁ  t for normal Americans.
Companies like Citi and J.P Morgan have realized that 
the rules in the Credit Act don’t apply to “professional” credit cards that are normally intended for small busi-ness owners. Incidentally , companies like Citi sent out 
256 percent more applications in the ﬁ  rst quarter of 2010 
for the professional cards than they sent out before the 
passage of the Credit Act.
Now professional card applications only ask you to 
check that you are “a business professional with business 
expertise,” not if you are an actual business owner.
According to the credit card executive’s, they have 
“simpliﬁ  ed” their application process. Beware of these 
professional cards, even if you have “business exper-tise.”
Washington gets an A for effort, but unfortunately 
we Americans who rely on lines of personal credit are bearing the brunt of Washington’s failed attempt. Hold on to your wallets, folks, because credit card companies are now working even harder to trick us into paying 
outrageous interest rates and fees due to the Credit Act.
Sometimes governments do their best work by not doing 
anything at all. And they think that they have the solu-tions to solve our unemployment crisis.

Today’s edition of the alligatorSports 
Brand Picks Column is brought to you 
by the number 30!
There are just so many things to love 
about the big 3-0. The number has some 
sort of significance in the Bible, we’ve 
been told. And, more important, it’s how many tracks are on “The White Album.”
That’s a CD by The Beatles, a group 
that you hopefully have not confused with another equally prolific band fronted by Russell Crowe: 30 Odd Foots of Grunts.
In sports, Michael Jordan decided to 
play for the Birmingham Barons at 30 years old. Hall of Fame first baseman Orlando Cepeda wore No. 30 during his 16-year career. 
Although he is more famous for a 
number four digits higher, Nolan Ryan wore 30 for the Angels. And for the few of you who watch hockey: yes, we are 
aware the number can be found on the 
back of Devils goalie Martin Brodeur.   
Thirty is also the number of uprights 
at Stonehenge, the length of The Thirty Year’s War and the atomic number for zinc. American social activist Jerry Ru-bin once warned, “Don’t trust anyone over 30.” 
On a related note, the minimum age 
for a U.S. senator is 30.
Oh, and it’s the number of football 
players who have been arrested since Urban Meyer took over. The Dirty 30.
Speaking of dirty, FSU (-10) will 
cover the spread because this week-end because: 
First it’s the Miami Heat’s Big Three 
and now it’s FSU.
When is it going to stop Tyler? Your 
knack for hating on things is really sad. It pains me to see you like this.
After the Sooners whipped the 
Seminoles last week, do you honestly think that BYU is going to come into Tally and even come close to making it a game against FSU?

Harrison Diamond / Alligator Staff
Coach Urban Meyer and the Gators will travel to Knoxville, Tenn., to take on the Vols 
in their first game of the season.
By KYLE MAISTRI
Alligator Staff Writer
Kmaistri@alligator.org
 
Urban Meyer’s biggest concern about Satur -
day’s road game in Neyland Stadium is simple 
— don’t break routine. 
 With so many players set to make their first 
start in a Southeastern Conference road game, Meyer wants his guys focused on business as usual when they take on the Vols on Saturday 
at 3:30 p.m.
 “We just can’t mess up the routine,” Meyer 
said. “All great players, all great teams have rou-tines, and when they’re disrupted, that’s when 
you get lack of concentration.”
Meyer wants his players to be in the right 
place at the right time, go through normal pre-game rituals and avoid distractions. 
But something else has become part of the 
routine when Florida faces Tennessee — a UF 
victory. 
The Gators have beat the Vol-
unteers in each of Meyer’s five seasons at the helm, with 2006’s 21-20 contest in Knoxville, Tenn. 
being the closest call.
 UF has outrushed UT in each 
of those contests, and the other four games were decided by a combined 82 points.
 This week’s focus has been on making sure 
this group of Gators picks up this rivalry where those other teams left off. 
“There’s probably going to be some wide 
eyes,” Meyer said. “But if we can get through the first couple minutes of that game, we’ll be fine.” 
Meyer is pleased with how far the young 
players have come on special teams since the start of the season, proof that the underclassmen 
are developing.
 “That is the sign,” Meyer said. “It’s always 
been that way, and it’s the only thing I really look at. I can see the development.”
Senior punter Chas Henry grew up as a Vols SEC opener poses tough test for Florida
UF VOLLEYBALL

Alligator Writer
 
The Gators enter Southeastern Confer -
ence play having already defeated four top-
15 teams. 
With their highest ranking since the 2005 
season, will the Gators easily continue win-
ning through the SEC?
Not necessarily. 
As if a grueling nonconference schedule 
wasn’t enough, No. 3 Florida (6-1) will be-
gin SEC matches this weekend when it takes on No. 22 Kentucky (6-4) in Lexington, Ky., at 7 p.m. tonight. Florida will then face No. 
18 Tennessee (8-1) in Knoxville, Tenn., at 2 
p.m. on Sunday. 
“Everything that we’ve 
done so far has been great 
for learning and for ex-
perience, but we realize 
it starts Friday night in Lexington,” coach Mary Wise said. “We have to 
rely on the things that 
we’ve learned over the 
past three weeks to help us as we head into SEC play.”Friday night will mark the first time 
since 1991 — Wise’s first year at Florida — that the Gators will not start SEC competi-
tion as the defending champion.
“This is arguably the toughest road trip 
in the league,” Wise said. “To do that this 
early in the season after [we] have had to 
play so hard over the first three [weeks] 
I think it is as big a challenge as we have ever faced in Florida volleyball during the SEC.”
The Gators were the lone conference 
team to finish in the final rankings in 2000. Gators to begin conference play on road

SEE FOOTBALL, PAGE 14
SEE VOLLEYBALL, PAGE 14SEE PICKS, PAGE 14Ten years later, there are four teams in the top 25 — a 
testament to the growing improvement of the volleyball teams in the conference.
After the Gators finished third in the SEC last year, 
coaches picked them to finish second this year behind Tennessee. 
“I think it kind of lights a fire under us,” senior Callie 
Rivers said. “Everyone has their own opinion so hopefully we can prove people wrong and win the SEC this year.”
However, Wise says the team is spending more time 
focusing on its play rather than where coaches picked them to finish.
“We never put a whole lot of attention into the pre-
season poll,” Wise said. 
“When we were picked, there were some years I was 
surprised. I said, ‘Did you not see our graduation?’ I vot-ed for Tennessee. They have Nikki Fowler, one of the best 
players in the country.”
The Gators will have quite a task containing Fowler, a 
member of the 2009 All-SEC First Team. She comes into 
the weekend with 112 kills, 36 more than Gators’ leader 
Kelly Murphy.
Florida is 22-4 in conference openers and is a perfect 19-0 
under Wise. But after failing to win the SEC for the first time 
in her tenure as coach, the Gators know there is a first time 
for everything.fan going to games in Neyland Stadium with his fam-
ily. He always knew what the atmosphere was like as 
a spectator, but it isn’t the same when you’re on the 
field and the crowd noise is drowning out communi -
cation with your teammates.  
“This is a very young team, I think 60 or 70 per -
cent of the guys are freshmen or sophomores,” Henry said. “A lot of these guys, this is their first away game 
and their first rivalry game that they’ve ever played 
in. Even guys that were here last year, they may have redshirted and weren’t a part of this. So this is a huge 
game and a lot of guys are going to get welcomed into 
the SEC and welcomed into rivalry games by 107,000 people. This is a hostile crowd.”
The last time UF traveled to Knoxville, the Gators 
got out to a 17-0 first-quarter lead before the game settled into a relatively uneventful 30-6 win.
 Last season, former UT coach Lane Kiffin pushed 
the game back to national prominence thanks to his offseason promise of beating Florida and his per -
ceived beef with Meyer.
Saturday, there will be no Kiffin. Nor a crowd- 
pleasing clash between UT safety Eric Berry and UF 
quarterback Tim Tebow. 
Those distractions are gone, so this game might be 
a little more boring. Routine even.

 Urban Meyer said he understands the 
public perception of his football team, 
which has featured 30 arrests since he be-
came the Florida coach in 2005.
  “I’m real concerned about that,” he 
said. “After a while, enough is enough. If 
there is something that we can improve 
on, we’re certainly looking into that.”
  Most recently, wide receiver Chris 
Rainey was arrested Tuesday morning on aggravated stalking charges. Meyer de-
fended his team, saying certain problems 
are blown out of proportion.
  “This is not a dirty program,” he said. 
“We follow the rules and some guys make 
mistakes.”  Hill to play: After sitting out two weeks 
for unknown reasons, Florida free safety 
Will Hill will play Saturday against Ten-
nessee, Meyer said.
  Hill appeared in every game last year 
and led the Gators in special teams tackles 
each of his ﬁ  rst two seasons in Gainesville. 
Meyer did not say how much playing time 
Hill would receive this week, but he said he thought the safety would make his ﬁ  rst start of the year.
  Hill is expected to bolster a defensive 
backﬁ  eld that has already generated six of the team’s NCAA-high eight interceptions this season.
  Moody, Demps share time: With Rain-
ey off the team, Meyer will try to maintain a balance between speed and power by us-ing running backs Emmanuel Moody and Jeff Demps at the same time frequently this week.
  At 215 pounds, Moody is seen as more of 
a traditional back while Demps, who won 
a national championship in the 100-meter 
dash this spring, brings a skill set similar to that of Rainey.
  Demps leads the team with 237 rush-
ing yards this season. No other player has rushed for more than 84 yards.
  Marsh out: Defensive tackle Lawrence 
Marsh needed 15 to 20 stitches on his fore-arm after suffering a “freak” accident in 
the bathroom.
  Marsh, who has recorded one tackle in 
two games this season, will still travel with 
the team and serve as a captain. Florida is 
allowed to bring 70 players to Southeast-
ern Conference away games.
  Meyer said the lineman emerged from 
the practice ﬁ  eld bathroom with a gash, so the coach checked out the scene and was shocked at what happened. 
  “The sink broke,” Meyer said. “He 
leaned on the sink.” FRIDAY, SEPTEMBER 17, 2010  ALLIGATOR, 15

your whole life, but schools from this state are a little better 
than schools from Utah. Just look at last season’s matchup be-tween the two teams when the Seminoles won 58-24.
You should understand history pretty well. After all, you 
are enrolled in a class called “The Early Republic” — whatever that means.
-- ANTHONY CHIANG
The stormin’ Mormons of BYU (+10) will lay a Joseph-
Smith style beating because:
Anthony Chiang’s mind is not right, something even he 
will readily admit. Here’s some context: between spending his nights in the office and his days in the classroom, Chiang 
is limited to four hours of sleep each night. While researching 
someone on Google, he simply typed in “Keith.” 
And when he was asked to write an article Thursday night, 
he begged for mercy , explaining he could not string thoughts, much less sentences, together.
And now he forgets where he grew up. He picked against 
the ‘Canes last week, and now he’s cheering for the ‘Noles. What would big-daddy Guillermo say?
Chiang is a mess. But to really understand his mental state, 
you have to realize this is a man who thought it would be OK to adopt the nickname “Slater” because his initials line up with the first name of his favorite “Saved by the Bell” character.
Chiang’s wrestling technique is a little suspect, but he’s at 
least got the dancing skills after all those salsa lessons.  
-- TYLER JETT
Now on to the picks!At the top of the leaderboard with a record of 13-6 is alli-
gatorSports Assistant Editor Tyler “If I lived behind Chipotle I would go crazy” Jett, who started panting with excitement after realizing there were apartments behind the Chipotle on University Ave. As a 6-foot-5 white male with blond hair, he is the farthest thing from being Mexican. But that doesn’t stop him from ordering those burrito bowls.
Tied for first is the Gainesville Sun’s Edward “That guy’s 
hot, that guy’s not, no homo” Aschoff, whose recent assign-ment from the Sun sparks curiosity about his life choices. He has a girlfriend, but he’s spending way more time scrolling 
through SEC photo galleries. We get it. It’s your job to gaze into 
Ryan Mallett’s eyes. Whatever, Edward. 
Leading a three-man weave in third with an 11-8 record is 
Alligator football writer Kyle “If she’s not giving me what I want, I could see myself accidentally stepping over the line” Maistri, who identified with Chris Rainey’s recent problems. You guys are good people, just misunderstood. But, ladies, you should probably call the cops if Kyle texts you after midnight.
Also in third is Alligator football writer Mike “Oh wait, I’ve 
been there” McCall, who initially struggled on his “Guide to Seattle” presentation in speech class before remembering he spent the whole summer covering the Mariners. “And that photo, right there, is my... Oh! My old apartment. Sorry.”
And completing that weave is Gatorbait.net’s Keith “Don’t 
tell me info I can’t fit in 140 characters” Niebuhr, who may quit his job to work independently for Keith Niebuhr’s Twitter ac-count. Follow him @igetscoops4days. He’s natural enemies with Teryl Austin, who called social networking “dumb.”
Starting a second three-way tie in sixth with a record of 10-9 
is the Miami Herald’s Joe “I keep my eye on you” Goodman, who freaked Urban out with questions about his sideline be-havior last week. Meyer’s response: “I appreciate you watching me. That’s kind of weird, to be honest with you.”
Also in sixth is alligatorSports Editor Anthony “May I please have some chocolate milk” Chiang, whose quiet voice, paired with a childlike request, made members of his staff think they adopted an orphan. That fear grew when copies of “The Giv-ing Tree” and “If You Give a Mouse a Cookie” sprouted up in the office.
And tied for sixth (but, really, in dead-ass last place) with an 
OK (but, really , piss-poor) record of 10-9 is FightinGators.com’s Cody “SEC Play” Jones, whose love for college sports in the Bible Belt has turned him into a one-dimensional interviewer.

UF SOCCER
By JESSE SIMONTON
Alligator Writer
 
Taylor Travis is heading home. No, not be-
cause the freshman phenom is homesick, but 
because the forward is making a brief stop 
where it all started. 
This weekend, Travis and the No. 5 Gators 
(6-0-0) venture to North Carolina for their 
biggest road trip of the season. 
Tonight, when Florida pulls into Durham 
to take on No. 17 Duke (5-1-1) at 8:45 p.m., the teams will play just 20 minutes from Travis’ hometown of Cary. There, in a small suburb, Travis’ highway to Gainesville was paved. 
At 4-years-old, Travis’ mom asked her 
if she wanted to play baseball or soccer. “I wanted to play anything,” she said, “so I told her both.”
Travis first laced up the boots as a bright-
eyed kid on Cary’s YMCA fields. Before she was a Gator, she was a Sun, and she wore a 
school bus yellow jersey to every game. 
As Travis got older, she became better 
than a lot of boys. She began playing in the 
Olympic Development Program pool at age 12. When high school came around, already on a club and ODP team, Travis decided high school soccer wasn’t worth the time.
“If you want to be the best you have to 
train like the best,” Travis said. “That’s not to 
say high school soccer isn’t good for people, 
it’s just that what I was looking for was a little different.”Travis trained with a local boy’s club team 
in town and aimed sights on college soccer. 
With scholarships from all over the coun-
try, Travis decided to leave the soccer hotbed 
of North Carolina.  
After assistant coach 
Victor Campbell saw Tra-vis play in a Thanksgiv-ing ODP tournament, he quickly told UF head coach Becky Burleigh they need-
ed to check out the talented high school senior. 
“We got into the [re-
cruiting] game really late with Taylor, but when she came on her visit we connected really well and it all worked out,” Burleigh said. 
Despite visiting Gainesville during Christ-
mas break when no players were around, Taylor committed to Florida because of her admiration and respect for Burleigh.
“Becky was my deciding factor in coming 
here,” she said. “I love her to death and I can’t imagine playing anywhere else.”
In the years since trading the yellow jer -
sey for one that is orange and blue, Travis has developed a steadfast attitude and supreme resolve. Tattooed down her rib cage is the phrase “whatever it takes.” 
This weekend, playing in front of family 
and friends, the freshman looks to take those words to heart and help the Gators win on the road.
Travis returns home as No. 5 Florida faces No. 17 Duke
