For some, a bicycle is convenient. But for others, it can 
be a stepping stone to a better life.
Operating on this idea, a group of UF graduates and 
current students have partnered up with The Kickstand 
to give repaired bicycles to poor and homeless patrons at 
the Gainesville Catholic Worker House.
Seven bicycles have already been given away, all to 
homeless people. One bicycle was given to a man who 
found a new job but needed transportation to get there, one was given to a man who had just had his bike stolen 
and another bike went to a disabled man who needed a 
way to get to his doctor’s appointments.
To start, the group bought 30 used bicycles from 
Craigslist last month to fix up.
They then met on June 7 and again on Sunday to repair 
some of the used bicycles at The Kickstand, a community 
bicycles shop located on South Main Street that helps

The fat lady may be warming up her vocal 
cords for Grooveshark.com, a music streaming 
Web site founded by two former UF students.
Music industry giant EMI is suing the 
Gainesville-based company Escape Media for copyright infringement on its Grooveshark Web 
site. Grooveshark was founded by UF students 
Josh Greenberg and Sam Tarantino in 2006, and 
the site officially launched in the summer of 2007 as a peer-to-peer music sharing site.
The Web site’s slogan is “Play any song in 
the world, for free!” and it now allows users to search for songs, add them to a playlist and have further listening automatically suggested based on past choices.
“Grooveshark’s main objective is to pro-vide instant listening of music to anyone in the world, but at the same time compensate those who create the music,” said Ben Westermann-Clark, spokesman for Grooveshark. “Obviously this is a pretty hefty undertaking, as there are literally tens of thousands of music labels out there.”
Grooveshark already has licens-
ing deals with labels like V2 and Nettwerk, which has signed Sarah McLachlan and Barenaked Ladies.
The Web site had been negotiating a similar 
licensing agreement with EMI for more than a 
year before the company sued.
“As a company, it sounds really cheesy, but 
we’re completely committed to helping artists, 
labels and fans connect with each other in a 
way that feels inevitable online,” Westermann-Company sues Grooveshark
� THE STORY DEPICTED HIS 
DAUGHTER’S DEATH.

Alligator Writer
On March 9, 2004, George Goens 
was awoken by a phone call at 3:50 
a.m. telling him that his daughter, 
Betsy, was in trouble.
After Betsy gave birth to her sec-
ond child, Luke, doctors noticed a rare complication. Hours later, as Goens was rushing to make his 6:15 a.m. flight from Connecticut, she died in a South Florida hospital.
His story would be told years lat-
er in a Sunday edition of The New York Times and then plagiarized by a UF student during an internship.
Intern reporter Hailey Mac Ar-thur used parts of Goens’ story for an article during her internship at The Colorado Springs Gazette.
This was one of four stories Mac 
Arthur wrote for the Gazette con-taining plagiarized material from the Times this summer.
“That story is so personal,” he 
said. “The words that were put to-gether were expressing my feelings and my thoughts.”
Overwhelmed with his daugh-
ter’s death, Goens, an author, mo-tivational speaker and consultant, took eight months to write the story Author reacts to UF

Cameras captured ‘chilling’ 
break-in at Fla. home 
PENSACOLA, Fla. (AP) — Byrd 
and Melanie Billings had a grow-
ing brood of adopted children with autism, Down syndrome and other disabilities, and took care to make 
their nine-bedroom house a safe 
place for them, wiring it with sur-veillance cameras in every room.
It was those cameras that cap-
tured images of the masked men who shot the wealthy couple to death in a break-in executed with chilling precision.
Authorities made three arrests 
over the weekend, but the mystery around town only deepened Mon-day, when Sheriff David Morgan said that as many as eight people in all may have been involved and that the crime appeared to have “numerous motives,” though rob-bery was the only one he would mention.
“Mr. Billings was well-to-do. 
He was an entrepreneur, and he opened his home to the communi-ty. You are asking me to speculate on a motive. That could have been one reason,” Morgan said, liken-ing the killings to the 1959 slayings of a Kansas farm family that were chronicled by Truman Capote in 
the book “In Cold Blood.”
The video from last Thursday 
showed three armed, masked 
men arriving in a red van, enter-ing through the front of the house and then returning to the vehicle. Others dressed in what the sher-iff called “ninja garb” went in through an unlocked utility door 
in the back. They were in and out 
in under 10 minutes.
Some of the nine children in the 
house at the time were sleeping, but several others saw the break-in, authorities said.Baby taken to hospital 
with screwdriver in ear 
HOMESTEAD, Fla. (AP) — 
Police are investigating how a 
screwdriver was lodged so deep-ly into a 5-month-old baby’s ear in South Florida that it may have 
caused cranial damage.
According to Homestead 
Capt. Ed Bowe, police were 
called to a home at 11:26 p.m. Sunday.
Latasha Bailey, 30, told police 
that she was in another room of her apartment when she heard her baby crying. When she en-
tered the room, she found her 
4-year-old son standing next to her infant son, who had a screw-driver jammed in his ear.
Bowe said the baby was flown 
to the hospital in Miami-Dade County in stable condition.
Fla. restricts honey that 
isn’t 100 percent pure 
TALLAHASSEE, Fla. (AP) — 
Florida wants to make sure its 
honey is 100 percent pure.
Agriculture and Consumer 
Services Commissioner Charles 
Bronson announced Monday 
that his department is instituting a regulation that prohibits addi-tives, chemicals or adulterants in honey produced, processed or sold in Florida unless consumers are clearly told what else is in it.
Bronson said, “Too often in 
the past, honey has been cut with 
water or sugar, and sometimes 
even contaminated with insecti-cides or antibiotics.”
The regulation takes effect 
today and says honey must con-tain only the “natural food prod-uct resulting from the harvest of nectar by honeybees.”
Bronson said if producers mix 
honey with other products, it can be sold, but must be clearly la-
beled as a blended product.
Chinese drywall may be in 400 homes
WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. 
(AP) — Homebuilder Lennar Corp. has identified defective Chi-
nese-made drywall in about 400 Florida homes, most built in the 2006 and 2007 fiscal years, accord-
ing to a federal filing.
The Miami-based company 
said in the filing with the U.S. 
Securities and Exchange Com-mission last week that the figure, based on accounting through May 31, represents only 2.1 percent of homes the company delivered in Florida during that time.
Lennar said it had not yet 
found defective drywall in any of its homes outside Florida, but con-tinues to investigate.
The company said it has set 
aside $39.8 million in warranty reserves for homes that have the defective drywall and is seeking reimbursement from subcontrac-
tors, insurers and others for inves-
tigative and repair costs related to the problem.
State and federal tests have 
found high levels of sulfur and or-ganic compounds in the Chinese drywall.
Homeowners across the coun-
try have sued builders, suppliers 
and manufacturers, claiming the 
fumes are ruining their houses and making them sick.
Lennar said it is named in at 
least 41 Florida state court lawsuits and two federal class action cases.
Shipping records reviewed by 
The Associated Press indicated that imports of potentially tainted 
Chinese building materials ex-
ceeded 500 million pounds during a four-year period of soaring home prices, peaking in 2006.
The drywall may have been 
used in more than 100,000 homes, according to some estimates, in-cluding houses rebuilt after Hur-ricane Katrina in 2005.

One UF student was robbed at gun-
point and another was kicked in the 
mouth in two muggings that occured over the weekend, according to police.
The muggings are part of a growing 
trend targeting young adults in areas on and near campus.
From June 1 to July 7, there were 
37 robberies in the city — not includ-ing campus. At least 12 happened near campus, according to data provided by the Gainesville Police Department.
In many cases, the victims are drunk 
and walking alone late at night, said 
GPD spokesman Lt. Keith Kameg.At around 1:18 a.m. Sunday, a man 
approached a student walking from his 
car to his apartment at Corry Village, a graduate student housing complex in the northwest part of campus.
The man pointed a gun at the stu-
dent, pushed him to the ground and demanded his car keys. The student refused to give up his keys and handed over cash instead, according to the Uni-versity Police Department. 
The man then took the student’s cell 
phone from his pocket and ran. The suspect is described as a 5-foot 11-inch 
black man wearing a black T-shirt, dark jeans and a black mask.
The second robbery occurred on 
Northwest 11th Street about 30 minutes 
later. The student, who was alone, had his wallet stolen and was kicked in the 
mouth. He described the suspects as 
two black men, one fat and the other of normal build.
Kameg questioned why the student, 
who had a phone, called his credit card companies before the police.
“My first reaction was just, ‘I don’t 
want these jerks to spend my money, and so I just canceled my cards im-
mediately,’” the student said, though 
he admitted he probably should have called police first.

A UF professor was announced Friday as the president-
elect of the International Neuropsychological Society, a worldwide, nonprofit organization.
Russell Bauer, professor and chairman of the Department 
of Clinical and Health Psychology in UF’s College of Public 
Health and Health Professions, is the fourth UF faculty mem-
ber elected to the presidency of INS in its 42-year history, ac-cording to a UF press release.
Now president-elect, Bauer will become incoming presi-
dent in February, and will begin his one-year term as presi-dent of the INS in early 2011. As president-elect, he will take on more decision-making responsibilities, such as develop-ing research programs, which he said are important to the field of neuropsychology. He will also help with the biannual 
meetings held in different world locations. 
One challenge of the job, he said, will be encouraging neu-
ropsychological researchers to think creatively.
“I hope the research ends in a better way of translating results to patients,” Bauer said, adding that he is excited to 
travel and work with colleagues from around the world.
Bauer, who directed UF’s clinical psychology doctoral 
program, said he hopes his presidency will draw attention to UF. Michael Perri, interim dean at UF’s College of Public 
Health and Health Professions, said Bauer’s expertise in neu-
ropsychological studies make him an excellent candidate. 
“The INS will benefit greatly 
from Bauer’s perspective as a re-searcher, educator and clinician,” Perri said.
Stephen Rao, INS’s incoming 
president, said Bauer’s leadership has propelled the society. 
“Bauer has a good feel on what’s important in the neu-
ropsychological department and how it can further progress worldwide,” he said.

Gainesville citizen Ramon Trujillo was “tickled 
pink” at the reception of his comments by Gaines-
ville’s Community Development Committee meet-ing Monday night.
Following citizen complaints, including those by 
Trujillo, the committee discussed growth manage-ment issues and landlord licensing fees.
“These are nuts and bolts tasks planned on a mu-
nicipal level,” said Trujillo. “Although those elected 
steer the meeting, representation 
from the community can give in-
put.”
According to Assistant City 
Manager Fred Murry, Gainesville 
doesn’t have the authority to 
charge licensing fees on multiple-family units of five or more fami-lies because this authority belongs 
to the Division of Hotels and Restaurants.
The licensing fee discussion was deferred until 
the next meeting scheduled Aug. 24, because Com-missioner Scherwin Henry who handled the issue was absent. The committee also addressed the need 
for new sidewalks in eastside communities, creating 
more sewage outlets in newly developed areas, qual-ity control checks on redevelopment projects and en-hancing transportation services such as RTS.Commissioners

AYNAK, Afghanistan — Afghan 
villagers had complained to the U.S. 
Marines for days: The police are the problem, not the Taliban. They steal from villagers and beat them. Days 
later, the Marines learned firsthand 
what the villagers meant.
As about 150 Marines and Af-
ghan soldiers approached the police headquarters in the Helmand River town of Aynak, the police fired four gunshots at the combined force. No larger fight broke out, but once in-side the headquarters the Marines found a raggedy force in a decrepit 
mud-brick compound that the po-
lice used as an open-pit toilet.
The meeting was tense. Some 
police were smoking pot. Others loaded their guns in a threatening manner near the Marines.
The U.S. troops ousted the police two days later and installed a better trained force they had brought with them on their recently launched operation into southern Helmand. The original force was sent away for 
several weeks of training the U.S. is con-ducting across 
Afghanistan to professionalize the country’s police. But the encounter, witnessed last week by The Asso-ciated Press, highlights one of the largest problems facing the interna-tional effort to stabilize Afghanistan in the face of an increasingly violent Taliban insurgency: the need for competent, trustworthy police.
Afghans across the country com-
plain bitterly about the country’s police, whose junior ranks earn only about $150 a month. Police pad their salaries by demanding bribes at checkpoints or kickbacks to in-vestigate complaints, and police in opium poppy-growing regions turn a blind eye to drug smuggling for a cut of the profits, many Afghans complain.
The role of the local police is es-
pecially sensitive in Helmand prov-ince, the center of the lucrative opi-um poppy industry and a Taliban stronghold. A goal of the ongoing 
U.S. military operation is to restore 
Afghan government control — which requires a disciplined police force that commands public respect.
Over the past year, the Interior 
Ministry has tried to overhaul the police, and dozens of corrupt offi-cials have been fired. Sotomayor 
faces critics
THE ASSOCIATED PRESS
WASHINGTON — It’s a delicate chore. Repub-
licans, seeing their best chance to make big points 
with the American public since Barack Obama won the White House, are trying to strike just the right balance in criticizing Sonia Sotomayor without 
alienating Hispanics and women.
For much of the day Monday, Sotomayor’s first 
day before the Senate panel weighing her Supreme 
Court nomination, Republicans praised her per-
sonal story and accomplishments. They directed their fiercest fire 
not toward the judge but toward Obama and his comment — made before nominating her — that he 
wanted a justice with “the quality 
of empathy.”
“The Hispanic element of this 
hearing is important, but I don’t want it to be lost — this is mostly 
about liberal and conservative politics,” said Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C.
He predicted that Sotomayor, who would be the 
first Latina on the high court, would be confirmed 
“barring a meltdown.” He even signaled it might be 
with his vote, since “President Obama won the elec-tion, and I respect that.”
Still, it’s tough for the GOP to separate the judge’s 
personal characteristics from the debate over her confirmation. The scene in the packed Capitol Hill hearing room reinforced that point. The all-white, all-male Republican contingent on the Judiciary Committee faced an accomplished Hispanic woman 
with a broken ankle.NATIONAL

CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla.  — 
Thunderstorms once again forced 
NASA to call off the launch of 
space shuttle Endeavour on Mon-
day, the fifth delay for the space station construction mission.
NASA said it would try again 
early Wednesday evening, after taking a one-day break.
In a scene nearly identical to 
Sunday, launch managers halted the countdown just minutes be-
fore Endeavour and seven astro-
nauts were supposed to blast off in the early evening.
This time, storms packed with 
lightning popped up on opposite sides of the launching site, one after the other, close enough to violate NASA’s safety rules.
Endeavour has been grounded 
for an entire month now, first by leaks, then storms.
“The weather has just bitten 
us again,” launch director Pete 
Nickolenko informed command-
er Mark Polansky and his crew aboard Endeavour. “So sorry about that.”
“We understand,” Polansky 
replied. “That’s the nature of our business and like I said before, when the time is right, we’ll be here, we’ll be ready.”
If the shuttle isn’t flying soon, it will have to wait until July 26 so Russia can launch supplies to 
the space station. As it is, NASA 
will have to rearrange the astro-nauts’ schedule in orbit if they launch Wednesday. A final try on 
Thursday — not yet approved — 
would mean eliminating one of the five planned spacewalks and shortening the flight.
Endeavour needs to be out 
of the way before Russia’s un-manned cargo ship can dock.
This was the third day in a row 
that thunderstorms prevented Endeavour from blasting off with the final piece of Japan’s space station lab.
Back in June, hydrogen gas 
leaks stalled two launch at-tempts.
The only technical concern 
Monday was a loose cover on a 
shuttle thruster. NASA said it 
would secure the cover before Wednesday’s try to prevent rain from getting into the thruster.
Endeavour holds the third and 
final segment of Japan’s enor-mous $1 billion space station lab, named Kibo, or Hope.
It’s a porch for experiments 
that need to be exposed to the vacuum of space.
The shuttle also is loaded with 
large spare parts for the space 
station and hundreds of pounds 
of food for the six station resi-dents.
When the shuttle astronauts 
arrive at the space station, they will make up the biggest crowd ever in a single place in orbit: 13 people.
Forecasters expect a 60 per-
cent chance of favorable weather for Wednesday’s try, scheduled for 6:03 p.m.

Politics without Palin lacks hilaritySupremely Fair
Race doesn’t affect 
Sotomayor’s decisions
63% YES
37% NO
270 TOTAL VOTESToday’s question: Is Sonia Sotomayor fit to be on the Supreme Court?Thursday’s question: Should Dove World Outreach Center remove its “Islam is of the Devil” sign?When a judge is nominated for the Supreme Court, 
the nitpicking invariably begins.
For Sonia Sotomayor, however, the nitpicking 
seems a little more personal than political.
Democrats, and Sotomayor herself, are relying too much 
on the whole “It’s the American Dream” strategy (see Obama, Barack for reference as to how this rhetorical scheme 
generates empathy and awe), and the main criticisms of the 
Republicans who oppose her are based on previous public statements about being a “wise Latina” that suggest, to them, that she would act with “inappropriate empathy” to groups that she is partial to or is affiliated with.
The job of a Supreme Court justice is to apply the law, not 
to make it. So, to say that Sotomayor is unfit for the bench because she has given preferential treatment to either his-panics or to Democrats would be a fair criticism. However, 
the Editorial Board cannot find any evidence that Sotomayor 
has any agenda that can be classified under a masthead read-ing “Democrat” or “Republican,” or that she’s shown blatant “sympathy” to minority groups because of her race.
When Sotomayor was on the 2nd District Court of Ap-
peals, she ruled against the plaintiffs in Ricci v. DeStefano, a case about reverse discrimination. Sotomayor said that New Haven’s fire department did not have the right to base pro-motions on a written test, because written tests dispropor-
tionately favor Caucasians. Those who oppose her nomina-
tion say that Sotomayor was wrong to not add her own legal analysis to the case (and want to point to the fact that she, oh my God, protected minorities in the workplace). However, this was not a ‘gimme’ to the African-Americans who failed 
the test, or a cop out on her part, but rather an indication 
that she firmly believes in Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964.
In Pappas v. Giuliani she dissented from the majority and 
protected employee’s rights to send racist e-mails without fear of termination because the First Amendment protects offensive and hateful speech. It doesn’t sound to us like Soto-mayor is coddling minorities and eschewing her responsibil-ity to uphold the Constitution. It sounds like race is second-
ary in her decision making.
Sotomayor may be proud of her Latina heritage and vo-
cal about her status as a minority, but her rulings in those 
cases show that her affiliation as a minority does not taint 
her rulings from the bench. That should be the only concern 
of naysayers. Period.
Perhaps Democrats would be better off reminding people 
how she has shown no preference to minorities in past rul-ings so as to leave Republicans with little to no other ammo. 
Instead, expect more nitpicking about the implications of 
her race to flood the Senate Judiciary Committee as hearings proceed. It would be nice to think that race doesn’t enter the equation, but we definitely remember how Bush deliberated 
about appointing Clarence Thomas after only a few months 
on the federal bench so as not to use him as a replacement for Thurgood Marshall and be accused of tokenism.
On the other hand, if “being Latina” is the biggest dirt 
Republicans can dig up on the Princeton and Yale grad, it 
looks like Sotomayor will get the appointment (given that 
she doesn’t, like, become roommates with Jane Roe in the next few days).Column
So I refuse to be the only one who doesn’t give my two cents about this Palin resignation.
Let me just say that I’m overjoyed. Seriously. 
Like a kid on Christmas.
There are so many possible reasons for Palin’s resig-
nation, and each of them thrills me. Is she going to run for president? Did she resign just ahead of a scandal? Is 
she going to cash in on some of that reality TV money 
that’s been thrown at her by the soul-stealers known as television executives? Whatever her reason, Sarah Palin is the hot topic right now. And the world, it seems, is her oyster.
On July 26, Palin will no longer be the most powerful 
woman in Alaska. I mean that only in a political sense. I’m sure she will probably remain the only Alaskan woman who can strangle a bear or beat Putin at arm 
wrestling. 
But, she will no longer be governor, and I imagine 
that to be a bittersweet day for Alaskan Democrats and 
Republicans alike. She’s brought fantastic exposure to a place that, frankly, many Americans just plain forget 
exists. One can only imagine Alaska will become as ob-
scure as Hawaii, Arkansas or North Dakota.
Palin herself has been charmingly vague about her 
plans, only telling the public that she wants to stay to 
some degree involved in politics. She said that she will 
stump for any candidate who shares her small-govern-ment, maverick values — even conservative Democrats! No offense to the Alaskan Amazon, but I can hardly imagine that any Democrat would appreciate her sup-
port, given her dismal approval ratings among Demo-
crats and Independents alike.
No, if Palin wants to stay involved in politics, it will have to be without straying far from the conservative base that, like Dr. Frankenstein, created and 
let her loose her upon us all.
Perhaps we’ll get very lucky 
and be graced with an Obama-
Palin race for the White House in 
2012. I can’t imagine a better sce-
nario — especially since I support 
Obama.
I don’t know what advice Palin has been listening 
to, but unless Obama decides to kick a baby on national 
TV, she can’t win. What she can do, though, is provide 
hours of entertainment in the form of uninformed an-swers, bizarre segues and slightly cougarish winks. And wouldn’t that be worth it? America needs to laugh 
again.
While this scenario is appealing — as is the prospect 
of a scandal — what I’m saying my evening prayers for 
is a Palin reality show. “Maverick Knows Best”? “Survi-vor: Alaska”? Maybe she’ll even make a guest appear-
ance on an episode of “Trading Spouses.
 There is a lot of money and fame being dangled in 
front of that small town girl, as well as an escape from 
the lonely political world where David Letterman 
mocks you. 
Who could blame her for taking that train to reality 
superstardom? Certainly, she has sufficient talent for 
it.
For now we’ll wait, and watch, and hope that Palin 
will stay visible. I can’t imagine America without her.

FreeCreditReport.com, the credit-report-
ing service owned by Experian, recently released its latest TV commercial in its 
ubiquitous “guy sings about his bad credit” ad campaign, which raises an important ques-
tion: How the hell are these ads still on TV?
Don’t get me wrong. The FreeCred-
itReport.com commercials, from an advertis-
ing standpoint, are incredibly well-executed. The lyrics are clever; the songs become in-stant earworms and most everybody I know has a favorite spot (mine’s the one with the bi-cycles). It’s no wonder why Experian poured upward of $70 million into the Web site’s ad-
vertising budget in 2007.
The Martin Agency, FreeCreditReport.
com’s ad agency, has undoubtedly created an 
amazingly effective ad campaign. It’s also cre-ated one of the most unethical ad campaigns in recent memory.
The context: In 2003, the FACT Act was 
signed into law, which entitled consumers to a free annual credit report from the three major consumer credit reporting agencies, Equifax, TransUnion and Experian. To com-ply with the law, the three agencies and the Federal Trade Commission established An-
nualCreditReport.com. Unfortunately, An-
nualCreditReport.com was woefully under-publicized, leaving many consumers vaguely aware of their right to a credit report but not having any real idea of how to go about get-ting it.
Enter FreeCreditReport.com. With a del-
uge of TV commercials that sought to posi-tion it as the prima facie free credit report 
Web site, the company successfully preyed 
upon consumers’ ignorance of the law and exploited consumers’ fears about hackers and identity theft. Of course, FreeCreditReport.com’s credit reports aren’t actually free. At the end of most of the commercials, an announcer hurriedly says, “Offer applies with enroll-ment in Triple Advantage,” the Web site’s $14.95 per month cred-it-monitoring service. In essence, it’s like say-ing, “Free Cinnamon 
Toast Crunch! Offer applies with purchase of 
the box.”
And consumers have been hoodwinked. 
The Federal Trade Commission’s Web site 
warns against “imposter” Web sites and released a series of web public service an-nouncements that parody FreeCreditReport.com’s ads, dorky singing guitarist and all. 
This isn’t to say that consumers duped by 
FreeCreditReport.com are blameless. This 
information is readily available with a quick 
Google search, and consumers shouldn’t blindly follow financial advice from some guy on TV — let alone one dressed like a pirate.
But it’s rare that an advertising campaign 
so flagrantly acts in bad faith and treats con-sumers with such overt contempt. Even though they’re lighthearted, they manipulate and amplify very real fears of stolen identity and future unemployment. Catchy, rhyming fear-mongering, after all, is still fear-monger-ing. And building a business predicated on your consumers’ ignorance is simply mean-
spirited.
College students should be particularly 
offended. In a 2008 New York Times article, 
Mike Dean, a marketing executive at Experi-an, said that the idea behind the ads are to ap-peal to a young crowd. “[W]e were targeting a younger audience,” he said. “That’s exactly what we’ve received with that: we have a lot younger demographic coming into our site.” 
Gee, thanks, Mike.FreeCreditReport.com’s marketing prac-
tices are entirely unscrupulous, and the Mar-tin Agency — an agency whose others ads, like those for GEICO, I love — should be ashamed of its complicity in it. Both deserve all the scorn we can muster.

Population issues must be addressedGuest column
None of the crises we face today 
— whether it is the food crisis, the water crisis, the financial 
crisis or the crisis of climate change  —  can be managed unless greater atten-
tion is paid to population issues.
World Population Day, which was  
July 11, was the right time to put the 
population issue back on the radar screen. And it’s not a moment too soon. By 2050 our global population of 6.8 billion people could grow to the United Nation’s median projection of 
nine billion, or even soar to 11 billion.
But what’s not widely realized is 
that the projection of nine billion glob-
al population is based on a substantial reduction in fertility in the least devel-oped countries, which would require a dramatic increase in voluntary fam-ily planning.
Recently we heard President Ba-
rack Obama, in his address from 
Cairo, say that denying a woman her education is de-
nying her equal-ity. I would add another area 
that is vital for broadening women’s 
horizons. Governments agree it is nec-
essary to approve access to sexual and reproductive health. This is essential for advancing women’s empower-ment and levels of equality.
Some 200 million women today 
want to plan and space their births but lack access to safe and effective con-
traception. According to the latest fig-
ures, just one in four married women in the least developed countries are using modern contraception.
It is important to note that invest-
ments in women and reproductive health are not only important for over-coming poverty, they are also cost-ef-fective. For example, an investment in contraceptive services can be recouped 
four times over — and sometimes dra-matically more over the long run — by 
reducing the need for public spending on health, education, housing, sanita-tion and other social services.
That’s why the International Con-
ference on Population and Develop-ment proposed a plan 15 years ago in Cairo to ensure universal access to re-productive health by 2015, a goal that now seems out of reach.
It is also important to work toward 
maternal health. The sad and shocking truth is that maternal mortality repre-
sents the largest health inequity in the 
world. With the financial crisis and the reduction in budgets for health, solving these problems will be even harder.
Clearly we need to do more to im-
prove women’s health.

Sign not displayed ‘in spirit of love’
I agree with Pastor Jones of the Dove World 
Outreach Center. A Christian does have to 
agree with his sign, which reads “Islam is of 
the Devil.”
Also, God does call Christians to preach 
what Christ believes as truth. However, the 
method of preaching doesn’t have to involve 
displaying such signs.
That method reminds me of the persons 
yelling truth and lies in the middle of the Tur-
lington courtyard.
God taught Christians to preach his beliefs 
in a spirit of love. It is time for us Christians to rise above these acts we copy during political campaigns believing that Christ has our back, because he doesn’t.

 With bed bug season in full swing, UF 
said it’s time to turn up the heat.
Researchers at UF have engineered a low-
cost method to treat bed bug infestations us-
ing heat, according to a study published in 
this month’s issue of the Journal of Economic 
Entomology.
Using 8-by-4-foot plastic and foam panels, 
they constructed a chamber big enough to ﬁ  t over a king-size bed, said entomologist Phil Koehler, a professor with UF’s Institute of Food and Agricultural Sciences.
Inside, they put two heaters, two fans for 
circulation and the items that needed treat-
ment. Using digital thermometers, they wait-
ed until the temperature reached 113 degrees Fahrenheit, the ideal temperature needed to kill every last bloodsucker.
“This is like cooking a turkey,” he said. 
“You don’t take the turkey out of the oven until it has reached a certain temperature and it’s cooked.”
Moisture-resistant mattresses in the dorms 
are made of plastic and do not allow the crit-ters to crawl, making it a bad environment for bed bugs, according to Wayne Walker, senior pest control technician for the department of housing and residence education. 
However, infestations do occur in gradu-ate and family-housing units. 
At a conference in Baltimore, Md., this 
month, Walker met with residence represen-tatives from universities nationwide to dis-cuss the topic.
“Some people said they had 10 to 12 calls 
in one week,” Walker said. “UF does not get 10 to 12 calls in one year.”
But Koehler said students living off cam-
pus call him almost every day. He said they 
risk invasions when they buy used furniture, 
especially beds.
“You get a bargain,” he said. “You get a 
mattress and bed bugs.”
The process takes from two to four hours 
and is completely effective if done correctly, said Roberto Pereira, study co-author and as-sociate research scientist at the entomology and nematology department. 
The purpose of this study is to treat infes-
tations in intimate areas like beds and cloth-ing without spraying insecticides, Pereira said. 
“The big problem is that bed bugs are 
lazy, and they like to live in places close to where they feed,” Koehler said. “They come out around 3 or 4 in the morning and suck your blood while you’re sleeping.”
Pest control operators have tried using 
heat treatments that cost $20,000 to $50,000 and warm the entire room, he said. Not only is it too expensive, but it also takes more than a day.
In addition, the use of pesticides is inefﬁ  -
cient because bed bugs have claws instead of sticky pads on their legs. They do not absorb insecticides as other insects do.
He said the equipment used to create the 
portable oven cost about $312 and is practi-cal for areas that are hard to vacate such as homeless shelters, hospitals and hotels.
Koehler described a case where a paraple-
gic’s wheelchair was infested. He could not move his legs or feel the bites, and being ex-posed to chemicals would have been harm-ful for his health. He said the heat chamber is ideal in these types of situations.
Pereira said they decided not to patent or 
license the system so that it would be readily accessible to pest control operators. 
Walker said the technology is an integral 
part of the UF treatment program, and he uses pesticides in switch plates and tricky ar-eas while the chamber cooks the bugs.
Adult bed bugs are about the size of an ap-ple seed and the thickness of a business card, 
he said, and they expand when they feed.
The newborns, on the other hand, are 
about the size of a period at the end of a sen-
tence in 11-point font. They are hard to spot because they are dark mahogany and trans-parent, he said.
They do not walk or ﬂ  y, but they are 
skilled hitchhikers, catching rides on mov-able objects such as luggage, clothing and 
even laptops, according to Walker.
A female can lay three to ﬁ  ve eggs per day, 
and it takes about eight to 10 days for them to 
hatch, he said. If they have a food source, bed bugs can reach adulthood in about 30 days. This can lead to infestations of more than 200 bugs in three months.
Although some people are unresponsive 
to their bites, reactions involve itching and ir-
ritation, Walker said.
“The idea of sleeping in a bed with them 
is what affects people psychologically,” he 
said.
But Pereira said they are safer than mos-
quitoes because they don’t transmit diseases.
Bed bugs do not discriminate between hu-
man hosts and infest every social class and nation across the globe, Walker said.
“You can ﬁ  nd them in thousand-dollar 
hotel rooms and homeless shelters and every place in between,” he said. “It has nothing to do with cleanliness.”

� THE COMPANY MAY HAVE TO 
FIRE 165 EMPLOYEES.
 THE ASSOCIATED PRESS 
  
 BOSTON — Massachusetts law-
makers said Monday they would try 
to restore $4 million in state funds 
for two local zoos after operators suggested that without the money, animals might have to be destroyed 
— a claim the governor called a scare 
tactic.
Zoo New England, which runs 
the Franklin Park Zoo in Boston and the companion Stone Zoo in sub-
urban Stoneham, warned late last 
week that if the cuts stood, it would be forced to lay off most of its 165 employees and some of its 1,000 ani-
mals could possibly have to be eu-
thanized. It stepped back from that claim 
over the weekend, saying “there are 
no plans for the zoo to euthanize any 
animals in the collection as a result of the budget cuts,” but that failed to quell the resulting fury. 
Gov. Deval Patrick sent out as-
surances that no animal would be killed or was ever truly threatened with euthanasia.
He said the zoo had responded to 
the cut “by spreading inaccurate and incen-diary information.”
“Nobody has ever 
been talking about shutting the op-erations down and euthanizing the animals, and I think it was unhelpful and irresponsible to suggest other-wise,” Patrick said Monday.  Patrick 
had included the cuts among $147 
million he vetoed from the $27 bil-lion budget. Euthanasia scare may 
elicit funds for zoos
This  Week  in  Gainesville  History
 By KATHERINE BEIN 
July 15, 1997:
  A patient remains in stable condition after undergoing 
the ﬁ  rst-ever spinal tissue implant performed by university 
neurosurgeons at Shands at UF.
Human embryonic spinal cells were injected directly into 
an injury-induced cavity in the patient’s spinal cord. Studies 
have shown that such procedures have helped cats regain 
movement in previously paralyzed limbs. 
“Our primary goal in this ﬁ  rst clinical experiment is to 
test whether these grafts can survive,” said UF neurosur-geon Richard Fessler, “and, if so, to what extent they can ﬁ  ll the cavity.”
Researchers view the experimental procedure as an im-portant milestone in developing future treatments aimed at restoring even partial use of paralyzed limbs and organs.
The patient is the ﬁ  rst of 10 slated to undergo surgery as 
part of a four-year pilot study by the university.  
July 17, 1975: 
 Gainesville Police Department installs a $44,000 word 
processing machine in hopes of increasing efﬁ  ciency of po-lice reports and cutting ofﬁ  cer hours spent on paper work. 
Ofﬁ  cers call a number that connects them with one of the 
machine’s four “dial input system recorders” and are then 
able to dictate, review and correct portions of their report.
Reports are then typed out in longhand by secretaries 
whose only job is to monitor the machine.
The processor is housed in part of the old GPD jail, com-plete with carpeted walls and an acoustically tiled ceiling. 
Portable devices allow ofﬁ  cers to create reports while still on 
the scene, although they are not equipped with car units.
“The system enhances the product of this department 
(and its) service to the community,”
 Lt. Robert Mitchell said.

named Ole Poochy.
Lassoed while roaming amongst the cattle of UF’s agri-
cultural station, Ole Poochy was held in protective custody 
by Gainesville police until his release into one of the many 
ponds on campus.
“He is without a doubt the ﬁ  ghtingest gator alive,”  police 
Lt. V.K. Holliman remarks. “The big problem is that bed bugs 
are lazy, and they like to live in

A visit to Indonesia by Secretary 
of State Hillary Clinton in March 
has spurred UF President Bernie Machen and other university heads to travel there to foster relation-
ships with their universities.
Machen will focus on arranging 
collaborations in the areas of agri-
culture, sustainability and urban planning, he wrote in an e-mail.
About 20 universities, universi-
ty systems and colleges in the U.S. will be represented, said Terance Bigalke, director of education at 
the East-West Center — based in 
Hawaii — which  helped organize the trip.
Institutions represented include 
Cornell University, the Univer-sity of Michigan and Miami-Dade Community College, the nation’s largest community college.
The trip will run from July 26 to 
Aug. 1 and could include visits to educational facilities in four differ-ent cities, including Jakarta, the na-tion’s capital, Bigalke said.
In addition to research partner-ships, UF is interested in promot-ing student exchange between UF and Indonesian universities. Last fall, UF had four foreign students from Indonesia, down from 15 in 1998, according to UF’s Web site.
Bigalke said one of the main 
goals of the trip is to double the number of stu-dents exchanged between the two 
countries.
About 8,000 
Indonesians are 
currently study-
ing in the U.S., 
while fewer than 200 Americans are studying in Indonesia, he said.
The Indonesian government, 
aided by private donors, is paying the expenses of the visitors while they are in the country.
UF will have to pay for Ma-
chen’s plane ticket, however, which will likely cost about $3,000, Big-alke said. UF spokeswoman Janine Sikes said part of UF’s costs will be paid by a sponsor.
Machen’s trip is preceded by 
one to Iran in November with other university presidents.TUESDAY, JULY 14, 2009 � ALLIGATOR, 9
Machen
Machen goes abroadof why his grandson Luke and 
granddaughter Claire will grow up without a mother.
Writing in a small Anglican 
church in Milton, Conn., Goens 
used a quiet balcony to focus his 
thoughts and express his emo-tions.
“It helped me heal by writ-
ing this story to go through the journey of the death of my daughter,” he said. “Even if it wasn’t published it would have been worthwhile for me to get 
through that tragedy.”
Goens’ article was published 
Feb. 18, 2007, in The New York 
Times, almost three years after Betsy’s death.
He was not informed of the 
plagiarism until he was contact-ed by The Independent Florida Alligator for an interview.
The passage that Mac Arthur 
took from Goens’ story, “Gener-ations: A daughter’s death, and a quest for answers,” read: 
“The collision of life and 
death tossed me and those close to me into a cascade of disbe-lief, fear, anger, confusion and grief.... At that moment, as the 
crushing weight of death de-
scended upon all of us, I prom-ised my sweet daughter that I would seek justice for this trag-edy. I would find the answers, hold people accountable.”
The passage that appeared 
in Mac Arthur’s story about a Colorado woman who died in childbirth titled “Grief over pregnant mother’s death over-whelms family,” read:
“The collision of life and 
death plays out in this nonde-script home at the end of the cul-de-sac in a quiet northeast Colorado Springs neighbor-hood. King stares blankly... Mike King stands up, carrying the weight of a man tossed into a cascade of disbelief, despair 
and depression... the crush-
ing weight of death descended upon her family, her friends, the entire second floor of Memorial Hospital North.”
This fall, Mac Arthur will en-
ter her third year as a journalism and economics major. A meeting is scheduled for Wednesday to 
discuss the consequences of her 
actions, which might include ex-pulsion from the journalism col-lege, according to John Wright, dean of the college.
“We at least want to have a 
chance to talk to her,” Wright said. “I’ve said before, we de-plore plagiarism of any kind.”
To encourage integrity, stu-
dents in the College of Journal-ism and Communications are re-quired to take an ethics course.
“The community is supposed to trust you to give them factual and truthful information,” said April Dudash, president of the UF Chapter of the Society of Professional Journalists. “How can you be a journalist if you’re willing to lie and steal?”
Goens said he would like to 
speak to Mac Arthur and un-derstands the consequences she could face.
“I’m not interested in any 
kind of retribution or punish-ment,” he said. “I just want the person to own up to the mistake they’ve made and make better 
decisions in the future.”
Colorado Springs Gazette 
Editor Jeff Thomas said there 
has never been plagiarism of this magnitude at the publication.
Mac Arthur’s plagiarism 
will not have any reflection on the Gazette’s opinion of UF, he said.
“We all think that the Uni-
versity of Florida program is fine, and Hailey is a gifted young person and reporter, but we hope she is able to own this point in her life and move for-ward, and we wish her the best,” he said, adding that he would be pleased to receive applications 
from UF students. 
Mac Arthur was not avail-
able for comment.
Editor’s note: Steve Johnson is 
a second-year journalism student.

people repair their own bikes. 
So far a total of 12 bikes have been 
repaired according to Johnny Zoko-
vitch, founder of the Gainesville 
Catholic Worker House, which he 
runs out of his private home.
Zokovitch thinks it is a great 
thing the former UF students and The Kickstand employees are do-
ing, he said.
“It showed a lot of initiative on 
their parts to address a need that is really apparent to people who are 
homeless,” he said. “These bikes will help people who are trying to help themselves get back on the path to self-sufficiency and get out of poverty.”
Zokovitch shared a story of a 
homeless minister who received a bicycle on Monday. 
“He ministers to those who are 
less fortunate than he is,” Zoko-vitch said. “The camp sites that he goes to are far apart, but now this bike will make it easier for him to bring them supplies.” 
Nam Nguyen, the UF alumnus 
who bought the bikes, said he saw the listing for the unwanted bikes 
on Craigslist and thought it would be a good opportunity to help people. 
“The bikes only cost us about $5 
or $6 a piece,” he said. “But I figured people would appreciate the bike a lot more [than $5 or $6] because this gives a form of transportation to people who can’t afford it.” Zokovitch said it was good in-
stinct on their part to satisfy a need that is overlooked. 
“People usually think food, 
clothing and blankets as things homeless people need, but a bike is a real upgrade in a person’s ability to be able to make changes in their lives,” he said. 
“For [the homeless] the bike rep-
resented a real sense of possibility and hope.”
Kelly Jones, one of the former UF 
students helping with the bike proj-ect, thanked The Kickstand for pro-viding them with the time, space, supplies and expertise they needed to repair the bikes. 
Rajeeb Das, board member of 
The Kickstand, said that the com-munity bike shop was started to help people like Nguyen and Jones and those who receive help from the Gainesville Catholic Worker House. 
“That’s exactly why we exist,” 
Das said, “to help people like them, who don’t know how to fix a bike or have the resources to do it.” 
Kickstand board member praises student initiative
Clark said. “We look forward to continuing to work with EMI and coming to a resolu-tion that works out well for both of us.”
Patrick Pagano of UF’s Digital World’s 
Institute said both EMI and Grooveshark have valid points.
“I almost see it from both sides because 
I’m a musician and a producer as well as an educator. If someone steals a piece of mu-sic from me, I’m going to be mad,” Pagano said.
On that point, Pagano feels Grooveshark 
may have crossed some lines.
“I think any business has the right to ex-
ist, but if they infringe upon the copyrights of other organizations, then no,” Pagano said.
But Pagano also believes American pub-
lic has little sympathy for companies such as EMI at this point.
“They keep changing the format of music and wanting you to buy it again,” he said. 
”The big conglomerates are selling all this new stuff and then turning around and acting shocked that people are sharing it.” 
The companies will 
probably settle out of court 
for a large fine, Pagano said. 
However, he said that it 
is too soon to tell whether it will be a slap on the wrist or whether it will put the company out of business.
“You have a big company. You have a little 
company. [Grooveshark has] actually done something inappropriate, and [EMI is] going to make them pay,” Pagano said.
Westermann-Clark agrees the lawsuit could 
be dangerous to the companies existence.
“Basically, we want to give all content 
owners the best possible deal we can without completely bankrupting Grooveshark in the process,” he said.
Large settlement could put Grooveshark out of businessbicycle , from page 1

POLL QUESTION ONLINE UP NEXT IN OUR LIST OF TOP 10 ATHLETESBy ADAM BERRY
Alligator Staff Writer
aberry@alligator.org
Amid another round of specu-
lation about his future, which 
seems to become a topic of debate every few months, Urban Meyer once again restated his commit-
ment to UF.
Saturday, Meyer made an ap-
pearance at the 15th Bob Dooley 
Invitational, a golf tournament that benefits STOP! Children’s Cancer, and spoke to those in attendance. During the speech, Meyer ad-dressed the latest rumors, which he described as “nonsense,” that 
came about as a result of a con-
troversial column in The Mobile (Ala.) Press-Register.
“I’m not going to Notre Dame. 
Ever,” Meyer said at the event, ac-cording to The Gainesville Sun. “I’m going to be the coach at Flor-ida for a long time, as long as they want me.”
Meyer’s contract with UF is 
good through 2013, but he has previously referred to Notre Dame as his “dream job.” He was an as-sistant coach in South Bend, Ind., for five years under Lou Holtz, but he chose UF over Notre Dame in 2004.
The rumors of Meyer’s depar-
ture after this season were most re-
cently stoked by Paul Finebaum’s 
column in the Press-Register on Tuesday. Finebaum wrote that, 
despite Meyer’s stated desire to 
remain at UF, he will be leaving for Notre Dame after this coming season and repeatedly called the coach’s character into question.
Former UF coach Steve Spurri-
er previously fueled the fire by dis-cussing the rumors in May during a radio interview, ironically on the Paul Finebaum Radio Network. 
Whether Meyer eventually 
leaves for Notre Dame or stays at UF until his coaching career comes to an end, his words will reassure players, boosters and recruits of 
Harrison Diamond / Alligator Staff
UF coach Urban Meyer once again denied rumors Saturday that he will leave Gainesville to become Notre 
Dame’s coach. Meyer has a contract with the Gators through 2013 and called the rumors “nonsense.”

Since this list has to do with enjoying the

been very difficult for me to see a thing, even 
if I was fortunate enough to enjoy the emo-tions of everyone around. On the flip side, it gains points for the revelation that would come out later: Tiger played with an injured ACL. It certainly isn’t new for Woods to cap-ture the hearts of sports fans as he seemingly has the ability to make every clutch shot as it is needed, including do-or-die putts on the 18th hole Sunday and Monday to extend the tour-nament and deny Me-diate a victory. While the setup for Mon-day’s 18-hole playoff could’ve been bad — a 
two-man stroke-play 
showdown has the possibility of turning into a win by 1,000 paper cuts — it was amazing here. The big-
gest lead was Woods by three after 10 holes, and yet Mediate came back to even things be-fore Woods clinched it on the 19th.

My desire to not overemphasize recent

one’s spot in the rankings. Watching these videos over again in the last few days still evokes the emotions — disbelief and amaze-ment. At the time, these races were even more Top 10 Games I Wish I Saw Live, Pt. IIIn every college football off-season, 
there are five days worth circling on the calendar. 
Three of those — National Signing 
Day, the start of spring practice and the spring game — are well behind us. The fifth, the start of two-a-days, is still about three weeks away. 
The other, however, is today: the re-
lease of EA Sports’ annual NCAA Foot-ball video game. 
This year’s edition, NCAA Football 
10, promises more improvements – I saw a list online of 27 specific advance-
ments this year’s game has made over 
last year’s. Some are interesting, but most are ridiculous.
The updates range from confus-
ingly broad (“more stadiums/stadi-um updates”) to just plain confusing (“procedural awareness”), and from ultimately useless (“marching bands in the pregame, including some authentic team-specific ones”) to Erin Andrews. 
No, seriously, the Internet’s beloved 
Sideline Princess and UF alum will be featured as a sideline reporter and will help track the career of your created player in the “Road to Glory” mode.Early re-
ports say the Day 1 version of NCAA Football 
10 will need up-
dating due to the game shipping with rosters and player models that could best be described as 
“a disaster.” 
From what I’ve seen on EA’s Team-
builder site, several teams don’t have 
all of their new freshmen and still list 
some of their departed seniors. 
My favorite mistake is that the in-
game models of four of the nation’s best quarterbacks — Tim Tebow (aka “QB #15” per NCAA rules), Sam Brad-ford (“QB #14”), Colt McCoy (“QB #12”) and Jevan Snead (“QB #4”) — all look nearly identical, but none of them look like their real-life counterparts. 
That’s right up there with the fact that 
UF’s Pouncey twins don’t even look the same in the game. How do you mess NCAA Football 10 fills void

his commitment to UF.
Jamie Newberg, a recruiting analyst for Ri-
vals.com, said Meyer was wise to make such a 
public statement. 
Opposing coaches have already used the 
rumors to pull recruits away from the Gators.  
UF 2010 commit Matt Elam, the nation’s No. 
5 overall prospect, told Rivals.com he heard rumors during his recruitment that Meyer will leave Gainesville after the 2009 season. 
Many recruits could be swayed by the idea 
that they would be finishing their careers un-der another coach.
“You would think these kids pick schools 
because of the schools, but recruiting is about relationships,” Newberg said. “And that’s the main thing as to why kids pick schools: the re-lationships they build up with these coaches.”
Coaches have made similar statements 
about their future, however, including Ala-
bama coach Nick Saban. Then the Miami Dol-phins head coach, Saban said he would not be 
the Crimson Tide’s coach less than two weeks 
before accepting the Alabama job. 
“You never know, but I 
understand why he did it. 
It’s probably smart because they’re probably hearing a lot of feedback from kids that coaches are saying he’s gone, then you’ve got other coaches 
talking about it,” Newberg said. “It’s probably 
why he nipped it in the bud now rather than waiting until if and when a job opens up.”
Despite Meyer’s recent and firm denial, 
however, Newberg said the Gators’ two na-
tional championships in three years make Meyer a potential candidate for any job that opens up. 
So this likely won’t be the last time he will 
be the subject of rumors.
“Things will be floating around anyway, 
which is something that success brings,” New-berg said. “It’s something he’s always going to 
have to address.”Meyer’s reassurance will have strong impact on keeping future recruitsspectacular since each outcome 
(and therefore Michael Phelps’ historic quest for eight golds) was in doubt.  Jason Lezak’s mi-raculous comeback in the final 
leg of the relay was one of the 
most impressive anchor accom-plishments I’d ever seen. Follow that up with Phelps’ touch to save the quest in the 100m fly, and these Olympics were sim-ply amazing. He seemed to have lost after taking an extra stroke, but it paid off as he beat Milorad 
Cavic to the wall.

This will be engrained in my 
mind as the way Jordan should 
have ended his career. It was storybook perfect, swishing a jumper over Bryon Russell to clinch the Bulls’ sixth NBA title in eight years. He scored 45 and hit the game-winning basket with 5.2 seconds left. His Airness 
was all primed for the perfect 
conclusion with the snapshot of Jordan holding his wrist in the follow-through of his jumpshot. Did he push off of Russell? Sure. 
Did anyone care? Absolutely 
not. I never got a chance to see him play live — one of my big-gest regrets — and what better day than this?

This rain-filled, all-day affair 
ranks as the pinnacle of my ten-
nis-watching experience. It’s un-believable to me that 67 percent of respondents to a ESPN Sports-Nation poll voted this year’s final as better than last year. 
Federer-Nadal had so many 
more storylines even if it didn’t have 30 fifth-set games. This was clay-court specialist Nadal halting Federer’s attempt at a modern-era record sixth straight Wimbledon title. It was No. 2 (Nadal) stripping No. 1 (Feder-er) of his throne, the No. 1 world 
ranking that the Swiss star held 
for 237 consecutive weeks. The epic showdown lasted a record 4 hours, 48 minutes but felt like even more of a back-and-forth struggle due to the on-again, off-again rain (a good argument for the roof Wimbledon now 
has). Federer’s crushing defeat and Nadal’s career-changing victory ended more than seven 
hours after it first began. At the time, the match appeared to be the passing of the torch — that is, until Nadal was injured and Federer won this year’s French Open and Wimbledon to regain the top world ranking.

More than three years later, 
this game still resonates in my 
heart as the best college foot-
ball game ever, if not my favor-
ite sporting event. Remember when Vince Young was the talk of the nation, and not for his off-the-field despair? This was the former Texas quarterback in his prime, leading his team to a come-from-behind victory with a game-winning 8-yard touch-
down run into the corner of the 
end zone on a do-or-die 4th-and-5 with 19 seconds left fol-lowed by a rush to complete the two-point conversion. Don’t for-get: This was the USC dynasty at its highest point. The Trojans came into Pasadena riding Matt Leinart and Reggie Bush, both 
Heisman Trophy winners, to a 
34-game winning streak.that up? They’re identical twins!
An online update, if your con-
sole is connected to its correspond-
ing online service, will hopefully fix the mistakes before they even see the light of day.
Despite these mistakes, I would 
still be in line, spending money I really can’t afford to spend, to buy NCAA Football 10. (I say “I would” because it simply can’t be the case this year, as my Xbox 360 is currently down with its second 
red-ring failure in three years.)
For Gators fans, the NCAA 
Football series provides an op-
portunity to get an early glimpse, 
whether realistic or unrealistic, of 
this year’s team. 
I remember turning on NCAA 
Football 09 for the first time, play-ing an exhibition with UF and saying, “This is the greatest video game team of all time.” 
Despite my extreme hyperbole, 
there was some truth to that state-ment. In video game football, speed is king. It’s why everyone used to turn the fatigue setting off in Mad-den, play as the Atlanta Falcons, run pre-dogfighting Michael Vick around the field for 60 minutes like a man possessed and crush their opponents’ hopes, dreams and gameplans in the process.
Last season, the Gators had all 
kinds of speed at their disposal on the field and on your video game 
console of choice. 
Whether it was Percy Harvin’s 
ability to score whenever he had 
the ball or the secondary’s ability to read plays and break up passes, UF’s team speed was unrivaled across the country. 
NCAA Football 10’s player rat-
ings reflect that and predict more of the same, as no UF running back, 
wide receiver, safety or cornerback 
is below 90 in the speed rating. 
And in case you were wonder-
ing, it looks like Tebow is rated 99 overall, the highest possible in the game. Shocking, I know. 
I just hope they added a digital 
version of “The Promise” on the wall outside of The Swamp as one of their promised “stadium up-dates.”

Arturo Gatti, shown here on Jan. 28, 2006, was found dead in a Bra -
zil hotel room on Saturday, according to New Jersey officials.
THE ASSOCIATED PRESS
RIO DE JANEIRO — Police 
investigating the death of former 
boxing champion Arturo Gatti are working on the assumption his wife strangled him with her purse strap 
while he drunkenly slept. The wom-
an’s lawyer, however, insists she is innocent and was too “fragile” to kill a boxer.
Lead investigator Moises Teix-
eira told The Associated Press on Monday nothing is being ruled out but he is certain the woman acted by herself.
“It was technically impossible 
for a third person to have been in the flat,” where Gatti was found dead early Saturday, Teixeira said. “The investigation isn’t finished, but we continue to think she did this alone.”
Gatti’s 23-year-old Brazilian wife, 
Amanda Rodrigues, told investiga-
tors she awoke Saturday about 6 
a.m. to find her husband’s body in the apartment they rented in Porto de Galinhas, a seaside resort in northeastern Pernambuco state.
Rodrigues told police she had 
a fight with Gatti after dinner Fri-day night and he pushed her to the ground, resulting in minor injuries 
to her elbow and chin. Witnesses 
also reported to police the couple fought and that Gatti was drunk.
Rodrigues told police the 
37-year-old former junior welter-weight champion then got into a cab with their son and returned to their rented apartment, leaving her alone downtown.Teixeira said witnesses told po-
lice Gatti left his son to sleep in the apartment, then returned to the city center to find his wife. She arrived at the apartment before he did and waited for him. They then both went upstairs together.
Rodrigues told police she slept 
on the second floor of the apartment with her son, while Gatti slept on the first floor. She told police she awoke at 6 a.m. to feed her son and discov-ered her husband’s body. Police say he most likely had been killed at least four hours before that.
Teixeira said police do not think 
anyone else entered the apartment and killed Gatti — he said there were no signs of forced entry and electronic locks indicated nobody else had entered the room aside from Rodrigues and Gatti.
The investigator said Rodrigues 
told them she thought her husband had committed suicide or that some-one had entered the apartment and killed him. Teixeira ruled out both scenarios.
Rodrigues’ sister, Flavia, told the 
newspaper Folha de S. Paulo there is “no way she could have strangled a 
man of that size.”
Rodrigues’ attorney, Celio 
Avelino, told the AP he agreed with 
Flavia’s conclusion and he would request Amanda be freed from jail Tuesday pending the conclusion of the investigation.
“She is fragile, young and skinny 
— how could she kill a boxing cham-pion?” Avelino said. “When she awoke, she presumed he had com-mitted suicide. But she had nothing 
to do with it.”
Flavia Rodrigues said her sister 
told her she thought Gatti had com-
mitted suicide — though she said he knew of no reason the boxer would kill himself or why the pair fought the night before his death.
“Sure, they had fights,” Flavia 
said. “But he was crazy about her.”
The sister told Recife’s TV Jornal 
news station that “Amanda told us she didn’t kill Arturo, and we be-lieve her.”
“My sister, like us, is very reli-
gious and would be incapable of killing anyone,” Flavia said. “She found him already dead. It’s up to the police to discover what hap-
pened in the flat.”
The pair married in 2007 and ac-
cording to Rodrigues had a rocky 
relationship. Authorities were told the couple was extremely jealous of each other and that Gatti constantly complained about her clothing when she traveled to Brazil, police spokes-
woman Milena Saraiva said.
According to Brazilian law, police 
accuse a person of a crime but it is 
up to the prosecutor to formally file 
a charge. Teixeira said police have 
until July 22 to deliver their find-ings to the prosecutor’s office, but he hoped the investigation would be completed before then.
Police assume wife killed Gatti
THE ASSOCIATED PRESS
ORLANDO — The Orlando Magic have re-
tained backup center Marcin Gortat, matching the $34 million, five-year deal offered by the Dallas Mavericks to the restricted free agent.
The Magic made the announcement Mon-
day.
Gortat averaged 3.8 points and 4.5 rebounds 
in about 12 minutes per game last season as a solid backup to Dwight Howard. Dallas was targeting Gortat as a backup to Erick Dampier or possibly his eventual replacement because of Dampier’s expiring contract.
Gortat’s return solidifies the Magic front-
court for next season, with the team signing 
former Mavericks power forward Brandon 
Bass last week.
“Having quality big men is an absolute 
must in our league, and Marcin has worked very hard to fit into that category,” Magic gen-eral manager Otis Smith said in a statement. “He provides tremendous depth to our front-court and we’re happy to bring him back.”
Fresh off only their second trip to the NBA 
finals, the Magic have showed this off-season 
they are willing to spend.  Gor-
tat’s re-signing coupled with the 
acquisition of Vince Carter from New Jersey will force the Magic 
to dip into the luxury tax for the first time in franchise history.
The 6-foot-11, 240-pound center from Po-land made a little over $700,000 last season, his first full year in the NBA.  He likely will re-main in a backup center role or play sparingly alongside Howard at power forward.
Gortat earned the big pay raise in large part 
because of highlights in the Magic’s playoff run. Gortat filled in for Howard in the Game 6 clincher against Philadelphia in the opening round after Orlando’s All-Star was suspended, adding a few powerful dunks that earned him the nickname the “Polish Hammer.”

ST. LOUIS — Tim Lincecum 
plans to enjoy this trip to the All-Star 
game much more than his last one. The first thing he has to do is stay healthy so he can pitch.
The baby-faced San Francisco Gi-
ants ace was picked to start for the National League tonight at Busch Stadium. Toronto right-hander Roy Halladay will get the ball for the AL.
Last year’s NL Cy Young Award 
winner, Lincecum is 10-2 with a 2.33 ERA, making him a natural choice 
for NL manager Charlie Manuel. 
Despite a slight, boyish build, the 25-year-old right-hander is tied for the major league lead with 149 strikeouts.
Lincecum made the All-Star team 
last season but missed the game at Yankee Stadium because he was ill. Asked on Monday if he would 
take any precautions to make sure 
he doesn’t get sick again this year, Lincecum said he would load up on fluids to remain hydrated and have Giants teammate Matt Cain “put a leash around my neck, keep me in a room.”
“This is a great accomplishment 
for me,” Lincecum said, his long, 
shaggy hair protruding from under 
a black knit cap. “I think tomorrow the big thing is going to be just get-ting to the field. And after that, just getting on the field.”
Halladay, 10-3 with a 2.85 ERA 
for the Toronto Blue Jays, was se-lected to start by AL manager Joe Maddon of Tampa Bay.This is Halladay’s sixth All-Star 
appearance, but his first starting 
honor — and it could be his final trip 
in a Toronto uniform.
Blue Jays general manager J.P. 
Ricciardi said last week he’ll lis-ten to trade offers for the 2003 AL Cy Young Award winner, who is signed through 2010 and would have to agree to a deal.At a news conference Monday, 
broadcaster Bob Costas called Hal-
laday a member of the Blue Jays “at 
least for the moment,” which drew a round of uneasy chuckles.
“It’s tough. Obviously, I’m some-
where that I enjoy being and have spent my entire career. There’s a lot, I think, that goes into it,” Halladay said. “I think as a player, there’s that will to win, that will to do it in Oc-tober and basically that’s what all 
of this has been about. I would like 
that chance. I’m not saying it won’t be Toronto. You’d like to be three games up in first place and not have to deal with it.”
Lincecum and Halladay each 
pitched Thursday, so both will be on their regular four days of rest.In his most recent outing against 
San Diego, Lincecum carried a no-
hit bid into the seventh inning and 
won his fourth straight outing.
Halladay, who has won more 
games than any other major league pitcher since 2002, has made three starts since returning from a stint on the disabled list with a groin strain.
Manuel chose one of his own 
Phillies players, Gold Glove winner 
Shane Victorino, to start in center 
field in place of injured Carlos Bel-tran, who was elected by fans.
“I wanted a guy that had played 
center field, was a true center fielder to put out there,” Manuel said.
Florida shortstop Hanley Ramir-
ez will lead off for the NL, followed by Philadelphia second baseman 
Chase Utley, St. Louis first baseman 
Albert Pujols and Milwaukee slug-ger Ryan Braun in right. Raul Ibanez of the Phillies will be in left and bat fifth, in front of Mets third baseman David Wright, Victorino, Cardinals catcher Yadier Molina and Lince-cum.
For the AL, Seattle right fielder 
Ichiro Suzuki leads off and Yankees shortstop Derek Jeter is in the No. 2 hole. Minnesota catcher Joe Mauer bats third, followed by New York first baseman Mark Teixeira, Boston left fielder Jason Bay, Texas center fielder Josh Hamilton, Tampa Bay third baseman Evan Longoria, To-ronto second baseman Aaron Hill 
and Halladay.
“It’s just a great honor for me and 
I’m extremely excited,” Halladay said. “A highlight moment for me in 
my career, so thank you.”22, ALLIGATOR � TUESDAY, JULY 14, 2009

In a disappointing season for 
the Gators, Nick Calathes’ suc-
cess was the silver lining.
Although the 6-foot-6 guard’s 
two years in Gainesville weren’t filled with team success in the 
way previous years were, Cal-
athes left his mark on the men’s basketball program as one of the most versatile, talented play-ers to ever take the floor in the 
O’Connell Center.
Calathes, who left after his 
sophomore year to pursue a 
pro career in 
Greece, was the 
only player in the country last season to av-erage at least 15 points, five 
rebounds and 
six assists per game. He led the 
team in points (17.2), assists (6.4) and finished third on the team in rebounds (5.3) while averaging more than 33 minutes per game.
He broke UF’s single-season 
assists record in his first year, then proceeded to top his own mark in his sophomore year with 231. Despite only playing two years, Calathes’ 452 assists rank 
third all-time at UF.
In his freshman year, Calathes 
joined Corey Brewer as the only Gators to record a triple-double, 
racking up 11 points, 13 rebounds and 11 assists in a blowout of Creighton in the National Invita-tion Tournament. He became the 
only player to do it twice, totaling 
20 points, 13 rebounds and 10 as-sists against Georgia on Jan. 28.Calathes had to fill many roles 
for the Gators during his two years. He was the team’s primary ballhandler and scorer, having led the team in assists in 33 out 
of 36 games in the 2008-09 season 
and was the leading scorer in 20 of them. His versatility and stuffed stat sheets came as a result of his exceptional court vision and nat-ural feel for the game.
“The kid can’t jump over a 
newspaper, but he had 13 re-
bounds tonight,” said teammate 
Chandler Parsons after Calathes’ second career triple-double.Despite being a unanimous 
selection to the All-Southeastern 
Conference First Team in 2009 
and logging sensational stats throughout his career, Calathes may not be remembered as fond-ly as other UF basketball stars 
due to his team’s lack of success 
— two straight NIT appearances — and his failure to step up in the clutch.
If Calathes had stayed at UF, 
he may have been able to further improve on his already outstand-ing statistics, as he was already one of UF’s most prolific scorers. His 1,170 points were more than 
any other Gator after their fresh-
man and sophomore years. 
If he returned, a junior season 
could have given Calathes the 
opportunity to lead the Gators 
to their first NCAA Tournament 
berth since winning back-to-back national titles, as heralded fresh-
man Kenny Boynton and George-town transfer Vernon Macklin have joined the team.
For putting up impressive 
numbers throughout his career and being a much-needed bright spot during an otherwise dis-appointing year for the Gators’ men’s basketball team, Nick Ca-
lathes is the alligatorSports No. 4 
UF Athlete of 2008-09.
BY THE NUMBERS:  Calathes earned 
two third-place votes, one fifth-
place vote, two sixth-place votes and was left off one ballot.

Similar to the leadup to the 
NFL Draft, Percy Harvin’s health 
would be a major storyline for the 
Gators’ two postseason games this season.
He would not play against Al-
abama in the Southeastern Con-ference Championship Game.
He would make his trium-
phant return to lead UF past Oklahoma in the BCS National 
Championship Game.
Each told part of the Percy 
Harvin Saga.
His absence in Atlanta was 
due to an ankle sprain suffered against Florida State a week prior 
to the SEC title game. Harvin’s injury status was the story lead-
ing up to kickoff and Gators fans’ 
hearts sank as the then-junior came out not dressed for action.
Harvin said after the game 
that the trainer’s final decision was one of the hardest things he 
ever had to hear, but he used the 
opportunity to inspire his team-mates with a pregame speech.
“I basically told (the team) this 
is it,” Harvin said after the game. “Don’t come back in the locker room if you (don’t) leave it all 
out on the field, or you’ll have to 
face me and look me in the eye and tell me you hadn’t given ev-erything.”
Prior to the Gators’ showdown 
in Miami, injury news again cap-
tured the headlines.
The star playmaker would turn 
in one of his best performances as a Gator against Oklahoma, log-
ging 171 yards and a touchdown on 14 touches. His 122 rushing 
yards was the third-best running 
performance in a BCS title game.
“That was one of the gutti-
est performances I’ve ever been around,” coach Urban Meyer 
said after the 
game. “We’ve got three years together, and 
the one thing 
about (him is) the brighter the 
lights, the better 
he plays. He’s a 
big-time game performer.”
While widely known for his 
sharp cuts and quick speed, his stats also tell the tale of a domi-
nating playmaker. 
He was one of four players 
in the country to average more than 20 yards per carry in a game 
(minimum of seven carries) when he rumbled for a career-high 167 
yards on eight carries against 
South Carolina on Nov. 15. Har-vin ended his career having 
scored a touchdown in his last 15 
games, the best such mark in the country.His best receiving game also 
came in 2008 during the Gators’ only loss of the season against 
Ole Miss. Harvin had 186 yards 
on 13 catches — both numbers set career marks.
The Minnesota Vikings picked him with the the No. 22 overall pick in the 2009 NFL Draft.
