You don’t know what you have till it’s gone.
Maybe it’s a cliché, but for Karsten Whitson, 
who will play for the ﬁ  rst time in nearly two 
years on Sunday, it rings true.
Whitson had a $2.1 million contract to play 
professional baseball after being selected ninth 
overall by the San Diego Padres, then a stellar 
start to his college career and pending ace-hood 
lined up for him.
Then, all of that vanished.Whitson suffered from nagging shoulder fa-
tigue before the 2013 season started and elected 
to have shoulder surgery — performed by re-
nowned surgeon Dr. James Andrews — to re-pair an impingement.
The impingement was relatively good news. 
Whitson’s shoulder was intact — his labrum and rotator cuff were not damaged. Impinge-ments just cause tendons around the rotator cuff to become irritated and inﬂ  amed. 
However, the surgery ended Whitson’s sea-
son and cast his future into doubt.
The then-junior rode out the season on the 
bench, and when the MLB Draft rolled around in June, Whitson was selected in the 37th round, 
1,126th overall — a 1,117-pick drop from where 
he was selected in 2010. The slotted salary of a 37th round draft pick is $100,000 or fewer — not quite near the $2.1 million he could have cashed 
in.
Was it worth it?
“Absolutely,” Whitson said. “It’s easy for 
people to say, ‘Do you have any regrets?’ It is what it is.
“I feel like I’m in a great place right now, I’ve 
made some great relationships, and I’ve played some great baseball.”

When you’re selected ninth overall, there 
aren’t a lot of obvious beneﬁ  ts to postponing your payday.
If your goal is to play professional baseball, 
you can’t get off to a much better start. 
Some players picked in the ﬁ  rst round use 
college as leverage to get more dollars or hold 
off for a selection. Sometimes it pays off.
The New York Yankees selected Gerrit Cole 
out of high school with the 28th pick in the ﬁ  rst 
round of the 2008 draft. The Yankees threw money at Cole, reported-
ly offering him $4 million to sign. Like Whitson, Cole turned the money down.
But unlike Whitson, Cole cruised through 
college ball. He was the Friday night starter in 
his ﬁ  rst season at UCLA and averaged more 
than a strikeout per inning with the Bruins.
Cole’s gamble paid off. When he was eligible 
for the draft again in 2011, the Pittsburgh Pi-rates made him the No. 1 overall pick, and Cole 
signed for more than $8 million. He made his 
successful Major League debut in 2013 and is a lock for the top end of the Pirates’ rotation in 2014.
Was Whitson planning the same?Not according to his mother, Melissa Whit-
son, who told the Alligator in 2012 that Karsten would say, “It wasn’t coach (Kevin) O’Sullivan’s job to entice him away from the Padres; it was 
the Padres’ job to entice him away from coach 
O’Sullivan and the UF program.”
Whitson’s ﬁ  rst years at UF were successful, 
and he seemed poised to possibly make that 
tough jump from top-10 pick to No. 1 pick.
Perfect Game named him the top freshman 
pitcher in the country after he went 8-1 with a 
2.40 ERA in 2011. His strikeout-to-walk ratio was a solid 3.3:1, and he led a team that featured 
12 pitchers who are now playing professionally 
in punchouts.
But Whitson struggled to follow up on his 
success during his sophomore season.
Whitson was limited throughout the season 
due to shoulder fatigue — something he became all too familiar with later in his career.
He missed more than a month of the sea-
son, ﬁ  nishing the year with only 33.1 innings 
pitched in 14 appearances, 10 of which were 
starts. When he did play, he struggled with his command, walking 18 batters compared to only 20 strikeouts.
He was ready to start the 2013 season, anx-
ious to get back on the ﬁ  eld, but his surgery de-layed that another year.
“I kind of pitched through some stuff my 
sophomore year,” Whitson said. “Going off of 
those experiences, I told myself, ‘I really want to 
just be 100 percent.’ 
“If I’ve got something nagging that’s going 
on, I want to take care of it now. So that way I’m 
not pitching hurt in the season, because that’s 
not going to help the team, and it’s not going to 
help me in the long run.”
Now is his time to show he is still that ﬁ  rst-
round talent.
“I just think I’m a guy that teams would 
want to have,” Whitson said. “I think I’ve kind 
of faced some adversity in college. I’ve been through some things that I can kind of put a feather in my cap. It hasn’t broken me.”

Sunday cannot come fast enough.O’Sullivan pegged Whitson as the Sunday 
starter for Florida’s opening series against Mary-
land behind junior left-hander Bobby Poyner 
and freshman righty Brett Morales. Although Whitson has bundles of talent, O’Sullivan wants to ease him back into the routine of pitching in 
a rotation.
“It’s been a while since he’s been on the 
mound,” O’Sullivan said. “I thought it was im-
portant for him to come back and take a few games in.”
It has been almost two years since Whit-
son last saw action in a college game. Then a sophomore, he picked up a win in two-thirds of an inning of relief against NC State during the NCAA Super Regionals. He took plenty of games in from the bench in the meantime.
“You’re here for three years and build rela-
tionships, and guys expect you to be out there 
with them,” Whitson said. “It’s tough when you 
have to deal with an injury like that.”
Said catcher Taylor Gushue: “It was hard be-
cause that amount of talent was sitting on the 
bench. It’s hard as a player knowing that that’s 
there and it’s not accessible. But he has done a good job helping out our team this year. Now that the younger guys can look at him and they can see how he goes about his business on a 
day-to-day basis, I think that he will be a big 
factor on how well we do this year.”
Sitting out wasn’t a total loss, Whitson said. 
He learned ways to become a leader on the team 
without being out on the mound — ways he 
hopes translate to the ﬁ  eld in his fourth season at Florida.
Whitson is one of only two fourth-year 
pitchers on the roster this season — the other is 
Keenan Kish, another pitcher who missed most 
of last season with an injury. There are no true seniors.
As a veteran member of the pitching staff, 
Whitson is going to be the rock O’Sullivan will try to base his rotation around.
“The bottom line is he needs to be good for 
us to be good,” O’Sullivan said. 
And that is what Whitson is trying to focus 
on. Although the MLB Draft and his future are important, that isn’t where his mind is.
“Things are just in perspective for me after 
going through some of the things I’ve been 
through,” he said. “Just being healthy right now 
and just having fun with these guys and looking forward to the season — there’s really not much more to think about than that.”

Love is in the air for Gainesville 
businesses. 
Local ﬂ  ower shops are expect-
ing a bloom in sales, liquor stores 
are preparing for wine-fueled dates 
and businesses are facing a shortage 
of balloons because of a worldwide helium shortage.
Several local ﬂ  orists have hired 
extra staff to help accommodate the increase in orders. 
Gainesville Floral Exchange shop 
assistant Tiffany Richards said the store, 635 NW 13th St., receives be-tween six and 10 orders on a normal day of the year.
But during the Valentine’s Day 
season, which runs from Wednesday to Saturday, it’s a different story.
“We process about 1,000 orders 
in three days,” she said. “That’s a lot.”
Richards said the store hires 
about 60 extra workers just to keep up with business.
The situation is similar at other 
local shops.
Crystal Rodriguez, assistant ﬂ  o-
rist and receptionist at Gainesville Flower, 3545 SW 34th St., said the store’s phones ring off the hook dur-ing and leading up to the holiday.
“It doesn’t go more than ﬁ  ve 
minutes of quiet,” she said.
And with about 500 orders on Valentine’s Day alone, she said 
workers don’t get a chance to sit 
down. The store has to hire three to four extra people to help.
Even with a higher holiday price 
point, she said the store sometimes runs out of ﬂ  owers, especially of this season’s trend: pink roses.
But whatever choice a customer 
makes, Richards said she thinks it Businesses feeling the love from Valentine’s sales

John Denny quit his job for beer.
The former associate director of the UF 
honors program left his position Jan. 30 to launch First Magnitude Brewing Co., a new craft beer production brewery set to open on South Main Street in July.
Denny and his wife Christine will run the 
business with another couple, Meg and Wells The Losen. Denny will take on the role of head brewer.
“This is a dream that I’ve been kicking 
around with my wife and a couple other part-ners, and we’re ﬁ  nally going to execute it,” Denny said. “Here I have an opportunity to combine something that I really love with a way to make a living.”
Denny’s love for craft beer emerged 20 
years ago, when he began homebrewing after taking a class at Santa Fe Community Col-
lege.
For years, Denny has devoted his free time to distilling new drinks. He entered brewing 
competitions through the Hogtown Brew-ers and won various awards for his creative kitchen concoctions. Come July, he’ll be craft-ing those concoctions in a new microbrewery 
located in downtown near Innovation Square.
First Magnitude will host brewery tours 
and have a taproom where customers can 
try year-round and seasonal beers. There’s an increasing demand for it in Gainesville, UF professor leaves honors advising to open downtown brewery

Greatness is not a common path. Ac-
tor, singer and musician Common told 
UF students Thursday night that he had to work hard to attain his success.
Lonnie Rashid Lynn Jr., whose per-
former name is Common, encouraged students to “ﬁ  nd, believe and live their paths” to greatness at the Curtis M. Phil-lips Center for the Performing Arts on Thursday night.
Accent Speaker’s Bureau and Black 
History Month brought Common back to UF, where he previously performed in 2006.
During the evening, Common told his 
life story, rapped and answered questions during a Q-and-A.
Accent chairman Daniel Landesberg 
said about 1,200 tickets had been picked up for the night.
“Students can so easily relate to the 
message he raises,” said Landesberg, a 21-year-old UF telecommunication senior.
In his discussion, Common spoke about 
how he stayed positive after not winning a Grammy one year or obtaining an acting role in a movie.  
Alexis Booker, a 19-year-old UF behav-ioral and cognitive neuroscience fresh-man, said Common’s speech inspired her.
“I learned that struggle is an important 
part to success,” she said. “Not everything is going to be positive.”
Common also emphasized the inﬂ  u-
ence his faith has had on his life.
“The most important things we have in 
our lives are our creator and our families,” he said.
Casey Burns, a 22-year-old UF psychol-
ogy senior, said he likes Common for his overall image.
“He’s pretty socially conscious, which 
is the main reason he reaches to such a wide variety of demographics,” Burns said. “In the same manner, he’s a bit con-troversial, which is exciting.”
Common performed three songs, in-
cluding his hit “The People” and a track  from his new album. Common said his 10th studio album, “Nobody Smiling,” re-ﬂ  ected upon the violence in Chicago.
Jordan Thompson, a 18-year-old UF 
microbiology and cell science freshman, said Common’s message was uplifting.
“He showed me that no matter what 
you go through, it’s important to perse-vere,” he said.Common tells UF students about hard work, ways to success

Flappy Bird has ﬂ  own its last race. 
The game app that blew up in the 
last few months is no longer available 
for download after the founder de-
cided the game became too addictive for players. 
Marko Suvajdzic, 
assistant professor of digital arts and sciences, said the game’s impact on society could come 
from its simplicity. 
To play, users 
tap the screen to 
keep a bird from hitting green pipes.
“A lot of games today have that at-
titude of, ‘keep going and going,’” he 
said. “It seems endless, but it’s actu-ally self-generating.” 
Suvajdzic also said he believes the founder’s decision to pull the game could be a marketing stunt to make users want it more. 
Savannah Gribbins, an 18-year-
old UF telecommunication freshman, said she found it hard to put the game down after she downloaded it about 
a week ago. 
“It’s really, really frustrating, and 
it’s really hard,” Gribbins said. “It’s 
so hard and addictive because it’s over really quickly. Your little ﬂ  appy 
bird dies, and you’re immediately 
like, ‘Oh no, I can do better.’”
UF microbiology junior Kelsey 
O’Brien said she would put masking 
tape over the top part of her phone 
so she couldn’t be intimidated by her score. 
But the 21-year-old earned a high-
er score than most: 135.

UF’s GatorWell Health Promotion Services 
wants students to spread the love to everyone 
this Valentine’s Day.
GatorWell is running a two-week promo-
tion called “Model Healthy Relationships” that focuses on core components of healthy interac-tions, said Samantha Evans, a health promotion 
specialist at GatorWell. 
Students working in the GatorWell huts are 
talking about the message on campus and hand-
ing out items to spread the message.
“Love comes in lots of different forms, and 
it’s not just through people that you may be sex-ually active with,” Evans said. “When it comes to Valentine’s Day and healthy relationships in general, it’s important to know that connected-
ness with others is an essential part of overall 
health and wellbeing.”
Valentine’s Day is a day for all kinds of love 
and should be a day to appreciate all relation-
ships, Evans said. 
“We are trying to look beyond just those rela-
tionships where you might have sex with some-
one,” she said.
She said the message encourages students to 
not get caught up on the word “relationship.”

ing sophomore, said she loves the idea of Ga-torWell’s message. Gutierrez said she grew up 
thinking of Valentine’s Day as a day for showing 
all kinds of love.

Seniors see it differently.
“It’s kinda weird because it’s sort 
of like a happy day, and it could be a big bummer if you don’t get in,” Ethan Taylor, an 18-year-old Wesley Chapel 
High School senior, said.
But he said it also makes him glad 
he’s single. He can just focus on log-
ging on to UF's site.
Nick Rogner, a 17-year-old senior 
at Bishop Moore Catholic High School,  said UF releasing its decisions on Val-entine’s Day “gives single people something to look forward to.”
But truthfully, it doesn’t matter that 
it’s Valentine’s Day, he said. Every-body will be happy if they get in and sad if they don’t, no matter the date.
Some students are less casual about the choice of date. Amber Paez, a 19-year-old UF English freshman, and 
her boyfriend Erik Reichert, a 17-year-
old G. Holmes Braddock Senior High School senior, said they hate it.
Paez said the 6 p.m. release time 
clashes with Valentine’s Day dinner plans, which takes away the enjoy-ment of the night.
“I’m going to be just as nervous as 
him,” she said.
Reichert, who already refers to him-
self as a Gator, said if he gets accepted, the couple will share a few dinners and watch Game of Thrones together — all through video chatting.
His possible acceptance means the 
couple could spend their next Valen-tine’s Day together in person.
“We can actually have a date that 
doesn’t require FaceTime,” Paez said.said Brandon Nappy, market-
ing manager at Swamp Head Brewery.
He said First Magnitude 
will be well received, even by 
the competition.
“Our whole industry is very 
friendly. We’re all about fos-
tering the love for craft beer,” Nappy said. “It will now be the three musketeers. It’ll be Tall Paul’s, Swamp Head Brewery, and First Magnitude.”
The name of the business 
is inspired by Florida’s first-magnitude springs, which pump water at more than 100 feet per cubic second. Denny said North Central Florida has more first-magnitude springs than anywhere else in the world.
“I love all the unique things about Gainesville,” said Den-ny, who said he hopes to mod-el his company after thriving, distinctive local businesses like 
Satchel’s Pizza.
It’s as much an art and a cul-
ture as it is a beer, Nappy said. 
It’s about a handmade, local product that both the brewers and the customers enjoy.
A hiker, biker and avid mu-
sic lover, Denny said he hopes to target customers who want 
to relax after a long day out-
doors.  
Director of the UF Hon-
ors Program Kevin Knudson worked with Denny for five years. He said he hopes to see his former co-worker’s busi-ness thrive.
“We miss him,” said Knud-
son, who plans to delegate Denny’s roles among himself and two other honors advisers. “But I’m also really happy for him.”4, ALLIGATOR � FRIDAY, FEBRUARY 14, 2014

Compost recycling may be spreading 
across campus, and UF’s College of Design, 
Construction and Planning is the first stop. 
A UF landscape architecture graduate 
student introduced a food waste collection 
bin at the college and has started a new 
trend among her peers. 
Sara Kovachich, 23, said that every week 
when she goes to pick the bin up, it’s full.
“Students and faculty have donated their 
scraps of food. It’s been a lot more than I thought,” she said.
Kovachich said recycling and compost-ing food has become a way of life since she joined the Student Compost Cooperative, a UF organization trying to change the way people recycle their food.
“I love to garden. I don’t own a car. In a 
way, this is kind of like the next step,” she said. “It’s a simple thing. It can go a long 
way.”
Cooperative director Ann Wilkie created 
the organization three years ago after seeing 
growing interest from students.
“The SCC was my magnificent obses-
sion,” she said. “I thought the best way to learn about these things is by doing.”
Wilkie set up the cooperative at the UF 
Energy Research and Education Park, where more than 10 compost bins are located.
Students, faculty and residents of 
Gainesville can bring their leftover scraps to the park any time. 
Alec Spaulding, the coordinator of the 
organization, said the organization’s long-term goal is to establish collection bins across campus, similar to the recycling bins found for plastic bottles and paper.
“The biggest restriction right now is funding,” said Spaulding, a 22-year-old UF family, youth and community sciences se-nior. “I think we’re going to see this hap-pening everywhere within the next five years, especially in the dining halls.”
A major organization on campus has al-
ready followed the initiative of the compost 
cooperative.
UF’s Office of Sustainability is using the 
cooperative’s resources by recycling left-
over food from meetings, Wilkie said. The organization also works with Gainesville Compost.
The cooperative plans to continue fos-
tering new interest in recycling food scraps and helping the area’s conservation efforts.UF grad student spreads composting to architecture school

Helium shortage hit Gainesville
will be a good one.
“Everyone wants to show 
their appreciation for their sig-
nificant other,” she said. “And 
all women love flowers.”…
Stores may come up short 
for those looking to buy bal-loons for their lovers.
A current chemical shortage 
has rendered helium harder-to-get. 
The gas is a nonrenewable 
resource, said Greg Labbe, di-rector of a UF helium recycling facility. He said the shortage is caused by simple economics: The demand outweighs the supply.
“Helium is a very important 
scientific, medical and indus-trial element,” he said.
Local businesses are feeling 
impacts of the shortage.Julie Joines, assistant man-
ager of the Dollar Tree, 1335 NW 23rd Ave., said her store 
didn’t receive helium for three 
weeks in a row.   
“It definitely affects us,” she 
said.  
Students who wanted to 
purchase balloons for their sig-nificant others noticed the lack of helium as well. 
When Brianna Bielski, a 
20-year-old UF biology sopho-more, went into The Party Store in Butler Plaza to buy her boy-friend balloons for Valentine’s

Many would say Valen-
tine’s Day would be incomplete 
without a bottle of red wine or vintage chardonnay.
Local liquor stores have rec-
ognized the importance of the staple during the holiday and compensated for demand.
Rene Owens, a sales clerk at 
the ABC Fine Wine & Spirits, 318 NW 13th St., said Valen-tine’s Day brings in college stu-dents — mainly men — to buy  
bottles of red wine for romantic 
dinners.
“Wine complements the 
meal way more than hard li-quor,” Owens said.
Other stores have noticed a 
similar trend.
Jigga Patel, an employee at 
Gator Liquor at 1203 SW 16th 
Ave., said Valentine’s Day 
causes a significant increase in sales for wine and a few other drinks. 
“Some people also like Bai-
leys and other — you know — girly drinks,” he added.
Jose Mantilla, a 21-year-old 
UF biology junior, said he un-
derstands why people would 
buy drinks at a liquor store and avoid going out to celebrate Valentine’s Day.
“A lot of girls think that go-
ing out to dinner is too main-stream,” Mantilla said.VAleNtiNe ,

Goats big or goats home.
The UF chapter of Nourish International, 
a nonproﬁ  t organization focused on reduc-ing global poverty, will collaborate with the Uganda Rural Fund this summer to donate 
goats to Ugandan orphans at the Hope Acad-
emy.Catie Faughnan, a 20-year-old UF econom-
ics and political science junior and a co-pres-ident of UF Nourish International, said the goal is to buy as many goats as possible with the fundraiser money.
“A goat is really a sustainable investment 
not only for feeding your family but selling its products,” she said, “and also goats have gen-erally long lives.”
The program focuses on orphans due to the growing phenomenon of “child-headed fami-lies” in which both parents have died, and the oldest child takes responsibility of the house-hold, according to the organization’s site. 
The chapter is selling roses for Valentine’s 
Day as part of a fundraising competition host-ed by the national ofﬁ  ce to gain funds for their project.
UF’s chapter of Nourish International is 
ranked as the No. 1 fundraiser in the national competition out of 28 participating groups, bringing them closer to the goats.
Alexis Tavarez, a 19-year-old UF health 
science sophomore and co-president of the UF chapter, said she believes the small size of the organization allows students to have a unique service experience.
“Nourish International really gets under

� THE MONOLOGUES ARE MEANT TO EDUCATE

This weekend more than 15 actresses will give staged 
monologues all about one topic: their vaginas.
“The Vagina Monologues,” returning to the Hippodrome 
State Theatre, raises money to end violence against women. Last year, the show sold out the Hippodrome Cinema 
all three days. This year, the show is moving to the Hippo-
drome’s main stage to accommodate a larger audience.  
Valentine’s Day showings of “The Vagina Monologues” 
are already sold out, but shows on Feb. 22 at 2 p.m. and on Feb. 24 at 7:30 p.m. are each selling tickets for $25. Emily Snider saw the show in Gainesville with her mother 
when she was 17, before she became co-director of the play.   
“I remember feeling a little embarrassed to be watching 
some parts of it,” she said. But, in retrospect, “It was eye-opening, especially in those formative years. It gets you to start thinking.” 
She said the monologues are meant to equally educate and 
entertain.

MIAMI — Some Miami hotels are 
teaming up with a program to offer 
out-of-town guests who are feeling un-der the weather a convenient way to connect with a doctor.
If travelers are suffering from any-
thing from an earache to the ﬂ  u, they can contact the hotel concierge or front desk to coordinate a new medical tech-nology platform.
SKYdoc enables a doctor to receive 
vitals, such as blood pressure, pulse  and EKG reads for non-life-threatening illnesses. 
The technology allows a doctor to 
communicate in a way that’s similar to Skype one-on-one with their patients 24 hours a day.
The service will be available in all of the nearly 200 South Florida hotels of the Greater Miami and the Beaches Hotel Association.
Creator Dr. Ramsey Saffouri is 
launching the program in South Flori-da ahead of a worldwide release. 
Saffouri demonstrated the broad, 
multilingual medical technology, which he said also has wide diagnostic capabilities, at a press conference at the iconic Delano Hotel on Wednesday.
SKYdoc was developed in South 
Florida with the cooperation of its tourism partners.
“We’re extremely proud not only 
that SKYdoc was created here, but that it will be unveiled here and introduced in our beautiful and signiﬁ  cant tourism destination,” said Wendy Kallergis, president of the Greater Miami and the Beaches Hotel Association.Miami hotels help sick guestsSTATEReader response

Two new pieces of legislation could lift a serious burden 
from student veterans: The House of Representatives unani-mously voted to pass the GI Tuition Fairness Act, which would 
require all public universities to offer in-state tuition to veterans. 
Florida schools do not waive out-of-state fees for veteran stu-dents, so another bill currently making its rounds in the Florida State Senate would change that. So this week, we’re handing off 
a step-in-the-right-direction LAUREL to Senate Bill 84, which, if 
signed into law, would ensure out-of-state student veterans can 
get affordable rates for a UF education. 
This week, Voldemort stand-in and Florida Gov. Rick Scott 
angered many when the state legislature excluded educational 
facilities from its list of possible early-voting locations — which, 
for us, means the Reitz Union won’t become an early-voting lo-cation any time soon. 
According to Alligator coverage from earlier this week, “‘The 
statute allows early voting to occur in government-owned com-munity centers,” (Sen. Bill) Nelson said. ‘The last time I checked, the university is part of the public sector, which is a community facility that is not just used by students.’” 
The exclusion seems to be a calculated measure to suppress 
student voting; in the 2012 presidential elections, young vot-ers overwhelmingly preferred Barack Obama to Mitt Romney. This week, we’re tossing a we-want-to-vote-early-and-buy-Star-bucks-in-the-same-building DART to the Florida Legislature. 
We reported Wednesday that the City of Gainesville is modi-
fying intersections and speed limits around town to promote biker safety. Although the cost of the citywide accommodations for bike riders was pretty hefty — about $29,000 — we agree that cyclist safety is paramount for the many UF students, faculty 
and Gainesville residents who choose to cut costs and carbon 
emissions. An I-want-to-ride-my-bicycle-bicycle-bicycle-bicycle LAUREL goes to the Gainesville Public Works department this 
week. 
Finally, a don’t-try-to-be-a-hero DART to all the sickly stu-
dents and coughing co-workers who came to school/work anyway despite having colds. Seriously, everyone and his or her mother is sick in Gainesville right now — the Alligator news-room was basically a hospital ward this week. Listen to your

Valentine’s Day? Today’s question: Do you remember the day you got 
into UF?A nonconformist guide to loving Feb. 14
Valentine’s Day gets a bad rap.
If you’re in love, you’ve had your day planned 
for weeks, months even. If you’re single, you 
must be a bitter, depressed, crazy cat lady. If you’re see-
ing someone casually, you’re crossing the clingy line if you to want to spend time with him or her today.
There are a few misconceptions about Valentine’s 
Day, and although any of the aforementioned hypothet-icals are possible and sometimes true, there’s no reason everyone can’t have an enjoyable day. 
Like any holiday, this commercialized day in Febru-
ary comes with connotations and expectations about 
what we should focus on. 
But regardless of how you celebrate — or don’t — 
the best way to enjoy your day is just to tell yourself 
you will.
From the time we were in grade school, we’ve been 
taught that Feb. 14 is the day to express love and affec-tion for those we care about. 
Then, all you had to worry about was making sure 
the printed card stock your parents bought for you to 
hand out expressed the right “je ne sais quoi” by way 
of a Count Dracula sucking a full IV and saying “You’re my type,” or Sesame Street’s Oscar the Grouch exclaim-ing,  “I <3 Trash!”
As you got older, the focus shifted from being nice 
to your classmates to expressing your undying devo-tion for someone by dropping serious cash on bouquets of roses or worrying about what corset-and-garter-belt combo would best suit the post-romantic-ﬁ  ve-course-
dinner mood.
And as social beings in a consumerist society, it’s 
hard to go completely against the lovey-dovey mush 
we’re fed by the general public and the media.
Americans are predicted to spend $37 billion in win-
ing, dining and gifting in celebration of love this year, according to American Express.I’ll be the ﬁ  rst to say it: I love 
spending money. I love ﬂ  owers. I love lingerie, and I love fancy 
dinners. 
I just don’t see the need to 
cram all the fun into the one 
day — then again, I’ve never 
been a conformist. 
On days where everyone is 
expected to be go all out, it’s 
the small things that impress me. Valentine’s Day is the 
perfect time to be grateful for those who always notice 
the color of your nails or the person who opens the door 
for you, even when it’s raining and neither of you have an umbrella. 
It can also be the perfect time to share your personal 
pizza with Netﬂ  ix and thank the people who answer your frantic texts about the aggressive creep on Tinder.
But you shouldn’t compare your Valentine’s Day 
ideals to mine. Don’t compare them to anyone’s.
Maybe you feel great in lingerie regardless of how 
much you’ve eaten. Maybe a movie and wine for two has always worked for you, and maybe you’re expect-ing your guy to know you want to be proposed to on Valentines Day, but you don’t want to have to tell him. 
Just kidding, hopefully that’s only one crazy girl on 
Lulu.
Some years, Valentine’s Day calls for silly cards and 
chocolates. Some years it calls for time alone with your cat — and remember, guys can be cat ladies, too.
What if the only thing you’ll ﬁ  nd enjoyment in today 
is pasting your ex’s face to the bullseye of a darts board? That’s OK. It’s America, and I’m sure you can ﬁ  nd a cool bar that will encourage you, maybe even reward 
you, for doing just that.

The dangers of a one-party university
Following a trend that has become the 
standard for most major schools, Florida has 
become a one-party university. Swamp Par-
ty dominates UF politics in every way, from Senate to the Executive ticket, running prac-tically unopposed this Spring. While this is 
being celebrated by Swamp as a unifying 
movement in the Student Body, there are 
many dangers that come with such a power-ful party.
When one party is so heavily the major-
ity, we run the risk of becoming a “machine-
like” government to the likes of the Univer-sity of Alabama. Opposition can be silenced, 
platforms can be skewed, legislation can be 
passed at a whim. When one party is this powerful, we lack necessary checks and bal-ances. Without opposition, who is there to 
say, “stop”?
I vote for Swamp Party candidates. I am 
in full support of their Spring platform, but 
I also appreciate valid opposition. How can we have the necessary debates our univer-
sity needs to have when we’re arguing with 
ourselves?

UF business freshman  Take back UF, vote Students Party
Each student will spend approximately 
$2,082 in fees over his or her four years 
here funding Student Government. 
Yet most of us are not being adequately 
represented, and our voices are not be-ing heard on how that money should be spent. 
Wasteful programs run abound in the 
budget every year, and we need a strong opposition to keep the majority party in check. Students Party candidates want to fairly represent you, the student. They are 
not beholden to any organization and its interests. 
As senators, they will vote objectively 
on bills being considered, not how they’re 
told. 
My fellow students, it is time we take 
our campus back. 
Each vote will make a difference in this 
crucial election, one that may be our last chance to prevent total one-party domina-tion. 
I ask you to vote Students Party, for the 
sake of our school.

UF political science freshman Letters to the Editor
Last week, I wrote about 
the Taco Libre Party, an offshoot of the Stu-
dents Party whose goal is to bring a Taco Bell to UF’s 
campus. Upon closer inspec-
tion, though, it was clear that the Taco Libre party is the creation of frustrated op-
position members trying to 
generate interest in Student Government 
in the shadow of the domineering Swamp 
Party. 
Taco Libre was the only party challeng-
ing Swamp for executive seats in the up-coming elections. The Students Party isn’t running any executive candidates, citing 
a strategy of focusing on seats it knows it 
can win. Playing it safe seems smart, but it also sounds like the Students Party won’t 
last for more than a few elections. The 
grim situation, then, perfectly summed up the political situation at UF: The only party challenging the political establish-
ment was literally a taco party. 
I say “was” because earlier this week, 
the Supervisor of Elections said the Taco Libre vice presidential candidate “failed 
to qualify.”
For some reason, the vice president 
candidate’s faulty paperwork also dis-qualiﬁ  es the party’s presidential candi-
date, leaving only treasurer-hopeful Mica 
Montero. Ofﬁ  cially, then, the only names that will appear on the ballot for president 
and vice president will be Swamp Party 
candidates, running unopposed.
Leaders in the Taco Libre party said 
they will pursue a write-in campaign. The 
hopes of the Taco Libre party, and the en-
tire indie bloc as a whole, are not totally dead yet. But this most recent news makes 
it even more likely that we’re headed for a 
Student Government entirely dominated 
by a single party. 
Luckily, the Swamp Party has a solid 
platform and policies that very well may make UF an even better place to live and 
work. But the party, like its previous in-carnations, is the political wing of a cor-
rupt and nepotistic system that relies on 
patronage and coercion to stay in power. 
I sincerely wish that I am what that 
statement makes me seem, paranoid to the 
point of sickness, huddled in a dark room 
with tin foil on my head. The depress-ing fact is that I’m not — it’s just that I’ve 
spent more than twenty minutes reading 
about corruption in SG. 
The time has come for La Revolución.One of two things must happen if the 
Student Body wants to avoid a single-par-
ty system. A single party system would create a situation where the 
same people are in charge of everything and get to make 
all the decisions, with no dis-
senting voices to speak of. 
No dissenting voices means 
no debate, no discussion and no change. 
If you ﬁ  nd that situation 
appealing, by all means, vote 
Swamp. 
If you don’t, the easiest way to avoid 
it is for the write-in campaign to succeed. If it does, it’s conceivable that the Taco 
Libre candidates in the executive branch 
and their colleagues in the Senate will join forces with whomever gets elected from 
the Students Party. After all, Taco Libre 
was founded by former Students Party members, and a political victory would 
probably encourage them to reunite. Such 
a coalition would guarantee a modest in-dependent voice in Student Government. 
If the write-ins do succeed, next year 
we may have a shiny new Taco Bell and a Student Government that represents the will of the Student Body.
Chances of a successful write-in cam-
paign, though, are very slim. It’s far more 
likely the auspices of death looming over 
this incarnation of the indie bloc will come true. Right now it’s a wounded animal, 
barely able to lift a ﬁ  nger against the mas-
sive might and inﬂ  uence of the majority. Calling this a David-and-Goliath isn’t fair 
because it implies there is a serious possi-
bility that the opposition won’t get utterly decimated in this election. 
In the likely event that Swamp wins 
all executive and most of the Senate seats, this generation of the opposition will have fought its last battle. 
But even if this election is a total vic-
tory for the majority, there is a chance that 
the opposition may continue to ﬂ  ourish. 
The parties that currently compose it will die — sure. But is that actually such a bad 
thing? 
If the outcome of this election ends 
up as one-sided as it looks, the simple result will be that these parties failed. Of 
course the playing ﬁ  eld was never level, but that’s precisely what an opposition party in UF’s political landscape needs to 
do: level the playing ﬁ  eld. If an opposition 
party is ever going to succeed, much less compete in this political climate, it must 
be organized, active and effective. 
But, most importantly, it needs to stop 
playing the underdog game the majority 
has created.

Two weeks ago, MSNBC 
president Phil Grifﬁ  n apologized to Reince 
Priebus, head of the Repub-lican National Committee, for a tweet sent out by the network’s ofﬁ  cial Twitter ac-
count.
The offending tweet read: 
“Maybe the rightwing will hate it, but 
everyone else will go awww: the ador-able new #Cheerios ad w/ biracial fam-
ily.”
The tweet referred to a recent Chee-
rios television commercial featuring a 
young biracial child, her white mother 
and her black father.
Prominent Republicans around the 
country reacted swiftly to the tweet, 
expressing outrage that MSNBC would accuse them of racism or intolerance. 
MSNBC swiftly and repeatedly apolo-
gized for the tweet, calling it “offen-sive.”
Despite Republican outrage about 
MSNBC’s tweet, the reaction of conser-vatives nationwide to another commer-cial just a few days later calls into ques-tion their assertion of complete racial tolerance.
During the Super Bowl, Coca-Cola 
aired a now-infamous ad depicting Americans of several different racial and ethnic backgrounds singing sec-
tions of “America the Beautiful” in their 
respective native languages.
According to a statement from Coca-
Cola, the ad was intended to “provide a snapshot of the real lives of Americans 
representing diverse ethnicities, reli-
gions, races and families, all found in the United States.”
In response to this fairly innocuous 
celebration of America’s diversity, many notable conservatives expressed out-rage at the idea of a traditional Ameri-can song sung in any language besides English.
Former Rep. Allen West (R-Fla.) 
called the ad “disturbing” in a Facebook post and said the commercial’s celebra-tion of multiculturalism means that 
America is “on the road to perdition.”
Popular right-wing news aggregator 
The Right Scoop claimed that “America 
has a culture of its own, primarily denot-ed by our ofﬁ  cial language, English.”
America, of course, does not have an 
ofﬁ  cial language. However, conserva-tives in Congress have previously sup-ported bills that would make English 
the ofﬁ  cial language of the United States government.
Fox News pundit Todd 
Starnes tweeted his opin-ion that the meaning of 
the commercial is that Coca-Cola feels “America is beautiful because new 
immigrants don’t learn to 
speak English.” He also 
called Coca-Cola “the ofﬁ  cial soft drink of illegals crossing the border.”
Eric Bolling, another Fox News con-
tributor and co-host of Fox’s “The Five,” claimed that the ad’s use of “America the Beautiful” “ticked off a lot of Ameri-cans” who are “very, very patriotic 
about that song.”
These comments by prominent con-
servative leaders are mean-spirited, vile 
and offensive to all those who celebrate and appreciate the diversity of Ameri-
ca. They also prove the point MSNBC 
sought to make in its tweet about the Cheerios ad: Many right-wing conserva-tives are deeply intolerant of nonwhite, 
non-English speaking Americans.
The intolerance of conservative lead-
ers toward America’s nonwhite popu-
lation has translated into a collapse of support for the Republican Party among 
racial minorities in the United States.
In the 2012 presidential election, 93 
percent of blacks, 71 percent of Hispan-
ics and 73 percent of Asians voted for 
President Barack Obama. Republican 
nominee Gov. Mitt Romney received 59 percent of the white vote, but that strong majority was no match for the presi-dent’s diverse, multiracial coalition.
Recent studies suggest that the Re-
publican Party’s diversity problem is only getting worse. A 2013 Gallup sur-vey found that non-Hispanic whites ac-
count for 89 percent of the Republican 
Party, with about 8 percent identifying as black or Hispanic. In contrast, 35 per-cent of Democrats identiﬁ  ed as black or Hispanic.
The Republican Party and the Ameri-
can conservative movement will ulti-mately crumble without at least mod-erate levels of support from racial and 
ethnic minorities. 
Rather than condemning these 
groups, conservatives should celebrate 
and reach out to them.
Diversity, not racial intolerance and 
hatred, is what truly makes America beautiful.

Tennessee on Tuesday night in Knoxville, Tenn. Wilbekin led the Gators with a career-high 21 points.
JONATHAN CZUPRYN
Alligator Staff Writer @jczupryn
Billy Donovan knows Scottie Wilbekin had a great 
game Tuesday against Tennessee. 
He knows his point guard has had a really good se -
nior campaign so far.
But in this what-can-you-do-for-me-now league, 
Donovan wants to know how Wilbekin can improve 
even more before No. 3 Florida’s (22-2, 11-0 Southeast -
ern Conference) road matchup with Kentucky (19-5, 9-2 
SEC) on Saturday at 9 p.m.
“This game is over,” Donovan said after defeating the 
Volunteers 67-58. 
“How does he respond from this? How does he play 
going forward?”
Despite a 5-of-17 shooting performance against Ten -
nessee, which included a measly 1-of-6 from behind the 
three-point arc, Wilbekin finished the night with his best 
scoring output of his career with 21 points. 
Being sent to the line 12 times and knocking down 10 
free throws helped the senior tack on some extra points 
and helped the team ice the game Tuesday.
Not only did Wilbekin showcase his skills as a scor -
er, but he was also unselfish with the ball, recording a 
game-high six assists in 35 minutes of play. 
Add four steals on the defensive end of the floor and 
you get one of Wilbekin’s most balanced games of his 
career.
However, Kentucky has not been as kind to the 6-foot-
2 point guard as Tennessee has been in his career.
In eight career games against the Wildcats, Wilbekin 
and the Gators have won just two matchups, both at Wilbekin’s offense keeping pace with strong defense

In October, she played midfield for 
the soccer team. In January, she started 
practicing with the basketball scout 
team. 
By chance, the now dual-sport ath -

Butler’s basketball team, deepening 
Florida’s still shallow roster to nine ac -
tive players. 
“I wasn’t looking for it, that’s for 
sure,” Begic said. 
“The coach actually approached me because she heard I played basketball 
in high school. So she approached me, 
and I went to a couple of practices just 
watching, and then I decided I kind of 
wanted to do it.”
Coach Becky Burleigh presented the 
idea of joining the basketball team to Be -

“It was through Coach Burleigh,” Be -

FENSIVE CATEGORIES.
JORDAN MCPHERSON
Alligator Writer @J_McPherson1126
After starting 57 games in 2013, Taylor 
Schwarz felt confident going into the start of 
the season.
“I feel like the nerves weren’t even there 
this year, especially since having last year 
under my belt,” the sophomore said. “I was 
just ready to get out there and play with my 
team.”
After pacing all of UF’s freshmen with 38 
RBIs and logging nine home runs in 2013, 
Schwarz picked up right where she left off. 
Through Florida’s first six games, the 
Palm Beach Gardens native leads the team in 
batting average (.500), hits (8), runs (8), home 
runs (2) and RBIs (8). She is also the only bat -
ter to record a hit in every game.
But besides Schwarz, the majority of Flori -da’s batters have struggled at the plate.
Of UF’s nine batters with at least 10 at-bats, 
six post a sub-.300 batting average and three 
players have more strikeouts than hits after 
Florida’s opening games in Tampa.
“That was our first 
time stepping on the 
field as one team be -
cause we’ve been play -
ing each other for the past three, four weeks, 
maybe six weeks,” Schwarz said. “So defi -
nitely getting a chance to play with each oth -
er — it was a different atmosphere, different 
energy on that field.”
The Gators hope to improve their offense 
when they head to Las Vegas to compete in 
the Easton Desert Classic. Florida (6-0) starts 
action with a doubleheader today, playing Se -
attle (1-5) at noon followed by a game against 
Hawaii (3-2) at 2:15 p.m.
Despite having a strong outing at the USF 
Wilson-DeMarini tournament, Schwarz is not 
going to let her performance get to her head.First baseman slugging early

Jonathan Bullard  
UF defensive end on proposed NCAA football rule change“I just took on that mindset that I’m not going 
to have a great game every game, but if it’s not my 
game, I need to be there for someone else who is hav-ing their game,” Schwarz said. “This past weekend, even though I was hitting pretty good, it’s only our 
first weekend.”
In the pitching circle, the Gators are hoping to con-
tinue to make strides. 
Senior Hannah Rogers is one win away from be-
coming the second pitcher in Florida history to notch 100 victories. 
Junior Lauren Haeger is coming off the first no-hit-
ter of her career and boasts a team-best 1.08 ERA and 
18 strikeouts through 13 innings.
Freshman Delanie Gourley won both of her first 
two collegiate starts, including an extra-inning win 
against then-No. 5 Michigan.
“I really wasn’t that nervous because I think I just 
transfer that into excitement and adrenaline,” Gourley 
said. “And I just really wanted to get started and kind of show what I had.”

Although Wilbekin is 15 
of 28 from the floor, includ-ing 7 of 13 from beyond the arc, against Kentucky, he has not been able to be the 
scoring threat that he has 
turned into this season. His two highest scoring outputs against the Wildcats were 14 and nine points, and both of 
those performances ended in 
victory for the Gators. 
If Wilbekin, who has 
scored more than 14 points 
in eight of his 19 games so 
far this season, can continue his best offensive season Sat-urday, Florida has a shot to extend its SEC record to 12-0 for the first time in school 
history.
Wilbekin said his more 
balanced offensive attack 
as well as his ball-sharing 
ability is attributed to being 
a more vocal player on the court than he has been in past seasons. 
However, Wilbekin will 
face his biggest test of the season in Rupp Arena, where crowds can reach as high as 
23,000.
“I think I’ve done a bet-
ter job and good job of being more vocal on the court and 
trying to relay what coach wants as a position on the court,” Wilbekin said. “So 
(I’m) just talking to my team-
mates, encouraging them and trying to get them on the right track.”
Donovan, who is looking 
for only his fourth win ever in Lexington, Ky., and first since 2007, said his team has been challenged on the road 
this season in both confer-
ence and non-conference games. He believes that ex-perience will help Saturday.
In addition to the squad’s 
experience from its eight road games this season, Donovan said the veteran leadership 
of his four seniors, including 
Wilbekin, will provide stabil-ity to the younger players.
“Going to Wisconsin was 
a tough environment, hav-
ing to go to Connecticut in a 
tough environment and then obviously, we’ve played four road games in a short period 
of time to start the league,” 
Donovan said. “We’ve got some older guys that have been through it. 
“They understand it and 
know what it takes. We’re going against a team that is playing very good basketball and it wasn’t so long ago that we played them.” FRIDAY, FEBRUARY 14, 2014 § ALLIGATOR, 13

Pamela Begic looks on from the bench during Florida’s 75-67 win 
against Alabama on Jan. 30 in the O’Connell Center.
Freshman joined depleted team after watching it practice
have another idea. So, do you want 
to maybe try out for the basketball team?’”
Sure enough, Begic decided to 
take the plunge. 
“Pam entered an entirely differ-
ent world,” Butler said. “It was kind 
of baptism by fire; there was no 
warm-up, there was no, ‘Let’s take it easy.’ We’re in the middle of our season. If you’re going to be able to join us, even in practice, there’s not 
a lot of time for us to take her aside 
and tutor her.
“She’s done it with an amazing 
amount of flexibility and under-
standing.”
However, the circumstances that 
surrounded Begic’s new role were 
somewhat dire.  
The Gators started the season 
with nine active players after red-shirt sophomore Viktorija Dimaite re-tore her ACL. A hand injury to fellow sophomore Antoinette Ban-nister had the roster down to eight, 
and Christin Mercer’s arrest deplet-
ed Florida’s roster to only seven ac-tive players. 
“When we were staring down 
the barrel of us having seven play-ers, even being able to practice effec-tively was a challenge,” Butler said. 
“So we wanted to give it a shot.”The 6-foot Begic is one of the tall-
est players on Florida’s soccer team. 
With rebounding being a con-
stant issue for the basketball team, the freshman midfielder was 
brought in for her ability to grab 
some boards. 
“Her rebounding is definitely 
there,” Butler said. “The thing that makes her unique and makes her 
even capable besides just on the 
mental aspect is that she does have good size. She has great instincts, and that’s a big part of rebounding.
“If there’s a game situation that 
calls for Pam to be in there, I’ve got full confidence in her.”
Having full confidence in play-
ing someone without any collegiate game experience speaks volumes of 
Begic’s character. 
A number of players have said 
that her presence alone improves 
team chemistry. 
“Pam’s so fun to be around,” 
senior Lily Svete said. “She really works hard and she just has a good time. She brings a lightened spirit to the whole team.”
Begic has been in uniform for 
Florida’s past two games against Arkansas and Kentucky. Although she has yet to enter a game, Butler 
has devised some schemes where 
Begic could potentially see some minutes. 
“We have some spots in the game, 
that if we need her, she knows these 
will be the spots that she’ll play in,” 
Butler said. 
“She knows exactly what we ex-
pect her to do.”
When asked if Begic thought 
she’d get to play this season, she seemed optimistic. 
“We’ll see,” Begic said. “Hope-
fully … a couple of minutes.” W-hooPS , from page 12

A loss at home on your birthday 
would be one you would never for-
get.
However, on sophomore Devon 
Schneider’s 20th birthday, she got a big win.
No. 8 Florida lacrosse (1-1) went 
head-to-head with Jacksonville (0-2) on Wednesday, beating the Dol-phins handily 21-5.
While junior Shannon Gilroy 
posted seven points to assist the 
Gators to their ﬁ  rst win of the sea-
son, Schneider made an equally important impact on the game.
The sophomore notched a ca-
reer-high four points, won two draws and forced one turnover for the Gators to take the win. She also recorded a season best in draw controls for the night. 
Prior to Wednesday, her career-
high for a single game was two points.
Schneider said that the practices 
following UF’s 20-8 season-open-ing loss at No. 1 UNC on Saturday focused a lot on winning ground balls and draws.
“Our focus in practice was 
mainly just getting those 50-50 balls,” Schneider said. 
“They are anybody’s game, so 
we really needed to come up with 
them and I think that we really im-proved on that.”
The 6-foot-2 attacker scored no 
goals at UNC and was 0-1 in free 
position shots. 
However, Schneider’s play 
against the Dolphins may have been the conﬁ  dence boost the sophomore and the team needed.
“It just shows that we can play 
together and that we can be the 
team that we know we can be,” 
Schneider said. “It shows not only us, but it shows our fans that we can do it. We can win.”
 Schneider is on her way to top-
ping her points total from 2013. 
In her freshman year at Florida, 
she scored only six points. Wednes-day’s game alone has put her two 
points away from tying her season 
high.
The Lititz, Pa., native made big 
impacts for the team in her fresh-man year, most notably when she 
came off the bench in the second 
round of the NCAA Tournament and scored a point against Denver. 
Schneider has started in the ﬁ  rst 
two games of 2014 and is expected to start against High Point on Sat-
urday at 1 p.m.Sophomore plays key role in blowout victory against Jacksonville

“[50-50 balls] are 
anybody’s game, so we really 
needed to come up with them 
and I think that we really 
improved on that. It was our 
main focus for the game.”

Although the UF track and ﬁ  eld program has compiled 35 event 
victories in four meets this indoor season, fatigue has had a negative 
effect on athletes.
After competing four weeks in a row, the Gators have crossed the 
midway mark of the indoor schedule and move into what they call 
their “championship taper.” 
That point has arrived, and although some exhaustion has crept 
in, the team recognizes the intensity level has risen.
“They’re human beings; they’re not machines, and heck, machines 
break down,” coach Mike Holloway said. “At the end of the day, 
you’re not always going to have 100 percent, but they can always give us 100 percent of what they have.
“If they do that, we’ll be ﬁ  ne.”At every meet this season, the men and women’s squads have ei-
ther broken a school record, or earned a new personal record. 
However, the athletes don’t solely generate top results on their 
own. It takes a coaching staff to take them there.
Associate coach Steve Lemke (throws) and assistant Nic Petersen 
(jumps) received praise this past weekend after their respective ath-letes performed well.
“It’s not just those two, it’s my coaching staff as a whole,” Hollo-
way said. “When you go out and hire people, my goal is to try to get people who are like me. People who have the same passion, the same 
drive and the same focus that I do and I think my staff does that.”
Lemke has coached thrower Stipe Zunic since the junior’s fresh-
man season, and Zunic notched his career-best shot put performance 
last weekend at the Virginia Tech Elite Meet. 
Zunic tossed himself into seventh all-time in the UF record book 
with his 18.57-meter throw.
“(Lemke) has a lot of understanding,” Zunic said. “Could’ve talk-
ed about everything, and step-by-step he just made me the athlete I am today for the Gators.”
But Zunic’s strength isn’t launching a shot put through the air; it’s 
also hurling a javelin.
Zunic said he considers himself a javelin thrower despite throw-
ing discus and shot put since he started competing for UF. 
But injuries kept him from throwing shot put for two years and 
javelin for one.
He said although it sounds crazy, those injuries worked out well 
for him. 
“Those injuries kind of had to happen. I know it sounds crazy 
but it was to humble me down,” Zunic said. “God’s been putting great people in my life, my coaches, my physicians. Everyone here is great.
“Gradually, some things have to fall apart just to fall back in the 
right place so everything will start to go really well with all the reha-bilitation and everything I was going through, taking it step by step 
one at a time, which made me patient.”
Gators split up: This weekend, the Gators will split off toward 
four different meets.
Senior middle-distance runner Cory McGee will compete solo at 
the Millrose Games in New York City, sprinters will head to Ames, 
Iowa, for the Iowa State Classic, distance runners will head to Seattle, for the Husky Classic, and the rest of the squad will settle in College Station, Texas, at the Texas A&M Invitational.Now heading into a massive weekend, Holloway wants his team 
to keep pressing forward. 
“We pride ourselves on being multidimensional,” Holloway said. 
“I pride myself on having assistant coaches who understand that pro-cess and who work hard to make sure we recruit athletes and coach them to the level we need them to be in.”FRIDAY, FEBRUARY 14, 2014 � ALLIGATOR, 15

Coach Bryan Shelton and the No. 
12 Florida men’s tennis team are more 
than ready to begin play at the ITA 
National Indoors Championships this 
weekend in Houston. 
UF clinched its berth into the event 
with the 4-2 win against TCU on Janu-
ary 26th at the ITA Kickoff. 
Despite Flori-
da’s 3-0 record to 
start the season, the team fell in 
two straight matches in Los Angeles against UCLA and USC on Feb. 1-2.
The two losses showed the team 
that it still have a lot of work to do. 
“We deﬁ  nitely got some great in-
formation about ourselves and two very good teams in UCLA and USC” Shelton said. 
“Now we have to do something 
with that information and close the gap.” 
The team will kick off the tourna-
ment Friday at 10 a.m. against No. 5 Ohio State. 
“They’re perennially a very good 
team — one of the top teams in the country year-in and year-out” Shel-ton said. 
Florida is seeking to reach the ITA 
National Men’s Team Indoor Cham-pionship ﬁ  nals for the ﬁ  rst time since 2003, as well as its ﬁ  rst title at the event. 
Said Shelton: “This team is hungry 
and ready to do what it takes.”

After a weekend of highs 
and lows at the National Team 
Indoor Championships, the 
Gators did not come away with 
an award.
Well, at least the team 
didn’t.
For the ﬁ  rst time in her ca-
reer, senior Olivia Janowicz was named the Southeast-ern Conference Player of the Week. 
The accomplishment was 
awarded to Janowicz after a career weekend at the national tournament, during which she 
compiled two upsets and led 
Florida to a 2-1 record against three top-20 opponents. Those three opponents are now ranked in the top 10.
The senior’s best match play 
came against No. 9 Southern California on Sunday. The un-ranked duo of Janowicz and 
freshman Kourtney Keegan 
upset USC’s seventh-ranked 
doubles team of Giuliana Ol-
mos and Zoe Scandalis. 
In singles play, Janowicz 
won her fourth match at the No. 1 spot when she defeated USC’s 13th-ranked Sabrina 
Santamaria, who was ranked 
No. 1 in the fall. Santamaria was the highest-ranked oppo-nent Janowicz has beaten in 
her collegiate career.
Janowicz also came away 
with a victory against North-
western’s Veronica Corning a day earlier, despite the team’s 
4-2 loss.
She has shown steady im-
provement while playing at the 
No. 1 spot. Of the three seniors 
on the team, she has been this 
season’s anchor at the one po-sition. 
However, it has not always 
been that way. Janowicz has 
often been overshadowed by 
more prominent members of the team.
“You got to remember, the last four years, the one spot 
has been occupied by two of 
the best players to ever play at college in my opinion in Lau-ren [Embree] and Allie [Will],” coach Roland Thornqvist said. 
“So I think our seniors feel 
that this is their team and this is their opportunity. They’ve earned it.”
After losing to Northwestern 
on Saturday, the Gators slipped to No. 5 in the ITA Rankings. Florida (6-1) will look to climb back when they return home to 
play No. 28 Florida State (5-2)

Junior J.D. Tomlinson has gar-
nered a number of accomplish-
ments in his golf career, but a Sun-
Trust Gator Invitational title is not 
among them.
“I personally have never won 
this tournament,” Tomlinson said, “so I think it’d be really cool to ﬁ  -
nally bring it back here.”
Florida’s men’s golf team 
will try to keep the trophy in Gainesville when it kicks off the two-day, 54-hole SunTrust Gator 
Invitational on Saturday morning 
at 8 a.m. at the Mark Bostick Golf Course. 
In the tournament’s 36-year his-
tory, the Gators have been success-ful, winning 23 team titles and 10 
medalist honors. They were espe-
cially dominant from 2004 to 2011, capturing eight consecutive team 
titles and two ﬁ  rst-place medalist 
honors from Jonas Blixt in 2005 
and Billy Horschel in 2009.
Florida’s winning ways in its 
lone home tournament have ta-
pered off in recent seasons. 
UF fell short of another title in 
2012, ﬁ  nishing third behind SEC opponent Auburn. Florida ﬁ  n-ished fourth last spring behind ri-
val Florida State.
The Gators are eager to start 
up a new winning streak, both on 
their home course and overall. 
“I think (this tournament) 
would be a good starting point to get a little momentum going,” ju-nior Eric Banks said. “We all feel comfortable here, sleeping in our own beds.”
A big reason why UF is feeling 
conﬁ  dent is because of its knowl-edge of the course.  
“We play this course at least 
three times a week, so we know it real well,” redshirt junior Santiago 
Gavino said. “The conditions play 
a little different this week than normal, but … I think we are ready 
for it.”
Course conditions will be less 
than ideal due to the rain forecast-
ed for Saturday. But over time, UF 
has gotten used to chipping and 
shooting in mud rather than on 
grass.
“The team’s coming off nice, 
conditioned golf courses coming 
out here; they’re not going to be 
used to it,” Tomlinson said. “So I 
think it’ll only give us an advan-
tage. Scores might be higher, but it 
should help us.”
Coach Buddy Alexander and 
his golfers believe that this 14-team ﬁ  eld, which includes ﬁ  ve top 25 
teams according to Golfstat.com, is 
one of the best that has come into 
Gainesville recently.
“It’s stronger than the years be-
fore, for sure, and that’s good for 
us because we’ll get more compe-tition, play against better players and show them what we have at 
home,” Gavino said.
The ﬁ  eld will begin with 36 
holes Saturday and conclude with 
18 on Sunday.
“We have something to prove, 
so I think it’ll be a good week for us,” Tomlinson said.Gators look to continue

Someone call Gainesville Regional Utili-
ties. McKethan Stadium has been suffering a 
power outage since June 2012.
After the loss of home-run hitters Mike 
Zunino and Preston Tucker to professional baseball, the Gators suffered for the lack of the long ball in 2013.
Taylor Gushue, Justin Shafer and Casey 
Turgeon all tied for the team lead with ﬁ  ve blasts — good for sixth on the 2012 squad.
But when Florida opens its season against 
Maryland tonight at 7, the Gators hope a mix of new sluggers and bulked-up return-ees will force pedestrians on Stadium Road 
to be wary of ﬂ  ying baseballs.
“Power is one part of it,” coach Kevin 
O’Sullivan said. “I think the power part, 
we’re better (at).”
Gushue was a microcosm of UF’s power 
struggle last season. As a freshman in 2012, 
he made a quick splash, belting a home run in his ﬁ  rst collegiate at-bat — a time when 
the then-18-year-old who left high school 
early should have been preparing for prom.
He ﬁ  nished his freshman season with 
ﬁ  ve home runs after struggling during con-ference play. When he took a more central 
role last year, he matched that total despite 
starting 20 more games.
Gushue was not alone. The entire team 
struggled to muster any type of power. Af-ter leading the country with 75 homers in 
2012 on the backs of Zunino and Tucker, the 
Gators struggled to launch 28 last year. 
“I guess it’s all about mentality that you 
have at the plate,” Gushue said. “Not put-
ting too much pressure on yourself in pres-
sure situations … I think this year it’ll be less 
because we have more bats in the lineup. We have guys who can get it done from top to bottom.”
Said ﬁ  rst baseman Zack Powers, who 
contributed three home runs last season: “I think we’ve improved on power from the last year.”
However, don’t expect Florida to get back 
to the level of the 2012 team. 
Like last season, the Gators want to focus 
more on the brand of small ball O’Sullivan instituted.
“We practice the little stuff all the time,” 
second baseman Casey Turgeon said. “Every guy on the team, whatever time they come up to the box, they’re ready to do those little things.”
But to a team that had only one player re-cord an on-base percentage greater than .350 
in 2013, driving in runs is crucial.
For that, the Gators hope some more 
players can step up and drive the ball.
One of those players is third baseman 
Josh Tobias, who has bulked up since hit-
ting .260 with only eight extra-base hits last season.
The junior said he weighed as much as 
210 pounds during fall practice — 10 pounds more than he weighed last season — and is back down to 205 now. “He’s always been really strong,” Gushue 
said. “But when we get in the weight room, he becomes a different animal.”
With nearly all of the Gators’ run pro-
ducers returning and an incoming group of freshmen the returnees have raved about, Florida hopes this season will end in cel-ebration rather than the disappointment of last year’s early postseason exit.
“We don’t have all the answers to the 
test,” Gushue said. “But we sure got a lot of them.”
