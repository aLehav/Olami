� THE CROWD GATOR CHOMPED 
WHEN THE CICERONES WON.
JENSEN WERLEY
Alligator Staff Writer jwerley@alligator.org
The Florida Cicerones has stepped into 
the national spotlight by taking the top prize 
in its ﬁ  eld.
The Cicerones has been named the Most 
Outstanding Organization in the nation by the Council for Advancement and Support of Education and its Afﬁ  liated Student Ad-
vancement Programs division, or CASE 
ASAP. 
The Cicerones received the award at the 
40th annual CASE ASAP national conference that took place Aug. 8-10 in New Orleans.
The awarding group is a nationwide net-
work of more than 300 student ambassador and student alumni association groups, ac-
cording to a Cicerones news release.
“It was a huge win for not only our execu-
tive board and delegates at the conference, 
but for every single member of the Florida 
Cicerones, past and present,” Cicerones 
President Blaire Shoor wrote in an email. 
The Cicerones were awarded Most Out-
standing Organization in its district in the spring, which automatically nominated them for the national award.
The top leaders for CASE ASAP ulti-
mately chose the winner based on programs within the organization and the university, said Shoor, a 21-year-old ﬁ  nance and infor-mation systems senior.
The Cicerones received its award on the 
last night of the conference in front of about 600 students.
“The coolest part was right after they 
called our name — we looked around the 
banquet [and] the audience was Gator 
chomping in applause,” Shoor said. “It is pretty surreal to be named best in the nation and to feel so supported at the same time.” 
Being titled top organization isn’t the 
only honor the Cicerones received.
Last year it was asked to co-host this 
year’s conference with Tulane University, said Lindsey Shaw, conference planning 
committee co-chair for the Cicerones. 
“It was an honor in itself that we were 
approached by the board of CASE ASAP to host it,” said Shaw, a 20-year-old communi-
cations sciences and disorders junior. 
Shaw said the Cicerones will take its 
award and use it to help drive it into the new 
school year.National award deems

about her two sons, who both

Alachua County Public 
Schools and Gainesville Po-lice Department have recently gone public with their own 
emergency notiﬁ  cation sys-
tems.
The school alert system, 
which launched this week, didn’t use taxpayer money because it was a free upgrade to existing software, said Ala-chua County Public Schools spokeswoman Jackie Johnson.
This instantaneous com-
munication can be a comfort 
to parents, Rhodenizer said, 
citing a school shooting Tues-day in DeKalb County, Ga.
“What if that happened at 
my sons’ school?” she said. “I feel like you almost can’t feel 
overcommunicated with by 
your school.”
Similarly, GPD released details about its recently de-veloped GPD ALERT system during a meeting with resi-
dents Wednesday night. 
Students and residents can 
now receive email and text message notiﬁ  cations about 
emergencies around the city, said GPD spokesman Ofﬁ  -
cer Ben Tobias. Anyone can 
register for the notiﬁ  cations through the department’s 
website. 
Tobias said GPD will send 
out an alert if there is a threat to public safety, such as a 
shooting or a natural disaster. 
“Everybody has a phone,” 
he said. “If we need to get in-formation out immediately, this is the way to do it.”Gainesville, schools offer text alerts

Amid the bustle of downtown 
Gainesville, a new light blue shop 
sits quietly on the corner of Univer-

In the window, a neon sign 
ﬂ  ashes the promise of fresh brewed coffee while a soft-serve vegan ice cream machine buzzes inside.
The Pop A Top Corner Store 
and Downtown Bodega is ofﬁ  cially open for business.
The store, which sports a “down-town bodega” sign, is owned by 
The Top restaurant’s owners, Scott 
Shillington and Hal Mendez, and it ofﬁ  cially opened its doors last 
week. 
Taking the place of what used to 
be clothing store Soul Train Stops, the bodega was added with the 
goal of spicing up the area with a big-city feel, said Pop A Top man-

Airplanes landing at Gainesville Re-
gional Airport, Gator fans cheering at 
Ben Hill Griffin Stadium and residents sleeping in downtown condos share something.
All three areas are governed by the 
same city noise ordinance.
Because the often loud and lively 
downtown area is held to the same noise standards as a quiet residential neigh-borhood, some local business owners said the ordinance could be stifling the growth of downtown Gainesville.
The owners of Boca Fiesta restaurant, 
located at 232 SE First St., have been communicating with the City Commis-sion about the indiscriminate ordinance. The restaurant received a noise citation from the Gainesville Police Department on Aug. 15.
“We’ve been at that location for a little 
over four years, and in that time, we’ve had hundreds of events,” said Boca Fi-
esta co-owner Warren Oakes.
Although it wasn’t the first, Oakes 
said, citations have been few and far be-
tween. 
The restaurant hosts concerts and dance parties in the courtyard it shares with the Palomino Pool Hall, and these have occasionally garnered complaints, which have become more frequent re-cently.
“Something has changed, and it’s not 
us,” Oakes said. 
The rise in noise 
complaints may be a 
negative consequence to a positive change — more people living in downtown, said Dis-trict 2 City Commis-sioner Todd Chase.
“As downtown 
continues to evolve, 
and we have more residents down there mixed in with businesses, we are going to have to look at our different ordinanc-es that affect both and try to find a bal-ance,” he said.
Oakes said he and the other owners 
of Boca Fiesta are certainly not trying to limit the right of downtown residents to get a good night’s sleep.
“We live here; we work here; we’re 
neighbors,” Oakes said. “Really, we just want to have a dialogue about the kind of city that we want to live and work in.”Citywide noise ordinance

Guneeta Singh Bhalla is a physicist by day 
and a historian by night.
The 34-year-old UF alumna is the founder 
of the 1947 Partition Archive, a project com-
piling video and audio stories of survivors 
of India’s independence from British rule in 
1947. The partition of India and Pakistan re-sulted in carnage that affected millions.
A native of India, Singh Bhalla began col-
lecting stories while finishing her physics Ph.D. at UF in 2009. But once her last relative died with untold stories of the Partition that summer, Singh Bhalla realized the last few survivors were dying out.
“Before, there was no effort to document 
history, no information for us to learn from what people suffered,” she said. “It’s the last opportunity to do this.”
Fluent in Punjabi, Hindi and Urdu, she 
travels from her home in Berkeley, Calif., to Pakistan, India and Bangladesh collecting stories from aging survivors with her hand-held camcorder. 
Now, Singh Bhalla set aside her physics 
career to lead 150 volunteers for the project. She said her data-collecting skills from phys-ics help with her storytelling.
So far, Singh Bhalla has received 650 sto-
ries from eight countries, including Mexico and Israel. She said she hopes the project’s momentum will collect 10,000 stories by the 70th anniversary of the Partition in 2017 for display in museums around the country.
Anyone can become a citizen historian for 
the project by registering for a class on the project’s website, www.1947partitionarchive.org. A citizen historian collects the stories of Partition survivors with video or audio re-cordings and contributes to the project from anywhere in the world.
Metha Daoheung befriended Singh Bhalla 
while he was a UF student. While volunteer-ing in Nepal, the 34-year-old UF mathemat-ics alumnus took a trip to India and met up with Singh Bhalla. She and Daoheung would roam the streets for elders who might have stories of the Partition. 
Daoheung accompanied her around the 
country and took photos.
Although Daoheung isn’t South Asian nor 
does he speak the native Indian languages, he said his trip to India was emotional. He would cry along with those who told their stories — stories that haven’t been told for decades.
“How she affects everyone is amazing,” 
Daoheung said. “She’s giving it everything she has.”Alumna collects 650 stories from

were traveling in New York City. 
“They were hanging out in Brooklyn a 
lot and fell in love with the idea,” he said. “This was just an empty storefront, and it 
was a perfect opportunity to put something like this here — downtown Gainesville 
needs more business and liveliness.”
Seward said the bodega differs from other convenience stores because it offers 
fresh food, an eclectic beer and liquor vari-ety, and vegan soft-serve ice cream.
Though the bodega is new, Seward said 
the store already has regulars who shop there frequently and has proven a success 
among downtown workers.
“Like any business, it has waves,” he 
said. “There’s never parking downtown, so it’s a lot of foot traffic, but all the office 
workers downtown seem pretty excited about it.”
Pop A Top clerk Elizabeth McAlister 
agreed that the store’s location is prime.
“We have a lot of people coming in 
for coffee and lunch during the daytime,” she said. “I think on Friday and Saturday nights we’ll be successful when people are 
walking around downtown anyways…
they might come across us that way.”
The store opens at 8 a.m. and closes at 10 
p.m. However, McAlister said later closing times Thursday through Saturday and win-dow services may be coming in the future. 
Seward said that the objective for the bo-
dega is to keep it thriving while maintain-ing reasonable prices in a friendly environ-
ment.  
“One of the biggest goals is to have the 
food take off, get more and more unique beer and keep it really well-priced,” he 
said.  “We want the place to be comfortable, and I think we’ve succeeded in that.”“It’s really neat to go to the confer-
ence and be looked up to, but also to 
help other schools,” Shaw said.
The Cicerones, which hasn’t received 
the top honor in years, gives tours on campus and is responsible for the stu-dent alumni association, among other tasks. Its members do so voluntarily and are unpaid.
“We run off of appreciation, respect 
and recognition,” she said.
Shoor said that while at the confer-
ence, the group was able to get many 
ideas from other schools and will apply 
them to the UF organization. 
“Winning this award means that we 
are the best in the nation, but it doesn’t 
mean we don’t have room to grow,” Shoor said. “If anything, I think win-
ning this award pushes us to be inno-
vative and to continue to work hard to serve the university in the best way pos-sible.”THURSDAY, AUGUST 22, 2013 � ALLIGATOR, 5

Rachel McGovern’s campaign-
ing paid off.
McGovern, a 21-year-old politi-
cal science and geography senior, 
was elected at the national College Democrats of America’s conven-tion in Washington, D.C., as the 2013-2014 National Council Chair on the CDA’s executive board.
She said she will now be the 
voice of the state federations on the executive board for the orga-nization.
The CDA is a nationwide orga-
nization with the primary goal of registering voters. It is the official youth branch of the Democratic National Committee. “My entire college career has 
been about CDA,” said McGov-ern, who had been campaigning for the position since June.
She has been involved with the 
organization since her freshman year, holding the position of Vice President of Florida College Dem-ocrats last year.
Matthew Metz, the National Director of Communications of the College Democrats of America, said he looked forward to working with McGovern. 
“Having an Executive Board 
member from University of Flori-da speaks strongly to the school’s dedication to fostering a recogni-tion of the importance of public service,” he said in a news re-lease.
McGovern said she has always 
been a passionate Democrat with values in line with the Democratic Party. 
“I knew I wanted to make a 
difference,” she said. “And I felt that getting involved with College Democrats of America at UF, then nationally, was the best way.”

Congress needs the 
John Hughes 
treatment
Brace yourselves — another wave of sequestration is com-
ing. And no, it has nothing to do with horses. 
The sequester, for those of you who are behind on 
episodes of “The Colbert Report,” is a set of automatic spend-ing cuts put into effect by the Budget Control Act, signed into 
legislation by President Obama in August 2011. 
The purpose of the bill, which raised the debt ceiling, was to 
pressure factions of Congress into collaborating on a long-term 
plan to reduce the national deficit. If not, the sequestration would mandate $1.2 trillion in budget cuts over 10 years. 
Plot twist: It didn’t work. The threat of all-around spending cuts did absolutely noth-
ing to effect change. According to USA Today, Congress broke for its summer recess with the budget situation still dangling 
like the world’s most horrible booger. 
 “The House and Senate were unable to pass spending bills 
that would either conform to across-the-board sequester cuts 
or at higher numbers set by the 2011 Budget Control Act,” Stateline reporter Elaine Povich wrote. “If the impasse is not settled by Oct. 1, the start of the fiscal year, the federal govern-ment could shut down, adding to the fiscal bedlam.”
Of course it’s no big surprise. According to the Washing-
ton Post, Congressional members’ salaries are not affected by 
the across-the-board spending cuts. The Office of Management 
and Budget, the agency in charge of executive branch money matters, has remained tight-lipped on why Congressional sala-ries will escape unscathed from sequestration. 
In the meantime, programs such as Head Start, the federal 
pre-K education service for low-income families, are facing sharp budget cuts. The Huffington Post reported on Monday that Head Start was forced to cut services for more than 57,000 students as a result of the sequestration. 
A lot’s at stake here, guys. If Congress can’t reach an agree-
ment, the budgets for education, scientific research, the mili-tary, law enforcement, disaster relief and other programs that benefit basically everyone — regardless of political persuasion — will be slashed. 
For now, Republicans’ and Democrats’ previous attempts 
to propose budget plans have been to no avail. 
According to Business Insider in February, the Democrats’ 
proposed American Family Economic Protection Act included 
raising $54 billion in revenues by implementing the “Buffet 
Rule.” Income above $1 million would be taxed at 30 percent. It was ultimately shot down. 
Congress, it seems, could benefit from a good old-fashioned 
Saturday detention. Perhaps the deficit-reduction plan could be framed as a group essay? Would Simple Minds be up for a reunion appearance? Will Nancy Pelosi give John Boehner her diamond-stud earrings?  And when the members of Congress 
get rowdy, can Obama come in and say, “The next time I come 
in here, I’m crackin’ skulls”?
Chalk it up to wishful thinking.

The debate over the legalization of marijuana may 
have just received an unexpected boost from a prominent news organization’s medical corre-
spondent.
CNN’s Dr. Sanjay Gupta hosted a special report that 
aired on CNN about two weeks ago — and several times since — that lends another perspective to the drug war 
over cannabis.
Why is this important?
Other than the fact that the most recognizable cable 
news channel spent an hour talking about weed — didn’t realize they were that desperate for ratings — Gupta 
was once a vocal opponent of legalizing marijuana.
In 2009, he wrote a lengthy article for TIME titled 
“Why I Would Vote No On Pot.”
It seems as though he’s changed his mind.Gupta’s special report uncovered the medicinal and 
positive uses for marijuana. While developing the re-
port, the information he gathered about people who use marijuana for medicinal purposes proved to be so eye-opening that he retracted his earlier statements and 
apologized for being one of the people who propagated 
the myth that marijuana has no medicinal qualities and is a dangerous drug.
If you haven’t seen it, in a nutshell, Gupta looks at 
the other side of the argument and talks with people who have benefited from the use of marijuana.
He appeared on “Anderson Cooper 360” to speak 
with Cooper and wanted to clarify his position on pot.
“There are many substances out there — some of 
which are legal — that you’re more likely to abuse than marijuana,” Gupta said.
In his CNN special, he discussed a little girl with 
bouts of seizures so strong, they could potentially be 
fatal — if the powerful drugs she’s taking to treat it 
doesn’t kill her first. He discussed cancer patients in Is-rael who inhale the vapor in order to ease the pain of chemotherapy and regain their appetite. 
Marijuana is still illegal at 
the federal level and only 20 states and the District of Co-
lumbia have made it legal for medicine — so the time hasn’t yet arrived where you can smoke a joint as casu-
ally as you would smoke a cigarette.
Marijuana, according to the Drug Enforcement Ad-
ministration, remains a Schedule I drug.
“Schedule I drugs, substances or chemicals are de-
fined as drugs with no currently accepted medical use and a high potential for abuse,” the DEA website states. 
“Schedule I drugs are the most dangerous drugs of all the drug schedules with potentially severe psychologi-cal or physical dependence.”
Gupta confirmed that it’s not as dangerous as it’s 
been made out to be — after all, have you ever heard of an overdose on pot?
The nation tried Prohibition in the early 1900s, and 
all that led to was more creative ways of making, selling 
and drinking alcohol, and it pressured organized-crime 
leaders to adopt sneakier and more sinister business practices.
It’s similar to being told not to use too much anti-
bacterial gel. You create an environment that kills all the benign bacteria — the legal alcohol sellers, regu-lated and monitored — and make room for more ma-lignant and deadly bacteria to grow and thrive — the underground bootleggers.
Prohibiting marijuana isn’t going to stop people 
from using it, and if, as shown in this documentary, some people can actually benefit from the use, who are we to deny them the only treatment that might provide 
them relief?

Kevin Bradshaw was supposed 
to be a basketball legend.
When he finished his senior 
year of college in 1991, he had 
broken a long-standing record for single-game scoring.
The Gainesville native had os-
tensibly earned a place in history as one of the greatest college bas-ketball players ever. But the NBA didn’t draft him, and weeks later he was sleeping in the streets of San Diego.
Bradshaw isn’t dead, though. 
An award-winning documentary film about his life before and after his NCAA days will open at the Hippodrome State Theater on Fri-day.
“Shooting For Home” retraces 
Bradshaw’s life from 2008 all the way back to 1983. It maps his re-turn from Israel, where he was a professional basketball player and coach, back to his early acclaim on the basketball court of Gaines-ville’s Buchholz High School.
“Everyone in town pretty much 
knew Kevin was the best player in the city at the time,” said former teammate Greg Kappy, who wrote, directed and produced the film.
“He was scoring 30 points per 
game back before there was even a three-point line.”
Courted by major college bas-
ketball programs, including the University of Florida’s, Bradshaw defied expectations when he chose to attend Bethune-Cookman Uni-versity in the fall of 1983.
“Nobody could really under-
stand why someone so good was going to this tiny little school that no one had ever heard of,” Kappy said.And nobody tried to under-
stand, Kappy said. For the better part of the past 30 years, Kappy said he thought his former team-mate, who had problems with drugs and violence outside of school and basketball, was dead.
“We kind of heard that he broke 
Pistol Pete’s record” in 1991, Kap-py said, referring to the 69-point single-game scoring record set by Pete Maravich in 1970. Bradshaw scored 72 points in the Jan. 5, 1991, game, according to ESPN.
But after the small buzz that 
season, Bradshaw disappeared, Kappy said. Fast forward almost 20 years. Kappy had relocated from Gainesville to Los Angeles, where he was working as a film lo-cation manager after completing a screenwriting program at Univer-sity of California, Los Angeles.
He said he thought Bradshaw 
was dead until 2010, when he re-ceived a phone call from his for-mer teammate.
“It was almost like I had heard 
from a ghost,” Kappy said. “He called me up out of the blue. I don’t know how he got my number.”
Kappy traveled to San Diego to 
meet with Bradshaw, who told him the story that he had been wanting to write ever since screenwriting school, he said.
“It just seemed like it was 
speaking to me in so many ways.” Kappy pitched the idea to Brad-
shaw to turn his story into a film, 
and they’ve been “off to the races 
ever since.”
The film took almost two years 
to complete, Kappy said. After 
showing at film festivals in Califor-
nia and central Florida, “Shooting 
for Home” is home in Gainesville.
“The movie starts and ends in 
Gainesville,” Kappy said. “Kevin 
kept going farther and farther 
away from home, to Daytona, to 
San Diego, to Israel, then all the 
way back home.”
The opening screening of the 
film is Friday at 6 p.m. Tickets are 
$7.50. For more screening times,

Those looking to buy nail polish remov-
er at CVS no longer have to worry about 
bringing their IDs.
CVS recently implemented a new policy 
in some states that requires patrons to show 
identification when purchasing products 
containing acetone or iodine. The decision was made because both chemicals are es-sential ingredients in the illegal production of methamphetamine.
Meth, a Schedule II controlled substance, 
is the highly addictive drug at the center of AMC’s critically acclaimed chemistry-teacher-turned-drug-lord drama “Breaking 
Bad.”
The show started airing its final eight ep-isodes of its fifth season earlier this month, 
after receiving more than 150 award nomi-nations. Three of those nominations ended in Emmy wins for Bryan Cranston’s portrayal of Walter White, the show’s main character who goes by the street name Heisenberg.
The latest episodes reveal Walter White 
is not out of the profitable business, despite 
the return of his cancer. In fact, his business 
is stronger than ever, after making a deal to ship his product internationally and losing his partner in crime, Jesse Pinkman, in the second part premiere.
Jesse Pinkman is played by Aaron Paul, 
who won two Emmys for his supporting role on the show. Pinkman left the drug business with a bang by randomly scatter-CVS breaks bad chemical

Something is emerging on campus. 
Maybe it is the heat that brought them 
out.
The first time I saw them, I was taken 
aback. I thought it was a one-time sighting 
-- like seeing someone wear a FSU shirt to 
class. But no, they have become as frequent a presence as the protestors at Turlington. 
They are the crescent-shaped bare un-
dersides of UF students wearing shorts with hems that arch up like disbelieving eyebrows. And this trend is not the result of an overzealous attempt to cut off den-im jeans, but rather an intentional design 
choice. 
The exposure most famous for the start of the “underbutt” trend was Rihanna’s 
revealing tweet of her bum. She almost full-mooned the world, wearing denim shorts that were cut into a thong in the back. Though the tweet was quickly taken down, the impression was made. 
Miley Cyrus followed suit with cheeky 
shorts that, though modest in comparison 
to Rihanna’s, are what’s being shown off 
on campus.  
Wolfgang owner, Matthew Turner, 31, 
said his shop does not sell any shorts of the “underbutt” variety. “I am a fan of girls wearing high-waisted jean shorts, but if your butt is falling out of them, it is prob-ably not best to wear in public,” he said. “Keep it classy.”  Underbutt overdose at UF

It’s not common for a popular 
band to come from a college town, 
but Gainesville has hatched some very cool musicians. Among them, 
about 21 years ago, came the ska-
punk-rock band, Less Than Jake.
The quintet of dudes (four at-
tended UF) have found a follow-
ing not only from The Swamp but 
around the world; touring with 
Warped Tour for more than a de-cade and touring in places like Ja-pan, the U.K. and South America.
Last year, the band decid-
ed to do a two-night show in Gainesville for friends, fans and family — something it had always wanted to do but typically had conflicts with touring. The event was called Wake and Bake Week-end, and with the turnout and fun they had, the guys decided to start making it an annual thing.
“The Wake and Bake Weekend 
is because of the success we’ve had, we’re allowed to do some-thing like three nights of shows in our hometown and just be able to make an event for long-time fans and new fans to be able to sort of hear the history of Less Than Jake,” drummer and lyricist Vin-
nie Fiorello said. “We’re primarily 
a live band as well. If you’re a fan of the band and haven’t seen us live, you’re missing out on a huge portion of who we are.”
Less Than Jake’s 2nd Annual 
Wake and Bake Weekend will be-gin Aug. 30 and finish Sept. 1 with the band headlining each night af-ter opening acts of similar music 
genres.
“[The bands opening] are not only bands that we think people 
will love but bands that have had some involvement with us,” bass-ist and vocalist Roger Manganelli said.  
This year’s event will include 
a Less Than Jake yard sale, which will give fans the opportunity to buy rare items like old records and stage props. The band mem-bers will be hosting a tailgate during the Gators game and play-ing an acoustic show on Sunday morning. They will also be play-ing “Anthem,” one of their most popular records, in its entirety Sunday night. “Anthem” is cel-ebrating its 10th anniversary this year and features the popular song “The Science of Selling Your-
self Short.” 
The High Dive is a meaning-
ful place for the band. It’s where 
Manganelli first saw and was inspired by Green Day and The Mighty Mighty Bosstones in the early ’90s, when it was called The Covered Dish. Less Than Jake played one of its first club shows there.“It’s a place that has a lot of his-
tory for the band but also a lot of history for the Gainesville music scene,” Fiorello said. “It’s a cool place for us to be able to play and 
do more than just one night.”
Fiorello gave some insight on 
how the band has continued to 
strive for more than two decades.
“Not to be cliche, but it’s just 
hard work,” he said. “You have that side of it, which is what we put in, but the other side of it is what we get out, and I think that the fans have been there and kind of fueled that engine for the band to keep going. You need both sides in order for the band to have longevity.”
Tickets can be purchased in 
advanced for $15 for each night by searching “Less Than Jake” at www.ticketweb.com. The High Dive is an 18 and older venue un-less accompanied by a parent or guardian. A $2 under-21 fee will be charged at the door.
Just to add some more hype, 
the band has recorded and will release its newest 13-track album, 
“See The Light,” on Nov. 12.
“The new record is all about 
the light at the end of the tunnel,” 
Fiorello said.
It is very true to the band.  
Songs were written and played in their local warehouse and record-ed at Mangelli’s studio, Moat-house Productions.
“Every record that we’ve done 
is different. I think this is the first record that we’ve done in a long time that is one cohesive thought, and that’s what an album is sup-posed to be,” Fiorello said. “This album feels like a complete thought from start to finish.”
The band will begin its North 
American Fat Wreck Chords tour for the new album at the start 
of November. The dates can be 
found at its website, www.lesst-hanjake.com/shows. Until then, local fans are encouraged to come to the High Dive next weekend.
“We hope to see everyone at 
Wake and Bake,” Manganelli 
said. “It’s awesome to be from 
Gainesville and feel hometown love; some bands don’t get that. Gainesville really embraces us be-ing around for 21 years.”

From malls to music festivals to univer-
sity campuses, you will see the young get-
ting behind the trend. And I wonder, is this the first of many fashion crazes I am not go-ing to understand? Though I have grown 
out of my teenage years, I’m still young. I 
like fashion; I’m not prudish, but I think these shorts would be uncomfortable and problematic. 
Walking across campus right now is like 
taking a trip to the sauna, but immediately having to go to work before you have time to towel off. I can just imagine the wet blobs of human dough protruding from cinched 
hems sitting and sticking to bus seats and 
lecture hall chairs. I would prefer to main-tain the divide between public toilets and all other seats. 
And I am not alone. Chloe Dye, 23, albeit 
not a teenager, said she would not wear the risqué shorts and would rather no one else would either. “I wouldn’t want to sit down in a lecture hall class chair if I knew some-
one with underbutt had been sitting there,” 
the UF art history graduate student said. 
But besides the discomfort, I wonder 
about the professionalism. I can see these shorts working at Bonaroo, where it is so-cially acceptable to wear body paint, con-tinually flash the peace sign, become spon-taneously patriotic and do drugs, all at the same time. However, I don’t know see how 
you transition that look to an atmosphere 
constituting professors and academia. 
Yet, women’s fashion is constantly 
evolving, and social norms continue to change. 
Co-editor of the “History of Fashion” 
and master teacher of costume studies at New York University Nancy Deihl wrote in an email that “Women’s fashion depends on novelty, and sometimes the only thing 
that can be new about an established part 
of the wardrobe is how it is worn.” 
Shorts are obviously not new — actress 
Catherine Bach of “The Dukes of Hazzard” and model Marilyn Monroe wore down those barriers, so now designers are trying to figure out a way to one-up the style, she said. 
“The ‘underbutt’ is a real challenge for 
many women as you have to be shapely plus in shape for that crucial indentation to exist!” she said. “It’s a style that exists be-cause our culture is driven by change and 
fascinated by public nudity, even in small 
portions.”
The question now is, where will fash-
ion go from here? Will the next semester’s trend be the two-fifth shorts?
What will happen to the canned, come-
dic trope where the protagonist dreams of going out in his underwear, when this dream (or nightmare), depending on your 
perspective, has become reality?

butts , from page 7Fashion is changing, but this trend is just gross
ing his $5 million earnings throughout 
the streets of the New Mexico slums.
The move caught the interest of detec-
tives who brought him in for question-ing. And whose interrogation room does 
he end up in? None other than Drug En-
forcement Administration agent Hank Schrader, brother-in-law of Walter, who just discovered Heisenberg has been hid-ing in plain sight the whole time.
Heisenberg’s arrest seems imminent, 
but nothing about this show is predict-able.
One thing, however, is for sure: 
Heisenberg is international, and he’s go-ing to need a lot of nail polish remover. Yet it’s safe to say he doesn’t shop at CVS, and neither do real life meth cooks.
CVS executives realized this after an 
onslaught of social media outrage. The company posted an announcement on its official Facebook page reversing the ID requirement in most states in an effort 
“to ensure customer convenience.”
“Purchases of products containing ac-
etone, including nail polish remover, will 
no longer require an ID,” the statement read. It continued to explain the “revised policies will take effect before the end of this week.”

The first date is going well. The 
young couple is having a great time. 
The food is delicious.
As the meal comes to a close, 
the waiter brings the check. He and she look at the bill, each wondering 
whether the traditional, chivalrous guy should pick up the bill, or they should be a modern couple and come to some other arrangement.
A recent study from Chapman 
University shows men are still be-lieved to pay for most of the expens-
es in a relationship.
According to the study, present-
ed by David Frederick, 84 percent of men and 58 percent of women  re-
ported men pay most expenses.
Laurel Barksdale, a 21-year-old psychology senior, said the model of dating has been worn out.
“I get very uncomfortable with 
that,” she said. “I feel like that expec-tation is old and outdated.”
The better option is to split the 
bill, she said.
Tom Nelson always expects to 
pay unless his date suggests they split the bill.
“You don’t want to go in with only enough for yourself and then 
leave her hang-
ing,” said the 18-year-old explor-
atory freshman.
As time goes 
on, more costs may be split, he said.
“If you ask a girl out, it’s kind of 
your responsibility,” Nelson said.
Considering some college stu-dents can consider leftover Chipotle 
and a Diet Coke gourmet, an even 
better option is to have a first date 
that is cheap or nearly free.
Barksdale’s first date with her 
current boyfriend was simply sitting underneath the night sky at Paynes Prairie.
“It was romantic in its own right 
… we got to talk,” she said. “And it’s free.” Both sides of a couple prefer that men pay the bill, study saysdating
� SHE TOLD OPRAH ABOUT HER 
EXPERIENCES IN REHAB.

The controversy that surrounded Lind-
say Lohan for years has given her a repu-
tation of being inconsiderate and messy. Recently, however, she has been finding ways to rebuild her image and heal from 
addiction. 
Considering America’s obsession with 
her past failures, it would only make sense that Americans would be following her re-
covery with equal fervor. 
Oprah Winfrey recently interviewed 
her as part of a documentary series called “Oprah’s Next Chapter,” in which she cov-ers the journey LiLo took through rehab and what is different now. The interview 
aired Sunday on the Oprah Winfrey Net-
work and got a lot of attention from the press because of Lindsay’s honesty and open confessions to her addiction. 
There is also a fan site, www.lindsaylo-
han.com, which since her interview with Oprah has attracted media attention. It fo-cuses on the improvements she is making to her life and includes a picture with the talk show host. 
But some people don’t have any inter-
est in her life or her condition. 
“I don’t want to think about Lindsay Lo-
han, but the press doesn’t really make that possible,” said Alex Borkholder, a 19-year-old UF political science sophomore.
Although LiLo may have been a popu-lar conversation topic a few years ago, she seems to be sinking into irrelevance. 
However, the press has reported every 
detail of Lindsay Lohan’s path to recovery. She is taking steps to turn her life around, and her interview suggests she would ap-preciate more privacy than the media has 
granted her in the past.
With all this attention, it is surprising 
the interview has not gone viral and is not 
a hot topic of local conversation. 
“I would be happy to see her do better, 
but I am not emotionally invested in her life,” said Justin Dourado, a 20-year-old UF neurobiological sciences junior. Post-rehab Lindsay Lohan: Is she recovering or irrelevant?
“I don’t want to think about

As long as you know how to DJ, it doesn’t matter what you think about 
while masturbating. A fantasy is perhaps the normal thing to do. Ryan Gosling 
shirtless licking your body like a dripping ice cream cone, you know, the usual. Girls could think about anything though. For example, pizza, the super cute top you just ordered online, how awesome or horrible your boobs look, deadlines, student loans, that sad homeless lady you saw on the way home, etc. The mind is a weird and irresponsible thing when masturbating. Sure, we try to stick to anything involving Ryan Gosling and all things consumed by licking, but any-thing could come to mind when your body is practically performing an exorcism on itself. We just hope our school counselor or dead dog doesn’t come to mind.There is no set time for something like this. You need to do what feels 
right. If there is progress, it could take longer to see where it leads or how long it 
actually lasts. Do not let the amount of time you’ve been in a relationship justify why you two should stay together. When you are exhausted of trying to make things work and you feel there is nothing left to give, that’s when you should bite the bullet. When one of you gives up on the other, it’s time to move on.Dear Mediocre Advice,
What do girls think about when they masturbate?Dear Mediocre Advice,

In the clear
The University of Miami announced Wednesday it will 
enforce the “all clear” bag policy when the Hurricanes and Gators play on Sept. 7 in Sun Life Stadium.Redshirt freshman Marcus Maye has big shoes to fill in the UF secondary. Read the story on page 16.ADAM LICHTENSTEIN
Alligator Staff Writer @alichtenstein24
When Florida brought in Adam Lane and Kelvin Taylor as 
part of its 2013 recruiting class, each was expected to compete 
for a position near the top of the depth chart.
With 1,000-yard rusher Mike Gillislee playing in the 
NFL and projected starter Matt Jones recovering from a 
viral infection, the two freshmen were given an early op-portunity to make a splash.
But with the Gators’ season debut against Toledo fewer 
than two weeks away, both tailbacks are buried on the depth 
chart. 
Junior Mack Brown is expected to start with Jones out. 
Former walk-on Mark Herndon, who received a scholarship following UF’s practice on Tuesday, is currently the Gators’ backup running back. Converted safety Valdez Showers has also impressed in practice and is No. 3 on the depth chart.
“The young guys have got to continue to show their im-
provement in practice,” offensive coordinator Brent Pease said on Wednesday.
Lane and Taylor have struggled at times during Florida’s 
fall camp. Coach Will Muschamp has praised their ball-carry-ing ability, but he said there are several areas where the fresh-men must improve.
“They’re very talented runners,” he said on Aug. 19. “So 
much more goes into it other than just running the football. 
They’ve got to take a step.”
What has been the duo’s biggest hindrance to this point?
“No. 1 is ball security,” Muschamp said. “You’ve got to take care of the football.”
Pease said the coaching staff has a “pretty good idea” about 
who will earn playing time during the year and which players will redshirt. If one or both runners fail to impress, they could sit out this season.
“We’ve got to find the spot that, at least with one of them, 
whichever we decide to play … is that we’re going to get them some repetitions in the game,” Pease said.
While Lane and Taylor have fallen on the depth chart, 
Herndon and Showers have been making their case for game reps.
Herndon played in six games on special teams last year 
as a walk-on freshman but was impressive enough during the first three weeks of camp to earn a scholarship. Pease said Herndon stepped up during practices and ran for consistent 
yardage — including rushing for more than 90 yards during 
a recent scrimmage.
“He works hard every day,” Pease said. “He’s got a great 
attitude to be around, and he just keeps grinding. And he got rewarded for what he’s done.”
Said Herndon: “They’ll find somewhere to put me in 
where I’ll succeed.”
Showers was touted more than Herndon when he came 
to Florida — at a different position. He was rated a three-star 
cornerback by Rivals.com and redshirted his freshman year 
before playing in 11 games last season. 
When Showers last worked out of the backfield, he rushed 
for 2,024 yards and 29 touchdowns as a high school senior.
Showers moved to running back this fall and has made his 
mark on the team. Pease compared him to former UF multi-purpose back Omarius Hines.
“He is natural,” Pease said. “He’s got great speed and 
brings in kind of that scatback-type of runner. 
“All of a sudden you have the pounding back who’s run-
ning it downhill then all the sudden you spread him out and this guys hitting creases.”Freshman tailbacks struggling early

JOE MORGAN
Alligator Staff Writer @joe_morgan
To defensive coordinator D.J. 
Durkin, age is just a number for Jon-
athan Bullard and Dante Fowler Jr. Both sophomores will play key roles in Florida’s pass rush in 2013.
“They may be young in terms of 
their second year in the program, but they’ve played a lot of snaps,” Dur-kin said. “In terms of football life, they’re not young guys anymore.”
Bullard and Fowler saw action in 
13 games each as freshmen. Fowler and Dominique Easley lead all re-turning Gators with 8.5 tackles for 
loss last season. Bullard recorded 
five tackles for loss and led UF with seven quarterback hurries in 2012.
With a year of experience under 
each player’s belt, both will see more responsibility.
Bullard will play inside and out-
side on the defensive line. Fowler takes on a larger role at Buck line-
backer, where he will rush the passer 
as well as drop back into coverage. 
“Both those guys are mature,” 
Durkin said. “They’re mature young men. They were that way coming in. It’s not often true freshman, espe-cially up front, play, but they were able to handle themselves already 
last year. It’s not just how you do on 
the field. It’s how you handle your-self in meetings and everything off the field. Those guys are great.”
Life without Sturgis: Given Flor-
ida’s offensive struggles in 2012, of-fensive coordinator Brent Pease had his work cut out for him. Fortunate-ly, with Caleb Sturgis at his disposal, 
Pease only needed to get the Gators 
to the 35-yard-line to score points.
Now Miami Dolphins offensive 
coordinator Mike Sherman has that luxury, and Pease needs to reach the 25-yard-line for competing kickers Brad Phillips and Austin Hardin.
“I’ve never been in that situa-
tion where you had such a luxury 
of a kid saying ‘OK, we’re at the 40, 
we’re good. He can boot it in from here,’” Pease said. “Now you’ve got to probably say to yourself, ‘OK, I’ve got to get one more first down.’”
While Sturgis recently earned the 
starting job in Miami over veteran Dan Carpenter, UF is still undecided on which man will take over the pri-
mary kicking duties. A groin injury hampered Phillips early in camp, 
prolonging the competition between them.
“Brad’s kicked 
in live situations before in game; he has that experi-ence,” coach Will Muschamp said on Aug. 16. “I’ve been pleased with Austin’s progress 
through camp. 
And Brad, when healthy, has kicked 
the ball well. We haven’t made a de-cision.”
Bostic fined: The NFL fined Chi-
cago Bears linebacker and former Gator Jon Bostic $21,000 on Wednes-day for his hit on San Diego Char-gers wide receiver Mike Willie on 
Aug. 15.
“That was such a bang-bang 
play,” Durkin said. 
“Obviously, I don’t think he was 
intending to do anything with it. I 
just texted him a little bit ago … and I said, ‘The good news is, you have the money now that you can go pay that. The bad news is you just got 
fined that.’”NFL.com originally described the 
hit in a video description as “spec-
tacular” before changing it in wake 
of the fine. Many Gators agreed with 
that original assessment.
“The clip of that hit? It was pretty 
popular,” Durkin said. “Coaches, players alike — everyone looked at it. Obviously we’re all really proud of him. You can’t find a better guy than Jon Bostic to represent our program. All the guys feel strongly 
about that, so everyone was talking 
about it.”
2014 schedule released: Will 
Muschamp will face his mentor for the second time as a head coach when Nick Saban and Alabama host Florida on Sept. 20, 2014. 
The road game is part of the 
Gators’ 2014 schedule, released by 
the Southeastern Conference on 
Wednesday.
Alabama has had Florida’s num-
ber in recent matchups, winning three straight games by a combined score of 101-29. The Crimson Tide defeated the Gators 38-10 in The Swamp during their most recent meeting in 2011, scoring 28 unan-
swered points to seal the win.LSU remains Florida’s fixed 
SEC West crossover opponent and 
will come to Gainesville on Oct. 11, 
2014.
With the Tigers and the Crimson 
Tide on their schedule, the Gators 
will not travel to face the Razorbacks next season after hosting them this year on Oct. 5.
Florida opens SEC play in 2014 
on Sept. 13 by hosting Kentucky, starting its league schedule against 
an opponent besides Tennessee for 
the second time in three seasons af-ter doing it only once since 1996.
The Gators will play the Volun-
teers in Knoxville on Oct. 4 after fac-ing the Wildcats and the Crimson Tide in preceding SEC matchups.  UF will make a second trip to Ten-nessee to face Vanderbilt in Nash-
ville on Nov. 8.
Florida plays Georgia in Jackson-
ville on Nov. 1, hosts South Carolina 
on Nov. 15 and travels to Tallahas-see on Nov. 29 to play Florida State.
Other games include home dates 
against Idaho on August 30, Eastern Michigan on September 6, Missouri on Oct. 18 and Eastern Kentucky on 
Nov. 22.

Redshirt freshman safety Marcus Maye catches passes in a 
drill during practice on Monday. Maye and junior Cody Riggs are the projected starters at safety after three weeks of practice.
  ADAM PINCUS
 Alligator Staff Writer @adamDpincus
   LSU lined up at its own 21-yard 
line, trailing 7-6 with 5:15 remain-
ing in the third quarter in front of 90,824 fans at Ben Hill Grifﬁ  n Sta-
dium last Oct. 6. 
  Quarterback Zack Mettenberger 
had managed only six completions 
to that point as each team’s defense smothered the opposing offense. 
  Mettenberger, with the pocket 
collapsing on 3rd and 7, double-clutched and found receiver Odell 
Beckham Jr. streaking down the 
sideline for an apparent go-ahead 
touchdown. 
  Safety Matt Elam saved the day 
for UF instead. 
  With a heroic play, Elam caught 
Beckham and stripped the football at Florida’s 23. The Gators recov-
ered the ball and secured a win 11 plays later on a 12-yard touchdown 
by Mike Gillislee.
  The strip at The Swamp epito-
mized the safety’s signiﬁ  cance on a team that is now searching for de-
fensive playmakers. 
  Elam turned an All-American 
junior season into a starting spot 
with the reigning Super Bowl 
champion Baltimore Ravens. Josh 
Evans, his safety mate, was a sixth-round draft pick by the Jacksonville Jaguars and is now vying for play-ing time after a productive training 
camp.  With both players gone, Florida 
ﬁ  nds itself replacing top-two lead-ing tacklers with redshirt freshman 
Marcus Maye and junior Cody Riggs. 
  “Deﬁ  nitely big shoes to ﬁ  ll be-
cause those two guys were great 
in the secondary last year,” Maye 
said. “I’m going out there playing my own role, just being myself and 
making the plays that I can make. 
Not getting too worried about try-ing to be like other guys. Just try-ing to be myself.”
  While Riggs, who played in 28 
games to start his career before suf-fering a fractured foot that ended  
his season in Week 2 last year, is a 
proven commodity, the question 
remains: Who is Marcus Maye? 
  Maye enrolled early at Florida 
as an Under Armour All-American only to suffer a meniscus injury 
that spring, which steamrolled any shot of cracking the secondary ro-
tation. 
  Listed as 6 feet and 200 pounds, 
Maye looks the part of a strong safe-
ty; he’s a player that has to possess the strength to line up along the line of scrimmage and the agility to
