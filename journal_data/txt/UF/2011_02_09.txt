ATLANTIC CITY, N.J.  — A New Jersey 
appeals court has rejected a 15-year prison 
sentence for a man convicted of biting off a police officer’s fingertip.
Rafael Pichardo was convicted of ag-
gravated assault for attacking Atlantic City officers during a 2007 confrontation at the Casbah nightclub in the Trump Taj Mahal Casino Resort.
While resisting arrest, Pichardo bit Of-ficer Dean Dooley, severing the top of his gloved left index finger.
A judge imposed the 15-year term.But an appellate panel ruled Tuesday 
it was too severe and ordered Pichardo be resentenced. No date has been set.
Pichardo remains in prison.The bitten officer was able to return to 
work.

Rick Scott’s budget proposal has 
only been available to the public for 
three days, but it’s already caused some state legislators’ blood pres-sure to rise and Florida residents’ 
jaws to drop.
Scott’s $65.8 billion spending 
proposal for the 2011-2012 fiscal 
year represents a $4.6 billion cut to the state budget. The governor’s recommendations would slash bil-lions from state spending and taxes and would eliminate about 8,000 state government jobs.
He suggested cutting $3.3 bil-
lion from education. The amount of money spent per student would drop by $703, a 10 percent drop from the current rate of $6,843.51.
Scott hopes to reduce that cut 
to only $300 per student through money saved by his recommended changes to pension funds and a 
one-time federal government of-
fering of nonstimulus funds that would open local school money up for other uses.
Albert Matheny, a professor of 
political science at UF, said in an e-mail interview that cutting edu-cation spending takes away resi-dents’ abilities to think and work their way out of the country’s eco-
nomic crisis.
“It’s very clear to me that de-
funding education is all about at-
tempting to cre-
ate a docile and 
desperate work-force, willing to work harder and harder for less 
and less,” he said. 
“What Gov. Scott is seeking, in the end, is to turn 
Florida into a Third World state with a desperately poor, frightened and undereducated working popu-lation and a wealthy elite.”
Scott also wants to cut the state’s 
work force by 7 percent, or 8,645

Ashley Morrissey became a Gator on 
Feb. 11, 2010. 
After getting a text message from her 
friend, she went to check her UF applica-
tion status online. She didn’t expect to get in. 
But her application was accepted. She 
refreshed the page to make sure it was real. 
When she realized it was, she jumped 
around her room and screamed in celebra-
tion. 
“I was overcome with joy,” she said.
According to UF spokesman Steve Or -
lando, an estimated 11,000 out of 26,500 high school applicants across the country 
will find out Friday that they — like Mor -
rissey — are Gators. Of that 11,000, Orlando said 6,400 are 
expected to enroll. 
“I know it’s hard for some people to 
believe, but not everybody who is admit-
ted comes to the University of Florida,” he said. 
Orlando said one reason is that stu-
dents who are qualified to get into UF are also getting accepted to other top schools around the country.
“Part of it is a function of how com-
petitive it is now” he said. “Maybe a few years ago, the students we were admitting were deciding between UF, FSU and UGA. Now, the students are deciding between 
UF, Stanford and MIT.”
The competitive atmosphere has paid 
off for the university’s graduates, Orlando 
said. 
In a survey published by the Wall Street 
Journal in September, job recruiters listed UF as ninth in their top 10 schools to find new college graduates.
The average GPA of admitted students 
has been increasing steadily over the past 
eight years. In 2010, the average GPA of 
admitted students was 4.28.
Also, the average SAT and ACT scores 
of admitted students in 2010 were 1940.5 and 29 respectively.Michael Cornwell is one of the students 
waiting for an answer from the univer -
sity.
Cornwell, an 18-year-old senior at 
Gainesville High School, said UF is his first choice.
 He hopes to enter the mechanical engi-
neering program. 
However, he said he is unsure if he’ll 
get in. 
Though he scored a 30 on the ACT and 
has a 4.6 GPA, he said he can’t help but 
have his doubts. 
“My friends tell me I’m going to get in, 
but me myself I’m not so confident,” he 
said. 
If he is accepted, he plans to run a cel-
ebratory lap through the streets of his neighborhood, letting out a victorious “Yeah!”
But until Friday, Cornwell and all of 
the 26,000 others will be forced to wait for their turn to either celebrate like Morrissey or look for somewhere else to go.Applicants await UF acceptance notices

n   SHE IS NINE-MONTHS PREGNANT.
By KAT BEIN
 Alligator Staff Writer
 
  When Gainesville Police arrived early Mon-
day morning, they found a nine-months preg-
nant Ana Gainey beaten and bloody.
  The father of her child, 28-year-old Lavan 
Williams, came to see her at her home about an hour earlier. The two got into a ﬁ  ght, and when Gainey threatened to call the police, Williams jumped on top of her and choked her until she couldn’t breathe, according to a Gainesville po-
lice report.
  Gainey scratched at his 
face until he let her go and ran away . She locked the door behind him and called the po-lice, but he returned.
  On the 911 tape, Gainey 
can be heard screaming for 
Williams to stop as he began 
kicking down the front door.
  “Oh, you calling the police on me for real?” 
Williams said as he entered.
  Williams left before police arrived. They 
found Gainey breathing heavily and bleeding 
from her mouth.
  She told the ofﬁ  cer she thought he would 
come back, so he waited nearby, hidden from 
sight. He came back two hours later and was ar-
rested.
  Police charged Williams with aggravated bat-
tery on a pregnant woman, domestic battery by strangulation, burglary and criminal mischief.  Man arrested 
for beating his girlfriend

Progress Party candidate for Student Body President Dave Schneider speaks to the 
Student Senate about the negative effects of guns on campus.
n THE RESOLUTION PASSED WITH A 
VOTE OF 52-17.
By HANNAH WINSTON
Alligator Writer
It wasn’t a scene from a western shoot-
out, but Tuesday’s Student Senate meeting 
was full of heated debate. 
Senators voted 52-17 to approve a reso-
lution in opposition of Florida Senate Bill 
234, which, if passed, would allow guns on college campuses. 
A resolution is a piece of legislation that 
expresses the Senate’s formal opinion but takes no action.
Senators against the bill were split on 
whether to oppose the bill completely or to postpone the vote until more research was conducted to gauge student opinion. 
Sen. Carly Wilson, who represents the 
Unite Party, was in opposition of the reso-
lution.
Wilson, who is also the chairwoman of 
the UF College Republicans, said students 
have a right to carry a weapon if they 
choose to because it is protected by the 
Constitution.“This is not rocket science — this is the 
Second Amendment,” she said.
Dave Schneider, the Progress Party can-
didate for Student Body president, said he was against the idea of guns on campus.
He said he would prefer that new legisla-
tion be brought before the Senate calling for the prohibition of assault rifles for the UF Police Department in light of the shooting 
of graduate student Kofi Adu-Brempong 
last spring. 
“Weapons don’t have a place at an edu-
cational institution,” Sch-neider said.
Senators also voted to 
postpone the vote on a 
transparency bill so a committee could first investigate the legality of the legislation. 
The bill would have made all Student 
Government and Senate voting records and meetings available on the SG website. 
Some senators were concerned about 
whether future employees would be able 
to check on their votes later, while those in 
favor of the bill said the senators had noth-ing to hide. 
A bipartisan transparency committee 
will discuss on the legality of the bill before it can be brought back to the Senate floor.Senate passes resolution against guns on campus

The Alachua County Fair -
grounds may house offices in-
stead of medieval fairs.
The Alachua County Com-
mission unanimously decided 
Tuesday to have staff send let-
ters to county businesses to see if anyone would be interested in setting up shop on the current fairgrounds site. 
Commissioner Rodney Long 
did not vote due to a conflict of interest.
A new fairgrounds would be 
built on the corner of NE Waldo Road and NE 39th Avenue on land the county purchased about four years ago, said Assistant County Manager Rick Drum-
mond. Construction of the new site 
would cost about 
$22.3 million. 
The exist-
ing fairgrounds would remain 
in use until the new fairgrounds is ready to host events. 
Alachua County Commis-sioner Paula DeLaney said that 
having a business space near 
the Gainesville Regional Airport would be a good investment for the county.
Commissioner Susan Baird 
said she wasn’t sure if investing so much money in this project was a good idea.
She said that the commission 
is already stretched thin finan-cially.
“Gosh, my first inclination is 
table this until next year,” she said. 
“This isn’t the right project for 
the right time right now.”
Drummond said there isn’t 
a time line for creating the new fairgrounds yet, but he thinks construction could start in about 
two years.
“We’re still about three or 
four years out, even if everything 
breaks the right way,” he said.County discusses opening fairgrounds site to businesses

funding is the largestcut in budget
employee positions. About 2,000 of 
those jobs are currently vacant.
“What has kept us afloat 
over the last few years is, in fact, government spending on the 
economy,”Matheny said. “So re-
ducing government actually attacks the very entity that has forestalled an even worse economic situation brought on by the tax-cutting poli-cies of Gov. Scott’s predecessors.” 
Scott’s proposal must be ap-
proved by the state legislature in the spring. Matheny does not ex-
pect it to pass, nor does UF College 
Democrats President Stacy Eich-ner. 
“When lawmakers look back 
at their constituents they will see the overwhelming disapproval of 
this proposed bud-get,” Eichner said in an e-mail interview. 
“Compromises will 
need to be made if Gov. Scott wants 
to move forward.”
Eichner said an unwillingness to 
compromise by the governor may hurt his relationship with some state Republicans.
Daniel Smith, a UF political sci-
ence professor, expects state leg-islators to feel pressure from their constituencies to oppose at least some parts of the budget proposal, particularly cuts to education and social welfare programs.
“Legislators will be feeling the 
heat if they follow the recommen-dations of Gov. Scott for the bud-get,” he said. “I suspect they won’t 
as much.”

Today’s question: Do you text 
and drive?71% YES29% NO
129 TOTAL VOTESTuesday’s question: Could you eat an entire pizza in one sitting if you were really hungry?Unpatriotic Act
Maybe House Re-
publicans weren’t counting on their 
own turning their backs on the party. In a miscalcula-tion, they brought a bill to renew components of 
the Patriot Act to the floor 
faster but required a two-thirds majority to pass. The yeas to renew outnumbered the nays, but the difference 
wasn’t large enough.
As Republicans scratch 
their heads over why peo-
ple ostensibly against big 
government would frown 
upon roving wiretaps, we find ourselves agreeing with Dennis Kucinich. 
He tried to sway tea par -
ty members to the Demo-crats’ side by pointing out the obvious contradiction:
“How about the Patriot 
Act, which has the broadest reach and the deepest reach of government to our daily lives?”
Granting the FBI access 
to any tangible object con-cerned in a terrorism inves-tigation is an alarming idea when we think about it. 
Of course, we under -
stand the intent behind the law. What American wouldn’t want to keep terrorists away from our 
country? 
We’re once again stuck 
in that endless battle be-
tween civil liberties and security. 
Neither will be a definite 
winner, but it may be time for the GOP to step back and see what its own mem-
bers see: It’s time to get 
away from the Big Brother image we’ve cultivated so well for the past decade.Evolving Opinion
Educators dodge origin 
of life issue
A recent survey of public high school biology teach-ers showed they aren’t sticking to the National Re-search Council’s recommendations on evolution. 
With 28 percent of the teachers focusing only on evolution and 13 percent advocating creationism within the class-room, we’re left with 60 percent quiet and not wanting to stir up controversy by endorsing one theory over another. 
Let’s recap: educators are shying away from supporting 
the principles they’re trying to teach simply because they are dealing with a touchy subject.
This fear robs the students of an important discussion, 
proving that not rocking the boat also has its consequenc-
es. 
We’re not supporting bullheaded teachers on one side 
or the other, but knowing where a teacher stands can help 
explain his or her take on related topics. 
If you’ve ever had a politically leaning history profes-
sor, you know what we’re talking about. If an educator informs students about his or her biases, they can decide for themselves whether to take what the teacher is saying with a grain of salt.
The survey also leaves us wondering how openly 
staunch believers of creationism ever got jobs as biology teachers in the first place. Wouldn’t they have failed some exams along the way? 
Which brings us back to the start. Although we’d like 
to have a consistent way of dealing with our biggest ques-tion, we have to remember the guidelines really are just that – guidelines.
Medieval faire fun for nearly everyone
If you didn’t make it out to the 25th Annual Hog-
getowne Medieval Faire during these last two weeks, you missed out. I can hear the naysayers now: That 
little show is a nest of seedy Alachua County residents, their bawling, scurvy-ridden children and people with 
enough body hair to make you ponder when exactly 
shaving was invented. These are the kinds of people who blow their entire tax refund on anachronistic, dull-edged replica swords, furry-esque fox tails, hats and funnel cakes.
Excuse me? Bad-mouthing funnel cakes? I would 
don one of those suits of armor and crusade for funnel cakes, thank you very much. Ironic, because who even knows when fried dough of that caliber was invented? It 
looks like one of those accidental food concoctions: Some 
spilled some dough in the fryer, and, oh look at that, a little crispy pie thing. Yeah, accidental foods like funnel cakes are awesome. Nachos and milk (accident?) also come to mind. 
Enough about fried heaven. The festival itself is a tes-
tament to how awesome good ole fashioned medieval-themed fun can be. It’s easy to allow yourself to be a kid again the moment you walk inside those gates. Some guy 
in a tower spends hours heckling everyone who walks in, 
making everyone less self-conscious about how ridicu-lous they look by going out of his way to flaunt all the flaws he sees. If he gets to you, ask him how his acting career is working out.
If stepping into the fair isn’t enough to make you want 
to run around like a hobbit on PCP, then wait until you see the elephant. That’s right, there’s an elephant. Stare into its timeless eyes and admire its sad majesty. Then 
pay money to ride it and laugh when it poops. 
There are contests of all sorts, from archery to that hit-
the-hammer-make-the-bell-ring thing. Everywhere you 
walk there is the din of laughter and merriment. People are genuinely enjoying themselves. If you listen closely, some of the conversations can be quite revealing: “You have to admit, after 15 years of marriage, some of this stuff would come in 
handy for roleplaying.” Noted.
When you stop in for a show and watch comedic jug-
glers make children squirm with laughter, watch human chess pieces battle in mock combat and marvel at the fat-test elf you’ve ever seen in your life, all the while bran-dishing a turkey leg in one hand and mead in the other, it is nearly impossible to not get lost in the fun. 
There is also something truly amazing when you real-
ize all the music you’ve heard over the last three hours has come from real, live instruments and not from some 
tinny speakers hidden behind a plastic bush blasting Kel-
ly Clarkson and Nickelback.
If you went this year, I hope you had a blast. I’ve been 
a few times now, and this was easily the best one to date. If you haven’t been and wanted to go or if you wish you’d have known or been able to go, mark your calendar for next year. You won’t regret it. If you’re reading this and still have no desire to go because medieval make-believe nonsense is frivolous, I have a simple retort.
Have it your way. I’d better not catch you at any of the 
endless themed parties that you and your friends throw. If you think wrapping yourself in tinfoil for your space-themed party to pass off as a robot is somehow cooler than hanging out with some old bearded guy who forged his own suit of chain mail in his garage, then you are delusional and should get a career in marketing. That’s that job where they make people believe worse things are better than great things for no reason at all. Listen to the 
radio lately?
There are no radios in medieval times. It’s magnifi-
cent.

Imagine if the U.S. had a presi-
dent who was so effective at stifling opposing points of view, 
intimidating voters and rigging elections that he stayed in power for 30 years. Wouldn’t the American people would eventually rise up in 
mass opposition?
There’s no way the American 
people would allow that to hap-
pen, but this is the exact situation in Egypt. 
The Egyptian people, however, 
have finally risen up in protest.
If America is to consider itself a champion of freedom around the world, it’s the duty of every Ameri-can to back the Egyptian pro-de-mocracy demonstrations. Who is to 
say that we can enjoy the freedom to 
express disapproval of our govern-ment, while the Egyptians must be condemned to lives under an op-pressive ruler?
So far, the protesters have been 
successful.
 Last week Hosni Mubarak an-
nounced that he would not seek re-
election in the fall, but this doesn’t 
mean they’re out of the woods quite yet. After Muba-rak’s an-
nounce-
ment, the demonstrations turned 
violent, as pro-government dem-onstrators began attacking foreign 
journalists and anti-Mubarak pro-
testers. Clearly, Mubarak isn’t plan-ning on making a quick, easy exit.
Unfortunately , many in the U.S. 
have chosen to focus on the possibil-
ity of an Egyptian democracy per -
mitting Islamic extremists to come 
in to power. Egypt has a long his-tory with the Muslim Brotherhood, an Islamic political movement. 
Commentators like Bill O’Reilly 
and Glenn Beck have been claim-ing that if Mubarak leaves, they are likely to take power and threaten the U.S.
The Muslim Brotherhood isn’t 
likely to gain power. It certainly isn’t representative of the views of the majority of Egyptians. Even if they were to gain control of the govern-
ment, the Muslim Brotherhood is 
not al-Qaida. There are many differ -
ences of opinion held throughout the Brotherhood, with some being more supportive of the use of violence and others taking a more moderate position. In fact, the organization of-
ficially condemns all use of violence, 
having renounced it in the 1970s and taken a more moderate stance, at least in public statements.
We should instead concentrate 
on the thousands of protesters as-sembling throughout Egypt, de-manding the civil liberties we take for granted.
Arizona Daily Wildcat, U. Arizona 
via UWIREWhat is the city’s role in job creation?
In recent months, local news have reported 
on growing Gainesville businesses in the fields 
of Web services, software development and distance 
learning. Trendy Entertainment is designing cutting edge 
video games for mobile devices and brought attention to Gainesville at the international 2010 Consumer Electron-ics Show. Tutor Matching Service won the 2010 Cade Prize with its innovative approach to distance learning.
These companies and others like them are creating jobs 
and are part of Gainesville’s emerging business clusters. When a city gets a critical mass of companies in an area of expertise, growth of new business in that area can snowball. 
Online music service Grooveshark provides an example of 
how this is happening in Gainesville. The company created Grooveshark University with support from Santa Fe Col-lege’s Center for Innovation and Economic Development and the Chamber of Commerce’s Innovation Gainesville. 
Grooveshark University offers free instruction to entrepre-
neurs on creating applications for computers and smart phones. One successful company is helping to create an en-tire entrepreneurial ecosystem that moves ideas into jobs.Given that this growth comes 
from private enterprise, what is the city’s role in job creation?
First, the city must get zoning 
right. Gainesville uses zoning to protect our neighbor -
hoods – one of our most important responsibilities. If we want to create jobs, Gainesville must also make sure these rules are not an undue obstacle to business.
I worked with Shands HealthCare and other private 
property owners this past year to rewrite the zoning rules for the University Heights neighborhood so that Innova-tion Square could happen while keeping that neighbor -
hood a great place to live. 
I also spearheaded the creation of the Community De-
velopment Committee, a task force of community members well-versed in growth management. This group is working right now to develop recommendations for reform so we can allow businesses to add jobs here.
Second, the city must provide the infrastructure busi-
nesses need in order to create jobs. The city of Gainesville owns a world-class telecommunications utility, GRUCom. The city built this utility with fiber-optic cable from the ground up, a structure that makes GRUCom reliable, af-fordable and very fast. The new Innovation Square will have gigabit ethernet provided by GRUCom at a similar cost to much slower services offered by competing utili-
ties. 
I support growth in GRUCom because its services are 
absolutely essential to the software development, Web ser -
vices and distance learning companies that will create jobs 
in Gainesville.
Of all public resources, transportation has the great-
est impact on how a community grows. The city has not adequately maintained its roads, and I support increasing funding for road maintenance and improvements. Also, on 
many days, RTS carries more passengers than Archer Road 
can carry cars.
Transit ridership grew 82 percent in the last decade. In-
vesting in transit will relieve congestion and allow access to new jobs created in Gainesville.
I am excited by Gainesville’s bright future. Job creation 
does not just take the private sector. Each of our institu-tions, entrepreneurs and our city has a role to play.

UWireGuns would eliminate defense-free zone
I’m disappointed to hear about the 
Student Senate’s anti-gun resolution. I do 
hope they understand that their resolution 
will not stop people with bad intent from 
carrying guns, only those of us who follow the law and intend to use our weapons for self-defense. 
Anyone who thinks that every heated 
debate in intro biology is going to end in a John Woo-style shootout should watch a little less TV. There is significant research showing that areas that adopt concealed carry laws benefit from reduced crime or, at worst, no change. Criminals know that campuses are defense-free zones so long as 
they can avoid the campus police depart-
ment, and that makes them a target.
I hope some members of the Student 
Senate think this through a little better 
and understand that this bill will not turn 
UF into a Wild West full of gun fights and showdowns at the Reitz Union.

Community service, not politics, 
deserves coverage 
Once again, the Alligator has failed to 
understand its own shortcomings. Once 
again, the Alligator has openly flaunted 
its infatuation with Dave Schneider. Once 
again, the Alligator has neglected more im-portant facts in order to reinforce the poli-tics of SG that it so often sounds out against.  
In Tuesday’s issue, the cover story was about the Progress Party at St. Francis House. I cannot understand why this made 
news. There are people who spend every 
day serving the homeless and the larger Gainesville community. I’ll be happy for the day when this paper has a feature on 
Jacqueline Ros who is involved with a 
children advocacy program, or Erica Sokol who is starting a program seeking sup-port for prematurely born, or Nick Dunn who is so caught up in arranging for the underprivileged to have simple household furniture that he shows up to his outreach programs in his Starbucks uniform. Once 
again the Alligator will ignore everything 
inspiring in people in order to perpetuate political noise and a cult of personality.

Liberty allows reality TV to thrive
I think Laura Ellermeyer’s column Tues-
day is all wrong. First off, there is nothing atrocious about McDonald’s except how 
awesome they are—but then that’s not re-
ally the point of her column; the ethical re-sponsibilities of reality TV is the point. 
America is built on a simple concept 
that gets incredibly complicated as it scales up to a fully functioning society. It’s called “individual liberty.” 
In short, do you own your body or does the state? Your answer to that question has huge implications for where we go from there. If you believe, like I do, that you own your body, then whatever you do with it–so long as you don’t hurt an-
other or deprive them of their liberty–is 
entirely your call. That includes poisoning it with booze, cigarettes, drugs or renting it out for money for someone else’s sexual 
gratification. In those instances, there is no 
ethical obligation to do anything to stop the behavior–illegal or not. Distasteful? Certainly. Pitiful? No doubt about it. It is, however, these free people’s choice to do 
drugs or prostitute themselves or to live in 
their cars. 
There are outreach programs galore, 
both public and private, that these people 
could avail themselves of. It isn’t TV’s re-
sponsibility to do anything to these people they don’t want done. Were there actions in violation of those two principles–harming another or denying them their liberty–then 
any spectator would be ethically bound 
to act. Television does plenty of heartfelt things (think “Extreme Home Makeover” and “Oprah”) though the ratings are why 
they do it. 
Television is a business and as such it 
gives the market what it wants, and what 
it enjoys more than nearly anything else is watching people that have it so much 
worse than they do. Sex sells? Not nearly 
as well as Schadenfreude, it appears.

I have been reading up on Florida Sen-
ate Bill 234. I suggest all of the people who have been debating this recently do the 
same. 
I am an avid and licensed hunter in the 
state of Florida and part of that privilege 
is learning the law. Because I am pursuing 
a concealed carry license, I have done just 
that. 
The law states that you must have a 
concealed carry license to open carry. Any-one visibly carrying will most assuredly be checked by police. So the idea that any stu-dent can carry is a ludicrous idea.
You will be required to have a concealed 
permit, and you must be finger printed to have this license, so not everyone will be carrying these weapons. 
How many of the 50,000 are under 21, 
which is the legal age for concealed carry? 
I feel this debate has gotten out of hand 
simply because most do not understand the letter of the law. 
I suggest before your overly enthusi-
astic opinion sharing continues that you please understand terminology and the present laws as they exist. 
As I sit in my chair, I am checking Flor -
ida laws on concealed carry and what Bill 234 would allow. 
Please visit the Florida Senate website 
and other government websites to check the laws for yourself.

UF studentn ONE BILL PROPOSES A FINE OF $100 FOR 
TEXTING WHILE DRIVING.
By KAITLYN ROBBINS
Alligator Contributing Writer
At least three Florida representatives have filed for distract-
ed driving legislation to be considered in the 2011 legislative 
session. If passed, most of these new bills would impose a fine 
for drivers who are caught texting behind the wheel.  
The legislative session is set to start in March and will last 
for 60 days.
Thirty states in the U.S. have passed distracted driving leg-
islation that has banned texting while driving, according to the Governors Highway Safety Association.
Drivers who use hand-held devices while driving are four 
times as likely to get into a crash that could seriously injure them, according to a U.S. Department of Transportation web-site.
One proposed piece of legislation is Florida Senate Bill 80, 
which would fine drivers $100 for partaking in any text-based communication, including texting and e-mailing.
In 2010, there were 18 different bills under consideration 
that would limit cell phone use in the form of talking and tex-ting. The Legislature rejected all 18 of the bills.  
Kendal Orgera, an anthropology student, said she texts 
while she drives because she is “too impatient to wait for the car to be at a complete stop.” 
According to the transportation department, using a cell 
phone while driving delays a driver’s reaction time as much as having a blood alcohol concentration of .08 percent.
“I realize that it’s just like drunk driving,” Orgera said. “But 
I’m a naive college student and think that I can text while I 
drive and nothing will ever happen to me.”8, ALLIGATOR n WEDNESDAY, FEBRUARY 9, 2011

Rob Zeller didn’t just miss 
last week’s campaign forums. 
He missed three days of work and a piece of his son’s first birthday cake.
The sick feeling hit the can-
didate for the City Commis-sion’s 3rd District around 11 a.m. last Sunday, just as his son, Rex, was winding up his 
birthday.
The first city election forum 
was set to start at 4 p.m., but 
the candidate’s face was get-
ting greener by the minute. 
His thermometer was reading 101 degrees. He didn’t know what to do.
He phoned Ed Braddy, his 
campaign manager, for ad-vice.
“If that’s the case, then you 
need to rest up,” Braddy said.
Zeller spent the next 72 
hours inside fighting what turned out to be a case of pneumonia, missing the sec-ond candidate forum that 
Monday.
He and Braddy said miss-
ing the forums were the least of his worries.
“I just didn’t feel it was 
very considerate or very re-
sponsible to go,” Zeller said.
But now, he’s back.
With a cough, sore throat 
and runny nose, he made the 
Tuesday meeting of the Busi-ness Community Coalition.
Even after Zeller’s first two 
absences, Braddy said he’s 
not worried about the 
candidate’s 
standings.
“Missing 
a day or two 
of walking neighbor -
hoods and 
attending forums shouldn’t set him back,” Braddy said.
 Zeller is still leading the 
pack with $12,093.56 in con-tributions. He said he’s feeling “80 percent.”
He said he will be at the 
League of Women Voters 
Forum on Sunday and the 
Gainesville Tea Party Forum on Tuesday.
“I gotta work, and I gotta 
campaign, and I gotta do what I gotta do,” Zeller said.Zeller misses days

A 10-week international vegetarian cooking 
workshop will begin today. 
The classes will be taught by two Hare Krishna 
cooks at the Bhakti House, 1414 NW Second Ave. 
Participants will be charged a one-time fee of 
$108, which includes 10 hands-on classes, dinner 
and a copy of the cookbook.
The workshop will be taught by Andres Salim, 
a second-year nursing student, and Alysia Rad-der, a post-bachelor religion major. Both have been vegetarian for about four years and are self-taught cooks. 
“We are not going to lecture people,” Salim 
said. “Some will be cutting, some will be frying. But everyone will be doing something.”Participants will learn how to make delicacies 
from all over the world including India, Greece, It-aly and Japan. They will also learn Krishna Lunch recipes such as salad dressing and halava.
The class is open to anyone and will be accept-
ing participants until next Wednesday. To register, e-mail krishnagator@gmail.com with contact in-formation.Krishnas give cooking lessonsBy MEREDITH RUTLAND

City candidates spoke over the 
hiss of latte machines Tuesday as they discussed topics rang-ing from unemployment among young adults to political ethics.
The forum, held at Volta Cof-
fee, Tea and Chocolate, was spon-sored by the UF College Demo-crats, Santa Fe College Democrats and Alachua County Young Dem-ocrats.
District 2 candidates James 
Ingle and Lauren Poe attended, as did District 3 candidates Susan Bottcher and Ozzy Angulo. At-large candidate Thomas Hawk-ins, who was at the Duckpond Neighborhood Association fo-rum, joined the candidates about 40 minutes into the forum at the coffee shop.
Candidates were asked how 
they would address the problem 
of unem-p l o y m e n t for young people in 
Gainesville.
Ingle said that one solution is 
to use commission-funded proj-ects to hire Gainesville citizens.
“We need to make sure the 
money we spend goes to local businesses,” he said.
Poe said that current programs 
like the Innovation Hub at UF will help the situation by capturing the ideas of Gainesville students and residents.
Candidates were also asked 
whether they thought people should be banned from citizen comment if they curse at city commission meetings. The ques-tion referred to an incident Thurs-day when activist Pat Fitzpatrick called Gainesville commissioners “fascist a**holes.”
Poe said he supports a tempo-
rary ban if a citizen’s behavior gets out of hand. Ingle, Angulo and Bottcher said they don’t support a ban, but that it would be appro-priate to remove someone from a meeting if he or she curses.
“Unless they’re a clear threat 
to public safety, I don’t think any-body should be banned,” Bottcher said.

Whether it was a late turnover 
in a loss to Jacksonville, a refresh-
ing Christmas break or even a familiarity with conference foes, 
something flipped a switch for 
Chandler Parsons. 
The senior forward was aver -
aging only 9.3 points and 6.3 re-
bounds per game as the calendar turned to 2011, but he has taken a significant step forward in the new year. 
In two games last week, both 
victories, he combined for 35 
points, 23 rebounds and seven 
assists. 
His improvement was recog-
nized Monday with the announce-
ment that Parsons was named the Oscar Robertson National Player of the Week by the U.S. Basket-ball Writers Association. 
The senior’s continued strong 
play will be critical as No. 17 Florida (18-5, 7-2 Southeastern 
Conference) looks to avenge an 
early loss to South Carolina (13-8, 4-4 SEC) tonight at 8 in Colum-bia. 
“Chandler’s been playing 
great. That’s what we expect from him,” junior guard Erv-
ing Walker said. “He affects the 
game in so many ways for us — 
offense, scoring, rebounding, as-
sists. He just does it all at 6-10 for us, and he’s playing like a senior should.”
Earlier this season, Parsons 
said he sees himself as the most versatile player in college basket-ball, and there is far more to the 
senior’s game than his 11 points 
per contest.
Parsons has backed up that 
claim during conference play, 
as he ranks in the top five in as-sists (3.7) and rebounds (9.2) per game. 
Only one other player — Geor -
gia’s Travis Leslie — is even in the top 20 in both categories. 
That production and versatil-
ity are the reasons UF coach Billy 
Donovan kept Parsons in the 
lineup for all 20 minutes of Sat-urday’s second half against Ken-tucky — something the coach did not remember ever doing in his time at Florida. 
“I wanted to try to get him out 
of the game, but he was doing 
too many things,” Donovan said. 
“He really had a complete game 
all the way through.”
The 6-foot-10 Parsons pres-
ents a unique threat for oppos-
ing coaches, as he has the size and speed to get in the lane and score. 
He has also shown an ability 
to hit the three. After connecting 
on just 31.3 percent of his long-
range attempts in nonconference 
play, the senior has found his 
stroke and currently ranks sec-
ond in SEC games with a 46.9 
three-point shooting percentage. 
He has even shown the abil-
ity to handle the ball and run the offense, establishing a 2.4-to-1 assist-to-turnover ratio in confer -
ence play. 
“Without question, we feel 
like him being a playmaker and a play starter for us, and a play finisher, is important,” Donovan said. 
Parsons complements his vari-
ous talents with relentless effort, crashing the glass on nearly ev-ery offensive rebounding oppor -
tunity. 
On three separate occasions 
Saturday, Parsons read the trajec-tory of a missed shot and came flying in from the wing to get the follow-up score. 
“I think the biggest thing is he 
provides effort when he goes to 
the backboard,” Donovan said. 
“I’ve never had a problem with Chandler’s effort.”
ONLINE SEC EAST STANDINGS TEEING OFF WITH ANTHONY CHIANG
n The Los Angeles Lakers and Denver Nuggets began preliminary talks about 
a trade involving Carmelo Anthony. Can you believe these guys? That would 
never work out. Three superstars on one team? There aren’t enough balls to go around. What a joke, right? ... In other news, the Cleveland Cavaliers were off Tuesday night. They still lost.n For the full version of the tennis story on

Parsons coming into his own during SEC play
The key to Preston Tucker’s move to 
right field has little to do with Preston Tucker.
Don’t get me wrong: The transition 
doesn’t work if he can’t play his new posi-tion. And after starting just seven games in the outfield last year, there is reason to doubt the move will go smoothly.
But even if the preseason All-American 
plays as well in right as he did at first base, the switch won’t necessarily be a success. The Gators need someone to fill Tucker’s void at first, and that’s the point of this shuffle.Coach Kevin O’Sullivan is moving Tuck-
er to a tougher position to squeeze more production out of his lineup. Florida led the Southeastern Conference in fielding per -
centage last season but finished eighth in the conference with a .297 team batting av-erage.
Ideally, Tucker’s infield replacement will 
be his roommate, junior Ben McMahan.
“Dude, I moved out to the outfield so you 
could get some time at first,” McMahan said Tucker told him.
McMahan, who was recruited to Gainesville as a catch-er, fell behind sopho-more Mike Zunino on the depth chart in 2010 because his de-fense was not good enough. But McMa -
han flashed one of Florida’s best swings in limited action last season, hitting .325 
in 80 plate appearances — good enough for fifth on the team.He is also coming off a productive sum-
mer in the wood-bat Cape Cod League, where his .323 average was behind only Hawaii’s Kolten Wong, Arizona State’s John Ruettiger and Memphis’ Drew Martinez.  
Wong and Ruettiger are both preseason 
All-Americans. Martinez returns to Mem-phis this year after getting drafted by the Mets last summer.
“We’re just trying to be creative and try 
to move some guys around and try to find a way to get [McMahan’s] bat in the lineup 
With void at first, McMahan preparing to seize opportunity“Chandler’s been playing 
great. That’s what we ex-
pect from him. He affects 
the game in so many ways 
for us — offense, scoring, 
rebounding, assists. He 
just does it all at 6-10 for 
us, and he’s playing like a 
senior should.”

 When freshman guard Brit-
tany Shine comes off the floor during a game, she 
removes her mouthpiece and sticks it in her sock.
They must be Nike socks, al-
ways two pairs, and the “swoosh-es” have to line up.
Shine has reason for the pe-
culiar placement of her protec-tion device — that is, other than shielding her recent dental work.
She wants to communicate.As soon as the buzzer sounds 
and the sub comes in for her, it’s not uncommon to see Shine hustle to a spot on the sideline right next to Amanda Butler and drape an arm across her coach’s shoulders. 
That desire Shine carries — her 
pursuit of greatness — is evident to those around her.
“She just wants it,” Butler said. 
“She wants to be coached. ... She wants to get it right. She wants to be great.”
Part of that is getting imme-
diate feedback from her coaches and teammates on the sideline. 
Butler and Michele Massari, 
Shine’s coach in high school, said her craving for improvement, and 
her receptiveness to criticism, is 
unmatched by her peers and her predecessors.
“Her spirit is never diminished 
by how hard I challenge her — quite the opposite,” Butler said. “It almost motivates her more to get it right and come out with more passion and more energy.”
On Sunday against Vanderbilt, 
Shine entered the game late with the Gators trailing by seven. Less than a minute later, she drilled a three right in front of the Florida bench to pull the game within two.  
A foul on the other end of the 
floor sent Tiffany Clarke to the 
free-throw line, where Shine’s 
normally joyful, exuberant ex-pression turned noticeably seri-ous. She clapped her hands and, struggling to get the words out behind her cumbersome, bright orange mouthpiece, she implored her teammates, “Let’s go.”
Shine scored seven of her 
team’s next nine points, accu-mulating 10 of her 19 during the scant three-minute span, propel-ling the Gators from an 11-point halftime deficit into a tie game and overtime. 
“I just try to do whatever I can 
do to help us win,” Shine said.
But to the onlookers taking 
it all in, her play is something more.
“She gets that fire in her eyes,” 
Massari said after watching Sun-day’s game on television. “She gets that look in her eye, and it’s over.”
“That look” is something bas-ketball’s greats are known for.
A difficult shot falls or a tough 
foul is called — something trig-gers an evident glare in their eyes. A ridiculous scoring frenzy ensues. The opposition can see and feel the game slipping away. 
Shine possesses the look and 
has shown she, too, is capable 
of single-handedly affecting a 
game’s outcome. 
“I just want to win so bad, I’ll 
do anything it takes to not lose the game,” she said. 
Massari saw it first hand while 
coaching Shine at Sacramento (Calif.) High. 
Shine dropped 28 points in the 
2010 Northern California Divi-sion III playoffs with a trip to the championship game on the line.
She had the same look in 
her eye then as she had Sunday against Vanderbilt, Massari said. 
The seemingly simple expres-
sion that signaled the start of her run is indicative of something 
deeper. 
By 6 a.m., even on school days, 
Shine was in the gym getting 
shots in before class — just the first of four workouts. 
After school, there was prac-
tice. Then, Shine would stick around and shoot some more.  She also put in time with a strength coach. 
“Unless you’re in the gym 
working as hard as she worked, you’re not working enough,” Massari said.
It’s easy to see why her coaches 
say they have never encountered someone like Shine.
It’s also easy to see how she 
was able to stack up accolade af-ter accolade.
The Sacramento Bee named 
Shine the 2010 Player of the Year, and she also snagged the 2010 Metro League Player of the Year award. 
Shine was also chosen to the 
All-NorCal First Team and the 2010 Cal-Hi Sports All-State team for her division, and was a four-
time First Team All-Metro selec-
tion. 
“I know when I’m not work-
ing, somebody else is. So, when somebody else is asleep, I’ve got to be in the gym working,” Shine said. “I’m trying to reach my goals. I’ve got to make it happen. It’s not going to just happen by 
itself.”
Her commitment to greatness 
has carried over in her limited 
time at Florida.
She was named Southeast-
ern Conference Freshman of the Week after stepping in for injured captain Jordan Jones, lighting up the scoreboard with 47 combined 
points in consecutive games dur -
ing the Gator Holiday Classic on Dec. 20-21. 
Despite averaging just 14.4 
minutes per game, Shine has 
eclipsed 15 points four different times this season. Only Jones, a spot-up shooter averaging a team-
high 33 minutes per contest, has 
done so more often, with five.
The time she puts in off the 
court finally translated into time spent on it, and Shine racked up a team-high 12 points against the Rebels, most coming in another game-changing spurt.
While the transition from prep 
star to role player off the bench can be difficult, Shine doesn’t get discouraged with the lack of playing time. 
“When most kids would pout, 
she’ll just get in the gym and shoot,” Massari said.
It’s that type of mentality that 
personifies Shine.
Butler said her “infectious” 
personality off the court is what makes her so special.
And it began with family.Growing up, Shine was 
coached by her mother, Sheila, also a former selection to the Sac-ramento All-Metro team. 
They still talk three to four 
times each day, and Mom has even made the cross-country trek to watch her daughter play five 
times. 
“Not only is she my mom, but 
she’s my best friend,” Shine said.
Her grandparents live three 
miles away from her home in Sac-
ramento. And she plays drums during service at her church — self-taught, by the way. 
“In any part of Shine’s envi-
ronment you go to … everybody loves her,” Butler said. “She doesn’t just turn it on when it’s time to be this or time to be that, it’s just who she is all the time.”
This past summer while play-
ing for Just Believe Sports, a Cali-fornia club team stacked with tal-ent, Shine sprained her foot and was sidelined for much of the schedule. 
For JBS’s last game, every 
player suited up with a No. 23 scrawled on their shoulder in honor of Shine — much like she wears No. 23 to pay homage to one of the game’s best.
From her earrings to her shoes, 
Shine is all Jordan. 
She has at least 30 pairs of 
Jordan shoes in Florida alone, 
and double that at her home in 
California. Shine even tried to get 
Butler to give up her Jumpman 
sweats in practice recently. 
And when Shine has trouble 
falling asleep at night, what does she watch? Jordan highlights. 
While on-court comparisons 
between the two are unrealistic, the game’s greatest has been a source of inspiration for Shine — 
and it shows.  From the number 
on her back to the work she puts in off the court, all the way down to that infamous look.
It’s only a matter of time before 
Shine is able to reap the rewards of her hard work and get back to the winning ways to which she is accustomed.
And it won’t be a surprise to 
those who know her when it hap-pens. 
“Just tell Michael Jordan, I 
want to be the first college basket-ball girl on Team Jordan,” Shine said. “Tell him put me on. Tell Mi-chael Jordan that.”

 THE SOPHOMORE SLUGGER WILL START THE 
SEASON PLAYING IN RIGHT FIELD.
By STEPHEN SHEEHAN
Alligator Writer 
 
To simply say sophomore Brittany Schutte is versatile 
would be an understatement. 
The California native played first base, both corner outfield 
positions, designated hitter and even catcher last season, her 
first with the Gators. 
Despite not having a defined spot in the field, Schutte re-
wrote the UF freshman record book, recording the highest batting average (.346), home run total (19), RBI total (59) and slugging percentage (.780) in team history. 
After being named to the Women’s College World Series 
All-Tournament Team and the Southeastern Conference All-Freshman Team in 2010, Schutte enters this season as one of the team’s best hitters, even in a lineup with accomplished hit-ters like Aja Paculba, Kelsey Bruder and Megan Bush. 
With the graduation of left fielder Francesca Enea, some 
had assumed Schutte would roam left field this season, but coach Tim Walton said Monday she will start in right field as senior Kelsey Bruder takes over in left.  
Just like last season, Schutte will be counted on to fill in all 
around the field. 
“She’ll play right, first, she’ll catch, she’s our backup third 
baseman, backup second baseman, backup left fielder,” Wal-ton said. “Having a great athlete like her, she’ll be in the mid-dle of that lineup for sure every day.” 
While some players enjoy the consistency of playing the 
same position regularly, Schutte has no issues with being counted on to play anywhere on any given day.  
“I actually take pride in being able to be versatile,” she said. 
“If I’m needed anywhere, then I know that I can play and ful-fill that position that coach Walton needs me at.”
Even after a historic freshman season, Schutte is still look-
ing to improve her game.
“She’s really done a good job working 
and developing her swing and her mindset,”  Walton said. “She wanted to have a better run-productive season, drive in more runs with runners on base.
“She saw that as not really a weakness last 
year, but something she really needed to do a better job of — hitting in the clutch, hitting 
with game-changing situations, not just hit-
ting home runs, but driving in runs in those situations, too.”
The Gators’ young star has more confidence heading into 
the 2011 season with a year under her belt. However, she still 
has room for growth and will only improve with more experi-ence. 
“I’m just more focused on playing the game, not really re-
cords or breaking any more records or anything like that,” she said. “I feel a little bit more experienced and know what more 
to expect now that I’ve had a year, but I still kind of feel new 
on the field and still have some nerves.”Florida to utilize Schutte’s flexibility

STAFF REPORT
 
The No. 2 Florida women’s tennis team 
fought its way to a 5-2 victory over No. 25 
South Florida on Tuesday in Linder Stadium 
at Ring Tennis Complex.
It was the first time the Gators (5-0) have 
been challenged all season, as the team’s first four wins were all shutouts.
UF captured the doubles point eas-
ily, sweeping all three courts in less than an hour.
However, the fast start did not carry over 
to the singles matches, as two Florida fresh-
men were handed their first dual-match losses.
The other four singles 
courts saw each Gator win 
in straight sets, including an 
impressive 6-0, 6-3 victory 
by Lauren Embree over No. 
24 Irene Rehberger. 
On Court 2, Sofie Oyen suffered her first 
setback at the hands of Ecaterina Vasenina 
in straight sets, 6-2, 7-6 (7-2). Florida’s Olivia 
Janowicz lost to USF’s Janette Bejlkova, 7-5, 4-6, 1-0 (12-10).
“While players don’t like to lose, our two 
freshmen who lost today learned a lot,” UF 
coach Roland Thornqvist said. 
“This South Florida team thought they 
could beat us, and it was really good to have 
that kind of competition heading into this weekend’s matches.”UF tops USF

consistently,” O’Sullivan said. “He has 
swung the bat good, so we’re going to try to get him in as best as we can, as much as we can.”
O’Sullivan has plenty of other can-
didates to take Tucker’s old corner, 
including sophomores Austin Maddox 
and Brian Johnson. But the Gators need McMahan to step up.
If McMahan sticks at first, Maddox 
will return to third base, where he start-ed 29 games last season. More impor -
tantly, O’Sullivan can use Johnson as UF’s designated hitter.
After posting a 1.089 OPS in 84 at-
bats last year, Johnson should be in the lineup every day. He will probably start 
the season in the team’s weekend rota-
tion, though, so O’Sullivan can’t put him in the field and risk an injury to his 
ace.
Essentially, McMahan would be re-
placing one of Florida’s corner outfield-
ers, Daniel Pigott or Tyler Thompson. That duo combined to hit .285 in 295 at-bats last season.
Of course, O’Sullivan will not an-
nounce any starters until next week, when Florida opens its season against 
South Florida on Feb. 18. 
He called first base “a work in prog-
ress,” adding fans will probably see 
Tucker at his old position a lot. But Tucker said two weeks ago that he 
hasn’t played an inning of first base 
since last season. 
And O’Sullivan should keep it that 
way. Because, dude, Tucker moved out there so McMahan can play.TYLER , from page 1316, ALLIGATOR n WEDNESDAY, FEBRUARY 9, 2011
