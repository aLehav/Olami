County jail to become more 
energy efficient
The slammer’s going green.
Alachua County commis-
sioners allotted $150,000 of the county’s reserve fund Tuesday to finance the county jail’s effort 
to be more energy efficient. This According to Morris, renova-
tions will probably begin “later 
this year or the beginning of next year.”
County leaders believe the 
project will, in the long run, save the county more money. Alachua 
County Facilities Manager Char -
lie Jackson said making the jail 
more environmentally friendly will save the jail $500,000 to $600,000 a year in utility costs.
— BRIANNA DONETamount is part of more than $8 million covering the adminis-trative costs of several of the jail’s already-approved modi-fication projects.
“These renovations are long 
overdue,” jail spokesman Eu-gene Morris said. “I am very happy the commission decid-ed the time was right to start working on these projects.”
Renovation projects will in-
clude raising a new foam roof, installing solar panels, replac-
ing faulty windows and car -
rying out general kitchen and 
laundry room renovations. The budget will also cover the sala-ries of employees of the facili-ties division to help with the project, lifting the burden of having to work with outside contractors.SUNNY

Officials from UF, Orlando Health and 
Shands HealthCare announced today that 
they plan to collaborate on new health initia-tives that will increase accessibility to care for patients over a 20-county region and expand 
training opportunities for physicians.
The agreement allows the three entities to 
negotiate forming joint clinical programs in 
several medical fields including pediatrics, oncology, women’s health and cardiovascular medicine.The partnership will also increase under -
graduate and graduate medical residency op-
portunities at Orlando Health, as well as create 
more opportunities to conduct clinical trials through UF’s clinical research program.
In a statement, UF Senior Vice President for 
Health Affairs David Guzick said the collabo-ration will serve to ad-dress continuing health 
care needs in North and Central Florida and 
bolster the university’s role in educating future 
health care providers. 
According to a press release, more than 2.5 
million Florida residents are now served by Shands, UF and Orlando Health.Shands to expand training

International students can 
share a cup of coffee and get to 
know American students dur -
ing Global Coffee House.
The event, part of Gator 
Nights, takes place on Fridays at 6:30 p.m. on the first floor of the Reitz Union, next to the Career Resource Center. 
The event is a revival of a 
program established as a place for international students to interact with American stu-dents. 
In the past, different cultural 
groups would perform, but the new Global Coffee House will not have any performances.  
When the event began, about 60 to 100 students attended every week. 
When budgets were cut, 
however, the event was dis-
continued by the International 
Center only to be carried on by Gator Nights.
The focus shifted away 
from mingling, and when that happened, it wasn’t as suc-cessful in encouraging the interaction international stu-dents were looking for, said Debra Anderson, coordinator 
of the International Center for 
Student Services.
Much of the problem had 
to do with Orange & Brew’s set-up not being conducive to group interaction, and the per -
formances didn’t help.
“Students would come 
in groups and sit at tables of four,” Anderson said. “It’s hard for an international stu-dent to join them when they are conscious of their English skills.”
By moving the event back 
to the Reitz, it may be easier for students to interact, which is the ultimate goal.
“What our students want 
is to interact with U.S. kids, ” Anderson said. Coffee house makes comeback

ALACHUA HARVEST FESTIVAL’S EIGHTH YEAR. 
By JERRY BRUNO
Alligator Contributing Writer 
After a weekend packed with 
Homecoming celebrations, Gators 
can wind down with a seasonal festival in downtown Alachua.
The eighth annual Alachua 
Harvest Festival is planned to take place from 11 a.m. to 5 p.m. on Sunday.
The 170 vendors and scare-
crow-decorated street lights will 
stretch all the way down Main 
Street. 
Scarecrow Row, the portion of 
the festival where people can dec-
orate the light poles with differ -
ent scarecrows, is a competition 
among Alachua businesses. 
This year’s festival theme 
is “Alachua’s Wide World of Sports.” 
The sponsors of this year’s fes-
tival include the Alachua Business League, SunState Federal Credit 
Union, Gator Domino’s, Alachua 
Design Printing and the City of Alachua. 
The Alachua Business League 
uses the proceeds from the fes-
tival to fund scholarships for lo-
cal high school students to go to Santa Fe College, said Joan Sroka, chairwoman of the festival. 
“Alachua Business League be-
lieves in reinvesting in the com-munity, and purchasing scholar -
ships is one of the many ways we support the community,” Sroka 
said.
Festival-goers can spend an Oc-
tober afternoon socializing with 
other visitors and perusing tables 
stacked with handmade items. 
Christmas shopping is also 
possible at the festival, said Val-
erie Taylor, a member of the festi-val’s logistics team. 
“I always look forward to see-
ing the pretty scarecrows and vendors on Main Street,” Taylor said.Alachua

Today’s question: What is your favorite part of the Homecoming festivities?
125 TOTAL VOTES54% YES46% NOThursday’s question: Do you think UF has become mediocre?If you’re energized and dedicated enough to get out of 
bed on your day off and realize UF recognizes the day before Homecoming as a holiday but not the day before Thanksgiv-ing, good for you! 
Who needs an extra day with his or her family (family, 
schmamily!) before the quintessential family holiday anyway when you’re busy thanking UF for the annual Homecoming parade on your day off? 
Not us! That’s why we’re spending our day off from 
school at the annual Homecoming parade, handing out our precious and beloved once-a-year Homecoming edition, which comes complete with your very own edition of We’re-Just-Glad-We-Won’t-Have-To-Hear-“Git-‘r’-done!”-At-This-Year’s-Gator-Growl-My-God-We-Were-Embarrassed….
Darts & Laurels
But there are a few things we are happy about. In fact, 
there are 33 things. You might even say we’re inspired. 
After almost 70 days trapped in a collapsed mine more 
than a half-mile underground, Chilean workers freed all 33 
miners during a tense and internationally inspirational re-turn to freedom. 
We’re glad to see Chile did not have to experience the sad-
ness our own country fell prey to when an explosion killed about 30 coal miners in West Virginia in April. 
In an internationally compelling, can’t-pull-our-eyes-
away-from-the-TV moment when the 33rd miner was raised to Earth’s surface in a tiny, claustrophobia-inducing cap-
sule, we couldn’t help but tear up a little for Chileans every-
where.
And for giving the rest of the world hope in future catas-
trophes like this, we’re throwing Chile a We-Couldn’t-Have-
Fashioned-A-Rope-From-Our-Bedroom-Window-Down-To-The-Ground-Kind-Of-Trick LAUREL . 
And then again, our inspiration is knocked down and 
spat upon by a couple of money-hungry, works-for-the-man, money-speaks-louder-than-words government officials who 
would rather open the Gulf of Mexico to oil drilling again 
than actively pursue offshore wind farming and renewable energy sources. 
We were seriously scarred from that picture of the bird 
trying to remove itself from the oil’s quicksand sludge. Seri-ously. Scarred. 
So, for holding oil companies, who have a larger check-
book than our oceans and who can speak louder than our fu-ture environmental health, we’re dumping barrel after barrel 
of oily DARTS on the White House for lifting the oil-drilling 
moratorium in the Gulf of Mexico.
We hope you get your own version of “The Birds” coming 
to peck you annoyingly. 
But there’s one sassy lady who doesn’t let those with 
bigger pocketbooks and lower levels of acceptance run her 
game. 
Judge Virginia Phillips stuck it to those who want to 
enforce bigotry and inequality again when she ordered an 
injunction this week to immediately stop the Pentagon’s 
enforcement of the “Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell” policy that dis-charges openly gay members from serving our country in wars even they don’t agree with. 
You go, girl! For recognizing bigotry has no place in 
government or anywhere else, we’re lovingly placing a We-Want-A-Big-Coming-Out-Party-In-Kandahar-Afghanistan-Now LAUREL  on Judge Phillips .
Enjoy the day off, Gators. You won’t be so lucky before 
Thanksgiving.
The Rewards and Responsibilities of 21
Have you ever woken up after a night of drink -
ing with mysterious scratches everywhere? No? 
Yeah, me either….
However, I have woken up with a massive hangover 
and an even bigger bar tab. 
Turning 21 left my life upside down, my freezer full 
of bottles and my brain full of homemade hangover 
remedies. Banana and pickle sandwiches? Yep. Gato-
rade with a splash of Alka-Seltzer? You bet. More alco-hol? Definitely.
The remedies are great, don’t get me wrong. I mean, 
who doesn’t like hearing that the best way to get over a 
hangover is by consuming more alcohol? 
Yet, the best part of turning 21 has been the support 
from friends.
The biggest perks of being the last one of your 
friends to turn the coveted age was knowing they had 
your back. 
Not only did they provide me with endless alcohol, 
but they also advised me on how to live my life as a 21-year-old college kid.
I was told to never drink by myself; it’s allegedly a 
sign of alcoholism. So I was advised to drink socially or with a friend, and if one isn’t available, my dog suppos-edly counts. 
As silly as drinking with a dog sounds, I’ve tried it, 
and it’s not that bad if you drink enough.
Probably the best advice I was given was to take it 
easy while pre-gaming. At first I didn’t believe it. When you’re underage, pre-gaming is what makes a night out 
worth it.
So you drink enough to last you through the night. 
Worst. Idea. Ever. Pre-gaming as a 21-year-old 
can be a disaster. We’re already 
too old for that. Nothing good 
can come from it anymore be-
sides sleeping in a random ga-rages. So I’ve obviously stopped pre-gaming.
Crossing the age boundary 
along the yellow brick road 
from underage prohibition to legal neuron annihilation is wonderful. The perks abound: cheaper cover at clubs, the ability to participate in free beer events and the end 
of that God-awful feeling every time a party gets bro-
ken up and you find yourself setting your beer down. Then again, you always have to make sure you have a ride home, and you will always be expected to provide 
alcohol for those who have yet to find their way to the 
wonderful wizard.
I mean, don’t get me wrong, alcohol is magical. It’s 
like fairy dust, liquid courage and luck all had a baby. But like Ben Parker once said, “With great power comes 
great responsibility.”
I guess what I am getting at is turning that subjective 
age of 21 has given me the ability to enjoy myself more.
But it’s also allowed the opportunity to become 
more responsible. I’ve kept my drunk texting to a mini-
mum, I’ve made sure to never drink and drive, and I’ve stopped blacking out ever since that night I allegedly woke up in someone’s garage.
And that’s always a welcome sentiment.

A unique schism has developed in the world of the post-
modern relationship, a schism that has brought a veri-table role reversal to the previously established and 
socially-accepted positions of the genders.
Seen most often outside of the high school and college rela-
tionship, women previously were expected to be in the more subjugated position of the happy homemaker while it was so-cially acceptable for men to be out all night and without too much guilt being put on them when they decided to return home. 
Even when the second wave of feminism gained ground in 
America during the late ‘60s and early ‘70s, the standard famil-ial model of father, mother, two and a half kids, and a white picket fence was still a popular formula for a happy and healthy 
existence within the accepted social and economic norms. 
However, within the last five to 10 years, a new trend has 
taken hold of college campuses, the workplace and even the 
home: Women are refusing this socially accepted model of liv-ing in favor of the more thrilling life that had previously been enjoyed primarily by guys from fraternities or the more lewd population of the male businessman — a standard of living one could affectionately call “sexual ADD.” 
In the charming vernacular of the homosexual community , 
women could have previously been referred to as “bottoms.” However, ever since women have slowly begun to realize that they do indeed have the choice to do whatever the they want, their own disenfranchisement with the established order has grown until Polly Proletariat cast off her pearls and traded in her apron for a pantsuit. 
This leaves the men of this current generation in a rather peculiar predicament. Men today have grown up with the role of their fathers and their father’s fathers, and the ex-amples of their mothers in the role of the 
happy homemaker. And while this worked for most of the ba-
by-boomer generation, those who identify primarily with Gen-
eration X and the iGeneration come from a steadily increasing divorce rate, leaving many to be raised by single parents, most of whom are women.
The increased divorce rate has created the aforementioned 
schism and has given birth to a unique role reversal and social dichotomy that is steadily gaining prevalence. 
Men, who grew up under their mothers’ tutelage, have gen-
erally become more sensitive and unconsciously dependent on 
women to help care for them. In psychological jargon, in the 
absence of a father figure, many have fallen victim to an unre-solved Oedipal complex. Those whose fathers left their moth-ers for another woman or stepped outside their marital bounds often make the fatal mistake of believing that women are their playthings, their mindless puppets with whom they can do whatever they want. 
Even the “nice guys” who would never dare to say such 
a thing out loud secretly and unconsciously believe that they 
will one day meet their idealized fantasy woman who will be 
a mixture of the actresses that they see on silver screen and the “actresses” that they see on their computer screen. Either way , and despite many of them being raised by women, men still grow up believing that they are in control of this world and that a woman’s place is either (A) at his side (B) on her back or 
(C) on her knees. However, women have grown up with a different perspec-
tive on the higher divorce rate. While a man may see his father 
leave and unconsciously draw closer to his mother while still romanticizing the ideal of his absent father, women grow up more determined to be different from their mothers, to not fall victim to her same mistakes while simultaneously resenting their fathers for leaving them. This fosters within these wom-en the flip-side of the Oedipal complex, the Electra complex, 
which leads to the rather odd social structure that is becoming 
more and more prevalent on college campuses today . 
Women, like men, are becoming victims to the idealized 
lifestyle of “sexual ADD,” meaning that the level of promiscu-ity without any need or desire for a relationship or even one steady partner is rising. No longer do women go to college to get their Mrs. degree; they go to get an actual degree while sat-isfying their carnal desires in the process. 
And while this is great for women, this leaves men at col-
lege in a unique predicament. 
Most relationships are cultivated in college, but this is no 
longer happening. Women are no longer interested in having a relationship, because marriage is slowly becoming a sham and they don’t need men any longer to support them or help them enter the upper echelons of power. So these men who grew up being cared for by their mothers and who are still unconsciously 
looking for a woman who will fill that role of caretaker in their 
lives are being phased out, ignored and used by the women who are only looking for something fun and casual while they concentrate on getting what they want out of life.

Speaking OutThere is nothing in this life — no task 
too tall, no challenge too great — that cannot be conquered or managed with-
out the help of HBO’s sports series “Hard Knocks.”
Whether it’s 300-pound linemen dis-
playing the benefits of the physically taxing “Shake Weight” or Antonio Cromartie mak-ing a case for Father of the Year,  there are  les-sons that one can take away from the hour-long brodeo and apply to everyday life.
For today’s lesson, boys and girls, we turn 
to our favorite turkey-necked tough guy: Rex Ryan. 
In one episode, his players are seen prac-
ticing like a bunch of autistic pregnant wom-en. In the team meeting later that night, Rex goes Shakespearean.
“Let’s make sure we play like the (exple-
tive) New York Jets and not some (expletive) slapdick team.” 
There’s been a lot of talk recently about 
how our university is turning into a colle-giate train wreck: You would think after hear -
ing some of our fans that the Four Horsemen were moments away from riding down Uni-versity Avenue to drink the blood of the in-nocent and the diseased. 
That, my friends, is being a “slapdick” 
Gator.
“Oh sweet Jesus, we lost some football 
games and our name isn’t higher on a few lists; everyone to the fallout shelter!”  Please don’t tell me we’ve become that girl at the bar who kills the whiskey buzz by talking about how she’s been hurt too many times and all the other gooey Hallmark card material. If you’re one of those kids who clings to those rankings, just do the world a favor and choke down car exhaust. They mean as much as sta-
tistics in the WNBA. 
The University of Miami has us beat us in 
academics. So what? They’re paying five fig-
ures a semester to go to a Jersey Shore prison yard.  I’m just happy to see that the work-release program gets results.  We’re not No. 1 in 
partying.  I have yet to discover the difference between No. 1 drunk and No. 7 drunk. The beer tastes just as good, the Kenny Powers quotes are still as fun-
ny and the fat girls are 
still as annoying and 
hopeless.  
Do I care about winning? You’re damn 
right I do. I’m not afraid to use nut-taps to get shotgun in the car, break up double-plays in intramural softball and use whatever nipple cleavage or suggestive pelvic thrust I can to distract an opponent in beer pong overtime. 
It’s never OK to admit to mediocrity.  I don’t 
care what the rankings say; I’m still not go-ing to acknowledge dominance from some women’s college, no matter what these social-ist numbers say. I’m also still going to chant “USA!” at the most inappropriate places as well as Ric Flair strut down Midtown because my blood alcohol content is enough to kill a schoolyard of children. Whoooo!
Speaking of pro wrestling, I know Sgt. 
Slaughter’s offensive playcalling for our 
football team can be trumped by a 5-year-old 
Asian who plays Madden. I yell out soul-rotting things, too, when our center executes the Pouncey Bouncey. But for the love of God, just because you know the option is coming (as do the other 90,000 people in the stands) does not make you the second coming of Brian Belichick. We win, we rage. We lose, we rage. Our team is not that bad — imagine 
having to wake up knowing you have season 
tickets to Duke football. Whenever you can’t stomach another the third-and-6 draw plays to Jeff Demps, just close your eyes and qui-etly tell yourself, “It’s still not Dan Werner. It’s still not Dan Werner.”

Students let go of labels and 
discrimination as they danced 
the night away Thursday.
The LGBTQ Homecoming 
Dance took place in the Reitz Union and offered members of the LGBTQ community a second chance at a school dance.
About 50 guests gathered at 
purple- and white-covered tables and moved to everything from Beyonce to Madonna. 
Attendees were encouraged to 
wear anything they felt comfort-able in, from formal dresses to T-shirts and Converse sneakers.
“I just want people in the 
LGBTQ community to know that they are not alone and that there are activities like this for them,”said Ricky Carter, Student Government LGBTQ student af-
fairs cabinet director. “This is 
a second chance for them to be comfortable at an event that they may not have enjoyed in high 
school.”
Carter, a sophomore the-
ater major, grew up Catholic. 
Although he came out in high school, he did not feel comfort-
able bringing a gay date to prom. He was a member of the home-coming court and danced with 
girls from his school, but he planned this event so that people could attend a formal dance in any way they felt comfortable.
Christina Montana, a fresh-
man English major, appreciated the opportunity to make her own choices at this homecoming dance.
“I wore a dress to my prom 
for my mom, and I had fun, but 
I wasn’t really comfortable,” she 
said.Montana came out to her 
friends and some of her family as a freshman in high school, but waited until midway through her senior year to tell her mother.
At her senior prom, she felt 
like her high school was an ex-ception to the judgmental rule. She remembers a girl coming in 
pants and a dress shirt and that 
students were generally accept-ing of her.
Montana, in her gray slacks, 
black vest and Converse sneak-
ers, said she was much more 
comfortable at the dance than she had been at her prom.
“I love that events like these 
include everyone,” she said. “You don’t need to be LGBTQ to come, as long as you’re accepting.”
Carter hopes to double the 
number of attendees next year. 
The event, co-sponsored by SG 
and the Pride Student Union, cost less than $800. That money went toward room rental and refresh-
ments, including a cake. 
Carter said he enjoys his posi-
tion as cabinet director because

� THE PROPERTY IS ON WEST 
UNIVERSITY AVENUE.

For nearly three years, the unfinished 
Stadium Club luxury condo and retail proj-
ect has cast its shadow on University Av-enue, directly across from Ben Hill Griffin Stadium.  But now, the building’s future is 
in the hands of a new owner. 
The property was sold in a foreclosure 
auction in the lobby of the Alachua County 
civil courthouse on Wednesday morning. The case was brought to court along with four other commercial properties.
The building was sold to Ralph Larry 
Roberts Sr. of RLR Investments LLC for $1.5 million —  about half of what of the previous owner, Stock Development, paid for the property in 2007. 
According to the company’s website, 
RLR Investments is an investment compa-
ny that sells and leases properties for com-
mercial and residential use. Roberts also owns the Ohio-based company R&L Carri-ers Inc., a trucking company that has more than 100 facilities in 29 states.
Looking at the Robertses’ past business 
ventures, Stadium Club may finally have a chance for success. 
The company was in charge of the de-
velopment of the exclusive Golden Ocala Golf and Equestrian Club, which has a 77,000-square-foot clubhouse and more than 1,200 acres of land. It also includes special amenities such as a spa and fitness 
center, an 18-hole golf course with a 10-acre short game 
area, two practice holes and 
driving range, and a state-of-
the-art equestrian facility for horses.
Representatives from RLR Investments 
declined to comment on the sale.
The plaintiff of the Stadium Club case, 
Vesta Equity LLC, started the initial bid for the property at $100,000. Ron DeFilippio, owner of The Swamp and other businesses in the Gainesville area, also showed interest in buying the property. His highest bid was $975,000, but he admitted that he wasn’t sure what he would have done with it. 
Vesta Equity LLC, a Sarasota-based 
lending company, bought the remaining loan for the property in February 2009 and 
proceeded with foreclosure procedures the 
following month. 
According to a foreclosure judgment 
made in September, Vesta is owed more than $2.6 million. Several other contractors, including Irvine Contracting, filed millions of dollars worth of liens on the project.

In the midst of a sluggish econ-
omy, while already being hit with 
tuition and housing increases, some students are also having to pay more for school-sponsored 
health insurance. 
This fall, UF’s student health 
insurance switched from Aetna 
to UnitedHealthcare, and costs increased by almost $300 with no major changes to the plan.
Both companies are national 
leaders in student insurance, ac-cording to The Wall Street Journal.
Dr. Phillip Barkley, director of 
the Student Health Care Center, said Aetna was asking for about a 40 percent price increase to pro-vide the same benefits as last year, which prompted the university to consider a new company. 
But even with the switch to 
United, insurance rates still in-
creased for students.
Kathy Lindsey, insurance coor -dinator at the Student Health Care 
Center, said that when considering new student plans, cost is a high priority. 
A cheap plan with less cover -
age may be chosen over an expen-sive plan with more coverage be-
cause the insurance office knows 
students are more willing to go without coverage than pay more money. 
Robert Jerry, dean of the Levin 
College of Law, said he is not sur -
prised that student plans are in-creasingly expensive. The student population is healthier than most 
demographics, so student insur -
ance is priced to make more profit 
than other insurance products, he said. 
Student health insurance plans 
rank among the worst in the coun-try, according to The Wall Street Journal.  Each year, costs go up and coverage goes down. 
Jordan Peters, a UF journalism 
junior, has been insured by UF’s student health insurance since he was a freshman. He said missing that few hundred dollars out of his total living expenses for the year makes a huge difference.  
“This year we kind of signed up 
out of habit more than anything,” Peters said. Because of rising costs, 
he might look for a new insurance 
plan next year. 
There are 6,882 students regis-
tered with the student health in-
surance, according to Lindsey.
While the costs are 
constantly climbing, 
insurance companies are making 
up to five times more profit on 
student plans than they make on other types of plans, according to a study from the Massachusetts Di-vision of Health Care Finance and Policy from 2009.
Lindsey said this statistic could 
be explained by what insurance companies call a risk pool. A risk 
pool represents the number of 
people who may not sign up for insurance. If a university does not require insurance, they have a large risk pool. If university insur -
ance policies are required, the risk 
pool is almost zero. 
The smaller the risk pool, the 
more money an insurance com -
pany makes, because everybody 
is paying for insurance whether they need it or not. But UF doesn’t require students to have health in-surance, resulting in a larger risk pool and higher cost. 
The most popular basic plan 
for students costs $1,569 per year, compared to $1,391 last year.
The insurance plan does not 
include routine dental treatment, preventative medicine, routine eye care or other items on the exclu-sion list in the 2010 insurance plan booklet available at SHCC.
Jerry believes the new health 
care legislation  passed by Con-gress may also have an effect on student health care plans. The new law states that full-time students can be covered by their parents’ 
insurance up until age 26. 
University insurance plans may 
become more expensive because 
there will be less need for them, he said. 
There are ways to bring insur -
ance costs down for students, but 
it’s not in the hands of the uni-
versity, Jerry said. If the state and federal governments team up to regulate insurance and provide ev-eryone with some degree of health care, costs would go down.
“We ought to have a system 
where everybody has some kind of access to basic health care,” he 
said. 
For the time being, students can 
use tools provided by the health 
care center, such as pamphlets and online links, to educate themselves about insurance plans and ensure that they get a plan that best fits their needs. 
“Insurance is just plain old not 
easy to understand,” Lindsey said. 
Employees at the insurance of-
fice are available to answer stu-dents’ questions, she said. 
“I believe each person has a 
unique situation,” Lindsey said. “I 
definitely think [the student] plan 
is a worthy option, even more so if the alternative is going unin-sured.”

In 1931, members of Florida Blue Key held a meeting to 
determine a new name for the Homecoming celebration, 
which was known until then as “Dad’s Day.”
After failing to come up with a new name, an agitated 
member mentioned letting a “gator growl,” and the pep rally was named.
Since then, Gator Growl, recognized as the country’s larg-
est student-produced pep rally,  has become a sensation. It has attracted big name comedians such as Bill Cosby and Robin Williams, and its name has been put up in lights on shows like “Jeopardy!” and “The Daily Show.”
“Obviously, it’s a huge part of tradition here,” said uni-
versity spokesman Steve Orlando. “It’s a great opportunity for students and alums to get together and have a good time together. I think that’s the aim.”
Gator Growl has come a long way since the days when 
cheerleaders and marching bands were the sole performers. This year’s show will feature a triple-projector system that will utilize the entire football field as its screen. 
According to UF historian Carl Van Ness, Homecom-
ing has been celebrated since 1916. However, there was no Growl-like event until 1923, when Dad’s Day was started.
When the pep rally was created, UF was still a men-only 
university, and Homecoming was celebrated with students and their dads.
Back when the show first started, no bands or comedians 
performed.Instead, entertainment came in the form of student skits, 
marching bands and cheerleading performances. 
In 1936, the sound system cost $7.50, security cost $2 and 
the defective fireworks cost $25. 
In 2010, the show has a $1.5 million budget.But as the event — and technology — evolved, the need 
for bigger and better things acts became more urgent. 
Bob Hope became the first nationally recognized come-
dian to perform at Gator Growl in 1976.  The light shows and performances became a point of emphasis during the 1980s, Van Ness said. 
The challenge for the show’s producers is to come up with 
acts that will please not only students, but alumni as well. 
Orlando recalled an incident in 1982 when Robin Williams 
was brought in as the entertainment. Williams’ raunchy act was funny to students but not to the alumni, causing a con-
troversy, he said.
The following year, Bob Hope was brought 
back to perform for a third time to bring back family-friendly entertainment, he said.
“I do not envy the people that have to pick the talent be-
cause it’s not easy to find someone who pleases everybody,” Orlando said. 
Producer Mike Shapiro said that is the toughest part of 
his job. 
“We worry about making sure a Gator fan is happy,” he 
said. “Doesn’t matter whether they’re 80 years old or 12 years old or a newborn.”
The factors affecting talent selection include the artist’s 
tour schedule and asking price, which can rule out certain acts. 
Show producers threw around ideas for acts such as the 
Black Eyed Peas and the cast of “Glee,” but they did not work out, Shapiro said. 
Gator Growl is going bandless for the first time since 
2006.
Guest celebrity cameos played between skits and perfor -
mances have also become an integral feature of the rally. 
Presidential candidates Barack Obama and John McCain 
lit up the screen with their Gator chomps in 2008. 
Usually, the cameos are obtained because people at the 
university have connections to certain celebrities, Shapiro said. 
“The fact that a person that is now a president and some-
one who was a presidential candidate wanted to be on Ben Hill’s Jumbotron just goes to show how important and large-in-scope the event is,” Shapiro said.
Gator Growl has served as a model for other universities’ 
pep rallies as well. 
In 1995, Oklahoma State University sent representatives 
to Gator Growl, according to Kent Sampson, OSU director of student life. When they returned, they created their own version of the pep rally, called Orange Peel. 
But despite the elaborate light shows, high-profile en-
tertainment and far reaching impact,  Shapiro made it clear that  Gator Growl is still ultimately the same thing it has been since 1932.
“At its heart, Gator Growl is a pep rally,” he said. “The 
goal is to give a Gator fan, no matter the age, entertainment for two-and-a-half hours.”University officials look back on Gator Growl history

Students sit on the new benches around the “potato” on Turlington Plaza on Wednesday.
By JON SILMAN
Alligator Staff Writer
You may have noticed a surge of construction on campus lately, 
but according to the UF Physical Plant Division, it’s just business 
as usual.
Among the recent and upcoming projects are the new concrete 
benches around “the potato” on Turlington Plaza, the overhaul 
of the ground on Plaza of the Americas, the repaving of the street 
around Norman Hall and the refurbishment of the UF bandshell.
The division — the unsung hero of UF construction — handles 
all of the maintenance, utilities and construction projects around campus, costing anywhere from $500 to $2 million.
Jeff Bair has been at PPD for 12 years as a project manager, and 
he’s worked on quite a few construction projects around campus.
“From something as small as moving a door to as big as reno-
vating an entire building,” he said. 
Bair said he has not seen any major changes in budget alloca-
tion in the time he’s been working. Also, there isn’t any recent surge in construction projects, he said. 
The Plaza of the Americas project involved a dam-
aged steam line that was leaking and needed to be replaced. It was an emergency project that took two and a half months to finish, costing about $300,000.
The benches on Turlington were rotted out and became danger -
ous, according to Rod Clements, another PPD project manager.
The wooden benches were high maintenance, so they were re-
placed with concrete ones, he said. The project cost $5,000.
There’s been some construction around Norman, as well, but 
that’s covered by the city because it’s not actually on the campus itself, Bair said. According to Harold Barrand, the associate direc-tor of PPD, it also just finished refurbishing the band building. It built a brand new practice room and converted the old one into a practice hall for $750,000. PPD will refurbish the UF  bandshell at Flavet Field, but Student Government will supply the money.
There are about 250 upcoming projects.“Fortunately , not all of those projects have to be done today ,” 
Bair said.Physical Plant hard at work on construction projects

Grace Donnalley holds all the power. 
At least that’s what students think when 
they crowd her ticket window every week before Florida football games and prostrate themselves for good seats.
“Please,” they beg. “It’s my first game. I’m 
graduating soon. Please, please, please.”
Power in Gainesville means the 50-yard 
line. Power means Row 1, an achievement worthy of bragging rights and hero worship. 
In the days leading up to Saturday , Grace is 
more popular than the head cheerleader. 
“If you give me good seats, you can come 
to my birthday party,” students promise.
They tell Grace she looks nice. They smile 
their best smiles and lean on the counter and flirt for all they’re worth. Grace, 21, is a speech therapy major from Lynn Haven. After class, she walks to the ticket office in the stadium.  
She clocks in online at noon with a Univer -
sity Athletic Association login and receives a bag of 100 to 200 randomly assigned tickets, which will be replenished throughout the day. 
She only looks at the tickets to count them, 
and then she keeps them facedown. 
“When I give out tickets with bad seats, I 
still feel bad, but I don’t feel responsible.”
This will be the fourth year Grace has 
worked at the ticket office for minimum wage. This will be the fourth year she has tried to get the 21,000-strong student section to un-derstand she has no control if the seats in her 
bag are terrible. She has no control if students’ 
Gator 1 Cards won’t scan, if they forget to wait for their friends or if they are late to pick up their tickets. Of course, no one believes her.
So the law block brings donuts.Students pick Window 3 because it’s their 
favorite number or Window 5 because they’re superstitious. Some walk by all the windows like shop-
pers at a farmers market searching for the per -
fect cantaloupe — if cantaloupes could smile and hand out 10th row seats to the game.
When they approach, students make des-
perate eye contact — a last, tacit plea.
Grace counts and swipes their IDs. She 
picks up a stack of upside-down tickets, rubber-banded to designate rows and aisle breaks. She tosses the empty band, crinkled, 
on the countertop. She fans out the tickets to 
count them and firmly rips off the stubs.
“Thank you!” she says.If they get good seats, ecstasy reigns. The 
lucky recipients call their friends and synchro-nize Gator cheers. For the less fortunate, those  with financial holds, faulty Gator 1s or bad seats, the charm wears off. Curses blast. 
Grace’s boss, Doug Sutherland, admires 
her nerve. 
“Grace is very personable,” he said, “and 
she doesn’t get frazzled.” 
A guy with a short goatee rushes to the 
window and scoots his card through the slot. When Grace tries to swipe, the computer pulls up a screen that says “Custom Report.” 
“You might need to get a new ID.”“You can’t just type my number in?” 
“Sorry, we can’t do that.” Her voice slides 
up an octave when she’s uncomfortable. 
“Wow,” he says, “that is a dagger.” 
On her days off, Grace stops by Shands 
Pediatric Unit 42. She plays with kids with 
compromised immune systems who stay 
there. But students don’t know about Unit 
42, so when they miss the 5 p.m. deadline for 
ticket pickup on Thursday, they bang on the aluminum siding and scream at her.
Usually, Grace keeps her window open un-
til 5:01 p.m., if she sees stragglers running up 
the concourse. After that, she’s the bad cop. 
“I hate it,” she said. “People get mad if you 
close, but where do I draw the line?”Two years ago, Grace had to be escorted out 
of the office. A group of people who missed the deadline by 15 minutes started banging on the windows and yelling. Her old boss told her not to leave by herself and ordered a co-worker to walk her down the ramp. 
At 4:15 p.m., a group arrives at the window 
to pick up tickets for their friends. Grace paus-es halfway through the stack of IDs.
“Are you going to see Monica today?”
“Probably, why?”
“Are you going to see Monica in the next 
45 minutes?”
Like dozens before her, Monica’s ID won’t 
swipe. This begins a flurry of cell phone calls and texts to Monica, who is sitting in class.
Grace swipes up. Swipes down. Nothing.“You can’t just type it in?“No, she has to get her ID remagnetized,” 
Grace says.
More texts. The line at the window starts 
to clog.
“I’m sorry to be a pain in the ass—”“Oh! It worked,” Grace says. “Here you 
go.”
Fifteenth time’s the charm.Grace has season tickets, —she insists she 
had to enter the student ticket lottery . 
Sometimes she works at the stadium on 
Saturdays, but she normally gets out by the end of the first quarter. When she climbs to her seat, no one yells at her or bangs on the bleachers. Students shuffle their knees when she squeezes by to get a drink at halftime, and when the Gators go up by seven, they slap her a high-five. 14, ALLIGATOR � FRIDAY, OCTOBER 15, 2010

Thirty years. Almost as many Growls.  George 
Burns in 1980 was the first, and the first for 
us. Over the years, sometimes you'd say that 
we can skip one, but we always went. We 
always returned to the beginning of us. This 
year is special for many reasons: 25 years 
married; 30 together; and the best of all is 
that Little Blue Eyes is a student at UF! She 
makes us so proud. I can't wait to see her. I 
can't wait for all three of us to spend Growl together this year. Each year my love for you 
grows stronger, and the three of us makes 
me the luckiest man in the world.

To Liarface and The Girl With The Beautiful 
Blue Eyes,
With 16 years of homecoming in my past and 
18 years of life with you as my wonderful, 
supporting parents, I am forever grateful for 
what you have done for me. My life was start-
ed with two famous words: Go Gators. I have 
been dressed in every Gator outfit, gone to 
countless Gator games, and have remained 
a Gator fan my entire life. It is now 2010, my 
17th homecoming and my first year, finally, as a UF student. You are the best parents 
a girl could ask for and I love you both so 
much.
Love, Little Blue Eyes

TEEING OFF WITH ANTHONY CHIANGSITE: The Swamp (cap. 88,548)
KICKOFF: Saturday 7 p.m.
TV/RADIO: ESPNU/WRUF AM850
alligatorSports.org POLL RESULTSWe heard the news of Ole Miss’ new 
mascot and we couldn’t pass this game 
up.
The Rebels finally did away with 
their traditional one that brought the 
confederacy to mind and will use a 
black bear instead.
We left it to two alligatorSports staff 
writers to debate the Bulldogs’ next game against Alabama.
Ole Miss (+20.5) will avoid the 
blowout because ... 
The South will rise again. Mike McCall thinks he’s standing 
in support of the South by picking Ala-
bama to cover, since he loves all those 
cute little southern sorority girls, but he actually got this one backward. 
We’ve long discussed how a team 
gains an incredible amount of momen-tum when playing in the wake of the death of a teammate, coach, etc. 
Well, Ole Miss is playing this week 
after the death of something far greater. 
Colonel Reb. For this reason, Ole Miss will rally 
and cover this nearly three-touchdown spread. There’s no way Ole Miss win this game, but McCall will see when the real South puts its mind to some-thing, they can lose by 20 with the best of ‘em. 
— KYLE MAISTRI
Lord Saban and the Tide (-20.5) will 
demolish the spread because:
The Rebel Black Bear? Seriously?!After banishing Colonel Reb and 
tantalizing the nation with talk of instat-
ing Admiral Ackbar, Ole Miss chose a 
black bear as its new mascot Thursday — despite the fact that this mascot is supposed to be more racially sensitive (Note to Ole Miss: leave color out of it) and that the only kind of bear native to the state is named after Louisiana.
The relation between the school and 
bears goes back to Teddy Roosevelt 
once ordering the mercy killing of a 
 HE IS 9-9 AS MISSISSIPPI 
STATE’S HEAD COACH.
By MIKE McCALL
Alligator Staff Writer
mmccall@alligator.org
 
A week after booing offensive 
coordinator Steve Addazio, Flor -
ida fans will welcome their ideal 
play-caller to The Swamp.
But he’ll be standing on the op-
posite sideline.
Mississippi State coach Dan 
Mullen — two years removed from the helm of the Gators’ of-fense — will lead his Bulldogs against UF on Saturday, serving 
as a reminder of the high-scor -
ing attacks he guided while in 
Gainesville.
“I think now that I’m gone 
the Florida fans like me more than when I was there, that’s for sure,” Mullen said. “I think they just have such high expectations for everything there, and it sets a 
standard.”
In truth, Mullen is partly re-
sponsible for setting that stan-
dard.
In his last two years at Florida, 
Mullen led the Gators to more than 43 points per game and pro-duced a Heisman Trophy winner, and his final season culminated in 
a national title and school record 
for points.
Addazio took charge in 2009 
after Mullen’s departure for 
Starkville, Miss. His first year 
was frustrating at times, but UF still produced the Southeastern Conference’s top offense with 457 yards per game, averaging 35.9 
points.
This season has been a very 
different story.
The Gators are No. 11 in the 
SEC for total offense (MSU is sixth — 93 yards per game better) and have just three offensive touch-
downs in the last two games. That led to Addazio being booed when he called run plays up the middle 
in the fourth quarter of last week’s loss to LSU.
UF coach Urban Meyer backed 
Addazio this week, saying the of-
fense’s problems are due to strug-gles in the red zone and a lack of 
Harrison Diamond / Alligator Staff
Mississippi State coach Dan Mullen, who was UF’s offensive coordinator from 2005-2008, will bring 
his team to The Swamp to take on Florida, which is coming off back-to-back losses.Mullen makes first trip back to Gainesville
Fans aren’t the only ones stuck in Flori-
da’s glory days.
It seems as if the coaches are too.
If you compare this season’s game film 
to one from any of the past three years, it would probably be hard to find much of a difference in the offense’s scheme.
Except there are a couple of minor things 
you may notice.
That 6-foot-3, 245-pound quarterback is 
no longer taking snaps. And the speedy guy who lined up as UF’s No. 1 wide receiver, 
backfield threat and Wildcat quarterback 
isn’t around either.
I think somebody should let coaches in on that little secret be-cause it looks like they have yet to figure it 
out.
The Florida offense 
that put up an aver -
age of 40.67 points and 455.4 yards per game 
under Tim Tebow is gone, but the strategy that led to that produc-
tion isn’t.
Only this year the personnel has changed 
and it’s leading to much different results.
The Gators are averaging 31 points and 323.7 yards per game with John Brantley running the show. But this isn’t Brantley’s fault.
Offensive coordinator Steve Addazio 
and coach Urban Meyer are forcing a totally different group of players who bring other skill sets to the table to run an offense that was made for Tebow and Percy Harvin.
Even last season you saw some hints of 
it.
They tried to plug Brandon James into 
the “Percy position” and that didn’t work. In 13 games he caught just 24 balls. Coaches must adjust to new wave of offensive talent

Whether it’s giving her 
team a mid-match pep talk, smacking a kill in 
crunch time or even tickling one of her brothers in a driveway pickup game, Callie Rivers will do whatever it takes to win. 
The senior outside hitter sim-
ply hates losing. 
She always has, and she al-
ways will.  
Regardless of if it’s the 
O’Connell Center floor with thousands looking on, like today against Auburn at 4 p.m., or the 
side of her house when nobody’s 
watching.
Even at a young age, she 
wouldn’t let her limited bas-
ketball acumen keep her from 
achieving victory. 
“I’m terrible at basketball, 
honestly,” said Rivers, who is the daughter of Boston Celtics coach 
Doc Rivers. “I can’t say I was 
picked first in the pickup games. But everybody knows that I hate 
losing and I’ll do anything to 
win. Even if I’m guarding my brother and I have to tickle him. Whatever it takes.”
That competitive nature has 
easily transitioned over to the volleyball court, where Rivers has been one of the team’s lead-ers since the beginning of her 
sophomore year. 
In practices and matches, 
Rivers has pushed herself and 
her teammates to give their best 
every day as they pursue their 
ultimate goal: a national cham-pionship. Woman among boys
Rivers has been a competitive 
person for as long as she can re-member. 
Growing up in a basketball 
family with three talented broth-ers and an NBA coach for a father, it was only natural that Rivers 
had a competitive ﬁ  re in every-
thing she did. 
“She’s all about winning, 
and it’s the same attitude off the court,” said her brother Jeremiah, 
a 23-year-old senior basketball 
player at Indiana University. “No matter what we’re doing, if it’s rummy, spades, other card games, any family competition, it’s all competitive with her.”
That spirit was never clearer 
than in her family’s pickup bas-ketball games, where Rivers would use whatever tactics she 
could to try to will her team to a 
win. 
“On the basketball court she’ll 
get goofy and try to make us laugh,” Jeremiah said. “She’ll 
even cheat sometimes and play 
a little dirty. She wasn’t all that great, but she was a crazy hus-tler.”
While playing the game honed her competitive side, it was watching it that really precipitat-ed her drive to reach greatness. 
When her father’s Boston 
Celtics defeated the Los Ange-les Lakers to win the 2008 NBA Championship, Rivers and her 
family were in their customary 
courtside seats. 
Rivers got to take part in the 
team’s on-court celebration, where she saw up close and per-
sonal what the emotions of win-
ning a championship are like.
“When [the Celtics] won, see-
ing how happy they were, it 
just makes you want to experi-
ence that,” Rivers said. “I know I would love to experience that this year.”
Practice makes perfect
Rivers’ nonstop motor has 
been essential for taking some of the grind out of a four-month 
volleyball season. 
It wouldn’t be unreasonable 
for a team to fall into a rut and 
simply coast through practice, 
but that certainly won’t happen 
on Rivers’ watch. 
“Complacency certainly hasn’t 
become a part of this team, nor will we let it,” coach Mary Wise 
said. “I don’t think Callie Rivers 
will let it.”
For a team that preaches being 
a “work in progress” despite its 
No. 1 ranking, there is no room to 
take time off in practice. 
This message is clear as day in 
Rivers’ mind, and she refuses to watch other teams improve while 
the Gators rest on their laurels. 
“You just have to make sure 
that everyone realizes that even 
in the middle of the season you 
don’t want to get into a lull,” Riv-
ers said. “Other top teams are taking every single rep seriously and trying to get better, and at the end of the season you don’t 
want to remember that one rep 
you took off that could’ve made you better.”
To this end, Rivers and the 
Gators have started to attach scores not only to team scrim-mages, but also to many individ-ual drills. 
And even when they don’t, 
Rivers’ teammates still have to be prepared for her to give it her all on every point. 
“Having Callie makes practice 
a lot more fun, because even if it’s a drill and there’s not even a score, if you’re blocking against her, you know that she’s deﬁ  -nitely going to try to get it past 
you,” junior Kelly Murphy said. 
“It kinda makes it a little game within the game.”
The senior’s constant full-
throttle effort gives her team-mates someone to look up to and emulate. 
“I think if you come into prac-tice knowing that you’re going to have to ﬁ  ght and work hard for 
every point, it makes you auto-
matically get better,” Murphy said. 
Final Destination
Rivers’ motivational skills 
and take-charge personality are not just conﬁ  ned to the practice 
court. 
When the Gators hit a slump 
in the middle of a tight match, 
they all know they can turn to her 
for encouragement.
“She’s really good at getting 
people back on track,” senior middle blocker Lauren Bledsoe 
said. “She’ll probably ﬁ  rst tell everyone to settle down, calm down, not get so ﬁ  red up and not let the atmosphere get the best of 
us.”
“She’d say that we need to 
come back, have respect for our-
selves and just play better, point 
blank.”
Typically, an appeal of this 
nature evokes an immediate re-
sponse from Rivers’ teammates. 
They know that she’s been 
in the program for four years, been surrounded by athletics her whole life and knows what it takes to win.
“It’s just like, ‘Wow, she knows 
that we’re all better than this, so we need to step it up and just do what we’ve been practicing and 
what we know we can do,’” Mur-
phy said. 
Rivers says that one inspira-
tion for her pep talks is the sense 
of urgency coach Wise expects to 
see from all of her seniors as they try to end their careers on a high note. 
Rivers, Bledsoe and libero Erin 
Fleming all understand that this is their last chance to take home a title and leave their mark on the program. 
This feeling of desperation 
is one Rivers looks to spread through some of the younger 
players via her motivational 
speech. 
“People on our team know 
that since I’m a senior, and Lau-ren and Erin are seniors, that this 
is our last chance,” Rivers said. 
“So if you’re not going to do it for yourself just do it for one of us, because we want to win this year 
and every single opportunity that 
we have to get better we need to take it.”
To this point the message ap-
pears to have been taken to heart, 
as the Gators have risen from 
preseason No. 13 all the way to No. 1. 
But only time will tell if Riv-
ers’ leadership, ﬁ  re and competi-tive drive can lift Florida to its ﬁ  rst-ever national championship. FRIDAY, OCTOBER 15, 2010  ALLIGATOR, 21

This season it’s all about Andre Debose becoming the next 
Harvin. And the minute Trey Burton scored six touchdowns 
against Kentucky, the Tebow comparisons began to roll in. 
Just stop.Harvin and Tebow are players that will never be repli-
cated and the coaches need to see that.
Instead of limiting Brantley to just over six yards per pass 
attempt and forcing him to run option plays, let him throw it down field. 
And please let Brantley, the starting quarterback, play 
when the offense crosses the 10-yard line. 
Also, instead of waiting for Debose to become the next 
Percy, just throw him out there to make plays.
The players should not have to change their games to 
accommodate Meyer’s offense. It should be the other way around. Games aren’t won on the sidelines, they are won 
on the field.
It’s like asking a team that features LeBron James, Dwy-
ane Wade and Chris Bosh to play a half-court game because 
that’s what coach Erik Spoelstra specializes in. No, they are going to run up and down the floor.
It’s time to realize the Tebow-Harvin days are over and 
for another era of UF football to emerge.Brantley: Mullen said he would blitz me
playmakers, and quarterback John Brantley said he 
wasn’t concerned with outside opinions of his offen-sive coach.
“I trust coach Addazio and his play-calling,” Brant-
ley said. “I’m going to do what he says, and I’m not going to complain because I trust coach Addazio and I think he’s a great coach. He’s just trying to put us in the 
best position to win, and I believe that.”
Playmakers may still be in short supply Saturday 
night, as running back Jeff Demps is healing from 
a sprained left foot. But the Gators may have seen enough from receiver Andre Debose last week to get 
him more involved.
In limited use, Debose is averaging more than 10 
yards per touch, and his 88-yard kickoff return touch-
down against the Tigers signaled the redshirt fresh-
man’s readiness to perform.
“I feel that I can bring that element to the team,” De-
bose said. “We have a lot of players capable of making 
big plays, it’s just that coaches have to put people in certain situations to make those plays.”
Doing that against Mullen won’t be an easy task. 
An architect of UF’s scheme, he’s very familiar with the Gators’ offense and players, and he runs a similar sys-tem with the Bulldogs.
Last season against Florida, MSU trailed by three 
entering the fourth quarter and lost 29-19, with both of the Bulldogs’ touchdowns coming off interceptions 
returned for scores.
“[Mullen] knows this offense,” Brantley said. “He 
told me [when he left] he was going to blitz me a lot 
when we finally get to play them. I’ll never forget 
that.”
While Mullen was never derided in an open fash-
ion, his tenure at UF wasn’t without strife.
After the Gators fell to Ole Miss in 
2008, a website calling for his dismissal gained popularity. Then, Florida romped 
to a national title, outscoring opponents 414-97 in its final eight regular-season games, and the criticism came to an 
abrupt halt.
Addazio’s detractors have created a similar website, 
and Mullen can identify with the situation.
“I’m sure there probably still is [a “fire Mullen” site] 
now for here at Mississippi State,” Mullen said. “Don’t 
they have one for every coach? I would think it’s good 
business if someone’s named head coach to go buy that domain name on the Internet so you can start selling it.”FOOTBALL,  from page 20

The women’s basketball program is full 
of fresh faces, and not all of them are wear -
ing jerseys on gameday. At least not any-
more.
Coach Amanda Butler added a new 
member to her coaching staff in the offsea-son with the hire of one of the most prolific players in school history , Murriel Page. 
Page was a member of the 1996-97 Elite 
Eight team that came one shot away from 
reaching the Final Four. She is also second 
on the list of UF’s all-time leading scorers and fresh off an 11-year WNBA career. One that she said wasn’t easy to give up.
“I think for the past five years I’ve been 
trying to talk myself out of walking away from the game,” Page said. “I just think when a great opportunity presents itself, sometimes you just have to decide to take 
a new journey, and it was time. It was time 
for me to stop being a player and take that 
new journey.”
She joined the staff over the summer 
and has immediately made an impact, get-
ting involved in practice and meshing with the players. 
Page said she doesn’t take it easy on 
them either, believing that competition in prac-tice and her physical nature will prepare the 
team for the style of play 
in the Southeastern Con-ference. 
“I knew that no one 
was going to push me any harder than my

There was a certain air of somberness 
on the Gators’ side during Monday’s 
swim meet. 
Swimming is a sport that’s both 
mental and physical, and the Gators 
had something heavy resting on their hearts.
Senior swimmer Matthew Norton 
was recently involved in a scooter ac-cident. 
“Although no fault of his own, it’s a 
really unfortunate situation that will re-quire some surgery,” head coach Gregg Troy said in a statement. “He is doubtful to return this season.”
Though Norton is expected to be out for the rest of the season, Troy said, “Most importantly, Matt is healthy and 
we’re all glad he is going to be fine.”
Norton, of Port Orange, is a 2010 
All-American in the 200-yard freestyle 
relay. 
Last season, he was part of the team 
that swam the second-fastest time in the 
history of the event. 
Currently, Norton holds the third-
fastest 50-freestyle and 200-individual 
medley times in the Southeastern Con-
ference for this season as well as the 
fifth-fastest 100- and 200-freestyle times. 
Norton was also part of the 200-, 400- 
and 800-freestyle relay teams that record-ed the quickest times in SEC this season. Gators swimmer involved

New assistant coach to 
help with recruiting
ence brings an aspect to her coach-
ing style that most don’t have. 
“She sees things that a player 
would see, someone that’s been in 
the game,” Jones said. 
Page also provides a competitive 
advantage for the Gators on the re-
cruiting trail. 
“I can help [recruits] because I 
can actually tell them some things that they wouldn’t get from some of the other coaches,” Page said. “I’m 
speaking from my heart. I’ve said 
that I’ve come to Florida. I’ve walked 
the walk. I know what it feels like to 
be a Gator.”
That makes two former Gators 
on the staff, as Butler led UF to its 
first two NCAA Tournament ap-
pearances in 1993 and 1994 as a 
player and was an assistant coach from 1995-97. 
“I think it’s obvious their passion 
for Gators basketball,” Jones said. “That’s something that you can’t imitate, and that’s something that 
you can’t have unless you’ve played 
here. They love this place and that shows in the hard work they put 
in.”
Their passion is a champion-
ship, something that eluded both 
as players, and 
something they haven’t forgotten. 
Page reminisced at Wednesday’s media day about a rebound she 
missed in the Elite 
Eight that she felt 
cost her team the victory . 
“I’m here to tell them I know 
what it feels like not to make it to the Final Four by two points, and you don’t want that feeling,” she 
said. “You don’t want that feeling, 
because you can’t get it back.

After their worst weekend of conference play, 
the Gators return home.
No. 13 Florida (10-2-2, 4-1-1 Southeastern Con-
ference) hosts SEC rival Tennessee (6-6-1, 4-1-1 
SEC) today at 5 p.m. and Georgia (8-2-4, 3-0-3 
SEC) on Sunday at 2 p.m.
When the Gators ventured to Alabama last 
Friday they were coming off their best offensive 
performance of the season. But they had trouble finding the back of the net, finishing the weekend with only one goal.
“We were very unlucky (last week),” midfield-
er Sarah Chapman said. “We had a lot of chances in the Alabama game, but we know to keep the 
ball going and to push it forward and keep our 
intensity up.”
Although the Gators have had troubles scor -
ing this season, the defense has been aggressive and resolute.
It allowed only a single goal in each game last 
weekend, and both were conceded in the final minute.
“It’s been in our head,” midfielder Holly King 
said. “From now on, it’s about staying focused in the last five minutes and not allowing those goals. Everyone on the team is sick of it.”
Now UF returns to James G. Pressly Stadium 
where it takes on a physical Volunteers squad 
with an identical SEC record.
“We have to do our job and our 
job only,” coach Becky Burleigh said. “It’s a self-fulfilling prophecy . We need to focus on what we need to do in those situations, and if we 
can all do that then we can elimi-
nate that problem. Sometimes it’s not about work-
ing harder, it’s about working smarter.”
This week in practice the Gators have been fo-
cusing on keeping possession and scoring early goals to take pressure off of their defense.
“Tennessee is very physical,” Chapman said. 
“We’re going to have to capitalize on hard tackles 
and win every ball in the air.”Gators look to bounce back

The names and faces may be the same, but 
the bodies and the mentality will be significant-
ly different. 
Although starting frontcourt seniors Chan-
dler Parsons, Alex Tyus and Vernon Macklin 
are all reprising roles they assumed last year, 
they expect to do so with more physicality this 
time around.
“We’re a year older, a year better, and a year 
stronger,” Parsons said. 
The team is holding its first practice today, 
but coach Billy Donovan is already noticing the difference.  
“The one thing that definitely stands out 
right away is that I think we’re much more of a 
physical team,” Donovan said. “We’re a tougher 
team than maybe we have been the last couple 
of years.”
The primary reason for this shift is the arriv-
al of freshmen Cody Larson and Patric Young, who are expected to push the starters in practice like no one could last season. 
Both measure an imposing 6-foot-9 and 225 pounds, and Young is drawing comparisons to some of the most muscular big men to ever play the game.
“They call me Karl Malone, Dwight How-
ard,” Young said. “They tell me I need to stop 
lifting weights so much and start stretching 
more.”
Young, who says he is already the strongest 
player on the team after benching 300 pounds 
in high school, possesses much more than just 
impressive measurables. 
“Patric Young brings a dif-
ferent style of game,” Macklin said. “He is one of those guys 
that you know you have to box 
out because he is coming hard every time.”
Macklin also noted that 
Young’s relentless physicality is present on both offense and 
defense, and that he’s liable to do some serious 
damage to anyone who’s brave enough to line 
up against him. 
“He’s got like seven or eight elbows,” Mack-
lin said. “Off a rebound or when he’s doing post Gators look to bring physicality

Florida’s new McDonald’s All-
American point guard showed off 
his shooting stroke at the team’s media day Wednesday . 
After interviews had concluded, 
Mike Rosario stood at the top of the key in UF’s basketball practice 
facility and casually dumped in 
3-pointer after 3-pointer, each with perfect rotation, as freshman swing-man Casey Prather took the ball out of the net and loaded Rosario up for his next shot. 
Unfortunately for Gators fans, 
only Rosario’s teammates will be taking his swishes out of the net this 
season. 
Rosario, a 2008 McDonald’s All-
American, transferred from Rutgers 
at the end of last season after aver -
aging 16.2 and 16.7 points per game, respectively, in his two years in the Big East. 
“It just wasn’t the right atmo-
sphere for me,” Rosario said. “It just wasn’t a positive thing for me. 
The teammates that I had, they just 
didn’t want to work hard, and that’s what I was about. I wanted to push them, but they didn’t want to push me, and it just wasn’t the right at-mosphere for me.”

Young broke Prather’s nose on pick-and-roll in offseason workouts
moves, he hits you with an elbow 
on like every possession, but that’s a good thing.”
One Gator who might disagree 
with that assessment is freshman Casey Prather, who broke his nose 
playing against Young during a summer workout.
According to teammates, the 
two got tangled up on a pick-and-roll that left Prather bloodied, but 
otherwise all right. 
“Patric’s got a little edge to 
him,” Larson said. “Off the court you’ll talk to him and he’s the nic-
est guy in the world. But on the court he’s a different person.”
Young said: 
“Once we get on the court 
it’s a battle, and I’m gonna go out there 
and do what I have to do to win,” 
Young’s physicality is forc-ing everyone around him to get stronger in order to handle the punishment he dispenses during 
workouts. 
For Macklin this is a sharp de-
parture from last season, when 
an injury to Kenny Kadji left him without a comparable opponent. 
“It’s better because when I go against guys in the [Southeastern 
Conference] it’s going to be the 
same thing as in practice,” Mack-lin said. “Last year it was me go-ing against Alex (Tyus) or (Erik) 
Murphy almost every day. This 
year there are a lot of different guys that I can go against, a lot of different styles.”

Rosario looks forward to playing in Donovan’s up-tempo offensive style
ally,” he said. “I’ve been playing against Mike 
since the seventh grade when we were at the little boys club and he would come in his base-ball uniform and play against us. They didn’t win many times, but Mike’s a great player. He 
can really shoot the ball, he’s going to help us 
practice.”
That’s the task coach Billy Donovan is as-
signing to Rosario for his season on the bench — push Walker and shooting guard Kenny Boynton every day in practice.
Donovan issued the same challenge to se-
nior center Vernon Macklin, also a former Mc-Donald’s All-American, when he spent 2008-
09 on the sidelines after transferring from 
Georgetown. 
Macklin said he spoke with Rosario about 
what it’s like to transfer to UF and the frustra-tions of not playing for an entire year.
“I told him how tough it was,” Macklin 
said. “How, on game days, it’s just miserable to just sit there. Guys are getting hyped, and you got your street clothes on and you want 
to play so bad, but there’s nothing you can do 
about it.”
Macklin made it out the other side, averag-
ing more than 10 points and five rebounds as a junior last season. Macklin said he will do anything he can to help Rosario stay positive and achieve the same success, but at the end of the day it can be a lonely year for transfers. 
“It’s going to be tough [to keep Rosario pos-
itive], though, because when I was at George-town, Patrick Ewing Jr. was transferring [from Indiana] so I saw what he went through and then I had to go through it,” Macklin said. 
For Rosario, the promise of what awaits 
him next season will have to be enough to keep him motivated.
Often bogged down in half-court sets at 
Rutgers, Rosario said he can’t wait to push the 
ball in Donovan’s fast-paced offense. Walker 
told Rosario that UF’s style of play fits the transfer perfectly , and Rosario said he made sure to take note of the Gators’ pace when UF beat his Rutgers team 73-58 in Atlantic City last season. 
“I just like the way how coach [Donovan] 
tries to score the ball,” Rosario said. “Every eight seconds, he tries to get up the court and 
score the ball and that’s what I’m used to. I’m 
used to running and that’s what I wanted to do and that’s the type of team I wanted to be on.”
Though it won’t feel that way on game-
days, Rosario is a part of the Gators beginning now. 
He’s already helped Prather with the finer 
points of quickly taking a made basket out of 
the net.ROSARIO , from page 26

Florida’s defense is coming off one of its worst 
performances against the run this season, and the 
unit does not have much time to adjust.
After surrendering 161 yards on the ground 
to LSU last week, Florida turns to Mississippi State and its rushing attack, which ranks third in the Southeastern Conference with 214 yards per game.
Those stats were boosted last week when MSU 
gashed Houston for 409 yards on the ground. The Bulldogs feature four players with more than 100 rushing yards this season, led by junior Vick Bal-lard (418 yards, SEC-best 11 touchdowns) and 
quarterback Chris Relf (295 yards).
“They’re a good rushing team,” coach Urban 
Meyer said. “Any time you get your quarterback 
involved in the run game like LSU did and like this team will, that’s the plus-one issue that every-body deals with.”
Meyer added that he was unhappy with his 
team’s performance against LSU dual-threat quarterback Jordan Jefferson, who gained 42 yards and scored twice against Florida. Allowing 117.8 yards per game, Florida’s run defense ranks eighth in the SEC.
To be successful against Relf, UF’s defense will 
need to confuse him by blitzing, stunting defen-sive linemen and loading the box, Meyer said.
The Gators will also need to tackle better than 
they did last week, defensive coordinator Teryl 
Austin said. He would not say how many tackles 
the defense missed against LSU, just that the unit did not achieve its goal of less than 10. 
Involving Hines: Meyer said the Gators’ of-
fense has yet to find a home-run threat since Sept. 18, when running back Jeff Demps was injured against Tennessee.
Asked where big plays could come from, Mey-
er said, “The receivers and maybe some quarter -
back runs. We’re a little hamstrung right now.”
But he did say he’s been impressed with wide 
receiver Omarius Hines. The sophomore has only recorded 10 catches for 129 yards this season, but has impressed Meyer carrying the ball on three trick plays.
He gained 36 yards on a fake punt against Tennessee, 19 yards on a reverse against Alabama and 10 yards on an end-around against LSU on 
Florida’s go-ahead drive late in the fourth quar -
ter. 
“He’s struggled a little bit getting open, but 
every time you give him the ball he’s pretty dy-
namic with it,” Meyer said. “So maybe that’s one of the answers: give him the ball.”
Injuries: The odds of Demps (sprained foot) 
playing this week are “50/50,” which is slightly lower than that of running back Mike Gillislee (bruised ankle bone), who Meyer said has been limited in practice all week. 
Receiver Deonte Thompson (concussion) and 
strong safety Matt Elam (concussion) practiced at 
full speed for the first time this week Thursday , 
Meyer said.
Linebacker Dee Finley (collarbone) will miss 
“a couple weeks,” and offensive lineman David Young (fractured kneecap) will probably be out 
for the rest of the season, Meyer said.
The coach expects offensive tackle Matt 
Patchan (wrist) and cornerback Moses Jenkins (el-
bow) to be ready by Oct. 30, when Florida plays Georgia.Gators look to contain Bulldogs’ rushing attack
