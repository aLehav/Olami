Gators home games boost local business
By DAVID TINTER
Alligator Contributing Writer
For a few days in the fall, Cody Atkinson's
job gets a little crazy.
Atkinson, an employee of Gator Shop in
UF plaza, works every Game Day.
"It's a mad house in here," he said. "The
whole staff has to work. It's hard to even
walk."Gator Shop, like most of the stores and res-
taurants near UF, sees a huge boost in busi-
ness on days when the Gators play at home.
According to Gator Shop manager Joi
Bass, the store does about 60 percent of
its business for the entire year on the six
or seven days of Gators football games.
Gator Shop makes most of its money selling
T-shirts, but the store also has a variety of
souvenirs and other merchandise.
Even with the rain Saturday, the store hadlots of business.
"The rain [doesn't] hurt us at all," At-
kinson said. "People need ponchos and still
come in to shop."
But the demand doesn't stopLocal at orange and blue shirts andNews fan hands.
According to barista Mary
Holden, Leonardo's by the Slice doubles or
triples its normal business on game days.
"We're always slammed on game days,"she said.
With Gators game attendance nearing
100,000 at times, Gainesville is flooded with
hungry and souvenir-seeking fans on game
weekends. But it's hard for economists to
measure the true effect on the local econo-
my.
UF economics professors Roger Blair and
Mark Rush are trying to figure it out.

morning for the 11th Annual
Breakfast on the Plaza and Home-

The fair, sponsored by the
Alachua County Coalition for the
Homeless and Hungry, provided
free services including ID cards,
health screenings, haircuts and
bicycle repairs.
Coalition director Jon DeCar-
mine said the fair, which featured
about 25 organizations, was espe-
cially helpful to those new to the
streets.
Alachua's homeless popula-
tion has increased by 70 percent
over the past two years to nearly
1,600.
Unfortunately, the coalition's
funding has decreased, DeCar-
mine said.
"We're running on 20 percent
of last year's budget. This is a real

Jonah Rails

NATIONAL
Federal act could send $40B into Pell Grant funding
By CJ PRUNER
Alligator Writer
In an effort to take some pressure off students' wallets, the
U.S. House of Representatives passed legislation Thursday that
will help provide easier access to financial assistance for col-
lege.
The Student Aid and Fiscal Responsibility Act, which
passed by a vote of 253-171, is considered the largest federalinvestment in education in American history.
The act, which will be presented to the Senate by the end of
the month, will pour roughly $40 billion into Pell Grant fund-
ing, raising the maximum annual awards to $5,550 in 2010 and
eventually to $6,900 by 2019.
Other initiatives include providing roughly $2.5 billion to
historically black colleges, bolstering programs that aim to help
students finish school and simplifying the Free Application For
Federal Student Aid process.The bill also aims to save taxpayers about $87 billion over
a 10-year span by switching the administration of loans from
private banks to the Federal Direct Loan program and avoiding
bank subsidies.
The legislation also aims to keep loan interest rates low,
which are expected to increase to 6.8 percent by 2012.
"This is a very thrilling and very historic moment for our
country," House Speaker Nancy Pelosi told reporters in a con-

'Treebow' forced to get makeover
By THOMAS STEWART
Alligator Staff Writer
tstewart@alligator org
Unless Tebow has changed his
number to seven, Treebow is no
more.
The seven-and-a-half-foot-tall
wood carving outside Ballyhoo Grill,
located at 3700 W University Ave.,
that used to look like Tim Tebow has
gotten a makeover at the request of
the University Athletic Association.
Instead of Tebow's No. 15, the stat-
ue now wears No. 7.
The Bible verse
printed on the stat-
ue's eyeblack has
also been painted
over.
A manager at Bal-
lyhoo said he wasn't
allowed to comment
Tebow on the statue, but an-
other employee said
she thought the changes were made
Monday.
Chris Fragale, Ballyhoo's owner,
could not be reached for comment.
Steve McClain, spokesman for the
UAA, confirmed that the athletic as-
sociation worked with Ballyhoo Grill
over the past few months to resolve
the issue.
According to National Colle-
giate Athletic Association rules, if a
student-athlete's likeness is used to
promote a commercial product, the
student or the university has to take
action to stop it.The UAA deals with six to eight
cases involving the rule a month, ac-
cording to McClain.
Recently, the association sent
cease- and-desist letters to a children's
mental health organization that had
placed a turtle bearing the likeness ofTebow in downtown Jacksonville and
a Fort Myers baseball team attempting
to hold a "What Would Tim Tebow
Do?" night.
The turtle's jersey number was
changed from No. 15 to No. 1, and the
baseball team's night was renamed.

said Sedgwick handed in a formal letter
of resignation and an
Student apology.Government "I obviously have
taken a major stance
about how I feel about drinking and driv-

who work alongside me are the first peo-

Johnson said Sedgwick's decision did
not only reflect poorly on SG but on the UF

Board serves
breakfast to
early birds
By ANNIE QUINTANA
Alligator Contributing Writer
Walking through Turlington Plaza will soon
leave you with something other than coupons and
fliers in your hands.
Starting Monday, Wake Up With RUB, provided
by Reitz Union Board Entertainment, will be on
Turlington Plaza at 8:30 a.m. with free breakfast
prepared for all who stop by.
"There will be coffee, juice and all sorts of
breakfast pastries available to everyone
to help get a jump start on the week."
Kate Morrison
Co-director of promotions for RUB
"There will be coffee, juice and all sorts of break-
fast pastries available to everyone to help get a
jump start on the week," Kate Morrison, co-director
of promotions for RUB Entertainment, said.
Breakfast will be provided every other Monday
until Nov. 16.
"Breakfast hits people when they're most recep-
tive," according to Amy Marty, co-director for RUB
Entertainment.
RUB Entertainment is a student programming
board that provides free events in and around the
Reitz Union almost daily.
The board hopes breakfast will get people talk-
ing about events taking place on campus through-
out the semester and will get more people involved
in those activities.
"RUB events feature comedians, local and re-
gional bands and karaoke nights," Morrison said.
Wake Up with RUB hopes to inform the com-
munity of the events they sponsor on campus. But
at the end of the day, its goal is to provide breakfast
to the many college students that could really use a
coffee on Monday mornings.
"Who doesn't love free cookies and coffee?"
Morrison asked.

Campus celebrates Constitution Day
By ALISON SCHWARTZ
Alligator Contributing Writer
It's been a few years since the U.S. Con-
stitution was signed -222 to be exact.
But James Madison would have been
proud as UF celebrated the ratification of
the legendary document Thursday.
The UF Levin College of Law hosted
the UF Constitution Day Program, stream-
ing the presentation on the law school's
Web site for those not in attendance.
The program explored the polarizing
topic of U.S. immigration policy.
UF freshmen Paola Rodriguez and
Rocio Granela attended the presentation.
"We're both immigrants, so it's veryimportant to us," Granela said. "People
have a surface image, but you have to live
it personally to understand it."
UF law professor Juan Perea discussed
"The Devil's Highway," a book that fol-
lows the brutal journey of 26 South and
Central American immigrants.
"Some of the Consti-
On tution's most importantCampus phrases and clauses protect
persons, not just citizens,"
Perea said. "We should be celebrating im-
migrants. This has always been a nation of
immigrants."
Perea said immigration issues tie back
to the blurred lines of the Constitution.
"Everyone seems to agree that there issome kind of immigration problem, yet I
find it pretty hard to understand what that
problem really is," Perea said. "One of the
things that seems to be happening under
the Constitution is that there's a real lack
of clarity to the degree of rights undocu-
mented immigrants are entitled to."
The UF College Republicans tabled
on Turlington Plaza, handing out pocket
Constitutions to passing students.
Carly Wilson, UF sophomore and
vice chair of public relations for College
Republicans, estimated the organization
handed out about 175 Constitutions.
"It's a living, breathing document.
Anything that we're doing has its roots
within the Constitution," Wilson said.

HOUSE Saturday,
Free Beer
LiveBy DAVID TINTNER
Alligator Contributing Writer
Tennessee fans won't be
the only ones praying this
weekend.
People all over Gainesville
will be seesawing between
faith and football Saturday as
they choose between observ-
ing the Jewish new year and
watching the Gators host the
Volunteers in The Swamp.
"People always ask me,
should I [TiVo] services or re-
cord the game," joked Rabbi
Berl Goldman, co-director of
the Lubavitch Chabad Jewish
Center.
Goldman said he would
like for them to observe Rosh
Hashana, but it's possible to
get some football in as well
-Rosh Hashana services at
Chabad start at 10 a.m.
UF junior Adam Bernatsky
said the university should
have considered making Sat-
urday's face-off an evening
game.
"We have one of the larg-
est Jewish populations in the
nation," he said.
Bernatsky said he usu-
ally starts tailgating for big
games by 10 in the morning.
On Saturday, he will miss
most of the tailgating to go to
services and rush back beforethe game.
"It's annoying, but I'm
so excited for this game," he
said. "Nothing can ruin the
day -except a loss."
UF's schedule is set by
the Southeastern Conference
years in advance, said Greg
McGarity, executive associ-
ate director of the Univer-
sity Athletic Association, and
television networks deter-
mine the time of the game.
"We have one of
the largest Jewish
populations in the
nation."
Adam Bernatsky
UFjunior
"You basically have 13
weeks to schedule 12 games,"
he said. "You run into some
difficulty to avoid this date."
Gators fans are not the
only ones running into
scheduling conflicts with the
Jewish holidays this year.
According to the Associ-
ated Press, the New York Jets
complained to the NFL about
having consecutive home
football games scheduled on
Rosh Hashana and Yom Kip-
pur.
Despite the holiday, UF's
game against Tennessee is

University Athletic Associa-
tion.
Goldman thinks that this
Saturday's services will be
packed, as well.
"Our phones have been
ringing off the hook with
alumni calling to say they
are coming into town," he
said. "They're coming for the
game but still want to cel-
ebrate Rosh Hashana prop-
erly."
Goldman said that they
are expecting more than 600
people to attend services
and more than 1,000 to come
to Chabad throughout the
weekend.
Services are held in the
backyard of his house on
Northwest Fifth Avenue, and
they will be setting up a sec-
ond tent to accommodate the
crowd.
"We have the benefit of be-
ing five blocks from the stadi-
um," Goldman said. "We can
hear every announcement
and every touchdown."
Goldman said he won't be
watching the game but will
be praying for the Gators to
win.
"What better way to start
off the new year than to win
three games in a row?" he
said.

ou're all revved up and ready for your first real foot-
ball game of the season, and it's sure to be a good 'un.
We know you're already parked on the couch with
your Gators Snuggie and have your first pre-kickoff drink
in hand -and we're happy for you, and we're gonna let
you finish -but not before we present you with this week's
edition of last-week's-Darts-&-Laurels-was-one-of-the-best-
Darts-&-Laurels-of-all-time edition of.
Darts & Laurels
In case you missed the MTV Video Music Awards and
have avoided the latest Internet meme, that was a reference
to Kanye West insulting Taylor Swift on Sunday. West's log-
orrhea wasn't the only outburst to make headlines this week,
though. From Rep. Joe Wilson (R-SC) to Serena Williams,
we're sick of reading about people who can't keep their
mouths shut. For speaking out at inappropriate times, the
Department of Darts & Laurels would like to send a but-seri-
ously-Beyonc6's-video-was-better DART to sassy bitches.
Speaking of sassy bitches, UF officials have sent a cease-
and-desist notice to Ballyhoo Grill for its display of "Tim
Treebow," an artistic rendition of Tim Tebow that literally
makes his already massive neck into a log. National Colle-
giate Athletic Association rules dictate that no one can capi-
talize off a college player's name, but it's unlikely that people
are going to Ballyhoo's Grill specifically to pray at the feet -
or roots -of the wooden behemoth. For having a stick up
its proverbial ass, we'd like to send a wooden DART into the
shriveled, black heart of the NCAA.
While Ballyhoo Grill isn't making bank off of Tebow's
perfectly sculpted body, one girl shared at PostSecret cre-
ator Frank Warren's speech Tuesday night how she profited
from her dad's collection of adult magazines. For having the
gumption to sell her dad's Playboys for ice cream money,
we'd like to give a that-sure-beats-selling-lemonade LAU-
REL to little entrepreneur girl.
The girl probably couldn't get that much money from a
gaggle of middle school boys, but she probably raised more
than Wolf Blitzer on "Celebrity Jeopardy!" Thursday night.
Going into Final Jeopardy!, Wolfie was more than $4,000 in
the red and was given $1,000 just so he could compete in the
final round. For faking us out with the sense of authority he
displays as a TV newscaster, we'd like to send a we-thought-
you-were-smart DART at Blitzer.
We sometimes get angry at Alex Trebek's smugness (he
acts like he knows everything but really just reads off of a
card), but Blitzer is sure to infuriate us next time we hear him
read off a teleprompter on CNN.
Moving from wolves to coyotes, Jessica Simpson's pet
maltipoo was snatched by a wild coyote on Monday. For of-
fering a reward upon the return of her dog, we'd like to send
a LAUREL to Simpson for her unrelenting optimism. Maybe
the coyote really is reading her frantic Twitter updates.
But seriously, someone should tell her what happened.
Finally, four UF employees resigned this week after they
were accused of using UF purchasing cards to buy items for
personal use. For abusing the system when the university
is already in Budget Crisis 2K9, we'd like to send a looks-
like-you'll-have-all-the-time-in-the-world-to-learn-the-se-
ductive-art-of-belly-dancing-now DART at the fraudulent
four.
Obviously what they are accused of is wrong, but we can
only puzzle over the fact that the same person supposedly
owns "Sex and the City," "Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas"
and something called "Perfect Hips Belly Dance Workout."
That's all for this week. Go Treebow?

West outburst not worthy of attention
t began as any standard Sunday night would. I head-
ed over to a friend's house to grab some food, sip a
cold beer and watch "Entourage" with the boys.
As is usually the case, I was expecting Ari Gold to
provide me with the day's quota of arrogant, self-cen-
tered humor. But about an hour before Drama, E, Vince
and the rest of the crew graced my television with their
presence, I quickly learned that I was going to receive
an extra helping of a conceited, overbearing, superstar
talking just a little bit too much.
Yes, by now we all know that I am talking about none
other than Kanye West and his antics Sunday night at
the MTV Video Music Awards.
There is no need to recount the story, as we have all
inevitably heard about it from a friend or seen the clip
on YouTube. Or, like me, you were on Facebook right
after it happened, and every single one of your friends
posted an obligatory I-Hate-Kanye-West-and-Love-
Taylor-Swift status, along with an explanation of the
grave injustice he committed.
To be sure, President Barack Obama's description
of West as a "jackass" is certainly adept. And if his
drunken antics and blatant disregard for Swift's mo-
ment aren't enough to move you to tweet your support
for Swift and let everyone know you stand in solidar-
ity with her, this should. West interrupted "Entourage"
night. Simply unacceptable.
Joking aside, what is our obsession with this 30-sec-
ond sound bite?
Celebrities pull ridiculous stunts like this all the
time, and rarely do we pay homage to them with our
collective Facebook and Twitter statuses. And usually
CNN doesn't bother interviewing two "experts" (I wasKyle Robisch
Ietters@alligator orgunaware that one could be an ex-
pert on rappers yelling drunken
shenanigans in public) to report on
such issues.
West has certainly done dumber
things -remember when he falla-
ciously claimed to be the "voice of
this generation"?
Whatever the reason may be,
our ire is extremely misplaced. On the scale of injustice,
this falls somewhere in between shooting a spitball at
your little brother and forgetting to take out the trash
last night.
Yes, West was a pompous ass as usual, but why are
we up in arms about this minor outburst, yet larger is-
sues such as health care reform, poverty and war barely
register a tick on our radar? Hell, after Rep. Joe Wilson's
(R-SC) outburst during the president's health care ad-
dress, I counted maybe three Facebook statuses either
for or against it. The next day most students seemed un-
aware that it had even happened and didn't know who
Rep. Wilson was.
The fact is, we are Florida's brightest and best. A
little obsession with celebrity gossip is understandable
and probably even healthy. But the extent to which we
are possessed by an irrelevant rap star's diatribe at a B-
list award ceremony speaks to the fact that we need to
readjust our priorities and concerns.
There are bigger, more disconcerting transgressions
occurring in the world every single day. At least West
was drinking Hennessey and keeping it classy.

Jesus neither liberal nor conservative
In response to Paul Murty: Like most fair-
minded people, Jesus was both a liberal on
some issues and a conservative on others. He
felt a great drive to understand and help the
poor. He also spoke of his admiration and
respect for soldiers in service of their coun-
try. He tells us to "render unto Caesar what is
Caesar's and render unto God what is God's."
Here we can see a broad range of reasonable
views emphasized to different degrees by
both liberals and conservatives.
On the other hand, Jesus was not a social-
ist. He believed in the power of the individual
through faith in the Lord and in his fellow
man for positive change, not in the power of
an overbearing state. And Jesus was especially
not a communist, considering he did not be-
lieve in the bloody overthrow of the estab-
lished order, and considering that as he was
the son of God, he probably didn't think that
belief in a higher power was, as Marx put it,
the misguided 'opiate of the masses.
Considering how many Christians and
other people of faith were murdered for their
beliefs by socialists and communists in the last
century; calling Jesus either defies common
decency and common sense.

Gardasil necessary in an unideal world
I felt a responsibility to address the mis-
guided information given by Caitlin O'Conner
on human papillomavirus and Gardasil.
According to the Guttmacher Institute,
HPV is so common that it has been described
as a virtual "marker" for having had sex. TheCenters for Disease Control and Prevention
estimates that 20 million people are currently
infected with HPV and at least 50 percent of
sexually active individuals will acquire the vi-
rus at some point in their lives.
Yes, Gardisil protects against sexually
transmitted strains. However, HPV spreads
through genital-to-genital contact, which can
occur even without "having sex."
O'Conner thinks it's easy to prevent HPV
infection, presumably through abstinence
from the waist down. Even if a girl is complete-
ly abstinent until marriage, she has no way
to guarantee that her future husband had no
genital-to-genital contact with females before
her. She also has no guarantee that she won't
be date-raped or molested at some point in her
life. It is naive to suggest that it is "a new level
of wrong to vaccinate 11-year-olds." They are
vaccinated because they will most likely have
sex someday, and the key is to prevent infec-
tion before children become sexually active.
If the chicken pox vaccine is now required,
I think Gardasil should be too. Ideally, though,
women would educate themselves about
sexually transmitted infections and be more
realistic about their own sexual health before
denouncing a lifesaving vaccine.

Event to benefit historic house
By MARIA PIQUET
Alligator Contributing Writer
There's a somber view of a gray,
desolate house with a weakening
tin roof on Northwest Eighth Av-
enue.
The Smith-Griffin house stands
amidst throngs of weeds and trees
as a memory of a family's past
and as a reminder of the neighbor-
hood's history.
"We're trying to preserve his-
tory, and we need a place to put it,"
said Melanie Barr, the Smith-Griffin
House chairwoman and Pleasant
Street Historic Society correspond-
ing secretary.
"The best thing to do is have a
museum where people can donate
their artifacts."
In order to make a dent in the
$250,000 it will take to restore the
home, the Pleasant Street Historic
Society will host Rock the House,
a 1960s- and 1970s-themed benefit
with live music, food and people"We're all about downtown
revitalization, historic pres-
ervation and preserving the
history of the neighborhood,"
Melanie Barr
Smith-Griffin House chairwoman
dressed in tie-dye clothes.
The event will be held Sunday
at the Thelma Boltin Center, 516
NE Second Ave., from 7 to 10 p.m.
Tickets are $25.
Guests are encouraged to wear
bell-bottomed pants, tie-dyed shirts
and headbands. Mike Boulware
and the Boltin Bad Boys will play
songs from the 1960s and 1970s.
There will also be a silent auc-
tion with donations from down-
town restaurants, the downtown
Hampton Inn and the Magnolia
Plantation Bed and Breakfast Inn,
Barr said.
"We're all about downtown re-
vitalization, historic preservationand preserving the history of the
neighborhood," Barr said. "When
people's grandparents die, if you
didn't ask the right questions, your
history's gone. We don't want
that."
Built in the 1870s by the last resi-
dent's grandfather, the house was
home to the family until Claronelle
Smith-Griffin, the last descendant,
passed away in 2003.
In her will, Smith-Griffin donat-
ed the house to the Pleasant Street
Historic Society, an organization
that preserves the history of hous-
es in the area north of downtown
Gainesville, in hopes that it would
be turned into a black history ex-
hibit.
But before any restoration is
done, the society needs to raise
money.
The house can't be opened to the
public until central air, insulation,
new wiring, new plumbing and
a new roof are all installed, Barr
said.

Researchers at the University of Washington and

The team of researchers used a form of gene ther-
apy to restore color vision to a pair of squirrel mon-
keys, which are naturally colorblind from birth.

and one of the researchers who conducted the ex-

After 20 weeks of testing, the monkeys could sud-

However, Neitz has higher goals in mind.
"The whole reason we embarked on this adven-
ture was to cure all genetic disorders of the eye," he
said. "Clinical human trials are a long way down the
road. There are a lot of roadblocks to making sure
that the gene therapy is safe for humans."

SG parties debut platforms for fall elections
By CAROLYN TILLO
Alligator Writer
The Orange and Blue Party wants Student Government
to share the wealth.
Its party platform offers a plan for eliminating what it
identifies as wasteful spending in SG, including parking
decals and cell phone reimbursement plans given to SG
officials.
Policy and Communications Director Ben Cavataro
said his party wants SG money to be used on things like
the readership program, concerts and speeches, which
will benefit all students.
"I would say that the overarching theme is working for
students, not just ourselves," he said.
Cavataro said the platform features ideas for a scooter
repair shop similar to the bicycle repair shop located at the
Reitz Union.
o & B In addition, Cavataro said the Orange and
Party Blue Party favors switching from WebMail
to Gmail.
Students can keep the same e-mail ad-
dresses but use the Gmail interface, he said.
The Orange and Blue Party also advocates working
with the Reitz Union Board of Managers to provide more
affordable food options at the Reitz Union for students.
Orange and Blue Party President Kyle Huey said an-
other idea involves creating separate parking decals for
students who come to campus to use the gym.
The decals would be cheaper than normal parking de-
cals, Huey said.
He said his party differs from the others because it has
a proven track record of getting things done.The Progress Party doesn't want students to feel iso-
lated from the workings of Student Government.
Progress Party President Dave Schneider said he sym-
pathized with students who chose not to vote in previous
elections because they didn't know about the issues their
senators advocated.
"That is a moment where I feel alienated by the pro-
cess, and I feel very alienated by the system," he said.
Schneider said the entire Progress Party has signed
waivers allowing its voting records to be released online,
so students can know more about the decisions the party's
elected officials are making.
Those running during the fall election plan to sign sim-
ilar pledges next week, he said.
Schneider said the party platform advocates online
voting, which would save money during aProgress time of budget cuts and make it easier forParty students to vote.
The party platform also disagrees with
the need to use $15,500 to hire a consulting firm intended
to conduct research for SG projects.
Instead, the party favors bringing in public relations
and business administration students to accomplish the
same goal.
The Progress Party also hopes to add more paper recy-
cling bins to Turlington Plaza to keep up with the heavy
traffic of students, according to the platform. The party
also hopes to work with engineering students to create a
more efficient campus sprinkler system.
He said SG has been seen up to this point as an under-
graduate resume-builder.The Unite Party wants to hear what students have to
say.
Jason Yoepp, Unite Party spokesman, said the party
plans to increase the number of comment boxes available
around campus and add new comment boxes to off-cam-
pus apartments.
Party officials will collect the suggestions and review
them every two to four weeks, Yoepp said.
The Unite Party is also hoping to gain student input on
the creation of a new, more modern student union, Yoepp
said.
"We want to make sure this is more catered to what stu-
dents want than what Aramark or the university wants,"
he said.
The new union could be constructed with-
in the next couple of years, and $15,500 fromUnite the budget will be used to hire a consultingParty firm to help poll students and find out what
students want the new building to look like,
Yoepp said.
He said the Unite Party is also concerned with issues of
health and safety. It plans to improve the lighting at Re-
gional Transit System bus stops and add more emergency
call boxes around campus, especially after Gainesville's
recent increase in crime.
Feedback from students remains one of its top priori-
ties, however.
"A lot of students feel Student Government is not ap-proachable," Yoepp said. "But, with respect, a lot of stu-
dents never take a moment to say to their Student Govern-
ment, 'Hey, here's what I want to do."'

RESEARCH
UF scientists develop camera to study black holes
By MOLLY LARMIE
Alligator Contributing Writer
Black holes can't be seen with
the human eye, but the UF Depart-
ment of Astronomy is looking any-
way.
After seven years of construc-
tion, UF has designed the Flamin-
gos-2 camera and spectrometer.
The device produced its first imag-
es of space at the Gemini South tele-
scope, located on Chile's 9,000-foot-
tall Cerro Pachon mountain.Last Thursday and Friday, Fla-
mingos-2, which stands for Florida
Multi-object Infrared Grism Ob-
serving Spectrograph, captured im-
ages of the Milky Way galaxy, team
leader and UF astronomy professor
Stephen Eikenberry said.
Once it is sufficiently tested,
Flamingos-2 will operate in near-
infrared light just beyond the
human-eye range to study black
holes, Eikenberry said.
"In the center of the Milky Way,
there is a super massive black hole
that is 5 million times the mass of"In the center of the Milky
Way, there is a super mas-
sive black hole that is 5
million times the mass of
the sun."
Stephen Eikenberry
UF astronomy professor
the sun," he said. "There are hun-
dreds of smaller black holes, too."
Eikenberry said the Flamingos-2
will also collect images of older,smaller galaxies that formed in the
early stages of the universe to get a
better understanding of the forma-
tion of larger galaxies, such as the
Milky Way.
"If you look far away in the uni-
verse, you are also looking far back
in time," he said.
Design and construction of Fla-
mingos-2 cost $5 million, most of
which was provided by funds from
the federal government, Eikenber-
ry said.
The project involved more than
30 UF scientists, engineers, stu-dents and staff.
Because Gemini South is one of
the world's largest and most sought
after telescopes, observatory time
is difficult to secure, Eikenberry
said. But the instrument's presence
in Chile will ensure UF at least 30
nights of observation per year.
Eikenberry added that Flamin-
gos-2 joins another UF instrument
at Gemini South: the T-RECS mid-
infrared camera.
The T-RECS camera is used
to view cooler objects like young
forming stars and planets.
Faculty voice concerns about ending sick leave payouts
* ENDING PAYOUTS COULD SAVE
$2 MILLION TO $4 MILLION FOR UF.
UF faculty expressed their concern over the
proposal to end sick leave payouts in response
to budget cuts at Thursday's Faculty Senate
meeting.
Currently, faculty can convert unused sick
leave into paychecks when they leave UF, but
the proposed policy would end that practiceas of Jan. 1, 2012, said UF provost Joe Glover.
Tom Auxter, a faculty senator, called the
proposal "shocking."
"They would like to collect the tiny benefit
you get after being $20,000 behind your coun-
terparts at other universities," Auxter said.
UF plans to cut $16.6 million from its bud-
get this year, and officials predict the move
could save between $2 million and $4 million.
The proposal seems like a fair way for fac-ulty to help with UF's budget troubles, Glover
said.
"It seems like everybody would contribute
a little bit to closing the budget gap," he said.
Glover also an-
U F nounced details ofAdministration two other proposals
at the meeting.
Under one plan, UF would standardize
the pay rate for summer classes to $5,000 for athree-credit-hour class. Deans could raise the
amount if necessary, he said.
Under another plan, UF would offer vol-
untary retirement plans to employees 65 and
older. They would have to decide by January
and leave UF by the end of June, he said.
Those who choose this option would re-
ceive one year of salary in return. It's unclear
how much this program could save UF.

HOMELESS, from page 1
moving to the streets.
One organization at the fair offered free legal consulta-
tion.
Daniel Kahn, a lawyer for Three Rivers Legal Services,
Inc., helps the homeless with legal issues involving income
and assets, contracts and disability.
Kahn believes Gaineville's active homelessness advocacy
is due to its "passionate and progressive social sentiments
combined with its strong emphasis on economic growth."
Michelle Zukarfein has been homeless for many years
and said the fair's services are helpful, but they
Local won't solve Gainesville's homeless problem.
News "The city's main problem, however, is afford-
able housing," Zukarfein said.
Most advocates and fairgoers echoed her con-
cern -the city's shelters only offer 400 beds to accommodate
the 1,600 homeless, including more than 500 children.
"We are trying to solve a national issue with a local bud-
get," DeCarmine said.
The fair also offered health screenings and health care re-
ferrals, basic pet care and food, counseling and victim ser-
vices, food stamp registration and free blankets and hygiene
supplies.
Tom McCament, a homeless man who spends his after-
noons praying for families and children on the streets, said
he hoped the event fostered more community involvement
with the homeless.
"With more unity, it could all change in the blink of an
eye," he said.
Miller: Bill will help Fla. school system
FUNDING,from page 1
ference call. "It's fiscally responsible and the
best investment we can make in our nation's
future."
George Miller, a democrat from California
who serves as the chairman of the Committee
on Education and Labor, said the bill was a re-
sult of a strong bipartisan effort and support
from banks -an unlikely suitor considering
the revenue they anticipate losing when bank
loans switch to Federal Direct Loans.
"At the end of the day, the banks just
couldn't justify $8 billion to $10 billion of
profit for a product [bank loans] that wasn't
superior," said Miller, who believes the bill
will have no trouble passing through the Sen-
ate. "They did what they thought would be
best for students and their families."
Critics of the bill say it will stifle competi-
tion, place a burden on the middle-class tax-payers and cripple banks that rely on student
loan interest payments.
The bill's supporters argue that the flow
of finances into the American system will ac-
tually save taxpayers money by cutting out
government subsidies toward the banks that
make the loans.
Millerbriefly addressed
specific examples of states
that are taking scalpels to
educational programs in
an effort to save money.
In regard to Florida's situ-
ation, he said new pro-
Pelosi grams made possible by
the bill will help strength-
en state institutions while alleviating tuition
costs, which have increased in the past year.
However, Miller was quick to point out that
the programs will not be simply handouts.
"Governors are going to have to compete
to make sure they get these funds," he said.Night games best for business
ECONOMY, from page 1
According to Blair, national studies
show the impact game days have on the
economy is not as significant as people
think.
Blair said a large portion of the mon-
ey spent ends up leaving the local area.
"Say you fill up your tank with gas
for $3 a gallon," he said. "The guy who
owns the station paid $2.90 for it, and
that money goes back to Jacksonville or
wherever it came from."
However, because Gainesville is so
small, all businesses are still better off
on game days, Blair said."People are milling around, walk-
ing around, buying souvenirs, going to
lunch and having a great time," he said.
"Clearly people are spending money."
"If 60,000 people go into New York,
it doesn't make a dent," he said. "But in
Gainesville the percentage increase in
population is enormous."
For the Gator Shop and most other
stores, night games are the best, Bass
said. Big games, rivalry games and es-
pecially the Florida State University
game are always huge moneymakers,
too.
Without fail, game days are always
successful -even when the Gators are
not doing well, Bass said.

UF VOLLEYBALL
Gators to open SEC play
By ANTHONY CHIANG
Alligator Writer
achiang@alligator org
Before their last match against No. 3
Washington, coach Mary Wise said the
Gators aren't used to playing as the un-
derdog as they did in a loss to the Hus-
kies.
That unusual circumstance was short-
lived as UF heads into league play shoot-
ing for its 19th straight conference title.
No. 5 Florida (6-1) will look to con-
tinue its dominance of the Southeastern
Conference tonight as it will begin league
play on the road against Ole Miss (6-4) at
8 p.m. before facing Arkansas (6-5) at 2
p.m. Sunday.
After a tough nonconference schedule
that featured three ranked opponents,
the Gators view league play as a chance
to start fresh.
"This weekend, everybody starts on
common ground, we are all 0-0," coach
Mary Wise said. "Before, any win just
bettered the league. Now, you have to
hunker down and just take care of your
own."
The Gators will continue their lon-
gest road trip since 2003 and play their
first two conference matches away from
Gainesville for the first time in three
years.
Tonight's road match against the Reb-
els might prove to be one of the tougher
ones they will see in the SEC, not only be-cause of Ole Miss' scrappy nature, but in
large part because of the unusual venue
they will play in. The volleyball court at
the Gillom Sports Center is located at the
end of a field house and has very little
room to chase down balls.
"It's a pretty unique place to play in,"
senior libero Elyse Cusack said. "It's a
small facility and it can get super loud.
You just have to keep the communication
up and try to calm the crowd down."
As if that didn't pose enough of an
obstacle already, UF will be sure to get
Wisethe best effort from Ole
Miss or any other SEC
team they face.
"Winning 18 straight
conference titles is a big
deal, and we know that
we are going to get ev-
ery team's best shot on
the road," Cusack said.
But if history repeats itself, the Gators
will have a successful weekend. The
team has won its first two games against
SEC opponents in 10 of the last 11 sea-
sons and has won all 18 league openers
under Wise.
While UF may have already faced the
toughest opponents on its schedule, the
team will have to overcome another ob-
stacle in the SEC.
"The difference in league play is there
are no secrets," Wise said. "That target
on our back hasn't gotten any smaller,
but that's what we've become used to."Recruiting'

went on an official visit to Tallahas-
see last year. If things went differently,
she might be sporting garnet and gold
when No. 7 Florida (5-2-0) hosts No. 5
FSU (6-1-0) at 7 p.m.
Maybe not.
"I didn't like (Tallahassee) as much
as here, and I didn't like the colors that
much," Bala said.
Bala is one of many players who
chose between the Gators and the Semi-
noles as high school seniors.
"We're looking at the same play-
ers. .Florida gets some of the kids; we
get some of the kids," FSU coach Mark
Krikorian said.
For those players, the annual rivalry
lets them prove they made the right
choice, and Krikorian suggested that as-
pect fuels the fire.
Krikorian came to FSU in 2005, and
the Seminoles have been the state's pre-
mier team since.
Florida State reached the College Cup
three of the last four years, including a
national championship game appear-
ance in 2007. During that same stretch,
coach Becky Burleigh's squad has not
advanced past the round of 16.fuels rivalry
However, the Gators hold the upper
hand in head-to-head matchups. Flor-
ida's seniors are 2-1 against the Semi-
noles, with every match decided by one
goal.
Burleigh said the FSU game is typi-
cally more physical, something she
likes.
"It's a fun game to play. It's why
people come to UF -to play rivalry
games," Burleigh said.
Perhaps the Gator most anxious for
kickoff is senior Angela Napolitano,
who was tackled hard by an FSU player
in the 85th minute and hyperextended
her knee last year. The in-
jury kept Napolitano out
of practice for a week.
"I'm ready to play aSoccer full game against them,"
she said.
Last year, a shutout from goalkeeper
Katie Fraine and an early goal from Tah-
nai Annis gave Florida a 1-0 victory.
The year before, then-senior KeLeigh
Hudson's 83rd-minute goal helped the
Gators steal a 2-1 win.
In 2006, the Seminoles won at home
1-0 front of more than 4,000 fans -3,000
above their stadium's listed capacity.
Like this year, FSU was the higher-
ranked team in those games, but Napoli-
tano said that never matters.
"When it's a rivalry like this, rank-
ings go out the door. Those things don't
matter because everyone plays their best
game."

Few college football programs have
as polarizing of an effect as the mighty
Pirates of East Carolina. It's no surprise,
then, that the ECU-UNC contest pro-
duced a five-five split in the votes this
week.
We left it up to Mike McCall, lover
of all things Purple and Gold, and Mike
DiFerdinando, hater of all that is good,
to settle the debate in the alligatorSports
Brand Picks Column.
WHY UNC WILL COVER TH E SPREAD.
After all these years, McCall is still
clinging to some disillusioned notion
that ECU football is relevant and
legitimate.
It's OK, Mike. I know you bleed Pur-
ple and Gold.
But that doesn't change the fact that
the only thing more pathetic than your
beloved Pirates in the city of Greenville
(and I use the term city loosely) is the
mediocre chicken restaurant that you
so desperately defend.
Just like Bojangles, ECU is average
at best. Butch Davis and Greg Little
should have no problem putting away
a team that plays in a conference whose
main TV contract is with CSTV.
The only thing more ridiculous than
the notion that East Carolina Teachers
Training School (as it was originally
known) has a chance against UNC is
the Pirates' earring-wearing mascot.
-MIKE DiFERDINANDO
WHY ECU WILL COVER THE 7.5-POINT
SPREAD. There are only two things
that make Mike DiFerdinando happy:
listening to Anthony Bourdain ramble
and making people miserable.
He routinely leaves the pressbox
to go running through the stands and
knock ice cream out of the hands of
children.
He eats at Panda Express, which
means he's eating your lost pets.
Once a week, he sells counterfeit
tickets to hospital patients, then takes
the cash downtown and lights it on fire
in front of homeless people.

Running back Emmanuel Moody is still
working to regain his coaches' full trust after
turning over the ball last week.The junior coughed up the ball on his first
carry against Troy and didn't touch the ball
the rest of the game.
"I don't know where he stands in his mind-

UF running back Emmanuel Moody fumbles the ball on his only carry of the Gators' 56-6
win against Troy in The Swamp on Sept. 12."We have things that we do to take care of
that when they do fumble. He knows why he
fumbled, that's the No. 1 thing."
Now, Moody has to fight to get back into a
rotation with two other talented backs, soph-
omores Jeff Demps and Chris Rainey. Moody
was second on the team in rushing -nine
carries for 86 yards -in Florida's opener.
"He has to get himself in a position where
he earns our trust again and he will," Carter
said. "Unfortunately those
things happen, but there's a
price to pay for it.
"You're always going to
Football hang on that one time when a
guy fumbles. You have to con-
tinue to be diligent in practice
and prove that it was an accident."
DEBOSE HAS SURGERY: Wide receiver Andre
Debose underwent successful surgery Thurs-
day to repair a torn hamstring tendon in his
left thigh. Full recovery is expected to take
four to six months.
Coach Urban Meyer said he gave his
prized recruit the same speech he gives to all
players dealing with a serious injury.
"It's not the injury to the athlete that mat-
ters, it's the reaction to the injury," Meyer
said. "We don't have a player on the team
that's not been banged up or hurt. That's part
of the game. It's the reaction. If you go in the
tank, fall behind in school, act like you're
miserable, don't take advantage of an oppor-
tunity to get bigger and stronger, that's the
reaction."
Meyer, Gators fans should heed Timberlake's advice
s contemporary poet Justin Timber-lake once sang, "What goes around
comes around / You should know
that.
"Don't want to think about it (no) / Don't
want to talk about it."
While I'm sure JT's muse was some girl who
did him wrong in the past, he might as well
have been talking directly to Florida coach Ur-
ban Meyer and the thousands of bloodthirsty
Gators fans who will be on hand to witness
what will likely be a public shaming of the Vol-
unteers and coach Lane Kiffin on Saturday.
Much like Timberlake, Meyer doesn't want
to think about it (no) and certainly doesn't want
to talk about it, but eventually, some of these ri-
valry games have to start going the other way.
Meyer was asked if he thinks the balance of
rivalries tends to be cyclical in nature, and if he
is at all surprised by the resounding success he
has had against Tennessee, Georgia and Florida
State during his time in Orange and Blue.
His response was that of a man without kar-
ma on his mind.
"You're asking a lot of questions I don't
think about," Meyer said.
And who could blame him?Since taking over asrehead coach at Florida,
Meyer has gone 11-1
against UF's three rival
schools, with the only
loss coming against
Kyle Maistri Georgia in 2007.
Kyle Points The Gators' 2007 59-
k yalestri@aIIigator org 20 drubbing of the Vol-
unteers was Florida's
biggest win in the ri-
valry. Last season's 49-10 beatdown of Georgia
was the worst loss of coach Mark Richt's career
and the second biggest margin of victory for UF
in the series' history. And the Gators have dis-
mantled the Seminoles by a combined score of
90-27 in the last two meetings.
With that recent success, I doubt that any UF
fans are thinking about what might come back
around over the next couple of years.
It would be foolish to think the Vols, 'Dawgs
and 'Noles will all be down for any significant
amount of time, so Florida fans should enjoy
Meyer calling timeouts at the end of last year's
Florida-Georgia game and whatever comes
about in Saturday's second half in retaliation
for Kiffin's offseason behavior.Without question, this is the best time in his-
tory to be a Gators fan, but who knows what
will happen after Tim Tebow and Brandon
Spikes leave Gainesville.
This must be how fans felt about UCLA bas-
ketball in the '70s, Miami football in the '80s and
Duke basketball in the '90s. When you're sitting
on top of the mountain, it's hard to imagine the
long tumble down to the bottom of the slope
and the tough climb back to the peak.
For at least the rest of this season, however,
Meyer and UF fans have little to worry about.
The Gators will, in my opinion, sweep their
rivals and cruise through their schedule, yet
again finding themselves as one of two teams
selected by the BCS to play for a national title.
But one day, it won't be that way.
And if Meyer is still around, he will be
forced to think about the days when games
against Tennessee, Georgia and FSU were noth-
ing more than an opportunity for fans to make
a killing on betting Florida to cover.
Whenever that time comes, you, the fan, will
still be here even if Meyer has since departed.
So act respectfully toward your fallen foes
this season, because karma's a female dog (and
so is my editor's Puritan censorship).

UF CROSS COUNTRY
Gators look to win opener for fifth straight year
By JESSICA ETTER
Alligator Writer
For the past four years, the men's
and women's cross country teams
have won their first meet, and this
year looks to be no different.
After placing 17th at the NCAA
Championship in November, the
No. 14 UF women's cross country
team begins the season tonight at
the Mountain Dew Invitational.
"Of course there are some ex-
pectations on the women's team,"coach Todd Morgan said. "But we
haven't even done anything yet.
We haven't even run one race."
Sophomore Genevieve LaCaze,
who won the invitational last year,
said the new freshmen and gradu-
ate student Stacey Johnson have
added a new level to the women's
team.
"We know deep down that
we have a truly great team," said
LaCaze, the 2008 SEC Freshman of
the Year. "We have many returning
athletes and a couple great new ad-
ditions to the team."While many of the women re-
turned this season, the unranked
men's team,
which missed the
cut for the NCAA
Championship
last season, will
run in its first
meet without All-
American Jeremy
Morgan Criscione, who
used his fourth
year of cross country eligibility last
season.
Even though there are 12 under-classmen on the men's roster, se-
nior Justin Taylor said some of the
athletes are stepping up to fill the
shoes of Criscione.
"The older guys on the team
are trying to set examples for the
younger ones," Taylor said. "For
the last two years, we have been the
first team out of the race to nation-
als, and it has been devastating. We
sat down with the freshmen last
week and told them all of this."
Before the UF teams run, high
school students from Florida will
run 5,000 meters beginning at 4:30p.m.
Morgan said having high school
runners at the meet will allow the
teenagers to see what cross country
is like at the next level.
The women's team will run its
5K at 6:30 tonight, and the men's
team will run its 8K at 7 at the Mark
Bostick Golf Course.
"It's our first meet, and it will be
a good way to kick the season off,"
Morgan said. "This meet is defi-
nitely going to affect my decision
on who I will run in two weeks at
Notre Dame."
No. 9 UF men face talented field in season's first tourney
Florida lost three-time All-American Horschel
By KELSIE HOECHERL
Alligator Writer
The UF men's golf team will open its sea-
son in Olympia Fields, Ill., this weekend at
the Olympia Fields Country Club/Fighting
Illini Invitational.
"Being the first tournament of the year, I
think that everyone is excited and ready to
go," senior Tyson Alexander said. "I think
we're starting a little later than we did last
year, and so everyone is a little bit more anx-
ious. I really don't have any expectations
[about how we will perform]. We lost BillyHorschel, who was a first team All-American
three years, and now we have no one that's
pretty proven like that. I'm just kinda going
in with no expectations and seeing how we
stack up at the end of the tournament."
Alexander will be teeing off for the
Gators, joined by senior Tim McKenney,
juniors Andres Echavarria and Bank Vong-
vanij and sophomore Max Kieffer in the
starting lineup.
Coach Buddy Alexander determined
which five players would represent UF in
the first tournament after the players shot
seven qualifying rounds.Five of the 11 players on the Gators' ros-
ter are underclassmen, with three freshmen
and two sophomores, but age is not neces-
sarily an indicator of talent.
"They bring a lot to the ta-
ble. They are really talented.
Going into this first qualifier,
I don't think anyone knew
Golf who was going to qualify. It's
that wide open, and it will be
until we get down to the end of the year,"
Alexander said. "We have the five that we
are going with this week and next week it
could be a totally different five; that's howgolf works, and that's how young people
work. Sometimes they're good one week
and inconsistent [the next]. We'll just have to
find our best five and keep getting better."
No. 9 Florida will face stiff competition
from a field featuring seven of the preseason
top 12, including No. 1 Oklahoma State, No.
3 Georgia and No. 5 Stanford.
"Golf is an individual sport wrapped in
a team concept in college, so they all want
to beat each other but they also realize that
they are all teammates and they support
each other," assistant coach Steve Bradley
said. "There's no doubt in my mind that
they all wanted to beat each other while they
were out there."

And he insults my beloved Pirates and favorite restaurant
in the hopes that I'll spend my nights the same way he does,
crying into a pillow.
But it won't work, because ECU is going to Paint it Purple
this weekend in Chapel Hill.
By that, I don't mean win, but I do mean lose by a touch-
down or less.
I have a sixth sense for how much the Pirates will lose by
(last week I bet them to lose by 15 or more to West Virginia, and
they lost by 15), and this game will be close, just as ECU's 34-31
win over the Tar Heels in 2007 was. -MIKE McCALL
Editor's Note: DiFer agreed a month ago to accompany Mr.
McCall to a Thursday night ECU game in November.
Now, on to the picks!
In first with an 11-9 record is Mike "I've got something in
my front pocket" DiFerdinando, who in a stunning departure
from his Butters-like self, tried to make his father pay to park at
his house for a game despite the fact that his pops pays the rent.
You're grounded, mister!
Tied for first with an 11-9 record is the Miami Herald's Joe
"You look like Jodie Foster" Goodman, who will be celebrating
an anniversary Saturday: two years of avoiding getting bashed
in the face on back-to-back Fridays and showing up to gameswith a busted nose.
Sitting in a tie for third at 9-11 is Bobby "Skeets" Callovi,
who got to see how grown-ups live for a few hours Thursday
after his girlfriend lent him her car. No doubt he returned it
full of empty juice boxes and half-chewed McDonald's Happy
Meal toys.
Also tied for third at 9-11 is Mike "Yeezy did what now?"
McCall, who is too cool to know what is going on with any-
thing on MTV yet can name and recite character traits for all
eight of Jon and Kate's kids.
Beginning the three-way tie for fifth at 8-12 is Kyle "Mike
Piazza's just in touch with his emotions" Maistri, who doesn't
often find himself speechless, but Jeff Demps interviews al-
ways do the trick, when he closes his eyes and dreams he's on
a 75-yard piggy-back ride.
Also tied at 8-12 is the Orlando Sentinel's Jeremy "Please
call Lane Kiffin a bozo" Fowler, who would give all the trendy
golf shirts in his wardrobe for 15 minutes alone with Andre
Debose's hamstring.
Also at 8-12 is the Florida Times-Union's Mike "The Zooker
gets a bad rap" DiRocco, whose blog, "Piece of Di Roc," hasn't
been updated since Dec. 1. It's not his fault, though. Grandpar-
ents are never good with computers.
Starting the three-way tie for last at 7-13 is the Gainesville
Sun's Ed "My uncle's in town, I can't work" Aschoff, who car-
ries a jar of Vaseline and a pocket pack of tissues just in case
Urban Meyer singles out Adrian Bushell for his special teamsefforts.
Tied for last place at 7-13 is Phil "Not in my paper" Kegler,
who believes our readership can handle nothing more vulgar
than language he would use around the Pope.
In dead last place -thanks to the alphabet -with a piss-
poor record of 7-13 is the Palm Beach Post's Ben "OGIO till I
die" Volin, who spent the week in Knoxville chasing Lane Kif-
fin and taking his sexual frustrations out on various livestock.

UF quarterback Tim Tebow will try to become only the third SEC quarterback to go
4-0 against Tennessee. Former Gator Danny Wuerffel also accomplished the feat.Tebow looks to go 4-0
* THE SENIOR STARTED HIS LEGACY
AGAINST THE VOLUNTEERS IN 2006.
By BOBBY CALLOVI
Alligator Staff Writer
bcallovi@alligator org
Just less than eight minutes remaining,
down 20-14 at Tennessee facing fourth-
and-1 on Tennessee's 28-yard line, and
Florida coach Urban Meyer calls a timeout
to discuss what to do.
But there was no doubt in his mind
what he was going to call. Meyer would
send in his then-freshman quarterback to
run the ball with the game on the line.
"There was really no hesitation. When
I said it over the headset, it wasn't, 'Hey,
whoa, whoa, whoa,' and sometimes that
happens, but it was just an unbelievable
moment for Florida football," Meyer said.
That's how quarterback Tim Tebow's
now-legendary career began, with a
2-yard rush to pick up the first down late
in the game in front of a packed Neyland
Stadium back in 2006.
The Gators finished off the drive with
the game-winning touchdown and left
Knoxville with a 21-20 victory on their
way to the BCS national championship.
Since then, Tebow and the Gators have
not had any problems with the Volunteers,
handily beating them in the next two meet-
ings 59-20 in 2007 and 30-6 in 2008. Tebow
had a very successful 2007 outing, throw-
ing for 299 yards and two touchdowns
and one interception 14 of 19 for 299 yards
and rushing for 61 yards and two touch-downs.
He didn't have to do much last year,
completing 8 of 15 throws for 96 yards and
two touchdowns while adding 26 yards on
12 rushes.
The senior signal caller will look to fin-
ish his career unbeaten against the Vols on
Saturday in The Swamp. He would join
former Gator Danny Wuerffel and former
Alabama quarterback Jay Barker as the
only Southeastern Conference quarter-
backs to go 4-0 against the Volunteers in
their career.
"It's been a big game (to me) ever since I
was 5,6 years old, watching (Peyton) Man-
ning and (Danny) Wuerffel and all those
guys play in this game," Tebow said. "To
finish off undefeated would be special."
There has been no question in anyone's
mind whose hands the ball would be in
when the Gators were facing any type
of short-yardage situation ever since his
emergence in his first game against Ten-
nessee.
The 2-yard run was just a glimpse of
what was to come from Tebow in the fu-
ture.
"It was one of the beginnings to see
what he was like in clutch situations,"
Meyer said. "That was the first real one he
was in where he had to go make the play
to help us win the game, and he did."
Tebow has not disappointed, playing
his way to a Heisman Trophy in 2007 and
leading UF to its second national champi-
onship in three years last season.
It all started with a fourth-and-i run in
Knoxville.
He hasn't look backed since.
