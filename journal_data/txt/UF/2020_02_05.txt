FIFTH PRESIDENT ON MONDAY
By AJ Bafer
Alligator Contributing Writer
When Paul Broadie II started his new job 
Monday as the Santa Fe College president, he 
said he felt like he was home when he was 
greeted by the university community. 
He is the college’s ﬁ  rst black president and 
only the ﬁ  fth to lead the college since 1966. He 
succeeded the now-retired Jackson Sasser.
Broadie said he plans to spend the ﬁ  rst 100 
days listening, learning and leading. He said 
he will work with faculty to look at enrollment 
strategies and see if there is any additional 
programming that can be brought to the college 
that could further meet its needs.
“Santa Fe College is an amazing place, and 
I’m honored to be there,” Broadie said. “I look 
forward to working with our faculty, our staff 
and our students to take the college to even 
greater heights.”
His ﬁ  rst major focus will be on the 
college’s new Blount campus, he said. Located 
downtown, Broadie said it will offer full services 
THE COMMISSION 
ADDRESSED CONCERNS 
ABOUT RESTORING VOTING 
RIGHTS 
By Grethel Aguila
Alligator Staff Writer
Cherey Daniels, a 60-year-old ex-
felon and Alachua County resident, 
is unsure if she can vote in upcoming 
elections. 
Daniels had her civil rights 
restored in 2005. However, she still 
owes the state $15,000 in restitution, 
money she’s obligated to pay for 
serving time in a correctional facility. 
Even 17 years after her release 
from prison, she said she can’t afford 
to pay that fee.
“I don’t want to check that 
box, because I can get in trouble,” 
Daniels said, referring to the part of 
the voter registration form that asks 
about felony status. If an ex-felon 
checks that box and owes fees, it is considered a violation of the law.
Daniels is not alone. Ex-
felons from across Florida have 
continuously experienced challenges 
when registering to vote. 
The Alachua County Commission 
discussed the restoration of voting 
rights Tuesday for people like Daniels 
at its special meeting. It unanimously 
passed a motion that will address 
concerns about restoration.
The motion focused on revising 
fees, listing ex-felons eligible to vote 
in Alachua County, partnering with 
public defenders, exploring other 
counties’ actions and community 
outreach.
In November 2018, Florida voters 
passed Amendment 4, which restored 
felons’ voting rights. It allowed 1.4 
million ex-felons to become eligible 
to vote the following January and 
excluded those convicted for murder 
and sexual offenses. By Hannah Phillips

After winning a battle for 
relief on fees, Graduate Assis-
tants United is demanding that 
UF uphold its end of the bar-
gain. 
GAU, a labor union, and the 
UF Board of Trustees agreed 
in August that the university 
would pay for all graduate as-
sistants’ transportation and 
health fees. The agreement was 
supposed to begin Jan. 1 but 
has yet to take effect.  
As a result, the union ﬁ  led 
a grievance with the university 
on behalf of its entire chapter 
Thursday. It asserts that the 
university has violated the col-
lective bargaining agreement by withholding the fee relief 
and failing to provide a date 
by which it will be distribut-
ed, said Stephen Phillips, the 
union’s spokesperson.  
UF’s chief bargainer Bill 
Connellan said the delay is due 
to a technical difﬁ  culty within 
the university bursar. Once the 
issue is resolved, the grievance 
will be invalid, he said.
“It is absolutely not true 
that we violated the contract,” 
Connellan said. “We agreed to 
it, we’re doing it — there was 
a technical difﬁ  culty in imple-
menting, and it’s being ﬁ  xed.” 
Connellan wouldn’t discuss 
the nature of the technical dif-
ﬁ  culty, nor does he know when 
it will be solved.  “I’ve been telling the union 
repeatedly: they [the bursar] 
are working to solve the issue,” 
he said. 
Because the university has 
yet to cover the fees, graduate 
assistants with ﬁ  nancial aid 
saw the cost of the fees deduct-
ed from their loans, Phillips 
said. GAU is asking that those 
students be reimbursed.
The initial agreement was a 
major victory for graduate as-
sistants and is the ﬁ  rst of its 
kind in Florida, Phillips said. 
Once implemented, it will 
amount to a yearly savings of 
around $606 for the average as-
sistant.

paid a lot of money to begin with,” he said. “This is some-
thing that’s really important to us.”
Jonathan J. Chiarella, a 33-year-old graduate assistant 
and organizing chair of GAU, said the burden of graduate 
assistant fees is one he feels every day. 
The salary he makes means choosing between visiting 
his family and paying his fees, he said. The car he drives is 
in need of major repairs; for now, he rides his bike.
“There are certain things my peers have done by this 
time,” Chiarella said. “I have friends who’ve settled into 
places with a career and home with a mortgage, a family.” 
Chiarella said he can’t plan or save for those kinds of milestones between his studies and duties as a 
graduate assistant, which he spends about 55 
to 60 hours a week on. 
The promised fee relief would make a dif-
ference, he said. Without it, even small pur-
chases such as new clothes or dishes are sac-
riﬁ  ced to cover the cost of his assistantship. 
“I know wearing pants with holes in them 
might be fashionable, but if I have holes in 
my pants, it’s because I bought them like ﬁ  ve 
years ago,” he said.

Members of Graduate Assistants United met with UF’s chief 
bargainer, Bill Connellan, over ﬁ  ve months in 2019 to negotiate the 
terms of their contract. The agreement to waive transportation and 
health fees for graduate assistants was the ﬁ  rst of its kind in Florida, 
said Stephen Phillips, the union’s spokesperson.
GAU,  from pg. 1The agreement was supposed to begin Jan. 1
such as academic advising and counseling, 
which will have a profound impact on east 
Gainesville.
Broadie has been in higher education 
for more than 30 years, where he gained 
experience in academic affairs, student 
affairs and professional education, he said. 
Before becoming Santa Fe’s president, 
he was among the ﬁ  rst in Connecticut to 
oversee two independently accredited 
colleges, Housatonic Community College 
in 2015 and then Gateway Community 
College in 2017.
Broadie earned a bachelor’s degree 
in business administration from Mercy 
College, a master’s degree in business 
administration from Long Island University 
and a doctoral degree in educational 
leadership and human resource studies 
from Colorado State University.
Broadie said he learned of Santa Fe when 
it won the Aspen Prize for Community 
College Excellence in 2015 with national 
recognition. He said the college ﬁ  ts his 
beliefs with its unwavering commitment to 
student success and the community.Tom Mallini, a Santa 
Fe College board trustee, 
said that Broadie 
immediately stood out 
in the selection process 
for the college’s next 
president. He said 
Broadie’s career was 
unique, referencing how 
he had been elevated 
to president at two community colleges 
simultaneously.
Broadie already presented himself 
presidentially by addressing economic 
inequality in Alachua County through 
supporting the educational outreach efforts 
of the East Gainesville Initative Program, 
Mallini said. 
Mallini said Broadie will thrive working 
with ofﬁ  cials and the state legislature in 
Tallahassee, as well as within the college 
itself.
“He will do an excellent job representing 
Santa Fe College,” he said. “The way he 
presents himself is very eloquent [and] 
well-spoken.”On Tuesday, County Commissioners 
deliberated the complex restrictions in 
place for ex-felons. Bob Swain, senior 
assistant county attorney, explained that 
the constitutional amendment allows the 
restoration of voting rights for ex-felons 
not only after the completion of their 
sentence but also once they’ve paid all 
ﬁ  nes, fees and restitutions.
There is an ongoing legal battle 
between the state and national level 
about voting restoration, Swain said. 
Fifteen plaintiffs, two of whom are from 
Alachua County, ﬁ  led a lawsuit against 
the state citing that the fee requirement 
for ex-felons is like a poll tax, according 
to the Tampa Bay Times. The Eleventh 
Circuit Court in Atlanta will provide an 
opinion, and Tallahassee is set to hear the 
trial in April.
“There is a chilling effect on 
people registering to vote if they had 
entanglement with the criminal justice 
system,” Swain said, adding that there is 
no way to know an ex-felon’s history in other states. 
County Commissioner Mike Byerly 
expressed frustration with the handling of 
voting restoration for ex-felons. He said 
the right to vote should not be connected 
to whether or not someone has money. 
His goal, he said, is for Alachua County 
to compile a list of ex-felons eligible for 
restoration and keep track of how much 
they owe. Commissioners discussed 
potentially helping ex-felons pay off fees. 
But when this was addressed during 
the meeting, County Commissioner 
Charles Chestnut was skeptical of the 
solution. He said he fears creating a sense 
of false hope.
To Chestnut, the limitation on ex-
felons with outstanding fees is equivalent 
to a poll tax, which were fees used to 
disenfranchise black voters during the 
Jim Crow era.
“They served their time,” Chestnut 
said. “They did their duty.”

THANK-YOU NOTES
By Emma Davis
Alligator Contributing Writer
Carmen Florez stood in Turlington Plaza 
watching RTS buses make their way down 
Newell Drive, watching as students took 
time out of their day to stop at her table 
and write a quick note.
“They’re kind of unsung heroes,” Flo-
rez, a 22-year-old UF behavior analysis 
senior, said, referring to Gainesville’s Re-gional Transit System drivers.  
Florez, the vice president of operations 
at UF’s Hispanic Student Association, set 
up a table in Turlington Tuesday morning 
for the second annual RTS Appreciation 
Day. The event was a joint effort with the 
association, the Asian American Student 
Union, the Women’s Student Association 
and Islam on Campus. 
The table in Turlington had a stack 
of empty notecards and a pile of colorful 
markers and pens for students to write a 
quick thank-you note to their bus driver for 
taking them to and from class every day. 
Students took the notes and handed them to their drivers as they got on the buses.
Strawder, 40, has driven for RTS for al-
most four years.
Strawder said RTS Appreciation Day is 
a  nice gesture, but she said she ﬁ  nds her 
passengers appreciate her every day. 
“The students are great,” she said. 
“They always say thank you when they’re 
getting off the bus.” 
RTS driver Aquila Alford, 51, got a 
thank-you note from a student at the Hub. 
He’s worked as an RTS driver for more 
than 20 years. He’s driven the 120 bus 
route from the Hub to Fraternity Row for 
the past six years. Alford ﬁ  st bumps students as they get 
on his bus and asks them how their day 
is going. 
“I am your parent,” Alford said. “Some-
body’s gotta look out for y’all.”
Alford said he drives the bus eight or 
nine hours a day and has “good listening 
ears.” He wants to give some advice or 
suggest an avenue to get help.
“I get to know you,” he said. “If some-
thing’s going on and you can’t talk to your 
peers or your parents about, you can al-
ways talk to me.”UF students thank their bus drivers on RTS Appreciation Day
THE PROGRAM IS TRANSLATING 
MEDICAL FORMS INTO SPANISH 
By Allessandra Inzinna
Alligator Staff Writer
A UF program is stepping in to bridge a gap for Spanish-
only speakers by translating their medical forms. 
HealthStreet, a UF community engagement program 
that helps reduce disparities in health research, introduced 
the project in September. To address a lack of Latinx and 
Hispanic people using the program’s health services and 
addressing what they want, program members translated 
all the forms pertaining to their health services into 
Spanish.
Ivan Grela, a 21-year-old UF microbiology and cell 
sciences senior, thought of the idea while doing community 
outreach and facing Spanish-only speaking residents in 
Gainesville.
All the forms have already been translated. Only 
consent and intake forms are awaiting ﬁ  nal approval by 
the U.S. Internal Review Board after the ﬁ  nal translations 
are perfected, which should be approved in the next few 
weeks, Grela said. 
“My main goal is having a form that people can easily 
understand,” Grela, who is Argentinian, said.After receiving approval from the HealthStreet board 
in October, Grela began translating the forms and going 
to places in Hispanic and Latinx communities to ﬁ  nd out 
more about their medical needs and offer HealthStreet’s 
services, like health screenings, mental health classes, 
research studies, clothing donations, free HIV testing and 
support groups.
Grela does outreach in the community at least twice a 
week for three to eight hours at a time. He travels as far as 
an hour away to restaurants, grocery stores, laundromats 
and homeless shelters. During these excursions, Grela 
hands out forms and tries to collect information about 
medical issues going on. 
“It’s very important for us to know what conditions are 
prevailing in the Hispanic community,” he said.
Lead community health worker Luisa Murphy, 24, 
became involved with the project in November, and 
schedules outreach events and coordinates interns and 
volunteers for them. She said the project emphasizes the 
program’s mission of having diverse research studies.
“All the research studies they’re doing here at UF is 
what’s going to change health policies,” Murphy said.
While Grela waits for the ﬁ  nal approval on the forms, 
he still travels to the Hispanic and Latinx communities to 
hand out translated calendars and brochures about events 
and services. “What HealthStreet is, is that your voice is being 
heard,” Murphy said. “That your diversity, that your 
culture, your ethnicity and race is actually being taken 
into consideration with the research that we do.”

Her clammy hands clenching 
a paper script, Emilie Dhir walked 
through the hallway towards the 
rehearsal room. Every step was 
more excruciating than the last. 
She walked into the rehearsal room 
at the University of Kentucky andperformed two scenes 
in front of a ﬁ  lmmaker and three 
ﬁ  lm producers. They were looking 
for a young Kentucky actress to be 
the star of their ﬁ  lm.
Dhir, now a 20-year-old UF ad-
vertising junior, was 14 when she 
auditioned and was cast in “Burning 
Kentucky.” The ﬁ  lm was released 
Tuesday on iTunes and Amazon af-ter a brief run at the Hippodrome in 
January.    
The ﬁ  lm centers around Dhir, 
who plays Aria, a young woman 
consumed by a mysterious event 
that killed her family. Aria evolves 
throughout the ﬁ  lm and is eventual-
ly forced to choose between the love 
of a man or avenging her family.
The ﬁ  lm was written and direct-
ed by Bethany Brooke Anderson, a 
Kentucky native who moved to Los 
Angeles in her early 20s. Anderson 
initially wrote “Burning Kentucky” 
as a novel but then adapted it for the 
screen, hoping to cast Kentucky na-tives for a realistic feel.
“Emilie was one of over 300 peo-
ple we auditioned in Kentucky and 
I knew immediately she was special 
and would play the role of Aria in 
our ﬁ  lm,” Anderson said. “Little did 
I know that she would also become 
my family.”
Dhir was born and raised in Lex-
ington, Kentucky, where she honed 
her acting chops early by performing 
in community and youth theatre.
The ﬁ  lm was shot for about two 
weeks in 2015 before running into 
ﬁ  nancial trouble. This caused a de-
lay in production, and ﬁ  lming was 
not completed until August 2017 just 
days before Dhir would be leaving 
for her freshman semester at UF. 
She decided to come to UF be-
cause she hates the cold and wanted 
the feel of the University of Kentucky 
but in a different location.
“Everyone at my high school 
went to UK, and I just wanted to get 
out,” she said. 
“Burning Kentucky” premiered 
Feb. 8, 2019 at the new Mammoth 
Film Festival in California, taking 
home awards for Best Picture and 
Best Actress. The ﬁ  lm went onto the 
respected Garden State, Con Nooga 
and Chattanooga Film Festivals and 
won awards in all of them. 
One of the biggest highlights for 
Dhir was the July 25, 2019 Kentucky 
screening. The event was a home-
coming for most of the cast and crew 
who are from Kentucky.
“Even my middle school teachers 
were there,” she said. Dhir says that over the course of 
shooting, she and her mother, an 
executive producer of the ﬁ  lm, grew 
very close to Anderson. 
Inspired by Anderson’s move 
from an “unexciting town” to Los 
Angeles to pursue directing, Dhir 
plans to move to L.A. after graduat-
ing UF to see where things go. Even 
if she does not act for a living, she 
says she can fall back on her adver-
tising degree but still work in enter-
tainment. 
Florence Pugh, the star of 2019 
ﬁ  lms “Midsommar” and “Little 
Women,” is a big inspiration to Dhir, 
especially because of her recent and 
early success.
Dhir is not currently acting in any 
projects but she hopes to work with 
Anderson in the future. Anderson 
plans to continue her career with 
two more ﬁ  lms based in Kentucky to 
complete a trilogy of Kentucky ﬁ  lms. 
For Anderson and most of the 
crew, “Burning Kentucky” is a love 
letter to the state they once called 
home.  
“Returning to Kentucky to make 
the ﬁ  lm was a dream come true,” 
Anderson said. “Kentuckians are so 
creative, resourceful natural story-
tellers. Making our indie ﬁ  lm there 
made so much sense. And the beau-
ty of the state is undeniable. It was 
such a perfect backdrop. I was also 
able to have my dearest friends and 
family on set while I worked. That 
was so invaluable to me.”

Imagine a pot roast in a dress on a drinking 
safari. That kind of chaotic artistry can only 
be found on “7 Songs 7 Inches,” the ﬁ  rst re-
cord by local punk band Piss Test.
The Gainesville band’s music is symbolic 
of a growing, thriving city in contemporary 
turmoil. Debra Fetzer, the band’s lead vo-
calist, said that the changes happening in 
Gainesville are reﬂ  ected in the band’s music.
“I’ve biked to work everyday for maybe 
30 years,” Fetzer said. “I’m older than other 
artists I know, but that doesn’t mean I’m not worried about what’s happening.”
Piss Test delivers a short but energetic re-
cord. “7 Songs 7 Inches” packs a range of at-
titudes, fun times and reﬂ  ections on life into a 
20-minute runtime. That simple variety leads 
to some great punk rock tracks.
The band comprises guitarist Mike Mc-
Coy, drummer Michelle “Buck” Nunez, front-
woman Fetzer and bassist Randy Kettlesen. 
Each member complements the others so well 
it’s surprising they’ve only been together for 
three years. 
“We’re a true team,” said McCoy. “I think 
we have a unique sound, and we all contrib-
ute something special to every track.”In “Gentrify My Balls,” Piss Test rebels 
against the exploitation of Gainesville’s sacred 
spaces. For the band, the gentriﬁ  cation of the 
city is already well in motion. Lyrics such as 
“can’t go back to what was; 40 years, guess 
that’s good” highlight Gainesville’s transfor-
mation into a suburban dystopia.
Other tracks are more carefree but just as 
aggressive. “Drinkin’ Safari” is a tropical rock 
track set on the shores of a dynamic Hawai-
ian tsunami. “9 Lives” is an ode to life and 
immortality. As Fetzer said, it’s never too late 
to follow your passions.
“Anybody can do it,” said Fetzer. “Don’t 
hold back on your dreams. Express yourself.”
“7 Songs 7 Inches” is available for pur-
chase on Bandcamp. Piss Test will continue to 
tour Florida and hopes to release new tracks 
soon.

THE RALL Y RAISES FUNDS FOR UF 
MOBILE OUTREACH CLINIC 
By Chloe Greenberg
Avenue Staff Writer
Seven years ago, Gainesville’s High 
Dive held the ﬁ  rst food truck rally the city 
had ever seen. Now, it’s celebrating its 
seventh anniversary of food, music and 
philanthropy.
The event started in 2013 when High 
Dive facility and events manager Patrick 
Lavery saw a need for a Gainesville food 
truck event. 
“We scraped together six food trucks 
that we found and put them in our parking 
lot,” Lavery said. “It started at 7 o’clock 
and at 7:05, the entire parking lot was full 
of people. We were all just kind of ﬂ  abber-gasted and realized we had something cool 
on our hands.” 
For Saturday’s rally, High Dive part-
nered with UF Mobile Outreach Clinic, 
which offers free primary care to commu-
nities around Gainesville.
Anuksha Gotmare, a 20-year-old UF bi-
ology junior and care coordinator of the 
clinic, said she was grateful for the oppor-
tunity to spread the organization’s mes-
sage.
“It was really interesting that a lot of 
people did not really know what we do 
or where we are,” Gotmare said. “So, I’m 
glad I was able to explain that to some lo-
cals so, by word of mouth, they can share 
that.”
Sen Khiev, owner of Sublime Tacos, 
said their truck has been a part of the ral-
lies since 2016.
“The Gainesville food truck scene has really grown,” Khiev said. “There’s a lot 
more food trucks now that are active, a lot 
more variety and a lot more vendors.”
Lavery said that the rallies have been 
able to raise tens of thousands of dollars 
for different Gainesville charities, while 
cultivating a city-wide movement and 
strengthening appreciation for food trucks. 
“It’s cool because when we ﬁ  rst start-
ed, we could barely ﬁ  nd six food trucks in 
town,” he said. “There’s probably 40 food 
trucks that we cycle through, so we kind of 
feel like we kicked off the food truck cul-
ture in Gainesville. It’s really turned into a 
really big thing.”

Dancers ﬂ  it across the stage in a whirlwind of color 
and grace. Music swells in the theater and audiences 
gasp with emotion. “Formulae & Fairy Tales” incites the 
same response, but throws math in the mix.
The show, which the L.A. Times has called “a break-
through,” was created and performed by the Invertigo 
Dance Theatre in its L.A. studio.
The performance takes the audience through a cre-
ative journey of Alan Turing’s life. Turing was a famous 
codebreaker in WWII and the inspiration for the 2014 
ﬁ  lm “The Imitation Game.” The performance will be 
held Wednesday at 7:30 p.m. in the Phillips Center for 
the Performing Arts. 
The Gainesville performance will be one night only 
and kicks off their national tour. The show was created 
over three years ago by the theater’s artistic director, 
Laura Karlin. 
According to the now interim artistic director, Rachel 
Whiting, the show combines themes reﬂ  ective of Tur-
ing’s life, such as math and sex, and has a parallel to Turing’s favorite fairy tale, “Snow White and the Seven 
Dwarfs.” Only three of the original dance members re-
main, which is not unusual for a long-running show.
Talking about Karlin, “She made up a series of move-
ments, ran it through a polyalphabetic cipher, and then 
used that sequence and put it onto us in a dance,” Jessica 
Dunn, one of the original dancers, said. “She’s deep into 
her research on this.”
Cody Potter is another one of the original members, 
and they described this creative endeavor as “life chang-
ing.”
“I’m super excited to tour this work because the con-
tent is so important to me as a non-binary person,” Pot-
ter said. “If you take a look, I think, Alan Turing had an 
incredible ability to look at the world around him and be 
way deeper than what is on the surface.”
Tickets are $10 for UF students and go up to $40 and 
are available on the Phillips Center website.

MEN'S BASKETBALL

It’s not the World’s Largest Outdoor Cock-
tail Party, but tonight’s matchup on the hard-
wood between Florida (13-8, 5-3 SEC) and 
Georgia (12-9, 2-6 SEC) still carries great im-
portance as the SEC season reaches its median 
for both teams.
On Superhero Night at the O’Connell Cen-
ter, UF will look to fend off what has been its 
kryptonite in recent seasons.
The Bulldogs have beaten the Gators three 
out of the last four times in the series, including 
the last time the two teams met in Gainesville.
Last March, a lowly Georgia team with a 
1-14 record in conference play nearly ended 
Florida’s in hopes of an NCAA Tournament bid 
behind the performance of one player: Nicolas 
Claxton (25 points, three blocks, two assists).Georgia’s built to do similar damage in 
this rendition of the rivalry, with future NBA 
Lottery pick Anthony Edwards in the starting 
lineup.
Besides him, the Bulldogs have some glar-
ing holes that the Gators will need to exploit 
to avoid their third-straight home loss of the 
season.
Stopping UGA’s one-two punch: UF’s 
defense will be challenged by tandem of 
Edwards and Hammonds
Coach Mike White was asked during his 
media availability on Monday about the chal-
lenges a talent like Edwards brings to opposing 
teams' defenses.
Averaging 19.3 points per game, second-
most in the SEC, White realizes the chances of 
shutting him down are slim to none.
“No. Oh, he’s going to take his,” White said. 
“What a talent. One of the best talents that I’ve ever witnessed in this league at his age. He’s 
tremendous. And Tom (Crean) does a good job 
of putting him in space and letting him do what 
he does.”
When — and if — Edwards is contained, 
the Bulldogs have another weapon at their dis-
posal.
Six-foot-9 forward Rayshaun Hammonds is 
the only other Georgia player averaging double 
ﬁ  gures at 12.5 points per game, and he has 
enough talent to give his opponent a tough 
night in the trenches if they let him. Ham-
monds has scored in double ﬁ  gures 13 times 
this season and averages 7.6 rebounds per 
game to lead the team.

SOFTBALL

Five games. Three days. One reinvented 
team.
Florida’s 2020 campaign kicks off Friday 
in Tampa with the USF-Rawlings Invitational, 
where it will face Illinois State, Fresno State, 
No. 17 Michigan, Georgia State and USF.
The No. 7 Gators seventh-consecutive ap-
pearance in the USF Opening Weekend Invi-
tational will provide an early indication of the 
state of this year’s squad. After uncharacteristi-
cally being tabbed ﬁ  fth in the SEC Preseason 
Coaches’ Poll (last year, it was picked to win 
the conference), Florida has plenty to prove 
when it takes the ﬁ  eld to play the Wolverines, 
who have depth and experience in the circle 
and two players on the 2020 USA Softball Col-
legiate Player of the Year watchlist (junior 
pitcher Meghan Beaubien and sophomore out-
ﬁ  elder Lexie Blair). 
Instead of being discouraged by preseason rankings, senior outﬁ  elder Jade Caraway says 
Florida is fueled by outsiders’ doubts.
“I don’t think that’s something we’re really 
worried about,” Caraway said. “Honestly, it’s 
an underdog mentality, it’s just honestly an ad-
vantage at this point, because we’re just going 
to go out and surprise people."
Nonetheless, this weekend will be a crucial 
opportunity for the Gators to start the season 
off on a high note and carry that momentum 
into a challenging non-conference slate. Here 
are a couple of things Florida will aim to ac-
complish in Tampa outside of wins and losses:
Building the pitching staff’s conﬁ  dence
With the graduation of All-American pitch-
er Kelly Barnhill, there is an opening on the 
mound for the Gators. Coach Tim Walton said 
he is conﬁ  dent in the members of his pitching 
staff — all ﬁ  ve of them. With still no frontrun-
ner in sight, Walton wants everyone prepared 
to pitch at any moment and see how his multi-
faceted group of pitchers fares against outside 
competition. 
“Most of the time you see ﬁ  ve pitchers (in a game), it’s not usually a game that the Gators 
are going to win,” Walton said. “I think it’s 
going to be a little bit different this year, with 
each one of them having a little bit of a differ-
ent out pitch.”
Senior catcher Jordan Roberts hopes this 
weekend will allow the young staff to build 
conﬁ  dence that will carry over through the 
remainder of the season. After all, ﬁ  lling the 
shoes of 10 straight years of having an All-
American pitcher on the roster can be a daunt-
ing task.
As long as the Gators can keep their ERA 
under two, Walton feels his team will be able 
to prolong its postseason campaign, and it all 
starts with the season-opener with this week-
end.
Establishing an inclusive team identity 
In recent years, Florida has been marked as 
Barnhill and Amanda Lorenz’s team. The two 
served as the primary faces of Gator softball for 
years. With Barnhill starting her professional 
softball career and Lorenz in the dugout as a student assistant coach, it is time for new ath-
letes to rise up and assume this role.
Roberts’ goal for this team is a more inclu-
sive identity, where everyone as a collective 
serves as “the face” of the SEC’s historically 
most dominant softball school.
"I want (the identity) to be just us all to-
gether as one...everyone brings something 
valuable to the team...not so much individual 
people.”
This weekend symbolizes a fresh start for 
the Gators, where they can craft a new image 
for themselves as a program.

MEN'S GOLF
By Christian Berry

The Gators were close to starting their spring season with an 
impressive tournament win. Freshman Ricky Castillo and junior 
John Axelsen ﬁ  nished ﬁ  rst and second on the individual leader-
board at the Sea Best Invitational in Jacksonville Tuesday, but 
the team ultimately lost by two strokes to No. 20 Texas A&M. 
In the ﬁ  rst round, Florida showed off its potential and led all 
teams with an impressive score of 276, two points lower than 
second-place North Carolina’s 278. It was a score good enough 
to give UF a two-stroke lead going into the second day.
This impressive start came at the hands of a strong perfor-
mance from redshirt freshman Fred Biondi. He showed his potential, scoring a career-best four-under 66 in the opening 
round, which was seven strokes better than his previous mark.
However, the ﬁ  rst-round lead didn't last long, as Texas A&M 
stormed back in the next 18 to regain a one-stroke advantage 
by the end of day two. 
Despite Texas A&M’s tremendous second round, Axelsen, 
Castillo and Biondi all had stellar performances for the Gators, 
which saw them ﬁ  nish the day within the top three on the indi-
vidual leaderboards. 
“I’m really pleased for a lot of the guys and the team that 
their hard work and commitment in the month of January paid 
off with a good start today,” coach J.C. Deacon said in a release. 
“To be in contention and in the ﬁ  nal group tomorrow is more 
like our standard.” Ultimately, Axelsen and Castillo’s individual performances 
kept the team within striking distance Tuesday but UF was nev-
er able to regain an edge over Texas A&M, which led to their 
eventual two-stroke loss. 
UF hosts the Florida Gators Invitational on Feb. 15 and has 
four more tournaments before the SEC Championship on April 
22. 
If this tournament was any indication, it looks like Florida 
may have a real shot come April.
