Despite his Thursday driving under the 
inﬂ  uence arrest — less than a month before 
the Gainesville mayoral runoff election — Mayor Craig Lowe’s campaign for re-elec-tion will continue as planned.
On Friday afternoon, Lowe, 55, issued a 
statement assuring residents and support-ers that he will remain on the ballot.
“Over the next few days and weeks, I 
will continue to perform my duties as Mayor and work hard as a candidate 
for re-election,” he said in a prepared statement.
Lowe had released a 
previous statement saying he would not be found 
guilty in the case. Howev-
er, in Friday’s statement, 
Lowe accepted responsibility and said the situation was a legal and personal issue.
“I regret that my actions Thursday morn-
ing have disappointed so many friends, supporters, and citizens of Gainesville,” he said. “I hope that in the future I will again prove worthy of the public’s trust and con-
ﬁ  dence.”
Lowe is scheduled to run off against for-
mer city commissioner and mayoral candi-
date Ed Braddy on April 16.
Nick Mildebrath, Lowe’s campaign man-
ager, declined to comment Sunday.
The Florida Highway Patrol arrested 
Lowe at 5:26 a.m. Thursday near the in-tersection of Northeast 21st Street and 
Northeast 156th Avenue. Lowe performed 
poorly on his ﬁ  eld sobriety test and was later booked into the Alachua County Jail. He was released later that afternoon on his own recognizance.
Lowe is scheduled to reappear in court 
for his arraignment April 11.
“I will accept the consequences of my ac-
tions and face the sanctions that are deemed 
appropriate,” he said.

A South Florida rapper scheduled to perform at Allure Night-
Club was arrested on drug charges early Sunday.
Gainesville Police arrested Dothan Richardson, 35, of 426 Park-
way Court in Greenacres, Fla., at about 1:30 a.m. on drug posses-
sion with intent to sell and marijuana possession charges, accord-
ing to a GPD arrest report.
At about 12:15 a.m. Sunday, a GPD ofﬁ  cer stopped a car in the 
200 block of Northwest First Avenue for a seat-belt violation. The 
ofﬁ  cer reported the smell of marijuana coming from the car.
Richardson, who sat in the front passenger seat, told the ofﬁ  cer 
he had a “little bit of weed” on him and agreed to a search, ac-cording to the report. The ofﬁ  cer found ﬁ  ve Ecstasy pills, equal to 1.5 grams, as well as 2.7 grams of marijuana in 
Richardson’s pockets. Police also reported ﬁ  nd-ing $1,955 in cash.
During questioning, Richardson said he 
planned to get rid of the drugs. However, he changed his story, saying he was going to take all the pills himself. He then said he wanted to take some of the pills and give the others to a woman, according to the report.
GPD spokesman Ofﬁ  cer Ben Tobias said 
Richardson was in town to perform at the nightclub, located at 238 W. University Ave. Ofﬁ  cers booked Richardson into the Alachua County Jail at about 2 a.m. Sunday. He was released later that day 
after meeting bond.

The Indian Students Association, Student Government Multicultural

Intercultural Engagement will host the first university-wide Festival of Colors event after she bought it in 2012. The 
Old Farm Pure Rye Whiskey 
was produced in the early 1900s by the nearby West Overton Distilling Co.
“My guess is that Mr. 
Brennan ordered 10 cases, pre-Prohibition,” said Hill, a New Yorker who bought the house to convert it into a bed-and-
breakfast. “I was told by his 
family that family members used to greet him at the door each day with a shot of whiskey.”
Scottdale police told the 
Pittsburgh Tribune-Review that Saunders drank dozens of bottles of whiskey valued at $102,400 by a New York auction 
house.
Saunders, 62, of Irwin, Pa., 
was charged with receiving 
stolen property and theft. A preliminary hearing is scheduled for Wednesday.
Hill told police Chief Barry 
Pritts she stored the whiskey in the original cases, which 
contained 12 bottles each. After 
Saunders moved out, Hill said she discovered last March that the bottles in four cases were empty.

Goblin-proof chicken book wins 
odd-title prize
LONDON — A supernaturally 
tinged barnyard manual has 
won Britain’s quirkiest literary award, the Diagram Prize for year’s oddest book title.
“Goblinproofing One’s 
Chicken Coop” by Reginald Bakeley was awarded the prize Friday by trade magazine The Bookseller.
The book took 38 percent 
of the votes in a public ballot, beating finalists including “How Tea Cosies Changed the 
World,” ‘’Was Hitler Ill?” and 
“God’s Doodle: The Life and Times of the Penis.”
“Goblinproofing One’s 
Chicken Coop” is subtitled “and other practical advice in our campaign against the fairy kingdom.” It is described by its Massachusetts-based publisher, 
Conari Press, as “the essential 
primer for banishing the dark fairy creatures that are lurking in the dark corners and crevices of your life.”
Diagram Prize overseer 
Horace Bent said it was no coincidence “in these austere times that a book aimed to assist 
members of the public frugally 
farming their own produce proved the most popular title.”

Pa. caretaker charged with

Fifty-two bottles of well-aged 
whiskey disappeared between his lips, police said, and now it’s time for a western 
Pennsylvania man to settle 
up.
John Saunders, the 
former live-in caretaker of a Pittsburgh-area mansion, faces criminal charges for allegedly drinking more than $100,000 worth of the owner’s whiskey.

nine cases of whiskey hidden in the walls and stairwell of the century-old Georgian mansion built by coal and coke industrialist J.P. Brennan MONDAY, MARCH 25, 2013 � ALLIGATOR, 3

The installation of the carillon in Century Tow-
er began and was expected to take about a month to finish. When Century Tower was built, it had an electric bell system, but it eventually broke down. 
The new 61-bell carillon system cost about $200,000 
and was funded by student fees. Part of the cost came from the import duties to get the bells from Holland, where they were cast, to UF campus.
March 30, 1989After UF officials didn’t tell anyone about an 
accidental raw sewage spill into Lake Alice, the Florida Department of Environmental Regulation 
warned them to not let it happen again. The of-
ficials said no one knew a sewage lift station on campus had overflow lines leading to the lake that had been sending sewage to the lake since it was built. The physical plant director Robert Cremer was not particularly concerned about whether the sewage went to the lake or to an above-ground pit, but the environmental regulators disagreed.

A UF alumnus and his wife donated $5 million 
to the university’s College of Medicine for cancer 
research. The decision came from their own expe-riences with stomach and breast cancer. The do-nation, which was the largest ever to the college, 
was matched by the state for a total donation of 
$10 million. The money was slated to go toward 
attracting experienced research faculty. The build-ing used for outpatient care at the UF Cancer Cen-ter was named the Davis Cancer Pavilion after the 
couple.

Rain or shine, gardening enthusiasts were determined to 
enjoy this weekend’s Kanapaha Botanical Gardens’ Spring 
Garden Festival.
About 2,500 people gathered Saturday and Sunday to 
buy, sell and learn about plants at the Kanapaha Botanical 
Gardens in southwest Gainesville.
Attendees were serenaded by live music and the booming 
voice of an auctioneer as they wandered around the gardens 
and perused more than 200 booths on the grounds. Vendors sold everything from herbs and flowers to garden decora-tions crafted out of vintage silverware.
But amid the bright blooms and buds of the festival, Lost 
World Exotics Nursery offered something with a little more bite.
Diane McDavid, owner of the nursery, sold an array of insect-eating plants.
McDavid, 46,  has previously attended the festival as a 
guest but only twice as a vendor.
Her favorite part, she said, was children’s reactions when 
carnivorous plants ate insects.
“Little boys love the carnivorous plants,” she said.Adults had fun Saturday, too, including Michelle 
Fromhart, a 34-year-old graphic designer from Spring Hill, Fla., and an admitted occasional “black thumb.”
“I actively seek out all plant and garden festivals within a 
150-mile radius,” she admitted.
Fromhart said this festival was well worth the commute 
and the inclement weather. She said she plans on returning 
next year.Garden festival flourishes despite rain

All Dylan Klempner wants is for 
cancer patients to be able embrace art in 
all its forms. Livestrong might be able to help him with that.
Shands at UF’s Arts in Medicine 
program is a candidate for a grant from the Livestrong Community Impact Project, which offers $1.2 million to bring cancer support programs to com-munities across the country, according to a Livestrong press release.Finalists, which will be determined 
by online voting, will receive funding from Livestrong to help implement programs that improve the lives of can-cer patients. Voting, which is at www.
vote.livestrong.org/regions/4/ under 
the “The Creative Center at University Settlement” section,  ends Thursday.
If UF wins, part of the money will go 
toward expanding the Mobile Inspira-tion Station, a program run by Klemp-ner, an artist in residence at Shands at UF. The station is a cart filled with art, writing and music supplies Klempner 
brings to cancer patients’ bedsides to 
inspire them to take part in art activi-ties.The grant would allow for weekly 
visual art and writing workshops for cancer patients in all stages of diagno-sis.
“I feel when people are dealing with 
any kind of serious illness, they just want to make meaning of their lives,” Klempner said. “Art does that better than anything else. It heals in a holistic way.”
Courtney Smeriglio, a 20-year-old 
UF psychology junior and a volunteer for Klempner, said the possibility of a grant from Livestrong provides hope.
“We won’t have to worry about 
money,” she said. “It’s nice not to have that stress.”

Madison Ballers players watch the Nations Park Grand Opening ceremony in New -
berry on Saturday. The park will host about 13 baseball tournaments this summer.
Nations Park will host a tournament each weekend this summer
The ballpark, located in Newberry at 25325 
SW 15th Ave., is based on a state-of-the-art 
youth baseball facility in Cooperstown, N.Y.
Beginning in June, Nations Park will host a 
baseball tournament each weekend until Au-
gust, with participation ranging from 40 to 100 
teams per week.
Newberry Mayor William Conrad said he 
hopes the opening of the ballpark will be a milestone for the city in spite of a struggling economy.
“The people of Newberry will look back 
on 2013 and say, ‘That was the year we built baseball fields,’” he said. “We began a journey 
today that will take us out of the recession.”
He said the park will also act as a stepping 
stone to college scholarships and beyond.
Spina, who now coaches youth baseball 
teams in Newberry, agreed.
“All I want to do is help the kids...get their 
education and do something with their lives,” 
he said.
Newberry City Commissioner Joe Hoffman 
said the idea for the ballpark stemmed from a need to attract more business to the city.
“The Commission before me wanted to bring 
an asphalt plant here and start more industrial-type development, and I thought, ‘That’s just crazy.’ They wanted to do it right next to our park,” he said.
The Commission then decided sports and 
recreation tourism would be a better way to pursue economic development for the city, he said.
Hoffman said he expects the ballpark will 
keep hotels and other local businesses busy to “really give a boost to the local economy.“
“That was the whole point of all of this,” he 
said.
Before the first round of games started 
Saturday, Susan Parker sat beside a low wall, peering into left field as her 11-year-old sons, Christian and Nicholas Parker, warmed up.
Susan Parker traveled with her family from 
Destin to attend the tournament, and it wasn’t long before her sons became acquainted with the new turf.
“The kids have already practiced sliding in 
it,” she said.

Online learning was the focus of 
UF’s Board of Trustees meeting Fri-
day morning.
Provost Joe Glover and Assistant 
Provost for Teaching and Technol-
ogy Andy McCollough gave a pre-
sentation about the future of online distance learning, which has become a hot topic, as the state of Florida has announced its intentions to create an online university.
“The legislature is moving — 
very purposefully, I think — to name a lead university to help direct the state’s online efforts,” UF President Bernie Machen said in the meeting.
McCollough talked about UF’s 
commitment to online learning in the past and the future.
“We’re not Johnny-come-latelies 
in this activity,” he said. “We were on this train back when this train was a covered wagon.”About a third of all undergradu-
ate students at UF take at least one 
online class a semester, McCollough 
said.
“We’re going to emphasize on-line learning as a way to provide ac-cess and to tap alternative sources of revenue,” he said.
UF offers 70 graduate degrees on-
line, and people can take UF classes for free on Coursera.
The state recently decided to al-
low the university to collect a dis-tance-learning fee. Last year, UF col-lected $3.3 million in cost recovery.
UF has decided to step up to the 
challenge the state has issued to cre-ate an entirely online university. Friday’s presentation discussed the problems involved in creating such a university such as academic integ-rity and majors that include labora-tory classes.
The state expects this online en-
deavor will be up and running by 
January 2014, Glover said, so UF 
would have to move on a “very ag-gressive timeline.”
“This is not something we can 
stand on the sidelines and watch others do,” McCollough said.
UF hopes online learning, university can go the distance

HIGH SPRINGS — Chili lovers gathered at O’Leno 
State Park Saturday for the Chili Appreciation Society In-
ternational Inc.’s sixth annual O’Leno Ole’ Chili Cook Off.
All proceeds went to the O’Leno Nature Center. The 
funds will used to feed and care for the animals at the cen-
ter, said Ed Bisch, one of the judges at the event.
The regulation category was based on Texas-style chili 
— just meat and gravy. In the open category, anything was 
allowed. One participant, Stephen Spicer, of High Springs, mixed buffalo meat in his Ragin’ Cajun chili.
Brenda Macrides, of Fort White, said she participated in 
the cook-off for fun.
“For me, it’s just about raising money for good charities 
and meeting people,” she said.
Macrides’ Bella-the-Ball Black-Bean Chili, which con-
sists of chuck roast, black beans and corn, won the People’s Choice award last year. She entered the chili again this year in hopes of winning two years in a row.
At the end of the competition, Spicer came out on top 
in the People’s Choice category. Pat Zimmer, of High Springs, won in the regulation category with his ground beef and Fort Worth chili powder. Macrides won in the open category.
“Shake and taste,” Macrides said. “I just shake spices in 
and taste it until I like it.”Chili cooks spice up

With popular TV shows like “The 
Walking Dead” and numerous zombie 
video games, it is no surprise zombies have continued to peak people’s inter-ests.
But researchers are more interested 
in the reasons behind increased popu-larity in zombies and what it may be tied to. A study conducted at Clemson University suggests there is a direct correlation between the interest in zombies and people’s unhappiness.Doug Johnson, who authored the 
“UF Zombie Attack: Disaster Prepared-ness Simulation Exercise #5 (DR5),” said he agrees there is some substance behind this claim.
“This fascination with zombies is 
a fascination with this unlimited and 
unfocused and mindless consump-
tion because that’s what zombies are. That’s what they do.” said Johnson, the assistant director for UF’s Learning Services.
Megan Ouellette, a 23-year-old UF early childhood education graduate student, said she doesn’t see the con-nection between an the popularity of zombies and people’s unhappiness.
“I think it’s just a consumer fad like 
any other popular thing people get ob-sessed with,” she said.
Colin Knapp, a UF visiting eco-
nomics professor, said people see the relationship between zombies and the economy because they want to see it, not because it is actually there.
“It just seems to be that people think 
there’s a lot of economic angst right 
now; therefore, that must be why peo-
ple want to watch zombie movies,” he said. “But if you look at history, people always seemed to like zombies.” Unhappiness causing zombie obsessionMARIA LLORENS

While President Barack Obama was in Israel last week, 
UF students followed his messages closely. The four-day 
visit included stops at the West Bank and Jordan.
UF associate professor Matthew Jacobs said one of 
Obama’s goals on the trip was to move beyond his tense re-
lations with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.
“In some ways, you can see part of this trip is a response 
to that, to try to go around Netanyahu,” said Jacobs, who 
teaches history and international relations courses.
However, he found the trip unsurprising.“If there’s anything that surprised me, it was his willing-
ness ... to challenge Netanyahu a little bit in terms of just the nature of their relationship,” Jacobs said. 
“But he never openly did it.”
Rami Okasha, a 20-year-old UF electri-
cal engineering junior and vice president 
of UF’s chapter of Students for Justice in Palestine, said although Obama criticized some Israeli actions, he did not take a strong stance against them.
However, Nicole Krassner, president 
of Gators for Israel, said Obama’s visit to 
the Iron Dome defense system was symbolic.
“It was a tangible way to see the U.S. relationship with 
Israel because the Iron Dome was heavily funded by the American government,” the 21-year-old UF political science senior said.Gators review Obama’s Israel visit

to conduct a research study of the ef-fects of dance on Parkinson’s disease. 
The 16-week study, which began 
earlier this month, is still looking for research participants.
But on Friday, program participants 
and UF dance majors were treated to 
a class taught by instructors from the 
Mark Morris Dance Group in New York.
The group, which performed later 
that night at the Phillips Center for the 
Performing Arts, developed a thera-peutic dance program for Parkinson’s disease patients.
Chelsea Moehlenbrock, a 22-year-
old applied physiology and kinesiol-ogy senior, has been involved with Dance for Life for a year and a half. 
As a program assistant, she conducts 
research and helps teach the classes.
In her experience, Moehlenbrock 
said she’s seen physical, cognitive and emotional benefits in her patients, es-pecially through social involvement.
“Taking dance classes is way more 
fun than physical therapy,” she said.
Schmidt, who was diagnosed in 
2010, has been attending the program for two years. 
She said dancing helps her balance 
and coordination.
“It’s part of my schedule now,” 
Schmidt said. “I miss it if I don’t come.”

OPINIONS EDITORFriday’s poll results were not available.Today’s question: Do you think Gainesville 
Mayor Craig Lowe should continue his re-election campaign?Ladies Night: 
New comedy lineup? 
Don’t really believe everything you read in the New York 
Post.
Comedian John Mulaney said in his special, titled 
“New In Town,” that reading the New York Post “is like talking to someone who heard the news, and now they’re trying to give 
you the gist.”
“It’s like someone read a better newspaper,” Mulaney said, 
“and now they’re trying to text you everything they can remem-
ber. Doesn’t have to be right, just has to be short.”  
Recently, the Post has speculated on who will take over Jim-
my Fallon’s “Late Night” hosting gig.
Don’t be alarmed: Fallon isn’t necessarily disappearing. This 
is all based on the assumption Fallon will be taking over after Jay Leno’s contract to host “The Tonight Show” runs out in 2014.
The Post could see Seth Meyers ﬁ  lling Fallon’s role. Meyers 
is head writer for “Saturday Night Live” and the “Weekend Up-date” host for the show.
That would be an easy-ish transition, as Fallon once hosted 
“Update,” as well, when he was on “SNL.”
But in recent years, Fallon has found his niche on “Late 
Night.” He lost a lot of favor with audiences by the end of his “SNL” run — mostly because he broke character in so many of the sketches. (To be fair, who could blame him because those 
sketches were hilarious.)
So, once he left the show and started hosting “Late Night,” 
people were concerned if it was a good ﬁ  t for him. We believe 
he’s been able to really develop his own brand of comedy through the show, and he seems to have really come into his own.
The Post’s other guess for new host of “Late Night” is How-
ard Stern.
Personally, we don’t see the appeal for Stern at all. His ra-
dio show just isn’t our cup of tea. However, we could deﬁ  nitely understand that Stern hosting a late-night talk show would most likely draw tons of viewers. Is it the right ﬁ  t for him? Who knows.
You could probably come up with a better idea for a host 
yourselves.
That’s kind of what BuzzFeed reporter Adam B. Vary did 
over the weekend with a post titled “8 Potential New ‘Late Night’ Hosts Who Aren’t White Men.”
So many funny women could do this job, y’all. There are so 
many more than the article even lists. Like, have you seen You-Tube? Grace Helbig or Mamrie Hart, stars of “DailyGrace” and “You Deserve A Drink,” respectively, could probably host “Late Night” just ﬁ  ne.
Vary mentioned ladies like Maya Rudolph and Amy Sedaris. 
We ask: Why not?
Let’s think outside of the box when it comes down to choos-
ing new talent to showcase. 
That’s all we’re asking. There are so many more options than 
the obvious ones. That’s saying a lot because Meyers is amaz-ing at what he does, and we’d be happy to watch him be funny on our TV screens forever. But there should be room for new growth.
We know the new lineup will be great because Leno won’t be 
involved any more.
Kim Kardashian’s beauty has lied to you  
I don’t understand it. I just can’t understand it. How can a 
beautiful woman look in the mirror and tell herself  she’s not beautiful? How could society have ingrained itself so 
ﬁ  rmly in the back of her mind that she refuses to believe — no matter how many times she’s told — she is crazy-beautiful?
I have to note here that I’m not addressing any speciﬁ  c 
girl based on anything that’s happened to me recently. This is just something I’ve been thinking about for a while and  had a conversation with a friend about.
We have known some gorgeous — and I mean G-O-R-G-
E-O-U-S — girls who treat themselves like dirt. They won’t allow themselves to build up any amount of self-conﬁ  dence or self-worth because they’re too busy staring in the mirror looking for imperfections to amplify and hammer them-selves over.
What the hegemony of supermodel narratives of beauty 
in our culture has done is create an unreachable standard of false beauty that poisons everyone with its consequences.
Girls tear themselves to shreds wishing for perfect skin, 
perfect bodies, perfect everything.
Guys think it’s OK for them to take one look at a girl and 
decide based on some arbitrary criterion — some dudes are legs men, etc. — whether they’ll even consider her as a pos-sible mate. (It works the other way, too, obviously, but I do have a character limit.)
Both sides of the cycle continue to reinforce each other, 
and we all spin down further and further into what W. B. Yeats described by saying simply, “The best lack all convic-tion, while the worst/ Are full of passionate intensity.”
The most wonderfully beautiful women I know — beau-
tiful not just in the face but in words, intelligence and grace — will never know how beautiful they are. They lack all con-viction in themselves.
They cannot see how they could be beautiful when wom-
en like Bar Refaeli and Kate Upton are out there with their sleek hair and curves for days.
I’m not stupid. I’m not gonna try and deny that Bar Refaeli and Kate Upton are beautiful.
But beautiful is not like 
heaven where only a certain number of people can ﬁ  t its qualiﬁ  cations. And beautiful is not like that “Face Lift” minig-ame in Mario Party where you get points based on how well you stretch the guy’s face to 
replicate the center image. Beautiful denies the qualities of conformity and exclusion. I’ve heard girls say, “I’ll never be beautiful, I’ll never look like her.” Excuse my French, but that’s f-----g exactly why you are beautiful. Difference is beauty. That has wider implications than just physical beau-ty. I’m talking about poetry. I’m talking about music. I’m talking about the exotic reaches of aesthetic beauty.
Yeah, we, as a human race, could continue to create the 
same guitar-driven rock music for the next hundred years, or we could continue to press on into new exciting musical frontiers like rap, hip-hop and electronica. Yeah, we could re-write Sylvia Plath and the confessional poets a million more times (note: poetry on the Internet is the embodiment of this), or we could write silly poems about coke-snorting ostriches and talking watermelons to make ourselves laugh.
Our generation could continue to copy what past genera-
tions have done and base our ideas of beauty on what we’ve seen or been told, but where’s the fun in that? Why not be different?
Yes, men and women are still going to objectify each 
other. We’re human. We can’t help it. And yes, critics — es-pecially on the Internet — are still going to tear down music they don’t like and other art they don’t understand. But that doesn’t mean we have to listen to them. That doesn’t mean they’re right.

Scouts’ honor?
Dear Kaitlyn McGowan,
I read your article on gen-
der inequality in the Boy Scouts and Girl Scouts. I couldn’t agree more.  The fact 
that girls and boys have dif-
ferent badges and different requirements enforces the so-cial construct of, “Boys should do this, and girls should do that.” I absolutely hate when people say gender equality is important but then get of-fended when you challenge a 
construct such as the Boy and 
Girl Scouts and how they are obviously not equal.  I think if more people participated in feminist activity for the equal rights of males and females, this country may actually sig-nify what it is supposed to one day.  
Sincerely,
James Williams

Columns restore faith in 
paper
Mr. Skipper,
Thank you for your col-
umn. I really enjoyed it, and it has sort of revived my faith in your generation. Believe me, it 
needed some revival, as I have 
read other articles written by your fellow students and was totally disgusted. One had as its major subject the act that scumbag Clinton and his young slut entered into, and the other was about the writer, a female male, talking about how he lost his boyfriend.
I also found the article by 
Justin Hayes to be very inter-esting and well-written. Two 
excellent, commonsense argu-
ments in one edition must be a first. You both will probably never be asked to write again.
I am 81 and have some 
different views than you do, which is natural.
I am Catholic and certainly 
believe in God, but I have seri-
ous issues with the hierarchy 
of the church. But when I hear these young a---s go on about abortion, drugs, free sex, binge boozing, etc., my stom-ach turns, as I get so ticked off. I am a great believer in giving kids who don’t behave a swift kick or slap in the butt, and I 
just wish more parents had 
felt the same way
My wife and I go to Shands 
at UF about every six to eight weeks, as she has a very seri-ous eye problem. We go to the eye clinic, so she can get injected in the eyeball with a medication. So far, the good 
doctors have saved the sight 
in her one good eye, for which we are very, very thank-ful. Because your articles are printed on Wednesdays, I will try to get her appointments on Wednesday, so I can read your column.
Once again, thanks,

The person who created the double standard be-tween men and women in terms of sexual rela-tions has forever changed our society.
Christina Aguilera put this double standard into lyr-
ics, “The guy gets all the glory the more he can score / 
While the girl can do the same, and yet, you call her a 
whore” in her song “Can’t Hold Us Down.” Aguilera sums up that this double standard makes it socially ac-ceptable for men to have vast sexual experiences with many partners, but it’s unacceptable for women to do the same.
This idea has been heavily instilled in society and can 
be seen across genders as well as within them. I believe this double standard is unfair because there is no reason 
for people to pass judgment on others based upon their 
sexual life, curiosity or experience.
The reality of the double standard allows for a male 
who has sex with many partners to be considered “the man,” but a female who has sex with many partners to be considered a slut. The majority of negative names that are associated with a person who is sexually expe-rienced are directed at females.
Slut, whore, skank, sloot, prostitute, loose, hooker, 
floozy and tramp are just a few of the names in the never-ending list for women. However, when analyz-ing the labels, there are only a few that are restricted to men, and they are not derogatory in nature. These include stud, player and hunk. The negative names that exist for men are derived from the root word for the negative names for women such as man-whore and man-slut. This reiterates the double standard by high-lighting that the most derogatory labels for men come 
from the labels for women, which shows how society 
has a negative connotation for women who are sexually experienced.
Slut-shaming is defined as the action of making 
women feel guilty or inferior for engaging in certain kinds of sexual behaviors that go against traditional gen-der expectations. These gender expectations are derived from the double standard because men and women are encouraged to behave differently in regards to sex.
A woman can become a target for slut-shaming based 
upon the type of clothes she wears, the way she speaks, her reputation or her personality. What makes matters worse is it is not men who are solely responsible for slut-shaming. Here at UF, women are slut-shamed by other women due to com-
mon stereotypes.
For example, females will consider females who 
are in a sorority to be sluts because they socialize with fraternities. Also, women will give other women dirty looks or gossip about them if they are wearing provoca-tive clothing at a bar or at a club. Because the problem of the double standard is occurring among sexes and not just across them, it makes it seem impossible any prog-ress will be made to ensure gender equality.
I came to the realization it was not a person who cre-
ated the double standard, but our culture as a whole. The American way of life has created different stan-dards for the way men and women are supposed to act. In Michael Kimmel’s “The Gendered Society,” he explains “Gendered love, American style” has existed since the mid-19th century.
Love has been separated into two spheres: one for 
men and one for women. The spheres give guidelines 
on how genders have to behave. Women are supposed 
to ignore the physical aspects of love and focus more on talking and feeling, while men are supposed to fo-cus on the shared physical activities and sex when in love. These different styles of loving create the double standard because they cause gender inequality due to pre-existing gender differences.
These gender differences make it acceptable for men 
to engage in sex more often than women because they 
are supposed to be more physical while in love. Soci-
ety expects women to resist and not initiate sex because they are supposed to be more emotional while in love. This double standard will never make sense to me. This subjectivity women face has hindered our society by making women feel inferior if they engage in the same sexual activities men do.
In order for change to happen, more people need to 
be aware of the double standard and think twice before 
they judge others based on traditional gender expecta-
tions.

The Reitz Union expansion 
is still looking for student in-
put.
The Cannon Design team, 
which is designing the renova-
tion, came back to UF earlier 
this month to meet with cam-pus departments and groups who frequently use the build-ing.
UF student MaryLee Pol-
litt, an 18-year-old international studies freshman, said she thinks the Reitz Union needs to add a grocery store for stu-dents.
Kathy Keeter said student 
organizations need more space, especially for dance clubs.
“You’re constantly dodg-
ing people who are dancing throughout the Reitz because no one has a place to practice,” said the 21-year-old political science, Spanish and women’s studies senior.
Head designer of the Mak-
ing it Reitz project Roland Lem-ke said the new extension will be open to students during de-molition of the existing build-ing, which starts in June.
Lemke said UF’s general 
contractor is aware he will have to work around students to 
minimize the noise impact of 
the construction.
“It won’t be completely qui-
et,” he said, “but the contractor will be courteous of the Reitz’s neighbors.”
Lemke said the contractor plans to work as much as pos-
sible in late afternoons and on 
weekends. The team of archi-tects released a virtual tour on the Making it Reitz website in February to show the plans for renovation and expansion.
Nichole Campbell, assistant 
professor in UF’s Department of Interior Design, said the vid-
eo shows the shell of the build-
ing has been designed but the interior hasn’t.
Lemke said the video was 
intended to keep students in-volved in the process.
Construction for the 100,000-
square-foot expansion will start shortly after Summer A classes begin. The project as a whole is planned to be complete by June 2015, Lemke said.
The Orange & Brew restau-
rant will be torn down during Summer but will be redone with a new design by Fall.
During the construction, all 
facilities will stay open, Lemke said. Students will need to relo-cate to the new building in No-vember 2014, when renovation 
to the existing building occurs.
“Students need to know 
the union will never close,” he 
said.8, ALLIGATOR � MONDAY, MARCH 25, 2013

This weekend’s ninth annual UF Relay for Life 
fundraiser raised $130,971.84 for the American Cancer 
Society. A record 93 teams and about 2,400 people par-ticipated in the 18-hour, overnight event despite a sud-den change of venue from Flavet Field to the Stephen C. 
O’Connell Center because of predicted rain.
UF civil engineering senior Meagan Dickey, 23, said 
the last-minute location change forced the staff to shrink 
the campsites but didn’t alter many other plans.
“Everyone was just closer together, which isn’t a 
problem,” she said.
Teams held fundraisers months in advance to raise money for the cause, and they set up activities and games to raise money during the Friday night event.
Participants decorated their campsites for this year’s 
theme, Game for a Cure. Fundraisers included Phi Mu Alpha Sinfonia serenades, the physical therapy pro-gram’s massages, Phi Sigma Rho’s balloon animals and Pre-Dental ASDA’s water pong competition.
Alpha Epsilon Delta was the top fundraising team 
this year. The pre-health honor society raised more than $13,000 and became the first team in UF history to reach jade level, the second-highest fundraising level.
Sarah Johnson, a 21-year-old UF linguistics junior and 
leukemia survivor, spoke at the opening ceremonies.
“I let nothing and no one get in the way of my goals 
and ambitions,” she said. “I knew I had survived for a reason.”
Dickey said the event was a success.

A few years ago, Sharon Bartz had a gentleman walk 
up to her and start touching her three-opossum relief-art 
piece. He was feeling and feeling but couldn’t guess what it was, so Bartz told him.
After the gentleman felt the rest of the art in the gallery, 
he came back to Bartz and thanked her for showing him what opossums looked like.“Now that — that brings tears,” Bartz said.Bartz was one of many artists who brought artwork to 
the sixth annual MindSight at the Samuel P. Harn Museum 
of Art on Saturday. MindSight offers an opportunity for 
individuals who have limited or no sight to experience art through touch.
The art consisted of relief and tactile art, or art that peo-ple can touch. Sitting right by the art pieces, the artists were there to help the visitors feel and understand each piece.
“We do this because you can’t just go into a museum 
and start touching art,” said Rachel Fernandez, the former president of the Gator Lions Club. “And for the blind com-munity, they get to finally experience art.”
MindSight, though, is not just for the visually impaired. 
It offered an opportunity for those who can see to be blind-folded and led around the exhibit.
“For those that can see, when they take the blindfold off, 
they tend to say, ‘This is what I was touching?’” Fernandez said.MindSight offered hands-on art experience for blind“It won’t be 
completely quiet, but 
the contractor will be 
courteous of the Reitz’s

The five women and their chil-
dren who moved out of the recently 
closed Arbor House are now all re-located.
“They’re all doing well,” said 
John Barli, director of Gainesville’s Catholic Charities. “We are continu-ing to keep up with them but not on an official basis.”
In January, Catholic Charities, a 
major source of funds for the shel-ter, announced it wouldn’t renew a 
yearlong donation agreement with 
the house. 
As a result, the women who lived 
in the shelter, located off Northwest Sixth Street, moved out on the week-end of March 2.
The house, which provided tran-
sitional housing and counseling ser-vices for homeless pregnant women, 
shut its doors due to lack of funds.
Three women and their children 
have moved into independent set-
tings — some with relatives.Two of the women and their chil-
dren are staying in a Jacksonville shelter that offers the same services as the shelter in Gainesville, Barli said. A spokeswoman from the cen-ter in Jacksonville said the women are adjusting well.
Barli said the Jacksonville shelter 
is in regular communication with Catholic Charities.
Although Arbor House no lon-
ger has funding, it will not remain shuttered for long.
“I think someone’s going to come along and fill part of that niche,” 
Barli said, “but not necessarily to the 
extent that Arbor House did.”
The schooling and counseling 
services made the house more of a long-term home than an emergency shelter. But plans are under way for the house to start providing similar services again, said Audrie Harris, chair of the Arbor House board.
The grants the house received 
from the county and city have not yet expired. To make use of the funds, the house must serve low-income people in the area, Harris 
said.
She said the board is in nego-
tiations with the city, county and St. 
Francis House. She said the board is hoping St. Francis House will take over responsibility for the house.
“They have plenty of pregnant 
women and women that have small children,” Harris said. “They would 
have no problem filling the beds 
there.”
The organizations are waiting for 
approval from the city and county.

Bridget Sloan set the standard on Saturday in Little Rock, 
Ark.
Sloan, the 2013 Southeastern Conference Freshman of the 
Year, claimed a share of the all-around event title with an in-
dividual total of 39.750 as No. 1 Florida claimed its ninth SEC 
Championship, posting a score of 198 at the Verizon Arena.
The Gators, who tied for first on both balance beam and 
floor, captured their third conference title in the last four years. 
Alabama finished second with a score of 197.9, while LSU was third at 197.7.
“It was down to the wire. I can’t say that I love it like that. It 
was very stressful,” coach Rhonda Faehn said in a release. “It’s 
an incredible thing when it comes down to the last event.”
Bridget Sloan tied for first on 
uneven bars with a 9.95, and she 
became the second straight Gator to win the all-around title at the SEC championship meet. Kytra Hunter took the top prize in 2012. Sloan was the third UF freshman to accomplish the feat.
No Florida gymnast captured an individual event title out-
right on the day, but the collective performance was strong enough to ensure a conference title win.
The No. 3 Crimson Tide came within striking distance and 
was narrowly edged by the Gators down the stretch. Alabama fell shy of the evening’s highest score by 0.1 despite taking the first event — vault — with a 49.55 score.
But Florida responded.Led by Sloan, the Gators countered on every event. Despite 
posting a 49.375 on vault — its lowest total since Jan. 18 versus Missouri — Florida rallied behind three strong events.
In the next rotation, UF posted a 49.5 on uneven bars. Mack-
enzie Caquatto, Marissa King and Sloan each posted scores of 
9.9 or above. But due to SEC scoring, UF was forced to drop its 
highest score and lowest scores, including Sloan’s mark.
Florida used its second-ranked beam average to piece to-
gether a strong 49.5. Sloan hit the highest mark of any UF gym-nast. Caquatto and Ashanee Dickerson anchored the score, both tallying a 9.9.
The momentum carried forward into the final event.Barely ahead of Alabama, Florida produced its third-highest 
floor total this year with a 49.625. It was the highest mark since UF’s rotation registered a 49.7 against Minnesota on March 1.
Each gymnast notched a 9.9 or above for the first time in 
2013, as Florida rolled on for its second consecutive SEC cham-
pionship.

When Hannah Rogers takes the 
circle, it spells bad news for Ar-
kansas. Unfortunately for the Ra-zorbacks, they face Rogers a lot.
Since coming to Florida in 2011, Rogers has dominated Arkansas in every meeting. Rogers pitched in all three games the No. 3 Gators (31-3, 7-2 Southeastern Conference) played against the Razorbacks (21-13, 0-6 SEC) this weekend.
The Gators played a double-
header on Friday after Sunday’s scheduled game was moved due to inclement weather in the fore-cast.
Coach Tim Walton tabbed Rog-
ers to start the first game, and she responded with a run-rule short-ened, complete-game shutout. The 
junior right-hander held Arkansas 
to four hits in six innings while striking out nine batters.“From the bullpen, from the 
very start, I just felt super loose,” Rogers said. “I just felt like the ball was coming off my fingers hard. Everything just felt good.”
For most pitchers, a complete-
game shutout would be enough in a day’s work, but Rogers came back out for double duty in Flori-da’s second game on Friday.
Lauren Haeger started Game 2, 
and after struggling through the first inning, she tossed four score-less frames. Rogers came in to re-lieve the sophomore and put up 
two scoreless innings, striking out 
four in the process.
“I didn’t throw very many 
pitches in the first game, so I think that helped,” Rogers said.
In the series finale, Walton 
gave Rogers the ball again. Game 3 proved to be the closest game of the series, as Rogers and Razor-
backs pitcher Chelsea Cohen each 
pitched six scoreless innings.
The Gators secured the sweep 
when senior Kelsey Horton hit a walk-off home run in the bottom of the seventh.
Rogers dominated Arkansas in 
their final meeting during the 2013 regular season. She only surren-
dered three hits while striking out 
six batters and walking none.
Before the series, Rogers said 
Arkansas had great hitters in its lineup. Coming into Friday’s matchup, Arkansas’ leadoff and two-hole hitters Devon Wallace and Stephanie Canfield were hit-ting .472 and .469, respectively.The duo managed only two hits 
in 14 at-bats against Rogers dur-ing the weekend. They struck out seven times.
“The key to the weekend was 
keeping Wallace off base,” Walton 
said. “In this league, if the leadoff 
batter gets on base, you’ll see how effective they are at scoring.”
But Rogers dominating the Ra-
zorbacks is nothing new for the Gators. 
Florida and Arkansas have 
played nine games since 2011, and Rogers pitched in all of them.
In 2011, she started all three 
games of the series. On April 9, 2011, she surrendered her only run to the Razorbacks in a complete-game win, notching 12 strikeouts in the process.
In 2012, she pitched a shutout 
in the opening game of the series and logged eight innings of score-
less relief the next two days, strik-
ing out 11 batters.
The past three seasons, Rog-
ers pitched 50 innings against Ar-kansas and surrendered only one run to compile a 0.14 ERA. In that time, she averaged 7.98 strikeouts per seven innings pitched.
“She’s constantly gotten better 
with her pitches,” Walton said. “She’s mature, she works hard, she understands her stuff.”
“She loves to compete. I think 
sometimes when you put a runner on base, she takes it to another lev-el, which all the great ones do.”

 After letting a 21-point lead drop to seven 
midway through the second half, Florida held 
on against Minnesota for its third straight Sweet 16 berth. 
  Guard Mike Rosario led the way with 25 
points on 8-of-12 shooting as the No. 3 seed 
Gators (28-7) ﬁ  nished the second half on a 25-
18 run to defeat 11th-seeded Minnesota (21-13) 78-64 on Sunday night in Austin, Texas.
  “I give our guys a lot of credit in terms of 
battling and ﬁ  ghting off that run,” coach Billy 
Donovan said. “We weathered the storm and 
found a way to move on.”    
  UF will travel to Cowboys Stadium in Ar-
lington, Texas, to face No. 15 seed Florida Gulf Coast on Friday in the South Region semiﬁ  -
nals. FGCU defeated seventh-seeded San Di-
ego State for an 81-71 win on Sunday to be-come the ﬁ  rst No. 15 seed to ever advance to 
the Sweet 16. 
  Rosario and senior Erik Murphy sparked 
the Gators early. With Florida and Minnesota 
deadlocked 10-10 in the ﬁ  rst ﬁ  ve minutes, the pair scored 27 of UF’s ﬁ  rst 37 points as the 
Gators went on a 27-5 run during a 10-minute 
span. 
  Murphy ﬁ  nished the game with 15 points 
on 5-of-7 shooting, while Rosario drilled his ﬁ  rst three attempts from behind the arc. 
  “I just felt that I was put in the right situ-
ation at the right time,” Rosario said. “I told myself, ‘I’m not going to hesitate.’ That’s the 
one thing that coach told us going into this 
game, ‘Leave it out there, leave it all on the 
ﬂ  oor.’ I felt that every time I have an open look 
at it, I’m going to take it. They were falling to-
night.”
      Minnesota cut the lead to 39-25 with 3:13 
left in the ﬁ  rst half, but the Gators entered 
halftime with a 48-27 advantage. Florida’s 48 
points break a school record for most ﬁ  rst-half 
points in an NCAA Tournament contest. 
  With a chip on their shoulder, the Golden  Rosario, Gators advance to Sweet 16
END OF GREGULATION
  Removing one 4-minute stretch, the 
Gators’ offense played about as well as it possibly could in Flor-
ida’s 78-64 win against Minnesota on Sunday. 
  UF hit half of its threes and 64.7 per-
cent of its twos.
The Gators made a season-high 26 
free throws in a season-best 36 trips to the line. 
  Excluding the ﬁ  rst 4 minutes of the 
second half, Florida scored an incredible 
1.41 points per possession.   But that 
4-minute stretch 
is the reason 
Florida fans are 
always on the edge of their seats.
The Gators 
missed two threes, two layups and a jumper.
They turned the ball over twice and 
went 2 for 4 at the line.
In eight possessions, Florida scored two points. 
  Even at their best, the Gators will have 
rough offensive stretches.
As a result, a Minnesota team that 
entered with just six wins in its past 17 games trimmed a 21-point deﬁ  cit to 10 in what seemed to be an instant.  
  The Gators will constantly be trying 
to dodge the type of devastating run that can knock them from the NCAA Tourna-ment, and it may be only a matter of time before they slip up for good.  Even at best, Florida not suited to win it all  PHILLIP HEILMAN

 Sydney Moss does not consider her-
self a fan of LeBron James, but she has used facets of the Miami Heat star’s 
game to compliment her own. 
  Like James, who is 6-foot-8 but has 
ball-handling abilities comparable to 
most NBA guards, Moss has a blend of 
size and agility that is difﬁ  cult for many 
opponents to defend.
  “LeBron does that really well because 
he is so much bigger than all 
the other peo-
ple that guard him,” Moss said of James’ ability 
to take advantage of mismatches.
“Whoever is guarding me, I also try 
and pick them apart.” 
  Moss was successful in taking ad-
vantage of her opportunities during a 
75-68 victory against Florida Interna-
tional in the ﬁ  rst round of the WNIT on Thursday. 
  Jerica Coley, the nation’s leading 
scorer, lived up to her billing for the Panthers. Coley scored a game-high 37 points including an 18-of-18 perfor-
mance from the free-throw line during 
the contest. 
  But Moss was equally impressive. 
The freshman guard used an assort-ment of pull-up jumpers, slashes to the 
lane and trips to the foul line to score a 
career-high 28 points on 13-of-23 shoot-ing. 
  Florida trailed 15-4 with 15:54 re-
maining before halftime as Moss strug-gled early. She missed her ﬁ  rst three shots before ﬁ  nishing the half with 12 points while making 5 of her 9 shots.
  Her strong play continued as she 
scored 16 second-half points to help UF stave off a late FIU rally.
  “The ﬁ  rst like 2 or 3 minutes, I think 
I was 0 for 3,” Moss said.
“Then I think I got a layup, and 
whenever I went up, [the defender]  Freshman

Florida’s No. 3 seed in 
the NCAA Tournament is ___________.15% TOO HIGH
12% TOO LOW
73% JUST RIGHT
89 total votessmacked the side of my head, 
and it just started fueling me. I was like ‘Oh, they aren’t calling fouls?’”
The 28-point outburst followed 
a 22-point performance — Moss’ 
previous career-high — during 
Florida’s 82-73 loss to Tennessee in the quarterfinals of the South-eastern Conference Tournament on March 8. 
After scoring 8.1 points dur-
ing Florida’s first 14 conference games, Moss has averaged 18.6 points during UF’s past five con-
tests.
“Her numbers speak for them-
selves,” coach Amanda Butler 
said. 
“She’s had a level of consisten-
cy that demonstrates a high level of play. A lot of double-doubles in the non-conference [games] gave folks a glimpse of what they were 
going to get from her in terms of 
what she is capable of, and she re-ally just has built on that.”
Butler also praised Moss for 
her willingness to spend time go-
ing through game film to identify 
her own strengths and weakness-es. The product of that has been season-long improvements on 
both ends of the floor. 
“The thing that you can’t ap-
preciate because you don’t get to 
see it as much is how much time Sydney has spent watching film, 
how much time she has put in at 
trying to become better at differ-ent elements of her game, (and) realizing where she is best,” But-
ler said.”
The Gators will need Moss to 
continue playing well, as Florida 
travels to Rock Hill, S.C., to face Winthrop tonight at 7.
Winthrop advanced to the sec-
ond round after defeating Florida Gulf Coast 65-51 in the first round of the WNIT on Thursday. 
“I’m a sore loser, so I just don’t 
want to lose,” Moss said. “Know-ing if we lose we are done, I just keep fighting.”

Freshman guard Sydney Moss (40) drives to the basket during Florida 
69-58 win against Arkansas on Feb. 28 in the O’Connell Center. Moss scored a career-high 28 points against FIU on Thursday.
UF’s slumps have typically been reserved for the end 
of games, an unfortunate coincidence that has led to an 
“un-clutch” label. But Sunday’s early slip was equally 
dangerous.  
Just as it was wrong to be terrified of an early flame-
out when the Gators’ play seemed to dip down the sea-
son’s final stretch, feeling that Florida somehow proved 
itself with a strong showing Sunday would be unwise. 
Up-and-down offensive play has been a trend all sea-
son.
A below-average outing has followed four of UF’s 
five most efficient offensive games. When you take as many threes as the Gators do (40.5 percent of attempts) 
and rarely get to the free-throw line (Sunday excluded), sustaining offense can be difficult. 
As has been discussed all season, UF doesn’t have a 
go-to scorer to help it get out of ruts. If Sunday’s 4-min-ute stretch was 6 or 8 minutes long, would the game have turned out differently?
Luckily for the Gators, they have an unbelievably 
easy Sweet 16 game against No. 15 seed Florida Gulf 
Coast. 
Everybody knows FGCU beat Miami, Georgetown 
and San Diego State, but this team also lost to Maine, 
Mercer, East Tennessee State, Stetson and Lipscomb — 
twice. 
All week, you’ll hear that FGCU is for real. And may-
be the Eagles are good. But last year everybody bought into 15-seed Norfolk 
State after it upset Missouri.
Then NSU faced Florida in the second round. After 
just more than 10 minutes, the Spartans were down by 
23. 
UF is by no means guaranteed to blow out FGCU, but 
the early lines that have Florida as an 11-point favorite 
are way too low.
While FGCU is a great story, teams don’t simply im-
prove by a factor of 10 overnight.
Once Florida gets past FGCU, the Gators will still be 
three wins away from a title. Can they drain threes and avoid cold stretches against elite teams for three straight 
games? 
I don’t think so, and a great first weekend against a 
bad Northwestern State squad and a mediocre Minne-
sota team doesn’t change my stance.

Center Patric Young pulls down a rebound during Florida’s 
78-64 win against Minnesota on Sunday in Austin, Texas.
Gophers entered the second half on a hot streak. 
Guard Andre Hollins and the Golden Gophers opened the 
second period on a 19-5 run to cut UF’s lead to 7 points with 
12:36 remaining. Hollins scored nine of Minnesota’s points dur-ing the stretch. 
The Gophers tightened their perimeter defense as the Gators 
opened the first 8 minutes of the second half shooting 0 of 3 from outside the arc.
Murphy picked up his fourth foul with 11:09 remaining and 
sat out more than 8 minutes. 
“I just gathered the guys and said, ‘We just got to get the job 
done right now,’” Murphy said.
But when Hollins picked up his fourth foul with 9:21 left in 
the second half, the Gators began to find their groove. 
In the final 9:21, UF made 12 of its 17 free throws and 3 of its 
5 field-goal attempts. Minnesota went without a field goal from 9:42 to 2:56. 
Florida stretched its lead to 17 with 3:13 left when point 
guard Scottie Wilbekin found Rosario in the right corner for a three-point bucket. Wilbekin finished with 12 points and six as-sists. 
“I commend [Donovan] and my teammates and Scottie Wil-
bekin and the rest of the guys finding me when I was open,” Ro-sario said. “We did a great job just responding to the situation and just taking it and running with it.”
Minnesota won the rebounding battle 29-26, but the Gators 
held the Gophers to 40 percent shooting while finishing the game with a 56.8 percent clip. 
Hollins led the Gophers with 25 points on 8-of-13 shooting 
and made 6 of his 10 three-point attempts. 
Florida is 20-0 this season when scoring at least 70 points. 
Donovan now owns a 30-10 record in the Big Dance, as UF has reached at least the Sweet 16 in five of its past eight seasons. 
The next step for Florida will be this year’s Cinderella in 
Florida Gulf Coast. 
“Right now we don’t know too much about those guys,” Ro-
sario said. “But I’m sure that [Donovan] will break down the next opponent to us and we’re going to … make sure we’re on edge.”HooPS , from page 14Minnesota opened

The Gators ran out of time on 
Sunday in Nashville, Tenn.
No. 2 Vanderbilt (21-4, 5-1 
Southeastern Conference) de-
feated Florida (11-14, 2-4 SEC) 
5-4 in a bizarre series finale. Per 
SEC rules, no inning of a Sunday game can start after 4:15 p.m. EST, which cost the Gators an opportu-nity for their second comeback of the game.
Florida shook off its shortest 
outing from a starting pitcher this year with four straight runs after 
falling behind 2-0. UF appeared to 
be headed toward a series-clinch-ing win until the wind picked up and the skies turned a shade dark-er. A 49-minute weather delay en-sued with Florida leading 4-2 and one out in the top of the fifth. Play resumed at 3:10 p.m.

tered the game in the bottom of the fifth with runners on first and third. Mike Yastrzemski scored from third after Harris balked when his cleat got stuck on the mound mid-delivery. 
Florida mustered just two 
singles following the rain delay. The Commodores, meanwhile, 
took advantage of miscues by 
the Gators. Harris stayed on the mound in the sixth as the rain picked up. 
A wild pitch with two outs to pinch hitter Xavier Turner on a 0-2 count advanced Spencer Navin to third. Navin scored on Turner’s ground ball to Florida shortstop Casey Turgeon.
The sophomore couldn’t make 
the throw in time. Florida experi-enced trouble all weekend adjust-ing to the AstroTurf at Charles Hawkins Field. 
Pinch hitter John Norwood 
plated Yastrzemski on an infield single to Turgeon for the winning run in the seventh off left-hander Daniel Gibson.
“There were a lot of things that 
happened in the last three innings that were uncharacteristic,” coach Kevin O’Sullivan said. “We had been playing good defense as of late. We kicked some balls, (and) that led to a couple of runs.”
The Gators staged their ill-fat-
ed comeback attempt starting in the second with a solo home run by Taylor Gushue. They added three more runs two innings later on a Justin Shafer solo home run, a Zack Powers single and a bases-loaded walk by Brady Roberson. 
Freshman right-hander Eric 
Hanhold started for the Gators, lasting only 25 pitches. Hanhold faced six batters and walked two of them.
Throw in a hit by pitch and sev-
en straight balls in just two-thirds of an inning and O’Sullivan had enough from Harris. Right-hand-
er Johnny Magliozzi followed and 
didn’t allow an earned run in 3.2 innings. 
Sunday was another missed op-
portunity for Florida. The Gators scored three runs in the fourth after having four at-bats with the bases loaded.
When Gibson struck out Navin 
to end the seventh, Florida didn’t have any more chances. Time had run out.
“It was an important game. 
We talked about it yesterday and this morning,” O’Sullivan said. “I thought we came out of the gates good. Obviously (we) didn’t fin-ish it.”
