About 800 dancers cheer after standing for 26.2 hours and raising more than $1.5 million for Children’s Miracle Network Hospitals. Dance Marathon was held in the Stephen C. O’Connell Center from Saturday to Sunday afternoon. Last year’s total was $1,169,722.

by Dance Marathon fund-
raisers paid off. 
This weekend, more than 
800 students stood for 26.2 
hours to raise money for 
Children’s Miracle Network 
Hospitals.
Molly Vazquez, the over-
all public relations chair-woman, said the event 
raised a grand total of about 
$1,528,330 — a more than 30 
percent increase from last year’s total of $1,169,722. 
“Seeing that number is 
just absolutely mind-blow-ing and incredible,” she said. “We put in a full year’s work for it.”
Vazquez, a 21-year-old UF 
public relations senior, said “every single dollar” goes to UF Health Shands Children’s 
Hospital for research, tech-
nology and any diversionary activities — such as videog-ames and art projects — the kids need.“Our dream is to make 
DM the philanthropy of the university,” Vazquez said.
The increase in donations 
was due in part to this year’s creation of an alumni associ-ation, she said, which serves to extend students’ connec-
tions to Dance Marathon 
beyond the four years they spend on campus.
One of these future alumni 
is Kristen Nguyen, a 23-year-old UF biology senior, who danced for the third time this year. 
She stayed on her feet for 
the 26.2 hours and said her passion for the cause kept her going.
“It’s more of a reward-
ing experience, and because of that, you don’t feel that tired,” she said.Dance Marathon raises a record $1.5 million

The rapper turned to the cameras. He 
gave a quick verse:
“You know what I’m saying. This is 
DJ Raffy. This is what we do. I could do 
this all day if I wanted to.”
He really could — it’s a routine. 
Dance. Rap. Repeat.
On Friday evening, about 100 of his 
fans decided to join him.
When word got out that a man at-
tacked Northwest Gainesville’s street performer Tuesday, residents responded by throwing a “Rally for Raffy.”
Rafael Torres, known as DJ Raffy, is a 
22-year-old with mental disabilities. He works at the Williston McDonald’s on 34th Street, and when he’s not there, he’s doing what he loves most.He has a dance ses-
sion at the corner of Northwest 16th Bou-levard and Northwest 43rd Street every eve-
ning, sometimes stop-
ping for a burger at 
the Five Guys nearby. He doesn’t need an exclusive venue, just 
the intersection. His audience is never there for long. They speed by but always make sure to clap or give a few honks here and there.
Surrounded by fans Friday, Raffy 
was in his element.

tiga took a quick break from dancing at the corner. Her bright red shirt was At Rally for Raffy, locals

A Gainesville high school was recently 
ranked in the top 30 of the Washington 
Post’s list of most challenging high schools. 
Eastside High School came in at No. 27 
on the list, up six spots from last year’s re-port.
The Washington Post ranks high schools 
nationwide based on an index score that comes from the number of tests such as Ad-vanced Placement exams and, in Eastside’s case, International Baccalaureate divided 
by the number of graduates that year, ac-
cording to its website.
The ranking also notes the percentage 
of students who come from families that 
qualify for lunch subsidies and the percent-
age of graduates who passed at least one college-level test while attending the high school.
Eastside’s index score for this year is 
8.966. The No. 1 ranked school this year was American Indian Public Charter in Oakland, 
Calif., with an index score of 21.909. 
Even though the school has ranked as 
high as No. 16 in 2007, principal Jeff Char-
bonnet said it will take the bragging rights.
“It’s one measure of the effectiveness of 
a school,” Charbonnet said. ”It certainly doesn’t show everything.”
Eastside offers mentoring and tutoring 
programs and fosters a culture with high 
expectations for all students, he said.
“Our graduation rate is increasing, and 
our percentage of college-bound graduates 
is also increasing,” he said. “Taking those two together shows very positive improve-
ment at our school.” School in Gainesville ranked 
27th most challenging in US

Palestinian and Gainesville fami-
lies came together this weekend to 
raise money and awareness for a proposed school for the deaf in the West Bank, near Palestine.
Gainesville’s Oak Hall School hosted 12 delegates from one of Gainesville’s sister cities in Qalqilya, Palestine, to promote the campaign.
Richard Gehman, Oak Hall’s 
headmaster, said this was the ﬁ  rst time in the program students from Palestine stayed with families of Gainesville students. 
“It’s one thing to talk about glob-al education,” he said. “It’s another thing to have face-to-face interac-tions.”
Steve Kalishman, president of the 
Sister City Program of Gainesville Inc., said the visit will bring atten-tion to the Oak Hall students’ proj-ect to raise about $350,000 to build the school.“There are 43,000 deaf people in 
the West Bank, and right now they can only get a ninth-grade educa-
tion,” Kalishman said. 
He said Gainesville’s relation-
ship with Qalqilya started in 1997 
when delegates from Palestine and the Israeli city of Kfar Saba came to Gainesville looking for help build-ing a water-treatment plant. 
“In the media, everything you 
see about Palestine and Israel is all 
about violence,” Kalishman said. 
“But what gets lost in all that is the majority of people don’t care about all that conﬂ  ict. They want to learn how to live together in peace with their neighbors.”

Pi Kappa Alpha threw a “test” party to measure noise levels 
and passed. City law allowed a 55-decibel maximum for noise at night, and though outside the party reached a high of 72 decibels, UF Interfraternity Council members and Gainesville 
Mayor-Commissioner Courtland Collier agreed the noise was 
not a problem.
April 18, 1994University Police reported ﬁ  nding a three-legged, 9-foot al-
ligator that crawled from Lake Alice to a path near Museum Road. The Florida Game and Fresh Water Fish Commission was supposed to send a licensed trapper to catch the “nui-sance,” but it escaped back into the lake. Children from Baby 
Gator nursery, who were at Lake Alice for an “alligator hunt,” 
were not bothered and wanted the creature to be left alone.
April 14, 2009Karma Cream opened its doors and began serving vegan 
treats. The shop’s owners, Payal Patel and Kyle Fick, had been getting it ready for about a year before its grand opening. Fick said although Gainesville is “a pretty progressive place,” it had been hard to ﬁ  nd vegan desserts in town. “We just assessed a 
need and ﬁ  lled it,” he said.

� POLICE SAID HE SWUNG A BAT.

Gainesville Police arrested a local man after 
he threatened his roommate in a ﬁ  ght over a 
roll of toilet paper.
Ofﬁ  cers arrested 60-year-old Isaiah Carl Bryant on charges of aggravated assault, ac-cording to an arrest report.
At about 9 p.m., Bryant and his roommate 
started arguing about the toilet paper at their house in the 2000 block of Northeast Seventh Avenue. Bryant grabbed a nearby metal bat, threatening to “bust” his roommate’s “brains 
out,” according to the report.
Bryant got ready to swing the bat, and his roommate ran out of the 
house, according to the re-port. Another roommate said he heard Bryant threat-en to hit the victim on the head. The witness also told ofﬁ  cers he heard the sound 
of a metal bat hitting the ground.During questioning, Bryant said he didn’t 
make any threats or bring out a bat, according to the report. But he did admit the argument was over toilet paper and said he owned the bat in question.
Ofﬁ  cers booked Bryant into the Alachua 
County Jail at about 10 p.m. Saturday, where 
he remained as of press time in lieu of a $15,000 
bond.Man arrested for assault after argument about toilet paper

Out of the top 50 high schools 
on the list, 11 were in Florida, 
with the majority in Jacksonville 
and Miami. Texas was the only 
other state with more schools in the top 50.
UF electrical engineering ju-
nior Alon Krauthammer, a 20-year-old Eastside alumnus, said the tough curriculum helped pre-pare him for engineering classes, and students were also encour-
aged to explore all subject areas. 
“Many of the teachers really 
instilled the mindset that you 
have to be well-rounded, and it’s 
important to learn about a vari-ety of things,” he said. 
But Krauthammer said al-
though he enjoyed his time at 
Eastside, rankings don’t take all factors into consideration. 
Rachel Sheahan, a 20-year-old 
UF theater performance sopho-
more, said she graduated from 
Eastside in 2012.
Sheahan, who took part in 
Eastside’s IB program, said she 
agrees the classes were challeng-
ing.
“I think a program like this at-
tracts smart and motivated peo-ple to begin with, but EHS does 
a great job of molding and devel-
oping these people into the best students they can be,” she said.
damp with dark spots. She said the rally 
naturally fell into place, generated from comments on the Gainesville Sun’s article about the attack. 
A Facebook event page formed. The 
First Credit Union bank nearby sent up a tent and water for the event, and a pastor 
reached out to help.
“I have no idea how it came together so 
well,” Antiga said.  
Soon, she ran back into the red-shirted 
crowd of people supporting DJ Raffy.
Pharrell Williams’ “Happy” started 
playing. The crowd clapped to the beat.
“I don’t see everybody clapping!” An-
tiga said. “Are you happy?”
The crowd cheered.
Soon a circle formed, and DJ Raffy bust-
ed moves in the center.
“Raffy! Raffy! Go Raffy! Go Raffy!”Every few seconds, like clockwork, a 
round of car horns blared. For commuters in Northwest Gainesville, 
DJ Raffy isn’t a stranger.
UF adjunct professor Toryn Buckley 
stood at the corner of the rally. She couldn’t stop smiling. Buckley works in UF’s De-partment of Health Education and Human Behavior and passes the intersection on her way home.
“No matter the kind of day you’ve had, 
you cannot help but smile when you see him,” she said. “To hear that somebody harmed him, I think all of us had the same 
reaction: ‘Not in our community.’”
Tuesday evening, Raffy’s adoptive 
mother MaryJean Foss got the call from his 
brother about the attack.
“I couldn’t believe it,” she said.”I was in 
shock.” 
Raffy told Foss about a man threatening 
him for weeks, but he never thought the man would act, Foss said.
Gainesville Police arrested the man, 33-
year-old Jerome Edward Henderson, when he decided to follow through with his threats. He was charged with counts of ag-gravated stalking and abuse of a disabled adult.
At about 7:30 p.m. at the usual corner, 
Henderson started yelling at Raffy and tried to take a swing, so Raffy ran to Five Guys. Henderson followed Raffy, punch-ing him in the face and shoving him into one of the restaurant’s tables, according to an arrest report. He walked out of the res-taurant and threatened to hurt Raffy again if he saw him back on the corner singing 
and dancing. 
During questioning, Henderson said 
Raffy has been menacing people by sing-
ing, dancing and making eye contact at the corner, according to the report.
The day after the incident, DJ Raffy was 
back on his corner, this time joined by May-or Ed Braddy. The two danced together, and Braddy came back Friday for the rally.
“We love what he does,” Braddy said. 
“He brings joy to a lot of people.”
Braddy turned his head.“Oh my god, I gotta get Commissioner 
Chase on tape,” he said. “This will be proof I’m not the worst dancer.”
City Commissioner Todd Chase danced 
a few steps away wearing headphones. Chase said he loves hip-hop, particularly artists like Drake and Wiz Khalifa.
“I live out here. I’ve seen Raffy for al-
most a year,” Chase said. “When I read what happened, it just broke my heart.”
The crowd quieted soon, and the Rev. 
Milford Lewis Griner presented Raffy with 
a certificate and a $25 gift card to Red Lob-
ster.
Raffy started to speak:“I want to thank all my fans out there. 
Gainesville, you know I love y’all,” he said. “I do this for everybody!”
Once again, the crowd erupted in chants. 
The rally lasted a while longer, but soon the music died down, and DJ Raffy was danc-
ing alone at the corner. 
“I feel good when I step on stage,” he 
said. “This is my stage.”4, ALLIGATOR � MONDAY, APRIL 14, 2014

The City of Gainesville is asking 
residents to contribute information to its 
new wiki page. 
A wiki is a website that allows users 
to post and edit information. Gaines-ville’s citizen-driven wiki was created as a way for residents to communicate with each other about anything from trans-portation issues to restaurant specials, said Gainesville City Commissioner Lauren Poe.
“I think it’s important for the city 
to offer multiple ways to be involved with their community,” Poe said. “This has the potential to make the city of Gainesville a better place if residents will get involved.”
Samantha Wolfe, senior analyst in 
Gainesville’s Administration Services 
Department, said the wiki can combine 
a variety of information in one place. For example, a single wiki page can show the local businesses that offer birthday deals, she said. The page would display maps, menus, links to other pages and anything else that might be relevant.
“We want there to be a community-
driven effort to show the great aspects of 
the city of Gainesville,” Wolfe said. 
Justin Marlin, a Gainesville native 
and UF alumnus, said a localized wiki 
will give students, families and visitors the opportunity to find many of the city’s “hidden gems.”
“The wiki would be a wealth of 
information about Gainesville writ-ten and maintained by the heartbeat 
of Gainesville — its residents,” Marlin 
said.Input wanted for city wikicampus

A UF student is leaving for a research proj-
ect in Granada today after raising more than 
half of his goal via crowdfunding.
David Hanson, a fourth-year UF doctoral 
student in geography, had an assignment to 
crowdfund a project for his fundraising for 
tropical conservation and development class. Hanson, 30, decided to use the assignment to help finance his previously planned trip, dur-ing which he will study the social vulnerability of farmers to environmental hazards.
Hanson raised $1,085 of his $2,000 goal us-
ing RocketHub, an online crowdfunding plat-form. Donations were accepted for about a 
month and closed Wednesday.
“It’s actually pretty radical,” Hanson said. 
“I’ve never heard of other students using it.”
He said he knew most of the people who 
donated — friends, friends of friends, profes-
sors — but there were a couple strangers.
“It’s actually surprising me how much I’ve 
gotten so far,” Hanson said.He said he received grants to cover his re-
maining expenses.
Eric Keys, an assistant professor of geogra-
phy and Hanson’s adviser, said most students receive grants from the National Science Foun-dation, the National Institutes of Health, NASA and similar organizations.
“It’s interesting,” he said about Hanson’s 
use of crowdfunding. “It’s innovative for him 
to do that because it certainly wasn’t my idea.”
Hanson said his trip is scheduled through 
April 28. He said he has never been to Granada 
but hopes to evaluate the environmental and social status of the developing country. Hanson said his plan is to speak with government lead-ers and local farmers.
“I want to get an understanding of the prob-
lems farmers face on a daily basis,” he said. 
“I’ve read about it, but I want to experience it 
myself.”UF crowdfunder goes to Granada

A small crowd gathered to 
take a peek at Ava’s ultrasound. 
Almost a week before giving 
birth, the chestnut pony took part 
in a medical demonstration at 
Saturday’s annual UF College of 
Veterinary Medicine open house.
The event, hosted by the col-
lege’s 2015 graduating class, 
included guided tours of the college grounds, free ice cream and a teddy bear clinic where kids could patch up their furry 
friends.
Natalie Isaza, UF College of 
Veterinary Medicine clinical as-
sociate professor, said the event 
was an avenue for the commu-
nity to get a behind-the-scenes view of the school.
“There is a lot of misconcep-
tion about what goes on at the vet school,” she said. “People think we do animal research. We are all 
about helping animals.”
The horses were a popular at-
traction at the open house.  Families squeezed together 
and held their young ones atop 
their shoulders to catch a glimpse of the horse treadmill demo.  But one tiny group of horses 
captured all the attention. 
Sweetheart, Hamlet and Mag-
ic, from the Gentle Carousel Min-iature Therapy Horses nonprofit, 
took part in the event for the first 
time.
Parents lined up to take pic-
tures with Sweetheart cuddling up to their children. 
Hamlet and Magic were cho-
sen as 2014 Breyer model horses, making them this year’s inspira-tion for the company’s plastic toy 
horses.
Debbie Garcia-Bengochea, co-
founder of Gentle Carousel, said 
many people were not aware that the nonprofit is based in 
Gainesville.
“We would like to do more 
with the university,” she said.
Larissa Menke, a 21-year-old 
UF marine sciences senior, said 
the event was a good way for the college to showcase its pro-grams.
“It shows people that it’s not

Almost three years after a local orga-
nization began its fight to end Gainesville 
support for mountaintop-removal coal mining, its work and advocacy are begin-ning to pay off: A city commissioner has 
joined the charge.
For years, activist group Gainesville 
Loves Mountains has been pushing for 
Gainesville Regional Utilities to stop us-ing coal mined from the tops of the Appa-lachian Mountains. The practice uses less manpower but strips natural resources. The group asserts the process destroys the envi-ronment and nearby towns with explosions and contaminated water.
City Commissioner Lauren Poe, who 
said he has supported the initiative since 2008, will give a presentation in a commis-sion meeting Thursday, where he will urge GRU to sever connections with mountain-top-removal coal. Instead, it could switch to deep-mined coal.
Poe said one of the issues that could 
cause opposition is the possibility of a price increase. 
But, Poe said, the proposed ordinance 
has a restriction written in that could curb increases. 
“I think there’s starting to be concerns 
about upward rates or circumstances where deep-mined coal is more expensive than MTR coal,” he said. “Ultimately, I have a safeguard in there that says if deep-mined 
coal is more than 5 percent (more) expen-sive than MTR coal, then staff can bring 
that to city commission and can override that policy.”
Jason Fults, co-founder of Gainesville 
Loves Mountains, said the motion will be successful if four commissioners vote for 
it.
Fults said the “escape clause” in the mo-
tion gives the city flexibility.
“If GRU is complying with that, (only 
purchasing deep-mined coal) and it in-
creases prices by more than 5 percent, they can come back to the city and ask about it on a case-by-case basis,” he said.
Fults said he thinks the ordinance will be 
successful if those who support the cause attend the meeting. City commissioner joins fight against GRU’s coal mining“There is a lot of 
misconception about what 
goes on at the vet school. 
People think we do animal 
research. We are all about 
helping animals.”

Friends of the Library book sale?Today’s question: Did you participate in Dance 
Marathon? #ftkFlorida’s 
guns-and-riots bill 
cause for worry
The Florida House passed an insane new bill regarding 
guns and riots last week, prompting Cliff Schecter of the Daily Beast to say, “you could call Florida the Grand Ole 
Opry of gun nuttery.”
He’s not far off. HB 209, a bill that, according to the Miami 
Herald, “would allow people with clean criminal backgrounds to carry concealed ﬁ  rearms during emergencies declared by the governor or local ofﬁ  cials,” including natural disasters, riots and civil unrest. The bill’s backers say the measure will give gun owners the chance to protect their property during disas-ters.
On the surface, it sort of makes sense. A Tampa Bay Times 
columnist pointed out that people are actively encouraged to bring their ﬁ  rearms with them when evacuating their homes — 
but only if the guns are kept in glove compartments or locked 
cases. 
The politics of concealed-carry licensing are rocky to begin 
with. The Violence Policy Center, a research institute, has stat-ed that resources for comprehensive data on non-self-defense killings by private citizens legally allowed to carry concealed handguns is limited. The organization has maintained a data-base since May 2007 of each non-self-defense-related concealed-carry killing broken down by state. As of March 11, the count 
was up to 636 total in the overall U.S. 
Proposing a ban on all concealed-carry licensing is extreme. 
But on the other hand, expanding the rights of gun owners who 
don’t have concealed-carry permits is just ludicrous. And it’s not as if the bill outlines speciﬁ  c guidelines; if anything, the big-gest criticism of the bill is its looseness when it comes to inter-pretation. 
“A key objection is that it’s not clear in the legislation when 
it’s okay not to have a permit for the concealed ﬁ  rearm,” the 
Miami Herald reported. “Both bills say no permit is needed for 
those ‘in the act of complying with a mandatory evacuation or-der during a declared state of emergency.’
“If someone ﬂ  ees a hurricane and travels several counties 
over, either to a hotel or relative’s house, at what point are they still evacuating? For how long are they able to claim they are evacuating?”
Another troubling addition to the House version of the guns-
and-riots bill is its provision that would allow local ofﬁ  cials to 
declare a state of the emergency — not just the governor. 
“There is a reason the state requires permits to carry con-
cealed weapons,” Times columnist  John Romano wrote. “Fin-
ger prints. Background checks. Photo IDs. Safety classes. A person with a concealed permit has to demonstrate a certain responsibility. Someone joyriding during a riot or a hurricane should not have the same privileges.”
That the bill was championed by the National Riﬂ  e Associa-
tion comes as no surprise, and the question we face now is how 
long special interests will affect gun policy in Florida. 
Hopefully we won’t have to get to 637 to ﬁ  nd out. Home run king speaks truth about Obama
Home run king Henry “Hank” Aaron shed his qui-
et demeanor last week, chastising Republicans for derailing President Barack Obama’s agenda. 
Aaron — like many — believes the vitriol many spew at Obama has less to do with political disagreements and 
more to do with race. 
In an interview with USA Today, Aaron said, “the 
bigger difference is that back then they (Obama’s oppo-
nents) had hoods. Now they have neckties and starched shirts.”
It was a shocking comment from an athlete who’s al-
ways had a reasonably quiet persona, even as he faced death threats and hate mail in 1974 as he approached Babe Ruth’s home run record. However, Hammerin’ 
Hank has a point, and it’s something we should all con-
sider as we determine this country’s future.
Were Aaron’s comments a bit extreme and hyperbol-
ic? Absolutely. But after ﬁ  ve years of incessant obstruc-tionism and anger spewed at Obama like a cobra’s ven-om, there’s more to it than simple disagreement with his policies. So in that regard, Aaron’s comments are worth noting and perhaps give us a launching point for further discussion on the future of the U.S. 
Has Obama pursued an agenda that is risky and a 
change of pace for a country that spent the previous eight years under the conservative tutelage of the George W. Bush administration? 
Without a doubt; but isn’t that why a majority of vot-
ers in both the 2008 and 2012 elections cast ballots in sup-port of Obama and his agenda?
The trends in the U.S. are unmistakable. It is becom-
ing a more diverse nation that is slowly but surely less 
dominated by white males. Obama’s election presented a 
scary prospect for the white males who ruled the Western world for centuries: White male dominance over western governments is slowly being eroded. 
What happens when we’re scared? We react with an-
ger.  
Obama’s election was historic, and maybe we’ve spent 
too much time dissecting what that victory meant for the country — or perhaps not enough. Regardless, we’ve en-tered an era that, putting aside the president’s agenda, is still dominated by the discussion of 
race, and now we masquerade 
race relations in America as a debate on the issues. 
Last week, Obama, along 
with four former U.S. presi-
dents, spent time in Texas honoring the legacy of Lyndon Johnson and the monumental Civil Rights and Voting Rights acts. In an interview with NBC News, Rep. John Lewis, D-Georgia, said without the policies pursued by 
Johnson, it’s likely Obama would not be president today. 
Although it’s obvious we’ve come a long way since the days when people like Lewis were beaten while standing up for what is right, the contempt some show for our cur-rent president proves we have a long way to go. 
If a baseball icon who rarely, if ever, spoke out on 
the issue of race relations in America decided now was the time to make a statement, perhaps we should listen. Aaron may not be the most eloquent or politically savvy, 
but he has a point. 
After ﬁ  ve years, enough people in this country have 
masked their own hatred for Obama as nothing more 
than a political ﬁ  ght. It’s capitalism versus socialism, Americanism versus communism — but it’s not that sim-ple. The ﬁ  ght today is not about what we say or do but about our innermost demons that we constantly ignore. Until we’re ready to face it, we’ll never get past it. 
It’s easy to say this is nothing more than a liberal call-
ing conservatives racist, but that’s not the point. 
After the death threats, hate mail and everything Aar-
on dealt with on his quest for 715 home runs, he ﬁ  nally had the courage to stand up and say what needed to be said.

The weather is starting to heat up, and 
students are shedding their polar vor-tex sweaters for muscle tanks, crop tops, 
swimsuits and anything that shows off their midriffs or deltoids.
With all the exposed skin, one thing is on 
everybody’s minds: sex.
But with the stress of ﬁ  nals and the short 
time left before people move away for good — or just for the summer — no one has time to dedicate to a relationship.
I’m proposing an easy solution: no-strings-
attached sex.
No-strings-attached, or NSA, sex is a great 
trick for when you want to have sex but don’t want to have any of the emotional baggage that might come with it. It’s like an agreement between two — or sometimes more — people that the relationship is strictly for sexual plea-sure.
There are three basic subgroups for NSA 
sex. In order of least responsibility and attach-ment, there’s your standard one-night-stand, 
the f**kbuddy and the ever-so-reliable friends 
with beneﬁ  ts.
For all three, though, the biggest issue is initiation. I think we can all agree that the “Want to come over and watch a movie?” trick is a bit overdone.
Yes, that’s the standard code 
for hooking up, but it’s still un-clear. And I can’t be the only one who’s tired of only getting to watch the ﬁ  rst half of movies and having to look up the rest of the plot on IMDb in the morning.
There’s a better solution, but it seems to dif-
fer based on gender.
Here’s a tip for the gentlemen: Offer incen-
tives. Getting ready for a booty call is a pro-cess. Females are expected to shower, shave and ﬁ  nd clean underwear that generally in-volves some form of lace, silk or mesh.
Sometimes, it’s a lot easier and far more en-
ticing to sit on your couch in pajamas watch-ing “House of Cards” on Netﬂ  ix.
So offer us something in return for our 
trouble. Yes, an orgasm is great, but dig a little 
deeper. Tell your lucky lady you just ordered 
a pizza, that you just picked up some wine or that you just acquired some sweet new vinyl.Snacks, alcohol and chill jams can please almost anybody.
On the ﬂ  ip side, girls need 
to be more direct. I asked some of my male friends what they 
would prefer, and they all agreed 
girls should just be forthright.
One said, “There’s no better 
feeling [than] when a guy ﬁ  nds a girl attractive and that girl says 
she wants to have NSA sex.”
Another said if a female asks to have sex, 
the answer will usually be yes.
For both genders, if you are already friends 
with the person in question, or if you have al-ready hooked up with him or her, the process might be a lot easier. You might just be able to get away with sending a “Come over?” text.
If you already feel comfortable, you could 
arguably even send a, “Yo, you wanna f**k?” text.
Regardless of how you initiate, make sure 
the end goal is clear. You should both be on 
the same page of where this ﬂ  ing is going and 
clarify that it is casual. 
It’s awkward if one of you is in it for the sex and one is in it because he or she thinks it will lead to a relationship.
When you do initiate, don’t sound desper-
ate. Come off as conﬁ  dent, and you’re more likely to be successful.
Some other last-minute tips? Make sure to 
change your sheets before the lucky lady or lad comes over. Stained sheets don’t scream sexy.
And always, always make sure to use pro-
tection. I also recommend having a quick con-versation about what sexual acts are off-limits. Your partner is less likely to agree to NSA sex in the future if you do something that makes 
him or her uncomfortable.
Remember that NSA sex should be fun, 
easy and, most of all, drama-free. If you’ve 
found that your partner wants to talk about his or her day or feelings or that he or she comes over just to hang out, it’s no longer no-strings-attached.
Sorry, friend, you’ve found yourself in a 
relationship. You’ll have to consult another 
guide for that.

Rumors are killing the credibility of the news me-
dia, and I am calling on you, dear reader, to stop being an accomplice to it.
It’s a trend that seems to be as 
addictive as alcohol within the modern news media, but it has a plague potential of the Black 
Death. 
The recent search for the miss-
ing airliner in the sea near Australia is an obvious ex-
ample but is in no way a unique one. 
Comedian Stephen Colbert even referenced the issue 
of rumors within media while responding to the Twitter controversy that recently hit his show.
“CNN even took a break from their Malaysian airliner 
coverage to spot what they thought was the wreckage 
of my show off the coast of Australia,” Colbert said last 
week.
When I turn on CNN, I see “experts” providing op-
tions and theories, which are then quoted as “facts” by news media and taken out into the world, dispersed on the web like dandelion seeds blown by a child into the 
wind.
Where do you, dear reader, turn when all you see 
as you look to major news networks is people arguing 
about their opinions?
When you turn to the sports media and they’re talking 
about how the color of one team’s jersey might affect the outcome of the game (like ESPN recently did before the Super Bowl), or when you turn on national news media like Fox or CNN and they are calling something “break-
ing news” that was reported in extreme detail last week 
or the week before, turn it off.
The only way news outlets get feedback from their 
readership is by watching how many people are watch-ing them. 
To stop the ﬂ  ow of rumors, the strongest signal you 
can send is to turn it off until you can hear some truth.

OVERLAND PARK, Kan. — A 
man in his 70s opened ﬁ  re Sunday 
outside a Jewish community center and nearby retirement community, killing three people.
Overland Park Police Chief John 
Douglass said Sunday that a per-son who had been reported to be in critical condition earlier was among three killed in the attacks, which ap-parently occurred minutes apart.
“Today is a sad and very tragic 
day,” Douglass said. “As you might imagine, we are only three hours into this investigation. There’s a lot 
of innuendo and a lot of assertions 
going around. There is really very little hardcore information.”
Shots were ﬁ  red behind the Jew-
ish Community Center of Greater Kansas City in a parking lot at about 1 p.m., Douglass said. One male died at the scene, and another male died at a hospital. The gunman then 
ﬂ  ed and opened ﬁ  re at nearby Vil-
lage Shalom, killing a female, before being arrested near an elementary school. He shot at two other people, but the gunﬁ  re missed them, Doug-lass said.
Douglass said it was too early 
in the investigation to determine if the shootings were hate crimes. The Jewish festival of Passover begins Monday.
“We know it was a vicious act 
of violence, and we know obvi-ously it was at two Jewish facilities. One might make that assumption,” 
Douglass said.
He said the suspect is being held 
at the Johnson County Detention 
Center.Three dead after Kansas City shooting� THE BOOK SALE RUNS

Louise Marra had been sit-
ting in the same chair in the 
same parking lot for about 
24 hours as the line wrapped 
around North Main Street and Northwest Sixth Avenue in downtown Gainesville.
Marra, 75, was waiting 
with hundreds of others Sat-urday morning to buy used books, art, games and more at the Friends of the Library 
book sale.
The sale, staffed entirely 
by volunteers, began with the 
ceremonious playing of bag-
pipes and will end Wednes-
day. The money raised from the sale, which Friends of the Library President Susan Park estimated will be about 
$150,000, will go to the Alach-
ua County Library District.
The sale is an important 
tradition for Gainesville and 
out-of-town book enthusi-
asts.
Marra said she has made 
the drive from the Ocala Na-tional Forest to Gainesville 
twice a year since 2001 to at-
tend the sale.  
She usually gets in line 
two nights before the sale be-gins, she said, but this year she arrived at 8 a.m. the day 
before. Friends of the Library 
did not allow people to hold spots in line, so attendees had to stay there the whole time to secure a spot.
It’s worth getting there 
early because, “If you’re not up front, everything’s gone before you get in,” Marra 
said.
Gainesville native Rob-
bie Davis, 44, said he has not 
missed a sale since fourth grade. He started volunteer-
ing there while he was in col-
lege. 
The ﬁ  rst book he priced 
turned out to be one of his old 
books, he said. His name was 
inside in his handwriting.
Davis said the sale is spe-
cial because of the cheap prices.
“It puts books in the 
hands of a lot of people who may not usually get them,” he said.
For the past ﬁ  ve years, UF 
English senior Ashlyn Roth-enberg said she has arrived at 6 a.m. the ﬁ  rst day with a cup of Dunkin’ Donuts coffee.
Rothenberg, 22, called the 
book sale “the Black Friday for bibliophiles.”
“You get to see people 
excited about buying used books, which is nice,” she said.Readers ﬂ  ock to book

Bryan Shelton and the UF 
men’s tennis team upset Kentucky on Sunday. Read the story online at alligatorSports.org. Wambach injured
Former UF soccer player Abby Wambach missed her NWSL season opener with the Western New York Flash due to a fractured orbital bone below her left eye.Adam Lane followed coach Will Muschamp’s postgame press con-ference as the ﬁ  rst player to speak. 
Muschamp quipped about Lane’s height, saying he needed to stand up so the report-ers could see him.
Lane, at 5-foot-
7, was already 
standing. Mus-champ told Solo-
mon Patton the 
same thing last 
year following his 
two-touchdown 
performance in a 
20-point win against Arkansas. On Satur-
day, Orange tied Blue or Blue tied Orange, depending on how one judges that kind of thing. Muschamp, rocking a white visor, appeared relaxed and relieved. The new of-
fense he promised looked good.
But for as many shotgun snaps as Jeff 
Driskel took in the Swamp, one fact re-
mained clear as Lane garnered a three per-son-deep media crowd: The running game still matters. It will make or break Kurt Roper’s spread offense.
“It’s great, because we all have our dif-
ferent types of running styles. We ﬁ  t per-fect like a puzzle in this offense,” Lane said. “I feel like it’s going to be great next year.”
Those pieces were all UF had last season. 
Incumbent starter Kelvin Taylor returns, as does all-purpose back Mack Brown. Redshirt freshman Lane represents the UF doppleganger of Maurice Jones-Drew. Junior Matt Jones, out this spring because of a knee injury, gives UF a receiving op-tion from the backﬁ  eld. And don’t forget 
Driskel, who can win games with his legs

Driskel befuddled a Vanderbilt defense 
in Nashville two years ago with a quar-terback school record 177 rushing yards and three touchdowns. The passing game in 2013 looked like it came straight from a 1950s football highlight reel, but Florida’s 
identity doesn’t change by changing coor-
dinators.

Florida showcased its new 
up-tempo offense during the 
Orange and Blue Debut on Saturday, and coach Will Mus-champ liked what he saw in Ben Hill Grifﬁ  n Stadium.
“Extremely pleased with 
the day offensively and the 15 practices how far we’ve come,” he said. “I attribute a lot of that to Kurt Roper and an offensive staff and the job they’ve done. Our kids have been very recep-
tive and they have conﬁ  dence 
in what we’re doing and I think it’s a good ﬁ  t.”
In the game, which ended 
in a 23-23 tie, Jeff Driskel took 
all of the ﬁ  rst-team snaps at 
quarterback, completing 19 of his 33 passes for 171 yards and a touchdown.
The redshirt junior’s lone 
touchdown came in the sec-ond quarter. On third and 3 from the Orange 31-yard line, Driskel threw a pass to Demar-
cus Robinson up the middle. 
The sophomore wide receiver 
outran freshman Jalen Tabor and juked Duke Dawson on his way to the end zone, cap-ping off a six-play, 65-yard drive in which Driskel went 3 for 4 and accumulated 54 pass-ing yards.
“As a quarterback, when 
you’re in a no-huddle type deal you can really get into a rhythm,” Driskel said. “We do have a lot of quick game and when you start getting completion, completion after completion it kind of builds 
your conﬁ  dence and gets you 
in a rhythm that sometimes 
is tough for the defense to break.”
Skyler Mornhinweg and Will Grier alternated drives for the Orange team. Mornhinweg went 14 of 18 for 149 yards and two touchdowns. Grier completed 8 of 15 passes for 
72 yards and threw the lone in-
terception of the game to Nick 
Washington on a miscommu-nicated play.
Grier struggled on his ﬁ  rst drive with his only completion going to the defense, but he re-bounded on his next opportu-nity. The early enrollee went 4 of 5 for 37 yards on his second 
drive, leading the Orange team 
to three points on an Austin 
Hardin ﬁ  eld goal.

Youth is the key word in the Gators’ 
wide receiving corps.
Although redshirt senior Quinton 
Dunbar is Florida’s leading returning re-
ceiver, a trio of sophomores will ﬁ  ll sev-eral key spots this upcoming season.
Second-year receivers Ahmad Ful-
wood, Demarcus Robinson and Chris Thompson united to make the largest impact on the Orange and Blue Debut on Saturday in Ben Hill Grifﬁ  n Stadium.
“It’s a huge part for our receiving 
corps because, I mean, we lost Trey Bur-ton and [Solomon Patton], so those are two great players,” Fulwood said. “We understand that you know we have to step up and we have to make forward movement in our play.
“So we’re work-
ing hard, you know, we’re tak-ing those ﬁ  rst-team 
reps, splitting them so we’re just doing a really good job with it.”
The trio racked up a combined 114 re-
ceiving yards on 11 receptions Saturday. Robinson and Thompson both caught 
touchdowns.
Fulwood made the biggest impact for 
Florida last season, making 17 catches for 
127 yards.“Ahmad Fulwood, he’s a huge target 
out there,” quarterback Jeff Driskel said. “He’s improved his ball skills every day since he’s been here.”
Robinson was expected to play a ma-
jor role in the offense last year but instead got suspended twice and made only ﬁ  ve catches for 23 yards.
Because he got the ball more than any 
freshman receiver in 2013, Fulwood has some of the biggest expectations placed on him, but he tries not to put them on himself.
“We just like to play,” he said. “We 
really don’t talk about expectations, we Sophomore wide receivers leading the

just know that the ball is going to be spread 
around and we’re going to move the ball and we’re going to put points on the board. 
And that’s what we want to do.”
The group of receivers will have a much 
bigger role to play in this year’s offense. 
New offensive coordinator Kurt Roper is 
looking to speed the offense up and bring in 
a spread-style attack.
Fulwood has experience playing in the 
spread. When he attended Jacksonville Bishop Kenney High, he played in a similar 
scheme.
“I ran the spread in high school,” he said. 
“But we never did no-huddle. … The pace 
that we move at, taking that year off last 
year of not being in that type of offense and 
then coming back to it, I got to catch back 
up.”
Unlike last year when the Gators went 
with a run-heavy approach, the ball is go-ing to be in the air often this season — and Fulwood is going to be one of the biggest targets.
“It’s definitely comforting to know the 
ball is going to be spread around and defi-nitely have a chance to make some plays when you do get it,” Fulwood said. “Rope’s 
always got something up his sleeve. He’s al-
ways got something cool to do.
“It’s definitely exceeded my expectations 
because it’s a lot faster than what you could ever anticipate for. There’s no conditioning, 
no type of running that could prepare you 
for this type of tempo of an offense.”MONDAY, APRIL 14, 2014 � ALLIGATOR, 13

Florida sat Fowler, Hargreaves to give young players repetitions
put on a solid performance during 
the Orange and Blue game, accru-ing a team-high 12 carries and 64 yards and making three catches out of the backfield for 12 yards.
“You never really know how 
good he is until you see him live,” Driskel said. “He’s a guy that not too many people are going to want to tackle.”
Muschamp held cornerback 
Vernon Hargreaves III and Buck 
linebacker Dante Fowler Jr. out of 
the spring game, forcing younger defenders to step into the limelight.
The fourth-year coach noticed 
the inexperience in the second-ary, but he also mentioned that the group has the talent to be success-ful.
“I’d rather coach a really talent-
ed inexperienced guy than a guy 
that can’t play,” Muschamp said. 
“So I like where our talent level is as far as that is concerned.”
Muschamp also wants to see 
some improvement along the de-fensive line moving forward.“We’ve got a long way to go 
up front defensively,” Muschamp said. “When Darious Cummings and Leon Orr aren’t in there, we 
have a huge drop off to our next 
group. Jon Bullard can play inside, but we get a little thin on the edges when he’s playing inside and he’s a really good nickel rusher, so we’ll continue to look at that.”

Gators utilizing multiple backs
gained more than 200 rushing yards a 
game. Florida in 2006 was the last to not do so. UF managed 145.8 rushing yards per game in an injury-plagued 2013 sea-son that saw Jones and two offensive line starters have season-ending injuries. 
Roper remarked Thursday that there’s 
a shift toward spacing out offenses and working from the middle out instead of vice versa, which UF tried ad nauseam last year. Seemingly everything went up the middle. 
Roper wants his players in space. Flor-
ida had one formation on Saturday with wide receiver Demarcus Robinson in the backfield with a running back and Driskel. 
The offensive possibilities are endless with 
that trio. Muschamp mentioned getting some duo of Jones, Lane and Taylor on the field at the same time. 
“It’s about getting your best 11 out 
there. As those guys continue to improve, I think we could see that happening,” Muschamp said. 
“The run game, again, hasn’t truly 
changed a lot. It’s all from the gun, but not a lot has changed from blocking schemes.” 
It’s no secret Muschamp brought Rop-
er in to improve Driskel as a quarterback. Muschamp consulted with Archie Man-ning in the offseason to see how Roper turned Eli Manning into an elite college quarterback.
Florida gave glimpses of what to expect 
offensively in 2014, but whether Driskel channels Eli throwing the football won’t matter. He dropped 15 pounds this offsea-son to become more elusive in and out of the pocket. His running coupled with his running backs will help more than any-thing.
They are Florida’s best offensive play-
makers. They’ll give Driskel more time to throw. They’ll help drain the clock. They’ll be what makes Florida go. Let’s not forget about them.

Florida’s series-clinching win 
against South Carolina was a 
group effort.
The No. 15 Gators (23-13, 9-6 
Southeastern Conference) used seven pitchers in their 6-5 win against the No. 5 Gamecocks (28-7, 8-7 SEC) on Sunday in Columbia, 
S.C.
Sophomore left-hander Danny 
Young got the start for Florida and 
pitched only two innings. Young didn’t pitch poorly, surrender-ing only one unearned run on 
three hits in two innings of work, 
but coach Kevin O’Sullivan had a quick hook. 
O’Sullivan brought in former 
starter Karsten Whitson, who had his best relief outing of the season. The redshirt junior tossed 2.2 in-nings and gave up an unearned run in the fifth inning.
After Whitson tossed two score-
less frames, he gave up a double to USC catcher Grayson Greiner. Designated hitter Taylor Wid-ener followed with a ground ball, which Richie Martin fielded and hurled to first. The first-base um-pire, Terrence Mobley, ruled Wid-ener out at first, but then convened 
to discuss the call with the other 
umpires, who eventually ruled him safe.
The decision cost UF a run, 
as left fielder Patrick Harrington drove in Greiner soon after.That was one of five errors Flor-
ida committed Sunday. Of South Carolina’s five runs, four were un-earned. 
But the Gators’ offense pound-
ed their way back into the lead. 
Catcher Taylor Gushue keyed 
off UF’s biggest rally of the day with a single with one out in the 
eighth inning. Right fielder Braden 
Mattson followed with a single of his own, and designated hitter A.J. Puk singled to load the bases.
Third base-
man Peter Alonso 
drove in Gushue and Mattson on a fielder’s choice 
and an error. 
First baseman Zack Powers, who has been mired in a sea-
son-long slump, followed with his second double of the season, driv-ing in the third run of the inning.
Left fielder Buddy Reed closed 
out the scoring with an RBI sin-gle. By the time the Gamecocks escaped the inning, their 4-2 lead had evaporated.
“Going down early against 
a team like South Carolina isn’t fun,” Gushue said in a release. “We showed some resilience and grit the past two days. It’s definite-
ly not easy to play here with the 
crowd, especially against a really good ball club.”
Eric Hanhold, the Gators’ sev-enth pitcher of the day, came in to pitch the eighth and sealed the game in the ninth, getting a 1-2-3 inning to close out the game.“You’ve got to make some 
big pitches in key situations,” O’Sullivan said in a release. “We used seven different pitchers to-day, and Eric made some big pitches in the ninth to keep it right there for us and never gave them a chance at the end.”

With the nostalgia of Senior Day linger-
ing and the pressure to stay undefeated in 
the American Lacrosse Conference appar-ent, Florida came out ready to take the win Sunday.
Junior Shannon Gilroy made assists, 
freshman Sammi Burgess scored the goals and Lauren Lea recovered ground balls. Each player on the field had her role to play in keeping Florida (14-2, 5-0 ALC) undefeat-ed in the ALC.
With only one conference game left in 
the regular season, the Gators’ 14-9 win against unranked Vanderbilt (4-10, 1-4 ALC) brought them just one game closer to finishing the conference without a loss.
Coach Amanda O’Leary said the game 
was one of the harder fought wins of the season.
“I don’t think the score was indicative of 
the game,” O’Leary said. “I think this was a much closer game.”
No. 4 Florida’s Burgess and Gilroy man-
aged to set new records during its match-up.
Burgess, who has struggled to complete 
shots since March 26 at Stetson, scored a career-high four goals for the day. She fin-ished the game with five points after assist-ing on a goal.
Gilroy, even if she hasn’t shown it in 
her performances, has also struggled fight-ing off defenders to make big goals for the Gators. 
The junior fought against face guards all 
season, and Sunday’s game against Vander-bilt was no different.
“I’m just looking to do the best I can to 
get away from them,” Gil-
roy said. “I know the dou-ble team and triple team are going to be there, so then that gives me the op-portunity to pass to my 
teammates and look for 
the layup.”
Even while Gilroy 
fought against a face guard, she managed to 
get two goals for the day and took the sin-gle-season points record from former team-mate Kitty Cullen, who notched 86 in 2011. Gilroy now has 88.
Lea is a player who has been consistent 
on draw controls and ground balls all sea-son. She and junior Nora Barry are the play-ers who O’Leary refers to as a “difference maker” in games and are some of Florida’s most important players.
“Lauren is going to be that player that 
does the dirty work,” O’Leary said. “You’re not going to see her in the box score very often, but where you are going to see it is on the ground balls, on the draw controls. The difference makers, as I would say, in the games.”
With players like Burgess, Lea and Gil-roy and the performances they bring to the game, Florida could close out its season 
with only two losses.
Burgess said Florida’s speedy offense is 
looking to continue scoring on fast breaks, 
which have resulted in quick points for UF all season. Burgess and Gilroy are two play-ers who have done well in fast-break situ-ations.
“When we transition that ball fast on a 
fast break, it’s unstoppable,” Burgess said. “If we continue to do it, we keep the fast-pace ball movement, I think there is no chance that we can lose.”MONDAY, APRIL 14, 2014 � ALLIGATOR, 15

Jeff Driskel took to Florida 
Field during Saturday’s Orange 
and Blue Debut for the first time 
since suffering a season-ending fractured fibula against Tennes-
see on Sept. 21, 2013.
Even though it was the last 
time he had a chance to play at Ben Hill Griffin Stadium, the red-
shirt junior said the memory of the injury wasn’t on his mind.
“It was nice to get back out 
there with the guys, but I wasn’t out there thinking about any inju-
ry or anything like that,” Driskel 
said. “It definitely was nice to get out there in front of a bunch of 
fans and compete with the guys.”Driskel’s first drive was a 
three-and-out, overthrowing 
wide receiver Quinton Dunbar on 
a deep ball and receiver Latroy 
Pittman on the right sideline. 
On his second drive, he looked 
much more composed. His first completion of the day came on a 9-yard, play-action pass to Dun-
bar. He overthrew Dunbar on third down on the right sideline, 
which would have resulted in a touchdown as Dunbar had cor-
nerback Jalen Tabor beat on the 
coverage. 
On the same drive, Driskel 
hit Pittman on a screen pass, and the junior wideout bounced off a poor tackle by safety Keanu Neal 
to turn a short pass into a 15-yard 
gain. 
With 2:56 to go in the first 
quarter, Driskel rushed for a total of 11 yards — he was wearing a non-contact jersey, so referees de-
cided where he was “tackled” — 
and completed a 17-yard pass up the middle to Ahmad Fulwood. 
Driskel’s first drive of the sec-
ond quarter, an impressive 10-play, 65-yard scoring drive, ended 
with the fourth-year quarterback 
converting on a third down and hitting Demarcus Robinson on a 
crossing route. Robinson ran vir-
tually untouched for a 31-yard touchdown. 
Offensive coordinator Kurt 
Roper’s offense doesn’t ask Driskel to do much — just enough 
to make plays to get the offense 
up field — even if that means 5 yards at a time.
Driskel marched the offense 
into the red zone quickly on his next drive. With just 1:25 to go in 
the first half, he made consecu-
tive completions to Fulwood and Dunbar to reach midfield and then rushed 14 yards on second 
and 6 to get inside Orange’s 32, 
but the Blue team had to settle for an Austin Hardin 24-yard field goal to put them ahead 23-13 at halftime. 
On his last drive, he drove 
down to Orange’s six and went 6 of 10 for 31 yards. But he couldn’t connect with receiver Chris 
Thompson on a fade route in the 
end zone on fourth down. 
D r i s k e l 
finished Sat-urday 19 of 33 for 171 
yards and no interceptions. With Will Muschamp as the coach, a run-first offense is the norm.
But Driskel looks significantly 
more comfortable on the run from the shotgun as opposed to under 
center. Making plays with his feet 
will be a key for 2014, and when he is asked to throw, it usually 
won’t be a deep ball. 
“He’s a big kid,” Fulwood said. 
“Not many [defensive backs] that are in the [Southeastern Confer-
ence] want to be in front of that. He’s smart; he knows when to 
get down. He just knows what to 
do.”
Driskel still has all summer 
and fall camp to work one-on-one with his receivers and get timing and chemistry. For his first true 
game since being injured roughly 
seven months ago, Driskel did just fine. 
“You can’t go back into fall 
camp without being in rhythm,” Driskel said. “So we’re going to have to do that, but we’re used to 
that. We’ve done that the past few 
summers. It’s nothing new to us, and we’re looking forward to it.” Driskel solid in first game at Florida Field following injury

Before the start of Sunday’s 
match, Florida’s three seniors re-
ceived bouquets of ﬂ  owers, person-alized framed jerseys and a standing ovation from the crowd.
But in their ﬁ  nal home match as 
Gators, all the trio really wanted was a win.
No. 11 Florida (18-4, 10-2 South-
eastern Conference) defeated Ken-tucky (15-9, 5-7 SEC) 4-1 in the last match of the regular season. UF grabbed the doubles point and fought through singles play to earn 
its sixth straight win heading into 
the postseason.
“I’m very excited because Ken-
tucky is a very good doubles team and I was really happy with our doubles play,” coach Roland Thornqvist said.  “It’s really coming along.” 
Soﬁ  e Oyen and Belinda Woolcock 
captured the ﬁ  rst doubles match, winning 8-5 on Court 2. Meanwhile, Alexandra Cercone and Brianna 
Morgan were down 5-1 and looked 
as if they couldn’t match Kentucky’s energy. 
“[There was] one tactical change 
that we talked about the ﬁ  rst 10 minutes, and they just didn’t do,” Thornqvist said of Cercone and Morgan. “But I left them alone, and I think they ﬁ  gured, ‘Hey, we better 
do this or else.’’’
After a quick conversation, the 
two bullied their way to an 8-5 vic-
tory to clinch the doubles point.
“I just kind of looked at Bri and 
I told her, ‘Let’s just be aggressive. Let’s be the ﬁ  rst ones to get to the net. Let’s be the 
ﬁ  rst ones to ex-ecute,’’’ Cercone said. “Once we kind of got in that mindset and we 
got momentum, 
we just started rolling.”
The momen-
tum continued into the initial stages of singles play, where Woolcock began the scoring. The freshman captured a 6-3, 6-1 victory to put the Gators ahead 2-0. Morgan was the 
next to ﬁ  nish, winning 7-5, 6-1 in a 
high-paced match on Court 1. 
“In [Brianna’s] second set, I 
started to see some brilliance again,” Thornqvist said. “She started to swing, [kept] balls in front of her, just a different pace on the ball. When she does that … there’s nobody in the country better right now. “
Cercone ceded the only point to 
the Wildcats, losing a tightly con-tested 7-6 (5), 6-1 match to bring UK within two. But the Gators ended 
Kentucky’s comeback hopes as Ol-
ivia Janowicz pulled out a 6-4, 3-6, 6-1 victory that lasted almost two and a half hours.
“It was pretty special. I got to 
clinch so it was a great moment for me,” Janowicz said. “We had a great turnout so that made us feel really good. It was just a great day.”
Florida’s three seniors won’t have 
much time to soak in the moment, as they will travel to Columbia, Mo., on Wednesday to compete in the SEC Tournament, in which they are the No. 4 seed. Thornqvist hopes that his team’s strong doubles play of late is a sign of things to come as they head into the postseason.
“Last year we were able to be 
pretty successful in tournament play, even [though] we virtually [lost] ev-ery doubles point,” the three-time 
national championship coach said. 
“Now, I’m hoping we steal one here and there and certainly that’s some-thing that’s going to be very impor-tant if you want to make it far.” 
After seeing Kourtney Keegan 
win her second SEC Freshman of the Week award in a row, Thornqvist is hoping the rookie’s strong play will 
allow her to make an impact in the 
tournament. 
“The highlight was Kourtney 
Keegan,” Thornqvist said. “Today, I really felt like she found a balance between power and strategy. It was a big step for her.”
