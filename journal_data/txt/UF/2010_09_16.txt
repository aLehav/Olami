PALM COAST, Fla. (AP) — The former 
owner of a Palm Coast pizzeria accused of 
attacking customers who complained about their order has been sentenced to 10 years in prison.
A Flagler County judge sentenced 42-year-
old Joseph Milano on Wednesday. He was convicted in June of possession of a firearm by a felon.
Milano was arrested in January 2009 after 
he reportedly assaulted and pistol-whipped two men who complained about their cal-zone order at Goomba’s Pizzeria. Deputies later discovered that Milano is actually Joseph Calco — a former mob hit man turned federal witness.
The gun charge stems from February do-
mestic disturbance call, where a deputy found a gun under his mattress.
Milano acknowledged in court that he 
wasn’t supposed to have the gun but needed it to protect himself from Mafia enemies.

On Sept. 4, junior David Vivian tried log-
ging into the UF Sakai system to do some 
homework for his classes. 
But instead of being greeted by the wel-
come sight of the Sakai work panels, Vivian 
was surprised by an error message. 
“Your account has been locked,” the 
screen read. “Please contact the UF system administrator.”
Vivian was locked out of his GatorLink 
account. The problem was that he had two 
assignments due the next day . 
“It blindsided me,” Vivian said. “It was 
like ‘I did not know they could even do 
this.’”UF system administrators can, and will,

cious virus. 
“Your GatorLink account is used for all 
kinds of things,” said Rob De Cespedes, an IT specialist at the UF Computing Help

Two Bangs
Two loud bangs woke Juan Postell — two hard kicks  
that broke open the door.
Before he could grab clothes or get out of bed, a man 
dressed in black with his face hidden in a ski mask was 
waving a gun at him.  
The man told Juan and his girlfriend, Shaunda McBride, 
not to move. 
It wasn’t the first time Shaunda had a gun pulled on 
her, but looking down the barrel is just as frightening the 
second time.  
Seconds later, Juan heard another two 
bangs —  two gun shots that killed his mother.
Juan ran out of his room and found her unconscious. 
He held two fingers to her wrist and pressed, feeling a faint pulse.
Looking at her body , Juan felt like his world was over. 
He couldn’t stand up. He couldn’t think. On the way to the hospital, he couldn’t stop vomiting.
“It was such a sickening thing,” he said. Two shots 
in the dark

A woman participates in a bicentennial parade in Mexico Cit on 
Wednesday as Mexico celebrates its 200th birthday.
THE ASSOCIATED PRESS
MEXICO CITY — Just one day 
without massacres, beheadings or 
shootouts.
On its 200th birthday Wednesday , 
Mexico wanted its citizens — and the world — to forget its vicious drug war 
and remember the country’s epic his-
tory , music, whimsical folk art and 
continuing crusade for wider prosper -
ity and democracy.
All were on display with a $40 mil-
lion fiesta, two years in the making. 
About 60,000 revelers — many wear -
ing sombreros and face paint with the red, white and green of the Mexican flag — crowded along Reforma Av-
enue, the capital’s main promenade, 
cheering and yelling “Bravo!” at the start of the 1.7-mile parade of floats and dances designed by the country’s top artists.
Another 25,000 gathered early at 
the main Zocalo plaza, where Presi-dent Felipe Calderon delivered the traditional “Grito” — three shouts of 
“Viva Mexico” — to celebrate the 1810 
uprising that resulted a decade later in independence from Spain.
Some traveled to the capital from all 
over Mexico to celebrate on the streets, 
despite the country’s escalating drug 
violence that increasingly has claimed 
innocent lives.
“This one is special,” said Iris Mari Rodriguez Montiel, a small business 
owner who had traveled from the Gulf Coast state of Veracruz and wait-ed since morning for the festivities to 
start. “It gives me chills just to think 
about it. I love Mexico. There’s only one Mexico.”
Little girls wearing ribbons of the 
Mexican flag watched from the shoul-
ders of their fathers, and other children 
blew trumpets as the air filled with confetti. Marchers with green, red and 
white cacti sprouting from their heads 
formed a sea around an enormous 
newspaper boat sporting phrases from 
the independence era.
“It’s like a Carnival of Rio, plus an 
Olympic ceremony , plus Woodstock 
all put together in the same day,” 
said artistic direc-
tor Marco Balich, 
who produced the opening and clos-
ing ceremonies of the 2006 Turin Win-ter Olympics. “For the cost of a war -
plane, you can celebrate the birthday of a country.”
In the back of many people’s minds 
was the violence of the past year. Mili-tary helicopters buzzed overhead, 
heavily armed federal agents and met-
al detectors greeted revelers. In some of Mexico’s most violent cities, the fes-tivities were canceled for fear of a drug cartel attack.
There was still hope, though, that the drug war would take a holiday.
“In Mexico, we all live in fear. And 
the worst part is that we are starting to get used to it,” said Eric Limon, 33, a 
professional dancer who volunteered 
to wear a jaguar mask and swing a colorful Aztec club and spear for the 
parade.
“I want to be part of something im-
portant,” said Limon, who was part of 
the parade. “I know this won’t solve our problems, but this is my grain of 
sand to create a sense of unity . This is 
what Mexico needs.”
Many people were staying home to 
watch the festivities broadcast on TV 
and the Internet.
“It’s not clear what we have to cel-
ebrate. It’s 200 years of independence, but there is as much insecurity as free-
dom in Mexico,” said Anita Guerrero.
Guerrero planned to be at the main 
plaza in the Pacific resort of Acapulco 
for that city’s Grito — but only because she needed to make money selling en-
chiladas to the crowd.
“You never know if you will make 
it safely home,” she said.
Still, it was hard to keep Mexicans 
away from a party.
“To celebrate the identity of a coun-
try, especially in this moment in Mex-
ico, I think is really needed,” Balich said. “Especially for the young to be proud of their identity, to make an op-
timistic statement at a difficult time.”Mexico celebrates bicentennial

� RIDES WILL BE FREE.
By MATT SANTMYERS
Alligator Contributing Writer
Gainesville’s fleet of vehicles 
that give rides to students is get-
ting some new wheels.
The Gotcha Group, which 
stands for Green Operated Tran-
sit Carrying Humanity Around, will launch six-seat electric vehi-
cles to transport college students and employees around for free 
this fall.
Sean Flood, CEO of The Got-
cha Group, along with the help of his business partners, Drew Sfugaras and Stephen Donehoo, 
worked together with the manu-
facturer to design the Japanese-built vehicles. 
The Gotcha rides are powered 
by 12 car batteries and are com-pletely customizable, Flood said.
Although the service is free, the drivers are recruited college students who work on tips.
The service launched Sept. 
3, just in time to help out with gameday traffic. In addition to 
students, The Got-
cha Group helps pa-
tients and workers of Shands get around.
There are three Gotcha rides 
that have two main shifts. The first shift lasts from 8 a.m. to 6 p.m., which allows for students to get to class around the outside of campus and others to get to Shands.
After bringing the vehicles 
home for a recharge on their rap-id charge system, they begin the 
second shift at 10 p.m. to provide 
students a ride downtown or wherever they may be going. 
Although the vehicles do not 
operate on campus during the day to avoid conflicts with the government-funded RTS bus sys-tem, they will be a great option for special event traffic, said Scott Fox, director of transportation and parking at UF. 
He said they will be especially 
useful for events held in areas of campus that are auto-restricted, such as the auditorium.
“We’re looking forward to 
watching the service grow and seeing what we can do to fill a transportation need we can’t fill with existing services,” Fox said.

A Safe Neighborhood In A Bad Area
Minnie Postell lived at 164 Castle Drive in Hidden Oaks, a mo-
bile home community . It’s quiet at night, except for the low hum of 
the highway, which borders the neighborhood.
At 4:50 in the afternoon, children walk home alone from the 
bus stop. Neighbors walk dogs without leashes. A sheriff’s deputy 
lives less than 500 feet from Minnie’s house.
At around 4:15 a.m. Tuesday, when Minnie heard someone 
breaking in, the 57-year-old grandmother grabbed her gun. 
With three grandchildren in the house, she grabbed the gun to 
protect her family . Juan thinks she scared the intruders. He thinks 
that’s why they shot her. 
Her Name Was Minnie, But They Called Her Mama 
On Wednesday, family and friends gathered outside Minnie’s 
home to remember her and help ease one another’s pain.
“It’s the definition of senseless violence,” Juan said.He sipped at a bottle of Bud Light, but it didn’t ease his pain. “I’m hurt. I’m hurt bad,” he said. “I’m having problems just 
thinking clearly.”
Shaunda, who has been dating Juan for three years, said Min-
nie acted as a mother to anyone who came into her life. That’s why everyone called her mama. 
“There’s no greater love than the love you have for your mama,” 
she said. “She might not have gave birth to me, she might have just been my mom through him, but that was my mom.”
Minnie spent her life supporting her family . She did accounting 
work, drove school buses and garbage trucks 
and then drove semi-trucks across the country.
Juan didn’t know where she got it, but he 
wasn’t surprised she had a gun. 
“If you’re a female truck driver, four or five 
states away from home late at night at a truck stop, you’re a target,” he said.
Minnie’s daughter, Larissa Postell, said she 
strives to live like her mother. 
Once she asked her mom how she could 
trust strangers enough to take them into her home.
She recalled Minnie’s answer: “‘God put us all here for a reason. 
And I feel like my reason was to mother the community, so that’s what I do.’” 
Now Larissa isn’t sure if she can live like her mother.“I want to be able to trust people and know there is good out 
there, but after this it’s hard.“ 
Point Blank
After Minnie was shot, one of the suspects yelled, “Come on, 
Drop, let’s go,” according to the police report. 
Drop was later identified as Adarius Derrell Harris, who lives 
at 513 SW 68 Terrace in a neighborhood just blocks away from Minnie’s — a neighborhood that’s darker at night. 
Juan was helping Harris write music and rap lyrics, and he’d 
been over to Minnie’s house several times before. 
Witnesses identified Harris by his voice. He was arrested Tues-
day morning on charges of homicide and robbery with a firearm. 
Wednesday night, police were still looking for at least three 
other suspects and expected to make more arrests.. 
“I don’t have it in me to kill them.” Juan said. “But god damn 
it, I want to be there at the sentencing. I want to be there at the execution.”
For Larissa, knowing the accused suspect had previously been 
in her mother’s house makes it more painful. 
“They put two bullets in my mama’s heart – the one place that 
carried all that love and all that affection. They took her in about a minute.”MURDER , from page 1OnCampu s
Accounts with viruses are usually reformatted
Way more horrible than not being able to view a class lec-
ture for an hour.”
Locking an account is also a way of preventing the virus 
from spreading throughout the network, he said. 
If the computer is shut off from accessing the Internet, 
it also can help prevent viruses aimed at stealing personal information, such as credit card numbers. 
But these preventative measures can be inconvenient 
for students, whose professors are increasingly relying on UF’s E-Learning and Sakai systems for assignment submis-sions. 
“It didn’t just hamper me,” Vivian said. “But it actually 
stopped me from doing schoolwork.” 
Still, De Cespedes said that in the event of a serious in-
fection, disabling accounts is the best option.
“We understand that when someone’s GatorLink gets 
disabled, it’s inconvenient,” he said. “We want to make that process as quick and painless as possible. Things like this make it so that at least if we can’t get to someone right away , they’re not infecting anybody else.” 
In order to avoid the frustration of having your Gator -
Link account shut down, it is important to know how to avoid getting malicious viruses in the first place, he said.“People can obtain malicious viruses from nefarious 
websites,” De Cespedes said. “Places they wouldn’t tell 
someone they’ve been to.”
Viruses are also commonly obtained through movie and 
software piracy . 
The Computing Help Desk will help students clean their 
hard drives if they are unsure how to do so, he said. 
Usually, what is recommended to students who have 
contracted a virus that would result in their GatorLink be-
ing shut down is a process called reformatting, which com-
pletely erases the hard drive.
Should students elect to do so, the technicians are able to 
backup data that students wish to save off their computer 
before the drive is wiped. 
If a student wishes to go through the cleaning process 
and sit with the technicians, there is a $25 charge, which includes data backup. If he leaves his or her computer with the technicians, there is a $35 charge in addition to 50 cents 
per gigabyte of data he or she wishes to save.COMPUTERS , from page 1Postell

“I chose ‘The Onion’ because I felt 
like a lot of students could associate 
with them,” he said. “I learned about them in school, and I know a 
lot of my friends did as 
well. I thought it would be very cool to see them 
come together at the University of Florida.”

The UF Cicerones and the Student 
Alumni Association are collecting canned 
food to beat hunger — and the University of Georgia.
Danielle Tubbs, SAA community ser -
vice co-chair, is hopeful that students will be able to contribute to a good cause. 
“Hopefully people will catch on by just 
being out there and realize they can do 
something more than just stand in line,” 
she said. “They can give back to the com-
munity.”
Collections began last Friday at the 
BEAT T-shirt giveaway at Emerson Alumni 
Hall. Students who bring cans to BEAT T-
shirt giveaway days from now until Oct. 29 
will receive coupons to local restaurants. 
Students who donate one can will re-ceive one coupon, five cans will receive two coupons, and ten cans will receive three coupons.
Students can donate cans Monday 
through Friday from 8:30 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. at Emerson Alumni Hall and still receive coupons for local restaurants. There will also be a donation bin in Jennings Hall. 
Students will be notified of the compe-
tition results after the Florida versus Geor -

Everyone loves a good movie.
Everyone also, on occasion, is thankful when a 
movie is just a movie.
I love a good zombie movie. I really enjoyed the 
newest installment of “Resident Evil.” With the recent popularity the genre has seen, I’d say a lot of people like a well-produced zombie movie. The idea of a zom-bie apocalypse is almost appealing to some, given the potential of the heroic/epic battles and the abolition of the 9-5 work schedule.
Unfortunately for thrill seekers, doomsday predic-
tions have been less exciting and more inclined to re-
volve around an economic collapse rather than a wide-
spread epidemic that reanimates the dead.
From a Breitbart article on Sept. 12, Nouriel Rou-
bini, who was credited with accurately predicting the 
subprime mortgage crisis and the burst of the housing 
bubble, said, “The US has run out of bullets, any shock 
at this point can tip you back into recession.” 
Yesterday’s fire and brimstone action sequence is to-
day’s “foreclosure” sign  and increasing unemployment rates.
Surely everyone can remember the feeling when they 
left the theater after seeing “Inception.” 
Most of us gave thought to the idea that our reality 
could be a dream. Such a thought fades with time, but my concern lingers not for fear of a persistent dream, but of an inescapable nightmare.
In “Inception,” layers upon layers of dreams could 
cause distorted perceptions of reality and an inability to wake up. 
These compounding dreams made the world tremen-
dously complex and hard to follow. Now, wake up to reality. President Obama’s two signature pieces of leg-islation, the health care bill and the financial reform act, are strikingly similar to the unsettling complex-ity of “Inception.” The dreams of ‘coverage for all’ and an infallible economy are pleasant ones, but underneath lies a regulatory night-mare.
These two pieces of legislation 
forsake specifics for interpretation, shifting implemen-tation to the hands of nameless and faceless bureaucrats. 
Some of these bureaucrats don’t even exist yet. 
They will work for agencies that have yet to be es-
tablished.
To implement the mammoth Obamacare law, the 
administration will establish at least 159 new federal boards and commissions.
With the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Con-
sumer Protection Act, the verdict is still out as to how 
much it will cost the taxpayer and to what ends the reg-ulatory web will extend. 
The authors of the bill certainly couldn’t answer this 
question, but that’s not a problem because they created the “Office of Complex Financial Institutions” to sort this one out. 
It will be years before we know everything these 
faceless bureaucrats intend to do.
In the real world, I hope one day we can wake up 
from these regulatory nightmares. 
But as it is in the theater, the good guys still have a 
lot of ass kicking to do in the middle of the movie in order to make it out alive.

Health care bill good for 
America  
In a ruling likely to make its way to the U.S. Supreme Court, a federal judge said Tuesday he would not entirely dismiss a 20-state lawsuit against Obamacare.
The states, including our very own Florida, suing the fed-
eral government to reverse the Obama administration’s his-toric social overhaul say the law supersedes state sovereignty by requiring individuals to purchase health care.
And, you know, making sure a few million Americans 
can afford to take care of themselves and ensure college-aged 
students can remain on their parents’ insurance plans until 
they’re 26.
But who cares about that stuff?  
Nearly half the states in our union feel the health care plan 
leaves people sicker and needs to get its boo-boos fixed be-
fore it’s allowed to do much of anything. 
While we understand the concerns people have with the 
looming threat of being forced to buy a government-run plan 
that costs an arm and an amputated leg, we feel many of these concerns are misdirected and need to be reevaluated. 
Obama’s nonexistent death panels that were spawned 
from the fiery lips of certain red-lipped hockey moms will not come and steal your children. 
In fact, the Editorial Board will go so far as to say we think 
the greatest social-welfare upheaval and national revamp 
since the Johnson administration might actually be a good 
thing.
Obama’s plan might not be perfect, but, America, it’s all 
we got.

Due to the recent recession and records 
of high unemployment, the question regarding a college student’s future has 
become a little more uncomfortable to contem-plate. 
Add in the stress of graduating and some 
people begin to realize they need a little help get-ting their foot in the door with possible careers. 
This is where the David F. Miller Center for 
Retailing Education and Research steps in to help students on their quest for employment op-portunities. 
The Miller Center does everything from get-
ting students placed in paid internships with top 
retailing companies to securing jobs for gradu-
ates in corporate and higher management ca-reers. Even though the majority of students who use the Center are in the Warrington College of Business Administration, there is no discrimina-tion and every major is encouraged to stop by and inquire about available opportunities. 
A common misconception is that someone’s 
major cannot be incorporated into retailing and 
he or she shouldn’t bother using the Center. Last 
summer, the Center assisted 157 paid interns who had majors ranging from advertising to in-
dustrial engineering. Many of these interns also 
received job offers for graduation after the sum-mer internship.
Another focus of the Miller Center is to get students interested in and prepared for the retailers at the Career Showcase, which will be Sept. 21 
and 22 at the O’Connell Center. The first day has 
retailers from across the country looking for fu-
ture interns and job candidates. The Center helps candidates by critiquing retail resumes and pro-viding questions students should be prepared to answer when interviewing with retailers.
Want a state-of-the-art place to study and 
learn? The Miller Center will be even more ap-pealing to visit next semester as it relocates into a new building with more than 2,100 square feet 
dedicated to students interested in retail. 
Still don’t know if retailing is for you? Here 
are some facts. Retail is an industry that has 
never had a negative growth and has actually started to increase after the recent financial hard-ship. In addition, starting salaries are compa-rable to other industries and the compensation of top management ranks among the highest in any industry . 
If you have any questions about retail careers 
or obtaining a possible paid internship, contact Cecilia Schulz, director of communications and 
student programs, at 352-273-3289 and set up an 
appointment to discuss your possible future. You won’t regret it.

Speaking Out
After more than a year of 
imprisonment in an Ira-nian jail, Sarah E. Shourd 
is finally able to come back to the 
United States. The young woman, 
along with two other American cit-
izens, was captured in June 2009 by 
the Iranian police for illegally tres-passing the Iranian border while 
on a supposed hike in the Iraqi 
mountains. Last week, the Iranian 
government decided to release the 
woman — who recently developed both a lump in her breast and pre-
cancerous cervical cells — upon the 
payment of a $500,000 bail. Despite 
the negative incentive — for others 
to demand high bails in exchange for prisoners — that might arise 
from accepting the deal proposed 
by the Iranian government, paying 
the bail was the right decision.Get-
ting a 
c i t i z e n back from 
a country that is holding her pris-oner, especially when the detainee 
is in extremely poor health and 
runs the risk of becoming incur -
able, is worth $500,000. There is a 
worry that paying the bail will lead 
to a slippery slope, with the Iranian 
government asking more and more 
money in exchange for the release of other prisoners accused of all 
sorts of misconduct. This possibil-
ity might indeed become reality, 
but in the present circumstance it 
is worth allowing a seriously ill American citizen back to the Unit-
ed States. After all, $500,000 is not 
too high a price for a life.

“Dove World Outreach Center now

That my friends, is an example of 
a fake news headline. Done well, fake 
news can be satirical and thought provoking. Done poorly, as I’ve clearly demonstrated in the first sentence, it can be offensive. 
“President Obama secretly white.”Or stupid.“Gator’s WR Chris Rainey arrested

 Easy A
 It’s easily the best movie 
this year that tackles all of 
modern culture’s most promi-
nent themes. In what could be the next 
“Mean Girls,” “Easy A” pokes fun at 
society’s double standard for hookups as 
well as teens’ obsession with gossip and status — and the conservative groups that taunt them. The cast includes Emma Stone (“Superbad”),Penn Badgley (“Gossip Girl”) and Amanda Bynes.  By LAUREN GOLD
 avenue contributing writer
This isn’t “Glee’s” William McKinley 
High. There’s no Will Schuester. No Rachel 
Berry (although there’s plenty of voices 
that compare).
There are no cameras rolling.   
Instead, there’s a group of 18 singers 
standing in a circle in a stuffy room tucked 
away in the back of the campus music 
building.
  They are sopranos, altos, tenors and 
basses. They are Greeks, non-Greeks, dorks, jocks, theater and music majors.
    A few members wear T-shirts that say 
“A Ca Hell Yeah” because they are proud — as they should be. They’ve turned songs like Miley Cyrus’ “Party in the U.S.A.” into 
worthy ballads. They’ve taken their bows 
in the international limelight. They are part of the most competitive co-ed a cappella group on campus: No Southern Accent.
  And when they meet together, usually 
three times a week, it’s straight out of an episode of Fox’s Emmy-winning series “Glee,” which kicks off its second sea-son next Tuesday. Blame it on the group’s 
powerhouse vocals, matching choreogra-
phy and a catchy charm that makes you wonder why they don’t have a TV show of their own.  Just like “Glee,” the energy and vibra-
tions are palpable. You can feel the ex-citement as everyone snaps in unison or breaks out in impromptu choreography. 
The difference between the kids of Wil-
liam McKinley High and No Southern Ac-
cent? These singers use their voices as in-
struments — no random piano man hangs around at their rehearsals.
  Chris Rienas, the musical director of 
No Southern Accent, is Mr. Schuester, the show’s curly-headed chorale/morale lead-er. He stands in the middle of the motley crew.
  “We need to practice the two transi-
tions. Deﬁ  nitely. Deﬁ  nitely,” Rienas says.
  The group agrees. They collect them-
selves silently, and the music starts again.
  “We’re not just a bunch of kids sing-
ing together. We’re making a complete band,” says Morgan McCall, No Southern Accent’s treasurer. “It’s a whole different experience.”
  The energetic crew sings Top 40 hits — 
you know, the kind of jams we all down-load instantly off iTunes after every new episode of “Glee.”
  Standing together, they look just like 
the “Glee” members we love, except with 
a few more good-looking Fins, and no cheerleading uniforms. There are Pucks, Brittanys, Arties, Tinas — and maybe even 
a Berry or two, including No Southern Ac-cent president, Kim Meyer.
  Meyer, who has Berry’s vocal wow- 
factor without the ego, lives the life of a 
“Gleek.”
  “After a tough day, you get to come into 
a room with a bunch of your best friends 
and just sing,” she says. 
  Founded in 2001, No Southern Accent 
has been moving up the ranks. Last year, 
they came in second place in the quarterﬁ  -
nals of the International Championship of Collegiate A Cappella. This year, about 80 singing hopefuls auditioned for No South-
ern Accent, and only three made the cut 
for the 18-person group. It’s that competi-tive, Meyer says.
  But No Southern Accent is not nearly 
as competitive with its “rival groups,” un-
like the way the “Glee” troupe, New Direc-tions, treats their cutthroat enemy, Vocal 
Adrenaline, on the series. No Southern Ac-cent often sings with the other two a cap-pella groups on campus, The Sedoctaves 
and The Staff, and adores their fellow 
competitors from other schools.
  “We have so much respect for All-
Night Yahtzee, the a cappella group at 
FSU,” Meyer says. “We love them because 
they’re so good at what they do.”
  And it’s the spirit, that unity, that makes 
them the college counterpart to our favor-ite “Glee” club.
  “No Southern Accent really brings you 
together,” Meyer said. “At the end of the day, these are my best friends.”
  The rehearsal ends with tryouts for an 
upcoming solo. Unlike “Glee,” where Berry takes over the lead and everyone else watches on with distaste, No Southern Ac-cent has a democratic process. Whoever wants to audition for the part can audi-
tion. They take a blind vote. They cheer 
each other on and applaud after each round. They’re supportive of each other, just like the “Gleeks.”
  And if you look down, you can see the 
diversity in the group. Their shoes are all different. They wear Nike kicks, Rainbow ﬂ  ip-ﬂ  ops, boat shoes. Ballet ﬂ  ats, Con-verse sneakers and even bare feet stand 
together in the circle.
  And they’re proud of what they do when 
they all come together.

  This Euro disco-pop princess, 
who just hit up the MTV Video 
Music Awards, is back with a fresh batch of 
pumping, thumping and pounding electronic beats in “Body Talk Pt. 2.” Though she’s one of Sweden’s 
biggest stars, the majority of American ears haven’t 
heard this bleach blonde’s music since her 1997 anthem, “Do you Know (What it Takes),” was a radio hit. Key songs off Robyn’s latest eight-track EP include the subdued yet poignant ballad, “In-destructible,” and the more aggressive “U Should Know Better,” which features pop’s most demanded collaborator, Snoop Dogg.
 Memories
  Cuomo wants to go back. And 
he’s taking us with him. The 
Weezer frontman and his pop-rock 
crew teamed up with Johnny Knoxville, Steve-O and the rest of the Jackass gang to create this ‘90s- 
esque, home video-inspired music video that’s sure 
to produce a few laughs (and maybe even a little nostalgia). On the track, which is set to be part of the upcoming “Jackass 3-D” movie, Cuomo whines, “Memories make me want to go back there, back there,” while in the video a jet ski ﬂ  ies into a bush, bikers and skateboarders crash in skate bowls  and an overweight white man breaks through the side of an above-ground swimming pool.

Dear Jared,
This is hard to say, but I think I 
have a small penis. Is this something I should be worried about? I just started dating someone new, and I can’t really 
tell if she’s turned off by the goods.
Sincerely,
Little Problems
I think the best way to answer this 
ultimate question that plagues so -
ciety’s mind — and plays inside the 
pants of many member-minded men —  is to look at it metaphorically.
Most people like dicks (we know 
women outnumber men in terms of 
population — and that doesn’t even 
include the fellas who like other fel-
las). And most people like noodles. I think we can safely agree on that. 
And when we’re talking about a 
particular create-your-own pasta dish at Romano’s Macaroni Grill, the way you twirl your fork matters just as much as the size of the noodle.
And when we’re talking noodles 
here, many penis pros can agree they’d much rather dig into a bowl of manicotti than a short, thin serving 
of fettuccine. 
Can I get a “no-angel-hair-for-me-
whoop-whoop” in the house, ladies? 
Am I right?
Because God forbid you get 
served a helping of rotini. 
Look it up if you’re not familiar. 
And be thankful this is only a meta-phor.
Allow me 
to let you in 
on the biggest pseudo-secret 
our phallic-
fantasized  culture has to offer: No mat-ter who says what, size re -
ally does matter. 
And whenever anyone, blushing 
or adamantly opposed to believing in 
such superficial things, tells you oth-
erwise, they’re lying. And they know it, too. 
I’m not saying that makes your 
girlfriend the tyrannous Size Queen of her own unruly subjects between your legs, but she has definitely thought about it.
And I’m most definitely saying 
she’s talked about the punch you’re lacking below the belt to her girl-friends over nonfat soy lattes and scones. 
Think of it this way: It’s very similar 
to asking the question of whether or not looks matter when dating some -
one, which is the most ridiculous question anyone could ever ask.
Of course looks matter. You, nor 
any Billy, Tom, Susie or I would care to do a double take for a half-ton, camouflage-wearing, whistles-with-a-twang-through-the-huge-decaying-gap-in-her-teeth stranger passing by with a super personality. 
Because when it comes down to 
it, personality means as much as tits to a nun if you don’t have a little something to elicit that charming hu -
mor or quick wit. 
The same goes for your situation. 
Size matters. But just like any pasta 
dish can be spruced with a little ba-
sil and oregano, how you serve your noodle is half the job.
Make up for your member in other 
ways, starting way before you even take your mini-me out for a spin. Foreplay can go a long way if you’re looking for a distraction.
And hey, luckily for you, your girl-
friend clearly liked something about you before she ventured down be -
low, and she’s not likely to forget that something special just because you’re packing a Tootsie Roll rather 
than a Four Loko. 
And this is where your personality 
becomes even more important. 
If you continue to exude this in-
secure penis persona, your perfor -
mance will suffer. If you realize your girlfriend probably cares more about 
how much you make her laugh and how cute your smile is than what type of noodle she’s served, you’ll prob-ably get a much better review when she talks about it at her weekly mani-pedi session with the girls. 
So give her something to talk 
about.

Tasty TV dinners: What goes good with 'Gossip Girl'?
By MELINDA CARSTENSEN
avenue writer
Fall television’s back in swing, and we’ve thrown out all the bad 
eggs and come up with the tastiest of TV lineups for your conve -
nience. Whether you’re craving something new or can’t wait to 
sink your teeth back into that show you’ve been patiently waiting 
months to return, here’s the best of fall TV and some dishes and 
drinks to enhance your viewing pleasure.
 Monday:
“Gossip Girl”  (CW, 9 p.m.)
Premiered: Sept. 13Dish: NY Cheesecake and a ManhattanSit back, relax and indulge, whether you deserve it or not— just 
like your favorite Upper East Siders do in the Big Apple. With these 
signature New York items, you’ll feel just as glamorous as Serena 
and Blair — but without leaving your living room, and, better yet, without the big paycheck.
 Tuesday: 
“Glee”  (Fox, 8 p.m.)Premieres: Sept. 21
Dish: Apple Smirnoff and Apple Cinnamon Cheerios
You’ll need something strong to meet your full potential when 
singing and dancing along to the songs “Glee” has in store this season. John Stamos (“Full House”) has joined the cast, and, among other celebrity guests, Britney Spears will make a cameo. And, while any strong beverage would work, we couldn’t resist rec-ommending Cheerios — as that’s the school’s cheerleading squad headed by sassy Sue Sylvester (Jane Lynch), the villain we all love to hate.
 Wednesday:
“Undercovers” (NBC, 8 p.m.)Premieres: Sept. 22Dish: Champagne and chocolate-covered strawberriesIn this sultry television debut, Steven Bloom (Boris Kodjoe, 
“Tyler Perry’s Madea’s Family Vacation”) and his wife Samantha (Gugu Mbatha-Raw, “Dr. Who”) are retired spies — that is, until one of their friends goes missing and they’re put back on the job 
to track him down. Though it’s almost “Mr. & Mrs. Smith” in TV 
form, the explosive romance (literally) prevalent in “Undercovers” won’t disappoint. Whether you’re a guy or a gal, this action-packed show’s a winner. So snuggle up close to your special somebody 
and have a romantic, intimate night in with these two romance-
worthy items.
 Thursday:
“My Generation” (NBC, 8 p.m.)Premieres: Sept. 23 Dish: Beer and Chips & French onion dipReunite with friends, new and old, and chow down with these 
simple party foods to take you back to your young (younger) high 
school years. Let the nostalgia flood in as you watch “My Genera-
tion,” a documentary and reality TV-inspired show that in modern day revisits a group of Austin, Texas friends who attended high school together in 2000.
 Friday:  
“20/20” (ABC, 10 p.m.)Dish: Coffee-flavored ice creamAfter a long and stressful week, what could be better than a 
nice icy treat — appropriately coffee-flavored to go with some good old investigative journalism? It’s a classic dessert for a classic show, as this is the program’s thirty-third season.Meet the seat stealer: the leader of lecture hall losers   
By LAUREN GOLD
avenue contributing writer
Here’s a frightful scenario: You overslept, 
missed the bus, and the line at Starbucks is 
longer than the line at a Justin Bieber concert. By some divine miracle, you make it to class with one minute to spare. The problem? Some 
dude is in your seat. You have just met that 
most despicable of classroom creatures: the seat stealer.I know what you’re thinking, chill out, there 
are no assigned seats. And yes, it would be ridiculously awkward to have a seat war with someone 30 seconds before class begins, but it’s common knowledge that you sit there every week. It’s yours, so what do you do?
Attention, everyone: Drop/add is over. Way 
over. There are no excuses for your irrational behavior.
We’re drawn to the same seat or at least the 
same area. Some people are front row junkies. Others like to camp out in the back. Whatever 
gets you through your three-hour block, but se -
riously  — stick to what works. Nothing is more 
infuriating than running from Tur -
lington to Matherly to find a seat 
stealer in your territory.
No one wants to make ene -
mies in class, but you’ve quickly 
developed a short list of offenders. If the seat stealer ever wants to borrow a pen, we’re fresh 
out of writing utensils.Still, class must go on. You’re completely 
thrown off from the angle of this leftover seat. 
The board looks different. You can’t focus. Who knew the professor had a mole on the other side of his face?
All this anger isn’t healthy. Besides, you 
need all your focus for those horrendous pop quizzes your TA keeps throwing at you. 
Dear seat stealer, please stop aggravating 
the bejeezus out of students everywhere, and 
stay in your own seat. sex and the swamp 

In the wake of wide receiver 
Chris Rainey’s arrest for aggra-
vated stalking, coach Urban Meyer said the Gators will move Omarius Hines from tight end to slot receiv-er and start redshirt freshman Jor -
dan Reed in Hines’ old position.
Florida’s passing attack has 
struggled in its first two games, averaging just 143 yards. Rainey ranks second on the team with six 
catches and is one of four Gators 
to catch a touchdown pass from quarterback John Brantley.
Meyer repeated offensive co-
ordinator Steve Addazio’s earlier statement that Rainey is “not with the team.”
“We haven’t got a lot of pro-
duction in the first two games from him, but you’re going to lose 
(value) anytime you lose a good 
player,” Meyer said.
Hines and Reed are two of the 
other Florida receivers who have caught touchdowns this season. Hines has five catches for 55 yards, and Reed caught a two-yard pass in the end zone against South Flor -
ida.“Hines is a very talented guy 
that we’re moving in,” Meyer said. 
“We’ve got some guys that can still 
make plays.”The Gators hoped Rainey could 
be an intricate part of the offense 
this season at the “Percy Position,” 
a spot demanding a player to be a threat running and receiving. Hines has lined up at the position 
in certain personnel groups this 
season, but he has not run the ball in his college career.
Florida will also rotate fresh-
man Robert Clark, a faster receiver who could be used as a change-of-pace option, receivers coach Zach Azzanni said.
Plugging the run: The Gators 
will use a bigger personnel group this week against the Volunteers, Meyer said. Led by freshman run-ning back Tauren Poole, Tennessee ran the ball 36 times for 182 yards 
in its 48-13 loss to Oregon last 
week.
Florida struggled defending the 
run against USF, surrendering 244 yards on the ground. 
“We gave up way too many 
yards last week,” defensive tackle Terron Sanders said. “I know we can stop the run, we just came out 
and missed a couple assignments, 
missed a couple tackles.”
Facing a new coaching staff 
against USF, Florida had limited 
film to study, which contributed to the early mental problems, Sand-ers said. The Bulls scored a touch-down on their opening drive, gain-ing 96 yards — 79 on the ground.
“We’ve got to do a better job of 
getting in our gaps, staying in our gaps and getting off and making a

 THIS IS BROWN’S FIRST SEASON AS 
A SETTER.
By GREG LUCA
Alligator Writer
gluca@alligator.org
 
Chanel Brown is the only active true fresh-
man on a roster with nine upperclassmen, but 
you wouldn’t believe it watching her play. 
Through seven matches, Brown’s skills as 
a setter and server have played a vital role in 
vaulting the Gators (6-1) from No. 13 in the pre-
season poll to their current ranking of No. 3, the team’s highest since 2005. 
“One of the reasons for our early season suc-
cess is the play of Chanel Brown,” coach Mary Wise said. 
“One could argue ‘How hard is it to throw a 
ball up to Kelly Murphy?’ But there are so many things we ask of Chanel.”
Brown has proven to be capable of every-
thing the Gators have thrown at her so far, as 
she leads the team with a .491 assist percentage and a .955 serve percentage while also chipping 
in 27 digs. 
All this comes in Brown’s first season as a 
setter. She played outside hitter at Chandler (Ariz.) Valley Christian High before switching in her final club season — just a few months be-fore she joined the Gators. 
Despite facing that challenge while being a 
first-year starter, Brown says that the transition 
is “going great” and that playing in the season’s 
opening matches has helped 
her prepare for Southeastern Conference play.
“Being able to go out there 
those first two weekends and play such big competition and 
play these top-five teams in the country has been a huge learning experience for me,” Brown said. “Coming in and playing for the Gators, I’m so 
blessed to be a part of it.”
And Florida is blessed to have her, as Brown’s 
ability to step in from day one has allowed the 
team to implement a 6-2 formation that utilizes UF freshman on fast track
If you want to make the news, 
do something stupid. 
That’s what we have learned 
this week as we continue to follow the Chris Rainey saga. 
Those are the types of stories 
that grow legs in today’s society 
because we all love to criticize 
others in order to feel better about ourselves.
But one piece of Gators news 
went unnoticed this week. It wasn’t 
overlooked because it was mean-
ingless. It was overlooked because it didn’t pro-vide the ugly element out 
society loves 
to consume on a daily ba-sis.

Florida Marlins    5the versatility of junior Kelly Murphy. 
Typically, the Gators play Murphy at front-row at-
tacker when Brown is setting from the back and at 
back-row setter when Tangerine Wiggs substitutes for Brown in the front. 
To this point in the season, the two rotations have 
proven to be equally effective, as the team wins 53 per -
cent of its points when Brown is setting and 52 percent of its points when Murphy coordinates the attack. 
While those numbers appear to indicate that Brown 
and Murphy are equals, only Brown has the luxury of setting to Murphy, who leads the team with 76 kills. 
“Being able to set such great hitters has been a huge 
experience for me,” Brown said. “They’re all such amaz-ing athletes and just great people on and off the court.”
Murphy’s presence has provided Brown with much 
more than just a target for her sets, as the junior has played a major role in helping the freshman learn how to set in the Gators offense. 
“Kelly Murphy has taught me so much and really 
taken me under her wing,” Brown said. “I’ve learned a lot from her.”
Brown has learned the position and the offense at an 
impressive rate. Her seven college matches are really more like three-and-a-half since she only plays in 50 per -
cent of the rotations. 
Despite this disadvantage, the freshman has been 
able to learn everything the coaching staff has asked of her and then some. 
“If she were playing in a true 5-1 she would be getting 
twice as many reps and maybe the learning curve would 
go even faster,” Wise said. “But she plays in three rota-
tions and to be a point-scoring server is not something 
that we would’ve asked of her this early on in her career.It’s a bonus.”
Brown’s accurate jump-float serve has her second on 
the team with nine aces, and its effectiveness was never more clear than in Saturday’s match against Texas. 
With the score tied at 14 in the fifth set, Brown came 
on and dropped not one but two aces in front of the Tex-
as serve receive, propelling Florida to victory. 
Considering how far Brown has come in such a short 
time, it is no wonder that the coaching staff has such high 
expectations for her going forward. 
“We see a real high top end with her,” Wise said. “It’s 
going to be fun for the next four years.”18, ALLIGATOR � THURSDAY, SEPTEMBER 16, 2010

win a men’s track and field national title in the spring, 
visited the White House on Monday with his team to participate in a ceremony hosted by the first African-
American president, Barack Obama.
The tie between the two did not go unnoticed by 
Holloway.
“It made it very special for me because it was one 
of my goals,” he said. “I’m a pretty driven person to 
begin with, but I had a little extra drive in me because I was aware of both of those facts — that was a pretty 
big deal for me. When I saw him walk out there, I got 
chills.”
Holloway didn’t just become the first African-
American coach to win a men’s track and field title by coincidence. He admitted that the milestone was one 
of the driving forces behind his motivation to win a 
national championship.
“It’s not something I’ll go around beating my chest 
about,” he said. “Am I proud of it? I’m very proud 
of it. But I also want to be the first African-American 
head coach to win more than one.”
Holloway looks forward to sharing his experience 
at the White House with his grandchildren and nine-year-old son. 
One thing was missing from making it a perfect 
moment. The two men didn’t get an opportunity to have a conversation during the ceremony to talk 
about their tie.
But having something in common with the presi-
dent was already enough. 
“I’m not sure (President Obama) is even aware of 
who I am,” Holloway said.
That’s understandable, though. The president is a 
busy man. 
But our society doesn’t have that excuse. Instead 
of focusing on the negative all the time, these types of 
stories need time to breathe, too.ANTHONY , from page 17THE ASSOCIATED PRESS
 
COLUMBIA, S.C. — South Carolina has kicked tight 
end Weslye Saunders off the football team.
Gamecocks athletic director Eric Hyman announced 
the decision Wednesday.
“Weslye Saunders is no longer part of our football 
program,” he said in a statement. “Beyond that, I will 
have no further comment.”
Saunders, suspended since Aug. 23, had been at the 
center of the Gamecocks’ NCAA problems this summer. He was questioned by the governing body about poten-tial agent contact regarding a party in South Beach this spring. He was also among several Gamecocks asked by coach Steve Spurrier to leave a local hotel where they had been staying.
Saunders was suspended by Spurrier last month 
for violations the coach said were not connected to the NCAA probe. Saunders has not been with the team since missing both South Carolina victories over Southern Miss and Georgia.
The 13th-ranked Gamecocks (2-0) face FCS opponent 
Furman on Saturday night.
On Tuesday, Spurrier said he had no update on Saun-
ders’ status.
Saunders, from Durham, N.C., did not immediately 
respond to messages left by The Associated Press. Calls to his father, Barry, were also not immediately returned.The 6-foot-6, 270-pound Saunders was South Caro-
lina’s third leading receiver last fall with 32 catches for 353 yards and three touchdowns. He had started 13 games over the previous two seasons and leaves the Gamecocks with 60 career catches for 718 yards and six touchdowns.
His size and strength have him regarded by some 
analysts as a high pick in next spring’s NFL draft. Earlier this summer, ESPN’s Mel Kiper Jr. had Saunders as his No. 2 tight end behind Notre Dame’s Kyle Rudolph.
However, Saunders has had his troubles fitting in at 
times. He considered jumping to the NFL last winter before returning for his senior season, then was suspended 
briefly by Spurrier in January for miss-ing a team meeting.
Saunders was reinstated to the 
team about a week later.
In July, Spurrier said Saunders had 
told the coach he’d done nothing to 
violate NCAA rules and, for awhile, it looked as though the senior would be a vital part of South Carolina’s of-fense.
Spurrier praised his conditioning and hard-working 
attitude when camp opened in August. Saunders led the way with four catches at a Gamecock scrimmage on Aug. 21. But two days later he was suspended by Spur -
rier and never rejoined the team.THURSDAY, SEPTEMBER 16, 2010 � ALLIGATOR, 19

tackle,” defensive coordinator  Teryl Austin said. “[The 
Volunteers] have really good running backs and their of-
fensive line is big and physical.”
Hill to travel: Junior free safety Will Hill will fly with 
the team this weekend, safeties coach Chuck Heater 
said. Hill, who appeared in every game last season, has missed the opening two contests for being “not ready to play.” 
Southeastern Conference teams are al-
lowed to bring 70 players to away games.
Social Networking: A case of strep 
throat kept defensive back Cody Riggs 
and running back Mike Gillislee out of practice this week, and both players let fans know on their respective Twitter accounts and Facebook profiles.
Austin told Riggs to scrap his Twitter account.“Whatever it is you do. Tweet? Is it called a tweet?” 
Austin asked. “If we want [information] out, we’ll re-lease it. It’s not for our players to go out and release stuff.”Hill to travel with

There are plenty of questions surround-
ing Tennessee’s offense, but one thing 
seems certain: The Volunteers are going to 
lean on their running game.
“We’re going to have some big people 
on the field because I think it’s really clear 
what they want to do to you — they want 
to give it to that great back and pound it behind a real big offensive line,” UF coach Urban Meyer said. 
That great back is junior Tauren Poole, 
who leads the Southeastern Conference in rushing yards with 272. He opened the sea-son with 110 yards and two touchdowns 
on 17 carries against Tennessee-Martin 
and followed with 162 yards and a score in Saturday’s loss to Oregon. 
UF hasn’t had much trouble stopping 
the UT ground attack in recent years. During the Gators’ current five-game win streak in the rivalry, they’ve held the Vols to fewer than 100 rushing yards four times. 
The last seven games in the series have 
gone to the team with more rushing yards, a message that isn’t lost on the players.“We can’t let them run and pierce our 
defense,” UF linebacker Brandon Hicks said. “We feel like no team can come through our defense and just run it down our throats. We feel like that’s not going to 
happen at all.”
Poole has other ideas.
In the first quarter against Oregon, he 
ran for 111 yards, making his presence felt 
on the game’s first play with a 31-yard run 
and following with carries of 39, 14 and 23 in the Vols’ first four possessions.
Poole’s early success comes after wait-
ing on the bench behind the likes of Ar -
ian Foster, Montario Hardesty and Bryce Brown for two seasons, and he has taken the reigns of Tennessee’s ground game with authority.
“That’s just been my whole life, being 
patient about everything,” said Poole, who described his playing style in similar fash-ion. “My opportunity came, so I just want to make the most of it, continue doing that 
and learning to be the best back I can be.”
The Vols will count on him to set the 
tone rather than relying on quarterback 
Matt Simms, who’s in his first year as a 
starter. Against the Ducks, Simms was 15 
of 29 for 151 yards and an interception.
Simms has been happy to watch Poole 
loosen up defenses, but he’s quick to point out that Tennessee’s offensive line — 
which starts two freshmen and a sopho-
more, and has three starters measuring 6-foot-6 or taller — deserves credit.
“I think a lot of people are losing the 
sight that our young offensive line has done a great job of giving him that op-portunity to have those big plays,” Simms said. “A few times in the Oregon game, if you watch, Tauren doesn’t get touched until about 20 yards downfield.”20, ALLIGATOR � THURSDAY, SEPTEMBER 16, 2010
