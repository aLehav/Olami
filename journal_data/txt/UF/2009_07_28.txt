� USF REACHED 97 PERCENT OF ITS 
CONTACTS WITHIN FOUR MINUTES.

After the threat of an armed gunman on 
University of South Florida campus ended without harm Friday afternoon, UF said its 
response system is similar, adequate and im-
proving.
USF used text messaging, Web site updates 
and intercoms to keep students and faculty aware of developing information, tools which UF uses or plans to use.
During the recent gun scare, MoBull, a text 
alert system named after USF’s horned mas-cot, reached 97 percent of their contacts within four minutes, said Lara Wade, USF spokes-
woman.
UF took 20 to 30 minutes to contact most 
students in recent tests, UF 
spokesman Steve Orlando said.
Students at USF were first 
alerted of a possible gunman 
by a voice over loudspeakers, four of which broadcast from the top of parking garages for maximum coverage, Wade said.UF is installing a speaker system, which 
should be completed within a year, according to William Properzio, director of UF’s Envi-ronmental Health and Safety Department.
The speakers will be installed in class-
rooms and outside areas, such as the Plaza of the Americas. The system will cost about $1 million, Properzio said. 
According to Orlando, speaker installation UF lacks alert system equal to USF’s

A new supercomputer at UF is 
making it easier to do everything from researching cancer to predict-ing the weather.
The computer, named Novo-G, 
is about 10 to 100 times faster and uses five to 10 times less energy than conventional computers, making it 
the most powerful in its class. 
The computer at UF was finished 
and became fully functional last 
week. 
Novo-G is easily customizable 
for specific tasks, said professor Alan George, director of UF’s recon-figurable computing center.
George explained that while con-ventional com-
puters are inflex-
ible, computers like Novo-G can be modified to 
operate more ef-ficiently.  
George con-
trasted tradi-
tional computers, which he said are like toy blocks that have been glued 
together, with the highly modifiable 
Novo-G.
“If you’re good at it, you can 
have an Eiffel Tower one minute… and the White House [the next],” he said.
The project was a collaboration 
between UF and George Washington University, Brigham Young Univer-sity and Virginia Tech University, as 
well as about 30 other business part-
ners, including NASA, Intel and the National Security Agency. George said UF’s center will continue to re-search Novo-G to better understand the system.
“When it’s all figured out, it’ll be 
in Best Buy,” he said. “But we’re a long way away from that.”

UF’s year-long reign as the top 
party school in the nation ended 
abruptly at noon Monday, when it was announced that Penn State University had taken the infa-mous title.
UF slipped to No. 2 on the list, 
published each year by the Princ-eton Review in its college guide, “The Best 371 Colleges,” which hit shelves today.
The ranking means UF has 
high levels of drug and alcohol use, a popular Greek system and students who don’t spend much time studying, according to sur-vey results from 122,000 students at 371 colleges.
If UF had retained its No. 1 
position, it would have been the 
first school to do so since 1995, 
when the University of Rhode Island completed a three-year run in the top spot, according to Robert Franek, the author of the college guide.
Steve Orlando, UF’s spokes-
man, said he was relieved UF had been dethroned.
“People who do what I do at 
universities dread this announce-ment coming out,” he said.
One reason UF may have 
slipped to the second spot this year is that students didn’t hold as many sports championships, he said.
When the last rankings came 
out, UF held three national cham-pionships — two in men’s bas-ketball and one in football.

After almost hitting an officer with his car 
in a Shands at UF parking garage, a Marion 
County man was arrested by University Po-lice Department Friday. 
At about 5 p.m., UPD got a call from the 
Alachua County Sheriff’s Office stating Mao-nucle Evans, 21, who had three outstanding arrest warrants, was at Shands at UF visiting a patient. Officers found Evans in a nearby parking garage driving a white Buick, said Detective Michael Metz.When a UPD officer saw that Evans was 
trying to exit through the entrance, he stood 
between the car and the entrance gate. Evans 
attempted to drive the car into the officer but 
then reversed, Metz said.
Evans was finally stopped, taken out of 
the car and handcuffed. He was arrested and 
charged with two felonies including aggra-
vated assault and driving with a suspended 
license.

US turns off electronic
billboard in Havana 
WASHINGTON (AP) — The 
Obama administration has turned 
off an electronic sign at the U.S. diplomatic mission in Havana that had displayed pro-democracy and 
human rights messages to Cuban 
passers-by and riled the govern-ment for the past three years.
The State Department said 
Monday that the sign, a news “zipper” on the fifth floor of the sea-front American Interest Sec-tion in the Cuban capital, was shut down last month amid the admin-
istration’s efforts to engage with 
Cuba’s leadership that has already seen some U.S. sanctions eased.
“We believe that the billboard 
was really not effective as a means of delivering information to the Cuban people,” spokesman Ian Kelly told reporters.
He noted that since the sign 
was first erected in 2006, the Cu-ban government had taken steps to obscure it from view.The NCAA on Monday asked 
Circuit Judge John C. Cooper to dismiss a lawsuit filed by The Associated Press and other news organizations seeking the re-
cords under that law.
Cooper will hear that motion 
and others on Aug. 5.
He agreed, though, to delay 
a final two-day hearing that had 
been set to start on that date until Aug. 20-21.
The NCAA sought the delay 
because two of its key witnesses 
— both executives of the organi-
zation — will be unavailable on the original dates as they’ll be attending NCAA meetings on those days.

UF dance students rehearse “Five Beds/Children of The Dream” at the 
Nadine McGuire Theatre and Dance Pavilion in Studio Theatre G-6.
By STEVE JOHNSON
Alligator Writer
The UF School of Theatre and Dance will 
wrap up its summer season by bringing perspec-
tives from Israel, Africa and the Big Apple to the 
Nadine McGuire Theatre and Dance Pavilion.
“Sylvie, An Evening of Dances and Tales” 
will open Wednesday night, incorporating the works of UF professor Neta Pulvermacher and 
24 of UF’s Summer Dance Intensive students.
“We decided to bring the world here,” said 
Pulvermacher. “The idea is to think globally and 
dance locally.”
Focusing on her upbringing in Lehavot Ha-
bashan, a kibbutz in northern Israel, the show features her award-winning dance “Five Beds/Children of the Dream.” 
A kibbutz is a collective community based on 
agriculture.
“You share your life with 16 to 18 peers,” Pul-
vermacher said about her upbringing. “It meant that from birth, rather than live with your par-
ents in same house, you only saw them every 
day in the afternoon.”
Pulvermacher began dancing at 14 years old 
and found her calling one year later when danc-ing and choreographing at an area school close 
to her kibbutz.
“Dance and theater have the capacity to reach 
and touch beyond words,” she said. “It has other means of expressing ideas, thoughts and feel-
ings.”
In 1986, one year after graduating from The 
Juilliard School in New York City, Pulvermach-
er formed her own dance company, The Neta Dance Company.
Since joining the staff at UF three years ago, 
Pulvermacher brought her own life experiences 
to the stage.
“Sylvie,” a piece inspired by Pulvermacher’s 
recent trip to Senegal, is her most recent work.
The title of the piece comes from during her 
trip when she taught choreography to dance in-
structors from across Africa.
“Before I left they threw a potluck in my hon-
or and roasted a whole goat,” she said. “Sylvie 
was the name of the goat.”
The 24 UF students will be joined by four of 
Pulvermacher’s dancers from her New York City studio, two of whom are UF alumni.
“There’s an array of music, dancing, signing 
and yelling,” said Miriam Rosenberg, a UF se-
nior dance major. “It’s an emotional journey.”
The show opens Wednesday at 7 p.m. at the 
Nadine McGuire Theatre and Dance Pavilion in 
Studio Theatre G-6. 
An additional show will be at 9 p.m. The performance runs until Friday with two 
shows per night. Tickets are $13 for students and $17 for the general public and can be purchased at the University Box Office or www.ticketmas-
ter.com, according to the box office Web site.Show to end summer seasonON CAMPUS

already began at the law school.
Orlando also said a low number of UF staff are set to 
receive alert text messages compared to other major Florida 
universities such as University of Miami, which can contact 88 percent of its employees through text in an emergency.
This may account for the disparity in delay time between 
UF’s text system and USF’s MoBull.
UF also uses “reverse 911” which allows the Alachua 
County Sheriff’s Office to send telephone messages, or text-to-speech, to every phone in specific buildings on campus.
“In a recent test it took us anywhere from five to 10 min-
utes to reach three buildings,” Orlando said.
UF uses the ConnectED service to text information to stu-
dents and faculty in case of an emergency, Orlando said.
However, ConnectED, a product of Massachusetts-based 
Blackboard Inc., can run into trouble when many people in the same area use its service simultaneously. 
“It’s like trying to make a phone call at a Gator game,” 
Orlando said.
Phone reception dead zones are also an obstacle to UF’s 
text alert system.
“Until recently I didn’t even get cell phone service at my 
desk,” Orlando said.
Beyond alert systems, Orlando stressed students should 
be aware of their surroundings. 
“If you observe something [weird] in a friend, report it,” 
he said. “Tell somebody.”
Above all, Orlando said UF’s Student affairs and coun-
seling staff as the most important part of campus safety. 
“If we can address something like that early on, we stand 
a much better chance of preventing a bad situation later on. Prevention is always a better path,” he wrote in an e-mail.Booze rules may be to blame

SECURITY , from page 1celebrate,” Orlando said. 
It’s also possible UF President 
Bernie Machen’s attempts to curb 
alcohol consumption have had an ef-fect on UF’s reputation, but it’s hard 
to tell, Orlando said.
“This is anything but a scientific 
survey,” he said.
Machen, who is in Indonesia 
meeting with university leaders, 
could not be reached for comment Monday.
In addition to three other No. 2 
finishes, UF placed first in one of the 
survey’s 62 categories: Best Career 
Services. The ranking means stu-dents rated UF’s job placement ser-vices highly.
UF was ranked No. 13 in Best Ca-
reer Services last year, the first year the ranking was used.
Wayne Wallace, director of UF’s 
Career Resource Center, said he 
thinks his hard-working staff and the 
center’s use of student surveys have a lot to do with the level of satisfac-tion.
“I think that being responsive to 
student interests and needs has re-ally been the key,” he said. 
And, he said, 99 of the 100 compa-
nies Fortune Magazine listed as the 
best ones to work for this year con-
duct recruitment at UF.
UF’s other No. 2 finishes were in 
the categories Best Athletic Facilities, Students Pack the Stands and Jock Schools, which measured popularity of sports and fraternities. 
Last year, UF finished first in 
Students Pack the Stadiums and Stu-dents Study the Least. This year, UF dropped to eighth among schools that study the least.
In the category of Lots of Beer, UF 
ranked No. 4.
Students had mixed feelings 
about UF’s drop in the party school ranking.
Nicole Frankel, a music and pre-
health sophomore, said she was glad 
UF was no longer No. 1.
“I think [being No. 1] has kind 
of a negative connotation,” Frankel 
said. “The university is taken a little 
less seriously,” 
But freshman Alex Patel said she 
didn’t believe that Penn State was ac-
tually a bigger party school than UF.
“I don’t think it’s true. I get texts 
about parties every night,” Patel said. “They must be partying a lot, like severely,” she said.
Jake Marika, a sociology sopho-
more, said he doesn’t think the rank-ing means much.
“Whoever says they party the 
most parties the most,” he said. “It’s bound to change every year.”
However, he said, the ranking 
might make Machen focus less on student drinking.
“Maybe it’s a good thing,” he said, 
“because Bernie will be less likely to get his panties in a bunch.”UF Rankings

 Most incubators at Shands at 
UF are occupied by newborns, but 
thanks to an $8.2 million grant, UF is building a different kind of in-cubator.
The grant for the Florida In-
novation Hub, a business center for startup companies, was an-nounced Friday along with plans for building the 45,000-square-foot facility, according to a UF press release. 
UF will contribute an addi-
tional $5 million to the project and 
will obtain this money mainly 
through royalty income earned from sources like faculty research, said Win Phillips, UF’s vice presi-dent for research.
Scheduled for completion in 
December 2011, the building will provide ofﬁ  ce space, laboratories and conference rooms for several 
budding technological businesses 
and companies connected to the UF community.
Ed Poppell, UF’s vice president 
of business affairs, said that as soon as planning is ﬁ  nished, work-ers will begin construction on the facility, which will hopefully be within the next six months. The building will be construct-
ed on what is now a parking lot on the northeast corner of Shands at AGH site, Poppell said.
The facility will also house 
UF’s Ofﬁ  ce of Technology Licens-ing  and UF Tech Connect, which 
ﬁ  nds technology from research 
that is patentable and promotes the licensing of these technologies to the market.
Phillips said that UF developed the idea of a building a new incu-
bator after seeing the success of a 
similar hub in Alachua County, which opened in 1995.
He said that various business 
sectors will use the facility, in-cluding chemistry, agricultural 
and engineering ﬁ  elds.
Phillips said the hub will pro-
vide constant communication be-
tween companies in the building and people who license technol-ogy and the ability to share re-sources in order to save money.
“There is no question that a 
company’s ability to succeed is far 
greater in an incubator,” he said.
The federal Economic Develop-
ment Administration awarded the 
grant, which is one of the largest of its kind ever given by the EDA’s Atlanta regional ofﬁ  ce, said EDA regional representative Philip T. Trader in the press release.
“We expect it to be extremely 
successful,” he said. 
Katie Haney, a health educa-
tion and behavior senior, agrees with Phillips and said she thinks the hub is going to continue to improve the UF business commu-nity. 
She is also optimistic about the 
new jobs that these future com-
panies will create for Gainesville 
residents, she said.
“As a soon-to-be graduate, I 
think it’s a great idea,” Haney said. “It’s something that is going to make Gainesville an even better place to live.” ON CAMPUSUF allots $5M for construction of business center

 For now, Florida nicely asks drivers to 
stay off their cell phones and just drive.
Through its “Stay Alive… Just Drive” 
campaign, Florida is taking a softer approach than the six states and the District of Colum-bia that ban the use of hand-held cell phones while driving. Another 17 states have partial bans. 
Monday the Florida Highway Patrol be-
gan distributing brochures and pamphlets during routine stops to educate drivers about 
how to avoid and eliminate distractions while 
driving, FHP Capt. Mark Welch said. 
FHP teamed up with the “Stay Alive… 
Just Drive” program to campaign after Gov. Charlie Crist declared July as Distracted Driving Awareness Month, Welch said.
Jay Anderson, the executive director of 
the campaign, said the program asks people to pull over to do anything other than drive 
while behind the wheel. 
The most visible distraction while driving 
is cell phones, but laptops, iPods, grooming, eating and disciplining children are also ma-jor problems, he said.
Anderson said one problem is that young 
people are in constant communication and 
don’t stop when they drive. 
“You have to ask yourself if 
the risk is worth it while you’re behind the wheel,” he said. 
A typical distraction lasts 
about three seconds. A car traveling 45 mph 
can travel half the length of a football ﬁ  eld in 
that amount of time, he said.  
“Failure to pay attention results in pre-ventable crashes,” Anderson said.
There were 1,796 crashes in Florida in 
2003 that were caused by distracted driv-ers, according to the Florida Department of Highway Safety and Motor Vehicles Web site. Twenty percent of drivers were reported as having been on their cell phone. 
Tips to avoid distraction include: pull 
over to text or talk on the phone, read the newspaper at home, limit the amount of time 
spent messing with the radio or CDs and 
scan the roadway ahead, according to the department. Florida drivers discouraged from texting while driving

medals in four of the nine meets 
to date.
One Gators competitor, Tracy 
Caulkins, broke her own previ-ously held American record in the 400-meter race, coming in at 4:39:24, nine seconds before the Australian silver medalist’s time.
Mike Heath, another of the 
Gators Olympiads, has already received two honors on the platform: a silver medal in the 200-meter freestyle and gold in the team 800-meter freestyle with a world-record ﬁ  nish.

According to the indictment, 
the men met in Gainesville after their separate tours of duty and 
allegedly began to formulate 
their plans to “organize numer-ous ‘ﬁ  re teams’ to attack with automatic weapons, ﬁ  re and in-cendiary devices police stations, police cars and stores in Miami Beach.”

most students at UF, and the concept of cell-phone-addicted-screaming-girl is a trope that is ubiquitous 
in our current pop culture. (We recently saw it in an epi-sode of the Jonas Brothers’ TV show, so like, even babies know about it. Don’t ask.)
What should also be familiar, though, is the fact that 
nothing strikes fear into the heart of a passenger faster than the sight of his or her driver (and possible gatekeeper into the afterlife) lower his or her chance of a safe arrival with each staccato of the fingertips. 
To counter this, six states and Washington D.C. have 
enacted a strict ban on texting while driving and made it a ticketable offense. Florida, however, has not taken it that far. Instead of outlawing the practice, Florida is attempt-ing to kill the habit with “awareness.”
We don’t think this is the best approach. People are 
aware of the danger inherent in many activities but con-tinue to do them anyway (Camel Light, anyone?). It is ob-vious to everyone with half a brain that driving without a seat belt isn’t such a hot idea, but some of us still won’t 
wear one until we are busted with a $70 fine.
So why doesn’t Florida follow suit and ban texting 
while driving? Put simply, fear of big government. We 
understand this concern, and it seems reasonable to let 
people make their own decisions and worry about the 
consequences. 
However, it seems silly to set this issue apart from 
things that are already criminal like drug abuse and seat-belt wearing requirements, especially because these “in-
fractions” are only harmful (or potentially harmful) for 
those who engage in them. To set texting while driving apart from other activities such as driving while intoxicat-ed and shooting people by only suggesting they “try not to 
do it,” is insane considering those activities put innocent 
people at risk of death, whether it be by a 3,000 pound speeding deathmobile or a handgun.
Try telling a girl (possibly the cell-phone-addicted-
screaming-girl) that drunken driving isn’t a good idea, 
but she won’t get in trouble if she downs 97 cosmos at XS 
before jumping into her lime green Volkswagen Beetle to head to the “after party” with her “ladies.”  We don’t think she’d listen.
One might ask, “Well, if we ban texting, what’s to stop 
drivers from being distracted by iPods in their cars?” and it would be a legitimate concern. However, texting requires  more reading and more constant attention than song se-lection. Unless someone is apt to change his or her song 
choice approximately every three seconds, it wouldn’t be 
as dangerous as carrying out a full-blown conversation. (And if such person exists, they probably shouldn’t be al-lowed to drive anyway.)
Florida’s decision to use a soft approach in addressing 
this matter is spineless. Because they fear the reproach of self-proclaimed “texters,” the government refuses to pro-tect the citizens who are at the mercy of the texters. When that includes us, our friends and our moms (who take 25 
minutes to figure out how to text “call me,” God bless ‘em),  
it leads us to think that Florida isn’t really concerned with protecting its citizens. Column
Columnist reflects on political gaffes
Today’s question: Should texting 
and driving be illegal in Florida?Thursday’s question: Would you drink gasoline to be like Optimus Prime?I miss President George W. Bush, “Dubya” as I affec-
tionately called him. I don’t miss his policies or politics, 
but the material he and his administration gave me as 
a commentator. 
First there were the lost weapons of mass destruction in 
Iraq. The deciding factor to invade a country in a war that 
has killed thousands of Americans and thousands more 
Iraqis was based on either false or fabricated intelligence. 
What was the response that came from the White House? “Our bad.” 
Then, there was the time when we sacrificed our na-
tional integrity and broke a few national laws along the way when the Bush White House developed a fondness for 
rendition. There wasn’t any real outrage when the Ameri-
can public found out that its government had transported supposed enemy combatants to secret prisons around the world and tortured them. Instead, the nation gleefully 
joined in on the comedy act and said, “Those silly boys in 
Washington are up to something new every week!” 
Except they weren’t. The silly boys in Washington 
always propped themselves up against the “Defend America” platform but somehow managed to let security 
at American nuclear sites lapse. When the media discov-
ered the Port of Miami was scheduled to be sold to Dubai, United Arab Emirates, the public was appalled, but few 
were incensed when reporters discovered that less than 10 
percent of all incoming cargo at American maritime ports was screened for explosives and other potential national 
security breaches. 
To top the hilarity off, after President Bush told then-
director of the Federal Emergency Management Agency 
Michael Brown that he was “doing a heckuva job” when 
thousands were stranded for weeks after Hurricane Ka-
trina devastated the Gulf Coast, the vice president shot a 
man while quail hunting.
Sometimes, I think truth is stranger than fiction, and the truth of the Bush administra-
tion’s comedic tragedy gave me col-
umn fodder for months. 
Then Sarah Palin happened. Oh, 
the humanity! Each week there was 
something new and funny to write. There was the time when Palin com-
mented that she could see Russia 
from her house. There was the time when Palin accused candidate Ba-
rack Obama of palling around with terrorists, forgetting that her own husband belonged to a political party that had secession on its mind. There was the time when she 
took the holier-than-thou abstinence position, forgetting 
her 17-year-old daughter was pregnant. All of this played out over the soundtrack of a reasonably powerful per-son mangling the English language where even “Dubya” 
could no longer recognize it. 
Today, for the columnists, who every once in a while 
like to diverge from serious subjects to comedic ones, hope 
again lies on the horizon. Palin may have left office with 18 months left in her gubernatorial term, but surely her ambi-
tion won’t keep her away from the national spotlight for 
long. Amusement can still be found in the “birther move-ment,” where far right crazies keep coming out of the boo-
nies to challenge whether President Obama was born in 
the United States. And even in the White House, the presi-dent himself has provided comedic fodder by answering 
a question last week about the arrest of Harvard profes-
sor Henry Gates after police thought he was breaking into his own home. Within 30 seconds, Obama changed the national dialogue from a debate on health care to a “teach-
able moment” on race. 
Maybe the comedy reel will keep on rolling.

Want to live longer? As it turns out, we 
may have the answer. A report in the July 10 issue of Science showed 
a dramatic difference between the lifespan of two different sets of Rhesus monkeys in a 20-
year study. The results were so shocking that 
scientists already began seeking additional funding for another 20 years of research.
One scientist called the findings “simply 
incredible.” In the study, nearly three times as many control monkeys than test monkeys died, a remarkable achievement even in the most selective of environments.
So what is the magic formula for long life? 
Calorie restriction. Boy, that’s exciting. After 20 years and millions of dollars, researchers at the Wisconsin National Primate Research Cen-ter at the University of Wisconsin-Madison showed us all 38 starved monkeys live longer than their slothful, indulgent counterparts.
By decreasing the test monkeys’ diets by 30 
percent fewer calories, the Rhesus monkeys were shown to have 70 percent fewer instances 
of cancer, heart disease or other age-related 
conditions. Furthermore, test monkeys exhib-ited greater mental capacities and energy lev-els while the control monkey’s exhibited no-ticeable signs of aging: wrinkles, hair loss and slumping posture.
And it seems as though the good news 
doesn’t end there. Researchers at the National Institute on Aging’s Interventions Testing Pro-
gram matched this study by showing that the 
common drug Rapamycin exhibits similar ef-fects of calorie restriction. Alas, the elixir for long life. Now all we have to do is take a pill and we can live longer.
But while these findings are surely a step 
toward the ultimate goal of a long and healthy life, they are far from groundbreaking. The In-
stitute for Aging Research reported just two 
years ago that women under 5 feet 2 inches and 105 pounds are more likely to live longer than any other demographic. Thus, there seems to be at least some link to low weight and long life.
The late 20th century 
technological boom helped advance anti-aging 
research methods and expanded the field of 
biogerontology dealing with age-related is-sues. But the real increase in anti-aging at-tention comes as baby boomers seek geriatric care.
With nearly one in five Americans older 
than 65, the demand for longevity never has been higher. And while it may be true that each advancement in biogerontology brings a 
new hope for the millions of Americans in this 
age group, it remains a product of a burgeon-ing senior section.
It is a product of our society — human na-
ture — to seek long life. According to Genesis, Hebrew patriarch Methuselah was said to live 969 years. Juan Ponce de Leon discovered the fountain of youth in 1513 that fostered a youth-preserving mineral water. And James Hilton’s 
Shangri-La cultivated health, happiness and, 
of course, long life. We even look at the Hunza Valley of Pakistan and the Vilcabamba of Ec-uador, where people are said to live as long as 120 years, as examples of genetic age retar-dation. In the last two years alone, the United States has poured in more than $1.5 billion in anti-aging research funding.
Yet I for one believe that there is a comple-
ment to everything. With youth, comes age. With time, there is space. And with birth, there is death. There are constants that impact our lives that a pill cannot change. Aging remains a subtle, no doubt vital, part of our progression to this mortality. We spend all of our time try-ing to avoid death when truth be told, we don’t even know when death happens.
Now can somebody please feed those poor 
starving monkeys?

I was enjoying Jon Silman’s ar-
ticle about country music recently 
(Country music offers support, ad-vice for all stages of life — July 16). 
The opening line was, “It is the 
year of open-mindedness.” Skip to the first song he describes, however, and you’ll find, “He doesn’t care what she looks like, or if she’s too fat or old.” 
Excuse me?  The seventh song 
offers this description of drunken antics: “We start bumming smokes, hitting on fat chicks and sometimes 
end up in bed next to someone who 
should never come out in the day-time.” Nice open-mindedness, Jon.
Years ago when I first came to 
UF, I saw stenciled signs in stair-wells saying “NO FAT CHICKS!”
I was speechless. Then I saw a car 
full of guys drive past a woman on a bus bench, and they screamed the 
same thing out the window as they 
sped past. She was visibly devastat-ed, and I was sickened.
I could stoop to the same level 
and accuse these guys of covering for some sort of sexual dysfunction but that wouldn’t be open-minded.
Jon states, “If we can get past our 
initial prejudices, we may discover 
something beautifully relevant.”
Well, guess what, Jon?  People 
come in all sizes and shapes.  Find 
a more intelligent and humane way to express yourself. You might just meet someone nice.

I was struck by Roberta Roberts’ 
article on Magic Hat Beers arriving in Florida because it came across as an advertisement for a bar in the guise of a legitimate story.  
After having been a beertender 
for three years, I can tell you that Magic Hat No. 9 is not new, it is not rare (the Mellow Mushroom carries it across most of the rest of the U.S.) and by my tastes, isn’t that great.
I’m not alone: It was rated as a 
C- by the editors of BeerAdvocate magazine earlier this year.
If Alligator readers want to en-
joy rare, quality beers, Stubbie Shirt Pub, Alcove, Tim & Terry’s, Gator Beverage, Dorn’s and The Labora-tory are all havens for exploring the world of good beer. 
I’d suggest Bell’s, Steelhead and 
Oskar Blues beers, which are all far superior to anything Magic Hat 
makes.  The new brewery in Tampa, 
Cigar City, is making some amaz-ing beers, as are St. Somewhere and Holy Mackerel (both Florida-based microbreweries).
It’s very common for distributors 
to test products in new markets be-fore releasing them, and this is ex-actly what Magic Hat’s Florida dis-
tributor is doing. While Mother’s is 
lucky to have the beer now, it won’t be long before we’ll be able to buy it at Publix.
Let’s see some real beer writing

The Swamp was full of future 
college football players Friday 
night, but one athlete was the un-questioned star of the night
All eyes were on Ronald Pow-
ell, the five-star defensive end prospect from Moreno Valley (Ca-lif.) Rancho Verde High, during UF’s annual Friday Night Lights camp. Powell received a lot of at-tention from Gators coaches, staff and the media.
The rising high school senior 
lined up and caught some pass-
es during receiving drills and 
switched to the other side of the ball as well, displaying his freak-ish athleticism by lining up at linebacker. 
“They’re talking about playing 
me on both sides of the ball — de-fensive end and tight end,” Pow-ell said.
With his 6-foot-4, 230-pound 
frame and ability to play on both sides of the ball, Powell is part Cornelius Ingram and part Carlos Dunlap. 
The only prospect on Florida 
Field who went shirtless for the camp, Powell was easily the most physically impressive athlete in attendance.
When asked what position he 
preferred, he simply said, “I play everywhere.”
UF coach Urban Meyer also 
spent a good portion of his Friday night speaking with and watching Powell, whom Rivals.com ranks as the third-best player in the re-cruiting class of 2010. 
Around 9 p.m., the players 
took a knee at midfield to watch a highlight reel of the UF football team’s 2008 season, but Powell stood right by Meyer’s side at the front of the group.
When the drills concluded and 
the players were treated to a post-camp meal, Powell was surround-
ed at all times by multiple UF 
staff members, and two whisked him away to a side room in The Swamp after he left the field.
Powell has received scholar-
ship offers from UF as well as Notre Dame, Tennessee, Auburn and seven Pacific-10 Conference schools — including USC. Friday 
was the second time Powell made 
the trip across the country to visit 
Gainesville, and he expressed his admiration of UF in his brief time speaking to reporters.
“I love it here,” he said. “What’s 
not to like? They’re national champs.”

ing until a national letter of intent is signed on National Signing Day.Five-star Powell shines at Friday Night Lights camp8, ALLIGATOR � TUESDAY, JULY 28, 2009

HOOVER, Ala. — The future 
home of the UF-UGA rivalry is still 
in doubt, and Georgia coach Mark 
Richt is finished giving his opinion on the subject.
Richt made waves earlier this 
year when he said playing the game in Jacksonville — where the Gators 
have won 16 of the last 19 — is not 
a neutral atmosphere, citing distance and weather as reasons.
At Southeastern Conference Me-
dia Days on Thursday, he took a different track in hopes of avoiding 
controversy. 
“This is what I want to do: I want 
to focus on winning that game,” Richt said. “That’s all I want to focus 
on when it comes to that game.”
When asked if that meant he 
didn’t care where the game is played, Richt smiled and repeated himself.
“I really just want to focus on try-
ing to win that game. That’s my goal from here on in. That will be my pat 
answer from here on in.”
The current deal between the two 
schools will expire following the 
2010 game, and they have yet to sign 
a new contract dictating where their 
annual rivalry game will be played.
Richt favors a rotation between 
neutral sites in Jacksonville and At-lanta, something the Atlanta Sports Council has tried to accomplish in 
the past.
UF coach Urban Meyer wants to 
keep the game in Jacksonville, but he said he didn’t know where the two 
schools stood in terms of reaching a deal.
“I just love that game,” he said. “I 
love the atmosphere. It’s one of the 
unique ones in college football.”
The Bulldogs in attendance Thurs-
day were just as split on the issue as the crowd in Jacksonville Municipal 
Stadium.
Defensive tackle Jeff Owens, who 
tailgated and watched the game as a fan last year because of injury, says he’d like to see a rotating schedule.
Quarterback Joe Cox wants to 
keep the status quo.
“I really don’t care because either 
way, the stadium is going to be half 
red and half blue-and-orange,” Cox said. “If 
it’s in Atlanta, I guess 
people just want to see more Georgia fans 
outside the stadium. 
It really doesn’t matter once you get 
inside because it’s 50-50.
“I like playing in Florida because 
it’s pretty good weather, and it’s a fun game to go to.”
As Cox said, crowd demographics 
wouldn’t change much between the current site and the Georgia Dome, 
but attendance would fall. 
The dome held 75,892 for the SEC 
Championship Game last year, while 84,649 attended the UF-Georgia 
matchup in Jacksonville.
From the conference’s perspec-
tive, the site of one of its biggest ri-valry games is secondary.
“It’s a great conference rivalry, 
so the game itself is what matters,” SEC commissioner Mike Slive said. “Where it gets played is really com-
pletely in the hands of the institu-
tions.”Georgia coach, players split on game’s location“What’s not to like? They’re 
national champs.”

Football� THE FSU FOOTBALL COACH WANTS 
TO KEEP PACE WITH JOE PATERNO.
THE ASSOCIATED PRESS
GREENSBORO, N.C. — Bobby Bowden is 
approaching his 80th birthday, and he’s ask-
ing for quite the present.
The soon-to-be octogenarian hopes to 
hang on to the 14 victories the NCAA wants 
to remove from his record due to an academic 
cheating scandal.
“I’m still thinking they’ll come to their 
senses,’’ the Florida State coach said Monday with a laugh during the Atlantic Coast Con-ference’s media days.
The 79-year-old Bowden continued to ex-
press his desire to remain in a chase with Penn State’s Joe Paterno to become the winningest 
coach in major college football. Bowden enters 
his 34th season in Tallahassee with 382 career wins - one fewer than Paterno.
“They’re just going to kill a good dadgum 
competition if they take those games away,’’ Bowden said. Reporters, he added, “don’t have a darned thing to write about if they take those games away. They might do it. I hope they don’t.’’
At the heart of the dispute is whether the 
NCAA should take wins from Bowden and other coaches and athletes who had no role in a scandal that involved 61 athletes who alleg-edly cheated on an online music history test several seasons ago.
Florida State filed a 20-page appeal earlier 
this month, arguing that the penalty is too harsh and that even if the Seminoles’ program 
should lose victories, the individual records 
of coaches and players should not suffer.
“I’m going to tell (the school) to fight like 
you-know-what,’’ Bowden said. “I’m going to tell them to fight it (with) all we’re worth, and I’d fight it if I could, but there’s nothing I can do. But if we don’t win it, I’ll accept it.“As soon as we spotted (cheating), we 
turned ourselves in (and) suspended them immediately,’’ he added. “Now, are they go-ing to open up a can of worms here? Does that mean when ‘So-and-So State’ has a kid, mid-dle of the season, gets caught cheating, they found out he cheated three weeks ago, they’ve got to go back and forfeit all those games he played in? ... That’ll happen at every school in the United States of America.’’
Paterno said Monday at the Big Ten media 
day it was “ridiculous’’ that the NCAA was considering stripping Bowden of the victo-ries.
“Bobby played with what he had and he 
won with what he had,’’ Paterno said. “It bothers me a little bit that the NCAA would use him almost as a scapegoat for all of things that went on at Florida State. ... I hope they let 
him keep his wins.’’
Some of Bowden’s ACC rivals weren’t sure 
what to make of the veteran coach’s sticky 
situation.
North Carolina coach Butch Davis - whose 
rivalry with Bowden dates back to his time as an assistant at Miami in the mid-1980s and head coach there in the ‘90s - steered clear of saying too much about it.
“It’s never come up in casual conversa-
tion with any of the other coaches, and I think probably the thing is that everybody’s like, ‘That’s Bobby and Florida State’s situation,’’’ Davis said. “And none of us know.’’
Said Miami’s Randy Shannon: “We’re all 
coaches, and we’re part of the coaching fam-ily. Everybody goes through it. When it hits you, you have to weather the storm and get back in control of it.’’
Bowden turns 80 on Nov. 8 - the day af-
ter the Seminoles play son Tommy’s former team, Clemson. The family’s patriarch insist-ed he hasn’t resigned himself to losing those wins - or the chase with Paterno.
“It won’t bother me one bit. I don’t live and 
die over stuff like that,’’ Bowden said.Bowden hopes to keep 14 winsClassifieds ALLIGATOR

POLL QUESTION INSIDE UF SWIMMING TIESAP Photo
UF quarterback Tim Tebow speaks at the podium at the South-
eastern Conference Media Days in Hoover, Ala. on Thursday.
By MIKE McCALL
Alligator Staff Writer
mmccall@alligator.org
HOOVER, Ala. — Just as he did last year at 
Southeastern Conference Media Days, UF quar-
terback Tim Tebow answered questions from the 
podium, a spot usually reserved for coaches.
Only Tebow used it more like a pulpit.
For 20 minutes, the UF signal caller discussed 
topics ranging from his decision to stay for his se-
nior year to his religious beliefs. 
But before anyone could fire off a question, 
Tebow addressed the biggest mystery floating 
around the conference: Which coach left Tebow off his preseason All-SEC First-Team ballot?
“I’m glad to be here. No, I do not know who did 
not vote for me. I’ve gotten that question a lot,” he said.
Many questions in Hoover last 
week focused on Tebow, as nearly every player and coach was asked about him.
UF coach Urban Meyer and Mis-
sissippi State’s Dan Mullen were 
asked to divulge Tebow’s annoying habits, and players were asked whether he’s the toughest op-ponent they have ever faced.
Needless to say, the attention just intensified 
when Tebow arrived, with seemingly no topic off limits.
During a radio interview Thursday, Tebow was 
asked whether he’s waiting until marriage to have sex, to which he responded, “Yes, I am.”
When another reporter couldn’t find the right 
words for a follow-up, Tebow interjected, “I think you’re stunned right now. You can’t even ask a 
question. ... I was ready for that question, but I 
don’t think y’all were.”
Since his days at Nease High, Tebow has become 
a very comfortable public speaker. His speech after 
the loss to Mississippi last season quickly became 
legend (another hot topic at Media Days), and he looked at ease on Thursday.Tebow steals spotlight at Media Days
HOOVER, Ala. 
Let’s all take a minute and give thanks 
for the gift of Steve Spurrier.
The Head Ball Coach put an end 
to the “TebowGate” debacle Friday when 
he admitted it was him who voted Ole Miss 
quarterback Jevan Snead preseason All-SEC First Team and in the process reminded us why Media Days can be so much fun.
Spurrier didn’t do it out of jealousy. He 
didn’t even do it because he thought Snead was a better player than Tebow.
This was a crime of indifference.“I’ve been do-
ing the preseason ballots for 17 years. I’ve never filled one out,” 
Spurrier said.
Spurrier said 
it was South 
Carolina Direc-tor of Football 
Operations Jamie Speronis who filled out the ballot and that he signed off on the list afterward.“I can tell you two guys who were on 
there: A.J. Green and Carlos Dunlap. I saw those two guys were on there and said, ‘Yeah, that’s fine,’” Spurrier said.
From what we gathered at Media Days, 
none of the coaches actually take the time to fill these things out. Most of the leg work is done by the sports information departments, and that’s just fine.
Preseason awards are largely meaning-
less.
“I don’t know why we vote. I guess we 
vote ‘cause college football is still without a playoff system,” Spurrier said. “I really be-lieve most coaches do not know a whole lot about other teams, but we do vote.”
He’s right, of course. Most coaches don’t 
have time to evaluate every team in the 
country.
In fact, Spurrier is probably right about 
most things. The college game would be bet-
ter off if everyone would just follow his lead. At the very least, we’d all have a lot more fun.
This was my first encounter with the Ol’ 
All-SEC misvote just one example of Spurrier’s unique personalityHOOVER, Ala. 
It’s a small world 
for Ole Miss rising star quarterback 
Jevan Snead.
The man who (mo-
mentarily) took away a 
unanimous preseason 
All-SEC First-Team nod from Tim Tebow seems to be at the cen-ter of the college football universe.
Snead transferred to Ole Miss after spending 
his freshman year at Texas and posted more than 2,700 yards and 26 touchdowns through the air.
After getting a chance to talk with the junior 
signal caller, I have decided to compile a list of the top storylines Snead is directly connected to for the upcoming season.
From No. 5 to 1, here’s the list:  
5. TENNESSEE — The Vols new coach, Lane 
Kiffin, has made a lot of noise this offseason, but one move few can question is the hiring of for-mer Rebels head coach Ed Orgeron as his associ-
ate head coach. When Snead decided to transfer 
to Ole Miss from Texas, Orgeron was the Rebels’ coach. Snead sat out a season, and by the time he was eligible to play last season, Houston Nutt had replaced Coach O as the head coach.
4. TExAS —  Texas is one of the best teams in 
the nation and one of the favorites to meet UF in the national championship this season. Long-
horns quarterback Colt McCoy beat out Snead 
for the starting job when the two were freshmen 
the year after Texas climbed to the top of the col-
lege football mountain.
3. UF — Snead led the Rebels to victory in The 
Swamp last season, handing the Gators their only All roads lead to 
Rebels’ Snead

MEN’S HOOPS SCHEDULE

Monday. UF will face national runner-up Michigan St. and Syracuse in neutral-site games and will host xavier in February. By PHIL KEGLER

 Come spring, there will be a 
new sport on campus to capture 
your attention.
UF students, we present...
women’s lacrosse.
Yep, that’s right, while the 
sport was formally announced years ago, we are now ﬁ  nally 
207 days from the Gators’ season 
opener — Feb. 20 against Jackson-
ville.
This, of course, 
begs the burning question: How will 
women’s lacrosse 
be received in 
Gainesville?
The groundwork for the sport 
(really, it’s like building a com-pletely new program, since it 
needed a new stadium and there 
was no men’s equivalent already 
on campus) has been laid since June 14, 2006, when Athletics Di-
rector Jeremy Foley announced 
the newest varsity sport was com-
ing to Gainesville.
The sport is certainly gain-
ing popularity nationwide. The NCAA has sanctioned a collegiate champion in women’s lacrosse 
since 1982, and the sport divided itself into the traditional Division I, II and III subdivisions in 2001.
Success has had a decidedly 
northeast ﬂ  avor, however. All four Division I champions (Mary-
land, Princeton twice, Virginia 
and Northwestern ﬁ  ve times) 
have come from that region of the 
country, where lacrosse is similar in popularity to sports like base-
ball, basketball and football in the 
South.
There will be no easy transi-
tion for the Gators, as they are joining the American Lacrosse 
Conference, a seven-team league 
containing fellow Southeastern Conference schools Vanderbilt 
and South Carolina as well as 
ﬁ  ve-time reigning national champ 
Northwestern.
When UF takes the ﬁ  eld for 
its season opener in February — 
there will likely be some exhibi-
tion matches in the fall, still to be 
announced — it will be 13 years 
since the Gators had an inaugural 
season (there was softball’s debut 
in 1997 and before that soccer in 
1995).
And those two teams are evi-
dence that if you win early, the fans will come. The soccer team 
won a championship in its fourth 
season and the softball team 
earned an NCAA Tournament ap-pearance in its second year.
With UF ﬂ  ourishing in so many 
non-revenue sports, on-the-ﬁ  eld success usually determines what 
program will get the added carry-over support from the traditional Gators football and men’s basket-
ball fan.
On that end, surface knowl-
edge shows UF has done its home-
work.
Foley, known for his ability to 
hire great up-and-coming coaches, tapped National Lacrosse Hall of 
Fame member Amanda O’Leary to head the UF women’s lacrosse program. O’Leary came to UF af-
ter coaching at Yale for 14 years. When she left, she ranked ﬁ  fth among active coaches in career 
winning percentage (.714), and Foley brought her to Gainesville 
in June 2007 in order to give her plenty of time to lay the ground-
work.
O’Leary’s ﬁ  rst recruiting class, 24 women strong, will make its way onto campus in the fall and includes seven players named to the US Lacrosse High School All-
America Team as juniors.
So the Gators have a beautiful 
stadium, a well-established coach 
and a young but talented crop of players.
Now, the question remains: 
How long until the program ﬁ  nds success, and more importantly, 
how many people will care? How will women’s lacrosse 
be received in Gainesville?18, ALLIGATOR � TUESDAY, JULY 28, 2009

Top 10 Burning Questions for 2009-10
#8
Ball Coach, and he was everything I wanted 
him to be —  reluctantly charming, bitingly sarcastic and completely unapologetic.
Spurrier is what’s good about football. He says what he wants and means what he 
says.
Just when you think he’s about to explain 
the complexities of the 3-4 defense, he offers 
up the kind of off-the-wall comment that leaves the room crippled with laughter.
When asked about defensive coordinator Lorenzo Ward, the coach gave this assess-
ment:
“He’s a good guy. Loves to play golf,” 
Spurrier said. “We’ve had a bunch of golf 
games together. I’ve actually got about four or ﬁ  ve coaches on the staff that love to play golf. I don’t know what that means. He’s a pretty good stick.”
So maybe he doesn’t go over his pre-
season ballots with a ﬁ  ne-tooth comb, but on entertainment value alone, he’s worth the price of admission.
If we’re lucky, maybe we’ll all get anoth-
er hole-in-one next year. MIKE , from page 17loss and sparking the now-famous post-
game speech from Tebow. Long before that, UF coach Urban Meyer recruited 
Snead to come play quarterback for the 
Gators even though he was in the same class as Tebow. In “Meat Market,” a book about football recruiting by ESPN’s Bruce Feldman, Snead said that Meyer told him Tebow was going to play line-backer and that Snead would be able to come in and play quarterback. Snead was understandably skeptical and de-com-
mitted from UF after Tebow committed.  
2. SEC v S. Big 12 DEBatE —  The Big 12 
has been gaining ground on the South-
eastern Conference for league suprema-cy in recent years, and some experts feel as though there is a new power. Snead is able to offer an interesting perspective, as he played in both conferences and 
went on record in Hoover as saying he 
believes the SEC is the best conference in college football, in part due to the better defenses. Also, Snead led Ole Miss to a 47-34 victory over Texas Tech in the Cot-ton Bowl last season in one of two bowl victories for the SEC against the Big 12.
1. thE hEiSman trophy — Perhaps 
no storyline is more enduring through-out the season than the Heisman Tro-phy race. Snead is getting most of the preseason love as the fourth contestant for this year’s award, behind the three-headed monster of Sam Bradford, Mc-Coy and Tebow. Snead said he landed at Ole Miss because he didn’t feel UF 
or Texas had a place for him. If Snead 
makes it to New York as a Heisman fi-nalist, he will be sharing the stage and the evening with the two guys who chased him out of town.By ADAM BERRY

Mack Brown didn’t work out 
or participate in any drills Friday 
night, but he drew everyone’s attention just by saying a few words.
Brown, a four-star running 
back prospect from Lithonia (Ga.) Martin Luther King High, became the 16th oral commitment of the Gators’ 2010 recruiting class at UF’s fifth annual Friday Night Lights camp.
Brown made his intentions 
known to coach Urban Meyer and the UF staff following the camp. 
“I talked to Florida coaches 
more than I talked to any other coaches, so that was the biggest thing for me,” Brown said. “They showed me a lot of stuff about what they’re going to do next year with (UF quarterback John) Brant-ley, so it’ll be more of an I-forma-tion team.”
The 5-foot-11, 185-pound run-
ning back chose UF over Georgia, a decision he thinks may earn him a hard time from his friends who 
root for the nearby Bulldogs.
According to Rivals.com, 
Brown is the sixth-best running 
back in the country and the No. 56 overall prospect. He said he an-
ticipates competing with other UF 
running backs for playing time 
and compared himself to Minne-sota Vikings running back Adrian Peterson, adding that he tries to 
set the bar high.
“I work hard, and God blessed 
me with a lot of talent,” Brown 
said. “I love competition.”
Although Brown’s verbal com-
mitment was the biggest story of the night, more than 200 recruits 
tried to make a name for them-
selves in The Swamp in front of UF coaches and players.
“There were a lot of great ath-
letes out here,” said UF 2010 oral commit Trey Burton. “I think (Fri-day) was a really good night for 
recruiting.”
Burton didn’t participate in 
any drills with the other players, 
but he stuck to his role as unoffi-
cial recruiter, a job he has played 
to perfection in helping piece to-gether UF’s 2010 recruiting class.
Burton, a quarterback out of 
Venice High, met Brown at Friday 
Night Lights last year, when Mey-
er expressed an interest in pursu-ing the running back. Burton and Brown became friends quickly, 
and the two frequently send text 
messages to each other.
“When Tebow was a senior in 
high school, that’s what he did — he went and got Percy,” Burton 
said. “So it comes with the posi-
tion. Whether you like it or not, 
you still have to do it. I think do-
ing this will definitely help us win, and I’m the worst loser ever.”
With UF’s offense likely to 
undergo many changes once Tim Tebow graduates and Brantley takes over at quarterback, Burton 
thinks he and Brown will work 
well together in the new scheme.
“He can do everything. He can 
line up in the I — he’s just an all-
around running back,” Burton 
said. “I think we’re going to have an awesome option game when he gets up here with he and I run-
ning it.”
As Ben Hill Griffin Stadium’s 
impressive new video boards 
showed highlight reels of UF’s 2008 season — a running score-
board of every game on one side 
and the final boxscore of last sea-
son’s UF-FSU game on the other 
— Burton added that he was ready to get out on the field and play.
But Meyer knew his combo 
recruit/recruiter could be put to 
better use, so he told him to work 
on convincing some players to orally commit to UF rather than 
participate in passing drills. His 
efforts paid off with Brown, who Burton shadowed for much of the night.
Already determined to become 
a Gator and play for Meyer, Bur-ton said he was aware of the ru-
mors that his possible future coach 
might leave for Notre Dame.
“I knew he wasn’t going any-
where,” Burton said. “As soon 
as that came out, I got an e-mail 
(from Meyer) saying he wasn’t 
going anywhere, so I wasn’t wor-
ried about that.”
gLEnn rEmovED F or “U”: Miami 
oral commit Tavadis Glenn flashed 
the “U” sign and was kicked out of 
the camp for doing so. UF released 
a statement saying Glenn left be-cause of “potential safety issues 
to other campers.” For an exclu-
sive video of Glenn flashing the 
sign, check out alligatorSports.org. 
Oral commitments are non-bind-
ing until a national letter of intent is 
signed on National Signing Day.

UF coach Urban Meyer talks to campers at the fifth annual Friday Night Lights football camp in Ben Hill Griffin Stadium on Friday. The Gators received their 16th oral 
commitment for the class of 2010 when four-star running back prospect Mack Brown announced his intentions to attend UF after the camp. 
At times, the interview session bordered 
on a sermon, with Tebow seeming to dis-
patch advice to those in the room about 
how to avoid complacency.
“So many times in every aspect of life, 
people are worried about getting by,” 
Tebow said. “You’re worried about, ‘I can’t 
wait to get done with this so I have my free 
time. I can’t wait to get this interview done with Tim Tebow so I can get it over with, instead of worrying about how it can be the best it can be.’ In so many different ways, 
that’s people’s mindset.”
Tebow also discussed the positives and 
negatives of his fame, including the never-
ending media and fan attention that he says 
makes it difficult to do simple things like eat 
at a restaurant in peace.
“But also you think about it, because of 
that, because of the articles that y’all have written and because of the articles that peo-ple continue to write, it’s not only backlash from it, but there’s also a lot of positive,” he said.
“There have been a lot of people that 
have been encouraged not to have an abor-tion because they heard the story of my 
mom, or they have been encouraged be-
cause they have heard me give my faith on TV or in a report or something. You know what, although there has been a backlash, oh well. I’ll deal with it if I have to.”
And just as he ended his now-famous 
postgame speech, Tebow left the podium in Hoover with a “God bless.”QB discusses fighting complacency

UF senior quarterback By ADAM BERRY

 The UF softball team reached new 
heights during the last two seasons. 
Behind the arm of pitcher Stacey Nelson, the Gators went a combined 
133-10 in 2008 and 2009, reaching 
the Women’s College World Series both years.
But Nelson has thrown her last 
pitch as a Gator. Kim Waleszonia, 
UF’s all-time hits leader, won’t be back on the ﬁ  eld in 2010. Same goes for 
Ali Gardiner, Kris-
tina Hilberth and the rest of the 2009 
senior class.
That presents the question: How 
will the softball team respond this season after losing such a talented group of seniors, especially Nelson?
Fortunately for UF coach Tim 
Walton, the heart of his lineup will return in 2010. Rising senior Franc-esca Enea will likely enter the season as one of the nation’s top-rated hit-ters, and she will be joined by Kelsey Bruder, Megan Bush and Corrie Brooks. Those four combined for 61 home runs and 237 RBI in 2009.
Add a healthy Tiffany DeFelice, who was hampered by a wrist injury during her sophomore year after an outstanding freshman year, and the Gators likely won’t face many prob-lems they can’t hit their way out of.
In addition to the returning 
power hitters, rising junior Aja Pac-
ulba made a smooth transition to 
the leadoff spot, where Waleszonia batted her ﬁ  rst three years at UF. Paculba is one of the Gators’ most versatile hitters, and her skill on the basepaths will only improve. 
Despite the talented veteran core, 
Walton was forced by injuries to de-velop some of his younger players. 
Rising sophomores Alicia Sisco and 
Michelle Moultrie saw time in the outﬁ  eld and at the plate last season, and they will likely ﬁ  nd their roles signiﬁ  cantly increased in 2010.
Although the majority of the line-
up is returning and the new players gained experience in 2009, the team will be reliant upon rising junior 
Stephanie Brombacher in the circle 
this season. She was statistically one of the nation’s best pitchers as a back-up last year. Brombacher pushed her undefeated career record to 42-0 with 22 wins last season. She put up a 0.84 ERA and struck out 190 bat-ters in 158.2 innings pitched.
But she will be the unquestioned 
No. 1 in 2010, and that could poten-tially be a rocky transition.
Although Brombacher’s adjust-
ment from backup to ace will take some time, the talent will still be there, and Walton has established UF as a legitimate contender. So maybe the better question is: 
Can the softball team make it back for a third-straight WCWS berth? 20, ALLIGATOR � TUESDAY, JULY 28, 2009
 Harrison Diamond / Alligator Staff  
 UF rising junior Stephanie Brombacher will take over the primary starting pitcher role with the 
graduation of legend Stacey Nelson. Brombacher went 22-0 with a 0.84 ERA as a backup this year.
