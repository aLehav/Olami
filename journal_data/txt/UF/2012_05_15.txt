Budget proposals released 
Friday aim to leave open fac-
ulty positions unﬁ  lled and lay off some staff while leaving tenure-track faculty and degree 
programs unscathed by budget 
cuts.
Smathers Libraries an-
nounced earlier last week it plans to deal with its $1.3 mil-lion budget cut in part by clos-ing the journalism and music libraries and relocating their respective faculty and collec-
tions.
Other notable cuts include 
an $800,000 reduction in the In-
stitute of Food and Agricultural Sciences’ recurring renovation funds and distance education facilities upgrades and a $5.9 million overall cut to the Col-lege of Liberal Arts and Sci-
ences.
Colleges are also using attri-
tion to weather the cuts, mean-
ing some faculty positions opening up this year due to re-tirement and other predictable factors will not be reﬁ  lled.
One side effect of having 
fewer faculty teaching the same number of students is an increase in the size of some 
classes.
However, UF Provost Joe 
Glover said, the university 
doesn’t have 
a freeze on hiring new f a c u l t y . Deans will 
hire replace-
ment faculty 
according to the needs of each college.
“Yes, they have to take a 
net cut of a certain number of dollars, but within the budgets they have, they need to man-age the college,” he said of the 
college deans. “We still have to 
meet student demand.”

How much is your Student Body 
president worth?
At UF, former President Anthony 
Reynolds was worth an $8,995.56 
yearly salary , plus $4,050 in beneﬁ  ts. 
That’s about $7,000 less than the 
president at the University of Cen-tral Florida.
High-ranking UF Student Gov-ernment ofﬁ  cials earn salaries, but 
some also get special parking passes, 
cellphone payments and preﬁ  lled meal cards for on-campus dining.
These beneﬁ  ts have been hotly 
debated in the past few SG election cycles. Reducing them was part of 
the Students Party’s Fall 2011 cam-
paign, and in the Spring 2012 execu-tive debate, candidates attacked each other over topics such as perks.
Students Party and Unite Party candidates didn’t come to any agree-
ment on whether SG ofﬁ  cials should 
receive beneﬁ  ts.
The elections 
are over, but stu-dents still don’t 
agree.
Students Party 
Sen. Carly Wilson 
has been vocal 
about the issue campaigning for Stu-dent Body treasurer and in Student 
Senate meetings. She pulls a Diet 
Coke and a sandwich out of her bag for lunch, she said, so she doesn’t see why executives can’t, too.
The Student Body president, vice 
president and treasurer each get a 
meal card. The cards were good for 
up to $3,000 each in the 2011-2012 year, and that will drop to $1,000 for 2012-2013. The Senate Budget & Ap-propriations Committee got a collec-tive meal card of up to $500 for the 
2011-2012 year, which has been cut 
in half for 2012-2013.
Committee Chairwoman Chris-
tina Bonarrigo said the meal card allows her and the eight other com-mittee members to grab lunch dur-
ing several day-long meetings. She 
said they usually restrict themselves to a Subway sandwich, a drink and UF’s SG ofﬁ  cials make least proﬁ  ts out of large state schools

Calif. family wakes to find Lexus in 
their pool
LA PUENTE, Calif. (AP) — The 
Diaz family awoke to find a Lexus 
at the bottom of their swimming pool.
The Southern California fam-
ily told the San Gabriel Valley Tribune that drivers navigating the tricky intersection next to their house in La Puente have hit their cinderblock wall before, but early Sunday one of them smashed right through it in his silver sedan, then sank into the pool. A crane later fished out the 2006 Lexus.
California Highway Patrol of-
ficer Steve Licon said the driver — 40-year-old Modesto Cabral — was able to escape from the car through the passenger side window and had only minor injuries.
Jail records show he was 
booked on suspicion of drunken driving and was being held on 
$10,000 bail.

Teen arrested after homework left 
at crime scene
OREM, Utah (AP) — An 18-
year-old Utah man was arrested 
on suspicion of burglary after po-lice say he left his homework at the crime scene.
Police in Orem say they tracked 
a USB drive found at the burglar -
ized home to Dallas Naljahih. They say the computer hard drive con-tained his homework and was in a backpack left in the backyard.
A 75-year-old man and his wife 
reported their home had been bur -
glarized early Saturday. The hus-band said he was woken up by a light in his office, and found a man who was looking through a desk.
The suspect punched the man 
and fled on foot.
Police said Naljahih was found 
asleep at his house with evidence connecting him with the burglary.

Man makes amends for stealing 
plants in 1958
NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) — No 
matter how much digging inves-
tigators did, the crime remained open until a thief turned himself in and returned the fruits of his theft.
In this case, the crime was steal-
ing two hydrangeas in May 1958 from Centennial Park in Nash-guess in a recent multistate lottery game.
An Arizona Lottery spokes-
woman said the Glendale man claimed six $1 million prizes after purchasing six Powerball tickets with the same winning numbers late last month.
The tickets were good for a 
half dozen second-place prizes, and he picked up his $6 million in winnings over the course of sev-
eral visits to the Arizona Lottery’s 
headquarters in Phoenix.
Lottery spokeswoman Karen 
Bach said the man doesn’t want 
his identity released.

Fla. author’s book confused with 
‘50 Shades’
PARKLAND, Fla. (AP) — The 
author of a book called “Shades of 
Gray” says her work is being con-fused with that of a chart-topping erotic fiction writer.
Susanne Jacoby Hale, a Flori-
da author, said she has received emails, Facebook messages and phone calls from people thinking she wrote “Fifty Shades of Grey.”
“Fifty Shades of Grey,” by Brit-
ish author E L James, has sold mil-lions of copies and became a sensa-tion among women drawn to the 
sadomasochistic romance between 
a college student and a wealthy entrepreneur.
Hale’s book is about a dropout 
prevention teacher.
The South Florida Sun-Sentinel 
reported even Hale’s family mem-bers are being approached. Her husband, a medical sales represen-
tative, said doctors regularly ap-
proach him wanting to talk about 
the book.
— THE ASSOCIATED PRESSville. And the thief, 72-year-old 
Bill Teitleff of Joy , Ky ., returned 
plants from the root system of the purloined flowers to the park on Thursday.
Teitleff told WSMV-TV in 
Nashville he took the flowering plant because he didn’t have enough money to buy a Mother’s Day gift for his mother. At the 
time of the theft, Teitleff was 18 
years old and just married.
Eventually , the past caught 
up with Teitleff and he didn’t like how it felt.
Teitleff says he can now walk 
through Centennial Park with-out feeling guilty.

No border dispute here: Vt., N.H. 
reaffirm boundary
NORWICH, Vt. (AP) — In 
case you were wondering, the 
Vermont-New Hampshire bor -
der hasn’t changed.
The two states’ attorneys gen-
eral have reaffirmed their shared boundary.
State laws require the two 
to meet every seven years to reaffirm the border. The laws followed a 1935 U.S. Supreme Court decision that settled what had been a bitter dispute.
New Hampshire Attorney 
General Michael Delaney and Vermont Attorney General Wil-liam Sorrell fulfilled their respon-sibility Monday on a bridge over the Connecticut River between Norwich, Vt., and Hanover, N.H.
The two lawyers joked at first 
about the dispute that started 
over which state would be able 
to tax a southern V ermont paper mill. The court ruled in 1935 the boundary is the low-water mark on the Vermont side of the river.

A few lights shone dim-
ly through the windows of 
Calico Jack’s Oyster Bar & Seafood House, but they were the only signs of life 
in the otherwise deserted 
bar Monday afternoon.
Landlord Tom Mowry 
of Equilease of Gainesville Inc. evicted the restaurant and sports bar’s owners last week for not paying their rent.
The owners of Calico 
Jack’s could not be reached for comment Monday.
Mowry, who notiﬁ  ed 
them through the court system, said although he had not talked to the own-ers, the eviction was not a surprise to them.
In April 2011, the res-
taurant failed a routine state health inspection. Violations included cock-roaches and ﬂ  ies in the kitchen, slime in an ice ma-chine and grease buildup on cooking surfaces.
The restaurant closed 
for a day and was allowed to reopen.
Owner Vinod Bajaj said 
at the time that business had not been affected by the failed inspection. 
He also said he had 
taken over the restaurant some time within the pre-vious 10 years.
Mowry said three or 
four parties have expressed interest in the restaurant location at 3501 SW Sec-ond Ave.
“We will have it open 
in some form by football season in August,” he said. “I’m sure it will cater to students and be appropri-ate for families as well.”

An unidentiﬁ  ed man shot two 
people Sunday night after an argu-
ment.
The man shot a woman and a 
man with a pistol in Tent City at 10:51 p.m. on Sunday. 
Tent City is located around 100 
SE 11th Ave.
Detectives are still searching for 
the suspect. 
Police described him as a black man about 5 feet 10 inches tall with a medium build. 
He was reported to be wearing 
all black clothing at the time.
The suspect confronted the vic-
tims on a trail near Tent City, an area where many homeless people live, according to Sgt. Tscharna Senn, acting spokeswoman for Gainesville 
Police Department. 
After an argument, the suspect 
shot both the man and the woman 
several times. 
Police have not identiﬁ  ed either of the victims.
The male victim was transported 
to Shands at UF. He was in a critical 
condition but stable as of Monday 
afternoon, Senn said.
The female victim did not have 
any life-threatening injuries, she 
said.
Anyone with information about 
the crime is encouraged to call 
Crime Stoppers at 372-STOP or the 
GPD Detectives Bureau at 393-7670.
Contact Ben Brasch at bbrasch@
alligator.org.Police searching for suspect in shootingbudget proposal, highly anticipated by those who 
opposed a  previous proposal containing heavy cuts to the Computer and Information Science and Engi-neering department, was mysteriously vague.
A plan released by College of Engineering Dean 
Cammy Abernathy in April called for all computer engineering degree programs to be moved from the Computer and Information Science and Engi-neering department to the Electrical and Computer Engineering department. CISE teaching assistants, research and graduate staff  would be eliminated and half of the faculty could move to another de-partment.
According to the proposal submitted Friday, the 
College of Engineering will eliminate seven staff positions and leave one faculty position to attrition. Glover said the staff cuts don’t include temporary employees, so the employment status of teaching assistants will be left up to the departments.
“Basically, there’s no details in [Abernathy’s] 
plan, and that’s very troubling,” said Ph.D. student Nuri Yeralan, 28, one of the leaders in the move-ment to save CISE. “We’re worried that that vague-
ness could be ominous, but we’re not sure yet.”
CISE professor Meera Sitharam said her depart-
ment plans to dip into its reserves and find a way to 
generate new revenue to avoid cutting TAs.
“The college will be giving us less money,” 
Sitharam said, “but we won’t see the effect of that cut in our department because we’ll use our reserves 
and we’ll generate extra revenue.”
Abernathy announced on May 1 each depart-
ment in the College of Engineering would be cut by 
the same 2.9 percent.
However, Sitharam said, when faculty attrition 
is taken into account, the actual value of the cut is closer to 8 percent.
“If you factor all this in,” Sitharam said, “it does 
not turn out to be an across-the-board cut.”

Previous plans to build a lei-
sure pool with a lazy river at the 
Broward Pool may have been can-celed, but the renovated pool is now open for summer.
The UF Department of Housing 
and Residence Education financed the renovations with $29,650 in op-erational funds generated by dor -
mitory rent.
The renovations began on 
March 19 and kept the pool closed until Monday. The pool is now open during its normal summer hours, from  1 p.m. to 6 p.m.
The department decided to re-
move Broward Pool’s old plaster finish because of deterioration.
“The plaster finish had worked 
its way loose from the concrete,” 
said Mark Hill, associate director 
of Housing for Facilities Manage-ment.
The last renovations made to 
the pool were in 2003.
Now, the pool’s new smooth, 
pebble finish is accompanied by several safety-based renovations.
The pool’s primary drain covers 
were replaced, additional depth 
markers were installed and the ladder guards were replaced. After repairs, the pool was chemically 
balanced, cleaned and vacuumed.
Eight new chairs were also add-
ed to the facility.
The department hired the pri-
vate company White Sands Pool Plastering to conduct the renova-tions.Hill said in the past five years, 
renovations have also been made at the Tanglewood Village pool.
A previous plan for more exten-
sive renovations  included a drop slide, waterfalls and a simulated 
surfing attraction at the Broward 
Pool, but were not pursued be-cause of the cost of the project.
Twenty-two-year-old Joey Ra-
dice, Aquatics Program Assistant 
at the Department of Recreational 
Sports, said developments to the facility help the university’s pools 
keep up with improvements other 
recreational facilities have received 
in recent years.“It’s good they’re conscious of 
keeping the facilities up-to-date 
and making sure there were no leaks or chemical imbalances,” 
he said about the housing depart-
ment.
Radice said having the renova-
tions done by summer will contrib-ute to a better college experience 
for incoming freshmen in nearby 
dorms.
“The students are usually fresh-
men and sophomores who haven’t been around to notice differences,” 
he said. Broward Pool reopens without waterfalls, surfing simulation

UF’s Board of Trustees elected a new chair -
man just in time to put his name on spring 
graduates’ diplomas.
Board of Trustees vice chairman David 
Brown, a 1973 UF alumnus and chairman of 
Broad and Cassel law firm, was elected on 
May 3.
The board had until May 4 to select a re-placement for former chairman Carlos Al-fonso, who served on the Board of Trustees for 11 years and resigned on April 23. His term would have expired June 30, 2013.
“I couldn’t be more happy or more thrilled 
about the leadership we are possibly select-ing,” Trustee Alan Levine said prior to the vote.
Brown is taking over at a critical time for 
the university. Last month, the governor ap-proved a statewide budget that cut $38.2 mil-lion from UF, which the Board of Trustees will vote on later this month.
Brown recognized that 
wins and losses during the legislative session have left 
the board with numerous challenges in front of it.
“I think that we all can 
expect to have extra respon-
sibilities placed upon us in the comingmonths and in the next year,” he said.Marshall Criser III, president of AT&T in 
Florida and son of former UF President Mar -
shall Criser Jr., was elected vice chairman.
The board also welcomed new Student 
Body President Tj Villamil and thanked out-going Faculty Senate Chairman Scott Nygren for his service. Cheri Brodeur is the new chair -
woman as of June 1.

a bag of chips each, and she gives receipts 
to the SG Finance office.
Bonarrigo said there’s nothing wrong 
with UF providing food for meetings.
The committee only gets a meal card, 
but some officials have more benefits.
Six officials get cellphone payments 
up to a certain amount. This year, though, it grew complicated.
For the Fall 2011 semester, the presi-
dent got $125 each month, the vice presi-dent and treasurer each got $100, and the senate president and president pro tem-pore also each got $65 every month. The 
heads of SG agencies Accent Speaker’s 
Bureau and Student Government Pro-ductions also each got $65 every month.
For the spring, though, administrators 
slashed all the payments to $50 monthly.
Parking passes allow six of those stu-
dents to park in restricted areas like the service drive to the Reitz Union. The president is the exception, because he or she already gets a Board of Trustees park-ing pass. The SG passes are intended for official business, and an invoice valued them at $150 each.
Tj Villamil, UF’s incoming Student 
Body president and exiting treasurer, said these are necessary . He spends most 
of the day in the Reitz Union, he said, but 
when he isn’t there, the parking permit helps him get to meetings quickly. Vil-lamil said he to check emails throughout the day on his cellphone.
He knows some students look at meal 
cards unfavorably . Outside revenue funds can’t go to student activities, though, and he said the benefits are small compared to how much money SG handles.
He said the money could go toward 
an SG-sponsored charity event, but it can’t directly benefit students.
But Wilson said she is confident some-
one could figure out a better use for the money. She said the benefits aren’t neces-sary and distance SG officials from aver -
age students and their daily concerns.
UF is the only large state school that 
gives such perks, but it’s also the lowest-paying in terms of SG officials’ salaries.
Virlany Taboada, the Student Body 
treasurer for the 2010-2011 year, said she could not have taken the job without the salary. It’s a service to the students, but it’s impossible to also work part-time.
Taboada is a first-generation college 
student, and her parents saved money 
for a down payment on a used Nissan 
Sentra for when she became treasurer. She was responsible for monthly pay-ments, which her salary just covered.
She didn’t think more was needed 
because it’s a service with invaluable re-wards.
“To put a dollar on that — yeah, I 
think it’s enough,” she said.
But it’s not the salaries that bother 
Wilson. It’s the benefits, she said.
Villamil pointed out that UF benefits 
pale in comparison to the five-figure sala-ries that some officials make at Florida State University , UCF and the University of South Florida.
And she doesn’t care that FSU, UCF 
and USF pay more people and more per person than UF does for its six salaried SG officials.
They’re independent to her.“We should be holding ourselves to 
the highest possible standard in order to represent the students who elected us,” she said.
Part of the debate is what else could 
be done with this money . Villamil said the outside revenue fund, which includes money from apartment fairs at the Reitz Colonnade and concessions revenues.
Cellphone payments, however, come 
from student-paid Activity and Service Fee money, according to an invoice.
Villamil said that’s why he wants to 
keep UF’s current system of salaries and benefits, rather than converting to just salaries — less of it comes from students.
The cellphone money , which is from 
student fees, is decreasing, and past in-voices show that SG officials used to get 
money for a phone, not just for a plan.
He doesn’t think the students would 
stand for more of their fees going to of-
ficials, and he doesn’t see UF adopting a system like those at FSU, UCF and USF.
“Those kids are getting paid basical-
lyon students’ Activity and Service Fees,” 
he said.

� THEY BREED LOCALLY 
IN PAYNE’S PRAIRIE.
CHRIS ALCANTARA
Alligator Contributing Writer
Love is in the air, and it has 
wings.
Cupid made his rounds in 
February, which can only mean 
one thing: It’s lovebug season.
As Gainesville residents 
and UF students prepare for summer, lovebugs are out in full force for breeding season. Some bugs lay eggs, while oth-ers leave their signature white splotches on windshields.
The bugs are found through-
out the southeastern United 
States, said John Capinera, 
chairman of the department of Entomology and Nematology at UF. Infestation in Florida is heaviest in the area between Vero Beach and Orlando, espe-cially in wet areas.
In Gainesville, the bugs 
breed in Paynes Prairie, he said, 
but they ﬁ  nd a way to spread 
their love throughout the city.
“You can drive in any direc-
tion and encounter swarms of them,” he said.Capinera said the bugs go 
through two mating cycles a year: one from April through May and again from August through September.
The bugs lay their eggs in 
areas with water, dead leaves, grass clippings and even cow manure, he said. Once the eggs hatch, larvae feed on the leaves until they grow into adults.
Without a known natural 
predator, the bugs thrive dur-ing breeding season.
Capinera said birds and oth-
er hunters steer clear from the bugs because they have orange on their bodies, which is nor-mally a warning sign that a bug is poisonous.
The lovebugs shamelessly 
shag on car hoods and wind-shields while ﬂ  irting with dan-ger along roads and highways.
Some experts believe love-
bugs are attracted to the exhaust fumes from automobiles.
Norman Leppla, professor 
of entomology and nematol-ogy at UF, said he believes the fumes mimic odors emitted from decaying organic matter found at breeding sites.

OPINIONS EDITORSummer semester has arrived.
The Alligator Editorial Board wants to welcome back all 
returning students and introduce ourselves to those who 
are new to Gainesville.
It would be an understatement to say we had an exciting and 
eventful spring semester.
Among almost daily breaking news, newspapers being 
thrown away and elections on every level, we had our hands 
full. We enjoyed every second of delivering the news.
Of course, every new semester brings changes. Though we 
have a new set of editors, new reporters and new columnists, we want to continue our successes from last semester.
But there is always room for improvement.
First, it is important to note that during the summer semes-
ter, we will only be publishing on Tuesdays and Thursdays each 
week.
That being said, we will still be your first and most reliable 
source for breaking news on our website at www.alligator.org.
Over the summer, it will be our goal to expand and improve 
upon our online content. We will be providing more exclusive online stories, blogs, photos and multimedia for you to enjoy 
when there is no print edition for you to pick up on your way 
to class.
And although there will hopefully be less controversy from 
Student Government this semester, we will still be providing 
thorough and reliable coverage.
While there is no election (and hopefully no one shoving fli-
ers in your face on your way to class), it will be our responsibil-ity to keep you up-to-date on any major changes made during 
the summer session. Accountability was a major theme for the 
incoming administration, and we plan to hold them to it.
Finally, we ask you, our readers, to sound off on the news 
and commentary we bring you each week.
If you have an issue or want to respond to a news article or 
a column, feel free to submit a letter to the editor or a guest col-umn.
Letters to the editor are generally short (around 150 to 200 
words) and usually give an opinion about an upcoming event or 
respond to an article or a column in a previous issue.
Guest columns can be longer (around 500 to 600 words) and 
generally concern more complicated issues that have not neces-
sarily been covered.
They need to be well-written, with few grammatical errors, 
and clear. They should also provide links to your sources.
Both can be submitted as attachments to opinions@alligator.
org.
Please also provide your name, year, major and any organi-
zations to which you belong, if relevant.
We hope to keep you informed, and we also hope you see the 
Alligator as an outlet to voice your concerns.
Have a great semester!Welcome Back
Editorial Board wants 
to hear your voice
To quote Seth Meyers, “President Obama was finally 
outed as a Democrat.”
On May 9, Obama said in an interview with ABC 
News, “I’ve just concluded that for me, personally, it is im-
portant for me to go ahead and affirm that I think same-sex 
couples should be able to get married.”
This was after a few minutes of speculation of what the 
president’s interview would consist of on Twitter – in fact, the story broke a little early thanks to a news pal of mine, Matthew Keys (@ProducerMatthew).
He was scoping out news results for www.abcnews.
go.com when he discovered an empty page with the slug 
describing Obama’s stance.
Oops, I guess, but it made for an exciting afternoon.
Since then, media outlets have expressed their opinion/
spin/point of view of our president’s announcement.
Fox Nation’s scandalous headline read, at first, “Obama 
Flip Flops, Declares War On Marriage” before the site changed it to, “Obama Flip Flops On Gay Marriage.”
OK. I’m not entirely sure what’s true in any of those state-
ments, but I don’t think it’s much.
This week’s cover of “Newsweek” calls Obama “The 
First Gay President.”
But, like, really? Is he really the first gay president? No, 
of course not.
Is he the first president to be clear and outspoken about 
his feelings on gay marriage? Yes, and that’s truly a huge step forward.
I’m still not sure, though, if politicians should be praised 
for not basing their decisions on what a religious text dic-tates. Tolerance (a.k.a. being patient with people because they are different from you) is not something that should be celebrated; instead, speaking out in favor of basic human rights should be.
I feel like the media have one level of reaction: knee-jerk.We’re trained to be the first, the fairest and the most ac-
curate. But when sensational and breaking news goes down, 
it’s like all bets are off in the world of journalism.Magazines, and newspapers to 
an extent, have to sell units. I un-
derstand that. This just seems like such an important and touchy 
subject that I don’t know how 
appropriate it is to capitalize on a pivotal moment in American history.
We’re living in a crazy time, 
folks, where it’s controversial for 
a woman to choose whether or not to wear makeup. (For the record, I’m on Hillary’s side: pro-choice.)
Because heaven forbid women are walking around this 
planet without makeup. Oh, no. Oh, dear. How will we ever survive this monstrosity? How will we bear to go on?
Spare me.Presidential election years are hard on everybody. It cer-
tainly seems like one false move can cost a campaign ev-erything it has worked so hard to gain. It is incredibly ir-
responsible for the media to put any sort of additional or 
unnecessary flavor on an already tough situation.
So go out and get those page views, media outlets. Ask 
those polls and pin those pictures. Start engaging with your audience by being as radical as possible and see how much of it sticks.
I always thought being pretty moderate gathered all 
kinds of fans, but maybe spending time screaming extremes is the way to go.
I’m never one to judge; if you like terrible bands then you 
like terrible bands. There’s not much I can do to fix that or to change your mind.
If you like someone of the same sex or don’t feel like 
wearing foundation today, there’s not much I can do about that either.

They have both said the same exact words repeatedly (“I 
will not be VP”) — sometimes casually, sometimes force-fully. But Sen. Marco Rubio and Gov. Susana Martinez 
both realize they would be an ideal counterweight to Romney.
As we all know, talk is cheap in the world of politics, and the 
weight of the upcoming election may be just enough to sway the mind of one of these Republican Party hopefuls. Why? Be-cause the future of the Republican Party remains heavily at the whim of the Hispanic demographic.
Somehow, I can’t see Romney chanting “Sí, se puede” to 
crowds of Latino voters, even if he enjoys a chalupa from Taco Bell every now and then on the campaign trail.
The media know it and have been buzzing about these two 
candidates for the past few months, probably hoping someone 
will soon dig up trash on them.
Latino candidates can relate to the minority demographic 
in a way that non-Latino candidates cannot. These two would 
surely give Barack Obama a run for his money (and trust me, the man has a lot of money). It’s not just about ethnicity; it’s about identity . From their backgrounds to their politics, these potentials identify with the Hispanic demographic.
Let’s start out with Rubio. Rubio is a Tea Party champion 
who has always stood behind his small-government principles, and yet has not alienated any of his Hispanic constituents. Why? Because his stance on illegal immigration seems rational to just about everyone on the political spectrum.
While Rubio shot down the DREAM Act in its original 
form, he showed a willingness to solve this issue with his own version of the DREAM Act in April. In his compromise, young illegal immigrants who graduated from high school without a criminal record and are college-bound or have military aspi-rations would be granted non-immigration visas. With these visas, they’d be able to begin the process of citizenship.
Rubio knows the value of a dollar and as the son of Cu-
ban immigrants believes in an American dream uncorrupted 
by liberal myths. As he said, “Those of us of Hispanic descent 
don’t expect special treatment … only the same treatment and same opportunities afforded to all Americans.” 
At the same time, Rubio is young, and he has more charm 
than Obama and Joe Biden put together. Like Martinez, he can communicate effectively with Spanish-speaking voters in their own tongue. This connection alone is more profound than most Hispanic voters are willing to admit.
Likewise, Susana Martinez would be able to appeal to a widespread conservative base, and at the same time, could garner the votes of her fellow Hispanics.
Like Rubio, she is a practicing Catholic, and her values are 
in line with the social conservatism of Latino voters. Also, Mar-tinez shares Rubio’s work ethic. She started out in her family’s 
small business, eventually becoming a prosecutor and district 
attorney. As governor of New Mexico, she believes in protect-ing our nation’s safety with secure borders. Politically speak-ing, she has not really done anything that could isolate her from her own ethnic group.
Both Rubio and Martinez would represent hope for Hispan-
ic voters. Whereas Congress’ agenda has typically been too ex-treme to gain the votes of Republicans (and Republican plans would produce a veto from Obama), Hispanic inﬂ  uence in the 
executive branch would get stuff done for them.
Obama really has done nothing to change our ﬂ  awed ille-
gal immigration policy. And he stood behind a DREAM Act he 
knew would never pass.
The best hope for Hispanics lies in the GOP ticket. And 
with the incentive of a huge demographic advantage, Romney would be foolish to pass over a Hispanic Veep prospect.

Poly San Luis Obispo.Romney would be foolish not to choose Latino vice presidentUWire
One of the most-covered news events of this semester was the killing of  17-year-old African-American teen-
ager Trayvon Martin by 28-year-old George Zimmerman. Though it has not been proven 
that Zimmerman’s actions were racially moti-
vated, the case garnered national attention and prompted a public discussion on the shape racism takes in the United States today.
This case was particularly interesting to me 
in light of a play I was reading for one of my classes. The play , “Blues for Mister Charlie,” by James Baldwin, is a ﬁ  ctional retelling of the murder of Emmett Till, an African-American teenager from Chicago who was murdered in Mississippi in 1955 for allegedly ﬂ  irting with a white woman.
Till’s murder caused national outrage 
much like the murder of Martin, and both 
events brought the nation into a discussion of 
racism in the United States.
As part of this dialogue, the author Touré 
wrote an article in Time Magazine titled “How to talk to young black boys about Trayvon Martin: Talking points about the potentially fatal condition of being black.” The article gives African-American boys a small guide-book for navigating a social climate in which they are often looked at as threatening.
The article is dis-
heartening to read, especially if you have 
lived under the assumption that “real” racism is a thing of the past. I have treated cases like the Till case as gruesome relics of a bygone era, something that doesn’t happen in a time when we have an African-American ﬁ  rst family.
Nothing disturbs me more than realizing 
that remnants of our racist past still exist and affect American citizens’ lives. One only needs to look at prison and poverty statistics to real-ize there are very deep racist structures in the United States that have not been resolved.
Whether or not the Martin case was racially 
motivated, it has caused Americans (includ-ing myself) to reﬂ  ect on the very real ways in 
which minorities encounter racism every day.
This realization of the realities of racism 
still present in the United States should be a 
catalyst for all Americans to continue looking for solutions to problems facing our minority communities and a call for compassion in ad-dressing those communities.

Daily at the University of Oklahoma.

Many people may associate the 
word ‘viral’ with sickness, but for 
UF alumnus Cameron Magruder, it means money and glory.
Magruder, better known to 
his fans as Scooter Magruder, is making a name for himself on the Internet. YouTube announced May 8 it would sponsor and train Magruder and 16 others as part of an ongoing effort to generate more content.
“I love making people laugh,” 
the 23-year-old telecommunica-
tion production graduate said. 
“One million subscribers is the goal.”
His videos have already been 
well-received. Known for their humor and spot-on impressions, his weekly videos cover many topics but focus mainly on sports.
One of his most popular vid-
eos, Stuff Gator Fans Say, has been featured on Buzzfeed and is full of playful jabs, especially regarding Florida State University. He asks, “If two FSU grads get a divorce, are they still cousins?”
Combined, Magruder’s videos 
have a total of 1.7 million views, but that’s just a drop in the bucket 
for him.
“I don’t think that’s a lot; it’s 
not a lot to me,” he said. “I have a 
lot of work to do still.”
The YouTube program he was 
selected for, called Next Creator, launches a series of contests al-most monthly to find new Internet stars. Each contest is searching for 
a different type of talent – from 
cooking to relationship advice.
Magruder was selected as a 
vlogger, or video blogger.
He’s focusing his channel more 
on sports now and plans to start a weekly sports show starting next Sunday. He described it as “Tosh.0, but just sports and much 
shorter.”
Magruder isn’t the only Gator 
to achieve YouTube fame.
Toby Turner, who also gradu-
ated with a degree in telecommu-nication production, has 658,121 
subscribers to his channel and more than 150 million video views. He even moved out to California to make his videos as a full-time job.
Even more popular is Glo-
Zell, a musical theater graduate who has almost 200 million video views and has plans to host her 
own television show.Magruder hopes to join these 
other Gator YouTube sensations 
and hopes that UF and the world are ready for his big break.
“Prepare for greatness,” he 
said with a laugh, “because I have so many great videos just waiting to be shot. I’m about to go into full-time beast mode.”

� THEY WERE ARRESTED 
IN OCTOBER.
SHELBY WEBB
Alligator Staff Writer
Pat Fitzpatrick said he 
couldn’t believe the irony that 
unfolded when he was arrested while protesting next to a First Amendment monument last 
October.
Fitzpatrick and a handful of 
other Occupy Gainesville pro-
testers were arrested for tres-passing on Bo Diddley Com-munity Plaza.
Now, Fitzpatrick and at least 
20 other protesters are fighting to have their trespassing cases 
thrown out.
He said he shouldn’t have 
been arrested because the plaza 
is a public space, which means it should be open to everyone.
“We were definitely arrest-
ed for the content of our speech and trying to assemble,” Fitz-patrick said. “It’s really sad.”
Fitzpatrick said he protested 
on Oct. 14 to voice his concerns that the city is bowing to down-town developers who want to force the homeless out of Bo Diddley Community Plaza.
Attorney Geoffrey Mason, 
a partner with Schackow, Mer -
cadante & Edwards, was also at the protest.
He said the National Law-
yers Guild, a nonprofit orga-nization that provides legal services for First Amendment issues, among other projects, 
asked him to supervise the pro-
test. He didn’t expect any prob-lems – until he saw the hand-cuffs come out.“When I saw the people get-
ting arrested, I was very sur -
prised,” Mason said.
Although a city ordinance 
states that Bo Diddley Commu-nity Plaza is closed from 11:30 
p.m. to 6:30 a.m., Mason said 
the court must evaluate how the statute affected freedom of speech.
“There was no crime hap-
pening besides them participat-ing in the core political speech,” Mason said.
He said the cases against his 
clients and Fitzpatrick would require the city to cite a com-pelling government interest for arresting the protesters, like safety or sanitation. Otherwise, it could be an infringement on the group’s freedom of speech.
Mason is now representing 
21 Occupy members for free 
and filed a motion to dismiss 
their trespassing charges in late April.
In the motion, Mason said 
the city ordinance was “se-lectively enforced against the defendant(s) in an arbitrary and unreasonable manner.” He went on to say the way the law 
was applied placed “an uncon-
stitutional restriction on the de-fendant’s rights to free speech and assembly.”
Mason decided to join Oc-
cupy Gainesville after witness-ing the arrests and said he was disappointed in how the police handled the situation.
“I thought Gainesville was 
more willing to embrace dif-ferent views,” Mason said. “I didn’t anticipate people would be arrested.”

� FLORIDA FACES SAMFORD 
ON THE ROAD AT 7:30 P.M.
  JOE MORGAN
 Alligator Staff Writer
   
 Mike Zunino’s solo home run 
against Mississippi State in the 
eighth inning on Sunday was 
more than just another game-
winning hit for Florida. It pro-vided a sense of relief.
  The Gators pitching staff held 
the Bulldogs in check, giving Florida the luxury of needing only two runs for a victory. How-ever, UF has lacked consistent of-fensive production since April.
  “We haven’t swung the bat 
how we’ve wanted to, but it’s just a work in progress,” Zunino said. “We’re battling every game, try-
ing to get it turned around.”
  During the season’s ﬁ  rst two 
months, the Gators hit at a .294 
clip and 
a v e r a g e d 
6.9 runs per 
game en 
route to a 24-3 record. In April, Florida batted .271 and averaged 
ﬁ  ve runs per contest while split-
ting 18 games.
  May has not been much better. 
UF is 5-2 in its ﬁ  rst seven games of the month, but the offense has 
only scored 21 runs, including a 
paltry six in last weekend’s series win against MSU.
The Gators are batting .244 
in May, and Florida stranded 24 combined runners in back-to-back games against Kentucky and North Florida.
  “There’s nothing you can say 
or do other than encourage, keep 
Gators struggling to manufacture runs
  JONATHAN CZUPRYN
 Alligator Writer
   
 Despite an embarrassing 
loss in the Southeastern Con-
ference Championship game 
on Saturday, the Gators kept 
a couple impressive streaks alive the next day.
  On Sunday night, No. 7 
Florida (46-11) earned the No. 5 national seed for the NCAA Tournament to make it ﬁ  ve straight years as a top-ﬁ  ve seed and 10 straight years as 
a NCAA Regional host.
  UF struggled down the 
stretch of the regular sea-
son, losing ﬁ  ve of their last 
seven. But wins against LSU 
and Tennessee propelled Florida into the champion-ship game of the SEC Tourna-ment against Alabama. And 
even being run ruled by the 
Tide wasn’t enough to keep the Gators out of a primetime spot in the tournament.
  When their seed was an-
nounced at 10 Sunday night, Lauren Haeger and the rest of her team cheered and ap-plauded. The three-time SEC 
Freshman of the Week was so 
excited she and fellow fresh-man Sami Fagan jumped up and chest-bumped after ﬁ  nd-
ing out their fate.  “I wasn’t expecting ﬁ  ve 
seed,” Haeger said. “We all 
were ready to have a lower seed than that and I’m really happy that it went in our fa-vor. I’m excited; I’m ready to 
get this show going.”
  The Gainesville Regional 
features an all-Sunshine State 
lineup with Florida Gulf 
Coast (37-22), Central Flori-
da (39-17) and South Florida (45-11). Florida has played 
each of these schools at 
least once 
earlier this season with a combined 
2-2 record.
  Chey-
enne Coyle 
said she’s more comfortable 
facing familiar foes.
  “Playing Florida teams 
in our regional, of course, they are really coming hard this year,” Coyle said. “It’s 
nice playing teams we’ve al-
ready played because we see what they have ... so I think I’d rather play a team we’ve already played before rather 
than a random team.”

FIRE JOE MORGAN
  When Florida won its second con-
secutive men’s basketball na-tional title in 2007, the Gators 
were riding high.
  The alligatorSports crew likes to think 
that we put together two quality, cham-pionship-caliber semesters during the 
2011-12 school year and that we, too, are 
untouchable. Enter reality check.
  After dominating the college basket-
ball world for two seasons, the Gators lost the group that made it all possible — the Oh-Fours. Team alligatorSports has also witnessed the departure of four great con-tributors that simply cannot be replaced.
  Leading off, we lost our own “Drunken 
Dribbler” (Corey Brewer) in Bryan Holt. Much like Brewer harassed his opponents defensively, Holt covered his beat like 
a shadow. Forever doomed to be a role 
player, Holt, like Brewer, is a great piece of the ﬁ  rst-round playoff exit puzzle that the Denver Nuggets have seemed to master.
  Next up we said goodbye to a gamer in Taurean Green, which just so hap-pens to be Tom 
Green. Like Tau-
rean with the UF offense, Tom ran the show during 
the fall. Also, they 
have the same last 
name. Taurean is off playing for Tofas Bursa, a professional squad in Turkey, and Tom is in Miami covering the Marlins. You haven’t attended a game for either team.
  Moving into the frontcourt brings us 
to our Al Horford doppelganger: John 
Boothe. Both Horford and Boothe play 
things cool and quietly turn in great ef-forts night in and night out. Like Horford, Boothe is a calming presence — the father 
ﬁ  gure. However, there is one difference 
between them. If the Hawks had Boothe on the line in Game 7 against the Celtics, the 76ers would have played last night’s

working at it,” coach Kevin O’Sullivan said.
“At some point, we have talent, it’s going to turn 
around. It is what it is.”
The offense has sputtered largely because of slump-
ing at the top of the order. Leadoff hitter Nolan Fon-
tana is hitting .154 in May with three runs scored com-pared to four strikeouts. Preston Tucker and Zunino, 
have not fared much better, each batting .231.
Zunino has had some clutch hits recently, contrib-
uting a walkoff RBI double against North Florida and 
the go-ahead run on his solo homer Sunday. However, 
Tucker has just one hit and one RBI in his last 15 at-
bats.
“We won two out of three against a very good Mis-
sissippi State team … without our best guys swinging the bat as well as we all know they’re going to at some 
point,” O’Sullivan said. “That’s what I’m looking at 
moving forward.”
The Gators bullpen has helped keep the team afloat 
despite closer Austin Maddox missing six games with tendinitis. Florida’s relievers have posted a 0.98 WHIP and a 0.29 ERA in 30.2 innings with a 3.1-to-1 strike-out-to-walk ratio.
Steven Rodriguez took on an increased workload in 
Maddox’s absence, earning three saves while serving 
as the closer. In UF’s last seven games, Rodriguez has 
logged 11 scoreless frames in relief.
“Not much fazes [the bullpen],” 
Zunino said. “They’re just (as tough as) nails. Every time we go to them, 
they step up.”
Florida (38-14) will look to get its 
pitchers some help at the plate on the road against Samford (33-19) tonight 
at 7:30.
The Gators defeated the Bulldogs 5-3 in Gainesville, 
on March 20, recording 11 hits and stranding seven on 
base.
“Hitting’s contagious,” Zunino said. “So, once one 
guy starts getting hot, hopefully everyone can heat up and then we can go from there.”

throw at the SEC Outdoor Championships with a throw measuring 77.87m/255-6.

Alligator Staff Writer
 
Although the Gators didn’t win 
the Southeastern Conference Outdoor 
Championships, they didn’t leave 
Baton Rouge, La., empty handed. Be-
tween the men and women, Florida claimed a dozen individual titles throughout the weekend. 
Distance runner Genevieve LaCaze 
had the most impressive weekend of the group. Her three wins in the 3,000 meter steeple chase, 1,500 meters and 5,000 meters made her the highest 
point-scorer at the meet, which lead to 
her winning the SEC Commissioner’s Trophy. 
“I’m extremely proud of Gen and 
everything she’s done this weekend,” coach Mike Holloway said. “It’s the 
first time anyone has ever been able to win those three events and I doubt it’ll ever happen again. To be able to watch 
her make history, that’s special.”
In addition to LaCaze winning three 
titles, she also set a personal record in 
the 1,500 meters with a time of 4:13.44. 
That event gave the women 21 points 
thanks to the performances of LaCaze, Cory McGee, Agata Strausa and Man-dy Perkins, making it the highest scor -
ing event for Florida.
“Turning up today in the 1,500 and 
having so many girls in the race, it helped having Cory take the lead with 600 meters to go,” LaCaze said. “I can’t 
even explain the last lap. I crossed the 
finish line and I wasn’t really sure it was real. That set up a great rest of the day.”
Like LaCaze, junior Tony McQuay 
also had a strong performance at the SEC Outdoor Championships. Mc-Quay grabbed two titles on Sunday, one in the 400 meters and the other in 
the 4x400 meter relay. This was Mc-
Quay’s second SEC Outdoor title in the 4x400 meter relay and his first in the 400 meters.
The rest of the Gators who won 
individual titles this past weekend include Ciarra Brewer (triple jump), Dwight Barbiasz (high jump), Brittany Harrell (heptathlon), Taylor Burke 
(high jump), Jeremy Postin (hammer 
throw), Omar Craddock (triple jump), Dedric Dukes, Hugh Graham and Leonardo Seymore (4x400 meter relay) 
and Stipe Zunic (javelin throw), who 
extended his winning streak Sunday with a throw of 77.87m/255-6.
 He remains undefeated this out-
door season.
“When I got my PR a few weeks 
ago, (the throw) didn’t have much power but it had a ton of flight,” Zu-nic said. “Today, my final throw had 
a ton of power and not a lot of flight. 
It made me realize that I have the power to throw 80 meters if I can get both power and flight. I think I’ll be ready for NCAAs and see what I can 
do there.”
Despite the high number of titles, 
Florida’s men and women finished 
fourth and second, respectively. They had 16 athletes who competed yet did not score any points for the team.
As the Gators move forward to the 
NCAA East Preliminary Round start-ing May 24, they will need to focus on those who didn’t score so they can im-
prove their chance of bringing home 
a team title in addition to individual titles.

Rounding out the quartet is kingpin Matt Watts, the 
poor man’s Joakim Noah. Like Noah, Watts has a whole 
mess of facial hair and you will never find him vacation-
ing in Cleveland. Both have been known to forgo wear -
ing a seat belt while riding around town, but only Noah has been caught by law enforcement.
Lastly we have Greg Luca, our own version of coach 
Billy Donovan. Tempted by the lure of professional sports, Luca has abandoned us to cover the Orioles for the summer. However, once Baltimore is eliminated from playoff contention in early June, he’ll be pining for 
a return to the cozy alligatorSports office. And we will 
welcome him back with open arms.
For now, those of us still working in Gainesville want 
to put out the best section we can for you, the readers. 
Don’t worry, we are much better equipped to handle the 
loss of key players than the 2007-08 UF squad.
In other words,  we will not dip down to NIT quality. 
But like those Gators, we need our fans and we need 
our critics.

College World Series begins Friday at 
6 p.m. against FGCU, who the Gators defeated 5-0 on Feb. 12. In the regional 
round of the tournament, Florida is 16-4 
under Walton, including a 12-2 record the past three seasons. 
Walton said his team being awarded 
such a high seed in the tournament was a testament to its body of work throughout the regular season. Although the Gators hit a rough patch down the homestretch, 
they were able to convince the NCAA 
with nine top-25 victories and their fifth straight season with at least 20 wins against SEC opponents.
“I can’t wait,” Haeger said. “It’s 
like something you see all the time and you’re finally here and what you did all season is finally paying off. It’s going to be a fight. It’s going to see who has the 
most fight and heart in the end.”16, ALLIGATOR � TUESDAY, MAY 15, 2012

The Gators’ first-round game in the NCAA Tourna-
ment did not go as planned, but they achieved the desired 
result.
No. 1 seed Florida (18-2) is on its way to the NCAA 
Quarterfinals after defeating Albany (12-6) and extending its winning streak to 14 games with a 6-4 win on Satur -
day.
“They were scrappy,” coach Amanda O’Leary said. 
“Our defense did a great job of containing their attack-ers, but I also think Albany did a fantastic job of show-sliding, double teaming, collapsing into the middle and taking away some really critical opportunities that we are 
normally able to execute on.”  The Great Danes proved to be a challenge as they held 
the Gators to a season-low 12 shots on goal — 18 fewer 
than their season average and three short of their goals per game average.
O’Leary said that not everything went 
as planned, but the team exhibited deter -
mination.
“I’m really proud of our kids as well,” 
O’Leary said. “I think they came out and they competed. I don’t think everything 
went as we had scripted, but still com-peted hard, played hard and came out with a win.”
The Gators gained a quick advantage with a 4-0 lead in 
the first half keeping the Great Danes at bay and holding a lead the entire game.One player that stood out for Florida on Saturday was 
Shannon Gilroy. The freshman followed her performance against Northwestern with five draw controls and two goals, sporting another competitive outing in the mid-field.
Gilroy said that winning draw controls are crucial and 
help motivate the team.
“It’s definitely a big confidence booster,” Gilroy said. 
“…we get the draw, we get to have the possession, we could have a chance to score and keep the ball out of the 
attackers on the other end of the field.”
The Gators are now preparing to host the Penn State 
Nittany Lions (12-6) at Donald R. Dizney Stadium this 
Saturday in the second round of the NCAA Tournament. 
Florida will be looking to defeat the Nittany Lions for a 
chance at its first-ever Final Four appearance.UF overcomes offensive woes to advance in NCAA Tournament
