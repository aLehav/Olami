STUDENT GOVERNMENT
SAMANTHA SHAVELL
Alligator Staff Writer
The Student Senate passed a bill at Tuesday 
night’s meeting to limit when candidates and 
political parties can campaign for Student Gov-ernment elections. It also redeﬁ  ned campaign-ing.
The bill passed 39 to 12. It needs to be ap-
proved by the Senate for a second time to be enacted.
The revisions proposed campaigning start 
one week before elections and end when the polls close.
“Campaigning” would be redeﬁ  ned to en-
compass election-speciﬁ  c material that solicits support for a candidate or party.
However, the revisions also added “cam-
paign activity” to the codes, which is inten-tional action or support of a party or candidate that does not solicit votes. Campaign activity would start four weeks before the election and end when the polls close.
The revisions also added Internet posts as 
an example of campaign material.
“You have to make it accountable to a party,” 
said Judiciary Committee Chairman Cayman Weimer after the meeting. Weimer presented the bill and was one of the authors.
Before the senators debated the bill, Weimer 
read an email from UF’s General Counsel ex-plaining that the bill does not seem to violate state or federal law.
Sen. Lauren Verno, one of the bill’s authors, 
said it would bring more bipartisanship by allowing senators to focus on the Senate as a whole instead of campaigning.
“We represent over 50,000 students as a 
chamber,” she said. “This is helping the biparti-sanship of Student Government.”
Senate President Pro Tempore Logan Har-
rison, another author, said his job encourages unbiased decisions, and this bill would allow him to remain impartial instead of campaign-ing for his particular party.
However, Sen. Max Stein said the revisions 
are detrimental to free speech.
Sen. Matt Pesek echoed Stein’s sentiments. 
He said whoever has the free time to campaign should have the liberty to do so.
“If we have more than 
one week [to campaign], we wouldn’t have to have armies of people harassing people at Turlington,” he said.
During the meeting, the 
Senate also approved Robert Andrade, Daniel DiMatteo, Michael Hacker, Brett Halperin and Cole Sullivan as new Supreme Court Justices.
DiMatteo sparked debate because he knew 
about hazing that resulted with his fraternity, Pi Kappa Phi, being kicked off campus four years ago. He held several leadership positions in the fraternity, according to his resume.
DiMatteo phoned in during the Senate meet-
ing and said he knew hazing had occurred and followed appropriate channels by reporting it to the fraternity administration.

In increasingly dry North Central 
Florida, lakes are drying and springs 
are predicted to stop ﬂ  owing. The land is becoming more brittle by the week.
Some visible symptoms of the arid 
conditions are the muddy banks and low water levels in bodies of water frequented by fun seekers during the summer months.
The Florida Park Service warned 
on the Ichetucknee River website that “due to extreme drought conditions and historic low water levels in the Ichetucknee River,” there is “potential for occasional temporary recreational tubing closures this summer at the park’s North entrance.”

If the mission is successful, SpaceX 
will be the ﬁ  rst private company to dock a commercial spacecraft at the space sta-tion, which means the government won’t be the only organization in space.
“We’re really at the dawn of a new 
era of space exploration and one where there’s a much bigger role for commer-cial companies,” Elon Musk, SpaceX CEO and PayPal co-founder, told reporters in a press conference Tuesday.

Wanted: Bigfoot hair samples for 
European study
LONDON (AP) — European 
researchers are planning to use 
new techniques to analyze DNA that could help crack the mys-tery of whether Bigfoot exists.
In a project announced this 
week, Oxford University and Cantonal Museum of Zoology scientists appealed to museums, scientists and yeti aficionados to share hair samples thought to be from the mythical, ape-like creature.
New genetic tests will be 
done on just a few strands of hair and should be completed within weeks. Even if the sam-ple is judged to come from an unknown species, scientists should be able to tell how close-ly it is related to other species, including apes or humans.
Bryan Sykes of Oxford Uni-
versity said the group had al-ready received many offers of samples to test, including blood, hair and items supposedly chewed by Bigfoot. Sykes and colleagues plan to sift through the samples for the next few months before deciding which specimens to test. They will then publish their results in a peer-reviewed journal.

Iowa man with zebra, parrot in 
truck gets DUI
DUBUQUE, Iowa (AP) — 
An Iowa man stopped outside 
a Dubuque bar with a small zebra and a parrot in his truck has been charged with drunken driving. 
KCRG-TV reports officers ar -
rested 56-year-old Jerald Reiter, of Cascade, Sunday in the park-ing lot of the Dog House bar, where people had been taking photos of the animals. Reiter says the zebra and macaw par -
rot are pets and like riding in the truck. 
Reiter claims he sometimes 
takes the animals into the bar, but the owner says they’re not allowed inside. Officers gave Reiter a field sobriety test and charged him with drunken driving. 
Reiter disputes the arrest. He 
says he was about to let a pas-senger, a person, begin driving. He says he thinks someone who came to see the animals called police.

City official consults Ouija board 
before vote
SAN FRANCISCO (AP) — A 
San Francisco supervisor says he 
consulted a Ouija board before city leaders voted on whether to recommend naming a Navy ship after slain gay rights activ-ist Harvey Milk. 
Supervisor John Avalos tells 
the San Francisco Chronicle that he believes he made contact with Milk’s spirit and that Milk spelled out letters indicating: “Good riddance to don’t ask, don’t tell.” 
The Board of Supervisors ap-
proved the non-binding reso-lution Tuesday on a 9-2 vote. Milk was a city supervisor and former naval officer. He was fa-tally shot in 1978 by Dan White. Supporters say the naming would honor the repeal of the “don’t ask, don’t tell” law bar -
ring open homosexuality in the military. 
Opponents say Milk op-
posed war and it would be in-appropriate to name a warship after him.
—THE ASSOCIATED PRESSadvances made in DNA test-ing could theoretically solve the Bigfoot question.
“If the yeti is real and 
somebody has found bits of their hair, you should be able to tell from the DNA in the hair if this is actually a yeti,” said Mark Thomas, a profes-sor of evolutionary genetics at University College London. He is not connected to the Big-foot project.
But Thomas was unsure 
how likely it was anyone might have actual yeti hairs. Some scientists theorize yetis are either a distinct hominid spe-cies or a mix between Homo sapiens and Neanderthals or other species. There is already evidence of interbreeding be-tween Homo sapiens and Ne-anderthals.
“If yetis have survived for 
the last 30,000 years, they have probably had a pretty miser -
able existence and are a small population vulnerable to ex-tinction,” Thomas said. “It’s not as insane an idea as many might think, but the chances are pretty small.”
Sykes said he has always 
been intrigued by stories of yeti sightings but would rely on science rather than such tales to prove if the stories are credible.
“It’s not really possible to 
fabricate DNA evidence,” he said.
He acknowledged that the 
chances of proving the exis-tence of a new yeti species are low but said that the study was still worthwhile.
“If we don’t look, we’ll 
never find out,” he said.
Bigfoot is a legendary gi-
ant, hairy, ape-like beast that is known as Sasquatch, the Abominable Snowman, Yeti and other names. It supposed-ly lives in heavily forested or snowy mountains. Although most scientists don’t believe in the beast’s existence, de-cades of eyewitness reports, suggestive photos and stories have kept the legend alive.
David Frayer, a professor 
of biological anthropology at Kansas University, told The Associated Press in an email that “No serious scientist (would) treat Yeti as a worthy research project.”
He said previous tests on 
supposed yeti hairs have al-ready been done — “and they turned out to be from a bi-son.”

con 9 and Falcon Heavy space boosters, 
which are used as launch vehicles to transport smaller spacecrafts, including SpaceX’s Dragon, to deliver supplies to the space station.
Tuesday’s liftoff marked SpaceX’s 
second attempt to launch the Dragon, equipped with Falcon 9 boosters, after aborting the mission Saturday.
The mission was pushed to 3:44 a.m. 
Tuesday to line up the space station’s orbit with the launchpad on Earth.
This time, all systems were cleared 
for takeoff, and in about 10 minutes, Dragon was in orbit.
Musk said he had concerns with the 
rockets after Saturday’s cancellation, but the launch proved otherwise.
“It was tremendous elation,” Musk 
said. “For us, it’s like winning the Super Bowl.”
The unmanned rocket transported 
Dragon into space, where it is expected to dock on the station Friday.
The spacecraft contains about 1,000 
pounds of supplies.
NASA said a section of the cargo con-
tains the ashes of about 300 people, in-cluding Leroy Gordon Cooper Jr., one of the original Project Mercury astronauts, and actor James Doohan, who played chief engineer Montgomery Scott from the “Star Trek” TV series.
Once the capsule docks, space station 
astronauts will spend the next week un-loading supplies from the capsule and filling it with cargo bound for Earth.
Dragon will then detach from the 
space station, return to Earth and land in the Pacific Ocean near the Southern California coast on May 31, according to the SpaceX website.
If successful, the company will begin 
a $1.6 billion contract with NASA flying 12 cargo missions to the space station.
However, if the mission fails, SpaceX 
will “learn from the experience and try again,” according to the company’s website.
David Hahn, chairman of UF’s me-
chanical and aerospace engineering de-partment, said in an email he believes the Dragon mission is a step forward for NASA.
However, he said he feels that money 
going into missions and vehicles should not take precedence over investments in creating jobs and expanding technol-ogy.
Brett Freidkes, a 19-year-old mechan-
ical engineering junior, said SpaceX’s mission could open doors to job op-portunities for college graduates in the future.
“It not only gives incoming employ-
ees experience, but it will be good for space travel overall,” he said. “I think this could lead to some very beneficial discoveries for humanity.”

Low water levels in rivers and springs are unsafe for swimmers
more closures,” said Chris Bird, 
Alachua County environmental director.
Bird said he’s been working 
with the environment in Alach-ua County for 22 years, and he’s never seen water levels this low, especially in the springs.
“We’re getting to the point 
as a community and as a state that we’re going to have to make tough decisions on how to allo-cate water use,” he said.
Poe Springs is at a record low 
water level, and Bird said the county estimated that the spring would stop flowing within the next two weeks, which would make it unsafe for swimmers.
Once a spring stops flowing, 
bacteria flourishes in the stagnant water.
“It’s like a public swimming 
pool with no chlorine,” Bird said. “The bacteria levels could spike, and swimmers could end up get-ting sick.”
Ginnie Springs isn’t in danger 
of having its flow stopped, most-ly because it draws water from a much larger area, Bird said.
The Santa Fe River has its own 
challenges. Its only source of water now comes from springs, which makes the water unusually clear. But clear water lets  more sunlight in, helping algae grow.
When algae blooms, Bird said, 
it turns the water green and uses a vast amount of the oxygen in the water. Without enough oxygen in the water, fish could die.
There are two main causes for 
the lack of wa-
ter, according to Bird: a statewide drought and overpumping of aquifers for resi-dential and agri-cultural use.
On average, 
each Floridian uses about 155 gal-lons of water each day, Bird said. About 50 percent of that water is used for watering yards.
Without enough rainfall to re-
plenish the water people use, lev-els have fallen unusually low.
“The amount of rainfall we 
need to return to normal levels would be several hurricanes,” Bird said, “which no one wants.”
The county and the health de-
partment are continually check-ing water quality, something UF associate professor Taylor Stein expected.
“Part of having any water open 
to recreation is that you have to monitor the water quality,” said Stein, who teaches ecotourism and is affiliated with the UF Wa-ter Institute. “It’s always an issue, even in good water times.”
Stein said another issue facing 
recreational bodies of water dur -
ing a drought is overcrowding.
A good way to make sure the 
spring or river has enough water to remain open to the public is to check their websites, Stein said.
Despite possible warnings, 
Stein said students may still flock to at least one of the springs, even if it is closed to swimmers.
“People go to Ginnie to party 
more often,” Stein said, laughing. “They might be just as happy sit-ting on the side drinking beer as they would be in the water.”

In this Dec. 20 file photo, Piers Morgan, host of CNN’s “Piers Morgan Tonight,” leaves the CNN building 
in Los Angeles. Television presenter Jeremy Paxman said Morgan showed him how to hack a phone. 
THE ASSOCIATED PRESS
LONDON (AP) — A prominent 
British TV presenter said Wednesday 
that CNN talk show host Piers Morgan gave him a primer on phone hacking, a revelation that suggests he knew a fair amount about how the shady practice was carried out.
BBC quiz show host and television 
news presenter Jeremy Paxman told a media ethics inquiry that Morgan de-livered his warning over lunch at the headquarters of the Mirror newspaper, which he was then editing, in 2002.
Paxman said that Morgan “turned 
to me and said, ‘Have you got a mobile phone?’”
“I said, ‘yes,’ and he asked if there 
was a security setting on the message bit of it. I didn’t know what he was talk-ing about.
“He then explained the way to get 
access to people’s messages was to go to the factory default setting and press ei-ther 0000 or 1234 and that if you didn’t put on your own code, (in) his words, ‘You’re a fool.’”Morgan’s apparent familiarity with 
how to bypass the factory default set-tings of a mobile phone appears at odds with what he’d told the same inquiry late last year. Quizzed repeatedly about statements he’d made suggesting that big chunks of the newspaper business were involved in phone hacking, Mor -
gan claimed he’d merely been repeat-ing gossip he picked off the industry’s rumor mill. The CNN star has repeated-ly denied having ever hacked a phone or knowingly run material obtained by phone hacking.
A spokeswoman for Morgan didn’t 
immediately return an email seeking comment, but Morgan took to Twitter to make light of the development.
“Right — that’s the last time I’m in-
viting Jeremy Paxman to lunch,” Mor -
gan wrote. “Ungrateful little wretch.”
Paxman and Morgan were both 
called to testify by Lord Justice Brian Leveson, who is sifting through the fallout of the phone-hacking scandal at the now-shuttered News of the World tabloid, which Morgan briefly edited before moving to the Mirror.Piers Morgan accused of 
passing on hacking skills

Results from Tuesday’s poll were unavailable due to 
technical errors.
Political correctness paralyzes the mind
Last week, my fellow columnist Michela Martinazzi 
wrote a piece denouncing the satirical ﬁ  lm “The Dictator,” which purportedly mocks Middle East-
ern despots, according to her, on the basis of racial ste-reotyping.
The general undertone of the piece was one of out-
rage at what Martinazzi considered libel on par with blackface in minstrel shows. While I do not wish to im-pugn her for her opinions, I would like to respectfully suggest a different point of view.
Political correctness is a paralyzing cancer on a free 
and conscientious society. It forces adherents to default to positions that often uphold wrong over right, evil over good and behaviors that lead to failure over those that lead to success. One might ask: How can this be?
Politically correct speech is merely an etiquette issue 
to avoid offending others, isn’t it? To which my response is an emphatic and enthusiastic “no!” It is a tool to en-force rigid homogeneity of thought, and it is not a recent phenomenon by any means.
The cardinal sin of political correctness is discrimina-
tion. According to this view, any assumption that one way may be better than another is necessarily discrimi-nate.
We’ve all probably seen ads for the “discriminating 
drinker” or for the “discriminating diner.” Why then must we condemn the discriminating thinker? “Because you might be a bigot if you don’t,” according to the po-litical correctness doctrinaires around us. It’s paralyz-ing.
To say that a ﬁ  lm is racist for mocking a political phe-
nomenon that, while certainly not peculiar to the Middle East, the Maghreb or North Africa, has certainly been the rule more often than the exception in that region over the years is preposterous. Chances are, Martinaz-zi’s objections are merely at making jokes at the expense of another culture’s political proclivities, rather than out of a genuine desire to stand up for “oppressed” dictators being bullied by the American ﬁ  lm in-dustry.
Nevertheless, her argument 
must stand or fall on the words she gave to us — that satirizing dictators and tyrants is an affront to an entire region’s culture, and 
is inherently racist.
This, in my mind at least, is a clear-cut example of 
political correctness inspiring an earnest young woman to publicly make the case before her peers that petty tyrants who oppress their people and their neighbors, many of whom have tortured and murdered millions of people throughout history, are no better or worse than any other culture’s way of life. They’re merely different and undeserving of our criticism. After all, that would be discriminating. The inference is chilling.
My wish here is not to massacre the work of one of my 
fellow writers, but to make the case that those interested in true justice and not merely ﬁ  erce neutrality must free their minds from the shackles of political correctness.
It is the only way to love the good and to resist the 
evil in this world. For all the voiceless victims who have fallen before tyrants such as Pol Pot, Kim Jong Il, Sadd-am Hussein, Ayatollah Khomeini and others of their ilk, the very least we can do as free people is to mock them mercilessly.
Monsters deserve every ounce of spite we can mus-
ter, since their victims often aren’t able to protest their own condition. Resist the calls to engage in moral equiv-alence arguments. Do it for them. Do it for yourself.

If the U.S. Congress “shall make no law,” neither should SG.Next up, because the election code revisions passed Tuesday 
night, we throw a congratulations-you-just-voted-to-restrict-the-free-speech-of-your-own-peers DART at the 39 senators who 
voted in favor of the revisions.
The Unite Party members should really be ashamed of them-
selves for approving this terrible piece of legislation. It appears that they are really doing all that they can to maintain their hold on SG while preventing as many alternative voices as possible from obtaining positions.
The university should be a place where free speech and an 
open exchange of ideas are welcome, not limited — especially by its own students.
For some more positive news, we give a turning-a-negative-
into-a-positive LAUREL to Jennifer Smith. Smith was formerly 
homeless, but she recently became the women’s director for the House of Hope, an Alachua County organization that provides services to those recently released from jail.
Who better to help those in need than someone who has had 
ﬁ  rsthand experience with recovery?
Keep up the good work.Finally, we want to give a the-more-the-merrier LAUREL to 
former secretary of state Colin Powell for saying that he sup-
ports same-sex marriage.
Although Powell is a moderate Republican, the more public 
ofﬁ  cials who openly support same-sex marriage from each side of the aisle, the more we can hope that the country will eventu-ally move in the right direction.
Have a fun and safe weekend, and be sure to check back next 
week.

While other kids were playing 
basketball in their driveways and 
chalking up the road to play hop-scotch, Corey Nickels was riding up and down the street with a trash grabber and a kitchen garbage can mounted on the back of his bicycle.
Nickels, an 18-year-old electri-
cal engineering sophomore, spent his childhood repairing and donat-ing his neighbors’ bikes, stereos and microwaves left at the curb for trash pickup.
“I’ve taken so much stuff apart 
that I know how it works without actually knowing how it works,” he said.
Nickels cares about the environ-
ment and uses his skills to reduce others’ carbon footprint. During the spring, he was one of two Inter-Res-idence Hall Association Eco-Repre-sentatives for the Honors Residen-tial College at Hume Hall.
He helped brainstorm ideas to 
reduce the environmental impact of each dorm.
“It’s fun because from the ﬁ  rst 
meeting, I realized there are other people at this school that really care about this,” Nickels said.
That wasn’t the ﬁ  rst time he 
shared his passion with others.
In 2009, the Palm Harbor native 
inspired his neighbor, the Rev . Gene Watson, to expand a toy donation organization to include repairing and donating old bicycles.
Together, Nickels and Watson, 72, created the Toymakers of East Lake Bicycle Ministry. In 2010, the minis-try ﬁ  xed and donated more than 300 bikes in Tampa Bay, some of which were sent to Haiti after the January earthquake.
“It was Corey and myself,” Wat-
son said. “I started in my garage at the same time Corey was picking up bikes at the side of the road.”Watson said there are often too 
many bikes and not enough volun-teers to repair them, especially after Nickels left for college.
“Corey is a very resourceful per-
son,” Watson said. “He did a lot of things that could be recycled and among them there were bicycles.”
His environmental interests were 
not limited to bicycles. As a freshman in high school, 
Nickels began attending Pasco County School Board’s Energy Management Committee meetings to ﬁ  nd out how his school was con-serving energy.
“They aim for the big stuff like 
the AC systems,” Nickels said. “I was looking for small things I could do that would add up.”He crunched the numbers from 
his school’s power usage data and estimated that if four light bulbs were removed from every classroom and all of the TVs were unplugged when school wasn’t in session, his school district could save $100,000 each year.
Nickels said he didn’t know what 
happened to his idea. The school board never hired anyone to analyze the light in his classrooms to see if removing bulbs was allowed under the board’s code.
But he doesn’t let that bother 
him. Nickels continues to help the environment while in college by re-pairing items his friends would oth-erwise throw away and replace.
“I think he’s the epitome of engi-
neers, that when he sees a problem, he wants to ﬁ  x it,” said Nickels’s Spring semester ﬂ  oormate, 18-year-old chemical engineering sopho-more Eli Carter.
The students who lived on his 
ﬂ  oor in Hume Hall knew Nickels as the go-to guy when something wasn’t working. Carter said every-one on his ﬂ  oor was appreciative of what Nickels did for them.
“If I explain to him a problem, he 
explains what it might be,” Carter said.
Nickels said in the future he 
wants to use his ability to repair things to create a new kind of elec-tric vehicle and other inventions that protect the environment.
“I’m looking forward to learning 
how electronics work so I can work on building my own stuff,” he said.8, ALLIGATOR � THURSDAY, MAY 24, 2012

The Gator Nation will be expanding its 
presence to the land of ﬁ  re and ice this sum-
mer.
UF’s Travel and Recreation Program, 
known as TRiP , is leading a summer excur-sion to Iceland. Registration begins at noon today in The Outﬁ  tter at the Reitz Union.
TRiP , a group of students who lead out-
door trips, is opening registration to any-one interested, not just students, said Jackie Matthews, program coordinator for UF’s Department of Student Activities and In-volvement.
The trip, which runs July 27 to August 6, 
includes a few days to explore the capital of Iceland as well as six days of backpacking.
“Once you leave the U.S. with every-
thing you’ve got on your back, that’s what you’re going to be carrying around Iceland as well,” Matthews said.  
The trip costs $600, excluding airfare.Iceland was chosen because English is 
widely spoken there, and it is safe, said Mero Geesey, a Spring 2012 biology gradu-ate and acting leader for the trip.
This is TRiP’s ﬁ  rst international trip in 
more than ﬁ  ve years and its ﬁ  rst trip to Ice-land, Matthews said.

Gainesville can call 352-294-7498.Registration for TRiP’s Iceland summer excursion starts today

Hyde & Zeke owner Charles Scales says he is not phased by the digital revolution 
because he is retired and has low overhead. “I’m here now, aren’t I?” he added.

For some, it’s a simple click of a button. You 
hover the arrow over “buy,” click and music 
is immediately downloaded to your computer and transferred to your iPod where you can hear it instantaneously.
Others enjoy the experience of sorting 
through brightly colored album covers, feeling excitement as they find an album that triggers a smile, holding the disc in their hands and listen-ing to the crackle as they lay the needle down on the smooth spinning surface.
Digital consumerism paired with the onset 
of MP3s has changed the face of the music in-dustry. Amazon, iTunes and other media hubs make it convenient and cheap to purchase mu-sic. Pirating networks make it possible to access music without even having to pay.
While downloading music has forced 
many international record stores to close, three Gainesville vinyl hubs have not only survived, but prospered. Hear Again Music and Movies, Hyde & Zeke Records and Wayward Council provide vinyl LPs, other media and merchan-dise for Gainesville residents looking to expand their collections.“I think there’s a certain amount of people 
who want to hear higher quality music,” Hear Again Music and Movies owner Andrew Schaer said.
Music experts agree that vinyl records have a 
higher sound quality than tapes, CDs and MP3s. This is due to the conversion from analog to digital. Digital recordings work by taking snap-shots of sound from an analog signal. Because of these snapshots, not all of the soundwave is captured, and certain sounds can be lost.
“If something is recorded in analog, you 
want to play it back in analog,” Schaer said. “People should hear things the way they were meant to be heard.”
Schaer and Hyde & Zeke Records owner 
Charles Scales agree that vinyl is the top seller and hasn’t given any sign of slowing down.
“Vinyl outsells everything 12 to one,” Schaer 
said.
Schaer said people who solely purchase on-
line music miss out of the education you get out of physically being in a music store.
“You come in here, and you see old and new 
— it’s a shopping and learning experience, and that’s what people appreciate,” he added.In midst of the Digital Revolution, three stores hold steady

Gainesville is the perfect place to become 
an artist, with its cultural influence and con-
nection to nature. This is exactly why Tom Hart, 42, of New York City, decided to move to Gainesville to open the Sequential Artists Workshop, a school, studio and library that serves to foster the creation and apprecia-tion of comics.
“It’s a great place to be an artist,” Hart 
said.
Hart, who taught comics at the New 
York City School of Visual Arts for 10 years, moved to Gainesville last September and opened the doors of SAW in January.
The studio offers classes taught by a sea-
soned faculty ranging from introductory comics to finishing techniques.
Hart’s wife, Leela Corman, 39, a gradu-
ate of Massachusetts College of Art and De-sign, is part of the faculty. Corman recently returned from a tour promoting her graphic novel, “Unterzakhn.”
“I did most of it in New York City, but 
I wrote most of it in Gainesville,” Corman said. “I found it so much easier to work here. It’s a really interesting pocket of culture and creativity.”
Corman will be teaching a figure draw-
ing class in a yearlong program the studio is offering in the fall. It will be a lo-fi version of a graduate program offering history, graphic novel reading, drawing and writing-specific classes, Hart said. He will also be teaching in the program.
“The class I teach is mostly coming up 
with ideas and figuring out how to adapt those ideas in sequential art, in comic form,” she said.
Hart’s love for comics began with the dis-
covery of the Peanuts comic strips when he was 7.
“For years, and I mean like decades, I 
copied Peanuts,” Hart said.
The name Sequential Artists Workshop 
was inspired by the Actors Studio in New York City, which is very focused on the stu-dent, Hart said.
“Who you are right now is what you have 
to work with and we’ll develop that,” Hart said. “It’s not to teach you how to do things our way, it’s to help you find the resources to do things your way.”
Tommy Akin, 31, a graduate of Santa Fe 
College, found this to be true after taking Hart’s beginning and intermediate classes.
“He’s not trying to teach you how to 
draw,” Akin said. “He’s coaxing your natu-ral ability in that regard to convey a story, a message, a feeling through visual cues.”
The studio also hosts guest teachers. One 
of these was John Porcellino, who held a weeklong workshop focusing on an auto-biographical approach to comics, Hart said. Students came from Australia and all over the U.S. — a turnout that shows the poten-tial for the studio.
“I’d love to expand, I’d love to have more 
room for a library, I’d love to have 20 or 30 students on a regular basis,” Hart said. “But right now it’s good for the size it is, and we’ll see where it goes.”
A calendar of classes and events can be 
found on SAW’s website, www.sequen-tialartistsworkshop.org. This summer there will be a two-week teen intensive as well as a professional inking and drawing techniques class taught by Justine Mara Andersen, who has worked for DC Comics.
“I’m really happy to be involved,” Ander-
sen said. “They have a lot of great potential. It’s a great resource the community should be excited about.” Local studio teaches students the art of graphic novels

The summer is an interesting time in 
Gainesville. About 40,000 students are gone, 
and the town seems to slow down. The Hip-podrome Theatre takes advantage of this relaxing time to entertain the city with its an-nual summer musical.
The Hippodrome is located at 25 SE Sec-
ond Place, and at the end of this month it will be putting on “The Marvelous Wonderettes,” written and created by Roger Bean and di-rected by the Hippodrome’s artistic director, Lauren Caldwell. Caldwell has been the ar -
tistic director since the early 1990s. The script is given to the theater and then interpreted by Caldwell.
The play will officially open June 1, but 
on May 30 at 7:00 p.m. and May 31 at 8:00 p.m. ,there will be previews for a reduced price of $15.
The show opens at a high school prom in 
1958, where the audience is introduced to the Wonderettes, four girls with big dreams and even bigger voices. Over the course of the evening, the ladies are called on to provide entertainment for the prom, where they sing renditions of hits like “Lollipop” and “Hold Me, Thrill Me, Kiss Me.”
The cast is made up of four women: Wen-
di Stoltzfus, returning from last year’s pro-duction of “Suds,” and two recent UF gradu-ates, Katrina Asmar and Diany Rodriquez. Also onstage is Kelly Atkins, who some fans may remember from previous roles with the Hippodrome.
This is Atkins’ seventh summer musical.“Six out of seven of the musicals I have 
been in are what we call ‘jukebox musicals,’ where the songs are hits from a time period,” Atkins said. “This one incorporates two dis-tinctively different eras — it almost feels like two different shows.”
After the intermission, the play is set in 
1968, 10 years later. The women discuss where they have been in the last decade, as well as their trials, tribulations and triumphs. Famous songs from the 60s are sprinkled in such as “R-E-S-P-E-C-T“ and “Son of a Preacher Man.”
Jessica Hurov, director of marketing and advertising for the Hippodrome, said that this show is for everyone — people who just love to hear big voices, or those with nostal-gia.
Hurov said there are more than 30 songs 
in the show, but some are medleys. The mu-sic will be recorded by a full-orchestrated band prior to the show and then played over speakers.  
Although the music is the main com-
ponent, the outfits are going to be lively as well.
“The costumes are a big spectacle,” 
Caldwell said.
The clothes will transition from poofy 
prom dresses to mini skirts and go-go boots.
Despite attire of the actors and the formal 
appearance of the building from the outside, the Hippodrome has a very “come as you are” feel.
“People can get dressed up or come com-
fortably.  It is just a place for people to go and have fun,” Hurov said.  “We have a bar, people can get drinks, sit back and enjoy two hours of entertainment.”
As well as producing plays and showing 
films, the theater has an art gallery located on the first floor that houses all types of lo-cal art. This summer, in honor of the Hippo-drome’s 40th birthday, the gallery will host a series of exhibits relating to the theater itself.
“The gallery is a Hippodrome retrospec-
tive,” Hurov said.
There will be photographs of plays from 
the last 40 years, as well as behind-the-scenes shots. The theater’s birthday is in April 2013.
Rehearsals for “The Marvelous Won-
derettes” last six hours a day and will run through next week, Caldwell said. If the fin-ished product is anything like the practices it will be full of laughs, fun and dancing.
Ticket prices for students are $12 with an 
ID and senior tickets are $22. General public tickets range from $25 to $32 depending on seating.

drome Theatre or to purchase tickets to see the films and plays, visit www.thehipp.org or check out its Facebook page at https://www.facebook.com/HippodromeTheatre.10, ALLIGATOR §  THURSDAY, MAY 24, 2012

Both Hear Again Music and Movies and 
Hyde & Zeke Records have had to change lo-
cations in order to house more merchandise and accommodate this niche audience.
Although all three stores are within a mile 
of each other, each has its own personality . Wayward is the rebel child, mostly offering punk and garage LPs.  It also sells books, art and coffee. However, it is volunteer-based, only open sporadically despite the “open” sign and the hours listed as 1 p.m. to 8 p.m.
Hyde & Zeke Records, despite its lack of 
air conditioning, is a gold mine of affordable records from Lou Reed to The Smiths. If you brave the musty smell and search the heaps long enough, you can usually find a gem.
“We specialize more in used — that’s our 
market,” Scales said.
Hear Again Music and Movies is mostly 
new vinyls, in plastic, guaranteed not to skip.
“I am into virgin vinyl,” Schaer said. “The 
sound you get out of that is unmatched.” While Hear Again Music and Movies used to have a lot of used records, Schaer said he moved to carrying new vinyl to get away from the “pawn shop” feel.
“Every other person walking through the 
door wanted to sell me stuff,” he added. He said being in Florida, people tend to store re-cords in garages.  They often have mold, water damage and creatures living in the bins they are stored in. Sorting through and cleaning the records became too much of a task.
While Hear Again Music and Movies car -
ries the classics, it also has the newest indie albums, and Schaer offers special order ser -
vice and mail orders to customers looking for something out of the ordinary. It has a variety of posters, CDs and DVDs as well.
Schaer said the music industry recently 
started offering free MP3 downloads of al-bums purchased on vinyl. Those who want the music on their iPods will have the conve-nience of having a digital copy, while still hav-ing the high quality vinyl on hand.
“What the music industry is doing is trying 
to ease people back into vinyl,” Schaer said.
Schaer and Scales agree that Gainesville 
is responsive to record stores and local busi-nesses.
“It’s no Portland, but it could be. Large 
portions of Gainesville want it to be,” Schaer said.
They both agreed that their stores are not 
dependent on students, as other Gainesville businesses are, but it’s not all older people that buy their products.
“I’m seeing a lot of younger people getting 
into vinyl,” Scales said. “A lot of people look at it as a treasure hunt.” THURSDAY, MAY 24, 2012 § ALLIGATOR, 11

Megan Kosinski never takes it off.
The 21-year-old art history graduate and 
Reitz Union Arts & Crafts Center employee participated in a jewelry-making leisure course offered by UF last spring. One of her projects was designing and creating a ster-ling silver ring that she still wears.
The ﬁ  rst three leisure courses for Summer 
A semester began Monday.
The course contents vary from class to 
class and consist of learning how to make arts and crafts or learning how to play guitar, golf or tennis. 
Classes are generally held once a week 
for four weeks and range from $5 to $50 for students.
Leisure courses offer an outlet for stu-
dents to have fun and not have to worry about grades, said Dianna Lampitt, program coordinator of programs, arts and leisure at the UF Student Activities and Involvement Division of Student Affairs.
Registration for the 24 courses opened on 
May 14 for students, faculty and the general public.
Courses are offered in Spring, Fall, Sum-
mer A and Summer B semesters.
The throwing class, which teaches par-
ticipants how to transform clay into usable bowls, and the home bartending class are the most popular, Lampitt said.
Kim Tuttle, the artistic director for Dance 
Alive National Ballet and co-owner of Po-fahl Studios, teaches a dance leisure course. She said the students passion is what keeps her teaching. Professionals at Pofahl Studio, which is located at 1325 NW Second St., have taught leisure courses through UF for about 12 years, Tuttle said.
“So many people who have danced in the 
past have that enthusiasm and passion,” Tut-tle said. “It’s a pleasure to teach them.”
Students with a true passion for dance 
have gone beyond what has been taught by the teachers.
“We’ve had people go on to professional 
careers from our leisure courses,” Tuttle said.
Many of the leisure courses still have spots 
available for this semester, including both guitar classes, golf courses and all four tennis courses. If classes are full for this semester, students can go to the Reitz Union Division of Student Affairs website in late June to sign up for leisure courses in Summer B.
Kosinski suggests participants take ad-
vantage of the opportunity. She enjoyed the jewelry course so much in the spring that she is participating in another leisure course, hand-building clay, during Summer A. She encourages anyone who is interested in learning more about a fun hobby to partici-pate in a leisure course.
“It’s highly relaxing,” she said.12, ALLIGATOR   THURSDAY, MAY 24, 2012

For the Gators, reaching the pinnacle of 
women’s lacrosee has been a quick ride, but 
the trip is not over yet.
No. 1 seed Florida (19-2) is gearing up to 
take on the No. 4 seed Syracuse (18-3) on Friday 
at 5:30 p.m. in Stony Brook, N.Y. in the NCAA Semifinals. 
Last weekend the Gators made history 
by defeating the Nittany Lions at Donald R. Dizney Stadium 15-2 in the NCAA Quarterfi-nals and earning their first-ever Final Four ap-pearance.
“We came here when I was a junior in high 
school, four years ago and there was nothing here,” junior attacker Kitty Cullen said.
“There was no lacrosse team, no nothing 
and it definitely took a huge leap of faith for my class to be the first program, the first girls to come here.
“It also made us a lot more special. Mandy 
really recruited a special group of kids to come here who all had the same dream in mind.”
It is a dream that this group is making a re-
ality.
In addition to earning its 
first Final Four appearance, Florida became just the sec-ond program in the 30-year history of NCAA women’s lacrosse to advance to the Final Four in only its third season.
The Gators and the 
Orange met earlier this season March 3 in Gainesville. Florida fell to Syracuse 12-11 in double overtime. 
“I remember being really upset after the 
game,” Cullen said.� FLORIDA FACES OFF AGAINST

Florida’s bats have returned to 
form, but Jonathon Crawford did not 
take that for granted against Auburn.
The sophomore hurler pitched ar -
guably his best game this season in a 6-1 Gators (41-16) victory against the Tigers (30-27) on Tuesday in the first round of the Southeastern Conference Tournament.
“Jonathon did an outstanding job and gave us a great start,” coach Kevin O’Sullivan said. “Our offense is start-ing to come around a little bit, but it all starts on the mound and Jonathon threw the ball really well.”
Crawford (5-2) pitched 5.2 innings 
and gave up just one unearned run on two hits in the first SEC 
Tournament start of his career. He had a career-high nine strikeouts, which accounted for more than half of the 17 batters he retired.

Lauren Embree is no stranger to 
pressure.
Last year, with Florida one point 
away from a national championship, 
Embree was down 4-0 in the third set of  the decisive match.
Embree battled back and won the 
match and the 2011 national title for the Gators.
This year, the story was a little 
different.
“I’m glad this one wasn’t as dra-
matic,” Embree said.
Embree led No. 2 Florida (27-1) to 
a 4-0 victory and its second consecu-tive national championship against No. 1 UCLA (26-3) Tuesday after -
noon. It is the sixth championship in the program’s history and the first time UF has won back-to-back titles.
“We discovered this year that, 
without a doubt, it is much more difficult to repeat,” coach Roland Thornqvist said.
The Gators came out strong in 
doubles action, taking the point in two matches. The team of Allie Will and Sofie Oyen won a convincing match over UCLA’s top doubles team 8-2. Florida’s Alexandra Cer -
cone and Caroline Hitimana won their match 8-5, which gave Florida the doubles point.
“I think we felt really good after 
the doubles point,” Thornqvist said. 
Florida carried its momentum 
into the singles matches. Cercone was the first to finish and put the Gators up 2-0.
“I’ll say I play my best tennis 
and I compete the hardest in the NCAAs,” Cercone said. “There’s something about the atmosphere [at the NCAA Championships] with the people and the support that goes into this event that brings the best out of me.”
Cercone was named to the NCAA 
All-Tournament Team for the sec-ond consecutive year.Florida blanks UCLA,

 Florida is a girls school. With all due re-
spect to Florida State’s days as a wom-en’s college, UF is the place to be for 
the fairer sex in the Sunshine State
  Roland Thornqvist and the Gators wom-
en’s tennis team just won their second con-secutive national title. Florida will say good-bye to only one senior — Joanna Mather — so expect another title run next season.
  Amanda O’Leary has guided the lacrosse 
team to its ﬁ  rst Final Four in program his-tory. It only took O’Leary three years to get this far and, like tennis, she only loses Caro-line Cochran, who suffered an ACL tear in the Gators’ home opener March 15.
  If the lacrosse team wins the ultimate 
prize this weekend, UF’s females will have produced two national titles in a span of six days, adding to an already impressive col-lection of hardware in 2012.
  Gymnastics, indoor track and ﬁ  eld and 
tennis have all claimed Southeastern Con-ference championships this calendar year, and lacrosse swept the American Lacrosse Conference regular season and tournament titles.
  Volleyball advanced to the Elite Eight, 
soccer placed second in the SEC Tournament and women’s basketball punched a ticket to The Big Dance after a long absence.
  Football brings in the money, but right 
now it’s the girls building up the program prestige. All 11 women’s sports at UF have won a conference championship in the last ﬁ  ve years.
  The men have en-
joyed their fair share of triumphs. The in-door track and ﬁ  eld squad claimed its third straight nation-al championships in the spring. Baseball 
has the tools to avenge its College World Se-ries loss last summer.
  But the moneymakers? Eh.  Basketball experienced a resurgence the 
last two seasons, but both runs have fallen disappointingly short, each ending with blown second-half leads in the Elite Eight.
  As far as football is concerned, the situ-ation is pretty desolate. Urban Meyer had unprecedented short-term success at UF, but he left the program in shambles.
  Will Muschamp, in his ﬁ  rst head-coach-
ing job, has to clean up the mess, and I hate to break it to you, but it’s going to take a while.
  Football will make the big bucks, and The 
Swamp will ﬁ  ll up with 90,000 fans every Sat-urday in games not played against Furman, but for now, it merely serves to fund the real athletic juggernauts at this school.

immortal words of Beyonce, “[Girls] run this mother.”

� HEDBERG TIED FOR 16TH 
WITH A SCORE OF 145 (+1).
  KATIE AGOSTIN
 Alligator Staff Writer 
    
 During the 2011-12 season, the 
worst the Gators have placed in a 
tournament was 13th at the Ma-son Rudolph Fall Preview.
Since then, Florida has only 
ﬁ  nished outside of the top 10 once.
  However, on Tuesday the 
women had another falling out. They ﬁ  nished the ﬁ  rst day of the NCAA Championships with a 302 (+14) to put them in a tie for 18th.
  “We made some mistakes with 
golf course management in that we didn’t give the ﬁ  rm greens enough respect,” coach Jan Dowl-ing said. “We also weren’t as com-mitted and decisive as we needed to be on a NCAA Championship caliber golf course.”
  Senior Evan Jensen led the 
Gators on Tuesday with a 74 (+2) carding only three birdies against ﬁ  ve bogeys. Mia Piccio, Andrea Watts and Camilla Hedberg all turned in rounds of 76 (+4). 
  Although Florida had a tough 
day, Dowling was conﬁ  dent in its ability to get back in the mix.
  “It’s just minor, minor things 
that got us [Tuesday], and if we make these small changes it’s go-ing to go from shooting 14 over to somewhere close to par,” Dowl-
ing said.
  On Wednes-
day, the Gators were much clos-er to par than their ﬁ  rst round. They were able to capitalize on their short 
game, something they struggled with Tuesday, and improved nine strokes for a second day total of 293 (+5). 
  This time they were led by 
Hedberg, who’s ﬁ  ve birdies helped her card a 69 (-3). Hed-berg’s round gave her a huge jump on the leaderboard. She will start the third round tied for 16th after starting Wednesday’s round tied for 70th.
  “Camilla played a really solid 
round of golf today. She had ﬁ  ve birdies, which means she was rolling the ball very well on the putting green,” Dowling said. “She hit the ball great, and you’ve got to do that out here.”
  Jensen and Piccio were also 
able to improve their standings moving up two and six spots, re-spectively. 
  Although the team had a signif-
icantly better round on Wednes-day, they weren’t able to move up the leader board much. The Gators will start the third round tied for 15th in hopes of breaking into the top 10.
  “Tied for 15th doesn’t sound 
that great, but there’s so few shots separating us from 15th and 10th and so forth,” Dowling said. “If we keep playing solid like we did today, I think we’re going to keep moving up that leaderboard.”

she won in straight sets 6-3, 6-2 over the Bruins’ 
Skyler Morton. 
Oyen’s win set the stage for Embree, who had 
won the first set of her match 6-4. In the second set, Embree dominated UCLA’s McCall Jones and won 6-0, clinching the title for Florida.
“As soon as I saw Sofie had won out — and 
I was up a set — I knew there was a chance,” Embree said. “Things go through your mind, so you have to stay focused. … But I definitely wanted to finish.”
Senior Joanna Mather had just started her 
third set and was up 1-0 when Embree finished her match.
“It’s just incredible,” Mather said. “I just can’t 
believe it’s over and we did it again.”NCAA Men’s Singles - Round of 64

team now in the season than we were 
at the beginning when we played Syracuse. We’re really going to focus on finishing our shots this time so we can come out with the ‘W.’”

Jonathon Crawford throws against Arkansas on April 29. Crawford lowered his ERA to 3.34 
after giving up one unearned run in 5.2 innings against Auburn on Tuesday.
Weitzel: ‘[Crawford has] a special arm you don’t get to see too much’
don’t get to see too much … arms likes 
that are hard to find,” assistant coach Brad Weitzel said. “He’s putting it to-gether. He walks a little bit too many, but he’s getting better and better each outing. He’s getting more confidence.”
Issues with control plagued Crawford 
as he walked four batters, including free passes to Jay Gonzalez and Justin Bryant to lead off the first and fourth frames, respectively. Crawford walked three bat-ters with a full count and stranded all four on the bases.
“It was more just lack of focus,” Craw-
ford said. “(I) just lost focus with some batters.”
Auburn’s Bobby Andrews scored 
the lone run Crawford surrendered. Andrews led off the third with a single and a throwing error by Nolan Fontana allowed the next batter, Zach Alvord, to reach base. A Gonzalez sacrifice bunt moved both runners over, and Andrews scored on a Creede Simpson sacrifice fly.
Other than the third, Crawford faced 
little trouble and lasted until he hit Dan Glevenyak with a pitch in the sixth. O’Sullivan pulled Crawford and replaced him with Steven “Paco” Rodriguez.
Rodriguez, Greg Larson and Aus-
tin Maddox used just 33 pitches to get through the final 3.1 innings. The trio gave up just one hit and fanned two bat-ters.
“Our relief pitching was good,” 
O’Sullivan said. “It was good to get Maddox and [Rodriguez] back out there. They haven’t been used a whole lot in the last week and a half or so. It was good to get those guys out there.”

“There are some people who are still
