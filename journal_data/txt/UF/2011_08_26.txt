� THE UF COMMUNITY SUPPORTED 
AGRICULTURE PROGRAM WILL START AGAIN IN OCTOBER.

  UF students, faculty and staff who enjoy 
fresh produce soon won’t have to travel far 
to get their ﬁ  x. 
  The Gator Community Supported Agri-
culture program is back for a second year and this semester is opening a second pick-up location on campus.
  The Gator CSA allows Gainesville com-
munity members to pay in advance for shares of produce grown by local farmers. 
Each Monday starting in mid-October, 
farmers will deliver a box of varied pro-duce to one or both of the on-campus loca-tions: the all-decal lot near Bledsoe Drive and the Health Science Center.
  “[The Gator CSA] is an opportunity for 
people to form relationships with farm-ers,” said Stephanie Sims, implementation coordinator with the UF Ofﬁ  ce of Sustain-ability.
  The program was launched to promote 
sustainability on campus as well as healthy eating and support for local agriculture, according to the Ofﬁ  ce of Sustainability website. 
  The department decided to add the 
Health Science Center location this year because of an increased interest in the pro-gram, Sims said.

  A focus on graduate education high-
lighted UF President Bernie Machen’s State 
of the University address Thursday.
  At the ﬁ  rst faculty Senate meeting of 
the school year, Machen said the adminis-tration intends to add up to $7 million to graduate student stipends and create more student fellowships.
    Although he did not address where the 
funds may come from, he said the increas-es would mean higher stipends and more graduate students.
  Citing the ﬁ  ndings in 
a report commissioned last year to evaluate doc-toral programs, he said UF’s programs need a plan for the future. 
  “More than anything, 
they are a call to action — one that couldn’t be more timely in the light 
of the changing higher education climate nationally,” he said.
  He said each department has been asked to draft a ﬁ  ve-year plan to address its deﬁ  ciencies. 
  The UF committee analyzed the ﬁ  nd-
ings of a National Research Council survey to see where UF stood among its peers.
  Compared to other universities in the 
Association of American Universities, UF ranked 53 out of 61 in its percentage of programs that are among the best in their disciplines. 
  Machen acknowledged concerns fac-
ulty had with  the NRC survey, which used six-year-old data. But together with UF’s report, he said, the survey still matters. Machen: doctoral programs need adjustments

Squirrel blamed for flag thefts 
from police memorial
TOLEDO, Ohio — Police in 
Ohio have discovered that small 
flags being swiped from a police memorial were being squirreled away.
Two Toledo officers watched 
on Wednesday as a squirrel quickly snatched a flag off its wooden dowel and ran off with it. Lt. James Brown said the bushy-tailed critter was too quick to catch.
Later, police noticed a squirrel 
hanging out on a tree branch out-side a third-floor window at their headquarters building. They also spotted a squirrel’s nest made of leaves and branches — and at least two of the little flags.
Brown said at least three of 
the flags have gone missing in recent days.
He’s careful to point out he 
can’t prove all were the work of 
the same squirrel.

Students hand out PB&Js to homeless
MORGAN WATKINS
Alligator Staff Writer
Homeless people in Gainesville 
got a free meal Thursday that has 
long been a grade-school lunch tra-dition: good old peanut butter and jelly sandwiches. 
The PB&J came courtesy of the 
Catholic Gators club at UF. 
Students made more than 1,000 
sandwiches Wednesday night for the organization’s “PB and Jesus” event to give to the homeless the fol-lowing day. 
More than 200 sandwiches were 
given on Thursday morning to St. Francis House, a homeless shelter and soup kitchen in Gainesville. 
Eight students ventured out with 
the Catholic Gators’ campus min-ister, Debby Cherwak, at noon on Thursday to hand out as many of the remaining sandwiches as they could to homeless people around town. 
They visited Bo Diddley Com-
munity Plaza and a tent city in Gainesville, distributing sandwiches to everyone they met. 
“We’re all in love with Jesus. They 
always say, ‘When I was hungry, you gave me food,’” said Amanda Ed-wards, a 21-year-old UF senior who went on the outing. “We’re serving him by serving others.”
The students split up to cover as 
much of the tent city area as they 
could, handing out sandwiches to the people they met and leaving some food behind for people to dis-tribute to others later in the day.
One makeshift house made of 
wooden boards nailed together and 
covered with tarps and towels was empty when a few of the students walked over, calling for anyone inside to come out and get a free PB&J. 
The students left a few sandwich-
es there in case people returned to the site that night. 
Kathryn Stolarz, 22, graduated 
from UF in Spring 2011 and has been a member of Catholic Gators since her freshman year. She had never visited a tent city before.Feeding the homeless was the 
issue at the center of a controversy in Gainesville that raged for more than a year as people argued about whether the city should continue to enforce a meal limit that restricted soup kitchens and shelters from feeding more than 130 people per day. 
The Gainesville City Commission 
eliminated this restriction Aug. 18, replacing it with a time limit that al-lows organizations to provide food for no more than three continuous hours per day.
Stolarz said she didn’t agree with 
the idea of a meal limit on feeding the homeless.
“I don’t think anyone should ever 
be limited to the amount that they should give,” she said. “It doesn’t make sense to me to stop people from helping other people.”
After the students left the tent 
city, they took the remaining sand-
wiches to the Bread of the Mighty Food Bank in Gainesville, Cherwak said.
They donated 144 pounds of 
PB&J to the organization. The food bank then sent the food to the Reich-ert House Youth Academy, a non-profit organization in Gainesville that supports at-risk boys in middle and high school.
“It doesn’t make sense to 
me to stop people from help-
ing other people.”

In the name of sustainability, UF 
students with motorcycles and scoot-
ers will have to pay as much for an-nual parking decals as students with automobiles this year.
It now costs $144 per year and $72 
per semester to buy a decal for a mo-torcycle or a scooter, compared to $96 per year and $48 per semester for the 2010 school year. 
It was the third price increase 
to motorcycle and scooter de-cals over the past three years, said Scott Fox, director at UF Trans-portation and Parking Services.  
The department will know in Septem-ber whether fewer scooter and motor -
cycle decals were sold this school year compared with last school year.
Such decals were previously 
cheaper than automobile ones as part of an effort to encourage students to use motorcycles and scooters, which are more sustainable than cars be-cause they have better gas mileage, Fox said. 
A few years ago, UF surveyed stu-
dents who owned motorcycles and scooters.
About 80 percent of students sur -
veyed said if motorcycle and scooter parking weren’t so convenient and cheap, they would ride the bus, Fox said. 
Because students were driving 
more on their scooters and motor -
cycles than they would if they had a car, more gas was being burned than necessary, Fox said. 
“It really doesn’t make sense to 
offer students a discount to conduct behavior that is very questionably an-tisustainable,” Fox said. 
After the survey, the department 
set three price increases in place to gradually push the price of scooter and motorcycle decals up to that of automobiles. 
“Our intent is not to push students into one mode of transportation or an-other, but to no longer give students a discount to get off the bus and ride a scooter,” Fox said4, ALLIGATOR §  FRIDAY, AUGUST 26, 2011

Despite the Gators’ disappointing 8-5 finish for the 
2010 football season, UF students were still clicking the 
“refresh” button Wednesday night to buy tickets for  away games this year.   
Tickets went on sale for the Auburn University, Uni-
versity of South Carolina, Louisiana State University and University of Kentucky away games at 6 p.m., said Mark Gajda, assistant athletic director of ticket opera-tions at UF. 
All tickets except those for the Kentucky game were 
sold out by 10 p.m.
“It’s very common to see that type of situation last 
night,” he said. 
Gajda said ticket sales hadn’t dropped since the pre-
vious year, when student tickets quickly sold out for away games against the University of Alabama Crim-son Tide and the Florida State University Seminoles. 
Rachel Wolf, a psychology senior, bought a ticket for 
the Auburn game this season.
“I’m excited for this season,” Wolf said. “I’m hopeful 
that we’ll have a turnaround, and if not, it will just be fun to go and support them.”
Students are given 10 percent of the ticket allotment 
UF receives for away games, and the different universi-ties determine ticket prices.Away game tickets

UF is showing the rest of the 
country that Gators care.
This year, UF was the 5th high-
est contributor of recent college 
graduates to Teach for America, with 75 students joining the corps.  
TFA is a national program that sends recent college graduates to teach in low-performing schools around the United States.
Angie Brice, regional director of 
recruitment for Florida, said she be-lieves UF is a top contributor because its students care strongly about so-cial justice and making high-quality education accessible to everyone. 
She said the number of students 
interested in TFA was fairly low when she came to UF as a recruit-ment manager in 2009. During her time at UF, Brice said she and other recruiters placed an emphasis on working with students and faculty to raise awareness on campus about America’s achievement gap. 
Two years ago, UF wasn’t even in 
the top 10 list of contributors, Brice said. Now, it ranks with such peren-nial contributors as University of California, Berkeley , and University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. 
“To go from a place of a lack of 
awareness … and to see that UF is in [the top tier], so many amazing Gators are truly committed to this cause,” Brice said.
UF is also a top producer of di-
verse members, which is impressive because TFA recruits at about 300 colleges and universities, she said.
Former Student Body Vice Presi-dent Larnell Vickers worked in TFA’s regional office for a year be-fore joining the corps. He said he got involved because of his concern that low-income students aren’t learn-ing as well as their more privileged counterparts, which he considers a crisis.  
Vickers is now teaching ninth 
-grade reading at Booker T. Wash-ington High School in Miami.
“I truly wanted to give back and 
make a difference,” he said. “I per -
sonally know that I want to continue and have a career in education, so I wanted to get that firsthand experi-ence and be on the front lines.”
Brice said TFA received about 
47,000 applications nationally last year and has an 11 percent accep-tance rate. 
New recruits receive training in 
classroom management before be-ing sent to one of 43 regions across the country .  
Because of the demanding nature 
of the positions, Brice said people are not likely to apply because of economic factors such as not being able to find a job out of college. 
Jessica McCarthy , a family , youth 
and community sciences senior, wants to join TFA when she gradu-ates and participated in a similar program this summer.
McCarthy traveled to Pennsyl-
vania to be part of Summerbridge Pittsburgh, which is part of a nation-wide program called Breakthrough Collaborative. 
From June to August, Sum-
merbridge volunteers taught low-performing middle school students science, math, English and Spanish with the goal that when students returned to school in the fall, they would perform better and get into good high schools. She said she enjoyed working with the students because they needed some focused help.
“I was on the fence before about 
wanting to be a teacher,” she said, “and working with those kids made me decide that I really wanted to.” FRIDAY, AUGUST 26, 2011 § ALLIGATOR, 5

Students who frequently attend UF sporting events 
will now be rewarded with free prizes.
Beginning with Friday’s volleyball game against Bos-
ton College, students can join the Rowdy Reptiles, a new student rewards program sponsored by the UF Athletic Association and State Farm insurance company. 
All undergraduate, graduate and professional school students are eligible to join the free program.
At each eligible sporting event, there will be a booth 
where students can scan their Gator 1 Cards and receive points. Once a student accumulates a certain level of points, he or she will receive a prize, such as a Gators hat, a T-shirt or a behind-the-scenes tour of one of the Gators athletic facilities.
Each sporting event counts for a different number of 
points. 
However, students cannot receive points for at-
tending football games because tracking that atten-dance activity would be too difficult, said Meghan Fitzgerald, marketing director for Gator Athletics.  
Sophomore aerospace engineering sophomore Deidre Cheeves said she plans to join Rowdy Reptiles.
“I already go to pretty much every sporting event pos-
sible,” Cheeves said.Athletic Association starts rewards program for studentsUF becomes a top contributor of grads to Teach for America

Today’s question:  Did you buy tickets to the away 
games this football season?
44% YES
56% NO
63 TOTAL VOTESThursday’s question: Would you partici-pate in a clothing-optional 5K? Tea party’s image, reputation a hindrance
It’s no secret that the tea party we all hear so much 
about isn’t such a grand party, after all. Many popu-lar news outlets make the tea party seem like a stub-
born group of Americans who try to derail the supposed bipartisan support that exists in Washington, D.C., and to some extent, they’re right. 
On the other hand, few realize the actual core values 
the tea party stands for. There is more to this party than simply a bunch of people who are “mad as hell.”
The tea party started as a grassroots campaign to re-
store common sense and small government in America. A simple glance at their mission statement outlines the three core values of the party: fiscal responsibility, lim-ited government and free markets. Not surprisingly, most can identify with these values. That’s how parties make themselves attractive to voters: by reaching them on levels with which most anyone can agree.
While the tea party attempts to align itself with the 
Boston Tea Party we all learned about in social studies, it seems to miss the point. 
Somewhere along the way, many of the tea partiers 
began to view the Boston Tea Party purely as an act of stubbornness as opposed to an act of dissent aimed at a greater good.
It doesn’t help that the key figures of leadership in 
the party are less than desirable. Often considered the top figurehead of the tea party movement, former Alas-kan Gov. Sarah Palin has seen the shortcomings of her career far outweigh her successes. 
Although she was Alaska’s first female governor and 
was credited with helping to restructure Alaska’s fis-cal policies, she also notoriously butchered the English language and established herself as a vapid Republican vice presidential candidate who flip-flopped stances, having a blatant lack of knowledge on popular issues. Don’t forget that her decision to be a reality TV star did not earn her any political clout, either.Along with Palin, 2012 Presi-
dential hopeful Michele Bach-mann is also creating public im-age problems for the tea party. Like her counterpart, she too 
has been credited with numerous verbal slip-ups early in her campaign. Many of her speeches are filled with strong passion, but her delivery has made her an instant turnoff to many. She constantly credits herself with things she has not done and often lacks real solutions to the problems we face today.
With the 2012 Republican presidential race starting 
to pick up the pace, the tea party poses an imminent threat to the Republican Party’s election hopes. 
President Barack Obama won his 2008 election 
through an upsurge in young voters. Unfortunately, the tea party does not appeal to this demographic. 
To make things worse, many people from all age 
groups can’t relate and generally disapprove of the party. By rousing so much displeasure, the tea party is essentially aiding the re-election chances for Obama.
The best thing tea partiers could do is back away 
from being the center of attention. The tea party is only serving to inadvertently aid the other side and worsen the chances for change in Washington, D.C.
The tea party has a great underlying initiative to re-
store the values of the United States of America. The cold hard truth is that government has grown too large, and we are fiscally irresponsible. 
While the tea party should be commended for their 
values, it is time they take a step back from the spot-light. The time has come to part ways with their stand-offish and anger-inducing behaviors. They must allow real change to happen.
Joshua Segall writes for the Arizona Daily Wildcat at the 
University of Arizona.UWireWelcome back, Gators. We hope you have enjoyed our coverage of the first week of classes. For those of you who are new to UF or new to read-
ing the Alligator, we have a special tradition for our Friday editorial. 
Basically, the editorial staff, with help from the rest of 
our Alligator team, goes through the events of the week — drawing on personal experiences, national news or ran-dom nonsense we think about — and hand out our very own awards. 
So enough introduction. It’s time for our welcome-back-
to-school-or-maybe-it’s-your-first-week-here-so-we-wel-come-you-but-not-as-much-so-don’t-feel-bad-but-maybe-next-time-you’ll-feel-special edition of...
Darts and Laurels 
This week, a man of great importance to many of your 
daily lives has stepped down from his prominent posi-tion. No, we aren’t talking about Obama, so don’t freak out Obamamaniacs. 
For our first recipient, we are giving a thank-you-for-mak-
ing-innovative-and-reliable-shit LAUREL to Steve Jobs. 
But with every show of praise comes a necessarily nasty 
call-out. 
That’s why we’re throwing an are-you-really-that-lazy-
that-you-have-to-ticket-bicyclists DART to University Po-
lice. 
It’s quite shocking to discover that campus police were 
wasting valuable resources stopping those evil bicyclists for speeding —  how can they tell? 
If anything, the police should be monitoring the non-
sense that goes on around campus. Specifically, we are talk-ing about the target of our what-kind-of-moron-mugs-a-worker-from-a-nonprofit-newspaper DART. That’s right, a 
masked robber held an Alligator staff member at gunpoint Thursday morning. You might be able to find more loose change in a sofa than in our pockets.
If you haven’t heard, Tripoli is a pretty rough place 
these days. That’s why we are awarding a damn-that-was-a-brave-thing-to-do LAUREL to CNN producer Jomana 
Karadsheh. This bad-ass journalist stood up to a troubled Libyan gunman who was holding three dozen journalists hostage. Through calm appeals to humanity in this troubled man’s decisions, she was able to persuade him to let her and her colleagues go. 
Our final winner has been given two awards. First, we throw a dangit-classes-aren’t-canceled-for-

U-Wire FRIDAY, AUGUST 26, 2011 § ALLIGATOR, 7
If any scandal can finally shake the suffocating, imperial grip 
the White House holds on our nation’s dying hope for peace and prosperity, it must be Operation Fast and Furious. 
Although heavyweights in the mainstream media continue 
to sideline the issue, the secret gun-running scheme, which put more than 2,000 weapons into the hands of Mexican drug car -
tels, makes Watergate look like petty theft.
Operation Fast and Furious began in 2009 with a plan by 
myriad federal law enforcement agencies, including the FBI, the Drug Enforcement Administration and the Bureau of Alco-hol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, to purposefully allow guns to be sold to known criminals so the weapons could be tracked as they reached high-level cartel members.
The program came to a sudden halt earlier this year when 
it was revealed in a congressional report that the death of Bor -
der Patrol Agent Brian Terry , who was murdered with some of the same guns the ATF allowed to walk across the border, was “likely a preventable tragedy,” according to USA Today.
In a Fox News report, guns from Operation Fast and Furi-
ous were said to have been linked to at least 11 other violent crimes in the United States alone. 
Sen. Chuck Grassley , R-Iowa, and 
Rep. Darrell Issa, R-Calif., have spear -
headed the congressional investiga-tion into the operation. In a July 18 let-
ter to Attorney General Eric Holder, the congressmen charged the Department of Justice with attempting to cover up the in-vestigation by not supplying requested information.
Congressional testimonies by ATF agents contradict claims 
made by President Barack Obama that neither he nor the DOJ knew of the controversial operation. Former ATF Special Agent William Newell told Congress that he communicated with Kevin O’Reilly , a staffer on Obama’s National Security Council, about Operation Fast and Furious in September 2010, according to CNSNews.com. ATF’s acting director, Kenneth Melson, has refused calls for his resignation, saying he will not be “the fall guy” for the program, according to the Los Angeles Times.
The entire operation reeks of illegal activity and corruption; 
it’s no wonder Obama and Holder want to distance themselves from it. But should anyone really believe that they had no prior knowledge?
Back in 2009, Holder praised the launching of a “major new 
effort to break the backs of the cartels” in a speech about Project Gunrunner, which later involved Operation Fast and Furious. Also, Project Gunrunner was granted $10 million in taxpayer money under the “stimulus package” passed in 2009.
Federal agencies that are supposed to be tasked with keep-
ing America safe got caught willingly supplying weapons to vicious drug cartels south of our border; the public should be aware and angry . The DOJ admits 1,048 guns are still on the loose with no way to track them down, according to the Wash-ington Times. 
Was the operation really designed to bring down the cartels 
in the first place, or is there something larger at play here?
Whatever the truth is surrounding these gunrunning op-
erations and the resulting violence both north and south of the border, it must be brought to light.

sity of Central Florida.

Target Corp. defines itself in opposition 
to Wal-Mart Stores Inc. and other retail-ers. At Target, shoppers see large ban-
ners encouraging recycling, and employee ar -
eas feature posters promoting racial equality and gay rights.
Target essentially presents itself as a more 
ethical alternative to Walmart. However, be-neath its progressive veneer, Target is just as exploitative and amoral as its competitors.
At Target, low prices are made possible 
by poor working conditions. New employees are paid marginally more than the legally pre-scribed minimum, leaving workers in most states with less than a living wage. Some Tar -
get employees must supplement their income with food stamps in order to survive. Mean-while, Target’s upper management absorbs enormous amounts of money, with CEO Gregg W. Steinhafel bringing in more than $13 million per year. 
Target employees are effectively forbid-
den to organize in order to improve their conditions. New workers are subjected to elaborate propaganda videos detailing the supposed awful consequences of unioniza-tion. In instances in which serious attempts at organization were mounted, employees have been threatened with dismissal should their attempt to organize succeed.
There are 1,750 Target stores in the U.S., 
and none of them are unionized.
However, Target’s cashiers and cart at-
tendants enjoy positively luxurious working conditions compared with the people who produce Target’s merchandise. Much of Target’s manufac-
turing is farmed out to places like China and Cambodia, where a worker can be bought for less than $1 an hour and child labor laws are laxly applied. One Jordanian Target supplier came to international attention earlier this year when female workers reported being regularly raped and tortured by their employers.
The company has become the largest cam-
paign contributor to tea party darling U.S. Rep. Michele Bachmann (R.-Minn.). Bachmann’s solution to the current economic depression is the abolition of the minimum wage, some-thing that would give Target a greater oppor -
tunity to squeeze profit out of its workers.
In 2010, Target donated $150,000 to a fund 
for Minnesotan gubernatorial candidate Tom Emmer. 
Like Bachmann, Emmer aggressively sup-
ported anti-labor legislation and the elimina-tion of the minimum wage in Minnesota.
Target has capitalized on its image as the 
underdog to Walmart’s evil empire, but in re-ality , Target and Walmart are identical in their total devotion to profit by any means neces-sary. Shop at Target if you choose, but don’t fool yourself into thinking that you’re partici-pating in anything positive.

the University of Oklahoma.

  Head brewer Craig Birkmaier poses next to a cask of beer at Swamp Head Brewery on Thursday. 
He recovered part of a batch of beer Monday after power was cut for more than an hour. 
Head brewer: Bad beer 
would have been too bitter
— which happened to be on the same 
grid that ofﬁ  cials say probably started the ﬁ  re — to lose power.
  Some essential systems of brew-
ing, like the cooling structures, require more power than most buildings get. In their case, they are on a three-phase system, where each phase carries about 120 volts.
  A normal house has 240 volts, 
Birkmaier said. He said he uses what works out to be about 308 volts.
  On Monday, one of the three phases 
lay on the ground: a live wire.
  The half-batch of beer sat in the 
second-to-last step of brewing, whirl-pooling, for about an hour before he was able to persuade authorities to turn the power back on for them, Birk-maier said.
  In whirlpooling, the beer-to-be cir-
culates around the tank, forcing solids (e.g., hops) into a cone in the center.
  The longer the beer, called wort in 
this stage of the process, sits with the hops, the bitterer it gets, and typically the beer only sits for about 15 min-utes.
  “It wouldn’t be a question of losing 
beer, but it would have tasted bad or been too bitter,” he said.
  To compensate, Birkmaier made the 
other half batch scheduled for Tues-day less “hoppy” than it would have normally been.
  Although Swamp Head Brewery 
was able to get the power back on in time to save the beer, one of its neigh-bors, Kinetic Concepts Inc., didn’t have power restored until the next day. BEER , from page 1  MORGAN WATKINS

  A ﬁ  ght with his girlfriend landed Alfonso Lock-
hart in the ER on Wednesday after she stabbed him 
in the left hand with a knife, according to an arrest report from Gainesville Police.
  Then, the report said, Carneka White went for 
his back. The stab narrowly missed Lockhart’s spine.
  He appeared to be in stable condition Thursday 
afternoon, said Cpl. Tscharna Senn, spokeswoman for the Gainesville Police Department. 
    Lockhart, of Gainesville, told police he and 
White, 21, were arguing over cellphone calls he’d received from other women, according to the re-port.
  During the squabble, the 5-foot-4, 105-pound 
White grabbed a knife from the kitchen and stabbed Lockhart ﬁ  rst in the hand and then in the back when he turned to get away from her, the re-port said.
  Lockhart then got out of the home at Fairview 
Apartments before collapsing on the lawn. Ofﬁ  -cers responded at 2:45 p.m., the report said.
  Detective Benjamin Smith arrested White on a 
felony charge of aggravated battery, Senn said. 
    White’s bond was set at $5,000, but she has not 
been released from the Alachua County Jail, ac-cording to the Alachua County Sheriff’s Ofﬁ  ce.    Jealous woman stabs boyfriendCOPS Market now has two

Kathy Graham, who owns Graham 
Farms with her husband, Marvin, said the farm’s weekly share prices range from $6 to $16. Last year, 60 people collected shares from Gra-ham farms, and this year the farm has 80 signed up so far, Kathy Gra-ham said.
  In addition to fresh produce, 
they sell jams and jellies.
  Graham said the Gator CSA 
program can be a convenient op-tion for people who like local produce but are unable to attend farmers markets. 
  “It helps us reach a whole dif-
ferent group of people,” she said. 
  Graham added that the pro-
gram could be a good opportu-nity for people to try things they haven’t tried before, such as col-lared greens and Swiss chard. 
  “This has opened up a lot of people 
to what is grown locally ,” she said.

ing a list of the participating farmers and how to become a member of the Gator CSA, visit sustainable.uﬂ  .edu/gatorcsa. FARM , from page 1FRIDAY, AUGUST 26, 2011

Florida running back Jeff Demps missed all of spring practice and summer workouts, but he said coach-
es have been helping him get up to speed in offensive coordinator Charlie Weis’ pro-style offense.
GREG LUCA 
Alligator Staff Writer
 
After missing all of the spring 
and summer practice seasons, it’s natural that senior running back Jeff Demps could be a few steps behind. 
Although he admits learning 
the new offensive scheme has been difficult, he said he’s confi-dent in his knowledge. 
“Some days it’s easier than 
some other days,” Demps said. “It’s tough for me to miss the whole spring and then come back and try to learn it all in a couple weeks. But my position coach, coach Weis and the assistants have been helping me out. So I’ve been picking it up pretty good so far.”
Also aiding Demps through 
the difficult transition is redshirt senior running back Chris Rain-ey, who plays a similar style as Demps and has had ample time to learn the ins and outs of the of-fense. 
Demps is also getting a fresh 
start from a health standpoint af-ter being limited by a foot injury throughout last season. The nag-ging ailment frustrated Demps by restricting his ability to run and cut, but he’s been entirely healthy since camp started. “I actually think I got a lot 
stronger and change direction a lot better,” Demps said. “It should be a good year for me.”
Brantley dealing with back 
pain: Although back soreness has recently limited senior John Brantley, Will Muschamp has no concerns about Florida’s No. 1 quarterback. 
“I just don’t have a whole lot to 
be concerned about at this point,” Muschamp said. “Certainly if we were sitting here Wednesday or Thursday of game week, I’d be concerned. I feel good where we are.”
Brantley participated in full 
p r a c t i c e Tuesday, but was pulled during the 
team’s Wednesday scrimmage. Muschamp said Brantley’s re-moval was part of a predeter -
mined plan, and that the injury is nothing more than minor sore-ness. 
Demps said Brantley has been 
“full go” through most of camp and hasn’t missed too many rep-etitions in practice. 
Demps has no concerns about 
the injury hindering Brantley’s ability to pick up the new offense, Demps making up for 
lost time, fully healthy
� MURPHY IS UF’S GO-TO PLAYER.
JOE MORGAN
Alligator Writer
 
Kelly Murphy is a rock for Florida.A first-team All-American last season, 
Murphy is the Gators’ leading returner in kills (337) and one of five seniors suit-ing up for coach Mary Wise’s squad as it opens its season at 7:30 tonight against Boston College in the O’Connell Center.
“She’s a pretty cerebral type of play-
er,” Wise said. “She’s not the most emo-tional player by any stretch, but what she is is a go-to player.”In terms of leadership, Murphy could 
be considered the type of player who sets an example for her teammates with 
her play on the court.
As her kill num-
bers indicate, Mur -
phy is an offensive force, but she also showed her versatil-ity by recording the third-most digs (239) 
for UF last season.
“Kelly has the 
skills, whether it’s behind the service line, whether it’s setting or attacking, she has Gators leaning on Murphy 
for offense as season opensALLIGATOR STAFF
Welcome to the first incarnation of the alligator-
Sports mailbag. It’s a working model, but we hope 
to answer any and all questions you have on Gators sports. And we’ll make it fun. 
Send questions to us on Twitter: @alligator-
Sports or at sports@alligator.org. 
Let’s get to it. 
@Will_Muschamp: What type of defense 
will we be running?
Well, coach, I thought you’d be able to tell 
us that. Since, you know, you’re the head coach 
of the football team and all. But that’s just silly. (Editors’ note: @Will_Muschamp is not the official Twitter of Will Muschamp.)  
Seriously though, the Gators have the per -
sonnel up front to employ both the 3-4 and the 4-3 successfully. But our gut feeling is Mus-champ and Quinn will run the 4-3 as the base defense, with an emphasis on a two-gap, run-stopping system. The strength of the defense is Ronald Powell, Sharrif Floyd, Dominique Ea-sley , Omar Hunter and Jaye Howard. The big guys inside are capable of holding the point of attack, allowing Powell and the linebackers to make plays in space. Outside of Jelani Jenkins and Jon Bostic, there isn’t enough talent at line-backer to run the 3-4 predominantly . But it will be an effective scheme in certain situations.
 @PhilipGaryTalks: If Brantley struggles 
should Gators get Jeff in game? I’ve seen this with Chris Leak...ended with a champion-ship.
For those who don’t know, Jeff is freshman 
quarterback Jeff Driskel, who came to Florida in January as the top-rated passer in the class of 2011. When the two-quarterback system worked in 2006, it was because it helped the of-fense for a change-of-pace quarterback to come Defense, steaks and hostagesTHE MAILBAG

Murphy
the skills,” Wise said. “She wants 
the ball, she wants to make the plays at crunch time, and she can deliver. That’s what you want in a senior, an experienced player.”
However, being a leader is 
more than putting together a good effort on the court each match.
Murphy now shoulders the 
responsibility — with her fellow seniors — of keeping the Gators focused on competing for the Southeastern Conference and na-tional titles.
Add the increased national at-
tention for her efforts during the 2010 campaign to the equation, and Murphy is dealing with quite a spotlight.
“There’s definitely a little bit 
more pressure,” Murphy said. “Being a senior, there’s a lot more responsibility because you’re the oldest on the team, so everybody’s looking up to you. You definitely have that pressure to perform all the time when the team’s doing well, when the team’s not doing well.” 
Murphy’s choice in leadership 
style can go many ways, but her cool demeanor will likely rule out.
Fortunately for the underclass-
men, Murphy said this year’s se-niors took notes from leaders in the past, who showed that each can take an individual approach in setting an example.
“I’ve always been (level-
headed),” Murphy said. “I’ll get fired up sometimes when there’s pressure, but when other people around you are panicking a little bit — it’s just that I’ve always been a setter and the setter’s al-ways been that person to have control over the team. You’re go-ing to touch the ball every play, so you can’t freak out or else every-one around is going to start freak-ing out.”
in. That’s doubtful if Florida re-
ally is running a pro-style system. Let’s put it this way: We think if John Brantley does get pulled for Driskel, it’s because the Gators’ season hopes are dashed and the coaches are looking to 2012.
@PhilipGaryT alks: Will the 
Gator defense be better than last year? Highly recruited youth with one year under their belt...
Well, Philip, first of all we want 
to say we appreciate the energy you bring to asking questions. We can tell it’s very important to you, and you have fun doing it. But to answer your question, improving on last year’s ninth-ranked defense will be quite the challenge. The key stat to watch is turnovers. Florida was just +2 in turnover margin last season and Muschamp has made it clear that forcing giveaways is a major emphasis this season. Hunt-er said Thursday the defense wants three per game.
@fcardillo: How does Jeff 
Demps like his steak?
When he’s not making a quick 
stop at Steak ‘n Shake (everything Jeff Demps does, he does fast), he takes some extra time to make sure his meal is well done. After listening to Muschamp shout “Blood! Blood! Blood!” at the defense all week in practice, Demps is just trying to get away . Since he presumably turned down a lucrative track contract to stay at UF, we can assume he’s passing up the filet mignon. He’s most likely going for a nice flank, since there’s always a chance Mus-champ splits him out wide. Demps was in Eugene, Ore., when he ran his famous 9.96 100-meter dash, so we’ll splash a little duck sauce on there and call it a day.
@ejdelaino: How much has 
student interest in football fallen since the end of the T ebow era? Since a down year last year?
We think interest has not only 
waned since Tebow’s departure, but that it’s part of an ongoing is-sue that goes as far back as the end of the Steve Spurrier era. Of course there was fan energy around the Tebow-led teams, but that can be credited to a bandwagon effect as much as anything. Any college town in America would have sup-ported an offense led by No. 15 and Percy Harvin. But for people who grew up around The Swamp in the 1990s, the electricity and interest among the student body is not even comparable today . The home-field advantage Ben Hill Griffin Stadium provides is dwindling. Mediocre teams don’t help, but it’s tough to tell if even another national title contender could get the student section back to what it once was. 
@AlligatorArmy: Which Gator 
is most likely to avert a hostage crisis?
After a very serious and lengthy 
deliberation among the entire al-ligatorSports staff, we have come to a conclusion on what may be the most important question ever asked in the history of questions.

It wasn’t easy for Annie Speese to pull 
the trigger on her first open look at goal in a Gators uniform.
As the only freshman to start in both of Flor -
ida’s games, the 5-foot-5 midfielder knew she could’ve disturbed the rhythm of the team’s five returning offensive stars, who made up 73 percent of the scoring last season.
 “That’s something that’s kind of hard,” 
Speese said. “Just being a newcomer and still learning the position.”
So she laid back, slipped in deft passes and 
eventually fed a slick assist to senior forward Tahnai Annis on Sunday against FIU to seal the victory for the No. 8 Gators (2-0-0).  At the same time, she won the respect of her new teammates.
“Everyone brings something new to the 
plate and, for Annie, it’s definitely that she’s really suave, she knows the game,” said ju-nior midfielder McKenzie Barney . “She knows when to pass, when to dribble and when to turn. She just has a really keen outlook on things in a soccer perspective.”
Speese’s cautious, controlled approach 
serves as a blueprint for No. 18 Texas A&M (1-1-0), Florida’s opponent today at 5:30 p.m. in the first Tennessee Lady Vols Classic. Riddled early in the season by lingering injuries, the Aggies — much like the Gators — have relied heavily on nine of their freshmen to step in  and contribute. 
But while Florida has been  consistent with 
a pair of 2-0 wins and a shuffle of five new starters, Texas A&M has struggled with its shot selection and offensive discipline.
The talented but mercurial Aggies followed 
an impressive 4-2 win over Fresno State — all four goals scored by three freshmen — with a hapless 1-0 loss against No. 13 UC Irvine, squandering a 21-5 advantage in shots.
Barney said it’s difficult for any team to 
remain consistent in college soccer, but the Gators have figured out a good mix between their young players and veterans this season.
“You just have to forget about what hap-
pened last week,” she said. “We had some great goals.  We’re happy with it, but we have to push it out of our mind and look forward.” 
In preparation for 
tonight’s matchup with Texas A&M and another against an unproven No. 
15 UCLA (1-0-0) side on Sunday , UF coach Becky Burleigh said she wanted her team to do a better job holding possession and dictat-ing the pace of the game through the midfield, where Barney and Speese reside.
“I’m not sure we played the best that we 
can possibly play but that’s probably not nec-essarily a bad thing either, because it gives us a lot to work on in practice,” Burleigh said. “We don’t want to be in postseason form at this time anyway.”

  Sophomore safety Matt Elam is reportedly the leader of the defense 
and will be counted on to ﬁ  ll the void left by Ahmad Black.   
Hunter healthier than ever, mentoring underclassmen on line
as the pain hasn’t kept the quarterback 
from studying the playbook. 
  Hunter taking a leadership role: Omar 
Hunter is an upperclassman on a team ﬁ  lled with young defensive talent, and he’s taking it upon himself to bring the newer players up to speed.   “I’ve been through a lot more things 
than these younger guys have been through,” Hunter said. “Grabbing younger guys, kind of pulling them the right way, I like that.”
  Hunter said Florida’s underclassmen 
have been receptive to his teachings, espe-cially sophomores Sharrif Floyd and Do-minique Easley, who suffered through the hardships of last season.   Easley, who Hunter said was like a little 
brother to him, praised the junior for his ability to persevere through an assortment 
of injuries that have nagged him through-out his career. 
  “I always looked 
up to him because he never, no matter what injury he went through, he never stopped,” Easley said. “He just kept go-ing.”
  Hunter said Thursday he feels healthier 
than ever and is ready to take advantage of 
his new opportunity.
  “Going through all the things I went 
through and this new fresh start, it just 
made me focus more and made me more hungry,” Hunter said.

 Will Muschamp has joked this 
offseason that he is only coaching certain safeties this year: the ones who play well.
  Muschamp won’t have that lux-
ury when it comes to Matt Elam. It seems the sophomore safety’s best assets are uncoachable. 
  Muschamp, himself a former 
safety at Georgia, has talked this week about Elam’s instincts; he simply reads offenses better than anyone else on the team, like a safety savant.
  “You’ve got to have some natu-
ral instincts to play the ball,” Mus-champ said Wednesday . “We can talk about coaching that all the time. Some guys get it; some guys don’t. That’s something that cer-tainly comes very easy to him.”
  Like most members of Florida’s 
2010 recruiting class, Elam stepped onto campus with plenty of hype. The No. 2 safety in the nation, ac-cording to Rivals.com, Elam failed to make an instant impact. He ap-peared in all 13 games last season, but he saw most of his playing time on special teams.
  Of course, Elam had a good ex-cuse: he was sitting behind senior Ahmad Black, who led Florida with 108 tackles and was named a second-team All-American. 
  But since Black’s departure, 
Elam has shown a mix of conﬁ  -dence and humility. During in-terviews, his voice is the quietest among players available to the media. 
When asked last spring which 
player on de-fense hits the hardest, he said he didn’t want to talk about it, though team-
mates later pointed to Elam when asked the same thing.
  “He reminds me of Major 
Wright a lot,” junior Omar Hunter said, comparing Elam to the former Gator who temporarily knocked Oklahoma receiver Manny Johnson out of the 2008 National Champi-onship with a hit on the sidelines.
  At media day earlier this month, 
though, Elam was not shy about calling himself the leader of an in-experienced backﬁ  eld. Others on the team seem to agree.
  “He’s the best thing out there,” defensive tackle Dominique Ea-sley said. “He works hard at ev-erything. Basically , he’s relentless every play. He doesn’t take off not one snap.”
  And the defensive backs will 
need a leader this year. 
  With junior Jeremy Brown re-
covering from a right knee sprain and senior Moses Jenkins’ un-derwhelming track record, all signs point to freshman Marcus Roberson and sophomore Cody Riggs opening the season as the starting corners. 
As for Elam’s back-line mate at 
safety? Josh Evans and Josh Shaw, who have a combined three starts, are battling for playing time.   
  In addition to his instincts, 
Muschamp praised Elam’s accel-eration. 
  “When he sees it and he goes 
and gets it, he’s got that extra gear,” Muschamp said. “He had a play [Tuesday] in scout that he really closed well on. He has some things that, from a coaching standpoint, you’d like to take credit for.”
  Instead, Muschamp will have to 
take credit for the rest of the guys, assuming they play well.
