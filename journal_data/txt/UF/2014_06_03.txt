A bad batch of Spice is believed 
to be the reason 28 people were hos-
pitalized for seizures this weekend, leading to the raid of a local smoke shop and sending Gainesville resi-dents reeling.
Spice is an illegal and highly 
toxic synthetic marijuana that can be bought at convenience stores and smoke shops. 
The rapidly accumulating num-
ber of seizure patients caused the Alachua County Health Department to post on Facebook on Friday warn-ing of the toxic drug. Since then, ACHD has begun an investigation on the chemical components in the batch to see what might have caused the reaction.
“I don’t recall having this num-
ber of cases in such a short amount of time, and that is why the Alachua County Health Department is get-ting involved,” said Paul Myers, Alachua County Health Department director.
Patients admitted to local hospi-
tals had experienced seizures and were in altered mental states. Some of the patients even had to be intu-bated. But not all patients seized. One case that didn’t result in hos-pitalization just involved vomiting and diarrhea.
Between Friday and Saturday, 
the number of cases had jumped from 11 to more than two dozen, and by Monday afternoon the num-ber reached 28.

Starting this Fall, dorm residents might discov-
er their resident assistant is also their new room-
mate.
The Department of Housing and Residence Ed-
ucation will be bunking some RAs with residents because it accepted more housing contracts than there are standard housing spaces.
“Many of the RAs are still unhappy about it, 
but overall there is an understanding on why they did it,” said Paul Buchman, a 20-year-old UF me-chanical engineering junior and a future RA of Tol-bert Hall. He’ll be sharing a room with a resident in the Fall.
Sharon Blansett, assistant to the associate vice 
president for Student Affairs, wrote in an email that the department only accepts as many con-tracts as it anticipates having space for. However, the number of accepted contracts ﬂ  uctuates due to factors such as time of year and amount of antici-pated cancellations.
At the beginning of the application process, po-
tential RAs are made aware that sharing a room with a resident is a possibility. Blansett said RA doubles are a common overﬂ  ow occupancy man-agement technique at many universities.
But Josh Novick, an 18-year-old UF computer 
engineering sophomore, has concerns.
“Usually if you have a problem with your 
roommate you go to the RA, but if your roommate is the RA, then I guess you go to the hall director?” he said. 
Buchman doesn’t anticipate that this situation 
will last very long. A new residence hall is sched-uled to be completed in Fall 2015 and will add more rooms for student housing on campus.RAs might

      For the next two months, there will be 
one fewer fraternity at UF.
The UF Upsilon Phi chapter of Phi 
Gamma Delta Fraternity has been sus-pended through summer, said UF spokes-woman Janine Sikes.
The fraternity is in trouble with the UF 
Student Conduct Committee for multiple counts of hazing, including sleep depri-vation, physical activity and demeaning treatment. 
Sikes said Phi Gamma Delta, also 
known as Fiji, is on conduct probation until the end of next year. Delivered in May, the probation includes various re-strictions and educational sanctions that last until December 2015.
“They’re a dry house through Decem-ber of 2015,” she said. 
The fraternity is suspended until Aug. 
9, but if the brothers violate conduct pro-bation rules during the Fall or Spring, they could be put on suspension again.
While on suspension, Phi Gamma Del-
ta is not recognized as a fraternity at UF.
Former Fiji President Josh Hendricks 
said he is dealing with the conduct com-mittee for incidents that were not his fault.

shark bite to leg FORT LAUDERDALE— A South Florida woman is re-covering after suffering an apparent shark bite in the Intracoastal Waterway off Fort Lauderdale.Broward Health Medical Center officials said 22-year-old Jessica Vaughn was resting comfortably Monday after un-dergoing a two-hour surgery a day earlier.Doctors said Vaughn sustained puncture wounds, as well as an open wound with muscle damage. No blood vessels or nerves were damaged. She is expected to be in a splint for several weeks.Officials said Vaughn was swimming from a boat to an inner tube Sunday when she felt like she was punched in the leg. Vaughn was struck in the face by the fin of what was thought to be a shark.Friends pulled her back into the boat, and Fort Lauderdale Fire-Rescue met them at a nearby dock.

Last defendant in drug ring 
sentenced to 14 years 
WEST PALM BEACH — The last defendant in a 30-person drug ring that spanned from Arizona to Florida has been sentenced to 14 years in pris-on.The U.S. attorney’s office in Miami reported Monday that 31-year-old Jerrick David Bartee was also sentenced to five years of supervised re-lease. Officials said the West Palm Beach man conspired to distribute more than five kilograms of cocaine by the U.S. Mail and other shipping companies.Once the cocaine arrived in South Florida, authorities said members of the organi-zation turned the drugs into crack cocaine to be sold on the streets of Lake Worth.The others named in the conspiracy were arrested in February 2013 and have since been sentenced to prison.

When Lauren Kates was younger, she shot 
arrows at milk jugs with her friends in her 
backyard. Now, she’s going to shoot against some of the best archers in the world. 
She and her teammate Rachel Bouchillon 
are representing UF at the World University Championships in Poland on July 4-6. It is the only big, world event for college archery stu-dents, and Kates and Bouchillon are the ﬁ  rst UF students to make the U.S. team.
“I’m really excited to represent my country 
and my school,” Kates said.  
This is the ﬁ  rst time the two archers have 
tried out for the national university team.Although it was expensive to travel to the 
preliminary trials in South Dakota, both Kates and Bouchillon received scholarships to cover the cost of the trip.   
Kates said that experience showed her 
things that she really needed to work on with her game. 
“The winds were up to 40 miles per hour,” 
she said. “I’d never shot in anything like that before.”  When it’s really windy, Kates said that the 
only thing to do is just hope the arrow hits the target, which was a difﬁ  cult task during the trials. 
“Constantly missing the target bale was 
kind of a shock for me,” Kates said. “That’s not something I do very often.” 
They knew that if they made it on the 
world team, it would be an opportunity they couldn’t pass on. 
“This is my last year at university,” Kates 
said. “I’m hoping it will be a launching point into more higher-level competitions.” 
The girls said that they would like to con-
tinue to compete but also know that archery will always be an important part in both of their lives.“I’m kind of at a crossroads right now 
deciding what I want to do after I graduate (from) the master’s program,” Bouchillon said.
She said she could to go into a biology-
related ﬁ  eld, but she could also take a break from school and see where archery takes her.
“It’s really become a part of what I do out-
side of school that pretty much deﬁ  nes me,” Bouchillion said. 
She shot a little bit when she was younger 
but got addicted to the sport in her freshman year at UF. 
“I just ended up loving it,” Bouchillon said. 
“The more I shot, the more I wanted to shoot, the more I wanted to compete.”Two UF students headed to world collegiate archery match
Fraternity faces educational sanctions
somebody said we did something terrible,” said the 21-year-old UF sport management senior. “I took the fall for the entire chapter.”
Hendricks said he is currently facing two counts of 
hazing, although he said he “got completely screwed over by the Student Conduct Committee” and doesn’t know what the charges he is facing are for.
Public relations director for UF Interfraternity Coun-
cil, Santiago Ramirez, said the IFC currently has no comment on the matter. Brothers of the fraternity did not return multiple calls.
Former Fiji treasurer Jordan Battel assumed the role 
of chapter president after the incident. He also refused to comment on the issue. 
But Fiji is not the only fraternity – or sorority – at UF with a dirty record.
There have been 26 hazing cases within UF Greek 
life since 2000, according to the Dean of Students Of-ﬁ  ce’s website. Suspensions, alcohol prohibitions and ﬁ  nes were common consequences.
Three other Greek organizations are currently ex-
periencing some form of educational sanctions, includ-ing Sigma Nu, Alpha Epsilon Phi and Theta Chi. Such sanctions usually may include alcohol bans or classes related to misbehavior.
In Fiji’s case, the brothers will be required to bring in 
a speaker to talk to members about the emotional, men-tal and physical consequences of hazing, Sikes said.
UF’s hazing policy condemns “any action or situa-
tion that recklessly, by design, or intentionally endan-gers the mental or physical health or safety of a stu-dent.”FRAT , from page 1“The winds were up to 40 miles 
per hour. I’d never shot in anything

Cheap prices, ‘better’ highs lure users
day morning in conjunction with 
the seizures. As of press time, the store has remained closed, and the phone number for the store is dis-connected.
Drug task force members seized 
several pounds of Spice, $2,000 in cash, pipes and a shotgun during the raid, said GPD spokesman Ben Tobias.
Spice has been illegal in Florida 
since March 2012, but distributors skirt the legal issue by changing the chemical composition of the drug and marking it “not for consump-tion.”
“To the outsider, we should just 
be able to look on the package and see that it’s “Spice,” but it unfortu-nately is not that easy,” Tobias said.
While the active ingredient in 
weed, Tetrahydrocannabinol, oc-curs naturally, Spice is typically a collection of herbs sprayed with lab-created cannabinoids.  
“The seizure is more likely 
caused by synthetic cannabinoid, which is not like THC, which is what you get from the cannabis plant,” said Jamie Solen, associate professor in the department of psy-chiatry. 
“The THC you smoke and in-
hale has its own ability to prevent seizures and its own innate ability to prevent the psychosis and delu-sional state” that has been seen in the Spice patients, he said. 
The synthetic cannabinoid can also cause an increase in blood pressure to a hypertensive rate, rapid heart beat almost to the state of a heart attack, hallucinations and vomiting. 
“It really impairs you if you 
smoke too much,” said a UF soph-omore who asked not be named. “Personally, it got me really head high to the point where, if I tried to move, at times I would get a mi-graine.”
Users are drawn to the synthetic 
drug by low prices and the promise of a better high, he said. 
“I only stopped after one of my 
friends had a terrible trip, and I saw what it could do to him,” the 19-year-old said. “I haven’t smoked it since. I don’t ever plan on smoking it again.”

UF students will now be able to access expensive 
programs thanks to the university assuming the 
costs of the former pilot program, UFApps.
UF Information Technology decided to fully 
fund the app that included programs such as Math-cad, SPSS and Microsoft Office indefinitely because of its major success in its pilot stage.
UFApps attracted about 15 percent of the student 
population, or 7,500 unique student visitors, accord-ing to an article by UFIT.
“Pilot program usage numbers were impressive, 
and with more students being part of UF Online and distance learning classes, making these software programs available through UFApps means we are helping the students who are not necessarily in Gainesville,” wrote Tracy Gale, UFIT communica-tions manager, in an email interview.
Instead of trekking to campus to access expen-
sive software in computer labs, students can now use these programs for free on their own computers and mobile devices.
The Serif Design Suite would cost $419.96 be-
fore taxes, according to the suite’s website. This is just one of the 28 applications offered for free by UFApps.
Michelle Licht, a 21-year-old UF economics se-
nior, said she thinks the program is useful for some students, but not all.
“I think it’s hard to get a program that’s useful 
for the tens of thousands of us,” she said.
The program is a hub for math- and science-relat-
ed applications, like Minitab and Matlab, but offers a few applications for non-STEM majors as well.
Kyle Scharps, a 20-year-old UF religion senior, 
said UFApps isn’t very useful for him because he already owns the necessary software for his classes and doesn’t have much use for the other applica-tions.
“The cool amenities aren’t really necessarily per-
tinent to classes I’m taking right now,” he said.UFApps

Gainesville Police arrested a wom-
an early Monday for driving after tak-
ing medication, drinking three bottles of beer and failing a DUI test. 
Police arrested 44-year-old Jennifer 
Butler on charges of driving under the influence and damage to a person or property, according to the police re-port.
Butler was driving a white 1994 
Buick LeSabre with a Florida tag while under the influence of alcohol. 
Butler crashed into the car in front 
of her that was stopped at the traf-fic light while headed westbound on Northwest 39th Avenue, according to the report. Witnesses saw Butler exit-ing her driver’s seat. 
An officer noticed 
Butler was show-ing several signs of impairment, such as bloodshot eyes, con-stricted pupils and droopy eyelids. Her breath also smelled 
like alcohol.
After questioning, Butler said she 
was confused about the accident, claiming the car in front of her didn’t slow down.
The officer said her recollection of events did not make sense.
Butler said she is taking several 
medications including Tramadol, Flex-eril and blood pressure medication. 
Butler said she also drank three 
bottles of Michelob Ultra around 3 p.m.
Butler performed poorly in sobri-
ety exercises where she had difficulty keeping her head still and balancing while listening to instructions. She gave two breath samples of 0.178.
Butler was booked into the Ala-
chua County Jail at about 3 a.m. on Monday. She was released the same day on her own recognizance at about 11:30 a.m.

Amendment 2 Info
The University of Florida’s latest education venture, UF 
Online, may have some formidable competition: Cannabis University of Florida. 
The Jacksonville school hosts seminars on medical marijuana 
and advocates for the passage of Amendment 2 in the upcoming November 2014 Florida general election, which would legalize medical marijuana in the Sunshine State. 
Schools like CUF have been quietly popping up all over the 
state, according to the News-Press, poised to satisfy the state’s potential need for education should Amendment 2 be passed later this year. 
“The motivation is two-fold: compassion and cash,” the 
News-Press reported. “There is a population suffering from ill-nesses waiting to be helped and the opportunity to make money helping them.”
So with the elections on the horizon, entrepreneurs are ex-
cited by the prospect of the medical marijuana industry enter-ing Florida. Dispensaries and growers aren’t the only strings attached with the budding — no pun intended — industry: at-torneys, accountants, processing facilities, labs for quality test-ing, consultants for licensing and zoning and more, the News-Press reported. 
But while so many are eager to capitalize on Amendment 2 
if it’s passed, the question of how medical marijuana would be regulated in Florida remains unanswered. The amendment calls for legalization of full-scale medical marijuana but leaves the de-tails of growth, maintenance and dispensing for the legislature and Florida Department of Health to ﬁ  gure out, according to the Sun Sentinel. 
Quinnipiac University conducted a poll in May and found 
that 88 percent of Floridians supported the amendment, so its passage come November is likely. However, with the issues of cultivation, manufacturing, distribution, prescribing and re-tail sale still up in the air, the legislature and DOH need to do their part in letting Florida know how it intends to implement Amendment 2 once it’s passed. 
Other states have made grave mistakes when it came to le-
galizing marijuana. Mark Kleiman, a professor of public policy at UCLA, argues in Washington Monthly that the current ap-proach to implementing marijuana legalization could open the door to future power struggles between a wealthy cannabis in-dustry and state and national governments. 
Though Kleiman’s argument deals primarily with recreation-
al marijuana and not medical marijuana, which is what Amend-ment 2 deals in, it still stands that Florida voters have no access to information on how cannabis would be regulated in Florida. 
The private sector, clearly, has done a good — maybe too 
good — job of educating voters on what medical marijuana would mean to the Florida economy. But for now, it’s impos-sible for Floridians to make an educated decision on an amend-ment that leaves so much important information in the air. The bill is almost guaranteed to pass, and Scott will likely let it pass without a veto. Florida needs to know what how the Legislature and DOH intend to help speciﬁ  c patients and avoid a California-like free-for-all situation.

Vote or post a message at www.alligator.orgFriday’s question: Do you prefer Canvas 
over Sakai? Today’s question: Would you try spice?Slippery slope: The ins and outs of lube
Saturday morning found me in bed surrounded by 
lube.
Let me back up: A few weeks ago, I found out that 
an online, adult company was offering free personal lubri-cant samples in exchange for reviews of them. I thought, “What the hell?” and  input my information and eagerly awaited the samples.
What type of college student would I be if I said no to 
free samples? Really, this was for science.
Sure, I had used lube before, but it always made me 
feel awkward. Lube is typically associated with postmeno-pausal women who need a little help in the bedroom, and while that may be the future for some of us, it doesn’t have to be the present.
Even though lube can help make any kind of sex more 
pleasurable, it’s often hard for college students, who are the picture of health, vitality and wild sex, to admit that they need extra lubricant. 
And even if you don’t necessarily need it, it still can feel 
a little presumptuous to whip out a bottle. It’s like saying, “We’re doing such crazy stuff that we need lube!”
So, taking advantage of the fact that June is Adult Sex 
Ed month, let’s talk a little bit about the ins and outs (pun intended) of lube. 
The ﬁ  rst lesson: If you’re only using the lube that you 
ﬁ  nd in the grocery store aisle, you’re missing out on a whole world of possibilities. Sure, Astroglide is great, but it’s not winning any awards for most interesting or fun sex accessory.
The great thing about lube is that, just like condoms or 
ice cream ﬂ  avors, there’s one that’s perfect for everybody.  And the great thing about sex shops and the Internet is that you can ﬁ  nd any type you want. 
But let’s start with the basics.Lubricant comes in two main condom-compatible 
types: water-based and silicone-based. I know it’s tempt-ing to raid your pantry and use something like coconut oil, but oil-based lubricant can cause condom breakage if you’re using latex condoms.
Water-based lube is slippery and easy to clean up. It’s a great choice for most 
standard hook ups. Silicone-based lube lasts longer, but it can’t be used with silicone sex toys, and it sometimes leaves stains, so don’t use it on your brand-new sheets. 
Pick a silicone-based lubricant 
if you’re planning on some mar-athon sex or if you’ll be in water 
— think shower sex or a visit to The Estates’ hot tubs. 
Your options go beyond the standard run-of-the-mill 
lubes, too. Do you like recycling and hate products tested on animals? There’s vegan, cruelty-free, USDA-certiﬁ  ed organic lube. Need some help getting excited? Check out an arousal lube, which can enhance feelings with warming or cooling properties.  
Once you’ve settled on the right lube for yourself and 
your partner, here are a few tips:
If you’re using lube with a condom, I recommend split-
ting up the duties so that one partner keeps his or her hands dry. 
The 30 seconds that you’ll spend struggling to open the 
condom wrapper with wet hands makes for one awkward, boner-killing moment. 
Also, a protip: before you put the condom on, put a 
few drops of lube inside it. It’ll increase sensation for the condom wearer, which will lead to a better sexual experi-ence overall. The added lubrication will also reduce fric-tion that might cause the condom to break.
Most importantly, be prepared for the inevitable wet 
spot. Have a plan, whether this means laying out a towel beforehand, changing the sheets immediately after or ﬂ  ip-ping a coin to see who has to lie on it postcoitus.
If you already use lube, good for you! But if you haven’t 
tried it, add it to your sex bucket list. Sure, we live in Flor-ida, but these afternoon thunderstorms don’t have to be the only thing to get you wet.

opinions@alligator.org TUESDAY, JUNE 3, 2014  ALLIGATOR, 7
It seems as though everyone wants 
to be inﬂ  uential. And why not? Our society consecrates those select 
few who can claim to hold inﬂ  uence. Time magazine publishes an annual list of inﬂ  uencers. The online edition of Forbes continues to feature articles that inform the common man on how to spread his inﬂ  uence around the workplace. Those inﬂ  uencers in the public eye take to the speaking circuit to cash in on their success. 
Inﬂ  uencers are the individuals who people de-
sire to be and be around. 
Now the question for any wide-eyed under-
graduate is, “What occupation holds the most inﬂ  u-ence?” The answer that typically gravitates to the top of this list is the elected ofﬁ  cial. However, this could not be further from the truth. 
Let’s be honest: Being a congressman or sena-
tor is not all it’s cracked up to be. For starters, the base pay isn’t as indulgent as one might suspect. Second, there is, of course, the dealing with angry mobs of men in pirate hats and women in green en-vironmentalist T-shirts at each and every town hall meeting. The ﬁ  ctitious citizens of NBC’s “Parks and Recreation” are truer to life than one would hope to expect. And last, most of the time occupied by the average congressman, senator or governor is not time spent governing, but time used to woo politi-cal donors. These perceived inﬂ  uencers are the ones with their hands constantly out in front of them.   
With that in mind, consider the inﬂ  uential factor 
of the elected ofﬁ  cial. It is not all that much. Can you name at least one of your all-powerful senators — there are two of them, remember? Probably not. His or her inﬂ  uence is lost on you. 
Now contemplate this for the moment: Does 
anyone honestly believe that Speaker of the House John Boehner holds more inﬂ  uence than Sean Han-nity, Rush Limbaugh or Bill O’Reilly?    
The members of the “punditariat” of our Fourth 
Estate hold more inﬂ  uence than our elected ofﬁ  -cials. This may not be a bad thing, after all. Anytime the power of those in government can be diluted, I would submit, is a plus. To be fair, when a Rush Limbaugh-like character dilutes that power, some should be concerned. But still, a net plus nonethe-less. 
For the daily politico, would entering into the 
media not be more desirable than entering elected ofﬁ  ce? The source of much punditry pride comes from the fact that commentators deﬁ  antly dare to be wrong. Pundits live and die — but mostly live — on that credo. Does accountability come into play? 
Despite their frequent malpractices, political commentators are incredibly inﬂ  uential. They will still be captain-ing their prime-time cable news show regardless of the administration and party in power of Congress.      
Who, then, is more inﬂ  uential 
than the run-of-the-mill pundit? It is my opinion that the occupation that 
holds political power in the land is the late-night comedic host. Nothing is more powerful and more threatening to those in power than comedy. These entertainers employ their jokes, wit and personas to advocate and, more importantly and humorously, mock the powerful and those disagreeable to them. Because of their entertaining yet informative style, millions of people use these hosts as alternatives to the 24-hour-news-cycle anchor. Note that the particular group that employs these comedians as news arbiters are young people, the future of the country. Instead of berating their audiences, your Jon Stewarts and Stephen Colberts offer a half-hour of laughs that keep on coming. The rat-a-tat-tat of their rapid-ﬁ  re punch lines lead to gold ratings and in turn, ever-growing inﬂ  uence.  
And think about what viewers are laughing 
about. Stewart has dedicated many segments of “The Daily Show” to the not-so-laughable Veteran Affairs scandal. Colbert famously mocked former President George W. Bush to his face when he host-ed the annual White House Correspondents’ Din-ner. Truth can be spoken to power with comedic timing. 
Once a pundit or politico is mocked, it’s hard 
take him or her seriously. Remember how W. Bush was discredited by the populace because of the onslaught of jokes pertaining to his intellect and power? Do those jokes still stick to him and inﬂ  u-ence our image of the former president to this day? You betcha. Sorry, wrong politician. See how those jokes stick?  
It is encouraging to see those who are in politi-
cal power do not always hold all of the inﬂ  uence. When inﬂ  uence is disseminated throughout the population and across occupations, our society beneﬁ  ts from it. Sometimes that inﬂ  uence can come from the star-spangled newsroom or a biweekly columnist. In either situation, when inﬂ  uence is dispersed among rival occupations, our country becomes a more inhabitable and more entertaining place to live.

opinions@alligator.orgI recently read a rather unset-
tling column in the Alligator placing signiﬁ  cant blame on 
Israel for a situation that does not lie in its own hands. 
The Arab exodus began direct-
ly after the announcement of the 
U.N. Partition Plan, when thou-sands of wealthy Arabs ﬂ  ed to neighboring Arab countries. Dur-ing the war, pre-eminent Arab leaders urged Palestinian Arabs to leave their home for “two weeks” until Israel was complete-ly destroyed, at which point they would be able to return. Thou-sands of Palestinians left under this assurance, reinforced by nu-merous Arab leaders.
Whereas Arab countries like 
Syria and Lebanon continue to isolate these refugees and use them as political pawns, Israel has integrated them into society, offering complete citizenship to nearly two million Arabs, who receive full governmental ben-eﬁ  ts and representation. Arabic, like Hebrew, is even an ofﬁ  cial language of Israel. With freedom of religion and speech, as well as women’s and LGBTQ+ rights, Is-raeli Arabs enjoy the highest stan-dard of living of any Arab in the Middle East.
It is important to elucidate the 
difference between Israeli Arabs — who are Israeli citizens — and Palestinians, who are not (nor do they desire to be). Palestinians are Arabs living in the West Bank and Gaza under the Palestinian Authority and are protected by Palestinian security forces. Un-fortunately, Palestinian leader-ship has failed its citizens by not providing them with the same freedoms offered in Israel. The Palestinian Authority’s totalitar-ian government limits free speech and expression and violently discourages political opposition, which propels Palestinians to take extreme positions that make it nearly impossible to reach a com-promise for peace with Israel.
It is not mentioned in the previ-
ous article that more than 850,000 Jewish refugees were expelled from Arab countries in 1948 and after. Thankfully, descendants of these Jewish refugees are nor-malized today because they have been accepted in Israel and other countries. 
Israel is, in fact, the only de-
mocracy in the Middle East. Is-rael’s free press allows anyone to openly criticize the govern-ment, which like all countries, is not perfect. Israel consistently has Arab members seated in its parliament, some of whom hold views that oppose Israel’s very existence. Recognizing dissenting opinion is taken very seriously in Israel, as it is a large component to maintaining the democracy. 
Undoubtedly, the conﬂ  ict en-
suing between Israelis and Pal-estinians is complicated and has resulted in tremendous suffer-ing on both sides. As Americans, we value diversity, freedom and democratic rights and values that are scarce in our world. Israel stands by America, and America should continue to reciprocate the support of its key ally.

Flight paramedic Jesse Blaire, 37, shows off UF Health Shands’ 
new helicopter to Snow Whitman, 6, and her brother, Blaze, 5. 
LOCAL
JACQUELINE ADADI
Alligator Contributing Writer
UF Health Shands Hospital wel-
comed a swanky newcomer to its 
helicopter ﬂ  eet this weekend.
ShandsCair, the critical-care 
transport unit of the hospital, re-vealed the largest, fastest and most advanced civilian aeromedical he-licopter in the Southeast at an open house event on Saturday.
“I think that this was really one 
of the last puzzle pieces to complete our program,” said Staccie Allen, program director of ShandsCair. 
“This signiﬁ  cantly improves our 
ability to go and get patients from farther distances,”she said.
The $12 million Airbus EC155 
will be used to transport patients between hospitals or from the scene of an accident. 
Michael Kelley, program main-
tenance manager, said the EC155 is twice as big and can travel up to 50 mph faster than its predecessor, the Airbus EC135. 
The third addition to the ﬂ  eet 
took two years to build, said Gwen Thomas-Howard, operations man-ager of ShandsCair.
“It was built in France especially 
for us,” Thomas-Howard said. “It’s like building a house.”
Kelley said the new helicopter 
will allow the ﬂ  ight team to carry more equipment and work on two patients, as opposed to one. 
It can also carry more fuel, 
which is a big improvement for night trips.
“In the middle of the night, it’s hard to get fuel,” said Don Irving, lead pilot for ShandsCair. “You have to call somebody and hope that they come out and meet you at 3 o’clock in the morning.”
Now, the team is able to do a 
whole trip without stopping at a hospital or an airport for fuel.
But before the helicopter is 
scheduled to go into service, the pi-lots have to learn how to ﬂ  y it.
Kelley compared the learning 
process for pilots to someone driv-ing an unfamiliar car.
“If you drive it for a couple of 
weeks straight you have it already ﬁ  gured out,” Kelley said.
The previous helicopter will be 
used as a backup once the new heli-copter goes into service on June 11. 
This addition to Shands’ ﬂ  eet is 
one of the ways the hospital is con-tributing to high-level emergency 
care in the area. 
“We’re bringing UF Health to 
the patient now,” Allen said.UF Health gains high-tech helicopter
“In the middle of the night 
it’s hard to get fuel. You 
have to call somebody and 
hope that they come out and 
met you at 3 o’clock in the 
morning.”

Heading into Florida’s first game 
in the Women’s College World Se-
ries Championship Series against Alabama on Monday, Aubree Mu-nro had just two career home runs as a Gator.
That changed in the third inning.Facing a 1-0 count against four-
time All-American Jaclyn Traina, Munro hit a solo shot to left field to open up scoring at ASA Hall of Fame Stadium.
But behind a lights-out perfor-
mance in the circle from Hannah Rogers, that one run was all UF needed as the Gators (54-12) took a 5-0 win over the Crimson Tide (53-12) in Oklahoma City to move one step closer to a national title.
“That’s one of the first pitches 
Traina threw inside and Aubree was on time,” coach Tim Walton said in a midgame interview with ESPN2. “(She) put a good swing on a good pitch.”
Rogers pitched her 12th shutout 
of the season and her sixth in NCAA play en route to her 30th win of the season. The senior right-hander faced two batters above the mini-mum, allowing just four hits and striking out three batters while not allowing a free pass on the night.
Outside of Munro’s home run, 
Florida struggled against Traina through the first four innings, strik-ing out five times and going 0 for 2 with runners in scoring position.
“I don’t mind striking out,” Wal-
ton said, “but when we’ve got run-ners in scoring position, we’re going to have to put better swings on better 
UF one win away from its first title

In the end, Florida (40-22) 
just couldn’t get timely hits 
after stranding 13 on base, and its season came to a wa-terlogged end against North Carolina (35-26) losing 5-3.
For a few minutes in the 
second inning though, base-ball didn’t matter when Tar Heel shortstop Michael Rus-sell took a pitch directly off the left side of his batting hel-met. 
The crack of the plastic 
stunned the 1,855 in atten-dance at McKethan stadium and blood poured out of a gash in Russell’s temple. He was walked to the locker room by trainers with a towel pressed firmly against his head.
After a 15 minute delay, 
Russell was deemed unfit to come back in the game, and Zach Daly took his place. Rus-sell received 13 stitches, but after the game tweeted “Final-ly got my lightning bolt scar #Gryffindor #TheBoyWhoL-ived.”
“It definitely wasn’t easy 
(losing Russell),” UNC right fielder Tyler Ramirez said. “We were pretty disappointed Michael had to exit quickly, but I don’t think it really ef-fected us at all. We wanted to really get it for Michael and get the win. I think we all just really rallied around it.”In the next inning for the 
second day in a row, the Gators had to wait around while Mother Nature dished out her worst, this time to the tune of a three hour and nine-teen minute rain delay. When they returned to the field, it was too long of a wait for start-ing pitcher Bobby Poyner, and left-hander Kirby Snead took the ball with a man on first and second and only one out after play resumed.
“We felt good during the 
rain delay that we were going to start him,” O’Sullivan said. “We talked about if we gave up a run or two that’s fine we still (were) going to have to score if we thought we were going to win.”
The Tar Heels proceeded 
to shell Snead to the tune of four hits and five runs and the Gators went through another post-rain delay nightmare in-ning.Gators eliminated

Game, set, match. The Gators have every-
thing they need in order to advance to the 
next step of their championship taper.
The top-ranked men’s and second-ranked 
women’s teams capped off the NCAA pre-lims in Jacksonville at Hodges Stadium to move on to the finals in Eugene, Ore., which begin next week.
En route to the end of their season, Florida 
rounded up 25 athletes (12 women, 13 men) who qualified for finals in their respective events and will now focus on what matters the most – first place finishes at finals.
“I thought everybody did a great job this 
weekend,” coach Mike Holloway said. “The 
purpose of this meet was to qualify for nationals, to be in the top 12 in each event with the exception of 
a couple of bumps in the road.”
Florida added four women and two men 
on the final roster as junior hurdler Bridgette Owens highlighted the day for the Gators with a personal record of 12.80 seconds in the 100-meter hurdles.
Owens ended up clocking the second-best 
performance in UF history, and also had the second-best mark of all performers at both the east and west preliminary sites.

fying mark, and distance run-ners Cory McGee and Agata Strausa in the 1,500-meter run turned in first and third fin-ishes.
As for the men, both Ed-
die Lovett (110-meter hurdles) and Dedric Dukes (200-meter dash) ended their quarterfinal events with top performances in their respective events.
The Gators will now have a 
week off of competition in or-der to recuperate and prepare themselves for the three-day NCAA finals in Oregon that begin June 11.
Understanding what has 
been accomplished thus far, the mission is far from being completed and the Gators un-derstand that.
“We have a great number of 
qualifiers for nationals, but we can’t rest on our laurels or get complacent,” Holloway said.
“I congratulated the team, 
but we have to get refocused, and that starts Monday. We’ll get back to Gainesville, get back on the track and get back to work.”
After a three hour and fifteen 
minute delay before a pitch was even 
thrown Friday, College of Charleston had three runs and seven hits, bal-looning UF’s aggregate total to 11 hits and eight runs in the 1.2 innings directly following precipitation.
Florida finally broke through to 
score in the seventh, when previously hitless Zack Powers (0-3, three strike-outs) laced a ball to center field for a two-out RBI single. Unfortunately, thanks to the wet grass, shortstop Richie Martin slipped on his way home, and was thrown out by North Carolina to end the inning and the UF threat, a microcosm of the offen-sive frustration the Gators endured in 18 innings of regional play.
The Gators would tack on another in the eighth with a Casey Turgeon RBI single, and center fielder Har-rison Bader was able to get to scor-ing position in the ninth after being hit by a pitch and then taking second on a wild pitch. But they wouldn’t be able to pose a significant threat to the Tar Heels, and just like that, their season came to a screeching halt.
“I’m very proud of this team,” 
O’Sullivan said. “I don’t want these last two games to be a reflection of what this team is about. We accom-plished a lot, and I know in this day and age you’re always judged on how you do in the postseason -- I un-derstand that. But as far as the people in that locker room, and our coaches and our staff, and the people that are involved with our program, we’re gonna be awful proud about what we accomplished this year.”14, ALLIGATOR � TUESDAY, JUNE 3, 2014

Florida clicked in the fifth.
Kelsey Stewart reached on a two-
out bunt single to give Florida its first base runner of the frame. Kirsti Merritt then drove her home with an RBI double down the left-center field gap, and Stephanie Tofft followed suit hitting a first-pitch RBI single to right field to give the Gators a 3-0 lead.
After Rogers surrendered her 
first hit of the game in the fifth in-ning — a leadoff single up the mid-dle by Alabama second baseman Kalia Hunt — UF’s defense quickly took action, forcing a fielder’s choice and ending the frame with a 5-4-3 double play.
Munro tacked on another single 
in the sixth with a two-out bunt, but Taylore Fuller grounded to short-stop for the force out at second.
Stewart hit a leadoff single in 
the top of the seventh to bring her to 100 hits on the season — one shy of Michelle Moultrie’s single sea-son record set in 2011. Merritt then 
laid down a bunt, 
reaching first base on a Traina throwing error while Stewart ad-vanced to third.
After Merritt 
swiped her 15th base of the sea-
son, Tofft ripped a sacrifice fly to left field to score Stewart and advance Merritt to third.
Haeger closed the scoring and 
Traina’s night in the circle with an RBI double to bring home Merritt. Traina surrendered eight hits in 6.1 innings of work — one less than she gave up in her first 21 innings of Women’s College World Series play combined.
Alabama led off the bottom of 
the seventh with a leadoff single, but Florida erased it with its second double play of the night and its fifth since arriving in Oklahoma City for the WCWS. 
With their backs against the 
wall, the Crimson Tide plated back-to-back two-out singles — giving Alabama its first runner in scoring position of the night — but the rally ended when Molly Fichtner ground-ed out to Kathlyn Medina.
The Gators can seal the deal to-
night at 8, and Rogers will look for more of the same success.
“ (I’m) just (going to) keep locat-
ing my pitches,” Rogers said in a postgame interview with ESPN2, “and just keep staying low in the zone and working hard and using my defense.”

ZOOP’S SCOOP
JONATHAN CZUPRYN
Alligator Staff Writer @jczupryn
I thought this wasn’t the standard for 
Florida baseball. 
After the Gators limped out of last year’s 
playoffs with nothing to show but a pair of 
losses, coach Kevin O’Sullivan assured Flori-da’s faithful that a 29-30 record and a NCAA Regional exit were not acceptable under his management.
“To be honest with you, this season is 
not the standard we want at Florida and there’s no rebuilding at Florida,” O’Sullivan said following UF’s 5-4 elimination loss to Valparaiso on June 1, 2013. “I keep hearing that all year long. We’ve got young players but it’s time to grow up. They are not fresh-men anymore.  The game comes down to pitching, de-fense and hitting.”
Well, the play-
ers on the squad matured enough this year to tease the Gator Nation with a possible na-tional championship run. Florida’s 11-win improvement from last season’s team was the best turnaround the program has seen this century.Under O’Sullivan, the Gators earned a 
Southeastern Conference title despite hav-ing the country’s toughest schedule. A 40-21 regular season gave Florida the second-overall seed in the NCAA Tournament and a chance to play the regional round in Gainesville as well.
So how does this season end after a short, 
two-game stint in the NCAA Regional just like it did in 2013? It just doesn’t add up.
O’Sullivan has shown he can lead UF to 
success within the SEC. During his seven years as Florida’s skipper, the Gators have ﬁ  nished at least third in the Eastern Division every year, ﬁ  rst in the division four times and ﬁ  rst in the league three times.However, has he proved that he can be 
the man to bring Florida its ﬁ  rst national championship in program history?
No, no he hasn’t. And O’Sullivan’s state-
ments Saturday didn’t do anything to en-courage me about the future of UF baseball.
“Obviously we did not play up to our 
capabilities the last two games,” O’Sullivan said Saturday. “There’s a lot to be proud of. I’m pleased to have had these guys as our team this year, they worked really hard. I don’t want these last two games to be a re-ﬂ  ection of what they’ve accomplished this year.”
The problem is that every team and every 
coach is judged on what happens during the playoffs. One can’t ignore the failures of the postseason just because the regular season was surprisingly successful. 
The 2007 New England Patriots aren’t re-
membered for winning their ﬁ  rst 18 games. They are remembered for collapsing in the ﬁ  nal one. 
The 2003 Chicago Cubs didn’t want their 
last few games to deﬁ  ne their season either. But after my ﬁ  rst-place Cubbies lost three straight games to the Florida Marlins to lose the NLCS, they deserved to be judged by their playoff exit.
And the same goes with the Gators. I 
know the regular season was unexpectedly pleasant, and I know how hard it is to cap-ture a league title. But Florida’s standard should be national championships in every sport.
If I had been cheering on O’Sullivan and 
the Gators throughout the year, I don’t want to hear this from the coach:
“To be honest with you, I didn’t see it 
coming. I felt very good going into the week-end. It was a weird weekend all together.”
I would want to see answers. I would 
want to see a breakdown on how to avoid heartbreak in the future. I would want to see that this truly is not the standard of Florida baseball.
Throughout these past two years, I 
haven’t seen any answers coming from O’Sullivan. Jeremy Foley didn’t see answers from Pat McMahon and Andy Lopez, the Gators’ last two coaches, and neither lasted more than seven seasons.
What makes O’Sullivan so special?Florida’s postseason struggles signal time for a change

There might not be real football to be 
played until late August, but that doesn’t stop 
news from breaking around the Southeastern Conference. In the past week, SEC football TV schedules were announced, Florida’s 2015 re-cruiting class picked up two commitments and a former Gator national champion announced his return to the Gainesville campus.
SEC on CBS: The 2014 SEC football sched-
ule on CBS was announced last week, which included the annual Florida-Georgia match-up. The Gators and Bulldogs will meet in Jack-sonville on Nov. 1st at 3:30 p.m. This marks the 12th consecutive time the game will air on CBS. Florida will likely be seen again on the network, potentially for its game at Tennessee on Oct. 4 and its date with LSU at home on Oct. 11.
SEC Nation: The new home of the South-
eastern Conference — the SEC Network — will launch a spinoff of ESPN’s “College Game-day” set to air Aug. 28. The show will travel to a different SEC campus each Saturday and will preview the week of games for each team in the conference. The show’s host will be long-time ESPN TV personality Joe Tessitore, who will be joined by analyst Tim Tebow—former Gator great and two-time national champion. The two will be joined by SEC radio host Paul Finebaum and former LSU and NFL star Mar-cus Spears. 
The show will air from Gainesville on Sept. 
13 and from Tuscaloosa for Alabama’s meet-ing with Florida the following week.
Potential Early Signing Date: In Des-
tin, Fla., during the SEC meetings last week, league commissioner Mike Slive addressed the conference’s coaches’ proposal for an early signing date for football recruits. Although Slive was clear that the conference would prefer not to have one, the commissioner an-nounced Wednesday that the proposal would set the early signing date for the Monday after Thanksgiving. 
The proposal will be presented to the Con-
ference Commissioners Association if neces-sary. Recruits would be eligible to sign early only if they had not taken any ofﬁ  cial visits, and they cannot take any ofﬁ  cials after signing their letter of intent.
Recruiting commitments: Florida landed 
two verbal commitments late last week — three-star wide receiver Derrick Dillon and three-star defensive tackle Andrew Ivie. 
Ivie is the younger brother of Joey Ivie, who 
saw action in three of Florida’s last ﬁ  ve games last season at defensive tackle. 
Dillon’s tape shows impressive speed and 
escapability — he can cut up-ﬁ  eld in a hurry, too. Dillon frequented at quarterback during his junior year, which could provide Florida with another option at quarterback, if neces-sary.16, ALLIGATOR � TUESDAY, JUNE 3, 2014

EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. -- The New 
York Giants waived suspended safety Will 
Hill on Monday.Hill, who played at UF from 2008 to 
2010, was suspended by the NFL last week for six games in the upcoming season for violating the league’s substance abuse pol-icy. He missed the opening four games of 2013 while under a similar suspension.
Signed by the Giants as a free agent in 
2012, Hill played in 24 games for the team. He had no starts as a rookie, but made 10 starts last season. In his career, he returned one of his two interceptions for a touch-down and also played on special teams.
A New Jersey native, Hill went undraft-
ed out of Florida in 2012, in part because of off-ﬁ  eld issues. Former Gator waived from New York Giants after suspension
