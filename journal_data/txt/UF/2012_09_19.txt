The Continuum’s garage 
has gone solar.
The UF graduate student, 
faculty and staff housing 
complex received a 250-kilo-watt solar panel system ear-lier this fall from Gainesville Regional Utilities worth about $800,000, said John Wayne Mishoe, an emeritus professor of agricultural and biological engineering, and one of the project’s head en-gineers.
At a ribbon cutting cer-
emony Tuesday morning, Mayor Craig Lowe and rep-resentatives from commu-nity organizations that made the solar system possible spoke from the shelter of the garage’s fourth ﬂ  oor.The project is using the 
facility, located at 425 W. University Ave., to host the panels. Private investors and GRU paid for the materials and installation.
In return, the investors 
will get cash back and GRU will get power through a system called a feed-in tariff, said Patrick Wilber, the busi-ness development manager for Power Production Man-agement.
The Continuum doesn’t 
use the power being har-nessed on its roof.
Instead, the panels con-
vert the sun’s rays into a di-rect current energy, which is then sent to a converter that changes it into a usable, al-ternate current, he said. 
After the conversions, the 
current ﬂ  ows into the GRU power grid.

Like many fans, Jake Sillick and Elizabeth Graham camped 
outside for the best seats in the Stephen C. O’Connell Center, 
road-tripped out-of-state and cheered on the UF men’s basket-ball team for years together — but didn’t meet each other for four years.
“It’s really sad we spent so much time [within] 50 feet [of] 
another and didn’t know each other,” said Graham, a 24-year-old electrical engineering graduate student.
But as of Sept. 12, the Men’s Basketball Rowdies is an ofﬁ  cial 
UF student organization.
Sillick, president and 24-year-old computer and electrical 
engineering sixth-year, said the organization has garnered 40 registered members and about 200 likes on its Facebook page so far. Students can join for free online. 
The group will give input to the University Athletic Asso-
ciation about how to organize the student section.
“We’re trying to make the O’Dome one of the scariest places 
for opponents to play in,” Graham said. “Getting in their heads 
is one of the ways we do that.”
“The student section would shake, and you felt like it would 
detach from the building,” she said.

About 40 volunteer and nonproﬁ  t organi-
zations will set up on the Reitz Union Colon-
nade today in hopes of attracting UF students looking to serve the community.
The UF Center for Leadership and Service’s 
Fall Volunteer Organization Fair will be from 10 a.m. to 2 p.m. today . The event is designed to provide groups with a 
venue where they can dis-tribute information about their projects and offer stu-
dents ways to volunteer, 
according to the center’s website.
Organizations in atten-
dance will include March of Dimes, Partnership for Strong Families, St. Francis House, Civic Me-dia Center and UF Ofﬁ  ce of Sustainability , said Tracey Reeves, director of the Center for Leadership and Service.
The center hopes the fair will raise aware-
ness of volunteer opportunities and help peo-ple learn about social issues in the Gainesville and Alachua County communities, Reeves said. She said she expects about 500 students to stop by.“They’ll learn a little more about life be-
yond campus in Gainesville,” she said. “It opens their eyes to, ‘Oh, hey, there’s more out there than just UF.’”
Chemistry freshman Rachel Powell, 18, 
said she plans to attend today’s fair. She vol-unteered in high school frequently and wants to continue.
“It’s hard because, Lord knows, I can’t be in 
all of them,” she said.

Drunk munchies may take on a new 
meaning Friday.
Fat Daddy’s, a new bar in Midtown, will 
open its doors beneath Munchies 420 Cafe 
for the first time this weekend.
J.D. Chester, owner of Munchies 420 Cafe 
and Fat Daddy’s, said he hopes to add some class to the strip of bars.
“Our motto is clean, cold and loud,” he 
said, grinning.
Chester said the idea to open a bar came 
after the owner of Gator Shop, a Gators-themed retailer that resided in the building for about 30 years, asked Chester if he would 
buy the struggling business’ space.
Because it’s right under Munchies 420 
Cafe, Chester said it seemed like the perfect place to open a bar.
“It’ll be a little more upscale but for a 
college-kid price,” he said.
However, opening the bar took longer 
than expected.
Fat Daddy’s, located at 1702 W. Universi-
ty Ave., was supposed to open this summer, 
but Chester said getting the necessary per -
mits and construction set the grand opening back by a few months.
The lengthy construction helped to com-
pletely transform the retail space, he said.
The windows that once surrounded the 
store are now metallic swirls that change colors with alternating lighting.
Thirteen flat-screen TVs line the all-black 
walls, except for the beer coolers behind the main bar, which are lit in orange.
A staircase leads from the back of the bar 
up to Munchies 420 Cafe, which can serve food to inebriated customers until 4:20 a.m.
But Chester said the most noteworthy 
feature is a daiquiri bar near the staircase. 
It features frozen drink flavors like peach, 
blue razz and the hurricane.
Compared to other Midtown drink pric-
es, Chester said Fat Daddy’s will try to keep 
prices low.
“It will be more expensive than some, but 
cheaper than others,” he said.
This Friday will be the grand opening and 
will include free tastings of 1,800 Coconut 
tequila and Jose Cuervo drink promotions.
Patrick Hacker, a 21-year-old UF me-
chanical engineering junior, said he is glad to see a new bar on the block.
Though he is not a frequent Midtown 
visitor, he said he loves running into all of his friends, but not the crowds.
“I’d like to see more open spaces instead 
of just sweating all the time,” he said.
But he thinks the daiquiris may be just 
the thing to cool him down.“It’s a fresh new thing that no one really 
makes,” Hacker said, “so it should be pretty good.”

A student lay still on a wooden box in the F. W. Buchholz 
High School auditorium. The theater teacher paused his stu-
dents’ practice and looked at the actress.
“I think you should lay her on the table,” said Ted Lewis, 
the theater teacher.
The students paused, looking confused.“The table we still have to build,” he said and laughed.Buchholz is facing a major financial setback going into its 
theater season. The Alachua County School Board gave the drama program a $399 stipend, but the school’s first show is expected to cost between $4,000 and $5,000.
Lewis, the students and their fundraisers have to make up 
the difference.
Aaron Faust, a 17-year-old senior at Buchholz and dual 
enrollment student at Santa Fe College, decided to enroll in a drama class last year and stuck with it.
Faust attended districts last year, and it cost him about $130. 
His mom helped him with the costs, but this year he works as a lifeguard at the YMCA to pay for theater expenses.
He plans to stay at SFC next year to finish his associate’s 
degree then transfer to UF or the University of Central Florida to study anesthesiology.
Buchholz Drama Program is performing the Michael York 
film Three Musketeers for its first of three shows this school 
year.
Lynn Gruman, vice president of the Buchholz Players Boost-
ers, is helping to fundraise and advertise the show.      
Every year, the program struggles to fill the seats and pay 
for supplies, such as stage props and costumes, Gruman said.Lewis said despite theater’s national popularity , funding for 
high school drama programs is sparse.
“We’re still like the stepchild,” he said.
Lewis said he is optimistic about the program, despite hav-
ing five weeks until opening night.  
“A lot of these kids — they love their art,” he said. “That’s 
what keeps a lot of them in class.”
In the past, parents have contributed thousands of dollars 
to help fund costumes, district competitions and state competi-tions, Gruman said.
Target provided a $2,000 grant this year, she said. It bought 
17 new steel swords. This show will include three stage combat scenes, and the students will use steel swords.
Gruman said she hopes businesses will partner with the 
high school because having the arts in high school is essential for students to grow into well-rounded adults.
“Without these programs, our society as a whole will change 
drastically,” she said.High school drama program scraping by despite little funding

One boy watched his friend die. Another met Elvis Presley 
and was never the same. Small-town living felt more like Is-
rael than cosmopolitan Westfield, N.J. did, and the Cold War breathed down the necks of ordinary families.
Growing up in Florida made an impression on writer and 
former UF journalism professor William McKeen. It compelled him to collect stories from people who grew up in the same area.
His newest book, “Homegrown in Florida,” will be released 
next week. It includes stories from Tom Petty, Michael Con-nelly and Carl Hiaasen that explore how living in the Sunshine State impacted them.
“What we have in this book is a collection of stories that 
are often about very small moments in life, but the ones that, 
years later, seem to resonate with the people telling the stories,” McKeen, 57, said.
Two of his own stories are in the book, one of which is about 
living on an Air Force base north of the Florida Keys during the 
Cold War.
McKeen moved to Boston about two years ago, and he’s 
been working on “Homegrown in Florida” for about six years. He said he did not have trouble finding stories to fill it.
“For us and for many , Florida is not just a place people go 
to, it’s where they come from,” McKeen’s website states.
Freelance writer and editor Alisson Clark, 35, was teaching 
at UF with McKeen when he told her about the book. She said she offered to contribute.
Clark wrote about her unhappy childhood move from New 
Jersey to Merritt Island.
There, Clark’s grandmother introduced her to a girl her age 
— an “incredibly awkward” meeting that Clark said shaped her first impressions of her new life.
She said she was terrified and convinced she had moved to another world. After a while, though, she realized Floridian kids weren’t much different from her friends in New Jersey , Clark said.
She grew to appreciate the wildlife and natural beauty of 
Merritt Island.
“Even if you live in the suburbs, you can see a coral snake,” 
she said.
UF faculty member and filmmaker Boaz Dvir, 44, wrote 
about being the only person with an accent in the small town 
of Homosassa. As a child, he moved from Israel to New Jersey , 
just outside of New York City.
“I had an incredible culture shock,” he said. People seemed 
disconnected from each other.
But when Dvir moved to Homosassa at 14, he said he felt 
“ten times” more at home there than in New Jersey . The town was community-oriented with a strong sense of family.
“Everybody knows each other, and I think that essence re-
ally connected me back to Israel,” he said.
McKeen said he hopes “Homegrown in Florida” will in-
spire people to preserve local history by sharing their own childhood memories.
“I think everyone’s got great stories,” he said.UF former journalism professor to publish book of stories
� VOTER REGISTRATION IS 
AVAILABLE AT THE PANEL.
BEATRICE DUPUY
Alligator Contributing Writer
As campaigning continues for the No-
vember elections, women’s issues have tak-
en the spotlight.
At UF, a panel plans to discuss the subject 
— as well as family issues — with students and members of the community at 6:30 p.m. today in Room 180 of the UF Levin College of Law. The panel will consist of UF faculty members and Florida politicians.
The Alachua County League of Women 
V oters and Trysh Travis, associate professor of women’s studies and associate director of the UF Center for Women Studies and Gen-der Research, organized the event.
Topics addressed will include the role 
of gender and sexuality in the election and women’s reproductive rights. The panel will talk about U.S. Senate candidate Todd Akin’s recent comments about rape, accord-ing to a news release.
“I find it frightening that someone whose ideas about reproduction and the violent crime of rape are so out-of-step with real-ity,” Travis said.
In February, Limbaugh called a George-
town University law student a “slut” on air after she declared her support for President Barack Obama’s plan for contraception cov-erage.
Travis said female contraceptives should 
be legal and widely available.
“It is shocking to me that there are people 
in politics today who believe that women’s 
access to legal birth control should be re-
stricted,” Travis said.
Panelist and UF College of Liberal Arts 
and Sciences senior lecturer Lynn Leverty said Limbaugh’s comments were “highly inappropriate” but not unusual for him.
At today’s event, Leverty will speak as an 
expert on women voting.
“Students are rather surprised to find 
out that one of the most significant voting groups is actually older women,” she said.
The Alachua County League of Women 
Voters will register voters at the event.
“I hope the panel will give people bet-
ter information about what’s at stake for the election this fall,” Travis said.UF professors to discuss

U.S. Supreme Court Justice Clarence 
Thomas will speak at UF’s Levin College 
of Law Friday.
The event is part of the Marshall M. 
Criser Distinguished Lecture in Law Se-ries, an ongoing opportunity that gives 
UF law students a chance to talk with prestigious speakers in their field of 
work. Thomas will speak at 10 a.m. in the 
Marcia Whitney Schott Courtyard. Free tickets are available for UF law students, 
faculty and staff, but not the public.
“The opportunity for a law student 
to interact with a Supreme Court justice is very special,” said Dean Robert Jerry. 
“To engage a justice is an opportunity to get insights into the workings of the 
highest court in our nation. This deepens 
our students’ education.”
They can accommodate about 500 
people, Jerry said. With about 1,000 stu-dents enrolled at the law school, he said event attendance had to be rationed. 
Tickets to Thomas’ discussion will be distributed through the law school’s Of-
fice of Student Affairs.
Thomas did not accept payment to 
speak at UF, Jerry said.
He said Thomas spoke at UF once be-
fore, in 2010, and the law school is hon-
ored to host him again. Though the event will be a similar informal 
discussion, the audi-ence is expected to be an entirely new group 
of students.
Four law students 
were selected through 
an application process to moderate the 
event. Third-year students Eric Netcher, Zack Smith and David Maass and first-
year student Lauren Humphries will in-
terview Thomas about working in law.
“It’s a really cool opportunity to ex-
perience the Supreme Court at an inter -
personal level,” said second-year law student Jessie Ervolino, 23. “Interacting 
with the justice really humanizes the 
Court for the students.”UF gets Supreme Court visitor
Panels could last for 25 years
sates The Continuum, builders and other 
investors every month with funds in ex-change for the energy.
The system is under warranty for the 
next 20 years but is expected to last for at least the next 25 years, said Jason S. Gonos, director of Power Production Manage-ment. 
When they are operating, the solar 
panels offset the average energy use of 30 homes, which is about 465,000 pounds of carbon dioxide per year.
One of the major difficulties that came 
from the project was figuring out a way to put flat-laying panels on a parking garage without interfering with normal traffic op-erations.
“It’s a simple idea, but it’s hard to im-
plement,” said Mishoe.
The solution came with the conduits. By installing the tubing vertically, the 
wiring that ran the electricity could be incorporated into the panel’s structural beams, which are placed on the lines be-tween parking spaces.

The Student Senate unanimously 
passed a resolution Tuesday that op-
poses raising roam towing charges in Gainesville.
Roam towing or trespassing rates 
are fees people pay when their cars are towed. The rates are regulated by the city, said Director of External Affairs Billy Vranish.
The resolution, which was authored 
by Vranish and Sen. Sydney Kaplan, asks the Gainesville City Commission to not raise the towing rate until more substantial evidence can justify it.
Rates are $76, and have been since 
1997, according to the resolution. But this summer, towing companies peti-tioned to increase the rate to $100.
The City Commission’s Public Safety 
Committee has reviewed the petition and has reached a 2-to-1 vote recom-mending to raise the rate to $84, Vranish said after the meeting. The City Com-
mission will vote on it Thursday .  
“All we’re asking is the [towing com-
panies] submit financial information,” 
Vranish said.
The Senate also unanimously passed 
a resolution supporting a Florida con-stitutional amendment that would re-place the student representative on the Board of Governors with the chairman 
or chairwoman of the council of state 
university student body presidents. 
Currently, the student representative 
is the chairman of the Florida Student Association.

You don’t have to be a UF student to 
learn in Gainesville.
Mindful Movies, a free film series, 
kicks off 6 p.m. to 8:30 p.m. tonight at 
Alachua County’s Downtown Branch 
Library. Mindful Movies will play docu-
mentaries to create community dialogue about global issues and how they can be addressed locally, press liaison Sarah Thompson said.
“We wanted to show documentaries 
because it’s a way to present the issues initially,” Thompson said. “It’s a power -
ful medium.”
Mindful Movies hopes to attract be-
tween 20 and 100 people who are interest-ed in getting involved in the community.
The library will also screen films Oct. 3, Oct. 17, Oct. 31, Nov. 7, Nov. 28, Dec. 5 and Dec. 19.
Mindful Movies also hopes it will 
serve as “inspiration and motivation” for locals to get involved in solving them, Thompson said.
The movies will deal with a variety 
of issues ranging from the contemporary medical industry to global energy. The criterion to choose the movies is that they help raise awareness, Thompson said.
In addition, Mindful Movies is work-
ing with organizations around Gainesville 
to provide a platform for them to connect with residents.
One of these organizations, Gainesville 
Loves Mountains, is the reason Mindful 
Movies will be playing “The Last Moun-tain” Oct. 17, Thompson said. The group is dedicated to stopping the use of moun-taintop removal mining for coal, an issue 
the movie highlights.
According to Otto Pliel, a representa-
tive at the library’s Downtown Branch, 
the library is providing the space for the event.
“Our library is moving in the direction 
of reaching out into the local community more,” Pliel said.
Also involved is UF’s Office of Sustain-
ability, which program assistant Michael Amish said is helping promote the event.
“It is generating discussion about sus-
tainability in Alachua County, which is important,” he said.Downtown Library to host free film series

After serving about 17 years as dean of 
UF’s College of Pharmacy, William H. Riffee 
will step down this summer.
Riffee and two other Health and Science 
Center deans have announced plans to leave 
their positions in the upcoming year. Kath-
leen Ann Long, of the College of Nursing, and Glen Hoffsis, of the College of Veteri-nary Medicine, will step down. Riffee said he will vacate his position June 30, 2013.
“Since we had several of the deans step-
ping down in Health and Science Center, the vice president thought it would be useful for me to step aside,” Riffee said.
Third-year working professional doctor 
of pharmacy candidate Shane Reilly , 22, said he was surprised to hear Riffee was leaving.
“I didn’t see this coming at all,” Reilly said. 
“He really pushed the College of Pharmacy and has done so much for the college.”
In addition to serving as dean, Riffee 
worked as a UF associate provost for dis-tance, executive and continuing education 
from 2001 to 2006.“I actually started a distance education 
program when I was at the faculty of the 
University of Texas College of Pharmacy,” Riffee said. “I brought that expertise here, so it was a matter of looking at the technology and adjusting the technology to our teaching 
style.”
The UF College of 
Pharmacy includes three 
other campuses in Jack-sonville, Orlando and St. Petersburg. According to a press release, UF’s Work-ing Professional Doctor of Pharmacy program is the 
largest in the nation.
“I will miss the large university atmo-
sphere,” he said. “There are some things 
about a large university atmosphere that I won’t miss — there is a lot of bureaucracy and things that go on with that.”
As for stepping down, Riffee said he’s 
examining his options but has no definite plans.
“I will miss my faculty and students and 
staff,” he said. “They have been remarkable to work with.”UF Pharmacy dean steps down RENEE BENINATE

UF’s 88,548-person shrine to football, 
Ben Hill Griffin Stadium, is one of the saf-
est stadiums in college sports.
The Swamp received a Facility of Merit 
Award from the National Center for Spec-
tator Sports Safety and Security.
The stadium was recognized as a facil-
ity that demonstrates an innovative ap-
proach to enhancing safety and security, according to the organization’s website.  
Other NCAA nominees for the award 
included: Gaylord Family Oklahoma Memorial Stadium at the University of Oklahoma and the High Point Solutions 
Stadium at Rutgers University.
The stadium was chosen for the award 
because it provides a safe and enjoyable 
environment for spectators, said  Maj. Brad Barber, University Police spokes-man.
University Police and the University 
Athletic Association coordinate the more than 250 law enforcement officers and 
support staff members from multiple lo-
cal, state and federal agencies each game.
The impact of about 90,000 fans on 
one facility poses a number of challenges, which are met by a unified force made of UAA, UF and UPD personnel, said Chip Howard, UF’s executive associate athlet-ics director for internal affairs.  
“Many other campuses see our opera-
tion as one they would want to emulate,” he said.
Barber said a well-organized plan 
makes it extremely difficult to cause prob-lems.
University Police also uses a strict cre-
dentialing process for all stadium employ-ees, monitors the stadium with 57 camer -
as and conducts patrols of all areas of the stadium before and after each game.
Barber said he encourages everyone to 
immediately tell law enforcement if they see anything suspicious, so officials can investigate the issue.
“It’s that old expression, ‘If you think 
that something is not right — it’s not right,’” he said. “This will potentially save a significant issue down the road.”Swamp ranked safe, clean

86 TOTAL VOTESRamblin’ Romney 
Comments might get 
him in trouble
Are you part of the 47 percent?
You might not matter to Mitt Romney.
“There are 47 percent of the people who will vote for 
the president no matter what,” Romney said. “All right, there are 47 percent who are with him, who are dependent upon 
government, who believe that they are victims, who believe the 
government has a responsibility to care for them, who believe that they are entitled to health care, to food, to housing, to you name it.”
He claimed that 47 percent of people don’t pay income taxes. 
That’s true. But a lot of times, that ﬁ  gure is misrepresented, and people start to believe that 47 percent of American households don’t pay any taxes at all. That’s not true at all.
His remarks were captured on a secret video ﬁ  lmed at a pri-
vate fundraising dinner in Boca Raton in May.This dinner, by the way, cost about $50,000 a plate to attend.
That secret video of the event has been circulating around 
the Web for a few weeks. In fact, parts have been around since late May, according to a timeline put together by Ben Smith of BuzzFeed.
This week, Mother Jones posted more “snippets” of the vid-
eo, which prompted Romney’s campaign to hold a press confer-ence late Monday.
“By the way , whoever has released the snippets would, I 
would certainly appreciate if they would release the whole tape so we could see all of it,” Romney said.
Mother Jones talked to the video’s owner and released the 
entire 49-minute fundraiser speech Tuesday morning.
Romney’s ﬁ  rst number might be accurate, but it draws too 
many conclusions for the public.
Although two-thirds of the 47 percent don’t pay income tax, 
they do pay payroll tax, according to an article on The Daily 
Beast by Kevin Fallon.
The other one-third of the 47 percent of Americans that Rom-
ney accused of already voting for President Barack Obama in the 
upcoming November elections are elderly or poor. These two demographics either earn nontaxable money from Social Secu-rity or don’t make enough money to be taxed. It also turns out that a lot of those people live in conservative states.
“Of the 10 states with the highest percentage of people who 
pay no income tax, nine are red states,” Fallon said.
While it’s tough to get the full context from a short clip, Moth-
er Jones released the full video, so now we have the full context of what Romney was trying to say.
But he hasn’t backed down, and he hasn’t apologized to the 
47 percent of Americans he has basically ostracized. He stands by what he said: The people who don’t pay income tax are the same people who will automatically vote for Obama.
Do you fall into that category of non-income-tax-paying indi-
viduals? Are you voting for Obama?
Romney thinks so, and he already wrote you off.
This debacle may not do much in the long run to the cam-
paign. We’ll need to keep an eye on the ramiﬁ  cations, but there 
are only a few weeks until Election Day.
YouTube has been ﬂ  ooded with goo-gobs of smear 
ads and “vote for” propaganda in recent weeks, punctuating my latest romp with superhero car-
toons.  I’m not bitter, though.  
I can be a bit apathetic toward all the, “My name is 
blankety-blank, and I approve this message,” but I rec-ognize that something bigger than red and blue push pins is at stake here.  
Hope is on the platform, and people get riled up 
about hope. It got me thinking about a familiar topic that works people into a similar frenzy.
You can smother it with cynicism, test it in the ﬁ  res of 
rationality and nuke it with the latest in scientiﬁ  c devel-opments, but religion just won’t go away.  
It makes sense, if you ask me.Humans are captivated by the notion of the divine, as 
if eternity were written on the hearts of mankind.  
By and large, humanity hopes for a way to touch that 
which is transcendent. Long after we’re all faint memo-ries, people will line up to pledge their spiritual alle-giances, just as they did in ages past. But with so many options, what’s one to do with the game of rock-paper-scissors that religion often becomes?  
I may get myself in trouble with this one.It’s been said that all religions are a pathway up the 
mountain to God. I’m inclined to agree.  My question is: Do they all reach the top?
I’m not playing semantics here. Mankind is constant-
ly seeking to forge a path to God. We’ve got processes and rituals, 30 different ﬂ  avors of each of the major be-lief systems, and it seems that everyone knows what the heck is wrong with us, with wildly different ideas on 
how to make us right again.
If we’re strictly talking morality, we end up dead-
locked in a number of senses.  
Good is the name of the game.  
Excuse the oversimpliﬁ  cation, but Judaism, Islam and 
Christianity largely agree on charity, attitudes toward sexuality and personal ethical choices. Buddhism strives for ultimate enlightenment in nirvana, and Hinduism seeks liberation from karmic cy-cles of rebirth. Personal revela-tion is a focal point throughout these and other spiritualities.  
We’ve got a lot of options 
here, folks.  This mountain must be steep.
I’ll be the ﬁ  rst to admit that 
it all sounds similar, but don’t mistake my intent. I’m not a 
universalist, despite what my musings may suggest.  
I don’t think all religions hit the peak, largely because 
most of them say that “my” effort determines whether I make it.  
Fat chance.  I’ve never known a human who wasn’t prone to fail.  If 
we’re depending on our own goodness and good works to thrust us up the mountain, we are in bad shape.
In the middle of the incessant frustration of climbing 
and falling, I heard a peculiar story about the God of the mountain:
Looking on the futility of human effort, he enacted a 
plan that would end the cycle of failure by revolution-
izing the human heart at its core.  
The insanity of this plan was rivaled only by its com-
passion.  
What do the people do when the God of the mountain 
comes down to the base to carry them up to the top?
My best guess is they let him do it, even if it means 
recognizing that none of their efforts would’ve gotten 
them close.  
This isn’t the paper beats rock or red versus blue fool-
ishness that we’re used to.  
No one’s piddling with ethical codes here.  The man upstairs just dropped an atom bomb and 
has effectively cleared the ﬁ  eld.

Letter to the Editor
In the midst of this political season, I am 
disappointingly struck by the tremen-dous amount of money being spent 
on two presidential campaigns and other federal, state and local campaigns. I be-lieve this saddens not only me, but tens of millions of other Americans. Viewing this 
tremendous amount of money spent by so 
few people seeking political ofﬁ  ces, I feel driven to write this letter.
Considering that most of the salaries 
for these political ofﬁ  ces pale in compari-
son to the money spent to gain these of-
ﬁ  ces, I believe most Americans have taken off their blinders to realize just how much underhandedness and corruption exists in 
all levels of our government. Americans 
are no longer idealistic or faithful about our government ofﬁ  cials being pure and 
willing to go all out to help every citizen, 
regardless of our ﬁ  nancial status. There is no doubt that money buys access to gov-ernment policies. Therefore, campaign contributions are, in actuality, investments 
in rich and powerful peoples’ futures!
Is there any wonder why so many peo-
ple don’t bother to vote? Are my views cynical or truthful?  Can American gov-
ernment at all levels, be guilty of some of the biggest white-collar crimes on Earth? 
Just some questions to ponder during this 
political season.
Timothy ( Tim ) Monroe Bledsoe
resident of North Augusta, S.C.
Earlier this month, President Barack Obama was photo-
graphed doing the Gator chomp at a sports bar in Orlando.
On Monday, Michelle Obama spoke to a packed 
O’Connell Center and did the the chomp.
While many students in Gainesville will appreciate the gesture, 
we cannot let this distract us from the reality that this president is 
a failure.
We cannot support a president who fails to address our nation’s 
most pressing issues.
While national debt rises, this president fails to reduce deﬁ  cits.
While unemployment remains high, this president fails to free 
the private sector of job-killing regulations.
With Medicare and Social Security on the road to solvency , this 
president fails to address reform.
With the tax code rewarding Washington insiders and punish-
ing success, this president fails to lead tax reform.
With a broken immigration system that excludes too many 
talented individuals, this president bypassed Congress and only complicated efforts to reform immigration policy.
With rising powers such as China and Russia spending more 
on their militaries, this president fails to address the automatic de-fense cuts that will go into effect at the beginning of next year.
With consistently high gas prices, this president fails to allow 
expanded exploration and development of America’s abundant oil and natural gas, and instead subsidizes failed technologies.
With government dependence at its highest level in decades, 
this president guts welfare reform by in effect removing the work requirement.
This president’s record is that of repeated failure, but we do not 
have to settle for failure. There is another choice — another future, in which prosperity is not shared by way of government policy but is earned by hard work and determination.
In this future, success is not pun-
ished but rather celebrated. This future can become reality with Mitt Romney as president.
Mitt Romney and Republicans are 
accused of being a party with old ideas inapplicable to today’s 
world.
Is freedom inapplicable? Is liberty out of style? Are work, suc-
cess and security a thing of the past? Is family no longer valued as 
an institution?  Is responsibility no longer a virtue?
The truth is that some principles and values are timeless.We must not forget the sacriﬁ  ce that men and women have 
made to establish and protect these principles and values. With the Constitution as our guide, we must begin to restore our republic before it is too late, before this nation becomes something funda-
mentally different.
After all, we the people face a fundamental choice this Novem-
ber.
Each of us, as individuals, must ask ourselves: What do I want 
America to stand for?
Should America lead as a beacon of hope and prosperity to mil-
lions? Or should we imitate the policies of other nations now suf-
fering debt crises?
Should Americans be protected by laws that guarantee equal 
opportunity? Or should we be a nation of legislated outcome, which deﬁ  es every principle of liberty that once made us great?
Should America rise to meet those malicious powers in the 
world that would destroy our way of life? Or should America low-er its guard and rely on the goodwill of those who have the means to destroy?
These are only a few of the questions you should ask yourself.Seldom do people have the opportunity to choose the future of 
millions, born and unborn, as we will in November.
There is one more question that you should ask yourself.Before you answer, remember the failures of this president, and 
think about your own experience. Think about your own life. It is, after all, your decision.

Speaking OutOn Sept. 11, we remembered the tragic and 
horriﬁ  c event of 11 years ago.  For the ﬁ  rst time, I watched the exact TV footage from 
that dreadful day.  
Every year since 2001, we have taken the time 
to remember that day, to remember those whom we have lost. We had united as a nation, under one 
tragedy that we all could identify with.  
This year, in a new era, more than a decade re-
moved from that day so long ago, it appeared that I 
and so many other students did not acknowledge it as we have in the past.
It seemed, with exception of MSNBC’s direct 
look into that day, that the signiﬁ  cance of its memo-ry was inappropriately lost among its most impact-ed generation.  
While memorial events did occur, I expected that 
the day’s signiﬁ  cance would at least have a notable role in the day’s conversations.
As I crossed campus this Sept. 11 to go to various 
classes and club meetings, the fact that it was the 
anniversary of that day of terror failed to be men-
tioned to the degree most would expect. 
Unlike past years, it appears that those who rec-
ognized the day’s signiﬁ  cance seemed a minority.
As I was watching the uninterrupted footage 
last Tuesday, the commentators were speculating, merely guessing, in the heat of the moment on the impact the event would have on the future course of our nation. 
Initially the role of al-Qaida was mentioned as 
a possibility, and it appeared likely that we would transition from peace to war.
It appeared that the entire nation, regardless of 
political persuasion, in a moment of tragedy, loss and anger, would support an invasion of the Mid-dle East.  
Since then, it appears we have been in a never-
ending state of war.  In light of these devel-
opments, I found it shock-ing and unacceptable that 
we, the children who have 
grown up in the aftermath, failed to properly recog-nize the day’s signiﬁ  cance 
in public forums such as 
classes and meetings.
In light of the death, destruction, heroism and 
courage people exhibited that day, it should not be forgotten.
When the events of this dreadful day barely 
strike conversation on the anniversary, a major is-sue exists. 
Despite many nationally and locally organized 
vigils and memorials, the tragedy should be dis-cussed and recognized so that the level of its se-verity and long-lasting impact in daily life is never forgotten.  
Memorials are lovely and should be maintained 
in the future.
 However, an over-reliance on them on a tragic 
day does not encourage the development of a cul-ture that should not be permitted to make that day 
a blip in our nation’s history.
If this continues, this date will soon be trivial.
The memory of Sept. 11, 2001 and its aftermath 
still affects us to this day and will last long into the future, inﬂ  uencing the path our government takes 
on international and domestic affairs.
Considering the large-scale signiﬁ  cance that the 
attacks left on our once invulnerable nation, it is a 
shame we do not expand our efforts to recognize 
this memory.
We should remember the day like it was last 
year.

Vanilla, orange, chocolate, cher -
ry and coffee. These may sound like 
flavors of gumdrops or lollipops, but they are also varieties of tobac-co, and County Health staff is not 
thrilled about the similarities.
The Alachua County Health De-
partment plans to hold a candy-fla-
vored tobacco task force meeting at 3 p.m. Sept. 27 in its main building.
Health officials said they are 
worried the sweet flavors will draw children to try the products.
But city businesses are worried 
about the task force and the growing anti-flavored-tobacco sentiments, saying they only sell flavored tobac-co to adults, and task forces like this could hurt their business.
“That’s like saying whipped 
cream vodka will make kids drink earlier,” said Lonny Gomez, store clerk at High Tides Tobacco and 
Gifts.  “I don’t think it makes it any 
more appealing.”
The task force meeting was 
spurred by statistics from a 2012 Florida Youth Tobacco Survey re-port, which stated one in six youths in Alachua County have tried fla-vored tobacco.
Marilyn Headley, a county to-bacco prevention specialist for To-bacco Free Florida, said children are more susceptible to health risks with 
flavored tobacco products, such as 
cigars, dip and snus, because they are thought to be less harmful, have intriguing flavors and are relatively cheap.
“With flavors like cookie dough 
and chocolate, most adults are not using this product,” she said. “It lays the groundwork for smoking.”In March, the Gainesville City 
Commission passed a resolution that stated the commission discour -
aged the sale of flavored tobacco because it was being marketed to children through flavoring, accord-ing to Alligator archives.
Gomez disagreed and said he 
always checks his customers’ IDs 
when they come in the door. If they 
are younger than 18, they must leave.
Although the Food and Drug 
Administration banned the sale of clove cigarettes with any flavor other than menthol in 2009, gas sta-tions, convenience stores, some gro-cery stores, liquor stores and smoke 
shops are allowed to sell candy-fla-
vored cigars and smokeless tobacco products.
Gomez said the shop he works 
at sells Djarum in a variety of fruity flavors. Djarum is a brand of thin cigars that resembles cigarettes and comes in packs of 12 instead of the standard 20. He said they used to be 
more popular, but they are not rare 
or difficult to find.
Headley said companies like 
Swisher Sweets and White Owl make similar cigars to Djarum. She said it is interesting to see people who have never experienced the product before smell them, because the aroma is “delicious.”
Headley said the product is not 
as hard as other cigarettes, which is why pre-teens and children are drawn to them.
“They are more affordable,” she 
said. “There’s a less harsh smoke as-sociated with them and less cough-ing.” 8, ALLIGATOR � WEDNESDAY, SEPTEMBER 19, 2012

This year, UF’s oldest pub-
lic relations organization will 
help put on what is regarded 
as the largest student-run pep 
rally in the world.
Although Gator Growl has 
its own public relations team, 
the UF chapter of the Public 
Relations Student Society of America recently proposed to lead the effort to reach out to the local community. This 
project will bring the two or -
ganizations together for the 
first time.
“PRSSA will not only be 
working on stuff that we are not doing already, but the stuff that we wouldn’t be able to do and stuff that would definitely help us sell tickets to the com-
munity, which is such a huge 
point,” said Hannah Swerd-loff, the 2012 UF Homecoming general chair.
The 89th annual Gator 
Growl starts at 7 p.m. Nov. 9 in Ben Hill Griffin Stadium.
PRSSA hopes to get the 
message to the local commu-
nity and high schools, a move Swerdloff said organizers 
hope increases ticket sales by between 800 to 1,000. 
Though the specific promo-
tion plan is not yet established, the relationship between the two organizations is one that 
can grow, she said.
Jacqueline Bond, presi-
dent of UF’s PRSSA chapter, 
said her group wants more high school students to attend 
Gator Growl and Homecoming 
so they can experience what it 
means to be in the Gator 
Nation.
“We will 
be reaching 
out to differ -
ent admin-istrators of 
each high 
school in the local area,” Bond said.
PRSSA will also use social 
media to get people involved, said Sarah Sullivan, vice presi-dent of member services.
“We try to integrate mul-
tiple organizations to work to-gether,” Bond said.
The two groups said their 
partnership is a mutually ben-
eficial opportunity.
“They do stuff for clients in 
Gainesville, but they don’t re-
ally do stuff for any student or -
ganizations,” Swerdloff said.She said Gator Growl does 
not have enough time or man-power to cover high schools 
and the local community. 
PRSSA’s assistance will allow them to use powerful and ef-fective public relations tools 
that Gator Growl would not 
otherwise have.
By bringing Gator Growl 
to the community’s attention, PRSSA hopes to enhance its 
own recognition and attract 
more members and potential clients.
“A lot of PRSSA members 
don’t really have a specific job, so by working with us, there is a whole other section of people that can work on this. Almost probably a whole chapter 
could be working on this,” 
Swerdloff said.
PRSSA’s Fall open house 
brought in about 200 students 
to participate. 
Providing members with 
professional experiences is 
one of PRSSA’s main goals this year.
“Gator Growl is a good 
way for us to give back to the university,” said Rainer de Sousa, the vice president of 
PRSSA chapter development.

Laura Sjoberg once saw a transgendered per-
son being harassed by airport security and knew 
she wanted to stop it from happening again.
“To get people to understand discrimination, 
they have to understand privilege,” she said.
Sjoberg, an associate professor of political 
science, was one of two panelists who led “Poli-tics of Privilege,” an intimate discussion with 15 people held in the Atrium at Ustler Hall Tues-day night. The discussion was sponsored by UF LGBT Affairs and co-sponsored by the UF Cen-ter for Women’s Studies and Gender Research.
Esther Tebbe, a 25-year-old UF counseling 
psychology graduate student, was the other speaker on the panel. Her research includes transgender issues, including career decision-making, aspects of discrimination and the tran-sition process.Tebbe and Sjoberg dug into the root of trans-
gender discrimination and topics of cisgender privilege, biphobia and transphobia with the panel.
“Everyone has a degree of unfamiliarity,” 
Sjoberg said. “And everyone deals with unfa-miliarity in a different way.”
LGBT Affairs intern Marla Munro said the 
discussion has no connection to the hate crime committed against a UF law professor last week. She said every group within Diversity and Mul-ticultural Affairs will host a discussion about privilege this semester.
“This is about starting conversations of look-
ing toward the future, evoking change in our own lives and discussion in the community,” Munro said.
Psychology senior Logan Stallings, 21, said he 
is happy there was dialogue in the discussion.
“We not just looked outwardly, but inward-
ly,” Stallings said.Panel discusses gender issues

All Eyes on the Gators
Florida’s 37-20 win against Tennessee on Saturday was 
the weekend’s most watched college football game, as the ESPN broadcast drew 5,076,000 total viewers. Macedo Wins SEC Award
Julie Macedo was named the Southeastern Conference Women’s Freshman Runner of the Week on Tuesday. Macedo ﬁ  nished third out of 157 runners in the ﬁ  rst 5K race of her collegiate career on Saturday.Taylor Unroe was named SEC Defensive Player of the Week for her strong play in two weekend wins. See story, page 15.   JOSH JURNOVOY
 Alligator Staff Writer
 
  Frankie Hammond Jr. didn’t want to 
take credit for one of Florida’s most excit-
ing plays this season.
  He easily could have, considering it was 
he who turned a short curl route into a 75-
yard touchdown in the fourth quarter of 
the Gators’ 37-20 win against Tennessee on 
Saturday.
  “Blocks and just a lot of open ﬁ  eld,” 
Hammond said of what made the play work. “I turned around and guys were get-
ting downﬁ  eld throwing blocks for me. I 
just ran for the green grass.”
  After catching the pass from quarter-
back Jeff Driskel near the right hash mark, 
Hammond cut through the middle of the 
ﬁ  eld.
He ran untouched until he reached the 
25-yard line, where he cut back and made 
Volunteers defensive back Brian Randolph 
miss. 
The closest of the last three pursuing 
defenders, cornerback Marsalis Teague, 
was taken out by wide receiver Quinton 
Dunbar, freeing Hammond to stroll into 
the end zone.Brett Le Blanc / Alligator Staff

Blocking key 
difference in 
UF’s success    ADAM LICHTENSTEIN
 Alligator Writer
 
  The Gators have 10 fresh-
men, but you wouldn’t know 
it from asking the players.
  “I don’t really see a dif-
ference in classes,” junior de-fender Maggie Rodgers said. “It’s not just like seniors hang 
out with seniors, freshmen 
hang out with freshmen.”
  Florida’s freshmen saw  
substantial playing time last weekend in their ﬁ  rst set of 
Southeastern Conference 
games.
  Claire Falknor picked up 
her ﬁ  rst start in three weeks 
against Auburn on Sunday.
  She was the lone bright 
spot in UF’s opening match 
against Miami on Aug. 17, scoring Florida’s only goal in 
a 4-1 loss. 
  But since scoring against 
the Hurricanes, Falknor has not recorded any points and 
has only started in two of seven games.
  During her ﬁ  rst year 
with the Gators, Falknor has found a valuable role model in senior Erika Tymrak.
  “She’s such a great play-
er,” Falknor said. “She really helps me with transition-ing to the team and feeling comfortable. I don’t know. I 
just look up to her and take 
notes.” 
  Falknor said she’s learned 
a lot from Tymrak, including 
how to better position her-
self and receive the ball. She also praised Tymrak’s abil-
ity to cre-ate plays 
and make 
defenders 
miss.
  “She takes people on,” Fal-
knor said. “She just weaves through people like they’re nothing.”
  Tymrak compared herself 
to Falknor and said the two 
have developed chemistry 
while playing and practicing together.
  “Claire has the same type 
of mindset that I have,” Tymrak said. “She’s a very quick player and likes taking people on.”
  “When I’m dribbling at 
the back line, she’ll make these runs where she’ll check out and then check back in, and it’s basically my favorite 
ball to play. … I can tell as Freshmen ﬁ  t in like 
veterans for Florida

THE ADAM BOMB
  In a quarterback-driven sport, 
Florida has two guys capable of playing under center. 
For six months, players and 
coaches raved about Jeff Driskel 
and Jacoby Brissett. Driskel won the job, and now it’s time the Gators act like it.
  Coach Will Muschamp named 
Driskel the starter on Sept. 3 fol-
lowing a Week 1 win against Bowling Green.
  Florida won its next two match-
ups, road conference games, and is No. 14 in the nation with the reigning Southeastern Confer-ence Offensive Player of the Week in Driskel.  Yet, there’s still an elephant in 
the room — Jacoby Brissett.
  Muschamp has mentioned the 
backup quarterback’s name in each of his three Monday press conferences since Driskel took the 
starting job.
  Listen to the players and 
you’d think the quarterbacks are 
the same person. Brissett brings 
the pocket presence, and Driskel 
brings the running, but they’re equal.
  “They were playing that well, 
both of them,” receiver Frankie 
Hammond Jr. said on Monday 
about the quarterback compe-tition. “I’m pretty sure when [Brissett] w o u l d c o m e 
in, there 
wouldn’t be a drop-off.”
  Right  
now, Bris-
sett isn’t going anywhere, and he has the best job on the football ﬁ  eld — besides punter, of course.
  Brissett, as the backup quar-
terback, is the fan favorite, espe-cially when the starter can’t get the job done. 
  Judging by the ﬁ  rst three weeks, Driskel is exactly what the Gators need at the position and doesn’t ﬁ  gure to be slowing down 
anytime soon. He’s a player who 
makes plays with his feet and hides an underperforming offen-sive line.
  Driskel’s time is now, but 
where does that leave Brissett?
  Not in the quarterback equa-
tion.
  With No. 6 at the helm and 
playing like he has, Brissett won’t see the ﬁ  eld unless Driskel suffers an injury.
  That isn’t deterring the Palm 
Beach Gardens Dwyer High prod-uct and hand-picked Charlie Weis recruit from challenging Driskel, the former top-ranked prep quar-
terback. And it didn’t keep Bris-
sett from choosing Florida instead of Miami, the school his mother wanted him to attend.
  “When I committed here I 
knew it was going to be a race be-tween me and him,” Brissett said on Aug. 28. 
“You can’t ﬁ  ght it. That’s where 
you’ve got to strive and thrive to be the best. Competition brings out the best in everyone and that’s what’s happening now.”
Driskel’s the guy, Gators must put Brissett talk to bed

were getting downﬁ  eld throwing 
blocks for me. I just ran for the 
green grass.”

UF wide receiver 
SEE ADAM, PAGE 14With the competition all but 
over, Brissett and his 6-foot-4 
frame loom large on the side-
lines.
I can’t blame the coaching staff 
for making sure he gets the atten-
tion he deserves. 
The scrambling Driskel is a 
pop to the shoulder waiting to happen.
Even though the Volunteers 
didn’t sack Driskel, defenders 
have dropped the quarterback 
nine times, the most in the  South-eastern Conference.
At some point, though, the ca-
tering to has to stop.
It may be premature, but Flor -
ida has an issue going forward. Driskel is the clear guy primed to bring Florida back to national 
relevance, but the Gators have a 
quarterback who is apparently just as talented on the bench. 
This isn’t a bad problem, ei-ther. Just one that needs to be 
handled correctly.
From talking to Brissett, he 
seems like the kind of kid who 
wants to continue pushing Driskel for the job, and he deserves credit 
for his demeanor. He’s the type of 
football player Muschamp wants on his team.
But at what point do you let a 
kid go find a job somewhere else? 
Florida got burned for picking 
one quarterback over another in the past. While Auburn received Cam Newton thanks to a stolen 
computer, the Gators found them-
selves stuck with John Brantley.
That likely won’t be the case 
between these two, but the solu-
tion in this situation is to let Bris-
sett transfer.
Brissett deserves a chance to 
start a full season, but that chance doesn’t  look like it will come as 
a Gator. 
Contact Adam Pincus at apin-
cus@alligator.org.Through three games, the Florida 
offense has looked more explosive than it 
did last year, and the team is quick to credit 
improved blocking for the big plays.
Hammond showed his appreciation for 
his fellow receiver by posting a picture of 
Dunbar’s block on Twitter on Sunday.
“If somebody scores a play two yards or 
100 yards, it really wouldn’t make a differ -
ence because it’s not just me that made that 
play,” Hammond said. “There’s a lot of guys. 
Like I said, Driskel picking up the protection, 
guys blocking down the field. It takes all 11 
of us to be on the same page to get the job 
done. I scored the touchdown, but 10 other 
guys helped me do it.”
In addition to praising the blockers, offen-
sive coordinator Brent Pease credited Ham-
mond’s individual effort 
on the long touchdown.
“He had open space, 
took advantage and got the ball vertical. I mean, 
he did what a receiver is 
supposed to do,” Pease 
said. “Once you develop 
that motor habit, you get 
good at it.”
Pease said most long plays are a result of 
a total group effort between the blockers and the ball carrier. He added that all of Florida’s 
skill position players made a commitment to 
improve their blocking. The players realized 
that if they are unselfish when someone else 
has the ball, those players will be more likely 
to return the favor. 
The improvement was evident on Ham-
mond’s touchdown against Tennessee. He had a similar 50-yard touchdown in the 
opener against Bowling Green but had to do 
a lot more of the work himself. Dunbar and 
Omarius Hines caught up to the play in the 
red zone but failed to pick up blocks.
For a player to be a solid downfield block-
er, Pease said he simply has to put in the ef-
fort, which is 90 percent of the equation. Only the other 10 percent is natural ability.
“Everybody has the ability to do it,” Pease 
said. “You’ve got to kind of have the drive to 
do it, and they do.”
Right tackle Kyle Koehne, who started 
Saturday in place of the injured Chaz Green, 
was encouraged by what he saw out of the 
receivers’ blocking.
“It just shows that it’s kind of more of a 
team thing this year,” Koehne said. “Every-one is trying to help each other out. I think 
it’s a really good sign for us.”

Defenders Brooke Smith and 
Christen Westphal also played 
significant minutes last weekend.
Smith received substantial ac-
tion for the first time in her col-lege career against Kentucky on Friday,  totaling 60 minutes of playing time on the weekend.
“Finally being out there and 
just in the moment, I just took it all in, did what I could, and I’m looking forward to work-
ing harder and hopefully getting 
more minutes,” Smith said. 
Westphal has seen the most 
playing time of the freshman class. She played every minute of 
both matches this past weekend 
and has started in seven of the Gators’ eight games.
“Both of them are great play-
ers,” senior midfielder Holly King said. “For freshmen, again, to step in is a huge factor, and it’s a hard thing to do. I think they’ve done really well.”
When the team isn’t on the 
field, the freshmen and upper -
classmen still spend a lot of time together, whether they’re talking between classes, eating dinner together or having a scary movie 
night.
“We’re pretty much always 
together,” King said. “We don’t 
really go our separate ways.”
Coach Becky Burleigh said the 
relationship between the fresh-men and upperclassmen is ter -
rific. 
“What I like the most about 
them is they’ve been very little drama,” Burleigh said. “I think it’s been a very easy transition.” JONATHAN CZUPRYN

For the second time in two 
weeks, Florida hauled in a South-
eastern Conference weekly award through the work of an underclass-man.
Sophomore libero Taylor Un-
roe was named the SEC Defensive Player of the Week on Monday after her performances against Arkansas and No. 24 Kentucky during the weekend. Freshman outside hitter Ziva Recek was named SEC Fresh-man of the Week on Sept. 4. 
Associate head coach Dave Boos 
said Unroe’s presence during the Gators’ first two SEC matches was critical to Florida’s 2-0 start in the league. He said her play against Kentucky impressed him most.
“We outdefended them . . . high-
lighted by Taylor Unroe,” he said. “She probably had her best match this year defensively. Really good 
stuff for us out there. For us to be 
the champ at the end of this whole thing, we have to play better de-fense. And Sunday was an indica-tion that we’re on that path.”
Unroe’s weekend began with a 
career day against the Razorbacks in Fayetteville, Ark., on Friday. In Florida’s only five-set match this year, Unroe registered a career-high 24 digs and five assists to help 
the Gators earn their 22nd straight 
victory in an SEC opener. 
She added 17 digs against Ken-
tucky to bring her weekend total to 41. Unroe’s 5.13 digs per set on Florida’s SEC road trip raised her average digs per set on the season by .21 digs, to 4.43.
After her record-setting week-
end, Unroe has the fourth-most digs per set in the SEC, even though Florida ranks last in the conference and 256th in the nation in that cat-egory. 
Coach Mary Wise said her squad 
needs Unroe to remain the anchor for the defense as the rest of the back line continues to struggle. Af-
ter Friday’s 3-2 win against Arkan-sas, Wise said the Gators counted 
on Unroe’s defense.
“It was a match that there’s no 
way we can win if we didn’t dig balls and Taylor stepped in and made some great digs,” Wise said. “She took care of the routine ones, and yet I would tell you that there’s six or seven that she would say, ‘I 
should have those.’ That’s the evo-
lution of Taylor now in her second season.”
Unroe’s SEC Defensive Player of 
the Week award was the first such honor for the Gators since middle blocker Cassandra Anderson won it as a junior on Nov. 1, 2010.
Last year, as a freshman, Unroe 
earned SEC Freshman of the Week honors. She is the first Gator to earn both awards since Elyse Cusack won Freshman of the Week twice in 2006 and Defensive Player of the Week four times, the last coming in 2009.
Wise said her team continues to 
needs similar performances from 
Unroe whenever the Gators go on the road. She said the outcome of 
the game depends on how Unroe plays. “You don’t win without your 
libero playing well,” she said. “It just doesn’t happen.”WEDNESDAY, SEPTEMBER 19, 2012 � ALLIGATOR, 15

Senior Isabelle Lendl 
earned the first outright win 
of her career on Tuesday at 
the Dale McNamara Invita-
tional, bringing her score-card for the tournament to a 210 (-6). 
Lendl entered the final 
round with a two-stroke lead and shot even par for the day to finish atop the individual leaderboard. 
“I am extremely proud of 
Isabelle,” coach Emily Bastel said. 
“She was disappointed 
with the way she finished last week, but was determined to not let this one get away. She handled her nerves extreme-ly well down the stretch.”
The No. 9 Gators closed 
out Tuesday’s final round at Broken Arrow, Okla., in second place, three strokes 
behind Arizona State.
Florida shot a 293 (+5) in 
the final round of play. The 
Gators concluded the tour -
nament with a total score of 
869 (+5) but could not mus-
ter enough shots late in the round to supplant ASU, who carded an 866 (+2). 
“We had some opportuni-
ties to pass ASU today that we didn’t capitalize on,” Bastel said. 
“But overall, I am pleased 
with the tournament and what we accomplished. We should take a lot of positives from this tournament and 
learn a lot as well.” Sophomore Camilla Hed-
berg carded two birdies 
during her final round and capped Day 2 with a 76 (+4). 
She finished par for the 
tournament with a score of 216 (E). Hedberg finished 
sixth individually, despite 
double bogeys on holes nine and 13.
After a dismal first two 
rounds, senior Mia Piccio finished the final day with the strongest performance of any Gator. 
P i c c i o 
carded a 71 (-1) to give her a three-round score 
of 219 (+3). 
Piccio birdied on three oc-
casions after bogeying twice through four holes.
Sophomore Anna Young 
finished 29th on the individ-ual leaderboards after shoot-ing a modest 74 (+2) in the final round of play. 
Her total from Day 3 
marked her best round as a Gator. Young shot a 225 (+9), a nine-stroke improvement 
from last week’s Cougar 
Classic. 
Freshman Ursa Orehek 
finished her final round with a 77 (+5), which brought 
her tournament total to 232 
(+16).
 She tied for 50th. The Gators will take the 
course again on Oct. 12 for 
the Tar Heel Invitational in 
Chapel Hill, N.C., as they look to claim their second victory of the season.Lendl notches first win

Florida has averaged 49 points per game 
in its last five games against Kentucky. Earli-
er this summer, offensive coordinator Brent 
Pease wanted to hit the half-century mark against the Wildcats in 2012.
Pease told fans at a late July visit to the 
Ocala Gator Club that he wanted “to score 
50 points” against UK in 2012, according to The Gainesville Sun.
On Tuesday, he said the game was not 
personal.“I had fun,” Pease said of his meeting with 
boosters. “I was responding to a question. And you know, that’s nothing personal.”
Pease’s comments in Ocala were in re-
sponse to criticism he received from former Kentucky quarterback Jared Lorenzen. Pease 
served as the Wildcats’ offensive coordina-
tor and quarterbacks coach from 2001-02 — Lorenzen’s sophomore and junior seasons.
When coach Will Muschamp hired Pease 
to replace departing offensive coordinator Charlie Weis, Lorenzen lampooned the hire on Twitter.
“Seriously Brent Pease at Florida?” 
Lorenzen said via Twitter on Jan. 6. “He’s 
freaking crazy and was brutal at UK when I 
was there. Won’t be able to handle it andwill (sic) be run out!”
Lorenzen also posted on Twitter that 
Pease is stubborn and does not do well with second-half adjustments. When asked about the comments, Pease brushed them off.
“It’s free speech America,” he said.Despite his coaching experience with the 
Wildcats, facing them is nothing special. He still has friends in Lexington, Ky., but his ties with UK end there.
“It’s another game,” Pease said. “I got a 
lot of respect for that place because I worked there, and I really love Lexington.”
Wildcat challenges defenses: Even if Flor -
ida’s wildcat package never results in an-
other touchdown, the problems it generates 
for opposing defenses make it a valuable ad-dition.
Trey Burton scored on touchdown runs 
of 14 and 80 yards out of the wildcat look against Tennessee on Saturday, giving fu-ture opponents something extra to scout as they prepare for UF.
“It forces the defense to play a differ -
ent hand, make different calls,” Pease said. “There’s ways of defending it, but you’ve got to have some answers to it, and some-where along the line they’ll probably have some things that we’re not prepared for that 
they can defend it with.”
Pease said he has made a point of install-
ing some type of wildcat package with every 
team he has coached. Even with All-Ameri-can quarterback Kellen Moore at Boise State, 
Pease installed a wildcat package with direct 
snaps to running back Doug Martin.
UF safety Josh Evans said opponents who 
use wildcat packages force Florida’s defense 
to make special preparations during the 
week prior  to the game.
“We work on it a lot,” Evans said. “We 
have little periods when we do wildcat. … We had to definitely work on teams that 
were in the wildcat and getting adjusted.”
Koehne gets involved: Because Florida’s of-
fensive line lacks depth, junior Kyle Koeh-
ne’s ability to play all five positions is ex-
tremely valuable.
After rotating mostly on the interior and 
making his first career start at left guard against Furman last season, Koehne made 
his first start at right tackle on Saturday 
against Tennessee.
“Out of the past four years that I’ve been 
here, there hasn’t been anybody that goes 
around the line like I do,” Koehne said. “It’s 
been a good experience. It helps with my versatility and my mindset is just, ‘If I can play, put me in wherever.’ Learning each position has been a good opportunity and 
has helped me understand the offense as a 
whole. I think that’s only benefitted me.”
Koehne said moving between multiple 
positions was confusing at times last season 
but has become easier as he has developed a 
better idea of the team’s offensive concepts. He added that his comfort level at guard is still highest because of his extensive experi-ence there last season, but his work primar -
ily at tackle the past few weeks has helped him settle in at that position.
