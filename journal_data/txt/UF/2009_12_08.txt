UF ADMINISTRATION
Grad students to
protest Reitz fee
By ELIZABETH BEHRMAN
Alligator Contributing Writer
Before the UF Board of Trustees,
the university's highest governing
body, decides whether to approve a
new student fee supporting the ex-
pansion and renovation of the Reitz
Union, the graduate students are
going to have their say.
Members of Graduate Assis-
tants United, a union that repre-
sents UF's graduate assistants, are
planning to speak at the Board of
Trustees meeting Friday. They will
protest the addition of another fee
to a growing list of student fees.
Regina Martin, co-president of
GAU, said an e-mail was sent out
last week to more than 4,000 gradu-
ate assistants, encouraging them to
come to the meeting."The reason graduate stu-
dents are taking the lead
in this is that we don't have
Bright Futures. We pay all
our fees."

"The reason graduate students
are taking the lead in this is that we
don't have Bright Futures," Martin
said. "We pay all our fees."
Martin said the Reitz Union fee
would include a flat fee of $20 plus
an additional fee for each credit
hour the student is registered to
take.

Residents of Northeast Seventh
Street will see a bit of a change
during the next week as "Extreme
Makeover: Home Edition" takes
over the small neighborhood.
"Extreme Makeover: Home Edi-
tion," an ABC show that builds
a home for a needy family in one
week, chose the Wagstaff family, of
1415 NE Seventh St., as its project.
Tobin and Jill Wagstaff and their
four children -Dallas, 5; Rudy,
6; Tobin James, 7; and Jolene, 4 -
found out Monday morning that
they had been selected.
"Well we really are pretty sur-
prised by all this," said Tobin Wag-
staff, 29, during a press conference.
"We're definitely thankful for this
opportunity, and we appreciate ev-
erybody and their help."
The family runs a nonprofit mu-sic school called Studio Percussion
Inc., which teaches students of all
ages how to play the drums and
percussion instruments.
But the school can only pay one
salary, and Jill took a job as a pre-
school teacher to make ends meet.
"We're at the beginning of some-
thing that's going
W to change our
life, and I don't
know how you
can begin to put
that into words,"
Tobin said.

Pennington said there isn't
much they will
miss about their home, which was
built in 1956, except the memories
they made.
As far as expectations for their
new home, the Wagstaffs hope for

0 GROSSE REMEMBERED
FOR HER COMPASSION.
By CAROLYN TILLO
Alligator Writer
Samantha Grosse's story can
be told through the sound of her
infectious laugh, the sight of her
vibrant smile and the strength of
her spirit.
The 22-year-old telecommuni-
cations senior, who died Nov. 30
from cystic fibrosis, cracked jokes
with classmates, served as a fos-
ter parent for animals and raisedawareness for the disease that
slowly took her life.
A group of about 230 people
including sorority sisters, family
members and friends gathered on
the lawn of the Alpha Omicron Pi
Sorority house to remember Sam.

News looked on, holdingN_____lit candles. Soror-
ity sisters and class-
mates spoke about Sam's sense of
humor and compassion.
Meredith Hollister, a UF engi-
neering senior, described meeting
Sam for the first time, saying she
heard Sam's laugh before she sawher.
Hollister said Sam knew how
to live each day to the fullest.
UF alumnus Itay Bengal said
he was Sam's study buddy. He
said it was easy to feel comfort-
able around her.
"I never met a person who was
able to put the needs of others be-
fore her own like she did," Bengal
said.
Kathleen Hoy, Sam's mom,
said Sam was a spunky child who
could hail a cab in New York City

corded for home movies.

STUDENT LIFE
UF grad writes Gators song
By JOHN J. BOOTHE
Alligator Contributing Writer
When Will Albury raps, he doesn't talk
about having loads of cash or driving lavish
cars -he represents the orange and blue.
Albury, known as Gemini Soundz, found
a lyrical niche writing songs about the Gators.
The former UF student is releasing a new ver-
sionof "Gator Bait," his 2007 summer hit, with
a more original rap called "I'm a Gator."
Albury, 21, was reluctant to make another
Gators song at first.
again likde Gtor Bait,' Albury said 'Isf w
did this again, we wanted to make a legiti-
mate song."
"Gator Bait" relied on one-dimensional
lyrics and a beat that was ripped from the
song "Ay Bay Bay" by rapper Hurricane
Chris. The song jump-started Albury's career,
giving him the opportunity to go on a west
coast tour, performing with Snoop Dogg and
Redman. But he said it didn't properly reflect
him as an artist and instead became a joke
among his friends.
So when he was approached by Aditya
Pamidi, 20, UF student and hip-hop producer,
about making a new track for The Gator Na-tion, Albury made sure he got right to work
with Steven Woodburn, known as B. Nyce, a
fellow member of local hip-hop group Car-
mel Labs.
"We were trying to keep it in a way that
a kid who is at his first Gator game could re-
late to it as well as a college student," Pamidi
said.
"I'm a Gator" starts with "Kernkraft 400,"
a song by Zombie Nation that is commonly
played during football
games, and continues for 4
1/2 minutes, delving into
ash talk and Game-Day
Griffin Stadium.
The group admitted
that one benefit of making
Ainurya Gators-themed song is
the instant buzz it gets at
the end of the football season when fans are
out to soak up every ounce of orange-and-
blue-inspired material.
After 12 days, the YouTube version of the
track has just under 3,000 hits, leading the
group to believe that local radio play is only
weeks away.
"I'm a Gator" is available for free down-
load on carmellabs.net.Copyrighted Material

Alligator Contributing Writer
Harold Rocha trudged up 193 stairsteps to the
top of Century Tower.
With each step, a small echo is heard in the
cold, dark, 157-foot tower, which is enough to
leave most visitors huffing and puffing during the
ascent. a

he said.
He passes abandoned rooms with dust covering
the aged concrete floor and climbs 11 1/2 stories
lined with a chain link fence to reach the top of
the tower.
Once he reaches the top, he enters a small room
occupied only by a few dusty chairs, a rickety desk
and a carillon console. He takes a seat, turns off
the automated system that rings the bells every 15
minutes, pulls out his notes and begins to play.

LONG-TERM GOALS ON A BUDGET.

UF's Intelligent Machines Design Labora-
tory students demonstrated their final proj-
ects at Monday's Robot Demo Day at the

into metal and circuitry.
"They don't realize they're learning be-
cause they're having so much fun," said Eric
Schwartz, associate director of the Machine
Intelligence Laboratory.

cially not the self-controlled robots the course
demands.

Planetarium to host out-of-

By LONI CHASE
Alligator Contributing Writer
Throughout finals week, Santa Fe Col-
lege students will be able to kick back and
gaze at the stars between exams.
All week, Kika Silva Pla Planetarium will
play four different shows each day until
Friday for its first Planetarium Awareness
Week.
"It'll give students time to relax and re-
duce stress in between exams," said James
Albury, planetarium coordinator.
Albury, who joined the Kika Silva Pla
Planetarium less than two months ago, said
he decided to open the Planetarium dur-
ing the day because he found that few SFCstudents had been inside due to shows only
being available on Friday and Saturday eve-
nings.
Each day during Planetarium Awareness
Week, the planetarium
will have shows at 10 a.m.,
noon, 2 p.m. and 4 p.m.,
alternating between shows
about black holes, meteors,
stars and planets.
"Personally, I've always
Albury found planetariums to
be relaxing because it is a
dark environment and you can just sit back
and watch the sky," Albury said.

dis said although graduate students
plan to speak against the fee at the
meeting, they are not against the
renovation of the Reitz Union, which
will include updating equipment like
the electrical and air conditioning
systems in addition to expanding the
building.
"It shouldn't be coming out of our
pockets," Fundis said.
Fundis said GAU is also encour-
aging undergraduate students to
come and show their support.
"We don't think that any students
should be paying for this project,"she said.
Martin said close to 100 gradu-
ate students made an appearance at
the Student Senate meeting before
Thanksgiving, when the resolu-
tion supporting the fee was initially
passed. Even though many students
will have gone home after classes end
Wednesday, Martin said she still ex-
pects a lot of support at the meeting.
"I hope a lot of people come out
because that's the only way we'll be
able to beat the proposed fee," Mar-
tin said.

"You can't prepare yourself for some-
thing like this," Tobin said. "Ijust couldn't
believe it."
Cat Lisle, 46, lives next door to the
Wagstaff family and said she and her
husband have lived in the neighborhood
since before the Wagstaffs moved in.
Lisle said most of the neighbors were
not surprised the family was chosen be-
cause they had been receiving fliers in the
mail from ABC asking about the family,
as well as visitors who wanted to know
more about the Wagstaffs.
But it was news to the family, who in-
sisted there were people in greater need,
Lisle said.
The design team for the new home in-cludes Ty Pennington, Didiayer Snyder,
Paul DiMeo and Eduardo Xol.
The show, which began taping on
Monday, used the UF Marching Band and
students from Studio Percussion as a part
of the Braveheart March, which shows
the demolition crew and volunteers
marching to the home.Local Demolition is set for to-NewS day around 5p.m.
Members of the commu-

when a nearby candle started to flare up,
her tears turned to laughter because she
knew it was a sign from Sam.
She encouraged the people in the au-
dience to take two deep breaths and re-
lease their fear and sadness.
"Sam struggled for every breath, but
she never struggled for spirit," Hoy said.
Casi Davis, Sam's roommate, said
when the pair prepared to go out for the
night, they would blast music and have
makeshift dance parties with friends in
their apartment.
Davis said Sam also brought home
pets varying from dogs to cats to mice.
The two even fostered a dog named
Fletcher and would dress him up in
Gators T-shirts.
Sam's outgoing personality made her
an effective advocate for raising aware-
ness and finding a cure for cystic fibrosis.
Sam spoke eloquently to social work-ers about what it was like to grow up with
cystic fibrosis, said Peggy Dolan, the ex-
ecutive director of the Kelly Anne Dolan
Memorial Fund, which helps families
with sick children pay their uninsured
expenses.
"Sam struggled for every breath,

Dolan said Sam was polished and ma-

"So, I mean, she could have done any-
thing with her life, and she did," Dolan
said. "That's the most amazing part, is
she did."
Dolan's organization presented Sam
with the Jack C. Graham Jr. Courage
Award in 2005 because of her willingness
to share her story.

Alright, it's not that bad, usually. There will surely be a line
or two about the lawyer and the silence to which anyone ar-
rested in the U.S. is entitled. But the Miranda statement, as it's
known, is not delivered the same way everywhere.
The Florida Supreme Court recently ruled that Tampa po-
lice did not adequately explain to Kevin Dwayne Powell that
he was allowed to have a lawyer with him during any and all
questioning. Powell confessed to illegal firearm possession, but
the court overturned his conviction.
On Monday, the U.S. Supreme Court heard the case and
appears to be taking the same stance -one that would set a
precedent.
"You have the right to talk to a lawyer before answering any
of our questions," the Tampa police informed Powell. His law-
yers argue that "before" is different from "before and during."
A technicality! "Letting this confessed criminal off is a trav-
esty," you might be thinking.
But the courts are taking this position to ensure the rights
we extend to accused criminals -rights that make our country
great -are clearly and fully understood. It would be hypocriti-
cal to claim we have a fair justice system without these.
Tampa police (and all police around the country) need to
remember this before they deprive any other Americans from
rights they deserve.
And before they allow any more criminals to go free on
"technicalities."
Fake Tans & Flip-FlopsJ ur glowing governor,
harlie Crist, is bent
on convincing Florid-
ians that his ultra-conserva-
tive views will save the coun-
try from financial ruin.
Entering a tough Senate
primary against true ultra-
conservative Marco Rubio, he
has decided to swing further
right in an attempt to build a
conservative base.
A predictable play, as pri-
maries generally drive candi-
dates away from the middle.
But Crist risks his cred-
ibility with bold moves like
denying his earlier support of
the stimulus package, which
is now synonymous with the
idea that Obama is selling the
nation's soul for a few public-
works projects and bankers'
bonuses.
"I didn't endorse it. I
didn't even have a vote on the
darned thing," Crist recently
told CNN. But with the infa-
mous Obama embrace, Cristessentially wrapped his arms
around the bill too.
He cannot hide his sup-
port of the bill, just like he
can't hide from the man-hug
(we told you so, Crist).
And he shouldn't. Be-
cause more important than
credibility, Crist risks losing
the support of the commie
wackos at the Alligator Edi-
torial Board.
All right, it might not be
more important than cred-
ibility, and not everyone at
the Alligator was exactly a
Crist-o-maniac, but the fact
that his moderate, get-the-
job-done attitude could win
over even a few of us says
something about his appeal.
(We swear the superb tan has
nothing to do with it.)
Weathering the stormy
waters of a Republican pri-
mary is a small price to pay
for broad, bipartisan support
come election day. Because
he'll need it.

(Y/i
First year doesn't set tone for future
question for first-years here at UF: How was yoursemester?
I ask because I hated my freshman fall semester.
I wasn't warming up to UF or Gainesville. I wasn't meeting
anybody who seemed like me. And I felt very lost and rud-
derless as I began to question why I was even here.
The result was a very whiny, very pouty version of me
(well, more pouty) that was generally unpleasant to be
around. I'm not being hyperbolic. I'm shocked that any-
body I met during that semester is still my friend today,
and whenever I run into somebody I haven't seen since
then, the conversation tends to begin by me issuing blan-
ket apologies.
The truth was, I didn't have any real reason to be miser-
able, and so being miserable felt selfish and myopic. This,
in turn, made me feel even more miserable. And even set-
ting aside the true notion that the opportunity to go to col-
lege is something I should feel incredibly fortunate for even
having, I know I was luckier than a lot of freshmen: I had
a pretty great roommate who put up with my nonsense (I
still appreciate it, Jorge), my stack of classes wasn't too bad,
and I had friends who, for reasons not entirely clear to me,
still answered their phones at 11 p.m. even though they
knew it was my nightly "I'm not good at college!" mope.
But self-awareness doesn't keep you from feeling bad
any more than knowing that a fifth hamburger is a really
bad idea doesn't stop you from loading up your Gator
Dining Services to-go box. (My healthy eating habits were
about on par with my social skills back then.)
That's OK, though.
Simply put, if you're feeling a little unsure of where
you're going and if you're where you need to be, or if your
semester felt too underwhelming or overwhelming, or
if the past four months just completely sucked -you're
fine.
Feeling like you haven't made enough new, awesome
friends? Don't stress -it's not as if you've got a quota tofl'U
Joe Dellosa
letters@alligator orgreach. And while you can put your-
self in situations where you're more
likely to meet people, making a con-
nection -that is, meeting the right
person under the right circumstances
-is pretty much out of our control.
It's frustrating, but it's also comfort-
ing to know there's no point in losing
sleep over it.
Attempts to find someone to fall
in love with fell flat? Almost everyone has an embarrassing
story about making an ass of themselves in a fit of roman-
tic ineptitude. I promise you, your story can't be too much
worse than anyone else's. (And besides, I'm pretty sure
I've got you beat. Does your story involve asking someone
out using a "Hey Arnold!" quote? OK then.)
Worried that you have no idea what you want out of
college? You have time to figure it out. And even if you
don't, it's not a big deal. Don't be discouraged by people
who seem like they have their collegiate career perfectly
mapped out. Chances are, something -a messy breakup,
a newly discovered interest -will throw off any precise
set of plans. And besides, discovering who you aren't can
be just as important as discovering who you are.
Disappointed that your GPA isn't as strong as you
wanted it to be? Bombing an exam or two isn't the end
of the world, and it's important to remember that a GPA,
or any other number on a report, isn't a measure of your
worth -not now, not ever.
It's OK to have had a lackluster first semester. Just take
what you've learned and try to kick some ass next semester
-and try to be a little empathetic for people trying to do
the same. After all, there's no such thing as an impractical
level of empathy -or rather, if there is, it's a pretty awe-
some thing to have.

Letters to the Editor
Alligator lacks support for Gators
After reading the Alligator sports page, I
was greatly disappointed. Not because of our
stinging loss to Alabama, but because of the
lack of support. Nothing spoke of support for
our team. I was at the Southeastern Confer-
ence Championship Game, and I stayed until
the last second, cheering for our team. You
could tell Tim Tebow and the rest of the team
were crushed, and it pissed me off when Ala-
bama fans cheered at Tim's crying face.
There is a certain level of class we as
Gators need to maintain, and that means sup-
porting your team, win or lose, and not leav-
ing in the third quarter. Tim, Brandon Spikes,
everyone, I hope if you're all reading this,
you know that The Gator Nation is proud of
all of you, and "in all kinds of weather we
all stick together for F-L-O-R-I-D-A!" I chal-
lenge students and fans alike to let our team
know that they have our support. Join me in
writing in and showing your appreciation.
(Better hurry -today's your last chance to
write in for the semester.)
It's Great to Be a Florida Gator!

Public reaction to loss disappoints
Three things to describe Tim Tebow:
amazing athlete, outstanding character and
100 percent human. With humanity comes
imperfection. Shocking, right?
Three things to describe Facebook: a way
for people to glorify themselves, complain
and a chance for every anti-Gators fan to
say as many hateful things they can think of
about Tebow and the Gators football team.
Life is full of wins and losses. We know
that no one person or team can win all thetime, but with that in mind, a loss still disap-
points. What I find even more disappointing
than Saturday's loss was the public's reac-
tion. People who are not even Alabama fans
celebrated (that is putting it mildly) our loss.
What is the reason for that? I can only think
of two things: jealousy and hate.
I just wanted the Gators football team to
know that they did not let us down. The loss
on Saturday was nothing compared to all
of the accomplishments they have made in
the past few years -accomplishments that
reach far beyond the football field. I think
that people have been inspired by this team
and Tebow's heartfelt leadership. Thank
you for making my college football experi-
ence worthwhile, not just by the amount of
trophies, but because of the way you guys
played the game.

Column a 'pick-me-up' for readers
Throughout the semester, I've always
looked forward to Wednesday's column. The
sardonic humor underlying Hilary Lehman's
commentary on anything from the benefits of
being judgmental to the lack of literary merit
in the "Twilight" series has always been a
welcome Hump Day pick-me-up.
Accordingly, when I read her column
"Lessons come from experience, not advice"
last week, I was dismayed to learn that she'll
be graduating and likely leaving her post at
the Alligator. I'm sure I speak for many who
will no doubt miss her weekly dispatch in
wishing her the best of luck post-graduation.
Brava, Hilary.
Brad Bruggeman
UF microbiology sophomorehe following is an excerpt froma letter sent to New York State
Sen. Tom Libous.
Sen. Libous,
I could not believe my eyes upon
reading the front page of The New
York Times on Dec. 2.
I do not pretend this letter will in
any way sway the decision you've so
staunchly declared in the last debate
regarding same-sex marriage rights
for New York residents. However,
seeing as writing to our senators is a
privilege few citizens take advantage
of, I have decided that you should
understand, by the hand of one of the
many citizens whom you were select-
ed to serve, exactly why your position
is so offensive.
Being selected to represent a state
-and most importantly your nation
-through your vote and influence is
an honor. It requires a very serious
commitment to understanding that
the decisions you make will seriously
affect citizens, the majority of whom
exist on a much lesser-privileged
layer.
On Dec. 2, you were quoted in Jere-
my W. Peters' article, "New York Sen-
ate Votes Down Gay Marriage Bill,"
saying this in The New York Times:
"I just don't think the majority care
too much about [same sex marriage]
at this time because they're out of
work, they want to see the state re-
duce spending, and they are having
a hard time making ends meet. And
I don't mean to sound callous, but
that's true."
I have not read a less enlightened
statement in print in a long time.
I urge you to redefine "truth" for
yourself as being the just and virtu-
ous decision that you could have tak-
en during these deliberations.
I also ask you, since when should
civil human rights come second to
"making ends meet?"
To my understanding, this nation
has often been barely "making ends
meet." But that did not keep the Civil
Rights movement or the feminist
movement from fighting for and at-
taining equality under the law.
I also urge you to recall that the
country's financial condition has very
little to do with the individual choic-
es our citizens have made and very
much to do with the policy choices.
I graduated from my high school
(seventh out of a class of 800) with a
full scholarship to any university in
Florida that I wished to attend. I did
not have any expulsions or other rep-
rimands on my record, and I was an
involved and well-liked student.
My senior year, I was nearly ex-
pelled after I moved to publicly rebut
a statement one of the public school
teachers made. Over the airways dur-
ing the morning announcements, she
condemned homosexuality and thenChristina Garcia proceeded to
quote the Biblede los Rios as defense. In
Speaking Out case this detail
is overlooked, I
attended a pub-
lic high school -Bible quotes were
not part of our curriculum.
I took a stance against this blatant
disrespect, not only to an entire com-
munity attending that high school,
but also against the separation of
church and state, in which I have a
right as an attendee of a public school
not to have any religious instruction
imposed on me.
Because I didn't keep silent, I was
threatened with expulsion and forced
to see an outside community counsel-
or once a week until my graduation
date if I wished to graduate. When I
questioned my high school principal
about the ethics of such a strong chas-
tisement and why she would not al-
low me to air my rebuttal, she said it
would interfere with FCAT testing.
Needless to say, I was outraged at
the idea that defending separation of
church and state and simultaneously
making a stand against that teacher's
complete disrespect of her students
and of this policy came second to a
menial state test. This is an insult to
our principles of justice and democ-
racy.
Your statement on Dec. 2, as you
insisted on using the failing economy
and individual stress as an excuse for
why this bill should not be passed,
reminded me a little too much of
that horrid episode I endured as an
18-year-old.
Mr. Libous, I respect this country
immensely. It offered my family a
home when ours was actively being
torn to shreds, and it has offered me
continuous support in my education
and upbringing.
That's why I cannot believe that
citizens would come second in your
mind to something intangible like the
economy, when its crippling condi-
tion has always been beyond our indi-
vidual control. I urge you to stand by
the ideas of justice and virtue, upon
which our founding fathers built this
nation.
You were selected for your posi-
tion because of your ability to lead, so
do the nation a favor and lead by ex-
ample. Stand up for what you know
is right and stop making excuses for
your inaction.
I don't intend for this letter to be
ill-willed. On the contrary, I am writ-
ing with my heart in my hand, quite
exhausted at having to continue to ex-
ist in a world that has told me over
and over again, "We do not respect
you," and, "You are not equal."

UF WOMEN'S BASKETBALL
Florida falls to Rutgers on road
By EUGENIO TORRENS
Alligator Staff Writer
etorrens@alligator org
If a game can be won in the first
half, Rutgers did just that against
Florida on Monday.
The Scarlet Knights (6-4) smoth-
ered the Gators (3-5) in the final 11
minutes of the first half, going on a
17-1 run that forced Florida to play
catch-up in the second half en route
to a 51-38 loss.
"It was a little bit of a snowball
effect there in the first half," coach
Amanda Butler said. "The good
news was that as poorly as we had
played we were only down 14 (at
the end of the first half)."
Continuing an early season
trend, UF shot the ball inconsistent-
ly and had one of its worst shoot-
ing nights of the season, making
11 of its 50 attempted shots in the
game for a paltry 22 percent from
the floor.

Surprising loss needed
to gain perspective
he Gators didn't lose to Alabama on Saturday, they
There's a difference.
Sure, panicked play-calling that abandoned the run
game probably wasn't the right choice. Lax coverage on
the Crimson Tide's receivers, poor tackling and the in-
ability to get pressure on UA quarterback Greg McElroy
didn't help, and neither did the absence of Carlos Dun-
lap.
But with the way the Crimson Tide played, this wasn't
Florida's game to lose.
There's no sensible "what if" to latch onto, just the
simple fact that Alabama showed up
and beat the pants off UF.
The Gators would have had to
play a perfect game to win. They
didn't, and as Phil Kegler said in
Monday's column, this was total
Mike MCCall domination.

You've all been incredibly blessed during the past few

This is part of what being a fan is all about. We fol-

Through Dark
Senior Spofforth takes troubles in stride
By TONI-ANN MILLER
Alligator Writer
Gemma Spofforth is undoubt-
edly a champion. She owns seven
UF school records, four Southeast-
ern Conference records, an NCAA
record, a U.S. Open record, a world
record and an Olympic appearance
for her native Great Britain.
At first glance, one sees a young
woman who works hard and ac-
complishes numerous feats. She is
often smiling, and during swim-
ming and diving meets, she's the
quintessential "bundle of joy."
However, there is more to Spof-
forth than meets the eye, and like
most people, she too has a story to
tell.
Giving back
This semester, the senior decid-
ed she wanted to spend some time
helping out around Gainesville,
and when she spoke to a girl in
one of her classes, she discovered
the perfect opportunity. She went
through rigorous training twice a
week to become a telephone coun-
selor for people who are either con-
templating suicide, depressed or
just need someone to talk to.
"Being a captain on the team, I
try to be the (one) that people can
come and talk to if they have any
problems," Spofforth said. "Obvi-
ously some problems are bigger
than others, but I always try to be
the person who's approachable,
and I thought I could use those
skills to be that person on the
phones."
Spofforth probably found it
easy to relate to these people be-
cause although she's often upbeat,
sometimes she lets everything get
to her and breaks down before get-
ting back to normal.
Leaving home
Growing up in Britain, Spof-
forth faced a tough challenge when
she became ill and was subse-
quently left with two choices, come
to America or quit swimming.
"If I hadn't come 1o America, I
wouldn't be swimming," she said."I had pancreatitis the year before
I came here, 2006 I think. I was out
of the water, I got really fat and I
just wasn't enjoying swimming be-
cause I was unfit and sick.
"To get back into (swimming), I
needed something really big to mo-
tivate me, and that was coming to
America. Because if I hadn't come
here then I don't think I would
have put the effort into getting in
shape again and getting fit."
After deciding that she would
leavehome, Spofforthhad to choose
a specific destination. She said she
received eleven full-scholarship of-
fers, but she narrowed her choices
down to Hawaii and Florida.
"I could've gone to Hawaii and
enjoyed the lifestyle there, but I
chose Florida because I decided
that I did want to take swimming
seriously," she said.
Also factoring into her decision,
she said, was the supportiveness
of Florida's coaches; especially as-sociate head coach Martyn Wilby,
a fellow Brit, who explained the
American system to her.
When she finally arrived in
Gainesville, Spofforth said she had
to deal with initial culture shock.
"All the things that I saw, I
didn't think were real. I thought
they were just fantasies in movies.
I didn't realize that you had cheer-
leaders. I didn't realize you had a
band and all that sort of stuff. It
definitely took me by surprise, but
I loved it the second I walked on
campus."
Difficult times
At the time she was deciding
about her future in swimming and
possibly in America, Spofforth had
another important thing to consid-
er -her mother Lesley's health as
she battled with cancer.
"My mom being sick kind of
made things a little bit more tur-
bulent, but she wanted me to goWaters
follow my dream and do the best
I could, and she would've support-
ed me in anything I did," Spofforth
said.
She said her mother's condition
improved before she left home but
that after some time here, she got
"the call" from her father.
"It was very sudden in the end
but it was something that we'd
been preparing for, for about four
years. She went in and out of reces-
sion a couple times and it was very
hard to have that final phone call
from my dad that said, 'It's time for
you to come home.'
"I actually got there the day she
died. I think she held on a little bit
just to say bye to me."
Dealing with loss
The passing of her mother has
impacted Spofforth's performance
in the pool. She said she uses the
strength that her mother would've
given her every time she com-
petes.
When she set the world record
and won the FINA World Champi-

asaonship in the 100-meter backstroke
this summer in Rome, she dedicat-
ed the performance to her mother.
However, when she finished fourth
in the same event and in the 4x100-
meter medley relay at the Beijing
Olympics last summer, she faced
different emotions.
"I went into another swale of
depression because it was a huge
high when I came back, and mum
still wasn't here. It was very hard to
pull myself out of that but luckily I
was able to have the family around
me that I've had. This team's just
supportive in every way they can
be."
Spofforth still has her father
Mark and younger brother Peter,
who she said she's gotten closer to
since her mother's death. However,
being far from home, she has found
a family here in Gainesville.
"She always had the support of
the rest of the team, and because
she's such a giving person -she's
very interested in other people -
sometimes the more you give the
more you receive," coach Gregg
Troy said. "When there were tough
times the rest of the team was very
aware of it."
Sophomore teammate, fellow
Brit and one of Spofforth's closest
friends Jemma Lowe provides Spof-
forth a confidant who understands
what she faces by being away from
home. However, the two had a
rocky start at their first meeting, a
swimming camp in 2005.
"I didn't really know her, and I
didn't really like her to be honest,
at first," Lowe said.
She added that she thought
Spofforth had quit swimming
when in fact she was in Gainesville,
but then when both qualified for
Great Britain's Olympic team, they
grew close.
After the Olympic Games, Spof-
forth got a tattoo of the Olympic
rings on her wrist, a reminder and
a motivator to avoid fourth place
finishes, as she often had in big
meets.
The senior continues to be dom-
inant in the pool, but clearly she's
more than an Olympic-caliber ath-
lete. She's a person, with a story,
like the rest of us.-

UF deals with injuries as top-10 matchup approaches
0 RAY SHIPMAN AND KENNY KADJI
COULD MISS THURSDAY'S GAME.
By ADAM BERRY
Alligator Staff Writer
a berry@alligator org
The grueling portion of Florida's early
season schedule has taken its toll.
Coming off a stretch of eight games in 19
days, UF coach Billy Donovan said Monday
that guard Ray Shipman and center Kenny
Kadji suffered injuries that could keep them
out of Thursday's game against Syracuse in
Tampa.
Kadji is dealing with a lower back prob-
lem, while Shipman has been diagnosed
with a mid-foot sprain.
"We're hoping that's all it is," Donovan
said of Shipman's injury. "Having basically
10 guys, we're down to eight right now. How
do you manage to be productive in practice
and those kinds of things?"
The No. 10 Gators (8-0) have nearly a
week off between their last game Friday
at Jacksonville and the upcoming top-10
showdown with the No. 7 Orange (8-0), but
the potential loss of Shipman could be par-
ticularly devastating given Florida's lack of
depth in the backcourt.
Kadji did not play for the first time all sea-
son against Jacksonville, and he has seem-

"I still don't have a great pulse on our In addition to recovering from the physi-
team because there is a factor of a lack of cal and emotional strain caused by the re-

sloppy play it occasionally showed against
the Dolphins. UF abandoned the tough de-
fensive identity it had built through the sea-
son's opening games against JU, and Dono-
van said part of that could be attributed to
the team's fatigue and lack of practice time.
"We have sorely missed out on practice,
and I have seen the last week to 10 days, a lot
of slippage in where we were at defensively
to start the season," Donovan said. "That's
always a concern when you're creating
those habits, those habits start slipping, now
you're trying to deal with having to balance
practice time, scouting, short period of time
in between, injuries, guys being knocked up
here a little bit."
Sophomore point guard Erving Walker,
who is averaging more than 31 minutes
per game so far this season, said the much-
needed break will give the Gators time to get
their legs back.
"The break is good. We get a chance to
rest," Walker said. "Without conditioning,
it's really hard to compete to the best of our
abilities, so the conditioning's really helping
us.
Donovan said the team will spend some
of its time off working on improving its re-
bounding, as Florida is only grabbing 3.5
more boards per game than its opponents
so far this season -another area in which
Donovan said his team has gotten progres-
sively worse the more it played.
"We've got to try to find a way to improve
and not lose out on some of the progress that
we had made in a positive direction," Dono-
van said.

figured that would come after Tebow & Co. left with an-
other title, but it should have more of an effect now.
Obviously, a large contingent of Florida fans was
around for the Ron Zook or even pre-Steve Spurrier
years, so those folks can view all this in the correct light.
But for the more recent crowd, it's important to soak
up the depression and shock that hit like a Mark Ingram
stiff-arm to the face last weekend. Remember the feeling,
because it will make the next triumph so much sweeter.
As fans and in life, we can't appreciate the good things
we're given without experiencing the bad first.
Watching East Carolina win three games in two years
under former UF defensive coordinator John Thompson
(thanks a lot) makes the Pirates' back-to-back ConferenceUSA titles mean a whole lot more to me, and sometime
soon, the Gators are probably going to get a crack at an-
other national championship.
In the meantime, swallow your pride and prove
you're not the bunch of "bandwagon Florida fans" ev-
eryone else thinks you are. Go to New Orleans, celebrate
New Year's on Bourbon St. and bring The Swamp to the
Louisiana Superdome.
And before you do that, check out the No. 10 Florida
basketball team. Much to my surprise, the Gators are
good, and they play No. 7 Syracuse on Thursday.
UF has made it too easy to be a fan in recent years,
and it's undeniable that fan interest reached a new high

"We relied on the 3, like we've done way too
many times, way too many games," Sorensen said.
"We waited until the second half to start playing."
The Gators' inability to establish a post pres-

Florida's post players
couldn't keep up with Rutgers' Chelsey Lee, who
scored 8 of her 12 points to start that game-chang-
ing run.
Her contribution wasn't limited to scoring, as
the sophomore center added 9 rebounds, two as-
sists, a steal and three blocks.
"The thing that really ignited their run was the
way Chelsey Lee was playing and really control-
ling the paint and rebounding the basketball,"
Butler said. "Our post players didn't respond very
well and then our shooters started settling for shots
that aren't maybe the highest-percentage shots."
UF will face Old Dominion on Friday before a
nine-day break for final exams.

for our panel of voters. Ingram
rushed for 113 yards and three
touchdowns and added 76 receiving yards. He
converted seemingly every third down and broke
tackles at will. His performance was incredible,
and he looked like the best player on the field. Tim
Tebow, meanwhile, couldn't stay on the field and

Gerhart was off this week with

Still, his numbers are extremely
impressive, and he only got better
as the season went on and the carries piled up.
The senior will be in New York as a finalist, but it's
tough to say exactly what his chances of winning
are since his team lost four games.
