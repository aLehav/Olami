 JACKSONVILLE — John Brant-
ley tried to lift them up. Instead, the 
Gators hit a new low Saturday.
  Everything Florida was playing 
for entering the season — a South-
eastern Conference championship, 
an East division title — went out the window in a 24-20 loss to No. 18 Georgia (6-2, 5-1 SEC) at EverBank Field.
  The Gators’ redshirt senior quar-
terback returned from a high ankle sprain suffered against Alabama on Oct. 1, but it wasn’t enough to help 
Florida (4-4, 2-4 SEC) avoid a four-
game losing streak for the ﬁ  rst time since 1988.
  “A gutsy performance on his 
part,” coach Will Muschamp said. “He’s a guy that really laid it on the line.”
  Brantley didn’t go through pre-
game warm-ups with the rest of the 
team and was unable to take snaps 
from under center because his in-jured ankle limited his mobility . As a result, Florida ran mostly four- and ﬁ  ve-receiver sets against Georgia, limiting what the offense could do.
  The senior completed his ﬁ  rst    JACKSONVILLE
In his ﬁ  rst season and ﬁ  rst taste of Florida’s most historic rival-ry, Will Muschamp has made 
sure the new era of Gators football would be remembered. 
  Problem is, most would rather 
forget. 
  After losing to Georgia to close 
out a winless October, and with all hope of a late charge at the division title lost, Muschamp seems to have ﬁ  nally realized just how plain bad this Florida team is playing.
  “This  
year, we’re not close,” he said inside the bowels of EverBank S t a d i u m on Satur-day night. 
  To his credit, Muschamp knows 
what’s wrong: turnovers, no run game and, of course, the stunning 
amount of those darned yellow 
ﬂ  ags that are tossed each game. 
  Out of 120 FBS schools, Florida 
is last in the nation with 75 penal-ties, and the two teams immedi-ately ahead — Colorado (73) and Western Michigan (69) — have both

  According to a recent study, people who drink more 
than three alcoholic drinks a day could be more at risk for 
lung cancer.
  Researchers at Kaiser Permanente in Oakland, Calif., 
found that people who had more than three alcoholic drinks were 30 percent more likely to develop lung can-cer, with a 70 percent rise in risk if the person preferred beer over wine or liquor.
  In the study, researchers ﬁ  rst surveyed 
more than 126,000 people between 1978 and 1985.
Researchers studied their lifestyles 
and diets and tracked their incident of lung cancer through 2008, according to a U.S. News and World Report article. 
  Next, they monitored the instances of 
lung cancer.The ﬁ  ndings were presented at the annual meeting of 
American College of Chest Physicians, held Oct. 22 to 26 in Honolulu.
  Ronald Akers, a UF criminology and sociology profes-
sor, said alcohol is linked to lung cancer because people who drink have a higher frequency of smoking as well. These people are social smokers and drinkers. 
  “There is a behavioral correlation,” Akers said. “Peo-
ple who don’t drink at all almost have a zero chance of  Study ﬁ  nds that drinking, lung cancer correlate

The Student Recreation and Fitness 
Center got a makeover Tuesday when 
maintenance and delivery staff replaced more than a dozen machines.
The new strength-training machines, 
made by FreeMotion Fitness, replaced old machines of the same style. 
The machines were between 8 and 10 
years old, which is old for fitness ma-chines, said Katie Roberts, RecSports coordinator for fitness of strength and conditioning and fitness assessment.
The replacements follow the trend 
of renovating university fitness centers, which hasn’t just included massive over -
hauls at Southwest Recreation Center.  
Earlier in the year, the Student Recre-ation and Fitness Center received car -
diovascular machines like treadmills, step-mills and cycling ma-
chines and expanded 
its exercise floor.
The machines add-
ed at the center Tues-day cost RecSports 
$57,576, said Gary Zetrouer, associate 
director for resource and project man-agement in the department. 
He said this year’s RecSports budget is about $5.7 million. 
The budget is allocated by Student 
Government from activity and service fees collected from students by the uni-versity. The RecSports board of direc-tors — made up of students, faculty and staff — then decides how to spend the 
money, he said. 
Roberts said she hopes students will 
appreciate the new equipment and said 
part of her job is to make sure students have a good place to work out while they spend years at the university going to school.
“We don’t want people to think that 
Student Rec is the backup gym,” she 
said.Student Rec Center gets new fitness machines

Stories of black cats being 
sacrificed, disfigured or killed 
during satanic Halloween rit-uals proliferate every year. 
In response, some U.S. ani-
mal shelters ban the adoption of black cats during October. 
Friends of Strays Inc., 
which conducts pet adop-tions in St. Petersburg, does not permit the adoption of black cats from its shelter in October, said Margo Thomas, foster program coordinator.
But others say there is no 
need for this suspicion.Stories of groups perform-
ing ritual sacrifices of black cats are urban legends, said the Rev. Diallo Mudd, or Lord Moonraven-Iuvantas, who is a member of the Circle of the Phoenix witchcraft group in Jacksonville. 
“Most mainstream pagan 
faiths don’t do that at all,” he said. “Cats are actually protected in these religious groups.”
Hilary Hines, public edu-
cation program coordinator for Alachua County Animal Services, said she has worked at animal services for 12 years 
and has never seen a case of Halloween-related black-cat 
abuse. 
The American Society for 
the Prevention of Cruelty to 
Animals found no correlation 
between Halloween and the abuse of black cats, said Mal-lory Kerley, a media coordina-tor for the organization.
But Kirk Eppenstein, ex-
ecutive director of Haile’s An-gels Pet Rescue in Gainesville, said there is a heightened awareness about animal abuse in October. 
The rescue scrutinizes an 
individual during the adop-tion process.
If a person came in to the 
rescue looking to adopt a sol-id black cat and did not ask 
about anything else, Eppen-
stein said he would be suspi-cious and question his or her intentions.
 “It’s kind of like the 9/11 
terrorists,” he said. “They wanted to learn how to fly the planes, but they didn’t want to learn how to land the 
planes.”

Tebowing: “To get down on a knee and 
start praying, even if everyone else around 
you is doing something completely differ -
ent.” After the Denver Broncos’ Oct. 23 vic-
tory against the Miami Dolphins, UF alumnus Tim Tebow knelt in prayer while his teammates celebrated the 18-15 win 
around him.
“What he did at the end of the game 
was unreal and deserved tribute,” said Jared Kleinstein, founder of Tebowing.
com, which features photographs of ev-eryday people “Tebowing.”
Kleinstein, along with four other Bron-
cos fans, started the “Tebowing” craze themselves.
Kleinstein said that when he pulled a “Tebow” outside of Sidebar, a sports bar and lounge in Union Square, New York City, he had no idea that photograph would one day be viewed by millions of 
people.
Kleinstein purchased the domain name 
on Tuesday for $10, and 785 users visited 
the website on the first day. 
By Saturday afternoon, the website had 
about about 800,000 users and 3.2 million views, Kleinstein said.
Tebowing.com features an array of 
photos of people “Tebowing” coupled 
with witty captions, including photos of 
UF students and cheerleaders during the Florida-Georgia football game with cap-tions like “Cheerbowing” and “#Tebow-ingNation.”
The 2007 Heisman Trophy winner has 
acknowledged “Tebowing” and given it his approval.
“To get down on a knee 
and pray when not neces-sarily everybody else is doing it, I think that’s a 
pretty cool thing,” Tebow told reporters on Friday. 
“And it’s stepping out for 
something that you ei-ther believe in or that you 
want to show or if you just want to pray, 
either way it’s pretty cool.” 
Tebow also commented on “Tebowing” 
through tweets. 
He said he loves it and posted photo-
graphs of people “Tebowing” on Twitter. 
One included a child undergoing che-
motherapy entitled “I’m ‘Tebowing’ while 
Chemoing!”
Kleinstein said seeing the response to 
“Tebowing” from so many people is what makes the website worthwhile. 
“They’re all just ‘Tebowing’ away,” he 
said.

Multisubstance use syndrome states some-
one who uses one kind of substance is more 
likely to use another.
Smoking and drinking are not caused by 
each other but are closely related, Akers said. 
According to the Centers for Disease Con-
trol and Prevention, more people die in the 
United States from lung cancer than any other type of cancer.
According to the CDC website, in 2007, 
the latest year for which the data is available, 
203,536 people were diagnosed with lung can-
cer, and 158,683 people died from it.
Individuals ages 18 to 25, the college-age 
group, who start drinking and smoking now 
are more likely to keep that habit 25 years from 
now, Akers said.
He said this increases their chances of de-
veloping lung cancer.4, ALLIGATOR §  MONDAY, OCTOBER 31, 2011

UF’s graduate school will soon be 
mining some “untapped diamonds” 
in the form of master’s degree stu-
dents at historically black colleges 
and universities.
The HBCU-UF Master’s to Ph.D. 
Pathway Project is an initiative to in-
crease doctoral student diversity at 
UF and attract students who would not ordinarily consider pursuing a Ph.D., said Janet Broiles, recruitment and graduation coordinator for Grad-
uate Minority Programs. 
Henry Frierson, associate vice 
president and dean of UF’s Gradu-
ate School, started the program be-
cause he encountered many talented 
master’s degree students — the “un-tapped diamonds” — who had not en-tertained the idea of getting a Ph.D., Broiles said. 
Under the project, faculty members 
identify outstanding master’s stu-dents during their first year of gradu-ate school. If the student decides to pursue a 
Ph.D. at UF, he or she would spend the second year of the master’s program 
working with a UF faculty member.
That faculty member would pro-
vide guidance.
The student would then apply to a 
UF doctoral program. 
“There’s certainly no guarantee,” 
Frierson said. 
Pathway Project students must ap-
ply and undergo review like every 
other applicant.
Their master’s  degree work would 
be reviewed heavily, Frierson said. 
UF will collaborate with 13 colleges on the project. 
Broiles said she expects two or 
three students to be selected from 
each partner school. 
The first group of Pathway Project 
participants is projected to matricu-
late at UF in Fall 2013. 
Some of the partner schools have 
doctoral programs, but those pro-grams may not be in the areas stu-dents want to continue to study in, Broiles said. 
Frierson selected schools for the 
project with different Ph.D. programs from UF. 
The project specifically targets his-
torically black colleges and universi-
ties because they contain a pool of stu-
dents who don’t usually attend bigger universities, Broiles said. 
The project also seeks to increase 
diversity of UF’s doctoral students.
“I think any time you can bring 
in individuals with philosophies and backgrounds into a research arena, it broadens the depth and scope of 
research that the university can put 
forth,” Broiles said.UF recruiting Ph.D. students with new program

Don’t tell Kelsey Tainsh there’s 
something she can’t do.
At age 5, she became a cancer 
survivor after undergoing surgery 
and radiation to remove a tumor 
from her brain.
By 11, she began motivational 
speaking and had founded an or -
ganization that brings puppies into 
children’s hospitals.
By 13, she had acted in the movie 
“Rumor Has It...” with Jennifer An-iston and Mark Ruffalo, as well as an episode of “Desperate Housewives” 
and an episode of “Gilmore Girls.”
By the time she was 15, she was a 
state-champion rower with the Win-
ter Park High School crew team and ranked third in the world for girls’ wakeboarding.
Then her tumor came back. During her second brain surgery 
— this one 10 hours long — she suf-
fered a stroke that left her paralyzed 
on the right side of her body.
People started telling her all the 
things she’d never do. Kelsey , now a 21-year-old recreation and event management junior at UF, started proving them wrong.
Over the past six years, Kelsey 
has learned to walk again. She’s re-
learned how to eat and write and 
run and swim and row and put her hair into a ponytail. All milestones.
“I always knew [the paralysis] 
would be temporary for Kelsey . She’s a fighter,” said Valerie Tainsh, Kelsey’s sister. 
The Tainshs are a family of sev-
en. Cynthia and Robert Tainsh have 
a set of twins, Laurel and Rob, and 
a set of triplets, Erica, Kelsey and Valerie. 
The family breeds border collies 
and golden retrievers. At one point, they had 21 puppies running around their lakefront home.
The nine beds in their house, most 
of them bunks, are usually always 
full with friends or family members. 
Erica, Kelsey and Valerie have lived together all three years at UF, even braving a triple dorm in Murphree Hall during their sophomore year.They share the same best friend, 
the same clothes and, throughout high school, many of the same class-es. 
In fact, it was in a math class Eri-
ca and Kelsey had their sophomore year of high school when Erica saw 
the first signs that Kelsey’s cancer 
was back.
Kelsey’s face started to go red.Erica asked her what was wrong, 
but Kelsey just held up her finger. Wait. I can’t talk. 
The girls’ mother, a neurologist, 
identified the incident as a seizure and after taking her in for an MRI, 
the doctors said the words no moth-
er wants to hear: It’s cancer. Again.
Kelsey and her parents flew to 
Boston Children’s Hospital for her second brain surgery , almost 10 years to the day from her first one. Her one request was that the doc-tors didn’t shave all her thick, brown hair. They agreed.
Erica and Valerie waited ner -
vously in their home in Winter Park, calling their father every five or 10 minutes to get an update. Er -
ica struggled through her summer reading, “The Poisonwood Bible,” while Valerie packed for a summer rowing camp. The 18-year-old twins were traveling in Europe after their 
high school graduation and anx-
iously awaiting updates from their parents across the Atlantic.
After about 10 hours, Kelsey 
came out of surgery. She had suf-fered a stroke, the doctors said. They knew going in it was a possibility . But she was alive, and they hoped the tumor was gone.
When she woke up, she couldn’t 
move anything. Opposite the bald patch above her left temple, her face drooped. She couldn’t smile, and she could barely talk. 
Her right arm and leg were para-
lyzed. Her abdominal muscles had relaxed, making her stomach swell.
“I had always thought medicine 
was infallible,” said her sister Val-erie, now a premed student at UF, “until then.”
But Kelsey wouldn’t stay inactive 
for long, beginning physical therapy about a week after her surgery . “I was going to run again,” she 
vowed.
Initially put in a rehab program 
with other stroke patients, Kelsey , the 16-year-old world-class athlete, wasn’t being challenged and didn’t make much progress. So her dad 
called Dave Nitti, a physical thera-
pist at the Florida Hospital, to give Kelsey private sessions at home.
“She was convinced that she 
was going to get better,” Nitti said. “She was such an active kid; she al-ways wanted to push herself. … She amazes me all the time.”
They started out small: Wiggle 
your toes. Now move them an inch. Now move your foot an inch.
She started walking again, first 
with a walker, then with a cane. Then she was running. Once, she and Nitti went surfing.
Still not satisfied, Kelsey joined 
the Beyond Therapy program at the Shepherd Center in Atlanta. Kelsey and her mom drove seven hours twice a week for therapy sessions. 
Here, Kelsey was treated more 
like an athlete than a patient. She learned to lift weights and to row again, using a special glove over her 
right hand. 
Kelsey hopes to one day be a 
world-class athlete again — this 
time in Paralympic swimming.
She swims more than a mile at a 
time and works out at the gym about three times a week.
No longer an actress, she now 
travels around Florida as a motiva-
tional speaker, sharing her message 
of hope and encouragement.
This semester, the UF junior is 
balancing 13 credits, an event-man-agement internship at the O’Connell Center, weekly community-service events and monthly doctors ap-pointments around the country . She has traveled on medical mission trips to Mexico with her family and studied abroad in Costa Rica, France and Greece. In her spare time, she’s writing a book about her experi-ences. 
Recurrent cancer can be very ag-
gressive, according to the American Cancer Society, especially in young cancer survivors. 
Kelsey must get regular MRIs 
and checkups to monitor her body. Though she is in remission, there’s always a chance her tumor can come back in another five, 10, 20 years.
But just try to tell Kelsey she 
won’t beat it.
“I’m living with cancer, but I’m 
not living in fear, ” she said. “I re-alized at a very young age that life can be very short, but I fully believe that you can do whatever you want in life if you put your mind to it, no matter what’s happened to you.” MONDAY, OCTOBER 31, 2011 § ALLIGATOR, 5

North Florida Herald 
to close its doors
In this cruel economy, the news industry has suffered great 
losses over the past few years. October in particular has 
been a tough month for the newspapers in Florida. 
We’ve been hearing about newspapers laying off employ-
ees, cutting back on the number of pages and transforming 
fully into online-only publications left and right.
But this weekend we heard some news that hit us really 
close to home.
We got word that the North Florida Herald, previously 
known as the High Springs Herald, a 60-year-old weekly newspaper based about 30 minutes north of Gainesville by way of I-75, will be going out of business. 
Ronald Dupont, owner of the Herald, publisher and editor 
of the paper for the last eight years and a Gator grad, said in an 
email to intern applicants this weekend that the paper will be 
closing due to financial struggles.
That this award-winning newspaper will no longer be 
printing is a great shame for the whole community.
The Herald embodies what a community newspaper is sup-
posed to be about. The paper is indomitable in local coverage.
For 60 years, the Herald has served the communities of 
High Springs, Alachua, Newberry and Fort White. Herald re-
porters have sat in on every City Commission meeting, met ev-
ery police chief and have been at every festival and fundraiser held by each Lion’s Club, Rotary Club and fire department. 
For many years, the Herald was the Alligator’s sister news-
paper, published by the same company, and more than a hand-
ful of Alligator editors and reporters have held internships 
there. Dupont has always been a regular at the journalism in-
ternship fairs, ready with a big smile for applicants and Herald 
internship alumni. 
The newspaper is practically a landmark. It is small, but Du-
pont and the paper are widely respected in newspaper circles.
We’re sure the announcement will shock many, as it 
shocked us. 
We encourage you all to stop and pick up an edition of 
the paper before it is too late. Read about how a corn maze in 
Newberry has helped save a family farm or how the City of 
Alachua plans to renovate the local recreation center.
The Editorial Board sends its best wishes to everyone at the 
North Florida Herald. The value of the service this paper has 
provided through the years cannot be measured. We are for -
ever thankful.
We thank Ronald Dupont for being a stalwart over the 
years. Many Alligator alums have gone on to great careers af-ter receiving his guidance. That guidance will be missed.
Because of his leadership, and because of the passion for 
journalism that lived in that newsroom, the feistiness of com-
munity journalism will not go away with the end of The North Florida Herald. 
Student loans should be harder to obtain
W   hen I was applying to college, I was fortunate 
enough to have plenty of options. I couldn’t wait 
to see what financial aid I would be able to get as 
that would decide where I went. Once the packages started rolling in, I saw that even though my family’s income was 
low, all I qualified for was lots of student loans as my par -
ents were frugal savers.  
I made a financial decision to attend UF. I didn’t look at 
the quality of undergrad programs at other schools because it was a moot point since I couldn’t afford them without 
taking out tens-of-thousands of dollars in student loans. 
Financial decisions like these happen every year, and the 
new changes proposed by the Obama administration make 
it easier and cheaper to get large student loans, making it 
easier than ever to mortgage your future. We should make 
student loans more difficult to obtain, not easier.
Some in the higher education community feel that ev-
eryone must have the opportunity to attend college. Despite having a massive conflict of interest, universities tell us that 
the only way we can be successful in life is to have the right 
degrees from the right brand-name schools. 
This attitude leads countless students picking up  ex-
tra master’s degrees because they just don’t have any idea what to do next. I would argue that one year of your life and 
$50,000 in the red is an expensive way to find yourself.
The alterations in the government’s student loan pro-
gram build on the changes enacted earlier in 2010 when the 
feds took away the right of banks to make student loans. 
Payments on some loans will be limited to 10 percent of 
discretionary income, and any outstanding balance after 20 
years of payments will be forgiven. Some members of Con-
gress are trying to cut the interest rate for these loans. 
At 6.8 percent next year, this debt is far lower than what 
one would pay on credit cards, but  also higher than what 
a family with good credit would have to pay on the private 
market, which is slowly dwindling due to government-run loans. 
These efforts sound eerily familiar to what the govern-
ment said about the right to own a home. Credit was made cheap with countless government programs and guarantees, and 
regulators encouraged banks to 
make risky subprime loans to ex-
tend credit to noncredit-worthy 
individuals. 
Government involvement 
in the student loan business is a dangerous development, espe-cially as total student-loan debt is 
approaching $1 trillion. 
Federal programs do not provide strong incentives for 
poorer people to take advantage of the abundant opportuni-ties for affordable higher education. UF is the best university 
in the state and should remain the destination of choice for 
students from modest means. Anthropology and sociology degrees are reasonable to study at a place like UF where 
you will be in debt up to $20,000 after graduation. ROTC 
should be encouraged as a route for students who want to 
attend more expensive colleges. Also, two-year community 
colleges are significantly cheaper and offer a great way for 
cash-strapped students to get a four-year college education. 
As a society , we must support the idea that success does 
not require any college degree; it’s the fire inside to be suc-cessful. I have no problem with students taking out debt, but 
why should we not require money down like with houses? 
We need students to realize how much money they are 
throwing away by attending a private, liberal arts college 
over a university . 
Furthermore, the government is making huge profits on 
charging students 6.8 percent on loans that cannot be dis-
charged in bankruptcy court while the government borrows 
that money at sub-3 percent rates. Government should not 
have rights like a business because its power is not limited. 
Relying on the private student loan market to fund higher 
education makes the student realize the full cost of his or her decision to not go to a public institution.

Cultural appropriation is inappropriate
Usually I laugh at the ignorance of your columnists, 
but the Alligator Editorial Board’s dismissal of the STARS 
campaign is a new low. 
You say, “If we can’t laugh at ourselves, can we really 
laugh at anything else?” 
Correction: Minorities are not dressing up as them-
selves for Halloween. Others, outside of those minority 
groups (primarily whites) are dressing up as minorities, 
which is a sign of their white privilege. 
This is called cultural appropriation. It is not cute, and 
it is not funny. You say, “Stereotypes have always been a subject of comedy.” 
Wow, is that really your masterful argument? Because it 
has occurred for so long makes it OK? Just because black-face has been used throughout history does not make it acceptable, nor are any other similar attempts of appro-
priating a culture through costume and makeup.
“We” are not laughing at ourselves; “you” are laughing 
at us and using our cultures as the punchlines. If a mar -
ginalized group is telling you that it is being offended or 
subjugated, then you, as the majority, should not dismiss 
them just because it is not an issue for you. 
Your privilege automatically makes the issue invisible to you, and they are attempting to bring it to your atten-
tion. So how about you stop and listen?
Race and ethnicity are not things that can be put on or 
taken off. Minorities can’t hang up a part of their identity 
in a closet. 
What is with this temporary fascination of others’ cul-
ture? What gives you the right to pretend for a night?

Tax-neutral plan can still fund Medicare and Social 
Security at current level
The following is a tax-neutral and nonpartisan way 
to continue funding Medicare and Social Security at the 
current level. I have suggested this to all members of the 
Congressional “Super Committee,” our senators and two 
local congressmen.
First, remove the upper limit of $106,800 for Social Se-
curity deductions on earnings. 
Second, allow an income tax credit for those additional 
deductions to make it tax-neutral. Then the maximum 
payment to these well-off retirees won’t need to increase.Third, the extra payroll tax money could allow a de-
crease in the percent paid into Social Security and an in-
crease in the percent to Medicare, which is underfunded.  
Finally, Medicare should require means testing for 
some items, such as scooters and other optional “medi-cal” devices.
All ages benefit from Social Security now. Before Social 
Security, the elderly frequently needed to live with and/
or be supported by younger family members.  
Which senior relative do you want living with you? 
This bit of “socialism” advances the goal of the Preamble 
to the Constitution to “promote the general welfare.” 
I don’t understand those who are trying to destroy this 
proven government benefit for ideological reasons.  The scare tactics being used on both seniors and our young are unconscionable.
One more deception that is being perpetrated should 
be addressed. 
Lower taxes have rarely encouraged more jobs because 
wages are tax-deductible to employers. They just encour -
age more greed.

As the month of October concluded, 
only a small minority of UF stu-dents and faculty took part in a 
major occurrence. Marking its 25th anni-versary, National Breast Cancer Aware-ness has worked to promote outreach to those living with breast cancer and influ-
ence the financing of research and grants 
toward a cure. 
In light of this, such a cure remains elu-
sive in spite of many organizations possess-ing some of the most brilliant minds ever to 
work toward a singular goal. As students, 
we all should give our time and effort to make breast cancer and all types of cancer the forefront of our own interest. 
It would take only a rudimentary look 
into cancer to conclude that its prevalence can hit women of all genders, racial or eth-nic orientations, financial standing, etc. 
The American Cancer Society produced 
its yearly estimates for new developments of breast cancer in the United States. 
As of 2011, over 230,000 new cases of 
invasive breast cancer will be diagnosed. 
In 2008, the National Cancer Institute pre-
sented several charts showing the inci-dences and mortality of breast cancer. It found that “although the rate of diagnosis of breast cancer increased in the 1990s, it 
has decreased since 2000, and the over -
all breast cancer death rate has dropped 
steadily.” 
Before we all gather with celebratory 
banter and rejoice, this was only present in women typically over the age of 50. 
To properly discuss how many differ -
ent variables and factors could contribute to breast cancer, perhaps another guest 
column is needed. 
There are a number of uncontrollable 
risk factors that put women at risk includ-
ing age, genetic predispositions, family 
history and other things. Lifestyle choices, 
having children, conducting breast feed-ing, usage of hormone therapy, physical activity, etc. all play a role in the occur -
rence of breast cancer. 
This does not even scratch the surface 
of environmental factors such as smoking, exposure to pollution, background radia-tion, etc. 
Instead of listing facts and figures, let 
me keep this point succinct. There will be women who touch our lives who will devel-
op some form 
of cancer, and 
we must remain both knowledgeable and vigilant in our health management. 
In an overview of my own personal 
family history, I know the pain of losing others to cancer.
 I never had a chance to meet my ma-
ternal grandfather, Stephen Milien. He 
saw his own life extinguished from pros-
tate cancer about age 74 in February 1992. Despite having a bilateral orchiectomy (re-moval of both testicles), he withered away 
and died in the company of our family. 
My maternal grandmother, Cleante 
Dupuy, passed away from breast cancer 
in 2000. On a Sunday in 1998, she had ar -
ranged for her church visit in Brooklyn 
with my mother. Noticing a hard spot on 
her right breast, she had a biopsy conduct-ed the following week. 
The test revealed that not only did she 
have cancer, but it had already metasta-sized. The next two years were horrible on my family as she became an empty shell. 
She slowly faded away because of ex-
tensive chemotherapy, along with a double 
mastectomy. My grandmother died Sept. 
25, 2000, from stage IV breast cancer that had metastasized to her bones and liver. 
All of us have an obligation as students, 
teachers and family members to strongly take into consideration the long reach of cancer. 
Women in their 20s and 30s should have 
a periodic clinical breast exam every three 
years. Women in their 40s onward should 
have a mammogram screening every year. 
This is often prohibitively expensive 
for lower-income women, and much more 
must be done to reduce costs and cover 
screenings. 
When the last day of October concludes, 
we should not rest in ambivalence or igno-rance to the facts. 
To the contrary, we must assume vigi-
lance in doing everything to reduce the oc-currences of breast cancer and remain on task in regard to our health.

Speaking OutMEREDITH RUTLAND
Alligator Staff Writer
Matthew Carroll sat up straight 
and looked at his employees.
Around him sat two other staff 
members and a co-founder for 
Niche Mobile, a Gainesville app-
making business.
“We’ve got to be serious about 
what these projects will entail,” he 
said.
Fresh into the adult world and 
unsatisfied with the prospects of entry-level programming, Carroll and his co-founder Garrett Strobel, both UF alumni, have started their 
own business. They’re set to launch 
their newest, and so far biggest, app this winter: Dub Studio, a user-friendly music maker.
The rise of mobile devices in the 
past few years has driven Carroll and Strobel to cash in on a digital boom. 
They said they feel Niche Mo-
bile has the potential to grow from a small technology startup to become part of the big leagues, just like Fa-cebook did and Apple before it.
“This new frontier is open to all 
these people,” Strobel said. “I love exploring the possibilities.”
Strobel, 26, and Carroll, 23, start-
ed Niche Mobile at the beginning of this summer. 
Since then, they’ve pumped out 
five apps for Android products — Gator Parking, Who Data?!, Wub-dub Dubstep Generator, Loop ‘N’ Go and Dubstep Wobble Bass. The 
apps range from a parking locator 
for UF’s campus and several Dub-step sound generators that give off wobbly, base-heavy music.
“The first one that puts us on the 
map — we’re both still waiting on 
that,” Carroll said.
The company of about 10 people 
meets in the office of music-stream-
ing business Grooveshark while it’s saving up for its own office space and working off a “shoestring bud-get,” Strobel said.
Sitting at a borrowed wooden 
table, Carroll explains he’s not in this business to get filthy rich.
“The reason I think we’re here 
isn’t so much business reasons but realizing our own goals,” Car -
roll said. “If there’s ever a time in your life to try something risky, it’s now.”
Starting a business may be hard, 
but he’s not going to give up this dream without a fight, he said. He’s been working toward it since he was a preteen.
Growing up in DeLand, Carroll 
coded his first website when he was 12. He was hooked. 
From there, he taught himself 
HTML, CSS and Flash. High school brought IB and AP programming classes and competitions.
From there, he earned bachelor’s 
degrees at UF in mathematics and computer science.
He’ll graduate from UF’s mas-
ter’s of digital arts and sciences program in May.
Carroll said he’s glad he’s been a 
part of the master’s program, but he also is excited to graduate so he can focus on making apps.
He picked up his Motorola Droid 
X and loaded one of Niche Mobile’s apps, Gator Parking.
Speaking about the apps he cod-
ed, he leaned forward and waved his hand around the phone. 
Facing the phone away from 
himself, he pointed to features that tell the user where he or she can park on campus and hovered his hand over the glowing screen as he spoke.
Strobel, who sports a short, 
trimmed beard and mustache, sat next to him. He smiled when he talked about the creativity of their 
business.
Every new skill thrills him, Stro-
bel said, because it puts him one 
step closer to a finished product.
“Some people, I think, just love 
to make and create stuff,” he said. “My whole life I’ve realized I’ve been in love with ideas.”
Strobel, a Boca Raton native, was 
attracted to biology in high school, but he was soon drawn to art in col-lege. He created moving sculptures with pulleys and metal levers.
“It was about imagining things 
and figuring out how that thing is important and realizing it into a fin-ished product,” he said.
As he got closer to his senior 
year, he realized he was interested in programming. 
He learned to create a Breatha-
lyzer that sent drunken updates to Twitter and a heart monitor that emitted ultrasonic signals when the subject’s heartbeat raced.
He earned a bachelor’s degree 
from UF and graduated from UF’s 
master’s program in digital arts and 
sciences this past summer. 
The duo met in the master’s 
program and both took classes at Grooveshark University,  designed to teach young entrepreneurs how to create, market and sell mobile products.
From there, Niche Mobile was 
born. 
So they meet up with their staff 
every week — even on UF game-days — to prepare and coordinate. They discussed coding the way a football coach talks about offensive plays: with straight, serious faces and detailed diagrams so everyone can visualize the final product.Sometimes they’ll hit a road-
block, such as a piece of code that 
doesn’t work the way it should. 
But Strobel said that’s all part of the process.“None of us are experts on this,” 
Strobel said to a staff member. “I 
don’t have these answers for you.”
“We’ll just do the best we can,” 
Carroll said.8, ALLIGATOR §  MONDAY, OCTOBER 31, 2011

Murray hooked up with Tavarres 
King, who hauled in the 14-yard score over sophomore Jaylen Watkins.
“We had a couple third-down, 
fourth-down stops that we need-ed to make and we didn’t come up with those,” Howard said. 
“That’s all a part of growing 
up as a defense and as a team. We 
will.”
Outside of his fourth-down 
heroics, however, Murray was ha-
rassed by the Gators. The sopho-
more entered Saturday’s game 
averaging 236.1 passing yards per 
game, second in the Southeastern Conference. Against Florida, he managed 169 yards.
Also, Murray only completed 
44 percent of his passes — 17 points below his season average.
But it was Georgia’s running 
game, and Florida’s inability to 
stop it late, that put the game 
away.
Clinging to a 20-17 lead early 
in the fourth quarter, the Gators 
surrendered 30 yards on five car -
ries, ending with a 4-yard touch-
down run by Richard Samuel.
After Florida’s offense came 
up short on three drives in the final quarter, Georgia milked the last 5:32 off the clock, running the 
ball eight times for 35 yards. The 
drive ended 1 yard from the end zone, stopped only because the clock struck 0:00.
“I wasn’t in so I wouldn’t 
know,” defensive end Leon Orr said when asked about the last drive. 
“But it’s all about us knuck-
ling up, and when those opportu-nities come they’ve just got to go in there and execute.”

opportunities from UF’s 
struggles on serve receive and defense.
“We held them to .227, so 
we out-hit them by 50 points, which we’ve had multiple 
games like that,” Boos said. 
“Friday night was the first time we’ve gotten out-hit by 
someone, so hitting numbers 
aren’t really what winning the match is about.”
Although Florida struggled 
as a unit, the Gators did see a 
starring performance from 
sophomore Chloe Mann.
Mann started in place of 
senior Cassandra Anderson at middle blocker and finished 
with a career-high 10 kills. 
The Gainesville native also 
notched two solo blocks, five 
block assists and seven digs.
“You can’t be happier for 
Chloe,” Boos said. “She’s a player that not many people 
have seen play. She’s a real tal-
ent. … To be honest we didn’t get the ball to her enough be-
cause of our ball control. She 
probably would have left here with 15 or 20 kills if we got the ball to her more.” 
With hopes for an SEC title 
gone, Florida is now just look-ing to regroup and finish this season as best it can. The team 
will play again Friday at home 
against Alabama at 4 p.m.
“The biggest thing is that 
this weekend was a little bit of 
rattler,” Boos said. “You have 
to come back from this men-
tally. 
“We have to go back to 
the drawing board a little bit 
and get our confidence back. 
We’re a little bit inconsistent 
with our confidence match to 
match and set to set, and we have to improve on that.” MONDAY, OCTOBER 31, 2011 § ALLIGATOR, 13

Jaylen Watkins and aided the Bulldogs’ 
game-winning touchdown drive.
Later, a call against Roberson gave Geor -
gia a conversion on third and 4 and allowed the Bulldogs to run out the clock. UF’s other fouls were the type of undis-
ciplined penalties Muschamp has preached avoiding throughout the season. Florida was called for a pair of 15-yard facemasks, and sophomore Ronald Powell committed 
a personal foul when blocking on a UGA 
punt that went out of bounds. 
Clearly frustrated after a season of ques-tions about penalties and discipline, Mus-
champ offered a simple answer Saturday.
“ D i s a p p o i n t e d 
with it,” he said.
Only adding to 
the aggravation were 
expectations that a bye week would help 
Florida regroup. Instead, it’s back to the drawing board. 
“I thought we were going to correct those 
in practice,” Hunter said. “We worked on different cadences and things for our de-fense of getting used to that kind of stuff. … Tonight it just didn’t happen the way we wanted it to.”

JACKSONVILLE — The score-
board said Georgia beat Florida, 
but in many ways the Gators were responsible for their own down-fall. 
As has been the case all season, 
UF struggled with penalties and turnovers in Saturday’s 24-20 loss to UGA. 
“We’re really beating ourselves 
right now with these penalties and these foolish turnovers,” ju-nior defensive tackle Omar Hunt-er said. “That’s something we’ve 
got to get better at.”
Florida’s two giveaways led 
to 14 Georgia points, as a pair of fumbles set the Bulldogs up in 
prime scoring position. 
Senior running back Chris 
Rainey’s second-quarter fumble gave UGA possession at UF’s 25-yard line. The error led to a 20-yard touchdown pass from Aaron Murray to Michael Bennett that cut UF’s lead to 17-10. 
In the third quarter, junior wide 
receiver Frankie Hammond’s fumble gave Georgia the ball at the Florida 18. Four plays later, a 14-yard pass from Murray to Tav-arres King tied the game at 17. 
“We just had some critical mis-takes in critical times,” coach Will Muschamp said. 
Although Marcus Roberson’s 
first-quarter interception ended a streak of 13 quarters without a turnover, the Gators matched their season average with a mi-nus-1 turnover margin. On the year, Florida has a mi-
nus-8 margin which ranks 114th nationally and last in the South-eastern Conference.
UF also continued to burn itself 
with penalties, a problem that was evident from a holding call on the opening kick. For the game, the Gators recorded 14 fouls for 106 yards. 
Their 9.38 penalties per game 
mark is the most in the nation, and their 70.88 yards per game average in penalties is No. 115 na-
tionally. 
Noise was attributed as a factor 
in those struggles, as Jonotthan 
Harrison said there were times when he couldn’t hear redshirt senior quarterback John Brantley over the crowd of 84,524. 
The Gators committed four 
false starts and were flagged three 
times for delay of game. 
Muschamp has also, on numer -
ous occasions, cited a lack of disci-
pline as a reason for UF’s penalty struggles this season. 
“It could be mixture of those,” 
Brantley said. “That crowd could have had a factor when we were backed up in our territory. You’re 
closer to the fans.”
The Gators were also flagged 
for a pair of fourth-quarter pass interference penalties. The first 
was on sophomore cornerback

After a disappointing four-set loss 
to No. 20 Tennessee on Friday, the 
No. 13 Florida volleyball team was just shooting for a win Sunday against Kentucky in Lexington.
But the No. 24 Wildcats were look-
ing to make the Gators’ recent loss into a road-trip trend.
In a five-set back-and-forth battle, 
Florida once again struggled with its play from first contact and dropped its second match in a row to a Southeast-ern Conference opponent, 3-2 (25-23, 19-25, 25-21, 17-25, 15-9).
“Whoever was leading the ball con-
trol was winning the match,” Florida associate head coach Dave Boos said. “When we can’t win the ball-control game, we’re going to have a problem, and we obviously didn’t make enough plays there at the end.”
Despite strong ef-
forts from a varied lineup in convincing wins in the second and fourth sets, Flor -
ida (17-5, 10-3 SEC) now holds a 0-5 re-cord when dropping the first set.
Although the Gators outdid the 
Wildcats (21-4, 12-2 SEC) with their .276 hitting efficiency, Kentucky’s offense took advantage of multiple      Gators fall to Wildcats,

JACKSONVILLE — John Brantley played 
like he didn’t have a right ankle, and it al-
most cost Florida’s defense its lungs.
With Brantley unable to take snaps un-
der center, the Gators’ running attack was nonexistent, forcing Florida’s defense to stay on the field for 37:40 in the 24-20 loss Saturday.
While defensive players said that they 
weren’t tired, that they kept going strong even as the offense struggled to maintain possession, the unit clearly slowed down as the game wore on.
No. 22 Georgia leaned on its running at-
tack all afternoon, gaining 185 yards on 49 carries. UGA held the ball for 20:56 in the second half. UF had possession for 9:04. 
Florida, meanwhile, finished with nega-
tive-19 yards on 22 running plays — six of them sacks on Brantley. Running backs Chris Rainey and Jeff Demps combined for 38 yards on 13 carries.
“They had a good offensive line,” senior 
defensive tackle Jaye Howard said. “Their center, (Ben) Jones: He’s a great center. He did a good job; we were battling him all night. I feel like they just executed and we couldn’t.”
In particular, the Bulldogs executed on 
fourth downs, which proved to be the back-breaker in what was overall a solid effort from the Gators’ defense. 
On fourth and 5 
from the Florida 20-yard line, Georgia quarterback Aaron Murray found Mi-
chael Bennett in the end zone on a fade pass over freshman De’Ante Saunders, cut-ting Florida’s early lead to 17-10 with 1:28 left in the second quarter. 
The Bulldogs later tied the game, again 
on a fourth-down fade pass. This time, Defense hung out to dry as

Florida offense can’t overcome 
mistakes, missed opportunities
pass of the day to running back Jeff Demps 
for a 72-yard gain on a screen play, and also put the Gators on the board first with a 31-yard pass on fourth and 19 to tight end Jor -
dan Reed.
Despite the valiant effort on one good 
leg, Brantley struggled, completing just 12 of 34 passes for 245 yards — 226 of which came in the first half. Still, Florida went into the break with a 17-10 lead thanks to the Reed touchdown, a Brad Phillips field goal and a Jeff Demps 99-yard kick return touchdown.
“We started out fast, and we started out 
good,” Brantley said. “We’ve just got to be able to finish the game.”
But the Gators weren’t able to finish, as 
they couldn’t get anything started after half-time.
In the second half, Brantley connected on 
just 2 of his 14 attempts, and the offense was unable to move the ball, collecting one first down after the break.
While Brantley struggled, he didn’t get 
much help from the rest of his team.
Receivers dropped passes, most notably 
one that would have been a touchdown by Chris Rainey early in the game. The run game was nonexistent, as the Gators were stuffed for minus-19 yards on 22 rushes. The team committed 14 penalties for 106 yards. And most of all, UF’s pass protection 
broke down time and time again. 
Brantley was sacked six times against 
Georgia, including four by Bulldogs line-
backer Jarvis Jones. The last came on a fourth-and-10 play on the Gators’ final pos-session with the Bulldogs leading 24-20, es-sentially sealing the game for Georgia.
“Jarvis is a good player,” Muschamp 
said. “He’s their best rusher. … But again, in those situations, that’s why you’ve got to be able to have some sort of run game to slow down the rush.”
While the Gators couldn’t establish a 
ground game out of shotgun, they were also unable to capitalize on prime field po-sition. Four times Florida started a drive in Georgia territory , but the Gators only had a 
field goal and minus-24 yards on 14 plays to 
show for it.
“Those are very frustrating to deal with,” 
Muschamp said. “We had our opportuni-
ties the last two ball-games. We’ve got to close it out and win those games.”
The only thing the Gators were able to 
close out Saturday was a winless October, and now they are spectators as Georgia and South Carolina vie for what were once Flor -
ida’s goals: the division crown and a shot at the SEC title.
Instead, the Gators are left simply play-
ing for pride.
With four games on the schedule, UF 
needs to win two to become bowl eligible 
and try to salvage a sinking season.
“Everyone is taking it hard, it’s four 
games in a row that we lost,” defensive 
tackle Jaye Howard said. “One thing we can do is keep the team … motivated and keep pushing. The season is not over; we can go out and win and get a good bowl game, so that’s what we’re playing for right now.”

played one more game. After again losing the takeaway battle 
against the Bulldogs, the Gators are 114th in turnover margin at minus-8. For all the talk of creating a ball-hawking unit, the defense has only forced eight turnovers, which is 112th in the nation. 
In four wins, Florida averaged 259 yards rushing. In four 
losses, including Saturday’s negative-19 showing, that num-ber has shrunk to 43.75. 
That’s not a typo.The Gators are 111th in third-down conversion percentage. 
They are 96th in passing offense and 94th in total offense. 
Anyway you look at it, this offense is plain terrible. It racked up one first down in the second half of Saturday’s loss. After the first two series, Florida did not have a drive of longer than 35 yards and had nine that went for less than 10. 
This team has played so poorly that its best hope of putting 
points on the board is to allow the opponent to score and hope Jeff Demps (when he’s actually healthy) or Andre Debose can break the kickoff return for a touchdown.
In one of the few statistical categories where they actually 
rank near the top, the Gators are eighth in the country in kick-off return average and are tied with seven others for the most return touchdowns with two. 
It doesn’t matter if the offensive coordinator is in the booth, 
or if John Brantley is the quarterback instead of a freshman. The problem with the Gators’ offense is not Charlie Weis or the play-calling — it’s the personnel. 
And for the rest of this season, at least, help is not on the way.  
Saturday’s pathetic showing was just the latest in a line of poor performances, and now Muschamp’s first enduring memory as the head coach at Florida will be as the guy who lost four straight in October. 
And it’s not over yet. There’s more history to be made, as a 
tough Vanderbilt team comes into The Swamp next Saturday fresh off pushing No. 8 Arkansas to the limit.
Should Florida lose that game, it would be the first time 
UF has lost to Vandy since 1988 and only the second time ever at home. 
With a loss, not only would Muschamp’s Gators become 
the first to lose five straight since Florida dropped every game in 1979, it would also mean that Florida would be in serious danger of not qualifying for a bowl game for the first time since that same season. 
Quite a way to usher in that new era.

The Gators are in an unfamiliar 
situation because of familiar prob-
lems.
For the first time since 2005, No. 
18 Florida (14-6, 7-4 Southeastern 
Conference) will not enter the SEC 
Tournament as the top seed after failing to clinch a share of the con-ference title Friday night when it fell behind early and lost to No. 22 South Carolina (15-5, 9-2 SEC) 2-1 at Pressly Stadium.
The Gators will enter the tour -
nament in Orange Beach, Ala., on 
Wednesday as the No. 4 seed and 
will play fifth-seeded Georgia in the first round. Florida has made it to at least the second round each of the last five seasons, but lost to Auburn in the opening round in 2005 as the No. 3 seed.
The loss Friday encapsulated 
many of the Gators’ biggest strug-
gles of late, including giving up 
early goals and the inability to sub-sequently play from behind. 
“It’s just a broken record,” coach 
Becky Burleigh said.
The Gamecocks first struck in the 
third minute when senior Kortney Rhoades played the ball through the attacking third. Gators center back 
Kat Williamson was unable to cor -
ral it and South Carolina’s leading 
scorer, Kayla Grimsley , controlled it and put it past the left of a diving Taylor Burke from 9 yards out.It was the fourth time in confer -
ence play that Florida gave up a goal in the first five minutes of the game, and the seventh SEC game in which it failed to score first.
“We just need to start better all-
around,” Williamson said.
In the 22nd minute, the Game-
cocks’ lead was extended to two when defender Christa Neary crossed the ball through the middle of the Gators’ box and midfielder Danielle Au placed a perfect head-er in the top-left corner of the net 
from 16 yards out, just over the out-
stretched arms of a leaping Burke.
“Until we figure out how to stop 
giving up soft goals, we will contin-ue to chase games,” Burleigh said.
The Gators were able to cut the 
deficit in half in the 36th minute when senior forward Tahnai Annis headed in a cross from freshman 
center back Annie Bobbitt. 
But Burleigh wants her team to 
find offensive cohesiveness earlier 
in games.
“It’s too little, too late some-
times,” Burleigh said. “We start out tentatively . We gave up the early goal, then we started getting all over them.”
After gaining the lead, South 
Carolina was able to play a bunker on defense, a defensive strategy that has given Florida trouble through-out conference play.
“They started collapsing toward
