Lily Olsthoorn
Lily Olsthoorn 
shaved her head 
during the first few 
months of the CO -
VID-19 pandemic. It 
was an eventful time 
in her life, she said. 
In the homestretch of 
her high school senior 
year, she was waiting 
on college decisions, 
preparing for a water 
polo competition and 
dealing with a break -
up — all while the 
world was entering a 
global pandemic.
“The pandemic 
was pretty much a catalyst for a lot of healing. Even though 
it’s the opposite of what you’d expect, I feel like I’m giving 
myself more chances for my mental health to get better,” 
the 19-year-old UF undeclared freshman said. “So overall, 
I’d say it’s been positive for me.”
Olsthoorn’s two older brothers are UF alumni, and she 
remembers the energy of the school when she visited them 
here five years ago. The memory is preserved in her head as a reminder of the way things used to be, but she can’t 
fathom experiencing the UF that way herself.
“In the last couple months, I’ve been really trying so 
hard to meet people,” Olsthoorn said. “And I feel like I’ve 
gotten a little bit better at talking one-on-one, but when I’m 
going to be back in like a big social setting, I won’t know how to act just because it’s been so long.”
Melody Palmer
Melody Palmer 
remembers stand -
ing in line for Chi -
potle when she read 
an email from UF 
informing students 
classes would transi -
tion online. She re -
membered thinking if 
all classes would end 
up online, she would 
just go home to Port 
Orange, Florida.
While home, the 
20-year-old UF sus -
tainability studies 
sophomore lived 
with her 97-year-old 
grandfather. Due to her grandfather being at increased risk, 
she was cautious about leaving the house for his safety and 
avoided it as much as possible.
“I think I’ve lost a lot of respect for some people dur -
ing the pandemic, just by seeing the people who like to go 
out,” Palmer said. “I don’t know if I can view you in the 
same way.”
Alexandra Quintana
Alexandra Quin -
tana said the first 
few months of the 
COVID-19 pandem -
ic allowed her to 
take a break from 
being stuck in a 
routine and reflect 
on herself and the 
world around her.
“I feel like I’m a 
completely differ -
ent person,” Quin -
tana, a 19-year-old 
UF political sci -
ence sophomore, 
said. “I feel like we 
all are. I feel like 
there’s no way we 
could be the same 
after that.”
After they were sent home from UF, she and her friend 
Gabrielle Adekunle created Take Action Florida, where she 
is currently the vice president. The lobbying organization, 
which focuses on education and activism on different so -
cial issues, will focus on gender and sexuality issues for 
Women’s History Month.
“I feel like that’s why the movement like the Black Lives 
Matter movement picked up when it did because we were 
all just really empathetic and understanding at that time,” 
Quintana said. “We had nothing else to do but sit down 
and listen.”One year later: The COVID-19 pandemic

Twelve months. Three semesters. One atypical year.
March 11 marks the first anniversary of when CO -
VID-19 –– a deadly virus sweeping the world –– shut 
down our campus. On that day in 2020, UF President 
Kent Fuchs emailed students notifying them that all 
classes would be online starting March 16 and encour -
aging them to leave town. It was a moment that would 
change the course of the next year, and for many, their 
entire college experience.
With scheduled in-person graduations and wide -
spread vaccine promises, UF administration is begin -
ning to discuss a return to normalcy.
But nearly 250 people in Alachua County have died 
with COVID-19 complications, according to The New 
York Times. Grandparents hugged their grandchildren 
through plastic tarps; life milestones were reduced 
to drive-thru services; and people died alone after 
exchanging final goodbyes over FaceTime. No matter 
what life looks like post-pandemic, one thing is certain: 
Those who perished won’t be here to see it.
Students have altered their lives to follow social 
distancing protocols, stressed over online classes and 
attended club meetings over Zoom. Outside the class -
room, they missed packing Saturdays in The Swamp, 
crossing the stage in a cap and gown, loading buses 
to formals and spending Starbucks-fueled all-nighters 
in the library. A year later, UF students reflect on the 
impact of the past year. While some talk about their 
return to an empty campus, others explain how their 
college memories have been confined to computer 
screens and kitchen tables.T oday’s Weather

352-376-4458 • Fax: 352-376-4467 NEWSROOM:DEPUTIES RESPONDED TO 
CALLS ABOUT GUNFIRE IN 
EAST GAINESVILLE
By Chasity Maynard 
Alligator Staff Writer 
Alachua County Sheriff’s Of -
fice deputies shot and killed a 
person during a shoot-out in East 
Gainesville Friday.
At about 4:07 p.m., ACSO depu -
ties arrived at 2325 SE 46th Ter -
race, a house near Eastside High 
School, after they received a call 
about gunshots, sheriff’s office 
spokesperson Sgt. Frank Kinsey 
said. 
When deputies arrived, some -
one began shooting at them, he 
said. Multiple deputies shot back, 
and the person was shot and killed. 
ACSO spokesperson Art Forgey 
said the department would not re -
lease names or details on the indi -
vidual or deputies involved as of 
Sunday evening. 
Deputies found another person 
at the scene of the shooting with 
a non-life-threatening gunshot 
wound, and that person was taken 
to a local hospital, according to For -
gey. It is unclear how many times 
they were shot, and their condition 
is unknown as of Sunday evening. 
Josh Vaughn, who has rented 
a house on Southeast 46th Terrace 
for about two years, saw and re -
corded some of the incident on his 
phone. 
When Vaughn pulled onto the 
street on his way home Friday af -
ternoon, he said he saw a woman 
running down Southeast 46th Ter -
race who seemed hysterical and 
kept looking over her shoulder. He 
offered to help her.
The woman told Vaughn her 
son shot her, and she pulled down 
her shirt to reveal a gunshot wound 
on her shoulder, he said. She ap -
peared to be running from a man 
in his late 20s or early 30s who was 
farther down the road. 
The woman asked to use 
Vaughn’s phone to call her other 
son, he said, but the call went to 
voicemail. 
The man began running through 
neighbors’ backyards, Vaughn 
said. Within minutes, police flood -ed the street and found the man. 
It was unclear who began shoot -
ing first, but Vaughn heard several 
gunshots and the woman pleaded 
for the police not to kill her son. 
“She was screaming for the po -
lice ‘not to kill my son, don’t kill 
my son,’” Vaughn said.
He eventually saw officials carry 
away the man’s limp body, he said.
Vaughn recognized the woman 
and the man she called her son, 
he said, but does not know their 
names. He’s seen them in the 
neighborhood, and he believes the 
man’s partner gave birth in the last 
few weeks. 
The deputies involved in the 
shooting have been placed on paid 
leave per department policy while 
the Florida Department of Law En -
forcement and the ACSO Office of 
Professional Standards investigate 
the deputies’ actions, Forgey said. 
The sheriff can allow the deputies 
to return to work, he said, but they 
cannot respond to calls until the in -
vestigations close. 
In 2016, ACSO was involved in 
the police killing of Robert Dent -
mond , a 16-year-old who called 
911 to say he was suicidal and 
was later shot while carrying a 
replica assault rifle. A grand jury 
determined the teen’s death was 
justified later that year. An ACSO 
deputy also shot and killed 39-year-
old Gino Martin Palazzollo in 2017, 
who they said refused to drop his 
gun.Kinsey said deputies were not 
wearing body cameras Friday, but 
ACSO will review footage from the 
vehicles’ dashboard cameras.
The Florida Highway Patrol and 
Gainesville Police Department ar -
rived to help ACSO, with dozens 
of law enforcement vehicles sur -
rounding the site. The scene was 
cleared by Saturday. FDLE will fur -
ther investigate the shooting. 
As of Sunday night, there is no 
threat to the public and the crime 
scene is clear.
ACSO will hold a news confer -
ence Monday to release more infor -
mation on the investigation, Forgey 
said.

THE WINDOW RUNS FROM MARCH 5-13 
AT FOUR LOCATIONS
By Jack Prator
Alligator Staff Writer 
Early voting in Gainesville for the 2021 Regular 
Election began March 5 and runs until March 13.
Commissioner Gail Johnson faces Gabriel Hil -
lel for Gainesville’s At-Large B seat and Commis -
sioner Gigi Simmons comes up against Desmon 
Duncan-Walker for the District 1 seat.
Voters can go in person to vote early from 9 
a.m. to 6 p.m. at four locations: the Supervisor of 
Elections Office, the Millhopper Branch Library, 
the Reitz Union and the Martin Luther King Jr. 
Multipurpose Center. 
Masks are encouraged, but not mandatory, at 
the county elections office. But UF issued a re -minder in February that masks are required for 
voters at the Reitz Union. CDC guidelines for social 
distancing will be observed in both polling loca -
tions. 
Per Florida law, photo and signature identifica -
tion is required to vote. A Florida driver's license, 
Florida identification card, passport, debit or credit 
card, military identification, student identification, 
retirement center identification, neighborhood as -
sociation identification or public assistance identi -
fication can be used to vote.
This will be the last city election to be held on 
its own. In 2018, Gainesville voted to hold city and 
county commission elections together in August 
and November starting next year.
A sample ballot is available on the Alachua 
County voting website.

CLASSES, FRIENDSHIPS AND 
CAMPUS LIFE HAVE TRANSFORMED 
IN THE LAST YEAR
By J.P . Oprison and Sofia Echeverry
Alligator Staff Writer
Nearly a year after the COVID-19 pan -
demic spread to UF and caused a campus 
shutdown, students are still grappling with 
the challenges of the last year and ongoing 
restrictions.
In the middle of the Spring 2020 semes -
ter, students and professors were uprooted 
from their regular routines and sent away 
from campus. Since then, they’ve had to 
adapt to online classes, semester reopening 
plans that professors continue to debate, 
new safety precautions and finally the roll -
out of vaccines. 
But the changes haven’t been easy. Vir -
tual graduations, reduced capacity at foot -
ball games and the rise and fall of COVID-19 
cases have made for a tough past year. 
Many students have had to navigate ques -
tionable quarantine procedures, the loss of 
2021’s Spring Break and study abroad can -
cellations. 
Sihini Atalugama said she’s met about 
10 new people since starting college — an 
unheard-of low for her.
“I know for sure that if it were a normal 
semester I would’ve made so many more 
friends,” the 19-year-old UF microbiology 
freshman said. “I definitely would’ve met 
and connected with a lot more.”
Atalugama lived in Hume Hall in Fall 
2020, but moved back home after Thanks -
giving and is taking classes online during 
Spring because of health concerns. She’s 
at high risk for permanent lung damage if 
she gets COVID-19 because of a history of 
chronic bronchitis and asthma.
Although she misses seeing her friends, 
Atalugama said she appreciates the alone 
time self-isolation has granted her. Sepa -
rated from her peers, she said she is able to 
focus on herself.
“When it’s just me and my laptop, I defi -
nitely have a lot more time to think about 
what I prioritize, what’s best for my person -al health, and work through anything that’s 
stressing me out,” she said.
Her parents and brother are also working 
or attending school from home, she said, so 
she tries to play her part in helping her fam -
ily maintain the separation of home life and 
work life.
“I saw this Tweet, ‘it’s not working from 
home, it’s actually living at work,’ so it’s 
really important that we don’t abandon the 
mindset that this is still our house,” she 
said. 
She said she encourages her family to 
take breaks and open the windows when 
the weather is nice. She tries to make their 
situation feel like summer with an added re -
sponsibility instead of “living at work,” she 
said. 
Atalugama said she doesn’t know what 
typical college life is, so she appreciates 
upperclassmen being sympathetic to the 
unique struggle of starting college during a 
pandemic.
Even after she enters private spaces, Ri -
ley Aceto forgets to take her mask off; it’s 
become a habit for the 19-year-old UF ap -
plied physiology and kinesiology freshman 
to keep her nose and mouth covered. 
Although attending class over Zoom has 
made her into an auditory learner, Aceto 
said, she has struggled with her classes. 
She’s only been a college student during the 
pandemic, so she doesn’t know whether her 
academic struggles are due to the difficul -
ties of college or online learning. 
“I don’t feel like I’ve learned anything in 
a year,” she said. “I haven’t been in a single 
UF classroom — ever.” 
Aceto started college in Fall 2020. When 
she moved to campus, she felt UF’s virus 
safety precautions, such as limiting dorm 
guests to one at a time, would make it hard -
er to meet people. 
Because of this, Aceto decided to join a 
sorority and became a sister in Alpha Omi -
cron Pi in Fall 2020.
Mayra Acosta, on the other hand, said 
she enjoys online classes.
“I’m an introvert, so I enjoy just wak -
ing up and going into classes,” the 22-year-
old UF animal sciences senior said. “When 
professors have recorded lectures, it’s even better, because I can just watch it on my 
own time.”
Though Acosta feels like her academic 
performance has improved in online class -
es, she said there have also been challenges.
“I would say the most challenging thing 
is motivating me to go outside and get some 
form of exercise, just because it can be dif -
ficult just being all day at home, sitting in 
front of a computer,” Acosta said.
As a transfer student, Acosta said she 
spent only one semester at UF before the 
pandemic hit. She still hasn’t been to a 
Gators football game nor the many activi -
ties or events on campus, she said.
“I wish I would have been here as a 
four-year student,” Acosta said. “That way, 
I could have experienced all of those typical 
things that Gators do, rather than transfer -
ring in.”
Isabella Tassistro, a 21-year-old UF psy -
chology junior, hasn’t had an in-person 
class since last Spring. While it’s convenient 
not having to travel between home and 
class, she said, she’s had a mostly negative 
experience with online classes, as it’s hard 
to leave her apartment.
“It’s just hard to get out if you don’t al -
ready have an excuse to get out,” Tassis -
tro said. “And it’s hard to focus in Zoom 
classes compared to being there in person.”
She misses traditional college experienc -
es — hanging out and studying with friends, 
walking around campus and grabbing 
Krishna lunch at the Plaza of the Americas. 
Before the pandemic, it was easier to meet 
up with friends, she said. But now, foresight 
and planning are often involved to ensure 
everyone has been safe.
She’s had to distance herself from friends 
she has looser ties to because she felt the 
need to limit the number of people she regu -
larly interacts with, she said.
“I have reduced my circle of friends that 
I actually see just because I can’t be seeing 
all these people for COVID spread reasons,” 
Tassistro said.
After the pandemic, Tassistro hopes UF 
keeps its procedures like hand-sanitizing 
stations and a mask requirement on cam -
pus.
Like Tassistro, Aubrey Mys also has to teach and motivate herself to stay on track 
with online classes.
“There are the professors available 
sometimes for office hours and such, but it 
isn’t the same,” the 20-year-old UF psychol -
ogy and sociology junior said.
Certain classes are easier for her online 
and save her time, such as sociology- or 
elective-based classes that are more as -
signment-based and in which the material 
comes more easily. But she said for classes 
like human anatomy or math- and science-
based classes, she has to motivate herself to 
read the material, teach herself the concepts 
and watch the lectures from the professors. 
But no matter the class, she feels like 
more work is involved with online learning.
“I feel like, especially with being home 
and having other responsibilities, your 
workload never seems to end,” Mys said.
Despite the pandemic, Mys is doing 
health care disparity research for her major, 
which is something she’s always wanted to 
do. But with everything going virtual, she 
worries other students may struggle to get 
involved. 
She said she worries she will lose some 
of the virtual opportunities she has gained 
during the pandemic as everything returns 
to normal. She explained her situation to 
the UF undergraduate research program and 
was able to be connected to the right oppor -
tunities through there. She wrote in a text 
that she’s now working closely with the UF 
Center for Undergraduate Research.
“I’ve been lucky in the sense that I’ve 
been able to navigate around it a little bit, 
and I’m still able to do research completely 
virtually and participate in a lot of activities 
virtually,” Mys said. 
Given the circumstances, Mys advised 
students to try to make the best of their col -
lege experiences anyway.
“It might not be ideal or what you 
thought college will be but still try to create 
those opportunities for yourself,” Mys said. 
“It’s just trying to reach out, have those 
connections and continue to try to make a 
college experience for yourself, whatever 
that might look like.”

a n d  M o r e !      Isabela Martinez-Moure 
Isabela Martinez-Moure remem -
bers waking up with heavy breath -
ing after having nightmares that she 
hadn’t graduated from high school.
“I was lacking closure so much 
that my brain couldn’t process that 
I was done,” the 19-year-old UF 
business administration freshman 
said.
As a high school senior, she was 
very involved, working on events for 
student government and leading as 
captain of her school’s sailing team. 
She regrets never saying goodbye to her teachers and coaches.
Martinez-Moure never imagined how the pandemic would 
change the vision she had of her life in college. She said she had 
a hard time transitioning from her close relationships with people 
in Miami to involving herself with new people and activities at 
UF.
“It was definitely hard going from such a tight-knit commu -
nity where people know you for who you are to coming to a new 
school where the reality is, unless you get involved, you’re just a 
number,” she said.
Ben Whitman
Ben Whitman, a 20-year-old UF 
industrial engineering sophomore, 
said the COVID-19 pandemic hasn’t 
affected him as much as it has other 
people.
“I still do my normal stuff like 
going out with my friends,” he said. 
“I’m not totally changing my life.”
Although he wishes he could 
meet more people, Whitman said he 
enjoys scuba diving with Gator Scu -
ba Club and participating in outdoor 
activities hosted by Outdoor Adven -
ture Recreation, such as canoeing and hiking.
Alesha Wallen
During the first few months of the COVID-19 pandemic, Ale -
sha Wallen was itching for a dramatic style change. 
Lockdown allowed her to go through a transformation that 
increased her confidence in her appearance, she said. She up -
dated her wardrobe and put together a skincare routine that 
made her complexion better than ever.
“I remember when the pandemic first started, I would just 
sit in front of my mirror, get ready and put on clothes just to feel 
good,” the 18-year-old UF biology freshman said. 
Although Wallen said she made an effort to improve her style, her motivation for school 
tanked and now social situations 
feel draining.
“I think I’ve become more in -
troverted where I’ve become un -
able to talk to people in class and 
bad at starting conversations,” she 
said.
Wallen said the social anxiety 
she developed over the COVID-19 
pandemic has become so over -
whelming that she can’t imagine 
how she will adapt when all class -
es are in person and she will have to attend large lecture hall 
classes.
“One of the biggest changes for me was the difference be -
tween last semester and this semester in the number of people 
on campus,” she said. “Like the change was so crazy for me 
walking around and seeing more people, like when I go to Star -
bucks and have to wait in an actual line.”
Everett Schwieg
When UF first announced its 
campus shut down, Everett Schwieg 
was excited to take a break from his 
sophomore year spring semester.
“A year ago, we didn’t imagine 
that the pandemic would be still go -
ing on,” the 20-year-old UF biomedi -
cal engineering junior said. “It was a 
little more lighthearted at the time.”
A lot has changed for him since 
then — he finds himself spend -
ing more time alone than before. 
Schwieg feels like online classes 
have made the past year especially lonely.
“Going to class and meeting up with people after was very 
natural. I didn’t feel like I was having to push myself to go out,” 
he said. “But now I’m always trying to push myself to not sit in 
my room all day.”
With one year left at UF, Schwieg hopes he will return to 
having more in-person classes.
“I’ve never been a huge fan of online learning, even before 
COVID,” he said. “I liked having a routine and attending my 
classes.”
Renier Rodriguez 
This past year has made Renier Rodriguez more grateful for 
his supportive friend group.
Two weeks ago, he texted a friend and fellow UF student 
that he was feeling alone. On Friday, they decided to catch up 
with each other on a walk around Turlington Plaza.
“It’s been really motivating to see that people are there for 
you,” the 20-year-old UF political science sophomore said. 
“And it’s great to find motivation within yourself to do your own things that you actually want 
to do.”
After the COVID-19 pandemic 
started, Rodriguez immediately 
went home to South Florida to 
help his family. He took care of his 
little brothers for his mom, who is 
an essential health care worker. 
When his family contracted CO -
VID-19, he found it hard to help 
them and maintain his studies at the 
same time.
Rodriguez also said he misses the 
team sports he participated in his freshman year. He played 
basketball and volleyball competitively and soccer and football 
recreationally at UF before the pandemic.
During the start of the pandemic, Rodriguez took a sports 
hiatus. However, he became insecure about his weight gain. 
Now, he tries to visit the park when it’s empty to shoot some 
hoops by himself or with a small group of friends.
“Physical activity is my relief,” he said. “I started doing indi -
vidual exercises because I just couldn’t deal with it anymore. It 
was affecting my mental health as well.”
Cameron Johnston
When Cameron Johnston pic -
tured his college years back in 
high school, he imagined walking 
around a busy campus and attend -
ing giant lecture halls alongside 
hundreds of people. 
However, like many others, 
Johnston did not get the college 
freshman year he imagined for so 
long.
“It was so unexpected,” the 
18-year-old UF nuclear engineer -
ing freshman said. “My whole year 
was online and didn’t have any in-person classes. I never 
went to any clubs. I never went to any parties. I didn’t get 
to hang out.”
Johnston said he wants a real college experience, but any 
return to normalcy would probably begin with a gradual 
shift.
“I think the impact of people being socially distanced and 
wearing masks sometimes in public might stick around,” he 
said. “Some people just might never feel comfortable going 
back.”

FASHION, FOOD AND 
MORE PREVAILED IN AN 
UNPRECEDENTED YEAR
By the Avenue Staff
The COVID-19 pandemic has 
been a force of change across 
the globe, bringing about new 
health standards, new work 
atmospheres and new hobbies. 
Thursday marks one year 
since COVID-19 shut down UF’s 
campus. Shortly after, county 
and state-wide stay-at-home 
orders ensued. As residents 
adapted to the early aughts 
of the pandemic, much of the 
nation united in participating in 
lockdown trends. 
Stuck at home, people spent 
more time in the kitchen baking 
bread and making the TikTok 
famous dalgona, or “whipped”, 
coffee. Classic pastimes like 
jigsaw puzzles rose in popularity 
alongside newer games like 
Animal Crossing and Among Us. 
Netflix’s Tiger King dominated 
the conversation and TikTok influencers danced across nearly 
every screen.
For many, taking up new 
hobbies was a way of reducing 
stress and decreasing anxiety 
during otherwise overwhelming 
times. Reflecting on the past 
year, the Avenue staff compiled 
a list of some of their favorite 
trends created while we were all 
alone together. 
Work from home fashion
As work transitioned out 
of the office and onto the 
kitchen table, companies across 
industries scrambled to market 
work-from-home products. The 
fashion industry debuted “work-
from-home chic” and pushed 
leisure clothing as consumers 
jumped at the chance to exchange 
office attire with pajamas and 
sweatpants. 
By May, pajama sales had 
increased by about 143%, 
according to Adobe Analytics 
market research. Meanwhile, 
pants sales were down by 13%, 
indicating a clear trend toward comfort and leisure clothing. A 
professional top with sweatpants 
or leggings became a staple outfit 
for Zoom meetings or classes. 
Comfort, however, was not 
the only goal people had in mind 
when getting dressed for the day.
Michelle Komisarchik, a 
21-year-old UF political science 
and criminology junior, said 
she continued to dress for 
productivity amid the pandemic. 
“Usually when I have a big 
day ahead of me and I want 
to feel productive, I put on an 
outfit that will make me feel that 
way,” Komisarchik said. “I’ll 
walk out of my room in a dress 
and a sweater or mom jeans or 
something like that, that might 
not be the most comfortable, but 
it kind of makes me feel mentally 
ready for the day.” 
While she also had her fair 
share of sweatpant days, she 
said dressing for productivity 
provided a sense of continuity 
during the pandemic. 
For many, expressing 
individuality is a central function 
of fashion and style. Komisarchik 
said she believes the pandemic 
has given people the opportunity to experiment with how they 
express themselves through 
fashion. 
“I feel like trying to find new 
ways to do that can be refreshing 
in a time where your days are so 
monotonous,” she said.
Baking Bread 
Left with no routine and time 
to kill, baking bread became 
a popular hobby — even for 
those who had never before 
experimented with loaves from 
anywhere beyond grocery store 
shelves. 
Initially, the activity stemmed 
from necessity. Along with their 
stockpiles of toilet paper rolls and 
Clorox wipes, anxious shoppers 
hoarded loaves of bread, forcing 
others to take matters into their 
own floured hands. Once dry 
yeast also flew off the shelves, 
interest in sourdough bread 
boomed. 
The trend eventually took an 
economic toll, with King Arthur 
flour sales rising more than 
2000% in March. By the end of 
the month, flour had disappeared 
from grocery stores and the 
Internet. 
Julianne Owen, a 19-year-old 
UF aerospace engineering major, 
got involved in the hunt for King 
Arthur flour. After her mom 
snatched one of the last bags 
from her local grocery store, 
Owen said she hopped on the 
bandwagon and made a loaf. 
“I wanted to pick up a new 
hobby,” she said. “I had more 
free time than I’ve ever had 
before — I didn’t know what to 
do with myself.”
Owen said she took up the 
activity around early June after 
her parents started trying out 
bread recipes they read online. 
After experimenting with 
different recipes, she stumbled 
across one for French bread 
that became her favorite. The 
loaf became a staple around the 
house, she said. 
“I baked 22 loaves of bread in 
22 days,” Owen said. “It was a 
good way to take my mind off the 
stress of the pandemic.”
Even though COVID-19 
restrictions have loosened, Owen 
said she’s still kneading dough 
every time she goes home — and 
occasionally in her dorm kitchen. TikT ok Dances
Social video sharing app 
TikTok has quickly become 
one of the favored social media 
platforms of Gen Z users. A 
hallmark of the app is TikTok 
dances, in which “influencers” 
with large followings and the 
everyday user alike post videos 
of themselves performing short 
dance routines to different 
trending songs. 
Mackenzie Kurth, a 20-year-
old UF advertising sophomore, 
said TikTok dances were one of 
the trends she picked up over the 
last year.
“I’m a semi-retired 
competitive dancer, so learning 
simple dances on a social media 
app was fun for me,” she said.
Kurth said two of her favorite 
dances from her quarantine days 
were to the songs “Supalonely” 
by Benee and “Savage” by Megan 
Thee Stallion. The “Supalonely” 
dance was created by TikToker 
Zoi Lerma and the “Savage” 
dance was created by Keara 
Wilson.
Kurth said the simplicity of 
TikTok dances is what allowed 
users to hop on dance trends, 
and while the choreography of 
these dances has evolved, she 
continues to learn them.
“I don’t know how I would’ve 
managed without TikTok during 
the stress that came with the 
peak of quarantine.”

UF PROFESSORS WERE NOT INCLUDED 
IN DESANTIS’  EXECUTIVE ORDER 
TO VACCINATE TEACHERS
By Alexander Lugo
Alligator Staff Writer
Gov. Ron DeSantis’ recent executive or -
der expanded COVID-19 vaccine eligibility to 
some essential workers, such as law enforce -
ment, firefighters and K-12 employees over 
the age of 50, but excluded higher education 
faculty.  
The United Faculty of Florida, UF’s faculty 
union, published a statement on its website 
Thursday expressing disappointment in the 
governor’s decision to ignore higher educa -
tion faculty in his vaccination plans. The or -
der takes effect Tuesday and includes people 
who are deemed at high risk of COVID-19 
complications by doctors.
“The United Faculty of Florida (UFF) and 
the 22,000 people we represent congratulate 
the public servants who are now eligible for 
the vaccines and celebrate their chance at 
hope,” the statement said. “Nonetheless, we 
are appalled by the governor’s decision to 
exclude college and university workers from 
this mandate.”
Union president Paul Ortiz sent an email 
to UF President Kent Fuchs Friday requesting 
that he urge Gov. DeSantis to include higher 
education staff in Florida’s vaccine program. 
Fuchs responded by saying UF has been in 
contact with state officials since December 
to reach that goal.
“All we’re asking President Fuchs to do is 
please use your power and authority as pres -
ident of our university to ask Gov. DeSantis 
to include higher education staff and faculty 
in that vaccine queue,” Ortiz said.
UF Health has offered vaccinations to staff 
members over 65 years old since January.
A Centers for Disease Control study found 
U.S. counties where many college students 
attend in-person classes faced a 56% in -
crease in COVID-19 cases in August. Another 
study in the Computer Methods in Biome -
chanics and Biomedical Engineering journal 
included UF in an analysis that found most 
COVID-19 related deaths on campuses were 
faculty. 
Still, UF pushed forward with plans to of -
fer in-person classes to about 15,000 students 
this semester — a decision that caused ten -sion between UF administration and faculty.
On Feb. 8, Alabama expanded vaccine 
eligibility to employees in the education sec -
tor, including higher education staff. The 
Alabama public health website does not in -
dicate that one needs to be a resident to get a 
vaccine in Alabama. Some higher education 
faculty from across Florida, Georgia and Mis -
sissippi have been driving to Alabama to get 
vaccinated, Ortiz said.
“I think it’s great that Alabama has 
stepped up,” Ortiz said. “But I think it’s 
shameful that Florida, a state of 22 million 
people, has to rely on the goodwill and grac -
es of a much smaller state.”
Ortiz said he is hopeful higher education 
staff will be included in Florida’s next vac -
cine expansion, but others did not express the same optimism. 
Pamela Gilbert, an English professor at 
UF, said UF Health is doing the best it can 
during a difficult situation, but she’s not sat -
isfied with the state’s rollout of the vaccine 
so far.
“The emphasis on campus has been ‘Oh, 
well, spreading is not happening in the class -
room.’” Gilbert said. “Great, but when you 
bring 50,000 young people in a town, spread -
ing happens outside the classroom.”
States currently allowing higher education 
faculty to get vaccinated include Alabama, 
Arizona, Arkansas and Wisconsin. Vaccines 
in Alachua County are currently available for 
people over the age of 65, K-12 teachers 50 
or older, law enforcement 50 or older, fire -
fighters 50 or older, medical workers and people with high-risk medical conditions.
Gilbert sympathized with K-12 school 
children who she said need to get out of the 
house right now more desperately than col -
lege students, but she hopes that higher edu -
cation staff are included in the next phase of 
the vaccine expansion.
“It really does seem like there was no 
plan in advance that he had so he’s sort of 
making it up as he goes along every day,” 
Gilbert said referring to Gov. DeSantis. “If 
people knew ‘Oh, this is the order, this is 
who’s gonna get it next’ then people would 
understand. But right now it’s like Thunder -
dome out there.”

UF President Kent Fuchs receives his first dose of the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine at UF Health Shands Cancer Hospital Tuesday, Jan. 
5, 2021. UF professors are still waiting for their vaccines after Gov. Ron Desantis excluded higher education faculty when access to 
vaccines was expanded to other groups, including K-12 teachers over 50, on Wednesday, March 3, 2021.

56 SUMMER PROGRAMS HAVE 
ALREADY BEEN CANCELED, BUT 
37 PROGRAMS WILL CONTINUE 
By Sofia Echeverry
Alligator Staff Writer
Hundreds of UF students had 
plans to travel around the world 
this Summer. But due to ongoing 
COVID-19 restrictions, their plans 
have been postponed or canceled.
Despite UF’s increasing con -
fidence that the COVID-19 pan -
demic is coming to an end, 56 UF 
Sponsored study abroad programs 
for this Summer have been can -
celed. 37 still plan to run and three 
will operate virtually with stu -
dents based in the United States, 
said Associate Director of Study 
Abroad Services Jill Ranaivoson.
The UF International Center is 
deciding on a case-by-case basis 
whether the more than 500 study 
abroad programs currently avail -
able should operate, UFIC Dean 
Leonardo Villalón said. He said 
some programs have been or will 
be canceled because they haven’t 
fulfilled their enrollment quotas. 
Others are limited by their des -
tination countries’ travel restric -
tions, such as Australia, which has 
closed its borders, he said.
“This is obviously extraordi -
narily disappointing for everybody 
concerned,” he said. “We’re in the 
business of trying to make it pos -
sible for students to study abroad 
and encourage them to do so.”
Students may choose to study 
abroad to experience new cul -
tures, fulfill credit requirements 
or meet people from around the 
world. Last year, all UF Sponsored 
study abroad programs were can -
celed starting in February follow -
ing the onset of the COVID-19 
pandemic, Ranaivoson said. Some 
students were forced to return to 
the United States after their UF Sponsored program was canceled, 
while other students in exchange 
programs decided to stay in their 
new country. 
This Summer, four out of five 
study abroad programs in the de -
partment of Spanish and Portu -
guese studies have already been 
canceled. UF in Rio de Janeiro will 
be one program that will operate 
virtually this Summer.
The students in virtual pro -
grams will be based in the United 
States and attend classes. Depend -
ing on the program, online classes 
will be taught by UF faculty or an 
institution from the destination 
country. The programs also in -
clude virtual cultural components. 
UF in Rio de Janeiro will have on -
line classes led by both UF staff 
and IBEU (Instituto Brasil-Estados 
Unidos) and virtual excursions. 
The College of Journalism and 
Communications also canceled all 
of its Summer programs, including 
a trip to Tokyo to cover the Olym -
pics.
UFIC must consider each coun -
try’s policies regarding COVID-19 
testing, quarantining and entry 
for travellers from the U.S. Some -
times, Villalón said, these consid -
erations make it easy to decide to 
cancel a program. If the country 
won’t allow travelers, then the 
program can’t take place regard -
less of other factors.
For programs that aren’t so 
clear-cut, Villalón said UFIC is 
considering each individually. 
UFIC will aim to notify students 
about whether or not a program 
will still be happening about four 
to six weeks before its start, he 
said. 
In an attempt to prevent can -
cellation, UFIC is working to shift 
dates for certain programs from 
the beginning of summer to the 
end to increase the possibility the 
trips will take place, Villalón said. 
If a program is canceled, students already admitted will be given pri -
ority if it runs again.
Money is one of UFIC’s main 
concerns when deciding whether 
to cancel, postpone or continue 
with the programs, Villalón said. 
In most cases, he said, the pro -
grams will be canceled before stu -
dents begin payment. In the event 
a program gets canceled after stu -
dents have paid a deposit or other 
fees, they will be reimbursed com -
pletely. 
However, if the program goes 
forward but a student decides not 
to participate due to safety rea -
sons, UFIC’s normal cancellation 
policies apply, Villalón said.
Apart from student financial 
concerns, Villalón said UFIC must 
also consider its own finances 
when making the decision. When 
COVID-19 canceled UF’s Summer 
2020 study abroad programs, UFIC 
had to refund more than $650,000 
total to about 2,000 students — 
a tedious process, he said. Some 
programs require non-refundable 
down payments, which means 
UFIC will lose the money if they 
decide to cancel the trip. 
“We’re negotiating as hard as 
we can on every possible program 
to make sure that there are no 
expenses up-front until we know 
for certain whether programs are 
going to run to try to minimize 
everybody’s liability, including 
ours,” he said. 
Growing up with a Canadian 
mother, Olivia Dodge learned to 
endure and love traveling long 
distances. 
“She’s traveled all around the 
world a few times, so I just know 
that was always something I want -
ed to do,” Dodge, a 21-year-old UF 
mechanical engineering junior, 
said.
But now, she’s worried she 
won’t experience everything her 
study abroad program usually has 
to offer. Dodge planned to attend the UF 
in Dublin Engineering Internship 
program last Summer, but it was 
canceled due to COVID-19, she 
said. While her goal this year was 
to participate in both the Dublin 
and UF in Iceland programs, the 
Iceland trip was postponed from 
this Spring to late Summer—its 
new dates conflicting with the 
Dublin trip. 
Dodge said she ultimately 
chose to continue with the Dublin 
program.
Aside from the experience of 
living in a new country, she is 
counting on this program to fulfill 
some of her elective requirements. 
Canceling the program would 
mean dropping either her eco -
nomics or business administration 
minor to graduate on time, Dodge 
said. 
She’s planning on using what 
she learns during the program to help her in her future position as 
a nuclear officer within the U.S. 
Navy. 
“I was really hoping to learn a 
lot for my future job through this 
internship,” she said. “I would 
feel a little less confident going 
into my future profession without 
this kind of experience.” 
She will also be living in home -
stay accommodations, she said. If 
her homestay family is uncomfort -
able housing her, she won’t have 
a place to stay.
Despite the uncertainty and 
limitations surrounding her sum -
mer plans, Dodge remains hope -
ful she will be able to travel to 
Ireland.
“I think my family is a bit tired 
of how optimistic I have been 
about the situation,” she said.

UF GYMNASTS DESCRIBE HOW 
THEY DEVELOP THEIR SPORT’S 
EXCITING TECHNIQUE 
By Zachary Huber
Sports Writer
Junior Trinity Thomas completed 
her split leaps to perfection. She then 
tumbled diagonally across the floor 
but stayed in control. 
She then sprung in the air, stuck 
the landing and grinned as the music 
softened.
The Gators fans in the O’Dome 
rose to their feet and erupted with 
cheers and adoration as Thomas re -
corded her second 10 of the season 
on floor at the Feb. 26 meet against 
No. 12 Auburn. It marked her third 
career perfect score on the exercise.
“That’s one of the best routines 
I’ve ever done in competition,” she 
said. “I honestly didn’t really care 
about the score.”
Every Florida gymnast sets a goal 
before she steps on the mats centered 
in the O’Connell Center. They want to 
leave it all on the floor, like actresses 
on the last night of a play’s run. 
The Gators rank first in each of the 
sport’s four events, according to Road 
to Nationals. But no event energizes a 
sold out, socially distant home crowd 
like an electrifying floor routine.
Volunteer assistant coach Jeremy 
“J3” Miranda and several Gator gym -
nasts broke down how they design 
breathtaking routines like Thomas’. 
Many gymnasts enjoy the floor 
routine because they can exhibit 
their creativity and personality. The 
vibrant display of expression and ath -
leticism draws fans’ intrigue into the event.
Florida allows its gymnasts to 
choose the track for their perfor -
mance. Miranda listens to music all 
the time and even keeps a master 
spreadsheet on his computer to help 
the athlete find the perfect tune. They 
can take it a step further and choreo -
graph their whole routine, too. Junior 
Sydney Johnson-Scharpf did just that 
during the offseason. 
The song selection demands the 
most time. Gymnasts begin to find 
the ideal melody after a season con -
cludes. The hymn must motivate the 
gymnast to perform their best. 
Once they finalize their song 
choices, Miranda and Florida cut the 
music to blend perfectly. Each gym -
nast has different preferences based 
on when they want to knock out their 
tumbling passes and leaps. 
Judges give a baseline 9.4 score 
on every floor routine, Miranda said. 
The gymnast can generate .6 of bonus 
points to earn a 10 potentially. One 
of those moves must include a leap 
combination that’s rewarded with a 
tenth in bonus. The last five tenths 
come from each tumbling pass in the 
routine. 
At the end of the summer, it’s time 
to choreograph. The process pushes 
the athletes to their mental limits be -
cause they hate mistakes.
“They’re all perfectionists,” he 
said. “They all want to get a 10.”
Choreography takes trial and error 
because the gymnasts explore what 
works and what doesn’t.
Florida’s gymnasts always run to 
Miranda to add new moves to their 
exercise. 
The coaching staff then focuses on making their routine appear effortless, 
Johnson-Scharpf said. Coaches focus 
on building the team’s endurance 
through practice exercises. Landings 
are the cherry on top of a routine. 
The junior concentrates on her fa -
cial expressions when dancing on the 
mat to emphasize her performance. 
Each of Florida’s routines tells a 
different story, she said. She hasn’t 
configured the story she hopes to tell, 
but she wants to symbolize a puppet 
coming to life. 
Many Florida gymnasts named 
junior Nya Reed as their favorite on 
floor. 
She collaborated with Miranda to 
design a routine with as much sass as 
possible. 
The junior bounces, points her 
left index finger upward and makes 
it rain to Princess Nokia’s “Tom -
boy,” Megan Thee Stallion’s “Captain 
Hook'' and Nicki Minaj’s “Chun-Li.” 
Reed specifically chose all female art -
ists because that was important to 
her, she added.  
The key to her performance, Reed 
said, is to compete the same way she 
practices. She highlighted the need to 
focus on one skill at a time, such as 
keeping her toes pointed and her legs 
straight. 
Despite how natural she appears 
on the floor, Reed despised the event 
at first. She said nerves filled her 
thoughts before she competed.
Coaches scolded her for how she 
kept her gaze on the mat and failed to 
make eye contact, Reed said. To work 
through these fears, coach Jenny 
Rowland instructed the team to line 
the outside of the floor during prac -
tices. She then told Reed she had to lock eyes with everyone on the team. 
Reed truly emerged from her shell 
after her first meet in the O’Dome 
Jan. 11, 2019. 
The arena bursted with applause 
and Reed witnessed how much fans 
love her routine and her sassiness. 
Her confidence soared, she left her 
fears behind and grew a passion for 
competing on floor. 
“She’s just a ball of energy,” John -
son-Scharpf said. “She has so much 
sass, and I love her personality and 
she just really shines out there.”
Johnson-Scharpf adores Reed’s 
routines because she tumbles power -
fully and gets massive height when 
she flips around the mat. 
“She is a great performer,” she 
said. “I love [her floor routines] 
more and more every year. She’s just 
grown so much.”
When Johnson-Scharpf takes the 
floor, she walks to a corner of the mat 
and slumps over. As the tango music 
picks up, she springs to life. The ju -
nior choreographed her routine with 
her mother’s help during the quaran -
tine. Johnson-Scharpf didn’t struggle 
to calculate her movements and syn -
chronize them to the beat with her 
background in dance. 
“I’m very in tune with my music,” 
Johnson-Scharpf said. “I just kind of 
let myself come up with what comes 
to my head.”
Reed bragged about how much 
she could watch Johnson-Scharpf’s 
floor performances on repeat for 
days. 
“That girl is a performer,” Reed 
said. “I know every part of her rou -
tine. I love doing it with her.”
She couldn’t believe that Johnson-
Scharpf crafted her own routine. 
But Reed often struts with Johnson-
Scharpf during practice because she 
knows every second of her perfor -mance. 
It’s also an every meet perfor -
mance for Florida to dance with its 
teammate from the sideline.
Another gymnast captivates Flor -
ida fans’ attention through her rou -
tines: sophomore Payton Richards. 
The Illinois native’s music choice re -
minds fans of Fall Saturdays in The 
Swamp.
The audience sings along to the 
late Tom Petty’s hits as she bounces 
across the floor. She sways her arms 
to “I Won’t Back Down” and then 
strings an air guitar to “Runnin’ Down 
A Dream'' before her final tumbling 
pass. She also diversifies her music 
with AC/DC’s “Highway to Hell” and 
“Back in Black.”
Richards knew Petty’s songs be -
cause she grew up listening to him. 
Her parents blared his music while 
she played in the nearby lake at their 
Illinois lakehouse. 
“I just kind of wanted to do 
something like that and support my 
Gainesville community,” she said. “I 
grew up with four brothers, so we 
kind of listened to a lot of older mu -
sic.”
But Thomas steals the show with 
her powerful tumbling and signature 
moves. She flexes like a butterfly, 
prowls across the floor like a tiger in a 
jungle and plays the floor like a drum.
Miranda said they keep her trade -
mark moves, such as flexing her right 
leg over her shoulder, because they 
have become synonymous with 10s. 
However, one patented move 
makes its way into every routine de -
spite how different each performance 
looks — the Gator chomp.

Today, I sit outside my apartment. On a lemon-colored chair as I drink black tea, wear 
sweats because they’re cozy and write on my laptop. 
Tomorrow will mirror today. And the next day, and the next day. And the next day. My 
beverage might become the only variable. 
But I have lived this for nearly 365 days. And it will likely continue for many more. 
Because March 2020 never really ended. 
Nearly a year ago I met up with friends at The Social at Midtown. We always met up on 
Wednesday nights; it’s an Alligator tradition. 
I stood at the bar, ordered a pitcher and balanced my attention between the television screens 
above me and my iPhone’s. We knew of COVID-19. We figured the virus’ spread would invade 
our lives inevitably not suddenly. 
At 9:37 p.m., the NBA suspended the rest of its season. More dominoes fell. I left the bar that 
night numb to reality as it presented itself. I awoke with the reality hanging over my head. 
I wanted nothing more than to write for The Alligator. It’s why I chose to attend UF. That 
spring, I was hired and covered lacrosse. I even made plans to travel to Chapel Hill, North Caro -
lina, to cover the Gators play another No. 1 team. 
But the virus left me, a few months into my first semester as an Alligator sports writer, without 
sports. 
I isolated, my routine disappeared and days blended into each other. Sports acted as a calendar. 
My schedule intertwined around games. But that facet of life faded, and life slogged during the pandemic. 
A Michael Jordan documentary returned some excitement to our 
lives. But only once a week. 
After that glorious episode, there was nothing fresh. Nothing excit -
ing. Nothing to drop a bit of money on, if your state allowed it. 
Korean Baseball brought some of that excitement back. But only if 
you dared to wake up early or stay up late enough to follow its schedule. 
Bundesliga returned first. I felt rejuvenated watching Erling Haa -
land’s figure flash in yellow across the screen. I forgot what it was like 
to be able to watch multiple sports. I felt as though I took that luxury 
for granted.  
Other European leagues picked up games, and as the U.S. attempted 
to handle the pandemic, so did North American sports. 
The fall semester then picked up. I had college football to care about again; some coaches said 
some things they probably shouldn’t have. But sports were back. 
It’s still surreal. After a year, everything remains unfamiliar. 
Covering sports is worse. I’m always afraid to get skipped in the Zoom chat queue during vir -
tual media availabilities. Limited opportunities to travel, report in-person or do most of the things 
I love about my job. 
A vaccine is out, but we still haven’t figured out how to distribute them. But things slowly 
improve.
We’re not there yet, but we’re nearing the end. We just need a little more patience. So that 
when it’s safe, we’ll return to stadiums, sit together and watch sports again — together.The anniversary of a sportless MarchOrtega Genesis

WOMEN’S BASKETBALL
SMITH’S JOURNEY TO SEC BASKETBALL INVOLVED 
CHALLENGES SUCH AS HER KNEE INJURIES AND 
RARE SHOE SIZE
By Griffin Foll
Sports Writer
Star Florida guard Kiara Smith took the hardwood Thursday 
in the SEC Tournament, possibly wearing orange and blue for 
the last time. 
The 5-foot-10-inch redshirt senior dropped a career-high 36 
points, but Smith and the Gators returned home empty-hand -
ed as No. 17 Kentucky prevailed. Kiara capped off the 26th 
1,000-point career in UF program history. 
At first glance, nothing stands out when Kiara darts around 
the court. Only an incredibly obser -
vant individual notices something 
odd: her size 5-and-a-half shoes. 
When her kicks hit the hard -
wood, they carry her story, experi -
ences and challenges.
UF struggled to find Kiara’s rare 
shoe size. Jordan, the shoe brand 
Florida women’s basketball uses, 
didn’t produce shoes that fit Kiara, 
said Serena Lamar, director of wom -
en’s basketball operations. 
Jordan extended its size spectrum 
in the wake of Kiara’s specification. 
“Even some of the shoes now, they just 
can’t design them the way that they’re intended 
to at that small of a shoe,” Lamar said.The struggle shadowed Kiara’s every step on any court. Her 
shoe size always inched around the small end of the scale, so 
she often felt neglected as teammates donned matching shoes, 
Kiara’s mother Deborah Smith said.
“She learned early that it is okay to be different,” Deborah 
said.
 Now, Kiara embraces her shoe size and finds it rather amus -
ing given her height.
“It’s always funny to see, when I get shoes, how small they 
look on my foot,” Kiara said jokingly.
Kiara owns around 30 pairs of basketball shoes, but she pre -
fers her pair of Russell Westbrooks for games. Kiara’s atomic 
orange editions resemble UF colors and feature an orange base 
with hints of hyper crimson, melon and a teal Jordan logo.
Akin to her shoes, Kiara endured an unusual path to Florida, 
where she found the right fit.
Following back-to-back Maryland state titles, Kiara originally 
planned to play for Syracuse. 
But after sustaining a pair of knee injuries in high school, 
Smith committed to National Junior College Athletic Association 
Division I Advanced Software Analysis College. While she red -
shirted the first year, Kiara averaged a team-high 16.7 points on 
50.4% shooting and carried the Avengers to a 22-2 record in the 
2017-18 season.
Following her lone playing season in Brooklyn, Kiara mi -
grated south. 
“With two ACL tears and one meniscus tear, you would 
think that she wouldn’t be playing right now,” Deborah said. 
Kiara stuck to a clean diet and hit the weightroom to remain 
on the court — something she didn’t focus on at ASA. She target -
ed the muscles around her knees like the quadriceps and ham -
strings. The stronger they are, the more likely she’ll stay healthy.
The atmosphere differs, too. Brooklyn’s college fanbase paled 
in comparison with Gainesville’s.
New York City is home to eight major professional sports 
teams in addition to a plethora of Division I colleges. Sports fans 
in the city often support different teams than their next-door 
neighbor. 
Gainesville offers little beyond college athletics. On any given 
Florida basketball gameday, the O’Connell Center draws thou -sands of Gator fans from all ages who unite to cheer on the 
orange and blue.
“Here, I can walk into a store, and somebody knows who I 
am,” Kiara said. 
Kiara traded the hustle and bustle of the Big Apple for a more 
laid-back town in Gainesville, Deborah said.
“With the traffic in New York, it can be a hassle getting 
around,” she said. “I think she feels a lot more comfortable in 
Gainesville. I know I do.”
Living in the Sunshine State required a long-distance relation -
ship between Kiara and her parents. While Brooklyn is only a 
four-hour drive from Kiara’s hometown, District Heights, Mary -
land, Gainesville is nearly 800 miles away.
“It was an adjustment cutting the cord and letting my baby 
girl fly off on her own,“ Deborah said. 
Deborah put her faith and trust in God that Kiara would blos -
som on-and-off the court.
Unlike most athletes, Kiara’s journey to Division I basketball 
hardly involves genetics. Kiara’s mother didn’t play sports, and 
her father only dabbled in baseball. 
“It’s totally a gift she has from up above,” Deborah said.
Kiara began her basketball journey small, as a 4-year-old who 
pleaded to play on her older brother’s basketball team. The rec -
reation center director said she was too young but offered her a 
spot on the roster if she sunk a spontaneous basket.
Smith — in hopes of kick-starting her career on the hard -
wood — delivered under pressure. With the bucket, her deep 
love for basketball flourished.
As Kiara’s redshirt senior season comes to an end, she must 
decide if she wants to pursue professional basketball. But Debo -
rah envisions a different version of her daughter after college. 
“I just want her to be a role model and encourage young 
people to stay on the right path — to be a mentor to those com -
ing up behind her,” she said.
Despite her next steps, Kiara will seek her next best fit, either 
on or off the court.
