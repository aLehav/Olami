An 18-year-old UF freshman 
was arrested Sunday evening and 
charged with sexually assaulting 
three girls after they’d fallen asleep at an off-campus party.
Robert Coburn, who lives in UF’s 
Beaty Towers, went to the party Sat-urday night and stayed after it end-ed, according to a  Gainesville Police report.
When most guests had gone to 
sleep, Coburn went into the first victim’s room. The victim woke up to find Coburn kissing her neck and yelled at him to leave, so he went into the bedroom across the hall where four other girls were sleeping, according to the report.
Coburn is accused of attempting to have sex with girl without waking her. The third victim woke up to him touching her. Her screams woke the others, who told Coburn to leave. He refused until neighbors came.
Coburn turned himself in Sun-
day.
After being read 
his rights, Coburn 
admitted to hav-ing consensual sex with the first vic-tim, to having tried to have sex with the second, and said “it was pos-
sible” that he abused the third, the 
report stated.
Coburn is charged with three 
counts of sexual battery against 
physically helpless victims because the girls were drinking. 
Career Resource Center to host job and internship fair today, Wednesday
Students from all majors will meet hun-
dreds of employers, as well as apply for in-
ternships and full-time jobs, at UF’s Career Showcase today and Wednesday from 9 a.m. to 3 p.m. at the O’Connell Center. 
Today is a non-technical day with em-
ployers recruiting for positions in accounting, communications and health care. The second day’s employers will recruit for computer sci-ence, construction and engineering.
Angel Iverson, the assistant director for ca-reer events, said the event is good for all stu-dents, from freshmen who want to network to seniors looking for a job. Students should bring a portfolio for resumes and notes, a list of the companies they are interested in, a pen and paper, and a Gator 1 Card.
Students can prepare for the showcase by 
creating a Gator CareerLink account and can upload a resume and view job databases and showcase participants on Gator CareerLink.

Students line up outside the Reitz Union on Monday to purchase tickets for the Bob Dylan concert 
at the O’Connell Center on Oct. 8.
ON CAMPUS

Alligator Contributing Writer
Legendary folk musician Bob 
Dylan will be performing at the Ste-
phen C. O’Connell Center Oct. 8 at 8 p.m.
Bob Dylan’s current tour finds 
him frequenting college campuses across the country, beginning at Nova Southeastern University Oct. 6 and ending at the University of Akron in Ohio on Nov. 2.
Student tickets are $22. Tickets 
for the public will go on sale at 10 a.m. today for $43.
Student tickets can be purchased 
eight at a time with a Gator 1 ID card. 
Identification as a student will 
not be checked on the night of the concert.
The line of ticket purchasers 
wrapped around the Reitz Union Colonnade on Monday until the Uni-versity Box Office closed at 5 p.m. 
It took about two hours to get 
from the union doors to the box of-fice window.
Dylan, who released his first al-
bum, “Bob Dylan,” in 1962, was named in Time magazine’s “Time 100: The Most Important People of the Century” for socially conscious music.
“From the very start of his career, 
Dylan expanded what could be said in a pop song format, getting away from the ‘I love you, you love me,’” said UF rock ‘n’ roll and American society professor Glenn Rickard. 
“He’s one of the people whom 
historians and critics look at as sav-ing rock ‘n’ roll; he expanded the scope of what pop music could be about.”Students line up

UF President Bernie Machen will join 
five other university presidents at the 
White House Tuesday to sit at a roundtable meeting with Vice President Joe Biden to discuss the use of stimulus funds for re-
search programs.
In a written statement, Machen said he 
appreciates the invitation, especially be-
cause of the importance of research. 
“There is no question that our work in 
the laboratory and the field has great ben-efits for the nation,” he said.
UF has received about $120 million in 
stimulus funds for research, according to 
UF spokesman Steve Orlando.
Some prominent organizations involved 
are the National Institutes of Health and the National Science Foundation.
In the statement, Machen said UF re-
search often inspires companies to use sim-
ilar technology.
“I think the vice president can be a 
strong voice in delivering the message that university research is a great investment in our economy and our national well-be-ing.” 
He will be joining the presidents of Pur -
due University, Johns Hop-kins University, Washington State University, University of Pennsylvania and University 
of California at the meeting. 
Robert Berdahl, president of the Asso-
ciation of American Universities, and M. Peter McPherson, president of the Associa-tion of Public and Land-grant Universities will also be attending.Machen to meet Biden

MtvU and the New York Stock Exchange 
are offering $25,000 to college students with 
an original, socially conscious, innovative and potentially profitable business proposal that uses social media to market the business.  
The “Movers & Changers” competition 
is open to college students 16 to 28 years old working in groups of up to three or individu-ally. 
The top three groups or individuals will 
fly to New York City to participate in Glob-al Entrepreneurship Week, where they can network with prominent business leaders and present their ideas to the “Movers & 
Changers” Board, which has not yet been an-
nounced. 
The finalists will also be featured on mtvU 
in the series “Movers & Changers,” premier -
ing Nov. 17. 
For those who have a great business idea 
but no formal proposal, mtvU is also offering a $2,500 grand prize. 
“MtvU has always been about putting in-
credible opportunities before our audience and watching them put its unbridled and lim-itless creativity to work,” said Carlo DiMarco, vice president of strategic partnerships and development at mtvU, in an e-mail.   The grand prize winners will receive 
$25,000 to start the business and have the opportunity to ring the NYSE Closing Bell, a privilege usually reserved for the world’s most successful CEOs and entrepreneurs.
DiMarco said students should not be in-
timidated by the competition, but look at it as 
a chance to put their careers and businesses 
on a fast track to success.  
Last year’s competition was won by stu-
dents from Tulane University and their “Wet 
Tea” business idea. For every box of tea sold, 
the group planned to donate money to the preservation and reconstruction for the Gulf Coast wetlands. 
More information and the application for 
this year’s competition can be found at www.moversandchangers.com. The $25,000 com-petition deadline is Oct. 8 and the $2,500 com-petition ends Nov. 5. Students’ business plans 
could net cash from mtvU  
� THE STUDENT ALLIANCE 
PARTY SUBMITTED THE WRONG PAPERWORK.
By ELIZABETH BEHRMAN
Alligator Staff Writer
Due to a clerical mix up, the Student 
Alliance party will not be participating 
in the upcoming Student Government elections.
According to Supervisor of Elec-
tions Amanda Griffin, the Student Al-liance party did not file a slate list by 11:59 p.m. on Sept. 7, the last day of slating interviews.  
Yevgen Sautin, spokesman for the 
Student Alliance party , said his party accidentally submitted the wrong list to the supervisor, and by the time the mistake was caught, the deadline had 
already passed.
Sautin said some of the candidates 
who slated with the Student Alliance 
party decided to run independently after they were notified in an e-mail from the supervisor of elections that they were not eligible to run with the party.
“Those people got an e-mail and 
were basically turned away,” he said. Neil Gundavda, an independent 
senator and leader of the Independent Coalition of Students, said the fact that the candidates were not allowed to run 
on a party ticket does not change their 
ideas to improve SG. 
“It doesn’t really matter whether 
we have a party or not; we still have 24 candidates committed to running as independents,” Gundavda said. “At the end of the day, it’s all about trying to find a way for students to take back Student Government.”
Griffin said election codes do not 
require her to check the lists before the deadline and, because nothing like this has ever happened before, she did 
not think it was necessary to check the lists. She said she will be recom-
mending to the Senate that these codes 
be changed to prevent these situations 
in the future. 
“Hopefully we can learn from this 
and develop the codes so this can nev-er happen again, because it was unfor -
tunate for everyone,” Griffin said.
Sautin said the Student Alliance 
party’s inability to participate in the elections will not have an impact on 
the party’s performance in the Student 
Senate. SG party not on ballot

Gainesville is gearing up to 
illuminate the skies with bal-
loons and big hearts.
The kickoff event for The 
Leukemia & Lymphoma Soci-ety’s Light The Night Walk is tonight from 6 p.m. to 7:30 p.m. at the Thomas Center. 
UF’s chapter of the Pre-med 
American Medical Student As-sociation has come together with The Leukemia & Lym-phoma Society to plan the walk 
held on Nov. 18.
“Tuesday’s event is to get 
people excited and to see what 
Light The Night is all about,” said Leanne Iorio, vice presi-dent of the UF Pre-med AMSA. “We want to get people aware of The Leukemia & Lymphoma Society and the reasons why 
we raise money.”
The kickoff celebration will 
enable team captains to ex-
change fundraising ideas and feature a remembrance cere-mony for lives lost to the blood cancers, Iorio said. 
There will also be a number 
of booths from various busi-nesses supporting the walk as well as a table to register people who want to walk in 
November.
Participants must raise a 
minimum of $100 to walk. UF 
Pre-med AMSA hopes to raise a total of $10,000 this year. 
Registered walkers will re-
ceive a T-shirt, food and bal-loon. Each balloon has a light 
fixed inside it and is red, white 
or gold depending on if the walker is a supporter, survivor or representative of a lost loved

In this Sept. 13, 2010, photo, cattle drink water at a borehole in 
Dertu, Kenya. 
� COMMUNICATION WILL 
INCREASE.
THE ASSOCIATED PRESS
DERTU, Kenya — This village of 
straw huts sits on a sea of sand 100 
kilometers (60 miles) from the near -
est paved road. Camels and girls with jerrycans crowd around the 
watering holes. There’s little electric-
ity and not a single TV .
But on the edge of Dertu stands 
a shimmering sign of progress — a new cell phone tower. And that means farmers no longer have to travel for hours to learn the latest market prices; they can get them by text message.
It’s one of many innovations that 
have come to some 6,000 people in eastern Kenya and to 13 other such villages scattered around 10 coun-tries in sub-Saharan Africa. They are called Millennium Villages, designed to show how aid and smart, simple technology can advance the U.N.’s Millennium Development Goals of 
dramatically reducing global pov-
erty and boosting education, gender equality and health by 2015.
The U.N. is hosting a summit in 
New York starting Monday to re-view progress since the goals were set 10 years ago.
About 70 percent of Dertu’s peo-
ple earn less than $1 a day, and most 
depend on food aid. The two-room 
hotel charges $1.25 a night. Gen-erators and solar energy provide some basic needs, like charging cell phones, but the school’s nine donat-ed computers aren’t yet connected to the Internet.
Not surprisingly , the advent of 
Millennium Village status four years ago generated exaggerated expecta-
tions, and now some villagers feel 
disappointed. There is also sharp debate between supporters and de-tractors about whether the idea can be “scaled up” into sweeping solu-tions for the world’s poorest region.
Yet improvements can be seen in 
Dertu: four new health care work-ers, free medicines and vaccines, a 
birthing center and laboratory un-
der construction, bed nets to ward of mosquitoes. In 2006, 49 percent of 916 individuals tested had malaria. That rate has dropped to 8 percent.
School attendance has doubled 
for boys and tripled for girls, there 
are high school scholarships 
and a dorm for 
boys. Each vil-lage gets $120 
in spending per person per year, half from the villages project, the rest from the government or aid groups.
As a result, Dertu, which barely 
existed until UNICEF dug a well here 13 years ago, has become a 
magnet for surrounding villages.
“A lot has to be done still to 
meet the Millennium Development 
Goals. A lot has been done and for that we are thankful,” said Ibrahim Ali Hassan, a 60-year-old village el-der with dyed red hair who waves a cell phone in his hand as he talks.
Of the complainers, he remarks: 
“They think now that we are a Mil-lennium Village they will be built a house with an ocean view.”
Mohamed Ahmed Abdi, 58, heads the Millennium Village Committee, liaison between the project and the villagers. He gripes that there are too few teachers, and that the well water 
is salty and unhealthy.
“There is a difference between 
what we have been told and what 
really exists. We have been told that ‘Your village is the Millennium Vil-lage.’ We have been told that ‘You will get roads, electricity , water and education,’” he said.
The Millennium Villages are the 
brainchild of Jeffrey Sachs, the Co-lumbia University economist who is special adviser to U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon on the Millen-nium Development Goals.
Sachs readily acknowledges that 
Dertu hasn’t made a breakthrough, calling it “one of the most difficult venues on the whole planet.” But 
he points to other advances in lifting 
villages out of extreme poverty.
“I think on the whole they’ve 
been a tremendous success, not only in what they are accomplishing on the ground but also opening eyes to what can be accomplished more generally,” Sachs told The Associat-ed Press. “They’re a proving ground 
of how to create effective systems in 
health, education, local infrastruc-ture, business development and ag-riculture.”
The project’s report for this year 
says bed net use by children under 5 has risen from 7 percent to 50 per -
cent across the 14 villages. Malaria rates have dropped from 24 percent 
to 10 percent. Maize yields are up, 
chronic malnutrition is down, more babies are delivered by health pro-fessionals.

TACOMA, Wash. — A decorat-
ed Air Force Reserve flight nurse 
discharged for being gay took the witness stand at her federal 
trial Monday and told the judge it 
“kills me” not to be able to care for 
wounded soldiers while the coun-try is at war.
Former Maj. Margaret Witt has 
sued the Air Force in hopes of be-
ing reinstated.
No one in her unit or any of her 
patients ever expressed concern 
about her sexual orientation, she 
told the judge.
“It’s what I’ve spent over half 
my life training to do,” Witt testi-
fied, her voice breaking. “I miss being able to be the one that that soldier looks at and I can do some-thing for him. I’m not complete, and it kills me to not be there.”
The case has been closely 
watched by those on both sides of the gay rights debate.
Proponents believe another big 
legal victory would build momen-tum for a congressional repeal of “don’t ask, don’t tell,” the 1993 law that prohibits the military from asking about the sexual orientation of service members but requires discharge of those who acknowl-edge being gay or are found to en-gage in homosexual activity.
Earlier this month, a federal 
judge in California ruled that 
“don’t ask, don’t tell” violates the 
due process and free speech rights 
of service members. That opinion has no direct bearing on Witt’s case.
Witt joined the Air Force in 1987 
and later became a flight nurse, helping to care for and evacuate soldiers wounded in Afghanistan. She was suspended in 2004 when 
the Air Force investigated her for 
violating “don’t ask, don’t tell.” She 
was discharged 
three years later, 
while just short 
of becoming 
eligible for a full pension.
Her lawsuit 
challenged the constitutionality 
of “don’t ask, don’t tell.” In 2008, a three-judge panel of the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals consider -
ing the case held that the military couldn’t discharge someone for being gay unless it demonstrated the firing was necessary to further military goals.
The case returned to U.S. Dis-
trict Court in Tacoma, where Judge Ronald B. Leighton must deter -
mine whether Witt’s firing met that 
standard. Leighton heard testimo-ny last week from several of Witt’s 
former colleagues, who said they didn’t care about her orientation 
and that her firing actually hurt 
morale in their squadron, based 
at what is now Joint Base Lewis-McChord near Tacoma.
The Air Force maintains that 
Witt’s firing was justified, and the 
appeals court ruling was out of 
line with 9th Circuit and Supreme Court precedent.
In pointed cross-examination, 
Justice Department lawyer Peter 
Phipps noted Monday that Witt 
had engaged in an adulterous re-lationship with a married civilian woman in 2003. The woman, now 
divorced, is still Witt’s partner, but 
the Air Force argues that Witt’s disregard for policy in commit-ting adultery set a bad example for others in the unit and justifies her dismissal.
“You agree that adultery is not 
consistent with high standards of integrity, correct?” Phipps asked.
“Yes,” Witt responded.The government also argues 
that Witt acknowledged being homosexual to some of her close friends in the unit, forcing them to choose between loyalty to her and to Air Force policy . Her firing eliminated a risk to unit cohesion, 
a legitimate military goal, DOJ 
lawyers say.Air Force lesbian takes stand

� THE MONEY WILL FUND 
EXTENDED HOURS DURING FINAL EXAM WEEKS.
By NADINE KORIOTH
Alligator Contributing Writer
UF libraries are giving stu-
dents another reason to cheer for 
every touchdown this football 
season. 
The Pay for Performance Flor -
ida Football Challenge is back for a second year, encouraging  
participants to pledge money 
for each Gator touchdown made throughout the football season. 
The money that is raised will 
be used to extend library hours during the weeks surrounding final exams.
Participants can fill out the 
form on the George A. Smathers Libraries website and specify 
the amount they would like to 
pledge, anywhere from 25 cents to $100 per touchdown, and pick which library will receive their donation. 
“I think it’s an innovative way 
to raise money for the libraries,” said Barbara Hood, spokeswom-an for Smathers Libraries.    
Last year the fundraiser had 
88 donors, and the libraries were able to extend hours during the final exam periods for both the fall and spring semesters, Hood 
said. 
The purpose is to acquire as 
many pledges as possible, said 
Samuel Huang, associate dean 
for  advancement and develop-
ment.
So far this year, 54 people have 
committed to making donations, according to Huang.
If there is leftover money, it 
will be used toward buying lap-tops for the laptop loan program, he said.
“I always say that nobody 
graduates from the library,” Huang said. “But nobody gradu-ates without using the library.”Donors 
will keep library open late by betting 
on Gators

way to raise money for the

Monday’s question: Do you trust

123 TOTAL VOTESToday’s question: Would you rather wait in line for Bob Dylan or Dane Cook tickets?Dancing with the GOP
Wait, you all thought 
“Dancing With the Stars” wasn’t seri-
ous television?
A gang of D-list celebri-
ties — including this year’s lineup of David Hasselhoff, 
Mike “The Situation” Sor -
rentino and that kid who 
played Raven’s little brother on “That’s So Raven”  — learning to dance like pro-
fessionals sounds like TV 
jackpot to the millions of Americans without a better way to spend their time.
And then there’s Bris-
tol. This is where things get good. And this is where Americans might benefit by watching.
Putting her best foot for -
ward, Bristol Palin hopes to “reintroduce” herself to America as something else 
other than that girl who got knocked up by a one-time 
Playgirl model. 
Talk of the possibility of 
Sarah Palin taking time out of her busy Tea Party sched-ule of lambasting mothers who abort their children and 
Americans who don’t mind 
a few penny taxes here and there being front and center at the semi-serious dancing competition without a prize 
except some dumb trophy 
could turn this year’s show into an arena of crazy wilder than a snow angel competi-
tion in Wasilla. 
We’re just glad President 
Barack Obama didn’t sched-
ule a pseudo-important State of the Union address Mon-
day night like he originally 
did with the “Lost” premiere and then rescheduled.
We’re glad we have our 
priorities straight, America.Solar Savior
Walmart announces
 sustainability goals
The international multibillion-dollar behemoth respon-
sible for combining every possible  item under one roof announced Monday that it plans to add more to its roofs. 
The corporate megahouse that put Arkansas on the map, 
Walmart, said it will expand its renewable energy by doubling 
the number of stores nationwide that use solar technology (now 
31) to provide some of the store’s electricity. 
The announcement follows a 2005 company announcement 
that set a goal of providing 100 percent of the company’s 8,400 
stores electricity from renewable sources. 
The problem with that 2005 announcement? It’s missing a 
timetable. 
But the world’s biggest retailer, in its unscathed effort to rule 
the world and obliterate every mom and pop store in town, clearly sets a precedent for other super-giant retail leaders to 
follow. 
As the store everyone hates to love paves over land with its  
never-ending parking lot and hands out unsustainable plastic 
molds and packaging faster than Gators football stars smile for 
mug shots, we can’t help but applaud the leader for taking the lead. 
According to the Environmental Protection Agency, Wal-
mart is currently No. 2 for running on the renewable energy it produces on site, behind only Kimberly Clark, popular maker 
of the ever-so-hard-to-reach, tire-sized toilet paper roll in public 
restrooms.
We’re glad to see corporate powerhouses like Walmart and 
Kimberly Clark shining one of those spiral, power-saving light-bulbs at the rest of the world as they prove renewable energy 
is doable.
But we still feel bad shopping there.
Wild bison infestation a real problem
While many new students might be completely 
unaware, there are about four dozen free-roaming bison hidden on the 21,000 acres of 
Paynes Prairie. 
 These bison have taken advantage of our kindness for far too long and brazenly flaunt the rules and regulations that make Gainesville a tolerant college 
town — and for that they deserve to die. 
I, for one, applaud commissioner Mike Byerly and 
Paynes Prairie officials for doing something proactive to stop what might possibly become a  nuisance to a 
number of rich people. 
Like a ticking time bomb, one of the bison could es-
cape into the fancy subdivisions that have popped up 
next to the protected land and knock over garbage cans and fences. 
The wealthy Gainesvillians who built their homes 
right next to Paynes Prairie have a reasonable expecta-tion of privacy against, you know, nature. 
On top of those totally valid concerns, Paynes Prairie 
workers don’t need to be fixing wooden fences out in the sweltering Florida heat. 
Overtaxed as they are with a heavy workload of mu-
ral making and quiet sitting, Paynes Prairie employees clearly don’t have the manpower to deal with bison.
Having exploited a misguided plan in the 1970s to 
restore Paynes Prairie to a more natural state, these con-niving quadrupeds snuck off into the tall grasses and sandy scrub-pine forests to engage in reckless bison sex 
and have anchor babies that are a drain on our natural 
resources.
Beyond this nefarious baby making, though, lies an 
even deeper issue that continues to vex public officials in our progressive and cultured hamlet — the damn bison never 
hang around the observation deck.
We built an observation deck to 
be able to enjoy the damn wildlife 
in our midst, and they run off and act all wild. 
It’s as if these bison can’t even 
read the clearly marked signs that 
point visitors toward the observation areas, or that they flat out refuse to speak English.
After opening up our hearts to these animals, they 
don’t even have the common courtesy to learn our na-tional language and embrace our city’s easygoing, lib-eral culture.
Dead or alive, these ungrateful animals need to be 
carted off our huge nature preserve.
Well, the plan calls for us to save a few female bison 
and pen them up in a tiny area so they can be seen from the observation deck. 
This seems like a fair compromise, as long as the fe-
males remain submissive and pose for the tourists.
Kudos to David Jowers, the Paynes Prairie manager 
who has been trying to kill off the unruly wild animals in his park for a few years. 
My only problem with his plan is he’s giving away 
all that free-roaming, plausibly organic bison meat for nothing.
As I’m sure Jowers and Byerly know all too well, a 
slice of bison on the dinner table beats a herd in the wild any day.

Student Alliance candidates running 
as independents
“I have never profited from public ser -
vice. I have earned every cent. I have never 
obstructed justice … Well, I’m not a crook. 
I’ve earned everything I’ve got.’”  
“Many of the independent candidates 
chose to run against the existing parties … 
rather than being responsible to a party.”
Can you guess which of these is a lie? 
Let me spoil it for you. They both are!  
The first is from former President Rich-
ard Nixon claiming innocence from the Watergate scandal, while the latter is from 
now-independent and former Student Al-
liance Senator Neil Gundavda claiming his “coalition” intended to run independent this semester.I don’t doubt the integrity of the  spokes-
man for the Student Alliance party and Neil’s confidant, Yevgen Sautin, when he stated his party wasn’t running this cycle.
But I can’t help but notice that the Stu-
dent Alliance party’s slate and the coali-
tion’s slate are one and the same. Does the 
creation of the coalition have anything to do with the fact the Student Alliance party failed to properly register the party’s slate 
and is covering it up?  
If the Student Alliance party is willing 
and able to spin lies into activism, what 
other methods of deception is it using when it comes to its actions in Senate and 
Student Government as a whole?

3LSLetters to the Editor THE MILITARY-FUNDED RESEARCH 
COULD ILLUMINATE THE BATTLEFIELD.
THE ASSOCIATED PRESS
NEW LONDON, Conn. — Someday , the 
secrets of fireflies or glowing sea plankton 
could save an American soldier in battle, a Navy SEAL on a dive or a military pilot land-ing after a mission.
That’s the hope behind a growing field of 
military-sponsored research into biolumines-cence, a phenomenon that’s under the micro-scope in laboratories around the country.
For scientists who specialize in biolumi-
nescence, an organism’s ability to illuminate with its own body chemistry , military research grants are offering a chance to break ground.
A possible military use of bioluminescence 
would be creating biodegradable landing zone markers that helicopters can spot even as wind from their rotors kicks up dirt.
The military could also develop biolumi-
nescent “friend vs. foe” identification markers and security systems, and methods to track weapons and supplies on the battlefield.
First described around 500 B.C. by the 
Greek philosopher Anaximenes, biolumines-
cence is familiar by its sight — if not its name 
— to children catching fireflies and to divers entranced by lanternfish and other sea life.
It’s also the factor behind the renowned Bio 
Bay in Vieques, Puerto Rico, where floating microorganisms called dinoflagellates leave neon-blue trails when disturbed.
The phenomenon is noteworthy because it 
creates light without heat, said Bruce Branchi-
ni, a chemistry professor at Connecticut Col-
lege in New London.
For the military, that could mean using 
bioluminescence to mark objects or locations wouldn’t make them vulnerable to an enemy with heat-seeking technology.
Branchini, who recently received a $225,000 
grant for his work studying lightning bugs, is examining ways to use their proteins to mu-
tate the greenish-yellow glow to create what’s 
called “far red.” That light, just short of infra-red, is just off the spectrum of human vision and is the same light produced in the signals of television remote controls.
“What they’re going to do with it, I don’t 
know,” Branchini said. “I don’t have secret clearance, I don’t go to secret meetings. They’ll work on the practical applications, but what 
interests me the most is the research portion.”
Hugh De Long, deputy director of math, 
information and life sciences at the Air Force 
Office of Scientific Research, said it has given about $500,000 in grants yearly for biolumi-nescence studies since 2002 or 2003.
The Office of Naval Research and the Na-
tional Science Foundation also give grants for bioluminescence work, sometimes several mil-
lion dollars at a time. They hope for long-term 
benefits for the military , health researchers and other government entities by encouraging the basic research with financial incentives.
De Long said although government re-
searchers also work on bioluminescence, tap-ping the knowledge of academics throughout the United States is key.
“It’s much more beneficial and efficient for 
the military to go out to the university com-munity and say , ‘Hey , look, this is an area that will tie in with some of the stuff we’re doing, and we want to fund that,’” De Long said.
Because it’s basic research, it hasn’t been 
used in many applications yet, he said. The university professors do publish their findings in papers, though, so the knowledge becomes available to the broader scientific world.
Soldiers have used bioluminescent crea-
tures in battle for centuries, including Japa-nese troops who smeared one creature’s dried remains on their wet hands to help them read maps and compasses during World War II.
But bioluminescence can be a foe, too, es-
pecially for the Navy if its vessels or divers are amid the microorganisms that glow when disturbed.
“Any boat, any submarine any scuba diver, 
Navy SEAL or whatever can leave a big long trail of light behind them,” said Sonke Johns-en, a marine biologist at Duke University in Durham, N.C. “That ultimately is a reason for the Navy to be concerned. With the right kind 
of camera you could see that from space, or at least from an airplane.”
Johnsen recently received a $7.3 million 
grant from the Office of Naval Research to 
study the brightness, reflection and other fea-
tures of sea creatures’ bioluminescence.
Like Branchini, Johnsen isn’t sure how the 
Navy might eventually be able to use his find-
ings but is glad for the chance to continue his research.
“I don’t do any classified research and it’s 
fairly basic, but some of it obviously could have some applications down the road for military purposes,” he said.
THE ASSOCIATED PRESS
BAGHDAD — The Iqraa book-
store on Mutanabi street has more than tripled in size in the last two years. Business is up 50 percent since 2003.
But, say the store’s two owners, 
the future is uncertain as long as they can’t count on safe streets, sta-ble government and reliable electric-ity supplies.
Yet Iqraa’s growth reflects a tiny 
step forward in a nation that centu-ries ago was a beacon of literature and science, and that has suffered 
sustained and bloody bouts of tur -
moil over the past 30 years.
Iqraa’s owners, Atta Zeidan 
and Mohammed Hanash Abbas, 
are close friends. In a series of in-terviews this summer, they talked about the winding down of the U.S. 
military mission in Iraq, the political 
deadlock since the March election, the still-fragile security situation and its impact on their business.
“Our dreams are one thing and 
the reality is another,” Zeidan la-mented.
The dreams came with Saddam 
Hussein’s overthrow in the 2003 
U.S.-led invasion. The reality , on 
one August morning, was a long power outage during a blistering sandstorm, and the nagging un-ease about violence which, though dramatically down since 2008, still manifests itself in sporadic, almost daily incidents.
“Our future plans depend on electricity, security and the econo-my,” Zeidan said.
The future also depends on how 
the Iraqi police and military manage without the Americans, all of whom will be gone by the end of next year. 
Both men said they had wel-comed the Americans as liberators but were now glad to see them leav-ing.
“No one in Iraq likes the idea of a 
stranger coming into his house,” said Zeidan. “This is our homeland.”
“A year ago, I used to say the Americans should stay , but not now,” said Abbas. “I think it is best if they leave, but without stopping their support for the government and the army.”
Zeidan and Abbas are Shiite 
Muslims, the majority that was long oppressed by Saddam and had the most to gain from his ouster.
The two men, both college gradu-
ates, opened their store in 1995, hop-ing to ease the poverty inflicted by the U.N. sanctions that had followed 
Saddam’s 1990 invasion of Kuwait. 
They had fewer tomes then and 
none of the glossy English and 
French learning exercise books they now import from Iran. 
Many people who came to the 
store wanted to sell their book col-lections, hoping the money would tide them over at a time when fami-
lies sold furniture, cutlery and china 
to make ends meet as the sanctions bit hard.
Today, what began as a second-
hand bookstore and a lending library for students has become a major supplier of texts and language-skills books for colleges across the coun-try.
Tucked among many other book-
stores on a street named for a 10th-century Baghdad poet, it is also one of the best sources of used books — some dating back a century — on Iraq, Islam and the Arab world.
In the past two years, Zeidan 
and Abbas have leased a store next door to expand, plus a storeroom 
in the dusty two-story mall where 
Iqraa (an Arabic command meaning “read”) is located.
“Business has been good the past 
year,” said Abbas, 47. “People’s pur -
chasing power is healthy, but every time there is a security situation, business drops.”8, ALLIGATOR  TUESDAY, SEPTEMBER 21, 2010

TEEING OFF WITH KYLE MAISTRI UF FOOTBALL QUOTABLEBy ANTHONY CHIANG
Alligator Staff Writer
achiang@alligator.org
 
With a win in each of the first 
three weeks of the season, the 
Gators should be pleased.
But the offense’s play has left 
plenty to be desired.
No. 9 Florida has intercepted 
just two fewer passes (10) than it 
has scored offensive touchdowns (12) this year.
After a second half in which it 
broke out for 209 rushing yards 
and 21 points against South Flor -
ida, the Gators didn’t carry that 
momentum into Tennessee, where they scored just seven points in the first half. 
And coach Urban Meyer isn’t 
sure when that consistency will 
come.
“I have seen us win games, I 
have seen us do some good things, 
but I have not seen enough to say that [the offense] is right on that edge,” he said.
A big part of the problem has 
been quarterback John Brantley’s inability to throw downfield. He is averaging only 5.72 yards per pass attempt this season. That number 
is the lowest by a Florida quarter -
back during Meyer’s tenure. The 
second lowest was in 2005 when Chris Leak averaged 7.05 yards per attempt.
Part of the problem has been 
the cautious approach the team has taken to begin the year. Florida hasn’t used many five-receiver sets in order to protect Brantley.
“It’s a little bit like when we 
had Chris Leak,” Meyer said. “We had to slow things down a little bit, protect him and make some plays. But you are going to see more five-
man protection, which means you 
have five available receivers.”Slow starts have also been a 
problem for the Gators, as they have not scored in the first quarter of any game this season.
“That’s awful,” Meyer said. 
“You’ll lose [against Kentucky] if 
you do that this week.”
Defending Cobb: Just one week after having to game plan 
against then-Southeastern Confer -
ence leading rusher Tauren Poole, the Florida defense will face anoth-er test Saturday.
Kentucky hybrid-threat Ran-
dall Cobb, who plays wide receiv-er and wildcat quarterback, poses nightmares to defenses with his versatility. 
Despite being attracted to those 
types of players, the Gators never offered a scholarship to Cobb — something Meyer regrets.
“I’m trying to find out who was 
recruiting that area,” he said. “I would fire them if they were here, but they are probably gone.”
Cobb already has racked up 
two receiving touchdowns, one 
rushing touchdown and one pass-
ing touchdown.
“With a player like Cobb, he 
can throw out of [the wildcat],” 
cornerback Jeremy Brown said. 
It’s almost like Tebow. He can fake run and you come up to [stop the 
run] and he’ll throw it over your 
head. So you just have to respect all phases — his arm, his leg, ev-erything.”
Injury Report: The number of 
injuries continues to diminish for the Gators.
Offensive guard Carl Johnson 
was the only UF player that need-
ed help off the field against Ten-
nessee, but Meyer said the senior is doing fine.
Offensive lineman James Wil-
son was not as fortunate. He un-derwent arthroscopic surgery on his knee Monday and will miss 
Saturday’s game against the Wild-
cats.
Alabama-Florida kickoff time 
set: The SEC announced that the Gators and the No. 1 Crimson Tide will face off at 8 p.m. on Oct. 2. The game will air on CBS.
Matt Tripp / Alligator Staff
UF coach Urban Meyer is not happy with the offense’s performance. The Gators have been held score-
less in the first quarter of each game this season.
Gators offense lacking downfield passing attack
Teryl Austin wants his players to stop 
tweeting. Or twittering. Or twerp-ing. Whatever it is they do — what 
are they calling it?
If it wasn’t for that damn Twitter, Aus-
tin wouldn’t have found himself answer -
ing questions about freshman cornerback Cody Riggs’ health last week. 
If it wasn’t for that damn Twitter, Cody 
Riggs wouldn’t have told all his follow-ers he came down with strep throat last week. 
Football teams — especially big-money 
SEC teams — micromanage their informa-tion outflow. If some detail can maybe, possibly, probably give opponents an edge, Florida is keeping it under lock and key. The Gators hide all practices from the public for a reason.
Info about the No. 3 cornerback’s throat 
is far from the worst news that can be leaked. 
Maybe a high school player will update 
his status from a strip club during his cam-pus visit, or maybe he will just pose with $16 and a gun, which he says is only filled 
with pellets.
Point is, Austin has a right to sweat. 
We’re college students and, at times, we’re really, really dumb.
But that’s only one side of the coin. 
Riggs was a member of one of the best recruiting classes in 
the nation, and so far the group has thrived 
with 10 true freshmen 
playing at Tennessee on Saturday.
The group has 
been close-knit since 
arriving on cam-
pus, something that would not have hap-
pened without social networking. Before 
signing their letters of intent, Florida oral 
commitments communicated frequently on Facebook.
And more important than being tight is the fact that the whole group came to Gainesville in the first place, which in part can also be chalked up to Mark Zuckerberg 
and his knack for giving young people ex-
actly what they want — a grammatically incorrect outlet to socialize with other peo-ple their age.
Pop psychologist Malcolm Gladwell 
wrote in “The Tipping Point” about “con-nectors,” the type of person who ignites a movement because they can spread in-formation to a lot of people. In the book, 
he uses the example of Lois Weisberg, the 
commissioner of cultural affairs for the

DAVIE — The Miami Dolphins have 
gone through four coaches and 13 quarter -
backs since their last 2-0 start.
That was back in 2002, when a team built 
on defense and ball control harbored play-off aspirations. The situation’s similar now, 
with consecutive road victories stamping Miami as a potential contender in the AFC East.
“Nobody really gave us a chance to be 
sitting where we are now,” running back Ronnie Brown said Monday. “We’ve got to keep grinding, but I like our chances, and everybody on the team is believing in what we’re doing.”
Unbeaten status this late in September is 
a big change for the Dolphins, who started 
0-2 each of the past four years. The 2-0 re-
cord with Miami is a new experience for every player but one — running back Ricky Williams, the lone remaining link to 2002.
“It’s exciting,” Williams said. “As a young 
team we’re gaining a lot of confidence, and it makes it much easier to buy into what the coach is saying when you’re winning.”
What coach Tony Sparano says is that his 
Dolphins are a work in progress, and it’s yet to be determined whether they’re ready for primetime. They’ll find out Sunday night against the archrival New York Jets (1-1), who are coming off a win over New Eng-land.
Miami’s two victories have been impres-
sive partly because of where they took place. First the Dolphins won at Buffalo. On Sun-
day they beat the Minnesota Vikings, who 
went 8-0 at home last year.
The last time Miami started a season with 
consecutive road wins was in 1977.
“That’s way before me,” said linebacker 
Cameron Wake, who wasn’t even alive then. “Every day since March, we were working toward starting fast. I know the last few years it hasn’t happened.”
Wake is one of 5 new starters on a swarm-
ing defense that has been the primary cata-lyst in Miami’s success. In the 14-10 win at Minnesota, the Dolphins had three sacks and four takeaways, and Brett Favre en-dured his worst day with the Vikings.
A collective effort started with the sec-
ondary . Cornerback V ontae Davis had an interception at the 1-yard line, broke up two 
other passes and made six tackles. Corner -
back Jason Allen was even better with two

Linebacker Karlos Dansby made nine 
tackles, including a stop on fourth and goal at the 1 with less than 3 minutes to go. Wake had 1½ sacks and forced a Favre fumble recovered for a touchdown by rookie Koa 
Misi, one of five first- or second-year pros 
seeing significant playing time under new defensive coordinator Mike Nolan.
“These first two games are a great start 
for our defense,” Dansby said. “These young guys are playing hard and are relentless.”

Some high school recruits rush 
through the recruiting process and 
verbally commit to schools long be-
fore National Signing Day.
Timmy Jernigan isn’t one of those 
recruits.
The four-star defensive tackle 
from Lake City Columbia High is taking his time in making his college decision and will wait until after this season to announce his commit-
ment.
“One of the scariest things is 
making the wrong decision,” Jerni-gan said. “I do not want to make the 
wrong decision.”
Jernigan, the No. 3 defensive 
tackle in the nation according to 
Rivals.com, has scholarship offers 
from some of college football’s most storied programs and is considering UF, FSU, LSU, Alabama and Michi-gan.
On Friday , Jernigan showed why 
so many colleges are vying for his signature on a letter of intent when February comes around.
In his team’s 22-14 win against 
visiting Buchholz High, Jernigan recorded five tackles and forced a timely fumble that ended a prom-
ising Buchholz drive in the second 
quarter. But he was also held to just 25 yards on six carries in what he described as a frustrating game for him, although his team left the field 
with a victory.
“I’d say it’s probably one of the 
worst games, mentally , I’ve played,” 
Jernigan said. “I made a couple 
good plays offensively and defen-
sively . … It wasn’t a 
good game mentally , though.”
 Despite being 
flagged for jump-ing offsides three 
times and drawing a personal foul for roughing the passer late in the 
fourth quarter, Jernigan dominated 
the opposing team’s offensive line on several occasions Friday. On one play , he blew through the line to help his defense stop Buchholz on a 
fourth-down run near the goal line 
late in the game.Even though Jernigan is one of 
the most sought-after recruits in the state, he isn’t tipping his hand about which school he is leaning toward.
“Everything’s pretty much even 
with me right now,” Jernigan said. “When it first started, [UF] and Flor -
ida State kinda jumped right ahead of everybody , but everything is kind of even right now because I realize 
you gotta make the best decision for 
yourself, not anybody else.”
While UF and FSU were Jerni-
gan’s early leaders, LSU’s stock ap-
pears to be rising for the 6-foot-2, 
275-pound defensive tackle. He said he felt at home when he visited LSU, one of the biggest factors for him in ultimately making his college deci-
sion.
“I want to feel like I’m home,” Jernigan said. “I want to have a chance to play and, most of all, I 
want to come out of there with a de-gree.”
With a big decision looming for 
Jernigan, and each of his top five choices in a dead heat for his ser -
vices right now, he said he plans on attending at least one game involv-ing each of the schools, including 
the UF-Alabama game Oct. 2 in Tus-
caloosa, Ala., the LSU-UF game in Gainesville on Oct. 9 and games at Michigan and USC.
But before he makes his final de-
cision, Jernigan wants to keep his mind set on his senior season at Co-lumbia.
“I’m really focused on what’s go-
ing on here,” he said. “I still got a lot of work to do.”

But her current job, she once 
opened a second-hand jewelry store, 
ran a drama troupe, ran a salon in-
side her house and served on the council of lawyers, among other gigs. By constantly changing, she became 
friends with actors, musicians, doc-
tors, lawyers, politicians and home-less people. 
Being a connector like Weisberg 
isn’t about holding a bunch of jobs, 
per se. It’s a personality type, a type 
that makes the world work. Weis-berg wasn’t important because of her work; she was important because her 
work led her to meet a lot of people 
and cultivate those friendships.
Freshman Trey Burton is also a 
connector. He grew up a Gators fan and orally committed two years be-
fore he could actually enroll. As a 
high school junior, he told me after an interview, “If you have any ques-tions or need any information about 
the 2010 recruiting class, just give me 
a text.”
He said he never wanted to pres-
sure other players to come to UF. He just wanted to connect the soon-to-
be Gators and, if anyone was on the 
fence, let those players know Florida was a good option.
This isn’t to suggest Burton was 
the only connector in the class. And 
don’t think players came to Florida 
just because they were Facebook friends with other commits. Players enroll at a school for several reasons, and friendship is just one of them.
But, at the very least, connectors 
like Burton help strengthen a group’s relationship and make the transition 
to UF easier.
Just don’t bother following Urban 
Meyer on Twitter. He said before 
the season that he doesn’t update his account himself. Meyer and Aus-
tin don’t see the need to tweet, and 
that’s OK.
Social networking is a young 
man’s game. But so is college foot-

TALLAHASSEE — Florida State quar -
terback Christian Ponder has a sore throw-
ing arm and will take it easy at practice this week.
Ponder wore a sleeve Monday to protect 
a bruised right tricep muscle he suffered in FSU’s Sept. 11 loss at Oklahoma. The injury stiffened up on him during Saturday’s 34-10 win over BYU.
“We’ll just cut his throws down and he’ll 
be fine,” coach Jimbo Fisher said.
“It’s a little tight,” conceded Ponder, 
who is getting daily treatment in the train-er’s room. “I’ll try and do as much as I can” 
in practice.
Ponder emphasized that he’s fully recov-
ered from a season-ending shoulder injury 
suffered against Clemson last November and the ensuing operation performed by 
renowned orthopedic surgeon Dr. James 
Andrews.
“My shoulder feels fine, my shoulder 
doesn’t both me at all,” Ponder said.
Florida State has been reluctant to dis-
cuss the status of its injured players, possi-bly indicating Ponder’s arm soreness could be troublesome for them, at least in the short haul.
Starting left tackle Andrew Datko did 
not play in Saturday’s win over BYU be-cause of a nagging shoulder injury, al-though there had been no announcement 
about his playing status. His replacement, 
Henry Orelus, was told Thursday he would start in Datko’s spot.
Florida State (2-1) opens its Atlantic 
Coast Conference season at home Saturday 
against Wake Forest (2-1), which has won in its last two visits to Tallahassee.
“It would be big for us to start on the 
right foot,” Ponder said.
Fisher wants his 22-year-old senior star 
as healthy as possible, although sophomore 
EJ Manuel led the Seminoles to a 41-28 vic-tory over the Demon Deacons in Winston-Salem, N.C., last November the week after Ponder was injured trying to make a tackle off of an interception.
Ponder, who was being promoted by 
the school over the summer as a Heisman Trophy candidate, is off to a slow start this season. He ranks ninth in the ACC in pass-
ing and eighth in total offense.
Ponder’s 509 yards in total offense is just seven yards more than what Michigan’s 
Denard Robinson piled up in the Wolver -
ines’ victory at Notre Dame earlier this month.
After three games, Ponder has thrown 
for 429 yards with his longest completion 
going for 34 yards. A year ago he had 813 
yards passing after three games.
