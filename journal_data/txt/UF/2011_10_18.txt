  At 4:45 Monday afternoon, 
Anastasia Ulanowicz’s children’s 
literature class was discussing 
“Little House on the Prairie” in Turlington Hall Room 2350.
  At 4:46 p.m., a loud alarm 
made Ulanowicz jump.
  A chemical spill in the base-
ment of Turlington caused the entire building and the adjoining restaurants to be evacuated.
  The building was closed for 
about an hour while UF Envi-ronmental Health and Safety em-ployees cleaned up the spill.
  Nader Abo Dya, 35, and Su-
vendu Biswas, 27, were com-bining chemical compounds in Room B115 when one of them dropped ﬁ  ve grams of 2-Chlo-
roethyl Isocyanate, a liquid 
compound that is combus-tible and moisture-sensitive.The compound’s uses range from 
chemotherapy treatment to the 
manufacturing of foams, paints and insulation materials, accord-ing to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. 
  It can be harmful if swallowed, 
inhaled or absorbed through the skin.
  The two students handling the 
compound  complained of burn-ing eyes and irritated lungs.

  Students may have a new Reitz 
Union without paying separate fees if the UF Board of Trustees approves a recent proposal.
  UF’s Local Fee Committee recom-
mended Wednesday that renovations and expansion of the Reitz Union be 
funded by Activity and Service stu-
dent fees, leftover student fee money and outside funding.
  The Activity and Service Fee funds 
comprise the about $17 million Student Government budget, and funds stu-
dent organizations and services such 
as RecSports, the Reitz Union and the student activities and involvement de-
partment. 
  Student Body Treasurer T.J. Villamil 
said the committee, which he is a mem-ber of, raises student fees by 5 percent 
each year, including the  Activity and Service Fee. 
  That means Activity and Service 
Fees and Athletic and Health Fees will increase by a total of $1.51 per credit 
hour for next year, said interim Vice 
President of Student Affairs Dave Kratzer. Of that increase, $0.87 would 
go toward the Reitz Union renovation 
project. 
  The committee also found leftover 
money from already-collected Activ-ity and Service Fees, and it expects to receive state money and alumni do-
nations, Villamil said. If approved by 
the board, the committee will use the money for the construction. 
  Students voted against additional 
Reitz Union fees in a referendum on the spring 2010 Student Government 
elections ballot. Fees committee outlines 
plan for Reitz renovationsAROUND GAINESVILLE
� MOST OF THE DONATED FOOD IS

  The Occupy Wall Street movement has 
rallied to collect about $300,000 dollars and 
a storage unit full of donations for New 
York City protesters. Occupy Gainesville is living off of organic and local food.
  Protesters receive daily deliveries of 
food to their headquarters on Bo Diddley Community Plaza.
  “It is mostly the community that’s been 
helping us out,” said Chris Sholtz, 34, a member of the movement’s media commit-
tee.
  She said the community’s support has 
made the occupation easier.
  “[Occupying] isn’t an inconvenience at 
all,” Sholtz said.  Harry’s Seafood, Bar & Grille has been 
donating water and ice. Big Lou’s is in 
charge of donating pizza. The Hare Krish-nas have donated vegan meals. Ward’s 
Supermarket takes care of the organic pro-
duce and gave Occupy Gainesville a line of credit.
  All donated meals are at least vegetar-
ian, if not vegan.
  If meat is served, it is served off to the 
side and out of the way. Of the food served to the protesters, 80 percent is organic and 
locally grown, said Francis Bennett, 43, an 
active member of the organization’s food  Markets, restaurants donate 
supplies to Occupy protesters

After almost 10 years of struggle, the prescrip-
tion drug database Florida State Sen. Mike Fasano 
has worked for went live Monday . 
The Electronic–Florida Online Reporting 
of Controlled Substances Evaluation program, 
known as E-FORCSE, allows physicians and phar -
macists to access the prescription drug histories of 
patients before writing or filling their prescrip-tions for highly addictive drugs like OxyContin.  
“It’s a long time coming … and it’s something 
that should have been done years ago,” said Fa-sano, R-New Port Richey. “Our hope is to save lives. 
“Pill mills” are health care facilities that pre-
scribe and dispense controlled substances in ways that are either outside the bounds of standard medical practices or are illegal in the state, accord-ing to the program’s website.
These programs aim to identify “doctor shop-
pers” — people who try to get prescriptions for a controlled substance from different health care practitioners. This practice is a felony in Florida, according to the website.
Prescription drugs kill six Floridians per day — 
five times as many as that are caused by all illegal drugs combined, also according to the website.Health care practitioners like pharmacists who 
dispense more addictive drugs such as Vicodin and Xanax must report the event in the database. 
Some exceptions do apply, such as when a per -
son provides one of these prescription drugs to a patient in a licensed hospital’s emergency room, according to an E-FORCSE fact sheet. 
Physicians aren’t required to check the data-
base before prescribing controlled substances. 
The implementation of the program was de-
layed by several factors, and it faced opposition 
from Florida Gov . Rick Scott. 
Pharmacists have been add-
ing information about prescrip-tion drug dispensations for at 
least the last 45 days before the 
database was up, Fasano said. 
Laura Tipton, pharmacy 
manager at the UF Student Health Care Center, said phar -
macists have been submitting 
information to the database since Sept. 1. The 
on-campus pharmacy has not yet started using 
the database in making prescription decisions, though. 
Florida isn’t the only state to have a prescrip-
tion drug monitoring program. Thirty-five other states across the U.S. have similar operations in place.Database goes live to curb ‘pill mills’
� OFFICIALS EXPECT TICKETS

Student tickets are still available 
for the Florida-Georgia game.
The Alligator reported Friday that 
500 of the 5,500 student tickets were 
still available. 
As of noon Monday , tickets still 
were not sold out, said Mark Gajda, assistant athletics director for ticket operations. Gajda said fewer tickets were available Monday than were available Friday , but he declined to give an exact number.
Gajda said he wasn’t sure whether 
tickets had remained on sale for this 
long in recent years but said having 
unsold tickets five days after going on sale is unusual. 
Florida-Georgia is considered one 
of the season’s most popular games and biggest rivalries. Tickets usually sell out within a few hours.
“We’re attributing it to people not 
traveling to away football games any-more as they have in previous years,” Gajda said.
The sluggish economy and rela-
tively high gas prices may also be to blame for the slow sale, Gajda said.
The game will be in Jacksonville at 
3:30 p.m. on Oct. 29 and will be broad-cast live on CBS. Tickets cost $40 and 
can be bought on gatorzone.com. 
Tickets should sell out by mid-
week, Gajda said.
Students who have purchased 
tickets for the game will be able to 
collect them next week. Further de-tails will be emailed to students after the sale ends.Student ticket sales still 
down for Florida-Georgia

  The Gator Nation will have a 
solar-powered car to add to its al-
ternative energy collection, thanks to Solar Gators, a new club at UF.
  Created this semester by ma-
terials science and engineering sophomore Jason Rosen, 19, and mechanical engineering freshman Ben Rosenthal, 18, the club plans to design, build and race a solar-powered car. 
  The Solar Gators will debut at 
the Formula Sun Grand Prix race in summer 2013, Rosen said.
  After that, Rosen said he hopes 
the team will progress to the American Solar Challenge, which races across the United States, and eventually race in the World Solar Challenge across the Australian Outback. 
  Rosen and Rosenthal began 
racing solar-powered cars to-gether at South Plantation High. Their high school team, the So-lar Knights, raced around the Texas Motor Speedway in 2008 and 2009. In 2010, the team raced across the United States from Tex-
as to Colorado. That experience
 prompted them to start a team at 
UF.
  “I found my passion for alter-
native energy and the green move-
ment and wanted to bring that to 
other people,” Rosen said. 
  He said collegiate teams have 
access to more resources than high school 
teams.   Solar Gators members are in the 
process of reaching out to corpora-tions for funding, Rosenthal said. 
  Rosen said Solar Gators is aim-
ing to raise about $150,000 in prep-
aration for the race. The group has $250 so far.
  The club has about 30 members, 
Rosen said, and is looking to expand. UF stu-dents of all majors are encouraged 
to join.
  “There are still opportunities for 
those who are not in engineering to 
get involved,” Rosenthal said. 
  Rosen said the team should be 
composed of students from mul-
tiple majors and back-grounds because building a solar-powered car is an interdisciplinary 
task.
  The team is currently focusing 
on the design and marketing phas-
es of the project.
  After the logistical tasks are 
completed, building will begin, he said.

Ramen noodles, frozen 
pizza and canned foods are 
staples in a college student’s 
diet, and these foods have 
one thing in common: high amounts of sodium.
According to a study con-
ducted by the International Food Information Council Foundation, most college-aged individuals are not concerned with how much 
sodium they consume. 
The results of the study, 
released last month, state 
that only 22 percent of 18- to 
24-year-olds are somewhat 
concerned about personal sodium intake.
Dietary sodium has re-
ceived a lot of attention due 
to its possible effect on blood 
pressure and the frequency of hypertension in the U.S. population, according to the 
foundation’s October news-
letter.
In one day, a healthy per -
son should consume no more 
than 2,300 milligrams of so-
dium, which is the equiva-lent of about one teaspoon of salt. 
An American adult con-
sumes about 3,400 milli-grams of sodium every day, according to the 2010 Dietary 
Guidelines for Americans.
“New incidences of high 
blood pressure among col-
lege students are definitely increasing,” said Janis Mena, 
a registered dietitian at the 
UF Student Health Care Cen-ter. 
Making meals at home is 
the first step in controlling sodium intake. 
 “Nobody needs to eat out 
every day,” she said. “Even having your own turkey sandwich is better than eat-ing fast-food meals.”
If a student chooses 
to eat convenient pro-cessed food, he or she can still limit sodium intake.  
“I call it the dilution fac-tor,” she said. “Add  
fresh chicken or a head of broccoli to a frozen meal, and make two servings out 
of one.”
This method can cut so-
dium levels in half.
In addition, eating more 
fruits and vegetables and us-
ing herbs and spices to flavor 
food are good ways to limit 
sodium intake.
Katie Riden, 18, a psy-
chology freshman, said stu-dents buy convenience foods because they are easy to cook 
and can be stored for a long 
time.
“We just want food, and 
we want it now,” Riden 
said.

ing and doing other things to 
cook.”Study shows that young 
adults eat too much salt� THE EVENT WAS PART OF BREAKING THE

UF’s Model United Nations and Human.I.T.Y. 
hosted a simulation of the United Nations Human 
Rights Council on Monday night to brainstorm solu-
tions to the war in the Congo. 
The event was held as part of Breaking the Silence: 
Congo Week, which is held Oct. 16 to 22. 
Human.I.T.Y. president Roberta Roberts, 21, a 
public relations senior, spoke about corruption in Congo, one of the poorest countries in the world. She also spoke about the recent deployment of special U.S. troops to Africa in search of Joseph Kony, leader of 
the Lord’s Resistance Army.“This is going on right now as we speak; this is 
why we as a body must act now,” Roberts said. 
UF’s Model United Nations Vice President Saman-
tha White, a 20-year-old criminology and political sci-
ence junior, and Model U.N. director of external af-

and engineering junior, had everyone sit in a horse-shoe as Human Rights Council members to come up 
with possible solutions.
Last year, first-year sustainable development prac-
tice graduate student Tshitshi Kalala, 37, relocated to

Electric chair, firing 
squad are cruel
Someone needs to remind Florida state Rep. Brad Drake, 
(R-Eucheeanna) that it’s 2011 and not 1800. 
It might be hard to give him the message, though, 
given Drake’s affinity for all things antique. Reaching him on a 
cellphone or via email might be futile. 
One has to wonder if Drake believes computers are the 
work of the devil or that camera phones steal your soul. 
How long did it take Drake to draft his latest piece of legis-
lation on his typewriter?
According to his latest bill, Drake believes the best way to 
rid the state of Florida of all the controversy surrounding lethal injections is to do away with the practice altogether. 
No, Drake is not against the death penalty; he just prefers 
more “traditional” methods.  
Not only does Drake want to bring back the electric chair, 
or “Old Sparky” as he calls it, he wants to give prisoners the option of death by electrocution or, if they are feeling adventur -
ous, death by firing squad. 
Gee, the options are so good, how do you pick which one 
to take? 
Instead of a cocktail of drugs, Drake would like to see death 
row inmates get a “lead cocktail.” 
Well, that’s not entirely true. According to an interview with the Florida Current, Drake’s 
execution method of choice would be just to “throw them off the Sunshine Skyway bridge and be done with it.” 
The Eighth Amendment talks about cruel and unusual pun-
ishment, not cruel and unusual execution. 
All kidding aside, Drake’s proposal would put an already 
problematic system in an even worse state. 
Whether one supports it or not, one cannot argue that the 
death penalty does not deserve great sensitivity and scrutiny 
by lawmakers and the public. 
The system, although there are many appeals processes 
through which a convicted death row inmate can go, is not al-
ways perfect. 
As of 2010, 138 death row inmates were found innocent or 
pardoned in light of new evidence, according to the Death Pen-alty Information Center.
While not a huge number, given the population of those cur -
rently on death row (about 3,250 as of January 2011), even one 
exception should make proponents and opponents question 
the ability of our justice system to rightfully determine guilt. 
That being said, firing squads, like electrocution, are ex-
tremely inefficient. People have survived both, which is a 
strong reason for ending each practice. 
How Drake casually discusses the killing of  people should 
frighten everyone, especially those in his district. 
If an executed inmate is later found to be innocent, what 
recourse is there for politicians like Drake?Campus tours leave out the important stuff
Sometimes, I like to wake up early, get a delicious break-
fast from “Not My Dorm Room” and grab a bench out-side to do some reading.
This is not every morning. I’m not that much of an adult 
yet.
But with this new weather in town, it’s nice to just sit 
and relax outside. I might look a little foolish trying to con-trol my papers and food wrappers against the wind, but it’s definitely worth it.
However, I keep forgetting that it’s campus tour season, 
when Cicerones take groups around the school to show them what it’s like.
I think we’re all in on the joke here at UF: the extreme 
difference between what they tell you on campus tours and 
the actual reality of life.
Last Friday, I was enjoying one of my bench breakfasts 
when, all of a sudden, a group of apathetic high school stu-
dents and their skeptical parents were led in front of me. I was planted near University Auditorium, a stop on the tour.
The Cicerones, ever-perky and slightly quirky, gave the 
information about the auditorium. One thing they didn’t mention — and one of my favorite facts — was that the infa-
mous “Don’t Tase Me, Bro!” incident occurred there. When 
I went on my campus tour, that tidbit was one of the things that stuck out and was much more interesting than what-ever stories the tour guides mentioned about the building.
They went on to explain to this group all about Turling-
ton Hall: It’s the most confusing building on campus, yadda yadda. From there, they talked about the hustle and bustle of Turlington Plaza.
They explained how busy the plaza gets during the day. 
They also briefly mentioned the tables of organizations and groups where people will talk to you about their various causes.
One thing was left out, however, when discussing the 
free speech areas on campus. Now, I understand that we can’t just divulge every dirty secret about the real UF, but there are some things I wish I was told before starting my academic career here. People need to start warn-
ing freshmen about the religious 
nutjobs and “fliering” vultures 
that inhabit Turlington. It’s not pleasant to be screamed at dur -
ing your first semester about the multitudes of ways that you are definitely going to hell, then walk two steps and be force-fed a flier for an apartment complex that 
you will never live in.
I’m just saying that a little warning would have been 
nice.
Maybe there should be a second campus tour; and I 
don’t mean whatever happens at Preview.
It would tell you to listen to your iPod as you walk 
through Turlington if you don’t want to get harassed. Si-multaneously, it would remind you to be polite if you are ever required by a club to do some fliering and to not be a dweeb about it. Calmly engage people in conversation. No 
one likes a Unite hawk.
That tour would explain that absolutely no one calls it 
“Club West” and that Criser’s toe goes un-rubbed.
My tour would tell you not to be “that person” who talks 
on the phone in your dorm’s hallway in the middle of the 
night. Nothing is that important. Just go to sleep.
It would remind you to please actually use the recycling 
bins that are now all over campus; there’s a reason the trash cans are now labeled  “landfill.” Of course, it’s there to mor -
ally blackmail you.
Oh, and Krishna lunch isn’t weird. It’s cheap and deli-
cious; get over it.
If you’re a freshman student reading this, you’ve prob-
ably already noticed how coated in sugar your campus tour was. If you’re an old soul like me, then you realized it some time ago. That’s the point of those tours, if you ask me. They give UF students a wonderful inside joke with one another.

Vote to name UF most vegan-friendly
Energized from a powerhouse intern-
ship during the summer of 2010 at the larg-
est animal rights organization in the world, People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA), I had this crazy idea that I could 
change the world one plate at a time.             
So in July 2010, I began working on 
changing the way the sixth-largest univer -
sity in the nation ate every Monday by em-
barking on a revolutionary Meatless Mon-day campaign. 
My phone bills were enormous those 
first few months from gathering national endorsements from organizations like the 
Humane Society and the Earth Day Net-
work. I didn’t get much sleep as I worked to collect almost 2,500 petition signatures from Gators who also thought we should revisit the idea of what we eat on Mon-days.            
And in November 2010, only four 
months after I began galvanizing support from all of you at the largest land-grant 
university in the Southeast, UF’s Gator 
Dining Services agreed it wanted to help change the world — one meatless plate at a time.            
Sort of.            I was both ecstatic and shocked when I 
heard UF’s food services agreed to discuss my proposal to have a vegetarian menu in its two on-campus dining halls, Gator Cor -
ner Dining Center and Broward Dining Hall, on Mondays. Gator Dining Services’ sustainability coordinator met with me and unfurled beautiful, new, specific-to-UF Meatless Monday posters and placards to be placed at both dining halls to alert hungry Gators to UF’s new commitment to healthy , sustainable and ethical dining.             
That was almost a year ago, and that’s 
where we are now. Now it’s time to judge.            
The first round of voting in PETA’s an-
nual most-vegan-friendly college poll ends today. It’s up to all of us how we should vote. Before you head to peta2.com to vote, consider this: It’s up to all of us, not just the vegan and vegetarian Gators, but it’s up to all of us how we should reward our uni-versity .           
As the organizer of the Mondays cam-
paign at UF, I will be the first one to say our dining staff is wonderful. I know most of them personally , and they’re all genuinely fantastic people.             
And so this is nothing personal, but we 
can do better.            
As Gators, we have to decide: Do we 
reward UF with a vote as the most vegan-friendly college for creating an extremely extensive vegetarian and vegan dining guide for all restaurants on campus? Or do we vote for one of its competitors because UF’s sluggish movement toward a truly Meatless Monday , which has been publicly 
endorsed by both GatorWell and UF’s Of-
fice of Sustainability , deserves to be noted?            
Do we vote for UF as the most vegan-
friendly college in the nation for maintain-ing at least one vegan station at both dining halls at lunch and dinner, or do we vote for one of its competitors because UF refuses to listen to the nearly 2,500 of you who last year publicly called for a Meatless Mon-
day?            
The decision is up to you.            
For me, I will be voting in favor of UF 
and Gator Dining Services. The work be-ing done at UF, while extremely slow, is undoubtedly meaningful. At one of the nation’s largest schools, UF has the unique potential to set the course for the rest of the nation by offering a truly Meatless Monday 
in its two dining halls.            
But my vote will be used as more of a 
call to action. My vote will be used to show 
UF how much more can be done to ensure we all have the ethical and sustainable din-ing we deserve.            
It was the late Steve Jobs who said, “The 
ones who are crazy enough to think they can change the world are the ones who 
do.”            
Let’s be crazy, Gators. Let’s help UF 
change the world. Vote today by 5 p.m. at 
peta2.com.

Meat-Free Mondays at UF Letter to the Editor
Of the more than one million people 
living with HIV in the U.S., one in five does not know they have it.
As students, we need to educate our -
selves and our friends about the disease. People must understand that they are at risk. 
Florida ranks third in the nation for 
the greatest number of people infected with HIV . According to the Florida De-partment of Health, Alachua County has about 1,000 known cases, 16 percent of 
which are between the ages of 20 to 29 and 
18 percent of which are people over 50 — yes, contrary to what young people like to think, our parents and grandparents are 
still having sex.
You cannot contract the virus from a 
handshake, sneeze or kiss. Nor can you 
get it if your bottom brushes against the toilet seat. But you can get it from sharing 
needles or having unprotected sex. 
As students, we think of ourselves as 
“responsible adults.” But we use our edu-
cation as a shield to defend our behavior 
and deflect the HIV “label” onto others.
Don’t let education fool you. Members 
of our UF community are also members 
of the HIV community. And they should not be stigmatized when many who call 
themselves “responsible” engage in risky 
behavior all the time. 
“Does education help? Yes, people 
know [about the virus], but there are un-
derlying issues,” said Teresa White, Mi-
nority AIDS Coordinator at the Alachua County Department of Health. “You don’t have to be promiscuous. They think, ‘Just this once,’ and then, when you add alco-
hol or drugs or too much trust, now we 
have the situation we have.”
And if you have or have had another 
sexually transmitted disease, you are at an 
even higher risk.
HIV does not discriminate. Heterosex-
uals account for 31 percent of new infec-tions, and women 
account for 27 percent. Though 
certain minorities 
have higher prevalence rates, the virus in-
fects every ethnic group and race. 
“If you are having oral, anal or vaginal 
sex with multiple people, you are at risk,” White said. 
It’s about adding sexual health to your 
list of personal values, she said. The stig-mas associated with condoms and getting 
tested should not interfere with caring for 
your body.
GatorWell provides free and confiden-
tial testing, not to mention an assortment 
of condoms, lubricants and dental dams. 
There is also free testing every third Thurs-day from 8 p.m. to 11 p.m. at BODYTECH Tattooing and Piercing on University Av-enue downtown.
Sexuality is a sensitive subject, but do 
not let fear of embarrassment stop you from protecting your health. 
“Testing should be a regular part of 
your sexual health screening,” White said. “Somebody who asks you to get tested is a good person. People get offended. They shouldn’t.”
White has seen an increase in the num-
ber of students getting tested because they realize they are at risk. 
“Until people can realize that, they’ll 
be in denial,” she said.
Two decades ago, an HIV diagnosis 
was a death sentence, but now it is seen as a chronic disease that is certainly manage-able with antiretroviral drugs. The sooner you get tested, the sooner you can receive 
medication and do your part to prevent 
transmission.
You want to be truly “responsible?” Get educated. Speak up. Use a condom. 
Get tested. Join the fight.

Speaking OutHe arrived on the scene four min-
utes later and pulled the fire alarm to 
evacuate the building.
Turlington’s old fire alarms, which 
sound more like the low-pitched buzz of a loud generator than the shrill alarms of newer buildings, confused some stu-
dents and professors about whether to 
leave the building or stay put.
“Our professor initially thought 
we should just stay in class,” said Erin Domaracki, an 18-year-old exploratory 
freshman who was in Geography of Af-rica when the alarm sounded.
Domaracki and her classmates even-
tually joined the other students slowly 
filing down hallways and stairwells to 
stand outside Turlington.
Some classes were immediately can-
celed as UPD officers announced the 
building’s closure. Others, like Ulano-wicz’s class, picked up where they left 
off on the benches near the University 
Auditorium. 
UPD blocked southbound traffic on 
Newell Drive for about an hour and a 
half, causing some bus routes to be di-

Occupy Gainesville protesters line University Avenue on Wednesday. The protesters who still occupy Bo 
Diddley Community Plaza live off organic and local food deliveries.
At least seven local businesses have made donations to the cause
and comfort committee.
He said his goal is to “get 
the most nutritious and hearty 
meals to people.”
One supporter has been 
cooking and delivering break-
fast and dinner since Wednes-
day, Sholtz said.
At least seven businesses 
have donated food or supplies 
to the movement since the oc-cupation started.
Jennifer Vito, 33, owner of 
1982 and a member of Occupy Gainesville, is donating elec-tricity.
“As a business owner and 
an individual, I am here to help in any way I can, whether it is by donating power strips, hav-ing arts shows or hosting fund-
raisers,” she said. 
The goal of 1982, a local mu-
sic bar, runs parallel to what 
Occupy Gainesville is trying to 
do, Vito said.“Already, our mission [is] 
to be a community space and support the arts,” she said. 
“Already, so much of the com-munity is involved in Occupy Gainesville.”
1982 lets Occupy Gainesville 
protesters use some of its power strips to power laptops, phone chargers and anything else that makes the occupation easier.
All trash created by the 
cooking process goes into per -
sonal compost piles at the pro-testers’ homes, Bennett said.
“We’re fighting for people’s 
rights,” Bennett said. “We’re pointing out where the little man is getting squashed.”Occupy , from page 1EDuc ATION

Elementary and middle school students 
may have a tougher time passing Florida’s fa-
vorite standardized test next year. 
The Florida Department of Education pro-
posed stricter scoring guidelines for the FCAT 
exams that would go into effect in 2012. The 
changes must be approved by the State Board of Education, which is expected to review the changes in December.
The proposed changes follow earlier re-
visions that went into effect this school year. These revisions changed some of the exams’ content and added a new end-of-course exam for high school students in algebra. 
The FCAT exams are annual standardized 
tests in math and reading for students in third grade through 10th grade. There is also an FCAT writing exam, for fourth-, eighth- and 10th-graders, and an FCAT science for fifth- and eighth-graders and high school juniors.Scores are used to make decisions regard-
ing students’ course placement, and passing scores are required for high school gradua-tion. The scores are also used to assign public schools A through F grades based on their stu-dents’ performances. This grade helps dictate the amount of state funding the school will re-ceive — something that may also be impacted by the stricter standards.
Students will still be scored on a scale of 1 
to 5, with 3 being satisfactory , but it will take a better performance on the exam to get that 3.
For example, had the proposed grading 
system been in effect for last year’s test, the percentage of third-graders scoring at grade level would have dropped from 78 percent to 56 percent on the math exam and from 72 per -
cent to 57 percent on the reading exam. A simi-lar effect would have been seen for students 
through seventh grade. 
However, the percentage of eighth-grade 
students scoring at grade level on the read-
ing exam would have remained the same, and for ninth- and 10th-graders, it would have 
increased from 48 percent to 55 percent and 
from 39 percent to 56 percent, respectively . 
Dan Boyd, superintendent for the Alachua 
County School District, said the new grading scale was proposed in an effort to standard-ize the expectations of students from third 
through 10th grade.
Previously, for 10th-
grade students to pass the 
FCAT reading exam, they 
would have needed a score that placed them in the 80th percentile in the United 
States, Boyd said. The 50th percentile would be aver -
age.
Boyd said though this may help high school 
students who struggle to meet graduation re-
quirements, it could have the opposite effect 
on Alachua County elementary and middle school students. 
He said the county is expecting to see an increase in the number of elementary and 
middle school students retained, as well as 
a decrease in the number of A schools in the county.
“It’s hard to attain the bar when it keeps 
moving on us,” said Karen Clarke, director of secondary curriculum for Alachua County.
If approved, these changes would accom-
pany the new tests that will be unveiled in 2012, including end-of-course exams in biol-
ogy and geometry.
In addition to the algebra exam, incoming 
high school freshmen must now pass geom-
etry and biology exams after they complete these courses  to graduate. These exams will constitute 30 percent of their final grades in these courses.
One problem with this system, Clarke said, 
is  some schools in Florida may not have the 
technology or the money to use the computer-
based testing system. 
“There’s been no funding from the state to 
increase that infrastructure,” she said.
Proposed FCAT changes could mean fewer A schools in county
Union needs structural repairs
Villamil said being able to fund the proj-
ect without additional fees was unexpected, 
but everything has fallen into place.
“Students have been wanting it for a 
while, and clearly after the referendum, students didn’t want to pay a new fee,” Vil-
lamil said. 
Neither Kratzer nor Villamil knew of an-
other school that was able to renovate and expand without charging students addi-tional fees. 
Sean Fahy, chairman of the Reitz Union 
Board of Managers, said the building needs structural and technical repairs. The build-
ing opened in 1967. 
He said the proposed expansion would 
provide collaboration areas and lounge space and make student organizations more 
visible. 
“We want to have students discover themselves in the Union and find that place that is their second home on campus,” he said.
Many organizations are currently housed 
in the building’s third floor.
The Reitz Union Board of Managers start-
ed a “Make it Reitz” campaign last year and has started a petition. Fahy said about 2,700 
or 2,800 students have signed the petition so 
far, and the board knows of about 40 letters 
of support. The board’s goal is to have 5,000 
signatures and 100 letters by the time the Board of Trustees reviews the recommenda -
tion in December. FEES , from page 1

When Dr. Scott A. Rivkees joins the UF and Shands family , 
he won’t do it alone.
Multiple National Institutes of Health grants, continuous 
funding from NIH institutes and international recognition as 
a pediatric expert are among the assets that Rivkees will bring 
with him. 
In January , Rivkees will replace Dr. Richard Bucciarelli as 
the head of the UF College of Medicine pediatrics department 
and as the physician leader at Shands Hospital for Children. 
Rivkees is a member of the Yale University School of Medi-
cine staff and sees patients at a private practice. He will take more of a leadership role with UF and Shands. 
“One part I’m very excited about is being able to apply aca-
demic growth and development and to grow the research base more broadly than I do now,” he said. 
Rivkees graduated from Rutgers University and the Uni-
versity of Medicine and Dentistry of New Jersey . He also held a faculty position at Harvard Medical School while receiving his postdoctoral training there and at Massachusetts General Hospital. He is board-certified in pediatrics and pediatric en-docrinology.
Perhaps best known for his 2009 discovery of an adverse 
effect caused by a popular medication for Graves’ disease, Riv-kees focuses mostly on researching the effects of medications on the mother and fetus during pregnancy. 
Rivkees is also the editor-in-chief of the International Jour -
nal of Pediatric Endocrinology . 
Rivkees noted that medicine is constantly changing and has 
global impacts. 
“In many places, medication is met with dismay ,” he said. 
“I was extraordinarily impressed by the leadership of UF and their commitment to make medicine grow.”Renowned physician to head Shands Hospital for Children

Throughout the day , 
students at about 1,800 
schools across the country 
have pledged to remain silent for the 2011 Pro-Life Day of Silent Solidarity.
“Silent Solidarity is a 
day we set aside to remain 
silent in honor of those 
who were silenced because of abortion,” UF Pro-Life Alliance Secretary Joshua Brewer said. 
Students will wear 
red duct tape across their mouths with the word “life” on it or red armbands 
as part of the daylong, na-tionwide protest, which is 
organized by Stand True Ministries and Priests for Life. 
The UF Pro-Life Alliance 
will hold a demonstration today on the Plaza of the Americas  at 1 p.m. where members will raise aware-
ness about the 50 million 
children who have been aborted in the U.S., Brewer said. 
“This day of solidar -
ity seeks to raise awareness about the sanctity of life and the importance of hu-man life from conception to 
human death,” said Henry 
Zmuda, Pro-Life Alliance faculty adviser. “Often our society is one who takes ad-vantage of those who don’t have a voice, are weak and can’t defend themselves.” Students vow to

Florida coach Billy Donovan said sophomore forward Will Yeguete (15) will be key on the boards this 
season for the Gators, who lost 50.7 percent of their rebounding output from a year ago with the depar -
ture of seniors Vernon Macklin, Alex Tyus and Chandler Parsons. 
JOHN BOOTHE
Alligator Staff Writer
At first, it looked to coach Billy 
Donovan that sophomore Will Yeg-
uete had enjoyed too many pastries 
this summer while playing abroad 
for the French national team.
But after the Gators’ opening 
weekend of practice, Yeguete’s 
play, not his conditioning, drew his 
coach’s attention.
“I really thought Casey Prather 
and Will Yeguete, in terms of un-derstanding what we need from 
them, [have] been really good,” 
Donovan said.
Yeguete, a 222-pound forward, 
was listed with Prather, Scottie Wil-
bekin and Cody Larson as Dono-
van’s four key players heading into this year. In order for Florida to be successful, Donovan said it’s a necessity for the group to go af-
ter loose balls, defend better and 
be strong rebounders  — Yeguete’s 
specialties.
The Gators lost 50.7 percent of 
their rebounding output from last 
season following the departures 
of center Vernon Macklin and for -
wards Alex Tyus and Chandler 
Parsons. 
“Will continues to be a guy 
that’s going to have to help us on the backboard, rebounding-wise,” Donovan said. “I said it on the first 
day: One of my concerns was losing 
Chandler, Vernon and Alex. We lost a lot of rebounding, and we have to be scrappier on the glass.”
After playing just 7.1 minutes 
per game with Florida last year, the 6-foot-7 Yeguete enjoyed a stand-out stint as a starter on France’s U20 team at the FIBA European Cham-
pionships. In nine games during 
July, he averaged 6.2 points and hauled in a team-high 5.6 boards.
“Whatever Coach D wants me to 
do, I will 
do it,” 
Yeguete said. “It’s 
not always going to be the same as 
it was this summer, but as long as I 
can help my team and be produc-tive, that’s all that matters.”
Though he played sparingly 
for the Gators as a freshman, Yeg-
uete was efficient. He snagged a 
rebound every 2.7 minutes he was on the floor — the best average on the team.
Sophomore Patric Young, a 
6-foot-9 center, said Yeguete is also the toughest defender during prac-tice due to his length and physical-ity.  
“It’s just anger,” Yeguete said. “Just wanting to get it. You Gators look to Yeguete to fill rebounding void left by seniors

Halftime often marked a shift for 
Florida last season but rarely in the 
right direction.
In 15 losses, the Gators surren-
dered five double-digit leads and were outscored by an average of 8.7 points in the second half. 
“It’s a terrible lesson to learn,” 
senior guard Jordan Jones said. “But (it’s) almost something that you need to learn, so that it doesn’t happen in 
the future.”
Florida did a lot of learning dur -
ing the 2010-11 campaign, adjusting 
to an up-tempo style while adding six new players to the fold.
Part of that learning process in-
volved an increased focus on en-durance and late-game mentality, significant factors in the Gators’ post-Florida seeking offseason 
cure for second-half woesBRYAN HOLT

The decision came from Kristy Jaeckel’s 
family before she ever stepped on campus.
Knowing their daughter would be start-
ing college at a young age due to her late 
birthday, the Jaeckels suggested Florida redshirt the 6-foot-2 outside hitter.
“We’re getting the payback, the divi-
dends from the decision her family made during the recruiting process,” UF volley-ball coach Mary Wise said. “Kristy, now in her fifth year, is in the best shape of her life.”
Called “Grandma” by teammates, Jaeck-
el has seen a number of changes over the years. When she first arrived on campus, the Littleton, Colo., native was excited but unsure. Now she’s in a stretch where she 
has recorded double-digit kills in 13 straight 
games. 
“Being here, you get 
kind of star-struck,” Jaeck-
el said. “You’re surround-ed by so many All-Ameri-can players. … It took me 
a while to adapt to this level of volleyball and the school and working out 
and just the overall schedule.”

shirt senior is currently playing the best Jaeckel  playing best volleyball

rebounders from 2010-11halftime woes.
“Some games — and I’m guilty of it — I let fatigue take 
over,” senior guard Deana Allen said.
To help address the problem, coach Amanda Butler hired 
new strength and conditioning coordinator Rich Jacobs in the 
offseason.
Since arriving in July, Jacobs has impressed his players, 
prompting Jones to call this offseason the “most focused” of her Florida career.
“He’s taken us to a much different level,” sophomore 
guard Jaterra Bonds said. 
“He’s gotten us much stronger and faster and mentally 
tougher.
“We’ve done some things we never expected we could 
have done last summer.”
Jacobs utilized Ben Hill Griffin Stadium for the squad’s 
summer training, con-ducting a variety of workouts in the facil-ity.
Activities in The Swamp included a snake drill that had 
the players ascend the steps by running between each row and an exercise Bonds referred to as “Gator Mountains.”
The latter workout required players to run up the steps of 
the stadium while carrying a teammate.
“You’re dying and you have a teammate in your ear say-
ing, ‘Don’t drop me. Let’s do it. You got it,’” Jones said. “So, it’s definitely a team-building activity, and it’s a confidence-builder.”
Bonds, who carried Jones, said Jacobs tried to match the 
players based on size, but not everyone was so lucky with 
their pairing.
A laughing Bonds recounted how freshman guard Carlie 
Needles, who is 5-foot-6, had to deal with the “long legs” of 
6-foot-1 senior forward Ndidi Madu.
“Going into that, we were like, ‘You’re crazy. There’s no 
way,’” Jones said. “But we found a way through and we pushed through it.”
Underperforming in the second half ultimately served as 
the death knell for Florida’s NCAA Tournament aspirations 
last season.
However, the Gators return 10 players who have those 
mistakes committed to memory and have fueled what Jones 
calls a “sense of urgency.”
“We’re ready,” she said. “Last year, we were trying to 
sneak up on people, and this year we want people to be like, ‘Hey, that’s Florida, who’s returning everyone.’ We’re ready for that challenge.” TUESDAY, OCTOBER 18, 2011 § ALLIGATOR, 15

Scoring chances were easy to 
come by for the Gators last week-
end.
Goals, on the other hand, were 
not so simple.
During a two-game weekend 
road trip through the Magnolia State in which the Gators defeat-ed Ole Miss and fell to Mississip-
pi State, Florida was dominant in 
every aspect of the game but one: 
finishing.
In a 2-0 win Friday night, No. 
11 Florida outshot Ole Miss 16-3.  While freshman midfielder 
Havana Solaun scored a goal in each half, coach Becky Burleigh felt the Gators were not efficient and should have converted more chances.
The struggles were more evi-
dent Sunday against Mississippi State, as Florida could not find the back of the net while taking 16 more shots. 
The Bulldogs, who scored 
in the opening minute, escaped with the win.
After the early goal, the Bull-
dogs played conservatively and kept several players behind the ball. 
Burleigh said the Gators did 
a good job of infiltrating the de-fense, but they could not score. 
Burleigh at-
tributed the in-ability to convert scoring chances to general ex-ecution and a lack of aware-ness around the net.
In situations where the oppos-
ing keeper gives up a rebound that is controlled by the Florida offense, Burleigh would like to see her players take the time to make a pass to the side for an easy tap-in, rather than shoot-ing as soon as they control the rebound.
After last weekend’s struggles, 
Burleigh said finishing will be a focus this week in practice.
“Ultimately, the psychologi-
cal part of finishing is something where you work on your mechan-ics to make it so you don’t have to think when you are facing an op-portunity,” she said.
Making the correct runs, play-
ing good services and setting teammates up were some of the areas Burleigh mentioned as points of emphasis as the team prepares to take on Arkansas on Thursday night. 
Senior midfielder Sarah Chap-
man said players need to put themselves in the right mindset to finish. 
Added Burleigh: “We need to 
be able to take care of teams no matter what the circumstances, no matter how many people they put behind the ball. Right now, we do that sometimes, but not all the time, and that’s not good enough for us to be where we want to be.”

Jaeckel has 188 kills in last 13 games
volleyball of her life. Filling a 
vital role as both a frontcourt at-tacker and a middle-back defend-er, Jaeckel has picked up 188 kills, 
98 digs and hit .327 during the 
current 13-game stretch. She was 
also honored as AVCA National Player of the Week on Oct. 4.
“She’s just on fire,“ junior 
middle blocker Betsy Smith said. 
“Everything she touches turns to 
gold.”
Part of a five-deep senior class, 
Jaeckel, who recorded her 1,000th career kill earlier this season, complements other frontcourt 
veterans like Kelly Murphy, Cas-
sandra Anderson and Stephanie 
Ferrell.
But according to Wise, Jaeckel 
has improved the most since ar -
riving at Florida.
“I’m not sure we’ve ever had 
a player who is this good at pay-ing attention to the details,” Wise 
said. 
Wise has repeatedly credited 
Jaeckel’s improvements over 
the years to work ethic. She said Jaeckel didn’t come in as the most gifted athlete, but her dedication 
to getting better has been conta-
gious for young players.
“She’s always looking out for 
me and telling me what I need to 
do,” freshman defensive special-
ist Madison Monserez said. “She’s 
really nurturing for everyone, but 
at the same time, she lets us know 
we need to get down to business and finish games.”
Monserez also credited Jaeck-
el with helping her adjust to the 
middle-back position and college life. 
In her five years at Florida, 
Jaeckel has seen the same ending to every season — a loss in the NCAA Regional Semifinals. Now 18 games into her final collegiate campaign, she is focused on not letting that happen again.
“I said I wanted to leave my 
senior year with no regrets, and at this point what we’ve accom-plished is pretty awesome and pretty special,” Jaeckel said. “We’ve left some things out here, but it’s nothing we can’t improve on before the end of the season.”VOLLEY , from page 14

Yeguete adds depth to Florida’s frontcourt
know how you’re going to help your team and you 
know you’re going to need this possession or need this rebound, so it’s just a mindset that you have to have.”
During Florida’s media day, Donovan made it clear 
he wasn’t expecting much offensively from Yeguete, who had the second-fewest field goals among the squad’s regulars last season. Instead, Donovan wants 
him to be opportunistic with his chances.  
Unlike the productivity Florida loses on the glass, 
the Gators return their top two scorers in guards Kenny 
Boynton and Erving Walker. Junior Mike Rosario and freshman Bradley Beal are 
also lauded for their shooting ability.
“That is enough scoring,” Dono-
van said. 
“We don’t need more scoring. 
What we need is those guys to also defend and rebound and do the little things. Casey and Will and Scottie 
and Cody, they can add depth and 
an element to our team that can be 
very, very helpful.”

They say life is not fair.
Saturday night in Jordan-
Hare Stadium was a prime 
example of why it isn’t; just look 
at Florida freshman quarterbacks 
Jacoby Brissett and Jeff Driskel.
Neither signal-caller was put in 
a fair position against Auburn on the road. 
Neither one stood a chance of 
succeeding, so forgive them for their mediocre performances.
“The more reps and the more 
turns those young men’ll get, they’re going to be really good 
football players,” coach Will Mus-champ said. “I’m excited about 
both of them. We just need to con-
tinue to move forward. … That’s the reality of it, but that’s part of 
the game.”
With redshirt senior John 
Brantley sidelined with an ankle injury the last two games, Florida’s 
coaches have handled the quarter -
back situation about as poorly as 
they could have.
Since Florida’s first loss, the line 
has been the same from the Gators’ coaches and players: Brissett and 
Driskel are splitting reps in prac-tice — not always evenly, but close 
enough.
Muschamp declined to name a 
starter all week, and it wasn’t un-til Friday, the day the team left for 
Auburn, that he announced Bris-sett would get the start.
By not making an executive 
decision earlier in the week, Mus-champ put Brissett and Driskel be-
hind the eight-ball, and the num-
bers showed it.
Brissett was 5-of-10 passing for 
45 yards and an interception in the first half before he was benched for Driskel.
“We just weren’t moving the ball effectively enough,” Mus-champ said. “We felt like we need-
ed a change.”
The Gators made a change, but 
the results were largely the same. Driskel completed half his passes 
(9 of 18) for just 75 yards and no touchdowns as the offense contin-
ued to sputter.
Both freshmen failed to get into 
a steady rhythm against the South-eastern Conference’s worst pass-
ing defense (222 yards per game). They both struggled to move the 
ball, and they clearly weren’t on 
the same page as their receivers.O n 
F l o r i d a ’ s 
s e c o n d 
play from scrimmage 
Brissett un-
derthrew D e o n t e 
Thompson 
on a deep ball that was intercepted 
by T’Sharvan Bell while Frankie 
Hammond streaked down the left 
sideline with no defender in sight.
Same with Driskel. He over -
threw tight end Jordan Reed on a flea-flicker that should have been an easy touchdown. He also slight-ly overthrew a fourth-down pass 
late in the game to Thompson, who 
had to leap for the ball as it went through his outstretched hands.
The errant passes against Au-
burn were easy throws if the quar -
terbacks were given a chance to 
develop a rapport with the receiv-
ers.
But neither Brissett nor Driskel 
has been given that chance.
Backups rarely take reps with 
the first team, and when the two 
were elevated on the depth chart 
due to Brantley’s injury, they were sharing reps. 
That makes it just as difficult to 
build a connection with receivers, learn their tendencies, learn how they break on routes and learn 
how long it takes them to get from 
point A to point B.
“Playing a true freshman quar -
terback in this league is difficult,” Muschamp said.
He’s right; it is difficult, espe-
cially when that quarterback isn’t given a fair shake with a full week of first-team reps.

his debut in our poll after being a staple in the 
Heisman race 
last season. Moore was the 
model of efﬁ  ciency in Boise State’s 63-13 win Saturday. He went 26 of 30 for 338 yards and four scores as the Broncos improved to 6-0 on the year and debuted at No. 5 in the BCS rankings. Welcome to the debate, Kellen.

because his Bears fell, 55-28, to Texas A&M and he threw hissecond interception of the sea-son. Still, he completed 28 of 40 passes for a school-record430 yards and three touch-
downs. Baylor might be fading, but RG3’s 
numbers are going to keep him in this race.Richardson climbed up our poll after 
another career day, this time againstOle Miss. He carried the ball 17 times for 183 yards and four touchdowns, including a remarkable 76-yard score that made the rounds on the highlight shows, as No. 2 Alabama cruised to a 52-7 win in Oxford, Miss.Luck continued to show why he is 
considered the No. 1 prospect in college football with another stellar performance during the weekend. Although his ﬁ  rst pass of the game was intercepted, Luck 
completed 23 of 36 passes for 336 
yards and four touchdowns. All four 
scores came in the second half, as Stanford beat Washington State 44-14.
