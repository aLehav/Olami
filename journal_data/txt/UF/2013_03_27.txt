UF students who suffer from Popsicle 
toes may have to ditch their ﬂ  ip-ﬂ  ops this 
week, as the temperature drops to near record-breaking lows.
The unusual weather is caused by 
northwest winds circulating around the large area of low pressure, which is now moving off the Mid-Atlantic coast, said UF Chief Meteorologist Jeff Huffman.
“Normally air masses in general ﬂ  ow 
from west to east,” he said. “It’s kind of like sticking a big boulder in the river, the air is forced to go around it and the air goes north to south.”
This change in direction is bringing 
abnormally cold winds from Canada, he said.
The low prediction is 35 degrees 
Thursday night, which nears that day’s record of 34 degrees, set in 1955, accord-ing to www.accuweather.com.
Meteorologists suspect Thursday 
might be the record-breaking night be-cause the record on that night is slightly higher.
Normal high temperatures for this 
time period range from 75 to 80 degrees. Overnight lows this week are reaching into the 30s, which is at near-frost condi-tions.
Despite the cold weather, meteorolo-
gists predict the weather to warm back to up mid-80s next week, Huffman said.
Untill then, students like  Micheal 
Tarr, a 19-year-old UF international stud-ies junior, are not enjoying this odd cold snap.
“It’s too cold for spring,” he said. Record-breaking lows leave students shivering

Twenty-ﬁ  ve students will be inducted 
into the UF Hall of Fame, the highest recog-
nition given to students since 1921.
President Bernie Machen and Vice Presi-
dent for Student Affairs Dave Kratzer will honor the recipients April 15. Recipients will also get a portrait on the third ﬂ  oor of the Reitz Union.
Hannah Swerdloff, a 22-year-old pub-
lic relations senior, was at work Thursday when she got the email with a “Congratula-tions.” Swerdloff, who served as the home-coming general chairwoman, said being involved at UF was rewarding enough. The Hall of Fame was just the cherry on top, she said.
“It’s an amazing honor, and I’m so hap-py,” Swerdloff said.
Having admired the Hall of Fame por-
traits for the past three years, Swerdloff said she is excited to one day bring her children to UF to show them her portrait on the wall.  
Another recipient, Henna Ibrahim, 
agreed with Swerdloff that being involved UF to induct 25 students into Hall of Fame

Alaniz’s favor once she volun-
teers as a tribute for District 14 tonight.
Clad in Katniss Everdeen’s signature braid and wardrobe, Alaniz will attend Reitz Union Board Entertainment’s “The Hunger Games”-themed event as part of its weeklong ode to the popular ﬁ  lm and book series.
“I’m really excited to see if 
anyone else actually dresses up, because I know it’s pretty hard to ﬁ  nd very real-looking Hunger Games outﬁ  ts,” the 18-year-old UF telecommunication fresh-man said. “It’s not like ‘Harry Potter’ where you can just wear a cloak.”

The color red bled all over Fa-
cebook’s blue and white homepage 
Tuesday.
The Human Rights Campaign, an 
organization that works to achieve equality for lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender Americans, asked social media users to show their sup-port for marriage equality by making their profile photos a red HRC logo. On Tuesday, the Supreme Court of the United States began hearing oral arguments for two cases regarding same-sex marriage.
The logo, which is normally blue 
with a yellow equal sign, was modi-
fied into a red ver-sion. HRC posted 
a Facebook status Monday after-noon urging fol-lowers to change their profile pho-tos to the modi-fied logo. As of Tuesday after-
noon, the original image had been shared more than 100,000 times, ac-cording to the organization’s web-site.
“The Internet is awash in a sea of red — the color of love,” said HRC Director of Marketing Anastasia Khoo in a press release.
Annie Horneland, a marketing 
director for UF’s Pride Awareness Month, changed her profile photo.
“It shows a visible presence that 
people care about this cause,” said the 21-year-old microbiology junior. “My Facebook page is red.”
Horneland, who identifies as a 
lesbian, said she is happy to see both gay and straight people supporting the LGBT community.

A new study found that 
chewing gum doesn’t help 
weight loss.
Once people spit out their 
gum, they eat just as much as those who don’t chew, and gum-chewers usually turn to unhealthier food options after, according to the study.
Yvonne Beeler, program di-
rector for the local Jenny Craig Weight Loss Center, said there are no dietary benefits to chew-ing gum.
“Chewing gum alone is not 
going to help you lose weight,” she said. “It is just a strat-egy while you’re doing other things to lose weight, to make sure you don’t sit there and eat something else you shouldn’t really be eating.”
People who are trying to 
lose weight should focus more on being active and making better choices with food and portions, Beeler said.
“Whenever you know 
you’re not really hungry, but you have the urge to eat, then that is when you would chew gum,” she said.
In fact, according to the 
study, chewing gum may lead to nutritional deficiencies because menthol from gum makes healthier foods taste bit-ter.
In the study, people were 
instructed to chew minty gum before snacks and meals for a week. Food diaries revealed gum-chewers ate fewer but larger meals that were less nu-tritious than meals nongum -chewers ate.
Bianca Aldana has heard 
myths of chewing gum as a di-eting trick. 
“It probably wouldn’t have 
that much of an affect as op-posed to working out and ac-tually eating healthier,” the 21-year-old UF psychology junior said.Study finds

Student Government Budget and Appropriations Committee Chairman Joseph Michaels presents the 
2013-2014 academic and student organization budgets to the Student Senate on Tuesday night.
◗IT SAW A 6.5 PERCENT 
INCREASE IN CLUB FUNDING.
COLLEEN WRIGHT
Alligator Writer
The Student Senate approved the 
Budget and Appropriations Com-
mittee’s $1.5 million academic and student organization budgets Tues-day night.
Committee chairman Joseph Mi-
chaels broke down the 2013-2014 fiscal year budgets for 21 academic organizations and 48 student orga-nizations.
According to the budget, $498,888 
out of a requested $533,480 was al-located to Student Government-funded academic organizations and $999,425 out of a requested $986,950 was granted to SG-funded student organizations.
Out of $34,592 in leftover funds 
from academic organizations’ bud-gets, $12,890 were given to student organizations. The rest of the money will be added to the amended 2013-2014 Activity and Service Fee bud-get.
The organizations can pull from 
the money starting July 1.
“We want to keep funding them 
in a fiscally responsible way,” Mi-chaels said after the meeting.
This year, the budget saw a 6.5 
percent increase in organization funding, which was determined by former committee chairwoman Christina Bonarrigo last summer. Michaels will work with SG this summer to determine the 2014-2015 increase for a $19 million budget.
The increase comes from a bump 
in students’ activities fees. 
He said he was most proud of 
the Senate’s budget code revisions, which allowed organizations to increase their funds spent on food from 8 percent to 15 percent.
Michaels said for the first time 
since he has been on the committee, all decisions made by the committee were unanimous.
“As chair, I made it a point to 
be unbiased and make sure the stu-dents were benefiting,” he said.

Leanne Lawrence's compassion 
has been the driving force behind 
her work helping inmates at the Alachua County Jail earn their GED certificates since 2000.
This month, she published 
her first book, “Between Hell and Hope: Teaching Humanity in an Imperfect World,” which chroni-cles her students’ experiences.
“It started out writing the sto-
ries just to cleanse myself because sometimes you hear really awful stuff,” she said. “Some of it is really funny and wonderful. I just wrote them sort of to take a shower.”
Lawrence said the hardest story 
to write was about a 5-year-old boy whose father raped him every morning before school. She also shared a story about a dad who started his daughter on cocaine for her 15th birthday.
“These stories are awful and ugly, but I know for a fact that we are all one bad choice away from being right where these people are,” Lawrence said. “An extra glass of wine at dinner, an extra margarita with your chips and salsa before getting behind the wheel.”
Lawrence knows some readers 
could find some stories in her book offensive. However, she believes being politically correct and keep-ing silent on issues in society cre-ates a bigger cultural divide.
“You can’t know a person un-
til you walk a mile in their shoes,” she said. “You can’t possibly know what makes that person pick up the crack pipe for the first time or what makes a girl let men do hor-rible things to her.”
To maintain control over the 
content in the book, Lawrence founded a publication company, De Profundis Productions, in 2012.
“All she’s worried about is get-
ting the book out there, circulating and spreading the book’s mes-sage,” said Suzanne Richardson, publicist for De Profundis Produc-tions.
Lawrence has turned to Face-
book and Twitter to market the book.
The response has been posi-
tive, Richardson said, adding that Lawrence already emptied her first round of inventory.
Lawrence said listening to peo-
ple’s stories is one way to spread kindness. Her book gives her stu-dents a voice and helps them to be seen as human beings.
“I don’t judge them, and I think 
they’re all beautiful and brilliant and capable until they prove me wrong,” she said. “I’ve walked in my own darkness. But I give ev-eryone the benefit of the doubt.”

One UF student and People 
for the Ethical Treatment of 
Animals are joining forces for an all-vegan dining hall on campus.
Far Binder will meet with 
Gator Dining executives next week after PETA’s college orga-nization, Peta2, collected more than 600 signatures last week from students demanding a vegan dining hall.
Binder, 22, has been a vegan 
for four years. The UF English and philosophy senior founded the Student Animal Alliance four years ago, which pushed for clear vegan food labels, vegan mini-markets on campus and meatless Mondays.
Ryan Huling, Peta2 man-ager for college campaigns, ar-rived on campus Thursday to collect signatures for a vegan dining hall on campus.
“It’s a tremendously posi-
tive response for just a couple of days on campus,” he said.
UF ranked No. 5 in the Top 
10 for Most Vegan-Friendly Large American Colleges by PETA last fall.
Marketing Program Man-
ager for Gator Dining Services Jill Rodriguez wrote in an email there are no plans for an all-vegan dining hall on campus.
But Huling wants to keep 
trying.
“We think the time is right 
for UF to keep up with student demands and take the vegan dining hall plunge,” he said.

Included are SBP Tj Villamil and football player Jesse Schmitt
on campus was a reward in itself.
The 21-year-old food science and human nutrition senior 
said everything she has done at UF was already fulfilling, but 
being recognized for it was overwhelming.
“I’m kind of nervous because the people that are up there 
are people I’ve looked up to my entire college career,” Ibra-him said.
Coordinated by UF’s Division of Student Affairs, applica-
tions to be admitted in the Hall of Fame became available in February. A committee of faculty, staff and two former award recipients narrowed the 123 applicants to 25 students, accord-ing to a news release.Jeanna Mastrodicasa, assistant vice president for the de-
partment of student affairs, said the Hall of Fame is a long-standing award that carries a lot of prestige.
“I think that you can really see how UF has evolved over 
time through the Hall of Fame photos, and this year will be no different,” she said.
Jesse Schmitt, a running back on the football team, said he 
was ecstatic to be chosen to be in the Hall of Fame.
“I’m incredibly honored. There’s a lot of really big names 
in that hallway that I get to join,” said the 21-year-old eco-nomics and political science senior. “I’m just looking forward to meeting the rest of my fellow inductees, and hopefully I can live up to the standards set by those before me.”

At UF Tuesday, people spoke out against 
a humanitarian act that was mistaken as an 
act supporting terrorism.
Students for a Democratic Society and 
Students for Justice in Palestine hosted three nationally known activists to speak about U.S. government political repression against Arab-Americans, Muslims and an-ti-war activists.
Noor Elashi, who spoke at the event, 
wrote a book about her father’s involve-ment in the Holy Land Foundation charity. Her father, Ghassan Elashi, was sentenced to 65 years in prison for providing food, medical care, shelter and education to Pal-estinian and American people in need.
“The jail my father is at offers only a 
fraction of the visitation and call time com-pared to other jails,” Noor said.
The next speaker was John Cline, the 
attorney who defended Ghassan Elashi in trial.
“There are cases where the justice sys-
tem has failed,” he said. “The Holy Land case is one of those.”
Cline said the government accused the 
Holy Land Foundation of giving resources to the Hamas terrorist group. He said the government had no evidence to back up its claim, and its main defense was an anony-mous source.
The last speaker was Mick Kelly, a man 
whose house was ransacked by the FBI be-cause he was believed to have participated in terrorist acts.
“I have always been happy to speak up 
for the liberation of Palestine. It’s all about what people say and what people get orga-nized to do,” Kelly said. “I’d rather sit in jail for 100 years than keep quiet.”WEDNESDAY, MARCH 27, 2013 � ALLIGATOR, 5

after she attacked a day care employee and threatened 
staff members with a fire extinguisher.  
Gainesville Police arrested Sharetta Renae Robinson, 
34, of 741 NW Eighth St., on charges of aggravated assault, battery and child abuse, among other charges, according to a GPD arrest report.
At about 11 a.m. Monday, Robinson walked into the 
La Petite Academy, in the 2700 block of Southwest Archer Road, to see her 1-year-old son, according to the report. Two employees recognized her and told her to leave be-cause she’s not allowed under court order to see her son.
Earlier this year, Robinson received a court notice that 
said if she didn’t attend a hearing March 5, she would lose her parental rights, said GPD spokesman Officer Ben To-bias. When Robinson failed to show up, a magistrate pro-hibited her from seeing her son.
At the day care, Robinson pushed past employees, 
grabbed her son from the toddler room and tried to leave, according to the report. Two employees held Robinson’s arm while a third tried to separate her from her son.
Robinson punched and kicked an employee, then 
grabbed a fire extinguisher and tried to hit the three em-ployees with it, according to the report. She then sprayed the extinguisher at the group, and some of the chemicals landed in her son’s eyes. The employees took the toddler from Robinson and locked themselves in the day care of-fice, where one of them called police.
During questioning, Robinson told officers she wanted 
to say goodbye to her son because she was leaving for the U.S. Navy, according to the report. Robinson was booked into the Alachua County Jail. On Tuesday night, she re-mained in custody with a $14,000 bond.

To give Alachua County resi-
dents a local resource to receive 
overdue paychecks, the Alachua County Commission is formulating the Wage Recovery Ordinance.
The commission discussed a 
draft of the document at a meeting Tuesday evening.
The proposed ordinance will en-able employees who believe they’ve been a victim of wage theft to file a complaint with the county.
If mediation fails, the case will 
be referred to a hearing officer, who will review the evidence and make a decision whether a violation oc-curred.  
The case could end up in court if 
the employer fails to pay.  
The conversation Tuesday cen-
tered on how to make sure the or-dinance is strong enough to be ef-fective.
Commissioner Charles “Chuck” 
Chestnut said the ordinance should 
work because the county will be-come responsible for billing an em-ployer found in the wrong.
“I think that’s 
how you put the 
teeth in,” he said. “When the coun-ty collects its fees.”
Commissioner Lee Pinkoson disagreed, saying the ordinance is still not strong enough because a hearing officer doesn’t have enough leverage.
He said the only way to reim-
burse employees for wages is by taking employers to court.
“If the people ultimately want to 
get paid, it sounds like where we’ll have to go is the court system,” he said. “It doesn’t sound like the hearing officer has the teeth we’re looking for.”
County Attorney Dave Wagner 
said the two local attorneys who are paid to work for the county would probably serve as the hearing offi-cers initially.
At the end of the meeting, com-
missioners voted 3-1, with Com-missioner Susan Baird absent, to continue modifying a draft of the ordinance. They requested the county manager bring back a pro-posal for a public education and outreach campaign targeting em-ployers.
The commission will host a pub-
lic hearing at 5:30 p.m. April 16 to discuss the updated ordinance.

First Comes Love: 
Marriage equality is 
not this difﬁ  cult
Tuesday marked the ﬁ  rst of two days of arguments about 
marriage equality heard by the Supreme Court of the Unit-ed States.
Quite frankly, it’s hysterical this is a debate still being dis-
cussed in our court system. Like, are you kidding? Based on this country’s history, you’d think men would be able to marry each other and the women would be perpetual maids and wenches to the obviously more superior man-folk.
But no.If all men are created equal, then that is the last time we need 
to interpret the Constitution about the matter.
“The court’s four liberal justices asked questions suggesting 
sympathy for the gay-marriage cause, but across the ideological spectrum, justices showed reluctance to issue a ruling establish-ing an immediate constitutional right to gay marriage across the 50 states,” according to The Wall Street Journal after the SCO-TUS’ day of initial discussions.
Like, um, sorry if you are a backward thinker, but it’s time to 
let bygones be bygones and let people get married if they want to. If you’re going to cling to a religious text and argue that “mar-riage” was created to be between a man and a woman, then we will point to all the other passages in that religious text you have most likely broken just by walking into a Red Lobster.
What else was frustrating about the debates this week?Facebook reverted to the #Kony2012 fad all over again.People changed their proﬁ  le pictures to a red and pink equal-
ity symbol, which is a new version of the Human Rights Cam-paign’s logo. Other equality campaigns created their own ver-sions of a red equality symbol as well.
Did all of you who changed your Facebook proﬁ  le pictures 
actually, perhaps, sign any sort of petition or send a piece of mail to the SCOTUS? Because otherwise, thank you for brieﬂ  y spreading awareness, but you did it on the day discussions be-gan instead of, oh, we don’t know, anytime before it.
Do you think the Supreme Court justices are going to check 
their Facebook news feeds and suddenly change their minds?
No.They will have a nice meal with their families — we’re as-
suming — and then argue some more tomorrow.
Share the good word, spread awareness and thank you for 
doing so — but doing so on the day of a discussion is too late to change the decision makers’ minds. It is simply a fruitless sign of solidarity.
Ideally, this editorial would just be an exact re-publication of 
The Onion’s article, “Supreme Court On Gay Marriage: ‘Sure, Who Cares.’”
“‘I’m a strict Originalist, Mr. Cooper, and I’m looking at a 
14th Amendment that forbids any state from denying any per-son equal protection of the law,’ Associate Justice Antonin Scalia said. ‘So, unless we are the most uncivilized society on the face of God’s green earth, I think we can all agree that a gay person is in fact a person. So what I’m saying is, who the f--k are we to tell a person who he or she can get married to? This is dumb. Can we talk about a real case now, please?’” Decline of religion might not be bad
In his column last Wednesday, my colleague Erik Skipper 
articulated the classic assertion that a growing absence of God and religion in public life has led to the disintegra-
tion of American society. 
Instead of religion, Skipper contended, people have con-
formed to worshipping various -isms: multiculturalism, en-vironmentalism and statism, for instance.
Skipper’s assessment of the state of American society is 
not completely wrong.
Indeed, there are serious philosophical concerns: the in-
ability to make sound judgments about right and wrong due to growing relativism; the sacriﬁ  ce of free speech to political correctness; the fear that people should avoid certain scien-tiﬁ  c or academic exploits to avoid offending someone; and the belief that the state is the ultimate answer to many of America’s woes.
But Skipper’s diagnosis for the root of these problems — 
a growing absence of God in public life — is based on scant evidence and essentially little to no correlation with reality.
First, I can attest to the existence of many nonreligious 
people, like myself, who do not ascribe to these -isms. In-deed, there are many people who do not believe in a high-er power but who also believe in right and wrong, ethical principles and individual rights. There are also many secular people who do not ascribe to the idea that we should sacriﬁ  ce thoughtful debate in the name of multiculturalism and who believe the government is not the answer to our problems.
Second, there is no evidence that America is facing a se-
rious decline in religious belief. A survey conducted by the Pew Research Center in 2007 found that 92 percent of Ameri-cans believe in God or a higher power. While maybe not all of these individuals are devoutly religious, a greater presence of God in the public square will probably not make everyone embrace morality out of the blue.
In fact, there is no evidence that a higher rate of religious 
belief leads to a more moral population.  
According to a 2009 study by Phil Zuckerman in the jour-nal Sociology Compass, which examines religious belief around the world, atheists and secu-lar people “are markedly less nationalistic, less prejudiced, less anti-Semitic, less racist, less dogmatic, less ethnocentric, less close-minded, and less authori-tarian.”
Zuckerman’s research also ﬁ  nds that, while secular peo-
ple might be more likely to drink alcohol underage or use illegal drugs, “there is simply no evidence suggesting that atheist and secular people are more likely to commit [vio-lent] crimes than religious people.” He points to the fact that only 0.2 percent of American prisoners are atheists, which is much lower than the proportion of atheists in the general population.
Furthermore, a 2005 study by Gregory S. Paul in the Jour-
nal of Religion & Society found that in modern democratic societies, “higher rates of belief in and worship of a creator correlate with higher rates of homicide, juvenile and early adult mortality, STD infection rates, teen pregnancy, and abortion.” On the other hand, the study found that “the more secular, pro-evolution democracies have, for the ﬁ  rst time in history, come closest to achieving practical ‘cultures of life’ that feature low rates of lethal crime, juvenile-adult mortal-ity, sex related dysfunction, and even abortion.” 
I do not bring up this research to suggest that religious 
people are immoral. Yet, I do not think the evidence supports Skipper’s assertion that a lack of religious belief leads to in-creased immoral behavior.
People should discuss these greater societal problems but 
not associate a lack of belief in a higher power with immoral-ity and civil decline.

UF students who want a place to nap on campus 
might get it.
They only need to follow the lead of a 19-year-
old Harvard University student who recently peti-
tioned for napping facilities on campus, according to a news release from MetroNaps, a company that develops solutions for workplace fatigue.
Missy Clapp, outreach and instruction librarian 
for Library West, said the library doesn’t have nap-ping facilities because its priority is study space. She said she doesn’t see a need for napping facili-ties because many students live close to campus.
However, Clapp said, the library is open to 
student suggestions and works closely with UF Student Government to implement new ideas like this.
“Everything we have and everything we do is 
for the students,” she said. “If napping becomes a priority for students, why not have a place for that?”
When Library West reopened in 2006 after reno-
vations, it had beanbags on the third floor. Clapp said they were too difficult to keep clean and were removed.
Other schools like Saint Leo University and Car-
negie Mellon University offer their students places to nap. Both universities have installed MetroNaps’ EnergyPods, chairs designed for napping.
The pod offers a 20-minute nap experience, said 
Kenneth Posner, associate vice president for student services at Saint Leo. It tilts back, shines LED lights and plays soothing music. After 20 minutes, it gen-tly awakens the user with louder music, vibrations and by tilting back into its upright position.
Posner said students use the four free pods in 
the newest residence hall on campus all the time.
Erika Linke, associate dean of libraries at Carn-
egie Mellon, said students can find a place to nap in the $9,000 pods inside the campus cafe.
“The need to nap has always been there,” she 
said. “Now we’re providing a more sophisticated way to do it.”Colleges across

Each Thursday, Aikido of Gainesville 
offers free self-defense classes to the pub-
lic.
For Tom Huffman and Ashley Cor-
tez, the classes are an act of community service, but they’re taking it one step fur-ther.
The center, in partnership with the 
Alachua County Victim Services and Rape Crisis Center, will offer a free self-defense class April 4 in honor of Sexual Assault Awareness Month.
The class will be from 7:15 p.m. to 9 
p.m at the Unified Training Center, 809 W. University Ave., and will teach Aikido to interested residents and students.
Cortez, a victim advocate at the county 
crisis center, organized the partnership.
“[It’s] what we’d like to see as far as 
self-defense and respect — nonaggres-sive techniques and equipping you with basic knowledge,” she said.
Aikido differs from karate or tae-
kwondo as a form of martial arts in its attempt to simultaneously defend oneself from attack and prevent the attacker from being injured unnecessarily.
Huffman, sensei and founder of Ai-
kido of Gainesville, said people can nor-mally cause as much pain as they want, but in his classes, he gives his students the tools to avoid it.
“That is what Aikido is in a word: op-
tions,” he said.
Cortez said although it’s impossible to 
prevent all rapes, she believes that teach-ing self-defense will help contribute to reducing the risk.
“I’m hoping that this gets people to go 
to the [Unified Training Center] to contin-ue on, to keep themselves educated about 
self-defense,” she said.Local Aikido center offers free classes

Editor’s Note: All interviews with immigrants 
were conducted in Spanish. To protect them, last names have been omitted.
When Fernando left his home in Mexico 
five years ago, he was searching for an 
American adventure.
The 24-year-old looks back and laughs. His 
adventure included getting caught by border patrol and being mugged along the way.
He finally made it to the other side, but 
that’s where the biggest problem awaited him: He couldn’t talk to anyone. The charmer with the Mario Lopez smile was, effectively, mute.
Fast forward five years.Fernando has an English teacher. Once 
a week, she teaches him how to conjugate verbs and pronounce words like “flirt.” They go over worksheets, talk about expressions and laugh when they don’t understand each other.  And it’s all free.
Fernando is one of the immigrants who 
benefits from Project Progress, a group of about 15 UF students who spend their Tuesday nights teaching English. The students-turned-teachers are members of CHISPAS, a student organization at UF. A few formed Project Progress because they thought the ability to speak English would spark a change.
Every Tuesday night, they drive out to 
La Iglesia Adventista del Séptimo Día de Gainesville. They break the about 30 students into pairs or instruct them one-on-one. From 7 p.m. to 9 p.m., they speak English.
For this church, that is unusual. Spanish 
is the mother tongue. Most members prefer to answer questions in Spanish because they can express themselves better.
But Tuesdays are a break from most 
norms.
So Gisselle Martinez doesn’t worry about 
the small things. Martinez, Project Progress’ educational director, knows the immigrants don’t necessarily need a perfect program with certified teachers. There’s more to it than that.
“I want people who care,” said the 23-year-old Colombian.
      
Officially, Lily Rosales is director of health 
and temperance at the church, but everyone sees the 54-year-old as a mother figure.
It’s an unspoken rule: Skip English class, 
and you will have to deal with Rosales.
“They prefer to come to class,” she said, 
grinning.
Before Rosales had her way, Project 
Progress only offered classes at UF’s Levin College of Law. Rosales asked Martinez to add another day of classes and move them. Her boys wouldn’t go to campus, but they would come to church, Rosales reasoned.
“They’re landscapers, painters and 
construction workers,” she explained. “To them, the university is untouchable.”
That first week, about 30 students 
carpooled and walked to get to class.
Fernando’s teacher was Andrene Cross, 
a UF junior who was as quiet as he was charming. She was 18. He was 24. Her skin was chocolate. His was brown.
But they weren’t so different. Cross 
brought hymns one time, and they translated the lyrics. Faith, they’ve found, is something through which they connect.
“We feel more comfortable with each other 
now,” Cross said.
All of the Project Progress students go to 
the church as well. They read Bible passages, attend Wednesday prayer meetings in dress shirts and still-wet hair, and eat Rosales’ gallo pinto after the Saturday service.
There are a few older students, but the 
majority are boys in their mid-20s who quickly became men in their transitions to America.
Fernando’s English has gone from 
nonexistent to conversational in the past two and a half years, but he isn’t satisfied. He still has a hard time understanding some co-workers, and vice versa.
Ironically, he takes Tuesday nights off 
of work in hopes of finding better work. Fernando remembers a foreman from a previous job. Like Fernando, the foreman didn’t have papers.
But he spoke “good English.” Fernando raised an eyebrow.“He can make $25 an hour,” he said.
      
Project Progress students are reminded 
about the communication barrier between them and other Americans daily.
Celestina’s reminder comes hourly. From 
the lady at the checkout line to the dentist, Celestina hasn’t known what was being said to her for the past 10 years.
Her children have started to learn English 
in school. Her 7-year-old daughter, Cynthia, fills in the blanks now. But Celestina is 37, and she doesn’t want to be dependent on Cynthia.
So Tuesdays, Celestina attends English 
class. She’s one of the few women who go.
One day, she said, she’ll talk with one of 
her kids’ teachers. For now, she has a hard time even speaking English out loud.
“I don’t know why,” she said of her fear.Many Project Progress teachers can relate 
to their students’ frustrations because they’ve had to learn English themselves.  
Ilse Paniagua left Mexico City when she 
was 13. The 20-year-old teaches Pablo, a 21-year-old who recently found the courage to speak to her in English.
“The best technique is just time,” she said.For 25-year-old Gamaliel, time has a funny 
sense of humor. He moved to Gainesville when he was 19. His plan was to work for one year, save money to pay for school and return to Mexico.
But six years later, he’s found himself 
in a different classroom than what he had planned.
“I can’t explain it,” he said, smiling softly. 
“I just stayed.”
His weeks are dominated by 45 hours of 
work on top of the time he spends in church.
But there are two hours that he, along with 
Celestina and Fernando, will continue to set aside for Project Progress.
“What they do is give classes,” he said, 
“and it’s beautiful.”WEDNESDAY, MARCH 27, 2013 � ALLIGATOR, 9

UF students can now add a little spice to 
their gym schedules.
On March 18, Gainesville-based fitness 
company peerFit started selling the peerFit 
Passport.
Rex Tullius, co-founder and vice president 
of outreach at peerFit, said the passport allows people to take two classes at each of six local gyms. It costs $25, and the gyms include the Ark School of Fitness, Alter Ego Fitness Down-town, Gainesville Health and Fitness (Tioga Center), Gator CrossFit, Body By Boris and Bailey’s Powerhouse Gym. He said a promo-tion like this has never been done before.
The 2-year-old company is a website where 
people can view schedules for local gyms and post reviews of their favorite classes.
Tullius, a 26-year-old UF building construc-
tion graduate student, said the value of the passport is $150. Each person can get one pass-port redemption per edition. The first edition ends May 31.
Kathryn Cook said she may be more in-clined to buy the passport if she didn’t live on campus.
The 21-year-old UF psychology junior goes 
to campus gyms about three times a week.
She has taken Zumba, Cycle, Upper Body 
Blast, Lower Body Blast and yoga classes on campus.
However, Cook said she stopped attending 
so many classes after an accident in a Lower Body Blast class where a girl’s knee cap came out.
“That’s when I started to notice they push 
people too much in those classes,” she said.
Cook said if she were more dedicated to 
fitness, she would probably buy a passport to check out different gyms.
Andi Stevens expressed similar concerns.The 19-year-old pharmacy freshman said 
she thinks it is a good idea, but she doesn’t have transportation. She also said people may just continue going to UF gyms because they are free for students.
Tullius said he is not sure how many stu-
dents have the passport yet, but if they are in-terested in purchasing a peerFit passport, they can visit www.peerfit.com/blog/passport.10, ALLIGATOR � WEDNESDAY, MARCH 27, 2013

Thirty seconds. That’s all it 
takes for interviewers to know 
whether they will hire some-one.
At least, that’s what Newell 
Fox said. He is the owner of i3 Interviewing, a 1-year-old ser-vice that gives interview advice via live lectures. The next lec-ture, which costs $299, will be April 13 at Santa Fe College.
Fox, who has 11 years of ex-
perience conducting interviews, said he started giving tips when he was asked to speak at UF’s College of Health and Human Performance.
He said he saw a need for 
a program that gives educated students proper information about interviewing.
“The interviewing tips are 
like a secret sauce,” he said. “Not many people know the recipe, but those who seek it will find it.”
Fox said students have tak-
en four years out of their life to obtain a college degree, so they might as well take an extra step by learning the right things to say in an interview.
“The interview is what sep-
arates educated students from landing their dream job,” he said. “Our goal is to give them the tools to do so.”
Chris Martinez, a 26-year-
old UF business senior, said he got a job as a sales manager at a Dick’s Sporting Goods after his experience with i3 Interview-ing.
“I learned that if you are 
more proactive in your job search, you are able to take con-trol of your own fate,” he said.
Emily Parker, a 21-year-old 
recreation, parks and tourism senior and an intern at i3 Inter-viewing, said working for the company has given her great insight into what makes a good resume.

how unbelievably horrible my resume was,” she said.Interviewing company

Studies suggest more young adults turn to Inter-
net TV instead of cable, broadcast or satellite TV — 
a trend Nielsen called “Zero-TV” in a recent study. The study reported the U.S. had more than 5 million “Zero-TV” households in 2013.
John Peters, a Best Buy sales consultant in 
Gainesville, said many of his customers are opting out of satellite or cable for Internet TV.
Peters said more people are buying streaming box-
es, such as the Apple TV and the Roku box, along with their TV purchases. The boxes allow users to access thousands of shows and movies through premium services like Netflix and Hulu Plus.
“There’s no monthly fee, so people can save money and get more entertainment choices,” he said. “These devices were popular, but in the past year, they’re now more of a necessity of our customers.”
Kathy Keeter, a 21-year-old UF Spanish, political 
science and women’s studies senior, said she uses Hulu and Netflix on her computer to watch shows. After graduation, she plans to buy a streaming device instead of paying for cable.
“It seems people don’t like to channel surf any-
more,” she said. “They want to come home and watch a specific show on their own time.”
Alissa Tulacro, a 21-year-old UF advertising ju-
nior, agreed and said she enjoys streaming her shows instead of watching them on TV because of the con-venience.
“There’s definitely a benefit to having a stream box 
when you want to watch TV,” she said. Students stream TV shows, study finds

‘Tis the season for signed leases

few weeks until students move out of their apartments, local movers and apartment complexes prepare for the transition.
Wade Swikle and his moving

information systems and opera-

mentum against the 49ers as they 
continue attempting to redeem a dis-appointing season with a deep run in the WNIT. 
Charlotte ended Florida’s season 
two years ago with an 81-77 overtime victory on March 24, 2011 in the third round of the WNIT. 
Lewis watched helplessly from the 
bench after suffering a season-ending leg injury earlier in the 2010-11 cam-paign. 
She said the team has not forgot-
ten the feeling of watching the 49ers celebrate their come-from-behind vic-tory. 
“It’s important for all of us, not just 
the players that were there,” Lewis said.
But the disappointment resonated 
with Butler more than her players. She spent two seasons as coach of Char-lotte from 2005-07 and finished 40-22 with a pair of WNIT appearances.
After Carolyn Peck was fired dur-
ing a 9-22 season in 2006-07, Butler re-turned to coach UF, where she played four years from 1990-94. 
Four years later — in her first op-
portunity against Charlotte — she fell flat.  
“We want to win this one for her,” 
Jaterra Bonds said. “I can tell you that.”
Butler knows her second chance 
will be a challenge — one that, if con-quered, would go a long way toward continuing the momentum her young team has built thus far. 
“They’re very good,” Butler said 
of Charlotte, which finished second in the Atlantic 10 this season.
“They are a team, like us, that 
knows without a shadow of a doubt that they are good enough to be in the other tournament that is going on right now.”

guy,” Donovan said. “He reminds me a lot of (Missouri point guard) Phil Pressey. Not so much the way they are built so to speak, but the vision that he has. He is one of the best passers in the country. And when you’ve got a point guard that’s got that kind of vision and can make pinpoint passes like that, it takes their team to a different level.”
According to KenPom.com, Comer ranks 
second in the nation in assist rate — a stat that divides a player’s assists by the field goals made by his teammates while he is on the floor. 
FGCU plays at the 39th-fastest tempo (69.2 
possessions per game) in the NCAA. UF is 3-2 this season against squads with an adjusted tempo of at least 69. The Division I average is 65.9. 
“In transition, where they do get a lot of 
those lobs, you’ve got to do a really good job of getting back in transition and taking care of the basketball,” Donovan said.
“If they get out and they space it with their 
speed and quickness, they are really, really good on the break, putting the ball on the rim. They’ve got athletic frontcourt guys and wing players that can go up there and get it and fin-ish.”
Comer added: “That’s just our style of play. 
We want to push the ball down the court, and we want to attack, attack, attack.”FGCU guard’s 
assist rate ranks second nationally12, ALLIGATOR § WEDNESDAY, MARCH 27, 2013

Infielder Zack Powers walks back to the dugout after striking out during Florida’s 4-1 loss 
to Florida State on March 12 at McKethan Stadium.

Sophomore Kayla Lewis shoots during Florida’s 68-57 loss to Vanderbilt on Feb. 
21 in the O’Connell Center.
HoopS , from page 19Charlotte eliminated UF from ‘11 WNIT
Wnit , from page 19Seminoles scored first run on bases-loaded walk with two outs
ball,” O’Sullivan said.
FSU left fielder Marcus Davis ad-
vanced Delph to third with an infield 
single and UF starter Tucker Simpson hit DJ Stewart to load the bases.
After Simpson retired the next two 
batters, first baseman John Nogowski drew a nine-pitch walk with the bases still loaded.
Nogowski nearly swung at the 
fourth ball, but the first base umpire ruled that he checked his swing.
“Everybody makes mistakes,” 
O’Sullivan said. “It’s just we got one of those teams where they’re not getting covered up.”
Florida responded in the top of 
the second. Zack Powers hit a two-out double to right field, and Mitchell drove him in two batters later with a single to right-center field.
Unfortunately for the Gators, that 
would be the extent of their offensive production.
Seminoles starter Luke Weaver re-tired the next 11 batters he faced and did not allow another hit.  His nine strikeouts tied a career-high. In each of his five starts, Weaver has pitched at least six innings.
During FSU’s 4-1 win in Gainesville 
on March 12, Weaver threw 6.1 score-less innings. Weaver has given up just four runs in 33 innings for a 1.09 ERA this season.
“He threw strikes,” O’Sullivan 
said. “He threw secondary pitches for strikes. He did a very good job. “
O’Sullivan said the Gators’ pitching 
staff has little margin for error until the team starts making progress at the plate.
“It’s not like anybody plays a flaw-
less game, but every mistake we make has been leading to runs,” O’Sullivan said.
“A run here, a run there. Offensive-
ly, we’re not that type of team where we’re going to score 8-10 runs a game, so it’s been hurting us.”

Redshirt senior guard Jon Halapio (left) blocks Vanderbilt defensive tackle Jared Morse 
(97) during the Gators’ 31-17 win against the Commodores on Oct. 13 in Nashville, Tenn. Halapio has been limited in his return from offseason knee surgery this spring.
PHIL HEILMAN
Alligator Staff Writer
Florida’s spring game will have a differ-
ent look this year. 
With only six scholarship offensive line-
men currently healthy — including Quinteze 
Williams, who moved from defensive tackle — coach Will Muschamp said the Gators will participate in some situational work in addi-tion to scrimmaging on April 6. 
“What’s hard for the offensive line is just 
taking 60 straight snaps,” Muschamp said. “That’s kind of difficult for just five guys to take that. We’re incorporating within the scrimmage some 7-on-7 (and) some special teams periods, where we just concentrate and let those guys get a break.”
Sophomore tackle Trip Thurman became 
the latest member of the offensive line to get bitten by the injury bug. He suffered a shoul-der injury and received an MRI on Tuesday night, with the results and a timetable for his return expected by Wednesday. 
“Certainly disappointing,” Muschamp 
said. “Trip has had an outstanding spring. He’s made some progress.” 
Thurman joins a cast of offensive linemen 
who are out due to injury. Guard Jon Halapio (knee), tackle Chaz 
Green (ankle) and guard Ian Silberman (shoulder), will each miss spring practice en-tirely. Additionally, redshirt freshman Jessa-men Dunker remains suspended after being charged with grand theft auto and driving with a suspended license on Jan. 17. 
“Last spring, we’d go 120-130 snaps in a 
scrimmage,” Muschamp said. “You can’t do that with five offensive linemen. That won’t be good.”
UF projects to have 16 scholarship of-
fensive linemen next season, including five signees who will join the team in the fall. Florida lost tackle Xavier Nixon and guard James Wilson from a unit that surrendered the most sacks in the Southeastern Confer-ence last season.  
Transfer Max Garcia, who currently owns 
the Gators’ starting left guard spot, expects to see time in a unit looking to give quarterback Jeff Driskel better protection next season.  
“This spring is tough just with the num-
bers that we have,” Garcia said. “We’re the backbone of the team, so we’ve just got to keep pushing forward and just get the job done.”

On New Year’s Eve in 2007, UF freshman 
goalie Nora Neset Gjoen’s house on the island 
of Sotra in Norway caught on fire. She was trapped with her brother on the third floor. The smoke threatened to overwhelm them. 
“I went to the window, and when I opened 
it, the window on the floor below us burst and flames were setting out,” Gjoen said. “So I just figured my best chance was to jump.”
Gjoen, who was 15 at the time, was forced 
to abandon the burning house as her brother made his way down the stairwell. She jumped and landed on her feet, suffering a broken ver-tebra without nerve damage. 
“I should’ve taken a parachute,” she said.She was hospitalized for a week. Sev-
eral weeks before suffering the injury, Gjoen signed a three-year contract with Arna-Bjor-nar, a Norwegian football club from Arna, Bergen.
Even after Gjoen’s injury, the club still 
signed her.  
After a year of rehab, she began playing as 
a junior keeper for Arna-Bjornar. 
In December 2009, Gjoen joined LSK Kvin-
ner FK in Oslo as the club’s reserve keeper. Her biggest break, however, was coming soon. She made her debut in Norway’s top re-
garded club league — Toppserien League — for IL Sandviken on June 12, 2010. After two years, she moved back to Bergen as the first keeper for Sandviken, a club special to the Gjoen family. 
Gjoen said she moved around the three 
clubs in order to see as much game time as possible. But she always knew she wanted to play college soccer in the United States. Now, Gjoen, who started at goalie for Nor-
way in the 2012 FIFA U-20 Women’s World Cup, is eyeing a starting position at Florida. 
As one of Florida’s early enrollees, Gjoen 
will have an opportunity to show off her skill set to the coaching staff this spring. 
“I’m a pretty offensive goalie,” Gjoen said. 
“I like to see myself as the first defender of my team, and I’m a pretty decent shot-stopper.”
Gjoen brings valuable depth behind soph-
omore goalkeeper Taylor Burke. 
“When you play for your country and 
you’ve played in games with a lot on the line, that certainly makes coming into college a lot easier,” coach Becky Burleigh said.

To prepare for Sunday’s con-
test against Minnesota, Patric 
Young channeled his inner Will Muschamp.
The Florida football coach’s 
“nameless, faceless opponents” mantra was useful to the junior center. 
“A lot of people tried to make 
this game me against (Golden Go-phers forward Trevor) Mbakwe, two guys with similar games,” Young said. “I was like, ‘I don’t care about him. … I’m going to go out there and do my job to the best of my ability.’”
Young scored only five points 
but grabbed a team-high seven boards during No. 3 seed Flor-ida’s 78-64 win against No. 11 seed Minnesota. 
Mbakwe committed three 
turnovers and scored 11 points but made just 3 of his 7 attempts from the floor. Minnesota’s top big man struggled with foul trou-ble throughout the game. 
Young also succeeded as a 
paint enforcer in UF’s 79-47 vic-tory against 14th-seeded North-western State on Friday. He scored 16 points and pulled down a game-high nine rebounds as the Gators outscored the Demons 44-22 in the paint and won the re-bounding battle 43-26. 
Young’s 16 rebounds in UF’s first two rounds of the Big Dance are his most during a two-game stretch since early February. 
“Not so much a shot blocker, but he’s been an anchor back there that he can see actions and things starting to develop before they happen,” coach Billy Dono-van said.
Free throw improvement: After 
struggling with free-throw shoot-
ing throughout the season, the Gators enjoyed some success at the charity stripe on Sunday. 
Florida made 11 of its 15 free-
throw attempts in the final 6:45 against Minnesota. Overall, UF converted 26 of its 36 free-throw attempts. 
Young, who shot 48.8 percent 
from the foul line prior to Sun-day, went 5 of 6 in the Gators’ win against the Golden Gophers. Point guard Scottie Wilbekin went 7 of 10, while Will Yeguete —  a 58.6 percent free-throw shooter — made 5 of his 9 attempts. 
“It was really nice that me, 
Will — guys that normally aren’t the best free-throw shooters — were able to go and knock some down,” Young said.

Junior center Patric Young holds up a fan’s sign following Florida’s 66-40 win against Vanderbilt on March 6 in the O’Connell Center. Young has pulled down 16 rebounds in two NCAA Tournament games this season. Young leads UF with an average of 6.3 boards per game.

Rarely does a Florida program — no 
matter the sport — settle for less than a 
chance to compete for an NCAA cham-pionship. Coach Amanda Butler and the Gators are stuck in that situation this season, but through two games they have made the most of their op-portunity in the WNIT. 
Florida (20-14) skidded to a pain-
ful eighth-place tie in the Southeastern Conference by losing nine of its final 13 games. But the Gators have recovered in the postseason, piecing together two of their better performances to collect a pair of road victories, which were dif-ficult to come by during the regular season. 
After surviving a back-and-forth 
contest to beat Florida International 75-68 on Thursday, Florida dismantled Winthrop 85-53 on Monday night — one of UF’s best performances this sea-son.
“We are no longer the underdog 
team,” Kayla Lewis said. “We are the biggest school in this tournament, and we have to play as such.”
Butler has encouraged Lewis and 
the rest of her inexperienced squad to 
embrace being a high-profile team and adopt a road-warrior mentality. 
Florida is 
four wins away from earning its first postseason title in program history. But the Gators will be on the road for the remainder of their season, which con-tinues tonight against Charlotte (26-5) at 7 in the Halton Arena.
“It’s a special place,” Butler said. “A 
hard place to win. We’ve got to go up there and really be ready to play tough defense and do the things that make us a good team.” UF tipping off WNIT Sweet 16

JACKSONVILLE — Trying to cap off 
his most dominant performance this year, 
Danny Young made his biggest mistake of the season.
After giving up a leadoff double to FSU 
third baseman Jose Brizuela in the eighth inning on Tuesday night, Young balked, al-lowing Brizuela to advance to third. Brizu-ela scored the go-ahead run on an infield single three batters later.
“I kind of gave it away there,” Young 
said. “It kind of stings a little bit.”
Costly mistakes and a poor offensive 
showing resulted in Florida (11-15) losing to No. 4 Florida State 2-1 at the Baseball Grounds of Jacksonville. The defeat marked UF’s second against FSU this year.
“It’s unfortunate we weren’t able to mus-
ter any more offense, because I thought we pitched well enough to win,” coach Kevin O’Sullivan said.
Before Tuesday, FSU (23-2) ranked 11th 
nationally with 7.9 runs per game.
The two runs UF allowed on Tuesday 
were the fewest it has given up in a midweek game this year. Overall, Young was strong in relief for Florida, giving up just one run on two hits in four innings while striking out 
five.
Florida State went up 
1-0 in the bottom of the first inning as lead-off hitter Josh Delph doubled when Harri-son Bader and Connor Mitchell collided on a pop fly that then bounced into an empty center field. 
“The ball hung up there long enough 
to where I think we should’ve caught the Florida falls to Florida State 
for second time this season
