A member of the Para-Commandos skydiving team lands on Florida Field at Ben Hill Grifﬁ  n Stadium during Gator Growl on Friday night.

Alligator Contributing Writer
More than 26,000 students, alumni, veter-
ans and guests united Friday under the stars 
for the 89th Gator Growl.
A lot happened during the roughly three-
hour show. Comedian Tracy Morgan and country star Josh Turner performed, host and Olympian Dara Torres ﬂ  ashed her abs and the Para-Commandos skydiving team fell from 5,000 feet.
Other crowd pleasers included a dance 
medley by Sabor Latino and a parody of One Direction’s “What Makes You Beautiful” by the Sedoctaves. The UF Gator Marching Band even played “Gangnam Style.”
Kyle Giesel, a 21-year-old ﬁ  nance junior, 
said he thought Turner stole the show.
Audience members seemed to agree. They 
clapped, danced and put their arms around each other as they swayed to the music, belt-ing out the lyrics with their heads thrown back and eyes closed.
But others thought Morgan choked — lit-
erally. He ended his act abruptly because he was coughing so hard.
Dennis Driscoll, a 1965 UF alumnus and 
Gators season ticket holder of 45 years, said he had been to more than 30 Gator Growls. Although the 69-year-old said he thought bet-ter sound and lighting would have enhanced this year’s production, he said it was one of the best he’s been to in the past few years.
Driscoll attributed that partly to Turner’s 
performance.
“It’s real music,” he said. “All his songs 
have what they call a hook — it takes you in.”Gators show their true colors at Gator Growl 
� SHE WAS AWARDED A          
MEMORIAL CLARINET.

Twelve-year-old Qing Lu will re-
member this Veterans Day as more than 
just a tribute to citizens who served in the United States Armed Forces.
She will remember it as the day she 
received her ﬁ  rst clarinet onstage, with the Gainesville Community Band sit-ting behind her and her band director standing nearby.
Lu, a seventh-grade clarinet player 
at Lincoln Middle School, was awarded a clarinet that was sponsored by Great Southern Music at the James B. King Veterans Day Concert at the Curtis M. Phillips Center for the Performing Arts on Sunday.
Since King’s 2006 death, a deserving 
Alachua County middle school band student has been awarded a memorial clarinet in his honor.
King was a former member of the 
United States Marine Band, and he played in the Gainesville Community Band for 26 years. His wife, Joy King, is a clarinetist in the band and handed the award to Lu.
“I was really surprised and shocked 
because I thought somebody else would get it,” Lu said. “I’m just really happy.”
She is a member of the symphonic 
band at Lincoln Middle School. She said she is preparing for the All-Coun-ty Band auditions in December.
“She participates in class and does 
everything that’s asked of her,” band director Todd Eckstein said. “She’s a neat kid.”
Apart from Lu’s recognition, the con-
cert also comprised 10 patriotic pieces including “The Untitled March,” “Her-itage of Freedom” and “Armed Forces Salute.” More than 200 people attended the concert — including Navy, Coast Guard, Marines, Army and Air Force veterans — who were encouraged to stand up for recognition.
Victorina Basauri has attended the 
concert for the past four years, and she said she is always touched by the ac-Local girl

The Art in Public Places Trust is on the 
lookout for artists.
The trust, a group of citizens chosen 
by the city and county commissions to 
pick art for public projects, is taking art-ists’ applications to create artwork on parts of the soon-to-be Gainesville Police headquarters.
The installations will be a part of the 
headquarters on Northwest Eighth Av-enue and Northwest Sixth Street, said Laura NeSmith, the chairman of Art in Public Places.
According to the press release, con-
struction and renovation on a new 42,500-square-foot facility will begin in January.
The trust is looking for artists for two 
projects, said Russell Etling, a cultural affairs programs coordinator for the City of Gainesville. 
The interior of the building has a bud-
get up to $30,000. The piece on the out-side is budgeted up to $50,000.
More information can be found under 
the “Call to Artists” link on the Division of Cultural Affairs website.For the inside, Etling said the piece 
would be themed toward the relation-ship of law enforcement and the com-munity.
He said the outside should be themed 
as a memorial to law enforcement ofﬁ  -cers who have died in the line of duty.
The trust is planning to work with 
three members of GPD including Cpt. Lonnie Scott and Chief Tony Jones, and citizens to decide on some of the ﬁ  nal pieces, NeSmith said.
“We try to appeal to the public and 
use the most public space we can ﬁ  nd so the public can see and enjoy the art,” she said.

Hiro Asian Sandwich Bistro, located at 3841 SW Archer Road, is set to open after 
Thanksgiving Break. It will offer sandwiches, soups, salads and fries. 
LOCAL
KELCEE GRIFFIS
Alligator Contributing Writer
The latest restaurant from the creators of 
several Gainesville-based Asian cuisine res-
taurants is set to open after Thanksgiving Break.
Hiro Asian Sandwich Bistro, located at 
3841 SW Archer Road, will put an Asian twist on traditional hoagie and hero sub sandwich-es, said owner Johnny Tung.
Tung said Hiro will hire about 25 workers, 
and he anticipates most of those will be stu-dents. So far, he said, about 20 people have submitted applications.
It will open either the Sunday or Monday 
after Thanksgiving, Tung said, but the man-agement team hasn’t pinned down an exact date yet.
Tung said he isn’t worried about com-
petition from other Asian restaurants in Gainesville.
In fact, he owns several of them.Tung, a 2003 UF ﬁ  nance alumnus, began 
launching restaurants a decade ago when he brought Bento Cafe to Gainesville. He’s since created SushiCHAO and Mochi and is antici-pating Hiro’s opening as his fourth successful concept.
Tung, 32, said he runs all the restaurants 
with a primary management team of mostly UF alumni. So far, he’s used Gainesville to pi-lot his restaurants and has expanded to Jack-sonville and Orlando.
“We use Gainesville as a testing ground to 
see if it does well,” Tung said.
Tung said he expects Hiro to thrive because 
it will offer unusual sandwich options such as the “Mr. Miyagi,” a teriyaki chicken-and-veg-etable duo, and the “Lox V egas,” a salmon, avocado and spicy cream cheese combination reminiscent of sushi on a bun.
Most menu items are between $5 and $7.Head chef Chris Pham, 25, said Hiro’s 
kitchen will create popular dishes with un-common seasonings.
He said sandwiches, soups, salads and 
even fries will be covered with Asian ﬁ  ve-spice, cilantro, lemon grass, curry and sesame oil.
Tung said entering the restaurant manage-
ment business felt natural, even in the middle of a challenging economy, because from an early age he helped his parents — immigrants from Taiwan — with their restaurants in New York.
“I grew up in the restaurant business,” 
Tung said. “I didn’t go to preschool. I sat in the kitchen.”Asian-style sandwich shop to open after Thanksgiving
knowledgment of the veterans in 
the audience.
Her son was in the Marines and 
died nine years ago.
“I’m very thankful that these 
musicians do it,” she said. “Of course, I wasn’t going to cry, but I cried.”
Basauri said she thinks it’s 
wonderful the band honors not only the veterans but also aspiring musicians.
“They do it for the future musi-
cians — the little kids in school,” she said. “They’re very thought-ful.”
Geof Gowan, trombone player 
and IT manager for UF’s College of Public Health and Health Pro-fessions, said the award is im-portant because middle school is when most
kids in the area start playing 
instruments.
“The idea is to encourage 
somebody at the beginning of their career,” Gowan said, “to ﬁ  nd a bright, responsible student and give them an instrument for as long as they play, and hopefully that will be for a very long time.”CLARINET , from page 1The band honors veterans

Interstate 75 is now stream-
ing.
The City of Gainesville, the 
Florida Department of Transpor-
tation, UF and Alachua County launched an interstate stream-ing service to broadcast several sections of I-75, said Chip Skin-ner, Gainesville Public Works spokesman. The city announced Wednesday that drivers can use the service to check the high-way’s trafﬁ  c before they hit the road.Images from several sections 
of the interstate are uploaded to the website, gac-smartrafﬁ  c.com, about once a minute. The new cameras are a part of a larger transportation project that should be up in about a year, said Mark C. Wilson, a state trafﬁ  c op-erations engineer out of Tallahas-see.
Ten of the 12 new cameras are 
solar-powered, and most are able to wirelessly transmit the images back to the center.
The full system will also have 
devices that sense the volume of trafﬁ  c and thickness of smoke, and infrared cameras that can see through fog too thick for the cameras.
“All of this is being funded 
with a partnership,” Skinner said. “It’s all part of the smart trafﬁ  c system.”
Each camera cost about $3,200. 
After assembly and installation, the total price of the system came to about $240,000, said Matthew Weisman, an operations engineer for the City of Gainesville.
“It’s giving us quicker detec-
tion and quicker response times, and that’s just with the cameras,” Wilson said. “We have a plan to put a very good system in.”

On gamedays, The Swamp becomes a 
fortress.
During each home game, officers from 
Gainesville Police, University Police, Alach-
ua County Sheriff’s Office, Florida Highway Patrol, Florida Department of Law Enforce-ment and FBI liaisons work together to mon-itor criminal activity and provide security at Ben Hill Griffin Stadium.
Lt. William Gainey , UPD’s special events 
coordinator, said he spends about 70 hours each week during football season choreo-graphing the flow of security , teams, and fans in and out of the stadium.
In the 13 years he has worked home 
games, Gainey has only missed one: His daughter was being born.
On Saturday morning before kickoff for 
UF’s Homecoming game, Gainey led se-curity protocol briefings with officers from different police agencies and representatives from the University Athletic Association.
For some, it was the last time they’d be off 
their feet for the next 10 hours.
“You don’t really get any breaks,” Gainey 
said.
From their stadium command post, em-
ployees with the City of Gainesville’s Traf-fic Operations Division used computers and cameras to control every traffic light from Interstate 75 to The Swamp and watch over GPD officers working near intersections.
At the corner of Gale Lemerand Drive 
and Southwest Archer Road early Saturday morning, GPD officers Ben Tobias and Lynne Valdes waited for the call from dispatch to shut down the intersection.
At about 9:50 a.m., their radios buzzed 
with chatter as the first motorcade started on its way.
Down the road, flashing lights from the 
motorcade grew brighter as the escort ap-proached the intersection. Tobias opened the corner traffic box, flipped a switch to man-ual control and plugged in what he called a “traffic-cutter” wire.
The process repeated two more times: 
when NCAA referees arrived in a white van and when the University of Louisiana’s team was escorted by an ASO motorcade.
Near the stadium’s north end zone, GPD 
officers managed security during the Gator Walk while UPD officers at the south end zone escorted Louisiana players onto the field and to their locker room.
“How’s it going, LT?” said an officer from 
his motorcycle as Gainey walked by.
“Pretty good, how about you?”“Another day in paradise,” the officer 
said. “And a perfect day for football.”
With almost an hour and a half to kick-
off, UPD, GPD and ASO officers began filing fans into the stadium, searching their bags and watching for suspicious behavior.
“What we’re doing here is protecting 
90,000 people, and we don’t take that very lightly,” Gainey said. “Every entrance to the stadium has a uniform.”
By the south end zone, GPD Detective 
Blair Ettinger stood on watch with five other officers as fans entered the stadium. Ettinger said he’s seen people bring in fake toy guns, full bottles of liquor, drugs and even a flask disguised as a pair of binoculars.
“We just have a wide variety of weird 
things that have come in,” he said. “We’ve seen some interesting things in bags.”
By the end of Saturday’s game, police 
had ejected 17 people for possession of al-cohol, disorderly conduct and false student IDs. Officers also arrested one person for disorderly intoxication, according to a UPD news release.
The most people police ejected from a 
game this season occurred when officers 
kicked out 106 people during the Louisiana State University game on Oct. 6, according to UPD news release archives.

“General Betray-Us” 
Why his affair matters 
Here are some quick facts that you need to know in order 
to make real conversation this week:
One: Gen. David Petraeus, (yes, that Petraeus) 
stepped down from his position as director of the CIA on Fri-day.
Two: He resigned, rather abruptly, due to an extramarital af-
fair that was discovered by an FBI probe.
Three: His affair was with one of the people writing his biog-
raphy, Paula Broadwell.
Four: His resignation came about a week or so before a trial 
before Congress about the terrorist attack in Benghazi, Libya.
Five: The title of his biography is “All In.”There’s probably more to the story than “military man has 
affair.” Quite frankly , the fact that anybody has an affair is not an example of necessary news.
The root of the problem comes from why the FBI was investi-
gating Petraeus and Broadwell in the ﬁ  rst place. They were try-ing to trace back anonymous emails sent to Jill Kelley.
Kelley is a “long-time friend of the Petraeus family and a 
Tampa, Florida volunteer social liaison with military families at MacDill Air Force Base,” according to Reuters.
She received multiple threatening emails from Broadwell; 
these emails essentially amounted to: “stay away from my man.” Even that isn’t exactly a hard-hitting or necessary fact.
The FBI also discovered that Broadwell “seemed to offer some 
salient tidbits about the circumstances of the attack by Islamist extremists” in Benghazi during a speech she gave at the Uni-versity of Denver in late October with details that she shouldn’t have been aware of, according to the Christian Science Monitor.
She also gave details in the speech that appeared to contradict 
testimony Petraeus gave about the attacks in front of Congress.
“After being married for over 37 years, I showed extremely 
poor judgment by engaging in an extramarital affair,” Petraeus, 60, wrote in his resignation letter to fellow CIA employees. “Such behavior is unacceptable, both as a husband and as the leader of an organization such as ours.”
It’s not exactly clear at this moment if the FBI closed its inves-
tigation into a possible intelligence leak, and there doesn’t ap-pear to be any “criminal or national security matters involved.”
What does this mean for Petraeus’ Benghazi testimony next 
week? Does his resignation from CIA director mean that he doesn’t have to testify?
Not to mention, this abrupt resignation occurred during Vet-
erans Day weekend, a time when America remembers the brave men and women who fought to secure our country and its free-doms. This kind of places a foul covering over what should be a time of honor.
“General Petraeus is one of America’s most outstanding and 
distinguished military leaders and a true American patriot,” said Rep. Peter King, a New York Republican who heads the House Committee on Homeland Security.
This shouldn’t detract from the service Petraeus provided to 
our country, but it could be detrimental to the information we learn about the attack in Benghazi.Avoiding the deadly sins this holiday season
Believe it or not, the holiday season is fast approach-
ing. 
Although some (myself included) say these 
months make up the best time of the year, I also believe this season can make people go crazy.
The seven deadly sins are a universal concept. We’re hu-
man, and we’re all guilty of them at one point or another. The good thing is we actually have this thing inside us called self-control.
Sloth has to be the most comforting of these sins. It’s 
easy to spend all these long weekends and days off doing absolutely nothing. Just don’t forget before the full Winter Break arrives, there are exams to pass, end-of-year reports to prepare and more.
Some see sloth as taking or receiving more than you give. 
It never hurts to be charitable. Start small, keep giving, and you’ll be surprised at how generous you can actually be.
Greed can be deﬁ  ned as an obsession with possessions. 
I can’t fail to mention the intriguing yet horriﬁ  c stories of post-Thanksgiving Black Friday shopping. People stay up into the late hours of the night, wait in long lines in the cold and in some cases, physically hurt themselves and/or oth-ers in an attempt to get a good deal on something like a new electronic device.
I hope you don’t think getting a new television at a low 
cost is worth your safety or sanity.
Gluttony refers to any kind of overindulgence. For me 
personally, holiday meals constitute my heaviest food con-sumption of the entire year. We take off work and school to celebrate these holidays. Because lavish meals are a tradi-tional part of many celebrations, can’t we say we essentially take off work and school to eat? It’s a funny concept.
Remember, there is a difference between satisfying your 
needs and satisfying your wants. We’re so self-centered, we’ve managed to blur the line between the two.
A man’s pride can keep him from doing a lot of things. 
I fall guilty to this and refuse to ask anybody for anything. Otherwise, pride easily leads to the concept of narcissism.
Lately I’ve been noticing that a 
lot of people are simply very into themselves. I feel you miss out on so much in life when all you can focus on is the person in the mir-ror. Loving yourself isn’t a bad thing at all, but how much is too 
much?
Conﬁ  dence is a great thing, but the ego can make us do 
terrible things  — including lose focus on who and what is actually important.
Envy is easy to fall guilty to. It’s not at all difﬁ  cult to 
become a little jealous of the people around you, especially during the holiday season. Other people will receive extrav-agant gifts and take extravagant trips while you’re working a seasonal job or babysitting the younger members of your extended family at home.
Don’t be bitter about it. Life will be different for every-
body. We’ve got to learn to appreciate and accept it.
Envy can easily turn into wrath. Anger is a natural emo-
tion, but everyone experiences it at different levels. We also express it and deal with it differently. Just don’t let it make you say or do something you’ll later regret.
An unhealthy desire for something constitutes lust. The 
old song says “breaking up is hard to do,” but I’d say (today especially) controlling lust is much harder to do.
Let’s make it clear that lust takes many forms. Whether 
it be money, a person, a certain gift — don’t let yourself get wrapped up in wanting something you would probably be just ﬁ  ne without.
I hope the start of the holiday season treats you well. Enjoy all the time off and spend it with who you love, 
doing something, anything, worthwhile.

Over the past several months, Graduate Assis-
tants United GAU has been bargaining with UF administration to end fees and raise the 
minimum wage; include specific health care language that guarantees dental and vision insurance; and pro-tect graduate assistant families through family medical leave and child care.
The current efforts to reasonably improve the con-
tract of GAs appear to have stagnated, and the existing working conditions undermine the effectiveness of our services to The Gator Nation.
For the past 30 years, GAU has made it possible for 
GAs to have tuition waivers, workload limits, minimum stipends, GatorGradCare, fee deferment, academic free-dom, due process, fair evaluations and the right to file grievances. These gains have been significant, but stu-dent fees (which have increased by 138 percent since the 2001-2002 academic year) and health care changes (dental and vision were recently dropped when switch-ing insurance providers) have significantly reduced our already meager benefits, and the current contract needs to be adjusted to reflect current costs and living expenses.
The problems with the current contract not only af-
fect GAs: Ask an undergraduate student if they would 
like to have a teacher with a toothache, bad vision and no ac-cess to child care. We teach half the undergraduate courses at UF and also conduct a signifi-
cant portion of the research on campus.
Our proposals to administration are very fair and 
economical. The 2012 Health and Human Services Poverty Guidelines indicate that for a family of one, an income of $11,170 per year would be considered pov-erty. Our current minimum stipend is $10,000 per year, and we propose to increase it to $11,000 per year. This increase may not seem very significant, and it’s not — these folks will still be earning poverty wages — but it will go a long way to ease the burden for some of my Corry Village neighbors who are GAs and are support-ing a family of four.
Fees at UF are dramatically higher than most peer 
institutions. At Michigan State University, for example, virtually all GAs are exempt from fees. GAs at Oregon State University receive a $300 rebate for fees from the university and end up paying $205.47 per semester. UF charges roughly $1,100 per year in fees, and many GAs take second jobs to pay these fees, diverting attention from their degree program, their teaching, their research and their capacity to mentor undergraduate students.
The complete lack of family and medical leave pro-
tection for GAs is deficient at best and reckless at worst. Many graduate assistants that have children over the course of the semester continue teaching within a week of giving birth because taking a leave of absence means they are no longer employees of UF, and neither they nor their infants qualify for health insurance. No one should have to choose between their own health and that of their newborn child.
These are just some examples of the current issues 
and bargaining items affecting all of the nearly 4,200 graduate assistants at UF. UF’s refusal to address these issues is a disservice to its reputation.
Today at noon on the Plaza of the Americas, GAU 
will be holding a rally to draw attention to the bar -
gaining process. I invite all graduate students that care about their livelihood and all undergraduate students who care about having teachers and mentors that can offer all the quality and attention they deserve to join us in support of a better contract for GAs.

Speaking OutWe all know that teen pregnancy is a problem. 
But for most of us, it is a far-off threat, one 
that is confined to the glow of MTV’s “Teen 
Mom” on Tuesday nights. 
The idea of being a mother or father at this point in life 
or earlier is, for many of us, a distant concern. 
My typical reaction when Facebook shows me yet an-
other girl from my high school sporting a baby bump is 
either a sigh or a passing thought of condolence. 
Personally, it is difficult to imagine toting around a cry-
ing, miniature me on my hip, especially since I find it hard enough to take care of myself each day. 
However, with recent attacks on Planned Parenthood 
and its contraceptive services, and the prevalence of ab-stinence-only sex education in public schools, my high school classmates’ situations and the country’s financial concerns are inextricably linked.
Which costs more: birth control pills or a tiny, fully 
dependent human raised to adulthood? 
As it turns out, birth control is a tad more cost effec-
tive, by about $226,000. 
And which is more effective in preventing teen preg-
nancy: access to birth control or telling hormone-laden 
teens “just don’t do it” “Mean Girls”-style? 
Again, the answer is not surprising. New Hampshire boasts one of the country’s lowest 
teen birth rates, with just 16 births per 1,000 women aged 15 to 19. Compare this to New Mexico, one of the country’s highest teen birth rates, at 62 births per 1,000 teenage girls. 
As common sense would imply, New Hampshire 
requires a comprehensive sex education course in schools. 
Though it includes abstinence, it does not focus on it 
entirely like in many more conservative states. 
New Mexico requires no sex education, and other 
states with similarly high birth rates (such as Texas, Arkansas and Mississippi) stress an abstinence-only ap-proach. 
These costs aren’t confined to the parents or families 
of these children of teen parents. 
Each publicly financed unplanned pregnancy costs 
an average of $10,000. American taxpayers spend ap-proximately $11 billion per year on medical care for the 1.25 million unintended pregnancies through programs like Medicaid and the Children’s Health Insurance Pro-gram.
Thinking back to middle school and my experience with Tennessee’s abstinence-only sex education program, it seems less and less shocking that so many girls from my high school had children so young. It makes me wonder what would have 
happened if these teen parents — and teen parents from the other 26 states that require abstinence be stressed — had access not only to contraception but also to knowl-edge of all preventative measures. 
A study conducted by the University of Washington 
explores that hypothetical: Teens who received a com-prehensive sex education were 60 percent less likely to become pregnant. 
Not only that, but a 2007 federal report showed that 
abstinence-only approaches, like the one I received in Tennessee, had “no impacts on rates of sexual absti-nence.” 
To put it simply, it’s not working, and that sort of Pu-
ritan approach hurts young girls, burdening them (and taxpayers) with the heavy financial cost a child brings.
This is why Planned Parenthood and realistic sex 
education are so important. 
In a 2008 study, the Guttmacher Institute estimated 
that for every $1 spent on family-planning services, groups like Planned Parenthood save taxpayers $3.74 in government spending on health care before and in the year after the baby is born. 
Realistic sex education — which explains all meth-
ods of contraception, their efficacy and how to purchase them — gives young people the power to choose their fate and costs no more than the unsuccessful abstinence-only approach. 
Simply abandoning ineffective education methods in 
favor of a more reasonable policy can reduce teen preg-nancies and their subsequent impact on society. 
It’s not fair that the students in my high school were 
less informed and able to make smart decisions about their sex lives just because of the values of the com-munities in which they grew up, just as it’s unfair that Planned Parenthood funding is being cut in those same states. 
Geography should not dictate one’s ability to con-
trol one’s sex life and prevent an unintended birth, nor should conservative states force that financial burden on the rest of the country.

Kathy Graham set up her 
tent as the early morning rays 
lit up downtown Alachua.
Graham, of Graham Farms, 
unloaded her jars of strawber -
ry and grape spreads, ready for her early crowd of jam fans.
“I’ve got a 1-800-jam-ad-
diction hotline set up,” she joked. “You can get that in a grocery store, but it won’t be mine.”
About 7,000 people flocked 
to downtown Alachua on Sun-day to spend time with family and honor local veterans at the 10th annual Alachua Har -
vest Festival.
Coordinated around UF’s 
Homecoming weekend, the festival fell on Veterans Day for the first time this year. The celebration kicked off with renditions of “God Bless America” and “God Bless the USA.”
Founded in 2003, the semi-
annual festival began with about 15 vendors and only a few hundred visitors. Now, 5,000 to 7,000 people attend each spring and fall festival.
“Pretty much the whole 
town comes out,” said Rosa-nne Morse, treasurer of the Alachua Business League, one of the festival sponsors.
More than 200 vendors of diverse products ranging from gourmet dog treats to Bolga baskets lined a half-mile stretch of Main Street to connect with the community and grow their businesses, Morse said.
Proceeds from the festival 
will be put toward a scholar -
ship that will pay for a year’s tuition at Santa Fe College for a Santa Fe High School stu-dent interested in studying business or entrepreneurship.
Musicians played a range 
of music for crowds at two stage areas all afternoon, and locals grilled up a range of cultural fare including barbe-cue, seafood and Cuban food. Children bounced in inflat-able houses and enjoyed face painting and games. Morse said nonprofit companies got to participate in the festival for free if they provided an activity for children.
The Cub Scouts of Pack 
88 collected Christmas and thank-you cards, and mon-ey for the Military Support Group of Alachua County to send to troops overseas. Sev-eral vendors offered specials or discounts for veterans, said Kelly Harris, logistics coor -
dinator for the festival and owner of Kelly’s Kreations Gift Baskets.
As a small-business owner, 
Harris said showing potential customers her baskets in per -
son makes a huge difference.

Bruce Doyle never knew his 
father.
When he was a year old, his 
father died in the Vietnam War. 
Doyle spent most of his life ex-ploring his passion for the Ameri-can Fighter Aces, an organization that honors pilots who took down five or more hostile aircrafts in combat, and trying to figure out what led to his dad’s death.
“My kids were the same age 
as my father was when he died, and I still couldn’t tell them what happened to their grandfather,” he said.
Doyle, 68, shared his collection 
of Fighter Aces autographs as part of the Florida Museum of Natural History’s Veteran’s Day Military Recognition Event on Sunday.
The museum recreated a World War I Balloon Corps encampment on its main floor. World War I military uniforms, pilot helmets and gloves, and photos were on display.
Tiffany Ireland, a 36-year-old 
education assistant at the muse-um, said it was the first time the museum had celebrated Veterans Day with a focus on aviation. The museum is hosting the Peanuts exhibit, which features Charlie Brown’s pet beagle, Snoopy.
“He is a mascot for the Air 
Force Control and is known for being against the Red Baron,” she said. “That’s why we decided to focus on World War I and air -
power.”Col. George Mazzeo, a United 
States Air Force veteran and San-ta Fe College professor, gave a presentation called “WWI and the Birth of Airpower” to an audience of about 15 people.
He said only a small percent-
age of the population are veter -
ans.
“We ask so few people to sacri-
fice so much,” he said.
Doyle was a part of Mazzeo’s 
audience. He looked down at his shirt, which had a B-25 bomber printed on it, knowing now that his father, Lt. George Doyle, was in that model of plane when it was shot down in June 1945.
Doyle said he feels that through 
his research and support of the Fighter Aces, he pays tribute to veterans every day.
“Veterans give up all their to-
morrows for our todays,” he said. “It’s important to give thanks.”

 � IT WAS THE CONE PARK 
BRANCH’S CELEBRATION.
ANDREA CARROZ
Alligator Contributing Writer
Kids flocked to a small Gainesville 
library Saturday for an unconventional 
birthday party.
The Alachua County Library Dis-
trict Cone Park Branch held a birthday party to celebrate the library’s first year in the community.
Library manager Heather Sostrom 
said the library initially had trouble get-ting the word out that the new branch had opened. Despite the hurdle, she said it’s been a busy year for the tiny branch.
Some residents said the library had 
helped the community during the past year.
“My nieces and nephews come ev-
ery day just to go to the library ,” said Tawanda Rochelle, Gainesville resi-dent. “It was really nice for them to do this for the community.”
The library , located on 2841 E. 
University Ave., is set to get a larger, permanent building. Sostrom said the groundbreaking will be in January , and the larger building is planned to open this summer to replace the temporary trailer where the library is set up.
The library celebrated its first year 
with two large, chocolate-covered va-nilla birthday cakes, jugglers and party favors of books. 
The Alachua County Beekeepers 
Club, one of the organizations that came to the celebration, brought in bee-hives filled with bees to teach children about the insects. 
While some children went around 
to look at the organizations’ tables, oth-ers played in the park, danced along to the disc jockey’s music and played football.
About 125 people attended the 
event. Most of the crowd were chil-dren.
An employee from the Department 
of Parks, Recreation and Cultural Af-fairs told children about the depart-ment’s after-school programs.
Hollie Greer, recreation leader for 
the department, brought a live corn snake named Arthur.
When Greer took Arthur out of his 
container, kids ran up to the snake. Gainesville resident Omar Artis en-couraged his son to touch the snake.
“I came out here to entertain my 
son,” Artis said. “This is a garden of Eden for the children. They can come to the library, to the track and play bas-ketball.”Built to help community,

 After 10 games of waiting and 
an offseason of preparation, Jaco-
by Brissett is getting his chance.
  Brissett entered Saturday’s 
27-20 win against Louisiana in the third quarter after starter Jeff Driskel suffered a sprained right ankle.
  Coach Will Muschamp called Driskel doubtful for Saturday’s game against Jacksonville State.
The sophomore is wearing a 
walking boot on his injured ankle as a precautionary measure. 
Muschamp plans to evalu-
ate Driskel during Wednesday’s practice before making a ﬁ  nal de-cision.
  Muschamp is conﬁ  dent Bris-
sett can do the job. 
The sophomore backup start-ed two games as a true freshman and stayed in contention for the starting job this season until Sept. 3 — the Monday following the season opener.
  “We have all the conﬁ  dence in 
the world that Jacoby will play well,” Muschamp said. 
“He’s going to have the op-
portunities to make good choices and decisions on the ﬁ  eld, which he’ll do.”
  Brissett completed 6 of 8 pass-
es for 64 yards and a touchdown in relief of Driskel. 
He engineered the game-tying 
drive against the Ragin’ Cajuns, capping it off with a 3-yard touch-down pass to wideout Quinton Dunbar.
  “We knew it was a ‘man down, 
man up’ situation,” wide receiver Frankie Hammond Jr. said. “He’s a pretty good quarterback too, so we knew that eventually he could come through and pull this game through for us.”
  Brissett, the former two-sport 
star at West Palm Beach Dwyer High, teamed up with tight end Jordan Reed for the offensive play of the game. 
  His 39-yard completion to 
Reed put Florida at the Louisiana 3-yard line and set up the tying score to Dunbar.
  Brissett always dreamed of 
leading his team to a comeback victory.
  “It was great,” Brissett said. 
“That last drive is probably the best drive, the best feeling you’ll have in the world.”
  With Driskel solidifying him-
self as the starter, Brissett said the hardest part has been staying on track.

  JOE MORGAN
 Alligator Staff Writer
   
 Linebacker Neiron Ball (ankle) and wide 
receiver Andre Debose (sprained knee) are  
doubtful for Florida’s game against Jack-sonville State on Saturday.  Ball injured his ankle early in Florida’s 27-20 win against Louisiana on Saturday, while Debose missed the game entirely.
  Safety De’Ante Saunders, who has been 
UF’s primary punt returner in Debose’s ab-sence, injured his knee against the Ragin’ Cajuns. 
His status moving forward is unknown.  “I’ll know more about him as the week 
rolls on,” coach Will Muschamp said of Saunders.
  Left guard James Wilson (knee) and left 
tackle Xavier Nixon (knee) will return to practice on Tuesday. 
Wilson and Nixon should boost Flori-
da’s struggling offensive line, which sur-rendered ﬁ  ve sacks to Louisiana on Satur-day.
  Ian Silberman suffered a shoulder injury while playing in Wilson’s place and will have his status updated on Wednesday, 
Muschamp said.
  Running back Mack 
Brown (ankle) will return to practice on Tuesday af-ter not playing against the Ragin’ Cajuns.
  Defensive back Val-
dez Showers (shoulder) will resume practicing on 
Wednesday.
  Wide receiver Stephen Alli (shoulder) “will be ﬁ  ne” to play in the Gators’ home ﬁ  nale, Muschamp said.
    Offensive line struggling: In Saturday’s 
27-20 win against Louisiana, Florida strug-gled in pass protection. 
The Gators surrendered ﬁ  ve sacks and 
a quarterback hurry to the Ragin’ Cajuns, who had recorded just 13 sacks in their pre-vious eight games.
  “It’s communication, really,” right guard 
Jon Halapio said of Florida’s struggles to 
 Gators injury situation in flux as season nears conclusion Brissett to have starting opportunity
Driskel unlikely to play
  The Florida offense is focused on the little things.
  The little things have caused 
problems, but the big picture is equally disconcerting.
  “It’s just guys being locked in and 
focused, just looking at ﬁ  lm studying and just ﬁ  nding the detail,” wide re-ceiver Frankie Hammond Jr. said. “It’s a game (of) inches. It may be one split second that you react late, that you miss a guy or a timing of a pass. Each play is something different. It’s the little details we just have to hone in on, and we’ll be ﬁ  ne.”
  Sure, penalties have been an issue. The Gators rank 112th 
in the country with 7.9 ﬂ  ags per game. The timing in the passing game has been inconsistent at best. But limiting the criticisms of the unit to those areas ignores the real problem. The overall output has been shockingly bad for the seventh-ranked team in college football.
  The Gators somehow survived Southeastern Conference 
play with just one loss despite having the 107th-ranked of-fense in the country. Regardless of these struggles, most thought Saturday’s matchup with Louisiana would be a game in which the offense wouldn’t be an issue. The Ragin’ Cajuns entered Saturday with the nation’s 89th-ranked defense and were allowing 433.2 yards per game.
  But, instead of an offensive explosion, Florida’s attack 
struggled in a 27-20 win. Struggling against SEC teams is one thing, but looking inept against a Sun Belt foe is a real cause for concern. 
  Facing a Ragin’ Cajuns team that ranks fourth in the Sun 
Belt Conference, the Gators continued their season-long streak of getting outgained in the ﬁ  rst quarter. Before its 85-yard touchdown drive that ended with seven seconds re-maining in the ﬁ  rst half, Florida mustered only 63 yards on 26 plays.
  For the game, the Gators ﬁ  nished with just 311 yards of 
total offense — only 16.4 yards more than the Ragin’ Cajuns had allowed through the air on average in their ﬁ  rst eight  Offensive ineptitude 
exposed on Saturday

Kat Williamson pushes the ball in Florida’s 2-0 win against 
FGCU on Friday in the first round of the NCAA Tournament. 
ADAM LICHTENSTEIN
Alligator Writer
 
Florida coach Becky Burleigh 
started two underclassmen at center 
back against Florida Gulf Coast on Friday, but she had an All-American waiting in the wings.
Redshirt senior Kat Williamson 
had not played since Sept. 2 due to a torn right meniscus. 
After two months of recovery and 
rehabilitation, she returned in the first match of the NCAA Tourna-ment.
“We had talked about it as the 
week progressed,” Burleigh said. “As we got sort of toward the middle of the week, we thought it was more and more an option, and then we started talking about, ‘OK, how are we going to manage this?’”
Williamson came into the match 
as a substitute in the 27th minute and received a round of applause from the crowd and her teammates.
“I actually tried to keep my emo-
tions in check,” Williamson said. “I knew it was going to be a little 
hectic, and it’s been a while, so I was just trying to stay calm and com-posed.”
Senior midfielder Erika Tymrak 
had a tougher time staying collect-ed when Williamson came onto the field.
“I almost started tearing up,” she 
said. 
Freshman Christen Westphal, who 
has anchored the Gators’ defense in Williamson’s absence, said there was a change in team chemistry when Williamson came into the game.
“It’s definitely different, especial-
ly when Kat came up to me and was like, ‘Talk to me,’” Westphal said. “I’m the one who usually was like, ‘Kat, you need to tell me everything to do.’”
Williamson played 33 minutes 
against the Eagles, splitting time with sophomore Karina Gutsche. 
With Williamson returning and 
sophomore Annie Bobbitt recover -
ing from a knee sprain, the Gators’ back line is becoming increasingly crowded.
“It’s a great luxury,” Burleigh 
said. “Kat brings a ton of experi-ence. Karina, prior to playing in the middle, was playing out wide, so I’m sure that they’ll split time.”
Although having an All-American 
coming off the bench gives Florida an advantage going into the team’s second-round matchup against UCF on Friday in Gainesville, Burleigh said Williamson’s time will be lim-ited as she makes her way back from her injury.
“We have no expectation that 
Kat’s going to play 90 minutes at this point,” she said. “But it was great to see her out there. It’s exciting.”
All-American’s return bolsters UF defense
“I actually tried to keep my 
emotions in check. I knew it 
was going to be a little hectic, 
and it’s been a while, so I was 
just trying to stay calm and 
composed.”

UF defenderpick up blitzes. “Especially when 
we have young guys like Ian Sil-berman and D.J. Humphries. I’m not saying that they played bad, it’s just that we’ve got to pick it up together as a unit.”
Wide receiver Frankie Ham-
mond Jr. added: “It’s just every-body getting on the same page and just making reads and every-thing. But things happen fast. I’m pretty sure they look at the film and see what we did wrong, or what blitzes or anything might af-fect us.”
Wilson, Nixon, Halapio and 
Silberman have all missed time with injuries during the past two weeks.
Injuries have diminished Flor -
ida’s ability to rotate offense line-men, but the “man down, man up” mantra has kept the Gators going. 
Hammond said the offensive 
linemen have been handling in-creased work the best they can.
“Guys have to pick up the 
reps,” Hammond said. “If there’s not a guy to come in and help you out, those guys know that they’re going to have to play an extra 10, 20 plays just because they don’t have a backup, then that’s what we need to do to get the job done.”
With just one more game to 
correct its issues before facing No. 10 Florida State on Nov. 24 in Tallahassee, UF is working on getting healthy and regaining the momentum it had in October after defeating No. 8 LSU and No. 12 South Carolina.
“It’s definitely a big concern,” 
Halapio said of the offensive line’s recent struggles. “But we’re just going to watch film and cor -
rect our mistakes.”

was one play away from tak-ing over.
“That’s what I had to take 
with me going to watch film every day, making sure I’m out at practice really locked in and not just standing around waiting for my next rep to go in,” Brissett said.
Although Brissett came 
through late, Florida’s pass-ing offense had another sub-par performance.
UF’s two quarterbacks 
combined for 162 yards against the nation’s No. 112 pass defense.
While Driskel gives Flori-
da a running threat, Brissett attacks defenses from the pocket. 
Brissett’s first start of 
2012 will be against Jackson-ville State, the 110th-ranked pass defense in the Football Championship Subdivision, the lower class of Division I.His continuing effort to 
stay involved in the offense impressed teammates and coaches, including offensive coordinator Brent Pease. 
Muschamp thinks the rest 
of the Gators can learn from Brissett’s preparation. 
“You never know when 
your number is going to be called,” Muschamp said.
“There’s no question. I 
think it’s a great example for us all. When your number is called, you better hurry up and perform, and perform well.”

games. 
Four other Sun Belt teams gained more 
yards than Florida did against Louisiana 
— Arkansas State, North Texas, Troy and Louisiana-Monroe. The difference in yard-age was not slim, either, as the four Sun Belt teams combined to average 200.3 yards per game more against the Ragin’ Cajuns than the Gators accumulated against them.Some might attribute this to Florida not 
taking Louisiana seriously and premature-ly looking ahead to a crucial showdown with Florida State in Tallahassee on Nov. 24. 
But Will Muschamp swears his team 
had respect for the Ragin’ Cajuns. In the week leading up to the game, Muschamp said on multiple occasions that Louisiana was a dangerous team and that he had a great deal of respect for their defensive co-ordinator, Greg Stewart. If the team wants to 
continue to say it ap-proaches every game the same way, then there is no excuse for Saturday’s per -
formance.
And don’t be fooled 
if the explosion finally comes this weekend 
against Jacksonville State. Although the Gamecocks might get lumped in with the Ragin’ Cajuns as another cupcake oppo-nent, they are a far lesser challenge.
They are an FCS team, and within that 
lesser classification Jacksonville State ranks 108th in total defense and 110th in pass defense out of 121 teams.
Florida has had countless opportuni-
ties to show us that its offense is more than what meets the eye. But at this point, it’s clear that the eye test is as good of a mea-suring stick as any for this unit.

When coach Billy Donovan 
suspended starting point guard 
Scottie Wilbekin on Thursday, shooting guard Kenny Boynton took on a different role. 
The Gators have relied on 
the 6-foot-2 senior to play point guard as Wilbekin serves his in-definite suspension. 
Boynton averaged 2.7 assists 
and a team-high 15.9 points on 11.5 field goal attempts per game last season.
“A lot of people think, because 
he’s been such a prolific scorer, that if you play him at the point, it’s going to hurt our team, (and) it’s going to inhibit him from scor -
ing,” Donovan said.
So far, the experiment has 
yielded mixed results.
Boynton scored six points, 
notched three assists and com-mitted four turnovers in one half against Georgetown on the deck of the USS Bataan in Jacksonville on Friday night.Two of Boynton’s giveaways 
came via ill-advised passes. The other two were the result of an of-fensive foul and a travel.  
Friday’s contest was called at 
halftime due to condensation on the court. 
“Luckily, it was wiped out,” 
Boynton said. “I went back and watched over the first half. Those turnovers could have been pre-vented. It’ll just get better in time.”
Against Alabama State two 
days later, Boynton looked more comfortable with his point guard duties, tallying five assists against no turnovers in an 84-35 victory. 
While Boynton distributed the 
ball to his teammates, he never hesitated to shoot, recording a team-best 22 points on 8-of-10 shooting. He was also 4 of 4 from behind the arc. 
“I came out this game and just 
tried to make the simple play in-stead of forcing it,” Boynton said. “I just wanted to let it come to me. I calmed myself down.” 
Boynton will be Florida’s start-
er at point guard for the immedi-ate future. The Gators’ official site posted during the weekend that Wilbekin’s suspension would last four games, but Donovan said on Sunday that the timetable re-mains indefinite. 
“I have not met with him since 
we’ve been back,” Donovan said. “I saw him briefly to say hello to him, but I have not spoken to him at all. There’s still information I have to gather. As of right now, I am not playing him against Wis-consin.”
When the No. 10 Gators (1-0) 
host the No. 22 Badgers (1-0) on Wednesday night in the O’Connell Center, Boynton will square off against redshirt freshman George Marshall at the point.The 5-foot-11 Marshall has 
played only one collegiate game. Wisconsin pushed him into the starting role after junior guard Josh Gasser suffered an ACL tear more than two weeks ago. “[Boynton] understands when 
to shoot,” Donovan said. “Ken-ny understands, being a senior now, just the different things he needs to do. I’ve got confidence in him.”16, ALLIGATOR � TUESDAY, NOVEMBER 13, 2012

Jaterra Bonds received a pass from fresh-
man Chandler Cooper, drove through the 
lane and made a layup while getting fouled. 
After Georgia State cut Florida’s lead to 
single digits with fewer than four minutes remaining in the first half, successive three-point plays by Bonds gave the Gators a com-fortable advantage. 
“I just tried to be aggressive and get out in transition and attack,” Bonds said. “They weren’t stopping the ball, so we went down their throat.”
Bonds, a junior guard, finished with 15 
points in the first half and 17 overall as Flori-da defeated Georgia State 84-65 on Sunday in the O’Connell Center. 
After outscoring Fairfield 14-0 in the fast-
break on Friday, Florida again took control of the game in transition. Bonds led the way.
“We were having a lot of advantages,” 
Bonds said. “A lot of two-on-ones and three-on-twos, so I was just trying to get out and be aggressive.”
Bonds has developed as a complete play-
er, coach Amanda Butler said. 
Last season, Bonds struggled with shot se-
lection. Through two games, Butler has seen 
a more mature, com-posed player. 
“When a player 
plays a very ag-gressive, attacking style, a lot of times 
they don’t get as much credit for how well they think,” Butler said. “She is a very, very smart basketball player. She is a student of the game.”
Behind Bonds and the return of Jennifer 
George, who scored a team-leading 19 points and pulled down eight rebounds, Florida was too much for Georgia State. The Gators led by as many as 29 points in the second half. 
The win gave Butler her 100th victory as 
Florida’s coach. That total is second only to her mentor, Carol Ross, who recorded 247 career wins at UF. 
“I’ve been very blessed to coach some ex-
traordinary women,” Butler said. “But the reality is No. 101 is what is most important right now.”
Junior guard shines in transition, improving all-around game
Bonds scored 17 points on Sunday“Kenny understands, 
being a senior now, just the 
different things he needs 
to do. I’ve got confidence in
