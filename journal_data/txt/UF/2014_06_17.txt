Christina Montana is one of many col-
lege graduates who is in debt from her un-
dergraduate degree. 
Even with a job and scholarships, the 
22-year-old UF English alumna has about 
$34,000 worth of loan debt. Once she start-ed looking at the repayment plans for loans, 
she started getting nervous about paying 
them back. 
However, the Obama administration is 
expanding the “Pay As You Earn” plan, which will cap student loan payments at 
10 percent of graduates’ income. The hope 
is to encourage students to pursue higher education and make it more affordable. 
The goal is to make this program avail-
able by Dec. 31, 2015.
Rick Wilder, director of student ﬁ  nan-
cial affairs at UF, said this program will be available to students who graduated after 
2007 and will only affect students once they 
graduate.
About 20 million Americans attend col-
lege each year, and about 60 percent of col-lege attendees borrow money to cover the costs annually, according to American Stu-
dent Assistance. 
UF is already playing a big role to help 
students ﬁ  nancially and economically with borrowing and repaying loans, Wilder 
said.  
UF graduates’ average debt is $21,700, 
which is $9,000 less than the national aver-
age, he said. 
In 2013, roughly 19,000 students at UF Obama seeks to expand loan repayment plan

The City of Gainesville, in cooperation with local 
apartment complexes like College Park Apartments and 
University Heights, will undergo a change in parking 
regulations.
The decision was made in interest of improving three 
issues identiﬁ  ed in the target areas.
“Public infrastructure (sidewalks, curbs, etc.) were be-
ing damaged by vehicles accessing parking, there was al-
ready similar parking regulations for adjacent properties zoned single-family and the new regulations should aes-thetically improve the subject areas,” wrote Christopher Cooper, code enforcement division manager for the City 
of Gainesville, in an email. 
Students who live in the affected areas must park their 
cars within the spaces designated by their respective 
landlords or property owners.
If any complications arise with the decision, City of 
Gainesville staff will be available to assist property own-ers with creating a parking plan that meets their needs in 
accordance with the city. 
Although the notiﬁ  cations for the neighborhoods were 
sent out Monday, property owners are set to receive the 
informational packet in the coming weeks. 
Both College Park Apartments and University Heights 
ofﬁ  cials did not know about the notiﬁ  cations being sent but said they would be more than willing to comply to the city’s requests. Parking regulation

Alachua County Sheriff’s deputies arrested a man early 
Monday after allegedly shooting at a cat with children 
nearby and for possession of weed.
Ofﬁ  cers arrested 62-year-old Turner Wilson on charges 
of possession of a weapon or ammo by a convicted felon, 
ﬁ  ring a weapon in public or residential property, posses-
sion of less than 20 grams of marijuana and tormenting animals, according to an ASO arrest report.  
On Sunday around 10 p.m., a deputy was called to the 
17506 SW 183rd Ave. house for an armed disturbance. The children were staying the night at their grandmother’s house where Wilson allegedly used a revolver to shoot at a cat that was also inside the house while the children were sleeping, according to the report.
The children’s mother heard the gunshot from next 
door and watched Wilson take the cat from the house. After she came to check on the commotion, she took her children from the house.
A deputy arrived and noticed Wilson exit the house, ac-
cording to the report. Wilson did not have any weapons on him. He said the revolver was in his car. The revolver was found by another deputy on scene, as well as marijuana.
After questioning, Wilson was uncooperative of the 
whereabouts of the cat and said, “Just take me to jail.”
Deputies booked Wilson in the Alachua County Jail on 
Monday around 12 a.m. As of press time, his bond is set at $10,000.Police say man shot at cat with revolverSEE LOAN, PAGE 4Cap at 10 percent of income

TALLAHASSEE — Under a new law, 
abortions will be illegal in Florida at any 
point in a woman’s pregnancy if her doctor determines that the fetus could survive out-side the womb.
Gov. Rick Scott signed a bill on Friday that 
redeﬁ  nes the state’s current third-trimester abortion ban.
Current law prohibits abortions after 24 
weeks of pregnancy unless the mother’s life is at risk. The new law will require women to have a doctor determine whether a fetus is viable before having an abortion. It also re-moves the exception of psychological trouble as an exception.
The law takes effect July 1. It keeps an ex-ception if a mother’s life is at risk or to pre-
vent irreversible physical impairment of a 
mother’s major bodily function.
The measure passed the House 70 to 45 
and the Senate 24 to 15.
Democrats opposed the legislation 
throughout the committee process and dur-ing the 2014 session. Rep. Michelle Rehwin-kel Vasilinda, D-Tallahassee, is worried that doctors could be open to criminal prosecu-
tion and said different physicians can have 
different determinations.
“It is commonplace for people to get sec-
ond and third opinions sometimes when they’re dealing with something very impor-tant,” Rehwinkel Vasilinda said. “And we know that physicians do have differences of opinion.”Gov Scott signs Florida bill limiting late-term abortionsSTATEHANNAH FELL

New research may have re-
vealed the origin of the pathogen 
that caused the Irish Potato Famine of the 1840s, and a UF researcher was a part of research team. 
The disease, called late blight, 
continues to damage $6 billion worth of tomato farmers’ crops annually.
The research reevaluated a 
2007 study about the pathogen that pinpointed the source of the disease as South America, said 
the UF Institute of Food and Agri-
cultural Sciences researcher Erica Goss.
However, the pathogen actu-ally originated from Mexico, Goss said.
The researchers started by 
gathering isolates, which are in-dividual plant cells, from differ-ent potato and tomato plants and 
culturing those isolates in a lab. 
By studying the DNA sequence of the isolates, the researchers were able to determine the cause of the disease.
By looking at the oldest DNA 
strands from isolates, scientists can track down the source of the disease more easily because they can see what it looked like origi-
nally. 
The difﬁ  cult part about this dis-
ease is that late blight changes in 
form from year to year, she said.  All the scientists can do is 
hope that if the disease comes, the chemicals will outperform the dis-ease, said Gene McAvoy, Hendry County extension director.
“A lot of people don’t real-
ize how difﬁ  cult it is to produce food,” he said. “It takes a lot of people to continue to make that happen.”

In order to get ahead of a looming problem, Gainesville city commission-
ers voted on an option to educate students about AIDS. They had the idea to include AIDS informational brochures inside electric bills, which they esti-mated would reach about 50,000 people. “OK, so only 5 percent read it, but 
that would be 5 percent that would have that information,” said Phyllis Meek, 
UF associate dean of Student Affairs. The county health department said the number of AIDS patients was doubling every year in Alachua County. So what started at 12 affected in 1981 would likely become 176 by 1991.
June 20, 2002A UF student uploaded notes but didn’t realize he was downloading trou-
ble as well. When Ian Peterson was desperate for money to go see Jimmy Buffett in concert, he decided to request donations on his website. He had 
uploaded notes he made for several large classes such as macroeconomics 
and marketing, which he said other students shaped their own class sched-ules around. The university said Peterson’s use of the university Web space is for commercial purposes, which violated student conduct and the terms and conditions of a UF domain.

Casual golf fans are more likely 
to play on Gainesville golf courses 
when Tiger Woods plays well in a tournament, local golf course work-ers said. 
These fans become inspired to 
go out and play a round, and golf courses like West End Golf Club in Newberry have noticed a difference when Woods isn’t swinging for the green. When Woods isn’t playing, some courses don’t see as much busi-ness. Woods has missed the last two major tournaments — one of which was the U.S. Open, which took place 
over the weekend — after back sur-
gery and is in danger of missing the remaining two this year. 
Peter Min, the owner of West 
End Golf Club, said when Woods plays well in a tournament, the club sees a large increase in sales the fol-lowing week. Despite the multitude of professional golfers, Woods is the only one who generates a signiﬁ  cant difference. 
“It’s strange that it’s just him,” 
Min said. “Everyone likes him or hates him, but everyone tunes in to 
watch him.”
Teddy Lausier, a pro shop as-
sistant at Meadowbrook Golf Club, 
said he only sees a small increase in business when Woods plays well. This is largely because most of the club’s members are avid golfers, not casual fans, he said.
However, he said a large amount 
of golfers come into the lobby to watch the tournament on the club’s television, especially on Sundays, which helps concession sales.
Tyler Den, a 17-year-old golfer 
who plays on the Buchholz High School golf team, said Tiger Woods is his favorite professional golfer. When Woods plays well, he said he gets inspired to go play a round.
Although Woods’ return would 
liven business, Min said a group of young stars would be more relatable to younger golfers. They would also be good for long-term business. 
“Kids are interested in a guy like 
Rickie Fowler, but he doesn’t ﬁ  nish very high that much,” Min said.
Fowler, a 25-year-old golfer, tied 
for second place in the U.S. Open on Sunday, which was his career best in a major tournament. But until some-one like him emerges as golf’s next star, Gainesville course workers said they are hoping to see Woods back in action as soon as possible.

Gainesville residents and students can take 
baby steps into the world of 3-D printing with a new course a local technology company is launching on Thursday.  
Florida Tech Toybox Inc. and Santa Fe Col-
lege Continuing Education are offering a new course titled “Introduction to 3-D Printing,” which will introduce students to the basics of design software and how to create a 3-D piece for printing, said Mark Davidson, president and founder of Florida Tech Toybox Inc. 
He said one of the goals of the class is to 
“lower the fear barrier” some people experi-ence when learning new technology. 
The class will be held at the Santa Fe Col-
lege’s Center for Innovation and Economic 
Development, located across the street from The Continuum apartments, and the course 
will cost $175. Registration is currently open, but space is limited to 16 people. The course 
is four weeks long and meets once a week for 
two hours. 
Janalyn Peppel, owner of Powder Coating of Gainesville, who helped organize a series of workshops on Tuesday regarding 3-D print-ing, said when she discusses 3-D printing with people in the community, they often don’t un-derstand the process or the possibilities.

bill is irresponsible, 
regressive
On Friday, Gov. Rick Scott passed HB 1047, which stipu-
lates that pregnancies may not at any time be termi-nated in the state of Florida if doctors determine that 
the fetus could survive outside the womb.
The Tampa Bay Times reported that the law takes effect 
on July 1. And though it maintains that a pregnancy may be ended at any time if “a mother’s life is at risk or to prevent irreversible physical impairment of a mother’s major bodily function,” the Alligator ﬁ  nds this new law appalling in its re-gression.
This editorial board has unique stakes in HB 1047. For one, 
the board is currently 75 percent female (though this arguably shouldn’t make a difference). The second stake is in the fact that the Alligator has held controversial views on abortion be-
fore.
Now, for a lesson in UF history that must be rehashed ev-
ery few years: The Independent Florida Alligator wasn’t al-
ways independent. 
In 1971, when Stephen C. O’Connell was president, and the 
Alligator operated under a department called the Ofﬁ  ce of Stu-dent Publications, former editor Ron Sachs approved an insert to run in the paper listing the addresses of known abortion clinics in the area. Because both abortions and printing infor-
mation about where to get an abortion were illegal at the time, 
this was a risky move. It ultimately resulted in the Alligator seceding from the university after then-Florida Attorney Gen-eral Robert Shevin ruled that a split from UF and the Alligator was necessary to protect students’ First Amendment rights.
We’ve come a long way from the 1970s, in some respects. 
Our right to free speech and a free press is safe from govern-ment regulation, yet women’s bodies, amazingly, still aren’t.
Which is why the Alligator must take a hard stance on HB 
1047: It’s a violation of health and privacy.
It’s not the government’s place to determine what wom-
en do with their bodies, especially when it comes to the life-changing matter of childbirth. As Dr. Vanessa Cullins, the vice president for external medical affairs at Planned Parenthood Federation of American put it, “The decisions about pregnan-cy are private, personal decisions, and politicians don’t belong in the midst of those decisions. It’s none of the politicians’ business.”
The passage of this intrusive bill, with its room for interpre-
tation and the removal of “emotional health” as a reason to ter-minate a pregnancy, is a blow to Florida women. Furthermore, politics have no place in a sensitive area that concerns what Florida Rep. Hazelle Rogers said is between “me, my doctor, and my god.”
Removing access to abortion won’t make abortion go away. 
Furthermore, prohibiting women from undergoing a common and safe medical procedure is invasive and the mark of a re-
gressive culture that does not value a woman’s right to choose 
what to do with her body.

Vote or post a message at www.alligator.orgFriday’s question: Have you ever used 
the withdrawal method? Today’s question: Are you worried about paying off your 
student loans?Cantor’s loss leaves conservatives divided
A house divided cannot stand. If this is true, why 
should a homeowner, in order to strengthen his or her house’s foundation, rip out its beams, ﬂ  oorings 
and piers? 
This is what is currently happening in the Republican 
Party: The mainstream, big-business oriented wing of the party is being engaged in a contentious ﬁ  ght with the ideo-logically pure Tea Party wing.   
Last week’s primary election in Virginia only made this 
divide more evident. Republican House Majority Leader Eric Cantor was defeated by a little-known college profes-sor and political newcomer, David Brat. The most frustrat-ing aspect of this election is that there was no need for Can-tor’s defeat. Brat painted the majority leader as a moderate, 
amnesty-supporting deal maker who is soft on his conser-
vatism. But Brat’s characterizations are completely baseless: Cantor is a rock- solid conservative. He is strong on guns. He led the House to repeal Obamacare more than 50 times. He is against big government and a proponent of the business community. 
This begs the question: Why did the people of Virginia’s 
solid-red 7th Congressional District think the answer to their political problems was electing a more conservative Repub-
lican? Ask yourself this: Who would have more of an impact 
on the future of the Republican Party? Would it be Cantor, who, prior to his ousting, was in the process of rebranding the conservative movement, or Brat, the evangelical, history-whitewashing economics professor? Hands down, the win-ner is easily Cantor. 
What some are calling the reason for Cantor’s defeat is 
his position on immigration reform. He did concern him-self with the future of the children of illegally immigrated 
people. In effect, Cantor was discovering that a proportion of 
people residing in our country are here without proper docu-mentation. They have no reason and probably no hesitancy to leave the country. They broke the law, no doubt, but one must capitulate to the realities of the day.  
The solution is not Mitt Romney’s “self-deportation” — 
which is laughably unrealistic. Cantor’s proposal of making sure the children of these immigrants have access to oppor-tunities and the ability to contrib-ute back to their adopted country is both a classically conservative position and completely feasible, provided that the border between 
Mexico and the U.S. is bolstered. 
Brat, on the contrary, has no 
other answer to this immigration 
problem other than that “they shouldn’t be here in the ﬁ  rst place.” 
He, like other members of the far-right caucus, embodies the stereotypical conservative politician: the Bible-thumpin’, Constitution-totin’ and free-market-supportin’ man.
Upon news of his victory, Brat told Fox News’ Sean Han-
nity that “God gave us this win,” and the Almighty “acted through the people on my behalf.” Staying true to form, Brat then invoked the infallible Founding Fathers, claimed that America has no free markets and advocated for overall gov-ernment nihilism. And to keep the cliches rolling, the name of former President Ronald Reagan popped up during the interview. For some reason, the modern Republican Party cannot get enough of quoting and beautifying the 40th presi-dent. The part that most upsets me is that the right falls in 
love with Reagan’s campaign bravado and completely for-
gets his governing record. Reagan proved to be more ideo-logically ﬂ  exible when it came to running the country than many on the right would like you to believe. Also, if I may, Reagan famously said, “My 80-percent friend is not my 20-percent enemy.”
If that is the case, and Republicans being the typical Rea-
gan name-droppers, why are so many reliable, mainstream, solid-red conservatives being primaried so wantonly?   
This recent development is sad because the center-right 
political point of view is worthy of consideration. But when this disposition becomes perverted by a select few politi-cians, it loses its appeal. In the aftermath of Brat’s victory, the conservative movement’s future seems to be unfortunately stuck in the past.

When you tell someone you 
write about sex, you can ex-pect a few standard respons-
es: What do your parents think? You 
should write about me. Why sex?
The last one is the most interesting 
to me because it’s the most important.
That’s precisely why I write about 
sex — because it’s important. Sex is the cornerstone of our society. It’s literally 
how we are made.
But if it’s so important, why is it so hard to 
talk about?
Sure, we talk about sex. Your bros pat you 
on the back when you tell them you got laid last night. Over drinks, your girlfriends laugh with 
you about the latest and most ridiculous Cosmo-politan “How to please your man in bed” article. You ask your partner what his or her kinks and 
fantasies are.
But it’s never a real discussion. We have more 
in-depth debates about foreign policy, gun con-
trol and religion than we do about sex.
News headlines and family dinner conversa-
tions cover things like the latest celebrity hap-
penings, sports games and how you’ve been do-
ing in your ﬁ  nancial accounting class.
But when was the last time you spoke to 
your parents (or friends and colleagues, for that 
matter) about the effect of technology on sex or 
about getting tested for sexually transmitted in-
fections?
Despite the fact that most people will have sex 
at least once in their lifetime, it’s still not consid-ered to be an appropriate discussion topic, both in verbal conversations and in printed works.
Arielle Pardes, who wrote a sex column for 
The Daily Pennsylvanian, said in an article about sex journalism “For something as almost mun-dane as sex, there’s so much outrage, and people are so personally inﬂ  amed and offended that you would want to talk about it.” 
That’s the kicker.Sex is as common as doing the dishes, al-
though the former can be admittedly more frequent than the latter in college, but it’s still frowned upon to actually talk about it.  
Of course, there are a few reasons for this. Sex 
and sexuality are generally viewed as private matters that are only discussed behind closed doors.It’s difﬁ  cult for us to make 
those private matters public.
Sex is different for every 
person. What I constitute as 
sex may not apply to someone 
else. Thus, a column that I write 
about sex might not be applica-ble to every person or couple.
At the root of it, though, sex 
is no different than any other 
controversial issue.
I was met with criticism after my last column, 
which detailed the beneﬁ  ts and drawbacks to the pull-out method of contraception. But would the 
crowd reaction have been any kinder if I wrote 
about how religion is a hoax or how we should 
make guns more easily attainable?
Probably not.See, the issue here isn’t really sex. It’s us.
It’s hard for us to accept an opinion that is dif-
ferent from our own.
This can range from a classmate’s ideas on 
religion versus evolution to your best friend’s 
stance on whether he or she liked Harry Potter.
Disagreements are uncomfortable, frustrat-
ing and occasionally pointless. But they’re also how we grow and learn. It’s important for us to put aside our differences so that we can have productive, meaningful conversations — even if 
it’s not always the easiest thing to do.
Just because you personally do not agree with 
a concept does not mean that somebody else 
doesn’t. If I write an article about lesbian sex, it doesn’t mean that everybody has to have lesbian sex — although, can you imagine? It just means that someone out there is having that form of sex, so we should talk about it.
In the same article about sex journalism, blog-
ger Lena Chen said that the purpose of a writer’s platform is to start a conversation.
So let’s do that.I’m not saying you have to start raising your 
hand in class and asking, “Hey, before you go over the mechanics of a sodium potassium pump, can we discuss how I got laid last night?”
But if you get anything out of this, it should 
be that it’s ok to talk about sex.
I, for one, would love to hear what you have 
to say.

opinions@alligator.orgWhen my par-
ents ﬁ  rst came to America in 
the mid-1950s, higher education was an option rather than a necessity. By the time I attended the University of Florida in the early 1990s, times had changed and a col-lege degree was vital to securing a well-paying job.
Since then, advanced education 
and skills have become even more es-sential in the job market, even though college costs have soared.
Those who have a chance to at-
tend college often have to go into debt, as I did for undergrad and law school. While I was eventually able to pay off more than $100,000 in student loan debt, too many learn the hard 
way that a degree alone is sometimes 
not enough. It has to be the right de-
gree, at the right price, from the right institution. Otherwise, they’ll accrue student loan debt that their chosen 
careers won’t allow them to pay off 
in a reasonable fashion. 
Last week, the U.S. Senate debated 
the issue of student loan debt. Unfor-
tunately, the debate missed an oppor-tunity to examine the fundamental reforms our entire higher education system needs, including new ways to help people ﬁ  nance their educations.
For example, I believe students 
who attend traditional colleges and universities should have better infor-mation about what kinds of jobs and earning potential they can anticipate by graduating in their chosen major. In partnership with a Democrat col-league, I’ve introduced legislation that would do this.
Of course, this information alone 
is not enough. That’s why I’m work-ing with another Democrat colleague on legislation based on the concept of income-based repayment, 
which bases graduates’ 
loan payments on how much they earn. In other words, someone who lands a high-paying job would pay a higher percentage of their loan 
each year than someone who works for minimum wage. Meanwhile, someone who can’t ﬁ  nd a job at all would pay nothing until they gain employment.
But we also need to ensure that 
those who can’t attend traditional universities still have a chance to at-tain advanced learning and skills. That’s why I’ve proposed establish-ing a new, independent accrediting entity geared toward affordable and 
accessible providers of postsecond-
ary education. While traditional uni-
versities will still play a major role in our higher education system, no longer will they be able to block out 
cheaper, innovative and more acces-
sible competitors. This competition 
will beneﬁ  t our entire system while giving working parents a chance to make use of the online tools and ﬂ  ex-ible education options that are grow-ing in abundance.
Although the Senate missed an op-
portunity last week to advance these kinds of ideas, I know the future of our people relies on rethinking and reforming the way people acquire and ﬁ  nance higher education. In the coming months, I’m hopeful we’ll get another chance to actually deliver some results and help more people achieve their American dream by making higher education more ac-cessible — without being crushed by student loan debt.

The average college gradu-
ate faces high unemployment 
numbers, but for recent black college alumni, those num-bers are worse. 
A May study from the Cen-
ter for Economic and Policy Research analyzed labor-mar-ket activity in 2013 and found black college alumni faced an unemployment rate of 12.4 percent, more than twice as high as all other races com-bined. 
Statistics like these show 
the prevalence of racial dis-crimination in the workplace, said Nicholas Carre, a 20-year-old UF political science junior and the treasurer of UF’s Black Student Union.
“It’s deﬁ  nitely not the Jim 
Crow we see today where it’s completely blatant,” he said. “Equal opportunity in the workplace isn’t necessarily 
one of those things that has 
completely evolved.”
According to UF Multicul-
tural and Diversity Affairs, as of 2013, 6.63 percent of the Student Body is black. But universities don’t mimic the corporate world, said Luisa Amelia Dempere, chair of the 
President’s Council on Diver-
sity at UF.
“There is a general lack of 
awareness and a lack of em-bracing diversity,” She said. “If certain companies gave more value to that, we’d prob-ably see different numbers.”Study: Black alumni 
may ﬁ  nd less workRESEARCH

A recently awarded grant is 
set to help Alachua county resi-
dents stamp out smoking.
UF was awarded $1.6 million 
by the Florida Department of 
Health to create a tobacco cessa-
tion program to battle tobacco-in-duced cancer and cardiovascular disease.
This program is part of a state-
wide network called OneFlorida developed by the UF Clinical and Translational Science Institute.
The network includes UF and 
Florida State University and is currently expanding to include the University of Miami.
The smoking rate is 14 percent 
in Alachua County and 8 percent at UF, according to Tobacco Free Alachua health policy specialist Andrew Romero.
Romero said one of its biggest 
pushes over the next couple years will be apartment complexes and bars.
“Downtown has a lot of bars that are voluntarily smoke-free 
and provide a safe environment 
for their patrons,” Romero said. “Our goal is to reach out to bars in Midtown and apartment com-plexes and let them know that being smoke-free will not affect them ﬁ  nancially, regardless of what a tobacco company may tell them.”
Clubs and bars downtown 
such as Tall Paul’s Brew House, The Atlantic, 2nd Street Speak-easy and now Stubbies and Steins are all smoke-free businesses.      The Swamp Restaurant on Uni-versity Avenue was the ﬁ  rst Mid-town bar to ban smoking inside, he said.
This project, funded by the De-
partment of Health’s James and Esther King Biomedical Research Program, will help combat the 28,600 annual deaths that come from cigarette use in Florida, ac-cording to the press release.
Kathy Nichols, co-chair of the 
UF Tobacco-Free Task Force, said 
tobacco is the No. 1 preventable cause of death and disease in the nation and the world.
“We offer individual coun-
seling for students interested in 
quitting and can provide up to four weeks of nicotine replace-ment therapy and counseling 
treatment for free,” She said. 
The grant will fund three re-
searchers per year from either 
Florida A&M University or Ed-
ward Waters College to help mi-
nority populations, according to the press release.
Claire Baralt, UF Clinical and 
Translational Science Institute communications director, said the grant’s purpose is to put the 
tobacco cessation program in 
doctors’ ofﬁ  ces to implement strategies to help their patients stop smoking.
“The long term goal is put 
our research to use with a com-bination of screening, counsel-ing, referrals and resources that can help patients quickly,” Baralt 
said. “We need to improve the 
health of Floridians.”

The men’s track and field team fell 
just short of earning its third straight 
national outdoor championship after 
finishing in second to Oregon.
When the NCAA Championships 
ended Saturday, the Ducks finished the 
competition with 88 points compared 
to the Gators’ 70.
On the women’s side, Florida fin-
ished fourth overall (55 points) behind 
eventual national champion Texas A&M (75), Texas (66) and Oregon (59).
However, each team still earned in-
dividual titles over the weekend. The men finished first in the long jump, tri-ple jump, 200m sprint and 4x100 relay.The women earned a national title 
in the javelin competition behind Fawn Miller’s performance (58.13m/190-8).
“We just got beat by a better team 
and same thing as far as the overall team standings,” coach Mike Holloway said. “We scored 70 points, we just got beat by a phenomenal Oregon team 
and we’ll be back to fight them again 
next year.”
The Oregon track squad was the 
unit that ended a potential three-peat for the men during outdoor competi-
tion, and repeated as indoor and out-
door national champions.
Oregon is the program that will stand 
in Florida’s way for years to come. The 
Ducks had more qualifiers in specific 
events that the Gators didn’t and that hurt UF because Oregon would gain more points expanding the deficit.
Florida has multiple Southeastern 
Conference and national individual 
champions in both the indoor and out-
door seasons with the men and wom-en.
The women’s team has steadily in-
creased its ability to be a contender in not just running events, but on the field too.
Throughout their 2014 campaign the 
nation witnessed a top-ranked team on 
both sides many times.
Although rankings don’t matter at 
the end of the day and from the words 
of Holloway, the only ranking that mat-
ters is the one at the end of the season.

Florida flipped a 2016 recruit from in-state 
rival Miami over the weekend. 2016 defen-
sive back Chauncey “CJ” Gardner (5-foot-11, 
190 pounds, Cocoa Beach, Fla., Cocoa High) 
switched his commitment to UF on Saturday afternoon. Gardner attended Saturday’s ses-sion of Will Muschamp’s football camp and was offered a scholarship by coaches while 
he was still on campus.
“I Would Like To Thank Miami For All The 
Opportunities They Presented To Me But I’m 
Taking My Talents To Gainesville  #CHOMP 
#GoGators,” Gardner posted from his Twitter 
account (@StillDat_) on Saturday evening.
Gardner had been verbally committed to Miami since last 
summer following his freshman sea-son at Cocoa High 
School. With Gardner’s decommitment, the Canes are left with just one verbal commit-ment for their 2016 class — running back Mark Walton out of Booker T. Washington High School.
During his sophomore season, Gardner 
averaged just about three tackles for loss per game, snatched five interceptions and added a blocked punt that forced a safety. He doesn’t show much speed on tape, but he has very good instincts for a young safety that can make up for his lackluster wheels. Gard-
ner has the ability to play cornerback as well.
He plays on the offensive side of the ball 
at Cocoa High as well. In 2013, he averaged 
16 yards per reception and carried the ball 16 times for 92 yards.
As far as depth is concerned, UF is loaded 
within the defensive back position group. Defensive back recruit flips commitment from Miami to UFLAYNE WEITZEL

Get ready to welcome a new coach to the Univer-
sity of Florida campus.
UF athletics director Jeremy Foley named J.C. 
Deacon as the 15th men’s golf coach in program his-
tory on Saturday. Deacon, 31, will succeed Buddy Alexander, who announced his retirement in April 
after 27 seasons with the Gators.
Deacon previously spent four seasons as an as-
sistant coach at his alma mater University of Ne-
vada, Las Vegas. The Rebels finished the 2013-2014 season ranked 30th in the nation and made an ap-
pearance at the NCAA Sugar Grove Regional in Il-
linois.
Foley admited that he did not know a lot about 
Deacon initially but was impressed by his inter-
view, which helped him land the job.
“It is readily evident that he wants — and has a 
plan — to make the players successful in the class-
room, on the course and in life,” Foley said in a re-lease from the school. “He will do things the right way because with his character and tremendous in-tegrity, he knows no other way. J.C. will fit right in among our coaching staff, and we welcome him to the Gator program.”
In addition to coaching, Deacon has enjoyed 
success playing as an amateur and professionally. He competed for UNLV from 2001 to 2005, help-Men’s golf

WORLD CUP
ASSOCIATED PRESS
NATAL, Brazil -- After 90 bru-
tal minutes of end-to-end action, 
the Americans emerged with a 
thrilling 2-1 win over Ghana.
“It was a grind, but it was a 
wonderful win at the end of the day,” coach Jurgen Klinsmann 
said.
U.S. fans were screaming for re-
venge Monday after the Black Stars eliminated the Americans from the last two Cups.
They got it. At a price.
Clint Dempsey scored a shock-
ing goal a half-minute in, but the U.S. couldn’t make it stand up. 
Andre Ayew tied the score in the 
82nd minute after a brilliant back-
heel pass from Asamoah Gyan, 
who had eliminated the U.S. four years ago.
And then, just four minutes lat-
er, 21-year-old John Brooks rose to head in Graham Zusi’s corner kick from 8 yards - the ﬁ  rst substitute to ever score for the United States in 30 World Cup games over 84 years. The defender, an unexpect-
ed addition to the American roster, was so overcome he fell to the ﬁ  eld and was unable to move even af-
ter teammates climbed off the dog pile. He had made his national 
team debut only last August, and 
Brooks hadn’t scored in four ap-
pearances.
U.S. players ran onto the ﬁ  eld to 
celebrate at the ﬁ  nal whistle, jump-
ing as supporters chanted “U-S-A! U-S-A!” Now the Americans are in 
good position in Group G, where Germany opened with a 4-0 rout of 
Cristiano Ronaldo and Portugal.
“We got the three points that we 
badly wanted,” Klinsmann said.
He had predicted this would be 
like a ﬁ  nal. Jozy Altidore was hop-ing it wasn’t his ﬁ  nale.
The forward was carried off on 
a stretcher after his left hamstring 
gave out in the 21st minute when 
he tried to control a long ball. He awaits tests that will determine 
whether he can return for this 
World Cup.Dempsey went down too on 
a balmy late-autumn night but 
stayed in the game. The U.S. cap-tain ended the ﬁ  rst half with a tis-sue up his nose to stop the bleed-
ing after John Boye’s kick to his face during a battle for a header in 
the 31st minute, and he was strug-
gling for breath in the second.
The Americans “showed a lot of 
heart, a lot of character,” Dempsey 
said.
Tim Howard made big save af-
ter big save as Ghana outshot the U.S. 21-8.
Matt Besler came out at the 
start of the second half after feeling 
tightness in his right hamstring. It was his replacement, Brooks, who 
scored the winning goal. Zusi was also a sub, coming on for the hob-
bling Alejandro Bedoya in the sec-ond half.
By the time of the ﬁ  nal whistle, 
the U.S. lineup had Brooks in cen-tral defense and a virtually invis-ible 23-year-old Aron Johannsson 
at forward.
Now the odds favor advance-ment. But that might depend on 
which players are able to make 
it on the ﬁ  eld for Sunday’s game against Portugal in the hot and hu-
mid Amazon rain forest capital of 
Manaus.
United States records thrilling 2-1 victory in opening game

United States’ Matt Besler, right, slides under Ghana’s Jordan Ayew 
during the U.S.’ 2-1 victory against Ghana in Natal, Brazil on Monday.
Specifically at the safety position, 
Florida already has a verbal com-mit for 2015 in Deontai Williams (6-foot-1, 185 pounds, Jacksonville, Fla., Trinity Christian Academy). Incoming freshman Quincy Wilson 
has the skillset to play at either cor-nerback or safety, and sophomore 
Nick Washington repped at the safety position throughout spring football but can play cornerback if 
needed.
Wilson’s position should be so-
lidified during fall camp this Au-
gust, but UF could see a similar situation as Jaylen Watkins, who 
played safety and corner through-
out his career at UF. 
The other two options at safe-
ty are Marcus Maye and Keanu 
Neal—who will both be seniors in 
2016, creating some potential start-ing opportunities for Gardner com-ing in.
Gardner is the third verbal 
commitment for the 2016 recruit-ing class. He joins wide receiver Tyler Byrd (5-foot-11, 160 pounds, Naples, Fla., Naples High) and cor-
nerback Tre Jackson (5-foot-8, 164 
pounds, Baton Rouge, La., Univer-sity Laboratory School).  Byrd has 
been committed since last June, and Jackson announced his verbal com-
mitment last July.
The Will Muschamp football 
camps will continue until Wednes-
day, wrapping up with both the “Jr. 
Gator” camp for kids in Grades 2-8 
and the last session of high school skill camp. The camps have proven to be an effective recruiting tool, as UF has now picked up two verbal 
commitments — one for each of the 
2015 and 2016 classes.ing the Rebels to a Mountain 
West Championship in 2002 
and NCAA Championship appearances in 2002 and 2003. As a professional, he won the Emerald Hills Classic and Miami Shores Shootout titles in 2007, played the Canadian Tour from 2007 to 2010 and tied for fourth in the 2008 Sas-katchewan Open.
He hasn’t been back in 
a while, but Deacon is no stranger to Florida. The To-ronto native transferred from high school in Canada to at-tend St. Stephen’s Episcopal School and IMG Academy in Bradenton. 
He aspired to play colle-
giate golf for Alexander.
Instead, he’ll be stepping 
into Alexander’s shoes at the new leader of the UF pro-gram.
“I was thrilled when Jere-
my first told me,” Deacon said in a release. “I immediately started mentally reviewing those lists I had developed if this opportunity was present-ed. I want to start that vision I have for this program.”
Deacon has never taken 
the reins of his own program before, but that didn’t deter Foley, who also hired Kevin O’Sullivan, Will Muschamp, Emily Glaser, Rhonda Faehn, Mike Holloway and Mary 
Wise. 
They all lacked head coach-
ing experience but have now 
combined for 32 Southeastern Conference titles and seven 
NCAA championships.
The newest member of the 
college-wide coaching staff is 
not fazed by the expectations set for him. Rather, he’s ex-cited and ready for what’s to come.
“I am looking forward to 
becoming part of something I truly believe in,” Deacon said. “I’ve been a big fan of the Flor-ida program for a long time... I just know there are a serious amount of championships to be won at Florida. I have that platform now, and it is up to me to go out and do the hard work to get it done.”TUESDAY, JUNE 17, 2014 � ALLIGATOR, 15

“Some things didn’t go our way, but we 
can’t talk about that. What we have to talk 
about is we’re on this — we were third in-
doors, fourth (women) outdoors,” Holloway 
said.
“Now we have to be a trophy team every 
year. That has to be our goal, to come in here 
and be a part of the conversation about being 
a national championship team and I think we’re headed in the right direction.”
The women’s team is up and rising and 
the men will only lose two seniors who have stamped their name on the track and field 
program at Florida.
The team will lose Cory McGee who has 
won numerous awards as a Gator through-
out her four-year career and Ebony Eutsey who meant a lot to the team’s sprinting unit.
The void to fill on the men’s side would 
be Eddie Lovett, who is the only athlete to four-peat in the 60-meter hurdles in the SEC, and Sean Obinwa who was a skilled mentor to the 800-meter crew, which has much tal-ent moving ahead.
With senior leaders 
leaving their legacy at Florida, the team certainly still has plenty of talent.
The men’s squad still has arguably their 
best jumper when his time at Florida is done 
in Marquis Dendy, who was the first since 
2002 to be a double national champion in the long jump and triple jump.If not best in the nation one of the best 4x4 
relay squads in Najee Glass, Hugh Graham Jr., Dedric Dukes and Arman Hall.
That relay squad at one point in the sea-
son at Florida Relays held the world-leading time in the 4x4, and Dedric Dukes owned the 200-meter run with the world-leading time as well.
“I’m very proud of my group, very proud 
of what they accomplished all year long,” Holloway said. “I’m excited about getting back to work.”

against the San Antonio Spurs, which leaves 
Miami with a 2-2 record in the Finals over the 
past four seasons. LeBron James now has the opportunity to leave town to pursue greener pastures after earning two rings in South Beach while Dwyane Wade and Chris Bosh attempt to recover from an ugly championship series. To-day, alligatorSports editor Jonathan Czupryn 
and assistant editor Richard Johnson debate 
what will become of the Heat going into the off-
season.
Richard: “Hello, team X, Pat Riley here. I 
have an aging superstar that’s the weak link 
in my chain of star players and I would like 
to receive parts in exchange for him. Would 
you be willing to talk?” 
Riley has to have that conversation with 
every other NBA team this summer because 
he has got to get rid of Dwyane Wade. 
It will hurt all parties involved. The city 
that has loved him so dearly will hurt. Wade 
will hurt because, as any athlete would be, he’s still supremely conﬁ  dent in his ability. 
It will also hurt the team. The Heat drafted 
him and they have ridden him as the face of 
the franchise, but now it’s time to dismount if at all possible. 
I believe you can build around the best 
player on the planet (LeBron James) and the 
real unsung hero of the “Big Three” (Chris 
Bosh). Head coach Erik Spoelstra has done all that he can do, but Wade is holding this team back if you’re looking long term. 
They’ve paced his minutes and even held 
him out of games during the season so that 
he could be fresh for the ﬁ  nals. 
And you saw his potential at times 
throughout the playoffs, but the two wet 
farts that ended the season loom large for 
me. 
If the Heat keep Wade around for senti-
mental reasons, they risk staying burdened 
with nearly a $42 million cap hit over the 
next two years — assuming he re-ups this 
offseason — that is giving them diminishing 
returns at an increasing rate even though he’s the team’s favorite son. I know this sce-nario all too well. I’m a Lakers fan.
Jonathan: Listen, I know emotions are 
running high for Heat fans after an embar-rassment of a series they had against the Spurs, but let’s not be rash. 
Dwyane Wade averaged 19 points per game this season 
on 54.5 percent 
shooting. No I’m 
not kidding. The “aging” 32-year-old superstar re-corded a career-high shooting clip this year. I’m 
not seeing the 
decline here. Of course I know Flash had 
an abysmal championship series, but it wasn’t because of his health or because he has mentally checked out of the game. He 
went head-to-head against one of the best 
all-around teams we have seen in the NBA 
in years. Cut the guy a little slack.
It’s not like he didn’t perform in the rest 
of the postseason either. In the Eastern Con-
ference Finals against the Indiana Pacers, 
Wade scored nearly 20 points a game while 
matching his regular season shooting per-centage of 54.5. 
If you’re worried about his age creeping 
up to him, don’t be. Everyone is praising 
Tony Parker, Tim Duncan and Manu Gi-
nobili for their performances throughout this postseason, and every member of that “Big Three” is at least 32-years-old. It’s pos-sible to play in this 
league later in age 
now with today’s 
advances in physi-cal therapy and the fact that defense in the NBA is at an all-time low.
If Heat fans 
should be worried 
about anyone, it should be LeBron James.
Richard: If you want to be worried about 
the best player on the planet, be my guest. He wasn’t the one standing around passive 
in the corner as the Spurs beat his team like 
Kevin Durant did. He didn’t wilt in the face 
of his team getting whipped in the ﬁ  nals either, leading the Heat in points, assists and rebounds per game. He’s carrying the 
team, he will continue to carry the team but 
he needs more well rounded help. The “Big 
Three” experiment won two titles and went to four championship series, but James has been to the ﬁ  nals with Mo Williams and 
Zydrunas Ilgauskas. He can carry a squad 
with Bosh as his running mate. 
My concern for Miami is the fact that it 
struggles with size, get rid of Wade, bank-
ing on the assumption that Chris Anderson won’t exercise his Early Termination Option 
and grab free agent Marcin Gortat as a twin-
towers punch with Bosh on the frontline. 
In Wade’s absence in the backcourt, you 
can bring back Ray Allen — hopefully at a 
discounted rate. And through free agency, plug in either Thabo Sefolosha, whose de-fense is an upgrade over Wade’s, or Jodie Meeks, whose outside shooting is better 
than Wade’s. In theory, Meeks can stretch 
defenses to create driving lanes for LeBron 
and be a nice added perimeter threat to go with Bosh. If Miami could nab both Sefa-losha and Meeks, those moves in conjunc-
tion with whatever they could get back for 
Wade in a trade would be much-needed 
talented depth.
Jonathan: Trust me, in no way am I say-
ing for Heat fans to worry about James’ per-
formance on the ﬂ  oor. 
I’m saying everyone in South Florida 
should be bartering their souls right now 
in order to keep him there until he walks away from the game. Do what you need to 
do with Wade, Allen and the rest, but make 
sure you lock up James for the long haul.
Do I think the Heat can do that? No. 
And that’s what should be scaring Riley, 
Spoelstra and the rest of the lucky individu-
als beneﬁ  tting from the King.
Right now, Miami is competing with 
New York, Los Angeles, Cleveland and 
every other market with buku bucks to spend. How is every Heat fan not dying of 
anticipation right now? The dude brought 
your team four Eastern Conference titles 
and two straight NBA championships. That just doesn’t happen. Any other transactions should take a back seat to LeBron. Once 
you lock him up for the next 100 years, then 
start cutting and signing other players willy 
nilly.
Richard: Personally, I think way too 
much is being made about LeBron being on 
the move. It’s an artiﬁ  cial storyline so ESPN, 
CBS and the two of us have something 
to talk about in the dog days of summer. Somebody’s sources said LeBron may pos-sibly  want to not be elsewhere next season 
and we now have speculation for months. 
He’s not going anywhere in my opinion, 
but if you’re worried about him doing so, reloading with a more well rounded and deeper roster is the way to do so.16, ALLIGATOR � TUESDAY, JUNE 17, 2014
