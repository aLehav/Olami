  A water main break occurred at Santa Fe College on Thursday morning between buildings P and R, affecting water usage 
throughout the campus. As a result, the oak grove at the center of the campus was blocked off, forcing students to walk the perimeter of the grounds. The break was ﬁ  xed within hours, and the campus returned to its regular schedule.

  Student Body President Ben Mey-
ers announced Thursday that he will 
be resigning from his position due to personal reasons.
  Student Body Vice President An-
thony Reynolds will be taking his place as the executive leader of Stu-
dent Government.
  “It was not an 
easy decision to make, especially considering I’d worked hard for the job for a very, very long time,” Meyers said. “It’s been an 
extremely rewarding experience and the honor of my lifetime.”
  With his resignation, Meyers will 
also be forfeiting his seat on the UF Board of Trustees.

  Tired of waiting until 1 p.m. to 
drink on Sundays? You may be in 
luck.
  The Gainesville City Commis-sion sent the ordinances that restrict liquor sales at stores and restaurants to the city Public Safety Committee on Thursday for possible revisions.
  The city’s code of ordinances 
limits the sale of liquor on Sunday at businesses to the hours of 1 p.m. to 11 p.m. and prohibits the sale of packaged liquor at stores. Monday through Saturday , businesses can serve liquor from 7 a.m. to 2 a.m.
  Business owner Shawn Shepherd 
asked the commission to make the rules the same for each day.  Shepherd, who owns the V ellos 
Brickstreet Grill downtown, said the economic impact of increasing the sale hours would be huge. He esti-mated that the change could mean another month’s worth of proﬁ  t.
  “That would be huge to any small 
business,” he said.
  City Commissioner Jeanna Mas-
trodicasa, chair of the Public Safety Commission, said the committee might consider extending the hours restaurants can serve liquor Sunday morning, b  ut she said she doesn’t think the committee will change the rules for liquor stores or extend the night hours for restaurants that serve liquor on Sundays.
  “Sometimes, it’s OK to go home 
and dry out a little bit,” she said.

   Gators fans looking to buy football tick-
ets for the next home game from someone on the street should be wary — they could be paying big bucks for counterfeit tickets.   
  Tommy Kleckley’s niece traveled from 
New Hampshire to see her family and watch the Gators play the University of Alabama on Saturday. 
  Thanks to two bogus tickets, she never laid eyes on Florida Field. 
  Kleckley, 50, of Gainesville, said his 
niece, Katrice Sutherland, and her husband, Tim, who are both in their late 30s, bought tickets from a stranger on University Av-enue on Saturday for about $100 apiece.   When they showed their tickets to the 
employees at the gates of Ben Hill Grifﬁ  n Stadium, employees said they were coun-terfeit.
  “I knew quite a few people who got 
tickets on the street, and they were good, so that’s why it really threw me,” Kleckley said.

When Keith Bucella 
was thinking of how to 
give back to the communi-ty, the decision came eas-ily to him because of his rough past.
Addiction Tattoo will 
be holding a raffle to do-nate to Peaceful Paths, a shelter for abused women, and the Ronald McDonald House, a program provid-ing care for sick children and their families.
Bucella, 36, owner of 
Addiction Tattoo, said he chose those two charities because he grew up in a house where his mother was beaten.
His ex-girlfriend’s 
nephew recently was in the Ronald McDonald House and passed away.
“I’m sticking to what I 
know,” he said.
All proceeds from the 
event will be split evenly between the two charities.
The winner of the raffle 
will be able to get a tattoo valued up to $50 and one piercing.Raffle tickets can be 
purchased at Addiction Tattoo, 819 W. University Ave. and cost $1 each.
Winners of the Hallow-
een’s Hottest Tattoo and Piercing Contest, separate from the raffle, can win two piercings, one tattoo valued up to $150 and a backpack full of free pro-motional items.
The contest and raffle 
started Oct. 1 and will end Halloween night.
Even though the shop 
has been open for only six months, Bucella said it was important for him to give back to the community.
Bucella said he is from 
Brooklyn, and that is the atmosphere he is aiming for in his shop.
He said the shop has a 
great relationship with the Gainesville Police Depart-ment and a lot of the of-ficers have come for their first tattoos or for repeat tattoos and piercings.
Bucella said he and his 
staff spent three weeks at the tattoo shop working from the early morning until the late night, about 150 hours, readying it for 
opening day in April.4, ALLIGATOR §  FRIDAY, OCTOBER 7, 2011

Unicorns are real. 
The myth of the unicorn stems 
from an actual type of goat with a single horn that was once bred in Persia, said Dallas Tanner, a 55-year-old cryptozoologist from South Car -
olina. 
Today, unicorns, along with Big 
Foot and thunderbirds, are a myth. But Tanner makes a living research-ing these animals to prove that they once existed. 
“I talk about animals rumored to 
exist and find species to explain it,” Tanner said. 
The Reitz Union Board Entertain-
ment is bringing Tanner to speak to UF students at 8 p.m. Tuesday at the Orange & Brew to discuss his career as a cyrptozoologist and author.
Cryptozoology is the study of 
hidden animals. 
The event is free and open to the 
public. RUB Entertainment is paying him $250 for travel and board, said Ellie Carpo, the co-director of lectur -
ers and comedians committee. 
“I got the idea to bring a crypto-
zoologist after watching really, really bad monster movies,” Carpo said.
The director last year recom-
mended someone else, but Carpo said she wanted to bring someone different and cater to a different crowd. 
At the event, Tanner will talk 
about how the science and histories of previous eras have become the myths and legends of today. 
Tanner said he started his career 
as a cryptozoologist to prove a point. After writing his first novel, “Shad-ow of the Thunderbird,” Tanner was told that there was nothing dealing with cryptozoology in the southeast-ern United States. He attempted to prove everyone wrong, and he said he believes to have succeeded. 
“Shadow of the Thunderbird,” 
along with his other four books, is fiction but backed by facts.  His nov-els are based on real experiences that other people have shared with him, along with his own research. He con-siders himself to be a researcher first and an author second. 
Although Tanner has never actu-
ally seen a cryptid, animals that are out of place or out of time, he is OK with it. Because to him, “believing is seeing.”Author to talk unicorns,

Heather McNeill always 
wanted to be a teacher. 
As a child, she preferred 
to play school with her little 
brother rather than playing with dolls. Chalkboards lined her walls, and chalk dust tick-led her fingertips. 
McNeill, 21, said she never 
had a defining moment that made her want to teach. She just always knew. She is now a mathematics senior at UF and a UFTeach scholar. 
There are about 300 students 
in the program, according to Dimple Malik Flesner, associate director of the program. 
UFTeach recruits outstand-
ing science and math majors to earn a specialized minor in ed-ucation through the program. This minor fulfills the profes-sional preparation coursework for teachers that is required by the Florida State Board of Edu-cation Rule 6A-4.006(2).  
“There is no other way to 
get a degree in math or science education at the undergradu-ate level,” Flesner wrote in an email.
“We are filling a great need 
at UF and for the state of Flor -
ida.”
UFTeach was recently recog-
nized as one of STEMflorida’s best practices in excellence and accountability in targeted sci-ence, technology , engineering and mathematics (STEM), and teacher recruitment and reten-tion efforts, according to a June 21 STEMflorida news release.
Since 2009, STEMflorida has 
reviewed the competitive pri-orities of employers and pro-fessionals who rely on science, technology , engineering and math to prepare Florida’s talent for the future, according to the organization’s website.
The UFTeach program gets 
its funding from a five-year grant issued by the National Math and Science Ini-
tiative for $2.4 mil-lion along 
with an endowment from the Tampa-based Helios Education Foundation, according to the release.
Over the past year, UFTeach 
has made changes to methods of retention and recruitment, Flesner said.
The largest change has been 
using student volunteers and interns involved in UFTeach in-stead of the faculty and staff to recruit new members.
Once the students begin the 
UFTeach program, peer men-tors are assigned to them ac-cording to their line of study . 
McNeill is one of four math 
mentors, and there are also four science mentors. 
The peer mentors encourage 
beginning students and help create and refine lesson plans before they teach in the field, McNeill said. 
Flesner said UFTeach has 
revamped its website, now dis-playing up-to-date information and several student testimoni-als. The program has also been writing grants to offer more paid internships for students in the education minor. 
“Students begin with early 
and well-supported field expe-riences in real classrooms from the first course in the program,” Flesner said. “This allows them to decide if they truly like teach-ing.”
McNeill will be attending 
graduate school for math edu-cation upon graduating in the spring, and then she plans to teach full time at the middle- or high-school level.
She is pleased to see the pro-
gram receive recognition.
“Aside from learning all of 
the content knowledge and the pedagogy that goes along with being a good teacher,” she said, “UFTeach imparts skills like be-ing able to communicate with others, time management and other skills that you really don’t find in a textbook.”
Program allows students to try 
hand in teaching science, math

UF students were invited to 
represent the United States in the 
Asian Business Case Competi-tion in Singapore this week. And they didn’t disappoint.
The team of four Warrington 
College of Business Administra-tion students placed second in the competition, which started Saturday, said Horace Tucker, associate director for the War -
rington College of Business Ad-ministration.
The event, which was hosted 
by Nanyang Business School in Singapore, focused on sustain-ability and business. The team was given 40 hours to analyze and develop a team analysis of a business case about an Asian-based organization using Micro-soft Powerpoint 2007.
“We are very proud of our 
students,” Tucker said. “At the competition, our students crafted and delivered an effective busi-ness presentation exhibiting the knowledge and poise worthy of their impressive finish.”
The teams were given 15 
minutes for their presentations during the semifinal and final rounds followed by a 15-minute question-and-answer session.
The team was composed of 
Amanda Aschenbrenner, mar -
keting senior; Mikaela Moore, in-ternational studies senior; Meng Liu, accounting and master of sci-ence in finance senior; and Wil-liam Hadley, accounting senior.
All the students are 21 years 
old.
Universi-
ties from New Zealand, the Netherlands, Canada, Singa-pore, Australia 
and Portugal were invited to compete as 
well.
First place went to Queen-
sland University of Technology in Australia, and third place went to  Auckland University of Tech-nology.
Tucker said UF has partici-
pated in an average of four to five international and two to three domestic competitions each year for the past few years.
This is the second time the 
university has received second place in an international compe-tition during the past three years, said Brian Ray , associate dean and director for the College of Business Administration. 
“[Schools] across the globe 
see how well we have performed in past competitions and ask us to be part of their competition,” Ray said. “These are superstar students. They are the best of the best.”

� THE GATOR POPS BAKERY 
SELLS CAKE LOLLIPOPS.
NATALIE ASOREY
Alligator Contributing Writer
 
Jamie Sanchez and Josie V eloz 
spent their weekend swimming in cake batter and colored sprinkles.
They baked a batch of 55 red-coat-
ed, lemon-flavored, bite-sized cakes, which they handed out as samples on the UF campus. 
Sanchez, 19, and V eloz, 18, have 
created Gator Pops Bakery, a spe-cialty bake shop, out of their apart-ment kitchen.  The bakery specializes in catering “cake pops,” bite-sized, coated balls of cake on a stick, akin to lollipops. 
Sanchez, a linguistics sophomore 
at UF, first made a large batch of cake pops for a meet-and-greet event for a community service group.
“I wanted to bring something dif-
ferent, not the traditional cookies or cupcakes,” she said. 
The positive reaction she received 
from guests at the event encouraged her to start the business with best friend Veloz, whom she met four years ago in a high school chorus class. 
“Baking the cake pops started as a 
hobby,” Sanchez said, “but now that others are enjoying it, we’re excited to see where the bakery takes us.”  
The two friends, who refer to them-
selves as baking sisters, look to market their cake pops to sororities and other on-campus organizations hosting events.    
Gator Pops Bakery , which is set to 
open officially within the next month, will offer the following flavors: brown-ie, chocolate fudge, milk chocolate, red velvet, yellow cake and lemon cake, which is its signature flavor.  
To place a custom catering order, 
customers must choose the flavor, colors, design and, if desired, edible decorations. 
Each order requires a minimum 
of 20 cake pops and must be placed at least two days before the date the pops are needed. While prices vary, a basic, minimum order — with any flavor and a simple coating — will cost an average of $25. 
Customers can pick up their order 
or have it delivered.
Though not officially open, San-
chez and Veloz have created a web-site, gatorpopsbakery.weebly.com, and a Facebook page.
“Some people look at the cake 
pops and wonder how we even make them,” Sanchez said. 
“But, we make everything from 
scratch,” V eloz said. “It takes a long time and it’s messy.”
“We make the cake, destroy it, 
make it again, freeze it, decorate it. It’s not like a one-stop shop.”Students 
create bake shop from scratch
Meyers will still be 
involved on campus
tions Committee chairman and Student Senate president. He 
plans to graduate in the spring with a degree in food and re-source economics.
Meyers said he will still be involved on campus in the fu-
ture and will  help Reynolds make the transition into his role as president.
“Anthony is an experienced and capable leader who has 
my full confidence,” Meyers said in a letter sent to SG offi-cials and the Board of Trustees. “Having him as my successor makes this decision easier.”
Reynolds, who served as a director with Students Taking 
Action Against Racism and as an SG Cabinet chairman, said that he is sad to see Meyers, who is a close friend, leave office but that he is ready to take  the position.
“At the end of day I had no intention of being Student Body 
president,” Reynolds said. “I didn’t run for Student Body president. Now that I find myself in the role, regardless of my feelings before, I want to do the very best job that I can.”
Reynolds said he will take his role as the voice of students 
seriously and wants to hear directly from them their concerns and desires.
Students Party Sen. Carly Wilson and another friend of 
Meyers, said the announcement came as a shock to her and the rest of her party.
“We rarely agreed with him in the political sense, but we 
hope everything works out OK for him,” she said. “We’re all Gators, and we wish him the best.”meyerS , from page 1Police recommend buying tickets from office, UAA
said Margie Addison, director of ticket sys-
tems for the University Athletic Association Gator Ticket Office. 
When reports of counterfeit ticketing roll 
in, the University Police Department sets up an area nearby to handle the problem. 
People with counterfeit tickets are sent to 
the designated area, where UPD employees gather information so they can investigate and potentially find the people responsible, Addison said. 
If there are tickets available for the game, 
people who purchased counterfeit tickets may be able to buy valid ones through the ticket office. 
“We are hoping that most folks do not 
buy tickets on the street because they’re taking a very big risk of counterfeit tickets,” she said.
Maj. Brad Barber, UPD public informa-
tion officer, said people should purchase tickets to athletic events from UAA or from a person they know. 
The reselling of tickets is not allowed in 
any capacity on campus, Barber said. 
If people are considering buying a ticket 
on the street, they can come to the ticket of-fice to check them for validity. Sellers often aren’t willing to go to the 
ticket office to have them checked, though. 
This may be a sign that the tickets are 
counterfeit, Addison said.
The south ticket plaza between Gates 1 
and 2 is open from four hours before the game through halftime.   
Employees can use their computer 
systems to determine whether the tick-et bar codes have already been scanned to allow other people into the stadi-um, which is a sign of counterfeiting.  “We can do a visual and tell you whether it’s good or bad in most cases,” Addison said.

27% NOThursday’s question: Were you sad 
when you heard Steve Jobs died? Today’s question: Do you think you should be able to 
buy alchol any time of the day in Gainesville?Well, this week has finally come to an end, and it’s been 
an interesting one. 
We have gone from a campus divided over a heated 
election to a student body united in mourning of one of the 
greatest men of our generation. So, without further ado, we move to this week’s let’s-remember-that-we’re-all-human edition of...
Darts & Laurels 
Of course, we couldn’t end this week without giving 
a Rest-In-Peace LAUREL to Steve Jobs. You changed the 
world, and you will be missed.
Of course, there are people out there who will find an 
excuse to take something sad and make it annoying. That’s why we’re throwing a it-would-be-funny-if-it-wasn’t-so-sad DART at Westboro Baptist Church members for 
announcing that they were going to protest the funeral of Steve Jobs. 
What was funny was that they used an iPhone to make 
the announcement. 
They then went on to argue that God used Jobs to give 
the members of the church the power to preach their mes-sage. 
These are the people that make you want to punch brick 
walls. A lot. 
Given his recent announcement, we thought we would 
give a thanks-for-your-service LAUREL to Student Body 
President Ben Meyers, who will be resigning from his po-sition. Best of luck, and we wish you the best. 
Next, we toss a think-about-what-you’re-saying-on-tele-
vision DART at Hank Williams Jr., who said that House 
Speaker John Boehner and President Barack Obama play-ing golf together would be like Israeli Prime Minister Ben-jamin Netanyahu playing golf with Hitler, respectively. 
Any sane person would see Williams was not really 
comparing Obama to Hitler, but given that this comparison has been made in the past, he should have known that the media would jump all over him for it. 
In relation to this story, we have to throw a don’t-be-so-
damn-sensitive DART at ESPN for pulling Williams’ “All 
My Rowdy Friends” song, which leads into the “Monday Night Football” broadcast. 
What do Williams’ political comments have to do with 
the song you use? 
Pulling his song shows how political correctness is 
making us all sensitive cry babies. It also presumes that the general public can’t tell the difference between a direct comparison to Hitler and a poor choice of words. 
Do you really think we’re that stupid? And for something a little more, the boys of the edito-
rial board are giving a man-that’s-nice LAUREL to soc-
cer champ Hope Solo for showing off her athletic body in 
ESPN The Magazine’s Body Issue. Yeah, she was naked. 
Have a fun and safe weekend, and be sure to check back 
next week.Alabama immigration law not a solution
The simple truth is that the repercussions of illegal im-
migration can be detrimental to our country. When dealing with this issue, we must keep our national 
self-interests in mind. 
But is it fair to punish existing, albeit illegal immigrants 
who have already made a living in the United States? Even if they are using our resources or adding a financial burden on our society, they are also the ones who clean our bath-rooms and pick our vegetables in hot, dreary fields. Losing these undocumented immigrants means losing a substan-tial part of our labor force. 
In this country, we treat illegal immigrants with a double 
standard. Since they provide cheap labor, they are almost encouraged to enter the country the back door. American businesses know how convenient it is to use immigrants, and moreover, they know how detrimental it would be to lose their skill and work ethic. 
Recently, an Alabama immigration law has shown the 
consequences of our double standard when it comes to un-documented workers. Alabama’s law is not progressive. 
In general, the law demands that state and local law en-
forcement officers attempt to validate a person’s immigra-tion status when said person is pulled over for a routine stop or traffic violation. Just like a criminal investigation, if the officer has “reasonable suspicion” that the individual is an illegal immigrant, he or she has the right to demand federal immigration papers. 
There are several important concerns that must be ad-
dressed. First, what experience do Alabama state and lo-cal law enforcement officers have in determining whether someone may be an illegal immigrant? The concept of rea-sonable suspicion is such a contested, complex and open-ended legal issue in criminal court that I cannot imagine how difficult it would be to apply the standard to alleged immigrants. 
Reasonable suspicion is understandably used in circum-
stances of obvious offenses, such as determining whether someone has drugs in their car. A police officer is trained to observe the individuals’ behavior, facial expressions, etc. 
The only way for an officer of 
the law to be reasonably suspi-cious that someone is an illegal immigrant is to use judgment void of any physical evidence — judgment perhaps based solely 
on the color of one’s skin. This is the definition of racial profiling. 
Second, Alabama’s immigration law requires that el-
ementary and secondary schools verify students’ immigra-tion status before admitting them into the school. There is one legal dilemma that stands out clearly here: It is unlaw-ful to deter students from enrolling into a school. Even if this wasn’t a question of legality, it is unfortunate that the education sector is once again victimized. Essentially, Ala-bama is denying children the right to pursue an education. In turn, children who do not attend school like the rest of their friends will be stigmatized and labeled, which can often negatively influence a child’s self-awareness and can often lead to many forms of criminal behavior. Alabama should find another way. Demoralizing immigrants is not the answer.  
Third, just like during the segregation period in our his-
tory, there will soon be a divide between immigrants and non-immigrants. Is it moral to use an undocumented work-er’s labor, dictate their lifestyle and fire and hire them as we please but then get rid of them because we happen to be in an economic recession?
It is understandable that Alabama wants to address the 
illegal immigration issue, but its recent law may bring about broader, long-term problems.

Letters to the Editor
Ten years of war is too much
Ten years ago today , President Bush 
launched Operation Enduring Freedom, the 
United States-led invasion of Afghanistan. 
It was the first in a series of military inter -
ventions that continue to define our country’s war on terror. The original mission —to topple the Taliban and kill or capture al-Qaida lead-ers, including Osama bin Laden — has been replaced by a futile policy of nation-building. 
Despite the rhetoric of his 2008 campaign, 
President Obama has done little to end the wars of his predecessor. 
Waging war is expensive. To date, the gov-
ernment has blown about $460 billion on the war in Afghanistan and about $798 billion in Iraq. 
Considering our government’s troubled 
finances, it doesn’t seem wise to have wasted $1.2 trillion dollars on one of the most destruc-tive state pursuits. Staggering as the financial cost of the wars is, the human cost is far more sobering.
For 10 years, our soldiers have been en-meshed in the tangle of tribal allegiances and state corruption that characterize Afghan poli-tics. In the last four years, U.S. casualties have risen at an alarming rate, but the hardships suffered by the Afghan people are even more disconcerting. 
The United States has suffered about 1,500 
casualties in Afghanistan alone. When Iraq is included, the total climbs to about 40,000 United States troops killed or wounded. Civil-ian deaths in the war on terror are estimated to number in the hundreds of thousands. The extension of a bloody and point-
less war is inexcusable. As the 10th year of America’s longest running war concludes, we must push for an end before 10 years of war becomes 11. 
I urge you to take a stand against the war 
on terror today on the Plaza of the Americas with UF Libertarians and Students for a Dem-ocratic Society . Ten years of war is 10 years too long — it’s time to stop.
William Tew
UF Libertarians president
There is a very interesting thought ex-
periment, widely referred to as the “Trolley Problem,” which poses the 
question of whether to save a group of five people by diverting a trolley away from them toward a man laying in a hammock who would be killed instead. 
Perhaps the same dilemma is being 
raised by many American citizens as to whether the death of al-Awlaki was really called for. 
I am a native from India who came to 
the U.S. seeking higher and better educa-tion, and I may not have a very strong hold on this country’s emotions on terrorism or its war against terror.  
But since we, as Indians, live a few 
blocks away from Afghanistan, I can share my ideas surrounding this issue, perhaps with a different perspective.
I am a strong supporter of the fact that 
terrorism has no religion and no national-ity. Terrorists are living a fool’s life, mis-guided in aim and devoid of humanity. Whenever a terrorist is killed, there is a chance that maybe we have saved a thou-sand lives somewhere else. 
Every human being deserves to live, but 
what happens to those who have lost their touch with humanity? Here, the question is not about killing a person; here, the ques-tion is about the very idea that is driving some people to the path of destruction.When Osama 
bin Laden was killed, no one talk-ed about his na-tionality. The only 
concern was that justice should prevail. Can’t we take the same stand in the case of every terrorist who has waged war against a nation, its people and the very basis on which the nation is founded? 
We should take this in a broader sense 
instead of narrowing down the valor of American soldiers to just killing a person. 
As a matter of fact, what America has 
done has just bolstered its image on the war against terror. Now the world knows that the U.S. is adamant on its stand of wiping out terrorism. You want to make Earth a better place for us and for future generations.
By killing a terrorist, America has sent a 
strong message that the U.S. and its people do not treat terrorists with any bias. Let them be a citizen of any nation; if they are involved in terrorizing innocent people, they have lost touch with humanity. 
And in my view, we are a human first 
and a citizen of a nation second. America did a great and brave thing by killing a ter -
rorist, supporting the notion that terrorists, in the end, do not belong to any country.

Speaking Out“Reduce, reuse, recycle!” 
This is by no means a new 
campaign; most of us recycle 
now, almost to the point of it being second 
nature. If you’re like me, then you’re always proud of yourself when you toss away your Gatorade bottle in the recycling bin on cam-pus. But are we even recycling correctly?  
If you leave the cap on your bottle, then no, you’re not.
On the UF campus, you can place metal 
cans, glass, and No. 1 and 2 plastics in the designated recycling bins. Such plastics in-clude soda and water bottles, peanut butter jars, five-gallon buckets and milk jugs. But wait, have you ever noticed the sign posted on the recycling bins that says “No caps or liquids?” Yeah, me neither. Until this year.
Let me explain why caps and lids aren’t 
allowed in the recycling bins. The caps that seal plastics like soda bottles are made of a different plastic than the bottle itself. The soda bottle is melted with other No. 1 plastics at a treatment facility so it can be recycled and remade. But if you melt two different plastics together, they won’t blend, and the whole batch is considered contaminated. 
According to Dale Morris, the Solid 
Waste Coordinator for UF, “Even slightly intermixed (contaminated) plastic cannot be used to make good fibers, bottles, wrap-pers or structural forms.” So what happens with those plastic or glass bottles with the caps attached? They get thrown out, bur -
ied in a landfill, left to slowly release their chemicals into the ground.
What? That’s an 
outrage! Of course it is, but it isn’t 
really the recycling plant’s fault that the plastics can’t be melted together. Another reason lids aren’t recycled is because they pose a risk when still attached to bottles to workers at the recycling facility if they are placed in the baling machine. So you might complain about one extra step, but no one wants to risk worker safety.
It’s as simple as taking the cap off and 
throwing it away . You don’t even have to save the cap for an art project or find an-other recycling bin to place it in if you don’t want to. Just twist it off, and toss it out. That one step brings you closer to ensuring that you are really making a difference by recy-cling.
There are other things you can do to 
help the recycling effort, including rinsing out your bottles and jars and crushing plas-tic bottles and aluminum cans to conserve space. And if you’re feeling extra eco-savvy, then please do! But if you don’t take the cap off, your recycling effort is useless.
I don’t blame you for not knowing be-
cause I was right there with you until last spring. But now that you know better, please take the cap off next time you re-cycle a bottle. Make recycling worth your time and effort.

conservation senior at UF.

Volunteering members of RecSports serve food to a man at St. Francis House on Thursday. Cur-
rently, St. Francis House is restricted to a 130-meal limit per day.
LOCAL
MEREDITH RUTLAND
Alligator Staff Writer
The St. Francis House is one meet-
ing away from shedding its 130-meal 
limit.
The Gainesville City Commis-
sion voted unanimously to approve its second reading of the city soup-kitchen meal-limit change. Commis-sioners voted to change the meal limit to a time limit at a meeting Aug. 18.
The meal limit restricted the city’s 
soup kitchens to serving 130 meals a day. The number limit, which ex-cluded Christmas, Thanksgiving and a day of the shelter’s choice, will be replaced by a time limit of three hours a day for meals. 
The hours must be continuous, 
and meals must be served between 8:30 a.m. and 7 p.m. 
On paper, the rule applies to all 
city soup kitchens, but in practice, the St. Francis House is the only soup kitchen that has to follow the limit.
St. Francis House Executive Di-
rector Kent Vann said he plans to serve lunch from 10 a.m. to 1 p.m. at the soup kitchen once the change is made.
There’s one last detail to work 
out: The City Plan Board has to ap-prove the measure on Nov. 1. After that, the St. Francis House can start operating under the new rule. 
“Hopefully, I can start the very 
next day,” Vann said.
He said he is tentative about feel-
ing excited until all the details are hammered out.
“I’m feeling good that we’re even 
at this point right now,” he said.City nears final approval 
of soup kitchen time limit

Off-roading is returning to UF.
After a four-year hiatus, Gator Motor -
sports will be building the off-road baja car once again.
The last baja car won third place in 2008 
in the Baja SAE — short for Society of Au-tomotive Engineers — in Montreal with a four-person team. However, due to a lack of members and funding, the motorsports team decided to work on only one car, the formula race car, in 2009.
Recruiting began at the beginning of 
the semester for the new baja team, and eight people have expressed interest to the team’s executive board members. Howev-er, the team will need at least 10 members in order for the workload to be manage-able, said Eduardo Rondon, captain of the formula team. Anyone can join the team regardless of 
his or her major or level of experience. 
“It’s an amazing resume builder. The 
program allows students to learn engineer -
ing concepts far earlier than they would in their coursework,” Rondon said. 
The shop is located behind both north 
garage doors in the Mechanical and Aero-space Engineering C building.

For live updates from Saturday’s game against No. 1 LSU, follow our football writers on Twitter: @GregLuca, @Tyler__Jett, @Tomas_Verde and @WattMatts.We’re all rednecks at heart.
Sure, you go to college 
and listen to hip-hop and 
once traveled to Israel on a Birth-
right trip; but, deep down, you love the simplicities of the South. Don’t pretend otherwise — we here at the alligatorSports Brand Picks Column tailgated last Saturday, and we saw you in your jort-wearing, Toby Keith-loving glory. 
Even you yankees who only en-
rolled at Florida to appear interest-ing to your high school classmates: You’re southern now. There’s no go-ing back; you’ve already gone tubing down Ichetucknee Springs and tasted real barbecue.  
And that’s OK, because the South 
is what makes football great. No-body calls in to radio stations, trolls message boards or poisons a rival’s historic trees quite like us rednecks.
That’s why we were torn up when 
a classic redneck — Hank Williams Jr., the Elvis of “Monday Night Foot-ball” — sullied our favorite game with all that Hitler talk. But let’s not get too sad. There are still plenty of famous rednecks who love football and keep their politics in perspec-tive.  
Never will that be more on dis-
play than at the Red River Rivalry, going down this Saturday at the Cot-ton Bowl. We let a couple of our good ol’ sports writers debate.

� LAST YEAR’S LOSS TO 
ALABAMA STARTED THREE-GAME LOSING STREAK. 
GREG LUCA
Alligator Staff Writer
 
This year was supposed to be 
different. 
The Gators have a new coach, 
Will Muschamp, new expectations 
and an influx of young talent. 
But, through five weeks, the 
season has been a mirror image of 2010. 
Last year, the Gators won their 
first four games by an average 23.5 points, the closest a 14-point win against Tennessee, before los-ing to Alabama by 25. 
This season, the Gators won 
their first four games by an av-erage 31.3 points, the closest a 10-point win against Tennessee, before losing to Alabama by 28. 
In 2010, UF let the beatdown at 
the hands of Alabama turn into a free-fall, losing its next two games en route to a 9-5 season. 
How will the 2011 team re-
spond? Can the Gators handle adversity?
“I don’t have any doubt at all,” 
redshirt freshman tackle Chaz Green said of the team’s ability to respond to adversity. “I’ve got the most confidence in this team. We had one bump in the road. We’re still — our whole goal is to get to Atlanta. They’re still out there, they’re still possible. So I’ve got the most confidence in our team.”With South Carolina falling 
to Auburn last weekend, Florida remains in a three-way tie, also with Georgia, for the lead in the Southeastern Conference’s East division. 
But the Gators were in the 
same position after 2010’s loss to the Crimson Tide and failed to       capitalize. Florida isn’t discouraged by 
the emerging repeat. 
“It’s motivation,” sophomore

Florida coach Will Muschamp will try to avoid the downward spiral last year’s team experienced 
after losing to Alabama. Players said they are confident they will rebound against No. 1 LSU.
UF trying 
to avoid repeat of 2010
With a matchup against the No. 1 
team in the country looming, with John Brantley out, with so much 
doom and gloom surrounding the Gators this week, it’s hard to get excited for Saturday. 
Florida showed fatal flaws against Ala-
bama, and LSU has the ability to make the forgettable results from last weekend re-emerge in a hurry. A loss is sure to deflate much of the remaining hype regarding Will Muschamp’s first year.However, there is hope. There’s always a 
chance.
But for the Gators to pull off the improb-
able, they’ll need to do these five things:
Run the ball and stop the run. To win in 
the Southeastern Conference, this is impor -
tant every week. It’s even more important this Saturday, as Florida is coming off its worst performances of the season in both re-gards against Alabama. 
LSU may be ranked seventh in the SEC in rushing, but the Ti-gers have racked up their 172.6-yard av-erage against qual-ity opponents. They also tout the nation’s third-ranked rush defense, holding teams like Oregon 
and Mississippi State in check. 
Protect the quarterback. As we creep closer to game day, it appears freshman Jeff Driskel is the most likely candidate to start. Driskel will need protection from an offen-sive line that looked inept at times against Alabama, especially if he’s going to atone for the turnover woes that have plagued him in limited playing time this season. 
Allowing the Tigers to take the ball away 
from the Gators offense Saturday will mean trouble in the bayou. Plus, Driskel is allergic

 As the Florida men’s and women’s 
swimming teams prepare for the 
2011-12 season, there will certainly be no shortage of motivation.
  Aside from their usual goals 
within Southeastern Conference and NCAA competition, the 2012 Summer Olympic Games in London are fast approaching, and plenty of Florida swimmers hope to give themselves the opportunity to perform for their respective nations on the world stage.
  The Olympics are the biggest event 
in swimming, the time once every four years when the eyes of the world will be focused on the sport.
  Coaches are not excluded from ex-
citement, as Florida coach Gregg Troy will serve as head coach for the U.S. men’s squad in London. But, for now, his focus is solely on his UF swim-mers. 
  “The foreign guys have a pretty 
good chance of making their Olym-pic team and almost all of our team has qualiﬁ  ed for the U.S. Trials,” Troy said.
C  oaches are hoping the motiva-
tion of the upcoming Olympic season translates into results for the men’s and women’s teams, who hope to build off top-10 NCAA ﬁ  nishes in the spring when they host the All-Florida Invitational today through Sunday. 
Preliminary races will begin at 10 
a.m. each day, with ﬁ  nals beginning at 7 p.m.
  Florida’s men ﬁ  nished ﬁ  fth in the NCAA Championships in March, but some key departures leave many ex-pecting less out of this year’s team.
While Troy admitted the losses of 
standout seniors and NCAA Cham-pions Brett Fraser and Conor Dwyer doesn’t help, he was very optimistic about his 12-man incoming freshman class. 
  “The good side of (our youth) is 
that the future of this program is very bright,” Troy said. “The bad side is the speed of the events changes dramati-cally. One of the big challenges is to keep their conﬁ  dence up because it’s a different world than what they’re used to.”
  Florida’s women were disappoint-
ed by their seventh-place ﬁ  nish at the NCAA Championships, but most of 
the swim-mers from last year’s team are 
back and ready to improve on that result. 
Sophomore Elizabeth Beisel, who 
scored top-ﬁ  ve ﬁ  nishes in two events at the national championship, as well as seniors Sarah Bateman, Teresa Crippen and Shara Stafford will all be back in the pool for the Gators this fall. 
  “We’ve got some holes to ﬁ  ll,” 
Troy said. “It’s great to have Crippen and Shara back, but they can’t swim all the events, so we’re going to have to get some improvements from our sophomore class, and rely on some freshmen again.”  Gators motivated by

 Pink hair and pink shirts will stick out 
amongst the usual orange and blue tonight 
at Pressly Stadium.
  Florida will host Auburn in the fourth 
annual Kicking for the Cure Match, beneﬁ  t-ing breast cancer awareness, and the Gators will take the ﬁ  eld wearing pink shirts for warm-ups. 
However, for many team members, the 
night has a more signiﬁ  cant meaning than simply taking the ﬁ  eld in a different colored shirt.
  “Almost every person on our team in 
some way, whether it is a friend of the fam-ily or family directly, somebody they know has been affected by cancer,” coach Becky Burleigh said. 
“This is just an opportunity for us to pro-
mote that awareness and to feel blessed that we have our opportunities.”
  Breast cancer is an issue that hits home 
for Burleigh, whose mother, Nancy, is a sur-vivor.  
Burleigh said she values having the op-
portunity to promote awareness of any cancer, as her mother has suffered from the disease in three other forms, including stomach cancer. 
While Burleigh has always been at her 
mother’s side throughout all of her health issues, Nancy has never allowed it to affect the coach on the job.
  “My mom makes that easy because she 
doesn’t require a lot of attention,” Burleigh said. 
  “She just enjoys any support that we give 
her.  She doesn’t like to make a big deal out of herself in that situation.”
Whether it is through visiting the hospi-
tal or talking to her on the phone, Burleigh said she tries to keep in touch with her mother every day.  She says that her father, Ron, has played a huge role in the man-agement of Nancy’s health, and the results have shown.
  “You would never see any limitations 
in her,” Becky said. “You would just see how she has been so positive through all of this.”
  The importance of raising cancer aware-
ness is not something that is lost on Becky’s players, either. 
  “It’s obviously something that means 
a lot to her,” outside back Kat Williamson said. “And it means a lot to us as a team for her to be our coach to represent that and create awareness about it.”
  Last summer, Williamson helped honor  
her mom’s best friend, who had just been 
diagnosed with breast cancer, when Williamson took part in the Susan G. Komen Race for the Cure in Dallas. 
The race is the world’s 
largest fundraising event for breast cancer, with more than 100 races worldwide annually.  
  “It was really inspiring just to see all 
those women out there and it’s just crazy to see how many people support the cause,” Williamson said.
  Sophomore midﬁ  elder Taylor Travis is 
going to great lengths to support the cause tonight, even dying her hair pink.  
  Travis said the game will have special 
meaning to her because her grandmother is a two-time breast cancer survivor.
  “It is a big deal for us,” she said. “Not 
even just me.  In general, we understand how important it is, and we just want to get it out there more.”  Breast cancer awareness has 
special meaning for Florida
Burleigh
UF Swimmingguard Jon Halapio said. “It’s motiva-
tion for this week to get better and go out to Louisiana and take care of busi-ness.”
  The Gators know they’re under-
dogs. 
  Betting lines have No. 1 LSU (5-0, 
2-0 SEC) as a 14-point favorite in its matchup with No. 17 Florida (4-1, 2-1 SEC) Saturday at 3:30 p.m. in Baton Rouge, La.
  In one game, UF fell from national 
contender to mere SEC hopeful.
  “There’s kind of doubt,” junior wide 
receiver Frankie Hammond said. “That loss kind of hit us. But we still have to go out and prove ourselves, so it’s just us against the world. Nobody believes we can do it but us, and we’re going to go out there and prove that.”
  Muschamp said that a number of 
players came in on Sunday, the team’s usual off day, to watch ﬁ  lm. 
  Sophomore cornerback Jaylen Wat-
kins said the loss made a noticeable dif-ference in the locker room and brought the Gators closer together.
  And offensive coordinator Charlie 
Weis said the team has kept a level head thanks to a veteran coaching staff.
  “Our staff have all been through experiences like this before, and we’ve got a good idea how to handle it,” Weis said. 
“It isn’t like panic sets in, pandemo-
nium sets in. It’s a very matter of fact evaluation of what we do.”
  If Weis is right, Florida could still 
end the season as SEC Champion. But, if he’s wrong, 2011 could easily be a case of déjà vu.

org. Oklahoma (+10) will win this slobberknocker because 
…
  The Sooners know how to ground and pound, and 
they’ve got Monday Night Raw announcer Jim Ross on the sidelines to keep them sharp. On offense, Oklahoma will take a page out of J.R.’s barbecue cookbook and slow-roast the defense. 
  Expect the Sooners’ offensive line to open holes for Dom 
Whaley. And, once Texas is lulled to sleep, OU quarterback Landry Jones will hook up with Ryan Broyles for a couple scores.
  From there, Texas doesn’t stand a chance because Okla-
homa’s conﬁ  dence is “like manure. You just spread it out and everything grows.”
  The Longhorns’ defense, meanwhile, will spend “more 
time on the canvas than Rembrandt.”
   —TYLER JETT
Texas (-10) will perform better than Matthew McCon-
aughey at the box ofﬁ  ce because…
  Case is the real McCoy, and he’s going to follow in his 
older brother’s footsteps. The Longhorns dropped last year’s shootout to the Sooners, meaning the last time they won was in 2009, when Colt McCoy was slinging the ball downﬁ  eld. Know who he beat in this game his senior year? Landry Jones.
  History is going to repeat itself — much like the plot of 
every McConaughey rom-com — and the younger McCoy is going to lead the ‘Horns to a triumph in Texas, the home state of the Texas Rattlesnake.
  And that’s the bottom line, ‘cause Stone Cold said so.
—  TOM GREEN        Now, on to the picks!  Sitting atop the standings with a 24-15 record is alliga-
torSports writer Tyler “I always have trouble getting it in” Jett, who was transparent about his most pressing problems while driving his friends to Tijuana Flats on Taco Tuesday. He was talking about parallel parking. But whatever.
  Tied with Tyler is alligatorSports assistant editor Matt 
“I’m a regal MF’er” Watts, whose eloquence was on dis-play when he tried sneaking some “Ye Olde English” into a story Tuesday. Listen Watts, we know you’re old, but it matters not whether you were around for King Arthur and the Knights of the Round Table. 
  In a tie for third at 23-16 is FightinGators.com’s Cody 
“When a tree falls in a forest and no one is there to see it, I tweet it” Jones, who is ﬁ  lling the Atlanta Braves-sized hole in his heart by watching Florida baseball’s fall practices. Come spring, he will also be providing sabermetric analy-sis to Howard Bishop Middle School’s team.
  Also in third is InsidetheGators.com’s Kyle “You start-
ed the revolution without me?” Maistri, who is stuck in Gainesville while the rest of America’s ungrateful commie bastards protest Wall Street. You promised you would wait, hippies, and you guys have nothing if not your word — well, that and skateboards and Wiz Khalifa mixtapes and pockets full of weed.    
  Climbing the standings and in ﬁ  fth with a 21-18 record 
is the Associated Press’ Mark “I stopped listening after breasts” Long, who didn’t quite understand why the Tam-pa Bay Bucs cheerleaders wore pink Monday night. But one thing is for sure: those outﬁ  ts raised Mark’s “awareness.”
  In sixth with a mark of 20-19 is alligatorSports writer Greg “It’s all downhill without Steve Jobs” Luca, who al-most deleted the latest edition of our podcast when his Mac-Book unexpectedly shut down Thursday afternoon. Cool Hand Luca came through, though, tapping his WWSJD bracelet and recovering the ﬁ  les like a whiz. 
  In a tie for dead-ass last place with a piss-poor record of 
19-20 is the Florida Times-Union’s Mike “I’m not hiding, I’m just short“ DiRocco, who was mistaken for the Wizard of Oz by Trey Burton at media availability last week. No, Mr. Versatility, Mike was not the man behind the curtain.
  Also in dead-ass last with an equally piss-poor record is 
alligatorSports editor Tom “I’m a terrible Jew” Green, who instead of atoning for a life of sin when the sun sets and Yom Kippur begins tonight, will be guzzling the devil’s nectar in the depths of hellish New Orleans. So much for fasting, confronting past mistakes and cleansing your soul. God is proud of you, Tom.     FRIDAY, OCTOBER 7, 2011  ALLIGATOR, 15

Mary Wise preaches that video doesn’t 
lie. 
It was the message Florida’s volleyball 
coach emphasized this week after leav-
ing back-to-back road victories displeased with the performance of her back-row de-fense.
“It’s some defensive deficiencies,” she 
said. “Not so much by lack of effort, but maybe lack of focus.”
Against Auburn and Georgia, Flori-
da’s offense was dynamic, but digs were down.
Redshirt freshman libero Taylor Un-
roe recorded 15 combined digs in the two games — an area the Gators have strug-gled with as of late.
Florida ranks last in the Southeastern 
Conference in digs, a number it would like to pick up as it returns home tonight at 7 to take on Arkansas.
“Not everything is going to be perfect 
all the time,” Unroe said. “Practice this week was a lot of defense.”
Defensive woes are puzzling for the 
Gators. After being forced to play Erin Fleming at the libero position in 2010 due to an injury to Unroe, the Gators were sup-posed to be a vastly improved backcourt team in 2011.
But this year, Unroe is averaging slight-
ly less digs per set (3.55) than Fleming (3.61) did a season ago. SEC digs leader Stephanie Klefot averages 4.71 digs per set for Kentucky.
“The learning curve is when they can 
have unconscious competence,” Wise said. “So they can make the play without having to go through it step by step. That takes experience.”
Experience is one thing Florida’s back 
row lacks. The Gators’ three regulars at de-fensive specialist are all in their first year of collegiate competition. While players have commended Unroe, Holly Pole and Madison Monserez for playing fearlessly, their inexperience has shown through in the film room and on the court.
“They’re still getting used to the speed 
of the game,” junior Tangerine Wiggs said. “When we learn things, we don’t really have time to sit down and digest it.”
Wiggs said the freshmen struggle trans-
lating what they see on video to adjust-ments on the court, the same way she and Chanel Brown did last season.
Maybe the biggest concern for the back 
row has been transitioning plays forward. 
The UF front court has been dominant, 
leading the conference in hitting percent-age and blocks while boasting two play-ers, Kelly Murphy and Kristy Jaeckel, who have won AVCA National Player of the Week honors already this season. 
Wiggs said Florida fans can expect to 
see improvements in on-court communica-tion going forward after a defense-heavy week of practice.
“Once we get that figured out, we’ll be 
a completely different defensive team than we are right now,” Unroe said.
Wise wants all blame for communica-
tion issues directed to the coaching staff, admitting the importance of an integrat-ed front and back hadn’t been stressed enough before this week.
“We were all just a little bit disappoint-
ed,” Jaeckel said. “But we can use what we’ve learned to get better.”to honey badgers.
Knock around Jarrett Lee. LSU’s 
quarterback has been sacked just 
three times this season, the fewest in the SEC, and is usually the benefi-ciary of seven-player protections on passing plays. 
For Florida’s defense to generate 
stops and get off the field on third down, it will need to make things un-comfortable for Lee. He has thrown just one interception this season com-pared to seven touchdowns, and the Gators need to change that ratio on Saturday. 
Create some big plays. Charlie 
Weis has to get Andre Debose in-volved as much as possible. LSU de-fensive coordinator John Chavis has definitely been game planning for Tommy Pickles and Chuckie Finster (the “Rugrats” combo of Jeff Demps and Chris Rainey), and Debose could find himself taking advantage of sin-gle coverage as the Tigers fill the box to stop the run. 
Driskel has shown what he’s capa-
ble of when a play breaks down, and Florida will need multiple big plays to turn the momentum and quiet the crazies in Death Valley. 
Keep it close. If Florida can do 
this, throw everything else out the window. Les Miles is on the verge of being clinically insane, and he has succeeded as a head coach merely due to blind luck. Maybe he sold his soul to a shaman over in New Orleans, or maybe he’s just dumb. Either way, put Miles in a closely contested game and he’s bound to mess it up.
Last year against UF, Miles called 
for the holder on a field-goal attempt to toss the ball blindly over his head on a trick play. It worked, and LSU won. But if Florida keeps it close, then that luck is sure to run out.
