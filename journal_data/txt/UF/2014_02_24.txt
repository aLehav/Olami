UF received its largest ever donation in the 
history of the university on Friday — $75 mil-
lion.
This gift, earmarked for the Warrington Col-
lege of Business Administration, makes its bene-factors, Alfred and Judy Warrington, UF’s ﬁ  rst $100 million donors. 
The couple’s previous gift endowed and 
named the business college, but the Warringtons’ earlier donations funded a range of UF projects, including the stadium expansion and the Florida 
Opportunity Scholars Program.
“It’s the kind of mature fundraising that older 
universities have,” said UF President Bernie Ma-
chen. “It helps us build the academic programs that our students are the beneﬁ  ciaries of.”
The donation will be distributed over time 
and will enlarge the college’s current endow-ment, which funds the faculty’s expenses in hiring graduate students, traveling and buying 
technology for their classrooms, said Tom Mitch-
ell, UF’s vice president for development and alumni affairs. 
“This gift will keep giving 100 years from 
now,” he said.
John Kraft, dean of the Warrington College 
of Business Administration, said this gift will help UF in its goal of rising to the top 10 public schools and compete with the top three public 
business schools in the county.
“It’s all about trying to attract and retain the 
best faculty,” he said. “We want to make sure that 
the high quality performers here are rewarded.”Warrington makes largest donation in UF history

Kaitlin Deglman’s birthday celebra-
tion went out with a bang.
The 19-year-old UF animal science 
sophomore was celebrating her upcom-
ing birthday Saturday night at Club 
Envy when a gunshot was ﬁ  red inside. 
Gainesville Police arrested 25-year-
old Rodney Shefﬁ  eld after they said he 
battered a bar patron that night, but it is unknown who ﬁ  red the gunshot that fol-lowed the ﬁ  ght, GPD spokesman Ofﬁ  cer Ben Tobias wrote in an email. No one was injured.
At about 1:40 a.m., Deglman was up 
on stage dancing with friends when she said she heard a loud popping noise. 
Suddenly, she said, everyone was 
yelling, and bouncers were pushing people off the stage. Deglman said she looked over to her left and saw an ofﬁ  cer pointing a gun.
“At that point I’m like, ‘Oh my gosh. 
That was a gunshot,’” she said.Gunshot ﬁ  red at MidtownCAMPUS

When Jay Bell talks about taking patients 
for a dive, he isn’t talking about scuba diving.
The patients, or “divers,” who walk 
through the door of the new UF Health 
Wound Healing and Hyperbaric Center won’t 
dive into the depths of the ocean. Rather, they 
will walk into one of the center’s two hyper-baric chambers.
“We speak in a lot of nautical terms with this because we deal in sea level and atmo-spheric pressure,” said Jay Bell, program di-rector of the center. “We say we dive a patient when we put them in here, and we call them divers.”
Patients placed into the chamber are put 
under the same oxygen pressure they would face below sea level. 
The chamber pumps 100 percent oxygen 
through the patient’s blood, which stimulates Health center opens with

Some students who live on campus weren’t allowed to re-
main in their dorm rooms in Fall because some were reserved for student athletes after UF’s Yon Hall athletic dorm closed. Students living in a dorm had ﬁ  rst priority of returning to that

 Feb. 24, 2003A group of more than 20 people launched a survey to count

become homeless. Some common reasons included a shortage 
of jobs, health problems and criminal records, which can be a red ﬂ  ag on job applications.

MIAMI BEACH — Paula Deen continued 
maneuvering for a comeback Sunday, turning a beachside cooking demonstration into a public apology for the racist comments that decimated her career last year.
The former Food Network star took the stage 
at the South Beach Wine and Food Festival, and she asked the crowd if they minded if she talked about something serious for a moment. Without explicitly discussing the comments she has admitted making, she said she was glad to be back and “I am not a quitter.”
She told a cheering crowd of several hun-
dred fans, “If anybody did not hear me apolo-
gize, I would like to apologize ...”Last summer, during a legal dispute with 
a former employee who accused her of racial 
discrimination and sexual harassment, she acknowledged having used racial slurs in the 
past. Deen has mostly stayed out of the spot-
light since then, but lately, she has made it clear she wants back in. Earlier this month, she an-nounced that private investment ﬁ  rm Najaﬁ   Companies is investing millions to help her make a comeback.
Before a roaring crowd Sunday, fellow 
celebrity chef Robert Irvine got down on his hands and knees while Deen straddled his back 
and rode him across the stage, a re-enactment 
of a gimmick they’d done during a previous festival.

Gainesville Police arrested former 
Gators football player Deonte Antwon 
Thompson early Saturday morning af-ter ofﬁ  cers found marijuana in the car he was riding in.
Ofﬁ  cers arrested 25-year-old Thomp-
son on charges of possession of a con-trolled substance and possession of drug paraphernalia, according to an ar-rest report.
At about midnight, Thompson was 
riding in car police stopped for not hav-ing its headlights on, according to the report.
When the driver pulled over at the 
1300 block of East University Avenue, the ofﬁ  cer noticed the smell of weed, ac-cording to the report. A records check re-vealed the driver’s license was revoked.
Ofﬁ  cers searched and found a jar in 
a Gucci backpack, which contained four plastic bags ﬁ  lled with about 30 grams of marijuana, according to the report. 
Thompson said he owned the bag 
and described its other contents but said 
the marijuana wasn’t his, according to 
the report. The driver and another pas-senger said the weed was theirs. The passenger said he owned the bag but couldn’t describe its contents, according to the report. All three were taken to the Alachua County Jail.
Thompson was booked at about 1 
a.m. and released the same day after 
meeting a $7,000 bond. Gator football alum arrestedAn officer in the club noticed Shef-
field fighting with a bar patron. The 
shot was fired while the officer at-tempted to break up the scuffle, Tobias said. The officer held Sheffield, the other patron and several bystanders at gunpoint while waiting for backup 
because he didn’t know where the shot 
came from. 
Another fight broke out behind the 
officer and Sheffield used it as a diver-sion to run away, Tobias said. A lieu-tenant called for backup to handle the chaos. Alachua County Sheriff’s depu-ties and University Police soon arrived to help. Responding officers captured Shef-
field outside, Tobias said. An officer found a 9 mm handgun near the scene of the original fight, and police noticed 
a bullet hole in a nearby baseboard. 
However, officers don’t know who the gun belonged to. 
At about 2 a.m., officials sent a UF 
Alert to students, faculty and staff. 
Sinaya Harding, a UF animal sci-
ence and anthropology junior, said she left right before the shot was fired. She said she felt “weird vibes” at the club 
that night. 
“You could tell that a lot of people 
there were not students at all,” the 
20-year-old said. “After a while, we weren’t really feeling it anymore.”4, ALLIGATOR � MONDAY, FEBRUARY 24, 2014

A barefoot Sheila Barksdale stepped onto 
the mat, raised a 3-foot long sword into the air 
and recited poems by Emily Dickinson.
In Barksdale’s demonstration, called “In-
terpreting the Sword,” she shared her passion for painting, poetry and Japanese swords-manship Saturday afternoon at the Archer Community Center.
Scattered among various Aikido martial 
arts movements, Barksdale showed off her paintings and discussed the meanings behind them. She said during the show that Dickin-son’s work and the Aikido art form are linked by their abilities to free the mind.
“Emily Dickinson chose her words very 
carefully,” she said, which was one link to Ai-kido. 
Barksdale said she received her first black 
belt in Aikido last year and has been perform-ing with a Japanese sword, or katana, for about four years.
Thomas Huffman, sensei of Aikido at the 
Unified Training Center, is a black belt in four areas of martial arts and has been prac-ticing for almost 30 years. He said Barksdale is a shodan, or black belt, which signifies that she knows the basics and can begin learning higher practices.
“She’s got enough knowledge that she 
knows what she is doing in these styles,” Huffman said.Artist combines poetry with martial artsABIGAIL DOUPNIK

Outshined by a month that glorifies re-
lationships, February is also Teen Dating 
Violence Awareness Month, and locals ad-
vocates are offering advice to to raise aware-
ness. 
According to the National Institute of 
Justice, 1 in 5 college students has been a 
victim of relationship violence, and 1 in 3 
women will experience a form of relation-ship violence at some point in her lifetime.
Debbie Weiss, University Police victim 
advocate, described the pattern of abuse as 
cyclical, going from a phase of “wooing” to 
violence and then returning to the “wooing” phase to regain the victim’s trust. 
“I have heard many times the bruises will go away, and the scars will heal, but the pain of mental and emotional abuse will last much longer,” she said.
Jennifer Heard, a victim advocate thera-
pist at Alachua County Victim Services and Rape Crisis Center, said she stresses the importance of accessing free counseling of-
fered by local organizations.“You can always call,” she said. “We 
have a 24/7 hotline. It gives opportunities for victims to say, ‘This is what I’m going 
through. I don’t want to go through it any-more, what do I do?’”
UF students have access to Sexual Trau-
ma/Interpersonal Violence Education, known as STRIVE, a peer-education group overseen by GatorWell that works toward the prevention of relationship violence. 
Rita Lawrence, GatorWell interpersonal 
violence prevention coordinator, said the program aims to prevent potentially danger-ous relationships from becoming violent. 
“It’s more of a primary prevention fo-
cus,” she said. “There are a lot of other warning signs you can look for.”Advocates push for dating violence awareness
� IT’S THE WIDEST IN 50 YEARS.
SONIA PORTALUPPI

The earning gap between high school 
and college graduates has stretched to its 
widest level in 50 years.
According to an analysis by the Pew 
Research Center, young adults with high 
school diplomas presently earn 62 percent 
of the typical college graduate’s income, compared with 81 percent in 1965.
The analysis attributes this to the stan-
dardization of college degrees as a require-ment for better-paying jobs.
UF economics professor Steven Slutsky 
said the shift is also due to massive techno-logical changes that occurred after 1965. 
Today’s economy is polarized between 
high- and low-wage work, making col-lege degrees more necessary to get past the wage gap, according to the Pew Research Center’s analysis.
But for degree-seeking students, fi-
nances are a big consideration. About two-thirds of students take out education-relat-ed loans, and 86 percent said they believe it 
will be worth the high price tag, according 
to Pew.
The national average of undergraduate 
college debt is about $29,000, and UF’s av-erage is a little more than $20,000, he said.
Pew researchers found a college degree 
typically yields more inflation-adjusted earnings than before. The analysis also found that young adults with only high 
school diplomas are more likely to live in 
poverty and be dissatisfied with their ca-reer.
David Muir, a 24-year-old UF electri-
cal engineering graduate and co-founder of Kinwa, a mobile design and application company, said getting a college degree helped him start his own business after graduation. Without it, his chances of suc-
cess would’ve been “a lot lower.”
College degrees come with a more for-
mal approach to developing and creating 
things that those without a degree often lack, he said.
“I would definitely consider (hiring 
someone without a college degree), but that decision would be based on an assessment of that person and their portfolio,” he said. Grads’ wage 
gap grows 
GUNSHOT , from page 1No one at Envy was injured It can help heal years-old wounds
the regrowth of damaged blood vessels and 
tissue, Bell said. The device also kills bacteria and infections in order to help chronic wounds heal faster.
The center, which opened last Monday, was 
brought about by the partnership between UF Health and Healogics, the largest wound-care provider in the country.  
In addition to the hyperbaric chambers, the 
facility, located at 3951 NW 48th Terrace in Suite 211, has five exam rooms where patients can receive more traditional treatments — like artificial skin graft replacement. 
The majority of patients who undergo 
treatment at the center are there because of wounds that have not healed within 30 days.  These can stem from a wide variety of causes, including trauma accidents and conditions re-lated to diabetes.“We’re talking about people who have 
wounds that are years old,” said John Caro-line, the center’s medical director, “not months or weeks.”
Wounds like these can become life-threat-
ening because they can increase the likeliness of death in someone who has a severe medical condition such as pancreatic cancer, he said.
In addition to improving the quality of life 
to those afflicted with chronic wounds, Caro-line said the center was established to provide outstanding outpatient care within the UF Health network.
Bell said before the center opened, UF 
Health sent its patients to hospitals outside of its network once they were well enough to leave the hospital. 
“For continuity of care for the patient, it 
makes more sense to keep them in the (UF Health) network,” he said, “and fiscally, in the end, it would too.” HyperbAriC , from page 1“You can always call. We

UF’s Center for Leadership 
and Service received a donation 
of $5,000 from Campus Crest Communities Inc. last week.
The funds will add service-
learning opportunities for stu-dents, said Kara Clayton, area sales manager for Campus Crest.
“While UF has a wide vari-
ety of influential organizations, we decided on the CLS because it shares our commitment to providing students with mean-
ingful service opportunities 
that enhance their academic ex-periences,” Clayton said.
Campus Crest, which is a 
developer, a builder, an owner and manager of student hous-ing properties, is building The Grove, a student-housing com-munity expected to open in time for the 2014-2015 academic year.
CLS is a department under 
UF Student Affairs that pro-vides students with experi-ences to prepare them to create positive sustainable change.
“We’re really looking to cre-
ate social, responsible leaders on UF’s campus,” said Angela Garcia, director of community engagement and service-learn-
ing for CLS. “This donation is 
one way that will help us with the resources to do so.”
CLS Executive Director Josh 
Funderburke wrote in an email that the department is very ex-cited about the donation.
“We hope to see a great deal 
of additional partnerships like 
this in support of that mission 
and to further emphasize the importance of student commu-nity engagement,” he said.MONDAY, FEBRUARY 24, 2014 � ALLIGATOR, 5

More than 1,300 volunteers 
came together during the week-
end to help renovate Sidney 
Lanier Center as part of the sev-
enth annual Project Makeover, a student-run nonprofit organiza-tion that renovates one Alachua 
County school each year.
This year, the center was cho-
sen to receive a makeover of ev-
erything from its hallways to the playground.
Project Executive Director 
Courtney Miller, a 22-year-old UF psychology senior, said the organization traditionally up-
dates elementary schools but 
shifted the focus this year to the center, a school for students with special needs from ages 3 to 22. Miller said the difference 
in schools changed the way the 
organization approached proj-ects.
“We are trying to incorporate 
murals and things that are ap-propriate to all the different age groups within that span,” Miller said. “We’ve done some (mu-rals) that are geared toward pre-
school-age students all the way 
to murals that are very much interactive murals for learning.”
Although the actual school 
renovation only took place over the span of a weekend, the orga-nization fundraised year-round for the makeover.
This year, Miller said the 
project was able to raise about $12,000 for the Sidney Lanier Center makeover between fund-raising events and partnerships with local businesses.
External fundraising direc-
tor Katie Burns, a 21-year-old UF public relations junior, said the makeover itself is generally divided into three areas: mu-
rals and art, landscaping and a 
“dream project” specifically re-quested by the school.  
“Every school presents us 
with a project that they want to see done,” Burns said. “This year, we are redoing the library entirely.”
Project Makeover held a re-
veal ceremony Sunday to debut the newly renovated school to students and teachers.
Mitch Zyserman, a 22-year-
old UF political science senior, volunteered with Project Make-over for the first time this year and said his favorite part of the 
weekend was seeing the school 
change.
“To see it transformed … 
now, seeing the murals every-
where, seeing the trees and 
plants and little side touches — that’s the coolest thing,” he said.Volunteers rally to give school a makeover Company

A local coffee shop owner is rising above 
the daily grind.
Anthony Rue, owner of Volta Coffee, Tea 
& Chocolate, became certified earlier this 
month to judge the annual World Barista 
Competition in Rimini, Italy. 
To become certified, Rue said he took 
two days worth of exams, including a coffee history test and a 100-question competition rules test.
“I was the only everyday, behind-the-bar 
barista taking that exam. Most are coffee 
buyers or roasters,” said 51-year-old Rue, who has participated in the competition be-fore.
Competitors will serve the judges one 
espresso, one cappuccino and one signature drink within a 15-minute period. Judges 
have to be able to measure the coffee’s acid-
ity and determine the coffee’s origin. 
Six years ago, Rue opened the store after 
traveling the country. Opening Volta was like graduate school for him, he said.
Shop employees and regulars notice his 
passion for the craft.
Yarrow Geggus, a 24-year-old Volta 
barista and baker, said she enjoys working with Rue because of his expertise.
“He just has encyclopedic knowledge 
about coffee, and he is totally self-taught,” she said.
Though Rue said he is well-traveled, he 
has never been to Italy, the location for this year’s World Barista Competition.
“I was excited when I found out,” he said. 
“It’s an incredible honor.”Volta owner to judge annual barista competition

This year’s Florida Experimental Film/
Video Festival brought six different inter-
national curators for its 10th anniversary this weekend.
The festival ran Friday through Sunday 
at the Wooly event space in downtown Gainesville to screen experimental films from all over the world.
The curators presented programs from their respective cities – Montreal, Paris, London, Tokyo, Mexico City and Berlin, said FLEX artistic director Roger Beebe.
“It was great to be able to get six dif-
ferent curators this year because we gener-ally only have three locals or one interna-tional,” he said.
Curator Daïchi Sanïto kicked off 
FLEXfest Friday night with a presentation of film, video and installation artists from Montreal’s Double Negative collective, which seeks to locate cinema in human ex-perience. 
Afterward, Sally Golding, of London, 
demonstrated a live cinema performance. 
Saturday included a roundtable discus-
sion with the curators, films by Tokyo cu-rator Rei Hayama and a performance by 
Mexico City’s Trinchera Ensamble. 
The festival ended Sunday with another 
discussion and films and videos selected 
by Berlin curator Guillaume Cailleau and Sébastien Ronceray, of Paris.
UF students and Gainesville residents 
attended the festival. 
Alexandria Dasilva, a 20-year-old UF 
art sophomore, said this was her first year attending the event.
“The experimental film really opened 
up my eyes to something different,” she said. “I’m really excited to start making my own films.”
Dasilva’s reaction is reminiscent of what 
Beebe said is the organization’s goal. 
He said FLEX exists to inspire the au-
dience members to make their own ex-perimental films after they’ve attended the festival.
“The best thing is to inspire and devel-
op an audience,” Beebe said. “We want to help them develop a taste. It’s like planting a seed that we hope will grow into trees.” Experimental film festival highlights international curators
It included live performances“To see it transformed 
… now, seeing the murals 
everywhere, seeing the 
trees and plants and little 
side touches — that’s the 
coolest thing.”

Vote or post a message at www.alligator.orgFriday’s question: Would you drive a 
peanut truck?Today’s question: Do you feel safe at Midtown?Wednesday night I found myself licking lube off 
my ﬁ  ngers in a classroom full of people.
Let me explain. Last week was Pride Student 
Union’s Sexxx Week, which included sex-related events each day. On Wednesday night, there was a safe-sex workshop, and the employees of X-Mart, a local adult su-percenter, came to speak about sex toys.
So on the night in question, I felt my ﬁ  rst dildo, my 
ﬁ  rst vibrator and my ﬁ  rst strap-on harness. And yes, I tasted my ﬁ  rst ﬂ  avored lubricant.
Sex toys have been on my radar for a long time, but 
I’ve never actually considered buying or using one my-self.
I asked myself why this was, and this is the best expla-
nation I could come up with: It’s embarrassing to admit that I want the help of an inanimate object or a battery-powered machine rather than, say, a living human being.
So, now I have a confession to make: I went to X-Mart 
this weekend. OK, I’ll be honest — I went to X-Mart twice this weekend.
Why is it important for me to admit that? Because there 
is still a big social stigma attached to going to a sex shop, as well as buying a sex toy and using it.
I was talking to a friend about X-Mart, and he said he 
had gone before. But he had the mentality that he need-ed to hide and wear a big hat and sunglasses, like it was shameful to be looking at sex toys.
People! It’s not something to be ashamed of.People spend more than $15 billion a year on sex toys, 
according to sex toy website Adam & Eve. Clearly toys are popular, so why aren’t we talking about them?
Just like with anything sex-related, it is important to 
start a dialogue. Talking about sex toys in an open man-ner can help make them a normal part of life, not some-thing to hide in your nightstand drawer.
I’ll start. Although I haven’t bought a sex toy yet — I’m 
a poor college student, and I can’t justify spending my grandfather’s Christmas money on a G-spot vibrator — I deﬁ  -nitely intend to.
And you know what? I plan 
on using that toy by myself, with my partners and in any situation possible.
If you do plan on using a sex 
toy with your partner, you need to discuss that ﬁ  rst. College 
Magazine says “sex toys also have the potential to spice up your long-term relationship.” 
If you and your partner have been stuck in a rut, it 
might help to try something new, whether through bond-age, anal beads or using a glass dildo on each other.
When he spoke at the event, the manager of X-Mart, 
Sam, mentioned that communication is important when you use sex toys in a relationship. Make sure you and your partner are comfortable and that you have a safe-word if whatever you are doing requires it.
If you don’t have a partner to use your sex toy with, 
that’s OK, too. You guys already know how I feel about masturbation. It’s great, everybody should do it, and it’s nothing to be ashamed of. I feel the same way about mas-turbating with sex toys.
If you do plan on buying a sex toy, I recommend talk-
ing to a sex shop employee or reading reviews online — my favorite website is Oh Joy, Sex Toy — to make sure that the speciﬁ  c toy is what you are looking for. 
College is the perfect time to explore the realm of sex 
toys. The cliche that college students experiment with sex more than any other demographic is a cliche for a reason, so embrace that and hold your head high when you walk into a sex shop.
Happy sex-toy shopping, folks!Robyn Smith is a UF journalism sophomore. Her columns 
appear on Mondays.Toy story: In the defense of sex toysCrowdfunding: 
How to succeed in 
business without 
really trying
If the creation of the much-anticipated “Veronica Mars” mov-
ie has proven anything, it’s that people are willing to crowd-fund a good idea. However, a new phenomenon arose with 
the advent of crowdfunding: struggling business owners taking to online fundraising websites to plead customers to help them 
through rough times. 
Some of these fundraising campaigns make sense. For ex-
ample, the Hippodrome State Theatre introduced its “The Hipp 
Goes Digital” campaign in July to raise money for the theater’s purchase of a digital projector. Since more and more ﬁ  lms are being produced only in digital cinema packages, theaters with analog projectors have struggled to adjust to the digital revolu-tion — kind of like when Game Boy Color cartridges became harder to ﬁ  nd once Game Boy Advance came out.
The Hippodrome is a Florida landmark, so Gainesville resi-
dents were happy to donate to the cause. As a result, the com-munity receives high-quality screenings of current art ﬁ  lms. Everybody wins, and the event was less of a charity campaign and more of a business transaction. Hippodrome customers purchased the equipment so they could then beneﬁ  t from the new equipment. 
When Gainesville’s beloved independent video store, Video 
Rodeo, hit a rough patch in 2005, crowdfunding wasn’t yet the 
option it is today. According to the ad archives on its website, 
Video Rodeo workers took to the Internet to let customers know it wasn’t turning a proﬁ  t. In turn, community support kept the business aﬂ  oat. Now, it’s expanded to a used bookstore as well as a resource for ﬁ  lm buffs whose tastes go beyond the same 20 or so movies available inside a Redbox at any given time. 
This is why we’re dubious of the Midnight’s fundraiser 
through Fundly. The Midnight, a small bar in downtown Gainesville, is pleading its customers to donate money to help 
the owners pay off debt. 
The Midnight’s owners have no formal business training, ac-
cording to the Fundly page. They’re not asking for much, and 
their goal of raising $1,800 is close to being met. 
However, crowdsourcing debt is, quite simply, a bad busi-
ness practice. If a business is failing, then clearly there’s some-thing wrong with its product or its management. And anyway, how do customers beneﬁ  t by propping up a business that has to ask for donations? That’s what sales revenue is for.
Although the Hippodrome and Video Rodeo relied on com-
munity support through tough times, we’re skeptical about the idea of business crowdfunding. Businesses aren’t charities. They rely on transactions, and the creation and sale of a prod-uct. When Video Rodeo struggled, it let its customers know. It didn’t ask for money with no strings attached. It simply asked for business. Additionally, the Hippodrome and Video Rodeo 
both provide a product of cultural value: art. 
The Midnight’s product, however, can be found just about 
every ﬁ  ve paces in Gainesville.

In the age of cable news, political blogs 
and social media, it’s easy to focus on the political news in Washington, D.C. The 
noise clogs the pores of all three major cable news networks and permeates throughout the front pages of newspapers until it makes its way onto the web. 
Ignore the noise coming from Washing-
ton, and start looking at what’s happening in state legislatures across the country. That’s where the action is, and in recent weeks, some of the bills pushed by legislators are downright scary. 
Several states — including Arizona, 
Oklahoma, South Dakota and Tennessee — are pushing bills that would strengthen religious freedoms and essentially allow discrimination on the basis of that religious freedom. It sounds simple enough: An in-dividual cannot have his or her freedoms stripped based on religion. On the surface, the bill sounds downright American. 
Sadly, the religious freedom bills are not 
attempts to protect people’s rights to prac-tice a religion. Instead, it allows for discrimi-nation.
Need an example?Say a restaurant owner 
doesn’t want to serve a gay or lesbian couple in his or her restaurant. Guess what? The religious freedom bills would legally allow that restaurant owner to kick them out based on his or her religious views.
Yes, states throughout the 
country are debating measures that would legalize discrimination. 
Need further examples of just how far 
state governments are going? Take a look at our neighbor to the north. 
Just this year, Republican-led Georgia 
has ﬁ  led or passed a religious freedom bill; a bill to completely prevent the Affordable Care Act from taking effect in the state; several bills and resolutions calling on the country to have a Constitutional convention — something that hasn’t happened since the original convention; a bill that would allow guns in churches, bars and many govern-ment buildings. And just last week, a bill was ﬁ  led that would allow sex offenders into Georgia schools.
In Kansas, after years of cutting pub-lic education funding, some parents had enough and sued the state, claiming the state’s constitution mandated public schools receive adequate fund-ing. The case made its way to the state Supreme Court, which is expected to decide on the case soon.
What happens if the court sides with the 
parents and forces the state to fund public schools?
Republican Gov. Sam Brownback and the 
conservative-dominated Legislature plan to ignore the ruling and subsequently pass leg-islation preventing the state’s court system from making decisions on education. 
Even here in Florida — another state run 
by the Republicans — controversy almost al-ways emanates from the Capitol walls in Tal-lahassee. Just last month, legislators started pushing a self-defense bill that would allow those who feel threatened to ﬁ  re a warning shot in the air. As if the stand your ground law wasn’t enough, now we might have the chance to ﬁ  re off a round, Wild-West style. 
Single-party rule dominates state legisla-tures across the country. As of 2012, 36 states had single-party rule. And in many states led by Republicans, we are seeing increas-ingly conservative legislation that seems downright brazen. 
It’s easy to ignore our state Legislature. 
Heck, most of us are lucky if we can name our state representative or our state senator, let alone identify them both. Regardless of whether we realize it, state legislatures have far more control over us than federal Con-gress. The news might convince you oth-erwise, but Congress didn’t pass the stand your ground law. The Florida Legislature did. And it’s not the U.S. Congress trying to pass a bill, so business owners can le-gally discriminate and use their religion as a shield. State legislatures are doing that. 
So next time you start railing on how aw-
ful D.C. can be, and why we need to ﬁ  re ev-eryone in Congress, maybe you should take a look at your state legislature ﬁ  rst. What they’re trying to do is far more frightening than anything happening in Washington.

Hundreds of Gators joined Saturday on Flavet 
Field to race through campus and be pelted with 
orange and blue dust at The Gator Run.
During the 5-kilometer race, runners passed 
through a blue or orange zone every kilometer. The race used about 215 gallons of the cornstarch-based powder paint in total. 
Ashley Dean, a 22-year-old UF accounting senior 
and a Gator Run programming director, said the 
most beneficial factor of the race is the outcome. 
Proceeds from the run benefit the Alumni As-
sociation, as well as the university in its efforts to 
become a top 10 public university, Dean said. The event also helped raise funds for art and music sup-plies for the UF Health Child Life Program. 
“Unlike any run on campus, it’s to better both 
our university and our students,” Dean said. “As 
the ranking of the university increases in the nation, 
the value of our diploma goes up.”
Renee Gomez, a 20-year-old UF microbiology 
and cell science junior, said despite the color pow-der being hard to wash off, the event was a fun, and 
he will be back next year. 
“In regular races … you just follow the signs. 
With this run it was really motivational because 
you have people all along the court being excited,” 
Gomez said. “(It) makes you run faster.”
This was the group’s second Gator Run. The first 
was hosted in January of last year.Gators pelted with colored cornstarch at Gator Run

The Gators traveled to Ox-
ford, Miss., with the memory 
of Marshall Henderson’s 
Gator chomping spectacle on 
their minds.
But after days of watching 
the candid guard’s celebra-tion from Ole Miss’ victory against Florida in last year’s 
Southeastern Conference 
Tournament final on repeat in their locker room, the Gators finally exacted their revenge 
on the Rebels on Saturday af-
ternoon.
Despite allowing Hen-
derson to score 22 points on 7-of-14 shooting by halftime, No. 2 Florida (25-2, 14-0 SEC) held him scoreless on 0-of-6 second-half shooting to win 
75-71 in the Tad Smith Coli-
seum.
“We played a much bet-
ter second half,” coach Billy 
Donovan said. “Henderson 
made some really, really dif-ficult, tough shots, to his credit. But there were a cou-ple times we did not guard 
him correctly and didn’t do 
the right things, and we let him get going.”
Henderson put on a show 
in the first half and carried the Rebels (16-11, 7-7 SEC) of-fensively by making 5 of his 11 three-point attempts in the contest’s first 20 minutes. 
The senior scored six 
straight points — notching a four-point play and then an open layup after a steal from Derrick Millinghaus in the backcourt — to make it even 
at 24-24 with 9:06 in the first 
half.

13 from downtown in the first 
half, then finished the half on

Beating a top-five team in its house is a tall 
order. Against No. 4 South Carolina, it was for 
Florida.
Literally. On Sunday afternoon, the Gamecocks im-
posed their statures on the Gators, handing them a 69-55 loss. 
Florida showed great effort throughout the 
game, but the height discrepancy was too much to overcome. 
“The reality matched what we thought,” 
coach Amanda Butler said. 
“We knew they were big and they played 
big.”  
In the first half, Florida fell victim to South 
Carolina’s block party in Colonial Life Arena. 
South Carolina was ahead 32-22 at halftime 
and had registered eight blocks. Four of them came from 6-foot-4 freshman Alaina Coates, who was also the Gamecocks’ leading scorer at halftime with nine points. 
“It was very, very, very 
physical in the paint,” Butler said. “We just got to be able to handle that better, regard-less of whether the whistle’s blown or not.” 
“I thought we had a lot of 
fight, a lot of toughness from some individuals; ultimate-
ly, not enough toughness all 
the way across the board and not enough pos-
sessions.”
Florida was 8 for 32 from the field at the end 
of the half and found itself at a disadvantage in every major statistical category, except turn-overs. AP Photo

No. 23 Florida (5-3) took a step for-
ward on Sunday, salvaging its road se-ries against No. 16 Miami (4-3) with a 6-4 victory Sunday afternoon at Mark Light Field. 
Whitson went three innings, and six 
other pitchers followed, including three freshman get-ting action on the road.
“We’re young. 
We’re not nearly a finished product yet.,” coach  Kevin O’Sullivan said. “We got a lot of work to do. I do like the fight we showed today. This is one game. Hope-fully, we look back down the road and say that kind of got us going.”

There are two names on the 
Florida gymnastics roster that 
will send a crowd into a frenzy — Kytra Hunter and Bridget Sloan.
Hunter, who scored a perfect 
10 on vault, and Sloan led No. 2 
UF (7-0, 5-0 Southeastern Con-
ference) on Friday as it defeated No. 3 LSU (7-3, 3-2 SEC) 198.125-197.625.
Coming into Friday’s meet, the 
Gators faced the challenge of beat-ing one of the top teams in the na-tion, which has also recorded its own perfect scores of the season.
LSU’s Rheagan Courville came 
into the matchup earning a 10 on the vault at Arkansas on Feb. 7. Courville was also the reigning SEC Gymnast of the Week af-
ter she tied the nation’s best all-
around score, and UF gymnast Bridget Sloan’s, with a 39.750.
Friday, the O’Connell Center 
was packed with 9,197 roaring fans who were rewarded with an eventful night.
Hunter was one of the ath-
letes to make the night one to re-member when she started out the 
matchup by scoring her second 
consecutive 10 on vault.
It was the junior’s fourth per-
fect score of the year. 
With her 10, UF has posted a 
perfect score in each of its last five meets. Hunter’s vault and a solid performance from five other Flor-
ida gymnasts in the event helped Florida top their season-best vault 
with a score of 49.525. It was the eighth highest in Florida history.
Hunter said that her practices 
have become more focused on sticking her vault landings.
“Honestly, since last week I’ve 
been getting these stuck landings in practice,” Hunter said. 
“I mean, I won’t move on from 
vault unless I get two perfect stuck landings.”
However, Hunter wasn’t alone 
in her success. 
Sloan also had a momentous 
night, winning the all-around ti-tle for the week and putting up a near-perfect 9.95 on floor.
“It doesn’t matter (about) the 
scoring. It’s all about how you feel, and after floor, I felt amaz-ing,” Sloan said. “My first pass 
was great, my second pass was 
the best second pass I’ve ever done in my life, and those are the little moments you need to cher-ish.”
Even with a strong vault per-
formance, Florida fell behind af-ter the uneven bars rotation. But 
it was UF’s near-perfect floor rou-tines and a series of sloppy beam 
routines by LSU that propelled the Gators above the Tigers.
“It definitely pushes us, and 
we honestly need that pressure especially experiencing it now be-fore post-season,” Hunter said.
“They did a wonderful job, 
and we gave each other compe-tition. That what makes it so fun and makes the score so tight and makes the audience even more excited to watch us.”

Although the Gators are no longer the same 
team of years past, one that lived and died by the 
three-point shot, they were forced to turn back the clocks Saturday and rely on perimeter shooting to pull out a four-point Southeastern Conference win on the road.
With Ole Miss’ Marshall Henderson sinking 
five first-half three pointers, Florida answered 
with a season-high eight threes before the break. 
Despite Henderson’s hot start to the contest, 
the rest of the Rebels only combined for one made 
three during the first half. On the other hand, the 
Gators distributed the points more evenly — four 
players hit at least one from behind the arc.
“I thought that was huge,” coach Billy Donovan 
said. “I thought that was maybe the biggest stat in the first half.”
Scottie Wilbekin and Michael Frazier II, who 
combine for just more than 70 percent of Florida’s three-point field goals, recorded two and three three-pointers, respectively, during the game’s 
first 20 minutes. 
But their five combined baskets from three-
point range only matched what Henderson did 
alone.
If it wasn’t for DeVon Walker and Dorian 
Finney-Smith adding three more, the Gators could have been facing a much more daunting task head-ing into the locker room.
“If you in the first half, instead of making eight 
(three pointers), you end up making three, you’re probably talking about being down double-dig-its,” Donovan said. 
“So even with Henderson going crazy in the 
first half, it was kind of a wash, him versus our 
team.”
However, in four of the six games prior to visit-
ing Ole Miss, Florida players not named Wilbekin 
and Frazier were 0 of 22 from beyond the perim-
eter.
In fact, Finney-Smith was 0 for his last 21 three-point shots coming into Saturday’s matchup. The 
redshirt sophomore hadn’t made a three-point 
shot since the Gators’ 62-51 victory over Missis-
sippi State on Jan. 30.
During the six-game stretch before Ole Miss, 
when it wasn’t Wilbekin or Frazier knocking down threes, it was Walker.
The 6-foot-6 guard has taken advantage of his 
more frequent time on the court with Kasey Hill out with a groin injury. 
In his previous two games, Walker was 4 of 
9 from three. And even with a full roster against 
Tennessee on Feb. 11, Donovan played Walker 
for eight minutes and was rewarded with 2-of-2 shooting from beyond the arc.
Before this four-game stretch where Walker 
combined for six three-pointers, the sophomore re-
corded only eight in the 20 games prior to Feb. 11.
Frazier said his team answered Henderson’s 
first-half performance by fighting fire with fire. If 
the Rebels were going to come out firing against 
the Gators’ press, then Donovan’s squad was going 
to do the same against Ole Miss’ zone defense.
“When they have a guy like that, you got to 
have three-point threats on the other team to kind of balance it out,” Frazier said. 
Donovan added that it’s not the individual tal-
ent that separates this team from others in the past, but it’s the chemistry with one another and realiza-tion that each player is only a piece of the puzzle.
“I think that they understand that for us the 
whole is greater than our parts,” Donovan said. “And I like that about us.”MONDAY, FEBRUARY 24, 2014 � ALLIGATOR, 13

UF gymnast an 18-8 run to tie it up at 42 
at halftime. It was the sixth straight game Florida had ei-
ther trailed or stood tied with 
an opponent at halftime.
But in the second half, 
Florida tightened up defen-
sively and contained Hen-
derson and the Rebels’ hot shooting.
After about 14 minutes 
of action that did not see a 
team lead by more than three 
points, Florida began to pull away. 
Fueled by a dunk from Pat-
ric Young, a jumper by Casey Prather and three made free throws — two coming from Young — Florida went on a 7-0 run to take a 66-59 lead 
with 4:08 left. Following the 
8:04 mark, UF held Ole Miss scoreless for about four min-utes.
But with 3:12 remaining 
in regulation, Michael Frazi-er II gave UF its largest lead (71-63) since the first half by burying a three-pointer 
from the right wing. Scottie 
Wilbekin then sunk a runner down the right lane on the next possession to give UF a 
comfortable 73-65 advantage 
with 2:25 left.
“We did a good job of ex-
ecuting offensively,” Dono-van said. 
“Scottie had a nice runner 
in the lane, which was good. We did some good inte-rior passing. Patric knocked 
down his free throws. It was 
good to see him do that.”Wilbekin led the way with 
18 points on 6-of-12 shoot-ing and seven assists against five turnovers, while Frazier 
added 17 points on 5-of-10 
three-point shooting.
Florida’s 25-2 start to the 
year is its best in school his-
tory, and its 19th straight win 
continues a school record. After Saturday’s win, the Gators are in good position to be ranked No. 1 in today’s 
AP poll for the first time since 
February 2007.
UF plays its next game on 
the road in Nashville, Tenn., against Vanderbilt on Tues-day night at 7.
“This is a hard stretch for 
us,” Donovan said. 
“When you talk about 
having to play Wednesday, Saturday, Tuesday, you go a long period of time without a break and it’s one game af-
ter another. And it’s games 
against teams we haven’t seen before, so there’s a lot to get these guys familiar with.”
A radio broadcast contrib-
uted to this report.Senior Jaterra Bonds led the way 
at the half with 10 points, but the 
Gators’ bench of January Miller, Antoinette Bannister and Lily Svete were held scoreless. 
More of the same continued into 
the second half. 
The Gamecocks jumped out to 
their biggest lead of the game, 46-30, with 12:54 remaining in the half. 
Thanks to the efforts of redshirt junior Kayla Lewis and Bonds, the Gators rallied back into striking dis-tance, closing the gap to seven points with 1:43 left on the clock. 
Lewis was one rebound shy of 
recording a double-double, scoring 15 points and grabbing nine boards. 
Bonds led the team with 20 points 
and a 9-for-14 effort from the field. 
“She did as she typically does: 
exactly what we ask her to do,” But-ler said of Bonds.  “That was just to be aggressive and to attack the 
rim fearlessly with no hesitation. 
They’ve got great shot blockers on their team.
“I think the way that Jaterra 
played was her following game plan really well.”
Coates was perhaps the most 
impressive player of the game. For the contest, she was a perfect 5 for 5 
from the field, scoring 16 points. She 
also registered 12 boards and five blocks. 
Although the Gators struggled 
on offense, the defense was a bright spot on Sunday. 
“I thought we defended them 
in the paint very well,” Butler said. “Where they outsized us, we were 
able to limit those guys’ touches 
pretty well. We played great team defense in the paint. There were just some other spots where we really let down.”
Florida also forced 18 turnovers. 
The Gators scored 16 points off turn-overs compared to South Carolina’s three. 
“It wasn’t necessarily something 
we thought we could really exploit,” Butler said. “It was just something that developed throughout the game, and we tried to pursue that game trend.”
Florida, now at .500 in the SEC, 
needs to win at least one of its final two games against tough conference 
opponents Vanderbilt and No. 16 
Texas A&M. 
In order to make the NCAA 
Tournament, Florida would most likely have to finish in the top half of the SEC and maintain at least a .500 record in conference play.

Shortstop records two hits in win
Andrew Suarez warm up in the right-field bullpen. 
He and his assistant coaches thought one thing see-ing his knee-high locations and four quality pitches: This guy is a big leaguer.
The Toronto Blue Jays selected Suarez in 2011 — 
a year after Whitson went ninth overall to the San Diego Padres. With a who’s who of scouts on hand, the Gators’ redshirt junior tossed 30 of his 54 pitches for strikes. 
His fastball touched 92 mph, but he never looked 
comfortable with his slider, which carried him to a freshman All-American season in 2011. 
This marked his second start since returning from 
his Spring 2013 season-ending shoulder surgery. He went two innings against Maryland a week ago. 
Whitson feels like his arm strength is back. The 
next step is improving command, which troubled him on Sunday. 
“Missing some time you’re going to be a little 
rusty,” Whitson said. “You’ve got to go. You got to keep going and get better everyday.”
Florida gradually improved from Game 1 to 
Game 3. Suarez, who missed all of 2012 with shoulder sur-
gery, allowed six runs, four earned, over seven in-nings. The Gators tagged Suarez right from the early afternoon start, plating four runs on six hits — three singles, two doubles and a triple in the first inning. 
Led by Richie Martin’s two base hits, including a 
leadoff double down the right-field line, the Gators attacked Suarez in the first. Florida added two un-earned runs in the fourth inning off two Miami throwing errors by third baseman David Thompson 
and catcher Garrett Kennedy.
The Hurricanes’ defense did it in on Sunday and 
could have given them issues in the rest of the series 
had they not hit six home runs during the weekend.
Florida showed more discipline in the field, com-
mitting only one error in the three games.
O’Sullivan and Co. found a way in the finale — 
even if it meant throwing the kitchen sink at the Hurricanes. O’Sullivan needed seven pitchers, four 
first-inning runs, two Miami errors and three differ-
ent arms in the ninth inning.
“We were going to empty everybody. That’s one 
of our strengths,”  O’Sullivan said. 
“We told the players before the game, the mark of 
a gritty team is to get out with a win no matter how we got to do it.”bASE , from page 12hoopS , from page 12Gators’ 19-game streak

No. 7 Florida’s (4-1) offense 
prevailed against a sleepy Cincin-
nati (0-2) defense after a three-and-
a-half-hour rain delay at Donald R. Dizney Stadium to win 19-6 on Sunday.
In their last three games, the 
Gators have exploited bad defen-sive matchups, giving them op-portunities to secure wins early in matches.
Florida’s victory against Cincin-
nati was no different.
Freshman Sammi Burgess and 
sophomore Devon Schneider com-bined for the first goal to open the 
scoring.
Florida’s movement on offense 
left its defense nearly jobless, as it 
has been in most of its games this season. 
The defense has had only two 
real opportunities to compete on the field  — the first time in a 20-8 loss to No. 1 North Carolina and the second in a 21-8 blowout win 
against James Madison.
Florida’s speed — exemplified 
by Burgess, junior Shannon Gilroy 
and sophomore Carly Ross — has been the key reason why the de-
fense has had little to do on the 
field.
Cincinnati’s mismatched de-
fense proved to be just one of the 
Bearcats’ many problems. Cincin-nati came out playing man-to-man coverage against Florida but was unable to keep up with the offense that the Gators have worked to 
create this season.
Coach Amanda O’Leary said 
that the team’s quickness has been key in the offense’s smoothness, especially when players can out-
run their defenders.
Overall, the offense beat Cin-cinnati everywhere it mattered, 
specifically on draw controls (22-
5), shots (32-13) and ground balls 
(16-12).It was sophomore Sam Darcan-
gelo’s day to shine. The midfielder 
was one of the many offensive 
players for Florida that was able to 
outrun the Bearcats defense. 
Darcangelo posted a career high 
of four points and had four draw 
controls. While the Freeland, Md., 
native has been solid for UF on the 
draw circle, picking up a season 
total of six ground balls and nine draw controls, she quickly became 
the Bearcats defense’s worst night-
mare as she took shot after shot 
against it.
“I just felt like I could see the 
ball,” Darcangelo said. “It felt 
easier for me to see it today than 
usual.”
However, Florida’s offense 
wasn’t perfect.
The Gators played well in all 
aspects of the game, with the ex-ception of one. Florida found itself 
turning the ball over eight times in 
the first half and three times in the second.
“I think those turnovers are 
things we’ve been working on day 
in and day out,” O’Leary said. 
“It’s just being smart and for 
us it’s taking good opportunities 
offensively as well as coming up 
defensively when the ball is on the 
ground.”Gators’ speed proves too much for overmatched Bearcats
Swimming and diving
LOGAN MCGUIRE

For the second consecutive year, the 
Southeastern Conference crown belongs to 
the top-ranked Gators men’s swimming and diving team.
Florida led off the meet strong, winning 
the first five swimming events at the confer-ence championships on Day 1 and 2, but still trailed No. 13 Auburn after the second day of competition.
The Gators relied on their strengths over 
the final three days to defend the title.
Redshirt senior Sebastien Rousseau 
earned his first individual SEC champion-ship in the 200-yard individual medley (1:42.22) on Day 2 and seemed to like wear-ing gold, as he went on to win the 200-yard freestyle (1:33.23) and the 200-yard butterfly 
(1:41.07) over the next two days. 
“It means a lot to me to finally get an in-
dividual win,” Rousseau said. “It was really 
special to be on the podium with Marcin (Cieslak). He is always going to be there and be pushing me. We do that in practice, and I knew that it was going to be like that in the race. It just comes down to the day. I got my hand on the wall this time.”
 Cielsak was less than a quarter of a sec-
ond behind Rousseau in the 200-yard IM, good enough for a silver medal. Fewer than 0.7 seconds separated them in the 200-yard fly, but Cieslak — the 2013 SEC Champion in the event — finished with a bronze.
Rousseau’s 200-yard fly time was an SEC 
Championships record, and he was award-ed the SEC Commissioner’s Trophy for the highest point total.
Florida broke two school records on Day 
1: in the 200-yard medley relay (1:24.53), which Cieslak swam the fly leg for, and in the 800-yard free relay (6:13.03) that Rous-seau swam in.
“It is such a tremendous swim meet,” 
coach Gregg Troy said. “Winning the first time was really great. Coming back to have the opportunity to repeat, I think, talks a little bit about the character of the team and the guys.”
The No. 5 Florida’s women’s team did 
not make the push they needed to overtake 
four-time defending champion No. 1 Geor-
gia, which clinched its fifth SEC champion-ship in as many years. The Gators fell to third on Day 4 and would end up with the bronze medal.
But senior Elizabeth Beisel picked up two 
gold medals and a silver medal along with her third straight SEC Commissioner’s Tro-phy. Her nine individual titles rank her fifth 
all-time in SEC titles for the Gators and ties 
her with Olympian Dara Torres.

UF men clinch SEC Championship, women finish third
� UF LOST 7-0 ON SUNDAY.

The San Francisco Bay separates 
St. Mary’s College and Stanford 
University from each other.
The level of talent between the 
two teams covers a much greater 
distance.
The gap between Florida’s two 
Californian opponents was evident 
this past weekend, when UF swept St. Mary’s on Saturday and then found themselves on the wrong side of a Stanford sweep the fol-lowing day. 
The No. 5 Gators (8-2) were 
held scoreless in Sunday’s rivalry matchup against the No. 3 Cardinal (7-0), losing 7-0 in their first match against a top-five opponent.
“Stanford really took it to us and 
all credit goes to them,” coach Ro-land Thornqvist said. “It was over 
after 20 minutes of singles. I’m at a 
loss.”
The day began with more incon-
sistent play on the doubles courts as Florida lost both doubles match-es for the third time in its last five dual matches. After falling behind early, a comeback was unlikely. The Gators are 1-2 this season when losing the doubles point.
Sofie Oyen and Belinda Wool-
cock fell 8-5, and Olivia Janowicz and Stefani Stojic lost 8-1 to cede the match’s first point to the highly touted Stanford group.
The defending NCAA champi-
ons remained aggressive as they 
grabbed each of the three neces-
sary singles points in straight sets to crush Florida’s comeback hopes.
The Cardinal’s Carol Zhao put 
her team ahead 2-0 with a 6-1, 6-3 victory over Brianna Morgan. The Gators’ Oyen and Alexandra Cer-cone were the next to fall, losing 6-2, 6-2 and 6-1, 6-4 respectively to give Stanford a 4-0 lead and the match.
Stanford’s next point came when 
No. 5 ranked Kristie Ahn outlasted 
a comeback bid from Janowicz with 
a 6-2, 7-5 victory.
The deficit grew to six when 
Kourtney Keegan lost 6-3, 7-6. Woolcock was the only Florida player to reach a third set, but she 
eventually folded under a 6-7, 6-4, 1-0 (10-9) loss to end the match.
UF’s weekend matches were 
polar opposites of each other. The 
loss to Stanford came a day after Florida’s 4-0 win over St. Mary’s on the same courts, in which each Gator won in straight sets during the blowout. On Sunday, all but one player was defeated in straight 
sets, as Florida was held scoreless 
for the first time all season.
“Stanford is a great team and 
they certainly played well enough to earn the win,” Thornqvist said. 
“We have a lot to work on after 
today’s match and it will make us stronger as a result.”

Florida’s lone home tourna-
ment of the season was cut short.
All the games slated for Day 
3 of the Lipton Invitational were 
canceled due to rain.
Through the first two days at 
Katie Seashole Pressly Stadium, 
No. 1 Florida (16-0) played two 
games against Troy and Indiana, winning all four by a combined score of 26-3.
The Gators found the majority 
of their success in the pitcher’s cir-cle, giving up only 10 hits through the four games while striking out a combined 27 batters.
“The main thing you have to 
do is make sure you’re giving ev-erybody enough innings to keep them sharp,” coach Tim Walton said. “The rotation has been good. 
We’re not over-pitching anybody. 
We’re giving everybody an op-portunity to throw complete games, but what (Lauren) Haeger 
and Hannah (Rogers) and Delanie 
(Gourley) have been doing is fan-tastic. They’re really using their defense and getting strikeouts when they need to.”
Rogers pitched two shutouts 
in the tournament, including her third career solo no-hitter in the Gators’ 8-0 five-inning win 
against the Hoosiers on Saturday, 
improving her record to 6-0.
In her home debut, Gourley 
continued the success she showed in her first four starts. In Florida’s 
3-1 win against Indiana on Friday, 
the freshman left-handed pitcher gave up only four hits while strik-ing out a career-high nine bat-ters. On the season, Gourley has a strikeout-to-walk ratio of 3.44:1 and is holding batters to a .196 clip through her first five games.
“Delanie made pitches when 
she had to,” Walton said. “Other than a couple of the infield hits, I thought she really pitched well 
and was ahead a lot. She was 
ahead in her pitch counts a lot. She showed some good compo-sure and she probably didn’t real-ize that the winning run was sit-
ting at home plates three times in 
a row.”
In her lone game in the circle, 
Haeger was perfect through 6.2 
innings. In Florida’s 12-2 win 
against Troy on Saturday, the junior right-handed pitcher had four strikeouts and did not allow a single batter to reach base with 
one out to go. Haeger ended the 
game by giving up two hits — including a two-run homer by Troy’s Michelle Phelps — before ending the game.
Haeger holds team-best marks 
among starting pitchers in ERA 
(1.03) and opponent’s batting av-
erage (.100).
While the Gators were success-
ful in the circle throughout the 
Lipton Invitational, the team had 
mixed results at the plate. On Fri-day, Florida was limited to a .217 clip after logging only 10 hits and striking out eight times.
“I wasn’t too pleased with how 
we swung the bat,“ Walton said. “But then again, I think I’m going to have to give a little credit to the way Troy pitched and the way In-diana pitched. 
“Both pitchers were hitting 
their spots and weren’t giving in to our hitters.”
But after the poor perfor-
mance on Friday, Florida made a fast turnaround in its rematches against Troy and Indiana on Sat-urday, registering 23 hits and 20 runs during the two games.
Sophomore Kelsey Stewart 
was the lone Florida batter to log a hit in all four contests. The sec-ond baseman managed eight hits, seven runs and four RBIs during the tournament. 
The Wichita, Kan., native leads 
the team with 21 runs scored — one run fewer than all of Florida’s opponents this season — and is 
tied with Haeger with a team-
leading 18 RBIs.
Stewart is also third on the 
team with a .393 batting average, behind only sophomore Aubree 
Munro (.395) and freshman Jus-
tine McLean (.412).
