There was no sign of the re-
mains of Tiffany Sessions, the UF student who went missing 25 years ago Sunday. But for the teary loved ones and stoic law enforcement ofﬁ  cers who gath-
ered Thursday morning at the 
excavation site just past the in-tersection of U.S. Highway 441 and Williston Road, there was a glimmer of an explanation to an important question: Who did this?
The answer: Paul Rowles.Although no DNA evidence 
deﬁ  nitively links Rowles to the case, “every other indicator is there,” said Alachua County Sheriff Sadie Darnell during a press conference in which au-thorities named the deceased se-rial killer as the formal suspect.
Darnell, investigators and 
Sessions’ parents spoke during 
the conference, ﬁ  nally able to 
release new information about a case grown cold. “It’s been a 25-year struggle,” 
said mother Hilary, her voice wavering. 
But before the years of heart-
break, before the evidence point-ing to Rowles, before Tiffany Sessions became the Gainesville girl who went for a walk and never came back, there was a 
20-year-old ﬁ  nance junior and a 
man with the urge to kill.  
�        �         �The 125-pound blonde beam-

Tiffany was just … normal.
“Tiffany got put on a ped-
estal,” said Patrick Sessions,

PAUL ROWLES
Paul Rowles, who police think 
killed UF ﬁ  nance junior Tiffany 
Sessions in 1989, killed before.
In 1972, Rowles strangled his 
Miami neighbor Linda Fida be-cause she wouldn’t stop scream-ing the night he entered her apartment to rape her.
In 1992, 21-year-old Elizabeth 
Foster went to a park to read. Her body was found 11 days later.
All the while, Rowles drifted. 
He moved from Miami to Pinellas County after being paroled, then Gainesville, then Jacksonville.
He was 
married when he killed Fida. His wife, Linda Schaf-
fer, divorced him nearly a year after the crime.
Accord-
ing to Alachua County Sheriff’s 
Ofﬁ  ce documents, Rowles had 
dreamed of raping women since he was 12 years old, his fanta-sies triggered by the sight of girls in underwear. He stalked the op-posite sex, peeping in windows, knife in hand.
He had a difﬁ  cult childhood, 
the son of a mother with bad 
nerves. Around the time Rowles 
was 8 — the year he choked a female cat to death — his father tried to hang himself on three occasions. His father may have molested and verbally abused him, telling him he had feminine features, reports say.
He’d sometimes sneak into 
his victims' apartments to steal their underwear, reports say, es-pecially when it came to Laura, a 15-year-old he kidnapped in 1994.
Rowles took Laura from Clear-
water to Jacksonville, stopping in Gainesville for Steak ‘n Shake. They took a side trip to a nearby 
wooded area.
“This is the kind of place peo-
ple dump things they don’t want 
to be found again,” he told her.
But he had no sympathy for 
the women he preyed on. He saw himself as the victim.

One-sixth of people infected 
with HIV don’t know they have it, 
but UF organizations are working 
together to make sure Gators don’t 
become a statistic.  
The UF Institute of Hispanic-
Latino Cultures, the Institute of 
Black Culture, LGBT Affairs and 
WellFlorida Council are hosting free HIV testing today.
It will run from noon to 2 p.m. at 
La Casita, 1504 W. University Ave.
Testing is free for all UF stu-
dents, faculty and staff with Gator 1 Cards. Austin Sanchez, a 19-year-old 
UF ﬁ  nance sophomore, said he is getting tested even though he does not think he has HIV. 
“It’s just knowing that you’re 
clean,” Sanchez said. “I guess you always just suspect that you don’t have to worry about it, but in the 
back of my mind, I just wanted to 
know.”
He said when males get tested 
for HIV, it is automatically as-sumed that they are gay or intrave-nous drug users.
“There is a lot of stigma,” San-
chez said. “If you say you’re going to get tested for HIV, everybody kind of looks at you a different 
way.”
Iain Randall, a UF linguistics 
junior and junior ambassador for 
LGBT Affairs, recommended ev-
eryone get tested for HIV. 
He said test results are conﬁ  -
dential and are usually available in 
about two weeks. 
 “Everyone should know their 
status and also be empowered to know their sexual health,” Ran-dall said. “People can have more conversations about sexual health and talk with their sexual partners about it.”UF groups collaborate to host

Researchers are trying to land 
their projects among the stars.
About 65 researchers registered 
to attend the Center for the Ad-
vancement of Science in Space event to promote space-based research on Thursday.The center currently in charge of 
managing the International Space Station U.S. National Laboratory hosted the event in coordination with the UF Interdisciplinary Center for Biotechnology Research.
Rob Ferl, director of the UF Inter-
disciplinary Center for Biotechnol-ogy Research, said the event was the space center’s ﬁ  rst time at UF.
“If you want to do stuff on the 
space station, they are the people who can get you there,” he said. “This is an organization that wants to hear from students. It’s a unique way to get experiments into orbit.”
Inside the UF Cancer & Genet-
ics Research Complex, the space advancement center provided a presentation and Q-and-A on how to facilitate research at the interna-tional space laboratory.
Participants then broke off into 
groups to discuss their ideas for re-search experiments in space.  
Wagner Vendrame, an associate 
professor in the UF department of Environmental Horticulture, said the event helped him learn about new funding opportunities for space experiments. 
“We got some really important 
information on the capabilities and types of experiments you can per-form and the partnerships that can be made,” he said.
At UF, researchers take one small step closer to spaceCAMPUS
“Everyone should know 
their status and also be 
empowered to know their 
sexual health.”
Iain Randall
UF linguistics juniorwho recalls his daughter as a 
headstrong woman prone to re-lationship drama. “Tiffany was a pretty, young college girl, and she had all the same issues you 
had when you went to college ... 
boyfriends and girlfriends and grades and whatever else goes along with that.”
After spending her days study-
ing ﬁ  nance at UF, Tiffany took nightly four-mile walks with her roommate. From their Casablanca East condominium, they’d walk 
along Williston Road near build-
ings where authorities believe Rowles delivered scaffolding and Pizza Hut orders. The women always went together, until the night they didn’t.
On Feb. 9, 1989, Tiffany’s 
roommate had a 7:20 p.m. class, so she decided to go alone. She 
left her keys and wallet at home, 
taking only her Walkman and Rolex as she walked out the door at 6 p.m. She wore red sweatpants and a white sweatshirt.
Detective Kevin Allen thinks 
Rowles was watching. He said Rowles stalked Tiffany, planned her murder and probably prac-ticed the kidnapping before he did it.
“If and when he took Tiffany,” 
Allen said, “he took her to her 
grave.”
When Tiffany didn’t return by 
8 p.m., her roommate called the 
police. Deputies were out search-ing by 9 p.m. with German shep-herds and a bloodhound. When they didn’t ﬁ  nd her, they called her parents, who launched a full-scale investigation complete with 
a private detective.
By Feb. 18, most of the state 
was searching for her. 
More than 300 UF students 
from 35 student organizations 
— including fraternities, ROTC and the Gator football team — knocked on doors and asked for leads. Miles away, 400 military 
volunteers searched the woods 
where she disappeared. Domino’s delivered pizza boxes across the Southeast with “MISSING” ﬂ  iers tacked on top. Driving back and forth from Valrico to Gainesville, Hilary Sessions put more than 350,000 miles on her Oldsmobile and Honda Odyssey. 
Miami Dolphins quarterback 
Dan Marino got involved at the request of Tiffany's father, as did Gov. Bob Martinez. Helicopters, horseback riders and even cave 
divers scoured Gainesville for 
any sign of Tiffany.
“The searching is about over. 
Now, it’s the investigation part,” Patrick Sessions told the Alliga-tor in 1989.
He had no idea the investiga-
tion would last longer than the time he knew his daughter.
�        �         �
Joe Nilsen had junk, and he 
wanted to keep it.
Nilsen, Rowles’ priest and 
conﬁ  dant, took ownership of the prisoner’s personal items after his death in February 2013. Origi-
nally, the box containing Rowles’ 
possessions — including an ad-dress book with Bible verses on its pages — had been delivered to Rowles’ second wife, but she turned it over to Nilsen. 
The priest didn’t want to give 
up the box. Allen told him to visit TiffanySessions.com, a website her family created to publish up-dates on the case. Nilsen called back 15 minutes later.
“I’ll do it,” he said.When Nilsen saw Tiffany’s pic-
ture online, she looked familiar: She resembled Rowles’ ﬁ  rst wife, with whom the killer was ob-sessed. The priest knew Rowles’ ﬁ  xation was strong enough to make him target Tiffany. 
In the notebook Nilsen handed 
over, Rowles had scribbled dates and numbers of four events.
The ﬁ  rst was 1972. Beside it 
was Linda Fida, the name of his 20-year-old neighbor he con-fessed to raping and killing. 
The second was just a date — 
no name. 
“If there was any one day per-
manently etched in my mind, it was 2/9/89 — and I open the ad-
dress book, and there it is,” Al-
len said. “I literally held onto the person next to me and said, ‘Tom, you’ve got to see this.’”
Rowles had already confessed 
or been identiﬁ  ed for the three murder dates he wrote names next to. Maybe he didn’t put Tif-fany’s name down by the date of her disappearance because he wasn’t suspected yet, Patrick Ses-sions surmised. If an ofﬁ  cer took the notebook from his cell with that detail in writing, it would be 
the equivalent of a confession. 
Sessions said details from the 
four cases referenced in Rowles’ 
notebook point to one of Rowles’ most prominent traits: He was a plotter. 
During the 1972 interview in 
which Rowles confessed to the murder of Linda Fida, ofﬁ  cers 
said he “denied ever raping or 
killing anyone before but stated he has been on the verge of doing so several times,” according to a warrant afﬁ  davit. “He had fol-lowed girls home or entered ele-vators with them, but something always terminated the urge, usu-ally the presence of a third per-
son.”
“He was not an opportunistic 
guy,” Sessions said. “He was a 
stalker. And he would ﬁ  nd some-body he ﬁ  xated on, and he would ﬁ  nd a way to get them.”

Rowles’ morbid obsession with 
women dominated his 64 years. 
He imagined stabbing their 
genitals and burning them with 
hot curling irons, according to sheriff’s ofﬁ  ce documents. 
Rowles did more than fantasize 
about abducting and abusing women. 
He often did.By the time he moved to 
Gainesville in 1988, Rowles had 
already been sentenced to life in 
prison for killing Fida. 
In a move Allen speculates was 
partially orchestrated by Rowles’ second wife, a prison employee, he got parole. 
Tiffany disappeared in 1989.Three years later, 21-year-old 
Santa Fe College student Elizabeth 
Foster vanished on March 15, 
1992. 
Her body was found in a 
shallow grave 11 days later, and an autopsy showed she had been sexually assaulted and beaten to death.
At the time, police insisted the 
Foster and Sessions cases were 
unrelated.
Cpl. Larry Roberts told the 
Alligator that “the only similarity I 
can see is we have two disappeared young ladies.”
In 1992, then-Alachua County 
Sheriff’s spokesman Lt. Spencer Mann said there was no other evidence that connected the Foster 
and Sessions cases.
Then, DNA evidence revealed 
in 2012 that Rowles killed Foster. 
Now, investigators are 
excavating the site where Foster's 
body was buried in hopes of ﬁ  nding Sessions' remains as well.
�        �         �
The digging is an ebb and ﬂ  ow 
of optimism and disappointment for UF anthropologist Michael Warren, director of the C.A. Pound Human Identiﬁ  cation Laboratory at UF. 
He said the hard part is staying 
focused amid the copious details. 
“You’ve got to watch every 
bucket because if you’re not paying attention and you miss it, you’ll not sleep the rest of your life over that,” he said.
At this point, investigators have 
sifted through about an acre of land, digging 4-foot-deep pockets 
that so far have only turned up 
more dirt. 
Warren, who has excavated 
dozens of sites working on the case since he was a graduate student in 1991, said human remains are usually discovered by accident. 
For a fruitful excavation, it 
generally takes a speciﬁ  c lead to 
pinpoint “X marks the spot,” he 
said.  
With the only two people who 
knew the exact events of Feb. 9 gone, pinpointing an area, or any helpful information, is difﬁ  cult. 
The Sheriff’s Ofﬁ  ce and 
Sessions family are asking for help from anyone who may have 
known Rowles or seen something 
— anything — on that night.
That’s why the family and 
agencies agreed to go public with the details of the case now — because the public may hold the key to solving the mystery. 
“Stuff that we would have 
kept conﬁ  dential, we’re not now 
because the idea is to nail this 
thing down and to ﬁ  nd Tiffany,” Sessions said. 
They are pleading for people 
who may have known Rowles at any point or may have seen his red Bronco truck to come forward and help reconstruct the course of events. 
No tip is too vague or too 
insigniﬁ  cant. 
They are urging those with 
information to call the ofﬁ  ce at 352-955-1818.
“There’s no risk. He’s dead. Thank goodness he’s dead at this point,” Darnell said. “Don’t go to your grave thinking you had information and didn’t come forward with it.”
Hilary Sessions described the 
odds as “looking for a very small needle in a very large haystack.” 
But the mother already has 
plans for when — if — her daughter’s remains are found: a Christian burial on an Episcopal church’s grounds back in Valrico. 
�        �         �
Even on the brink of a possible 
conclusion, the pain will never really be over for the Sessions family.
“This will bring answers, but it 
doesn’t make it almost over,” said Tiffany’s brother, Jason. “This is something I’m going to deal with for the rest of my life.”
Living in fear isn’t an option.However, he said, living 
cautiously is essential — especially with young children of his own.
Nowadays, maybe it’s easier 
to stay safe, especially in the quadrant of Gainesville that  Tiffany disappeared from in February 1989.
Student apartment complexes 
like The Polos and Cottage Grove have sprouted up near the area of her disappearance that was once shrouded in woods. 
Almost everyone carries a 
cellphone. 
And students are constantly 
warned about walking alone in campus safety notices.
But some things are never 
forgotten, and mundane things, part of a landscape even, can revive a painful past. 
While Jason Sessions and 
his family spoke to reporters in front of Tiffany’s old apartment Wednesday, three young women jogged by. 
It was dusk, right around 6

First, the Alligator wants to extend the biggest congratu-
latory LAUREL to the Alachua County Sheriff’s Ofﬁ  ce — in 
particular, the team that’s been working for years to discover the missing pieces in the story of Tiffany Sessions’ disappear-ance. On Thursday, authorities named a suspect in Sessions’ disappearance and announced plans to move forward in the investigation in hopes of closing the case.
The resolution of the Sessions disappearance will be an 
important step for cold case teams everywhere. In 2005 and 2007, the U.S. National Institute of Justice awarded a total of $22.2 million to state and local police departments to fo-cus on opening cases that had gone cold. We’re hoping that Alachua County’s success will encourage the NIJ to award more funds to Florida as well as other states to reopen old homicide and sexual assault cases.
This week, Devon Lochte misinterpreted his older brother 
Ryan’s urges to “turn it up” and found himself in trouble after violating terms of his probation after a urine test came back positive for marijuana. He was arrested on Valentine’s 
Day of 2012 for possession of marijuana with intent to sell, 
and police arrested him on Tuesday after his latest misstep. 
Devon, hang up your shutter shades and see yourself 
out: That is not acceptable Lochterage behavior. This week, a DART goes to the Lochte camp for failing to keep its s**t 
together.
Another bad-behavior DART goes a certain prominent 
member of the UF community too: Florida baseball player Harrison Bader, who was suspended from the team this week after an incident that involved a scooter, a parked truck and — probably — a lot of alcohol. 
Although we’re sure drunken scooter accidents happen 
every day, we highlight cases involving UF athletes because they’re supposed to represent our school. Is it fair that cer-tain UF students get way more attention for their drunken — or sober — transgressions simply because they’re athletes? Probably not, but at the same time, it’s part of the position. After all, Bader and all other athletes who do dumb things all got into UF on the basis of their grades in addition to their prowess on the ﬁ  eld, they should know better.
Finally, in light of the recent $1 trillion farm bill that 
passed in the Senate on Monday and its stipulations that would require meat providers to include more information about the sources of their products to the public, we give Ward’s Supermarket an as-if-we-needed-another-reason-to-love-your-fresh-produce-and-amazing-chocolate-chip-cook-ies LAUREL for launching a brand of locally raised beef.
Stay warm and dry this weekend, Gators!

before this week?NYFW: ‘Find me posing for the paparazzi’
There are two kinds of people: those who will ad-
mit they care about fashion and those who care about fashion but don’t know it. 
So, hey, you in the lumpy blue sweater: Did you 
know that sweater was selected for you by people in 
fashion from a pile of stuff? 
And the selection process is happening right now 
during New York Fashion Week. 
The event that kicks off the start of fashion weeks 
‘round the world started Thursday, and even if you’re 
busy trying to tell everyone you take yourself too seri-ously to care about what you put on your back, there are things about NYFW you, too, can enjoy.
New York Fashion Week is one beautiful soap opera 
that — although some of us aren’t lucky enough to be a part of — we can all watch from remote locations. 
Even if you’re not into fashion, I can guarantee 
there’s something there for you.
Let’s start with the drama. With so many people in one place for the same things, 
there’s bound to be arguments over something. 
Whether it’s someone arguing his or her way into 
an invite-only show or an angry blogger who just got 
stepped on, heads will butt over something, and we’ll 
hear about it. 
What about the lack of diversity on the runway or 
the size of the models? 
What about the hypocrisy of the industry? There’s going to be something said about more than 
just the clothes on display.
If we’re lucky, some of those things will be said by 
Kanye.
Google made one of its ﬁ  rst commercials for Google 
Glass with Diane Von Furstenberg at NYFW 2012. 
And Google isn’t the only company that gets in-
volved in the madness. 
Mercedes-Benz is the ofﬁ  cial sponsor of the entire se-ries of events. 
Other ofﬁ  cial sponsors in-
clude Maybelline, Tresemme 
and Samsung, so there are al-
ways a few product rollouts to look forward to. 
When you can’t make it to 
New York for the festivities, and even when you can, design-ers, bloggers, stylists, interns 
— you get the picture — will be feeding your devices the latest from the city and making the event a global 
conversation. 
At the very least, you’ll be able to gawk at whatever 
new trend you keep seeing on Instagram.
Even if the only thing you like about fashion week is 
hating on it, there’s a publication for that witty cynicism 
you crave but are too lighthearted to come up with on your own. 
I’m talking about VICE, where you can ﬁ  nd an array 
of articles ranging from “The Exploitation And Crush-
ing Capitalism of Fashion Week” to “How to Get Laid 
at Fashion Week.”
That’s right, folks. Whether you’re keeping up with New York Fashion 
Week because you care about fashion or because you’re being forced to by something else you care about, it’s here. 
As Big Poppa would say, “money, hoes and clothes” 
abound.
You can expect to see that new, new s**t all over the 
web, even if you’re not into it. 
Sorry I’m not sorry I just added to your struggle to 
avoid it. 
The models aren’t sorry either.Marjorie Nunez is a UF journalism senior. Her columns

Why I’m running for SG under the Swamp 
Party
My name is Arielle Konen, and I am the cur-
rent Swamp Party candidate for the College of 
Public Health and Health Performance.
Last semester, I ran for Murphree Area 
Senator. I allied myself with the Swamp Par-
ty because I saw a proven record for change 
through several initiatives here on campus. From the start, I knew it would not be an easy race. My opponent was a senior who had lived in the Murphree area for years, and he was also highly ranked in the opposing party. 
Knowing this, I put my whole self into that 
campaign. Fourteen-hour days in the summer heat, marathon homework nights and compet-ing vote-for-vote with my opponent became the new norm.  
On election night, I joined the Swamp 
Party by the Reitz Union to listen to the elec-
tion results being called. As the Supervisor of 
Elections read the list, our party erupted with cheers and jumping hugs because each Swamp candidate’s win felt like a massive victory for all of us. My best friend and fellow running mate Jessica tightened her grip as we held hands for the Murphree seat results. Unfortu-nately, it didn’t go the way we had hoped.
Everything that followed the announce-
ment felt pretty surreal. I was the only one who lost out of all 50 seats. People showered me with hugs and words of encouragement, but what was most striking was how many of them were crying with me, even though they had all just won their spot in the Student Sen-ate. 
I was OK with losing, even though it was 
so public. Friends and even my former op-ponent encouraged me to go for Senate once again, but the thought of throwing myself into another campaign cycle was incredibly daunt-ing. 
As January rolled around, I had to ask 
myself some difﬁ  cult questions. I knew I still wanted to be a senator, to ﬁ  nally be a proac-
tive voice for the causes I’ve become so pas-
sionate about. With the changing political cli-mate here at UF, I certainly had some choices when considering who to slate with. But when I walked into the Hub to try slating for Sen-ate, I knew there was only one party with the understanding and drive necessary to make 
changes on campus. That’s why, for the sec-
ond time, I chose Swamp.
Over the next two weeks, our campus will 
once again morph into a hub of political activi-ty as we brace ourselves for another incredible campaign. I encourage you to take the time to discover, just as I have, how truly passionate and committed this year’s Swamp Party can-didates are in working toward a better UF. 
Go Gators, and go Swamp!
Arielle Konen
Swamp Party candidate
Letters to the Editor
Last semester’s 
Student Govern-ment elections 
were something of a spectacle. Swamp Par-
ty candidates won 48 
out of 50 seats in the Senate, ridiculously overpowering any voice of opposition. The Swamp Party’s competitor in the Fall elections, the Students Party, is responding to this near-death experience by not 
running an executive ticket. Rather 
than waste momentum going after seats they have dubious chances of winning, at best, the party will focus on gaining seats it knows it can win. 
A new party is using a similar 
strategy. Consolidating its plat-form, though, not its ticket. They 
call themselves the Taco Libre 
Party, and like all great dissident political groups of the past, they’re ﬁ  ghting single-mindedly for one idea: bringing Taco Bell back to UF’s campus. 
The party was created by for-
mer Students Party members who, I can imagine, were disillusioned 
with the results of last semester’s 
election. Their split from the Stu-dents Party was formal and ﬁ  -nal; efforts by the Students Party spokesman to contact them were met with silence. 
The Taco Libre Party’s platform 
is unbelievably simple. Do they have ideas for budget appropria-
tions? Innovative ideas for the stu-
dent body? New programs? 
Not exactly. Its whole deal is truly just 
“Queremos Taco Bell.” That’s all they’re gunning for.  
Taco Libre’s lack of a compli-
cated platform may be an advan-tage for the party in that potential 
voters have only one thing to con-
sider: Do you want Taco Bell here, or not? In this case, the cliched ar-gument “Either you’re with us, or you’re against us” actually applies to the situation. If you hate tacos, there are other parties to vote for. Simple as that. 
But the party’s platform takes 
its genius a step further. Who, in the 21st century, actually hates ta-cos? Even though I’d rather bring a Chipotle onto our campus, I’m deﬁ  nitely not opposed to having a Taco Bell nearby either. 
And then there’s the fact that, by the mere fact it exists, the Taco Libre Party has bought it-self huge amounts of attention and public-
ity. Any political par-
ty that has the word “taco” in its name automatically gets it-self printed in news-papers and posted all 
over social media sites. Even the name brings to mind thoughts of both delicious food and freedom. 
Delicious freedom. 
However, not everyone is 
amused with this party of deli-
cious freedom. Supporters of the majority probably ﬁ  nd it amus-ing, but some veterans of the op-position aren’t happy at all with the prospect of having to compete against a Taco Bell party on top of 
the political behemoth that walked 
all over them last Fall. 
Senate minority leader Michael 
Christ has expressed dismay at how the Taco Libre Party seems to be treating the SG election as a huge joke. This sentiment was shared by the SG Elections Com-mission, which reprimanded the 
party Tuesday night for slating 
candidates with Mexican food-themed nicknames such as Shan-non “Salsalicious” Hill.
Christ has a point. People have 
called him whiny and unprofes-sional online, but his anguish and outrage is at least understand-able. He’s the leader of a party 
that won two seats last election, a 
party whose survival depends on the outcome of the elections in two weeks. At a time when SG elec-tions carry some of the most seri-ous implications in recent memo-ry, the fact that a taco party might derail the opposition’s last chance for survival is upsetting. 
But I also disagree with the 
statement. Taco Libre may take votes away from the Students Party. It doesn’t have a goal apart from opening a low-tier Mexican restaurant on campus, and its can-didates tried to run with silly taco nicknames. But it might also be the best way to show the Student Body 
what voices in the SG can accom-
plish. If you want Taco Bell, you can elect someone that will get it for you. That’s powerful.

When selecting the right mu-
tual fund for you, perhaps the most important thing to 
consider is what your ﬁ  nancial goals are. Depending on what you want 
your investments to do, and depending what your 
timeline is, there are many different types of funds to look at.
As a student investor, the main question that 
you want to ask yourself is, “How much risk do I want to take?” Depending on your ﬁ  nancial situ-ation and your support system while you are in school, the amount of risk that you want to take on in your portfolio may vary.
If your main goal is to make your money grow, 
you would be best served to put most of your mon-ey into a an aggressive, growth-focused fund. What these types of funds do is look for stocks and securi-ties that focus on appreciation in value. These funds generally tend to be more volatile than most but of-fer a much bigger payout if the markets do well. 
If you are looking to put some disposable in-
come into this kind of fund, look for mainly stock-based funds that are invested in industries with good potential. Many of the funds that are invested in industries such as health care, biotechnology, ﬁ  -
nancial services or other growing industries.
If your main goal is to preserve your contribu-
tions, however, you may want to instead look into 
more ﬁ  xed-income or principal preservation funds. These funds tend to shy away from risk and avoid holdings with much volatility. Many of these port-folios will contain bonds or very steady stocks that are from larger, more ma-ture companies and will often issue dividends. Bonds, which are a type of debt security that offer bondholders a 
certain interest rate to loan money to bond issuers, are preferred by investors who don’t mind getting smaller returns in exchange of a near 100-percent guarantee that their original investment will stay intact. 
Stocks that issue dividends offer more ﬁ  xed in-
come. Dividends are per share earnings, or in other words, an investor’s proportionate share of the company’s proﬁ  ts. The more shares you own of the 
speciﬁ  c company, the more divided payout you are 
guaranteed to get.
By using more balanced funds, you can self-
customize how your money is allocated. If you are leaning toward a more growth-based strategy but still want to mitigate the risks of a fully aggressive portfolio, you can split up your funds. By putting 70 percent of your money into growth securities and 30 percent into ﬁ  xed-income, dividend-heavy securities, you can split your money into funds that have a diversiﬁ  ed amount of risk.
Remember to treat your investments as a long-
term nest egg of savings and steady growth, and before you know it, you will have a sizable account that will help you on your journey to ﬁ  nancial se-curity.

UF students have taken the 
bait and been reeled into phish-
ing scams.
Phishers send emails to try 
to lure people into providing private information that en-ables the attacker to gain access 
to personal accounts. UF stu-
dents have been targeted with scams that look like requests to update a password or verify a GatorLink account.
The UF Privacy Ofﬁ  ce is 
working to educate students to recognize the spam and avoid identity theft with a Power-
Point presentation now avail-
able on its homepage.
Derrius Marlin, a UF data 
security specialist, described phishing as a social engineer-
ing attack.
“Besides implementing tech-
nology to monitor for and quar-
antine phishing messages as 
they come into our email serv-
ers, we also work hard to raise awareness of the threats so that users can recognize phishing attacks for themselves,” Marlin 
wrote in an email interview.
Phishing emails usually cre-
ate a false urgency to respond, 
may threaten to close accounts 
and insist on a reply with per-sonal information, Marlin said. 
Connor Jacobsen, a 20-year-
old UF computer engineering 
software junior, has been tar-geted by a phishing attack pos-ing as Twitter. He was aware of 
phishing and realized the URL 
wasn’t Twitter’s.
“I always make sure URLs 
match up before logging into 
anything, especially over 
email,” Jacobsen wrote in an email. 
Randa Medley, a 21-year-
old UF business economics 
junior, was targeted by a phish-
ing scam.
“I think college students 
are more prone to be a target 
because they tend to be less 
informed than a professional,” Medley wrote in an email. “College students also tend to be overwhelmed and may not 
take the time to think if a re-
quest for information is legiti-mate or not.” 
UF English junior Brenna 
Dunbar, 21, is also a victim of a recent phishing attack.
“I assumed people fell vic-
tim to it because they were un-educated or had a serious lack 
of security,” she wrote in an 
email. “But I got caught too. I never knew how vicious and intrusive these scams could 
be.”UF security ofﬁ  ce

The Gainesville Area Chamber of Com-
merce announced plans last week to bring a 
new convention center to the city.
The 52,000-square-foot center, estimated 
to cost more than $26 million, will soon 
stand at the western end of Hull Road off 
Southwest 34th Street. Developers hope to complete the facility by 2016.
Adrian Taylor, the vice president of In-
novation Gainesville & Regional Initiatives, said the chamber has been entertaining the idea of a convention center for several 
years. 
“We’re all about making Gainesville the hub of talent, innovation and opportunity, 
and that’s opportunity for everyone, for the academic community as well as the public,” Taylor said. “There would be more people going to shops, restaurants, the Harn … a cultural arts event or a sports event.”
Richard Secord, the Hilton UF Confer-
ence Center Gainesville’s director of sales and marketing, said the new center will mean more conference space.
“It will draw more and more business 
to the area and enable us to capture much larger groups,” Secord said.
Some UF students are looking forward to 
the center as well. 
Lawrence Chan, the main events coor-
dinator for SwampCon, said organizers would consider holding the UF Conference on Comics and Graphic Novels at the center because space in the Reitz Union is limited. 
“SwampCon is looking for a feasible new 
place as it is,” the 20-year-old UF journalism junior said. “The Reitz extensions we use will be under construction next year.”
Diego Pinzon, a 20-year-old UF econom-
ics junior, said he thinks the center will help expand Gainesville’s inﬂ  uence. 
“Everyone recognizes Gainesville just for 
the school. Maybe the convention center will open up new ventures ... drive intelligence and connections,” he said.
However, Roger Blair, chair of UF’s 
economics department, said he is skeptical about the center.
“I’ve lived here for 40 years; it’s not a 
tourist attraction,” he said.
He said there is not enough to do in 
Gainesville for visiting international or na-tional guests attending conferences.
“Some of the claims of economic impact 
are grossly inﬂ  ated ... whether that (econom-
ic improvement) is going to happen or not is 
certainly not a certainty,” Blair said.New convention center planned for near Southwest Rec� THE EVENT IS AT 9:30 A.M.

UF students with a taste for ad-
venture and service have the op-
portunity to hear the acting director of the Peace Corps, Carrie Hessler-Radelet, on Monday.
Hessler-Radelet will visit UF to 
discuss the Peace Corps and the advantages it provides in today’s job market at 9:30 a.m. in Smathers Library.
“Our acting 
director is excited to come and visit the university and thank the university for its 
support,” said 
Shira Kramer, 
press director of the Peace Corps. “She travels somewhat frequently, but she’s never been to UF as the head of the agency.”
UF has been a longtime sup-
porter of the Peace Corps, tying with the University of Washing-ton in 2013 for the largest number of Peace Corps recruits from large universities, with 107 undergradu-ate alumni serving as Peace Corps volunteers.
UF also holds the title of the 
most graduate students serving in the Peace Corps in 2013 — for the second consecutive year with 26 graduate students volunteering.
Eric Gajentan, a 21-year-old nu-
clear engineering junior, said he ap-preciated the opportunity to learn more about the Peace Corps.

Scottie Wilbekin sets up for a free throw during Florida’s 68-58 win against Mis-souri on Tuesday in the O’Connell Center. Wilbekin had made 73 percent of his free throws, but the Gators are shooting at a 66 percent clip as a whole from the charity stripe. UF made 73 percent of its free throws against Mizzou.

Scottie Wilbekin is 56 of 77 from the free-
throw line this season. But in practice before 
Tuesday’s game against Missouri, the se-
nior point guard was 86 of 86. No misses, no 
breaks; just basket after basket.
Coach Billy Donovan said to not expect 
to see the Gators shoot 100 percent from the 
charity stripe, but expect them to improve.
No. 3 Florida is 11th out of 14 teams in the 
Southeastern Conference in free-throw per-
centage, shooting at 66 percent. Only Van-derbilt, Mississippi State and Texas A&M 
trail Florida in that category, and those three 
squads are a combined 12-15 in the SEC.
The Gators, whose 20-2 start is their best 
since the championship years in 2006 and 
2007, have had their worst start at the line 
since 2011 when they shot about 65 percent in their first 22 games.
But against Missouri, Florida showed im-
provement in the second half. After starting the game 6 of 10 from the line, the Gators sealed the tight game by sinking 18 of their 
last 23 attempts in the second half.
“Our guys, overall, were a little bit bet-
ter there than maybe we were in previous 
games,” Donovan said. “We shot the ball fair-ly well, much better than we have been at the 
free-throw line.”
Wilbekin led all players in trips to the free-
throw line with 16 attempts, and the senior 
iced the victory over the Tigers by only miss-
ing three of those shots.
When the Gators have needed Wilbekin to 
step up late in the game from the line, he has 
done just that.
Against Mississippi State, Tennessee, Ala-
bama and Auburn, Wilbekin combined to shoot 17 of 21 from the line, which was the most efficient on the squad.
“I wanted to get to the free-throw line,” 
Wilbekin said. “And I was able to make them, so anytime you get free points like that, it’s good.”Wilbekin leads Gators’ effort from charity stripe

A 12-batter fourth inning gave 
Florida what it needed to seal the 
win in Tampa on Thursday.
After going without a hit 
through the first three innings and falling behind 1-0, the No. 4 
Gators rallied in the fourth, scor-
ing seven runs in the inning as UF defeated No. 25 USF 10-3 on the road to start the season.
“When you’re facing a team 
like South Florida, as good as 
they are, and you’re facing one 
of the best 
pitchers in the country, I thought 
our bats were really good,” coach Tim Walton said in a release. 
“Overall, I think it was not 
our best performance, but we’re 
not measuring our best perfor-
mance; we’re just trying to get W’s every single game.”
After USF left-handed pitch-
er Sara Nevins hit sophomore Taylor Schwarz and junior Bai-ley Castro to start the fourth in-ning, sophomore Aubree Munro dropped down a sacrifice bunt to 
move both runners into scoring 
position.
From there, junior Briana 
Little hit an RBI single to tie the 
game at 1.

man Justine McLean, loading the UF routs

Multiple streaks were broken on 
Thursday night in Arkansas. 
The Razorbacks ended their 
three-game skid and the Gators saw their three-game winning streak 
come to an end in a 55-49 Arkansas (16-7, 3-7 Southeastern Conference) 
victory, holding Florida (16-7, 6-4 
SEC) to its lowest offensive output this season. Although the offense struggled, 
turnovers and foul trouble are what doomed Florida.
“A great deal of composure was 
lacking,” coach Amanda Butler said. “You got to give Arkansas the 
credit for the way that they played and the turnovers that they forced 
us into. I was really disappointed 
that we didn’t handle the ball bet-ter. We didn’t value our posses-sions.”
The Gators committed 12 turn-
overs in the first half, and key post 
players Kayla Lewis and Ronni 
Williams had three and two fouls Fouls, turnovers doom Florida in road loss against Arkansas

Last season, sophomore Bridgette Caquatto did 
not contribute much until the postseason. Now, al-
most halfway through her sophomore season, she has not missed a beat or a meet. 
“I think the challenge she had coming in was she 
was recovering from so many surgeries and injuries from her elite career that she really needed to get healthy,” coach Rhonda Faehn said. 
Due to injuries she 
sustained in elite com-petitions, Caquatto was not cleared to do gym-
nastics again until after Thanksgiving of her fresh-man year. 
“That’s when all the athletes were already do-
ing full routines and she was just starting out basic gymnastics again and trying to gain all of her skills back,” Faehn said. 
Caquatto has come a long way since her fresh-
man year. In 2013, she competed ﬂ  oor and uneven bars once during the regular season and three times during the postseason.
Caquatto has competed on ﬂ  oor, vault and un-
even bars in all of Florida’s meets so far this year. 
“I really think she has shown this awesome conﬁ  -
dence this year, and she’s real calm,” Faehn said. 
In the ﬁ  rst meet of the year, she placed ﬁ  rst on 
uneven bars against UCLA with a score of 9.90. Caquatto has posted her collegiate best in all three events this season. On vault, her best is 9.875, while on uneven bars and ﬂ  oor she has reached a 9.95.
“I enjoy competing three events every single meet 
and getting some more experience under my belt and getting more used to competing every week-
end,” Caquatto said. 
This week, the Gators (4-0, 2-0 Southeastern Con-
ference) have been gearing up to compete on the 
road for the ﬁ  rst time since their Jan. 17 road win against Auburn. Tonight at 7, newly top-ranked Florida will face Kentucky (4-3, 1-2 SEC) at the Me-morial Coliseum in Lexington, Ky. 
Tonight’s meet will be the Wildcats’ ﬁ  rst contest 
since Kentucky lost to Georgia (197.300-190.950) on 
the road. Florida defeated Georgia (198.05-196.70) 
on Jan. 24. 
But Caquatto has not gotten a chance to practice 
too for Kentucky or any of Florida’s competitors. 
“She still battles with really sore and severe shin 
splints,” Faehn said. “So we’re really careful with her in limiting her training and limiting her pounding.” 
Faehn said Caquatto does soft landings in all her 
practices. 
“I’m able to make that transition from soft land-
ings to hard landings perfectly ﬁ  ne when it comes to meet situations,” Caquatto said. 
Faehn guessed Caquatto only practices her full 
ﬂ  oor and vault routines about once a week.

Bridgette Caquatto performs a ﬂ  oor routine during Florida’s 197.075-
196.225 win against Georgia on Jan. 24 in the O’Connell Center.
UF GymnasticsPatric Young said he approached his senior team-
mate when he was at the line and gave him some 
encouragement to help him get past a pressure-filled 
scenario.
“I just went up to him, and I said, ’86 in a row,’” 
Young said. 
“He said, ‘Yeah, you’re right.’ He really shot well 
(Tuesday).”
Donovan, in addition to desiring more focus on 
the free-throw line, wants to see more confidence 
from his players when shooting beyond the three-point arc.
Florida’s leading three-point scorer, Michael Fra-
zier II, has shown he can be one of the Gators’ most lethal weapons on offense when he’s on his game. 
The sophomore hit 4 of his last 5 threes against Mis-
souri to create separation in a tight matchup.
However, Frazier has had a trend of starting 
games slowly from behind the arc, including Tues-
day when he began 1 of 7. 
Donovan said Frazier is not the only one who 
needs work on his confidence.
Dorian Finney-Smith, who is fourth on the team 
in three-point percentage, also gets too caught up in missed threes like Frazier, which hurts the team on 
the ensuing possessions, according to Donovan.
“It’s so much of a mental thing with them,” Dono-
van said. 
“You would think that these guys have never 
gone through missing a shot in their life. It lives with them, it sticks with them. 
“You’ve got to have enough internal confidence 
(to say), ‘OK the next one is going to go down.’” FRIDAY, FEBRUARY 7, 2014 § ALLIGATOR, 15

Kayla Lewis attempts a free-throw shot during Florida’s 75-67 win against Alabama 
on Jan. 30 in the O’Connell Center. Lewis notched a double-double against Arkansas.
Gators win on boards in six-point defeat to Razorbacks
after the first 20 minutes, respectively. 
Williams ended up fouling out with 3:41 re-
maining in the game.
“The fouls were a bit of an issue, but we’ve 
got to adjust to the way the game is being 
called,” Butler said. “The fouls were not as big 
of a hurdle as the turnovers.” 
For the game, the Gators committed 25 turn-
overs — the second most they have committed 
this season — and found themselves with a mi-
nus-13 turnover margin. 
Going 0 for 5 from beyond the arc in the first 
half didn’t help matters much for Florida, ei-ther. Nor did going on a seven-minute scoring 
drought late in the second half. 
After three strong shooting performances 
leading up to the game at Arkansas, Florida re-gressed mightily on Thursday night, shooting 
37.5 percent from the field and going 3 for 11 from three-point range. 
The Gators’ offensive leaders on the night 
were Lewis and senior Jaterra Bonds, who scored 14 points a piece on a combined 10 for 17 shooting. 
The rest of the team went only 8 for 31. “They play really smart personnel,” Butler 
said. “Tonight, they just set back in a zone and 
let us shoot ourselves in the foot. We just really 
weren’t aggressive at getting seams and really trying to make plays that we worked on for the past two days. 
“They just imposed their style on us.”
Although the Gators were sloppy on of-
fense, the defense was a bright spot. 
Ironically, Florida outrebounded Arkansas 
43-30 — a rare feat for the small Gators. 
Lewis led the team with 10 boards en route 
to a double-double. 
Bonds was second to Lewis with nine re-
bounds, and Williams followed with seven. 
The Gators also held the Razorbacks to a 
meager 33.9 field-goal percentage. 
But the turnovers ultimately did Florida in. 
The Gators’ loss to the Razorbacks could 
haunt them in the coming weeks in regards to earning a bid to the NCAA Tournament. 
After Arkansas’ loss at home to Auburn — a 
team that Florida beat by 18 points almost two weeks ago — Florida was the favorite to win on Thursday. 
Now, the Gators’ enter the gauntlet of their 
schedule to close out the season. Four of their final six opponents are ranked. 
Florida’s next game is against No. 15 Ken-
tucky on Sunday in the O’Connell Center. The Gators upset the Wildcats earlier this season in 
Kentucky, but that achievement is essentially 
deemed meaningless, as Florida beat Arkansas earlier this season as well. 
A radio broadcast contributed to this report.W-hooPS , from page 13First baseman plated three runs in win
bases for Florida. Sophomores Kelsey 
Stewart and Kirsti Merritt followed up with back-to-back singles, bringing in 
three runs to give Florida a 4-1 lead.
Florida finished the fourth inning 
with a 7-1 lead after hits by junior 
Lauren Haeger and Schwarz drove in 
three runners. Schwarz led the team 
with three RBIs.
In the pitching circle, senior Han-
nah Rogers pitched her 82nd com-plete game for Florida and won her 98th career game, the second-highest win total in UF’s history. After giv-
ing up a home run to South Florida’s 
Ta’coia Williams in the first inning, the Lake Wales native only gave up six additional hits while striking out 
six batters in the contest.
While Rogers had a dominating 
performance, South Florida struggled 
in the circle, as Nevins, Sam Greiner and Karla Claudio walked a com-
bined 11 batters and hitting five with pitches. 
The three pitchers struggled with 
their command throughout the game. Schwarz and Merritt were each hit 
two times while McLean, Haeger and Tofft drew two walks each in the con-test.
Florida’s trip to Tampa will extend 
through the weekend as it starts the USF Wilson-DeMarini Tournament today. UF will play a double-header, facing Illinois State at 11 a.m. and

After a brief break in the 
schedule, Florida is ready to 
continue its winning streak. 
Beginning today, the top-
seeded No. 2 Gators (4-0) will compete in a three-day tour-nament at the National Team 
Indoors in Charlottesville, Va. 
They play 14th-ranked host Virginia (3-0) in the opening round.
Coming off a road win at 
Baylor’s indoor facility, Flor-ida feels conﬁ  dent about its chances this weekend. 
“I actually told the team af-
ter playing at Baylor that I felt really good about this team playing indoors,” coach Ro-land Thornqvist said. “Some years, I’ve had some butter-ﬂ  ies in my stomach when we had to move in to play, but this team is different. They 
like hitting the ball. They like 
playing shorter points.”
In past years, Florida has 
relied on its athleticism to 
beat teams outside in the hu-
mid weather, playing longer matches to tire their oppo-nents. However, practicing in the team’s indoor facility has 
beneﬁ  ted their match play re-
cently. Thornqvist hopes the trend continues. 
“It’s nice to have our own 
indoor facility,” Thornqvist said. “We hit the ball a little ﬂ  atter and with a little more pop, which translates to bet-ter play indoors on quicker 
surfaces.”Playing indoors on Satur-
day, senior Alexandra Cer-
cone hit a milestone, win-ning her 100th career singles match. She joins senior Olivia 
Janowicz as the only active 
Gator to reach the mark and became the 25th player to join the 100-win club in school history. 
“[Alex] has worked very, 
very hard in her approach and any time you reach the 100-win platform, it’s re-
markable,” Thornqvist said. 
“She’s been remarkably con-sistent throughout her four years here.”
Cercone and the Gators 
will compete alongside the other 15 teams that qualiﬁ  ed for the National Team In-doors, all of which are ranked 
in the top 20. Florida will play 
the fourth dual match of the day at 6:30 p.m.16, ALLIGATOR � FRIDAY, FEBRUARY 7, 2014

No. 4 Florida opens its season against 
No. 1 North Carolina on Saturday at noon 
in its ﬁ  rst game without its inaugural 
class.
In their stead, seniors Cara Canington 
and Krista Grabher will lead the team — loaded with 11 true freshmen — into the 
ﬁ  rst top-ﬁ  ve match of the season. 
With the ﬁ  rst game of the season just 
a day away, freshmen Mollie Stevens and 
Chloe O’Haire are ready to get on the ﬁ  eld 
in their ﬁ  rst collegiate game.
“I’m so excited,” O’Haire said. “I’m re-
ally nervous though.  I can’t believe that it is already happening; I feel like it all hap-pened so fast.”
Junior All-American Shannon Gilroy 
has been a part of the welcome committee 
for the newest additions to the team. The 
two seniors, Gilroy and the rest of the ju-nior class have been instrumental in mak-ing the freshmen feel a part of the team, 
O’Haire said.
Gilroy has been a major contributor for 
Florida, scoring a team-high 52 goals last 
season and ﬁ  nishing second on the team 
with 65 points. 
Florida started its season with a win 
against UNC in 2013 — the team’s ﬁ  rst win 
against North Carolina since the program began in 2010.  Florida went on to complete the season 18-3 and 4-1 in the American Lacrosse 
Conference.
“I know the past few 
years we’ve only had one 
win against UNC, and we’ve played them ﬁ  rst ev-
ery year and that was last 
year,” Gilroy said. “From 
that game on our momen-
tum just got better and better, so hopefully that will happen again this year.”
The Tar Heels went 18-3 last season and 
ﬁ  nished 4-1 in Atlantic-Coast-Conference 
play, completing the year with the school’s 
ﬁ  rst national championship. 
Coach Amanda O’Leary said her team’s matchup against UNC would be a tough game and noted that it just recently lost to 
the U.S. lacrosse team in double overtime.
“They’re a great team, they have tons of 
talent, they’re fast, and they have experi-
ence,” O’Leary said.
Starting off the season with a win would 
be great for Florida, especially because the 
team is is so young and expectations are so 
great, Gilroy said.
“We lost a core group of girls who had 
a lot of expectations for themselves, so now 
I think we have our own expectations that 
we want to reach,” Gilroy said. 
“Starting on Saturday, we’re just going 
to go in and play our best no matter the outcome.”Inexperienced UF opening season against reigning champions
