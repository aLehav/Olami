� THE CRASH INVOLVED EIGHT VEHICLES.

The life of UF student Shannon Kane, 22, was cut 
short early Monday morning in a traffic accident on 
I-75 involving eight vehicles in north Marion County, south of Gainesville.
Kane was a graduate teaching assistant for UF’s 
bands and working on her master’s degree in wind conducting. She was also the director of the UF wom-en’s volleyball pep band. She earned her bachelor’s degree from Syracuse University. 
Susana Cruz, 52, the mother of a UF student, also 
died in the crash, said UF spokesman Steve Orlando. There were no other deaths or serious injuries, accord-ing to officials.
The accident began around 5:40 a.m. when the 
driver of a 2000 Ford F-150 lost control and crashed into the median, causing six other vehicles to crash, according to the Florida Highway Patrol crash report.
Kane, originally a passenger in one 
of the vehicles involved, was killed when she was knocked off the interstate’s overpass by a vehicle that struck the vehicle she was standing next to, pushing her onto a car traveling below on State Road 326. 
Cruz, driving a 2007 Toyota, struck the initial ve-
hicle that crashed into the median and was then struck from behind by another vehicle. She was ejected 100 to 150 feet from her car, said Heather Danenhower, a spokeswoman for Marion County Fire Rescue. Cruz’s 
car then caught fire, Danenhower said.  Both women 
were taken to Shands at UF where they were later pro-nounced dead. The I-75 southbound lane was closed for about five hours after the accident. 
An e-mail sent to music students Monday by UF 
assistant professor John Watkins stated that Kane’s boyfriend, Michael Ubbens, was in the car with Kane at the time of the crash. Watkins told students that re-hearsals and concerts for UF’s bands have been can-
celed for the week and funeral services are planned for 
later this week in Kane’s hometown of Saylorsburg, Penn. Counseling will be available on Wednesday at 1:55 p.m. at the Steinbrenner Band Hall, he wrote.
Katelyn Bailey, a UF health education junior, said 
she will remember Kane’s infectious smile.
“Every time you saw her she was always smiling, 
just radiating,” she said.
“It really is true; the good die young,” she said. 
“She was very undeserving of that kind of death.”Crash on

Maurice watches TV at Safety Cab 
headquarters, a Gainesville taxi com-
pany, in between dispatching drivers.
He picks up three, sometimes four, 
channels through the antenna that sits on top of the set.
But by June 12 there won’t be any 
signal.
Today would have been the initial 
date for the transition from analog to digital, but the mandatory switch was 
pushed back three months. Networks 
can switch today if they choose, requir-ing people who want to continue to watch their old TVs to buy a converter 
or switch to cable.
The least expensive converter on 
Radio Shack’s Web site is $60. To help with the switch, the Bush administra-
tion set up a $40 coupon program, but the program, which ran out of money, 
has a waiting list now millions long.
The switch from analog to digital signal will free up parts of the broad-
cast spectrum, some of which will be auctioned to wireless Internet compa-
nies, according to a government Web 
site. Emergency services will also use the new space to communicate.
“The switch will provide a unifor-
mity of quality,” said Mike Giampietro, general manager at Cox Communica-
tions.
But Maurice, who did not give a last 
name, is skeptical of the switch.
“They say they’re doing us a favor,” 
Maurice said. “But it’s really about the 
money.”

Clinton warns North Korea against missile launch
TOKYO (AP) — U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clin-
ton says a possible missile launch hinted at by North Korea should 
not be carried out.
Clinton, in Japan on her first trip abroad in her new position, 
said Tuesday that such a launch would hurt relations. “The pos-sible missile launch that North Korea is talking about would be very unhelpful,” she said in a news conference.
On Monday, the 67th birthday of North Korean leader Kim 
Jong Il, Pyongyang claimed it has the right to “space develop-ment” — a term it has used previously to disguise a missile test as a satellite launch.2, ALLIGATOR � TUESDAY, FEBRUARY 17, 2009

Authorities scale back search for missing Fla. girl 
SATSUMA, Fla. (AP) — Au-
thorities have scaled back their 
search for a missing 5-year-old girl who vanished from her home last week and a volunteer search 
group has been dismantled.
Putnam County Sheriff’s of-
ficials said they sent about 50 of-
ficers Monday to a wooded area that had not previously been searched after receiving a tip on Haleigh Cummings’ disappear-ance, but nothing was found. That agency has since scaled 
back and will now search in stra-
tegic places if they receive tips, saying searching the same areas repeatedly is not feasible.
Volunteer group Texas Equu-Search suspended their efforts to find the little girl who disap-peared Tuesday.
Haleigh’s parents are di-
vorced. She was being watched by her father’s 17-year-old girl-
friend, Misty Croslin, when 
she vanished from his home.
Crist talks stimulus with 
agency heads 
TALLAHASSEE, Fla. (AP) 
— There’s nothing like a few 
billion dollars to make a gov-ernor smile.
Florida’s Charlie Crist was 
beaming Monday when he met with some agency heads to discuss the federal govern-ment’s stimulus package that should help Florida lawmak-ers meet budget demands over the next three years despite the state’s floundering economy.
“I couldn’t be more pleased 
on how this turned out,” Crist said, adding the measure Congress passed Friday came “with great gratitude from Florida.”
Crist directed his agency 
heads to line up their proj-ects so they can get started as soon as the first dollars begin 
flowing. More than $12 billion 
is anticipated over the next three years from the stimulus package President Obama is expected to sign into law this week.
“This may in fact be a three-
peat,” Crist said, noting the money will help Florida plug its budget hole for the fiscal year ending June 30 as well as the next two years.
“I am committed to making 
sure that Florida is prepared to use the funds quickly and ef-ficiently,” Crist said. “We re-main focused on directing these 
dollars toward Florida’s infra-
structure, work force training and educational and Medicaid needs.”
CORRECTIONSA Monday article in the Al-

as having said 7,000 students 
would be checking their online admissions status and UF’s second application deadline is March 1. Orlando actually said 27,000 students would be check-ing their status and UF’s second deadline is March 31.
In an article Monday, the Al-
ligator misattributed a quote to Ben Dictor on the front page. The quote, “You don’t stop a cock fight by adding more cocks to the fight,” was actually said by Keg Party presidential candi-date Frank Walch.

A man allegedly impersonating a police 
officer was arrested after he was accused 
of holding a female escort captive in his house. 
The escort was sent to the house of Rickie 
Keith, 55, during the early morning of Feb. 6.
After the escort told Keith she would not have sex with him for money, he showed her a police badge that said GPD and told the 
woman he was a police officer,  the arrest 
report stated.
According to the report, Keith told the 
escort that she was not allowed to leave and there were other police officers along the street watching his house.
 He also threatened the escort with crimi-
nal charges. 
After an hour and a half of asking her 
about the escort business, Keith fell asleep and the escort left, the report stated.
According to the report, 
at the time of his arrest, he told officers he had not hired or called an escort service in a long time and had never had an escort at his current address of 4234 
NE 17th Terrace.
Keith told police that 
a woman called his cell 
phone last week, asked for him by name and accused him of impersonating a GPD officer to keep her in the house against her will. 
He told police that he didn’t know what 
the escort was talking about and was un-aware as to how she got his number or knew his name, the report stated.
Keith also couldn’t explain how the 
woman was able to describe his appearance and identify him from a photo lineup.
Keith was charged with false imprison-
ment, prostitution and impersonating a law 
enforcement officer. Man accused of impersonating police, prostitution

This semester’s Student Gov-
ernment elections made history on 
Friday, and the votes haven’t even 
been cast yet. 
According to  Supervisor of Elec-
tions Dan Siegel, more than 90 ab-sentee ballots were requested, the 
most in SG history. Last year there were fewer than 10, he said.Siegel credited the large spike in 
absentee ballot requests to the large number of parties competing in the 
election.
“This is the most competitive 
election in Student Government his-tory with four parties,” Siegel said.  
Sen. Sam Miorelli said the Or-
ange and Blue Party pushed the ab-sentee ballot because one of its can-
didates, Molly Flynn, is a pharmacy student at Jacksonville’s satellite UF 
campus. Flynn campaigned to get stu-
dents to request absentee ballots at 
satellite campuses in Jacksonville 
and Orlando, which made up the majority of ballot requests.  
Joshua Simmons, the Progress 
Party president, said his party pro-vided absentee forms at their table 
on the Plaza of the Americas all last week.
Although the Keg Party did not 
add to absentee ballot increase, Frank Bracco, its president, said ab-
sentee ballots are a great way to get 
more people involved in student government.  
Jordan Johnson, Unite Party’s candidate for Student Body presi-dent, said it is great to see more students taking interest in Student 
Government. The Unite Party mem-
bers also had absentee ballot request forms available when they were 
campaigning, he said.  
“I’m glad students know their re-
sources are available to them,” John-son said. “The goal is to make voter 
accessibility available to all students, especially those not on the UF cam-
pus every day.” SG sees huge increase in requests for absentee ballots
“This is the most com -
petitive election in Student 
Government history with 
four parties.”

To combat youth violence in Gaines-
ville, the National Organization of Black 
Law Enforcement Executives (NOBLE) is partnering with the Gainesville Po-lice Department and the State Attor-ney’s Office.
The three organizations will apply 
for juvenile violence grants, host youth town hall meetings and try to get lo-cals involved in decreasing juvenile violence rates, according to a NOBLE release.
The organization will kick off the 
partnership with a 
meeting March 4, said 
training coordinator 
Pamela Chapman.
“Instead of adults talking at the 
youth, telling them what to do, the 
youth will be telling the adults what 
they think the problems are,” Chap-
man said.
She said community leaders and 
concerned Gainesville citizens, includ-
ing children, will meet to discuss juve-
nile violence and strategies  for inter-
vention.
NOBLE previously met in five cit-
ies and compiled recommendations for 
addressing youth violence. 
NOBLE National President Joseph 
McMillan said that  communities must 
brainstorm new ideas to address youth violence. 
“This partnership highlights NO-
BLE’s ongoing efforts to reduce juve-nile violence in America,” he said.

The Unite Party posted its 
platform online Monday night.
The platform, which has 15 
points, addresses issues such as 
building a sustainable campus, 
parking problems and strenuous 
textbook costs. 
“We have very innovative, cool 
ideas that will definitely make a difference on campus,” said Ash-
ton Charles, party spokeswoman. 
“A lot of ideas are recycled every election.”
Some key ideas include add-
ing motion sensors to dorm hall-ways and common areas to save energy, increasing the use of on-line class materials and creating a parking garage solely for stu-
dents.
Charles said the Unite Party plans to take $2 from every park-
ing ticket in order to pay for the 
new garage. 
According to Charles, the par-ty spent six hours a day for three days on the Reitz Union Colon-
nade gathering student input on white boards before talking ideas over with Senate candidates and 
completing the platform.
“We wanted to see what stu-
dents were really concerned 
with,” she said.
She also added that Unite Par-
ty presidential candidate Jordan Johnson, who is currently SG Sen-ate president, has already started 
working with some people to get 
the ball rolling.
“These are tangible things that 
can be accomplished,” she said. 
In addition to the 15 key 
points, Charles said the party will develop college-specific plat-forms in the coming days.

� THE PLATFORM ADDRESSES 
EIGHT THEMES.
By CHELSEA KEENAN 
Alligator Writer
 
The Orange and Blue Party released its 
platform online Monday night. It addresses 
eight themes, including sustainability, free 
printing and transportation. 
“We think we brought the best candidates, 
who really sat down and pounded out inno-vative ideas,” said Mark McShera, the party’s 
candidate for Student Body president. 
McShera said one of the biggest issues on 
the platform is the “Rally in Tally,” which 
will happen in March.
Party members plan to bring a group of 
students to the state capitol in order to lobby for a “fully funded university,” despite the budget cuts.
“We need to mobilize students,” McShera 
said.
According to McShera the platform’s points came from Senate candidates as well 
as party leaders. However, Senate candidates 
were encouraged to talk to their student con-
stituents in order to get a sense of other needs that 
may have been unful-
filled in the past.
McShera said candidates came up with 
ideas after speaking with constituents and friends, such as creating a scooter repair cen-
ter on campus similar to that of the campus 
bike repair.McShera hopes the ideas on the Orange 
and Blue Party platform will interest stu-dents and push them to the polls. He ex-plained how on-campus turnout can have a larger impact. 
“An increase in student involvement in 
Student Government means they are more likely to vote in local elections and national elections,” he said.

The Progress Party’s interactive platform has been avail-
able since Wednesday, allowing students to view and rank 
its key points online.
Once students view the party’s stance on issues such as 
a 24-hour library, expanded recycling efforts and available 
Senate records in order to produce a more transparent Stu-
dent Government, they can give the issues a ranking from one star to five stars. 
“To be able to go online and see everything is encourag-
ing students to participate in Student Government in ways 
we haven’t seen in the past,” said Eric Conrad, the party’s communications di-rector. 
Conrad said in order to compile the 
platform, party members surveyed students around campus to unearth issues important to UF’s Student Body.
Collected answers were added to ideas given by the par-
ty’s Senate candidates before the eight-prong platform was finalized. 
“We’ve got the best from all the parties,” Conrad said, 
referring to the party’s ticket, which carries candidates from the Gator Party and the Orange and Blue Party, as well as those who have never been involved with Student Govern-
ment before. “Our platform is one of our strongest assets.”
Conrad added that one factor distinguishes the Progress 
Party’s platform from its opponents’ ideas.
“What matters is that we’ll make an effort,” he said, 
“rather than just bringing an issue up during the election 
cycle.”
Conrad said other ideas the party plans to pursue are 
modernizing SG’s bike repair services and obtaining student input on how money is spent on Reitz Union affairs.

119 TOTAL VOTESNo chance for Enron 2.0 under ObamaColumn
Thanks but no thanksTesting Turmoil
High school athletes no 
longer face drug screens
The Enron-aissance may finally be over.
When Enron exploded in late 2001, the news 
media descended upon Houston to pick clean the 
carcass of a wholly despicable entity.
Somebody made a documentary that got some criti-
cal acclaim and every news channel sent reporters to 
Texas to interview “regular folks” who lost their jobs and their pensions. 
A small group of top officials got creampuff sentenc-
es in white-collar penal resorts, and the big boss of the company went ahead and died on a ski trip to Aspen while awaiting trial. 
False profit statements pasted over huge hidden 
debts were only the most visible of Enron’s many finan-cial crimes. 
The culture of corruption in that corporation spread 
much further than some cooked books. Enron was only a symptom of the sickness.
Having discarded that one bad apple, we decided to 
just turn around and pretend that everything was all better. 
More worried about Sept. 11 and the impending war, 
the American system could not handle cleaning up a mess that obviously extended far beyond just one com-pany and their “rogue traders.”
Those traders scurried to the shelter of the banking 
system, where crazy and barely ethical schemes became as commonplace as expensive suits and erectile dys-function. 
The old white guys at the top of the game cashed 
their checks and walked away from the smoldering fire — but not until after they lit their cigars.
This year, “60 Minutes” and “Frontline” explored the 
Enron-aissance as it seeped into every part of American life and eventually poisoned the entire world. 
In 2006, the total global output 
of all nations was $47 trillion. The 
total of all stock and bond markets 
was $117 trillion — but the deriva-tive markets were dealing with $473 trillion.
Keep in mind that America 
spearheads this insane growth 
while fighting wars on two fronts.
Every aspect of this blooming flower of fraud was 
unprecedented in history.
Maybe it felt good to pretend that we all had a chunk 
of that fake money in our own bank accounts, but real-ity had to intervene at some point in the near future. 
Enter President Obama.Among the clattering responses to the colossal 
spending plan Obama  will sign into law today is an 
important clause limiting executive pay at companies 
that accept bailout money. 
These limits will include deep cuts to the shameless 
bonuses that CEOs and VPs have used to siphon off mil-lions of dollars in essentially stolen money. 
Many in the media are worrying about how a 
$500,000 limit on executive salary will drive top execu-tives to competing world markets, where their “talents” allow them to entertain offers in the tens of millions. 
But really, these spineless individuals have spear-
headed our descent into an Enron-aissance of corrup-tion and twisted capitalism into an empty charade. Can we afford to give them anything more?

by an escort when inquiring about the cost of having sex, one local man pretended to be a police officer, even go-ing as far as to wave a badge in the woman’s face.
The would-be john 
flashed credentials similar to ones used by local law enforcement and informed the woman that more police 
were waiting on the street.
What ensued was an 
hour-and-a-half-long im-
prisonment that featured the “cop” asking the escort a series of questions about her line of work before he finally fell asleep.
Escorts around the area 
can now breath a deep sigh of relief, as this pathetic per-petrator currently calls Ala-chua County jail home.
The Editorial Board 
thinks that impersonating a police officer is nothing to kid around about. 
The escort was put into a 
rather precarious situation, but fortunately walked away without suffering any physi-cal harm.
While her line of work 
may not be the most whole-some way to earn a living, we applaud the woman for not giving into his demands 
and turning her charade into 
an illegal activity.
What we find most hilari-
ous is the fact that the man engaged the escort in an “in-terview” of sorts to gather information about her pro-fession.
Maybe he’s just a big fan 
of “Frost/Nixon.”As economic woes ravage Florida, cutbacks in the state’s public school system abound.
From teachers losing their jobs to the elimination 
of enrichment programs, the effects of the financial crisis have hit the Sunshine State hard.
The latest to receive the axe? Florida’s pilot anti-steroid 
program for high school athletes.
According to a Gainesville Sun article, state officials blame 
the economy for having to eliminate the randomly adminis-tered testing.
The program cost the state $100,000 per year because of 
the steep price of $166 per test — all to find one athlete guilty of abusing performance-enhancing drugs.
In the wake of Alex Rodriguez’s steroid admission as well 
as undeniable suspicion surrounding other athletes, the Edi-torial Board is not quick to dismiss the importance of random steroid testing for high school athletes.
Students in their mid-teens are highly impressionable 
individuals who may have no qualms justifying steroid use after seeing star athletes in professional baseball who made using the drug almost commonplace.
While only one high school student was caught using ste-
roids, who knows how many others were deterred solely due to the risk of being randomly subjected to testing?
We realize that the state of Florida is strapped for cash 
and that any available funds should be directed into the classroom. 
But don’t think for a second that a fringe college prospect 
won’t entertain thoughts of subjecting his body to steroids as a potential athletic scholarship hangs in the balance.

Drugging concerns belittled
Monday’s article titled, “Wom-
en drugged in bar” belittles the is-
sue of how completely disgusting it is to drug anyone in an effort 
to make them unaware of their 
actions and have no memory of what has happened to them.
Using a Grog security guard’s 
estimation of the instance of drug-
ging short-changes the issue, as if 
it is not important enough to get information from a more autho-
rized source. The security guard is 
surely not on duty every night of 
the week, nor is he notified every 
time a drugging has occurred.
Assuming the guard is a quali-
fied source of information, Hunt-er Sizemore writes that drugging 
is uncommon in Gainesville bars, 
meaning the guard hears of a case every six months.  Again, this 
reporting understates the sicken-
ing act of drugging someone by 
implying that somehow drug-
ging only every six months is ac-ceptable or even good, when it is 
never acceptable behavior.
Leah Greenblum
4LSLetters to the Editor
Column
The first 100 days of a new presidency 
are supposedly a telling period, a unique window of time in which a 
president can enact big change. It’s a com-pletely arbitrary deadline, devoid of any real 
significance, but it has become conventional 
wisdom nonetheless. Why do we accept this absurd notion that only in the shell-shocked aftermath of an election can meaningful policy be shoved through our cantankerous political system?
Presidential terms are four years long. 
That’s 1,461 days. What do we expect Presi-dent Barack Obama to do for the final 1,361, 
learn to fiddle? I suppose he could follow 
former President George W. Bush’s lead and start a war or two to maintain relevance.
This obsession with the first 100 days is 
closely linked to another stale bit of Washing-ton lingo, the concept of political capital.
“Obama looks to cash in political capital,” 
blared the headline on CNN’s Political Tick-er. The author’s shrewd analysis followed: 
“President Barack Obama, who arguably 
won a large chunk of political capital in the 2008 election, is now looking to cash in as he urges Congress to pass a massive economic stimulus package.”
Such descriptions treat political capital 
like a pile of poker chips. It’s a finite stash — spend it wisely because when it’s depleted, the game becomes pretty difficult to win.
This oversimplification ignores those pres-
idents who have enacted serious, substantive policy well into their tenures, after the evapo-ration of their supposed political capital. We should view political capital as something more elusive and less ephemeral than the spoils of victory. Per-
haps political capital 
is simply a president’s ability to mobilize the country behind an agenda. In this sense, 
it’s not necessarily how many legislators want to work with you, but rather how many people want legislators to work with you. The most effective presidents, executives like 
Reagan and FDR, sustained their political 
capital by bringing the people with them to Congress, not vice versa.
If this is the template of an effective presi-
dency, one that successfully converts plat-form into policy, then we may be witnessing the beginning of a hugely effective presiden-cy, and the dawn of some truly monumental shifts in our political landscape.
The last two weeks have offered two main 
lessons: Americans largely trust Obama to do the right thing, and Republicans will be hard pressed to stop him.
When the stimulus package was origi-
nally introduced, the Republican talking-point-machine exploded. Congressional Re-publicans, fueled by Rush Limbaugh and his ditto-heads, pulled their criticisms straight 
out of 1980, deriding the stimulus bill as a 
“liberal wish-list” filled with “wasteful Wash-ington spending.” Never mind that stimulus without spending is technically impossible — they had their sound byte, and they were running with it.
Analysts and jittery Democrats fretted 
that Obama was “losing control of the mes-sage,” and many wondered if our new presi-
dent knew how to play hardball. Obama, 
serene as usual, bypassed the Washington echo chamber and took his case directly to the people. He explained his recovery pack-age at a prime-time press conference and several town hall meetings thereafter, calmly brushing aside any criticism of the plan and reminding Americans that this recession is real and growing but solvable.
In the end, only three Republican senators 
supported the president’s recovery package. Yet as it turned out, that was all he needed. The bill will be signed into law today. For Re-publicans, this must have been a startling re-alization — that Obama can do so much with the consent of so few.
Through it all, the president’s approval 
ratings have remained unchanged, hovering 
in the 60s and 70s and providing him with 
ample clout for the months to come. Repub-licans in Congress, meanwhile, are mired in the 30s where they started. In other words, “Just say no” may not be the right answer. I’m sure they’ll keep looking.
In the meantime, they may find them-
selves hoping that Obama’s political capital is an expendable sum and not a sustainable 
quality. Because if he can sustain it, they’re 
screwed.

its first conference win, but it 
showed something else that could haunt the Gators down the stretch. They are missing an essential element for teams 
heading into the postseason: 
competitiveness.
I don’t mean that they don’t 
care if they win or lose, but there doesn’t seem to be a whole lot of competitive fire outside of guard Nick Calathes. As the intensity of games is ratcheted up at this stage, that can be ex-
posed more than ever.
There was the last-second 
meltdown in Columbia, S.C., 
that led to a 70-69 loss against South Carolina. Then came the near-collapse against the Gamecocks at home, giving up a late 3-pointer and missing free throws to lose at Kentucky 
and failing to outgun lowly 
Georgia on Saturday.
UF still has a great chance of 
getting to the tourney, though. ESPN’s Joe Lunardi currently has them slated as a No. 10 seed, and at 6-4 in the SEC, the Gators just need to scrape out three or four wins against Ala-
bama, Vanderbilt, at LSU, Ten-
nessee, at Mississippi State and Kentucky.
Those first two should be 
easy wins for a team with as much on the line as UF, but then the Gators will have to face four teams who are also vying for bids. And after that, 
they’ll still have to avoid a one-
and-done showing at the con-ference tournament.
UF got this far by feasting 
on weak opponents (non-con-ference strength of schedule is No. 244), but now comes the true test of this team’s tough-ness and character.
At this point, I can’t imagine 
the Gators getting far if they make the tournament. Sure, they could have a hot shoot-ing streak or Calathes could go nuts, but somewhere between now and then they’ll have to overcome some adversity.
If they do that in the coming 
weeks, they’ll make the tour-nament and maybe even win a game. 
If they don’t, they could 
still slide into the postseason on those SEC food stamps, but don’t expect anything more than a 40-minute showcase of Calathes’ skills for NBA 
scouts.TUESDAY, FEBRUARY 17, 2009 � ALLIGATOR, 15

UF sophomore offensive lineman Carl Johnson 
was arrested Monday for violating a restraining or-
der, according to an Alachua County police report.
According to the report, Johnson was served with 
a temporary injunction for protection against sexual 
violence on Feb. 9, and he knowingly violated the 
order.
Johnson entered an RTS bus near 
Springs Residential Complex on Mon-day and sat across the aisle from the woman who filed the restraining order. He stayed on the bus until she exited at the Hub, according to the report.
The report said Johnson “was given several op-
portunities” to get off the bus at other stops.
Johnson was charged with a count of contempt 
of court, a  first-degree misdemeanor, the report 
stated.
Johnson, who started eight games at left guard 
this season because of injuries to senior Jim Tartt, 
was booked at the Alachua County Jail on Monday.
“We are aware of the report and we are in the 
process of gathering all of the details,” UF spokes-man Steve McClain said.

country.Johnson charged for violating court order

THE ASSOCIATED PRESS
JACKSONVILLE — Former UF 
running back Fred Taylor wanted 
to end his career in Jacksonville, 
hoping to join the small list of 
standout players who spent an entire career with the same team.
He won’t get the chance.The Jaguars released Taylor 
on Monday, parting ways with 
their all-time leading rusher af-
ter 11 seasons and continuing the team’s off-season makeover.
Coach Jack Del Rio flew to 
Fort Lauderdale on Monday to 
meet with Taylor and deliver the news. Del Rio made it clear 
the team has no plans to re-sign 
Taylor, who turned 33 last month and was scheduled to make $6 
million next season.
“We felt like the best thing for 
this football team is what it has to 
be about,” Del Rio said. 
“We feel good about the tal-
ented group of backs that we 
have ... and as you work through it, it’s difficult to come up with a 
role that’s going to be acceptable for everybody.
“It makes it awkward. It makes 
it difficult. We came to an agree-
ment on what the best course of 
action was as a football team.”
And that was to move on 
without Taylor, who ranks 16th 
on the NFL’s career rushing list with 11,271 yards, 81 behind John 
Riggins.Jaguars release RB Taylor after 11-year run with team
The same is true of a freshman 
class that has been heavily relied 
upon since it set foot on campus.
Depth and development are 
luxuries the Gators just can’t af-ford these days.
“The role that they’re in right 
now is different than the role we had envisioned,” Donovan said.
The most promising young 
big man, Kenny Kadji, has shown 
signs of being a pillar Donovan can build on in the future.
Unfortunately for the Gators, 
that day is probably still a few years away.
“It’s hard, but you can’t get 
down on yourself,” Kadji said. 
“We don’t want to make excuses. We just have to do better.”
Allan Chaney, one of the 
team’s better rebounders, had begun to work his way into the rotation before going down with a stress fracture in his left heel.
“I thought Chaney was getting 
better. It’s disappointing he’s hurt now. I would have liked to see how he would have progressed, 
but by no 
means was he 
the answer,” 
Donovan said. “I think Kadji’s development 
is really, really 
important go-
ing forward.”
UF is eighth in rebounding 
margin, last in offensive rebounds 
and last in blocked shots in the 
Southeastern Conference this sea-son through Feb. 11.
The Gators’ lack of size has 
caused defensive matchup prob-
lems down low all year, a flaw 
highlighted by a loss to a physical 
Georgia team Saturday.
“There’s no question that our 
lack of size in the frontcourt has 
nothing to do with wanting to 
recruit that way,” Donovan said. 
“We won two national champi-onships with three monsters up front. We would like to have that 
size across the front line, but we 
don’t have it.”Freshmen Kadji, Chaney pick up slack for Gators

of the four players, as he started in 39 
games last year and 27 as a freshman. Al-though he has seen the most action, he has struggled at the plate. He was last on the team out of the regular players with a .220 
batting average last year.
Cooper, who also plays wide receiv-
er for the UF football team, has shown 
glimpses of brilliance, most coming in the last week of practice as he grew acclimat-ed to seeing live pitching again.
“He has been picking it up a lot the last 
couple of weeks,” O’Sullivan said. “He shows flashes of being really good, and he 
shows sometimes he’s really behind.”It could take most of the season to de-
termine who will be the regular right field-er, but the Gators have sure things at the 
other two outfield spots 
with senior Avery Barnes 
in left and junior Matt den Dekker in center.
Barnes is coming off 
his best year as a Gator. He led the team in hits, runs, batting average and 
stolen bases in 2008.
As for den Dekker, he 
has been receiving most of the preseason 
hype for UF following his breakout year. He has been named to Baseball America’s Preseason All-America Second Team and the National Collegiate Baseball Writers Association Preseason All-America Sec-ond Team. He was also named to the 2009 Wallace Watch List for the trophy awarded 
to the best college player, alongside team-
mates Patrick Keating and Josh Adams.
Starting the last two years has provided 
den Dekker and Barnes with the knowl-edge of what to expect from each other.
“Once you get comfortable with some-
body and get used to them, you get a lot more trustworthy, and we have built that with each other,” Barnes said.
O’Sullivan expects finding the third 
outfielder to be a slow process and is not in a rush to name a starter.
“You don’t have to have your line-
up set when Game 1 starts,” O’Sullivan said. “The goal is to try different options and different combinations to see what works.” Barnes, den Dekker lend experience to left, center field

TODAY IN UF SPORTS HISTORY I DID NOT KNOW THAT POLL QUESTIONEvery year in football, some 
“awesome” Big Ten team cruis-es through the regular season, 
picks up tons of hype and lands in either the national title game or some 
other prestigious BCS contest.
It’s like welfare for college football. 
They rarely have to face a real chal-
lenge en route to a postseason payday, 
and it rightly angers Southeastern Con-
ference and UF fans to see it happen.
Welcome to the other side of the 
fence.
When it comes to basketball, the 
Gators are the ones taking advantage 
of weak competition, and if they’re able to make the NCAA Tournament, they have their sloppy conference to thank.
They have an RPI of 45, the nation’s 107th-toughest schedule, and their only wins against the RPI top 50 are 
Washington and 
South Carolina.
Before last 
week, UF seemed like a lock for the Big Dance, but nar-
row losses at Kentucky and Georgia have sent it tumbling from first in the 
SEC East to fourth — behind Ken-
tucky, Tennessee and South Carolina, which are in a three-way tie.
The 88-86 loss to the Bulldogs 
was humiliating, as it gave Georgia Andrew Stanfill / Alligator Staff

Apparently, the Gators’ frontcourt struggles are all 
Marreese Speights’ fault.
According to UF coach Billy Donovan, the absence 
of the former Gators forward, who now plays for the 
Philadelphia 76ers, is at least in part to blame for the 
team’s poor showing this year. 
“The one thing you can never forecast is guys leav-
ing early, and when the season started last year I don’t 
think anyone thought that Marreese 
Speights would be gone,” Donovan 
said. “Our frontcourt complexion looks 
totally different.”
Speights’ early departure left Dono-
van with a hole to fill under the basket 
and without the personnel to do so.
While sophomore Alex Tyus, a more natural power 
forward, has performed well playing out of position at 
center this year, others have not fared as well.
“There’s no question there’s some limitations there,” 
Donovan said. “I think Alex has made a nice jump from 
last year to this year. I think Dan (Werner) has had a 
tougher time.”
With Speights gone, players who were originally 
intended to serve in complementary roles are being 
forced to play starters’ minutes.
“It’s tough for Dan to line up 30 minutes a night and 
expect him to go get 10 to 12 rebounds or do some of the 
things we ask of him,” Donovan said. “But inside what his ability is, I think he’s doing all he can possibly do. We really felt like Dan was going to be a great comple-ment player.”Donovan blames Speights for frontcourt troubles
UF benefits from weak SECUF BASEBALL

Gators fans should not expect only 
one player in right field for UF this year 
— coach Kevin O’Sullivan certainly doesn’t.
Juniors Jonathan Pigott and Riley Coo-
per entered spring practice as the likely favorites for the starting job in right, but two freshmen have emerged as candi-dates for playing time.
Tyler Thompson and Daniel Pigott, 
Jonathan’s younger brother, have im-pressed O’Sullivan enough that he ex-pects them to compete right away.
“Obviously with the older guys, they 
are doing what we expected them to do at this point, but I’m really pleased with how the freshmen have been playing,” O’Sullivan said.
The quality of at-bats they have had against the older pitchers in scrimmages have put them in the race.
O’Sullivan said Thompson has been 
swinging the bat as well as anyone else on the team, especially considering he is coming off ACL surgery.
While the two freshmen bring youth 
and excitement to the table, the older Pig-ott and Cooper offer their own positives.
