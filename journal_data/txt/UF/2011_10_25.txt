  Spencer Pylant remembers watching 
the NBA championship game in 2006. 
The Miami Heat had won four out of 
six games against the Dallas Mavericks. 
He remembers Shaquille O’Neal’s drive and push. 
  “It’s amazing the way he smashes and 
drives toward the basket,” said Pylant, 23, a second-year management graduate student. “He does whatever it takes to get the ball in the hoop.”
  O’Neal is an actor, media personality 
and rapper. 
He is pursuing his Ph.D. at Barry Uni-
versity and has served as a reserve officer in Los Angeles and Miami Beach. 
  He’s also a famous 
basketball player.
  Tonight at 8,  O’Neal 
will speak to students and the public in a mod-erated conversation at 
the O’Connell Center. 
Admission is free. Accent Speakers Bu-
reau is paying him $70,000 to speak.
  “We’re bringing him because he is not 
only a sports icon but a [NBA] legend,” said Corey Portnoy, Accent chairman and a political science senior.
  O’Neal will talk about his sports ca-
reer, what it’s like to be Shaq, his enter-tainment career and life after 19 years in the NBA.
  He was a member of four NBA cham-
pionship teams, and he was voted NBA Most Valuable Player in 2000 and NBA Rookie of the Year in 1993. 
In July, he signed a contract to be an 
NBA analyst on TNT.
  “A lot of students are fans of his,” Port-
noy said. “So many students from UF are from the Miami area, and he played for the Heat.”
Portnoy expects about 3,000 people to 
attend. Accent brings 
Shaq to speak at O’Connell Center tonight

  The Gator Nation has proved, once 
again, that it likes to be on top.
  In the 2011 Trojan Sexual Health Re-
port Card, UF ranked No. 8 in sexual health resources out of 141 surveyed U.S. schools. Last year, UF came in at No. 17.
  The ranking methods are close to 
students’ actual perceptions, said Bert Sperling, owner of  Sperling’s BestPlaces, which conducted the research. 
  Schools were graded on services in 
13 categories including convenience and availability of health centers, condom and contraceptive availabilities, HIV or STI testing, outreach programs, website usability and sexual assault resources.
  Sperling, who has done the research 
for all six of the annual report cards, said student health centers also receive a questionnaire to ﬁ  ll out as part of the project.
  GatorWell Health Promotion Special-
ist Samantha Evans said she is aware of the rankings but has never been contact-ed.
  Evans said GatorWell offers a wide 
variety of sexual-health education. Student organizations and classes can request presentations as part of Gator-  UF makes top 10 list for sexual health

  With two classes left to complete, Tori Petry, 19, worries about 
receiving her UF Honors Program certiﬁ  cate.   
  The telecommunication sophomore completed two of four re-
quired courses during the ﬁ  rst semester of her freshman year and has not enrolled in honors classes since. 
  For Petry and other honors undergraduates, fulﬁ  lling the Hon-
ors Program requirements just got a bit easier. Honors undergrad-uate students who enroll in graduate courses can now use these upper-level courses to fulﬁ  ll the program’s completion require-ments.   
  Prior to this change, students could only select from a list of 
speciﬁ  c honors courses, which varied by semester, to complete the four-class requirement needed to receive the program’s certiﬁ  cate of completion.  Graduate courses now count for honors credit

Fried butter, spinning amusement rides and perform-
ing seals heralded the Alachua County Fair’s first week-
end, attracting thousands. In 2010, the county had to do without its fair, and orga-
nizers are rebuilding after the hiatus.
The Alachua County Fair was canceled in 2010 because 
the previous operation owed exhibitors and advertisers money.
Because of the owed money, Alachua County officials would not allow the fair to use the county fairgrounds, and the fair’s 40-year run was scrubbed.
Stephen White, owner of Dade City-based Event Mar -
keting Corp., which is hosting the fair, said the turnout was good for the first weekend, and visitors seemed to enjoy themselves.
He said that’s the key to rebuilding a county fair. 
White couldn’t provide an exact crowd count, but said thousands of people showed up Saturday and Sunday.
“We aren’t as concerned about the numbers as we are 
concerned about the happiness of the customers who come out,” he said. “I thought the turnout was very good for our first weekend.”
Event Marketing Corp. has a contract to run the fair 
for four more years, and White said he plans to draw in the community as much as possible during those years, especially the agricultural community. Agriculture shows are very popular in the area, he said.
He plans to draw more people who want to show ani-
mals to the fair.
“Agriculture is No. 1,” White said. “I’d like to embrace 
the agricultural community very much so to involve them.”
But more than anything, White said, he wants adults, 
college students and children to come to the fair to enjoy life.
“Fairs as a whole across the United States are a mirror 
image of the community itself,” he said. “This is very im-portant for us to put on the best that we possibly can.”
Other attractions include $2 beers on Tuesday night for 
students who bring a college ID, a live alligator show and live bands such as Dad and the Accidents, Danny Wooten and Southern Slang and Red Paper Birds. 
The fair will continue through Saturday.For more information about fair hours, visit alachua-
countyfair.com.

After a hiatus in 2010 because of unpaid debts, the Alachua County Fair has returned this year. The fair will continue 
through Saturday at the Alachua County Fairgrounds on Northeast 39th Avenue.
Hosts of county fair plan more community outreach for coming yearsAround g AinesvilleStudents who wish to earn their 
certificate must also participate in 
at least one of the following: leader -
ship activities, 50 hours of commu-nity service, study abroad, research or an internship. 
“It occurred to us that students 
later in their career end up taking these graduate courses anyway ,” said Kevin Knudson, Honors Pro-gram director. “And these are wor -
thy of recognition and excellence.” 
The Honors Program offers two 
days of early registration for stu-dents in their first three semesters at UF to sign up for one honors class per day. Early registration for these students will take place Thursday and Friday.
This makes it more difficult for 
juniors and seniors who haven’t ful-filled their requirements to enroll in an honors class.   
Petry said she believes graduate-
level courses will appeal to those juniors and seniors who still want to complete the program but don’t want to be in classes with under -
classmen.
“It can be awkward for seniors to 
sit in a class full of freshmen when they’re older,” she said.
There are about 1,500 students in 
the honors program and about 200 students receive their certificate of completion per year.4, ALLIGATOR §  TUESDAY, OCTOBER 25, 2011

After one and a half years of planning, the bat barn 
and bat house cameras to show the daily lives of UF’s 
bats online are up and running.
The project cost about $15,000 to $20,000 to plan, run 
the electrical and network wiring from the pump house nearby and fix the camera when it gets too dirty from the bats’ daily mess, said Beverly Sensbach, associate direc-tor of the Florida Museum of Natural History.
The bats’ guano covers the protective case the camera 
is held in, which is the No. 1 issue with the camera sys-tem, she said.
The money came from museum grants, investments, 
gift shops, paid exhibits and traveling exhibits, she said.
“We hope it is going to be useful for scientists but also 
for the general public,” she said.
The cameras, positioned in and around the bat house 
and bat barn, will stream the more than 300,000 bats’ daily activities online at all times.
The bats originally lived in the attic of Johnson Hall 
on the UF campus until the hall burnt down in 1987, Sensbach said.
The wandering mammals made their home in the 
eaves of the tennis and track stadiums.
In an effort to get the stinky bats away from the cen-
ter of campus, the university built the bat house in 1991. When that one collapsed in 2009, another was built next to the older structure.
“I hope this [web]site will clear up the bad reputa-
tion bats have,” Sensbach said. “We want people to learn about bats and appreciate their role in Florida’s ecolo-gy.”Bat house cameras now up and running 24/7

Free condoms, HIV testing available on campus
Well’s outreach program, and students sta-
tion the Health Hut around high-traffic ar -
eas of campus.
Evans said GatorWell promotes sexual 
health, among other issues. The Health Hut features different health topics every few weeks such as correct condom use and the importance of getting tested.
Free condoms and lubricant are available at the Health Hut, the main GatorWell office, and at the satellite offices in Jennings Hall and the Springs Area.
GatorWell also offers free HIV testing by 
appointment two days a week.
Murphree Area Resident Assistant Lind-
sey Wuest made her residents a bulletin board about sexual health and STDs. She said several dorms have also brought in “Condom Miranda,” an AIDS Action Coun-cil campaigner who educates students.
Wuest said she thought GatorWell could 
advertise its services better to off-campus students, but overall she was happy with UF’s sexual health education efforts.
Sperling said breaking into the top tier 
on the Trojan Sexual Health Report Card is a hard thing to do.
“Competition is very stiff,” he said. Troj An , from page 1 “Competition is very stiff.”

� THEY CALL FOR AN END TO TUITION HIKES.
ERIN JESTER 
Alligator Writer
The Gainesville Chapter of Students for a Democratic So-
ciety has finalized a proposal calling for a stop to budget cuts 
and outlining possible solutions for balancing UF’s budget.  
The proposal asks administrators to repeal the 15-percent tuition hike passed in June, to not implement any further hikes and to denounce budget cuts imposed by the state Legisla-ture.
The organization also proposed three possible solutions to 
close the financial gap that would be created by repealing the tuition hike.
First, SDS called for UF administrators to dig into the uni-
versity’s $1.2-billion endowment, which exists in case of finan-cial emergencies.
“Unfortunately , we’re in a financial emergency ,” said SDS member Robbey Hayes, a 20-year-old anthropology junior. “We feel like this is the time for the administration to tap into that endowment.” 
The proposal also said the university can adopt a “chop 
from the top” attitude, banning bonuses for administrators until the budget is balanced and tuition hikes are stopped.
ISDS said if students must tighten their financial belts, the 
university must also refrain from wasteful spending. 
The proposal specifically cited the $35,000 UF spent on stat-
ues displayed on campus from June to October. Student activists give budget suggestions to administration

A new study might cause future law stu-
dents to rethink what weekend party photos 
they post online for the whole world to see. 
Kaplan Test Prep recently released a survey 
that showed 41 percent of law school admis-sions officers check on students’ digital lives. 
The survey , conducted this summer by 
phone, included data from law school, college and business school admissions officers. 
It included responses from 128 of the na-
tion’s 200 American-Bar-Association-accred-ited law schools, according to Kaplan’s news release.The data showed 41 percent of law school 
admissions officers have Googled an applicant, and 37 percent have checked an applicant on Facebook or another social networking site. 
“It tends to correlate with the legal profes-
sion itself,” said Jeff Thomas, the Kaplan Test Prep director of pre-law programs. He said the legal profession takes ethics seriously . 
More undergraduate students from UF ap-
ply to law school than any other school in the country , Thomas said. 
In the 2009-2010 school year, 1,183 UF un-
dergrads applied to law school, according to the Law School Admission Council, the orga-nization that administers the LSAT. 
However, the UF Levin College of Law is not in the 41 percent that checks applicants’ digital lives. 
“We only review what is presented by the 
applicant in the application file,” said Noemar Castro, director of admissions for the Levin College of Law. 
Not only do law schools most frequently 
check on applicants, but they also discover the most damaging content to applicants. 
Of the law school admissions offices that search for applicants online, 32 percent found something that hurt students’ application.
UF social media specialist Bruce Floyd said 
law schools might look at a student’s character through his or her online presence.
“Students need to be aware they are creat-
ing sociable history,” Floyd said.
Finance senior Jerry Goldsmith, 21, is 
waiting to hear back from law schools about whether he has been accepted. He said law schools have every right to look up prospec-tive students online.
“I think it is within a law school’s means to 
Google applicants because many prospective law school students want to be considered for more than their GPA and test scores,” he said.

Today’s question:  Do you consider yourself sexually 
healthy and safe?
Monday’s question: Do you think all 
troops will actually be withdrawn from Iraq by the end of the year? 
60 TOTAL VOTES32% YES
68% NOOccupy protesters teach a lesson in values
These days, being a journalist can be hard. 
Journalists are in a state of denial that our field is 
perfectly fine and in no particular danger. Try bal-
ancing that with the Venn diagram of “too much to report on” and “topics people will care about enough to read.”
I’m not asking for your pity or your understanding. I 
just think that journalists can be, simultaneously, both the most and least caring people in the world.
I’m sure by now you’ve at least heard about the Oc-
cupy Wall Street movement, right?
What started as a gathering of protesters in Manhattan 
has become a global quasi-uprising. People have finally become fed up with the fact that the richest 1 percent of the world makes the decisions for the rest of us.
It doesn’t matter whether you agree with their posi-
tion. It’s okay to disagree in this country; that’s kind of the point of the First Amendment to our Constitution.
It took days for the mainstream media to even begin 
mentioning the protests. Major networks decided not to talk about it right away.
When reporters and commentators finally started 
talking about it, some of them did so with an incredible bias toward the movement in general. A right-wing opin-ion columnist for Fox News called the protests a “liberal whinefest.” 
But bias is not the point.The point should instead be focusing on the wholly 
grassroots, homemade, global movement that OWS rep-resents. According to the OWS unofficial website, occupy-wallst.org, the protest has reached about 1,500 cities across the world. I don’t believe it can be written off as a group of liberal whiners at this point. 
Grassroots movements are sometimes the only way 
stuff gets done. There seems to be a small disconnect be-tween what the people want and what our representatives view as important. OWS may be criticized for not protest-ing a specific policy, but perhaps the movement is against the values that are highly re-garded in today’s society.
Interested in getting involved 
locally? Go down to Bo Diddley Community Plaza and join the local faction of OWS supporters in the Occupy Gainesville move-ment. To my knowledge, there hasn’t been any violence insti-gated by the protesters. If there 
are large groups of people speaking out against some-thing, there are bound to be police.
Would you rather see “#occupymybed” trending on 
Twitter instead? Fine, point taken. Perhaps the movement should be ignored or not touted as much. I get it. We have other stuff to worry about. For instance, how cold it is all of a sudden — am I right?
There are a ton of other grassroots movements for you 
to consider. There’s a UF-based division of the ONE Cam-paign, which is a “grassroots advocacy and campaigning organization that fights extreme poverty and preventable disease, particularly in Africa,” according to one.org. That sounds pretty noble, right? You can join “ONE at Univer-sity of Florida” to stay on top of what events are available to participate in.
This week, the club invites us all to try living on less 
than $1.50 a day.
“Nearly 1 billion people around the world live on $1.50 
a day, and for a week, we are challenging organizations at UF to do the same. Can you join the ONE CAMPAIGN, and live on $1.50 a day?” asks the Facebook event. 
Some of those in the OWS movement are probably al-
ready doing this out of necessity or out of solidarity. 
Citizens and journalists could stand to learn from their 
empathy and example.

This weekend, Bo Diddley Community Plaza in down-town Gainesville was host to the Pride Festival.

riage should be legal. 
The only age group that did not have majority support of le-
gal protections for same-sex marriage were those 55 and older. Still, this group’s support increased by six percentage points from the previous year. 
This year, the military policy banning homosexuals from 
openly serving in the military, referred to as “Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell,” was officially repealed. 
Lately, when opinion polls ask about which issues are most 
important to Americans, policies toward gays and lesbians, family or marriage issues make up only one to two percent of those on the list. 
All of these events are evidence that there is a sweeping 
change occurring among Americans. Issues such as the lack of jobs, the economy and war are foremost in Americans’ minds while social issues just don’t matter. 
These tough times are probably making people realize that 
how other people choose to live their lives really does not affect them. People also seem to be realizing that there is a problem with marriage equality in this country. 
These trends can even be seen in the most unlikely places. Rick Santorum, the most outspoken Republican presiden-
tial candidate against the issue of same-sex marriage and the repeal of “Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell,” is at the bottom of the polls for the 2012 race. 
In every debate, he tries to bring up the issue of family and 
traditional values, but it obviously is not playing well with GOP voters.
In the last debate, when asked how the GOP would appeal 
to Latino voters, most candidates brought up the issue of ille-gal immigration security and reform.
Not Santorum. For Santorum, attracting Latino voters meant appealing to 
their understanding that the foundation of America is not “the individual,” as Congressman Ron Paul suggested. Instead, the building block of our society is “the family” and faith. 
If this were the case, one would assume Santorum’s mes-
sage of traditional family values (code for “not same-sex mar -
riage”) would be playing better with GOP voters. 
Instead, conservatives, like all Americans, want a candidate 
who knows how to fix our economic problems, not tell us how to behave in the bedroom or whom we can marry. 
Let’s hope these winds of change continue to blow us in the 
right direction.

It’s exceedingly important for an 
expectant mother to know if the child she is carrying will inherit 
genetic abnormalities. Raising a child with a serious genetic defect can be emotionally, financially and mentally difficult.
As a woman who intends to be a 
parent someday, I would certainly like to have any and all possible knowledge about my child’s ge-netic future. I would want to en-sure that I could accommodate and provide for them to the best of my ability. And if my abilities were to be found lacking, I would not want to bring a child into the world who I could not support in every way possible.
But a new genetic test that de-tects Down syndrome has raised some eyebrows. This procedure is less invasive than traditional am-niocentesis or chorionic villus sam-pling (both of which carry a small risk of miscarriage), by simply tak-ing blood from the mother rather than cells directly from the fetus. It is a far easier procedure and, from the looks of it, a highly accurate one as well, identifying 98.6 percent of the Down syndrome cases in pre-liminary testing.
Down syndrome, in its most 
common form, is caused by a mu-tation of chromosomes 21 and 22, causing three copies of chromo-some 21 to be formed rather than the normal two copies. This change in chromosomal makeup can lead to limita-tions in mental and social de-velopment 
as well as a host of other medical is-sues, including heart problems, eye problems and compression injury of the spinal cord, to name a few.
While a great deal of those diag-
nosed with Down syndrome go on to live independent, fulfilling lives, it cannot be said that their child-hood or adult life is without com-plications.
With a new, less-invasive test 
soon to be available to pregnant women, there is a concern among some groups that this sort of early genetic testing could “encourage more people to end their pregnan-cies.”
This is possible. Women who 
discover they are carrying a child with Down syndrome could choose to terminate the pregnancy. Wheth-er or not that is an ethical decision is another column in and of itself.
But it is also possible that wom-
en who discover they are carrying a Down syndrome child could use this information to get the proper prenatal care, work on providing care and support for the child’s early years and learn more about the syndrome.
The more knowledge you have 
about how to provide for a child, the better off that child will be. Similarly, the more you know, the more you can assess if you person-ally are capable of providing the care a child with a disorder like Down syndrome will need.
I fully believe in the ability of a 
woman to assess her own circum-stances, personality and life and  to responsibly determine what to do with the information gained from a genetic test such as this.
I don’t see this new test as being 
something to fear when it comes to women terminating their pregnan-cies. I see it as something that will allow women to make the most informed decision possible about their pregnancies.

The eurozone crisis has played out like 
a slow-moving Greek tragedy. The Eu-ropean political elites who created the 
euro in the 1990s were warned of problems inherent in their plans, but they ignored these warnings. Once the problems came to a head, European politicians dealt with each new problem in a haphazard way that temporar -
ily postponed the worst but was not enough to end the overall crisis. Unless this approach changes, the outcome could be disastrous for the world. The United States should intervene in hopes of precluding this dire possibility.
The current crisis is largely the result of two 
predictable flaws of the eurozone: one finan-cial, the other relating to exchange rates.
The latter problem is rather straightfor -
ward. Prices and wages in peripheral coun-tries like Greece and Spain are high relative to prices and wages in core countries like Germany . As a result, countries like Germany are running large trade surpluses compared to countries like Greece, which is part of the reason that the economic downturn has been far more severe in countries like Spain than countries like Germany.
If Spain and Greece had different curren-
cies than Germany and their exchange rates were flexible, there would be no problem. Spain and Greece’s currencies would fall in value relative to the German currency. This would then increase demand for Spanish and Greek goods, thereby increasing employment in Spain and Greece. However, the existence of the single currency precludes the possibility of devaluation. Peripheral countries like Spain and Greece will probably suffer several more years of deflation and high unemployment.
The eurozone’s financial problem is more 
complicated. When you deposit a dollar at the bank, the bank promises to give you that dol-lar on demand, but the bank does not actually keep that dollar in its safe. Instead, the bank only keeps a few cents on hand and lends the rest out. Your deposit at your bank is nothing more than an IOU.
The reason that you consider a bank de-
posit to be worth as much as the money in your wallet is because the federal government guarantees your deposit. Since the federal government controls the supply of dollars, there is no question about its ability to guarantee bank de-
posits. In countries that use the euro this is not the case. The Irish government guarantees Irish bank deposits, but it does not have con-trol over its own currency. Today, many Irish depositors reasonably wonder whether the Irish government will be able to repay its own debts. If it cannot do so, it will not be able to repay Irish banks’ debts either.
As a result, banks in countries like Ireland 
and Greece have been experiencing a slow-mo-tion bank run. These countries’ citizens have realized that a bank deposit that is guaranteed by the Greek or Irish government simply is not worth as much as a bank deposit that is guaranteed by the German government. Thus, Greek and Irish citizens have been withdraw-ing their domestic money and depositing it in other European countries instead.
Given that Greece is insolvent and several 
other countries will need the backing of their stronger peers in order to avoid contagion, the solution is clear: Greece will have to default in an orderly fashion, and countries like Germa-ny are going to have to put up a lot more mon-ey in order to guarantee the debts of countries like Spain and Italy.
If this doesn’t happen, and financial mar -
kets lose confidence in the creditworthiness of a government like Italy’s, the ensuing financial crisis would wreak havoc not only in Europe but also probably here in the United States. Perhaps, in a gesture of support, the U.S. fed-eral government should offer to put up some of the money necessary to guarantee European sovereign debt, with the intention of helping convince the German government to finally offer the monetary amount truly needed to prevent the crisis from spreading.
Would it be unfair for American taxpay-
ers to partly be on the hook for a crisis almost entirely of the European political elite’s mak-ing? Yes, but the alternative is quite possibly far worse.

mouth at Dartmouth College.

That wasn’t Brantley’s fault. He never pro-
claimed himself the King of the South, never 
asked to wear the crown. At media day before last season, he said he was, “Just a regular guy from Ocala.” That’s right, Ocala.
Still, expectations were cranked up by open-
ing day. Brantley wasn’t supposed to just per -
form; he was supposed to change the way Flori-da played football. Last season was a case study in preseason hype gone haywire.
More than anything, the university’s pro-
paganda machine is to blame. Practices were closed. Nobody saw what the quarterback could actually do. Instead, we heard about Brantley from his teammates and coaches.   
What were they going to say? Of course they 
hyped him. Of course they said his passes were perfect, his approach cerebral. And of course ev-eryone ate it up in August. Newspapers needed to fill space. Radio stations needed to fill time.
Crown him.Fast forward to last spring. Fans said Brant-
ley was terrible, said that kid Driskel was going to unseat him with a big arm and some quick feet. Then, the hype machine started cranking. Again.
This was different. This was a pro-style of-
fense. Brantley was a perfect fit. He is smart, ac-curate, comfortable. Now, us outsiders were go-ing to see the real John Brantley, a gunslinger.
Crown him.He went 4 of 14 in the spring game, and ev-
eryone scratched their heads. How could this be? Of course, that was the offensive line’s fault — too many were injured. And that was a legiti-mate excuse; Brantley was chased all afternoon. 
Then came fall camp. Brantley was in control, 
and he was playing toward redemption.
Crown him.Now, Florida is preparing for its eighth game 
of the season. Now, Brantley will save them.
And, of course, that is partially true. The 
Gators need a veteran quarterback; anyone who watched the last three games knows that. 
But don’t force Brantley to carry that cross. 
Before the Alabama game, nobody knew how he would handle a legitimate SEC defense. Then, he passed for 190 yards in one half. Apparently , those 30 minutes proved enough. 
Crown him, I guess.     TUESDAY, OCTOBER 25, 2011 § ALLIGATOR, 13

Florida junior Lauren Embree lost Monday’s singles final, but will still 
play in next week’s USTA/ITA National Indoor Championships.
Despite loss, Embree to play in ITA nationals
The Georgia senior and tournament’s No. 4 seed 
also used both corners of the court to her advantage, 
knocking Embree out of contention by immediately putting her on defense.
Although Embree came close to forcing Gullickson 
to three sets multiple times, Thornqvist said Florida’s limited match experience so far this season eventually led to Embree’s downfall.
“I don’t think she was confident like she has been 
in the past, but she did play a lot of matches and that really will help her,” Thornqvist said. “Going into to-day I don’t know if I saw that mental strength really from the beginning that we’re used to from her. I think perhaps she was anticipating a tough match before she even stepped out there.”
While Embree didn’t qualify for the USTA/ITA 
National Indoor Championships as the Southeast’s re-gional champion, she will be on her way to Flushing, N.Y., next week regardless.
Embree’s No. 5 ranking and her trip to this week-
end’s quarterfinals guaranteed her an at-large bid to the championship’s singles draw. Her play earlier this season with partner Joanna Mather also qualified her into the doubles bracket.
“We should be encouraged because this weekend 
will help her, no question in mind,” Thornqvist said. “It will give us some tougher skin, and we lost to a great player [Monday], so there’s really not a whole lot to hang our heads (about).”TenniS , from page 14TyLer , from page 14 Brown’s knee not responding to treatment
Ronald Powell returned to practice last 
Thursday, Muschamp said.
Whether Powell returns to the 
Gators’ starting lineup remains to be seen. For much of the season, Pow-ell’s lack of production at his position — considered a key role in Muschamp and defensive coordinator Dan Quinn’s scheme — has been disconcerting to coaches. 
Powell is tied for 14th on the team 
with 14 total tackles, including two sacks, while registering just three quar -
terback hurries in six games this sea-son.  
Senior William Green started in 
Powell’s place against Auburn, and Muschamp said Monday that whoever 
practices the best this week will start against Georgia.
Injuries: Mus-
champ said cornerback Jeremy Brown is the only player who will definitely miss Saturday’s game. Brown has been sidelined all season after suffering a sprained knee during training camp.
“He just continues not to respond to 
treatment,” Muschamp said. “We have to continue to press through with that and we’re disappointed for him.”
Muschamp expects everyone else on 
the roster to be available this weekend, including guard Dan Wenger, wide receiver Andre Debose, running back Mike Gillislee and kicker Caleb Sturgis, who were all injured during Florida’s loss to Auburn.

  Florida’s offense could get a 
much-needed boost Saturday against 
Georgia.

Brantley, who has been sidelined since Oct. 1 with a right ankle injury, is probable for this weekend’s game in Jacksonville, coach Will Muschamp said Monday.
  “We feel like John will be ready 
to go for the game,” Muschamp said. “As we progress through the week we will know more about his status.”
  Muschamp has been pleased with 
Brantley’s rehab so far and said the quarterback would return to practice in a limited role Monday for the ﬁ  rst time since suffering the injury late in the ﬁ  rst half against Alabama.
  Although Muschamp remains op-
timistic that Brantley will play this weekend, freshmen Jacoby Brissett and Jeff Driskel will still take reps with the ﬁ  rst team in practice.
  While Brantley did not prac-
tice last week, Muschamp said the quarterback threw the ball and also worked on dropbacks to test the an-kle’s health and see how it would re-spond to stress.
  Prior to the injury, Brantley was 
playing the best football of his career. He completed 66 of 102 passes for 942 yards and ﬁ  ve touchdowns, and he was fourth in the Southeastern Conference in both passing yards per game (188.4) and passing efﬁ  ciency (152.6). 
  But since Brantley has been out, the 
Gators’ offense has sputtered. Florida has found the end zone just once in the last 10 quarters while running a simpliﬁ  ed version of the offense and dropping three straight games.
  Brissett and Driskel have com-
bined to go just 24-of-48 passing for 228 yards, three interceptions and one touchdown since Brantley’s in-jury.
  “Certainly, getting him back is go-
ing to be a huge psychological shock for our football team — I really be-lieve that,” Muschamp said. “There is no question that he certainly gives us a psychological boost for our football team, on offense and defense, too, because that affects how the defense plays at times.”

Auburn game with an undisclosed in-jury suffered against LSU, linebacker  Brantley probable to return against Georgia on Saturday
    John Brantley must feel comfortable wearing that 
crown by now.
  On Saturday, when Brantley is expected to 
make his triumphant return against Georgia, he will be greeted to cheers ﬁ  t for a king. Here he is, Gator Nation: your quarterback, your leader, your savior. 
  But he shouldn’t carry that burden. Expectations 
shouldn’t be this high. He has played one half against a good team this season, yet fans and pundits con-sider him one of the best players in the Southeastern Conference.
  Crown him.  Brantley will shoulder that responsibility come 
Saturday, because he always has, because he has never had another choice. From the day he signed with Florida in 2007, Brantley has been the Gators’ future.
  Never mind that some 
elite recruits simply don’t pan out. Brantley was going to ﬁ  ll Tim Tebow’s shoes perfectly . Before Tebow even left, before Brantley even took a meaningful snap, Florida’s backup was 
one of the top-ﬁ  ve passers in the SEC, according to the “experts.”
  Crown him.  Then, he actually started playing games. Fans 
wanted to bury him. He was no Tebow, no Rex Grossman or Danny Wuerffel or Chris Leak. He was just … just … average. Brantley to face familiar, undue

  Junior Lauren Embree may 
have squared off against a famil-
iar face Monday at the USTA/ITA Southeast Regional Champion-ships, but her ﬁ  nish in the tourna-ment’s singles ﬁ  nals wasn’t quite as typical.
  Top-seeded Embree was 
crowned runner-up at the Ring Tennis Complex after dropping a straight-set match 2-6, 5-7 to Georgia’s Chelsey Gullickson.
  In the past, the Gators have 
targeted Gullickson, the 2010 NCAA singles champion, by forc-ing her out of her comfort zone, especially with over-the-shoulder balls. But her composed play against Embree showed that Gul-lickson is now aware of Florida’s strategy.
  “We’ve played (Gullickson) 
before many times and we’ve al-ways been able to get her out of 
her ball toler-ance by mak-ing her hit enough balls to where she wears down, but I thought she was very sharp,” UF coach Roland 
Thornqvist said. “She handled balls over her shoulder better over the long haul this weekend than I think I’ve seen from her ever.” Embree falls in straight

   Florida had a talented forward receiving 
too few minutes and lacked depth on defense.
  Coach Becky Burleigh solved both prob-
lems with one decision: move freshman Tessa 
Andujar to outside back.
  Prior to No. 13 Florida’s game against Ar-
kansas last Thursday , the ﬁ  rst-year player had only logged 432 minutes at both midﬁ  eld and forward in the season’s ﬁ  rst 15 games.
  Conversely , UF’s starting outside backs, 
Maggie Rodgers and Jazmyne Avant, have rarely left the ﬁ  eld since Southeastern Confer-ence play began.  Avant has played at least 90 minutes ﬁ  ve times, and Rodgers was on the pitch for the entirety of three games.
  UF’s outside backs are asked to make 
runs deep into the attacking third but are also asked to get back on defense when possession changes. They run 6 to 8 miles per game.  “Having some extra depth in that position 
is certainly a plus for us,” Burleigh said.
  To increase her options along the back line, 
Burleigh switched Andujar to outside back, where she started in place of Rodgers the last 
two games.   Andujar’s ball-attacking skills made her a good candidate to make the transition.
  “Even when she plays offense, she’s tena-
ciously after the ball all the time,” Burleigh said.
  Rodgers made a similar transition from of-
fense to outside back in the offseason, but An-dujar’s switch has given Burleigh the option of also playing Rodgers at less taxing positions such as midﬁ  eld, where she saw time on Sun-day in addition to playing outside back.
  “Maggie is a pretty versatile player,” Bur-
leigh said. 
  The defense responded well, allowing just 
four shots on goal during the last two games.  Andujar’s move to outside back gives Gators more options

� THE JUNIOR FORWARD AVERAGED 5.6 
REBOUNDS AND 1.3 BLOCKS PER GAME LAST YEAR.

Sometimes, Jennifer George needs a slap to the 
face.
Florida wants to get the most out of the 6-foot 
forward this season and will do whatever is nec-
essary to reach that point.
“To get her balling with double-doubles, she’s 
got to get mad,” sophomore guard Jaterra Bonds said. “We’re going to try to get her mad before every game.”
While slapping George was a tactic employed 
once last season, Bonds said the team is looking for a less painful way to get George’s blood boil-ing.
The Gators’ recent results in Southeastern Con-
ference play are one potential motivating factor.
The team-oriented George said her top priority 
is to win a conference championship. That being the case, she has reasonable cause to be upset.
During her first two seasons in Gainesville, 
Florida has racked up a 14-18 conference record, finishing last in the SEC East in back-to-back sea-sons.
SEC futility has provided George with the 
necessary anger, as coach Amanda Butler has noticed an increased intensity from George this offseason.
Senior guard Jordan Jones also recognized 
George’s drive, noting the junior forward’s mat-uration and her willingness to take on more re-sponsibility.
“She can’t sit back and be a role player this 
year,” Jones said. “(Becoming) a double-double player is what we expect out of her.”
George played in every game during the 2010-
11 season, starting six contests and ranking sec-ond on the team with 5.6 rebounds and 1.3 blocks per game.Both marks trailed only one player: senior cen-
ter Azania Stewart, who grabbed 6.1 boards and swatted 1.8 shots per game.
“[George] just wants to be a changing factor, a 
dominant force,” Stewart said. “ She has that po-tential, because she’s the strongest on our team.”
Stewart marvels at George’s ability in the 
weight room, calling her work with 65-pound dumb bells “crazy.”
According to Jones, strength and conditioning 
coordinator Rich Jacobs has referred to George as Florida’s strongest player.
However, Stewart admits that physical might 
is only half the battle, saying George needs to mentally grasp her role to become “unstoppa-ble.”
“The biggest jump for her last year to this year 
was just owning how talented she is,” Butler said. “Her teammates have always wanted her to be important, but she’s kind of shied away from that spotlight.”
The Gators have a guard-heavy roster that fits 
the mold of their up-tem -
po style, 
but Butler preaches the importance of a balanced attack.
To achieve that balance, the spotlight shifts to 
the paint, where Florida expects George to play mad this season.
“She could be our best post player,” Jones 
said. “With how dominating she is, how athletic she is — rebounding, scoring — she has the com-plete package.”
Much like the Gators’ SEC title hopes, describ-
ing George realizing her full potential involves words like “could” and “should.”
Florida hopes both prospects are on their way 
to “is.”
“It certainly has been something gradual and 
it’s continuing to happen — I don’t think she’s completely all the way there,” Butler said. “There are more days than not where she’s sure of her -
self and what she needs to do.”Gators looking to channel George’s 
aggression in the post this season

Florida’s volleyball team is 
nearing the end of its most domi-
nant month in years.
Since losing in five sets to Ten-
nessee on Sept. 25, Florida has been the hottest team in the country, winning eight consecutive games in straight sets against Southeast-ern Conference competition.
“We can put a lot of credit to 
the high-octane offense that we’re playing,” UF coach Mary Wise said. “We have the rhythm be-tween the setters and the hitters.”
The No. 13 Gators’ current 
run of sweeps is their best since 2009, and another straight-set vic-tory would make it their lengthiest since 2007. 
During the stretch, Florida’s 
offense has gotten even better at the areas in which it was already excelling and rounded out some other aspects that needed work.
“One of the great indicators in 
our sport is what is the hitting per -
centage that a team can accumu-late,” Wise said. “Right now, ours is pretty good.”
Florida is hitting .353 during 
the winning streak, improving its conference-leading season hitting clip to .314. Tennessee is second in the SEC with a .258 mark. As of Oct. 16, Florida was second in the nation in hitting efficiency.
Three of the SEC’s top 10 hitting 
percentages belong to UF players. Junior middle blocker Betsy Smith would lead the league with a .426 clip if she averaged three attacks per set instead of 2.82.The Gators’ biggest concern 
heading into October was transi-tioning offense from the backcourt to the frontcourt.
Young back-row players like 
Taylor Unroe and Madison Mon-serez struggled at times early in the season to make digs that led smoothly into quality sets and kills.
“That’s where we’ve really 
improved from the last time we played Kentucky and Tennessee,“ Wise said. “We’ve been a much better serve-reception team, so 
teams haven’t been able to get on a roll.”
Passing of-
ten gets over -
looked because hitters are judged solely on attack num-
bers, while 
people turn to dig totals to discuss defensive specialists. However, the Gators’ offense has been much more fluent since their last loss.
Another positive is serving. 
Florida is a high-risk serving team, featuring a number of jump-serv-ers who sacrifice a higher level of errors to be the SEC’s runaway leader in service aces. The Gators have six more service aces than any other team in their conference despite playing at least 10 fewer sets than the other squads.
“When that is working for us, 
it allows us to make good runs on points,” Wise said. “Quality serv-ing helps with quality blocking and that leads to what we talked about in terms of transition defense.”UF offense dominant
