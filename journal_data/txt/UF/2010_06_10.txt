State Attorney Bill Cervone has 
postponed prosecuting Kofi Adu-
Brempong, the 35-year-old Ghanaian graduate student who was shot in the face by UF police March 2.
As a result of this decision, Adu-
Brempong will not be punished for his charges of aggravated assault and re-sisting arrest with violence as long as he continues to undergo counseling, Cervone said in an interview Wednes-day.
Adu-Brempong’s case will likely 
not be officially closed for another 
three years, he said, though the time 
could be shortened or lengthened de-pending on whether Cervone is con-vinced Adu-Brempong’s progress is satisfactory for dismissal.
Cervone said many factors influ-
enced his decision.
“Everything in it from the facts ... 
to his particular circumstances ... to what’s best for him and best for the community,” he said. “We will be monitoring his compliance. I assume he’ll successfully comply.”
Peg O’Connor, an attorney with 
Turner and Hodge, L.L.P., the firm handling Adu-Brempong’s case, said she considered the case closed.
“We think this is a good resolu-
tion,” O’Connor said. “We’re pleased with the state attorney’s decision.”
The firm arranged for Adu-Brem-
pong to receive counseling from an off-campus source in Gainesville, 
O’Connor said, where he will be treat-
ed for post traumatic stress, among other things.Adu-Brempong was known to suf-
fer from delusions prior to the shoot-ing. Officers visited his on-campus apartment on March 1, after a pro-fessor in Adu-Brempong’s depart-ment alerted police his colleague sent e-mails out to students stating he be-lieved someone was out to hurt him, according to a police report of the in-cident.
That day, the officers decided Adu-
Brempong was not a danger to himself or others, though they returned the next night when a neighbor reported screams from his room.
According to UPD reports, Adu-
Brempong approached the officers with a pipe when they entered his apartment, and shooting him was a 
defensive measure. 
Cervone found the officers not 
guilty of misconduct in the incident.
Prosecution deferred for grad student
LOCAL

About 40 Alachua County public school students 
convened at the the Kirby Smith Center on Tuesday 
to protest the new countywide school dress code policy.  
For almost an hour, the protesters lined Univer-
sity Avenue and chanted slogans such as, “We won’t conform; no uniforms!”
One sign, citing Billy Joel’s song “It’s Still Rock 
and Roll to Me,” read, “What’s the matter with the clothes I’m wearing?” Another read, “You can’t leg-islate what you can’t provide.” 
Though a majority of the protesters were high-
school students, 11-year-old Amber Gillette repre-sented Williams Elementary with a sign that said, “I’m getting punished for the rules I don’t break.”
Eileen Roy, one of the two school board members 
who voted against the policy, attended the protest. 
“To be fair, the people who voted for this policy 
felt that doing so would enhance academic perfor-mance,” she said. “I have not seen evidence that 
links wearing uniforms with increase in academic 
performance.” 40 students 
protest new uniform rule
SEE PROTEST, PA gE 4• March 2: Kofi Adu-Brempong, 35-year-old graduate student, is shot 
and arrested by UPD on five charges of third-degree resisting arrest with

Shands at UF where he is kept in critical condition.
• March 5: Adu-Brempong’s charges are changed to one count of 
second-degree aggravated assault and one count of third-degree resisting 
arrest with violence.
• March 16: UF students hold a protest demanding, among other

Fla. posting 1st signs warning swimmers about oil 
PENSACOLA BEACH (AP) — Beachgoers in Florida’s west-
ern Panhandle saw the first warning signs Tuesday telling them 
not to swim or fish off of a six-mile stretch of the oil-fouled Gulf of Mexico near the Alabama and Florida state line.
The Escambia County Health Department posted the signs 
after a tar substance was reported off Perdido Key. The warnings stretch from Perdido Key to the Gulf Islands Seashore national park. 
It is the first time swimming and fishing has been restricted 
on any Florida beaches because of the massive spill that began with the April 20.News Today

PENSACOLA — Some ad-
vocates are calling for Florida legislators to allow tax apprais-
ers to lower Gulf Coast property 
values immediately because of the BP oil spill.
Appraisers from three Pan-
handle counties and a state rep-resentative say the state should then push BP PLC to compensate the counties for lost revenue. 
They say that otherwise the 
tax burden would shift to inland property owners.
State Rep. Dave Murzin and 
the appraisers from Escambia, 
Santa Rosa and Okaloosa coun-
ties say the Legislature should call a special session soon to deal with the crisis.
The spill began April 20 when 
a BP drilling rig off Louisiana exploded. 
Tar balls and other oil prod-
ucts from the spill began wash-
ing up on Panhandle beaches 
last weekend.

Walmart workers accused 
of stealing hydrocodone
MARIANNA (AP) — Two 
employees at a north Florida 
Walmart pharmacy have been 
charged with trafficking a con-
trolled substance after allegedly stealing thousands of hydro-codone pills.
The Jackson County Sheriff’s 
Office says pharmacist Tresha Davis and Priscilla Ann Noble, a pharmacy technician, stole several hundred pain pills each 
week and then sold them to oth-
ers.
Davis allegedly made $200 
for each sale and Noble $100.
Investigators say more arrests 
are expected.
A Walmart spokeswoman 
says the company is working with authorities.
Jackson County Sheriff Lou 
Roberts commended the chain for cooperating with the inves-tigation.
Both Davis and Noble have 
been released after posting $30,000 bond each.

Crist pushes for July ses-

MIAMI — Gov. Charlie 
Crist may call a special session 
in July for lawmakers to dis-
cuss a constitutional amend-
ment that would ban offshore drilling.
Crist toured a new com-
mand post in downtown Mi-ami on Wednesday where Coast Guard, state and federal officials and BP representatives will strategize over how to 
protect Florida’s beaches if the 
oil hits South Florida. While there’s no imminent threat, Crist said estimates change daily. He said it will be cru-cial to have the most accurate 
information about how much 
oil has been leaking since the Deepwater Horizon explosion and to monitor the loop cur-
rent, which could whip the oil 
around Florida’s east coast.
Crist is pushing for a spe-
cial session sooner, but says he’s met with resistance in the 
House.

TALLAHASSEE — A panel of govern-
ment officials and private citizens Wednes-
day discussed the idea of getting a big upfront payment from BP and the state taking over claims payments to businesses 
and individuals who have suffered losses 
from the company’s oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico.
The Gulf Oil Spill Economic Recovery 
Task Force created by Gov. Charlie Crist, though, took no action on the proposal by Tallahassee lawyer Steve Uhlfelder.
“We should look at a way to draw 
down a lot of money from BP now — 500 million, a billion — and let the state take over this process,” Uhlfelder said. “I really believe this company’s in serious economic 
trouble.”
Uhlfelder said Florida also should get 
enough to cover state and local tax losses 
expected due to declining tourism and property values while BP still has the re-sources to cover them.
Several other members agreed, includ-
ing state Sen. Durell Peaden, R-Crestview, and Rep. Michael Horner, R-Kissimmee.
“This $25 million at a time in little drips 
and drabs I don’t think is cutting it,” Horner said. “Put a few more zeros on there. We should be talking billions.”
“I think we need to get what we can 
while we can,” said Nelson Mongiovi, di-rector of marketing and development for the Department of Agriculture and Con-sumer Services.
Charter boat captain Robert F. Zales II, 
of Panama City, also liked the idea.
“The people in this state know more 
how to take care of their people than some-body from Houston, Texas, or Great Brit-ain,” Zales said.
The only opposition came from Attor-
ney General Bill McCollum’s deputy chief of staff, Bill Stewart. He said a state or fed-
eral takeover of the claims could mean tax-
payers would pick up expenses now being paid by BP.
Crist’s budget director, Jerry McDaniel, 
said state economists are trying to come up with figures on lost tax revenues.Panel seeks BP payment� THE POSTERS WERE MADE AS

Students who hate their jobs should 
visit the Harn this summer.
A selection of work incentive posters 
from the 1920s went on exhibit Tues-
day at the Harn Museum of Art on UF’s campus. “America at Work: Art and 
Propaganda in the Early 20th Century” 
features 30 vintage posters with catchy slogans that encourage people to be productive and happy in their work.
The posters, which are decorated in 
prototypical 1920s graphics and feature slogans like, “Be a Tight Wad! Own Something!” and “Long Winded Talk-ers Waste Time,” were designed to en-
courage morale, teamwork and pride in 
the workplace, said Dulce Román, the modern art curator at the Harn.
“Since the posters are related to the 
theme of work, we hope people will 
be interested because of the economic 
downturn,” Román said. “The posters sort of represent American values. I wanted to show that.”
The posters are owned by Ronald 
DeFilippo, who owns The Swamp Res-taurant on University Avenue. DeFil-ippo, who is loaning the posters to the museum through Sept. 15, bought them more than 25 years ago at an antique 
shop in New York.
“I had them authenticated and re-
stored because they were colorful,” De-
Filippo said. “I like them because they 
were the beginning stages of advertis-
ing, and as a restaura-
teur I like having them cover the walls.”
Although they may 
have been commercial-
ly successful in the early 20th century, in today’s market the posters are worth quite a bit more than the lithograph 
paper they are printed on, DeFilippo 
said. 
The posters were produced by 
Mather & Company from 1923 until 1929, when the stock market collapsed 
and put the company out of business, 
Román said.Labor posters displayed

The Flour Pot Bakery is battling 
hunger one cookie at a time.
The bakery, located in the Tio-
ga Town Center in Gainesville, 
launched its three-month Summer 
of Edible Goodness program on 
Tuesday, in which the owners agree to donate a school meal to a hungry child in a developing nation for ev-ery food item the store sells.
“We’re doing directly one for 
one,” said Melissa Austin, 22, partial owner of the bakery. “How many customers come in is how many 
meals we’re giving.”
After research, the bakery’s 
owners chose to donate the money 
raised from selling baked goods to the United Nations’ Fill the Cup Campaign. 
Bakery employees hand out tick-
ets to customers and keep half of the ticket to track the number of food 
items sold.
“We want to give people a step 
up,” Austin said. “Studies show that 
kids are more willing to go to school if they know they’re going to get a meal.”
In February, Austin assumed 
ownership of the store alongside her fiancé, Bryan Judah, 25, and his 
mother, Sally Judah. Judah’s interest in social entrepreneurship and Aus-
tin’s family background in baking encouraged the family to try run-ning the business, Austin said.
“Being a businessman, [Judah] 
doesn’t want to neglect that need to help too,” she said.
Tuesday also marked the one-
year anniversary of the death of Julian Nobles, Judah’s grandfather, whose favorite pastime was finding fresh produce for friends, family and 
even strangers, she said. Austin said the Edible Goodness pro-
gram was made in honor of him.
“He would actually go door to 
door to pass out local produce to friends,” she said. “We never saw him without a basket of potatoes or something. He just loved making people happy.”
The bakery is open from 7 a.m. to 
7:30 p.m., Monday through Friday, 
and from 7 a.m. to 6 p.m. on Satur-
day.
Items sold at the bakery’s stands 
in any of the farmers markets will also count toward the campaign. The Flour Pot Bakery employees at-tend famers markets downtown on Wednesdays, in Ocala on Fridays, and in both farmers markets held 
in Haile Plantation and Alachua on 
Saturday.4, ALLIGATOR � THURSDAY, JUNE 10, 2010

� THE FAT TUSCAN REPORTS A 50 PERCENT DROP IN 
INCOME SINCE CHANGING ITS HOURS.
By ALEX ORLANDO
Alligator Contributing Writer
After two weeks of adhering to a zoning code diet, the Fat 
Tuscan Café is not as plump as it once was.
Between December and May, the café had been functioning 
in quiet defiance of its zoning code, which prohibited the café 
from operating on Sundays and past 4 p.m. on weekdays. The café had also been hosting live, amplified music in its courtyard, which further violated the code.
After a noise complaint in May, owners of the Fat Tuscan 
were issued a citation that forced staff to comply with the pre-existing zoning code. 
The new code enforcement has resulted in a 50 percent drop 
in income, said Michelle Reeves, partial owner of the café.
Since then, Reeves said, she has canceled the café’s dinner 
menu, laid off two staff members and cut other workers’ hours to one shift a week.
“We have no plan B,” she said.
Karen Orr, who has lived for 30 years at 715 NE Second St., 
one block from the café, said she does not think the restaurant 
should be in her neighborhood at all.
Even if the café abides by the noise ordinance, she said, she 
would still hear the live music, because she lives within 200 feet of the building.
Most of her neighbors who live on the side of the street clos-
est to the café are renting their homes and have not had to live with the noise, she said. 
An agreement is implied between residents and the city that 
the houses that share the block with the Fat Tuscan should act as a buffer for the noise coming from Main Street, she said.
“That contract between the city and its citizens, when they 
approved [the café], was broken,” she said. “There’s no way that this can go on with these teeny tiny lots and not be intrusive.”Cafe’s income falls
Group plans second protest for Tuesday
Alachua County school board candidate Chris 
Smiley said the policy may cause unforeseen con-
sequences.
“Why did we let this happen?” he said. “There’s 
no reason to implement it if it’s going to force an undue financial burden on students and parents.”
Sara Bicknell, one of the protest organizers, said 
the new policy might be financially difficult for her family. 
“I live with a single mom who works on a teach-
er’s salary,” she said. “She’s raising four kids. She doesn’t have enough to get all new wardrobes for 
all of us. It’s just unrealistic.”
In order to have the policy removed, some stu-
dents are prepared to go to even more drastic mea-
sures than just protesting outside the Kirby Smith 
Center. Bicknell said she and her peers are discussing a 
uniform boycott. If enough students participated, 
she said, the faculty would have no way of enforc-ing the policy. 
“You have to keep protesting,” she said. “People 
have to keep boycotting for weeks or else it’s not going to change anything.”
The same group is organizing another protest 
for Tuesday, when the school board will hold a meeting. PROTEST , from page 1ON CAMPUS

UF has more eco-friendly 
buildings than any other Amer-
ican university.
A recently published paper 
about buildings in colleges rec-
ognized UF as having the most certifications by Leadership in 
Energy and Environmental De-
sign.
The LEED certification sys-
tem is operated by the U.S. 
Green Building Council, a 
Washington-based non-profit organization. 
In 2003, UF became the first organization in Florida to re-
ceive a gold LEED rating. In 
2008, UF became the first orga-nization in Florida to receive a platinum rating, which is the 
highest rank.
According to the paper, writ-
ten by green building expert 
Jerry Yudelson, UF is a national trendsetter that is “well-known 
for [its] green building stan-
dards.”
Some of UF’s 15 certified 
buildings include Library West 
and Rinker Hall, with gold cer-
tifications, and Ben Hill Griffin Stadium’s 60,000-square-foot expansion, which earned UF’s only platinum rating.
Harvard University, with 
39 LEED projects, which are LEED buildings that are not yet completed, is second to UF’s 60 
LEED projects in the ranking. 
UF’s policy requires all new 
construction to earn at least a 
gold rating. 
The university’s next step is 
to upgrade existing buildings, said Bahar Armaghani, assis-tant director for the UF LEED program. 
UF has selected 32 buildings 
that need renovation to be up-dated to meet LEED certifica-tion, Armaghani said.UF has most green buildingsAroundGainesville

�NOTIFYING STUDENTS WAS  
THE MAIN CONCERN. 
By ELIZABETH BEHRMAN
Alligator Writer
After proposing four amend-
ments to the same bill, senators 
agreed to disagree during Tuesday’s meeting.
Senators debated for more than 
an hour about the phrasing of an amendment to a bill for how to ap-ply for an absentee ballot for Student Government elections. 
The bill, which passed last week, 
mandated that the supervisor of elections must notify each student about the absentee ballot process in an e-mail. Before it passed, members 
of the Unite Party added an amend-
ment that permits the supervisor of elections to notify students using means other than e-mail, arguing that notifications were already sent to each student via the Gator Times.
Student Alliance party members, 
who authored the original bill, said during this week’s meeting that the 
Gator Times had not mentioned ab-sentee ballots within the past year.
Student Alliance party president 
Keir Lamont said the Unite Party 
may not have been intentionally re-
laying false information, but it was 
still incorrect.
“We can admit that they were at 
least misinformed about the state-ments they made,” Lamont said.
Unite Party 
Sen. Ben Mey-ers said SG staff members 
usually send ballot information to the Gator Times, though the Gator Times does not publish it. Senators did not know this during the last senate meeting, he said.
Members of the Student Alliance 
party responded by drafting anoth-er amendment to the bill Tuesday that would require the supervisor 
of elections to send the information 
about absentee voting to the Gator Times. The Unite Party changed that amendment to say students would receive the information by an un-specified “online notification.” 
Meyers said the notification 
could appear in the Gator Times, an e-mail, on the SG website or on ISIS.“It’s the same thing you’re say-
ing, we’re just being less specific,” Meyers told senators.
Meyers said this wording provid-
ed for the fact that the Gator Times might not always be around, and students who do not read it would still get the information. The super-visor of elections wouldn’t be subject to any negative consequences if the students did not get the information via the Gator Times, Meyers said.
The amendment passed with a 
vote of 54 to 14. Unhappy with this new word choice, senators contin-ued to debate. Last week, Unite Par-ty senators argued that notifications were already sent through the Gator Times, Jonathan Ossip said. This week, he argued that senators did not want to make it a requirement because it was too specific.
“I’m just very confused about 
which side you want to take,” Ossip told senators.
The final amendment, which 
passed with the bill, requires the su-pervisor of elections to send out at least two online notifications to stu-dents before SG elections. It does not specify what means will be used.

of the two Planet Smoothie shops in Gainesville.
Every time a Pink Promise smoothie is bought, 50 cents will 
be donated to the Cure, said Melissa Warren, spokeswoman 
for the smoothie company. Along with the 50 cents, there will be a minimum guarantee of $100,000 donated from all stores nationwide for the first year of the partnership, Warren said. 
Since the campaign kicked off June 1, Logan’s two locations 
have sold six to 10 orders of the smoothie every day, Logan said. 
To promote the campaign, Planet Smoothie has been using 
a text messaging program that sends coupons and discounts to customers’ phones, Logan said. 
If the year-long program is successful, then the two organi-
zations could form a longer-lasting relationship, he said.Smoothies sold to

Today’s question: Have you ever gone on a cross-country road -
trip?
128 TOTAL VOTES55% YES45% NOTuesday’s question: Should bars be held responsible for underage drinkers?Ice, ice, baby
We never thought 
we would see the day when 
the drink of choice on 1:55 a.m. beer runs would be one of the many flavors of Smirnoff Ice, but the malted 
beverage has been flying off 
the shelf due to it being the main ingredient in a new viral drinking game.
The game tasks its par-
ticipants to hide bottles of 
the sugary-sweet beverage 
around the house for others to find. 
Discovering a bottle 
means you have been 
“iced” and must immedi-
ately drink the entire thing on one knee. 
Unfortunately, the 
game has been catching on around Gainesville and it could not have come at a worse time.
 It might be fun to play 
the prank on someone, and the game is funny in its ironic embrace of the not-so-manly Smirnoff Ice, but the last thing UF needs 
is another reason to keep 
cracking down on drink-ing.
UF already gets enough 
grief for being a party school, and this game will do nothing to curtail that stigma. 
In fact, it could be the 
thing that pushes UF into 
the No.1  slot on the list of 
binge-drinking, party-lov-ing universities across the nation. 
Believe it or not, that 
honor would probably hin-der the post-graduation job hunt.
So take a minute and re-
member to drink responsi-bly this summer and keep the icing to a minimum. We just hope someone ices our party animal president, 
Bernie Machen, before the 
fad dies out.Not over yet
Deferred prosecution 
doesn’t end controversy
The State Attorney’s Office announced Wednesday that 
it has entered into an agreement to defer criminal pros-ecution against Kofi Adu-Brempong, the UF graduate 
student who was shot in the face by a UPD officer in March.
Under the agreement, the charges against Adu-Brempong 
would be dropped in three years if he continues to receive counseling for his mental health issues and agrees to take any medications prescribed to him. This is a big step in the right direction, but the case is far from closed.
We hope that Adu-Brempong will finish his doctorate work 
at UF, but we are more concerned about how this event will affect the rest of his time in Gainesville. Will he be allowed to teach again, or is he going to be shoved quickly through the program in the hopes that this controversy will finally die?
We are still waiting to hear UF’s plan to keep things like 
this from happening again. It would be nice if we knew there was some progress on that front, but as of now all the money that would fund mental health programs for students is being diverted to Student Government until further notice.
It might also be nice if we knew what UPD’s new plans for 
handling delicate situations like this will be. It was an explo-sive event that deserves some explosive answers. Instead we are stuck waiting for UF to conclude its own investigation and release its findings to the public. Most of all we are saddened by the impact this ordeal has had on Adu-Brempong and his family, and we hope this agreement gives them some peace.
Roadtrips can be fun, enlightening
We have all seen it on our Facebook news feeds – 
friends and family posting pictures of their worldly travels. For many students, classes and obligations 
have dwindled, and those lucky enough to find funding have taken the opportunity to explore exotic destinations.  
While trips abroad are popular and enticing, they are not al-ways feasible. But that doesn’t mean boredom has to prevail. If you want to travel this summer but can’t make it overseas, consider exploring right here at home. You can see Greek, Roman and Classical European artifacts in a castle by the seaside, visit the ruins of ancient cities, and walk across the London Bridge — all without leaving the American border.
During the summer after my freshman year, I decided to 
see more of the world. The first thing I had to recognize, how-
ever, was the fact that there was so much I didn’t know about 
my own country. A well-seasoned traveler should know his homeland as well as the rest of the world. 
I took a month-long road trip and circled the country. The 
best part about road trips is the ability to edit the trip along the way. I told myself I wouldn’t hesitate if I heard about something along the way that sounded interesting and called for a detour. Of course, having the right company along for the ride is essential to a successful road trip. So, invite people 
you know who are willing to go with the flow. I grabbed my 
two best childhood friends and we set off in early May, with-out knowing much of what such a trip entailed.
Fortunately, if you’re adventurous enough, all of the nec-
essary details fall into place. A word to the wise: Don’t over-look the current price of gas. We traveled when gas was at an all-time high, but an American road trip can be easily afford-able to the average college student at current rates. Oh, and bring a tent. It saves tons of money on hotel costs.
Some of the fondest memories I possess come from un-
planned adventures along the way. After taking a detour from St. Louis to Mount Rushmore in South Dakota (yes, that is a gigantic detour), my trip veered over to California. In a city on the shore called San Simeon, I found a museum with artifacts that rivaled some of the greatest European galleries. The coolest part was that it 
wasn’t originally intended as a museum at all. It was news-paper tycoon William Hearst’s custom-built castle home. His ancient art collection is worth the trip alone, but there’s also his reproduction Greek temple swimming complex and per-
sonal menagerie to entice the interested tourist.
On the way southeast, I heard of a city of ancient ruins 
in New Mexico called Chaco Canyon, an ancient civilization 
with an affinity for the stars. Their ancient buildings were aligned perfectly with celestial bodies, and they possessed the only simultaneous solar and lunar tracking device (a simple, extremely delicate placement of rock slabs and stone carvings) known to be in existence for the time period. You can explore the ruins first-hand, guided or unguided. I was 
even taken for a taste of the American western frontier ex-
perience when I got lost in the New Mexico desert for a few days trying to find the site. As it turns out, a sign with a back-wards arrow can lead you on some of the wildest adventures you can imagine when in the New Mexican wilderness.
Yes, I mentioned the London Bridge as being something 
available to the American tourist as well. Apparently, when the London Bridge was deemed too old and worn to refur-bish in the 1960s, an American businessman bought it and had it shipped to land he owned in Arizona (another rea-son I love America). It was reconstructed over Lake Havasu brick-for-brick, and it remains there to this day. Don’t take 
my word for it, though. Go check it out for yourself.
The point of sharing these is to encourage the bored 
Gainesville citizen or college student to take advantage of the 
great destinations that exist right here in our own country. Life is short and the world is large — take advantage of your free time.

Speaking OutTHURSDAY, JUNE 10, 2010 � ALLIGATOR, 7
Bryan Griffin’s article “Individual action key to conser-
vation” seems to strongly evoke his Republican role 
model, Bobby Jindal, the governor of Louisiana, and 
his limp response to President Obama’s State of the Union 
address. In his piece, he manages to convey such base ideas as “Liberals bad” and “Regulation bad.” OK, so you can’t 
blame him for paraphrasing the GOP manifesto. But beyond 
the standard partisan hackery, Mr. Griffin offers several 
gems that are simply too precious to ignore.
His first example of liberalism run afoul is the result of 
environmentalist group’s lawsuit to protect the spikedace population in the Verder River in Arizona. The pinko com-mie hippies won, but ultimately their intervention put the 
nails in the spikedace coffin. No, I had never heard of this 
either. 
I mean, if you’re nitpicking like this you could very easily 
point out examples of conservative “drill, baby, drill” doc-trine resulting in environmental ruin (e.g., the ongoing rape of the Gulf Coast).
He further claims that Nancy Pelosi, or as the right wing 
prefers to call her, “Satan,” mandated the use of compact fluorescent lamps under the guise of environmentalism, 
when in fact the new bulbs contain enough mercury to harm 
fetuses if broken. In other words, the use of energy-saving bulbs is really just a liberal ploy to increase the number of 
abortions.All kidding aside, CFL bulbs can 
be moderately dangerous when bro-
ken. You need to be careful when 
cleaning a broken CFL, and they 
need to be recycled properly to ensure that mercury doesn’t 
enter landfills. However, the entire argument is dishonest 
since, per hour of light produced, incandescent bulbs release 
three times the amount of mercury into the atmosphere than CFL bulbs do.
If you’ve been keeping score, almost everything in his 
piece so far is B.S. The remainder of the article is B.S. as well, but I’ve got to stop because rereading it is giving me a head-
ache.
On the one hand, I am disturbed to see that a young law 
student of all people has such trouble making a rational ar-gument these days. 
On the other hand, I am relieved to know that the job 
market for lawyers is in the toilet these days.
The real fundamental problem with his arguments, and 
the reason why it will be a long time before we see a real 
conservative  environmental movement, is that the biggest 
threat to nature is a failure of the free market. If there is neg-
ligible cost associated with dumping chemicals in a river, industrial giants will do it. 
There is a liberal desire to correct this imbalance and en-
sure that nature, which has a public value, be preserved to some extent. Conservatives will argue that the left goes too far, pro-
tecting small endangered species and plants that nobody’s every heard of at the expense of human well-being. 
There are arguments worth having. Is it more important 
to feed and house the Third World or protect the ozone from carbon emissions? Is it more important to keep a natural 
habitat preserved or build housing developments? Should 
you buy a seven-seat SUV to drive your friends around even though the majority of the time you just drive by yourself?
These are questions that can’t be answered with a simple 
yes or no. Clearly, liberal guilt shouldn’t stop underdevel-oped parts of the world from getting power. Furthermore, 
people need homes, and who cares about the mountain rat 
anyway? And if you have five kids, you’re going to need a big car, so MPG be damned.
But if you listen to what passes for conservatism these 
days you hear quite a strange song: Tea Partiers complain about immigrants and the recession while the recession hits 
immigrants exponentially harder. Right-wing figureheads 
fight against the tax burden on the elite as the separation between rich and poor grows faster and faster.
There are actual flaws with liberalism as well as with our 
government. It’s just that with the conservative mindset to-day they will never get fixed, and that’s a problem for ev-
eryone.

City commissioner stands by underage 
drinking ordinance.
Tuesday’s editorial asks the question 
about underage drinkers caught in bars: 
“Why doesn’t the city implement a huge 
fine and prohibit them from going into a 
bar again?” The answer is simple: In Flor-ida, only the state legislature can make laws such as these, not local government. 
Local government can only do two things: 
regulate the hours, and regulate whether the bars can admit 18- to 20-year-olds or if they have to be 21 and up.  Only the state can take away a liquor license through an 
administrative proceeding or make harsh-
er punishments for violating state laws.
The city of Gainesville made its local or-
dinance as a compromise, rather than sim-ply deciding to make all the bars 21 and up 
as recommended by many. The ordinance 
merely requires that those bars who go over the threshold of a certain number of underage drinking offenses would have to 
become 21 and up after 9 p.m.  Our goal was to reduce the load of the Gainesville 
Police Department, who were finding that 
a handful of bars were very lax in their 
duties in keeping a liquor license. Most bars do an excellent job in managing their premises and should not be penalized for those who do not.
We have had great success since this 
ordinance was implemented in April 2009 with a 66 percent decrease in documented underage drinking in Gainesville’s bars. 
In addition, there have been no significant increases in calls for party patrol or code 
enforcement in our single-family neigh-
borhoods near campus.
The tax-paying citizens of the city should 
not be spending a significant portion of 
their tax dollars on policing irresponsible bars; the success of this ordinance allows 
GPD to spend more time keeping the com-
munity safe. I stand by the intent and the results of this ordinance.

This week, Avenue writer Kat Bein has a conversation with a transvestite prostitute named Skittles. Bein said 
the experience was something she’d never forget. “I had no idea what to expect. Most of my friends were 
too scared to come with me. But, really, she was a great person to talk to. She showed me a bruise on her 
cheek from where some guy had pistol-whipped her last week as she was being mugged.” Photo Illustration by Thomas Plevik / Alligator Staff
Audience participation is key to ‘Shear Madness’ plot
By BRITT PERKINS
avenue writer
Mrs. Schubert in the salon with the 
scissors? Don’t put it past “Shear Mad-
ness,” a comedic whodunit that is as en-tertaining and flamboyant as it sounds.
The longest-running non-musical play 
in America, “Shear Madness” is now showing at the Hippodrome State The -
atre downtown with eight performances a week.
The script is meant to be flexible, so 
each show is completely up to date with local gossip and current events. Director Mary Hausch brainstorms with the actors on a daily basis to incorporate the latest news into the shows. A steady stream of jokes poke fun at everything from the 
Gainesville Police Department and Tim 
Tebow to Lady Gaga and British Petro -
leum. 
The plot is as interactive as it is mod-
ern. At “Shear Madness,” the audience is part of the drama and attendees solve the mystery. 
Tony Whitcomb (Cameron Francis), 
owner of the Gainesville Salon where 
the play is set, has the audience laugh-ing from the moment they meet him in 
his pink sneakers, popped-collar polo and rhinestone belt. 
Whitcomb isn’t alone in his banter and 
innuendo. He is joined by fellow hairdress-er and employee, Barbara DeMarco (Jen-nifer Smith), whose taste in fashion is as 
wild as her taste in men. 
The not-so-innocent 
beauticians are plagued 
by the incessant piano 
playing of their upstairs neighbor Isabel Czerny. Until they find out she 
has been murdered and they are the sus-pects. 
Like the beauticians, the clients are 
also suspicious characters. Mrs. Shubert (Sara Morsey), the ridiculously wealthy cougar, and Eddie Lawrence (Kevin-Michael Chu), a sleazy antiques dealer, both have surprising connections to the deceased.
Detective Nick Rossetti (Gregory Jones), 
GPD, controls the scene and questions not only the characters but the audience as 
well. Rossetti uses intermission to gather 
more clues and investigate theories, so don’t be shy if you have some dirt. 
The detectives don’t, however, decide 
who is getting arrested. You do. Though police detain Tony one night, Mrs. Shubert heads to the jail the next. 
The cast delivers the comedy fast and 
doesn’t miss a beat. And if you talk to them, they’ll talk right back. 
Hausch, who has directed more than 
120 productions, traveled to Washing-
ton, D.C. in 2003 to participate in an in-
tensive director’s training. While there, she watched eight performances of the play and learned all of the ins and outs that come with the improvisational wit of “Shear Madness.”
“The audiences observe different 
things,” Hausch said over the phone. “They push the actors in different direc-tions, and that creates a whole new en-vironment that most people don’t have a chance to experience.”
Tickets are available at 352-375-HIPP 
(4477) and thehipp.org. Regular tickets are $25 to $30. Tickets for seniors, teach-ers and those in the military are $20. Stu -
dents with I.D. can get discounted tickets for $12.

Conversation with transvestite prostitute gives insight
By KAT BEIN
alligator writer
The Set-Up
When I told my editor I’d do a feature on 
a tranny prostitute, I sort of meant it as a 
joke. 
I knew where to find them, but I didn’t 
quite know what to do when I got there.  
Well, this was now my mission. I headed down to a corner I knew the “ladies” frequent 
with my friend Jordan.
Real Talk
“What makes you think I’m a working 
girl?”
I was a little stunned. I mean, here I was 
on this most infamous of corners, talking to 
a man dressed in nothing but flip-flops, a bandana skirt and a shirt designed to show off cleavage “she” didn’t have.
“Is it because of what I’m wearing?” she 
asked. “Is it because I’m a man?”
I told her it was the street corner more 
than anything. Surely she was aware of the street’s reputation.
“But I was just standing here talking to my 
friend,” she said. “How do you know I didn’t leave the club early?”
She asked me over and over again. I was 
kind of annoyed. It was obvious what she was here to do, why keep berating me about my sloppy introduction?
Jordan, the sweetheart, started standing 
up for me, making excuses for my rudeness. 
All I could think was, great, I’ve blown it. I 
pissed off the prostitute.“I can tell that you’re upset,” she said to 
me. “You’ve got the water in your eyes. You 
think I’m offended, but I’m not offended. If I 
was offended, I woulda left my voice and said ‘who the fuck you calling a working girl?’”
That last part was all man.“Look, if you’re a cop, just arrest me now,” 
she said. I told her I wasn’t. She told me her name was Skittles.
“What flavor?” Jordan asked.“Whichever you want,” Skittles replied.
A few of Skittles’ coworkers were gather -
ing around, watching us. 
They kept pestering her to leave us alone, but she just told them to shut up,
she was trying to have 
a conversation. Maybe I didn’t blow it yet.
For the next twenty min-
utes or so I was schooled. I was continuously asked why I assumed Skittles was a working girl. It didn’t make a difference whether I had new answers or not, Skittles was making a point. 
We both knew I had made a fair assump-
tion, but the reality was, Skittles wasn’t standing there to be pointed at or gawked over like an exhibit at a museum.
“What do you think about prostitution?” 
Skittles asked us.
Jordan said she didn’t see anything wrong 
with it, that it was a person’s choice what to do with his/her own body. I realized I didn’t 
have an answer. Referring to homeless prostitution, Skit-
tles said, “They do it all the time.” She said people walk up to them and attempt to solicit 
sexual acts in exchange for money, food or a place to stay for the night.
I thought about how different it must be 
to choose to sell yourself and not having that 
choice. How unfair it must be to get locked 
up for such a thing when you only turn to it because it’s your last option.
But that wasn’t Skittles’ story.
“I’m not homeless,” she said defending 
herself from something 
she seemed to look down on. “Believe me, I’m well taken care of.”
“So, then why do you 
do it?” I asked.
Without missing a beat, 
“Because I’m good at it.”
Skittles had to stop 
herself, she was laughing 
so hard. We all laughed.
“I do it because it’s quick, fast, easy mon-
ey,” she said. “You don’t have to deal with a 
manager, people telling you what to do.”
She knew I was a student at UF. She 
told me there weren’t any jobs for people in 
Gainesville unless they went to college and 
learned how to do “something big.”
It was hard to carry a conversation with 
Skittles. I knew she was tipsy. She told me. 
Her coworkers kept mulling about and they were sketchy about cops any time they heard 
footsteps, even though cop cars kept slowly driving by. And then of course there were the 
potential customers.
One car in particular drove by and stopped. 
It was full of college-age boys. As Skittles leaned over to say hey, a voice from the back yelled, “Ew, it’s another dude, gross!” Every -
one started laughing.
Skittles bent down to grab the first thing 
she saw and hurled it at the car before it had a chance to move. 
Her fury was so great, I thought it was a 
brick until it came floating to the ground and I realized it was a Dos Equis label.
Skittles just laughed and said, “I was hop-
ing that was something harder.”
I asked her if she got that sort of thing 
a lot.
“Oh yeah,” she said. “But the ones that 
sit there and say ‘faggot,’ ‘freak,’ ‘dude,’ they’re the first ones to come back when 
their friends aren’t around.”
What it is
The coworkers were getting antsy. We’d 
been standing on that corner for an hour, 
and they weren’t making any money.
Skittles had been kind to us to take time 
out for our conversation. 
I asked her if she’d be willing to speak 
with me some more sometime, maybe some -
where else.
“Honestly,” she said, “no. I don’t have 
anything else to say.”
So we walked away, and that night taught 
me more than a class ever could.“I do it because it’s quick, fast, 
easy money.”

Since Band of Horses came out with its 
first two releases — Everything All the Time and Cease to Begin — they have be -
come an indie/rock staple.
The third Horses release, Infinite Arms, is 
a gallery of the band’s signature sound. Ben Bridwell’s vocals are as guttural as ever, and all 
12 tracks use more landscape than seemingly 
possible. 
Though there are these consistencies in 
Horses’ records, Infinite Arms seems to be a step in a bigger direction, which goes hand in hand with the fact that it is the first of their re -
leases to be put on Columbia, rather than Sub 
Pop Records.
The band uses more grandiose arrange -
ments than on previous records, an aspect that 
die-hard Horses fans may or may not be privy 
to. 
Many songs are built on string and synth ar -
rangements in the background. Along with the 
arrangements, the lyrics in Infinite Arms may create a clear division between fans and skep-tics. 
With lyrics like, “I was thinking it over at the 
snack machine/I thought about you in a candy bar” may come off as either quirky and cute, or base and annoying.
Either way, Infinite Arms is a solid addition 
to the band’s already beloved discography and an encouraging release for the remainder of 2010.full reviews available at alligator.org/the_avenue by JAMES KAUPHOLZ ff the Record

  Suicide, drug addiction, bestiality and 
glory holes. Dark and disturbing realities 
in our society, or a family-friendly pilot epi-sode that is “very funny”? TBS aired its ﬁ  rst original primetime animated series, 
“Neighbors From Hell,” on Monday.   
The basic idea is that Satan sends a 
family from Hell to Earth with a mission 
to stop a giant company from drilling into Hell. To complete said mission, they have to blend in with suburban America. It’s a fairly tired premise (i.e., “Coneheads,” “The Addams Family,” “The Munsters”), but what sets this show apart is the all-
star cast of voices and the dark and edgy 
references.
  The three main characters in the 
show are Balthazor Hellman (Will Sasso), Tina Hellman (Molly Shannon), and  dog Pazuzu (Patton Oswalt). Balthazor is basi-cally Fred Flintsone meets Homer Simp-son meets Peter Grifﬁ  n. Three words: dumb, fat, dad. Tina is bitchy. Her most 
memorable scene involves her awkwardly strangling a woman to near death. Pazu-zu is my favorite main character, mainly 
because I love Patton Oswalt. He alters his voice to what he describes as “every heavy metal-lead singer doing crowd ban-ter between songs.”
  What makes the show unique is its 
outrageous gags. A boss opens a door by sticking his genitalia through a hole in the wall. An owner makes out with his 
dog and makes an uncouth ref-erence. Balthazor forces an em-ployee to binge drink at a strip club. A neighbor addicted to her-oin stumbles into the demons’ 
house and is knocked unconscious. And this is all in the ﬁ  rst episode. My favorite gag in the show would deﬁ  nitely be the suicidal poodle. I would go into further 
detail, but I feel like my description of this 
kind of humor would say more about me than it would about the show.
  My only question is: Who is this show 
for? What household would sit down and watch this together? I’ll keep watching, I just have no idea who else will. TBS show walks the line

Sold in a small pouch clearly labeled  
“not intended for human consumption,” 
Gainesville Green Sense is marketed as an 
herbal air freshener. The finely crumbled blend of dry plant matter smells slightly sweet, similar to a fruity bubblegum.
Different companies market products 
like Spice, K2 and, now, Gainesville Green Sense as incense or potpourri. Unofficially, the products are known to mimic the effects or marijuana when smoked.
I’m sitting in a room full of seasoned pot 
smokers. One of them, Cari*, gingerly emp-ties a packet of the potpourri into the bowl of a water pipe. Lighting the bowl, Cari inhales deeply and blows out a dragon-style stream 
of smoke, accompanied by a cough or two.
“It’s a lot like inhaling tobacco except less 
harsh and it tastes sort of sweet,” Cari said 
post-cough. 
“I was smoking with my friend who told me 
about something new and similar to weed, but legal. I trusted him and I smoked it,” Will, another former pot smoker who made the switch, said.
Gainesville Green Sense is sold in one-
gram packets and fractions of an ounce. The marketing uses unmistakably cliché pot branding – just the name Gainesville Green 
Sense evokes memories of the famous strain 
of local pot that put Gainesville on the map in the 1970s. 
Spice entered the “legal bud” market cir -
ca 2006. Since then, laboratories confirmed 
the presence of JWH-018 in the product – a synthetic cannabinoid that manufacturers spray onto a combination of otherwise in-
nocuous herbs. 
“The biggest difference for me is that I 
know what I’m smoking every time. When 
you buy weed off the street, it could be any 
strength,” Will said.
Smoking the so-called synthetic weed 
may not be without consequence, however. The American Association of Poison Control Centers received more than 100 phone calls 
regarding the products since 2009. 
People with negative reactions re -
port symptoms like anxiety, para-
noia and a racing heart beat.  
“People are just having a reaction similar to that of smoking too much marijuana – i.e. intense paranoia or anxiety,” Will said.  
In addition, synthetic cannabinoids may be stronger than THC, the active component in 
marijuana, and easier to unknowingly ingest 
too much of.
As the smokers continued to pass around 
the water pipe, their eyes reddened, giggles 
ensued and discussion of new taco flavors 
began.
“They should make tacos with Doritos-
flavored shells – meta-tacos,” Cari said.
One of them, Susan, took notes about 
her experience. She noted that she “feels stoned, has the munchies, and loves Fleet-wood Mac.”
Because the introduction of Spice into 
the market, other products have cropped up that use Spice’s marketing scheme to attract customers looking for a legal or easier-to-purchase weed alternative.
“It’s a little bit different than a normal 
high, but I’m not sure how to describe it,” Su -
san said. “It feels like a more active high.”
Since the synthetic cannabinoids are not 
listed as controlled substances, the blend re -
mains legal in most states. 
Kansas passed the first statewide law pro -
hibiting the sale or possession of synthetic cannabinoids on March 10. 
Kentucky and Alabama followed suit soon 
after. Other states considering banning the 
substance include Georgia, Missouri, and 
Tennessee. Sales remain legal throughout 
Florida.
“I switched [to Spice] because its legal 
and I need to get drug tested. I still prefer weed. I just can’t smoke it right now,” Will 
said.

POLL QUESTION POLL RESULTS TEEING OFF WITH ANTHONY CHIANGThomas Plevik / Alligator Staff
The Gators played their best baseball of the season last weekend after losing three out of their previous 
five games heading into the NCAA Regional. The team registered a .365 average in regional play. 
By ANTHONY CHIANG
Alligator Staff Writer
achiang@alligator.org
   
The Gators seem to know when 
to turn the switch on.
They entered NCAA Region-
als with three meaningless losses 
in their last five games. But all that changed last weekend when they dominated their regional and outscored their opponents 32-5 in three games.
No. 4 Florida (45-15) will look to 
continue its postseason surge when it attempts to advance past No. 20 Miami (43-18) in the NCAA Super Regional which begins Friday at 7 p.m. in McKethan Stadium.
“Our sights are on playing for 
a while into the summer,” coach Kevin O’Sullivan said.
If the Gators are to accomplish 
their coach’s plans and make it to the College World Series for the sixth time in school history, they will need to sustain their perfor-mance from the regional to top the Hurricanes.Whether it be defense, pitching 
or hitting – Florida excelled. 
In the three games, it contin-
ued its defensive success from the regular season and committed zero errors. 
UF is strongest up the middle, 
with shortstop Nolan Fontana (.989 fielding percentage), second base-man Josh Adams (.984) and center fielder Matt den Dekker (.984). 
O’Sullivan said this is one of the 
areas the Gators have improved in the most since last season, when shortstop Mike Mooney commit-ted 18 errors and sported just a .930 fielding percentage.
The UF pitching staff has ben-
efited from the improved defense all season, but it helped itself this weekend. 
The starting pitchers pounded 
the strike zone. Seventy-four per-cent of their pitches went for strikes 
as they allowed just five runs in 
19.1 innings of work while striking 
out 22 batters in the Gainesville Re-gional.UF to host Miami 
in super regionals

Although the 2007 recruiting class consisted 
of just two players, it still managed to become 
the most successful class in Florida softball his-tory. 
Over the course of their careers, Corrie 
Brooks and Francesca Enea either tied or set school records for a four-year period with 233 wins, two Southeastern Conference regular-season championships, two SEC Tournament championships, four NCAA Super Regional appearances and three trips to Oklahoma City for the Women’s College World Series. 
But through all that success, they never ac-
complished the ultimate goal of a national championship – a feat those who are returning will be hungry to achieve come 2011. 
The 15 players returning to UF next season 
will be aided by the arrival of five highly touted recruits, who will be beginning a transforma-tion coach Tim Walton hopes to put his team through over the next few years. 
“The goal is in the next couple recruiting cy-
cles to get more athletic,” Walton said. “I’m not putting any blame on anybody but we hit 109 
home runs and we’re not beating 
out very many infield singles, so 
we’ve got to do some things a little bit differently.”
Walton clearly did a lot of his 
recruiting with that objective in mind, as each of the four position 
players who will be joining the team in 2011 has proven to be a threat on the basepaths. 
The graduation of Enea and Brooks will also 
be addition by subtraction in that regard, as the pair combined for just seven stolen bases on nine attempts last season. 
But that is not to say the seniors won’t be 
missed, as Brooks’ defensive prowess and Enea’s power will be difficult to replace. 
“Those two did just a phenomenal job buy-
ing into what we were talking about in the early Gators look to add speed in 2011UF TRACK
 
Christian Taylor just keeps win-
ning and this time he took his act 
out west.
Taylor, the Southeastern Con-
ference Field Athlete of the Year, won a NCAA Championship in the men’s triple jump with a 2010 American-leading leap of 17.09 meters at the NCAA Outdoor Championships in Eugene, Ore. 
“Getting the outdoor title means 
a lot to me,” Taylor said. “Helping the team and trying to win that team title would really be special.”
Freshman Omar Craddock 
placed sixth overall in the triple jump to earn All-America honors and score vital points for the men’s team.
Florida scored 13 points on the 
opening day to put itself in prime position to accomplish its goal of “Finishing the Mission.” 
The UF men’s 4x100-meter relay 
team, the defending NCAA Cham-
pions, clocked the fastest time in 
the prelims at 38.94, advancing to 
the finals. 
The 4x100-me-
ter final consists 
of eight teams, 
five of which are 
from the SEC. 
Florida’s big-
gest competition 
in capturing the 
men’s overall NCAA Champion-ships, Texas A&M, also qualified 
for the 4x100-meter final.

� Nebraska is reportedly leaving the Big 12 to join the Big Ten. The way the me -
dia is reporting the demise of the Big 12 is making it seem like somebody died. 
“President gathered coaches at 2 p.m. to tell them they did all they could to save Big 12 but were unsuccessful,” Rivals’ Chip Brown tweeted. Did they use a defi -
brillator too, Chip? ... Everybody ready for America to pretend it likes soccer ?Today’s question: Do you think the World Cup is overrated?

them to be leaving us, but I’m very happy with their effort.”
For the ﬁ  rst time since Feb. 9, 
2008, the Gators will have some-one other than Brooks manning third base, and the primary candi-dates at this point look to be rising 
junior Lauren Heil and incoming 
freshman Kasey Fagan. 
“Lauren obviously has been 
working in our program for two years so she’ll get a chance to earn (the job), but Fagan coming in from 
Dunnellon High School is a pretty 
talented kid, so we’ll see how it goes,” Walton said. 
The other primary challenge 
will be replacing the powerful bat of Enea, who established the SEC career record for home runs with 61 and the UF career record for RBIs with 221 during her time as 
a Gator. 
At this point, the plan seems to 
be to slide the versatile Brittany 
Schutte, who set the UF freshman records for home runs (19) and RBIs (59) this season, from desig-nated player out to Enea’s spot in left ﬁ  eld. 
“It’s going to be interesting to 
see what we can do with Schutte,” Walton said. “I really like what she can do at a lot of positions, but I think ideally she’d be in left ﬁ  eld.”
Schutte’s move to the outﬁ  eld 
would free up the designated play-er position for freshman Kelsey Horton, a backup catcher who slugged a team-leading .881 in lim-ited playing time this season. 
Another new face in the Gators’ 
starting lineup for 2011 could be in-coming freshman Cheyenne Coyle, 
a shortstop and 2010 USA Softball 
Junior Women’s National Team camp invite who hit at a .526 clip and had a ﬁ  elding percentage of .995 while playing at Chatsworth High School in West Hills, Calif.
It is clear that incumbent short-
stop Brittany Walker, like every other player on this season’s ros-
ter, will have to ﬁ  ght for her job 
come next season.  THURSDAY, JUNE 10, 2010 �  ALLIGATOR, 19

  The graduation of UF senior Francesca Enea will leave a void in left 
ﬁ  eld. She set the SEC career record for home runs as a Gator.  
All-American Smith advances to ﬁ  nals in men’s 400-meter dash 
to the ﬁ  nals in the men’s 100-meter dash, clocking a time of 10.15. Demps placed sec-ond overall in the semiﬁ  nal heat at the same track he became the co-owner of the U.S. Ju-nior World Record, 10.01.  
Terrell Wilks placed 11th in the 100-me-
ter dash and did not advance.
All-American Calvin Smith advanced to 
the ﬁ  nals in the men’s 400-meter dash. Smith ran the fourth fastest time overall at 45.64. Freshman sprinter Tony McQuay did not advance with Smith, ﬁ  nishing 14th. 
I thought we had a great 
day,” Florida head coach Mike Holloway said. 
“Hats off to Christian Tay-
lor. He had a great perfor-
mance in winning the triple jump and he really kick-started the meet for us.”
The University of Oregon, which is host-
ing the championship, registered a ﬁ  rst day attendance at the meet of 9,981.
The 2010 NCAA Outdoor Champion-
ships continues today in Hayward Field starting at 1 p.m.

we’ve faced is they pitch in very well,” said FAU coach John 
McCormack, who lost to UF on Sunday.
But it wasn’t like the Florida arms didn’t have a lead to 
pitch with.
The Gators received production from up and down the 
lineup in the regional. They crushed nine home runs and posted a .385 average during the weekend. 
“I think that’s the most encouraging thing going into 
(super regionals) – we are doing all three 
phases of the game as well as we have 
done them all year long,” O’Sullivan 
said.
SIX GATORS DRAFTED :  On Tuesday, UF 
closer Kevin Chapman and den Dekker 
were selected in the MLB Draft.
Chapman was taken 119th overall in 
the fourth round by the Kansas City Royals. The New York

THE AZZURRI – The defending champion 
Italians enter the tournament older than an 
adult YMCA basketball team. While Italy can never be written off, will the hunger still be there on a team that looks identical to the one that won in 2006? BAFANA BAFANA – South Africa has the op-portunity to host the world’s greatest tourna-ment, it doesn’t have much else going for it. Bafana Bafana, or “the Boys the Boys,” are ranked dead last in the field of 32 teams and could become the first host nation ever not to advance past the group stage. THE FAVORTIES – Brazil, Spain, Portugal, Netherlands, Italy, Germany, Argentina and England. These eight, in order of FIFA rank-ings, all have a legitimate chance of winning.THE CINDERELLAS – USA, Serbia, Mexico, Denmark and several African nations are not expected to win the tournament, but could. Ghana, Ivory Coast (Côte d’Ivoire) and Nige-
ria are African teams to watch.  
THE UNDERDOGS – Greece, Australia, Switzer-land and Cameroon are all solid teams with good players, unfortunately they all ended up 
with tough draws. While it wouldn’t shock 
anyone if they advanced past the group stage, 
none are expected to. THE BOTTOM-FEEDERS  – New Zealand, Dem-ocratic People’s Republic of Korea, Honduras, 
Japan, South Africa, Uruguay, Algeria, Slove-
nia and Slovakia are just glad to be included 
in the world’s greatest tournament. THE GROUP OF DEATH – Group G is the consensus Group of Death, even though it also contains perhaps the weakest team in the field, Korea DPR. Brazil, Portugal and Ivory Coast comprise the strongest contingent of any three teams in one group. THE QUARTERFINALS – It’s the round that sep-arates the men from the boys. Advance from the group: good. Advance into the final eight: great. The quarterfinal round is where teams start to believe they can capture the cup. INJURIES – Rio Ferdinand (England), Didier Drogba (Ivory Coast), Michael Essien (Ghana) and Michael Ballack (Germany) are all super-stars or captains of their respective teams, yet none will likely play this summer. Injuries have struck nearly every team in the field as players from all countries have been drop-ping faster than Stormtroopers in “Return of the Jedi.”VENUES - South Africa hosts 10 sites including two in Johannesburg. Several of them have yet to ever host a big game and questions 
linger over security and transportation.
WEATHER –The climate in South Africa is 
different all over the country. Some games will be played in temperate weather, while others will be played in the cold. 
JABULANI – The Adidas Jabulani is the of-
ficial match ball for the World Cup. Jabulani 
means rejoice in Zulu, but there’s been more complaining than rejoicing over the ball since its unveiling. 
CHEMISTRY – Some teams have it, some teams 
don’t. USA, Italy, and Germany got it – Eng-
land, not so much. With sex scandals, temper tantrums and more, England has worse team chemistry than the cast of Jersey Shore.  VUVUZELA – All the cup games will be played with background noise of a continuous foghorn drown emanating from a traditional South African blow horn. ESPN – Every match will be televised on ESPN’s family of networks. LA FURIA ROJA – Spain, also called “The Red Fury,” is easily the most talented team in the tournament. ESPN ranked the top 50 players in the World Cup and nine of Spain’s starting 11 were in the rankings.MARADONA & MESSI  – Arguably the 
world’s best player is paired with the world’s most unpredictable coach. Can this former soccer-star-turned coach coexist with the new Argentinean star? R-STARS – Ronaldo (Portugal), Rooney (England), Ribery (France) and Robben (Dutch) are other stars to watch. The R-stars all excelled this year at both the club and national levels.  TEN – It’s more than just a number. As an ESPN commercial stated, “it’s reserved for 
the best, the playmaker, the leader and the 
one that will be remembered forever.” Leg-
ends Pele and Maradona wore it, and now Messi, Kaka, Rooney, Landon Donovan and others wear it.  
THE YANKS – Advancing by any means 
necessary is priority one for the USA, led by 
Donovan, Clint Dempsey and goalkeeper Tim Howard. “We’re a known commodity in the soccer world,” soccer analyst David 
Hirshey said. “We’re not going to sneak up 
on anybody anymore. The scouting report on 
us is fairly simple, we make up for a lack of pedigree and technical skill with lots of heart and physicality.”
