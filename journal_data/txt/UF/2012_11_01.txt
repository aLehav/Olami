Women’s rights activist San-
dra Fluke made an appearance on 
Turlington Plaza on Wednesday 
to encourage students to utilize 
early voting for next week’s presi-dential election.
Fluke stopped at UF as part 
of her “It’s On You” Youth Early Vote Campus Outreach tour.
About 40 students gathered by 
the potato statue to listen.
“Florida is so critical to this elec-
tion,” Fluke said in her speech. 
She received national attention 
after a congressional controversy regarding whether insurance should include a contraception 
mandate. Talk show host Rush Limbaugh then called her a “slut” 
on air.
On Wednesday, Fluke men-
tioned that President Barack 
Obama doubled investment in 
Pell Grants, gave families with college students a tuition tax cred-it and fought to keep student loan rates low.
Victoria Joyal, a 21-year-old computer engineering senior and Vox: Voices for Planned Parent-hood ofﬁ  cer, said she was happy 
Fluke came to 
rally students.
“I’ve noticed 
that a lot of peo-ple aren’t as en-thusiastic about 
voting as they 
should be,” Joy-al said. “Having 
a notable person will get people 
more excited to vote.”Following the speech, Fluke 
walked students to an early vot-
ing van, which took students to polling places in Alachua County.
Fluke is traveling throughout 
the state to mobilize young vot-ers, she said. Her next stop is in Wakulla.
“This is like, razor-thin close,” 
she said, “and youth — college kids — are going to be able to make a difference.”

CRIME
CHRIS ALCANTARA
Alligator Writer
An Oct. 1 attempted sexual and aggravated 
battery incident on campus, which led to a UF 
alert sent out to students, faculty and staff, turned out to be a lie. 
After investigating the incident alleged to 
have occurred between Williamson Hall and Weimer Hall, University Police’s Criminal In-vestigations Division found inconsistencies in the victim’s stories,  which also included ac-counts of being stalked at her off-campus resi-dence, according to a UPD news release. 
When ofﬁ  cers questioned Sarah Lawrence, 
a 20-year-old UF student, about her conﬂ  ict-ing stories, she said she made up her original claims of being attacked and stalked.
On Wednesday, police said they planned to 
ﬁ  le a sworn complaint against Lawrence to the 
State Attorney’s Ofﬁ  ce.
She faces charges of ﬁ  ling a fake police report and providing false information to of-
ﬁ  cers, according to the release. Lawrence de-clined to comment on the incident.
At 9:41 p.m. Oct. 1, police received a call 
about a sexual assault. Three minutes later, a UF Alert was sent, describing the suspect to be a tall, white male with a knife. At 11:05 p.m., police cleared the scene with the alleged sus-pect still on the loose.
“There was a tremendous amount of re-
sources used during this investigation — re-sources that could have been used for other cases,” said UPD spokesman Maj. Brad Bar-ber. 
Contact Chris Alcantara at calcantara@alliga-
tor.org. October Weimer Hall sexual assault claim is false, UF Police say
“...resources that could have been

Editor’s Note: This is the first of 
two articles, which explain the constitutional and local amend-ments on Tuesday’s ballot.
Amendment 1 – Health Care Ser -
vices
This amendment seeks to prevent 
the state government from requiring 
citizens to buy health insurance.
Deirdre Macnab, president of the 
League of Women V oters of Florida, said the amendment proposal is “like a referendum” for President Barack Obama’s federal health care law.
Tony Carvajal, chief of staff at 
the Collins Center for Public Policy, said that while it wouldn’t change 
anything if passed, it would limit 
the state’s ability to pass similar leg-islation if the Affordable Care Act is repealed.
“A ‘yes’ vote supports the idea 
that Floridians should not be re-quired to purchase health insur -
ance,” he said.Amendment 2 –  Veteran’s Prop-
erty Tax Discount
Disabled veterans who weren’t 
Florida residents before enlisting could qualify for a property tax dis-count under this amendment.
Macnab said a “no” vote isn’t 
against veterans but opposes adding it to the state’s constitution.
Carvajal said the proposal is on 
the ballot because the legislature wants it to be a “long-term solu-tion.”
Amendment 3 – State Govern-
ment Revenue Limitation
This amendment seeks to imple-
ment a revenue formula considered in 30 states but only adopted in Col-orado, Macnab said.
The proposal suggests changing 
how state spending caps are deter -
mined. It would change the determi-nants from personal income growth to population and inflation data.
Daniel Smith, a UF political sci-
ence professor, said he moved to Florida from Colorado when the state adopted the policy . He said it prevented states from providing services like public education.
Carvajal said the cap would be-come solidified in the state constitu-tion, which means the state wouldn’t 
be able to respond to sudden chang-
es like natural disasters or changes not reflected in population or infla-tion data, like an influx of students needing college educations.
“A ‘yes’ vote here means restrict-
ing growth in spending in the state 
to no more than the growth in the 
state that year,” he said.
Amendment 
4 – Property 
Tax Limitations; Property Value Decline; Reduc-tion for Non-
homesteaded Assessment Increases; 
Delay of Scheduled Repeal
This amendment aims to spur on 
the home-buying market.
Carvajal said the proposal will 
mainly benefit new-home buyers.
He said backers, like the Florida 
Realtors Association, claim it pro-
vides an incentive for citizens to buy new houses through property 
tax exemptions. Opponents, like the 
Florida League of Cities, claim the tax breaks will come at the expense of local governments.
Carvajal said the amendment 
focuses on whether voters believe private or public investment is more important.
“One way to show what should 
be the proper size of the government is to adjust the amount of money the government has in their hands,” Macnab said.
Amendment 5 – State CourtsThis proposal would give law-
makers power to confirm the gov-ernor’s state Supreme Court justice choices, view complaints against justices and override court decisions more easily.
The biggest change is the Speaker 
of the House could view complaints 
against judges and act upon them 
if the Judicial Qualifications Com-mission doesn’t. The commission is the only body controlling the com-plaints now.
“It’s reflecting that they have a 
monopoly of power in Tallahassee, but that’s not even enough,” Smith said of the Republican-controlled 
legislature.
Amendment 6 – Prohibition on Public Funding of Abortions; Con-
struction of Abortion Rights
Fueling a prominent national de-
bate at the state level, Amendment 6 intends to ensure no state tax dol-lars fund abortions. The amendment 
proposal would also require parental 
consent for minors to get abortions.
Religious-based groups, like the 
Catholic Church, are pushing to pass the amendment.
Sheila Hopkins, Florida Confer -
ence of Catholic Bishops associate director for social concerns/respect life, said few exceptions, like incest, 
rape or danger to the mother’s life, 
are acceptable conditions for abor -
tion.
She said this amendment would 
be “protecting the status quo” be-cause no state revenue is used to pay for employees’ elective abortions.
Staci Fox, CEO of Planned Par -
enthood of North Florida, said a 
“no” vote protects the rights of fe-
male state workers who would elect for abortions.
Fox, also, said a 2004 amendment 
currently requires parental notifica-tion — not consent — for minors’ abortions.

Vice President Joe Biden stepped onto the stage, sun-
glasses at the ready, and flashed a smile at the crowd.
With Election Day looming, Biden crossed Florida, 
visiting Ocala on Wednesday afternoon to rally a crowd 
of about 2,500 supporters.
He stopped in a town where neighborhood lawns 
are spotted with both Mitt Romney and President Ba-rack Obama signs, where the cars that sail down county roads are almost as likely to have a Democratic sticker as a Republican sticker. In Marion County, there are about 82,000 registered Democrats and about 95,000 registered Republicans, according to the Marion Coun-ty Supervisor of Elections office.
“We win Florida, we win this election,” Biden told 
the cheering crowd.
He focused on women’s issues and job growth un-
der the Obama administration and spent most of his about 40-minute speech bashing Romney.
Democratic supporters held “Forward!” signs and 
cheered as Biden wove in his oft-publicized personal anecdotes and emphasized his doubts about Romney’s proposed budget and policies.
“His plans aren’t sketchy,” he said. “They’re Etch A Sketch-y.”
Biden bashed Romney for his comments about 
women’s equality in the workplace, criticizing his re-
cent “binders full of women” comment that exploded 
across the Internet after the second presidential debate.
“I hope he kept that binder,” he said.He said Romney and vice presidential candidate 
Paul Ryan believe their plans will help people, but their vision of the American dream is distorted.
“We’ve seen that movie and how it ends,” Biden 
said. “And on Halloween, it’s a horror movie is what it is.”
Biden mentioned the victims of Hurricane Sandy 
during his speech, praising Northeastern mayors for working together to get affected residents the help they need, despite political affiliation.
“We’re always, always better off as a nation when 
we pull together,” he said.
Leslie Wengler, a 26-year-old Ocala resident, said 
Biden’s points on medical care resonated with her be-cause she has a form of muscular dystrophy. She said 
Obama’s health care law has made it possible to get 
help.
“Without that, I would just be out of luck,” she 
said.
She said she supports Obama and Biden and they’ve 
done a great job during their time in office.
“It takes a while for change to cause an effect,” she 
said. “Change doesn’t happen overnight.”

UF students living in dorms us-
ing the new Windows 8 operating 
system have wireless Internet access again.
The Department of Housing and 
Residence Education completed a code upgrade for campus housing locations Tuesday . Access points for the rest of campus are scheduled for upgrades Monday, Housing Net-work and Systems staff members wrote in an email.
During the residence halls’ up-
grades, access points in each room rebooted, causing disconnection. Students were asked to use the DHNet Wired Service via Ethernet cables to access the Internet.
The timing of the change may 
have been inconvenient for many , but it was necessary due to Win-dows 8’s release, the staff wrote. 
Windows 8 launched to the general 
public Oct. 26.
Applied mathematics sophomore Freddie Sargent, 19, a Beaty Towers 
West resident, said the disconnec-tion posed a problem for him and his roommates.
“Our rooms do not have enough 
Ethernet ports to simultaneously be on the Internet at the same time,” he 
said. “It caused an inability to do my 
normal routine in the comfort of my 
own room.” Wireless Internet access restored to dorms after upgrade
More Wi-Fi upgrades coming MondayReader response

How one blogger 
enrages people with truth
Do you follow the blog “FiveThirtyEight”?
It’s a blog on The New York Times’ website, and it’s 
run by Nate Silver.
At ﬁ  rst glance, it appears to be a lot of charts and graphs that 
are probably really confusing.
Silver’s job is to analyze a bunch of data and then report to 
his readers what the data says.
Recently, he’s come under attack by, you guessed it, the Re-
publicans.
“Every major political betting market and every major fore-
casting tool is predicting an Obama victory right now, and for 
the same reason: Obama remains ahead in enough states that, unless the polls are systematically wrong, or they undergo a change unlike any we’ve yet seen in the race, Obama will win the 
election,” said Ezra Klein in a blog for The Washington Post.
He also notes that all of the criticisms of Silver’s work do not 
encompass his accuracy. Most complaints are that he’s “repack-
aging” the poll results that are already out there, and that he won’t release his “code.”
Though some people argue Silver’s liberal alliance could 
sway the results, because almost everything points toward an Obama victory, his analysis must be skewed.
“Silver is currently saying that in some scenarios, Obama will 
win and in some scenarios Romney will win, and the ﬁ  rst batch of scenarios outnumber the second batch of scenarios by about 3 to 1,” said Joel Achenbach, also of The Washington Post.
However, Silver’s “FiveThirtyEight” blog leaves a market for 
someone on the other side. Why not create a conservative-lean-ing blog that interprets the same polls? People on the other side of the aisle could feel secure hearing information from a source they trust.
A popular deﬁ  nition of insanity, however, is trying the same 
thing repeatedly and expecting different results. If you analyze the same polls, you’re still working with the same numbers.
Silver runs his data analysis based on his work with base-
ball’s sabermetrics (like the movie “Moneyball”). Silver wrote “Baseball and politics are data-driven,” according to a 2008 Newsweek article before that year’s presidential election. “But a lot of the time, that data might be used badly . In baseball, that may mean looking at a statistic like batting average when things like on-base percentage and slugging percentage are far more 
correlated with winning ballgames. In politics, that might mean 
cherry-picking a certain polling result.”
People, essentially, need to calm down and accept what ser-
vice Silver is providing.
“If the bookies in Vegas keeping giving the Falcons better 
odds at winning the NFC than the Bears, do Bears fans go bal-listic on the bookies and try to blame them if it turns out that At-lanta does win the NFC? Of course not,” said Michael Tomasky of The Daily Beast. “That would be totally preposterous, just as 
this Silver-bashing is totally preposterous now.”
“CAN’T BELIEVE METOROLOGISTS USED MATH AND 
SCIENCE TO PREDICT THIS STORM. THEY MUST BE MAG-
IC WIZARDS,” read one of Silver’s tweets Monday.
A vote for the third party is not a waste
I’m tired of being told I’m wasting my vote.
Who is pleased with the way Washington, D.C., is op-
erating?
The Obama administration has fought for the power to 
detain Americans indeﬁ  nitely without trial. This is one of the 
most egregious breaches of fundamental liberty in the his-
tory of this country.
Isn’t this something worth mentioning at a debate between 
the two candidates? Apparently not. It was not brought up at all in the two-party debates.
This is probably because Mitt Romney and Barack Obama 
agree on this issue. They both seem to want the power to de-tain people indeﬁ  nitely without trial.
What about the drug war? What about all of the people 
imprisoned for nonviolent crimes involving marijuana? What about our Mexican neighbors who are dying? None of that was mentioned, either.
Perhaps it wasn’t mentioned because they agree on the 
drug war, too.
What about drone warfare and domestic drones? What 
about the Patriot Act and the Transportation Security Ad-ministration? What about Internet freedom? I could go on.
Any of these issues is worthy of protest. Why don’t we 
protest? Are we ﬁ  ne with the way things are? Are we too con-sumed with our own lives and problems to stand up for the rights that are violated?
What will our children think about us?At least pick up the phone and call your Congress people. 
Tell them they will not be elected if they are hostile toward liberty. No one actually does that, though.
Fine, then. At least use the power of your vote to stand for 
what’s right.
Why would it be a wasted vote to stand for what’s right? 
Is freedom really so unpopular?
There is a candidate who stands for freedom: Gary John-
son, the Libertarian candidate for president. If you’re still on the fence, then I encourage you to research his positions.
If you don’t quite agree with him, then I suggest you re-
search Jill Stein of the Green Party.
I have been treated with much hostility since announcing my support for Johnson. Without rebutting one of my arguments, I’ve been called “stupid” by more than a few people.
This social pressure, the illu-
sion that to suggest anything oth-er than voting for a Republican or Democrat is crazy or naive, may be the strongest pressure against the third-party candidates.
Of course, the two parties 
have colluded to keep these third-party candidates out of the minds of the populace. From ballot access to debate par-ticipation, third parties are structurally restricted. They are 
required to complete hurdles like gathering, in some cases, 
millions of signatures.
You might not know this, but both Johnson and Stein 
have sued the Commission on Presidential Debates. You may not know this either, but Philips, the largest of the original 10 sponsors to pull the Commission’s support, pulled its fund-ing after the exclusion of Johnson from the debates.
These seem like big stories to me, but most of the news 
outlets don’t cover them. Despite the fact that independents 
make up the largest portion of voters, it still seems like a 
crazy , stupid or naive idea to many to vote for someone who isn’t a Democrat or a Republican.
Consider this: unless we issue the two parties an incen-
tive to change their behaviors, how else will they decide to change? If you keep voting for the people of the same party despite the fact that you disagree with them half the time, what reason would they have to act differently?
We all have to do our part to change the social and po-
litical landscape. Unless we all do our small part, nothing changes. If we all change our behaviors, society changes one bit at a time.
This is not a naive sentiment — this is an accurate assess-
ment of the nature of society.

A year after playing at the Swamp 
Restaurant as an unsigned artist, Miami native Cris Cab returns to Gainesville to 
play at High Dive tonight.
The 19-year-old is signed to Mercury 
Records with famous rapper/producer Pharrell as his mentor.Connor Glenn, a 20-year-old public re-
lations junior, said he was excited to hear 
Cris Cab is coming back to Gainesville. 
He saw the singer perform at the Swamp, and if he has time, he will attend the show tonight.
“Last time I saw him perform, he ex-
ceeded my expectations,” he said.
Cab said he is looking forward to the 
show because some of his friends from Miami go to UF.
“It’s cool to come back to Gainesville 
and see familiar faces and play music,” he said.
Cab traveled to 18 cities for The Rise 
Tour to promote his EP , “Rise,” which was released Oct. 9.
He described his sound as “a fusion 
of all different kinds of music — reggae, soul and hip-hop with some pop.”
This will be Cab’s third to last stop of 
the tour with stops in Orlando and Tal-lahassee.
He said Florida is a good place to end 
the tour because it’s where he grew up.
“It’s where a lot of my material comes 
from,” Cab said.
Local rapper Rezza will open the 
show.
The 19-year-old Santa Fe journal-
ism and advertising sophomore said his roommate went to school with Cab, and he looked Cab up when he heard about the show.
“I like the whole style he does, and I 
like being around that environment,” he said.
He said it’s awesome to see someone 
the same age as him doing big things.
The 18-and-older show starts at 10 
p.m. Doors open at 9 p.m.
Tickets for the event are available on-
line at www.ticketweb.com for $10 and at the door for $12.THURSDAY, NOVEMBER 1, 2012

Lost in an endlessly growing queue and buried 
beneath thousands of rows of titles, there are these 
hidden gems of Netflix:
“Chico & Rita” (2010)
94 Minutes, NR
Animated movies aren’t only for children. The 
Spanish-language film, directed by Torro Errando, Javier Mariscal and Fernando Trueba, follows the story of talented Cuban pianist Chico (Eman Xor 
Oña) and the beautiful singer Rita (Limara Meneses). The two fall in love after an extremely fun and energetic opening scene. As time 
goes on, they grow apart and must 
rekindle the joy of their past.
“Chico & Rita” is an animated 
movie that is likely to be unlike 
anything you’ve seen before. The film has themes of love, lust, drugs, loneliness and betrayal. The animation is used to its fullest in this film. During the times of great excitement and joy , the colors pop and dance, which truly feels like watching music. 
When the story reaches darker places, the morose 
shades add to the gravity of the scene.
Although it is an animated feature, you may not 
want any children around watching it. However, if the child can appreciate the intimacies and nuances of love lost and love found and enjoys the explora-tion of the soul of a struggling and lovelorn artist, then maybe that child is mature enough to watch “Chico & Rita.”
Awesome movie you’ve already seen: “The 
Grey” (2011)
Need more Liam Neeson in your life? Need 
more wolves, too? How about a crushing sense of the inevitable demise of your mortal flesh? If you answered “yes” to one or more of these questions, then “The Grey” is the movie for you!

With hope in her eyes, Cheryl Calhoun 
hangs a bright red sale sign in the front win-
dow of her store.
After 20 years in business, Wild Iris Books, 
802 W. University Ave., will move and down-size its inventory with a 20 percent-off sale. 
Calhoun co-owns the store with Erica Merrell.
“I’ve been here for 8 years. It’s sad to see 
this space go,” Calhoun said. “I think we’re moving forward, though, in a community that 
represents not only feminism, but the integra-
tion of that in today’s culture.”
The store will remain in its current location 
until Dec. 22, and the sale will go on until the store’s move, Merrell said.
“We want to honor the space and legacy 
here,” Merrell said. “We want to be here 
through the holidays for the customers, keep our sale going and hopefully end with a cel-
ebration.”
Calhoun said she and Merrell have been 
looking for new locations and have a verbal 
agreement with the owner of a smaller store-front.
Wild Iris Books will not announce its new 
location until it establishes a written agree-
ment.
The sale covers all merchandise, excluding 
consignment items and e-readers.
There is also a garage sale table, where 
prices range from a quarter to $3, Merrell said. The merchandise on the table will be updated 
whenever there is an empty space.
In addition to the sale, the owners have 
reached out to the community to get its opin-ion about what it would like to see in the new 
store, Calhoun said.
“With our customers’ help, we can re-imag-
ine what a feminist bookstore in 2012 should 
look like,” she said.
Calhoun said big plans are in the works for 
the new store.
“We’ve come a long way in the last 20 
years,” she said, “but we still have a long way to go.”Wild Iris Books prepares to move locations with sale

Music is my life, and luckily 
enough, it’s also my job. In addition 
to being your resident music guru, I am also (perhaps unsurprisingly) the Gainesville College Marketing 
Representative for Sony Music En-
tertainment. Yes, the job is as awe-some as it sounds.
Every year, all 70 college reps sta-
tioned across the country journey to New York City for our department’s annual meetings, which serendipi-tously land about the same time as CMJ Music Marathon.  
In this whirlwind of a week ﬁ  lled 
with panels and performances, I get a healthy heap of industry knowl-edge and the inside scoop about the hottest artists coming around the bend. I know the new signings and developing acts who, this time next year, will have me saying, “I knew them when…” Guaranteed.
Share these artists with your 
crew, and become the in-house DJ in your friend group overnight.
MS MRThere is something so dark, and 
yet so charming, about MS MR (Miss Mister). The chillwave duo’s debut EP , “Candy Bar Creep Show,” is melodic and haunting, romanti-
cized nightmare composed of four 
addicting tracks. 
The group’s moniker is self-ex-
planatory — MS refers to the vocals, and MR refers to the music.
Lizzy Plapinger, co-founder of 
Neon Gold Records, provides the lead vocals stuck in your head. MS MR’s respective elements are per-
fect complements of each other, like 
yin and yang. 
Lizzy’s vocals echo and brighten the chilling, synth-pop instrumentals.
Whether the 
band is preaching 
the fate of the world, an abandoned soul and body or unseen creatures, 
it’s easy to get lost in its sound.
The two project something much 
bigger and more bombastic than their 
size would imply (check out the ﬁ  rst single “Hurricane” for a perfect ex-ample), and as a very important side note, its live performance shakes, rattles and rolls. Whatever images MS MR has stirred or inspired in your imagination deﬁ  nitely come to life on stage.
Paloma FaithForget triple threats, Paloma Faith 
is a quadruple force to be reckoned with.  Faith is the UK-born singer, songwriter, dancer and actress who hit the scene in 2009 with her debut album “Do You Want the Truth or Something Beautiful?”
She’s entirely theatrical and ani-
mated from head-to-toe, and her sound is this eclectic, crossover blend of soul and pop.Enjoying her style and perfor-
mance is like time traveling; she’s truly vintage and has the ability to span decades, making her instantly unique from her comparative con-temporaries Adele, Emeli Sande and the late Amy Winehouse.
In 2011, Faith earned a nomina-
tion for Best British Female at the BRIT Awards, and she closed the ceremony by sharing the stage with Cee Lo Green. It’s clear she’s not only a pulse point for hot up-and-coming singers, but she’s a star.  
One of Paloma’s newest singles, 
“Picking Up the Pieces,” mourns a 
dead love that’s long gone, and half 
of that love feels slighted.

Across campus, students claim to have the 
worst roommate imaginable: “She drinks my 
milk,” “He never washes his dishes,” “She borrows my clothes without asking,” and so on. But no roommate is half as evil as the main character in “Don’t Trust the B---- in Apt 23.”
Chloe, the untrustworthy roommate, 
played by “Breaking Bad” alumna Krysten Ritter, returned to television last week after a long-awaited late season premiere.
Her criminal record is impressively origi-
nal. She once told a roommate’s parents he was kidnapped, so she could use the ransom money to 
go to Paris.
Her newest roommate 
June, played by Dreama Walker, is a young and naive Wall Street hopeful fresh out of college.
Chloe goes to any means necessary to ruin her roommate’s life, and each episode features an outrageously hi-larious new scheme.
The show breaks all preconceived notions 
that network television is less likely to push the envelope. ABC is even allowing Ritter to pose in Playboy to promote the show.
“Don’t Trust the B---- in Apt 23” airs on 
ABC every Tuesday at 9:30 p.m. Trust ABC’s ‘Don’t Trust the B---- in Apt 23’ for TV antics

Good mood music.
That’s how Nikki Bruno, 21, de-
scribed Mayday Parade, the first band she fell in love with enough to etch a tattoo of on her skin.
Mayday Parade plays Sunday at 
High Dive with opening acts The Postelles and The Maine. Doors open at 6 p.m., and tickets are avail-able for $20 on www.ticketweb.com
The band formed in 2005, after 
two Tallahassee bands, Defining Moment and Kid Named Chicago, 
joined forces. Mayday Parade since released two EPs and three albums. 
The most recent is self-titled “May-day Parade,” released in October 2011.
The band is not a stranger to 
Gainesville. Derek Sanders, lead vocalist, said when it was starting 
up, the band played in the Swamp 
all the time.
“I love Gainesville,” he said. “I 
always enjoy going back there.”
Mayday Parade even has a song, 
“Your Song,” that mentions the city. Sanders wouldn’t say for cer -
tain if “Your Song” is going to be on the setlist for the show, but he did 
hint at it.
“We’ll have to wait and see and leave it as a surprise,” he said, 
laughing.
Sanders has been involved with 
music since he was 11 years old, when his older brother taught him how to play the guitar.
He then met Brooks Betts, the 
guitarist for Mayday Parade, in sev-enth grade, and they started a band together.
“Ever since I met Brooks, it’s 
been our goal and our focus to be in a band and make it together,” Sand-ers said.
He said the inspiration for May-
day Parade’s songs come mostly 
from real life experiences and “just 
thinking about things growing up,” like relationships with friends and family.
Bruno said Mayday Parade 
helped her through a rough time in her life, when someone close to her began using prescription pills destructively.
“I turned to Mayday Parade to 
get me through those times that were so bittersweet,” she said.
Sanders said it’s “very humbling 
and very awesome” when he hears that his band’s music helped people through their lives.
“It’s an unexpected bonus,” he 
said. “We love doing this. It’s what 
we have always loved to do.”
Bruno said her first concert was Mayday Parade in 2007, and since 
then, she has seen them four times, most recently at this year’s Warped Tour.
She said her favorite song by 
Mayday Parade was “Miserable At Best,” from its first album, “A 
Lesson In Romantics,” which she 
described as her “belt-it-out-in-the-car, know-every-single-word” song.
Sanders said the upcoming 
show will include a mixture of songs from old to new. He said it’ll include some staple tour songs, but they have switched up the setlist.
“I’m very excited,” he said. “It’s 
going to be a good show.”
Mayday Parade performs songs both old and new SundaymusicThis column is provided by Ariel Barnes, a 21-year-old majoring in international studies. Would

Mediocre Advice,
At ladies night at the club, all my single girls 
get paired, while my not-so-single self is left alone. I feel bad pulling the “I have a boy -
friend,” card, but I don’t know how to make it 
less awkward.

Dear Mediocre Advice,
What is the difference between f--king 
and making love?
Dear Friend,
You can f--k someone you love, and you can make love to someone you f--k. F--king is similar to the dirty feeling it leaves after the word exits your mouth. It’s ruthless and fun, but it doesn’t mean anything. Mak-ing love is passionate and deeply intense, whether it’s with your long-time boyfriend or stranger. Above all, the chemistry of the two, or however many people involved, is 
the most important factor. Dear Friend,
You don’t have to do anything you don’t want to do. Be mean and clear, or guys will continue to try to latch 
onto you. Say one of these three options: a) “I do not 
want to dance with you;” b) “You creep me out a lot, 
so please go away;” or c) “I didn’t come here so you 
can rub your penis all over me. That’s gross. Back 
off.” Make eye contact, and stand your ground. The 
worst-case scenario is he calls you a b---h, but that’s 
better than being his hump toy for the night.Dear Mediocre Advice,
Is it true that pretty girls can get any 
guy they want?
Dear Friend,
False. Pretty girls may have it easier to get it in with more guys than an average, homely girl, but they cannot get any guy they want. Surprisingly enough, guys have a say in who they want to sleep with, too. The hypotheti-cal pretty girl can slut it up as much as she wants, but if the guy she’s hunting down doesn’t reciprocate those wonderful and filthy sexual feelings, or if he is not drunk enough, it won’t happen. A pretty girl getting another man in bed and her actually keeping him around are two completely different things. People forget there are quali-ties, such as intelligence and personality, that are the results of good parenting. Looks can get you as far as a 
guy’s bed, but not breakfast the next morning.  BUY IT. SELL IT. FIND IT. 373-FIND

team’s 33-10 win against Kentucky on Saturday in Columbia, Mo.
� JUNIOR JAMES FRANKLIN HAS MISSED 
TWO GAMES THIS SEASON DUE TO SHOULDER AND KNEE INJURIES.
  JOE MORGAN
 Alligator Staff Writer
 
  The Gators have multiple dual-threat quar-
terbacks on their schedule this season.
  Florida has already faced mobile gunsling-
ers Johnny Manziel of Texas A&M and Aaron 
Murray of Georgia. UF still has a date against Florida State’s EJ Manuel in Tallahassee on Nov. 24.
  But none stood taller before the 2012 season 
began than Missouri signal caller James Frank-lin — until the injuries piled up.
  Franklin suffered injuries to both shoulders 
— one during spring practice and the other 
against Georgia on Sept. 8. He also suffered a 
knee sprain against Vanderbilt on Oct. 6. The junior quarterback missed games against Ari-zona State on Sept. 15 and Alabama on Oct. 
13.
  Franklin, who has not attempted more than 
10 passes in a game since Sept. 29, will start 
against the Gators on Saturday, Missouri coach 
Gary Pinkel said.
  “He’s not been healthy all year,” Pinkel said. 
“Does that affect your team? There’s no ques-
tion about that. We all know that. Take any 
starting quarterback out of any program and 
it’s going to have a huge impact.”
  Franklin’s absence has put a damper on the Tigers’ ﬁ  rst season in the Southeastern Confer-
ence. 
After ﬁ  nishing 8-5 last year, Missouri al-
ready has four losses in its ﬁ  rst eight games.
  The Tigers recorded their ﬁ  rst SEC win 
against Kentucky on Oct. 27 after dropping 
their ﬁ  rst four games against conference foes by an average margin of 19.5 points.
  Adjusting to the SEC has been difﬁ  cult, Pin-
kel said, especially with Franklin limited.
  “The difference between the Big 12 and the 
SEC is the SEC has a lot more good teams,” Pinkel said. 
“And I think that’s fair to say. I think it’s 
hard to argue that.”
  Last season, Franklin threw for 2,865 yards 
and ranked second in the Big 12 behind Kan-sas State’s Collin Klein for rushing yards by a quarterback with 981. Franklin averaged 4.5 
yards per rush.
  In 2012, Franklin has run for just 75 yards on 
51 carries, relying more on his arm in an effort 
to avoid further injury. Not including sacks, 
Franklin has just ﬁ  ve rushing attempts in his 
past three games.
  Although Pinkel named Franklin the starter 
for Saturday’s game, Florida has been prepar-ing for both Franklin and Missouri backup quarterback Corbin Berkstresser.
  “Their offense doesn’t change a lot from one 
quarterback to another,” UF defensive coordi-nator Dan Quinn said.

THE ADAM BOMB
    Even ﬁ  ve days later, this loss still stings. 
It hurts. 
  The Gators fumbled away a golden 
opportunity. If Jordan Reed scored, Florida would have had a chance to tie the game and 
pull out an overtime win. In all likelihood, UF 
would have been undefeated heading into a matchup with FSU on Nov. 24.
  Sure, No. 7 Florida could still reach the na-
tional title game, but it will need a 2006-like domino effect.
  Florida’s hope for Atlanta hinges on Ole 
Miss or Auburn beating Georgia.
  Now ﬁ  ve days removed from a crushing 
loss, the Gators are left to wonder, “What if?”
  Still, all is not lost.  Coach Will Muschamp has UF on the verge 
of one of the school’s most successful seasons ever. Only Steve Spurrier and Urban Meyer have won 10 games at UF.
  Florida faces Missouri this Saturday. The 
Tigers, playing their ﬁ  rst season in the South-eastern Conference, just won their ﬁ  rst SEC 
game.
  They even made shirts celebrating their 33-10 win against Ken-
tucky. Florida didn’t play its best in a 38-0 shutout of Kentucky.
  After Missouri, 
Florida pays for Lou-isiana and Jackson-ville State to suffer through four quar-ters in The Swamp.
  Who would’ve guessed this team heads 
into Tallahassee with a 10-1 record?
  Only one writer on the alligatorSports staff 
(me) picked UF to win at least eight games. 
 Florida entered the season ranked No. 23 
in the AP and Coaches’ poll. 
  Unfortunately, the discussion following 
“The Largest Outdoor Turnover Party” was centered around “I told you so.”
  Nobody thought a team ranked 102nd in 
total offense could remain a contender for any title. Florida proved it on Saturday.   The Gators know they screwed up. UF still has plenty to play for

  Florida opened its Southeastern Con-
ference tournament schedule on Hal-
loween, and Ole Miss gave the No. 1 seeded Gators a scare.
But in the end, UF topped Ole Miss 
2-1 to advance to a semiﬁ  nals match 
against  Missouri on Friday.
  The Gators had controlled the game 
since a 12th-minute goal off the foot of 
Jo Dragotta gave them an early lead. Florida had buckled down on defense, preventing Ole Miss from getting a solid attack going. That lasted until the 81st minute.
  The Rebels lined up for their third 
corner kick in two minutes. Forward 
Sara Coleman delivered the ball into the 
box, and defender Maddie Friedmann got it past goalkeeper Taylor Burke, ty-ing the game and shocking the Gators.
  “We need to stop giving away too 
many corner kicks,” Dragotta said after the game. “They’ve been our Achilles’ heel all year.”
  With only nine minutes remaining in 
regulation, Florida pressed the attack for-
ward, taking three shots in the next 8 minutes. Junior Maggie Rodgers 
had a one-on-one opportunity against Rebels keeper Kelly McCormick, but her shot landed in McCormick’s hands.
  In the 89th minute, junior Taylor Tra-
vis was fouled outside of the penalty box, and SEC Offensive Player of the 
Year Erika Tymrak took the free kick.
  “The clock was running down, it was Florida survives early test

After giving up five sacks in 
Saturday’s 17-9 loss to Georgia, the 
Florida offensive line knew it need-
ed a wake-up call. 
Senior tackle Xavier Nixon and 
junior center Jonotthan Harrison took the initiative, calling a players-only meeting for the unit on Sun-
day . Junior guard Jon Halapio said 
the meeting was called to make sure the entire line knew its performance 
needed to improve. 
“We need to step up,” Halapio 
said. “We needed to be more con-sistent and just all around got to get 
better.”
Harrison said he does not expect 
the pass protection to be an issue going forward.
“Last game wasn’t our best 
performance, but we’ve shown what we’re capable of, and it’s well 
known the 
potential that 
our offensive line has,” 
Harrison said. “I just know we’re going to bounce back this Saturday and make sure everyone is funda-
mentally sound on the offensive 
line.”
Screen Game: In each of the past 
two games, the Gators’ longest play 
has come on a screen pass. In UF’s 
win over South Carolina, it was a 
39-yard pass to tight end Jordan Reed. Against Georgia, Mike Gil-
lislee made the team’s longest play 
with a 29-yard catch. 
Offensive coordinator Brent 
Pease said the screens are effective when used at the right time.
“If you’re going to be good in 
screens, you have to dedicate some time on it,” Pease said. “Reads and timing with the linemen and setting 
up with the back.”
Fullback Hunter Joyer said an in-
crease in screens could help neutral-ize opposing pass rushes.
“It would change up the de-
fense,” Joyer said. “They couldn’t rush as hard anymore. It would get them guessing about other things.”
Injuries: Junior defensive back Cody 
Riggs, who has not played since he 
suffered a fractured right foot in the Southeastern Conference opener 
against Texas A&M on Sept. 8, has 
no timetable for a return to action, defensive coordinator Dan Quinn 
said on Wednesday. Quinn did not 
rule out the possibility of Riggs tak-ing a medical redshirt, although the 
coaches haven’t discussed it.
Quinn said he was optimistic that 
defensive tackle Leon Orr would play against Missouri on Saturday . 
A team spokesperson confirmed that Orr was hospitalized earlier 
this week with flu-like symptoms.  
Linebacker Jelani Jenkins left 
Saturday’s game after re-aggravat-ing a hamstring injury that caused 
him to miss Florida’s game against Vanderbilt on Oct. 13. 
Quinn said that Jenkins has been 
a full participant in practice this week.
“He had a good week of practice 
leading up [to the Georgia game], so not sure why some of the recurring 
things have happened,” Quinn said. 
“Hopefully all of this is behind him and we can keep moving forward.”

While Spurrier said the 
Gamecocks gave the Gators 
fumble after fumble on Oct. 20, the Gators delivered the SEC East title to the Bulldogs 
on a silver platter.
Jordan Reed losing the foot-
ball at the 5-yard line stands as 
the lasting image of the 2012 season. Not because of the mistake, but because of how fitting it was.
Florida is close, just not on 
that national title level. But the 
season isn’t over.
There’s no use delving into 
the scenarios in which Florida 
can make this bowl game or that one.
“We’re just focusing on 
Florida,” cornerback Marcus Roberson said. “Getting back to where we need to be.”
Here’s where Roberson is 
wrong. Florida doesn’t need to go anywhere.
While this team isn’t near 
perfect, what they’ve done this season is impressive.
The Gators have inherent 
issues on offense, defense and special teams.
Running back Mike Gil-
lislee has slowed since his career day against LSU. He  doesn’t have a solid backup, 
which is a death sentence in 
the SEC.
Quarterback Jeff Driskel 
can’t put together a consistent passing game.
The offensive line man-
handled the defensive lines of LSU and South Carolina, then fell flat against previously un-
derperforming UGA.
Florida’s defense faltered 
late on Saturday.
While kicker Caleb Stur -
gis and punter Kyle Christy 
have been stellar, the Gators can’t find somebody to return kicks.
There are no “moral victo-
ries” in the SEC, but if they can help soothe the pain of “What if,” then they’ll have to do.

Late goal nets victory
a tie game, and it’s single elimina-
tion,” Tymrak said. “I kind of knew 
I had to put it in.”
“I saw a gap, and Adriana (Leon) 
and Havana (Solaun) were up there 
with me, and they said, ‘Erika, this is your shot, take it.’… I just took a deep breath and hit it.”
Tymrak’s shot flew past McCor -
mick and gave the Gators the win. Florida (15-4-1, 12-2 SEC) had no trouble holding on to its 2-1 lead for 
the last minute and a half against Ole 
Miss (13-9, 5-9 SEC) and advanced to the SEC tournament semifinals. 
“Just winning and advancing is 
the goal at this point, and we did just that,” coach Becky Burleigh said. 
The Gators built their momen-tum early in the first half, something 
they had struggled with during 
their past few games. Florida took five shots in the first half, including Dragotta’s early goal.
“We really moved the ball well in 
the first half and created a real boat-load of opportunities,” Burleigh said. 
Florida will try to carry the mo-
mentum from this victory into its semifinal match against Missouri 
on Friday . The Gators defeated the 
Tigers 2-1 in their previous meeting 
on Oct. 12.SOCCEr , from page 14

Finding consistent offense was problem-
atic for Florida last season, but Connecticut 
coach Geno Auriemma has an answer for UF 
and the rest of women’s basketball: lower the 
rims. 
Averaging 67.5 points per game, the Gators 
ranked 75th nationally in scoring. They were 101st in shooting percentage, making just 40.3 
percent of their shots from the floor. 
The averages were significantly lower 
than Florida’s men’s 
team, which scored 75.9 points per game on 46.3 percent 
shooting.
Citing women’s 
college basketball’s 
increasing struggle to attract an audience, 
Auriemma brainstormed a way to make the sport more enjoyable. 
His big idea for driving up attendance is 
to increase scoring by lowering the rims and instituting new timing rules. 
“What makes fans not want to watch 
women’s basketball is that some of the play-ers can’t shoot, and they miss layups, and that forces the game to slow down,” Auriemma told the Hartford Courant on Oct. 22. “Let’s say the average men’s player is 6-foot-5, and the average woman is 5-foot-11. Let’s lower the rim seven inches; let’s say 7.2 inches to honor Title IX [established in 1972].”
Inducted into the Basketball Hall of Fame 
in 2006, Auriemma is one of the sport’s tran-scendent leaders. He has won seven national championships and made 13 trips to the Final Four since becoming the coach of UConn in 1985.
Despite Auriemma’s success in the sport, 
some Gators players were against his idea for 
wholesale changes to the game. 
“[Lowering the rim] is just kind of degrad-
ing toward the women who play basketball to 
think that we have to change something like 
that for our game to be more exciting,” red-
shirt freshman Carlie Needles said. “Geno is different. He can say things like that because he is one of the best. Maybe he does have a good reason why; I personally don’t agree 
with it. I don’t know who else would.”
Coach Amanda Butler was careful to stay 
neutral when discussing the subject. 
She served on the Women’s Basketball 
Coaches Association Board of Directors, 
where Auriemma formerly was president. 
“He wants what’s best for the game and what’s going to continue to grow the game,” she said. “Certainly not every idea is a good idea, but you sometimes don’t find out until you do something that’s a little bit different.”

UConn coach Geno Auriemma’s suggestion that the women’s rims be lowered.
Gators respond to esteemed coach’s idea to lower rims

Coach Billy Donovan said he 
doesn’t like to name starters, but 
he admitted Monday that four of the five spots are just about set by a process of elimination. The one 
role that isn’t defined yet? Small 
forward.  
After backing up Erving Walker 
for two years, Scottie Wilbekin will be the Gators’ starting point guard. Patric Young and Erik Murphy will start in the frontcourt, and Kenny Boynton will return to his usual role as shooting guard.  
As for small forward, Casey 
Prather and Mike Rosario are fight-ing for the starting role. 
The 6-foot-3 Rosario started 
in Saturday’s scrimmage against 
Rollins College and is expected to 
start again in tonight’s exhibition against Nebraska-Kearney at 7 in the O’Connell Center. 
Donovan said the Gators would 
have no problem using the 6-foot-6 Prather against bigger opponents. 
“That’s the one spot for us right 
now where I think we have two 
guys,” Donovan said. Prather will miss the exhibi-
tion after suffering a concussion 
in Saturday’s 
scrimmage, the 
team announced Wednesday. 
Rosario got 
the start against Rollins because of his improved c o n s i s t e n c y, Donovan said.  
“As far as my trust level for him 
off the court, I think it’s growing and growing because he is taking 
care of his responsibilities,” Dono-van said. 
At media day on Oct. 10, Dono-
van discussed his disappointment 
in Rosario for his inconsistency. Donovan specifically focused on the number of games and practices 
Rosario missed last season because 
of mild injuries, even adding that his daughter would have recovered from a hip pointer sooner than the 10 days Rosario needed. 
“Coach was just trying to be fun-
ny and trying to put a little smile on my face, but I didn’t take it person-ally at all,” Rosario said. “I look at it 
as a motivation, so those comments really pushed me.”
Although Donovan has been im-
pressed with Rosario’s hard work 
and change in attitude over the past two months, it isn’t enough to guar -
antee him the start at the three spot 
when the regular season begins.
“To say that that’s the starting 
lineup for the year, it could be in 
some games (and) it may not be in other games,” Donovan said. “To me, guys starting and not starting can be a direct impact of what hap-pens that week.”
