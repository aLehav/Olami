Recent reports from the National Association of Colleges 
and Employers show that graduating seniors may have 
brighter futures than they think.
NACE’s April 2012 Salary Survey shows the overall me-
dian starting salary for 2012 undergraduates has risen 4.5 percent, from $40,735 in 2011 to $42,569.
The report is based on data from employers, the Bureau 
of Labor Statistics, the Census Bureau and Job Search Intel-ligence.
Education and communications majors are seeing the 
biggest increase in median starting salaries. The median sal-ary for education majors increased from $35,828 in 2011 to $37,423.
Rachel Brunges, a 21-year-old special education master’s 
student, said she’s glad the median starting salary has in-creased because she thinks teachers are already underpaid.
Not only are median starting salaries rising, but another 
recent NACE report says employers expect to hire 10.2 per-cent more college graduates from the class of 2012 than they did from the class of 2011.
Brunges said she plans to look for teaching jobs in Ala-
chua County after she graduates in May from the ProTeach program, a ﬁ  ve-year education program that includes a master’s degree.
“I think it thoroughly prepares teachers, and principals 
seem very interested in hiring education students who grad-Median salary on

STUDENT GOVERNMENT

Alligator Staff Writer
Student Government ofﬁ  cials acknowledged 
the close of a turbulent year and the need for stu-
dent unity in the next year Wednesday night at the SG Banquet.
Former Student Body President Ben Meyers 
and his successor, Anthony Reynolds, praised SG for making strides throughout Reynolds’ transition from vice president to president and despite several members of the SG staff leaving.
They cited the extended Library West hours, 
expanded free printing, stalled block tuition and Reitz Union expansion and renovation plans as successes for SG and the Student Body.
About 200 people listened as ofﬁ  cials and 
newly sworn-in Student Body President Tj Vil-lamil urged students to stand together in the up-coming year.Reynolds reminded them of the Senate mot-
to: “The welfare of the state depends upon the morals of the citizens.”
Reynolds gave out awards to SG ofﬁ  cials and 
created a few of his own, including the Sandy 
V ernon Leader of Virtue Award, named for the late SG ofﬁ  ce employee and given to former Senate President Mi-
cah Lewis.
After the new executive 
ofﬁ  cials had been sworn into their positions, Villamil urged his audience to get students involved on campus and in 
government voting. He said they need to priori-tize higher education.
“We need to step up right now and make our 
stand,” he said.

University Police charged a Sigma 
Alpha Epsilon fraternity member with 
using a police scanner as a lookout de-vice.
Matthew D. Sullivan, 19, was 
charged with unlawful use of police communications after ofﬁ  cers saw him stuff a scanner into his front pocket at the SAE house on Fraternity Row dur-ing a party Tuesday morning. About 125 people attended the party , several of whom were underage and trying to throw away alcoholic drinks when of-ﬁ  cers arrived, police said.UPD did not arrest anyone else at 
the party.
Owning a police scanner is legal, 
but you can only use it in certain ways. According to Florida State Statute 843.167(1)(a), you can be charged with a second-degree misdemeanor if:
 You use the scanner to listen to po-
lice communications while you com-mit another crime. You use the scanner to evade police 
after you commit another crime.Nathan Kenney, president of the UF 
chapter of SAE, said he was out of town Tuesday and did not know the details of the arrest. He had not made a deci-sion Wednesday night as to whether Sullivan would be punished.

Dick Clark, the American TV actor, pro-
ducer and icon who shepherded rock ‘n’ roll 
into mainstream culture, died Wednesday. He was 82 years old.
His spokesman said he died of a heart at-
tack.
Clark was best known among college 
students as the producer and host of “Dick Clark’s New Year’s Rockin’ Eve” and “Ameri-can Bandstand.” He also produced a variety of awards shows during his roughly 60-year career.
In 2004, Clark suffered a stroke that affected 
his ability to speak and walk, but he continued to perform.
Twenty-year-old journalism sophomore 
Alexa Gedigian said it will be hard to imagine New Year’s Eve without Clark.
“My parents and I have watched that al-
most every year since I can remember,” she said.
Other students echoed Gedigian’s senti-
ments.
Brittany Birsner, a 19-year-old business 
freshman, said she saw Clark’s gradual de-terioration, but she said his death was still a shock.
“I remember watch-
ing last New Year’s, and he was barely holding up 
talking,” she said.
She said New Year’s 
Eve won’t be the same without his personality.
Although Juan Zapata, 
a 19-year-old math fresh-man, didn’t know Clark 
by name, he was sad to hear the iconic face that rang in the New Year at Times Square died.
“I saw him every New Year, and I didn’t 
know what his name was until now,” he said.

TEACHES BAND AND CHORUS. 
TYLER JETT
Alligator Staff Writer
The Alachua County Sheriff’s Ofﬁ  ce 
arrested a middle school teacher who al-
legedly drove from Dunnellon to have sex with a 14-year-old Tuesday night.
Andrew O. Noell, 25, of Ocala, was 
charged with public order crimes and two counts of obscene communication. Noell teaches band, chorus, general music and piano at Dunnellon Middle School, ac-cording to the school’s website.
The Marion County School Board 
placed Noell on paid administrative leave Wednesday , spokesman Kevin Christian said. As a policy, the school board won’t ﬁ  re an arrested teacher until his or her case is closed. If it did let a teacher go and the charges against that teacher were dropped, Christian said, the school board could be sued.
Deputy William Patten started in-vestigating Noell as part of a “Don’t Play in Clay” undercover operation in Clay County . That operation ended at the beginning of this month, but accord-ing to an arrest report, Noell continued exchanging text messages with Patten, thinking the deputy was a 14-year-old girl’s guardian.
Noell asked Pat-
ten about the ﬁ  ctional girl’s sexual experi-ence and whether she would be able to perform certain sex acts, according to po-lice. He then agreed 
to meet the girl at an undisclosed location 
in Alachua County — Sheriff’s Ofﬁ  ce spokesman Sgt. Todd Kelly said the de-partment would not release the meeting spot.
Deputies brought Noell to the Sheriff’s 
Ofﬁ  ce, and he was arrested at about 8:30 p.m., Kelly said. Noell told deputies he thought he was meeting a 17-year-old.

Students graduating with com-
munications degrees are seeing a 
median starting salary of $40,022, compared to last year’s median of $38,549, according to the report.
Phil Allcott, a 22-year-old tele-
communication senior, said he has started searching for entry-level positions at production houses. 
Most of the salaries for the jobs 
he’s looked for are lower than the median.
“Salary does not play a role in 
my search,” he said. “It’s whether the job will offer good experience and a chance to forward my career and help me move up the ladder.”
Ja’Net Glover, associate direc-
tor for employer relations at the Career Resource Center, said there was a 15 percent increase for em-ployer attendance at career fairs and a 20 percent increase of em-ployer-student connections this year.
“I think students are becom-
ing more aware and realizing that you’re going to have to have expe-rience on your resume and prob-ably need to be more open and flexible to opportunities that are available,” she said.Salary not a 
priority for some studentsMICHAEL SCOTT DAVIDSON

On Wednesday evening, Angelique 
Perrin told about 120 protesters gathered 
at the Reitz Union Amphitheatre how she had been raped last year.
The 29-year-old Gainesville resident left 
Copper Monkey in Midtown before noon on July 5, ready to walk home. 
A stranger offered her a ride and she ac-
cepted. 
The man locked her in his car and took 
her to the former Windmeadows Trailer Park where he raped her.
“He seemed so damn normal,” she 
said. “Like anybody. He seemed like a nice guy.”
Perrin’s speech was part of the finale of 
UF’s Take Back the Night, an annual march and protest against sexual violence. 
The event was hosted by UF, STRIVE 
and the Alachua County Victim Services 
and Rape Crisis Center.
Ashley Cortez, the event organizer and 
a victim advocate counselor with the coun-
ty, said the event’s goal was to break the stigma of talking about sexual violence.
“People kind of have this idea that rape 
or sexual assault is a stranger that jumps out from the bush or follows them home at night,” she said. “This is not necessarily the case.”
According to the 2005 National Crime 
Victimization Study, approximately two-thirds of rapes were committed by some-one the victim knew.
The event started at Turlington Plaza, 
where participants created signs to carry during their march around the northeast part of campus and Sorority Row.
Among the marchers was Miriam Hill, 
the president of the Gainesville Roller Reb-els roller derby team. 
She was supporting a family member 
who was a victim of sexual assault and spoke up 16 years later.
“I respected her for having the strength 
to talk about it,” Hill said.
Loretta Golden, director of the Alachua 
County Victim Services and Rape Crisis Center, said similar events have been held in Gainesville since she began working for the county in 1982.
“UF has been a leader in providing that 
kind of opportunity to survivors,” she said.THURSDAY, APRIL 19, 2012 � ALLIGATOR, 5

Today’s question: Do you have a job after graduation? 
178 TOTAL VOTES95% YES
5% NOWednesday’s question: Do you always 
wear your seat belt in the car?Students should take time to stop, ‘marvel’
In many ways, Spring semester has been my most im-
portant one so far at UF. This semester will always be remembered as the time I had my existential crisis 
— where every action I performed was basked in this vague notion that I was following an empty path. I was troubled by the meaning of life.
I used to be “that guy” obsessed with going to law 
school, with becoming “successful” in the traditional sense and with climbing the ladder of my own ambition. No longer. Within the course of a week, things I once found obvious became unclear. The concrete steps of my ambition faded away.
I abruptly disabused myself of the notion that becom-
ing a lawyer meant performing the tasks on shows like “Law and Order.” I began to realize that the eventual path I would take actually meant slaving away for hun-dreds of hours every month, writing legal briefs and reading countless pages of arbitrary case law.
And “the law” became just that — arbitrary, a man-
made creation. I asked myself, what was the law but ran-dom rules conceived by society? Was there fundamental truth? Everything I had ever wanted to do in life became plagued by the questions: What does it mean? Will this bring me the best possible life I can live?
What caused all this fuss, you might ask?Two distinct events caused the change that will go, 
frustratingly to readers, I’m sure, unexplained in this column. As dramatic as it sounds, those events forced me to re-examine my entire reason for existing.
Students (myself included) often have lofty goals of 
changing the world that are encouraged by our parents and professors. However, the cynical truth behind this encouragement is the depressing fact that most of us will end up hating our work. Fifty-five percent of Ameri-cans, to be exact, are unsatisfied at their jobs. That’s the amount of Americans who perhaps never asked them-selves these fundamental questions.
And so, here we are. Society has become the most in-debt, addicted, obese, medicat-ed adult cohort in U.S. history. Families return home from jobs they hate to their boxy subur -
ban neighborhoods, plop down on the couch and stare at the numbing glow of a television screen for hours before taking a sleeping pill so they can avoid the torture of their regrets keep-
ing them awake at night.
Billboards on the side of the road scream reassur -
ance at us that whatever we’re doing is OK. We bury our noses in our iPhones and plug in our earphones to escape. We humans continue to find ever more creative ways to bombard our senses, seeking some sort of ful-fillment. Dazzling lights flash downtown while we con-sume numbing amounts of alcohol and drugs, all while music blasts in our ears.
But here I am asking these questions: What does it all 
mean? What is truly important? I’m afraid I don’t have the answers, but I do think they lie somewhere in na-ture. Which is why it became my new goal to buy a 30-foot sailboat and travel the world with the person I love. Which is why, along with my revelations about meaning, the idea came to me that living and existing as a sentient being on this planet is overwhelmingly rapturous.
Take a moment to let that idea detonate in your mind. 
Take a moment to realize that being alive is such an incredible wonder, that the very idea of you taking a breath is breathtaking. Take a moment to unplug your headphones, stop texting and notice the newly born os-prey chirping from above or the welcome smokiness of a distant forest fire.
Take a moment to ask the right questions and mar -
vel.
Garrett Bruno is a political science sophomore at UF. His 
column appears on Thursdays.Campaign Conundrum
SG codes vague about 
‘campaigning’
In Wednesday’s editorial, we discussed some potential 
problems with the language of Student Government elec-tion codes.
Specifically, we looked at code 762.0, which requires that 
all campaign material or all print and electronic material pro-moting a candidate or political party must bear the phrase “Registered Political Advertisement.”
This obviously has some troubling implications for free 
speech, but another code also deserves scrutiny.
Election code 761.1 states, “Campaigning begins on the 
first day of the active election cycle.” The election cycle begins on the fourth Tuesday prior to the first day of elections.
In election code 700.4, campaigning is defined as “any in-
tentional action in support of, or in opposition to, a candidate or political party for an elective student body office, includ-ing, but not limited to the distribution of literature and post-ing of materials.”
It does not include wearing T-shirts or buttons, “unless ac-
companied by the dissemination of campaign literature or the delivery of a campaign speech to solicit support for a candi-date or political party.”
While election code 761.1 does not state that campaign-
ing “cannot” occur prior to the active election cycle, does this code imply that student senators, potential candidates and members of SG political parties are prohibited from perform-ing any action that supports or opposes a candidate or party before this “election cycle” begins?
If that is the case, the implications of this code for free 
speech are just as troubling as the code we discussed yester-day.
Students who want to represent the Student Body in SG 
should be allowed to openly discuss these issues at any point in the semester. They should be allowed to declare and start promoting themselves whenever they want.
When students campaign for SG, they are hopefully not 
just saying, “Vote for me.” They are spreading awareness of campus issues, proposing solutions and promoting the idea that students should have a voice when it comes to how our campus should grow.
These actions should not be relegated to a specific period 
of time. Instead, they should be promoted as a regular occur-rence on campus.
Of course, there can be limits on the ability of parties to set 
up tables and berate students with fliers; this is still a univer -
sity with functions other than student politics.
However, the language of the current codes creates a chill-
ing effect on almost all SG-related speech.
While trying to curtail corruption and fraud is noble, these 
codes attempt to do so at the expense of free speech and open discussion.
We ask members of SG to find less draconian ways of en-
couraging a fair, but open, election process.

In a city that’s best known for 
jorts, it’s hard to believe that five 
days of the calendar year are filled with flashing lights, high heels and hot fashion — with minimal denim in sight.
At Gainesville Fashion Week’s 
Saturday runway shows, about 300 fashion fans and style sup-porters dressed to impress at Villa East to watch as seven designers showcased their creations on the catwalk.
Upon walking into the building, 
it was easy to tell that the staff of Gainesville Fashion Week put a lot of effort into their fifth season. The bright lights that framed the stage were shining on the white runway as attendees grabbed drinks and snagged spots to watch the show while West Palm Beach rapper Will Brennan entertained.
Like any real fashion show, the 
front row seated the celebrities — or as well-known as one can get liv-ing in a town that revolves around sports teams.  Unfortunately, Anna Wintour wasn’t present, but Gator basketball players (and apparent fashionistos) Patric Young and Will Yeguete were.
Young wore a long-sleeved 
white Polo shirt with matching white-framed sunglasses that didn’t leave his face all night, and Yeguete looked chic in a grey short-sleeved button up with thick black-rimmed glasses with clear lenses. Both sported shiny silver blinged-out, large-faced watches on their left wrists as oohs and aahs came from spectators shocked at their presence.
After everyone settled into the 
room, first up was AJNEL designs, whose collection reflected a mod-ern Victorian style with high neck-lines and collars, ruffled details and draped construction. A mix of classic whites and golds were paired with bold floral prints in a cohesive collection that left the au-dience with a taste for more.
Whitley Denise’s 14-look show 
followed, opening with an aqua long-sleeved kimono style jacket paired with a black bikini top, leopard headwrap, floral fishnet tights and, dare I say it — a jort.  Despite adding to the stigma that is Gainesville fashion, the online vintage retailer showed off a col-lection that was fun and bold, but also classic and wearable — shoul-der pads and all.  
Sabor Latino brought the heat 
with a burlesque-inspired routine that was perfectly choreographed for the runway. Dancers moved and grooved effortlessly around each other on a stage that was no wider than 4 feet, impressing and entertaining the audience with their energy.
Off the high of Sabor Latino’s 
performance came Zella Machado Swimwear. With 23 looks, Bruna Santana didn’t fool around when it came to accentuating assets with her bathing suit line. Everyone took notice of the lack of fabric, in-cluding Young and Yeguete, who seemed to be on booty patrol, star-ing and commenting to each other throughout the show.  
Regardless of the scandalous 
sizes of some of the pieces, each suit was incredibly fun and flirty with lots of neon colors, perfect for the Gator girls and guys who would wear them. An emerald-green, high-waisted two-piece suit stole the show for me (and if the designer is reading this, I need that bathing suit now) with thin straps along the hips, matching the strap detailing across the chest of the bandeau top.
Following the bright bathing 
suit line was Leemari Designs. The looks being sent down the run-way weren’t exactly high-fashion. Loose-fitting tank tops and T-shirts with phrases like “Live to Inspire” and “Lose a Dream, Lose a Life” were paired with leggings and shorts. Though I appreciate the in-spirational message the designers have, the collection was bland and left me bored, which didn’t transi-tion well to the intermission that followed.
During the break between run-
way shows, musical act Pop Glow performed as guests refueled with more drinks from the bar. Over the chatter of attendees, the pop-electronic group performed songs that sounded as if Metro Station and Daft Punk had a musical love child. Even though no one was paying attention, the boys tried to maintain high energy in the room until the next designer took the stage.
Jacquelyn Brooks Designs  
followed the intermission, start-ing her show with school spirit by playing the infamous Gator chomp music matched with fun orange and blue gameday dresses on the catwalk. After the dresses came her ready-to-wear and formal wear looks, which were filled with animal prints, bright pops of color and an abundance of texture.
After watching her show, I 
could see why Brooks was contact-ed by both “Project Runway” and “Fashion Star.” Her use of shiny golds with bright pops of red was perfectly paired with neutral col-ors, which kept her collection ex-citing, but not too over-the-top in sharply constructed silhouettes.  
 Designs from Southern Frock  
followed with feminine sundresses and colorful cover-ups. The pieces were mostly solid colors, but the fabric used had a subtle coral pat-tern, which really added to the beachy feeling of the collection.
Anticipation built in the crowd 
as DJ Klarc Shepard spun music that had the whole room dancing. The crowd almost got an impromp-tu dance performance from Gator basketball players Young and Yeg-uete, until co-hosts Maghan Mc-Dowell, Insite Gainesville editor, and Tiffany Williams, Gainesville Fashion Week producer, returned to the stage to introduce headlin-ing designer, Mikho Resort.
Only one word can be used to 
sum up the final designs to grace the runway: sexy.  The collection was previewed by a short film that gave the audience a taste of the raw and racy resortwear to come. Everyone felt the room get a few degrees hotter as topless guys in short shorts and females in sexy bikinis had the whole room cheer-ing.
Tank tops with provocative 
sayings like “Occupy My Pants” and “Bad Ass Mother F—ker” topped the few models who were given coverups. As the models ap-proached the end of the runway, they radiated heat as they struck flirtatious poses for the cameras.
The spicy final runway show 
ended the night with a bang. As the audience left Villa East ready to continue the fun at Sharab Lounge for the afterparty, I left with the de-sire to go shopping — a true sign of a successful fashion event.

I’m going to graduate in less than a month, which is scary , 
but it’s not the subject of this column. Because everyone likes 
to talk about themselves and tell other people how to live their lives, including this paper, I’m going to tell you what I’ve actu-ally learned here at UF without any weird advice about where to poop (OK, fine. Here’s one: Do it at home like a normal per -
son).
Be wary of any professor that assigns a book he or she 
wrote.
Read the syllabus. Then take a break for a semester. You de-
serve it, buddy — you just read a whole syllabus.
Cheap beer tastes the best. Unless your friend is buying, in 
which case you should get something nicer.Sometimes your classmates don’t know what they’re talk-
ing about. Sometimes the professor doesn’t know what he or she is talking about. I always know what I’m talking about.  
Accent will host at least one show you will have a test dur -
ing. It will probably be a show you want to go to.
It is impossible to walk to class without seeing someone you 
went to high school with.

The Great White Way has a knack for turn-
ing films of the past into contemporary mu-
sical showstoppers. But as of late, more and more of these crossovers have sounded more flat than resonant with audiences. 
Yet with pure emotional force, the folksy 
love story that is “Once” has transcended the screen and established itself on the stage.Following in the footsteps of other Off-
Broadway-turned-mainstage productions such as “RENT” and “Spring Awakening,” the drastic importance of the music (and the emotions it houses) is what makes a show like “Once” stand out. Each of these three produc-tions rely heavily on the cacophony of emo-tional representation that the music brings to life. Whether it be sadness or joy , hope or despair, every possible feeling has a tune or a beat, and it permeates every inch of the score.
However, while the former two now mega-
popular Broadway shows created movies (and subsequent stars) of their own, “Once” is taking a backwards approach, using an al-ready-beloved indie film as its inspiration to enlighten audiences.
The heart-tugging love story between an 
Irish song man and a Czech immigrant woman was first seen on screen in 2007 under the di-rection of John Carney . Spanning the course of a week in the streets of Dublin, the plot centers on the duo writing and rehearsing songs that tell their love story . With music by the film’s stars, Glen Hansard and Marketa Irglova, the film won an Academy Award for Best Origi-nal Song (“Falling Slowly”) in 2008. Gaining notoriety in the Oscar aftermath, Broadway director John Tiffany came on board to bring “Once” to the stage and the transformation from stage to screen set off from there.
With the original trio of Carney, Hansard 
and Irglova’s work intact, the cast of the staged version shows individuals with just as much musical heart as that which made the film so powerful to begin with. Stepping in Hansard and Irglova’s roles as “Guy” and “Girl” are Steve Kazee and Cristin Milioti, accenting the dual roles with just as much soulful emotion as the original pair.

Leave anything on stage, and the 
guys of Enter Shikari will climb it. 
They’ll climb speakers, tall or short. They’ll climb the stage’s support beams. At almost every show, they climb over barricades, diving into crowds of their fans.
Playing live doesn’t stop the post-
hardcore, genre-bending English quartet members from kicking their legs up to bouncing and gritty elec-tronics. Hit the cymbals, and Enter Shikari jumps across stage, maybe giving their heads and instruments whiplash.
“Some days I’ll just be dead 
to the world,” vocalist Roughton “Rou” Reynolds said. The band has off-days; they aren’t machines. And then some days I’m like a newborn rabbit running around the stage.”Without energy or sleep, it’s hard 
to not give it their all, Reynolds 
said.
Two weeks ago, 
Enter Shikari trav-eled thousands of miles to embark on its first headlining North American tour with fellow 
bands letlive. and At The Skylines.
In three weeks, Florida audiences will get a taste of their insanity with four tour dates: May 9 at St. Peters-burg’s State Theatre, May 10 at Pom-pano Beach’s Rocketown, May 11 at Jacksonville’s Jack Rabbits and May 12 at Orlando’s The Social.
Though Enter Shikari (vocal-
ist/programmer Reynolds, guitarist Liam “Rory” Clewlow, bassist Chris Batten, drummer Rob Rolfe) formed in 2003, most U.S. tours included supporting roles with 25- to 30-min-ute sets. Now, they get a chance to dish out more songs in longer sets.
“So many people have been 
begging for a proper Shikari set,” Reynolds said. “Picking the set list is still incredibly hard, having three albums now, but it’s wild.”
Enter Shikari released its third al-
bum, “A Flash Flood of Colour,” in January to worldwide praise.

Most freshman class projects end up in a 
dorm room trash bin or, at best, are saved deep 
in the ranks of a computer file that will never be looked at again.
But for then-freshman Julie Seifert, it proved 
impossible to forget her class project. She was stuck with the characters she conjured up for an assignment as part of her Writing for Young Adult Fiction class at the University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill.
Three years, countless edits and about 70,000 
words later, the characters Seifert couldn’t shake turned into her first novel, “Cardboard Characters,” which tells the story of Leah, a girl who is cast as the lead for a high school play against her wishes.
Now a fourth-year English major at UF, Se-
ifert, who transferred from UNC-Chapel Hill after her freshman year, has put “Cardboard Characters” up for sale on Amazon.com and barnesandnoble.com.
Since the early March online release of the 
book, “Cardboard Characters” has been pur -
chased more than 30 times. That’s about 30 people Seifert has managed to reach on her own — no agent, no publishing house, no wast-ed paper, just Seifert.
The online community is already buzzing 
about the book. About 30 people have added “Cardboard Characters” to their to-read list on goodreads.com, a social networking site for book-lovers, after popular young-adult book blogger Laura from the blog “My Enchanted Bookshelf” gave it a rating of “simply delec-table.”
“Reading the book was like reading a note 
or a journal entry that she’d written and let me have a peek at. It’s witty and engaging and keeps you rooted to your seat, wanting to keep reading no matter what else demands your at-tention,” wrote Laura in her review of “Card-board Characters.”
Seifert has also managed to garner some 
publicity for her novel through her blog, ju-lie999.blogspot.com, which has gained an audi-ence of about 200 visitors per day in less than nine months.
She began blogging in late August 2011, and 
though at first the blog was just a side project, Seifert’s witty remarks about college life, pop culture and young adult books began attracting visitors from all over the world, from the U.S. to Mexico to Bratislava, Slovakia.  
“Julie’s Blog,” as she named it, is not the ste-
reotypical literary blog, filled with entry upon entry dissecting the themes of great contempo-rary works of fiction; it’s brazenly fun, much like Seifert herself.
“Julie has a complete originality and un-
apologetic nature toward liking otherwise-scorned-by-the-elite-liberal-arts-student things like Britney Spears and modern young-adult fiction,” said Caitlin Davis, former president of the UF English Society and UF alumna. “In fact, I can’t tell you how many times she and I have spammed each other with links to our favorite Britney Spears music videos.”
But behind the Britney Spears fan, the girl 
who has been known to belt out what her friend and “Cardboard Characters” cover designer Adam Jalali calls a “pretty mean ’90s pop song” is a committed, aspiring writ-er.
While writing her novel, 
Seifert transferred univer -
sities, acquired and lost a deal with a literary agent and went through a stressful graduate-school application process, but she never stopped writing.
“Julie has been through an incredible up-
and-down journey with this novel.  She has stuck by her writing the entire time,” said her good friend and University of Southern Cali-fornia senior Aly Owen, who met Seifert at a creative writer’s workshop in the summer of 2007.  
Although she’ll be attending the UNC 
School of Information and Library Science in the fall in hopes of pursuing a career as a librar -
ian, Seifert knows she’ll always be writing.
“Not to be really cheesy, but I just never con-
sidered stopping,” she said. “It just seems too depressing.”10, ALLIGATOR §  THURSDAY, APRIL 19, 2012

In today’s digital society, music is mostly bought on-
line and instantly downloaded, ready to be listened to im-mediately. Despite this exploding trend, there’s another form of music that’s still alive and growing.  
On April 21, local Gainesville record stores Hear Again 
Music and Movies!, Wayward Council and toneVendor will participate in the fifth annual Record Store Day, a cel-ebration of independent music retailers across the nation.
On Record Store Day, about 700 record stores nation-
wide and hundreds of other retailers and music support-ers across the world will come together for the celebration of music and vinyl, said Brittany Brave, a college mar -
keting representative for Sony Music Entertainment in Gainesville.
“This day gives huge support to developing artists, 
music labels and the fans,” Brave said. “Record stores and independent retailers are hubs for music, so it’s important to celebrate what they do in the community.”
This year, Sony will release 25 limited-edition records, 
like the 25th anniversary edition of Paul Simon’s album “Graceland,” which will only be released for Record Store Day, Brave said.
“By releasing exclusive records — that’s the label’s 
way of supporting small indie stores,” Brave said.
Andrew Schaer, the owner of Hear Again Music and Movies!, said he ordered everything he could from the list of Record Store Day limited-edition releases after having an extremely successful Record Store Day in 2011.
“Last year we got bombarded, so this year I figured I’d 
double the inventory and go all out,” Schaer said. “Every-one is just really looking forward to it. The people come out and are in really great spirits, and it’s a lot of fun.”
Record Store Day also helps to boost business, Schaer 
said. Distributors and artists put out exclusive, special al-bums, and there may be only a couple hundred or 1,000 of a particular record.
They’re extremely limited, and people want those ti-
tles.
Schaer said record sales were up 25 percent in the past 
year, and it’s the only tangible, real-life medium that’s been increasing while CD sales have decreased, showing that vinyl is by no means a dying trend.
There’s a huge audience of people tired of listening to 
MP3s, Schaer said. They’ve replaced their CD collection with hard drives, and now the music is so compressed that when they hear something in its purest form, it’s an eye-opening experience.
Jack Case, a volunteer at Wayward Council, said he 
likes vinyl because it forces the listener to enjoy the entire record, so the album can breathe.
“I can appreciate it as a whole piece of music, unlike 
MP3s, which has just created singles and has spurred making playlists of hit songs,” Case said.
In the punk community, Case said, vinyl has never 
left.
Most new music and do-it-yourself musicians use the 
record format, so Record Store Day is great for raising awareness that vinyl isn’t a novelty or dying format. It’s a fun, good-sounding medium that’s still around, he said.
The other appeal is that vinyl tends to hold more value, 
said Brian Liska, another volunteer at Wayward Council. People throw CDs around in their cars, but they can’t throw a record into the player — they have to be very delicate, carefully lifting the lever and making sure that the needle doesn’t scratch.
“Record Store Day is going to be an all-day party and 
hangout session,” Liska said. “We’re going to bring out our top-sellers and have a concert with Scum of the Earth and Ironing and just have fun.”
The hopes for Record Store Day are to increase sales, 
bring in more people for events and promote Wayward Council as a place to hang out as well as a community space, Liska said.
“The main thing we want to let people know [is] that 
there’s still music out there that holds tradition to the old-er roots,” Liska said. “It’s not going away anytime soon.”Record Store Day, April 21, reminds the world of vinyl
“Record Store Day is going to be an all-day 
party and hangout session. We’re going to bring 
out our top-sellers and have a concert with Scum 
of the Earth and Ironing and just have fun.”

Florida has won four of its last 
five games to rise out of a mid-
season slump, but bigger news could be coming. 
After Tuesday night’s game, 
UF coach Kevin O’Sullivan ad-dressed a few of the injuries that plagued his team during a recent lull. 
They included where sopho-
more pitcher Karsten Whitson stands on getting back to form, when junior Hudson Randall will return to the mound and where freshman third baseman Josh To-bias is in recovering from a bro-ken bone in his hand. “We’re slowly but surely get-
ting healthy,” O’Sullivan said. 
No area of the team is looking 
forward to a return to full health more than starting pitching. With Randall sidelined for the past two weeks, the Gators have been without their reliable Friday night inning-eater who saves the bullpen. 
Florida has walked more bat-
ters (six) in its last two series openers than Randall has in sev-en starts this season (three). 
In those two games, five differ -
ent relievers have had to account for nine innings of work, an issue the Gators typically don’t have to deal with when Randall is on the mound.
Randall was first held out of 
action in the LSU series when O’Sullivan announced he had a “tired arm.” After further evalu-ation, he sat out the Tennessee series but now appears to be a probable starter for Sunday’s game against Georgia. 
“He threw a [bullpen session 
Tuesday] and looked great,” O’Sullivan said. “He feels great. He’s pain-free.”
Whitson has been back from 
injury for a couple of weeks, but  he has yet to find the right arm that once made him a No. 9 over -
all Major League Baseball draft pick and a preseason All-Ameri-can. 
Whitson has given up eight 
hits, six runs and hit four batters

Throughout this season, Kytra Hunter has thrived on the 
big stage.
Three of the freshman all-around competitor’s four best 
scores have come at the Southeastern Conference Champi-
onships (39.625) and against Georgia (39.675) and Alabama (39.45), Florida’s most heated rivals. 
But Friday will serve as a whole different challenge for 
Hunter. 
When No. 1 seed Florida competes in the evening session 
of the NCAA Championships, she will experience for the first time an environment where the Gators have historically struggled to capture a national title. 
Despite the pressure, she remains composed as always. “I’m treating it like any other meet,” Hunter said. “Hav-
ing that mindset is what’s calming me. If I start thinking about na-tionals and Super Six, I think I’ll get ahead of myself.”
At the SEC Championships on March 24, she performed 
well in The Arena at Gwinnett Center in Duluth. 
In that meet, Hunter’s 39.625 helped her snag the all-
around title. That afternoon, she also picked up the vault win (9.975).
Hunter is the Gators’ first SEC All-Around Champion 
since Kristen Guise in 1995 and the first UF freshman to win the title since Elfi Schlegel in 1983.
“That’s a pretty stressful stage with those teams and she 
did exceptional,” coach Rhonda Faehn said. “I have no doubt she’ll do exactly the same with the same focus, same energy into the national championship.”
Two weeks after one of the most dynamic performances of 
her collegiate career, Hunter followed with an average show-ing at regionals. 
In Raleigh, N.C., on April 7, she recorded a 39.25 after 
posting a 9.8 on uneven bars and touching the balance beam UF, Hunter confident

The Gators didn’t look like a 
team that was missing much.
In consecutive games, they 
handled Fresno State in a shutout 
and defeated 10th-ranked Penn State 20-11.
But they won those games 
playing without arguably the most important player on their roster: Kitty Cullen.
In her two games since return-ing from a concussion suffered at Ohio State on March 24, the junior attacker has not showed any lingering effects, scoring a combined nine goals in wins over Johns Hopkins and Vanderbilt.
Even though Cullen missed 
two games recovering from the head injury, she believes the time off helped her in other ways.
“With being out, I was able 
to get like a break for my body and everything,” Cullen said. “I just came back even more excited since I had been out.”
The Gators will look for Cul-
len to continue her dominant 
play when No. 4 UF visits top-
ranked, unde-feated North-western on Saturday for the American Lacrosse Con-ference regular-
season championship.
Coach Amanda O’Leary said much of Cullen’s success in the last two games can be attributed to improved shot selection. Prior to her concussion, Cullen found the back of the net on 39.7 percent of her of shots. In the last two games, she has scored nine goals on 16 shots, a success rate of 56.3 percent.
“When she actually thinks 
about her shot, she can be un-stoppable,” O’Leary said. “When Kitty runs into trouble is when she doesn’t think about her shot, and she just throws it at the net.”
The increased attention Cul-
len has received from opposing defenses this season has led to a drop in her goal-scoring rate but a significant increase in her assist totals from 2011.
Through the first 14 games 
of the 2011 season, Cullen had recorded 67 goals and 6 assists. This year, she is second on the team in scoring with 38 goals and 
Florida benefitting from healthy Cullen’s ability on attack

UF tight endis tied for the team lead with 
20 assists through as many games.
“Kitty is always going to 
attract your opponent’s best defender,” O’Leary said. “It allows some of the other defenders to get the second, third, fourth defender down the line.”
The Wildcats like to play 
a high-pressure defense that quickly double teams whichever attacker has the ball. Thus, Cullen’s ability to quickly decide whether or not to beat the trap or find an open teammate will be vital to the Gators’ success on Sat-urday.
“I am getting doubled re-
ally early, sometimes even triple teamed earlier than I was last year, so we’re able to find more people who are open and wide-open goals,” Cullen said.
Fellow junior attacker 
Ashley Bruns said having Cullen back on the field has provided the team with a much-needed emotional lift.
“It makes us so much 
more confident as a whole,” said Bruns. “I don’t think any defender can stop Kitty.”(9.6). Still, she recorded a 
9.95 on floor exercise to win the event title. 
“I did mess up my (beam) 
series a little bit at regionals,” Hunter said. “I was thinking about finishing and moving on before actually finishing the skill. I kind of got ahead of myself.”
But the one aspect of 
Hunter’s freshman cam-paign that has inspired her teammates is her ability to rebound quickly from mis-takes.  
“Kytra’s done so well 
throughout the season, be-coming more of a team play-er and understanding col-legiate gymnastics,” junior Marissa King said. “She’s re-ally grown.  
“I don’t think [the team’s 
freshmen are] going to struggle this weekend be-cause we’ve spoken about it. They’re excited and they’re ready.”
When No. 1 seed Florida 
returns to Duluth this week-end, three of its five oppo-nents — Alabama, Arkansas and Georgia — will be SEC foes. 
In a sense, the NCAA 
semifinals will almost be a rematch of the SEC Champi-onships. 
“It’s great motivation that 
we’ve won before,” Hunter said. “But like I said, it’s a new meet, new day. 
“All of the girls have the 
same mindset that we want to win, but we’re all staying humble as a team. I think that’s what’s helping us stay on top.”16, ALLIGATOR � THURSDAY, APRIL 19, 2012

Florida attacker Kitty Cullen takes a shot against Vanderbilt on April 14. 
Cullen has scored nine goals since returning from a concussion.
Cullen has notched career-high 20 assists
LAX , from page 15Freshman Tobias close to return from broken bone in hand
in comparison to two strikeouts 
in his two starts since what he called a “rehab outing” in a vic-tory against North Florida on April 3. 
Because of Whitson’s strug-
gles, O’Sullivan gave him his first-career relief appearance Tuesday night, a one-inning out-ing. 
Whitson retired three batters 
in eight pitches, squeezing a mid-90s fastball, a solid slider and a right-on-right changeup into the brief opportunity.
“It was a little different (see-
ing Whitson come out of the bull-pen),” senior right-hander Greg Larson said. “He looked good, though.” 
The Gators are down to their third option at third base, where junior Cody Dent has been fill-
ing in for Tobias 
since March 23. 
Dent is on 
a career-high three-game hit streak, but that cannot erase the fact he is batting .164 this season. 
Tobias, at .250, is toward the bottom of the team in average like Dent, but the freshman was coming on strong before his in-jury. 
Tobias was hitting .368 in the 
seven games leading up to his injury and was moving past the early freshman jitters. 
He was also reliable on the 
base paths. 
Tobias scored five of the eight 
times he got on base during the aforementioned seven-game stretch. 
Although he entered Satur -
day’s game as a pinch runner, Tobias has more waiting to do, whether he likes it or not. 
“He thinks he’s ready this 
weekend,” O’Sullivan said. 
“I doubt that. I think realisti-
cally Arkansas weekend (April 27-29) or Kentucky (May 3-5), somewhere in there.”
