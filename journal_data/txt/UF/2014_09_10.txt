Gainesville stores are sold out 
of pepper spray and rape whistles 
following a string of four attacks 
on and around UF’s campus since 
Aug. 30.
The Target on Archer Road is 
completely sold out of self-defense 
tools. The Walmart Supercenter on Northeast 12th Avenue is also sold out, as are the ones on Archer 
Road and Southwest 13th Street. Hibbett Sports on Archer Road is sold out as well.
There is still pepper spray in 
stock at the M&C Army Surplus store on Northwest 13th Street.
But as students scour store 
shelves for the tools, Tina Lamb was cautious of relying on weap-
ons for self-defense.
The Rape Aggression Defense 
program coordinator said it per-
petuates the underlying message 
“you’re not enough.”
RAD courses do not utilize 
weapons but instead teach physi-
cal defense tactics.
“Your body is an amazing tool,” Lamb said.
Though the RAD program is 
booked until the beginning of No-vember, other local programs are offering self-defense classes open 
to beginners.
Tool Shed Training and Kissaki-
Kai Florida are hosting ﬁ  ve-week 
strength and self-defense classes, beginning Friday from 5:45 to 7 p.m. at the Uniﬁ  ed Training Cen-
ter.
Gainesville Dojo, a martial arts 
center located at 536 SW Second 
Ave., typically offers free self-de-
fense classes once a semester. The 
classes take place over the course of two days, each class being three hours, said owner Keith Teller.Local stores run out of self-defense weapon stock

Dressed in neon vests and armed with Walkie Talkies, 
10 male students stood around a table at the University 
Police Department Tuesday evening, awaiting directions 
from the ofﬁ  cers.
About 100 people were escorted Monday in the ﬁ  rst 
night of the Safe Walk program, which was created in re-
sponse to recent attacks on and around campus.
The nightly program includes student volunteers in 
teams of two to be stationed by Southwest Recreation Center, Library West, Marston Science Library, Broward Dining Center, the Reitz Union and the Hub.
Students can call 392-SNAP to dispatch a volunteer to 
walk with them. Students can also approach the vested volunteers, who are encouraged to solicit help. Most of the escorts were self-initiated, UPD Capt. Jeff Holcomb said.
Shifts run from 7:30 to 11:30 p.m. and 11 p.m. to 3 a.m.

ety, ROTC and Humans versus Zombies are some of the

� SIX STUDENTS OF 422 DIDN’T SLATE WITH 
SWAMP PARTY.
ARIANA FIGUEROA 
Alligator Staff Writer
The ﬁ  nal day to register as a candidate for a UF Student Sen-
ate seat ofﬁ  cially ended at 5 p.m. Tuesday.
A total of 422 students qualiﬁ  ed since Student Government 
began the interviewing process Sunday in the Reitz Union 
Grand Ballroom, said UF Supervisor of Elections Hans Rojas. 
After an initially slow turnout with a record-low 11 applicants Sunday, 350 students registered on Tuesday alone.
Of those who qualiﬁ  ed, 416 slated with the Swamp Party, 
the sole majority party. The remaining candidates, as well as those who were selected for the Swamp Party’s slate, have until 
the end of a mandatory meeting Wednesday at 9 p.m. in the Reitz Auditorium to slate with a party or run as an indepen-dent candidate.
Ofﬁ  cial Swamp Party candidates will be notiﬁ  ed by late 
Tuesday night, said Swamp Party spokeswoman Katie Back-strand.
Aside from the Swamp Party, four other political parties 
registered with the supervisor of elections: Unite Party, Keg Party, Pants Party and Greek-Frat Party.Backstrand said the Swamp Party had no afﬁ  liation with the 
Unite Party, which was a majority party in 2012.
“The Unite Party and Swamp Party are two different 
things,” she said.
The Keg Party, which was registered by 19-year-old UF 
management and history sophomore Andrew Diamond, was named by Diamond’s friend. He said the party is still working on its platform as well as ﬁ  nding candidates for its slate.
“We didn’t have the time to campaign this year,” Diamond 
said.
The Greek-Frat Party president could not be reached for 
comment. Pants Party president Matthew Epstein and Unite Party President Adam Samei declined to comment.Vast majority of student candidates slate with Swamp PartySEE WALK, PAGE 4News Today

Nancy Chrystal-Green, director of 
Student Activities and Involvement, 
said Safe Walk expects to have an average of seven teams of two volun-
teers for each shift.
“The idea came from all of these 
different entities,” Chrystal-Green 
said. “We asked, ‘What don’t we 
have?’ The missing link was the op-
tion to walk someone to another building or to their car.”
Holcomb and UPD Sgt. Jeffrey 
Lamb told the volunteers that their 
job is not to subdue anything but to 
be the eyes and ears of campus. They will also be expected to notify dis-patch and keep track of whom they 
are walking, when and where.
“There has been great feedback,” Chrystal-Green said. “People were 
so appreciative to see the presence of 
these people willing to help.”
Members of the Interfraternity 
Council make up most of the volun-
teers.
Charles Render, a 21-year-old 
UF information systems senior and member of Alpha Epsilon Pi Frater-nity, said he signed up to volunteer Thursday night through an email 
sent from his chapter president.
“It’s a great idea,” he said. “We’re 
all getting involved and helping stu-
dents.”
The program will continue as long 
as there is need, Chrystal-Green said, and it will continue tweaking loca-tions in each shift to meet demands.
“It’s about students helping stu-
dents,” she said.4, ALLIGATOR � WEDNESDAY, SEPTEMBER 10, 2014

Jazz Ambassadors of the U.S. Army Field Band perform Tuesday night in the Phillips Center.

Sgt. Maj. Kevin Watt started 
playing the trumpet 41 years ago.  
He now performs with the Jazz 
Ambassadors U.S. Army Field 
Band. 
Watt performed at the Curtis 
M. Phillips Center for the Perform-ing Arts Tuesday night with the Jazz Ambassadors U.S. Army Field Band.
The official touring big band of 
the U.S. Army showcased its eclec-tic repertoire, including big band swing and contemporary jazz, to a packed theater.“We always have a great audi-
ence in Gainesville,” Watt said.
Jazz listeners ranging from stu-
dents to elderly couples made it 
through the evening rain and at-
tended the free show.
“My cousin is a part of the Ma-
rine Corps, but that’s not the only reason I came,” said Giselle Zamo-
rano, a 32-year-old Santa Fe Col-
lege third-year entrepreneurship student. “I just love jazz, especially 
the wind instruments.”
Formed in 1969, the jazz ensem-
ble has performed in all 50 states 
and in international jazz festivals.
The 90-minute performance 
Tuesday included patriotic pieces like “God Bless the USA” and end-ed with a salute to all veterans and their family members.
“I have toured with other groups 
outside the Army in the past, but never with such a singular vision of performing for the American 
public,” said band guitarist Staff

Alexandra Webel can’t step out of her 
apartment at night without being afraid of 
what might lie in the dark.
For Webel, a 21-year-old UF mathematics 
and statistics senior, the fear of a predator at large follows her home. 
“Ever since the attacks started happening, 
my safety and peace of mind have been the most important thing to me,” she said. “I’m 
worried to even walk out to my car at night 
because there are so many dark areas around where I live.”
On- and-off campus residences are trying 
to qualm Webel’s and many other students’ fears by sending out emails emphasizing per-sonal safety. 
Gainesville Police spokesman Officer Ben Tobias said the department has reached out 
to neighboring apartment complexes that 
surround the university.
“We manage a crime prevention office,” 
he said. “Those folks are handing out printed materials and sending out emails to every apartment company they can. They’re also visiting as many places as they can.”
While GPD does not have enough officers 
to station at apartment complexes around Gainesville, Tobias said the department is carrying out roving patrols at all hours of the 
day.
“We want people to be aware of their surroundings and to be on the lookout,” he said. 
But the concern hits closer to home for 
students living on campus after four female 
students were attacked. 
Sharon Blansett, assistant to the associate 
vice president for UF Student Affairs, wrote in an email that the housing security staff is reaching out to all on-campus residents walk-ing alone at night.
“All housing staff routinely monitor their 
work locations for suspicious activity and reinforce safety education messages to resi-dents,” she said. “During enhanced educa-
tion/outreach times like now, they more 
assertively and more visibly complete these actions.”
UF Housing and Residence Education of-
fers security staff patrols near dorms from 10 
p.m. to 4 a.m. and provides escorts to resi-dents walking at night.
Security staffers are also distributing re-
source cards that have the Student Nighttime 
Auxiliary Patrol, UPD and Housing Security phone numbers, along with safety tips to resi-
dents.
Max Borg, a 20-year-old UF nursing junior, 
said he keeps himself and his female friends 
safe when staying late on campus. 
“It’s just all about how you can keep 
yourself safe,” Borg said. “Walk in pairs, call your roommates or your friends and let them know where you are.” 
Webel is taking precautions of her own. 
She said she tries to walk under lit areas at her complex and has her boyfriend pick her up from work at the Reitz Union Hotel.
“Women are not always able to have peo-
ple around us, but we have to protect our-
selves,” she said. Off-campus housing, dorms face heightened safety precautions
WALK , from page 110 male students volunteeredFree self-defense classes available
The classes cover how to properly use 
pepper spray and mace. They also teach indi-
viduals about how to utilize common items 
in the event of an attack, such as pens, per-
fume, wallets and credit cards.
In response to recent events, more class-
es are being added starting Sept. 20 and 21. 
Those interested can either call ahead or walk 
in.
Jason Dodd from Global Mixed Mar-
tial Arts Studio on 4000 W. Newberry Road works directly with the Gainesville Police. 
He teaches officers a Brazilian form of Jiu 
Jitsu called Gracie.
Dodd’s studio has been offering free self-
defense classes for about two years, he said. 
The last one he hosted was Saturday.
“People weren’t beating down the doors 
to get in or anything like that, but it was a 
good number,” he said, adding that about 20 people showed up.
The studio sells self-defense keychains for about $10, said Joyce Pratt, a sales associate. 
They are in the shape of a cat’s head and can 
be used like brass knuckles.
The classes do not require any fees or do-
nations and take place on the first Saturday 
of every month at 2:30 p.m. The next class 
will be on Oct. 4.
As developments have slowed down, ru-
mors have circulated.
GPD spokesman Officer Ben Tobias said 
people can report or confirm rumors by call-ing the UF Rumor Control Hotline.
“We understand that social media moves 
news extremely quickly, and can distort ru-
mor,” he said. 
According to the UF Student Honor Code 
and Student Conduct Code, weapons banned 
on campus include stun guns, pellet guns, BB guns, slingshots and archery equipment.
Chemical or biological agents, such as 
Mace and pepper spray, are also banned, as well as knives or any object or material ca-pable of causing physical harm.mAce , from page 1 “Walk in pairs, call your

Campus safety reminders set a serious 
tone Tuesday night before the UF Student 
Senate got down to business, approving the 
new Activity and Service Fee budget for the 
2014-2015 fiscal year.
The bill’s author, Sen. Davis Bean, chair-
man of the budget and appropriations com-
mittee,  proposed a new budget that empha-
sized recreation and gave priority of reserve funds to intramural clubs. 
The total budget of $20 million allotted 
$5.5 million to Student Government, $6.7 million to the Reitz Union, $6.5 million to recreational sports and $1.3 million to Stu-dent Activities and Involvement.The service fee for students will be $18.19, 
an 84-cent increase from last year.
“If there’s money that is continuously left 
in that account, it’s not serving the students well, and it’s just going into reserves,” Bean said.
Student involvement with gyms and club 
sports is significantly high, Bean said. Last year, 12,000 students participated in intra-mural sports and group fitness.
A lone voice, Sen. Michael Christ dis-
agreed with funding lobbyists for Student 
Government.
“I don’t think the amount we pay to lob-
byists is appropriate,” Christ said. “Student 
Government has an obligation to make sure 
that every dollar is used effectively toward 
students.”
Sen. Leah Miller said that it can be diffi-
cult to predict expenditures, but the budget lets students see where the money spent is 
going.  
“The cut is necessary and used in a more 
efficient way,” she said.
The budget will sail on to next week’s 
Student Senate meeting for its second read-
ing and final approval.Senate approves Activity and Service Fee $20 million budget

UF isn’t the only Florida university 
facing presidential changes.
Florida State University and the Uni-
versity of Miami will be transitioning 
into new leadership as both search for 
their university’s next president.
UM President Donna Shalala an-
nounced Monday that she will retire in 
2015. She has been acting as president for 14 years.
Last spring, former FSU President 
Eric Barron left the university to become Penn State’s 18th president. Garnett Stokes has been serving as FSU’s interim 
president since April 2.
FSU’s Presidential Search Advisory 
Committee conducted interviews with 
11 applicants Monday and Tuesday.
With UF President Bernie Machen’s 
December retirement approaching, eight applicants were announced Friday after the UF Board of Trustees retreat.
Brittany Davis, the State University System of Florida Board of Governors spokeswoman, wrote in an email that an adjustment period is inevitable.
“Our boards of trustees are well-po-
sitioned to work with the senior admin-istration to ensure that our universities continue to serve our students and com-munities during a presidential transi-tion,” she said.
Students are also looking to their 
search committees to find a president fit for their university.
“We’re all really sad that Dr. Shalala is 
leaving us,” said Elizabeth Baltazar, a 19-year-old UM health science and micro-biology and immunology sophomore. “I was really looking forward to shaking her hand at graduation, and she’s made 
UM a much better school than it was 
when she first came here.”
A university president is responsible 
for steering the short- and long-term vi-sions of their respective school.
UF spokeswoman Janine Sikes said  
the timing of the presidential searches is “coincidental.”Presidents leave FL colleges� ABOUT 20 PERCENT OF PEOPLE IN 
THEIR 20’S REPORT IDENTITY THEFT.

Amanda DioGuardi had her identity sto-
len two years ago. When she started receiving 
emails from AARP, her father looked into her credit score.
“Someone was able to sign my name on 
a mortgage even though I was only 16 at the time,” the 18-year-old public relations sopho-more said.
More and more college students like Dio-
Guardi are having their identities stolen.
According to a 2013 report by the Federal 
Trade Commission, about 20 percent of 20-to- 29-year-olds filed identity theft complaints.
Susan Blair, UF’s chief privacy officer, warns 
students about putting their personal informa-tion online.
“More than 50 percent of individuals who 
post personal information on Facebook experi-ence some form of identity theft,” she wrote in an email.
UF spokeswoman Janine Sikes said the uni-
versity invested in software that blocks hackers from obtaining any personal information.
“We have 50,000 students and 20,000 to 
30,000 employees,” she said, “which makes us a prime target for hackers.”
Kelsey Torgerson, a 21-year-old UF politi-
cal science senior, had her credit card number 
stolen in August. She said a man replicated 
her card and used it at Target, where the store caught the entire transaction on video.
“I am just fortunate to have had a funny 
feeling in my gut that encouraged me to check my online statement that same day,” Torger-son said. Students at identity theft risk“I don’t think the amount we pay 
to lobbyists is appropriate. Student 
Government has an obligation to

Tips from UF’s Office for Student 
Financial Affairs to prevent students 
from having their identities stolen:
•Never give out your information to 
organizations or people you don’t know.
• Never give out your personal information over 
the phone or online unless you initiated 
contact.
• Check your credit annually.

Time to end Swamp Party dominance
They haven’t appeared just yet, but they’re coming 
soon.
Blue and orange Swamp Party campaign stickers 
will cover nearly every inch of this campus and its inhabit-ants within the next three weeks.
UF Student Senate slating, the process of selecting candi-
dates to run for senator positions, took place Sunday through Tuesday of this week. There are ﬁ  ve registered parties stu-dents can run under, but only one party chose to campaign for Senate slating, and only one major party will be on the ballot: the Swamp Party.
As of Sunday, 11 students qualiﬁ  ed for Student Senate 
seats, and all of them slated with the Swamp Party. Even the possibility of having only one party on the ballot is absolute-
ly ridiculous. 
A one-party election would call into question the suppos-
edly democratic nature of Student Government elections. 
This de facto one-party rule also begs the question: Why are no other parties asserting themselves as valid political con-tenders?
The Swamp Party started in Fall 2012 after the Unite Par-
ty crumbled. When the Swamp Party formed, it took credit for policies enacted by the Unite Party such as Library West 
staying open 24 hours a day, ﬁ  ve days a week.
If the Swamp Party wants to take credit for the accom-
plishments of Unite, it must also answer for the party’s past 
controversies. These incidents include leaked recordings of Unite Party members discussing intimidation tactics to se-cure more votes.
In 2013, an email sent by a Swamp Party liaison Leah 
Miller to fraternity house representatives asked for a $250 check made out to the Swamp Party and the collection of “I 
Voted” stickers from its brothers. The email concluded with 
a request that the email be deleted. Sketchy, to say the least. 
Yet the Swamp Party has certainly enacted a number of 
praiseworthy policies on campus. 
The tablet initiative in Spring 2013, which began iPad rent-
als to students from Library West, was a positive measure. Swamp Party’s Spring 2014 platform included noncontro-versial items such as ensuring low tuition and working with the Student Health Care Center to develop an online process for making appointments.
Even if the Swamp Party’s po-
sitions are mostly benign and in 
the best interest of UF students, 
Gators deserve the choice to vote for candidates from more than just one party.
In Fall 2012, the Swamp Party 
held 35 seats in Student Senate and the Student Party held 15 
seats. In Fall 2013, the Swamp Party held 48 seats in Student Senate and the Student Party held two. In Spring 2014, the 
Swamp Party claimed all 50 seats. In Spring 2014, the Swamp 
Party candidates for president and vice president were un-opposed.
The Swamp Party has gained so much power that it 
seems nearly impossible to challenge. But something must be done. If the UF Student Body really wants to be “Together for Tomorrow” like Swamp Party’s motto claims, it needs an electoral process that offers students a real choice.
Having only one party on the ballot also discourages vot-
er turnout by guaranteeing a winner before the election even begins. Gators should feel connected to and responsible for their representatives in Student Government, not apathetic and distant. 
The dominance of the Swamp Party is not ideal for UF or 
for the ideals of democracy and diversity that the university claims to cherish.
Challenging the Swamp Party will require strong organi-
zation from other student parties and dedicated candidates 
who believe they can make an impact.
One party ruling UF betrays the Student Government’s 
mission to “represent and act in the interests of students.”
The unquestioned dominance of the Swamp Party has 
gone on long enough. It’s time to give UF students a real 
choice.

be addressed by 
correctional leaders
In the aftermath of the shooting of Michael Brown in Fergu-son, Missouri, the nation’s attention has turned to the issue of police brutality. The problem of abuse and excessive force 
by law enforcement also extends to America’s prison system. Nowhere is inmate abuse more evident and prevalent than in 
Florida.
In recent years, multiple cases of physical and sexual abuse of 
Florida’s prison inmates have come to light.
The Tampa Bay Times reported that two correctional ofﬁ  cers 
were suspended from duty at Lake Butler’s Reception and Med-
ical Center after an inmate said he was sexually assaulted.
Last month, Florida Department of Corrections secretary 
Mike Crews ﬁ  red three employees at the Dade Correctional Institution near Miami. The employees, a warden and two as-
sistants, were terminated for delaying the investigation into the 
death of Darren Rainey.
Rainey, an inmate at the institution, died in 2012 after being 
locked in a scalding shower. 
The Dade Correctional Institution has a history of prisoner 
abuse. Three former employees have alleged that facility em-ployees repeatedly harassed mentally ill inmates for “sport.”
The pattern of abuse in Florida’s prisons is appalling and hor-
rifying. Investigators evaluating the Florida Department of Cor-
rections have described the state’s prison system as “rife with 
corruption, brutality and ofﬁ  cially sanctioned gang violence.”
Some may argue that inmate abuse isn’t really an issue at all. 
After all, these individuals were found guilty of crimes, so they deserve whatever punishment they receive while incarcerated.
This is a dangerous line of thinking that attempts to justify 
abhorrent and illegal behavior. Even prisoners have the constitu-tional right of protection from cruel and unusual punishment.
The true measure of a society that claims to champion human 
rights is how that society treats those who are most vulnerable to having those rights violated. Inmates within the Florida prison system certainly fall into this category, and our state has done a miserable job of stopping prisoner abuse.
The move toward prison privatization championed by Gov. 
Rick Scott would only worsen Florida’s shameful track record of inmate abuse. A study from the U.S. Department of Justice found that assaults on inmates by corrections ofﬁ  cers are 49 percent more prevalent in private prisons than in traditional, 
government-operated facilities.
Scott is notorious for his close ties to leaders in the private 
prison industry, including George Zoley of GEO Group Inc. Zo-
ley and his company have given generously to Scott’s 2010 and 2014 campaigns and even donated $20,000 to help renovate the governor’s mansion. If Scott has his way and Florida’s prisons become privatized, the disgraceful treatment of our state’s in-mates is sure to continue.
Crews has said in the past that he has a zero-tolerance policy 
for inmate abuse. The corrections secretary must follow these strong words with meaningful and signiﬁ  cant action to ensure that this disturbing trend ceases.WEDNESDAY, SEPTEMBER 10, 2014

Last week, former Virginia 
Gov. Bob McDonnell was convicted of corruption. Mc-
Donnell was once a shining star in the Republican Party and was 
a potential 2012 running mate for 
Republican nominee Mitt Rom-ney.
Many political observers con-
sidered McDonnell to be a presi-dential contender in 2016. Howev-er, his indictment and subsequent 
conviction changed his political 
fortunes permanently. McDon-nell’s wife, Maureen — whom Mc-Donnell threw under the bus dur-ing the trial — was also convicted of various charges.
What did the McDonnells do to 
land themselves in so much trou-ble? 
They used the power of the gov-
ernor’s ofﬁ  ce to assist the owner of a diet supplement company in ex-change for $177,000 in gifts.
The McDonnell case is about as 
clear a textbook example of politi-cal corruption as you can ﬁ  nd.
McDonnell is among a slew of 
current and former Republican governors throughout the country who are either under investigation or face criminal charges, and many of the names are presidential con-tenders. 
Texas Gov. Rick Perry was re-
cently indicted on abuse of power 
charges, after the governor alleg-
edly threatened a Texas district at-torney if she didn’t resign follow-ing a DUI arrest.
Perry has blamed the felony 
indictment on overzealous Demo-crats out for partisan blood. 
However, recent accounts show 
that it is, in fact, Republicans push-ing the case against Texas’s longest serving governor. A Republican prosecutor and a Republican-ap-pointed judge brought the case against Perry.
The conviction of McDonnell 
and the indictment of Perry are 
far from isolated incidents. They 
represent just a portion of the Re-publican gubernatorial madhouse throughout the country, as several other GOP governors are under in-vestigation.
The investigation into New Jer-
sey Gov. Chris Christie’s role in the completely ridiculous Bridgegate scandal continues. As a reminder, Christie allegedly sought revenge against mayors who didn’t endorse his reelection campaign in 2013 by shutting down bridges between New Jersey and New York. 
The allegations hurt the hot-
headed governor’s 2016 prospects, and the threat of further legal ac-tion continues to hang over Chris-
tie’s head.
Georgia Gov. Nathan Deal 
— who is locked in a tight battle 
for reelection — is likewise fac-ing investigations stemming from his 2010 gubernatorial campaign. When accused of campaign disclo-sure violations, Deal’s team alleg-edly had the head of the state eth-ics commission ﬁ  red and replaced 
with Deal’s handpicked successor. 
The new ethics chief shut down 
the investigation into Deal’s cam-
paign, and the issue seemed settled until this year.
Now, Deal’s ethics chief alleges 
that she was threatened by Deal’s chief-of-staff and his attorney, and a judge recently handed out $3 
million wrongful termination set-
tlements for those ﬁ  red after Deal took ofﬁ  ce. 
Deal’s ethics chief was ﬁ  red this 
week, and now the FBI is looking into the matter, and it has thrown a kink into Deal’s march toward a 
second term.
In Wisconsin, Gov. Scott Walk-
er is locked in a heated reelection 
battle and is an often-mentioned name for the 2016 Republican presidential race. 
Although some denied that 
Walker was under investigation, his connections to a political action 
committee targeted in a federal 
criminal conspiracy case raised many eyebrows earlier this sum-mer.
The investigation was intended 
to determine whether the Wiscon-sin Club for Growth — a conserva-tive political action group — coor-dinated with political campaigns in Wisconsin, which would amount to a major violation of campaign ﬁ  nance law.
The common thread between 
all these governors isn’t just their political afﬁ  liation but also their belief that they are above the law. 
It doesn’t matter whether McDon-
nell remains the only governor from this group to actually be con-victed of a crime.
We should demand account-
ability and honesty from our state leaders. 
Our governors need to look 
out for the best interest of their states, not ask for lavish gifts, or rig the ethics commission, or close a bridge because of a ridiculous grudge.
We can continue to complain 
that politicians are morally bank-rupt, corrupt and unethical, but 
at the end of the day, the voters 
choose to hire or ﬁ  re elected ofﬁ  -cials.
Just remember the next time 
you’re outraged at the moral in-eptitude of American politicians, use the strongest voice you have: the power of your vote.

opinions@alligator.orgThe recent assaults 
on campus have inspired the usual 
stream of safety tips and praise for the bravery of 
the victims. As Alligator columnist 
Sally Greider pointed out, these state-ments from police, the public dis-course about risky behavior, and the swift offerings of pepper spray and alarm key rings from retailers do vir-tually nothing. 
Why? Because those who are de-
termined to attack and assault women 
will do so no matter what precautions 
their victims take.
The safety tips are certainly helpful. 
However, a female student can carry an arsenal of preventive tools and still be assaulted if caught off guard. 
In response, some might say, “Then 
always be on your guard!”
Ah, there’s the rub. Should women 
at UF have to live in constant fear of an assailant who might attack as we leave our evening class or run out to the store?
The women who screamed and 
fought back may have been brave, but law enforcement’s primary concern should not be the bravery of victims. It should be more concerned about an 
attacker whose arrogance is so great 
that he feels able to continually pursu-ing victims without being caught.
One of the most shameful aspects 
of modern American society is the pervasiveness of sexual assault. It is not simply the pastime of lonely, des-perate men — otherwise all such men would engage in these behaviors.
Sexual assault is a violent act that 
reﬂ  ects a higher level of structural in-equality. This is worsened when authorities urge the community to emphasize the defense of women, while sidestepping the 
basic problem, which is the (male) at-tackers.
I shudder to think of what some 
might say if the attacker had succeed-ed in raping one of these women. “She was walking alone in a short skirt?” “She smiled and said hi to him?” “She did not ﬁ  ght hard enough, so he over-powered her?”
I once had to explain to an ex-boy-
friend that I didn’t ask to be raped on my undergraduate campus. He still broke up with me because he saw me as a slut.
I have had to explain to friends that 
I didn’t report how abusive another boyfriend was because any amount of self-defense or involvement of author-
ities would have threatened my life. 
Fighting back is not a ﬁ  x when the at-tacker will only attack again. This is a problem that affects females through-out Florida and the entire country.
The real ﬁ  x is not arming people 
with pepper spray, safety apps and drug-detecting nail polish, but edu-cating people that sexual assault and 
abuse are wrong, and that we are all 
at risk.  I encourage law enforcement at UF and in Gainesville to focus less on the behavior of the victims and shift all focus to the perpetrator. The clear, unambiguous message must be: “If you attack another human being, you are a criminal. We will ﬁ  nd you and punish you.”

seriously with educationGuest column
Sunday night, a string of texts lit 
up on my phone. As soon as I saw the short UF Alert number, 
I knew — dreading it, but knowing it — another case of battery had just 
been reported to the police.
That night, I dreamed that a 
stranger and I got in a ﬁ  ght with the 
perp.
I’m deﬁ  nitely not a violent per-
son or one to get involved in ﬁ  ghts. The fact that I — a man, some would say — am internalizing fears and frustrations like this makes me cringe when I wonder what the women on this campus 
must be facing.
On Monday, TMZ released video footage from 
inside an elevator in an Atlantic City casino. The  
graphic video shows a man and a woman enter. 
He slaps her once; she lunges at him and then 
he hits her even harder — her body slams against the elevator wall. 
Now that she’s unconscious, the door opens 
and the man drags her, limp and unresponsive, 
out of the elevator.
The man in that video was Ray Rice, who, un-
til recently, played for the Baltimore Ravens. The 
woman was his wife.
In response to the video, the Ravens released 
Rice from his contract with the franchise. The NFL has suspended the running back indeﬁ  nitely.
These consequences, although lenient, would 
have been acceptable had this brutal assault 
happened this weekend. But the revolting truth 
is that the events in the elevator happened six months ago.
Why, then, did it take six months for the Ra-
vens and the NFL to do anything other than give Rice a slap on the wrist?
The scandal broke soon after the assault hap-
pened in February, when TMZ released video footage from an external camera that showed 
Rice dragging his ﬁ  ancee’s unconscious body out 
of the elevator. 
That, along with the fact that criminal charges 
were ﬁ  led against Rice, was enough for most rea-sonable people to demand that the Ravens and the NFL take action against him.Unfortunately, that action was 
severely and unjustiﬁ  ably delayed. Palmer declined to testify at Rice’s indictment, so he got off with court-supervised counseling. In a surpris-
ing turn of events, Rice and Palmer 
married the next day. In May, the Ravens tweeted “Janay Rice says she deeply regrets the role that she played the night of the incident.” 
The tweet has since been deleted.
Amid public outcry, NFL Commissioner Rog-
er Goodell opted to suspend Rice for the ﬁ  rst two games of the regular season. The Ravens declined 
to take any action whatsoever. These mild disci-
plinary actions were announced after a private meeting where Janay was graciously allowed to tell her side of the story in front of Rice and four other men, two of whom were Ravens ofﬁ  cials.
Many dedicated Ravens fans did not seem 
troubled by Rice’s behavior during two of the Ra-vens’ open practices. In fact, many fans cheered wildly whenever he appeared on the stadium’s 
Jumbotron. One of these cheers ended in a stand-
ing ovation.
Regardless of the NFL’s misguided behavior, 
Rice is ultimately the one at fault. However, this situation was mishandled to the point where it seems that the NFL was willing to protect Ray Rice until the public relations nightmare became too much to handle.
The fact that it took the NFL six months to 
take action against Rice, despite the presence of clear, incontrovertible video evidence, speaks to a larger problem in our society. 
That problem is also evident here at UF where 
many of our own friends and acquaintances, par-ticularly females, must fear leaving their homes at night.
It’s amazing to see our community come to-
gether and help protect its female members.  
However, the recent string of assaults and the 
Rice situation demonstrate that we still have much more work to do to eliminate the pervasive issue of violence against women.

CUPERTINO, Calif. — Apple Inc. un-
veiled its long-anticipated smartwatch 
Tuesday, introducing a device that aims to 
put many of the functions of a smartphone 
onto a smaller screen that’s never more than an arm’s length from the wearer’s eyes.
The Apple Watch, the company’s first 
completely new product in four years and its first wearable device, is also Apple’s most ambitious expansion since CEO Tim Cook replaced Steve Jobs three years ago.
The watch made its debut alongside a 
service that seeks to turn Apple mobile de-vices into a payment system that will elimi-nate the need for consumers to bring cash or 
plastic cards to the checkout stand.
The new watch will come in a variety of 
styles and straps, with a choice of two siz-
es. Watches from competing vendors have been criticized for being too big for smaller 
wrists.
The watch will require one of the new 
iPhones or an iPhone 5, 5s or 5c. It will be 
available early next year at a starting price 
of $349.The iPhone 6 will feature a 4.7-inch screen, 
up from the 4-inch screen on the models re-
leased in each of the previous two years. The iPhone 6 Plus will boast a 5.5-inch screen and other improvements, including longer battery life, that will cost an additional $100. 
The screen resolution on the Plus version 
will be sharper than previous iPhones.
Apple is calling its new payment system Apple Pay.
Consumers will be able to use their 
phone cameras to capture a photo of their 
cards. Apple will verify it behind the scenes 
and add it to the phone’s Passbook account so people can make payments at a retailer. 
Though much of the attention has been 
on new gadgets, the software powering 
those gadgets is getting its annual refresh. 
Apple considers iOS 8 to be its biggest up-date since the App Store debuted in 2008.
Existing iPhone and iPad users will be 
eligible for the free upgrade, too.
Among other things, iOS 8 will let devic-
es work better in sync. For instance, it will be possible to start a message on an iPhone and 
finish it on an iPad. With an upcoming Mac 
upgrade called Yosemite, it will be possible to continue working on that same message on a Mac computer as well.
The new software will be available to ex-
isting users on Sept. 17.
But Apple has a reputation for igniting 
dormant markets after the company shifted the direction of digital technology with the 
iPod, iPhone and iPad. Other MP3 music 
players, smartphones and tablet computers were first to market, but the devices didn’t enthrall consumers until Apple imbued 
them with its magic touch.8, ALLIGATOR � WEDNESDAY, SEPTEMBER 10, 2014

As Gainesville High School seniors be-
gin the college application process, a re-
port released this month suggested prefer-ence — not prestige — is the main factor in choosing a school.
Parchment, a transcript-processing 
company, compiled the report using data from the 28,000 applicants that used its service throughout the last academic year.
UF receives approximately 30,000 appli-
cations each November, and about 12,000 students are accepted, said UF spokesman Steve Orlando.
But what factors were taken into ac-
count when accepted applicants chose 
UF?
For computer science major Cameron 
Willey, it was legacy.
“It was more of a family tradition,” Willey said. “I have a brother and a sister 
here.”
Another factor is cost, which the study 
did not take into account.
The price of undergraduate attendance 
at UF this year is about $20,550, according to the Student Financial Affairs website.
Linda Lewis, a mental health counselor 
at UF’s Counseling & Wellness Center, said students consider many factors when choosing a school, like money, where they can get in and family pressures.
From her experience, UF was the only 
place some students wanted to go.
But Lewis said situations can change once students get to campus.
 “Good decisions do not guarantee good 
outcomes,” Lewis said. “We hope that stu-
dents have considered many aspects about 
prospective schools and don’t judge only by one or two aspects.”
The cost of attendance is even higher for 
graduate students, but that does not stop them from making UF their No. 1 pick.
Georges Akiki, a graduate student at 
UF, decided to go to the university because he received funding through a program by 
a world-renowned professor here.
“I chose the professor more than the 
school,” Akiki said.Study: Preference main factor in students choosing universities

Teach For America released its 
seventh annual list of schools that 
contribute the greatest number of alumni to the teaching corps.
The 2014 list shows UF as one 
of the top contributing schools in the nation. This is the seventh year the university has received that distinction.
Dana Cronyn, Teach For 
America’s director of campus communications, said UF has al-ways been a significant contribu-tor to the corps.
“One of the reasons why UF 
consistently makes the list is be-cause UF students always seek to make an impact,” she said.
Sixty-five UF alumni will join 
this year’s corps of about 5,300 new members. These Gators will impact more than 5,500 students, Cronyn said.
Stephanie Salazar, a 22-year-
old UF alumna, originally in-tended to go to law school after graduation. However, after hear-ing a presentation by Teach For America campus recruiters, her plans changed.
“I never realized how many 
kids were living in poverty in our country,” she said. “I thought it was a great opportunity to reach those kids.”
This year’s corps is the most 
diverse in the program’s history, according to a Teach For America press release.
Of the 5,300 new members, 
about half are people of color, 47 percent received Pell Grants, and one-third were the first in their families to attend college.
Cronyn said the organization 
has made increasing teacher di-versity a priority.Jane Vicens, a 24-year-old UF 
alumna and Teach For America member, said corps members can support and network with oth-ers around the country. This net-work extends to the 37,000 Teach For America alumni who are still working in the education field, and 400 of them are Gators, Cro-
nyn said.
“(The best part about being a 
teacher with Teach For America) 
is the fact you work for an organi-
zation that stands for educational 
reform,” Vicens said. “You’re a part of a greater mission, and ev-ery day, you’re working toward that.”UF makes Teach for America list for

The UF chemical engineer-

to life away from home.
“It’s really hard to actually 
meet people and meet up with them later and be their friend,” Shalna said, “because you go into calc, and there are 400 stu-dents and you sit next to some-one new every day, and even if 
you exchange your name and 
your number, you’re probably not going to see them again.” 
But a new social network-
ing app created by two Princ-eton University students could change that. 
Princeton students Vaidhy 
Murti and Michael Pinsky launched the Friendsy mobile app earlier this year with the help of Dylan Sewell, a Dart-mouth engineering senior.
“Our lone requirement of a 
.edu email address, along with our moderated content, creates a safe environment for students to connect with each other,” Sewell wrote in an email.
Students interact on the app 
anonymously, but if mutual feelings develop between two 
users, they have the option of 
revealing their identity. 
“We’re not trying to get 
rid of face-to-face interaction,” Sewell said. “It’s just the very first step where you’re a little nervous of putting yourself out there.”

UF students sometime this Fall.App for meeting up

� EMPLOYERS PREFER MEN WITH

ALEXANDRA FERNANDEZ

When Jenna Bilodeau establishes herself, 
she wants children.
The 21-year-old UF microbiology and neu-
robiological sciences senior said she knows 
she’ll probably have a high-demand job be-cause of the field, but she still wants a family.
“I want to be a physician, so I do believe 
having kids will affect me,” she said, “but it shouldn’t.”
According to new research by Michelle Bu-
dig, a professor at the University of Massachu-
setts, Amherst, having children can help fur-
ther men’s careers while stunting women’s.
Employers prefer hiring fathers over moth-
ers, the research suggested. They view fathers as more committed to their work to support their children, while mothers are believed to work less and get distracted more easily.
Men typically earn 6 percent more if they 
have children, while women lose 4 percent of their earnings per child, according to the study.
Single, childless women make 96 cents 
for every dollar a man with or without kids makes, while married mothers make 76 cents.
“It’s interesting that these assumptions 
have extended over the last 30 years,” said Suzanna Smith, UF associate professor of hu-man development and family relations. “I think we’re looking at major stereotypes that haven’t been overcome yet.”Study: Men’s careers benefit from children, but not women’s

� HE SEEKS APPROVAL FOR ARMING AND 
TRAINING THE OPPOSITION.
THE ASSOCIATED PRESS
WASHINGTON — President Barack Obama will 
ask Congress to quickly authorize the arming and 
training of Syrian opposition forces but will press 
forward without formal sign-off from lawmakers on 
a broader military and political effort to combat mili-tants in Syria and Iraq, administration officials said Tuesday.
Obama was to outline his plans Wednesday in a 
rare prime-time address to the nation, a format that underscores the seriousness of the threat posed by the Islamic State militants. The president’s broader strategy could include more wide-ranging airstrikes 
against targets in Iraq and possibly in Syria and hing-
es on military and political commitments from allies in Europe, the Middle East and elsewhere.
Ahead of his address, the president huddled with 
congressional leaders at the White House. Follow-ing the hour-long discussion, the White House said Obama told lawmakers that he “has the authority he needs to take action” against the Islamic State mili-tants but would still welcome action from Congress 
that would “aid the overall effort and demonstrate to 
the world that the United States is united in defeating the threat.”
For Obama, a sustained U.S. intervention in the 
Middle East is at odds with the vision he had for the region when he ran for president on a pledge to end the war in Iraq, where the role of American fighting forces drew to a close nearly three years ago. The timing of his announcement Wednesday night was 
all the more striking, with Obama’s address to the nation scheduled just hours before anniversary com-memorations of the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, 2001.
Among the president’s urgent priorities will be 
seeking authorization from Congress to arm moder-
ate elements of the opposition fighting Syrian Presi-dent Bashar Assad. The president asked lawmakers 
earlier this year for a $500 million train-and-equip 
program, but the plan stalled.
Administration officials said 
Obama sees a congressional autho-
rization for a Syrian train-and-equip 
message as sending a strong signal 
to allies who are considering simi-lar efforts. Secretary of State John Kerry was traveling for discussions 
in Saudi Arabia and Jordan.
The U.S. is already launching 
airstrikes against Islamic State targets inside Iraq, a 
mission undertaken at the invitation of the Iraqi gov-
ernment and without formal authorization from Con-
gress. But the scope of the mission has been relatively limited to strikes that help protect American interests in the region and prevent humanitarian crises.
Unlike in Iraq, Obama would not be acting at the 
invitation of a host government. However, some in-ternational law experts say airstrikes could be justi-fied as a matter of self-defense if Obama argues the Islamic State group poses a threat to the U.S. and its allies from inside Syria, whose government is unwill-ing or unable to stop it.
Obama would still have to contend with the no-
tion that American strikes against the Islamic State militants were actually helping Assad, who has over-seen Syria’s bloody civil war. The U.S. has long called 
for Assad to leave power, and the Islamic State group 
is one of the groups inside Syria that is seeking to oust him.Obama to ask Congress for arms, 
training for Syrian opposition soon

Florida got exactly what it needed Saturday 
when it clobbered Eastern Michigan 65-0.
But offensive coordinator Kurt Roper is done 
hearing about how great the offense was. Now, 
he’s concerned with how the offense will be in three days against Kentucky.
And he wants his players to have the same 
mindset.
“You truly try to make it a day-to-day process,” 
Roper said Tuesday. “You truly just want to go compete each day to get better. And if you look at it that way, if you just take it one day at a time — 
and yes in a lot of ways that is coach speak — but 
the reason we hammer that in is if we can get those guys to buy into it and believe in it, then there is no roller-coaster ride.”
The roller-coaster ride Roper mentioned is the 
one the Gators rode in 2012 when they defeated No. 9 South Carolina and No. 4 LSU but struggled against Louisiana and Louisville.
So despite a dominating victory, Roper doesn’t 
mind cracking down on his team on the little things in order to keep Florida hungry for its Southeastern Conference opener against Kentucky.
“We’re all pretty hard on them on the practice 
field,” Roper said. “Sometimes that’s where you go out there and try to coach them back into reality. There is enough on the film to show them, ‘Hey, there were a lot of things that could have been bet-ter or really cost us.’”
Coach Will Muschamp said one area that con-
cerned him was ball security. Although the Gators

Clay Burton did not have an active 
role in the passing game during his 
first three years at Florida.
Heading into the season, Burton 
had just three career receptions for 24 yards.
But after building his rapport with 
quarterback Jeff Driskel throughout summer and fall camp, the senior tight end showed that his contribu-tions this season will extend further than his blocking skills.
In Florida’s 2014 season opener 
against Eastern Michigan, Burton led Florida with seven receptions — three more than all the Gators’ tight ends caught last season.
“It’s just a lot of hard work that’s 
kind of finally coming to the surface,” Burton said.
Added offen-
sive coordinator Kurt Roper: “I can’t say that I 
was surprised. We’ve been out there 
quite a bit in practice. I think what he 
is is a guy that has been steady for us the whole time. … He plays with a great base and he understands how to be in good positions, so that just 
carried over to the passing game.”

Nobody ever seems to like change. 
The smooth transition that Betsy Middle-
ton has made from the University of Miami to the University of Florida, however, is not something that is seen too often in college 
sports.
Transfer athletes don’t usually catch on 
right away at their new schools and some-
times need to take more time than usual to make that transition from one program to another. But when Florida sophomore Betsy Middleton, from Elon, N.C., made her move this offseason from the Miami Hurricanes to the Gators, she picked up in Gainesville right where she left off in Miami.
“It’s always scary going into new situa-
tions, but the transition was as smooth as it 
possibly could have been,” Middleton said. 
“I left there (Miami) with good graces and I came here and was welcomed immediately by the team and I haven’t regretted it at all. It’s been a great transition.”
In her freshman year at Miami, Middleton 
played in all 18 games for the Hurricanes and started the final 11, scoring her first collegiate goal to beat Milwaukee in overtime. 
At the end of the season, she was named 
Miami soccer’s Rookie of the Year.
As her freshman year came to a close, Mid-
dleton decided that it was in her best interest to transfer to Florida to play college soccer. 
Her decision, she said, came after Miami 
made some coaching changes and was placed under new leadership. She has nothing but respect for the Hurricanes coaching staff and Sophomore transfer catching 
on in first year at Florida

Coach Emily Glaser will be looking to 
lean on a squad that is returning five players 
and a transfer as she enters her third year at the helm of the Florida women’s golf team. 
The Gators enter the fall season ranked 
No. 17 in the nation and are one of seven teams from the Southeastern Conference to enter the year ranked in the top 25.
Leading the team will be senior Camilla 
Hedberg, who was a first-team All-SEC se-lection in her sophomore year. 
This season, Hedberg will be counted on 
to continue her strong play and be a leader for her team.
“She means everything. She’s been a tre-
mendous leader for us on and off the golf course,” Glaser said of Hedberg. “She’s the type of player that always sets very high standards for herself, almost to the point where it’s probably gotten in her way a little 
bit in the past, but I think her main goal is to 
just enjoy her senior year.”
Junior Ursa Orehek as well as sopho-
mores Maria Torres and Karolina Vlckova return to the team after competing in the World Amateur Team Championships in Karuizawa, Japan. 
Torres was the highest finisher in the 
group, finishing the championships at 3-over-par. Senior Anna Young will miss the fall tournament schedule as she contin-ues to recover from a wrist injury.
There are two new additions to the team, 
one of whom is freshman Taylor Tomlin-son. 
The Gainesville native 
was ranked No. 2 in the state of Florida and No. 10 in Golfweek’s girls’ junior 
ranking for the class of 2014. Tomlinson is 
the younger sister of men’s golf player J.D. 
Tomlinson. 
The other addition is sophomore Kelly 
Grassel, who is a transfer from Michigan State. Grassel finished her freshman season with a 75.40 scoring average which was the lowest by a freshman in Michigan State his-tory. She was also named Big Ten Women’s Golfer of the Week once last season.
Florida will be competing in three 
tournaments for the Fall semester, as they pushed back their schedule, so Torres, Orehek, and Vlckova could compete in the World Amateur Team Championships. Glaser said she wants the team to improve each day in the fall before ramping it up for the spring season.
“We’ve already talked a lot in our team 
meetings this year about really just staying process focused. I think that’s what’s going to benefit this team the most,” Glaser said. “It’s a lot of process talk and a lot of what we can do better on a daily basis and if we do that, then we’ll get where we need to go.”Women’s golf set for seasonmen’s golf

It was a disappointing and frustrating 
first tournament for first-year coach J.C. 
Deacon. 
The Florida men’s golf team finished 
in 13th place out of 14 teams at the Carpet Capital Collegiate Classic in Dalton, Ga. 
The Gators entered the final round 
of play in last place before finishing the 
tournament 33-over-par, which was good 
enough to finish ahead of Middle Tennes-see State.
“We’re taking some steps in the right 
direction, but there is some work to go and it’s not OK to be mediocre here and 
that’s what we are right now,” Deacon 
said. “So we’re going to have to work a little bit harder than everyone else.”
After the first day of the tournament, 
Florida sat at the bottom of the leader-board after shooting 24-over-par, which was 12 strokes behind both North Florida and Middle Tennessee State. 
Deacon noticed that players felt OK af-
ter the first round. 
But Deacon wasn’t satisfied  with the 
team being at the back of the pack after the opening round and the players’ poor performance has to motivate them to not settle for last place.  
In response to the first day, UF bounced 
back in the second round and shot an even-par round to stay at 24-over. 
It was a complete turnaround from the 
first day as the team and Deacon said it was important for the team to come back and improve after the rough first day.
“That was huge in so many little ways, 
J.D. Tomlinson, who’s a senior and going to be a leader for us this year…and if he’d birdied out the last, we had a chance to shoot even and another mini milestone,” Deacon said. 
“We talked about it on the tee, how 
were we going to do this and how big would it be for the guys if we could get an even par round in and sure enough he hit three great shots and made about a six footer for birdie.”
The Gators played steady in the final 
round of competition, shooting 9-over-par to give them their 13th-place finish. 
UF will have a week off to improve 
their game, before heading off to Zions-ville, In., for the two-day Wolf Run In-tercollegiate tournament which starts on Sept. 20. 
Deacon said the team will have to fo-
cus on doing the small things right during the off week, so they could prepare to be their best in next weekend’s tournament.
“There’s not a magic pill. We’re not go-
ing to change this whole thing overnight,” Deacon said, “but if we do the little things right consistently, we’re going to be OK.”UF eyes increased production

UF coachorganization, but Middleton felt 
she was better suited for Florida’s playing style.
“I like that this team plays the 
beautiful game,” Middleton said. 
“I’m a possession person. I love 
keeping the ball, and this team is just fantastic at it…keeping the ball, making beautiful plays, that kind of thing, I’ve found that here and I really enjoy it.”
This year, in her sophomore 
season, Middleton has played in all five of Florida’s games so far and recorded her first goal as a 
Gator on Friday when Florida beat 
in-state rival Florida State 2-1 in Tallahassee. She also played 28 minutes against her former school when Florida played Miami in the season opener on Aug. 22 but did not record any goals or assists.
Coach Becky Burleigh recog-
nizes how well Middleton has 
made the transition into Florida’s 
lineup. She thinks Middleton can be a big help for her team moving forward.
“Oh, she’s been great,” Burleigh 
said. “From a style of play, it’s a pretty big contrast from where she 
came from to here, but she has been 
seamless in terms of her contribu-tion and I see that only growing.”
It’s been a long journey so far 
for Middleton in her first two sea-sons of collegiate soccer, but she is happy that she has found her place at Florida and looks forward to ex-citing times as a Gator.
“I’ve always thought that the 
only way to make myself a good player is by surrounding myself with the best players,” Middleton said. “(It’s) one reason why I de-cided to play here.”
did not give up the ball at all 
Saturday, Muschamp said he saw instances on film that wor-
ried him and should worry the 
players.
“Offensively, I think we 
were pretty fortunate, to be 
honest with you, that we 
didn’t have more turnovers,” the fourth-year head coach said. “We had some ball secu-rity issues that we’ve got to get 
cleaned up and that was evi-
dent on the tape.”
The Wildcats are tied for 
second in the country in turn-
over margin per game.
And although Jeff Driskel 
did not throw an interception 
in his return from a broken leg, he nearly gave the Eagles the 
ball on an errant screen pass in 
the red zone. 
The redshirt junior did 
not throw a pick throughout 
the entirety of fall camp, but 
he knows without critiquing his game on film, he can eas-ily end that streak Saturday against Kentucky.
“It’s easy to go in on Sunday 
after a good game and watch the film, but you still have to realize there are mistakes 
made and you have to build 
on those mistakes and take the coaching,” Driskel said.
If the Gators do in fact take 
their coaching “one day at a time,” Roper believes his of-fense has the chance to reload 
each week and possibly be-
come even faster. Florida ran 86 plays Saturday, which was the highest number of plays in 
a single game during the Mus-
champ era.
However, Roper — search-
ing to find each and every way to perfect his spread offense — 
said the Gators can go faster.
“We had 21 snaps on Sat-
urday that were outside of 18 
seconds on the play clock,” 
Roper said. 
“Our average was 14 sec-
onds on the play clock, we 
would like our average to be 18 seconds on the play clock. 
So we would like to be faster 
just in our normal function of how we do it, we would like to obviously have more than 
21 plays outside of 18 seconds 
and I think it gets down to our guys understanding giving the ball back to the official getting lined up in a hurry. 
“Too many times we left the 
ball on the ground at the end of a play where an official has to go get it to spot it and those 
type things. So I think we can 
play obviously faster just look-ing at those numbers but again it’s all about making plays.”cially since Virginia transfer Jake 
McGee — who Roper said has the 
best hands at the position — is out for the year with a fractured tibia and fibula.
“We’re definitely going to 
miss him,” Burton said, “but oth-er guys have to step up and play well.”
Burton said that while he 
has improved his pass-catching skills, Florida’s depth among its skill positions gives it opportuni-ties to spread the ball around.
“Anybody can really get the 
ball. Whoever is open,” Burton said. “Whatever read that Jeff [Driskel] makes. We count on him to make the right one. The 
ball gets spread around.”
With McGee’s season finished, 
senior Tevin Westbrook will as-
sume the backup tight end role 
while true freshman DeAndre 
Goolsby will move up to third string.
“The philosophy is not really 
going to change. (Burton’s) go-ing to be the starting tight end and we’re going to obviously play him a lot, but Tevin’s got to be ready to go quite a bit now,” 
Roper said. 
“And we’ll see how DeAndre 
comes along in practice and all 
those things.”
Prior to McGee’s injury, Roper 
and coach Will Muschamp had plans to redshirt Goolsby to give him a year to better learn the of-fense.
“I think at (tight end), you’re 
talking a true freshman playing a violent, physical position that carries a lot in our offense,” Rop-
er said. 
“And so, that’s why typically 
you don’t see true freshmen play-
ing a whole bunch at that posi-tion. There is so much going on 
for him, run game, pass game, 
protections, matching up against 270-pound guys in certain situ-ations. It’s a challenge. You like 
those guys to be able to grow and 
develop a little bit. He’s got some athletic ability in space that is pretty good.”

Florida opens its Southeastern Conference slate 
at home on Saturday against Kentucky, but there 
are other games happening around the country. Week 3 of the College Football season, besides a few decent matchups, is painful folks. It’s the sad truth. While I in no means would recommend you avoid any weekend of college football might I suggest you stick to watching the games I have put for you here. Conveniently enough, they are spread out between 
noon and 7 p.m. 
No. 6 Georgia @ No. 24 South Carolina: 
Saturday, 3:30pm - CBS: Preseason SEC East 
favorites Georgia and South Carolina clash in Week 3. Both teams look different than what 
critics originally predicted at the beginning of 
the season.
No one saw Texas A&M blowing South 
Carolina out of the water in the ﬁ  rst game of 
the season, and people were doubtful with 
some areas of Georgia on both sides of the 
ball. 
But with Georgia’s thrashing of Clemson 
paired with Todd Gurley’s 293 yard perfor-
mance, the Bulldogs are one of the new front-
runners to win both the SEC East and the SEC 
come December.
South Carolina looked underwhelming 
against East Carolina on Saturday, but run-
ning back Mike Davis — a preseason Heisman 
Trophy candidate — rushed for 101 yards and 
two touchdowns last week in his return from 
bruised ribs he was nursing in Week 1. 
Quarterback Dylan Thompson has been steady under center, having averaged 316 passing yards in two games, but he has thrown an interception in each of his ﬁ  rst two games.
If South Carolina’s defense, which ranks 
11th out of 14 teams in the SEC in rushing defense, cannot contain Gurley and Georgia’s stable of running backs, the Gamecocks could go from SEC East contender to pretender real quick.
No. 20 Missouri @ UCF: Saturday, 12pm 
- SEC Network: This UCF team did lose its opener vs Penn State in Ireland, who ironi-cally is the Big Ten’s best shot to make the College Football Playoff, but the Knights re-turn 18 starters from a UCF team that won the Fiesta Bowl in January. 
Pair that with the fact that UCF gave South 
Carolina a 28-25 scare in September at home last year, and the Knights might keep this one close.
Missouri beat head coach Gary Pinkel’s 
former team, Toledo, convincingly last week on the road, and running back Marcus Mur-phy is second in all-purpose yards per game  in the SEC with 354.
Tennessee @ No. 4 Oklahoma: Saturday, 
8pm - ABC: Sooners head coach Bob Stoops 
gets another chance to beat a team in the SEC on Saturday. 
Stoops has been bashing the SEC since 
seemingly the moment the conference started dominating college football in the last decade and has basked in his takedown of Alabama in last year’s Sugar Bowl all offseason. 
The Vols enter the matchup 2-0 and with 
a lot of young talent in Butch Jones’ second year. 
Not to mention they have one of the most 
physical linebackers in the country in A.J. Johnson, who in two games already has 18 total tackles.
Oklahoma’s strength of schedule is poor, 
but a surprisingly close game Saturday in 
Norman, Okla., could have a slight impact 
when the College Football Playoff committee puts together its Top 25.Georgia-South Carolina highlights college football matchups
