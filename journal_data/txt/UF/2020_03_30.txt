satisfactory or unsatisfactory grading option 
for students if they felt like their course progress has been affected because of the 
COVID-19 outbreak. Similarly, Florida State 
University and the University of Central 
Florida have provided these options, even 
though FSU has not reported any cases and 
UCF has two positive cases.
County cases can be tracked on the Florida 
Department of Health’s online dashboard. 
The number of hospitalizations in the county 
jumped from six to 11 Sunday evening,

Prediction of 100,000 virus deaths 
looms as Trump seeks swift 
reopening of economy
As President Donald Trump looks 
for ways to restore normalcy in 
parts of the United States, his 
infectious disease expert said the 
country could have more than 
100,000 deaths and millions of 
infections from the COVID-19 
pandemic. Dr. Anthony Fauci 
gave the estimates on CNN’s 
“State of the Union” television 
show Sunday amid a time where 
there are about 125,000 cases in 
the U.S. and about 2,100 deaths. 
Trump eyed a “reopening” of the 
U.S. economy by Easter, which 
falls on April 12 this year, but in 
recent days, medical professionals 
have warned that would be far 
too soon for the nation’s heavily 
affected urban areas. On Saturday, 
the White House task force 
recommended a travel advisory 
for residents of those states to limit 
non-essential travel to slow the 
spread of the virus to other parts 
of the U.S.
Largest U.S. dam removal stirs 
debate over coveted West water
The Klamath River, in California, 
is the site of a proposed project to 
eliminate four dams on the lower 
reaches of the river to help save 
the salmon population there. 
The project, estimated at nearly 
$450 million, would reshape the 
Klamath River and empty giant 
reservoirs. It could also revive 
plummeting salmon populations 
by reopening hundreds of miles 
of potential habitat that has been 
blocked for more than a century, 
bringing relief to a half-dozen 
Native American tribes spread 
across hundreds of miles in 
southern Oregon and northern 
California. Opponents of the 
proposed project, including a 
group of residents who live 
around a meandering lake formed 
by the oldest dam, have fought 
the project. Without the dam to 
create the reservoir, the residents 
say their countryside waterfront 
properties will become mudflats. Counties without COVID-19 are 
mostly rural, poor
Data compiled by Johns Hopkins 
University shows 1,297 counties 
have no confirmed cases of 
COVID-19 out of 3,142 counties 
nationwide. Of the counties 
without positive tests, 85 percent 
are in rural areas — from 
predominantly white communities 
in Appalachia and the Great 
Plains to majority Hispanic and 
Native American stretches of 
the American Southwest — that 
generally have less everyday 
contact between people who can 
transmit the virus. Experts see 
an opportunity in slowing the 
spread of COVID-19 in remote 
areas of the country that benefit 
from “natural” social distancing 
and isolation if initial cases 
are detected and quarantined 
aggressively. That can buy rural 
health care networks time to 
provide robust care and reduce 
mortality. However, professors 
and experts have mentioned that 
counties that have zero confirmed 
COVID-19 cases could raise a red 
flag about inadequate testing.
Relief package billions can’t buy 
hospitals out of shortages
The billions of tax dollars headed 
for hospitals and states as part 
of the $2.2 trillion COVID-19 
response bill won’t fix the problem 
facing doctors and nurses: a critical 
shortage of protective gowns, 
gloves and masks. Hospitals, state 
governments and the Federal 
Emergency Management Agency 
are left bidding against each 
other and driving up prices. Even 
if someone took some of this 
money and built the equipment to 
make masks, gowns and gloves, 
it would not solve the problem 
because none of the materials are 
made in the United States, said 
Virginia’s secretary of finance, 
Aubrey Layne. That includes latex 
and rubber, largely from Southeast 
Asia, as well as textiles used in 
surgical gowns that can repel 
fluids but are easily disposable. 
Imports of critical medical 
supplies were plummeting due to 
factory closures in China, where 
manufacturers had been required 
to sell all or part of their goods 
internally rather than export to other countries. No medical-grade 
N95 masks, made almost entirely 
in China, have arrived at U.S. 
ports so far this month.
Sweden is outlier in virus 
restrictions
After a long, dark Scandinavian 
winter, the COVID-19 pandemic is 
not keeping Swedes at home even 
while citizens in many parts of the 
world are sheltering in place and 
won’t find shops or restaurants 
open on the few occasions they are 
permitted to venture out. Swedish 
authorities have advised the 
public to practice social distancing 
and to work from home, if 
possible, and urged those over age 
70 to self-isolate as a precaution. 
Yet compared to the lockdowns 
imposed elsewhere in the world, 
the government’s response to the 
virus allows a liberal amount of 
personal freedom. Prime Minister 
Stefan Lofven, warning of “many 
tough weeks and months ahead,” 
announced Friday that as of 
Sunday, gatherings would be 
limited to 50 people instead of 
500. But some scientists have 
criticized the Swedish Public 
Health Agency’s approach as 
irresponsible during a worldwide 
pandemic that has already killed 
more than 21,000 people in 
Europe.
Joseph Lowery, civil rights leader 
and MLK aide, dies at 98
Joseph Lowery, 98, died Friday 
at home in Atlanta, Georgia, 
from natural causes unrelated to 
COVID-19, family members said 
in a statement. Lowery fought 
to end segregation, lived to see 
the election of the country’s first 
black president and echoed the 
call for “justice to roll down like 
waters and righteousness like 
a mighty stream” in the United 
States. Lowery led the Southern 
Christian Leadership Conference 
for two decades — restoring the 
organization’s financial stability 
and pressuring businesses not 
to trade with South Africa’s 
apartheid-era regime — before 
retiring in 1997. In 2009, 
President Barack Obama awarded 
Lowery the Presidential Medal 
of Freedom, the nation’s highest 
civilian honor. Lowery was pastor 
of the Warren Street Methodist 
Church in Mobile, Alabama, in 
the 1950s when he met Martin 
Luther King Jr., who then lived in 
Montgomery, Alabama. Lowery’s 
meetings with King, the Rev. 
Ralph David Abernathy and other 
civil rights activists led to the 
Southern Christian Leadership 
Conference’s formation in 1957. 
The group became a leading force 
of the civil rights struggle of the 
1960s.VOLUME 114 ISSUE 73

THE EVENT WAS 
STREAMED ON ZOOM TO 
HUNDREDS OF FRIENDS 
AND FAMIL Y
By AJ Bafer
Alligator Staff Writer
COVID-19 has stopped people 
from going out, but it couldn’t stop 
Shmueli Goldman from having his 
bar mitzvah.
The 13-year-old Gainesville 
resident celebrated his coming-
of-age Thursday from the safety 
of his own home at the UF 
Lubavitch-Chabad Jewish Student 
& Community Center of Gainesville. 
His ceremony was streamed live on 
Zoom Video Communications to 
a few hundred friends and family 
who were social distancing.
Shmueli is one of eight children 
in his family. Even with so many 
siblings, he is the ﬁ  rst to have a 
virtual bar mitzvah, said Rabbi Berl 
Goldman, his father. Shmueli is used 
to virtual programs because he does 
online schooling at the Shluchim 
Online School, so he found using 
Zoom was not a problem for his bar 
mitzvah.
Before reciting Hebrew and 
feasting on a buffet of Chinese food, 
Berl recounted inspirational words 
from the Torah and acknowledged his son’s commitment to studying 
the Jewish laws he was now 
responsible for following the rest of 
his life. Shmueli’s mother, Chanie, 
praised his positive attitude and 
constant smile.
Shmueli’s other present relatives 
took turns greeting spectators and 
congratulating him — all with 
similar sentiments of compassion 
and bright hopes for his future.
Online attendees celebrated in 
the  Zoom chat as Shmueli danced 
and was paraded around the room 
on the shoulders of his family 
members after he spent about eight 
minutes reciting the Jewish laws 
he studied from memory, in both 
Hebrew and Yiddish.
“Now that I’ve actually done it, 
it’s such a relief,” Shmueli said. 
Those viewing remotely 
answered trivia questions about 
Shmueli, like what his favorite 
sport and favorite subject in school 
were. The invested viewers — from 
Gainesville locals to relatives far off 
in New York, Illinois and California 
— correctly answered baseball and 
Halakha, or Jewish law, almost 
instantly. 
Many messaged “mazal tov” in 
good faith using Zoom’s chat feature 
and in anticipation of Shmueli’s 
ﬁ  nal remarks, where he recalled 
the hardships of Jewish history 
while encouraging his loved ones to remain calm in chaotic times. 
He expressed his faith and thanked 
everyone for showing up virtually, 
blessing people around the world 
with health, prosperity, peace and 
strength.
Even though he couldn’t 
complete the ceremony in-person 
with friends, he said he felt 
accomplished and happy that they 
were able to tune in.
“It lifted my spirits when I heard 
that you guys all would come,” he 
said.
The stream ended at 8:30 p.m. 
and his father’s ﬁ  nal request was 
that viewers stand up and dance. 
Realizing he forgot one ﬁ  nal detail, 
Shmueli signed off with a hearty 
“Go Gators!”
They decided to postpone 
in-person celebrations because 
of global health concerns from 
COVID-19, Berl said, but he did 
not want to keep his son from 
experiencing the full celebration 
aspect of his bar mitzvah. He said 
they are looking to reschedule it as 
soon as possible, possibly in the 
summer. 
“The need for love, connection 
and inspiration is ever more present 
and necessary,” he said.

LIVE STREAMS AND 
ALCOHOL DELIVERIES IN THE 
NAME OF LOCAL VENUES
By Chloe Greenberg
Avenue Staff Writer
The COVID-19 outbreak has left 
Gainesville music venues with empty 
stages. 
The pandemic has caused a 
halt in independent local music 
scenes, leaving entertainers and 
musicians uncertain about the future. 
Navigating this unpredictable time 
alongside the artists is the music 
venues that provide the lights, stage 
and community that allow performers 
to perform and musicians to be heard. 
Due to health concerns, a Florida-
wide executive order to close all 
food and beverage establishments 
and artists halting their tours or 
canceling gigs, local venues are 
facing unprecedented times — and 
are looking to the community for 
help.
Pat Lavery, High Dive’s facility 
and events manager, said that 
with unavoidable expenses and no 
income, the only way he can see High 
Dive surviving is through community 
support. 
“If High Dive is important to 
people and they want to see a 
dedicated, thriving music venue 
in town, bringing in bigger tours 
and also giving local bands and 
comedians and all sorts of other 
different performers a platform…
then we’re really going to need that 
support from the community to keep 
going,” he said.
From showcasing national acts, 
local artists and everything in 
between, High Dive has acted as one 
of Gainesville’s strongest links to the 
entertainment world for years. Lavery 
said the venue had a lot planned for 
the spring and hopes to continue 
producing shows once open again. 
“Once we get reopened, it’s going 
to take a lot of quick action from 
the community – from the artist 
community – for us to get new events 
onboard,” he said.
In the meantime, Lavery said, 
the venue has launched several 
fundraising avenues, including a 
GoFundMe page and a season pass. 
The pay-what-you-want season 
pass starts at $59 and is a one-time 
payment that gives access to all 
summer 2020 shows at High Dive. Teaming up with Five Star Pizza, 
High Dive is also offering a pizza 
and alcohol delivery service within 
a ﬁ  ve-mile radius of downtown. All 
proceeds from fundraising efforts go 
toward the reopening of High Dive 
and supporting staff. 
“I can’t stress enough how dire 
the situation is for venues like us 
and other venues,” Lavery said.  
“Really, the only way we get money 
is that people are in the building and 
that’s impossible right now. It’s very 
difﬁ  cult.”
The Wooly, a local music venue 
and event hall, is focusing on 
encouraging community support 
while its events calendar has been 
wiped clean, said Bailey Bruce, events 
director. She said the downtown 
Gainesville venue’s peak season is 
March through May, with weddings, 
parties, concerts and dance nights.
“It’s heartbreaking,” Bruce wrote 
in an email. “We love our jobs and 
it’s very disheartening how quickly 
our day-to-day has changed right 
now.” 
Bruce said the venue is asking 
for online support. She invites 
the community to like the venue 
Facebook page, leave an online 
review, interact with its social media 
accounts and continue to book events 
for future dates.
“My most pressing hope is that 
inquiries start coming in again,” 
Bruce said. “This time of year I am 
normally answering inquiries for 
eight hours a day. However, we are 
still here and looking to the future and know this pandemic will not last 
forever.”
Heartwood Soundstage, 
Gainesville’s fusion between a 
live music venue and a video and 
streaming production studio, is 
not only trying to support itself but 
musicians as well, said Dave Melosh, 
one of the owners. 
The venue hosted a virtual live 
music event March 20, in which over 
$900 was raised, all of which went to 
the artists, Melosh said.
“I think it’s really important that 
we’re supporting the artists that 
support us,” he said. 
While the venue was live 
streaming shows before its closure, 
it’s now exclusively streaming 
events that haven’t been canceled or 
rescheduled for a pay-what-you-want 
rate, Melosh said. 
The venue’s streaming abilities 
have led to its partnership with UF 
Health Shands Arts in Medicine 
to produce videos of artists who 
typically would be performing for 
patients and can no longer do so. 
“This is a very challenging time 
for most people,” Melosh said. “But 
also a time that people are able to 
reﬂ  ect on what’s important to them 
and also how important music and 
art is to everyone’s day-to-day life. 
Sometimes that’s taken for granted.”

Weird couple of weeks, 
huh? 
I’ll start off by saying I 
hope everyone is staying 
safe and healthy during 
these trying times. 
Obviously, it’s important 
everyone is complying 
with recommendations 
and mandates to protect 
yourself and those around 
you. That’s where the 
concept at the forefront 
of everyone’s mind comes 
into play: self-isolation, 
quarantining and social 
distancing. 
This week, I was 
curious as to what our 
students have been doing 
during this time of social 
distancing and how 
that has had an effect 
on their relationships. 
I caught up with Sam 
Johnson, an 18-year-old 
UF exploratory freshman 
whose parents live in 
Atlanta. A few weeks ago, 
she made the four hour 
drive home to be with 
them as she self-isolates.
“It’s been so weird to 
go from everyday life, 
where I’m constantly 
around other people, to 
being mostly by myself 
at home. I don’t have 
siblings and lived far 
away from my friends 
growing up, so being in 
close proximity to the 
people I’m close to was 
one of the things I enjoy 
the most about college,” 
she said. “To lose that, 
on top of the added stress 
of the circumstances, is 
definitely difficult.”
There is no doubt Sam 
is not alone in this feeling. 
For so many, Gainesville 
is a home base for 
relationships and social 
togetherness. Countless 
romantic relationships are born and flourish 
every year in the city and 
university. Having to go 
“home,” while not an 
option for some, can be a 
hindrance in the  realm of 
relationships. 
Scott Shanbom, 
a 20-year-old UF 
zoology junior, said his 
relationship has felt the 
effects of these current 
times.
“I’ve had to go home 
early, so now we aren’t 
going to see each other for 
quite a while. We still talk 
every day, so it isn’t too 
bad right now. But if this 
goes on for a long time, 
it could get quite a bit 
worse,” he said. “We’ve 
spent whole summers 
apart before, so we 
aren’t strangers to being 
apart for several months. 
It’s tough, but we’ll get 
through it like we have in 
the past.”
While social 
distancing is a must, so 
is communication. For 
Scott, it doesn’t have to 
be anything grand. Just 
checking in and showing 
you care can be more than 
enough.
“By keeping up with 
what’s going on in the 
other person’s life, it 
helps to remove a little bit 
of the distance,” Shanbom 
said.
Alright, bear with 
me, but here’s a cheesy 
take: Whether it’s your 
partner, your friends or 
your family, take this 
time to reach out and 
tell the people in your 
life that you love them. 
The physical distance can 
be far less daunting by 
becoming closer through 
communication and 
connection. 
Stay safe and stay sexy.

Health Affairs Dr. David Nelson. 
Memmbers of UF faculty and the 
UF Board of Trustees met Friday 
during their quarterly meeting to 
discuss university responses to the 
pandemic. 
The meeting was held in person 
— despite county orders to shelter 
in place — with several attendees 
appearing over Zoom Video 
Communications. UF President 
Kent Fuchs and Vice Presidents 
Tom Mitchell, Elias Eldayrie, 
D’Andra Mull, Mark Kaplan and 
Amy Hass were among those who 
attended the meeting in person. 
“The chairman felt a physical 
presence of leadership would 
send a message of continuity and 
reassurance that the university 
continues to fulﬁ  ll its critical 
and essential mission,” said UF 
spokesperson Steve Orlando.
All who attended practiced social 
distancing, he said. It is unknown if 
they were six feet apart.
Students who formally checked 
out of their on-campus housing 
before March 24 will be offered 
a housing refund based on their 
checkout date, according to an 
announcement made Friday. 
Students who stopped using 
their meal plan before March 23 
will also receive a refund for the 
unused portion of their meal plan, 
including ﬂ  ex bucks.
These refunds will be distributed 
to students’ accounts, according to 
the announcement. The move to 
refund students was mentioned 
brieﬂ  y at Friday’s meeting, but the 
audio connection was too poor to 
make out most of what was said.
UF will lose an estimated $33 
million due to student refunds, 
canceled performances, event 
contracts and university services, 
said Michael McKee, UF vice 
president, during the meeting. 
UF’s Emerging Pathogens 
Institute has developed two new treatments that will soon be tested: 
one to combat COVID-19 in patients 
who already have it and another 
to prevent uninfected people from 
catching it, Nelson said.  
Testing was approved 
Wednesday and will begin in the 
coming days, Nelson said. He said 
he is hopeful the preventative 
treatment can reduce the risk of 
health care providers catching the 
virus.
During the last week, he said 
more than 100 students and faculty 
have also volunteered to staff 
outdoor clinics in The Villages, a 
nearby retirement community of 
around 130,000 people. 
But some UF faculty and students 
have had difﬁ  culty accessing tests. 
Others who have been tested said 
they waited up to four days for test 
results. 
Clinical psychologists will begin 
tele-health conferences with UF 
Health employees who Nelson said 
are on the “front-line” of action 
and are experiencing great mental 
stress because of it. The College 
of Liberal Arts and Sciences and 
UF Information Technologies have 
donated webcams to increase UF 
Health’s tele-health capacity.
Music students adjust to 
online classes
Zoe Stayman is worried the 
French horn skills she’s cultivated 
all her life will be lost to online 
classes.
Stayman, 21, is just one of many 
UF School of Music students in the 
midst of transitioning to all online 
classes and trying to establish a 
sense of normalcy hundreds of 
miles away from her instruments at 
college.
“The point of it is to be playing,” 
the UF music education junior said. 
UF typically offers students 
access to more than 200 musical 
instruments, said Angela Jonas, 
a UF administrative support 
assistant. But now, that resource has been temporarily suspended 
due to COVID-19 concerns.
Stayman, who is enrolled in 
mostly performance-based classes 
such as instrumental conducting 
and materials and symphonic band, 
said it’s been an immense challenge 
to transition online. Although each 
student still receives private lessons 
over Zoom, she said her 70-person 
ensemble has been one of the 
most difﬁ  cult classes because it 
relies on collaboration with other 
classmates.
 Over video, the program can 
detect some music as background 
noise; therefore, some of her peers’ 
music is drowned out, especially 
with the larger classes. 
Kevin Casseday, a UF bass 
lecturer, said his biggest concern 
right now is for the students’ health 
and their families. 
He hopes his students can turn to 
their love for music during this time 
of uncertainty and urges students 
who have their own instruments to 
practice. 
“Even if it’s just an hour, make 
that time for yourself and take that 
break,” Casseday said. 
Gainesville bars, restaurants 
temporarily forced to 
stop selling to-go cocktails
Bar owner T.J. Palmieri, 39, 
was close to rehiring three people 
from his 10-person crew. But after 
his business was reprimanded, he 
thought he had no choice but to 
shut down.
On Wednesday, local restaurants 
and bars were threatened by 
the Florida Division of Alcoholic 
Beverages and Tobacco with a 
$1,000 ﬁ  ne per drink if they sold 
to-go cocktails. This conﬂ  icted 
with Gov. Ron DeSantis’ overriding 
executive order, which stated 
that “vendors may continue to 
sell alcoholic beverages in sealed 
containers for consumption off-
premises.”
“It feels like we’re being picked 
on,” Palmieri said, the owner of 
cocktail bar Madrina’s in downtown 
Gainesville.The division directed an 
Alligator reporter to the Tallahassee 
ofﬁ  ce for comment, and the state 
division was unavailable as of 
Sunday afternoon after numerous 
attempts to contact them.
A division inspector told 
Palmieri he was violating the order 
and he didn’t have a manufacturing 
license to sell the cocktails in 
containers.
“It’s kind of crazy that I was 
given this document that says I was 
violating the order by doing exactly 
what the order had intended,” 
Palmieri said.
Ken Peng, 34, the creator of the 
food blog Ken Eats Gainesville, said he has been updating the 
community on the restaurant 
industry during COVID-19. 
Thursday evening, he announced 
that the division was rethinking 
its policies after meeting with the 
governor.
Now, the division is letting 
restaurants sell alcoholic beverages 
in any type of container.
“I’m really ﬂ  abbergasted by the 
whole situation,” Peng said.
Stephany Matat, Alex DeLuca, 
Samantha Chery, Hannah Phillips 
and Ariana Aspuru contributed to 
this report. COVID-19,  from pg. 1UF lost about $33 million
Screenshot from Facebook
Madrina’s, a bar located in downtown Gainesville, advertised its to-
go cocktails on Facebook Thursday. An executive order from Gov. 
Ron DeSantis stated that restaurants and bars could sell sealed 
alcoholic beverages to-go in order to stay ﬁ  nancially aﬂ  oat.

A MESSAGE FROM THE EDITORS:AN ALLIGATOR SPORTS SERIES
River Wells
Sports Writer
Editor's note: this article is 
part of alligatorSports' "Best 
Game I Ever..." series in which 
writers are recounting either the 
best game they ever saw live or 
the best game they ever covered.
Hope is a funny thing, isn’t it?
How we latch on to it at any 
given moment. Even when there 
hasn’t been anything to look for-
ward to, we can always hope. And 
sometimes, despite the fact that 
gloom has prevailed time and time 
again and history tells us not to get 
burned by it, we still ﬁ  nd ourselves 
with a sliver of it.
On Nov. 27, 2016, I felt hope. 
And as a Tampa Bay Buccaneers 
fan, I don’t feel it often.
The Buccaneers had won two 
games in a row and were set to 
defend Raymond James Stadium 
against the then-7-2-1 Seattle Se-
ahawks. They were one of the best 
teams in football, and so when I 
hopped in my mom’s car and we 
drove to that game from our house 
in St. Petersburg, I certainly didn’t 
think we were going to topple the 
juggernauts from Washington, 
even on our home turf.
And then Mike Evans scored 
two touchdowns in the ﬁ  rst quar-
ter, one from three yards out and 
one from 23 yards out when he 
burned Richard Sherman on a 
lob pass. The Seahawks respond-ed with a ﬁ  eld goal and a safety, 
bringing the score to 14-5.
Seattle looked to get some 
points before halftime, but corner-
back Alterraun Verner, who was 
starting in the game two days af-
ter his father had died, picked off 
quarterback Russell Wilson at the 
end of the half to ensure that the 
Seahawks would go back to their 
locker room without a hurrah. 
It was the best game Tampa 
had played all year up to that point. 
I had hope, but in the second half, 
a drop of doubt seeped into it like 
poison.
The Bucs offense was strug-
gling. It wouldn’t put any more 
points on the board, and every 
three-and-out left one of the most 
dangerous teams in the league 
more time than it needed to start a 
comeback, something I’d seen far 
too many times in the Bucs games 
I’ve attended as a season-ticket 
holder.
But this time was different. 
The defense played lights-out 
in the second half. Safety Bradley 
McDougald (who would be a Se-
ahawk the following year) picked 
Wilson off again. During what 
looked to be a promising fourth-
quarter drive, linebacker Lavonte 
David scooped up a fumble and re-
turned it for 53 yards. Tampa Bay’s 
offense may have stagnated, but 
Seattle’s had been stiﬂ  ed entirely.
The score didn’t move from 
there. Once the clock hit zero, 
the Buccaneers had defeated the Seahawks 14-5. The win bumped 
them up to a winning record (6-5), 
and they had won three consecu-
tive games for the ﬁ  rst time in three 
years. I’ll never forget the fervent 
cheers of “Tampa… Bay!” in the 
stadium as both teams trotted off 
the ﬁ  eld, or how they continued 
as we walked down the ramp and 
into the parking lot.
Even on the way home, I think 
my mom and I threw a few chants 
out here and there amongst the ca-
dence of the post-game radio show.
The success wouldn’t last. Af-
ter winning the next two games 
to move up to 8-5 and possibly a 
playoff spot, the Bucs lost the next 
two and all but eliminated them-
selves by the time they won their 
last game against the Panthers to 
end with a winning record.
It would eventually deteriorate 
and collapse, like all Bucs seasons 
tend to do. But for one night as I 
walked down the ramp of Ray-
mond James stadium and I let the 
chants run through my ears like a 
symphony, I felt that hope.
Despite everything I’d known. 
Despite the past. Despite the fact 
that I shouldn’t have been, I was 
grinning wider than I’d ever been 
at a football stadium. For the ﬁ  rst 
time in my memory, Raymond 
James had come alive.
Hope is a funny thing.
Isn’t it?
