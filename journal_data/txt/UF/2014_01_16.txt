Bikers on campus have a new 
obstacle to avoid — Krishna 
Lunchers.
Krishna Lunch moved from 
the grassy area of the Plaza of the 
Americas to the bike lanes near 
Peabody Hall. 
Hanan Schwefel, manager of 
Krishna Lunch, said the move was a combined decision between Krishna Lunch and UF.
“We asked to be moved here be-
cause there are many places to sit, and it’s a place we used to serve in the past,” Schwefel said.
He said the group served near 
Peabody Hall ﬁ  ve years ago, be-fore they moved to the opposite 
side of the plaza. 
The new location is more effec-
tive for both students and Krishna Lunch employees, he said.
The bike lanes adjacent to Li-
brary West offer more seating and 
a larger layout than the grass on the plaza, Schwefel said.
“I deﬁ  nitely hear that people 
like it because there is space to sit,” he said. 
The seating increase also means 
there is no longer a need for Krish-na’s signature green chairs. 
“For us, it’s less work because 
we used to bring the green chairs, some 100 chairs,” Schwefel  said. “By moving back here, we don’t have to carry those anymore.” 
However, at ﬁ  rst, University 
Police was concerned about the 
safety hazards of moving the lunch 
so close to a major student trafﬁ  c area, said Capt. Jeff Holcomb.“The location they moved to 
was near student trafﬁ  c areas,” he said. “We requested that they move (again) in order to avoid any trafﬁ  c and safety concerns.” 
Schwefel said the group com-
plied and moved farther from the sidewalk. 
Still, some are worried about 
the effects of the move on the ar-ea’s trafﬁ  c pattern.
Reynaldo Calzadilla, a 20-year-
old UF computer science sopho-more, said the crowds can make Krishna Lunch moves twice, now near bike lanes

A Santa Fe College student was arrested 
Wednesday on a felony charge and held in 
jail with a $15,000 bond after police said he tried to shoot a BB gun at a security guard.Gainesville Police ofﬁ  cers arrested busi-
ness freshman Matthew Moss Lockwood, 20, on charges of shooting a deadly missile into a vehicle, according to an arrest report.
At about 11:40 p.m., a security guard at 
The Woodlands of Gainesville Apartments 
was getting out of his car near building 12 
when he heard a pop followed by the sound 
of an object zipping by his head, according 
to the report. He ducked, then heard another 
shot.The guard pointed his 
ﬂ  ashlight in the direction of 
the shots, but he didn’t see anyone suspicious. Ofﬁ  cers 
came to the complex and 
narrowed suspects down.
During questioning, 
Lockwood said he shot the 
BB gun, according to the 
report. He told ofﬁ  cers he was ﬁ  ring shots at a stop sign from the balcony, and he didn’t see the guard.
Ofﬁ  cers noted the stop sign was about 25 
feet away from where the guard parked his 
car, and they saw several small dings on the 
sign, according to the report. The guard said 
he felt the shots were intentionally ﬁ  red at 
him, but ofﬁ  cers did not see any marks on his 
car.
Lockwood was booked into the Alachua 
County Jail at about 1:15 a.m. He was released 
later that afternoon after meeting bond.Santa Fe student arrested for shooting BB gun at Woodlands guard“We asked to be moved

Police responded to an emergency phone call 
Wednesday night after a transformer blew in down-
town Gainesville, leaving more than 400 Gainesville Regional Utilities customers without power.
The explosion occurred at about 9:40 p.m. at the cor-
ner of Northwest First Avenue and Northwest Second Street near the Wells Fargo parking garage.
The outage affected four blocks south and three 
blocks west of the intersection, said Gainesville Fire Rescue Lt. Willie Saulsberry.
Gainesville Regional Utilities was called to the scene 
immediately, Saulsberry said. 
Power was out for almost an hour before the compa-
ny was able to restore electricity to the affected areas.
Gainesville resident Charles Rye said he saw the ex-
plosion and called 911.
“I was just parking my car, and then I saw the street 
explode,” said Rye, who was on his way to trivia night at a local restaurant with his friends. Transformer blows,

People who remember to grab 
their daily lattes may remember 
more in general.
A new study from The 
Johns Hopkins University found caffeine helped boost the memory of 160 participants.
“The motivation was really 
trying to bring scientific rigor to something that typically hasn’t been studied with the same level of rigor,” said Michael Yassa, 
one of the study’s researchers.
The researchers discovered 
that people who were given 
a caffeine tablet five minutes before they looked at a series 
of images were more likely to 
correctly identify the images 24 hours later.  
Divya Jolly, a 19-year-old 
UF behavioral and cognitive neuroscience junior, said she 
was surprised by the results 
even though she’s an avid coffee drinker.
“I use coffee as a crutch to 
keep me awake at all times,” she said. “I keep more alert when I’m studying, which helps me 
retain more.”
However, Yassa said the 
implications of the study for 
students aren’t all positive.
 “Coffee is taken also to put 
off sleep or to even pull off an all-nighter and not sleep at all for an exam,” he said.
Yassa stressed that swapping 
coffee for sleep can be an ineffective long-term method.
“That can be detrimental 
because what we also know from the literature is that sleep 
is very helpful for memory and 
that sleep deprivation is very bad for memory,” he said.THURSDAY, JANUARY  16, 2014 � ALLIGATOR, 3

Americans don’t seem to connect with 
their Internet service providers.
A recent survey from the American Cus-
tomer Satisfaction index ranked Internet 
service providers at the bottom of the barrel 
compared with other industries, including 
gas stations, banks and health insurance. 
In Gainesville, some residents are inclined 
to agree with the results, and a local ISP of-fered possible reasons why.
Jessica Lennon, a UF advertising junior, 
said she isn’t surprised with the results because she’s experienced problems with  Gainesville’s most prominent provider: Cox 
Communications.“I’ve had some issues with power outag-
es and their service. They’re helpful when it 
happens, but it happens a lot,” she said, add-ing that the price is too expensive for college students.
Lennon, 22, said she 
hasn’t completely writ-ten off the company, but she described her service 
as “mediocre,” which the 
survey provided as a rea-son for dissatisfaction.
The survey stated that, 
according to Internet us-ers, “The ISP industry 
does not deliver on any aspect of customer service in a particularly impressive fashion. ISPs struggle to keep service interruptions and outages to a minimum.”
However, Maureen Tartaglione, the man-
ager of government and community affairs for Cox Communications Southeast Region, said that often the issues users run into can be problems with bandwidth, which mea-sures the amount of data that can flow at once.
“If you’re in an area where there’s bulk 
Internet usage, it can affect you,” she said.
Carl Bauer, a 19-year-old UF biology 
freshman, said he understands that sharing bandwidth can often be a problem, and liv-ing in a dorm has allowed him to experience it firsthand.
“Usually it’s reliable,” he said. “It’s just 
that when everybody in the building is try-ing to watch Netflix at the same time, it’s dif-ficult.”
Dhwani Kumar, an 18-year-old UF biol-
ogy freshman, agreed and said in her dorm, the wireless Internet can be “iffy.”
“Especially during the evening time it’s 
pretty bad,” she said. “You get to work on your homework for some time and then you start doing tests, and it gets scary because all of the sudden it’ll kick you off.”   
Tartaglione said that Cox, which uses 
a “fiber-hybrid” system that runs a line straight from their building to each resident in their service area, is constantly making the effort to update its system.
“We’re always upgrading systems just 
because the demand is there for bandwidth,” she said. “We always want to be the fastest — we will spend whatever it takes.”

Students preparing for the Spring start of 
GatorNights should note a time change. 
The Friday night alternative for students 
will now start at 8 p.m., a change from the 
previous 6:30 p.m. start time.
“We changed the time of the event to 
provide a better experience for the students 
who come,” said GatorNights program co-
ordinator Joshua Wilson.GatorNights, free for students with their 
Gator 1 Cards, is a series of events on Friday nights in the Reitz Union where students 
can watch movies, enjoy midnight munchies 
and take part in interactive art activities.
“The later time now allows students to 
come to the event and enjoy all of the perks,” 
said Wilson.
Each week, about 1,500 students attend 
GatorNights.
Nicole Lopez, a 19-year-old UF health 
science sophomore, said she tries to attend GatorNights occasionally throughout the 
semester.
“The time change can be a good thing for 
students still getting out of later classes,” she said.
GatorNights regular Tatiana Recicar, an 
18-year-old UF animal sciences freshman, 
said she prefers a later start time for the 
event.
“I have more time to get to GatorNights 
because I have class that ends late,” she said.GatorNights now LaterNights, will start at 8

A local organization protest-
ed outside a Gainesville-based 
robotics company Wednesday in 
response to the U.S. Army award-
ing the business millions of dol-lars for drone development.
In recognition of the Rev. Dr. 
Martin Luther King Jr.’s 85th birthday, the Gainesville Coali-tion for Peace set out to raise awareness about what members believe is misallocated taxpayer 
money being spent on military 
projects instead of community betterment. 
The protest began at about 11 
a.m. outside of Prioria Robotics,  located at 606 SE Depot Ave. 
Participants walked on the 
sidewalk with signs chanting, “Hey hey, ho ho, killer drones 
have to go.”
Cassandra Morrison, a tutor 
at Circle of Love Tutoring Ser-
vices and a member of the coali-
tion, said the dollars could go a 
long way in helping members of 
the community, like students.
“Many of my (students) 
are going without,” she said. 
“They’re hungry, and they don’t have the skills they need.”
Morrison said they chose to 
protest on King’s birthday be-cause it would have been impor-tant to him, had he been alive today.
“This was a man that was 
against war, and he chose peace-ful means to make sure his mes-
sage got across,” Morrison said. 
Prioria Robotics has tried to 
reach out to the coalition, said 
company CEO Bryan da Frota. 
The group was invited to dis-
cuss the issue.
But members did not want to 
participate.
In the almost 11 years that the 
company has been in Gainesville, da Frota said, it has put more than $20 million back into the lo-cal economy.
The coalition is trying to make it seem as if Prioria is not wanted 
in the area, he said.
But da Frota noted that the 
residents allowed the company 
to be in Gainesville in the first place.
“The community had a dis-
cussion as to whether we were going to be here, and they said yes,” da Frota said. “I think the 
city agrees. I think the people 
agree.”
However, protesters still 
think the money could be used elsewhere. 
“There’s literally millions of 
federal dollars going towards making drones,” said UF English sophomore Farah Khan. “Money 
could be going towards working 
families who aren’t able to put food on the table.”
For Khan, the issue is also a 
personal one. 
As a Pakistani, she said she’s 
worried about her family living in Pakistan because the country has experienced numerous drone 
attacks. 
“It’s a really dehumanizing 
process,” she said. 
Prioria Robotics moved into 
its current loation, a former GRU warehouse on Depot Avenue, in 
February. 
It has operated in Gainesville 
for about 10 years.Locals protest drone development
� OPEN DATA DAY IS FEB. 22.

Gainesville now has a one-stop 
website for residents to access its 
data.
The city’s Open Data portal, which 
officially launched Tuesday, allows 
the public to access datasets of infor-
mation, ranging from city budgets to Gainesville’s utility consumption.
Becky Rountree, the city’s admin-
istrative services director, said the app is meant to provide raw data to the public.
“There’s a wealth of information 
in (the portal), and it is meant to pro-
vide citizens with this data, and they can use the data in whatever way it 
meets their needs,” Rountree said.
Data will be uploaded to the por-
tal monthly, quarterly and annually, depending on when information is made available, Rountree said.
The app is the first phase of the 
city’s Government 2.0 initiative, which aims to create more govern-ment transparency, said City Com-missioner Lauren Poe. 
The initiative is focused on open-
ing up vast amounts of data collected by the government and making it ac-cessible to members of the commu-nity, Poe said.
“We’re really excited about this 
in Gainesville. We have the perfect community to take ownership of the Open Government initiative,” Poe said, adding the city is deeming Feb. 22 “Open Data Day.”
Madalina Mottl, a 23-year-old UF 
telecommunication and political sci-ence senior and former intern for U.S. Rep. Ted Yoho, said she recognizes both the positives and negatives of the portal.
“I can see how this would be good 
for the city of Gainesville,” Mottl said. “It allows people to be really informed about government spend-ing.”
However, she said she acknowl-
edges a downside of transparency as well. 
“The negative side of it is that 
people are not going to like what they see,” Mottl said. “Some people will just see the front number but not really dig into what the money and finances are going towards.”City launches open data websitePedestrians display

“I usually go by on my skateboard, but it’s gotten harder 
for me to do that without people cutting in front of me,” he 
said. “I almost fell off. It was really frustrating.”
Meanwhile, students like Sirah Mora, a 19-year-old UF 
international studies sophomore, seemed willing to adjust to 
the change.
“I do drive my bike around that area sometimes to get to 
class,” she said. “It was a little annoying at first because the

As residents bundle up to escape the low 
temperatures, farmers are worried less about 
themselves and more about their crops.
John Steyer, 77, owner of Little Bit Nurs-
ery in Starke, said his crops were severely 
damaged last week when the temperature 
dropped dozens of degrees in one day.“We knew ahead of time, of course,” 
Steyer said. “We covered crops. We froze the fields. But we still had extensive damage.”
He said all of his plants in the field were 
damaged by the cold and are now infected by fungi.
The lack of sun will likely kill infected 
plants in a few days, he said. 
Steyer said he also noticed a recent decline 
in vendors at the weekly Alachua County Farmers’ Market where he sells produce. 
“I don’t think there is a farmer out there 
who wasn’t affected by this cold front,” Steyer said.
Jeff Huffman, WUFT chief meteorologist, 
said the cold snap is because of a jet stream, which is a river of air that steers storm sys-tems.
This year, systems were driven unusu-
ally far to the south, he said.
Farmers are advised to pay close atten-
tion to the news and use overhead sprinkler irrigation, said Daniel Dourte, research asso-ciate for the UF Department of Agricultural and Biological Engineering. 
The sprinklers cause the plants to freeze, 
preventing further damage by trapping heat.       
Rebecca Tate, a massage student who 
helps Steyer with his farm, said she thinks having enough people to lend a hand on the farm can also reduce damages.    
“Definitely be prepared and have more 
than one person to help out, because we lost a lot on the farm, and it significantly hurt the market,” Tate said.Local farmers’ crops suffering during cold weather snaps

UF Health Shands Chil-
dren’s Hospital took another 
step forward in its plan to improve care by opening a pe-diatric cardiac intensive care 
unit, or PCICU, last week. 
The administrative offices 
on the 10th floor of the hospi-
tal were transformed into the PCICU to specialize in patients with congenital heart disease.
Dr. F. Jay Fricker, the medi-
cal director of the UF Health Congenital Heart Center, said that before the PCICU opened, patients with congenital heart disease were treated in differ-ent parts of the hospital.
Now, Shands has a unit 
that can give the best care to 
patients in one place.  
“We want to take care of 
the most critically ill, complex 
patients with congenital heart disease in the state of Florida,” Fricker said.
At 18,000 square feet, the 
unit contains 23 private rooms, each with its own bathroom, 
shower, television and gam-
ing system.
Fricker said the new unit 
combines critical care and in-termediate care in one central location.
“We can increase the qual-
ity of care, decrease the mor-bidity rate and deliver first-rate care,” he said.
Currently, the first pediatric 
intensive care unit at Shands is under renovation, so the PCICU is providing intensive care to both general and car-diac patients temporarily. 
Fricker said he hopes to see 
the center grow and prosper 
in years to come.
“I think the vision for the 
heart center is that we keep 
growing and adding faculty who have expertise in the care of children,” Fricker said. 
As with many areas in the 
hospital, Fricker said the cen-ter was built with a theme in mind. For the PCICU, the focus is the sky and natural 
light. 
There are skylights and a 
view of Ben Hill Griffin Stadi-
um in the new unit to keep the patients hopeful and happy as they receive care.
“We call it the center of our 
universe,” Fricker said.
Hannah Asay, a 19-year-
old UF nursing sophomore, said she thinks the unit is a great idea.
“I think that a specializa-
tion in the cardiac area will heighten the survival rates for 
infants with heart disease,” 
she said.Pediatric cardiac ICU

A UF graduate is slicing into the 
film industry with a new film star-
ring Danny Trejo. 
Walter Boholst, writer and direc-
tor of the film “Voodoo Possession,” said his film features a hero who travels to a Haitian insane asylum in search of his missing brother. In the asylum, he finds the inmates and hospital administrator, played by Trejo, possessed by voodoo spirits. 
The movie, Boholst’s first major 
film, was released by Image Enter-tainment on home video Tuesday. The film is now available at Redbox, Walmart and Netflix.
It is a complex horror film that 
goes into different levels of the spirit world, said Boholst.
“We didn’t want to just do the 
same old thing,” he said. “If col-lege students watch a lot of horror, I hope that they will appreciate its approach.”
Boholst was able to snag Trejo for this film because of a connection be-tween Trejo and the producer of the film, he said. 
Boholst graduated from UF in 
1994 with a degree in marketing. He was president of the UF Filipino Stu-dent Association.
“UF taught me how to be a busi-

Gainesville Police arrested a local woman 
Monday after police said she tried to steal an-
other woman’s car and later led police on a chase in a stolen water delivery truck.
 Police arrested 33-year-old Melody Chrys-
tal Bull on charges of attempted carjacking, resisting an officer, habitually driving a car with a suspended license and hit and run.
 At about 3:30 p.m., a woman was walking 
to her car outside the Winn-Dixie located at 300 SW 16th Ave. when Bull approached her with her hand under her dress as if she were point-ing a gun, according to the report.
 “Give me your car 
keys,” Bull told the the woman, who replied: “No, my children need this car,” according to the report. A 
man in the parking lot noticed the two wom-en fighting and confronted them. The woman said Bull was trying to steal her car, but Bull said the car was hers. The man didn’t know who owned the 
car, so he asked them to give him the keys, according to the report. The woman agreed, but Bull took the key off the ring.
 A Winn-Dixie manager came outside and 
convinced Bull to give back the keys, accord-ing to the report. Bull then ran away through the parking lot.
 Moments later, she jacked a Culligan wa-
ter truck making a delivery at Oaks Pawn & Jewelry, located at 320 SW 16th Ave., said GPD spokesman Officer Ben Tobias. The manager of the store stood in front of the truck and waved his arms, but Bull drove at him.
 The manager jumped out of Bull’s way, 
and she struck his car as she drove away, spilling five-gallon water bottles out of the 
back of the truck, Tobias said. 
Officers followed the car but couldn’t stop 
Bull on Archer Road, Tobias said. A high-
speed chase began on Interstate 75 until she pulled over at mile marker 376.
 Officers booked Bull into jail at about 7:30 
p.m., where she remains as of press time in lieu of a $67,000 bond.

Offensive social media 
use still rampant
It’s 2014, and social media has such a pervasive inﬂ  u-
ence on modern life that the Modern Language Asso-
ciation created guidelines for citing tweets within aca-
demic papers. Home-improvement franchise Lowe’s uses Vine to produce six-second home-repair tutorials. And any 
individual — from unknown PR executives to UF football 
recruits — can be raked over the coals for posting offensive 
jokes online. 
In a New Yorker article, “First Thought, Worst Thought,” 
writer Mark O’Connell ruminates on social-media anxiety — ever posted what you thought was a funny Facebook status, received no likes and swiftly deleted the post? — 
and how a few keystrokes can smear a person’s name for 
good if that person isn’t smart enough to delete in time. 
He pointed to the brief Internet infamy of Justine Sacco, 
an ex-PR executive who, in December, tweeted “Going to Africa. Hope I don’t get AIDS. Just kidding! I’m white.” 
Predictably, people went insane. Even The New York 
Times covered the story of the smear campaign that result-
ed from her ill-fated, dumb joke, and Sacco was eventually 
ﬁ  red from her job. 
Closer to home, controversy erupted this week when 
the Alligator reported that UF quarterback Will Grier had 
posted a Vine last April in which he used multiple gay 
slurs in a locker room. 
People immediately jumped to Grier’s defense, saying 
that at the time of the Vine’s posting — it was deleted after 
alligatorSports published a column on Monday condemn-
ing Grier’s behavior — he was only in high school and that he shouldn’t be held accountable for something he said as a high school student. 
However, it’s not so much the fact that he said some-
thing offensive — it’s the fact that he posted it online. 
It’s impossible to give Grier the beneﬁ  t of the doubt and 
assume he doesn’t know that the word f** is rooted in a history of violence against gay people; he got into UF, after all. 
One can only hope he knows a thing or two about what 
you should and shouldn’t say as a prominent public ﬁ  g-
ure. 
New cautionary tales arise daily about the dangers of 
posting offensive jokes, personal information and ques-tionable photos on social media. 
In this age of instant public shaming as a result of idiotic 
Internet posts, how are high school kids and grown women 
not aware that their online actions have consequences?
“This is a new form of violence,” O’Connell wrote, “a 
symbolic ritual of erasure where the condemned is made to stand for a whole class of person — to be cast, as an ef-
ﬁ  gy of the world’s general awfulness, into a sudden abyss 
of fame.”
This is the world we live in, folks, and now more than 
ever, a good sense of tact is necessary for survival.Victim-blaming ignores race, poverty ties
A black, single mother works two jobs to make ends 
meet.
Her community, forsaken by politicians who 
swore to stand for her, is rotting. Good jobs are hard to ﬁ  nd when all the space around you is taken up by public 
housing, and it’s impossible to afford a car.
So she takes the train or the bus, adding more time to 
her commute. Her children, meanwhile, are left alone. 
There are no child care facilities in her impoverished neighborhood, much less any money to pay for them. 
Because of segregation that occurs in the nation’s larg-
est cities, most families around her are in the same situa-tion. With little income, there aren’t many taxes to go to schools or community programs, either.  
So her kids get a subpar education despite her two jobs. 
It’s hard to imagine her children would be very motivated after seeing their mom’s fate.
Thus, the cycle repeats. Race and poverty are tied to-
gether like proﬁ  t and exploitation.
African Americans have the second-highest rate of 
poverty behind American Indians at 25.8 percent. That’s one in four people. Meanwhile, the poverty rate for white people is only 11.6 percent, according to the U.S. Census 
Bureau. 
It shouldn’t be surprising, then, that 50 years after the 
March on Washington, the unemployment rate for black 
people has consistently been about double that of whites since 1954, the earliest year the Bureau of Labor Statistics has consistent data relating to race and unemployment.  
Many people don’t like these facts. Victim-blaming 
thrives in our culture, and it’s easy to blame the impov-erished for their misfortune from a position of power. 
They’ll pat themselves on the back for living in a country 
with a black president, calling the U.S. a post-racial society and quickly forgetting the birther movement that sprung up in the wake of his election.
But the problem isn’t a lack of work ethic among ethnic 
populations in the U.S. – it’s systemic racism that stops people from realizing their full potential. 
You see it in the disparity of education, the economic and geographic segregation and unemployment.
A study done by the National 
Bureau of Economic Research sheds light on the unemploy-
ment issue, titled “Are Emily 
and Greg more employable than Lakisha and Jamal?” The answer is a resounding yes.
Researchers responded to 
help wanted ads in Boston and Chicago with fake resumes that were identical except one thing — some ﬁ  ctitious ap-plicants had white-sounding names while others had black-sounding names. Resumes with white names had 50 
percent more callbacks than their black counterparts. 
All of this information begs the question: What is to be 
done?
When the war on poverty has become against the poor 
instead of against people being poor, there is a lot to be 
done.
We need to reform welfare. As it stands, families can 
lose beneﬁ  ts for having too much in savings — discourag-ing them from getting ahead. How can we expect people 
to lift themselves out of poverty if we destroy the bridge 
when they’re halfway across?
We need to fund education in these low-income areas. 
Rather than basing funding on performance, which will undoubtedly be worse in schools with fewer resources to begin with, we must give minority children access to the same programs that children privileged enough to go to schools in good neighborhoods have. 
Most importantly, we need to recognize as a nation that 
racism itself is a cause of poverty. We need to eliminate it, not just in the way we talk about things, but in prac-tice. Without racial discrimination, minorities will have greater access to jobs, geographic segregation will wane, and equality will ﬁ  nally mean something in the country supposedly built on the ideal.

A new exhibition is offering locals 
art they can sink their teeth into.
With the opening of their first 
Gainesville exhibition, Holographic 
Teeth, Steven Speir and Hilary White are transforming a hobby into a full-time job.
The two artists filled the gallery 
with a mix of colorful 2-D and 3-D pieces, reminiscent and inspired by graffiti.
The name, Holographic Teeth, par-
allels the type of artwork that was dis-
played throughout the reception. 
It will be on display through Jan. 
31 at the Full Circle Gallery at 10 NW 
Sixth St.
“Teeth are very visceral, but be-
cause something holographic isn’t even there, it sort of plays on spirit and body,” said White, a 30-year-old UF fine arts master’s student.
Speir, 33, said they both like incor-
porating bright colors into their art-work.
“I’m inspired by bright colors and 
color fields in general,” he said. 
Although the colors grab the view-
er’s attention, there is deeper meaning to their work.
“I’m trying to gather the subcon-
scious of the innocence of a childhood nightmare,” he said.
In their attempt to build an artistic 
community here in Gainesville out-side of the university, they have been working on small, side projects.
“I’ve been starting something on-
line where I’ve interviewed artists 
I’ve found in this community and vid-
eoed them,” White said. “It’s a small project I’m building up.”
Eventually, they would like to 
have a space where artists can come, perform and play music.
Zac Thompson, a 21-year-old UF 
fine arts senior, was at the exhibit’s opening and said he thought the duo 
complemented each other’s work.
“I think with everyone you can get 
a gut feeling about whether you like 
their work or not,” Thompson said, 
“and I really liked their work.”

Vinyl might be too mainstream.
Vinyl sales experienced an approximate 
32 percent increase from 4.55 million units 
in 2012 to 6 million units in 2013, according 
to Billboard. 
Meanwhile, CD sales experienced a 14.5 
percent decrease.
Digital track and album sales decreased 
for the first time since 2003, according to Billboard.
Two percent of total album sales in the 
United States is vinyl. 
But the significant increase in sales 
paired with the decrease in CD sales can be seen as an indicator of where the music in-dustry might be headed.
This most recent rise of the vinyl did not 
go unnoticed by local record store owner Andrew Schaer.
Schaer, the 37-year-old owner of Hear 
Again Music and Movies! located in down-town Gainesville, said he has seen a major 
increase in the store’s vinyl sales within the 
last year. 
He said he sees the increase as people 
recognizing that vinyl albums are the best way to experience music.
“All the little nuances in the album just 
come to life,” Schaer said.
Schaer said listening to vinyl is eye-
opening because the listener is able to ex-
perience all the details that get lost when a 
song is digitized and compressed.
Caleb German, 26, an employee at Hear 
Again, also prefers LP records to other means of listening to music.
“Unless,” he said, “I’m driving down 
the road.”
Schaer said he noticed consumers’ move-ment away from CDs and toward vinyl when he moved Hear Again to its current location at 201 SE First St. in 2009. 
During that move, he donated most of 
his CD inventory and switched to primarily carrying vinyl albums.
“I went from having 
a sinking ship to hav-ing a lucrative business,” 
Schaer said.
Schaer and German 
recognize that the price of 
new vinyl albums, which 
is generally higher than 
that of a new CD or digital album, does af-
fect sales. 
German said vinyl albums’ high costs 
are mainly a result of their fairly niche mar-
ket and high shipping costs caused by a 
lack of vinyl pressing plants.
However, Schaer said because new vinyl albums often come with a digital download 
of the album, the younger generation is at-
tracted to vinyl because they can have both a digital and an aesthetically pleasing phys-ical copy of the album.
Schaer said that people purchasing a 
physical medium of music at an increasing rate means  a path is being set that will lead to greater financial support for musicians.
To him, an increase in vinyl album sales 
reflects an increase in fans who care about the artists.
Neither Schaer nor German said they 
think this spike in LP sales is going to be a fading trend.
 Schaer said he doesn’t believe the LP 
will lose prominence anytime soon.
He said the record format has managed 
to stay around after each new technology 
introduced to the music industry faded 
away.
“I’m glad to see it (vinyl) back and peo-
ple focusing on quality over convenience again,” Schaer said.As vinyls make a comeback, locals notice the popularity

I was too depressingly excited for this 
movie. My nerves got the best of me as I was 
approaching the box office, and my hand started to shake in the realization that I was about to see Spike Jonze’s new movie. 
As the box office attendant looked at me 
and asked, “What movie, sir?” my words escaped me. I scrounged together some loose words, and what semi-coherently came from my mouth was: “I’ll do ‘Her’ at 10 p.m.”
I immediately face palmed.But what I soon came to realize was that 
“Her” wasn’t just another movie that is sim-ply just watched; “Her” isn’t an it, a you or an I. “Her” is a tangi-ble, living pronoun and an embodiment of love.
With every film Spike Jonze directs, 
whether it’s “Being John Malkovich,” “Ad-aptation,” or his new Golden Globe-win-ning “Her,” his films pose questions and 
deep philosophical questions that resonate 
with an audience. 
Set in futuristic Los Angeles, “Her” 
is about the life of Theodore Twombly (Joaquin Phoenix), a writer, a romantic, an ex-lover, now loner with a distinct fash-ion-conscious and particularly unnerving mustache. “Her” poses the head-bobbingly painful question: What is love?
Twombly is a recovering divorcee who 
works for a letter-writing company. He is a man without love until the day he buys Sa-mantha (Scarlett Johansson), an artificially intelligent operating system that fills his void of loneliness and inevitably shapes his life.
“Her,”  is a high-concept film that takes 
“guy meets girl,” a commonly recycled Hol-
lywood plot, and places it in the not-so-dis-
tant future as a tale of “guy meets technol-ogy.” Questioning whether an actual body is necessary in order to have the capacity for love, Samantha frequently struggles with the realization that she will never be a liv-ing entity. 
But what Samantha gives Twombly is 
something more than just companionship. 
She revives his soul and puts meaning back 
into his life despite the heartbreak that she will never exist as a human, but eternally as a voice inside the heads of many lonely men.
Despite the film being depressingly ab-
surdist, there are undercurrents of hope and comedic genius that shape this film into an overall pleasure to watch.8, ALLIGATOR � THURSDAY, JANUARY  16, 2014

I think my boyfriend might be cheating on me. Should I confront 
him, try to get proof or just break up with him? — AnonymousI’m pretty sure that someone stole some money from me. Actually 
a lot. I don’t really want to call the police. Should I confront the 
person? And if so, what do I say? — Anonymous
Where did you get this information from? Did you see it with your own eyes, or did 
someone else tell you so? If you answered yes to the former, leave him ASAP. 
Change his name in your contacts list to “Do Not Pick Up” because it’s over. You deserve far more than what you’re receiving from this relationship. If you answered yes to the lat-ter, you just might be in luck. Some people like to deny others’ happiness by making up untrue things, so in this instance, sit your boyfriend down and ﬁ  nd out the truth. If he says he didn’t do it and he has been trustworthy up to this point, you should probably give him the beneﬁ  t of the doubt. If he admits to being a jerk, leave his sorry ass now. This is a tough one because it’s gonna involve you making a decision that might 
cause you to lose that person in your life. But in all honesty, if they stole from 
you in the ﬁ  rst place, then screw them. If you’re somewhat close to this person, my advice would be to confront him or her about it because “pretty sure” doesn’t mean it’s 100 percent true. If the person you’re describing isn’t a friend, but a foe, and you’re not worried about what happens to them, report it as soon as possible. We have tuition and s*** to pay for. Ain’t nobody got time for that.GATORAID

As the first big awards show of the year, the Golden 
Globes showcased the typical red carpet fodder:  snubs, 
surprises and a lot of celebrities drinking.
As if they couldn’t solidify their places as Queens of 
Comedy — and the universe — any more, hosts Tina Fey and Amy Poehler nailed their opening bit. Fey and 
Poehler are truly some of the best hosts awards season 
has seen in years. They have been able to make the big-gest names laugh consistently — George Clooney jokes be damned. As one of my friends put it, they are to the Globes what Neil Patrick Harris is to the Tony Awards, and I couldn’t agree more.
Big winners of the night included Best Motion Pic-
ture, Comedy or Musical winner “American Hustle,” in 
which both lead and supporting actress trophies went 
to Amy Adams and Jennifer Lawrence, respectively.
Other notable victors included “Dallas Buyers 
Club”’s Matthew McConaughey and “Blue Jasmine”’s Cate Blanchett for Best Performances by an Actor and Actress in a Motion Picture, Drama, as well as “12 Years A Slave” for Best Motion Picture, Drama.
“Saturday Night Live” alums also won big. A sur-
prised Andy Samberg took home Best Performance by 
an Actor in a Television Series, Musical or Comedy for “Brooklyn Nine-Nine,” while Amy Poehler won her 
first Globe for “Parks And Recreation” after a quick make out sesh with Bono. Nope, not kidding.
As always, there were tons of memorable moments 
in this year’s telecast. Best Supporting Actor in a Mo-tion Picture winner Jared Leto mentioned his “tiny little Brazilian bubble butt” in his thanks, and Emma 
Thompson threw her shoes and sipped her drink with-
out any sort of care while presenting Best Screenplay.
Nerves were apparently a key factor in the accep-
tance speeches this year. From Jon Voight to Jennifer Lawrence, many seemed to have trouble behind the mi-crophone. Maybe it was the long and winding — and sometimes never-ending — path to the microphone that was partially to blame?
Apart from some teleprompter troubles — looking 
at you, Jonah Hill — and the occasional awkward ac-ceptance speech — does anyone even know how to describe that Jacqueline Bisset moment? — everything seemed to go smoothly. I mean, this is basically the pre-cursor to the Oscars, so we’ve got to get the funky stuff out of the way, right?

snubs or surprises? Tweet your thoughts to @Alliga-torAvenue. The next “Trophy Hunting” will cover the

Miley Cyrus is once again 
creating a massive buzz in the 
entertainment world, carrying 
her 2013 media domination into 
the new year. Announced last week, Cyrus is officially the face of Marc Jacobs’ spring 2014 cam-paign, a major collaboration for the 21-year-old “Bangerz” singer.
 Despite the excitement over 
the announcement, it has been no secret that Cyrus and Jacobs 
were connected. Beginning with 
her infamous black mesh gown at the May 2013 Met Gala, Cyrus has been sporting Jacobs’ pieces publicly for a while now. Al-though the announcement may have made sense to a lot of fash-ion insiders, the choice didn’t sit well with some.
Skeptics included Juergen 
Teller, Jacobs’ usual collabora-tor, who refused to photograph Cyrus.
“He just 
didn’t want 
to shoot her,” 
Jacobs told Women’s Wear Daily in an in-terview.
 Instead, Da-
vid Sims shot Cyrus. The photos, released by Nylon on Jan. 8, are edgy, dark and show Cyrus wear-
ing pieces from Jacobs’ forthcom-
ing spring line with a backdrop of what InStyle described as a “post-apocalyptic beach scene.” Styled in a moody, androgynous manner, Cyrus looks very far from her former Disney star per-sona in the new campaign.
Previous celebrities to act as 
the face of Jacobs’ lines include Dakota Fanning, Victoria Beck-ham and Helena Bonham Carter.Miley Cyrus announced

DURING ITS 26-4 RUN TUESDAY.

UF has flourished this year when send-
ing a full-court press at opposing teams, 
and Tuesday night was the perfect exam-
ple of how successful it has been for Billy 
Donovan’s unit. Thanks largely to the press, Florida 
forced Georgia to commit 10 turnovers during its 26-4 run that spanned over 
10:45 in the first half. 
UF committed only one turnover dur-
ing that time, while UGA attempted only 
five field goals during the span.
After their run, the No. 7 Gators (14-
2, 3-0 Southeastern Conference) led by double digits throughout the remainder of the contest to grab a 72-50 victory in the O’Connell Center.
“Huge impact. It changed the game,” 
sophomore guard Michael Frazier II said 
of the press. 
“Coach D did a great job of telling us 
who to go trap, from where, different 
spots, keep them off-balance, keep them on their toes. 
“We did a good job of that, and they 
didn’t handle it very well.”

Thomas Holley, a Penn State ver-
bal commit, is flipping to Florida, 
Rivals.com reported Wednesday 
morning.
A family member of Holley 
confirmed the flip to Rivals. The 
news comes just a week after Larry 
Johnson, Holley’s main recruiter 
and longtime Penn State assistant, would be leaving Happy Valley.
On Tuesday, reports confirmed 
that Johnson would join Urban 
Meyer at Ohio State, leading many 
to speculate that Holley would be-come a Buckeye. Holley, a New York native, talked constantly dur-ing his recruiting process about wanting to stay close to home, which made Northeast schools fa-vorable choices.
The 6-foot-4, 299-pound Holley 
is the No. 3 defensive tackle in the 2014 class and the No. 63 player overall, according to Rivals. He is talented enough to help immediate-
ly along UF’s defensive line, which 
lost Dominique Easley to the NFL Draft following the 2013 season.
In an interview with Florida 
Sports Talk NBC Sports Radio on 
Dec. 31, 2013, Holley praised Flor-
ida and hinted at his eventual deci-sion to flip.

The Gators have enough foul trouble on 
the court. Now, the problem has made its 
way off of it.
Sophomore Christin Mercer was ar-
rested on Friday for conspiring to commit a robbery after deputies served a warrant for her arrest.Most arrests are considered untimely, 
but this one could serve as a potentially le-thal blow to Florida’s season.
The Gators’ (13-4, 3-1 Southeastern Con-
ference) struggles this season have been pri-marily on defense. However, they seemed to be finding a groove in their recent nine-game win streak, allowing an average of 67.4 points per game during that stretch.Mercer was subsequently suspended 
and didn’t make the trip to Baton Rouge, 
La. On Sunday, No. 12 LSU walloped Florida 82-68, win-ning the rebound-ing battle 50-29 and emphatically end-
ing the Gators’ streak. Mercer’s presence was sorely missed, as 
she’s currently second on the team in points (11.8) and third on the team in rebounds (5.8) per contest this season. 
The Gators are now left hoping seven is 
their lucky number. And they’re going to need all the luck they can get. 
Florida has only seven active players on 
its roster heading into the heart of its con-ference schedule, thanks to the indefinite suspension of the 6-foot forward.

UF coach Will Muschamp and 
his staff have been setting the re-cruiting trail on fire in the last week. Just a week ago, they flipped 
the No. 4 corner in the 2014 class, 
Jalen Tabor, from Arizona and got him on campus to enroll early.
Florida also snagged running 
back Brandon Powell away from Miami, where he was scheduled to 
enroll on Jan. 8. Instead, Powell en-
rolled at UF on Friday.
Holley’s flip gives Florida the 
No. 7 recruiting class in the coun-try, according to Rivals. 
Florida still has a chance to land 
five-star offensive tackle Damian Prince on National Signing Day, and he will take his official visit 
to Gainesville on Jan. 31. He also 
has offers from South Carolina and Maryland.
Florida is also in the hunt for 
five-star athlete Adoree’ Jackson, a Gardena, Calif., native. Jackson’s friendship with early enrollee Ta-bor could swing him away from USC and UCLA.THURSDAY, JANUARY  16, 2014 � ALLIGATOR, 15

Bulldogs guard commits five turnovers
During many of the Gators’ 
full-court press sets, they sent 
a guard and a big man — often 
Will Yeguete or Dorian Finney-
Smith — to the forefront of the formation. 
Both players would converge 
on the first Georgia player in play to touch the ball and try to force a turnover.
Bulldogs guard Charles 
Mann, the reigning SEC Player 
of the Week, was the biggest 
victim of the Gators’ full-court press Tuesday. 
He finished with a game-high 
five turnovers, four coming dur-ing the Gators’ key run. 
Three of his mistakes were 
committed in the backcourt.
Mann, who look gassed and 
frustrated on the floor Tuesday night, recorded more turnovers than made field goals and fin-ished with only eight points in 
34 minutes.
“We know their two guards, 
Mann and [Kenny Gaines], they 
play a lot of minutes, so Coach D wanted to bring fatigue into play,” Finney-Smith said. “So, that’s why we pressed 
on them.” 
With 7:25 remaining in the 
first half and Florida ahead 22-10, Florida’s full-court press be-gan to get to Mann. 
As he ran down the floor 
with Frazier trailing, the Geor-gia guard lost his handle at half court. 
Yeguete then grabbed the ball 
and took it to the other end for an easy layup. 
Fewer than two minutes later, 
Yeguete and Wilbekin double-
teamed Mann, who threw an 
errant pass to Nemanja Djurisic out of bounds. After the error, Mann shook his head in disgust.
“I don’t think they were ex-
pecting it,” Yeguete said. 
“They turned the ball over 
a lot. It got us going; it got the crowd going. We got layups, fastbreaks, dunks. 
“They didn’t know what to 
do on the press.”
But the onslaught stemming 
from the press continued.
Fifty-six seconds after his last 
turnover, Mann stumbled and was trapped by Finney-Smith and Wilbekin in the right corner of the back court. 
Then, Wilbekin swiped the 
ball and dished it to Finney-Smith for the easy slam to lift UF to a 30-10 lead.
Georgia eventually made 
adjustments in the second half and did a better job of handling Florida’s press. 
But by that time, the damage 
was already done. The deficit was too big to erase.
Yeguete admitted after the 
game that he did not know Flor-ida would press that much early 
in the contest. 
The Gators found success 
with the press, so they impro-
vised.
“[Donovan] just told us to, 
‘Just go, just go,’ because he knew they were struggling,” Yeguete said. 
“And we just went.” HooPS , from page 14
Florida lacking depth after suspension, injuries
The Gators began the season 
with only nine active players 
after center Viktorija Dimaite suffered an ACL tear in her left knee, and have been playing the majority of their games with eight due to a torn ligament in sophomore Antoinette Bannis-ter’s right hand.
This season, coach Amanda 
Butler has often praised her team’s ability to overcome ad-versity. Overcoming Mercer’s absence will be tough, to say the least, but Butler has faith in her team’s mettle. 
“I don’t think there are many 
adjustments for us to make,” Butler said. “We’ve played with a short bench all year and found ways to overcome whatever it was that we were missing in a particular game. I think the spirit of this team will continue push forward. Certainly, one less person on any given Thurs-day or Sunday is significant for any team.”
“We’re already having to play 
with an extra measure of tough-ness, because most people have a longer bench than ours. I think we’ll just stay the course of what we’ve been doing.”
But what the Gators have 
been doing surely won’t serve them well down the road this season, at least in some aspects. 
Rebounding has been a nag-
ging issue for Florida. Freshman Ronni Williams is one of the Gators’ two remaining consis-tent rebounders, the other being redshirt junior Kayla Lewis. 
“Both of those young ladies 
feel an extra measure of respon-sibility, and that’s just because they’re great competitors and they want to do whatever they can for their team,” Butler said. “I don’t think the other five that are able to play right now look at it at all as just Ronni and Kayla’s job.”
“I think that responsibility 
is going to be spread across the team. The first two rebound-ers on LSU on Sunday were guards. We’ve got to have more rebounding contributions from everywhere.”
As previously mentioned, 
foul trouble has also been prob-lematic. Williams has fouled out  often this season, with the latest happening in Sunday’s contest against LSU. 
With the team now down to 
only two bench players, fouls become increasingly magnified. 
“It’s a tough thing to correct,” 
Butler said. “You can certainly try and teach and drill things in practice.
“People are going to come at 
you. People are going to throw the ball in your way and you’ve just got to take things to another level. I fully expect Ronni to do that. She’s made great strides. Sunday, she slipped back a little bit, but she’s a great player and awesome competitor.”

Talent can only take you so far; it’s 
hard work that can take you further.
That is what sophomore sprinter Ant-
wan Wright said after a dominant per-
formance by Florida at its season-open-
ing indoor meet. 
Already pushing aside last weekend’s 
UAB Blazer Invite, the athletes know 
what’s ahead and have more to prove as the indoor season progresses. 
“It was a really good image, a little 
sample of what we’re going to see for the rest of the season,” senior distance run-ner Cory McGee said. 
“We were all really getting along and 
supporting each other like we always do. The energy before the 4x4 when we did our team chant was just so powerful. I mean, the entire arena is just focusing on the Gators.”
McGee ran a 2:07.47 in the women’s 
800-meter race to finish in first place.
With the Gators claiming 13 events 
and accomplishing new personal re-cords, the team remains motivated by coach Mike Holloway.
“[Holloway] told me that he knows 
that I’m fast, I just have to put in my head that I’m fast,” Wright said. 
“Also, I don’t need to be so hard on 
myself and just go out there and execute my race.”
Wright finished with an event victory 
in the men’s 60-meter dash. His time of 
6.63 seconds was ahead of his teammates 
Hugh Graham Jr. (6.66) and Marquis Dendy (6.88), who push him to be suc-cessful. 
He believes the short sprinters must 
work on their starts during practice.
With such high standards coming 
from the upperclassmen and the talent the younger athletes bring to the team, 
the Gators find themselves around good 
company and recognize the program they are committed to is right for them. 
“Coming into this year, I think it was 
important to me to just do everything I can,” McGee said. 
“Being able to be a part of a program 
like this and have so many things pro-vided to me each and every day, it’s the 
least I can do.”
McGee was placed on the Bowerman 
Trophy preseason watch list with nine 
other NCAA women athletes around the 
nation.
She  finished the cross country season 
strong. In her three meets last year, she 
finished second twice. She also finished 
first at the South Region Championship 
on Nov. 11, 2013.
“It’s going to be a bright season for 
everybody,” Wright said.UF seeks to continue success after strong showing at UAB Invite

Coach Roland Thornqvist is excited to be back in business. 
With six of Florida’s seven players listed in the top 40 of the 
ITA Singles Rankings, he has good reason. 
After almost a two-month break, the Gators are eager to 
jump into the season.Along with the tough schedule also came a few new rule 
changes. 
This spring, the NCAA will be experimenting with a 
6-point doubles match and a tiebreaker in singles instead of 
a third set.
Florida has three seniors, one sophomore and three fresh-
men on the roster. 
Coming off of what he considers an “excellent” fall season, Thornqvist said he expects his freshmen to 
perform at a high level in the dual-match 
season in the spring.
He said the team will rely on the fresh-
men a lot, but he will also be relying on his seniors for leadership and stability. The 
team begins the spring season in Las Vegas 
for the three-day Freeman Memorial Cham-pionships on Friday.
“Baby talk has to go away quickly,” Thornqvist said, “or 
we’re in for a rude awakening.”Highly ranked Florida squad starts season with high hopes
