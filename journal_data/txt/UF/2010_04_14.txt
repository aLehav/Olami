Rubio cancels speech
By ANDREW WYZAN
Alligator Contributing Writer
U.S. Senate candidate Marco Rubio, who
was scheduled to speak tonight in the Reitz
Union Grand Ballroom, has postponed his
trip to Gainesville.
UF College Republicans chairman Jona-
than Lott said Rubio canceled his speech
due to an illness in his family.
On his Web site, Rubio wrote he is re-
turning to South Florida because his father
was diagnosed with a recurrence of lung
cancer.
The UF College Republicans were orga-
nizing the event in conjunction with Rubio's
campaign.
Rubio, the former Florida speaker of theHouse, is campaigning against Gov. Charlie
Crist for the Republican nomination for the
Senate seat being vacated by Sen. George
LeMieux.
The election will be held Nov. 2.
According to a Ras-
mussen Reports poll
released Monday, 57
percent of Florida's Re-
publican voters are likely
to vote for Rubio in the
primary. Crist, his imme-
/ diate opponent, is behind
Rubio by almost 30 points.
Lott said Rubio is
cleaning up the polls because he is running
on a platform of being a "true conservative"
who supports small government.0 LOWE LEADS BY 35 VOTES.

Craig Lowe had 35 reasons to cel-
ebrate Tuesday night.
In the thinnest of margins, only 35
votes separated City Commissioner
Lowe from his opponent in the mayoral
race, Don Marsh.
And while it was enough to celebrate
at The Top Restaurant, it wasn't enough
to cinch an official victory.
Since Lowe only secured 50.1 percent
of the vote, the final say on who gets the
keys to City Hall will be decided by an
automatic recount.
According to Pam Carpenter, supervi-
sor of elections, there needs to be a mar-
gin of victory greater than half a percent-
age point to officially deem a winner.
"Stay tuned," she said. "We have
some work to do."
The official results are expected to be
released Friday when the results are cer-
tified.
For Lowe, this is just another bump
on a rocky campaign trail that was not
exempt from political mudslinging and
personal attacks.
"This was a very unusual campaign,"
he said. "We chose to focus on the issues.We will press forward."
Although he did not accuse Marsh of
such campaign tactics, Lowe said it is
clear who ran a positive and who ran a
negative campaign.
"Frankly, you can't run a city on neg-
ativity," he said.
Lowe is no stranger to marginal
wins. In 2003, he secured a victory in the
District 4 City Commission race by 16
votes.
"This was a very unusual cam-
paign. We chose to focus on the
issues .We will press forward."
Craig Lowe
mayoral candidate
As Lowe awaits the certification of the
results, he said he will continue with the
same zeal he has maintained throughout
the campaign.
"We will remain focused with our
eyes on what lies ahead," he said.
Despite the lack of a definitive conclu-
sion in the mayoral race, the seat for Dis-
trict 4 City Commission went to Randy
Wells, who got 1,305 votes, compared to
opponent Penny Wheat's 793 votes.
With his wife and 5-year-old daughter
by his side, Wells credited his triumph to
his family and enthusiastic support from
the District 4 community, including stu-

Warm weather brings excess strawberries, low prices
0 THE SEASON USUALLY ENDS IN
EARLY APRIL.
By KAREN SULLIVAN
Alligator Contributing Writer
Strawberry lovers are seeing steals at su-
permarket registers thanks to a surge in sup-
ply at season's end.
Freezing temperatures shortened the fruit's
shelf life at the beginning of the year, but the
return of warm weather in March kept straw-
berries growing into April, leaving farmers
overstocked.
"That cold weather pushed everythingback. The fruit's biological clock was slowed
up," said Marcus Caswell, quality assurance
manager for Wishnatzki Farms.
Ted Campbell, executive director of the
Florida Strawberry Growers Association, said
strawberry-picking season typically lasts from
Thanksgiving to Easter and starts to peak in
February. But this year the fruit did not flour-
ish until the first week of March.
Campbell said the strawberry crop yielded
about half the normal amount in January and
February, and growth has been 25 to 30 per-
cent less this season.
"The cold winter really kept the production
down," Campbell said. "And all of a sudden
everything started to come into full fruit."While the season tends to wrap up by early
April, Caswell said he expects harvesting will
continue for another week.
"We're still putting out a really good
amount of fruit right now, which is not usual,"
he said. "
Retailers start outsourcing to California in
March when Florida farm-
Around ers lose their supply ofGainesville strawberries, he said.
Though many in-state
retailers are supporting Florida's strawberry
market, farmers are facing competition from
out-of-state growers, reflected in the prices.
"We were forced to really sell at a rock-
bottom price," Caswell said.Caswell suggests consumers get to their
local grocery stores before California has the
chance to raise the market price.
"The prices are there," he said. "But that'll
probably end relatively soon."
Publix has been selling 1-pound containers
of the berries at four for $5 since April 1, and
spokesman Dwaine Stevens said prices should
remain that way until Friday.
"As long as the quantities and quality are
there we're going to keep that price," he said.
Other stores are also promoting strawberry
sales. At Winn-Dixie 2-pound boxes have been
sold for as low as $3.99 while 1-pound contain-
ers were $2.99 at Albertsons and $1.50 at Wal-
mart Supercenters.

STUDENT GOVERNMENT
Student senate discusses crisis response
By ELIZABETH BEHRMAN
Alligator Writer
Senators learned about the UF Counseling
Center's response to the March 2 shooting of
Kofi Adu-Brempong when they gathered for
Tuesday's meeting.
Sherry Benton, the director of the UF
Counseling Center, said the center was un-
able to do more for Adu-Brempong because
there were eight severe, suicidal cases re-
ported before Adu-Brempong's.
Laura Templeton, a counselor from the UF
Counseling Center's Crisis Response Team,
went with police to visit Adu-Brempong the
day before the shooting, but no counselors"We really try to get out there. We
try to let people know about us. We
try to encourage people to use us."
Sherry Benton
director of the UF Counseling Center
came the night of the shooting because the
situation was too dangerous, according to
Alligator archives.
She said about 14 percent of students
come to the counseling center for help every
year.
"We really try to get out there," Benton
said. "We try to let people know about us.We try to encourage people to use us."
After Benton's speech, senators unani-
mously passed a resolution calling for the
protection of academic freedom on campus
in response to the UF administration's deci-
sion to prohibit two graduate students from
using their post-earthquake footage in their
thesis documentary about an aid organiza-
tion in Haiti.
They were not allowed to use the footage
because it was shot after the university estab-
lished a policy banning UF-sponsored trips
to Haiti in order to protect student safety.
Unite Party Sen. Ben Meyers said students
should be able to pursue any opportunity
that they see fit to further their education.Education

0 THE SHOW BEGINS TODAY.
By KIMBERLY CASCANTE
Alligator Contributing Writer
Students in the College of Edu-
cation will display their artwork
created for class for all of UF to see
today.
The art show, which starts today
at 10:30 p.m. in the Norman Hall
basement, combined technology,
creativity and fun into a student's
classwork, according to Christopher
Sessums, professor for the School of
Teaching and Learning.
Sessums said students recreated
the poem, "The Red Wheelbarrow,"
written by William Carlos Williams,
and one of his photos.
"Often times, teaching and
learning are strippedOn of many creative as-Campus pects," Sessums said.
"This was a way I
thought we could spice things up
and have fun applying what we're
learning in a different way."
Students in the Integrating Tech-
nology into the Secondary Curricu-
lum course started preparing for
the art show since the third week
of class and could only discuss the
project using social media like Fa-
cebook and Twitter.
Monik Markus, the documentar-
ian of the art show, said it was dif-
ficult to tell if the show was going
in the right direction because of this
requirement.

Patel painted designs varying from flowers

Henna tattoos are painted on the hands and
feet of women before marriage and are made of
crushed up leaves, rose water and lemon juice.
The ingredients contain no chemicals, and the
mixture can also act as a natural hair dye, Patel
said.
Patel learned how to design henna tattoosby watching professionals paint them at wed-
dings.

Sharma, whose family is from India, said
henna tattoos are a tradition for brides in her
culture.
The bride gets henna tattoos on her hands
and feet, and the tattoos are part of a bigger cel-

and eating, Sharma said.
"It's like a bachelorette party," she said.

Foot in Mouth
Huckabee's homophobia
ignorant, offensiveW heart Huckabees.
We especially heart one particular Huckabee when
he makes statements essentially comparing gay mar-
riage to incest and polygamy -material that writes itself.
Facing fierce backlash following an interview in New Jersey
last week, former Gov. Mike Huckabee spoke about "accom-
modating" those who believe in same-sex marriage the same
way people accommodate those who believe in using drugs,
polygamy and incest.
Let's put this into context. This is coming from the former
presidential candidate and governor from the armpit of the
country, the state where we get such treasures as The Little
Rock Nine, Walmart and Billy Bob Thornton -Arkansas.
This is coming from the former governor who denied a Med-
icaid-funded abortion when a 15-year-old girl was impregnated
by her stepfather. This is the kind of crazy we just can't buy. This
is the kind of word-vomit news we send muffin baskets for.
But after the muffin baskets subside and our smiles fade
for the kind of crazy talk we relish in the newsroom, we start
to scold -and we do it often. This is the same guy who won
the Iowa caucus in 2008, thereby emerging as the Republican
Party's first front-runner in the last presidential election before
our good ole boy from Arizona stole the show.
We find Huckabee's comments of "accommodation" not
only offensive but ignorant and not welcome anywhere but
back in the armpit that is the entire state of Arkansas.
We hope America acknowledges this comparison when con-
sidering who it wants to run our country.
And let's face it, we've seen what happens when we put
Arkansas governors in the White House -things get a little
sticky.
Just ask Ms. Lewinsky.
Can you hear us now?
When this time ofyear rolls around
and finals are loom-
ing, we can at least smile for
teacher evaluations.
It's the one time when
we're supposed to be able to
really explain how we feel
about the classes we're tak-
ing and the people who run
them. But, honestly, after all
this time, we're beginning to
wonder if our opinion really
matters to anyone at all.
Yes, there are the standard
evaluations and the bubble-in
responses we give. Yes, there's
even a section on the back
where we can explain exactly
why picked those numbers.
And, yes, there are sites like
ratemyprofessors.com where
we can trust that people
are somewhat more honest
when one can feel even more
anonymous typing up a rant
instead of writing it down inthat handwriting the profes-
sor could possibly recognize.
We're given plenty of chances
to say how we feel, and with
the Assessment of Instructors
search on ufl.edu and ratemy-
professors.com, we can warn
others.
But, aside from the stu-
dents, no one seems to care
what the students really
think. What exactly do evalu-
ations do for the teachers and
administrators who say they
take them seriously? What
difference does it make to
anyone except the students?
Teachers with the worst evals
and awful ratings on Rate
My Professors are still teach-
ing classes next fall, and great
teachers who are praised con-
tinuously still don't seem to
get noticed.
We've always felt like
evals give us the chance to tell
the truth, but is anyone really
listening?

Manufactured fear creates false reality
t's a scary world outside. Past the comforts of my tiny,
messy dorm room, danger lurks at every turn. People
from foreign lands plot to wipe me and my country off
the map. Even getting into a Toyota is akin to dancing with
death. Or that's at least what the media would have you be-
lieve. To me, news today has increasingly become a stream of
cautionary tales and exaggerated warnings.
Every time you flip on the channel, you are greeted with
another shark attack, deadly car accident or plane crash.
While terrible tragedies such as the airplane crash that killed
Poland's president Lech Kaczynski and the mine disaster in
West Virginia certainly warrant coverage and worldwide ex-
posure, I cannot help but feel that the news often relies too
much on stories that deal with tragedy and manufacture fear
for the sake of ratings. Every time I turn on the television, an-
other tragedy has occurred overnight and my own sense of
security is assaulted. Even against my own judgment, I can't
help but listen to these news reports and become engrossed
in the manufactured melodrama.
Eventually, I see others and often find myself incorpo-
rating their warnings into my own daily life and worrying
about things that prove irrational. A great example is the
blitz of coverage that surrounded the outbreak of swine flu
last year. While swine flu is a serious illness, I felt it was truly
overblown and turned into an all-out plague of fear. Warn-
ings over the safety of products are incredibly important to
consumers, but many times they are overblown and only in-
cite irrational panic.
In addition to this, ever since I can remember, television
shows that deal with crimes, murders and the like have
worked constantly to bring other peoples' pain into your
home and bring dramatic elements to crimes. These elements,
often created through the use of haunting music, the dulcet
tones of Bill Kurtis and/or the ghostly visage of Keith Mor-Joshua Lee
letters@a lIigator orgrison, only serve to exaggerate and
intensify the fear of the world outside
of our doors. It is easy to understand
why news organizations broadcast
such personal tales of tragedy. Crimes
committed against innocents are heart
wrenching. They force the viewer to
watch the events out of a shared sense
of humanity and horror.
It often seems that the more gruesome and bizarre the sad
event is, the more excessive the coverage. However, exploit-
ing personal suffering and pain for ratings and in the name
of creating manufactured drama only serves as a catalyst to
creating panic in an already fearful America. Creating news
reports covering and warning of dangers in the world, along
with broadcasting of personal stories of crime and deviance,
has the combined effect of portraying the world outside our
doors as one fraught with threats and filled with strangers.
Too often, I feel like the media sensationalizes stories and
fabricates a world that is exponentially more perilous than
the one we live in. This is not to say that there are no dangers
that we have to look out for. Victims of crime will tell you to
always be aware of your surroundings, especially at night.
Driving a car is a daily event that can, and unfortunately
sometimes does, end in tragedy.
Personally, I strongly advise people to cover their ears
when Owl City or Ke$ha comes on the radio. While there are
dangers in the world, I have a problem with television news
and other shows creating what I see as manufactured fear.
We must remind ourselves that the world outside is often
not the one shown on television and to have a little faith and
trust in fellow people.

Guest column
Students should question authority
Modern students are not inter-ested in learning. They are in-
terested in passing their tests
and getting good grades. It doesn't
matter how much you know, it only
matters how well you regurgitate in-
formation. Why has American educa-
tion devolved to this point? One reason
is the loss of American industry to for-
eign countries with cheap labor. This
has constricted the job market, making
a college degree much more important.
Employers give preeminence to the
institution. Thus to get into excellentNick Miner schools, you
Speaking Out have to have
top grades. Yet
is there also a
cultural backlash against questioning
authority? The 1970s saw massive stu-
dent protests that played a pivotal role
in our withdrawal from Vietnam.
Look at the generation during the
Reagan presidency. Where were the
protests of the Iran-Contra affair? Dif-
ferences between students in the '70s
and '80s is drastic. Has blind respect
for authority become institutionalized?
The resolution passed by StudentGovernment about the shooting of
Kofi Adu-Brempong was soft and pa-
sive. There were some very serious
abuses of power by the University
Police Department, yet SG passes a
resolution tthat barely does more than
acknowledge the police shot a student.
UF needs a greater emphasis on criti-
cal thought. Students need to learn to
question what they are told, and pro-
fessors need to encourage this. Without
the ability to form your own thoughts
you've just memorized facts.

ate student.WEDNESDAY, APRIL 14, 2010 U ALLIGATOR, 7
Letters to the Editor
Student thanks RTS driver for keeping lost wallet
safe
Thank you Mr. Bus 22 Driver. I lost my wallet on
bus 22 on Tuesday and tracked down the bus later. I
just want to thank you for keeping my wallet safe for
me. My mind was preoccupied with other things as I
exited the bus, and my wallet had many valuables in
it that would have been very difficult to replace. Also,
whoever turned in my wallet to the driver, thank you.
It's so relieving to know that there are still good people
in this world. I believe that karma will reward you
both. You are honest and good people. Once again,
thank you!

Alligator Reader
Reader feels indifferent to Tiger Woods' drama
Contrary to the beliefs of the Alligator Editorial
Board, I, personally, have not forgiven Tiger Woods.
Mainly because Tiger Woods doesn't owe me an apol-
ogy any more than he owes any other Alligator reader
an apology, unless Elin Woods just bought a subscrip-
tion. I don't know why people assume that every time
a celebrity does something wrong, it's like they hurt us
personally. Tiger Woods cheated on his wife? Doesn't
affect me. I just want to watch some golf. If anything,
Tiger owes me an apology for making me sift through
stories about his personal life on ESPN.com for the past
semester to find things I actually care about.

Gators drop final game against 'Noles, lose series 3-1
By ANTHONY CHIANG
Alligator Staff Writer
achiang@alligator org
TALLAHASSEE -A blown
electricity source sucked the pow-
er out of Dick Howser Stadium
and the bats Tuesday.
The start time was delayed 15
minutes due to an electricity out-
age that lasted until the bottom of
the fourth inning.
UF and FSU played to the
theme and combined for just five
runs and zero homers after scor-
ing an average of just more than
12 runs per game in their first
three meetings this season.
No. 6 FSU (26-7, 10-5 Atlan-
tic Coast Conference) was able to
hold off the No. 7 Gators (23-9, 8-4
Southeastern Conference) in a low
scoring 3-2 affair to take the sea-
son series.
"We are going to have to
look at our offense and
shake some things up and
give guys some opportuni-
ties that they may have
wanted earlier on."
Kevin O'Sullivan
UF baseball coach
FSU pitcher Scott Sitz lasted a
career-high six innings and shut
the Gators down in the process.
The freshman held them to just
four hits and two runs.
"We didn't get our bats going,"
UF center fielder Matt den Dekkersaid. "Any time you are limited to
four hits, you are going to have a
tough time winning the ball game.
We pitched well enough to win."
The top-two hitters in Florida's
lineup, Nolan Fontana and den
Dekker, combined for just one hit
and struggled to reach base for the
third and fourth hitters, Preston
Tucker and Austin Maddox."We are going to have to look
at our offense and shake some
things up and give guys some op-
portunities that they may have
wanted earlier on," UF coach
Kevin O'Sullivan said. "We have
to put our heads together to try to
get some more offense going."
FSU, on the other hand, got on
the scoreboard early after centerfielder Tyler Holt reached on a
single to lead off the first and stole
second during the next at-bat. He
later scored the first run of the
game on a two-out RBI single by
right fielder James Ramsey.
The Gators struggled to get the
last out in the second inning, too.
Sophomore pitcher Greg Larson,
who made his second start of the
Harrison Diamond / Alligator Staff
UF pitcher Greg Larson started the game against FSU on Tuesday and allowed three runs in just two in-
nings of work in the Gators' 3-2 loss in Tallahassee.season Tuesday, retired the first
two hitters in the inning on just
two pitches, but then allowed
three straight hits, which resulted
in two runs to make it a 3-0 lead
for FSU.
"You have to buckle down and
make pitches, and we just weren't
able to do that in the first two in-
nings," O'Sullivan said.
Larson lasted just two innings
as the Seminoles rocked him for
seven hits and three runs. In the
four games the teams played this
season, FSU has tagged Florida's
starting pitchers for 14 runs in
only eight combined innings of
work.
"The three losses that we've
had to FSU, we just haven't got-
ten off on the right foot with the
starting pitcher," O'Sullivan said.
"I'd like to think if we just get a
little bit of a better start we have a
chance to do something."
Despite the bullpen throw-
ing six scoreless innings in relief
for the right-handed hurler, the
Gators never managed to grab the
lead.
UF scored two runs in the fourth
on RBIs from second baseman Josh
Adams and catcher Mike Zunino
to close the gap to 3-2, which was
the closest it would get.
It had an opportunity in the
sixth to do some damage with run-
ners on first and second, but FSU
third baseman Sherman Johnson
snagged a hard hit ground ball off
the bat of Zunino and dove to just
tag left fielder Tyler Thompson
out at third to end the inning.
College students should take advantage of sporting opportunities
week from today, I will take mylast class at Florida.
Although I'm happy to finally be
done with school, I am going to miss UF.
In my four years, I had a lot of good
times -many of them involving Gators
sports.
I spent my first two years at UF attend-
ing sporting events as a fan, and the final
two, I turned into a cynical asshole cover-
ing the teams.
Through my experiences, I enjoyed
many different events and learned some
lessons along the way.
Current and future students should tryto take advantage of the great teams they
have at Florida.
Here is some advice for students while
in school:
1. Go to a national championship
Obviously, this is conditional on a Gators
team making the national championship.
But I went to the Final Four in Atlanta my
freshman year, and I still remember it as
the best weekend of my college life. You
are not going to get many chances to go to
a national championship event, so if you
have the opportunity, you need to do it.
Don't worry about the cost. I know mostBobby Callovii
'of you are struggling
college students, but
you just can't pass up
an opportunity to go
to a national champi-
onship.
Bobby s World 2.Cm u obcallovi@alligatororg .Camp out for abasketball game
I spent so much
time outside Gate 3 of the O'Connell Cen-
ter my freshman year that when I called
Five Star Pizza, they asked if I still lived at
the O'Connell Center. While waiting out-
side an arena for a basketball game doesn'tseem like the best way to spend your time,
it really isn't that bad. I made a lot of good
friends and now have a bunch of good sto-
ries from my experience. It is also a great
opportunity to sit in seats you would have
to pay a lot of money for if you weren't a
student, so take advantage of the chance.
3. Don't take losses so seriously
I know this may seem hard, but it is just
a game. Growing up, and even my first
two years at UF, if my team lost, I was in
an awful mood the rest of the day. UF stu-

Paculba sets tone for lineup
* NO. 3 U F FACES NO. 19 FSU TONIGHT
IN TALLAHASSEE.
By GREG LUCA
Alligator Writer
UF sophomore Michelle Moultrie would be
batting leadoff for just about every other team in
the nation.
The speedy center fielder can turn a bunt into
a base hit in a flash and has lately added a little
power to her game as well.
But for at least another year and a half, she fig-
ures to be locked in at No. 2 in the order behind
"The Ninja."
Junior Aja Paculba, known as "Ninja" to her
teammates, is in the midst of a career-long 14
game hit streak, recently broke Florida's career
runs record with her 167th, and will once again
be at the top of the lineup as No. 3 UF (30-4, 12-2
Southeastern Conference) takes on No. 19 FSU
(36-8, 8-4 Atlantic Coast Conference) in a double-
header today at 5 p.m. in Tallahassee.
The second baseman is in the SEC's top 10 in
walks, RBIs, runs, doubles, total bases, slugging
percentage, double plays and assists, and has
only committed three errors on the season.
"When you look at how many runs and how
many RBI she gets, she's very important to this
team in a lot of ways," UF coach Tim Walton
said. "She's just a good person to have at the top
of the lineup."
In addition to her 14-game hitting streak, the
preseason All-SEC selection has reached base in
19 straight contests. Over that time span, she is
batting .381 with an on-base percentage of .487and has driven in 21 runs and scored 21 times.
"I've been seeing the ball really well lately
and just trying to get on any way I can," Paculba
said.
For Paculba, getting on base means a lot more
than just getting hits.
Even though opposing pitchers are wary of
giving senior power hitter Francesca Enea pitch-
es she can handle, Paculba still manages to lead
the team in walks.
"I just look for a pitch that I can hit," Paculba
said. "I don't swing at pitches that I know that I
can't hit hard."
Paculba's knack for getting on base works
nicely with her teammates' ability to hit her
home.
The junior scores 60 percent of the time she
Softballreaches base, having scored 37
runs on 34 hits and 28 walks.
"A lot of credit goes to the
people behind me," Paculba said.
"We've got some great hitters in
our lineup, and without them, I
can't score runs."
While Paculba is quick to deflect credit, she
certainly deserves a lot for herself.
If the numbers are any indication, Paculba
would be able to score no matter who hits behind
her.
After scoring 61 runs in 75 games as a fresh-
man, Paculba scored 69 in 68 games as a sopho-
more and is once again scoring more than a run
per game this season.
If she can keep that pace up, she may have a

FSU's young pitcher tames UF bats

TALLAHASEE -The game should have been a feast
for the Gators.
Florida's offense was coming off a nine-run perfor-
mance Sunday, and the team was facing a pitcher making
his second-career start. But Scott Sitz left the Gators (23-9,
8-4 Southeastern Conference) hungry.
Sitz, a freshman from Jacksonville Beach Fletcher High,
allowed only one earned run on four hits in six innings to
lead No. 6 Florida State (26-7, 10-5 Atlantic Coast Confer-
ence) to a 3-2 win against No. 7 Florida on Tuesday night.
"(Sitz) didn't misfire," UF coach Kevin O'Sullivan said.
"When they asked him to throw the ball over the inner
half, he threw over the inner half. He didn't miss over the
plate. When they asked him to throw away, he located. It's
as simple as that. He did a nice job."
UF averaged 6.8 runs per game entering Tuesday, but
Sitz held Florida hitless for the first three innings.
"He really pitched with tremendous poise," FSU coach
Mike Martin said. "I think I have a new nickname to startwith that guy, because if that's not'Bulldog,' I don't know
what is. He really got after it."
Sitz's only trouble came in the fourth, when he gave up
back-to-back hits to Preston Tucker and Austin Maddox,
who both scored later in the frame. The freshman also hit
Jonathan Pigott twice but recovered.
"That's a great lineup that the University of Florida
has, and what impressed me the most was he went out
there under control and pitched. He
didn't throw," Martin said. "He hit a
guy but didn't lose his composure."
In six relief appearances earlier in
the year, Sitz allowed a combined three
earned runs in 9.1 innings. FSU coach
Mike Martin rewarded him by nam-
ing Sitz the Seminoles' starter April 7
Sitz against North Florida.
Sitz was just as effective then as he
was Tuesday, although facing the Gators in front of 6,526
fans motivated him more.
"Getting the start against Florida, that's real exciting,"
he said. "I had a lot of adrenaline going throughout the
game."

dents have just become accustomed to seeing the foot-
ball team win, so when they lose, most die-hards don't
know what to do. My answer to that is just breathe, re-
lax and go on with the rest of your day. As connected
as you may feel to the team, you are not a part of it and
shouldn't feel like you are.
4. Go watch the small sports
We don't get to start on the football beat here at the
Alligator. Instead, we get to suffer through covering a
smaller beat. But it really isn't bad. They are actually
pretty entertaining. And from a journalist's standpoint,
they might even be better to cover because they don't
receive as much coverage, so the coaches and athletes
are more eager to talk. Also, they really do appreciate
the few times when the fans fill their stadiums, unlike
the men's basketball and football teams, which expect
their stadiums to be filled.

Editor's Note: This is the second of a two-
part series on sand volleyball's quest to
become a NCAA-sanctioned sport.

Sand volleyball at the college level almost nev-
er made it to the opening serve.
In July 2008, the NCAA Committee on Wom-
en's Athletics recommended sand volleyball be
added to the list of "emerging sports," the first
step toward sponsored collegiate competition.
The committee decided on the name "sand vol-
leyball" in the hopes of including schools with cli-
mates less tropical than Florida or California.
In April 2009, that nomination was made offi-
cial. Sand volleyball was slated to start Division-I
play in the spring of 2011.
But there was a catch. It turned out not every-
one was in favor of adding the sport -63 schools
petitioned to kill the sport, including Penn State,
reigning three-time NCAA indoor champion.
The reasons were numerous. Some wondered
about the impact on the indoor game. Others felt
they would be at a disadvantage in recruiting if
they didn't have a sand game. Northern schools
were worried about being overshadowed by
schools in warmer climates (although the Asso-
ciation of Volleyball Professionals has held well-
received competitions in cold-weather places).
Representatives from all 285 programs would
weigh in. If 62.5 percent of them voted to over-
ride, the sport would be cut from NCAA con-
sideration. These are tough economic times, and
schools felt if sand volleyball became a sport, they
would feel pressure to add it.
"It was the crashing of a real popular sport into
financial realities," said Kathy DeBoer, ExecutiveDirector of the American Volleyball Coaches As-
sociation.
The motion failed in January despite the ma-
jority (58 percent) voting for it. Sand volleyball
lived to serve another day.
The debut was moved from spring of 2011 to
spring of 2012 because so much time had been
spent campaigning against the override. Now the
rulebook on an entire sport -from playing to re-
cruiting to scheduling -is being finalized.
Coaches will discuss the new sport and pos-
sible rules during spring meetings. Conferences
will make proposals reviewed by eight NCAA
cabinets that specialize in different aspects of col-
lege athletics, such as academics, financial aid and
recruiting. The rulebook will be finalized when
the coaches gather at the AVCA convention.
S .,
Don't expect to see sand volleyball become the
next Gators sport, at least not right away.
Senior associate athletic director Lynda Tealer
and UF volleyball coach Mary Wise said earlier
this spring there are no plans at this time for UF to
add sand volleyball.
Tealer said there is no set process for the
school to add sports because it happens rather in-
frequently. UF sponsors 21 Division-I sports.
Further hurting sand volleyball's chances in
Gainesville is UF just added women's lacrosse,
which is in the middle of its inaugural season.Adding a sport is a lengthy process. A staff
must be hired. Facilities need to be built. UF an-
nounced it would add lacrosse in June 2006, near-
ly four years before the first match was played.
"Adding sports is very expensive," Tealer said.
"It's a commitment for the long haul."
Looking at that process can shed light on what
might need to happen for sand volleyball.
Tealer highlighted several key factors why la-
crosse won out over other women's sports: pop-
ularity at young ages; the ability to compete for
conference and national championships; growth
of the sport; and possible fan support in the state.
Wise hopes sand volleyball will eventually
come to Gainesville.
"I just don't know of another sport that's got-
ten as much excitement and buzz and attention as
beach volleyball," she said-
The sport's D-I status won't matter if schools
don't add it. Emerging sports have 10 years to
have 40 schools playing for at least two seasons.
Meet that goal, and the NCAA will sponsor a
national championship. Failure to hit the mark
means the sport loses NCAA backing.
The economy isn't the best. Some indoor pro-
grams won't expand because they fear it will di-
lute what they have. Northern schools may hesi-
tate to add a sport originally intended for warm
climates. Those thoughts aren't tempering the
optimism of others.
"The players enjoy playing. The fans enjoying
watching it," Wise said. "I just can't imagine it's
not going to catch on quickly."
If that's the case, two years from now, cars
somewhere in America may pull off the road yet
again.
Maybe this time it won't be by accident.
Now LeasingJune 2008: NCAA
Committee on Women's
Athletics recommends
sand volleyball become
an NCAA sport.
April 2009: Sand vol-
leyball officially is added
to list of emerging sports.
January 2010: Sand
volleyball defeats an
override vote that would
have killed the sport. A
majority of programs
(58 percent) vote
against sand volleyball,
but this falls short of the
62.5 percent needed to
squash the sport.
Spring 2012: Sand
volleyball will kick off its
inaugural season as a
Division-I sport.
