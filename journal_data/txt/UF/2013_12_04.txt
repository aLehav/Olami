The King has ﬂ  own the coop.
Construction has started on a 
Chick-ﬁ  l-A that will replace Burger King, and it’s slated to open Jan. 6.
After adding Burger King to the 
Reitz Union, there wasn’t a need for multiple locations on campus, so the Gator Dining Services team began searching for alternatives to replace the location near Broward Hall, marketing program manager Jill Ro-driguez wrote in an email. 
“Chick-ﬁ  l-A always ranks high 
on our student surveys as a favorite brand,” Rodriguez said. “This made the decision to move forward with a second location on main campus an easy one.”She said the Hub’s Chick-ﬁ  l-A 
has limited seating and is constantly packed, but the new location near Broward will alleviate the trafﬁ  c with its ample space for customers.
She did not say how much the 
project will cost.
Andrew Babcock, a 20-year-old 
UF ﬁ  nance sophomore, said the res-taurant could be a healthier alterna-tive to Burger King’s food.
“I think it’s going to be beneﬁ  cial 
to students,” Babcock said. “The lines at the current Chick-ﬁ  l-A are already atrocious.” 
He said he wishes Gator Dining  
would have chosen a different chain to add variety on campus.

� SHOPPERS SHOULD BE 
CAREFUL WITH THEIR CARS.

With the holidays comes a ﬂ  urry of 
shoppers and, unavoidably, a greater 
risk of shoplifting and burglary. 
While there hasn’t been a dramatic 
increase in shoplifting so far, shoppers and merchants should still be aware of the heightened risk of crime, said GPD spokesman Ofﬁ  cer Ben Tobias.
Last year, police reported about 250 
retail thefts between mid-October and mid-December, about 50 more than the two previous months, Tobias said. Since Nov. 1 this year, 107 retail thefts have been recorded.
The department seasonally increas-
es patrols around shopping areas like Butler Plaza and the Oaks Mall. 
Ofﬁ  cers are also looking out for an-
other prominent holiday-shopping is-sue: car burglaries.  
“While you’re inside shopping, 
criminals are going to be outside shop-ping in your cars,” Tobias said.
The department sends police horses 
to high-trafﬁ  c areas to try to ward off potential thieves, Tobias said. How-ever, he recommended shoppers don’t keep purchases inside cars and added that most burglaries happen when criminals ﬁ  nd unlocked car doors.
“More often than not, it’s just a 
crime of opportunity,” he said. Shoplifting 
incidents lower this year so far

The App Store is buzzing constantly with 
new mobile applications for download, but 
one app creator thinks he’s designed some-thing unique that will speak to college stu-dents — up to 500 at a time, to be exact.Matt Murphy, the 
founder of the company Appsurdity, recently cre-ated Quad, a group-mes-saging app that allows up to 500 participants in a single conversation.  Mur-phy said he designed this app with fraternities and sororities in mind because 
he said big groups needed a better way to communicate.“We challenged our development team 
and came up with something similar to old-school forum message boards,” he said. “We took the best of that and mobilized it in real-time format on the phone.”
Murphy said although other apps like 
GroupMe or iMessage allow users to mes-sage multiple people, they cap out at a low number. He said features of his app would appeal to big organizations by helping fa-cilitate polls and event announcements

A Gainesville brewery is 
packing up and will be moved 
into a new location come September 2014.
Swamp Head Brewery, which 
is currently located at 3140 SW 42nd Way, is moving from the back of a warehouse complex in Southwest Gainesville to a new 13,000-square-foot facility.
Brandon Nappy, tactical 
marketing director for Swamp Head, said as the brewery kept expanding its business, moving became a necessity.
“We’re moving, but we’re 
staying in the same area of town,” Nappy said. “If it’s working for us here, why change?”
Although the facility is not 
large, it’s enough room to grow for a few years, Nappy said. 
The location in Southwest 
Gainesville is ideal for patrons because the original brewery is in that area, he said.
The business does not want 
to lose sight of its loyal customer following.
The new facility can 
accommodate more people in the tasting room and brew more beer, Nappy said. 
The physical look and feel will 
be different, but business will still run in its traditional ways.
“It’s a blessing in disguise,” 
owner Luke Kemper said. “I’m excited about the idea, to have freedom to design and make a system that will work.”
The new spot is a destination 
in itself, Kemper said. 
The location will be by the 
interstate and convenient for travelers.
“The new location will look 
like it’s in the woods and away from it all,” Kemper said. “It’s off the beaten path.”
With the expansion comes expanded ideas on packaging products, Kemper said. 
A bigger space providing the 
means to can bottles as opposed to just kegs is an idea that will help grow the business.
“We’re excited that we found 
a place where our patrons can come around, hang out and have a beer with us,” Nappy said.
that can be sent to the entire 
group.
“I think one of the key 
things for clubs to achieve their missions is that they need to be organized, and commu-nication is key,” he said. “Our mission is to empower groups. We want to be the intel inside — the communication layer — that helps groups succeed.”
Darcy Brown, 19, a UF me-
chanical engineering junior and the incoming vice presi-dent of public relations for Delta Delta Delta, agreed the app would be useful.
“I’d personally use this app 
because with all the different sources of technology in use today, it is easy to forget to check Facebook or emails,” she said. “I really like the poll feature this app has because we can immediately ﬁ  nd out how everyone stands on a situation and can assess what we are going to do with every-one’s best interest in mind.” 
John Harrison, 22, presi-
dent of Kappa Sigma frater-nity and a UF accounting se-nior, agreed Quad would be handy.  
“It would be extremely 
useful on spreading informa-tion to people in a quick man-ner,” he said. “People always have their phones available, and they would receive mes-sages immediately.”
But he said there’s a draw-
back — no one likes getting a ﬂ  ood of replies from a group thread. Harrison wouldn’t use it because receiving so many messages could be distract-ing. 
“It would be annoying to 
receive hundreds of messages a day from brothers,” he said.4, ALLIGATOR � WEDNESDAY, DECEMBER 4, 2013

that is all’: 
Final reﬂ  ections on 
Fall 2013
A lucky batch of seniors will graduate next week and 
depart into the real world of graduate schools, jobs and paid internships, international travel or mom 
and dad’s basement. They’ll have college degrees under their belts — essentially,  really expensive pieces of paper to hang in their ofﬁ  ces to remind them of the four (or three or ﬁ  ve) years they spent at UF. 
Just kidding. As anyone who’s spent a complete semester 
at college knows, a degree is so much more than the sum of courses you took and credits you accrued. It’s a social experi-ence and an emotional roller coaster marked by boozy nights and Pop-Tarts. 
One of the quintessential novels about college, “This Side 
of Paradise,” ends with F. Scott Fitzgerald’s protagonist — a Princeton man, World War I ﬁ  ghter and scorned lover — voicing an iconic lament: “I know myself, but that is all.”
We now know that Fitzgerald basically wrote the novel to 
impress Zelda, his future wife, but it earned critical acclaim and ended up launching his career. Nowadays, he would’ve just opened a Tinder account if he wanted to get laid, but luck-ily, the cellular technology in 1919 wasn’t what it is today. 
The book tends to be overshadowed by the glamour and 
grit of “The Great Gatsby,” but it’s a beautiful story nonethe-less of one man’s college experience and the isolation he faces both during his education and as he tries to align himself with New York’s elite. 
Obviously, the college experience at UF in 2013 isn’t exact-
ly the college experience at Princeton University in the early 20th century. But multiple wars and advancements in cellular technology haven’t eliminated the loneliness that follows the journey from childhood to young adulthood.  
Though we interact with dozens of people daily on this 
sprawling campus, a university education is a solitary one. Whether you’re in a fraternity or sorority, a tightly knit group of friends, a campus organization or the largest student-run newspaper in the United States, your struggles and triumphs are your own. Although a parent, close friend or mentor is around to cheer you on and act as your bridge over troubled water, no one knows you better than yourself — even when you feel as if your identity is still a work in progress. 
To put it simply, as the screenplay writer of “The Adven-
tures of Buckaroo Banzai Across the 8th Dimension,” Earl Mac Rauch wrote, “No matter where you go, there you are.”
To the seniors going forth, good luck: Though you may 
not feel it, you’re stronger and smarter than you were on the ﬁ  rst day. 
And to everyone else, so long for now —  we’ll see you in 
a month. 
Happy holidays from your friends at the Alligator. Goodbye, and here’s to you, faithful readers
At a Student Senate meeting I was covering for 
the Alligator a few semesters ago, a student journalist went rogue. He was covering his last 
meeting for the Gainesville Sun and decided to break one of the most important rules of journalism — he gave his opinion.
During public debate, he stood behind the lectern 
and told everyone what he really thought of Student Government. He said he hated all the senators and that he wasted hours listening to them argue about petty and trivial things.
When I went back to the Alligator ofﬁ  ce that night, 
I asked my editors when I would be able to give my true feelings about SG. And they said in my goodbye column. 
So I patiently waited for the time when I could un-
leash the semesters of pent-up emotion and frustration I had from covering SG.
But now that the time is here, I decided not to — 
much to your dismay, I’m sure. 
Instead, I will be talking about the labor of love that 
caused me so much grief in the ﬁ  rst place: the Alliga-tor.
During my tenure at the paper, I have witnessed 
newspapers being thrown away, the almost-removal of several Alligator racks from campus, four SG elec-tions and some great pieces of journalism. Like my col-leagues, I have been yelled at by sources, berated by readers and lost precious hours of sleep because I was slaving away countless hours at the ofﬁ  ce.
But as readers, you don’t see that. You don’t see the 
process that goes into making the paper. You see the ﬁ  nal product.
You pick up an Alligator every day and see a story 
that might interest or intrigue you. Some see a liberal rag that should be lit on ﬁ  re. Others see errors that need correcting. Whatever you see, I guarantee you don’t see the blood, sweat and tears that are put into the paper each day. Because my colleagues and I do put our blood, sweat and tears into making this paper.
This column, for example, 
has been read and edited by at least seven people before it went to print. Not to mention 
the few hours it took me to write it.
So why do I do it? Why do I spend eight hours a 
night working in a building that has ﬂ  ickering lights, semi-broken furniture and extremely ﬁ  ckle air condi-tioning?
Because of you: the reader. Yes, the Alligator looks great on my resume. And yes, 
I have gotten some great stories published. But what is a story if no one will read it?
Every story the Alligator puts on its pages is one it 
thinks you, the readers, should know about. At times, you don’t agree. And that’s OK.
But please don’t insult the content inside its pages. 
Having someone read something you wrote is terrify-ing. I had two stories published this semester, and each night before they went to print, I worried they were ﬁ  lled with errors. As a writer, it’s the worst feeling to have someone insult something you spent days perfect-ing.
But for those of you out there who read the Alligator 
and appreciate the time we spend creating content for you, I want to thank you. And for those of you who take the time to send feedback — whether good or bad — I want to thank you, too.
You are the reason I work every night to make dead-
line. Well, you and the bleak paycheck I get every two weeks.

Fat shaming. It is a term, 
or at least a concept, that most people have 
run into once in their lives. It is the idea that belittling, teasing or bullying an individual about his or her weight will lead a person to feel so bad about himself or herself, the only option is to lose weight.
Sounds logical, right? Let me be the 
first to tell you — fat shaming is wrong, 
but this type of cyber and cultural bul-lying runs rampant, be it in the national PETA Save the Whales campaign or the Georgia-based Strong4Life ads, which directly shame overweight children, or in a variety of posts on the Internet.
One group in particular thought the 
Internet and the rest of society was not doing enough to shame the overweight public into submission, and as a result, Return of Kings, a “men’s rights” web-site, decided to take it upon themselves to create Fat Shaming Week. This Twit-ter campaign was designed to let the general public tweet its frustrations, rude comments and “advice” directly at over-weight women to “promote a culture of fat shaming.” Its defense was, “Mocking someone for lazy and slothful behavior is one of the best ways to motivate them to change and appear more pleasing.”
Fat shaming isn’t an effective way to make others lose weight. A 2013 study from the Public Library of Science found that overweight or obese in-dividuals who reported be-
ing victims of weight discrimination, or fat shaming, in 2006 were more than two to three times as likely to become obese or remain obese by a 2010 check-in. In short, fat shaming makes the general public gain weight, not lose it. So why, then, is fat shaming socially acceptable?
As Madelyn Fernstrom, the NBC 
News health and diet editor, puts it, “It’s almost like obesity is the last of the ac-ceptable groups to be teasing. Being bi-ased about the overweight or obese is still very socially acceptable.”
If fat shaming does not lead to weight 
loss, what do the products of fat sham-ing look like? Fat shaming looks like 69 percent of elementary school girls saying that the images in magazines influence their concept of the ideal body shape, and 47 percent saying the pictures make them want to lose weight, according to a 2010 study.  
Fat shaming benefits no one, except 
for maybe those who are so ignorant as to believe that health is defined by the size of your jeans.
Brittany Miles is a writer for the Tech-
nique. A version of this column originally appeared on UWire.
Why ‘Fat Shaming Week’ 
is hateful and unnecessaryUWire

UWireKatie Wian
UWire A study has uncovered that 
college students who cheat are more likely to 
be interested in obtaining a gov-ernment job after graduation. So does political power corrupt people, or is it actually that people who are morally corrupt seek power?
The study, produced by Harvard Uni-
versity and the University of Pennsylvania, focused on hundreds of college students in Bangalore, India. 
Students were allowed to roll a die pri-
vately and were promised more pay for more high numbers rolled. Of course, it’s impos-sible to say which students actually lied, but it’s safe to guess based on the averages likely to come up in random rolling. The students with suspiciously high numbers of fives or sixes were about 6 percent more likely to want a government job.
Though the dice test isn’t a perfect pre-
dictor of who is honest and who isn’t, the correlation is real and extremely telling. Cor-ruption in government is so rampant not be-cause of the nature of government, but the nature of those who take interest in it.
It stands to reason that these people who 
cheated did so because they felt entitled, smarter than those around them and as though they can get away with doing the wrong thing. 
People like this seek positions of power 
because they feel they deserve it and that it is rightly theirs. This is exactly the problem because government’s focus must remain on helping the public. Unfortunately, more people who are out to help them-selves are wanting these jobs and taking them from those who are truly altruistic and just.
According to Emily Reyes of 
the Los Angeles Times, the results suggest “that one of the contributing forces behind government corruption could be who gets into government work in the first place. For instance, ‘if people have the view that jobs in government are corrupt, people who are hon-est might not want to get into that system,’” said Rema Hanna, an associate professor at Harvard. So not only are dishonest people seeking power, but they may also be discour-aging trustworthy people from entering the system and making much-needed changes that are in the best interest of constituents.
Transparency International conducts a 
worldwide ranking of governmental corrup-tion each year. Countries are ranked from 1 to 100, with 100 being perfectly clean and 1 being totally corrupt. In 2012, India, the fo-cus of this study, earned a dreadful 36, so clearly this is a particular problem for them. The U.S. received a respectable 73, so while we’re certainly not the worst, we’re also far from the best.
The only way the U.S. can improve upon 
national transparency and, by extension, be-come a better place to live for its citizens is to recruit good people to run the country and oust those leaders who are undeserving of their power.

A Gainesville artist has a high-
flying vision, and she’s turning to 
Kickstarter for help.
UF alumna Leslie Tharp said her 
ambition is to make a steel sculpture of hot air balloons to display at a large art exhibition in Arizona.
Tharp’s metalwork is already on 
display in front of UF’s Small Ani-mal Hospital. She works out of her metal studio on U.S. Route 441 and will begin creating the hot air bal-loon project for the Scottsdale Public Art program next week.
The Scottsdale Public Art Pro-
gram is sponsoring Tharp by cover-ing the materials for the sculpture, transportation and installation of the piece, but she is using Kick-starter.com, an online fundraising platform, to generate funds to keep her studio open while she completes the project.
Tharp has received pledges for 
more than $4,000 of the $6,700 she wants to collect. She launched the 29-day campaign on Nov. 12. 
If the goal is met, Kickstarter will 
add 5 percent of the total funds. But if she doesn’t raise the entire amount by Dec. 11, she won’t receive any of the funding.
“I’ve put myself out there, and 
the support and response has been huge,” she said. “I’m confident that it will all work out.”
She said she chose hot air bal-
loons because they are symbolic of potential and are part of Scottsdale’s culture.
Tharp will drive her pieces across 
the country in February and set them up in Scottsdale, where they will stay until June when she plans to transport them to another city.
Janalyn Peppel, the owner of 
metalworking shop Powder Coating of Gainesville, said Tharp is getting a lot of recognition for her work as one of few female metalworkers.
“She has mastered the art of cre-
ating elegance through comprehen-sive, detailed metal working,” Pep-pel said.  “She’s a special person and artist.”

� FRUSTRATION CAN LEAD TO 
STRESS AND OTHER HEALTH ISSUES.
EMILY BEHRENS

A frustrating sex life could lead to a 
shorter lifespan, a new study says.
The University of Michigan tested fruit 
flies and found that aging and health prob-lems are affected by how the brain reacts 
to sexual expectations. 
The study revealed male flies that an-
ticipated sexual activity but were denied the opportunity to mate experienced more stress, a decrease in fat stores and resis-tance to starvation.
The sexually frustrated male fruit flies 
had shorter lives than those that mated. The results indicated that sensory percep-tion and psychological state are in a part of the brain that affects long-term health.
Though UF students are a bit more 
complex than fruit flies, the results might have implications for students’ lives. Frus-tration is related to not getting something you are expecting and is linked to a higher level of stress, said Samantha Evans, sex-ual health educator at GatorWell Health Promotion Services. 
In order to be less disappointed over 
expectations, partners should communi-cate what they hope to get out of the rela-tionship, Evans said.
Zee Krstic, an 18-year-old UF journal-
ism freshman, said he does simple things to relax.
“When I was little, my sister used to 
show me these little tricks to calm me down,” Krstic said. “Just little practices like pushing my hands together and tak-ing deep breaths and pausing for a couple seconds.”
Flies have needs, too: Sexual frustration could shorten life“I’ve put myself out 
there, and the support and 
response has been huge.”

UF alumna� SEVERAL SENATORS 
MOTIONED TO TABLE THE RESOLUTION UNTIL THE JAN. 7 MEETING.
COLLEEN WRIGHT
Alligator Staff Writer cwright@alligator.org
World politics were introduced 
to the chambers at the final Student 
Senate meeting of the semester.
The Senate’s holiday tradition 
of wearing tacky sweaters on the last meeting before Winter Break was set aside for a more serious matter Tuesday night. 
A controversial resolution con-
demning the Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions Movement was added to the agenda on the floor. It was eventually tabled for dis-cussion after Winter Break.
According to the Palestinian 
BDS National Committee’s web-site, the movement calls for the end of all financial partnerships with the State of Israel because of Israel’s human rights violations against Palestinians. 
Fully supporting the move-
ment means UF would have to terminate 20 study-abroad pro-grams, six Hebrew classes and its partnership with PepsiCo, a part-ner of Israeli food manufacturer Strauss Group, according to the resolution.As such, the resolution states  
Senate does not support legisla-tion that would further the move-ment.
A resolution is a nonbinding 
piece of legislation that represents the opinion of the Senate.
Students from Gators for Israel, 
Students for Justice in Palestine and Students for a Democratic So-ciety overflowed into the aisles. 
“BDS targets institutions and 
corporations, not study-abroad programs,” said Farah Khan, vice president of Students for Justice in Palestine.
Vice President of UF’s Jewish 
Student Union Corey Flayman encouraged senators to oppose the BDS movement because of UF’s large Jewish student population and the U.S.’s strong relationship with Israel.
Because many senators were 
unfamiliar with the issue, several senators motioned to table the legislation until the Senate recon-venes Jan. 7.
“This is about potentially mar-
ginalizing students on either side,” said Sen. Paul O’Quinn.
The vote was close: 40 senators 
for tabling and 35 opposed. So the emotionally charged issue will continue into the new year.
“This is probably the least 
black-and-white issue on earth,” Sen. Joshua Goldsmith said.WEDNESDAY, DECEMBER 4, 2013 � ALLIGATOR, 9

Gators can put a little extra emphasis on 
the green in this season’s color palette by tak-
ing advantage of the Gator-themed e-cards released by the university. 
Jim Harrison, director of Creative Services 
for UF, said the holiday cards are a part of the university’s Think Before You Ink campaign, which aims to reduce paper consumption on campus. 
The designs include a cheerful Gator snow-
man, the glowing Century Tower and snow-ﬂ  akes made out of alligators. All of the cards are available to download at bit.ly/1beZ8xP, and some can be chosen with or without ac-companying text. 
Sharon Eyman, publications coordinator 
for UF Creative Services, said the ofﬁ  ce re-ceives several calls every year asking when the e-cards will be ready. This is about the ﬁ  fth year the cards have been available.
“We just explored some ideas of what 
people might want to send in an e-card: some serious ones, some photography ones, some fun ones,” she said. 
Al Kirby, a web professional for UF Cre-
ative Services, said there have been about 500 page views for the cards since they were made available about two weeks ago, but there is no count of how often the cards have been down-loaded.
“We just try to keep them fresh and new to 
give faculty, staff and students an interesting way to express themselves,” Harrison said. E-cards help Gators do goodSTATE

MIAMI — A Miami artist is building a 
giant mechanical alligator to raise aware-
ness about the Florida Everglades, with plans to ﬂ  oat it in Biscayne Bay during the city’s well-known Art Basel festival.
Part of Lloyd Goradesky’s “Gator in 
the Bay” ﬂ  oated last year, but this time, the project will be much larger — the length of a football ﬁ  eld.
On Tuesday, 140 ﬂ  oating tiles arrived. 
They will create the alligator’s “tail” once they are put together and towed by the motorized alligator head.
“I think if anyone was given an op-
portunity to save the world, I think they would probably take the time to do that,” Goradesky said. “And I was more anxious to recognize the importance of the Ever-glades, being from Miami.”
Each tile is actually a photomosaic 
of wildlife images from the Everglades. When seen from a distance, they create the illusion of an alligator’s torso behind the motorized head that itself features a mechanical jaw.
Goradesky says photomosaic art is not 
new — but he thinks the scale of his proj-ect is.
“I decided to take that concept and 
raise the bar. I wanted to create illusion. That’s what my art is all about.”
The tiles are expected to be towed Sat-
urday, with an aerial shot showing the fully-deployed alligator. Gorodesky then plans to sell the tiles to cover the costs of his project.Artist builds mechanical

Gainesville Police arrested a local man 
Tuesday who has been wanted on charges 
of robbing a local ice cream restaurant in late October.
Ofﬁ  cers arrested 23-year-old John Gabe 
Gaddy on charges of armed robbery, kid-napping and possession of a weapon by a convicted felon, among other charges, ac-cording to Alachua County Jail records.
U.S. Marshals Florida Regional Fugi-
tive Task Force ofﬁ  cers found Gaddy in an apartment at 1053 SE 10th Place, said GPD spokesman Ofﬁ  cer Ben Tobias.
On Oct. 27, Gaddy entered the Eastside 
Sweet Dreams Homemade Ice Cream of Gainesville, 1040 E. University Ave., ac-cording to Alligator archives. He forced the female clerk into the bathroom at gunpoint and then took money from the register.
A little more than a week after the in-
cident, ofﬁ  cers issued a warrant for his ar-rest.
According to court records, Gaddy has 
previously been arrested for battery, rob-bery and criminal mischief. He was booked into jail at about 5 p.m. Tuesday, where he remained in lieu of an $800,000 bond.Ice cream shop robber found WEDNESDAY, DECEMBER 4, 2013  ALLIGATOR, 13 12, ALLIGATOR  WEDNESDAY, DECEMBER 4, 2013

Middle right: Daniel Ratovoson, or 
“Little Sunshine” as he’s nicknamed, celebrates his 18th birthday on Nov. 10 with his mother, and his older brother and caretaker, Joel Ratovoson, 26.Daniel Ratovoson was born at just 26 
weeks old. He suffers from cerebral palsy, 
a brain disorder that affects muscle tone, movement and motor skills. The journey has not been easy for him or his family. He needs constant daily monitoring and care — anywhere from feeding to bathing. But together they persevere.Ratovoson is a senior at Gainesville 
High School and a member of the Noah’s Endeavor program. On Nov. 10, Ratovoson turned 18 — an age that is typically a “rite  of passage” for adolescents in which they seek independence from family and start lives of their own. But for Ratovoson, that is a transition only dreamt of in books read to him by caretakers and family members. 
Despite his disorder, Ratovoson 
participates in a multitude of activities, including baseball, swimming, soccer and bowling on a weekly basis. “I have been trying, as his mom, to find the best way for Daniel to be like any other kids,” said Charlotte Ravel, his mother.

Lily Svete has brought her 
Indiana basketball roots to the Florida women’s basketball team. Read the story on page 22.Senior Bowl
Jon Halapio announced via Twitter on Tuesday that he has been invited to participate in the Senior Bowl in January. Another year has come and gone 
for the alligatorSports Brand Picks Column, and we’re in a 
nostalgic mood. 
In our last edition of this fall semes-
ter, we would like to thank you for read-ing this column each and every week. 
In the spirit of nostalgia and reflec-
tion, we would like to look back at the year that was. Although, Florida stum-bled to a 4-8 record in 2013, we feel we performed much better. 
As you’ve come to expect, we here 
at the alligatorSports Brand Picks Col-umn have a lot of pride and even more bravado. 
So, to reflect that, we’ve decided 
to do a “Best Of” when it comes to this week’s insults of our pickers. But first, alligatorSports columnist Adam Lichtenstein will debate the Atlantic Coast Conference title game between Duke and Florida State with a special “guest.”
 Florida State (-29.5) will leave Duke 
longing for 2013 because... 
Jameis Winston is the best player 
in the nation. End of story. The kid is a beast.
 -Adam Lichtenstein
The Blue Devils (+29.5) will sing 
“Auld Lang Syne” to the Seminoles because...
Go Blue Devils! 
-David Cutcliffe
Now onto the picks! 
Leading the pack at 69-38-5 is al-
ligatorSports Assistant Editor Adam 
“D-II, here I come!” Lichtenstein, who declared he could crack the roster of a Division II basketball team. Sorry, bud. Most teams are probably looking for guys who can actually score.
In second place with a record of 64-
43-5 is alligatorSports Staff Writer Joe “WE DON’T NEED TEBOW, OK?” Morgan, who continues to root for the most hopeless team in the NFL. No Picks

No player who has run through the south 
end zone tunnel in the last four years has gen-
erated as much love, hate, hope and dread as No. 8. 
Trey Burton has delivered cheers and moans 
alike, but his career ended about two hours be-fore he expected.
The senior wide receiver suffered a left 
shoulder injury in the first quarter of Florida’s season-finale loss to Florida State on Saturday, ending a career that has been nothing if not eventful.
“Obviously you don’t want to go out like 
that,” he said. “I felt like I let my team down a little bit. But it’s obviously not something I can control.”
When he suffered the injury, Burton was on 
the verge of perhaps his finest hour.
With quarterback Tyler 
Murphy out for the third straight game due to a sprained shoulder and third-stringer Skyler Mornhinweg struggling to fill the void, Burton was going to see as much action as he had in any 
other game in his career.
Coach Will Muschamp 
and former offensive coordinator Brent Pease planned to hand the keys of the offense over to Burton, lining him up at quarterback for more than 30 snaps.
“We had a counter coming back, we had a 
trap, we had a couple of passes off of [the pack-age],” Muschamp said. “There were just some things we felt good about that Trey had repped all week. We had a lot of confidence in him. Ev-ery time he’s been in those situations he’s per-formed very well.”
Added Burton: “We had a bunch of [plays] 
… I was excited for the opportunity and I was going to try to make the most of it. It got cut a little short.”
For a moment, it looked like the strategy 
might work.

jury Monday night during No. 15 Florida’s 65-64 loss to No. 12 UConn was a high right ankle sprain, the team announced Tuesday afternoon.
X-rays conducted Tuesday were negative for any breaks and tears. 
No timetable for the point 
guard’s return has been set at this time, UF added.
Wilbekin suffered the injury 
late in Monday’s contest and did not play the final 3:01 against the Huskies. Coming down from a rebound attempt, he landed awkwardly on UConn guard Ryan Boatright’s foot. Wilbekin fell to the ground holding his right ankle before play stopped and trainers escorted him to the locker room. 
Without Wilbekin during the 
final stretch of the game, Flori-da moved the ball well and kept the game close until UConn guard Shabazz Napier sunk a buzzer-beater to win it for the Huskies.
Before exiting to the locker room, Wilbekin had 15 points on 6-of-14 shooting and two as-sists against three turnovers.
Wilbekin’s exit is a quick one 
after only playing in Florida’s past three games. He missed the first five games of the regular season due to suspension for violating team rules.
High ankle sprains typi-
cally take about 4-6 weeks to heal. Without Wilbekin, No. 15 Florida could be heading into its home matchup against No. 6 Kansas on Dec. 10 with no true point guards and only six schol-arship players.
Freshman point guard Kasey 
Hill also suffered a high ankle sprain during Florida’s win against Southern on Nov. 18. His original timetable for recov-ery was set for at least a month. 
Hill seems to be making 
progress from his injury, as he has been cleared to walk with-out a protective boot, but he has not been active in UF’s past four contests.
With Florida having limited 
options, sophomore shooting guard Michael Frazier II and forward Dorian Finney-Smith will likely have to assume point guard duties against the Jay-hawks.
Swingman DeVon Walker 
(mid-foot sprain) played mini-mal minutes against UConn but should be in better health when facing the Jayhawks, barring any setbacks. 
Combo guard Eli Carter, who 
has yet to regain full strength after suffering a broken leg in February, is opting for a medical redshirt and will not be avail-able. Sophomore guard Dillon Graham (bone spurs in hips) is out for the season.Wilbekin out indefinitely with high ankle sprain

Rather than play limited minutes for 
the Gators on a hobbled right leg, guard 
Eli Carter will sit out the remainder of the season and earn a medical redshirt, ac-cording to SNY.tv. The junior suffered a broken leg while 
playing for Rutgers on Feb. 16 against De-Paul.
Although he has returned to the court 
in a limited capacity this season, he is still not fully healthy. 
Carter did not see any action on the 
court in Monday’s loss to Connecticut and has averaged fewer than eight minutes in seven games. 
Walk-ons Billy Donovan and Lexx Ed-
wards are the only other healthy players to have averaged less time on the court than Carter.
The transfer from Rutgers, who earned 
a NCAA waiver to play for the Gators this season rather than being forced to sit out a year, was not efficient when he did see playing time. 
Carter scored only three points for 
Florida on 1-of-14 shooting, including 1 of 9 from three-point range. He recorded as many turnovers as he did points.
Coach Billy Donovan did not confirm 
Carter’s medical redshirt, but on Sunday he hinted at the idea.
“That’s probably something that’s go-
ing to happen,” Donovan said. 
“But right now, I think he’s just trying 
to see — can he get better? But as I said before, we’re not going to waste a year just to have him be a guy that’s going to spot somebody to give him a breather. I think he’s done too much in his career. We owe it to him to get him fully healthy and healed and ready to play.”
Turbulent Gators: Delta Airlines is con-
ducting an internal investigation after its partner, ExpressJet, swapped the Florida basketball team’s mechanically dysfunc-tional charter plane for the commercial Delta flight 5059 aircraft in order for the Gators to make their Monday night game against UConn.
While Billy Donovan and his team left 
on time, the unscheduled engine main-tenance on the remaining aircraft forced Delta to cancel flight 5059, which left 50 customers stuck in Gainesville. 
In a statement, Delta announced it ex-
pected the work on the aircraft to be com-pleted quickly, which is why it swapped the planes. 
Passengers were forced to find other 
flights out of Tampa, Orlando or Jackson-ville because of the inconvenience, accord-ing to the Gainesville Sun.

Bahamas Bound: The Battle 4 Atlantis 
tournament announced Florida would be one of the eight teams participating in its 2014 Thanksgiving weekend tournament in Paradise Island, Bahamas. 
The lineup also includes heavyweights 
North Carolina, UCLA, Georgetown, Wis-consin, Butler, Oklahoma and Alabama-Birmingham.
Mike Hill, UF’s executive associate ath-
letic director for external affairs, said he jumped at the chance to join the tourna-ment when the opportunity arose.
“The organizers of the event approached 
us a couple years ago to gauge our interest and obviously it was a pretty short discus-sion, especially when we heard about the other participants,” Hill said. “That’s a big-time field and we felt like we needed to be a part of that.”WEDNESDAY, DECEMBER 4, 2013 � ALLIGATOR, 19

Trey Burton reaches to catch a punt during Florida’s 30-10 victory against Arkansas 
on Oct. 5 in Ben Hill Grifﬁ  n Stadium. Burton ﬁ  nished the season with one touchdown.
Senior injured in ﬁ  nal game 
out of the much-maligned Wildcat package, 
and the Gators were threatening to take a quick lead against the heavily favored Seminoles.
But after one more Wildcat snap, Burton left 
the game due to the injury, and his season end-ed in as much disappointment as Florida’s did.
“It was deﬁ  nitely a blow, but we had to 
regroup there and be able to execute without him,” Mornhinweg said. “He was a key com-ponent to our offense.”
Burton made a name for himself almost 
immediately after arriving at Florida. He com-pleted 12 of 18 passes for a touchdown and ran for 128 yards and two more scores in the 2010 spring game. He made an immediate impact that season.
As a freshman, Burton scored 12 touch-
downs — six of which came in a record out-burst at home against Kentucky — and took part in the Gators’ rotating quarterback system. 
However, he was a runner ﬁ  rst, throwing only six passes all season while rushing 75 times.
The next two seasons, Burton moved around 
the ﬁ  eld, even contemplating a move to defense, as he struggled to move the ball. Although he had bright moments, including a two-touch-down performance against a Tennessee in 2012, he often strained to make even modest gains.
However, Burton quietly succeeded in his 
ﬁ  nal college season, providing a security blan-ket to Florida’s again-rotating door of quarter-backs. The senior found his home in the lineup as the Gators’ slot receiver, notching 445 yards on 38 receptions — third on the team in both categories.
Burton will look to stick at receiver in the fu-
ture. He said he plans to enter May’s NFL Draft as a wideout. He said after the loss to FSU that he had not thought much about his future after college, but he was happy with the way his ca-reer unfolded.
“I obviously wanted it to go a different way,” 
he said, “but I’m extremely thankful for the four years I had here.” BURTON , from page 18WEDNESDAY, DECEMBER 4, 2013 � ALLIGATOR, 21
ugly uniform combination or 
washed-up quarterback will ever save that franchise. 
Coming in at third place at 60-
47-5 is alligatorSports Editor Phil-lip “Holier Than Thou” Heilman, who recently decided to impart some life lessons while playing Madden on Xbox Live. Listen, bud. When you follow up some sage advice by eating a potato chip off your bare chest, it’s hard to take you seriously.
Leading the non-alligator-
Sports division and in fourth place overall with a record of 57-50-5 is the Orlando Sentinel’s Edgar “OMG! Im so sry u guys 4 real!” Thompson, who sent a mass email to fellow beat writers following a relatively minor shared transcrip-tion snafu. Good Lord, Edgar. Why were you so apologetic? You act like we’re your only friends or something. Oh...
Up next in ﬁ  fth place is Fight-
inGators.com’s Cody “MIA” Jones, who we don’t even remem-ber seeing at the Georgia South-ern game. Sad thing is, we just now realized he wasn’t there. Or maybe he was. Oh, well.
Tied for sixth at 56-51-5 is In-
sidetheGators.com’s Bryan “3-6-9!” Holt, who expressed his affection for the Lil Jon banger “Get Low” this week. Holt knows a thing or two about getting low, if you know what we mean (He’s short).
Also tied for sixth is 247sports.
com’s Thomas “Bueller? Buel-ler?” Goldkamp, who decided to cut class on Wednesday while the rest of us were enlightened by Professor Durkin. Whether or not he crashed an expensive sports car, we don’t know.
And in dead-ass last place 
with a piss-poor record of 55-52-5 is Staff Writer Adam “Road trip nightmare” Pincus, who sweat profusely throughout the trip to Kentucky and  stepped on a poor, innocent butterﬂ  y while stumbling out of the car at a gas station.

James Naismith, basketball’s creator, said 
in 1936, “Basketball really had its beginnings 
in Indiana, which remains today the center of the sport.”
Those words still ring true. The sport may have been born in Mas-
sachusetts, but it came of age in Indiana — basketball’s breadbasket. 
The Gators have an Indiana connection. 
Redshirt senior Lily Svete hails from the South Bend, Ind.
Growing up so close to Notre Dame — 
her father, Lee, is the Associate Vice Presi-dent for the school’s Division of Student Affairs — she was naturally drawn to the Fighting Irish and their basketball teams at a young age.
“We went (to basketball games) all the 
time,” Svete said. “All the time. I went to so many guys games and girls games.”
Naturally, Lily and her little brother, Leo, had a hoop in their driveway.
“We’ve played since we were little,” Sve-
te said. “My dad had us in the gym since we were like 2 years old. We were always busy shooting on Saturday mornings.”
Basketball’s presence in 
Indiana is palpable. Hoops adorn driveways, trees, barn doors and silos. The state is home to some of basketball’s most promi-nent ﬁ  gures.
Great shooters are 
aplenty in Indiana. Look no further than Larry “The 
Hick from French Lick” Bird and Oscar “The Big O” Robertson, who averaged 24.3 and 25.7 points per game throughout their ca-reers, respectively. 
“Everything up in Indiana is so funda-
mental,” Svete said. “It’s all about your shooting form. If you don’t have perfect shooting form, people don’t respect you as a shooter.
“Everybody can shoot. It’s just the cul-
ture up there.”
The lore of high school basketball in Indi-
ana is unrivaled.
The state has 12 of the nation’s 13 largest 
high school gymnasiums, according to the New York Times. New Castle Fieldhouse is the largest high school basketball gym in the world, boasting a capacity of 9,325.
In 36 years, Indiana has produced 41 
McDonald’s All-Americans — more than Florida, Ohio, Pennsylvania and Georgia, and trailing only Illinois, New York and California.
Svete excelled at Mishawaka Penn (Ind.) 
High. However, if a player in Indiana wants full recognition, playing AAU is a must.
“High school was serious, but AAU was 
always bigger,” Svete said.
“I went (to Penn High) with my point 
guard that I always played AAU with, Kelsey Reynolds. She plays at DePaul now.”Svete and Reynolds bucked the trend at 
Penn by making the varsity team as fresh-men — a rare feat at the school.
“We were really the ﬁ  rst freshmen to play 
varsity,” Svete said. “We started, which was kind of a big deal.”
Being the basketball hotbed that Indiana 
is, Svete played against phenomenal talent.
Skylar Diggins, the third overall selection 
in the 2013 WNBA draft and the all-time leading scorer at Notre Dame, was one of Svete’s regular opponents. 
Diggins played for Washington (Ind.) 
High.
“[Diggins] was in my conference,” Svete 
said. “We never got out of the sectional be-cause we always played her team and got beat ... Like, we would go 19-2 and the two losses would be to Washington.”
In her senior season at Penn, Svete made 
the Indiana All-Star team.

LANDON PUNCHES
If you’re a Florida fan and 
you’re reading this right now, you probably hate Shabazz 
Napier’s guts.
After what he did to your team 
Monday night, it’s understand-
able. Napier scored 26 points — including No. 12 Connecticut’s ﬁ  nal six — to beat No. 15 Florida 65-64 on Monday night in Storrs, Conn. 
Late in the game, the senior 
guard made two keys shots — a buzzer-beater on a second-chance opportunity and a four-point play on the previous possession.
But if you analyze the tape, 
you’ll realize luck — and ofﬁ  ciat-ing — did not go in UF’s favor late in the game on those two plays. 
The Buzzer-Beater: The ﬁ  -
nal possession of the game was a frantic mess that saw many small breaks work in the Huskies’ favor. 
With 17.7 seconds left in the 
game and his team down by a point, Napier took up the ball and then proceeded to use a pick from forward DeAndre Daniels. But Florida doubled on the pick-and-roll with Patric Young and Casey Prather to trap Napier.
The elusive Napier split the 
double team, losing his handle on the ball but regaining it after about  half of a second. He then forced an off-balance jumper from the right elbow that clanked off the back-board.
Before any Gator could jump 
for the rebound, Daniels back-tapped the ball — intentionally or accidentally — and Napier some-how found himself with the ball in his hands at the free-throw line for one more shot.
Even with the 6-foot-6 Prather 
running toward Napier, sticking a hand in the Connecticut guard’s face, Napier released the shot with only 0.4 seconds to spare and sunk it.
All ﬁ  ve Gators should not have 
converged down low for the re-bound. Florida should have stuck a man on a player as dangerous as Napier at all times. On the re-bound attempt, UF left him unat-tended.
But Florida coach Billy Dono-
van made a good point after the game. If the ball were tipped any-where else, the Gators would have won the game. It was a ﬂ  uky play.
The Four-Point Play: After 
the game, Donovan said the refs made a mistake calling a foul on Dorian Finney-Smith during Napier’s three-point shot on the right wing.

FIRE JOE MORGAN
Former alligatorSports Editor Matt Watts looked at 
my computer screen and laughed.
“Try again,” he said.
“You’re kidding me, right?”“Try again.”“Seriously?”“Try again.”That was the fourth time Watts rejected my story. It 
was Spring 2012.
“Your lede sucks. Try again.”It took me six tries before I ﬁ  nally turned in a lede to 
his liking.
Now that I think about it, Watts was probably messing 
with me. Knowing Watts, he would deﬁ  nitely screw with me like that for his own entertainment, but I digress.
I don’t remember that story’s subject, whom I quoted 
in it or even that damn lede. But I remember the process, one that deﬁ  ned my time at the Alligator.
The people who know me would never tell you this be-
cause they’re way too nice, but I stumble often. Few things ever go right the ﬁ  rst time, but I prefer it that way.
I learn from the bruises.The ﬁ  rst time I applied for a job at the Alligator, I came 
in conﬁ  dent. Just like everyone else who applies to join our section, I was the sports editor at my high school pa-per.
I wrote stories about concussions, extreme weight loss 
in wrestling and Michael Vick’s return to the NFL after spending time in prison on dog ﬁ  ghting charges.
Damn, I was hot stuff.But the Alligator disagreed. They rejected me.I was so mad I didn’t pick up that damn newspaper for 
two months.
But instead of giving up, I immersed myself in blog-
ging, writing about Gators sports like a madman.Sure, I was mediocre, but the 
guys at the Alligator must have appreciated my work ethic or de-termination or something, so they hired me when I re-applied four months later.
But I wasn’t done stumbling.When I began writing this col-
umn in May 2012, I didn’t know 
what I was getting into.
I still struggle with the words I write here because of 
the platform this paper gives me. I have been extremely fortunate to work with incredibly talented people at the largest student-run college newspaper in the country.
Thanks to the work of much better reporters and col-
umnists before me, I have this space to give my opinions — and the occasional #HotSportsTake — to a wide audi-ence.
For that, and for you, I’m thankful.I’m always thankful for the nice emails and the retweets, 
but I’m even more thankful for the times y’all let me have it. It’s happened a lot, and y’all know who you are.
Some of the feedback was funny simply because of how 
ridiculous it was. But I am more appreciative of the times — and there were many — when you called me out for a dumb column or respectfully disagreed with my other more salient opinions.
At times, I stumbled, but I have learned how to get 
back up.
I appreciate you either kicking me while I was down 
or, more often, lifting me up. Without you, this column and the experience of a lifetime would not be possible.
I have written 348 stories and nearly every alligator-
Sports Brand Picks Column from the past two years, but as Will Muschamp says, “It’s not add water, instant play-er writer.”I have a support system to thank.To Caroline, thank you for being so amazing and stay-
ing up late at night to talk to me after I got off from work. I know I’ve cost you hours and hours of sleep.
To my parents and sisters, thanks for your love and 
support.
To Adam, thanks for taking a chance on a mediocre 
blogger.
To Watts, thanks for the tough love.To Luca, thank you for your guidance and dealing with 
my insanity. Without you, this job would have probably destroyed me.
To Phillip, thanks for being a friend, building me up 
and being a terriﬁ  c colleague since we were both bright-eyed amateurs covering women’s basketball.
To Edgar and Joe, thanks for your wisdom and your 
experience.
To Brooksie, Sean, John and Dan, thanks for being 
great SID’s.
To Boothe, Tom, Holt, Jett and Katie, thank you for be-
ing awesome co-workers and making the ofﬁ  ce an amaz-ing environment.
To Jurnovoy, Pincus, Adam, Riva and Rachel, thank 
you for not killing us in car accidents. Y’all made those football road trips bearable.
To Corey, Fink, the other Jurnovoy and Jordan, thanks 
for cleaning up my messes.
And to those of you I haven’t named or forgotten, I’m 
sorry. There are simply too many people to count.
I’ve gone on too long here, so I’ll leave you with this.Muschamp likes to describe his toughest players as 
guys who “stick their face in the fan.”
Every time I wrote this column, I stuck my face in the 
fan. The blades nicked me every now and then, but there was nothing like that cool breeze.
Thanks for reading. Columnist thankful for lessons learned through mistakes
