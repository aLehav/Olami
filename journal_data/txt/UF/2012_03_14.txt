UF can start crafting insurance plans under GatorCare af-
ter the legislature approved faculty and staff to be self-insured 
with the plan last week.
GatorCare has been in the making for well over a year, vice 
president of Human Resource Services Paula Fussell said. About 22 self-insurance plans, including GatorGradCare, which cov-ers graduate assistants, will fall under the GatorCare umbrella 
beginning Jan. 1, pending Gov. Rick Scott’s approval.
Details about individual plan options won’t be worked out 
until early-to-mid-summer, Fussell said. 
Employees will be covered by GatorCare on the ﬁ  rst day of 
hire rather than having to wait a month for their insurance to become effective.
Faculty Senate chairman Scott Nygren said faculty mem-
bers have voiced concerns about whether they’ll be allowed to keep their doctors and whether they’ll be offered a preferred provider organization option with their health care plans.  
Fussell said there will be an option that allows employees to 
keep their doctors, although plans might include incentives to use UF doctors in the GatorCare network.
The university is collecting feedback from faculty and staff 
members, graduate assistants and postdoctoral fellows to tailor insurance plan options to their needs, Fussell said.

A Gainesville man was charged with try-
ing to steal multiple bicycles Monday night in an apartment complex off 34th Street.
Chadrick Smith, 40, was arrested at about 
11:30 p.m. at Museum Walk Apartments on 
charges of loitering and prowling, according 
to an arrest report.While walking his dog in an apartment 
complex located at 3500 SW 19th Ave., a tenant saw a man tampering with the locks of bikes along a bike rack. There was a wire cutter next to the man, according to the arrest report.
The tenant walked up to his apartment and 
called 911.
GPD arrived at the scene and saw Smith 
walking in front of the bike racks.
The ofﬁ  cer asked Smith if he lived in the complex, and Smith said he was just walking through. Smith told the ofﬁ  cer he walked from two different directions. He then volun-teered to be searched. The 
ofﬁ  cers found a bike light and two pairs of gloves.
After examining the 
bikes on the bike rack, GPD saw two cable locks that had been tampered with. One of the ofﬁ  cers said they looked as if they had been cut, and he found red metal wire cutters in the bushes by the rack.
The witness came out and identiﬁ  ed Smith 
as the person he saw with the wire cutter.
Smith was taken to the Alachua County Jail 
and was still in custody as of Tuesday night.

Roy Broderick screamed, “What 
the f--k?” as he passed through 
Turlington Plaza on Tuesday morning.
Survivors of the Abortion Ho-
locaust, a national Christian abor -
tion-awareness organization, will be back on Turlington Plaza and outside Library West today.
The organization displays pic-
tures of blood-covered fetuses, other graphic images and the phone number of the Crisis Preg-
nancy Center.
“I understand that they have 
freedom of speech here, and it is 
important, but this is taken to the 
extreme,” said Broderick, a 22-year-old telecommunication major. “I could have just had lunch.”
Jayne White, a spokeswoman 
for Survivors, handed out fliers 
and talked to students Tuesday.
In general, the reaction is apa-
thetic, she said. However, she has 
seen people break down and cry, 
tell her she’s doing a wonderful job and openly yell at her.
Survivors, which is based in 
southern California, visits college 
campuses, junior colleges and high 
schools around the United States.
“Sometimes people ask us how 
we are allowed to be,” said Sarah 
Maher, another member of Survi-
vors. “When the police come, we have to tell them it is our right to 
free speech. That it is in the consti-
tution.”4, ALLIGATOR §  WEDNESDAY, MARCH 14, 2012

A new nightclub in Midtown will open its 
doors for the first time tonight.
Envy replaced Club XS, which closed Feb. 
29 and underwent construction during Spring 
Break. Workers had 13 days to transform the 
bar in time for its grand opening.
Owners Rob Zeller and Mike Akey said 
they spent about $40,000 transforming the 
club.
“XS was more of a ’90s and 2000s club,” 
Zeller said. “It was outdated and needed a change.”
Prices for drinks and admission will remain 
the same.
The owners hired an interior designer to 
order the new bars, create a new color scheme 
and find an artist to decorate the walls.
The wooden bars were replaced with two 
custom bars. The front bar is faux marble, and 
the main bar is textured silver with white mar -
bling.
The entrance area has a green mural on 
the main wall and lighting that ripples on the walls, giving the illusion that the room is un-derwater.The green swirl continues on the wall op-
posite the main bar. The wall behind the main bar was replaced with black marble, with $200 tea lights over the top of the silver bar.
A wall lined with lighting that fades into 
different colors surrounds the VIP area. The sound system and bathrooms were also up-dated. Zeller said that the bar’s transformation is about 80 percent finished.
“We did a lot in 13 days, but we couldn’t 
get everything done,” he said.
Zeller and Akey plan to add new tables 
and upholstery to the VIP area, update the DJ booth and add a private bar in the VIP area.Rick Rosenbluth, general manager for Envy 
and Gator City , said the new club has a more sophisticated feel.
“A lot of people say Midtown isn’t a place 
for a nightclub,” Rosenbluth said. “But Mid-town can be whatever you want it to be. Why not dance?”
A new signature drink will be introduced 
at the club’s opening. The Emerald Night is a 
mixture of rum, amaretto, pineapple, Sprite 
and Blue Caraco.
Linda Riedemann, a 25-year-old UF gradu-
ate, said she has been a bartender at XS for four years and is ready for a change.
“It doesn’t look like a dive bar anymore,” 
she said. “They actually put thought into de-cor and the atmosphere instead of throwing it all together.”Revamped Midtown nightclub Envy opens doors tonight

A Gainesville man was 
robbed while stting in a car 
Monday night.
Jevin D. Hilliard, 18, of 2231 
NW 65th Road, was charged with robbery with a firearm, and he remained at Alachua County Jail with a $26,000 bond Tuesday evening.
Sean W. Birstein, of Alachua, 
was sitting in his car in the Pine Ridge Apartments parking lot at 9:45 p.m. Monday when Hilliard opened the passenger-side door. Hilliard sat down and aimed a silver revolver at Birstein’s head, according to police.
“Give me your f--king mon-
ey,” Hilliard said.
Birstein handed over nine $20 bills, and Hilliard took off. 
Birstein then drove to a nearby 
Kangaroo Express and called 
911.
A GPD officer found a 
man matching the description Birstein had provided walking 
on North-west 26th Street soon 
after. The of-ficer stopped Hilliard, and Birstein later i d e n t i f i e d Hilliard as 
the man who robbed him, ac-cording to police.
After his arrest, Hilliard de-
nied the crime, though he said he had been in the area and had heard arguing.

After shelling out $179,000, the Alachua County 
Commission is one step closer to deciding whether to 
add more staff and services to the county’s jail.
The decision has been a topic of county conversa -
tion for the last year and a half.
In a presentation during Tuesday’s County Com-
mission meeting, a criminal justice consulting firm recommended that the county hire more employees to run the Alachua County Jail.
In October 2011, the county hired Pulitzer/Bogard 
& Associates to research the jail’s efficiency and find areas that could be improved.
The survey collected by the firm showed inmates 
weren’t happy with the quality and quantity of the food they were given, their access to medical care and sanitation inside cell block air vents. Employees felt the facility was understaffed.
“It wasn’t like Trip Advisor where they gave a cer -
tain number of stars,” Bogard said of the survey.
David Bogard, principal at Pulitzer/Bogard & As-
sociates, and the two other members of the firm told the commission they concluded that the county should consider hiring 34 employees to increase security, en-hance maintenance and reduce employee overtime.
The decision to hire the firm to do the survey came after Alachua County Sheriff Sadie Darnell, who man-
ages the jail, asked the commission to hire 46 employ-
ees, which would have cost the county about $2 mil-lion.
The firm surveyed 232 inmates, 163 current and 
former jail employees and 15 members of the public. The jail holds between 900 and 1,000 inmates and em-ploys 330 people, according to the county Sheriff’s Of-fice’s website.
The conclusion of the study comes at a crucial time, 
said Commissioner Mike Byerly.
The agreement between the Alachua County Sher -
iff’s Office and the county expires this year, leaving management of the jail in question. Budget cuts are also on the horizon.
Commissioner Paula DeLaney said in an interview 
that she thinks the commission will vote to keep the jail in the hands of the sheriff.
Because the commission is trying to reduce spend-
ing, she said she can’t predict whether it will agree to hire more employees and add new programs to the jail.

Insect experts said there will be 
more bugs in Gainesville during the 
next few months due to an unusually warm winter.
The insect survivors of the not-so-
cold winter can now feed and repro-
duce sooner and faster.
Insects regulate their body tempera-
tures by moving around. During win-
ter, it is normally too cold for them to 
move, so they die, said Phil Koehler, UF 
entomology professor.
More insects survived this winter be-
cause they could keep warm, he said.
Fleas, ticks, mosquitoes, chinch bugs 
and ants all easily survived the winter, Koehler said.
A warm winter brings in more rev-
enue and boosts business earlier and longer, said Harold Raughley, owner of Anyone Can Do It Pest Control & Lawn Care.
“We are going to see bugs earlier 
than we normally do and later than we normally do because of higher popula-
tions,” he said.
Even though it isn’t an epidemic, he 
said, this will be a serious issue.
He said insects can ruin a home, 
lawn or business.
“People don’t like to be bothered, 
especially with blood-sucking insects,” 
Raughley said.

Andrew Small didn’t think he was look-
ing at an Internet star when a skinny puppy 
wandered out of the woods near his bus stop in Crystal River. The 11-year-old just thought he found the dog he had always longed for.
This year, Small, now 17, and his dog Ti-
ger, now 7, have achieved unexpected fame after he started a blog featuring pictures of Tiger balancing food on her head.
The blog, foodonmydog, shows picture 
after picture of the brindle Staffordshire terrior-bulldog mix sitting frozen, managing everything from a taco to a stack of pancakes to a few Twinkies.
CNN and Buzzfeed recently ran stories 
about the blog’s unusual nature.
“On the Internet, people like animals and 
funny things to look at to waste time,” Small said. “It fits perfectly.”
It was Small’s father who trained Tiger to do tricks like balancing a treat on her nose.
One day in late December 2011, Small 
thought it would be funny to balance leftover sandwich ingredients on Tiger’s head and take some pictures.
“I sent it to my friends and they all thought 
it was really funny,” he said, “so I kept doing it.”
After a month, he and Tiger had 150 fol-
lowers on Tumblr. In one day in January, the number jumped about 2,000. CNN took no-tice, airing a short piece a few days later with several pictures of Tiger balancing food.
Foodonmydog now has about 21,000 fol-
lowers. Small hired a press agent and made a deal to receive commission from a T-shirt company that prints pictures of Tiger. He is also working on a plan to change the do-
main name from a Tumblr address to its own 
URL.
His sister, Amanda, is a second-year phar -
macy student at UF. She runs the foodonmy -
dog Facebook page and is still shocked by her dog’s newfound fame.
“It blows my mind,” the 21-year-old said.

Government does 
not control gas prices
Gas prices do not seem to be decreasing any time soon, 
and the increased prices may become a major issue in the presidential campaign depending on how high they 
go this summer.
Before voters decide their presidential pick in November, we 
want to caution them about one aspect of this issue: The presi-dent has little to no control over gas prices.
A major talking point for Republican presidential contender 
Newt Gingrich is his promise to lower gas prices to $2.50 per 
gallon.
While nationwide gas prices currently stand at $3.80 per gal-
lon, that much of a reduction would probably be a big boost to 
the economy.
But no matter who is sitting in the Oval Office come Janu-
ary , there is little that person will be able to do about the price of gas.
The public, on the other hand, seems to think that the presi-
dent can and should do more to help ease its burden at the pump. 
According to a recent Washington Post-ABC News poll, only 26 
percent of respondents approve of the way Obama is “handling the situation with gas prices.”
This is not a partisan thing, either. When gas prices were up 
in 2005 and 2006, only 20 to 26 percent of the public approved of 
President Bush’s handling of gas prices.
Who really controls the price of gasoline? The answer is 
simple: no one. There is not a bureaucrat sitting in an office in 
Washington, DC, determining the price of gasoline, and there never should be.
The price of gas is determined by the supply and demand of 
oil, the cost of refining and gasoline taxes. Even if all gasoline 
taxes were eliminated (something that would likely never occur 
due to the fact that revenue funds highway projects and repairs), 
it would only affect a quarter of the price.
This is a very simplistic explanation considering that there 
is a global market for oil, but the main point is that most of the 
factors affecting the price are out of our hands.
The main thing the government can do to improve the price 
of oil is get out of the way. Not only should it lessen its interven-tion in the oil market, but it should also make it easier for alter -
native energy companies to compete.
The more the government taxes and regulates the energy 
market and intervenes in the Middle East, a major source of oil, the more it will negatively impact the price of gas.
Meanwhile, there’s not much that Gingrich or any of the 
presidential contenders can do. They shouldn’t try, either.
By artificially decreasing gas prices through controls, we will 
experience shortages and a complete shutdown of the move-ment of goods.
V oters should be wary of all grandiose promises made by 
politicians. They should especially be wary of presidential can-
didates who claim they have the ability to change the price at 
the pump.Modern world has become one of ‘fakery’
When I was 10 years old, my family took me to 
Disney World. I had heard about the massive castle that stands in the Magic Kingdom — I 
was rather obsessed with Medieval history at the time, and I imagined a magnificent structure with ramparts and barricades, knights and archers strolling the walls.
I was disappointed, of course, to discover the castle 
was nothing but a rendition of Cinderella’s palace. 
However, I did not give up hope, and I maintained 
my excitement to see a real castle. 
Yet as I entered the plaza and ran my hand over the 
castle’s walls, my excitement abated. The walls were not 
made of stone, rather a synthetic plastic-like substance. 
I was crushed. I felt cheated. I’ve hated Disney World 
ever since.
That same feeling of disappointment is a consistent 
undercurrent of modern life, though it’s often hard to 
put a finger on it. It’s the sort of feeling one gets when driving through a serene country landscape only to find it marred by a billboard, or sitting next to a fireplace in a coffee shop only to find out that it’s electric.
We live in a world of fakery. The same cultural dis-
ease that breeds disingenuous politicians also causes the desks in our classrooms to be coated with laminat-ed, false wood. In a world of consumerism, what mat-
ters most is not the stone might of a castle, the beauty of 
a landscape or the gentility of the heart, but the furtive glance into the mind of the almighty buyer.
Our houses don’t have tile roofs because it’s the best 
material to keep out the rain, they have them for aes-
thetic appeal to a future mortgage-holder. Our politi-
cians don’t spout conservative or liberal talking-points because they believe them, they do so because they want our votes. 
The industrial Gilded Age of the late 19th century 
has nothing on Modern America; we are the real gilded society, the faux-society. We are faux-people because of it.
Because we are the faux-peo-
ple, we do things that would be 
asinine in the eyes of our an-
cestors. We outsource our hu-man relationships to social-net-working sites because we have 
no experience with what a true 
relationship really is, just as we 
have no knowledge of what a true castle really is, or a true house or a true landscape.
We have been told all our lives that this world holds 
some semblance of reality — the billboard-strewn, plas-tic-constructed fake world. If we thought differently, votes and dollars would be at stake.
This fake world has made us comfortable, but what 
has been lost to gain this comfort?
I remember watching a scene from the Coen broth-
ers’ “True Grit” in which Rooster Cogburn was riding his horse through a river. The wind was in his face and the water was pressing upon his horse, but if he let go, 
both his life and the task at hand would be forfeited.
My father, sitting glassy-eyed in a chair next to me, 
said “This isn’t real life. That was real life.” How correct 
he was.
We have been robbed. As the clock was turned and 
the old world passed away, it was decided before we were born that comfort was preferable to reality. Our machines would do the true work — the farming, the conversing, the producing — while we would happily 
waste our lives, marveling at plastic castles and playing 
with iPads next to electric fireplaces.
How low the mighty have fallen. We might look to 
the stars and see our celestial ancestors weeping, if only 
we could tear our eyes away.

Anti-choice group should redirect energy
This letter is addressed to the anti-choice bunch 
that makes its yearly rounds through the colleges and 
universities of our dear country. Because your goal is presumably to prevent the death of innocent unborn children, here are some suggestions for how your time 
and resources would be better spent in pursuit of that 
goal:
Work on improving women’s access to birth con-
trol. Birth control prevents unwanted pregnancies, therefore preventing abortions.
Fight for universal health care to guarantee prenatal 
health for women and health care for new mothers and newborn babies.
Fight for funding for programs such as WIC (a fed-
eral program that supplements food income for low-income pregnant women, new mothers and infants). This would be a great way to provide the safety net necessary to bring a new baby into the world.
Work toward providing free childcare for families. 
Many women may feel they are not ready to have a child because they might be the sole breadwinners in their household, and they simply can not afford to raise a child on their own. If our community offered 
childcare to all families, the decision to carry a preg-
nancy to term might be easier.
Help “Give Voice to the Voiceless” by campaigning 
for women running for Congress. Because pregnancy , motherhood and abortion are issues of concern to women, equal representation in Congress would be a wonderful step to further the policies listed above.
Thank you, and I hope you find our campus a hos-
pitable and open-minded place to practice your free-
dom of speech.

According to some political pundits, there’s a war go-
ing on in the United States. This war doesn’t involve bombs. It involves legislation, and the war isn’t on a 
foreign nation — it’s on women’s health care rights.
The debate began when the Obama administration an-
nounced in January that religious institutions providing health care coverage would be required to provide contracep-tive benefits to women at no extra cost.
This mandate, designed to benefit the reproductive health 
of women, led to a lot of rhetoric, mostly involving GOP pun-dits fuming over this purported intrusion of government. Catholic institutions in particular were outraged, calling this mandate a violation of First Amendment rights.
Controversy (and ridicule) reached a high point when Vir -
ginia Republicans introduced a bill that would require women seeking an abortion to first undergo an invasive transvaginal sonogram.
That bill never passed, but an amended version of it that 
requires a pre-abortion ultrasound was signed last week by Virginia Gov. Bob McDonnell. Since then, the gloves have come off, and state legislators are fighting what seems to be a gender war.
Ohio state Sen. Nina Turner introduced a bill that would 
require men seeking Viagra to first see a sex therapist, receive a cardiac stress test and get a notarized affidavit affirming im-potency signed by a sexual partner.
This joke of a bill is not the only one of its kind: Senators 
have submitted other bills with similar silly requirements, such as a rectal examination, before the prescription of erectile dysfunction drugs.
I can appreciate politicians’ attempts to point out the ab-
surdity of the recent legislation regarding women’s reproduc-
tive issues, but something feels wrong about taxpayers paying politicians to write satire.
These bills have made a mock-
ery of American politics. The battle 
against women’s reproductive health care rights — from requiring 
pre-abortion ultrasounds to fight-
ing against required contraceptive coverage — is an attempt by politi-cians to force their beliefs on their constituency.
Because they cannot make abortion illegal, GOP politicians 
do the next best thing: guilt-trip women who are having abor -
tions.
Contraceptives provide many health benefits, including 
protection from STDs, and it’s clear that for most opponents of the Obama-mandated contraceptive requirements, reli-gious motives take precedence over the health and welfare of women.
It’s one thing for politicians to be ineffective; it’s another for 
them to try to monitor our lives.
Ignoring the rhetoric, we can all agree that the only goal 
of lawmakers with regard to health care issues should be to protect and empower their constituency.
However, many politicians are trying to do the opposite. 
Bills mandating abortion requirements ultimately reduce women’s health rights and have no place in American govern-ment.
Let’s stop fighting battles similar to those our grandpar -
ents had to fight. Women need to stand up against controlling health legislation now and demand independence and full re-spect under the law.

Flaco’s, located at 200 W University Ave., will open a second location in Midtown.
New location will seat six inside and be open Mondays, unlike original
hours at its new location, which will stay open 
until 2:30 a.m. most days of the week.
Flaco’s Midtown location will be open on 
Mondays, unlike its downtown counterpart.
The smaller location will have gas-pow-
ered commercial stoves and fryers, which the restaurant didn’t have before.
“We’re going to have all those fried items 
people like,” Puyana said.
A 500-square-foot suite will house the 
new restaurant, which is a third of the size of the downtown Flaco’s site. Six people can sit down inside the restaurant at a time, but Puy-ana said she has big plans for the restaurant 
next fall.
“Our plan by football season is to have 
walk-up window service,” she said. “Like a 
food truck. I think it’ll be fun during Gator games.”
The second location resulted from a search 
to find a kitchen that could run on gas power, which would allow them to serve more people and cook fried foods. Once the location was 
picked, Puyana said, the owners decided they 
might as well serve food from it, too.Kara Norton, a chemical engineering ju-
nior, said she was excited that Flaco’s was 
opening a location closer to campus. She said 
she likes eating at the restaurant, but she only goes every few weeks because she spends most of her day on campus.
“It’ll be awesome to have Flaco’s available 
for lunch,” she said. “It’d be convenient to eat between classes. It’s good quality and good price.”
Ben Higginbotham, a 23-year-old Flaco’s 
employee, said the restaurant’s fresh food and late hours will bring in customers. He said that the restaurant uses only fresh ingredients in its dishes, which are prepared authentically 
by Puyana’s mother.
“Even if you show up at two in the morn-
ing, you’re eating food that tastes like it was 
made right then,” he said. “You should smell this place in the morning. All the food is being made fresh for the day. It’s unbelievable.”FLACO’S , from page 1JOVAHN HUERTAS

In the wake of a fire that crippled a popular 
pizza place, supporters have rallied to put on  
shows for the restaurant’s out-of-work employ-ees.
Double Down Live will host a Satchel’s Em-
ployee Benefit at 9 p.m. Wednesday .  
The event will feature local bands, including 
So Pastel, the Gleaners and live karaoke band 3rd Base and the Hits, according to Double Down Live’s website.
Admission will be charged on a $5 to $10 slid-
ing scale, with all proceeds benefiting Satchel’s Pizza employees who are out of work. Satchel’s Pizza was hit by a fire on Feb. 28 that caused 
enough damage to keep the restaurant closed for 
an estimated three months.
Several of the bands playing also include 
Satchel’s employees. Wade McMullen, general manager, plays in the Gleaners and 3rd Base and the Hits, and Mark Rodriguez, kitchen manager, plays in So Pastel.The event is the first of two benefit concerts 
being held for the restaurant in March. The sec-ond, scheduled for March 25, is expected to fea-ture local acts Holopaw and Bamboo, and more entertainers are expected to sign up in the com-ing weeks.  
Another benefit concert was held on March 
2 during the “Where the Sidewalk Ends: Fam-
ily Arts Festival” event at the Thornebrook Village shop-ping center. 
Satchel Raye, owner of 
Satchel’s Pizza, said repairs are moving along steadily , and the focus is shifting within the 
next week from cleaning and 
demolition to rebuilding.
Raye said he is humbled 
by the outpouring of support that he and his em-
ployees have received in the past weeks.
“The support has been overwhelming, and 
I am so appreciative of what people have been doing,” he said. “It’s super sweet that the com-munity has come together for us.”Concert to benefit Satchel’s

The co-owner of Hong Kong Deli & Mar -
ket is accused of elbowing his colleague and 
trying to slice an employee with a meat cleav-er.
Gainesville Police arrested Wing O. Yuen, 
54, Monday on battery charges. Yuen de-clined to comment Tuesday evening.
The fight began after Yuen and the res-
taurant’s other co-owner, Zhou Ford, argued in the kitchen of Hong Kong Deli & Market, located at 1236 NW 21st Ave. While the two yelled at each other, Yuen elbowed Ford in the stomach and pushed her away, according 
to an arrest report.
Joshua Ford, Zhou’s husband and an em-
ployee at the store, stepped between Yuen 
and Zhou. Joshua tried to calm Yuen down, but Yuen spit on Joshua and punched him in the face, according to police.
Then, Yuen grabbed a 12-inch-long meat 
cleaver. He pointed the knife at his employee, but Joshua knocked it out of Yuen’s hand.
Yuen next scooped up some metal tongs 
with sharp edges. He swung them at Joshua several times, according to police. Yuen hit Joshua once, causing a small cut on his fore-head.
While working at Hong Kong Deli & Mar -
ket on Tuesday, Joshua declined to comment. There were also two women at the store, but Joshua said they didn’t speak English well.

About 150 people gathered Tues-
day night to hear a doctor and college 
administrator discuss national health 
care and how to improve it.
Dr. Jose Greer, assistant dean of 
academic affairs at Florida Interna-
tional University’s Herbert Wertheim 
College of Medicine, said health care 
reform is worth the sacrifices it will require.
Former Florida Gov. Bob Graham 
introduced Greer in the Bob Graham 
Center for Public Service.
Greer said physicians shouldn’t 
refuse to treat anyone.
“We should be without prejudice, 
but we’re not,” he said.He said the U.S. spends the most 
money on health care in the world, 
yet it does not have the world’s best health care program. 
He said this is unacceptable.“I want to have the healthiest na-
tion,” he said. “I want to do the things that need to be done.”
Society wants to take care of the 
homelessness problem but not the poverty problem, Greer said.
Erica Crump, a 26-year-old UF 
alumna who is applying for medi-
cal school, said she enjoyed hearing 
from someone who shares her values in terms of health care and helping people.

UF student senators passed a resolution against unprec-
edented high tuition increases at Tuesday’s Student Senate 
meeting.
The resolution, which is a statement of opinion, opposed 
Florida legislation that would allow UF’s Board of Trustees to pass tuition increases greater than the current limit for the next academic year.
Tuition increases are currently capped at 15 percent each 
year.The bill passed in the Florida House of Representatives and 
the Senate. It is awaiting approval from Gov. 
Rick Scott.
Students Party Assistant Minority Lead-
er, Sen. Max Stein, said members of his party have already contacted other state universi-ties in opposition to this bill. He said they will create a statewide Facebook group.
“We are going to urge Rick Scott to veto 
this bill,” he said.
Senators also passed resolutions supporting Regional Tran-
sit Systems bus drivers’ contract demands and UF Pi Day.Students Party Minority Leader, Sen. Carly Wilson, also 
spoke at the meeting. She called for the resignation of Sen. Katie Waldman, who was named by former Student Senate President pro tempore Jason Tiemeier as the student walking 
around with him when he threw away hundreds of copies of 
the Alligator on Feb. 20.
Wilson said Waldman could have taken some action at the 
time. She also urged senators who knew what happened to come forward.
“You should not have let this cover-up continue,” she said.Waldman declined to comment after the meeting.Contact Samantha Shavell at sshavell@alligator.org.Student senators voice opposition to possible tuition increases

Residents can help beautify the city this week-
end by spending a day picking up trash.
Keep Alachua County Beautiful, an organiza-
tion devoted to reducing litter and waste in Ala-
chua County, is hosting a kickoff event for the 
Great American Cleanup from 8 a.m. to 1 p.m. 
Saturday at Westside Park.
Volunteers can help by picking up trash and 
litter, painting walls that have graffiti on them and planting flowers and trees.
Mickie MacKenzie, the event’s coordina-
tor and the executive director of Keep Alachua County Beautiful, said the event is especially im-portant because the government uses millions of 
dollars each year to pick up litter. She said money 
can easily be saved when residents volunteer their time.
Volunteers will be given paintbrushes, bins 
for trash and hazardous materials and other re-sources needed to beautify the community.
There will be designated sites, such as city 
properties or approved private sites, to volun-teer.“Anything our volunteers can do is helpful 
in how we are represented to outside visitors,” MacKenzie said. “But also, in the dollars that are saved.”
There will be a continental breakfast at the 
Saturday registration, and a pizza lunch will be provided for all volunteers.
The Great American CleanUp will continue 
until May 31.
Last year, about 2,000 volunteers attended the 
series of events for the cleanup project in Alachua County, said Florence Cline, the former presi-dent of Keep Alachua County Beautiful. She said about 160 miles of streets were cleaned.
She said the event also educates volunteers 
about the negative consequences of littering.
“It makes them more aware of what litter -
ing does to the community ,” Cline said. “And they’re less likely to throw away litter outside 
their cars.”Great American Cleanup

About 100 people snacked on 
brownies Tuesday night as they lis-
tened to not-so-sweet predictions about the future of climate change.
“The word ‘catastrophic’ is in 
fact what we’re talking about to-day,” Unity College President Ste-phen Mulkey told the audience in Smathers Library East.
Mulkey, who was a botany pro-
fessor at UF from 1996 to 2008, pre-sented scientific evidence of climate change. 
His presentation, “Losing Con-
trol of the Global Thermostat — Implications for Florida, the U.S. and the World,” focused on issues of greenhouse gas emissions and combating climate change.
Mulkey said oil, natural gas, 
coal and nuclear fuel account for 90 percent of America’s energy. 
The proportion of carbon diox-
ide emissions is climbing, he said, which is believed to be causing 
more frequent extreme weather 
events.
Jessica Steele, a UF doctoral stu-
dent of geography, said she took home some knowledge on the cli-mate situation.
“There were a lot of statistics and 
figures in there that I was unaware of,” she said. “I learned a lot.”
Mulkey proposed sustainabil-
ity science as the climate-change solution. This applies science from multiple disciplines to solve envi-ronmental problems.
He said UF students can combat 
climate change in a simple way: Get involved.
“Get active. Get politically ac-
tive,” he said. “Get engaged in the political process.”Speaker urges action

Every day at about 4 a.m., Carl 
Bovard is awakened by his 12 cats.
As soon as they see him stir in 
bed, they begin to clamor for his 
attention.
Some of the in-house cats bounce 
around, from couch to countertop to entertainment center, playing 
and creating a ruckus. The outdoor cats, which can see directly into his 
bedroom, begin to pace. Fury will 
whistle. Sita will growl. Amira, Bali, Mohan or Sampson might 
give a small roar.
This is how Bovard, 40, the 
owner and founder of Single Vi-sion, a cat and endangered species 
educational facility in Melrose, starts his morning. Bovard has two 
Bengal tigers, two Siberian tigers, 
two bobcats, three cougars, one lioness and a black leopard in his 
backyard.
He also owns five German 
shepherds, a rabbit, a tortoise, two alligators, a macaw, two Asian 
squirrels, two kinkajous and two 
house cats. In total, there are about 
30 animals at the sanctuary.
His mission is to educate people 
about endangered species.
Bovard’s philosophy is that 
people don’t want to protect an animal they are afraid of. If they visit Single Vision and pet Ram-
page the bobcat or feed Abu the 
lemur, maybe they’ll understand why these animals are so special 
and need to be protected.
Armed with a baby bottle full of 
milk, Bovard entered the cats’ play area, always careful to shut and 
bolt the chain-link doors behind him.
“My cats are friendly,” he said.First out of the gate was Ram-
page, the female bobcat, darting 
around to the back of the enclosure, 
where she teased the four tigers from the other side of the fence.Then came Fury, the female cou-
gar, who diverted her attention to play time, playing tug-of-war with a long branch or scaling the tree in 
the back corner of the enclosure.
Last came Sita, a black leopard 
about the size of a large dog. She slunk out quietly, green eyes flash-
ing in the sunlight, eyeing whatev-er new visitor entered her domain.
She growled and crouched. She 
darted only a couple of feet be-fore Bovard scooped her up in his 
arms.
“I do feel I have a connection 
with most animals,” Bovard said. “I understand them better than I 
understand people.”SHe graduated from Purdue 
University in 1995 with plans to become a veterinarian, but after working in a few clinics, he de-
cided that career wasn’t for him. 
He never wanted to have to put an animal down, perform surgery or 
give a shot.
He took a job in animal care and 
animal training at SeaWorld in Or -
lando.
After two or three years, he ap-
plied for a position as an orca train-er but didn’t qualify. He didn’t 
“have the look” to perform shows for audiences, and he said his voice 
had too much of a Southern twang 
for the microphones.After Bovard quit, he took a job 
at a small, private zoo in Orlando, where he soon was put in charge of 
taking care of all the animals, from 
primates to carnivores to birds. He even wrestled alligators.
The zoo shut down while he 
was there, but not before he met people who owned tigers.
To qualify for the licenses to pri-
vately own a tiger from the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation 
Commission and the Department 
of Agriculture, the applicant must have prior experience working 
with them.
Bovard began volunteering 
with those owners’ cats. When one was ready to give birth, he was put 
on “cub watch” and was present at their birth.The two cubs, Bali and Amira, 
were born in 2005. When zoo own-ers discovered Bali had some vi-
sion problems, they decided they 
no longer wanted to keep the two sisters and offered them to Bo-
vard.
He agreed to take them, and 
Single Vision was born.
He cashed in his 401(k) and 
used his life’s savings to buy the 
property in Melrose.
After the two tiger cubs came 
the dogs. Lemurs and more cats followed.
“I really had no intention of 
growing more than the two tigers I had in the beginning, but then I 
got calls about rescues and animals 
needing homes, and here we are two years later,” Bovard said.
Every Sunday, Bovard treks to 
the local Walmart, where he picks up about 1,400 pounds of meat for 
the week. That totals about $400 
for food per cat. He stores the meat in six freezers in a shed by the al-
ligator cage.
Every afternoon after playtime, 
Bovard defrosts whole chickens and huge briskets in the metal tub 
filled with water from the hose. The cats’ favorite used to be horse, 
but now their favorite is chicken.
They like crunching the bones, 
Bovard said. It’s good for them. They need the calcium.
The Single Vision cats are al-
ways playful. They aren’t mean, but they are still wild animals, and 
Bovard has had a couple of close calls. There is a small, thick scar 
on the tip of his nose where Sita 
scratched him before she was de-clawed.  
Despite the risk, Bovard likes 
what he does. He hasn’t gone on vacation in six years. Though this 
isn’t what he originally planned to 
do with his life, his job is satisfy-ing.
“I don’t work with big cats be-
cause it’s safe,” Bovard said. “I like the challenge and I like the 
fact that I’m working in something 
most people wouldn’t even think about.”12, ALLIGATOR §  WEDNESDAY, MARCH 14, 2012

And Brenda Moore, the South Central Kansas Kennel Club official who first proposed the idea, 
says she plans to drum up public 
support for it this summer.
The animal rights group People 
for the Ethical Treatment of Ani-mals opposed the measure.
 The group believes it would 
cause Kansas puppy mills to “churn out litter after litter of the breed” and lead to fewer adop-
tions from animal shelters.Kansas House committee squashes

Global warming-fueled sea 
level rise throughout the next 
century could flood 3.7 mil-lion people in 544 U.S. cities temporarily, according to a 
new method of looking at risk 
of rising seas published in two scientific papers.
The cities with the most 
people living within 3 feet (1 meter) of high tide — the pro-jected sea level rise by the year 2100 made by many scientists and computer models — are 
in Florida, Louisiana and New 
York. New York City, not of-ten thought of as a city prone to flooding, has 141,000 people at risk, second only to New Orleans’ 284,000. The two big Southeast Florida counties, Miami-Dade and Broward, have 312,000 people at risk 
combined.
“Southeast Florida is defi-
nitely the highest density of 
population that’s really on low coastal land that’s really most at risk,” said lead author Ben Strauss, a scientist at Climate Central. Climate Central is a New Jersey-based group of sci-
entists and journalists that does 
research about climate change.
The studies look at people 
who live in homes within three feet of high tide, whereas old studies looked at elevation above sea level, according to work published Thursday in the peer-reviewed journal, “En-
vironmental Research” and an 
accompanying report by Cli-mate Central. That’s an impor -
tant distinction because using high tide is more accurate for flooding impacts, said study 
co-author Jonathan Overpeck, 
a scientist at the University of Arizona’s Institute of the Envi-ronment. When the new way of looking at risk is factored in, the outlook looks worse, Over -
peck said.
“It’s shocking to see how 
large the impacts could be, par -
ticularly in southern Florida and Louisiana, but much of the coastal U.S. will share in the se-rious pain,” Overpeck said.
Sea level has already risen 
about 8 inches since 1880 be-cause of warmer waters ex-panding, Strauss said.

U.S. Geological Survey and the 
National Oceanic Atmospheric 
Administration who weren’t part of the studies said the results make sense and were done by experts in the field.
“All low elevation places 
in the many urban areas along the coast will become more vulnerable, like Boston, New 
York City, Norfolk, Va., New 
Orleans, Charleston, S.C., Mi-ami, Washington, D.C., Alex-andria, Va.,” said S. Jeffress Williams, scientist emeritus for the USGS, who wasn’t part of the studies. More of US could be 
at risk to sea level rise
“Southeast Florida 
is definitely the high-
est density of popula-
tion that’s really on low 
coastal land that’s really 
most at risk.”

Coach Rhonda Faehn said UF is still looking for its rhythm on floor.
LANDON WATNICK

With the Southeastern Confer -
ence Tournament only 10 days 
away, No. 1 Florida is still search-ing for consistency on floor exer -
cise. 
In its past three meets, UF has 
not maintained solid production from its full floor lineup. While some Gator gymnasts have shined on the mat, many have had their routines marred by minor errors and point deductions.  
The Gators’ average of 49.144 
on floor is the lowest of all events 
this season. Though Florida ranks 
seventh in the country on floor, it fares comparably better on bars (49.303), vault (49.278) and beam (49.272).
At home, the Gators average a 
49.24 on floor. But at away meets, that number is much lower at 49.07. The team attributes its low-er scores on the road to unfamiliar equipment and scenery, and an ab-sence of energy from the crowd.  
“We really have to work hard 
on generating our own energy on the road,” coach Rhonda Faehn 
said. “Whenever you have the little bit of adrenaline, it’s usually helpful.”
While Faehn said Florida has 
the talent to make floor its exper -
tise, the team hasn’t found its top 
lineup yet. Part of the reason the Gators haven’t built up the right rhythm is because of health con-cerns.   
“We’ve done that on purpose 
because floor is the hardest event to be able to maintain with your body and your injuries, so we’re really careful with our athletes this year changing up the lineups,” 
Faehn s a i d . “Be-c a u s e 
of that, 
and not having the rhythm, I think 
there are little misses or landing is-sues here or there.”
After posting a 49.05, its sec-
ond-lowest  floor score of the sea-son, against Auburn on Feb. 17, UF followed up with a solid 49.30 against Georgia a week later. But 
its total against the Bulldogs isn’t 
fully indicative of what actually happened.
In the second through fourth 
spot in the lineup, juniors Randy Stageberg and Marissa King and 
sophomore Alaina Johnson all re-
ceived 0.1 deductions for stepping out of bounds. 
In Florida’s 196.950-196.825 
victory against No. 6 Nebraska on March 4, UF recorded a 49.075, its worst event total of the night, on floor because of subpar scores from Johnson and Dickerson. 
Johnson recorded a 9.65 after 
coming up short on her last tum-bling pass and struggling with landings. After opening out too early on her first pass to avoid running out of bounds, Dickerson (9.75) also took an extra step for -
ward on her routine’s last pass.
“I’m working hard on it now 
and making sure I never do it again,” Dickerson said. 
Despite the team’s recent strug-
gles on floor, Faehn said she be-lieves No. 1 Florida will get back on track after a week of rest Friday against No. 7 Utah, who leads the nation with a 49.244 floor average. 
“When we put everyone to-
gether and they do what they’re supposed to do, [floor] has the potential to be our highest-scoring event,” she said. “There’s definite-ly not a lack of depth.”

As if the No. 2 Gators needed a bigger tar -
get on their back, their historic home winning 
streak has created one.
The defending national champions have 
now won 101 consecutive home matches, and 
that streak has created extra motivation for op-
ponents. Perhaps the greatest challenge to the streak this season will occur today, when No. 5 Duke visits Gainesville.
“They’re a really good team,” Allie Will said. “I know they’ll come prepared, and I’m sure they know of our winning streak, so they’ll be even more excited to play us.”
Duke has been a yearly opponent for the 
Gators since the 2009-10 season, and Florida has done well against the fellow national pow-
erhouse. During that 2010 dual-match season, 
the Gators defeated the Blue Devils 7-0. Last year, UF won both matches, with one coming in the ITA National Indoors Semifinal. 
Riding a five-match winning streak, Florida 
hopes to continue that success against Duke today at Linder Stadium at 3 p.m.Typically, the Gators have played non-
conference teams such as Duke before getting 
into the Southeastern Con-ference schedule. However, this year’s match comes sandwiched between con-
ference matches. 
As of the latest rankings, 
Duke will be the final top-10 
team UF will play during 
the regular season. None of the remaining teams on the 
schedule rank higher than No. 14 Alabama.“It’s going to be a fun match,” junior Lau-
ren Embree said. “It’s always really competi-tive, they always have a great team and they bring everything they have to come play us. “
Coach Roland Thornqvist said that the 
matches are typically set around the Blue Dev-
ils’ schedule, which requires that they play 
indoors in January and February . This year, it happened that the match fell in mid-March.
“It’s good for us,” he said. “If it’s 82 (de-
grees) when we play at 3 o’clock, then that’s certainly a strength for the Gators. I think we’re ready .” Florida puts home winning streak on line against No. 5 Duke

Brittany Schutte taking a ball to 
the face was like a kick in the gut 
for the Gators. Or, it was supposed to be. 
On March 2 against Gardner-
Webb, Schutte was knocked out of the game after being struck in the jaw by an overthrown ball on the basepaths. Just more than a week before she got injured, Schutte earned the honors of Southeastern Conference Player of the Week and National Fastpitch Coaches Asso-ciation Division I National Player of the Week.
Having the UF single-season 
home run record holder out right before conference play should have crippled Florida. However, junior Kelsey Horton stepped in and stepped up. In the first five games after taking over for Schutte at catcher, Horton went 8-for-14 with four homers and 12 RBI.
“I feel happy that I can be start-
ing back there until we get her 
back,” Horton said. “I’m not trying 
to feel like I’m filling in for her or like I’m Brittany Schutte. I’m just being me in a different spot in the 
lineup.”
Although she is not Schutte, 
Horton is certainly hitting like her. 
She leads the team with nine home runs and 29 RBI and she is only be-hind Michelle Moultrie in slugging percentage. Usually hitting clean-up now, Horton has solidified her spot as the team’s power hitter while Schutte is out.
“I always expect myself to have 
good solid hits,” Horton said. “If it goes over the fence or it doesn’t, I’m just looking to make sure I hit the ball hard every time.”
Coach Tim Walton was cer -
tainly not complaining when he could plug in Horton in place of All-American catcher Schutte.
“I’m really happy for her,” Wal-
ton said. “[Horton is] someone who works hard. She led the team in home runs two falls in a row and now leads the team in the spring. We’re happy she’s been able to car -
ry that over into the game.”
But now in the midst of SEC 
play, the competition stiffens. A series against No. 9 Tennessee last weekend proved tough for Horton and the entire Florida roster. In three games against the Vols, Hor -
ton went 0-for-9, dropping her bat-ting average from .407 to .338. 
However, Horton’s numbers 
should improve in a double-head-er against Chattanooga (14-8) on Wednesday at 5 p.m. Rather than 
facing an All-American in UT 
pitcher Ellen Renfroe, Horton will 
face off against either  Michelle Fuzzard (5-5, 2.78 ERA) or Taylor Deason (9-3, 2.23 ERA).
Despite a slight slump against 
the Vols, Horton has never had an issue behind the plate. Sophomore pitcher Hannah Rogers said Hor -
ton has smoothly transitioned into 
the catcher position and adjusted 
well to the Gators’ pitchers.
“I played with Kelsey growing 
up,” Rogers said. “We were on the 
same travel-ball team for two years 
in high school and she caught me 
those years, so we pretty much 
know each other. We know the feel and everything. It wasn’t that much of a difference.”
Neither Walton nor anyone on 
the team has commented on the severity of Schutte’s injury or how long she will be out. Schutte was unavailable for comment as well. 
Until Schutte comes back, Hor -
ton will continue to catch and, most likely, hit in the four-spot in the lineup.16, ALLIGATOR §  WEDNESDAY, MARCH 14, 2012

As a player, Amanda Butler led UF to its first NCAA 
tourney berth in Bowling Green, Ohio, in 1993.

Bowling Green, Ohio, is a city of firsts 
for Gators women’s basketball.
The site of ninth-seeded Florida’s 
first-round matchup against No. 8 seed 
Ohio State on Sunday will mark its first NCAA Tournament appearance since 2009.
The game also marks the first time 
eight Gators on the current active roster will play in The Big Dance, including seniors Deana Allen, Lanita Bartley and Jordan Jones.
Florida’s eight first-timers will always 
have a significant connection to Bowling Green, Ohio, just like coach Amanda Butler.
Butler was a junior guard on the first 
UF team to advance to The Big Dance in 1993. Those Gators went on the road to play Bowling Green State in Bowling Green.
“When things historically overlap 
like that it’s fun to talk about,” Butler said. “It’s a great place where girls and women’s basketball is important.”
The Gators defeated the Eagles 69-67 
in their first appearance in the tourna-ment before losing their second-round game to No. 2 seed Virginia 69-55 in Charlottesville, Va.
UF’s last trip to Bowling Green was 
a road game for the Gators and this sea-son’s journey will not be much different.
The Buckeyes will travel just 123 
miles from Columbus, Ohio, for Sun-
day’s game, a far cry from the 973 miles 
that separate Gainesville from Bowling Green.
However, Butler says that Florida’s 
experience on the road in the Southeast-ern Conference this season will be ben-eficial in an environment where “there won’t be too many friendlies around.”
“Our team will be really confident 
about what we’ve done so far, even if it were a loss because we know we’ve been tested,” Butler said.
The Gators are 6-9 away from home 
this season, including a 1-8 mark against NCAA Tournament teams in games not played at the O’Connell Center.
Sophomore guard Jaterra Bonds says 
that Florida is not satisfied with just get-ting to The Big Dance and added that overcoming woes away from home is 
key to making a run.
“You have to do more,” Bonds said. 
“If you want to make some noise and 
want people to talk about you, you have to win some games in the tournament.”
When Butler and the 1993 UF squad 
made it to The Big Dance, it started a streak of seven consecutive bids.
From 1992-93 to 2003-04, the Gators 
advanced to the NCAA Tournament 10 times. 
However, Florida has slowed in re-
cent years, earning just three berths since the 2004-05 campaign.
Considering UF’s track record as of 
late, Jones  said she is just happy to make it to the postseason. But, she echoed Bonds’ sentiments, emphasizing the need to take advantage of increased na-
tional exposure to help Florida grow as 
a program.
Butler and her teammates introduced 
the Gators to the national landscape in 
1993. Nineteen years later, another in-
experienced group comes to Bowling Green, hoping to make a similar impact.
“You want to go out on that note and 
people remembering you by getting the 
team back to the NCAA Tournament,” 
Jones said. “It’s something for [next sea-son’s team] to build off for sure.”

noise and want people to talk

Gators in the NFL Draft
Will any of the eligible former Gators be selected 
in the first three rounds of April’s NFL Draft? Vote online at alligatorSports.org.David Carr / Alligator
Florida senior Preston Tucker laced a three-run home run over the fence in right field in the third inning to give the Gators a 3-2 lead they would not relinquish in Tuesday’s 9-2 win against Florida State.
�FLORIDA WON 9-2 TUESDAY.
BRYAN HOLT
Alligator Writer
 
With one third-inning swing, 
Preston Tucker made things right 
again for the Gators. 
Florida was down 2-0 to rival 
Florida State and was fresh off the 
top of an inning that saw the Gators 
walk two and surrender two runs on a hit-error combination. 
Tucker then turned a 1-1 Scott 
Sitz pitch into a three-run shot to right field, giving UF a lead it would never hand back.
“We did a great job of damage 
control,” Tucker said. “We only gave 
up two and that’s the only two runs 
we gave up the whole game. Even when we scored, we didn’t give up any rebound runs.”
No. 1 Florida (16-1) went on to 
defeat No. 7 FSU (14-2) 9-2 in a con-test that was dominated by the na-tion’s best team after Tucker’s sixth long ball of the season. 
For the Gators, it all started with 
freshman Bobby Poyner on the mound. In his second career start, the left-hander worked fairly clean through the first two innings before falling into a pit in the third. When Seminoles second baseman Devon Travis hit a ground ball to Josh To-
bias at third, the throw was off the 
mark to first baseman Taylor Gush-ue, ending in an error that gave FSU the lead. Two batters later, Poyner was out of the game in favor of se-nior Greg Larson and the Gators were entering cruise control.
“The bullpen did great,” junior 
reliever Steven Rodriguez said. “Ev-
erybody came out and threw strikes. 
We pounded the ball into the zone and we got outs. That’s what mat-ters.”
Florida had a stretch in which it 
retired 12 straight batters and held a three-run lead before the Seminoles registered their next hit in the sev-enth inning. 
In the meantime, Florida’s of-
fense did what it does best: swing with power and efficiency . 
After not hitting a home run in 
four games against the Seminoles last season, the Gators hit two on Tuesday and now lead the nation with 27 team homers on the season. 
Junior shortstop Nolan Fontana 
added the Gators’ other burst of power, a solo blast on a 3-2 count in Tucker home run sparks

Chris Rainey isn’t concerned about 
his NFL Draft stock; he doesn’t “want to 
hear all of that bullcrap.”
The former Florida do-everything 
back just cares about proving to NFL 
teams that he belongs in the league. He 
did his best to convince them Tuesday morning during UF’s Pro Day in Ben Hill Griffin Stadium.
Rainey didn’t run the 4.1-second 
40-yard dash he boasted about before the NFL Combine, but the 5-foot-9, 180-pound speedster clocked times of 4.3 and 4.33 Tuesday.
“I did great, man, way better than 
the combine, I know that,” Rainey said. “That 40 time, I’ve been thinking about that for the longest, and I had to come out here and redeem myself.”
Not only did Rainey redeem him-self in the 40, but he also showed off his route-running ability and his hands dur -
ing drills. Coaches, scouts and former players in attendance compared Rainey to former teammate and current Minne-sota Vikings receiver Percy Harvin, who was in attendance Tuesday.
“[Rainey’s] multitalented,” Jackson-
ville Jaguars coach 
Mike Mularkey said. “He can do a lot of things with the ball. You just have to get him the ball and let him do his thing. Probably a little bit like Percy — guys from the same school, 
same speed, same qualities that can hurt you in many ways.”

Kevin O’Sullivan knows what Gators fans are interested in.
Following Sunday’s win against 
FGCU, Florida’s fifth-year coach was asked about the in-state rivalry with Florida State.
“The fans probably make a bigger deal 
about it than we do,” O’Sullivan said.
He’s right; Gator Nation does make a big 
deal about playing the Seminoles – just look at Tuesday night’s beyond-capacity, sellout crowd of 6,005, the largest in McKethan Sta-dium history.
That’s why it’s a shame these two pow-
erhouses don’t have an annual weekend 
series. Instead, they are doing the fans an 
injustice by playing three (or in the case of last season, four) times a year in midweek games at rotating ballparks.
With two of the nation’s premier base-
ball programs a mere 150 miles apart, fans should be treated to big-time matchups. It doesn’t get more big time than Florida’s weekend rotation against a menacing FSU offense that av-
erages eight runs per 
game — among the best in the nation.
“They probably 
— I won’t say probably — they do have the best lineup that we’ve seen up to this point,” O’Sullivan said. “They can really hit.”
Yet this season, Florida’s weekend trio 
will not face FSU’s bats. Not even once. 
Brian Johnson, ranked the No. 8 MLB 
Draft prospect by Baseball America, Hudson Randall, the No. 57 prospect, and Karsten Whitson, considered a top pick when he’s eligible for the draft again next year, won’t go toe to toe with the likes of James Ramsey Annual Florida-Florida State 
rivalry should be weekend series

Former UF midfielder Janine Hillier has led 
Stony Brook to a 5-1 start and No. 19 ranking.
� SEAWOLVES MIDFIELDER PLAYED 
FOR FLORIDA LAST SEASON. 
JOSH JURNOVOY
Alligator Writer
 
The Gators were excited to have every 
player returning.
Florida did not have a single senior on 
its 2011 team that advanced to the quarter -
finals of the NCAA Tournament.
“We knew everyone was coming back,” 
junior defender Sam Farrell said. “We 
weren’t graduating anyone, so we figured 
we were just building on the team we had.”
But, they ended up losing one starter in 
the offseason.
When No. 5 Florida (6-2) hosts No. 19 
Stony Brook (5-1) at 3 p.m. today at Don-ald R. Dizney Stadium, the Gators will be playing against the only key contributor 
to not return from their 2011 team: Janine 
Hillier.
“It’s always weird having to go against 
your friend,” junior attacker Kitty Cullen said.
In December, Hillier, a junior midfield-
er from Farmingdale, N.Y., announced she would be transferring to Stony Brook, citing a desire to be closer to home and to her sister, a first-year assistant on the Sea-
wolves staff. 
The move did not come as a surprise 
to her teammates. Cullen said Hillier told 
her and fellow junior midfielder Brittany 
Dashiell of her decision in a private meet-
ing earlier in the month.
“I knew she had been struggling a little 
bit being so far away from home,” Cullen said. “She came to us and she sat us down 
and talked to us about it maturely and 
honestly.”
As a sophomore last season, Hillier was 
the fourth-leading scorer on the Gators 
with 34 goals and six assists.
The loss of Hill-
ier has not been a 
crushing blow to the Gators thanks to the 
contributions of newcomers such as junior 
transfer attacker Gabi Wiegand and fresh-men Nora Barry and Nicole Graziano. But, Hillier’s former teammates recognize how 
talented of a player they lost.
“She’s extremely fast and really strong 
and has a great shot and can finish,” Far -
rell said.
Hillier has played well for the Seawolves 
this season as her 16 goals and eight assists 
are good for third on the team in points. Farrell said she is extremely familiar 
with Hillier’s game after defending her in 
practice for two years and said she will not 
defend her harder than most other players, just differently.
“I definitely know what her strengths 
and weaknesses are, so that will help,” Farrell said. “She’s not afraid to take it strong 1 v. 1, so that is her biggest strength and whenever she gets the ball she’ll go to goal.”
Coach Amanda O’Leary said that while 
Hillier is a great player, the Gators cannot lose sight of the fact they will be lining up against a dangerous, up-and-coming 
team.
With Hillier’s newly-acquired talents, 
the Seawolves have jumped out this season 
to a 5-1 start and a top-25 national rank-ing after posting a 4-11 record overall last 
year.  
Stony Brook followed up a 15-14 upset 
of then-No. 20 Johns Hopkins on March 3 
— an American Lacrosse Conference team 
like Florida — by nearly pulling another 
shocking win two days later in a narrow, 9-8 loss to No. 3 Duke.
“This is a team that is very well 
coached,” O’Leary said. “They are fast. 
They are aggressive, so we’re expecting to 
have a real battle out there.”UF primed for match with Hillier, Stony Brook
UF Lacrosseand Jayce Boyd, the former considered 
the nation’s top senior and the latter leading the ‘Noles in hits this season.
Instead, fans get to watch slow-
paced, 10-pitcher, bullpen chess match-
es like Tuesday’s 9-2 Florida win, which 
lasted just less than three hours.
No knock on the Gators’ bullpen, 
which has been superb this year and 
showed it again with 6.1 scoreless in-nings against the ‘Noles, but fans de-serve a chance to see these teams go blow for blow in a three-game weekend series, when the big guns face the big bats — something these two squads haven’t done since 2003.
The thought of Florida’s weekend 
rotation against Florida State’s bats is a mouth-watering matchup. But the Sem-inoles’ weekend starters, which bolster a pitching staff that boasts a 3.26 ERA, against a Gators offense that began the week ranked fourth in the nation in slugging percentage is just as appetiz-ing.
But fans won’t get treated to either 
of those main courses this season unless the teams’ paths cross in the postseason, which likely won’t happen until the Col-lege World Series in Omaha, Neb. 
Fans wind up having to settle for 
midweek appetizers like Tuesday night’s.
That’s unfortunate, because as fun as 
watching these two teams during mid-week games has been (even with the mind-numbingly slow pace that comes with these bullpen-dictated matchups), seeing two of the nation’s top programs go at each other at full strength for an entire weekend would be downright awesome for the fans and the teams.
And everyone knows it, including 
shortstop Nolan Fontana, who said he wished the teams could play a weekend series.
“The schedule is the schedule,” Fon-
tana said. “Nothing we can do about it.”

org.184-pound Harvin is the “perfect comparison” despite the dif-ference in size, Rainey said he wants to be like the New Eng-land Patriots’ Wes Welker.
There are similarities to Welker in both size and versatility, 
but Rainey stands to fare better on draft day than Welker did in 2004, when the former Texas Tech receiver went undrafted.
Rainey’s agent, Joel Segal, said he believes Rainey improved 
where he stands on a lot of teams’ draft boards. Maurkice Pouncey, an All-Pro center for the Pittsburgh Steelers and long-time friend, said he’s hearing Rainey could go anywhere from the second round to the fourth round of April’s draft. 
Rainey already has workouts scheduled with the Philadel-
phia Eagles on April 2 and the Cincinnati Bengals after that.
While Rainey has focused on proving himself on the field, 
he said the toughest question he has been asked by NFL teams is regarding his infamous 2010 arrest off the field.
Segal and both Pouncey twins said they don’t believe that 
incident will hurt Rainey’s draft stock, though.
“[Teams] just want to hear it from the horse’s mouth, that’s 
all,” Rainey said. “Once I tell them that was the first time I was in love, they just cut [the line of questioning] off right there.”
Brantley improving footwork: Quarterback John Brantley 
was one of 17 other Gators who also participated Tuesday. He ran a 4.8 40 and threw passes to Rainey and Deonte Thompson, who ran a 4.27.
The biggest thing Brantley has worked on since January is 
his footwork, which in turn has quickened his delivery.
“You don’t have to run a 4.5 40, but your feet have to be re-
ally , really mobile,” said former NFL quarterback Charlie Frye, who has been working with Brantley. “It’s like a boxer in that pocket, being able to avoid people and move out of the way 
and still be able to deliver the ball. Those are the things we’ve 
been working on.”
Frye said scouts have been impressed with Brantley’s im-
proved footwork and some have him pegged him as a late-round draft choice. WEDNESDAY, MARCH 14, 2012 § ALLIGATOR, 23

Not long after new offensive coordina-
tor Brent Pease had been hired, Jeff Driskel 
and Jacoby Brissett were in his office, try-ing to get a copy of their new playbook. 
Pease didn’t have one ready, but the 
message was clear: Both of Florida’s soph-
omore quarterbacks are willing to work for a chance at the starting job. 
The unofficial depth chart released 
Tuesday lists “Jacoby Brissett or Jeff 
Driskel” as the No. 1 quarterback, an un-necessary reminder that the job is up for 
grabs as the spring practice season opens 
today. 
“We have a quarterback battle going 
into spring,” coach Will Muschamp said. 
“Jeff and Jacoby will split reps, and we’ll 
name a starter when we’re ready. Whether that’s spring, summer, fall camp, I don’t know.” 
Pease and Muschamp are both hope-
ful that one player will assert himself as Florida’s starter, but neither ruled out a two-quarterback system. “We want to name a starter, but we’re 
going to do what we need to win games,” Muschamp said. “If we’ve got to play both guys, we’ll play both guys, and we 
will make that determination as we work 
through this.”
“I’ve been in a situation where you’ve had to use both,” Pease said. “It’ll work well if you’ve got the right type of kids that both can compete and you kind of use their strengths to how you’re going to 
manage the game. Not particularly in fa-
vor of that. I’d rather see one kid step for -
ward and take charge.”Driskel entered 2011 second on the 
depth chart after enrolling in January, a semester before Brissett. 
He played sparingly in blowouts 
against FAU, UAB and Kentucky before struggling in the second half against Ala-bama after Brantley went down with an ankle injury just before halftime. 
But when Brantley missed Florida’s 
next game against LSU, Brissett was called on to start. Brissett and Driskel split time against Auburn the following week, and then Brissett served as Brantley’s prima-
ry backup and was the only other quar -
terback to see action against Vanderbilt, 
South Carolina and Florida State. 
Driskel finished the season 16 for 34 for 
148 yards with two interceptions, while Brissett completed 18 of 39 passes for 206 yards, two touchdowns and four intercep-tions. 
Muschamp said that sophomore Tyler 
Murphy will remain at quarterback and also be a part of the competition, although he is significantly behind Brissett and Driskel.

as the starter at left guard, Muschamp said.

the sixth. 
“I don’t really try to hit home runs,” he 
said. “Sometimes the right fielder just turns 
his back and I get a little excited.”
Tucker’s night took a less familiar turn 
later in the game when  he registered his first triple of the season. The Gators tagged on three more runs in 
the eighth on RBI singles by Daniel Pigott and Mike Zunino, but it was once again the bullpen that kept things in check. 
Rodriguez, Larson, Daniel Gibson and 
Austin Maddox combined to go 6.1 innings, allowing just two hits in the process and striking out four. Both hits were given up by 
Gibson, while Rodriguez did the heavy lift-ing with a three-inning appearance. 
“I like doing everything, whatever Sully 
asks of me I always want to get it done,” Ro-
driguez said. “For me it’s just coming out, pitching and having fun.”
