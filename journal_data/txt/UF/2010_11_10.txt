Legacy
for a Last Chance
 With 20 minutes to go and nothing 
on the line, Billy Donovan urgent-
ly needed someone to step up and 
prove himself as a leader. 
  Florida was ahead 44-19 to start the sec-
ond half of an exhibition against NAIA op-
ponent Georgetown (Ky.) College, but times were desperate in Donovan’s mind. 
  After a 2009-10 season in which the 
Gators frequently came out flat to start a half, Donovan was looking for a player to keep them at maximum intensity and put 
the opposition away. 
  Which of his seniors would take the reins 
and lead UF to a strong finish?
  Would it be Chandler Parsons, the do-
everything forward who Donovan says 
has grown as much as anyone he’s ever 
coached?
  Or maybe Vernon Macklin, the 6-foot-10, 
240-pound giant who is becoming the domi-
nant interior force he was expected to be out 
of high school?
  Even Alex Tyus could rise up and be the 
guy, despite apparently wavering in his 
commitment to Florida by testing transfer 
waters after his sophomore year and feeling out the early stages of the NBA Draft pro-cess this past offseason.  
  The answer? None of the above.   The Tigers started the half on a 7-2 run 
over the first 1:02, and Donovan showed 
that desperate times called for desperate 
measures: He pulled the entire starting five. 
  “Great teams and really good teams play 
for 40 minutes, and we didn’t do that,” 
Donovan said. “I think there’s a leadership component that our older guys need to step in to.”
  With just two days remaining until the 
season-opener and only six separating No. 
9 UF from a pivotal early-season showdown 
against No. 4 Ohio State, the Gators have to 
find a leader if the class that came in follow-
ing the historic ‘04s is to have any hope of 
leaving a legacy of its own. 
  The Natural Fit
  The ascension to a leadership position 
would be a natural next step for Parsons, 
who is a far different player and person than 
he was during his freshman campaign. 
  When the forward first arrived at UF, he 
was content sticking to the outside and tak-ing open jump shots. 
  Parsons averaged 8.1 points, four re-
bounds and 1.4 assists while playing 20 min-
utes per game as a rookie, and his early pro-
duction gave him a false sense of security.   “After his freshman year he thought it 
was going to be pretty easy,” Donovan said. “Then all of a sudden he got really, really humbled.”
  Parsons made only modest increases in 
production despite earning a starter’s min-utes as a sophomore, and his up-and-down year came to an end when the team lost in 
the National Invitational Tournament quar-
terfinals. 
  But that disappointing finish marked a 
turning point in his career. 
  “He came to a crossroads of saying, ‘I 
really have to take a deep look inside my-
self and find out how I have to get better,’” 
Donovan said. 
  For Parsons, that meant realizing his true 
potential and becoming a more well-round-
ed player. 
  Parsons rededicated himself in the weight 
room, worked on his ability to rebound and 
create off the dribble, and retooled his mind-
set. 
  “He was never in the right place men-
tally,” Donovan said. “He dealt with it after 
his sophomore year and really started to be-
come better.”
  Parsons’ improvement was evident last 
season, as he saw increases in almost every 
statistical category and became the face of the program after hitting buzzer-beaters against North Carolina State and South Carolina. 
  But, more than anything, Parsons’ prog-
ress was due to him learning how to win, 
a notion that could be a major factor for a 
team that had 10 games decided by four 
points or fewer last season.  
  “I think it’s a little bit of everything,” 
Parsons said. “I think it’s understanding de-
fense. …When the ball isn’t going in the hole we still want to pull it out in tough, physical ways.”
  Parsons will look 
to spread that mental-ity to the freshmen as early as possible so they won’t have to re-peat his mistakes.
  Since the senior has seen minutes at four 
different positions, he has the experience 
necessary to provide advice to a variety 
of players, including freshman swingman Casey Prather.
  “I think it’s really about communication,” 
Parsons said. “Casey’s been playing the two, the three, a couple more positions, so I’ve been in his ear a little bit helping him.”
Prather is just one member of a heralded 
recruiting class that consists of five fresh-
men, including McDonald’s All-American center Patric Young. 
Each of those players figures to need 
guidance, and with five starters returning 
from an NCAA Tournament team, that pres-ence is expected to be there. 
This will be a major change from   Parsons’ 
first year with the Gators, when there was 
not a single forward on the roster 
with more than a year of experi-
ence. 
  That lack of maturity forced Parsons to 
learn largely on his own, a challenge he hopes to save this year’s freshmen from. 
  “I’ve known these plays for four years 
now,” Parsons said. “So when they’re strug-gling with the offense or defensive set-ups, I’m there to help them. Even off the court, 
whether it’s with tutoring or getting to class 
on time, I want them to understand their re-
sponsibilities.”
    The Vet
  At 24 years old, Macklin looks to finally 
come into his own. 
  After enduring a pair of rocky sea-
sons at Georgetown University, the former 
McDonald’s All-American transferred to UF 
— a decision that forced him to sit out the 
2008-09 season. 
  Upon returning to the floor as a 
junior, Macklin averaged 10.6 
points, 5.5 rebounds and 0.9 
blocks per game as Florida’s starting 
center. 
  Now in his final sea-
son, the senior who is 
affectionately called “Vet” will be expected 
to improve both his numbers and his leader-ship. 
  Macklin has been a veteran presence 
in the offseason and during practice, but 
Donovan still needs Macklin to prove he can 
take charge when it matters most. 
  “I think Vernon has got to prove that he 
can lead under duress,” Donovan said. “I’ve 
tried to create some adversity in practices for him and for our team to see how they would respond, and I don’t think Vernon 
has responded how I’d like him to.”
  Donovan describes Macklin as a player 
with a strong voice and a desire to win who 
is still learning how to lead because of the 
turbulent start to his career. 
  Despite the learning curve, the center 
has shown his capacity to provide wisdom 
and guidance through his early dealings with Rutgers transfer Mike Rosario, who is facing the same challenges Macklin battled 
through when he sat out.
  “Vernon Macklin gave me some point-
ers on what I can do while I’m not playing,” Rosario said. “He’s been there for me since 
day one.”
  In addition to leadership, Donovan ex-
pressed the desire to see Macklin progress 
as both a scorer and a rebounder — develop-
ments expected after a busy offseason that 
included a trip to the LeBron James Skills Academy. 
  “He’s worked hard, but he himself has to 
be able to handle adversity and be a calm-
ing force,” Donovan said. “And there’s no 
doubt in my mind that he can do that.”
  The role would seem to fit Macklin like 
a glove, as the publicly soft-spoken senior has been tagged by many of his teammates as the funniest player on the team due to his off-court antics. 
  Still, Donovan and the Gators understand 
all of Macklin’s actions in practice and out-
side the gym mean nothing if he can’t bring 
it on game days. 
  “I’m a vocal person, I just have to not 
let little things get to me,” Macklin said. “If 
something isn’t going my way I still have to be a vocal person and still be a leader.” 
  The silver lining from the Georgetown 
game is that the Gators won by 26 points, and one could make the argument that they 
never truly faced the adversity Donovan 
wants them to overcome. 
  Perhaps if the lead were two instead of 
25, the seniors would’ve come out with the 
fire, intensity and leadership that could 
be the difference between a deep NCAA Tournament run and another first-round exit. 
  Only time will tell whether the second 
half against Georgetown was an aberration 
or a premonition for Macklin, Parsons and 
the rest of the Gators.

major, is showing her work be-ginning today in The Gallery in the Reitz Union until Nov . 28. 
But she isn’t the type of girl 
to have any ordinary type of drawing project on display . From Longcat to the O RLY Owl, her art features some  prominent memes, or comical pictures, jokes, phrases and vid-
eos from the Internet, hence the 
name of her exhibition — “The LOL Show.” 
“Everyone uses the Internet, 
but not a lot of people know about the Internet,” she said.
Traditionally , memes are 
meant to be humorous but they can often be very crude. For that 
reason, Rodriguez wanted to 
paint them in a different light.
“I’m really trying to put 
memes into a serious academic, artistic context,” she said. “I consider memes to be one of the biggest collaborative art projects in the history of mankind.”
Originally , she wanted to do 
something more traditional for this series. 
“I felt more pressured to 
something more traditional. I looked online and asked my-self, ‘Why can’t I do this?’”
Many of her paintings fea-
ture landscapes made of these memes — called LOLscapes 
— that are meant to illustrate 
how she interprets the Internet world.

UF health researchers are returning to 
Haiti this week to track the recent cholera 
outbreak and to help educate locals about how to treat and prevent the disease.
Almost 600 Haitians have died as 
a result of the outbreak — the first in  nearly 60 years. And the disease has now reached Port-au-Prince, the nation’s capi-tal. 
UF faculty members are traveling to 
the Gressier/Leogane area, located about 12 miles west of Port-au-Prince, to take samples to determine the source of the cholera bacterium. They will also distrib-
ute 1,000 oral rehydration packets, which 
were assembled by College of Pharmacy faculty and students. 
The students helped measure and 
package individual doses of the chemical mix included in the packets.
The packets include documents in 
Haitian Creole to educate people in the region about preventative measures against cholera. 
“When cholera strikes, it strikes very 
quickly, with large numbers of cases pre-senting all at once,” said Glenn Morris, director of the Emerging Pathogens Insti-tute in a press release. 
With millions of Haitians still dis-
placed and living in poor conditions after January’s earthquake, conditions were ripe for the spread of the bacterial infec-tion.
“When people migrated, it com-
pounded the problem,” said Afsar Ali, a UF research associate professor in envi-ronmental and global health.

assistant professor, will spend a week collecting water and stool samples at locations near Port-au-Prince where out-Faculty to

� UF IS PARTNERING WITH THE LIBRARY OF CONGRESS.

As Lt. Marion Gordy flew back from a 
mission in Berlin in April 1944, his plane 
was attacked by German anti-aircraft guns. 
After the plane hit the ground, Gordy, 
who is now 93, and his men were seized by the citizens of a small Berlin town and tak-en to the town square, where the citizens intended to hang their prisoners. Just as the noose was placed around his neck, he was saved by a German officer, who arrived to take the men away for interrogation.
Gordy’s story will be among many 
shared through the collaboration between the UF Samuel Proctor Oral History Pro-gram and the Library of Congress’ Veter -
ans History Project.
“The goal is to promote and preserve 
veterans’ experiences during different parts 
of history so we can learn from them,” said 
Paul Ortiz, director of the program. 
Since 1967, the oral history program has 
archived more than 200 interviews. The ar -
chives also contain recordings from such events as the women’s rights movement and the civil rights movement. 
This summer, the Library of Congress 
approached directors of the program to help archive the stories of veterans since World War II. 
“These stories resonate with people be-
cause it’s easy to forget the kinds of sacrific-es veterans have made,” Ortiz said. “Most of these men and women do not make a big 
deal of their service.”
The recordings will be available in the 
American Folklife Center at the Library 
of Congress in Washington, D.C., and the George A. Smathers Libraries at UF. Pod-casts will also be available on iTunes. 
“At UF, we have many veterans in our 
students, staff and faculty , and it’s easy to forget that,” Ortiz said. “We feel like there 
is a distance now between us and these 
conflicts. It’s easy to forget the sacrifices that have been made.”Veterans to share war experiencesSEE ARTIST, p AgE 9

� IT RECEIVED $4.5 MILLION IN TAX 
CREDITS FOR HEALTH AND JOBS.
By LIDIA DINKOVA
Alligator Contributing Writer
Ten Alachua County biotechnology compa-
nies, nine of them UF-affiliates, received a con-
siderable financial boost this week in an effort to advance health care reform and create more jobs. 
The Qualifying Therapeutic Discovery Proj-
ect Program awarded $4.5 million worth of tax credit grants to the companies as part of the health care law passed in March.
“I definitely think it’s a great opportunity , 
specifically here in Gainesville where there are so many small companies and entrepreneurs, to allow them to turn their ideas into real prod-ucts,” said Amanda Burks, director of opera-
tions at Optima Neuroscience Inc., an Alachua 
company that develops software and devices for the treatment of neurological disorders. 
Optima Neuroscience Inc. was awarded 
$244,479, which will be used to pay for research done in 2009 on seizure detection software.
According to a BioFlorida press release, an 
association that represents Florida bioscience in-dustries, companies that showed the potential to 
produce cost-saving therapies and technologies were awarded the grants. 
Only firms with 250 employees or less were 
allowed to apply . 
“The majority of new jobs created are cre-
ated by small and entrepreneurial companies,” 
said Stephanie Warrington, vice president of corporate affairs and business development at Xhale Inc. “Investing in these companies is ba-sically the government investing in future job 
creation.”
Two new employment opportunities were 
generated at Optima Neuroscience Inc. since the 
firm received the grant. 
Xhale Inc. received $422,771 from the grant, 
which will be used to rapidly bring improved breathalyzers to the market.  
The other companies that benefited from the 
grant are: Applied Genetic Technologies Corp., Banyan Biomarkers Inc., EnCor Biotechnology Inc., eTect LLC, Nanotherapeutics Inc., OxThera Inc., Quick-Med Technologies Inc. and Conver -

UF’s improv comedy and sketch 
group, Theatre Strike Force, is per -
forming a review of pop culture from the past 10 years Thursday at 8 p.m. in the Rion Ballroom. 
The show, Wreckade, is a satirical 
look at the events from this past de-cade that may stand out in people’s minds, said Devin Donohue, vice president of the group.
Donahue said every semester 
the student organization has a large show like this. Preparation started at the beginning of the fall term. 
The troupe allowed students out-
side of the organization to write and audition for the show. The team this year is much larger compared to past years, Donahue said. Group members also sought stu-
dent ideas for the show, he said.
“We spent a lot of time trying to 
get people sitting in the North Lawn to tell us what they remember most from the decade,” he said. “We got a lot of really good ideas from it and used a lot of them in videos used in the show.”
Sports, environmental issues, en-
tertainment and politics quickly rose to the top of the suggestions from the group’s writers. 
Liz Anderson, director of the show, 
said the show will run for about an hour and there will be seating for 200 people. She said her main goal is to give the audience a fun review of the 
last decade.
“I really just want people to come 
and laugh. That’s it,” she said.Student comedians

UF ACADEMICS

The room was packed, and Pam Soltis was especially 
nervous.
When she presented her research findings to a group of 
50 people, she was met with disbelief from her colleagues, 
who repeatedly questioned her results. The year was 1995, 
and it was a time when very little was known about Ambo-
rella trichopoda, a shrub native to the South Pacific island of New Caledonia.
She proposed that it was a common ancestor to all an-
giosperms, or flowering plants. This includes an estimated 300,000 species. With a position closer to the base of the evo-lutionary tree than any other known to exist, it could pro-vide insight into the development of countless plant types.
Fifteen years later, Pam Soltis, a UF professor and cura-
tor of molecular systematics and evolutionary genetics at the Florida Museum of Natural History, is part of a nation-wide team dedicated to sequencing its genome. The $7.3 million project funded by the National Science Foundation, which will last four years, is a collaborative effort of five universities. 
In addition to UF’s three primary researchers, there will 
also be opportunities for two undergraduate students to get involved, Soltis said. Each participating university will en-
list the help of students, who will present their findings at 
an annual symposium.
“This is a puzzle beyond any puzzle that you’ve ever 
seen,” said Doug Soltis, project co-investigator and UF pro-fessor of biology.
The project is like taking the most complex airplane, dis-
assembling it down to the nuts and bolts and putting it back together, he said. It will provide the best hint as to what the 
earliest plants were like. 
Through this project, the shrub’s re-
lation to other plants will become more apparent, Pam Soltis said. It will give 
the world a broader perspective of an-giosperms’s evolutionary track, as well as provide better insight for agricultural purposes.
Once it is known what genes are com-
monly found in different crops, it will be 
easier to see which are worth manipulating, she said. If a gene that predisposes a plant to a disease is found through-out an entire evolutionary branch, she said, it would not be worth the effort needed to control it.
A. trichopoda’s position in the plant world has gone rela-
tively unnoticed because it is rarely encountered by people, Doug Soltis said. Aside from captivity, it is only found growing in the high altitude regions of one island.
“It’s a bit weird,” he said. “No one plays around with it 
too much.”
Finding the best combinations for the plant to grow has 
been tough, he said. It has different growth needs that can 
be difficult to pinpoint because little research has been done 
about its native soil composition.
UF had five of them before three suddenly died, appar -
ently of a root disease, he said. The survivors will be used in the project.
The shrub’s natural growing conditions aren’t its only 
mystery. New Caledonia, the shrub’s natural home, is esti-mated to be older than the plant, he said. It is likely that birds ate the tiny fruit it bears before traveling to the island.
He hopes to have a first draft of A. trichopoda’s genome 
complete by the beginning of next year. From there, the re-searchers will continue their work to make it as accurate as possible.
The budget may allow for more work to be done than 
was initially proposed, he said. As technology becomes more advanced, they are able to do the sequencing cheaper and faster. He said they will be able to do more with the money than they could have years ago.
Charles Darwin once referred to the appearance of flow-
ering plants as an “abominable mystery.” He was baffled by their sudden emergence and rapid diversification. To this, Doug Soltis said that this research is one more step toward solving it. He is skeptical this will ever be complete because one answer only leads to more questions.Professor part

Students running out to buy space 
heaters to survive the winter may want 
to reconsider the purchase. 
Many think using a space heater in 
your room is a cheap solution to getting 
warm and saving money.
But Amy Marty, the corporate com-
munications director at Gainesville Re-
gional Utilities, said space heaters actu-ally use more energy and waste more electricity than some would imagine.
The little electricity-sucking heaters 
are easy to find around Gainesville. Wal-mart, Lowe’s and Home Depot are just a 
few of the stores that supply them.
These locations offer space heaters 
with prices ranging anywhere from 
$29.99 up to $269.
At first glance, the choice seems obvi-ous considering a central heating system can easily cost a person a couple grand for the initial installation and monthly energy bills can skyrocket during the winter. 
But Marty said space heaters are not 
a good choice to save electricity and that GRU, if needed, can help a person by as-sessing their energy usage.
GRU will conduct a free home en-
ergy audit, Marty said. Representatives from the company will come to a cus-tomer’s house and check his or her en-ergy and water usage to determine how to save money. One 1,500-watt space heater running for a month in an aver -
age 12-by-12 room for only six hours a day would cost a person around $40. 
Marianne Silva, 20, is a UF student 
who uses a space heater in her bed-room.
“I turn it on before I go to sleep and 
leave it on all night,” Silva said. “When I wake up in the morning, I even some-times forget to turn it off before I leave for class.”
Marty said that leveling the thermo-
stat at 68 degrees can be a huge help to save money.
“If you raise the temperature by only 
one degree, it will increase your bill by 4 percent,” Marty said.
She said improving energy-efficien-
cy habits when the seasons change can make a huge difference in a user’s elec-tric bill. 
“If just using an extra blanket can 
save me all this money, consider the task done,” Silva said.Space heaters may be money wasters
� YOUNG MONEY LIVE IS TOURING THE COUNTRY.

On Tuesday morning, Young Money Live stopped on the 
Plaza of the Americas as part of its fall tour.
Lil’ Wayne was not there.“We get about 25 calls a week from people who confuse us 
with Young Money Record Label,” said Todd Romer, founder of the financial awareness tour, as he unfolded a bright red tent. 
Before stopping in Gainesville, Romer said he gave presen-
tations at Rutgers University , the University of Delaware and the University of Central Florida as part of the Young Money Live campus tour to provide relevant financial education and awareness to college students and adults across the country. Romer said Young Money Live focuses on informing and ad-
vising students on saving, spending habits and investing.
The informational session was hosted by the UF chapter 
of the Students in Free Enterprise and sponsored by Campus 
USA Credit Union.
Students walking through the plaza had the opportunity to 
ask questions and get advice from Romer and representatives from Campus USA.  
In addition to Romer’s insight, Pam Johnson of Campus 
USA Credit Union fielded questions pertaining to credit history and student banking options. 
Trivia questions about topics such as compound 
interest challenged students to think about mak-
ing smart financial choices.
Engineering major Jared Anderson was one of many stu-
dents that stopped for advice and giveaways between classes.  
“I’m surprised that UF doesn’t make some of this informa-
tion more available to students here,” Anderson said. Students learn to manage ‘young money’

UF RESEARCH
By SARA SOLANO
Alligator Contributing Writer
Wearing her black JanSport backpack 
crammed with organic chemistry textbooks, 
sophomore Carly Dworkin makes her weekly trip to Shands at UF to volunteer in the hospital’s emergency department. 
Dworkin, a biology major, said she al-
ways wanted to work in the medical field, and she knew that she was meant to be an 
obstetrician since high school.
 “There is nothing more rewarding I 
could do with my life than deliver babies,” 
she said. “There’s something telling me that I belong here and that I’m going to work my way up and become a doctor. There is no ‘What if I don’t make it?’ There’s just do.”
A recent study at UF, which was pub-
lished in the September issue of “The Ca-reer Development Quarterly” journal, found that almost half of incoming college freshmen surveyed at a large East Coast university felt that they have a “calling” to a certain career. 
This is contrary to the popular concep-
tion about college students, who are gen-erally thought to have no clue what they want to do, said Ryan Duffy, a UF psychol-ogy professor who led the research.
Duffy, along with William Sedlacek, an 
emeritus education professor at the Univer -
sity of Maryland, looked at 5,523 incoming freshmen ranging in ages, races and back-grounds. About 44 percent said having a 
career calling was “mostly true” or “totally 
true” of themselves, and 30 percent said they were searching for one. 
“They actually have a really good sense 
of what they want to do and feel like there’s this one career path that’s what they should be doing with their lives,” Duffy said. “I think our study kind of debunks that myth that all these students are just wandering 
around aimlessly.”
Duffy said that the notion of a “calling” 
is something that is becoming more of a sec-
ular term, whereas in the past it was used in a more religious context.  Mainstream culture has begun perpetuating this philos-ophy within the last four or five years with slogans such as employment website Mon-ster.com’s “Find your calling” and a recent 
“O, The Oprah Magazine” cover asking 
readers if they are living their calling.  
“I think that the idea of a calling is some-
thing that recently has become a little more nomenclature, and people use the term a little more,” Duffy said. “Probably on a weekly basis, I’ll hear someone in an in-terview or something say, ‘I’ve found my calling.’”
From a scholarly standpoint, there has 
been little to no research on this until re-cently, so there’s almost no basis for com-
parison to years past, he said. However, 
there is very little difference in terms of test scores, GPA or overall happiness between 
students who have and have not found a career path they feel destined for. 
Although students 
may have an idea of what 
they want to do, current 
conditions dictate that be-
ing open to multiple op-tions may be the wisest 
choice, Duffy said. Research in the future will focus on whether it’s positive for 18 year olds to have a set career path.
“While the percentage of people who 
have a calling is pretty stable, about a third 
of the adult population, the percentage of 
people who are actually doing their calling is probably substantially less now because the economy is so bad and the ability to choose jobs is so low,” he said.  While a large percentage of students 
feel certain of what they want to do, many may change goals or take longer to narrow down their options. 
Senior telecommunication production 
major Mike Jenkins spent his first three years at UF as a chemical engineering ma-
jor and switched to the College of Journal-
ism and Communications in the fall of 2009. Despite coming into college with a passion for chemistry, he realized he wouldn’t be happy with a career as an engineer, he said. 
“I took a film analysis class as an elec-
tive while I was still an engineering major that really opened my eyes to the world of 
film and the stuff behind it,” he said. “Ever 
since then, I’ve become enamored with it and knew that’s what I actually wanted to do.” 
Sophomore exploratory major Daniel 
Karpel said that he believes that students should take whatever they want and not be hindered by the implied need to choose a major as soon as possible. He has enjoyed 
being able to take classes he wouldn’t have 
been able to otherwise, such as Chinese. 
“For me, college wasn’t about what do 
I want to do, it’s what do I want to learn,” he said.
Nearly half of incoming freshmen feel career ‘calling’

EDITORPaul RunnestrandStefania FerroMANAGING EDITORSJared MisnerOPINIONS EDITOR‘Mockingbird’ show should go on
I’m not that guy who usually gets incredibly upset 
about political correctness. 
I usually believe there’s a legitimate reason to use 
“he/she” or “firefighter” or “hearing-impaired.” “Free-dom fries” was a bit too much for my taste, but every-one except uber-patriots who couldn’t utter a word of French felt like that.
But a story out of Flagler Palm Coast High just takes 
the cake. The school has decided to cancel the produc-tion of “To Kill a Mockingbird” due to the use of the “N-word.” This, to me, is where political correctness has gone too far.
One of the treasured rights of being an American is 
the ability to have the right to free expression and free speech. 
Banned books are not something I’m a big fan of, and 
the decision by Flagler Palm Coast High is just spitting in the face of Lady Liberty.
This affects me most as a student who used to be 
heavily involved in theater. I would take my friends or teachers on when they challenged something they saw 
on our stage. 
Artistic expression should reign supreme within 
reason. I understand “Rent,” “Cabaret” or “Chicago” 
might not have a place on the stage of a public high 
school (though I’d argue until I’m blue in the face that 
they should), but there’s no reason to ban a work as historically significant as an adaptation of Harper Lee’s magnum opus.
It also affects me because “To Kill a Mockingbird” is 
one of the most significant books I’ve ever read. Atticus Finch inspired me to pursue law, and Lee helped me believe justice persists even if it wasn’t delivered in the courtroom. 
It absolutely pains me that 
this work that inspired me and so 
many others is being silenced for 
the use of one racial slur.
Think about this for a second. 
What literature would the nation 
lose if they were censored for 
the use of a racial slur? “Fences,” 
“Schindler’s List” and “Angels in America” would cease to exist.
 I understand the mindset of the school at a very ba-
sic level. Exposing young minds to intolerance wouldn’t be the smartest idea. But that mindset is completely wrong. 
Intolerance doesn’t need to be silenced —  it needs to 
be displayed, exposed and shown to be wrong. 
“To Kill a Mockingbird” is not inspiring anyone to 
be a racist. If anything, it’s inspiring people to be anti-racist.
Lee’s intention was to be authentic and to portray 
conditions that would have been present in Maycomb, Ala. I sincerely doubt she was trying to rile up parents of high schools students. 
“To Kill a Mockingbird” is a classic example of 
American literature, one that has inspired generations of students and teachers. It does not deserved to be si-lenced for the use of one word. Given, it is a word re-garded with infamy, but it is a word also linked to the intolerance of the past, and the show deserves to go on 
at Flagler Palm Coast High.

If you thought Charlie was 
going to turn into some lame-duck, has-been gov-
ernor, think again.
The recently defeated 
governor of our very own Florida has decided to take it upon himself to let “The Doors” swing wide open and free in his final months in office.
Gov. Charlie Crist has 
publicly declared he’s con-sidering pardoning the 
deceased fellow Floridian 
rocker Jim Morrison for in-decent exposure and profan-ity charges stemming from 41-year-old charges at a Mi-ami concert. 
We’d like to see Gov.-elect 
Rick Scott pull something like this.
Saying the evidence 
against his fellow Florida State University alum was never very conclusive, he’s considering posthumously pardoning The Doors’ lead singer. 
And Gov. Crist, we know 
we’ve given you a hard time in the past with your flip-flopping on abortion, gay 
adoption, oil spills, your 
political affiliation and just about everything else that’s passed through your desk during these past few years, but here’s to actually doing something useful with your last few months in office.
Who cares about SB6 
potentially being pushed back through the soon-to-be veto-proof legislature? Who cares about Florida women who might potentially have to view ultrasounds of their fetuses after the new veto-proof legislature considers that whole bill again?
You did what you could, 
Charlie. We’re glad you’re now deciding to pardon a dead guy.

Waterboarding inhumane  
In one of America’s shining moments, our former Com-mander in Chief George W. Bush told The Times of Lon-don on Tuesday he still supported waterboarding several 
suspected terrorists.
Waterboarding, for those asleep during the entire Bush 
Administration, is a highly controversial interrogation meth-
od that has been called torturous by many. The interrogation 
method involves pouring water over a person’s mouth and nose to manically simulate drowning in a psychologically 
harmful way to induce secrets to come out. 
And really, who cares about treating these suspected ter -
rorists humanely? After that whole Abu Ghraib fiasco where 
American soldiers were documented to humiliate prisoners of war by taking naked prisoners of war on a leash and snap-ping super-cute Facebook defaults in complete defiance of the Geneva Convention, who cares about following the rules anymore?
Not America thankfully! And when the leader of the free world endorses breaking 
the rules of war and supports torture, can we expect anything less from those who might not hold such superior American ethics?
But what really surprises us about the morally devout 
man who governed the state that consistently sees the high-
est rate of capital punishment in this morally just nation, is 
that by supporting waterboarding, Bush must have just for -
gotten that whole “Violence begets violence” motto. 
Good for us, America. At least our enemies now know we 
don’t play by the rules, and we really don’t care.

UF telecommunications department is 
failing its students
Why is UF hiring professional broad-
casters to do anything other than teach 
students about radio? I really don’t get it. 
I had to go to WSKY-FM in order to get a 
real radio experience because UF is failing its students. Those radio stations should be used to train future broadcasters. 
I thank WSKY’s T.J. Hart, Bob Rose and 
Andrew Lee every day for giving me the real-world education UF would not. 
I loved my time at UF, and I learned a 
lot there, but I think UF can do a lot better. 
Getting rid of Lex and Terry was a good 
start, but if it’s going to bring in more pro-fessionals, what’s the point of getting rid of them?
UF needs to use its broadcast properties 
to teach students.
If it’s about money, I get that; it’s the 
nature of the beast. But it needs to remem-
ber this is a learning institution first and 
foremost.

NCAA should set an example
Of course, as a UF alumnus, I hate Au-
burn, and, of course, I hate Cameron New-ton (in a strictly football sense of course). 
Newton has been criticized for a lot of 
things that are potentially disastrous to his career.
Most obvious is this whole issue of the 
alleged illegal signing activity, which was worth about $200,000. 
The issues that have me burning inside, 
and consequentially want me to see New-ton’s career burn as well, are his actions while he was at UF.
Newton was found to have stolen a lap-
top just before he left for junior college. Last time I checked, any theft more than $300 is a felony. 
Now more recently are allegations he 
cheated as a student.
Isn’t it a little strange a felon and a 
cheater is a contender for the Heisman and is on full scholarship?
It’s a slap in the face to every student 
who doesn’t commit felony theft and 
doesn’t cheat in college that such behav-
ior is tolerated simply because he’s good at sports.
The message the NCAA is clearly show-
ing is if you’re an awesome football player,  you’re above the law other students have to abide by.
Had I done any of this, not only would 
UF have  expelled me, but my entire career 
and reputation would have been jeopar -
dized. 
Not only should Newton not be play-
ing football, he should not be allowed in college. Newton should be working at 
McDonald’s for the rest of his life so he, along with all the other student athletes, can learn they aren’t above the rules.
The NCAA has violated everything 
honest, hard-working students and people strive for.
 It shows no regard for the rest of the 
public who are, in some respects, killing 
themselves to become doctors, lawyers 
and businessmen and women. If it has any respect for anybody, the NCAA would suspend Newton and force him out of a scholarship. 
I’m sick and tired of athletes thinking 
they are kings. 
But perhaps the greatest problem is 
how we make them kings. 
There is no better time to make an ex-
ample of what we expect our athletic role models to be than right now.

I congratulate Chad Kimes in his Tues-
day letter for taking 15 or more credits and graduating in record pace, but my previ-
ous letter was  meant to bring light to those 
who will suffer with this proposal. 
While Kimes might be a superstar, 
whether Kimes or I represent a majority of 
engineering students cannot be proved. 
But what is evident is block tuition in-
evitably only aids one type of student: the 
student taking 16 to 18 credits. 
And this is not a fair system of tuition 
because if I don’t have time to take six classes with labs, hold a job and do re-search with time for leisure, why should I pay for classes I am not taking?

Passage of the DREAM Act would 
change the lives of many
Next week is a pivotal point in the lives 
of so many young people.
 It’s astonishing to think the passage of 
a single bill can have such a dramatic in-
fluence for a crucial segment of our popu-lation.   
If passed, this bill will say a great deal 
about our concern for today’s youth and our direction for our future.
I am, of course, referring to the Devel-
opment, Relief and Education for Alien Minors (DREAM) Act.
The DREAM Act would, by no means, 
be a “free pass” for undocumented youth. They will have to meet stringent require-ments and are only eligible if they entered the U.S. before the age of 16, have been continuously present in the country for no 
less than five years prior to the bill’s enact-
ment, must obtain a high school diploma and have no criminal record to be covered under the bill’s proposal.  Only then can these undocumented 
youth  apply for a six-year “conditional” 
legal residency. True legal status could lat-
er be achieved by either graduating from a two-year college or serving at least two years in the U.S. armed forces.
The Senate will vote on whether to pass 
the DREAM Act during its lame-duck ses-sion, which begins Monday. 
So how can you make a difference?  
Contact Sen. LeMieux at 1-866-630-7106 
and simply ask him to support the DREAM 
Act.  Every call counts.

Shakespeare performance group 
resents implication of story
The officers of UF Shakespeare in the Park 
would like to stress their disbeliefs at Tues-day’s article on the “lack” of Shakespeare in Gainesville. 
 We have performed Shakespeare out-
doors free of charge and for the benefit of 
the community since 2006.
To claim that Shakespeare in the Swamp 
is the only group “determined to keep the curtain from falling on William Shake-
speare” is to disregard our yearly commit-
ment to keeping that curtain lifted. 
 Recent performances by the Florida 
Players, the UF Theatre Department, and the Acrosstown Repertory Theatre further show 
that Shakespeare is a staple of the commu -
nity. 
UF Shakespeare in the Park would like to 
welcome Shakespeare in the Swamp to the 
Gainesville theater community, and we are 
excited to share our duty of keeping that tra-
dition alive.

This editorial was originally printed by the editorial board at Harvard University’s newspaper, the Harvard Crim-son.
National Public Radio recently terminated the con-tract of longtime news analyst Juan Williams for his remarks on The O’Reilly Factor.
 According to National Public Radio, the comments made 
by Williams “undermined his credibility as a news ana-lyst.” 
After asserting that he is a proponent of civil rights, 
Williams said, “ But when I get on the plane, I got to tell you, if I see people who are in Muslim garb and I think, you know, they are identifying themselves first and fore-most as Muslims, I get worried. I get nervous.” 
Despite his provocative statements, Williams should 
not have been fired — he was well within his rights to ex-press his personal opinion when he was speaking outside his home news organization. 
It is impractical to claim that news reporting is inde-
pendent of bias, and, in this case, it seems that Williams’ remarks were viewed as a problem particularly because they seemed to stand contrary to National Public Radio’s own editorial views. 
News organizations must realize that every employee 
harbors personal beliefs.
In making these remarks, Williams seemed to be ad-
mitting a personal emotional reaction rather than a con-scious intolerance toward Muslims, although we see how viewers and listeners could easily have interpreted his comments as being bigoted.
 Instead, his statements further highlight the uncon-
trollable emotional response that many individuals feel despite their intellectual stance on 
certain issues. 
As Williams’ comments suggest, 
unfortunately, people’s conscious 
views do not always influence their unconscious atti-
tudes. 
In this light, we do not believe that Williams’ comments 
were necessarily bigoted or intended as such; rather, the remarks were an honest admission about his own rote re-actions.
National Public Radio’s immediate decision to fire Wil-
liams is an inappropriately strong reaction to the situation and to the interpretation that his remarks were directly targeted toward Muslims. 
The media’s hypersensitivity to issues of race and reli-
gion likely influenced National Public Radio’s assessment of the situation and its ultimate conclusion, however poor the decision. 
In this sense, firing Williams was a form of instantly 
satisfying those who would exhibit a similarly sensitive reaction.
This, in fact, could easily have been another factor in 
National Public Radio’s decision — that the organization could have lost listeners who interpreted Williams’ com-ments to be prejudiced. 
Ultimately, National Public Radio’s potential loss of 
patronage may have mattered more to the organization than keeping Williams employed as a testament to its journalistic integrity and discretion. 
As a business, it is within National Public Radio’s in-
terest to retain as many listeners as possible.
But that is not worth sacrificing its contributors’ right 
to free speech.This is not to say, however, that there are no bigoted 
remarks against Muslims being made on air or in the me-dia today. 
But labeling all statements as such is ineffective when 
there are many more unambiguously offensive statements to be countered. 
A statement that warrants such attention as this one 
did, for example, could likely be written off as one of the many that are undeservedly brought to the national spot-light, and remarks that are truly bigoted could thus go unaddressed.
In addition, the media’s association of Williams’ re-
marks with those that Bill O’Reilly made on “The View” only adds to the false belief that Williams’ statements were as intolerant as O’Reilly’s.
 In justifying an opinion poll he cited where 70 per -
cent of respondents opposed the construction of Park51, a Muslim community center located two blocks from Ground Zero, O’Reilly caused the show’s co-hosts to walk off the set by saying, “Muslims killed us on 9/11.” 
O’Reilly’s comments were inexcusable, unlike Wil-
liams.’ Therefore, a comparison between the two is unfair and inaccurate.
In firing Williams, National Public Radio has silenced 
someone who was, in fact, implicitly encouraging others 
to fight their initial fears about Muslims and to refrain 
from jumping to conclusions about people of any faith. 
National Public Radio should have carefully consid-
ered the true intent of Williams’ words before quickly as-
suming that any sensitive comment about Muslims must 
necessarily result in the termination of one of their em-
ployees.

Michael Tuccelli listened to the 
sound of a chirping frog for over 
an hour, fascinated.
Tuccelli, a professor at UF, 
never heard a sound until six years ago. Born deaf, he learned sign language to communicate until getting a cochlear hearing 
implant.
The implant is an electronic de-
vice that gives a deaf person the 
sense of hearing by stimulating the hearing nerve in the brain.
Before getting the implant, 
Tuccelli adapted by learning other methods of communicating with people.
“My mother would point to a 
picture, and then to the word,” Tuccelli said. “She also tried teaching me lip-reading, but that wasn’t very effective.”
With his own children, Tuccelli 
took a different approach. He has three hearing children who could all sign to a certain extent before 
they could actually speak, some-
thing Tuccelli sees as an advan-tage.
Tuccelli said exposing his chil-
dren to sign language improved communication with their parents because associating signs with concepts and words was easier and faster than learning the sound. 
Plus, early exposure to signing en-
hanced their imagination.
Now, Tuccelli teaches three 
levels of American Sign Language at UF. Learning ASL is proven to increase job security and IQ lev-els, Tuccelli said.
“It’s great to know how to com-
municate with another culture,” said Angela Petrizzo, a UF stu-dent enrolled in Tuccelli’s class. 
“Dr. Tuccelli teaches us about a 
whole new culture.”
Tuccelli takes an interactive 
approach to teaching his ASL stu-dents, taking what they already know and relating that to a visual 
language.
“They are amazed at how they 
can express themselves,” Tuccelli 
said.
Ninety-three percent of com-
munication is nonverbal, making it important to be aware of body language, he said. American Sign Language takes this concept and enforces it, making everything from hand gestures to facial ex-
pressions important in conversa-
tions.
“I love being able to commu-
nicate in a whole different way,” said Alison Schultheis, another student in Tuccelli’s class.
With the people who he inter -
acts with, he receives different re-actions to being deaf.First impressions are usually 
apologetic. After that, people will 
either walk away or try to commu-
nicate with him by talking slowly and fish-like, Tuccelli said.
Tuccelli sometimes conducts 
an experiment with his ASL stu-dents to help them understand what it is like being deaf in a hear -
ing world.
In the experiment, he sends 
students to Oaks Mall in pairs, one pair signing to each other, and the other speaking verbally. After visiting different stores, the students see that the signing pair is approached less, showing the lack of interaction with “deaf” people.
For Tuccelli, shifting from this 
separation because he was deaf to being a part of the hearing world came with challenges. 
Tuccelli compared his learn-
ing to hear to someone learning to see for the first time. Just as they would have to understand hues, textures and perception, he had to interpret different pitches, vol-
umes and tones.
All these challenges have not 
held Tuccelli back from doing 
what he loves. He enjoys sharing his culture with his students and participating in different activi-ties, just like anyone else.
Every year, Tuccelli organizes 
a motorcycle trip to Alaska to 
raise money for deaf children and 
their families. 
“My father told me, ‘If you 
can’t do it, do it,’” Tuccelli said.8, ALLIGATOR � WEDNESDAY, NOVEMBER 10, 2010

Friends for Life of America will be hosting its Chomp 
Cancer Carnival today from 10 a.m. to 2 p.m. at the J. Wayne 
Reitz Union North Lawn.
The annual event is free and will include games, activi-
ties, free food and a bounce house to raise awareness of pe-diatric cancers. 
Some members of the organization are pediatric cancer 
survivors and will be at the carnival sharing their experi-ences.
Leslie Slota, treasurer of Friends for Life of America, said 
they are not raising money at this event.
Friends for Life President Dennyfe Agana said her main 
goal for the event is to raise awareness of the issue. 
Agana said pediatric cancers affect a wide range of peo-
ple from infants to those closer in age to college students.
“We hope to spark innovation and get people our age 
to go and volunteer at the pediatric cancer unit,” she said. “A lot of young adults affected with pediatric cancer do not have people to relate with and having a support system like college students help[s] them get through the rough time.”Carnival aims to

Somewhere between the straight-from-Winn-
Dixie hamburger bun collapsing to pieces and side 
items like Ruffles potato chips (which, sadly, taste just like Ruffles potato chips) and one packet of “fan-cy ketchup,” one thing becomes clear: This restaurant 
lacks artistic risk.
Café Risque is a Micanopy-based dining estab-
lishment owned by Asher Sullivan III of the Florid-
ian food-famous Sullivans. The restaurant is charac-terized by romantic, dim lighting accented by neon lights. 
The menu, however, is deficient of the luxurious, 
gasp-inducing cuisine typically found in restaurants with French-sounding names.
Instead, patrons are treated with a bland mix of 
Americana. Hamburgers. Bacon hamburgers. Eggs. Omelets. BLTs. Chicken sandwiches. Chicken wings.
And let’s not start with the equally yawn-inspiring 
drink menu, which is nonexistent. Café Risque does not offer any alcoholic beverages, meaning thirsts for a pre-dinner Trimbach Riesling or an Austrian Pep-per Grüner Veltliner will go unquenched.
Any hope for the stimulating conversation that 
only accompanies fine drink is dead the moment you walk in the door — a perplexing element consider -
ing the restaurant prides itself as a great place for up-wardly mobile men to meet nice young ladies.
Sadly, the lack of palette diversity overshadows 
the most positive aspect of the Café: its service. The restaurant is, without exception, staffed with friendly people. 
Patrons are told to sit wherever they’d like and 
are not pressured into ordering food until they’ve examined the menu. Of course, the café’s menu is so humdrum that customers will likely be disappointed before even meeting the friendly servers.
Once you order, however, the staff will check in 
every five minutes to ensure you have exactly what you need. After eating for about 15 minutes, I became overwhelmed with the attention I received.
One waitress, a youthful girl named Skyler, even 
asked if I would like to dance with her “in private.” 
Being your dedicated food critic, I declined to focus 
on the “fancy ketchup.” 
Skyler’s request was unique from all other estab-
lishments I’ve critiqued and seemed a little too for -
ward. But perhaps that is a result of my New York elitism not blending with the down-home warmth of southern ladies.
Speaking of which, the gender of the café’s person-
nel seemed oddly disproportionate, as every worker 
was female. This could have happened simply by chance. Maybe the schedules of every female worker coincided with that particular Monday afternoon.
Regardless, the efficiency with which this all-
women staff ran the café should be celebrated as a sign of female power and an affront to all chauvinis-tic men. Oh, how Sojourner Truth and Susan B. An-thony would smile!
The only complaint about the staff would be their 
overall flippant attitude toward attire. Several wait-resses dressed unprofessionally, and some overtly flaunted their sexuality in an attempt to garner tips. With that type of attitude, the waitresses cost the café a spot on my annual list of great places to impress a date in northern Florida (out this December).
Despite their friendliness, patrons will under -
standably worry about receiving food from the wait-
resses. If they don’t care about their dress, assuming 
they don’t care about hygiene is not a stretch.
Alas, these worries are quelled the moment you 
walk in the bathroom, where a sign reads: “All Em-ployees Must Wash Hands.”

  Student Sen. Jose Soto talks to the Student Senate on Tuesday night about block tuition. He was one of 
seven students to speak out in opposition for the plan, calling for a resolution to be passed soon.

  The Student Senate unanimous-
ly passed a bill to allocate $170,000 
for maintenance in the Reitz Union Game Room at the meeting Tues-day night.
  The last renovations nine years 
ago drew more students to the game room and increased revenue, according to the bill.   The money will be used to replace the Point-of-Sale system, which tracks activity sales and controls the scoring sys-tem for bowling lanes.
  Now that the money has been 
allocated, Budget and Appropria-tions Chair T.J. Villamil said he and his committee will hear bids from two renovation companies for the lowest costs.
  “Think of the big picture,” he 
said. “The Reitz game room is fall-ing apart, and we need to ﬁ  x it. It’s a great thing for students to use, 
and it has been crumbling.”
  During public debate, block 
tuition dominated the discussion. 
Seven students, some of whom  were senators, spoke out against the idea.   UF’s administration is working on a proposal to bring to the Board of Trustees at its Dec. 9 to 10 meeting.
  Senate President Ben Meyers, of the Unite Party , said SG will not pass a resolution until an ofﬁ  -cial proposal comes out of Provost Joe Glover’s ofﬁ  ce.   He did say the 
Senate’s opinion, across all three 
parties, mirrors the opposition ex-pressed by many students.
    Student Alliance party Sen. Mi-
chael Morales, who represents the Lakeside Residential area, spoke in opposition of block tuition. He said it alienates the employed students and makes it harder for them to 
participate in extracurricular ac-
tivities.
  “There is no such thing as a 
one-size-ﬁ  ts-all degree, so why are they proposing a one-size-ﬁ  ts-all tuition?” he asked.
  Progress Party Sen. Jose Soto 
said the administration was behav-ing as a monopoly based in bad 
economics.
  “They know they have a captive 
audience,” he said. “They have us 
by our wallets.”
  Dave Schneider, a member of 
Students for a Democratic Society and former Progress Party senator, also opposed block tuition, call-ing it the   biggest assault on public 
education that he has seen in three 
years. The group   plans to hold a rally Nov . 17 on Turlington Plaza at 12:30 p.m. to collect signatures on petitions opposing the measure to deliver to the administration.  SG gives $170,000 to renovate campus game room
breaks have occurred. The samples they collect will be shipped to UF’s Emerging Pathogens Institute for testing.
  DNA tests of cholera samples 
by federal health ofﬁ  cials indicate it stemmed from an Asian strain.
  The researchers have traveled 
to Gressier/Leogane several times over the past year to assist in con-structing an infectious ﬁ  eld labora-tory to study intestinal cholera.
  The epidemic has not reached the Gressier/Leogane area, but UF health researchers worry that if the 
disease did arrive, life-saving sup-
plies would not 
get to the rural area.
  Edsel Redden, 
a former agent with the UF Insti-tute of Food and Agricultural Sci-
ences, will also be traveling to teach 
residents to prepare a drinkable sa-line solution, which will allow them to treat the disease on their own.  The researchers are worried 
supplies wouldn’t reach area
HAITI , from page 1She spent two years on the exhibit
of O RLY owls, the sky is made of Dramatic Chip-
munks and the moon is composed of multiple Longcats. 
  She used the repetition in her work, she ex-
plained, to represent how prominent memes are 
on the Internet.
  Rodriguez is also fascinated with the mytholo-
gies that arise around memes. 
  She ﬁ  nds it fascinating that Internet users make 
up their own stories for them, stories that become 
part of the meme itself. She is quick to compare things like Greek mythology to them as well.
  “I’m a big sucker for Greek mythologies,” she 
said. “I’m fascinated by how these stories are a 
meme itself.”
  Though one of her pieces features the story 
behind Longcat and his nemesis, Tacgnol (that’s 
longcat backwards), another features the two in a much different context. 
  In “The Temptation,” they are portrayed as 
Adam and Eve from the Bible - Tacgnol is tempt-ing Longcat with the knowledge of the Internet.   In addition to the more traditional forms of 
art, Rodriguez designed a video game to go along with her exibition. 
  The game features a 3D landscape that allows 
you to walk around and interact with different 
memes.
  “I want it to be a way to explore the world in 
a digital medium,” she said. “I bring the topic full 
circle.”
  Rodriguez has spent the past year working on 
all of the pieces for her exhibition.
  When two workers walked into 
the gallery, they immediately recog-nized the characters in her art and 
started laughing and discussing them. 
  Rodriguez sat in her chair not too far away , 
watching and smiling.
  “I’ve done my job as an artist when I’ve elic-
ited this reaction from people,” she said. 
  She said she has spent many sleepless nights 
working on a number of the pieces in this exhibi-tion.
  “After today, I can sleep again.”

QUOTABLE UF SWIMMING SCOREBOARDAP Photo
Auburn quarterback Cam Newton allegededly faced the possibility of expulsion when 
he decided to transfer from UF.
By MIKE McCALL
Alligator Staff Writer
mmccall@alligator.org
 
Allegations about Auburn quarterback 
Cam Newton’s past off-field conduct are pil-
ing up at an equally impressive rate to his Heisman Trophy-caliber stats.
The latest talk is of Newton’s academic re-
cord while playing at Florida, when a source told FOXSports.com that he cheated in class on three separate occasions.
According to the source, Newton was 
caught cheating as a freshman, and, as a 
sophomore he put his name on another stu-
dent’s paper and purchased one off the Inter -
net when told to write his own.
Rumors surfaced that UF football coach 
Urban Meyer was the source for the story, but he denied that Tuesday in a statement.
“Our entire focus right now is on prepar -
ing for our biggest game of the year against South Carolina,” Meyer said. “For anyone to think that I or anyone on our staff may have leaked information about private student 
records to the media doesn’t know us very 
well. It’s a ridiculous claim and simply not true.”
The two incidents with the plagiarized 
papers allegedly took place after Newton’s November 2008 run-in with police over the purchase of a stolen laptop, and he was due to appear before UF’s Student Conduct 
Committee in Spring 2009 but transferred 
instead.
No one from Florida has neither con-firmed or denied the report, but a UF spokes-
man said Newton would not necessarily have 
faced expulsion in the scenario presented.
Hearings in front of the Student Conduct 
Committee are done to produce a recom-mended course of action for the Dean of Stu-dents, who has the final say.
“There are no automatic consequences at 
the University of Florida,” UF spokeswoman 
Janine Sikes said. “It depends on the totality 
of the issues. Each one is a case-by-case basis, 
and they really mean that. There is no single 
‘If you do this, this is what happens.’”
A wide range of punishments is available, 
from a written reprimand to suspension or expulsion.
UF expels roughly one to two students 
per year and suspends about 10, Sikes said, but both numbers are skewed by students choosing to leave the school rather than face punishment.
Representatives of the Florida football 
team had no comment on the situation.
“We can’t comment on federally-protect-
ed student records,” Gators team spokesman Steve McClain said.Newton allegedly caught 
cheating three times at UF
I don’t want to believe this.
I don’t want to believe that 
the sport of college football is 
stained with feces.
But as a reporter who covers the 
game, I won’t be so naïve.
Auburn quarterback and former 
Gator Cam Newton is in the middle 
of a whirlwind that began last week 
when he was accused of being auc-tioned off to different teams for six 
figures. Late Monday night, reports 
surfaced that he was caught cheat-ing in classes multiple times while 
he was at UF.
And late Tuesday ESPN report-
ed that Newton called a Mississippi State recruiter 
to say money 
was the reason 
he signed with Auburn.
Is any of 
this true? No-body knows 
for sure. But 
I’m going to go against the 
popular American belief: You are innocent until proven guilty.
In college football it’s the other 
way around: Newton is guilty until proven innocent.Allegations not surprising

After finishing up a three-match road trip, 
Florida will come back to Gainesville to 
play its final two regular-season matches 
before ending the year with another three-match road trip.
Depending on whether or not the No. 
1 Gators (22-1, 15-0 Southeastern Confer -
ence) host an NCAA Tournament match, these could be the last home appearances for UF this season.
The Gators will take on Mississippi State 
(11-15, 3-12 SEC) Thursday in the O’Connell Center at 7 p.m. The team is coming off a close 3-2 (25-23, 18-25, 21-25, 25-23, 15-11) victory against Auburn.
“As much as that was scary and stressful and brought so much anxiety, we needed 
that,” senior middle blocker Lauren Bled-
soe said. “The tournament is infamous for crazy things happening, so it’s nice to get a little piece of that before we even get into 
the tournament. As much as it sucked to 
have it get that close and 
have it be that stressful, it 
was really an eye-opening experience.”
Florida’s final regular- 
season home match will be against Alabama (10-15, 2-13) on Sunday at 1 p.m. For Bledsoe, senior libero 
Erin Fleming and senior outside hitter Cal-lie Rivers, this might be their final showing in front of Gators fans.Gators set to face Bulldogs

THE ASSOCIATED PRESS
 
CORAL GABLES — There was a time 
in Miami’s football history when being the 
nation’s most-penalized team would have 
been a source of pride.
No more.These days, it’s only a source of frustra-
tion.
The Hurricanes are No. 1 nationally in 
penalties this season with 83 — already more than their season-long average from the last three years — and Miami coach 
Randy Shannon simply cannot understand 
how that’s the case.
Even lobbying to the Atlantic Coast 
Conference over particularly 
bothersome calls on a weekly 
basis, something all teams in the league do anyway, doesn’t seem to be helping.
“It doesn’t make me feel 
good, and it doesn’t make 
the team feel good, and the fans and ev-erybody else keep saying the team is un-disciplined,” Shannon said. 
“But I can’t go and say, ‘OK, we got this 
report back from the (league) office and this is how many calls they’ve made a mis-take on.’ I cannot do that. That’s not right. Coaches, we decide to keep those reports 
in-house and confidential.”
So Shannon wouldn’t share specifics on 
what Miami sends to the ACC and what 
the ACC sends back to Miami.An educated guess: Sean Spence was 
featured prominently in those reports this week.The Miami linebacker was lined up in 
pass coverage against Maryland tight end Matt Furstenburg in the fourth quarter of last week’s game, facing the right side of the Terrapins’ line. 
Miami’s Ramon Buchanan blew past 
the left side, knocking the ball away from Maryland quarterback Danny O’Brien, and the Hurricanes’ Marcus Robinson 
scooped it up for what became a 55-yard 
touchdown.
None of it counted.Spence was called for grabbing Furst-
enburg’s face mask, although replays 
showed his hands were hitting the Mary-
land player in the chest, not Furstenburg’s helmet. 
It’s the only time a Miami defender has 
been flagged on a face-mask call this sea-son.
How was that possible?“I don’t know, but it’s what the ref 
called,” Spence said. “I didn’t get a chance 
to watch it. It’s behind me.”
If there is a silver lining in all these yel-
low flags for Miami, it’s that the penalties 
probably haven’t cost the Hurricanes a 
game yet this season. 
Dropped passes and blown routes 
doomed the Hurricanes at Ohio State, 
nothing went right in the 45-17 loss to Florida State, and Miami could only blame 
itself after falling behind by 24 points in 
what became a five-point defeat at Virgin-ia on Oct. 30.
Still in the ACC title hunt, Miami (6-3, 
4-2) visits Georgia Tech (5-4, 3-3) on Sat-urday.
“We’ll just keep working on it,” Shan-
non said. “Nothing else you can do, re-ally.”Hurricanes looking for ways to cut down on penalties 
AP Photo
The Hurricanes lead the nation with 83 penalties this season and average about  nine 
per game.
Miami has racked up the most flags in the nation
“I’m excited. I’m sure it will be 
a little sad, but I think it’ll be good 
to see my family,” Bledsoe said. 
“It’ll be hard because it will be an 
emotional thing, but I’ll be trying 
to stay focused on the game at the 
same time, so who knows what’s going to happen?”
For Bledsoe, only an SEC and national championship are left to 
make this year a dream season.
“It’s going exactly as planned. 
It couldn’t have gone any better,” Bledsoe said. “This is the perfect way to go out for a senior year, so far.” 
The Gators are ranked No. 1 
for the fifth consecutive week, matching the school record set when the Orange and Blue were the top-ranked team in 1996. 
Much of the team’s success 
can be attributed to the play of 
the seniors. Bledsoe ranks fifth in 
hitting percentage in the SEC and sixth in blocks. Fleming ranks ninth in digs, and Rivers is fourth in service aces.
“Every year we hope that our 
seniors have their best year their final year — that they can leave on such a high — and no senior 
class really has done that as well 
as this group has,” coach Mary Wise said. 
“Lauren Bledsoe is finally 
playing her first complete year as 
a middle blocker. 
“Erin Fleming is our starting 
libero from a limited defensive 
specialist role getting periodic 
play throughout most of her ca-
reer. 
“Callie Rivers, the heart and 
soul of our team and the team leader, is playing her very best 
volleyball of her career.”
Sunday will be a bittersweet 
moment for the three seniors and 
fans that have watched them in 
the O’Dome the past four years.
“What we look forward to on 
Sunday is recognizing their ef-
forts and contributions over the past four years,” Wise said.16, ALLIGATOR � WEDNESDAY, NOVEMBER 10, 2010

Yankees captain Derek Jeter, 36, is the oldest AL shortstop 
to win the Gold Glove since Luis Aparicio did in 1970.
� THE NL AWARDS WILL BE 
ANNOUNCED TODAY.
THE ASSOCIATED PRESS
 
NEW YORK — Ichiro Suzuki won 
his 10th straight Gold Glove for a full 
season of fielding excellence. Mark Buehrle won again, perhaps clinching 
his spot with an acrobatic play on open-
ing day.
Derek Jeter, well, his selection is 
likely to set off another loud round of dispute over whether the award is rel-evant anymore.
Rawlings announced the American 
League honors Tuesday. Managers and coaches vote for players in their leagues 
and can’t pick players on their own 
teams.
Also chosen were first baseman 
Mark Teixeira and second baseman Robinson Cano of the New York Yan-kees; third baseman Evan Longoria and outfielder Carl Crawford of the Tampa Bay Rays; Minnesota catcher Joe Mauer and Seattle outfielder Franklin Gutier -
rez.
The NL awards will be announced 
Wednesday.
Suzuki tied the AL record for Gold 
Gloves by an outfielder shared by Ken Griffey Jr. and Al Kaline. The Seattle right fielder has won every year he’s been in the big leagues.
The overall record for outfielders is 
held by Willie Mays and Roberto Cle-mente with 12 each. The awards started in 1957, so there’s no telling how many Mays, Clemente or others might have 
won before then. Angels outfielder Torii 
Hunter’s streak of nine in a row ended this season.
Jeter won for the fifth time at short-
stop — at 36, the New York Yankees captain is the oldest AL shortstop to win the Gold Glove since Luis Aparicio was the same age in 1970. Only Ozzie Smith, Omar Vizquel, Aparicio and 
Mark Belanger have won more total 
Gold Gloves at shortstop than Jeter.
“It is a tremendous honor to receive 
the Gold Glove award, especially since this recognition comes from manag-
ers and coaches for whom I have a great deal of respect. It is particularly gratify-
ing to be recognized 
for defense, as it is 
something I take a lot of pride in and am constantly working to improve,” Jeter said in a statement.
Jeter was charged with just six errors 
and had a career-high .989 fielding per -
centage, both best among full-time AL shortstops.
But modern fielding charts and rank-
ings consistently put Jeter in the bottom half of their ratings. Two websites that study glovework — www.fangraphs.com with its Ultimate Zone Rating and www.fieldingbible.com — listed Chica-go’s Alexei Ramirez as the top-fielding AL shortstop with Jeter nowhere close to even middle-of-the-pack status.
Ramirez made 20 errors and had a 
.974 fielding percentage.
“I think a lot of errors he got were 
plays that others wouldn’t have gotten to,” Buehrle said on a conference call. “I think he was deserving.”
“I don’t see Derek play every day,” 
he said. “I think there are a lot of guys who could’ve won it.”
Jeter’s range seemed to noticeably 
decline — he’s never been the best at 
getting to balls up the middle. This sea-
son, it seemed more grounders into the hole got through, too, with third base-man Alex Rodriguez ranging less and less to his left.
For years, some fans have viewed 
the Gold Gloves as mostly a popularity contest, even suggesting that a player’s performance at the plate helped draw 
extra attention to his glove. Jeter’s wins 
have often served as a lightning rod for that debate.
Serious questions about the Gold 
Gloves have stirred for more than a decade, growing ever since Rafael Palmeiro won the award at first base in 1999. He played there only 28 games for Texas that season, spending most of the 
year as a designated hitter.
Buehrle was an easy choice for his 
second Gold Glove — he became the 
first pitcher with multiple no-hitters and Gold Gloves on his resume. He had a 1.000 fielding percentage in 50 chances this year and led major league pitchers with a career-high 11 pickoffs.
AL Gold Glove honors announcedLet’s break this down further. Newton was alleg-
edly shopped around to schools for $180,000 or more by 
a shady agent. Now people say he cheated in classes at 
Florida.
Which of the two is the surprising accusation? This has 
all happened before. Anybody remember Reggie Bush or the FSU cheating scandal? 
That, right there, is the saddest aspect of this entire 
story. The fact that there is nothing in these allegations that should shock anyone.
Another question: Who cares if he cheated?
I usually don’t like to generalize, but I’m pretty sure 
he isn’t the only collegiate athlete to take some short cuts 
in classes. Two-year-old stories of Newton cheating at UF 
do not interest me.
Instead, let’s focus on something else. Arrests and 
troubled athletes go hand in hand with winning. Schools can’t keep players out of trouble and graduate players 
while still taking home college football titles.
The Oregon Ducks spent the last couple of seasons get-
ting arrested — currently No. 1 in the BCS. Yes, a school in Oregon is atop the rankings.
During coach Urban Meyer’s magical run he has had at 
least 30 player arrests. 
USC has been great this decade. Oh wait, it’s on proba-
tion now.
Don’t get me started on Miami’s unprecedented five 
national championships in less than 20 years. Just go back and watch ESPN’s splendid documentary “The U” to see 
how those players acted.
