WOODWARD, Okla. — In a scene 
straight from the movie “A Christmas Sto-
ry,” an 8-year-old Oklahoma boy got his tongue stuck to a metal pole after he licked it on a dare.
Officials say when rescue crews arrived 
Tuesday morning, the boy was standing on his tiptoes, trying to wriggle his frozen tongue free from a stop sign pole across the street from Woodward Middle School.
Paramedics were able to help the boy by pouring water on his tongue. 
Once free, the boy told officials he got 
stuck after his brother dared him to lick the frozen pole.
The boy was taken to a Woodward hos-
pital for treatment.
The scene was similar to one in “A Christ-
mas Story,” a 1983 movie adapted from Jean Shepard’s memoir of a boy in the 1940s.

Fifteen bucks can get you a myriad of goodies. It can get 
you 15 downloads on iTunes, a new Blu-ray or a meal at 
Yamato Japanese Steakhouse. 
Now, 15 bucks can get you Microsoft Office.
Starting Wednesday, UF began selling copies of Micro-
soft Office Professional Plus Suite for the discounted rate of $15. The discounted software is available to all UF stu-
dents, faculty and staff.
Mac versions of Office are also being sold. 
Copies of the software are burned onto 
CDs, which are then sold to students at the UF Bookstore in the Reitz Union, and the Com-
puter Help Desk in the Hub.
 In addition, the CDs carry an upgraded version of the 
Windows 7 operating system. In the first six hours the software was available, 700 cop-
ies were sold, said UF spokesman Steve Orlando. 
“Everybody knows that students are on tight budgets 
and cost-conscious,” Orlando said. “This is a great way to help students save, in this case, several hundred dollars.” 
The discount is made possible by the technology fee that 
students pay as part of their tuition and by an extension of UF’s agreement with Microsoft, Orlando said.
Representatives of the UF Computing Help Desk advise 
students not to attempt to upgrade from Windows XP to 
Windows 7. It is preferred to upgrade from Windows Vista 
operating systems.UF selling copies of Microsoft Office for $15

An illegal resident from Jamai-
ca, riding in a car pulled over for a 
traffic infraction Wednesday after -
noon, was taken into custody after Gainesville police found drugs and weapons in the car.
Delano Frazer, 20, was seated in 
the backseat of the car pulled over on Interstate 75. The driver had a suspended license, while Frazer had 
only a Jamaican form of ID and no 
alien paperwork or visas, despite living in the country since August  2010, according to the report.
During questioning, Frazer de-
nied knowing of any firearms in the car, though a search turned up a pis-tol loaded with hollow-point bullets 
hidden a couple feet in front of him, 
the report stated.
He continued to deny that they were hauling any illegal substanc-es, but police found 438 ounces, roughly 27.3 pounds, of marijuana in vacuum-sealed bags in the trunk, the report stated.
When police found hollow point 
bullets in Frazer’s pocket, he told them they weren’t his but went with the driver’s pistol, contradicting his statements of ignorance concerning the gun’s whereabouts before.
Frazer denies his involvement, 
but is charged with possession of 
marijuana with intent to sell, manu-
facture or deliver, the report stated. 
His bail is set at $25,000.Police find gun, 27 pounds of marijuana in car  OnCampu s700 copies were sold in the first six hours

On Monday, the Alachua County 8th Judicial Circuit 
Court ruled in favor of Frank Bracco, a UF graduate who 
filed a lawsuit against UF for denying him access to Student Senate records.
Bracco, a former student senator who graduated in May 
2009, filed the suit in August 2009 claiming he was denied access to audio and video recordings of Senate meetings, which he requested in November 2008. Court says SG 
violated open records law

Sea World to restart ‘Dine 
with Shamu’
ORLANDO — SeaWorld 
Parks & Entertainment plans to 
restart its “Dine with Shamu” 
killer-whale show, which was 
suspended after a trainer’s death last year.
The company announced 
Thursday that it plans to restart the show Feb. 26 at SeaWorld San Antonio and later this spring at parks in Orlando and San Diego.
The limited admission per -
formance includes a buffet meal for guests while trainers work nearby with one of the park’s 
orcas. 
The show has been suspend-
ed since last February, when 
trainer Dawn Brancheau was dragged into the water and 
killed by a six-ton orca named 
Tilikum.
The death occurred shortly 
after a “Dine with Shamu” 
show, and some guests were 
still in the area.
A company spokesman says 
Tilikum will not be used in the show, at least initially.

A panel of six UF faculty members from 
five different colleges held a panel discus-
sion at the Reitz Union on Thursday that addressed various work being done in Hai-ti. “Rebuilding Haiti: Perspectives from the Field” included Michael Bannister of the Institute of Food and Agricultural Sciences, William Tilson of the College of Design, 
Construction and Planning, Ben Hebbleth-
waite of the College of Liberal Arts and Sci-ences, Timothy Townsend of the College of Engineering, Andrew Kane of the College of Public Health and Health Professions, and Bernard Okech of the Emerging Patho-gens Institute.
“One thing that is very interesting about 
the faculty participating in relief efforts is that some of them do not even know each other because they are in different colleges 
and networks here, but some are working 
one town away from one another in Haiti,”  said Sophia Acord, the associate director of the Center for the Humanities and the Pub-lic Sphere. “It is very special that they are coming together for this common cause.”
Sky Georges, the president of Gators 
United for Haiti, said the Student Body should use these faculty members as a re-
source.
“Getting in touch with these faculty members to see how they can get involved 
in their work is one of the best ways stu-
dents can help and get involved with Haiti 
relief efforts,” Georges said.
Kane, who specializes in aquatic pathol-
ogy and toxicology said he was very im-pressed with the work of all of the profes-sors on the panel.
“We are seeing the evolution of the uni-
versity attempting to provide synergy as you can see by the diversity on this panel,” 
Kane said.  “The combination of all of these 
areas has proven to be effective.Faculty members discuss Haiti relief efforts on panel

About 50 people gathered to celebrate the official city 
dedication of Possum Creek Park on Thursday afternoon. 
The ceremony included a brief speech from Gainesville 
Mayor Craig Lowe, skateboard demonstrations and a raffle sponsored by FreeRide Skate Shop at Possum Creek.
During his speech, Lowe described the upgrades to 
the park, such as a solar powered system for watering the grounds. 
The renovation of the park was funded by a $400,000 
Florida Recreational Development Assistance Program grant according to records for Capital Projects on the City of Gainesville website. The records showed that the project 
was originally projected to be completed in July 2008.
The original deadline was pushed back due 
to problems receiving permits and rezoning, 
according to Steven Phillips, director of the city’s Depart-
ment of Parks, Recreation and Cultural Affairs. The funds 
provided by the state went to the parts of the park complet-ed in April, when the park initially reopened. Phillips said in an e-mail that half of the funds for the 
grant came from the state and the other half from the city. He said an additional $285,000 was funded by the Wild Spaces and Public Places program.
Ludovica Weaver, the marketing technician for the Parks, 
Recreation and Cultural Affairs, said upgrades to the park include nature trails, shade structures and a boardwalk.
Peter Harter, the store manager of FreeRide Skate Shop, 
said the event was more for the city to get people out to the park to see the new features since the skate park opened last 
April. 
City Commissioner Randy Wells said the park brought a 
diverse group of people out to enjoy outdoor activities.City celebrates opening of renovated park with ceremony

KERMT, Belgium  — The coop 
where Blue Prince lived stands 
empty now, the racing pigeon gone for good.
At $205,000 for a pound of feath-
ers and lightning-fast fowl, Blue Prince has a one-way ticket to pam-
pered retirement and lifelong breed-ing in China, which these days has 
become a predictable destination for topflight birds.
Over the past month, two auc-
tions of Belgian racing pigeons have set one record after another, confirming Belgium as the age-old prime breeding hub of the birds — and China as the new center of glob-
al demand.
“They want to have the best pi-
geons, own the best pigeons, breed 
with the best pigeons,” said Stefan Roosen after wealthy Chinese buy-ers helped push the sale of the 218-bird colony of his late father, Pros, to a single-auction world record $1.8 million last weekend. 
In European pigeon racing, birds 
are taken up to 700 miles from their lofts and released. 
Races are decided by which bird 
flies back the fastest.
The recent record-breaking auc-
tions highlight the sport’s past — and its future.
From its humble origins as a 
working-class pastime across Bel-gium and Western Europe over the past century , pigeon racing spread across the globe and developed particular cachet in modern-day China, which escaped the brunt of the global financial crisis and is now passionately spending on pigeons.
“Along with the economical 
growth of China, the Chinese mar -
ket, there is a lot of interest,” said Yi Minna, the Chief Operating Officer at the PiPa pigeon auction house, which organized the Roosen sale. 
And with pigeons, Yi said, there 
is one huge advantage.
“One bottle of wine remains one 
bottle,” she said. “You have a nice pigeon and it will have more chil-dren, grandchildren.”
That is just the kind of breeding at 
which Belgians have long excelled. 
In the 1950s, this nation of 10 million 
had over 250,000 official members in the Royal Pigeon Federation. Just about every family had someone who spent weekends tending a few dozen pigeons. 
Some pigeon breeders made 
their way up and developed coops to match their soaring careers — like 
Pros Roosen, who proved as com-
petitive in real estate as he was in pigeon racing.
“There were clever and smart 
guys that were looking at it with differ -
ent eyes and were trying 
to get better pigeons,” said his son Stefan. “They were combining the best bloodlines with one another to get even better and stronger racers. ... That is why the Belgian pigeons over the years became the best in the world.”
That paid off handsomely for 
the Roosen family, when five birds 
fetched $79,000 or more each in the 
auction. 
So the precious birds fly off to 
Asia, carrying with them genera-tions of genetic know-how.
“Prize money is enormous,” Yi 
said. “We have a $1.31 million race in Shanghai, with the winner getting about half that,” she said.4, ALLIGATOR n FRIDAY, JANUARY 14, 2011

In a salute to the wonders of 
space exploration, the UF Chap-
ter of the American Institute of 
Aeronautics and Astronautics  presented “The Apollo Program: The Space Race to the Moon” Thursday at Weil Hall. 
Peter Chitko,  a mechanical 
engineer who has been working shuttle engineering with NASA for 27 years, explained the devel-
opment of the Apollo Program to 
about 75 people. Starting with President Ken-
nedy’s promise and ending with the Apollo 17 mission,  Chitko described in detail the accom-plishments and struggles of the Apollo Program. 
He said, to this day, the Apollo 
Program still inspires. “I consider myself very for -
tunate and lucky,” Chitko said.  “When I was a kid in the third 
grade, what inspired me to love 
space was the mission of the Apollo 11.” 
David Urbinati, a third-year 
mechanical engineering student at UF, said he first became inter -
ested in the Apollo Program after watching the movie “Apollo 13” when he was younger.
“I enjoyed his presentation a

For most residents of Gainesville, this 
town is temporary. The mere launch pad 
of life, a stop on a train ride that isn’t over 
yet. 
While many students take it for grant-
ed, there’s more history in this place than one can learn in four years.
And Bobby Powell, the local histo-
rian at the Alachua County Library and a Gainesville native, can tell you all about it — and she will if you let her.
“I talk too much,” she said over and 
over. “You have to keep me on track.”
Powell has so much to say because she’s 
seen so much go down. 
She was one of the last to be born in 
Alachua County Hospital 71 years ago. 
She remembers riding in her daddy’s 
truck when WWII ended, banging pot lids together while people cheered in the 
streets. 
She can still see herself riding on the 
backs of boys’ motorcycles past the country 
fields where the Oaks Mall now stands. 
She recalls her parents complaining 
about the bad traffic when the GIs came to UF in the 1950s, actually doubling the population in less than 10 years.
“It’s hard to think of something that’s 
stayed the same,” she said. Her father warned her. He said, “I grew up with no electricity, 
saw the Wright brothers, saw a man go to the moon. And mark my words, you will see more.”
And he was right.“It’s this computer that’s changed ev-
erything,” she said. “Air conditioning was 
nothing compared to this … Things are 
changing faster now, I can’t keep up with it.”
But Powell is not one to give up. She 
may be the oldest employee on staff, but you’d never guess her age if you saw her bobbing between book shelves, hustling through records, scrambling to help as many people as possible.
She’s been at this job for 20 years and 
said she sees no reason to quit anytime soon. It’s the job of her life, her favorite. 
She’s doing what she loves: learning 
things, talking to people, and helping them connect with their surroundings, their an-cestors and ultimately themselves.
“I love Florida history,” Powell said. 
“I’m fascinated with genealogy … Every-
thing we do is because of something that 
happened before. Really, everything we 
do.”
Powell knows the key to understanding 
the present and preparing for the future 
is an intimacy with our pasts, and she’s there at the reference desk nearly every day, holding the door at the gates of time, 
waiting to show us the way and tell us ev-
erything.FRIDAY, JANUARY 14, 2011 n ALLIGATOR, 5

As temperatures start to creep 
farther south this winter, Gaines-
ville’s local farmers are also see-
ing a dip in their profits. 
When asked about Gaines-
ville’s farmers market sales due to record-low temperatures, 
Charlie Lybrand, director of the 
Union Street Farmers Market, said he is more worried about the effects on his farmers rather than 
having less customers show up to 
the market.
“We always have a certain 
smaller number of customers when the weather is really cold 
but the biggest effect actually would be on our farmers them-
selves,” Lybrand said. 
Lybrand has personally felt 
the effects of the cold weather  
because of his honey business, 
Land of Flowers.
“It has definitely been more 
challenging these last couple of years. Last January we had some 
of the worst losses we’ve ever 
had. We’ve kind of recovered from that,” Lybrand said.  
“To prevent it from happening 
again, we’ve changed our tech-niques. We have them sit in full sun almost the whole day now. We fed them a lot heavier in the fall so they have more stores to 
go through these cold times.” 
To avoid losing large margins of profit, farmers are adjusting 
their methods. 
Marvin Graham, owner of 
Graham Farms, transferred a 
large portion of his crop to a 
greenhouse after he lost two full crops at the beginning of the win-ter season. 
This change, however, does 
not come without cost. 
“It takes a lot of 
time to transfer,” 
Graham said. “You have to start all over again with the feeding and transplanting. Then it has to grow to maturity to where you can pick them.” 
NCL Farms co-owner Con-
nie Ferns said that her husband went out and got a different job because their profits were being so tremendously affected. 
“It’s difficult to grow because 
it’s so erratic and it’s difficult to sell also because it’s very erratic.” she said. 
Ferns also said that they began 
covering their crops in response 
to the cold. 
While this may protect the 
crops, it also takes more money 
and more time.
The cold weather might be 
negatively hitting some farmers’ profits, but others have actually seen an increase in sales.
“From January through March 
or April I sell [frozen blueber -
ries] and my sales actually pick up during that time of year,” said William Gibbons, owner of Well-
born Farms.Gibbons attributes his success 
to changing his crop depending 
on the season. 
“I try to work with the sea-
sons instead of against them,“ he said. “I don’t grow any leafy veg-
etables or anything like that this 
time of year. I also sell pumpkins and sweet potatoes…they’re able to stay around until I can sell 
them all.”
Kurtz and Sons Dairy farm has 
not been hit too badly either. 
“Cold doesn’t really bother a 
dairy farm because the animals are large and they can take the 
cold weather,” owner Bubba 
Kurtz said. 
“Our milk is fine this time of 
year. Cows actually have a much 
better appetite with the cold weather.”

There was a time when this was no big deal for almost 
everyone at UF. For the old-timers like myself who re-member those days, the Bright Futures Scholarship used to cover all of our tuition. 
And then some.  That’s right, not only did we not have to pay extra for 
our tuition bills, we got money back to spend on books, 
school supplies, or, more probably, Four Loko. 
Four Loko, for those of you who remember, was legal 
back then.
In those days, getting the tuition bill didn’t involve 
guessing how much Bright Futures wouldn’t cover and then scrambling to come up with that mysterious extra $50 
that you didn’t have to pay the semester before.
Sadly, those glory days are long gone. There’s a good 
reason for the change, and those days were indeed un-
sustainable. That doesn’t have to mean the end of them entirely. But a series of poorly-made decisions have nearly destroyed all hope for a reformed Florida Bright Futures Scholarship Program.
The reason the program was gutted and “differential 
tuition” was implemented — that mystery amount of money that you still have to pay after financial aid dis-burses — was rooted in all the best intentions.  The in-state tuition at UF, at around $3,000 for a year, was hilariously and unacceptably low.  So low that the university couldn’t compete with top public institutions like Virginia (with an annual in-state tuition of  $11,000), Michigan ($12,000) and Georgia Tech ($9,000).
Raising tuition has been a goal at UF for a long time, but Bright Futures was keeping it soundly locked in place. The pro-gram couldn’t pay high tuition for everyone that qualified, so rather 
than raise the qualifications, they locked down tuition. They thought it was foolproof. 
So, when they finally had to raise tuition because the 
school was getting to the point where it couldn’t function, they just capped Bright Futures and raised tuition without it (hence the “differential”). This was a great move by poli-ticians, because they wouldn’t have to hear complaints 
by parents who thought their kid was entitled to a state-
sponsored education just because he managed to swing a 
980 on the SAT.
Never mind that setting such a low bar bastardizes 
the very idea behind the Bright Futures scholarship. The 
program was created to keep the “best and brightest” stu-
dents in the state of Florida by giving them free tuition 
as an incentive to not go to prestigious, expensive out-of-state schools. Someone scoring a 980 does not usually fit this profile.
Of course, this entire problem could be easily corrected 
by raising the standards to include only people who might actually be drawn to out-of-state schools — for instance, those who manage an 85th percentile or above standard-ized test score (about a 1270, or 1890 if you count the writ-ing). This increase in standards would allow schools to raise tuition to competitive levels while still freeing up enough money that those who could not pay for college could get need-based scholarships from the state.
But that would make sense. And because politicians are 
in charge of this, anything sensible should be far beyond our expectations.

edition of...
Darts & Laurels
By now, nearly everyone has soaked up the news about 
the Arizona shooting. We’ve had many opportunities to throw darts at everyone from politicians and a certain 
church which needed convincing to not protest at a nine-
year-old’s funeral to people sending Sarah Palin death threats because of her perceived association with the slay-ings. 
But we took the high road here and dug deep for an 
it-shouldn’t-take-a-tragedy-for-someone-to-do-this LAU-REL to give to Colorado’s Sen. Mark Udall. Instead of us-
ing the assassination attempt on Rep. Gabrielle Giffords as an excuse for political bickering, Sen. Udall wants Re-
publicans and Democrats to show solidarity and break 
tradition by sitting together during the State of the Union address. 
We can only hope the proposal garners sweeping bipar -
tisan support.
While we’re feeling warm and fuzzy inside, we’re hand-
ing out a kidnappers-had-better-think-twice LAUREL to 
Facebook for giving us the option to receive Amber Alerts via our Newsfeeds. 
If our obsessive updating and photo tagging can be put 
to a good use, then we’re ready to help. We’re behind any technology that can turn our need to check  messages into help for missing children.
Some technological advances, however, we have to 
question.
On Thursday, IBM gave the first public demonstration 
of Watson, a computer engineered to answer complex questions — even if they involved puns. 
Was the company trying to create a menacingly smart 
robot along the lines of  HAL 9000 from “2001: A Space Odyssey”?
Nope. They were just trying to win a game of “Jeop-
ardy!”
For stomping Ken Jennings and Brad Rutter, two of 
the best-known champs in the trivia show’s history, and for making us afraid of computerized voices again, we’re throwing a DART at Watson. 
It’s elementary, IBMers. We’re scared of what this could 
mean for the future.
And our idea of the days to come has been turned up-
side down since last week.
We can’t even look at our horoscopes anymore for 
vague phrases masquerading as advice.
Parke Kunkle, a board member of the Minnesota Plan-
etarium Society, outed astrologers this week when he ex-plained that their traditionally accepted zodiac signs are 
all off. 
As we’re scratching our heads to adjust to our new 
designations (really? An Aries?) we’ve got time to throw 
a how-about-updating-your-star-map-once-every-thou-sand-years-so-we-can-enjoy-a-stupid-diversion DART at 
astrologers.
At least it’ll get people to rethink their pick-up lines.That’s all for this week, Gators. Enjoy your three-day 
weekend and remember to celebrate the Dream on Mon-day. Jonathan Lott

Facebook layout changes often make for 
popular status updates. However, the 
small layout changes are incomparable to 
the biggest change the company enacted dur -
ing 2010: Facebook now owns everything a user 
publishes. 
While most users were passively annoyed 
with changes to a well-working model, some were more outspoken with their dissatisfation (“Is this Facebook for ants? How am I supposed to read status updates when the text is a full point smaller?”)
Negative responses to new font sizes, differ -
ing “wall” styles and modifications to the way others view your recent activity pale in compar -
ison to the outrage over the new Facebook lay-out, which proudly displays a user’s five most recently tagged pictures — usually not the most flattering — and contains a small, self-promot-ing blurb on top of status updates.
As users were acclimating to these changes, 
though, they inadvertently let one huge change slip by.
If you’re like me, when there are 18 amend-
ments under the “Statement of Rights and Re-sponsibilities,” you just click “I accept” and go with the odds that you didn’t just give away your first-born child.
Let me summarize 
clause No. 7 of Facebook’s new privacy policy: By us-
ing Facebook, each user agrees that regardless of whether that drunk party picture is removed, that immature status update passive aggres-sively dedicated to an ex-boyfriend is hidden or the account is deleted altogether, Facebook owns everything published — forever.
So that ever-present “Did anyone just feel 
that earthquake?” status belongs eternally to Mark Zuckerberg.  Zuckerberg also owns 
that note posted during finals week when you were avoiding studying for organic chemistry and revealed a little more than you intended. That note is saved, even when you hit the “x” button and have moved onto a more “mature” junior year.
I didn’t see very many statuses that said: 
“Did anyone read the new privacy policies? In clause No. 7 it said this status now belongs to Facebook Inc.”
I guess users were right in resisting change, 
just not in the way we thought.

During the past week, the 
newly elected House and Senate began to take over 
Congress along with the depar -
ture of Democratic House Speaker 
Nancy Pelosi. 
If there is one thing all conser -
vatives can agree on, it is a total 
distaste for Pelosi and excitement to see her leave. Unfortunately , the man filling Pelosi’s seat, John Boeh-ner, has a shady past that should keep any fervent conservative from hoping for change. 
From his votes for bailouts and 
welfare to his close friendships with lobbyists, it is not easy to tell where his leadership will take us.
Boehner is an interesting char -
acter. 
While the diehards would ar -
gue to let a man’s actions speak for themselves, his public image does 
not help. 
He has the appearance of some-
one who spends half the day on a 
tanning bed. Worse yet, his public oratory often reeks of inebriated blabbering, every once in a while shedding tears in between point-less childhood stories.
Approve of the man or not, his 
conservative rhetoric and sob fests for smaller government are only a guise. 
Like many of his Republican 
counterparts, behind the public images are champions of big gov-ernment with watered down ide-als virtually interchangeable with Democrats.
Since the election of President 
Barack Obama, Republican rheto-ric came blasting back into the mainstream. 
Talking points have largely 
focused on excessive spending, taxation and the budget deficit, yet few have questioned government expansion during Republican ad-
ministrations like the Bush era, 
Boehner included.
With four major bills, none of 
which passed under Obama, the federal government grew excep-tionally during the past ten years. 
First of all, very few conserva-
tives stood in opposition to the M e d i c a r e Moderniza-tion Act of 2003, a bill 
that became the largest overhaul of 
healthcare in nearly 40 years. 
Ironically , the same party has 
hypocritically brick-walled every 
step of Obama’s healthcare legisla-tion, touting themselves as small government conservatives.
Boehner is also known for in-
volvement with “No Child Left Behind,” legislation he considered 
“his proudest achievement in his 
decades of public service,” accord-ing to NPR. Also on the list is a Boehner vote for the federally in-vasive, liberty squelching “Patriot Act,” a bill allowing for the quiet surveillance of any and all Ameri-cans.
Finally , Boehner succumbed to 
the fear-mongering and threats of economic Armageddon by voting for “T.A.R.P .,” which awarded bil-lions to corporate banks at the ex-pense of the public tax dollar.
If nothing else, this bill alone 
should represent the republican leader’s true colors. In a time of ex-treme political pressure requiring 
the utmost vigilance, he allowed 
bankrupt institutions to survive, quintessentially eroding competi-tion and the efficiency of free mar -
kets.
Maybe as leader of the Repub-
lican caucus, Boehner will bring “change” or maybe even some “hope” to the political arena this 
round, but I wouldn’t count on it. 
The man maintains close friend-
ships with lobbyists for the biggest 
corporations in America, including megabanks like Goldman Sachs and Citigroup, tobacco giant R.J. Reynolds and also MillerCoors, UPS and many others, according to the New York Times. 
His shady past with lobbyists 
goes back to 1996 when he was caught handing out checks from to-bacco lobbyists on the House floor — an act he admits he is ashamed of.

In spring 2009, senior Wendy Alder -
man got into an accident while driving 
her scooter.
Alderman was not wearing a helmet, 
but she walked away with only minor scratches and bruises.
In another episode, Ashley Groves, a 
UF graduate,  also got into an accident in November 2007 while driving a scooter without a helmet, slipped into a coma and missed a semester of school. She still feels the effects of the accident today.
After these accidents, Alderman and 
Taryn Rivera Buckley, students in the College of Health and Human Perfor -
mance, began a campaign last year to promote helmet safety on scooters, bi-cycles and motorcycles. 
The campaign, “Gators Do It with 
Helmets On,” received a $5,000 grant from the UF Pepsi Refresh Project, which was announced at the men’s basketball game last Saturday. 
“Not many other schools have the 
amount of scooters we do,” Alderman said. “It’s good to have people worry about their safety and wear helmets.”
In the fall, Pepsi donated $20,000 to 
UF to support student projects and or -
ganizations. Groups across campus were urged to apply for a $5,000 grant and explain how the money would be used. Five finalists were chosen and the win-ner was announced during last Satur -
day’s men’s basketball game. 
“I am beyond happy because we had 
to be continuously reminding everyone to vote,” Alderman said. “It’s great for everyone involved.”
Alderman and Buckley are president 
and treasurer, respectively, of Eta Sigma Gamma, the health education honorary society involved with the campaign. 
The organization will partner with 
Student Government and the university to inform students about the dangers of riding or driving motor scooters, bicycles and motorcycles without a helmet.
“We will have incentives for those 
who use helmets,” Alderman said. “We will have coupons for those who don’t so they can purchase helmets at a lower cost.”8, ALLIGATOR n FRIDAY, JANUARY 14, 2011

UF campaign encouraging helmet use gets Pepsi grant
The court ruled that videos of Senate meetings are public records
He submitted a request for 
more videos in June 2009, as well 
as renewed the requests for the other videos, but said he was de-nied.
“Public meetings are implied 
to be open,” said Bracco.
According to the court records, 
the university argued that record-ings of these meetings were pro-tected from distribution under the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA), as they fell under the category of educational records.
The act provides protection 
to materials directly relating to a student. According to the ruling, a 
record that is only peripherally re-
lated to a student, in this case the 
meeting records, is not protected.
In the summer of 2008, Bracco 
was setting up a project to put vid-
eos of the Senate meetings online. 
According to Bracco, he previ-
ously had access to those records 
but for some reason he was sud-denly denied.Bracco said that the court rul-
ing represented a “return to san-ity.”
“I’m just trying to get records 
from the University Student Cen-
ter,” Bracco said.
According to records, the court 
took into con-
sideration the fact that two 
videos of the 
meetings were 
posted on a UF website, as well 
as other publicly posted materials such as meeting agendas, lists of participants and records of how individual senators voted on vari-ous issues. 
The court found that since these 
records were already available, 
the videos were not exempt from 
release under the educational pri-
vacy act.
Bracco said the ruling “should 
make it easier at the University of 
Florida to see how they’re spend-
ing those millions of dollars.” 
UF Student Government has a 
budget of about $14 million.
“The university supports trans-parency in Student Senate meet-
ings and that has never been in dispute,” said UF spokeswoman 
Janine Sikes. “We are reviewing 
the decision along with our obli-
gations under federal law and we 
cannot comment further at this 
time.” 
Student Body President Ashton 
Charles, who was Senate president 
at the time the suit was filed, said 
the Senate always does its best to 
comply with public records laws.
“We pride ourself on transpar -
ency,” she said. SG , from page 1

With his recent pectoral strain, his nagging 
knee injury and the normal wear and tear that comes with week after week of physical exer -
tion, Vernon Macklin has felt more than his share of discomfort throughout the season. 
The senior center hasn’t had a day without 
a visit to the trainer since the preseason, and he has had so many treatments that he has be-come practically numb to most of them. 
“I can put ice on for like an hour, and I 
won’t feel it,” Macklin said. “It don’t even feel cold anymore. … I think I need to try some-thing new.”
But, in the face of it all, Macklin has ap-
peared in every game and started all but one, putting together a strong season that he will look to continue when Florida (13-3, 2-0 Southeastern Conference) squares off against South Carolina (10-5, 1-1 SEC) on Saturday at 1:30 p.m. in the O’Connell Center. 
The senior has been a force in the paint 
from day one, scoring 10.9 points and grab-bing 6.1 rebounds per game. 
The majority of those points have come off 
his nearly unstoppable hook shot, which has allowed him to post a team-leading 57.1 field goal percentage. 
“If I get a good look at the rim and the guy 
don’t leave his feet, I’m confident I can put the right touch on it and it’ll go in,” Macklin said. 
When Macklin can use his quick first step 
to square his shoulders and get into the body of his defender, there is very little that can be done to stop him one-on-one. 
Even if the senior gets matched up against

The Gators have already made a 
deep footprint in the college gymnas-
tics realm this season. 
The squad opened against Nebras-
ka last week with the nation’s highest 
score of opening competition and shot 
up from No. 3 to a No. 1 national rank-ing. 
“Last year, we started on a road 
meet and we lost to Oklahoma, so it’s a very different start to the season,” se-nior Alicia Goodwin said. “But we can never get comfortable with where we 
are. The minute you say you’re good 
enough, you’re going to take five steps backwards.”
The team beat the Cornhuskers 
196.925 to 194.95, the second-highest season opening score for the Gators.
Florida will tackle its second home 
meet tonight against No. 16 Kentucky with a new addition to the roster. Freshman Jade Wiggins, of Lake Mary, started practicing this month after graduating from high school in De-
cember. At 4-foot-10, she is the team’s 
shortest gymnast, and her major com-petition areas include the balance beam and uneven parallel bars. 
“She has a polish. You’ll notice she’s 
more like a ballet dancer,” coach Rhon-da Faehn said. “She needs a little bit more time and training under her belt with us, but I may put her out there on exhibition for beam — start her out 
slow and let her build her confidence.”
Wiggins is one of the team’s five 
freshmen on the roster. Freshman Alai-
na Johnson had an impressive start to her college gymnastics career against UF ranked 
No. 1 after first meet

Nothing seemed to go Florida’s way 
Thursday night as No. 5 Tennessee came 
into Gainesville and throttled the Gators, 
leaving the O’Connell Center with an 83-
40 victory that was never in doubt. 
The Lady Volunteers’ (16-2, 4-0 South-
eastern Conference) size, speed and expe-
rience overwhelmed the Gators from the 
opening tip to the final buzzer. “You have to give Tennessee credit for 
setting the tone right from the beginning,” coach Amanda Butler said. “We never 
adjusted and never re-ally responded with the 
toughness that I know 
this team possesses.”
UT’s Kelley Cain 
opened the scoring with a layup inside, and Ja-
terra Bonds answered with a three on the other end to give the Gators a 3-2 advan-tage moments into the game. 
But that would be the last time Florida 
held the lead. 
Butler harps constantly about setting 
the tone in the first few minutes of the 
game, but after four minutes the Gators 
trailed 14-5 and had missed five of their 
first seven looks from the field.
The Gators (12-6, 2-2 SEC) failed to cap-
italize on some good opportunities, which 
allowed Tennessee to score in transition as the game quickly got out of hand.

Ranked No. 9 in the country , the 
men’s tennis team heads into the spring 
season with one goal in mind: winning an NCAA Championship. 
The team’s first test is this weekend 
as the Gators head to Knoxville, Tenn., to take part in the Southeastern Conference Indoor Championships. 
“It’s a great way to start the season 
against five of the top 20 teams in the country and quite a few other teams that will make the NCAA (Tournament),” coach Andy Jackson said. 
Jackson’s team returns five of the top 
seven players from last season, including the No. 4 player in the country in senior Alexandre Lacroix.
Lacroix went 14-2 in singles action in 
the fall, reaching the semifinals at the ITA National Intercollegiate Indoor Champi-onships and the quarterfinals in the ITA All-American Championships. “Alex is one of the guys that should 
be looked at as a favorite to win the NCAA,” Jackson said. “I think he’s one of the best guys in the country. Frankly, I think he’s going to be the best guy in 
the country .” 
As the lone senior on the team, Lacro-
ix has assumed a strong leadership role 
and is the backbone of 
the team. 
Sophomores Sekou 
Bangoura Jr. and Bob van Overbeek will be 
counted on to play 
in the No. 2 and No. 
3 roles this spring. After strong fall per -
formances, they are 
ranked No. 28 and No. 52, respectively. 
“I would like to see them be two of 
the best 10,” Jackson said. 
One reason for optimism is the emer -
gence of a strong freshman class. 
Andrew Butz and Michael Alford en-
joyed plenty of success in doubles, post-ing a 10-4 record together. Butz showed 
his talent in singles action as well, reach-
ing the quarterfinals at the ITA South-eastern Regional Championships. 
The team also added a high-profile 
freshman this spring in Spencer New-man, rated a blue-chip, five-star prospect by tennisrecruiting.net.
Newman is an elite player who has 
been injured over the past 16 months, 
but Jackson said he has a chance to con-
tribute if healthy. 
Jackson has continued to select a chal-
lenging nonconference schedule, includ-ing matches against No. 7 Baylor and No. 2 Southern California, in addition to the Gators’ tough SEC slate, so his team gets a taste of what it takes to face national championship-level competition. 
“Tennis is about trying to get your 
team tougher and build a body of work for a seed at the end of the year,” Jackson said. “We feel like, playing in the SEC, we start out with an extremely tough schedule.”

DALLAS WHILE THE REST COMPETE AT HOME.

Before the Florida Atlantic meet a year ago, Sebastien Rous-
seau knew he would have his chance.  
Nine of Florida’s best swimmers and divers were off to Dal-
las to compete in a bigger meet, leaving Rousseau and a slew 
of other untested and inexperienced underclassmen to prove themselves in open spots once held by All-Americans.
The meet against the Owls was Rousseau’s first time swim-
ming as a Gator. He had just transferred from South Africa to Gainesville for the spring semester. And, as the new guy , not much was expected from him when he kicked off the pool wall for the men’s 200-yard butterfly.
Less than two minutes later, Rousseau had won his first col-
legiate race and posted a qualifying time for NCAAs. By the end of the season, he was an All-American.
Most of the No. 5 Gators men’s team (3-2, 2-0 SEC) will have 
the same opportunity to try for a breakout performance during 
Saturday’s dual meet against FAU on Saturday at 1 p.m. at the 
O’Connell Center Natatorium. 
With team leaders like Rousseau, four-time SEC Swimmer 
of the Week Conor Dwyer and All-American Brett Fraser on the road for the SMU Classic today and Saturday, a massive scoring void needs to be filled by the Gators against the Owls.
“We haven’t really said anything to them yet, but I feel like 
they know what they have to do, and it’s expected,” Rousseau 
said. “When some of the better guys, if you want to say, go to 
another meet, you’ve got to step up and prove yourself.”
Almost 77 percent of UF’s individual wins this year have 
come from the eight swimmers and one diver heading to Dal-las.
Even with Florida’s loss of scoring power, the unranked 
Owls will still have some ground to make up on the Gators. When the two faced off earlier this season at the Georgia Tech Invitational in November, Florida beat the Owls by 854 points.
Gators coach Gregg Troy said he wanted to challenge the 
depth of the team even further during the meet by trying Flor -
ida’s swimmers out in new events.
“We’re very versatile, so we want to see the athletes in a 
couple of different places and decide what the best events are,” Troy said. “They’re going to swim a different slate than what 
they did last week.”No. 9 Gators start spring at SECs

Coming off the school’s first national indoor 
title, an indoor coach of the year award for Mike 
Holloway and a preseason No. 1 ranking, it might be easy for the Florida men’s track and field team 
to focus on its recent success.
But with a new season set to begin Saturday 
at the one-day Nittany Lion Challenge, hosted by 
Penn State in University Park, Pa., the Gators are forgetting about the past and looking to reclaim the championship form they enjoyed last year.
“There’s been a lot of talk about us defending 
our national title. That happened in 2010. This is 2011. We don’t even talk about that,” Holloway 
said. “Our goal is to be the best team in the coun-
try this year, as it is every year.”
The UF men earned the top 
ranking in the U.S. Track and Field and Cross Country Coaches Asso-ciation preseason poll. The Gators return a great deal of the talent that helped them capture the school’s first national indoor title a year ago. 
They added the No. 2 recruiting class in the coun-try, according to Track and Field News. 
While there is certainly no lack of talent on 
the men’s team, Holloway is anxious to see how his squad’s focus holds up in the first meet of the season — particularly after a long offseason full of training.
“Sixteen weeks of the fall, running against each 
other, it gets a little bit old sometimes,” Holloway 
said. “Our big focus this weekend is to just go out 
and get the season off to a good start — not to ex-
pect national records and school records and stuff 
like that. We just want to see how everybody re-
acts when the lights come on.”
The Florida women’s team, meanwhile, will 
enter its season without the same level of expec-tations. The Gators finished fourth at last year’s NCAA Indoor Championships and brought in the nation’s seventh-ranked recruiting class, but Holloway said the team will have to rebuild after losing the majority of its point-scorers from last 
year’s squad.
“We’ve got some work to do there,” Holloway 
said. “But we are very confident that the young 
ladies we have on this campus are ready to put their best foot forward and continue the tradition of excellence on that side of the coin as well.”Florida begins

Macklin adds drop step to repertoire
a shot-blocker with the ability to 
contest his initial attempt, Macklin can shift to a running hook across the lane. 
The senior can execute the 
move with such consistency and 
precision that it’s hard to believe 
he hadn’t attempted a hook shot until he started his college career. 
“In high school, I never learned 
it,” Macklin said. “I thought it was silly to try, so I never tried.”
While at Georgetown, Macklin 
learned the art of the hook from 
current NBA players Roy Hibbert and Jeff Green. 
He only added to his skills af-
ter transferring to Florida, where he discovered a face-up game and 
started practicing with a medicine 
ball to give the hook more strength and consistency. 
Now in his senior year, Macklin 
has added yet another move to his 
offensive repertoire: the drop step. 
Whenever teams double him 
or play him inside to prevent the 
hook, he can now step to the bas-
ket and finish with a layup. 
“He’s worked on that part of his 
game. He’s gotten better at that,” 
Donovan said. This scoring prowess is an 
unexpected development from Macklin, who left high school  re-
nowned for his effort, shot block-
ing and athleticism. 
Now, the only things poten-
tially standing in his way are his 
nagging injuries, although his 
teammates expect him to continue 
playing through the pain. 
“I definitely do admire that. 
He’s a warrior and he’s prob-
ably one of my favorite people  
I’ve ever played basketball with,” 
center Patric Young said. “I learn 
from him. He’s a good role model to me, and he’s just a warrior.”HOOPS , from page 14
Bjorklund outscores Gators in first half
backs and push tempo,” Tennessee coach Pat 
Summitt said. “I thought we did a good job of 
slowing them down.”
Florida could only muster 15 points in the 
first 20 minutes and trailed by 32 at half. The Gators had more turnovers (eight) than field goals (six) and were shooting just 20 percent (6 
for 30) at the break.  
Tennessee’s Angie Bjorklund, who provid-
ed the game-winning dagger with 2.3 seconds 
left in last season’s meeting in Gainesville, again torched the Gators. Dropping all 16 of 
her points in the first half, Bjorklund actually outscored Florida by herself in the opening 20 
minutes.
“We needed to come out punching first, and 
we didn’t make that first punch,” center Azania 
Stewart said. “[Bjorklund] shot the lights out 
and we didn’t adjust at all.”
Only five players on UF’s roster had expe-
rienced a game against Tennessee, and Butler 
said the team might not have been ready for a 
game of such magnitude. 
“I didn’t think anyone necessarily had that 
look in their eye like it was going to be a spe-cial night,” Butler said. “[Tennessee] did a tre-mendous job of coming on the road and being 
ready for everything we were going to hand 
them. That was the most impressive thing — 
they didn’t do this in Knoxville, they did this 
in Gainesville.”
Florida was pushed around in all aspects, 
notching season lows in points (40), field goals made (15) and rebound margin (negative-20).  
The Gators made just 15 of their 70 looks from 
the field for a field goal percentage of 21.4 — 
the third-lowest output in UF history. 
Afterward, Butler talked to her team about 
playing “Florida basketball,” something she said was absent Thursday.
“The name on the jersey sometimes draws 
more people into the postgame press confer -
ence or pregame hype, but our effort and the 
way that we play shouldn’t be altered at all by who we’re playing,” Butler said. “And that cer -
tainly was the difference tonight. …We weren’t 
the same team tonight.”WHOOPS , from page 14
Nebraska, earning the second-
highest scores for an all-around 
debut at UF. Johnson also earned 
the SEC Freshman Gymnast of 
the Week award as a result of last 
week’s performance. 
Freshmen Brittney Noble and 
Mackenzie Caquatto also got a taste of competition last week. 
“I look at how strong our fresh-
man class was last year, but they didn’t start out that way,” Faehn 
said. “They grew into it. The first 
half of the season, they were still deer in the headlights, you know, making mistakes here and there and forgetting floor routines and things like that. Where this class, they’re experienced.”
Faehn said the lineups will 
change to allow athletes to rest when needed because of the spread of talent the team has this season.
Looking back at the film from 
the meet against Nebraska, Faehn said she was impressed with the amount of stuck landings the 
Gators had, but they need to focus 
on the smaller details heading into the rest of the season.
“Florida gymnastics has always 
had the power and the diffi-
culty and the 
intensity out there, but one area we re-ally felt that we 
needed to improve upon was the polish and the artistry,” she said. “I think we saw a nice glimmer of that 
[last] weekend. We know we can 
do better and we know we have a greater potential.”UF focusing on small details

Gymnasticsn A rebuilding opponent: South Carolina 
has had to replace its two leading scorers, in-
cluding point guard Devan Downey. Last sea-
son, Downey ranked fifth in the nation in scoring 22.5 points per game. Replacing their depart-ed leaders has not been easy, but they have 
brought in six freshmen who have increased the 
group’s overall speed and athleticism. “They’re a team that can press you, trap you, turn you 
over,” Donovan said. “They’ve got some guys 
that can really make plays off the dribble.” 
n Last year’s meetings: When these teams 
last met on Feb. 10, former Gamecocks guards 
Downey and Brandis Raley-Ross combined for 44 points as South Carolina got the 77-71 
win. Their other matchup provided one of the 
most memorable moments of Florida’s year, as then-junior forward Chandler Parsons drilled a buzzer-beater to give UF a 58-56 win in the 
O’Connell Center. The Gators expect another 
close contest this time around, as the resilient Gamecocks recently made up 11 points in the fi-
nal 8:46 to force overtime against Vanderbilt in a game they eventually won. “If you don’t come 
in the second half, they can come back,” Kenny 
Boynton said. “They never go away.”
n Replacing Downey: South Carolina has 
replaced one sub-6-foot scorer with another, as 
5-foot-9 freshman Bruce Ellington leads the team 
with 14.5 points per game. The former high school quarterback is a lightning-quick sharp -
shooter who has hit 41.4 percent from beyond the arc this season. “(Ellington) is as good as any freshman in our league,” Donovan said. 
n Inside presence: The Gamecocks have 
blocked 101 shots so far this season and rank 
fifth nationally in blocks per game. The interior 
defense is led by senior Sam Muldrow, who is 
seventh in the nation with 3.3 blocks per game. The 6-foot-9, 229-pound senior also averages 9.5 points and 7.1 rebounds. “He’s very long, 
and as a team, they’re a great defensive team,” 
Macklin said. “They scramble. They’re one of those teams where, when you think a pass is 
wide open, they come and steal the ball.”What To Watch For
“We needed to come out punching 
first, and we didn’t make that first
