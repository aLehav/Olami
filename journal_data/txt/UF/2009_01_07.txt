0 10,000 FANS ARE EXPECTED TO
WATCH THE GAME IN THE O-DOME.
By HILARY SHEINBAUM
Alligator Contributing Writer
UF fans stuck in Gainesville for the BCS
National Championship Game don't have
to stay at home.
Students, faculty and other Gator foot-ball fans can congregate at the O'Connell
Center, Orange & Brew or the Grand
Ballroom in the Reitz Union to watch the
Gators match up against the Oklahoma
Sooners.
"I went to the O-Dome for the last foot-
ball championship game and I can only
describe it as pure chaos," said UF sociol-
ogy junior Courtney Gallow. "It was un-
believable to be there with thousands of"It was unbelievable to be there

kickoff is expected at 8:17 p.m., according
to a UF press release.
Inside the O'Connell Center, the foot-
ball game will be shown on four large

Students react to Gaza
Groups rally
protest attacks
By CHELSEA KEENAN
Alligator Contributing Writer
In line with international protests
on the issue, the controversial attacks
in the Gaza Strip have sparked reac-
tions from UF students on both sides
of the spectrum.
Jonathan Bull, vice president of ex-
ternal relations for Islam on Campus,
said his main concern is the treatment
of the people of Gaza.
"It's an open-air prison," he said.
LOCAL"They're receiving no aid."
Although Islam on Campus is a re-
ligious organization and not political,
the executive board will meet later this
week to discuss what actions they plan
to take.
"All I want is to see an end to it,"
Bull said, "and for Palestinian people
to live normal lives, andOn Israeli people to not have
fear in their lives."
Sharday El-Assar, a
Middle Eastern studies senior, has
protested the attacks for the past three
days.
About 60 people attended the first
protest on Sunday, which was held on

While the Gators clash with the
Oklahoma Sooners in Miami, much
of the Gator Nation will party on
University Avenue.
And with a captive audience, bars,
clubs and eateries along University
will be making the most of the national
championship game on Thursday.
Many of the bars will raise their drink
prices during the game, and the Florida
Book Store already has championship
shirts in stock.
Gator City Sports Grill is charging$50 per ticket for reserved seating next
to their two big-screen projectors. To
avoid the fee, customers can stake out
their seats hours in advance.
When the Gators won their last na-
tional title in 2007, the seating sold out
two days in advance, said Brad Bierman,
general manager at Gator City Sports
Grill.
The restaurants and bars will also
assume the risk of playing host to hun-
dreds of drunken fans.
After the game in 2007, revved-up
fans climbed light poles, streaked and,

Essay sends woman to inauguration
A local woman is the first of 10 essay contest winners to
receive a ticket to the Jan. 20 inauguration of President-elect
Barack Obama.
Cynthia Russell, of Newberry, received the ticket after
writing an essay on what Obama's win meant to her, accord-
ing to the Presidential Inaugural Committee Web site.
Essay writers were asked to donate to the inaugural com-
mittee but were not required to do so.
Russell will attend other events, includin' a welcome cer-

Commission upholds funding limits for nonprofits
0 COUNTY COMMISSION TO
READDRESS APPLICATION
CRITERIA ON FEB. 3.
By MORGAN COLLINS
Alligator Contributing Writer
The Alachua County
Commission reviewed how non-
profit programs designed to
reduce poverty receive county
funding but agreed to keep fund-
ing limits in place at a special
meeting Tuesday at the County
Administration Building.
Programs sponsored by non-profit agencies with a 501(c)(3)
tax-exempt status receive funding
through the county's Community
Agency Partnership Program.
To receive funding, agencies
can propose up to two programs
for either poverty reduction or art
and culture enrichment for un-
derprivileged residents.
Each program can receive up
to $75,000.
The Commission voted to
keep the funding limits in place
but wanted to review the process
used to approve agencies' pro-
grams.
Agencies must attend a pre-application workshop, submit a
written application and give an
oral presentation for funding ap-
proval.
Between the written applica-
tion and oral presentation, there
are 15 criteria
Gainesville.City the advisoryCrd ihsifOl'4 board uses to
assess eligi-
bility for funding, one of which is
proposed budgets for programs.
Commissioner Rodney Long
expressed doubts about a propos-
al from the partnership program
to weigh budget proposals heavi-
er than other application criteria."Weight becomes subjective to
people, especially when funding
is competitive," he said.
There were also concerns about
the way funding is disbursed.
Currently, the partnership pro-
gram gives different percentages
of the $75,000 limit to agencies
based on scores from the applica-
tion process.
Commissioner Mike Byerly
suggested an "all-or-none" sys-
tem, with a smaller number of
total agencies receiving the full
$75,000 instead of many agencies
receiving different percentages of
funding."It's about the programs, not
the agencies," he said. "Not ev-
erybody gets a little something."
Other commissioners, includ-
ing Commissioner Cynthia Moore
Chestnut, disagreed with the all-
or-none approach.
Chestnut said agencies skilled
in grant writing may receive pref-
erential treatment over less so-
phisticated agencies with equally
beneficial programs.
The Commission agreed to dis-
cuss criteria for funding, as well
as further expenditure limits for
poverty reduction programs, at a
later meeting on Feb. 3.
GAINESVILLE CITY COMMISSION
Officials set goals for land conservation, renovations
By LAUREN IRIZARRY
Alligator Contributing Writer
Despite a dwindling budget, the
Gainesville City Commission will still focus
on purchasing conservation land and reno-
vating public buildings in the new year.
Budget proposals won't be announced
until the summer, but the souring national
economy leads officials to expect deeper
budget cuts.
Still, Mayor Pegeen Hanrahan said shewants to help maintain the quality of life for
Gainesville residents.
"I'm cautiously optimistic," Hanrahan
said of the coming year.
Last year, the city was able to trim about
$2 million from the budget, she said. Still,
officials continue to face tough decisions re-
garding cutting costs and raising revenue.
One way Commissioner Jeauna
Mastrodicasa wants to increase city funds
is by tackling underage drinking in restau-
rants and bars.A proposed ordinance would force bars
and restaurants with too
many underage drinking
arrests to deny entry to
patrons under 21 after 9
p.m. This would decrease
the number of bar patrol
officers.
"It's an economic incen-
Hanrahan tive to manage underage
drinking and reduce police
costs," said Mastrodicasa, who is also UF'svice president of student affairs. Despite
cost-saving measures like the proposed or-
dinance, public service departments are not
immune from budget shortfalls.
Services like fire and police departments,
which Mastrodicasa said are usually safe
from budget cuts, will now be re-examined.
Mayor Hanrahan said managing the bud-
get is difficult, but she is ready to rise to the
challenge.
"The end goal is to continue to make
Gainesville a great place to live," she said.

UF repairs campus
roads over break
Some of UF's roads got a
makeover during winter break.
After most students scattered
home for the holidays, five sec-
tions of road were resurfaced,
which cost UF a total of $993,000.
It was the most significant re-
surfacing on the main campus in
the last ten years, said Jeff Bair,
project manager for the Physical
Plant Division.
The sections that were repaved
are Stadium Road from Gale
Lemerand Drive to Pugh Hall,
Buckman Drive from Pugh Hall
to University Avenue, Newell
Drive from Museum Road to
Union Road and two sections
of Museum Road: from Radio
Road to Village Drive and from
Gale Lemerand Drive to BeatyTowers.
The roads had not been resur-
faced in more than 20 years, Bair
said.
The new resurfacing should
last 25 years or more, he said.
Bair said the project began
on Dec. 19 and was completed
Saturday.
Local Crews shouldNewS be finished- reap-
plying the stripes,
crosswalks and with other finish-
ing touches within a month, Bair
said.
Bair also said UF plans to te-
place the concrete dividers that
separated the bicycle lanes from
regular traffic on Stadium Road
and Buckman Drive.

ABOUT 3,000 MILES SO FAR.
By CAROLYN TILLO
Alligator Contributing Writer
Ryan Bowen does not need a
plane or car to travel from Los
Angeles to the presidential inau-
guration.
He has his bicycle.
Bowen, a photographer whose
journey is called Biking for Obama,
set off on Dec. 2 from Los Angelesfor a bicycle ride that will end in
Washington, D.C., on Jan. 20.
He arrived on Turlington Plaza
at about 12:30 p.m. Tuesday to
talk with students about how the
concepts of hope and change in
Obama's campaign are represent-
ed through his bicycle journey.
Bowen said his bicycle is a ve-
hicle for change.
It is an unconventional forn
of transportation, but an environ-
mentally friendly one, he said,
adding that cycling is a good way
to stay healthy.
For over three decades,
the Alligator has brought readers

Now, it's your turn.

Editorial
Senate Snafu
Illinois shouldn't let
Burris take Senate seat
oland W. Burris wants you to know that he's not
here looking for drama.
Unfortunately for Burris, the would-be successor
to President-elect Barack Obama's Senate seat happened
to be appointed by that governor whose last name no one
seems to know how to pronounce.
You know, Illinois Gov. Rod Bla-go-ya-vich.
A few spritzes of "eau du credibility" would do little
for Burris at this point as he futilely attempts to ward off
the stench left by beleaguered Blagojevich surrounding his
appointment.
The Editorial Board believes Burris has an insatiable
thirst for drama -consumed with a selfish ideology to
ensure that the empty space on the side of his mausole-
um bears the title of senator long before he takes his final
breath.
The grave already informs the world of the many il-
lustrious accomplishments racked up by Burris over the
course of his political career.
From Illinois comtroller moving up the ranks to state
attorney general, the Editorial Board politely tips their
proverbial caps to Burris for his public service to the peo-
ple from the Land of Lincoln.
Whether Burris is qualified for the position of U.S.
Senator is not for the Editorial Board to decide.
All we want is for Burris to take a step back and let the
law dictate who will assume the seat vacated by Obama.
He shouldn't be causing more distractions by showing up
on Capitol Hill and expecting a seat.
It's not that some of Burris' fellow Democrats are delib-
erately giving the man the cold shoulder -rather, they are
looking out for the health and future of the party, which
trumps any run-of-the-mill politician with delusions of
grandeur.
The Editorial Board wonders if Illinois even wants a
senator who more or less begged for the job by conceding
he would refrain from seeking re-election?
While Burris may not have "paid to play" like some of
his fellow Chicagoans, he sure isn't helping his sleaze quo-
tient as he tries to sneak in the back door in the wake of
political corruption.
We are afraid that Burris couldn't care less about the
circumstances in which he is seated as the junior senator
from the state of Illinois.
His obsession with validating his career with the bright
shiny letters of S-E-N before his name is nothing short
of unsettling and disappointing -hardly a recipe for the
African American community's lone voice in the Senate to
win over his constituency.
Pushing his own agenda may very well result in Burris
assuming Obama's vacant seat, but sadly, he risks demean-
ing his legacy to a fleeting memory of everything that
transpired before he even steps foot in his plush Senate
office.
Burris, whose tombstone boasts the phrase "Trail
Blazer," can only save face if he backs off his approach
of entitlement to the position and humbly acknowledges
the cloud of uncertainty and scandal surrounding Gov.
Blagojevich.
If not, it won't be long before the Senate plays musical
chairs again and Burris finds himself without a seat.

Server crash no match for new staff
S orry, guys.If you picked up Monday's paper (and hopefully
you did!), you may have noticed something strange.
No, it wasn't the gargantuan size of the 32-page behe-
moth of an Alligator. It was the content.
We're sorry we had to run a whopping 15 Associated
Press stories. (We've been working here for years and
that's the most we've ever seen printed in one edition).
Sorry about the Oklahoma/Oklahoma State confu-
sion on the front page, a mixup that will surely send us to
Gator fan hell.
Sorry that little "partly cloudy" clip art wasn't next to
the indexes on Page 1.
But we realized something last night, sometime be-
tween the server crash at midnight and its eventual resus-
citation at 1:30 a.m.
Maybe they won't notice the missing weather icon.
Maybe the readers want more AP articles.
What a lot of our readers may not realize is that it takes
a hell of a lot of blood, sweat and tears to generate each
edition of the Alligator. As you may have read last semes-
ter, we've had some "issues" (pun totally intended) with
employee turnover and low morale in the newsroom.
We've had to do some serious brainstorming to try to re-
solve these issues.
We transformed the newsroom from '70s wood panel-
ing hell to something that could arguably be called shabby
chic. Our secret: six coats of a paint named Cool Elegance,
a lot of Tegan and Sara sing-alongs and the installation of
a twin bed in the editor's office.
(We're not kidding. There really is a bed in there, and
we've already slept on it).
Even with our improved digs, putting out a paper is no
easy feat. It involves assigning stories, which have to bereported and written before they go
through several editors. Photos are
assigned, snapped and edited. All
of this happens while you guys are
sleeping, going to class and watch-
ing The Office.
Kristin Bjornsen And it happens every day.
Nrisiole s e When you factor in a debilitatingNicole Safker server crash, a staff still in training
Rachel Roy and a paper that would be a feat for
Editorial Notebook a full staff to fill, the potential for di-
saster increases by roughly 89 per-
cent (and we suck at math).
But last night, as the entire staff sat assembled at 1 a.m.
in the production room waiting for the servers to come
back online, no one was complaining. By the way, the
deadline for all pages to be sent is 12:50 every night, no ex-
ceptions. Even Rachel, our lone online guru, stayed until
the bitter end and sleepily published the last story to our
Web site at 6:30 a.m. -and she's not doing that again.
For us, not being able to publish both print and online
versions of yesterday's paper was not an option.
There are so many things that can and will go wrong,
but one thing that will never change is our dedication to
you, the reader.
Please tell us what's working for you.
Or, if you so desire, come work for us. We're having an
open house this Friday from noon to 5 p.m. If you're inter-
ested in joining us -- and working here is fun, we promise
-stop in. We can't wait to meet you.

No mercy not fair
Thanks for reminding us why
we all hate you, Bernie, by not
only reminding us how patheti-
cally few tickets students get
compared to alumni, but also by
giving us your standard holier-
than-thou insistence that we go
to class while you nurse your
hangover in Miami.

Conflict coverage biased
The entire Israeli-Palestinian
conflict is a very divisive topic incontemporary American society.
Religious preference, ethnicity,
political affiliation and social sta-
tus often define and pervade the
deep rifts that characterize this
60-year-old dispute.
The current situation involv-
ing the Israeli bombardment and
incursion into Palestinian terri-
tories has undoubtedly agitated
many strongly held beliefs and
emotions on all sides of the con-
flict.
On page 13 in yesterday's
Alligator there was an Associated
Press wire story describing
Israel's refusal to accept any callsfor a cease-fire that also ran with
a picture.
The story was well balanced,
but the picture -which showed
an Israeli child looking at dam-
age done to a building by Hamas
rocket fire -editorialized other-
wise fair and balanced coverage
of a major world event.
This picture undeniably did a
poor job capturing the Palestinian
point of view of the conflict and
totally ignored the suffering of
Gazans.
It is important to note that be-
fore the current Israeli military
operation even started, there hadbeen a brutal 1 1/2-year Israeli
blockade imposed on the entire
Gaza Strip.
Other than for intermittent aid
provided by the United Nations,
this blockade did not allow any
food supplies, medicine, gas or
monetary aid to be delivered to
the Gaza Strip.
Now, on top of the blockade's
effects on the Gazan civilian
population -and on the heels
of Israel breaking its agreement
to a cease-fire with Hamas -
the heavy Israeli shelling has
killed more than 550 Palestinians
and injured 2,500 other Gazans,including 200 civilians. Many
of those injured or killed were
women and children.
Moreover, through this unbal-
anced coverage, the voices and
points of view of many UF stu-
dents were marginalized and left
in the dark.
In the future, the entire
Alligator staff must be more
sensitive to alternative points of
view and provide its readers with
increased fairness and balance
when it comes to such discordant
issues.

Few to make Miami drive
BCS, from page 1
als with Gator 1 Cards will be ad-
mitted into the O'Connell Center
after 5:30 p.m.
The Reitz Grand Ballroom
doors will open at 6 p.m. Orange
& Brew will be open during its
regular hours.
While Gator fans are mak-
ing plans to attend one of the
three venues to watch the game
or have game day arrangements
of their own, a fraction are mak-
ing the five-hour, 325-mile drive
to cheer in the stands at Dolphin
Stadium.
"Gainesville would definitely
be the best place for a post-game
celebration, but you never know
when the Gators will play in the
championship again," said UF
graduate student Josh Altshuler.
"No matter how crazy the streets
get, there is no replacing seeing
your team win in person."
The same three campus ven-
ues were open for the champion-
ship game in 2007 when UF beat
Ohio State.
While the O'Connell Center
has a capacity of 12,000 under
normal circumstances, about10,000 fans are expected to attend
tomorrow night based on past
championships.
Because certain areas of the
O'Connell Center will be blocked
off, fewer seats will be available
there.
However, the blocked sections
will ensure all attendees have a
good view of the screens, said UF
spokesman Steve Orlando.
Orlando, who
Orlando
via telephone.attended the
BCS title game in
2007 in Arizona,
overheard the
excitement of
people celebrat-
ing in the streets
of Gainesville
"After the game I actually
called people I knew who were
watching in the O-Dome," he
said.
Seeing the team live is pre-
ferred, but being in the O'Connell
center is a great option, Orlando
said.
Tailgating will not be permit-
ted on campus Thursday to avoid
distracting students in class and
so UF facilities can carry on their
daily tasks, Orlando said.60 people attend to Sunday protest
GAZA, from page 1
University Avenue and 13th Street, El-Assar
said.
"We're protesting the killing on either
side," El-Assar said. "No matter what started
it or what political ideologies there are, we
value the human life."
Both Bull and El-Assar objected to recent
media coverage, saying it was biased.
"People are saying Hamas started it," El-
Assar said. "But this didn't start last week.
This is not a fair fight. We have hospitals be-
ing bombed and civilians being killed."
Naomi Fireman, vice president of commu-
nications for the Jewish Student Union, dis-
agrees.
"Israel has every right to defend itself,"
she said, adding the attacks were not intend-ed to hurt civilians.
Fireman said people in Israel live in con-
stant fear. Her cousins, who live there, are
not allowed to play soccer outside due to the
constant threat of bombings, she
On said.
Campus "Parents live in fear for their
children," she said.
Fireman said the Jewish
Student Union has organized a peaceful po-
litical rally called "No More Hamas" for Jan.
15 to be held in Turlington Plaza.
There will be signs and music as well as
people promoting awareness of the recent
events.
Students will also be able to write letters to
Israeli soldiers and their families.
"This is not a pro-Israel protest," she said.
"It is strictly against Hamas."
Expect high hopes, prices for title game
PREP, from page 1
in one case, burned a small
Christmas tree in the middle
of University Avenue, accord-
ing to Alligator archives.
"We've had enough events
here that we've hopefully
learned from our mistakes,"
said Mike Taphorn, gen-
eral manager at The Swamp
Restaurant.
The Swamp will have 20
security staff members on the
floor, 10 more than usual, to"People like to get
drunk and fight. We -
don't want to hand out
weapons."
David Millis
Tijuana Flats kitchen manager
handle the crowd, Taphorn
said.
Tijuana Flats, along with
most other bars and restau-
rants, won't be serving beer
in glass bottles, said DavidMillis, the restaurant's kitchen
manager.
"People like to get drunk
and fight," Millis said. "We
don't want to hand out weap-
ons."
All of the establishments
have been warned by the fire
marshal that capacity laws
will be strictly enforced on
game night.
Many of the bars will have
systems in place to ensure that
they don't breach capacity,
which could mean long lines
for eager fans.

FOOTBALL
Ingram to
dress, sit
By PHIL KEGLER
Alligator Staff Writer AW
pkegier@aIligator.org
MIAMI -It appeared to be one of
the misfortunes of sports, one of those
bad things that happen to good people.
When Comelius Ingram tore his
ACL in August, teammates, coaches
and media members alike felt for the
senior who always seemed to put his
best foot forward.
His speedy recovery coupled with
freakish athleticism led to rumors that
he might return for the BCS National
Championship Game, despite the fact
that many recoveries from similar inju-
ries take up to a year.
"It's not because we don't
want him. It's just not the right
thing to do. He's not healed
yet.
Urban Meyer
UF football coach
But coach Urban Meyer reiterated
this week that his star tight end will not
play against Oklahoma.
"It's not because we don't want
hini," Meyer said. "It's just not the right
thing to do. He's not healed yet."
It's a hard sell to Ingram, who may
well have circled this date on the calen-
dar as something to work toward dur-
ing rehab. Andrew stanfit / Alligator Staff

Cleaned-up trash talk too tame for big game
MIAMI- -
If I had to list the reasons why
I love sports, athletes talking trash
would certainly rank near the top. It's
as much a part of athletics as muscles,
sweat and egos, but the art of smack
talk seems to have fallen by the way-
side. lately.
We're on the eve of a dynamic na-
tional title matchup between No. 1 UF
and No. 2 Oklahoma. The game fea-
tures two Heisman Trophy winners
and will settle a huge debate between
the Big 12 and Southeastern confer-
ences for the title of best college foot-
ball league.
But here's the best trash talk we get:
"I'd say (UF quarterback Tim Tebow)Mike McCall
McCall-in' It Like I
See It
mmccalaIIigator.orgwould prob-
ably be about
the fourth-
best quarter-
back in our
conference,"
Oklahoma
cornerback
Dominique
Franks said on
Sunday.
F r a n k s
added that it's
easier to pre-
pare to face Tebow than Big 12 signal
callers Colt McCoy (Texas), Graham
Harrell (Texas Tech) and Sam Bradford
(Oklahoma) because they throw twiceas many passes per game.
Those comments sent media mem-
bers into a frenzy. When reporters
heard about what Franks said, they
scrambled to find someone who had
the quote so they could blog it or get
a story done.
It sickens me to see our standards
for quality trash talk lowered this
much.
First of all, what Franks said was
TRUE. Tebow would be the fourth-
best quarterback in the Big 12. He
might be a more valuable player than
that trio, but in offenses where the
goal is to launch footballs all over the
field to a zillion zig-zagging receivers

UF turns it on
in second half
By MIKE DIFERDINANDO
Alligator Staff Writer
mdiferdinando@aligator.org
It's all uphill from here.
UF (13-2) polished off its non-conference
schedule Tuesday night with a 95-69 thumping
of Longwood (7-9) in the O'Connell Center.
The Gators started off slow and took a 10-
point lead into halftime before outscoring the
Lancers 51-35 after the break.
Nick Calathes once again led the way for
the Gators, scoring 19 points, grabbing 10 re-
bounds and finishing two assists shy of a tri-
ple-double. It was his second double-double
of the season.
Forward Kenny Kadji scored 14 points
while shooting 70 percent from the field.
Now,. as the Gators turn
their attention to Saturday's
matchup with Mississippi
and the start of Southeastern
Conference play, they hope
the freshman will be able to
provide some much-needed
depth in the frontcourt.
"I need to keep getting
more consistent," Kadji said. "In high school,
you can get away with playing good one day
and then just relaxing the next. (In college),
you have to be ready every day, and it's some-
thing I'm working to get better at."
While Kadji has shown he can provide the
Gators with minutes off the bench early in the
season, even he isn't sure what to expect from
conference play.
"I have no clue," Kadji said. "I guess we'll
find out Saturday."
Calathes said that while he has tried to help
prepare his young teammates for the SEC, they
may have to experience it for themselves be-
fore they can fully understand the jump they
are about to make.
"The SEC is a lot stronger, a lot taller and a
lot tougher than the teams we have played so
far," Calathes said. "I think we definitely have
a tough task ahead of us."
UF coach Billy Donovan is also unsure
about how his team will fare in the coming
weeks.
"We are very inconsistent," Donovan said.
"But I think that is part of this team's growing
and maturing process.
"We have a big challenge ahead of us and
we need to figure out a way to handle that."
N With Oklahoma's starting running back De-
Marco Murray sidelined for Thursday's game,
leading rusher Chris Brown will shoulder the
load. For the full story and more championship

Tight end's NFL future No. 1 priority
INGRAM, from page 14
the game and warm up with the team, and he still
holds out hope for playing, although he admits
his only chance might be during a kneel-down at
the end of the game if UF is leading.
"This is what you come to college for -to
compete for a national championship," Ingram
said. "Sitting out the entire season was frustrat-
ing, and coming into this big-time environment
with the crowd and another great team you're
playing against -it's very highly anticipated."
He admitted that if it were up to him, he might
play Thursday He said he and Meyer have joked
about him possibly getting on the field.
"The only thing is, I haven't been out there in
pads and had the full contact yet," he said. "That's
the only thing I might be a little timid about. As
far as running, catching, cutting full-speed, I'm
doing all that, and it's coming along really well."
But he isn't worried about the anxiety that
plagues many athletes recovering from knee sur-
geries. Some never regain their old form because
they can't get back the complete confidence to
make cuts without thinking of the injury
Ingram said his situation is different because
of how he sustained the injury.
He did it without pads after being pulled
down by his shoulders. Very different, he said,
from someone who has his knee hit from differ-ent angles by defenders in full contact.
"Whenever I get back into it, I'll just be able to
go full-speed. I don't have any fear about it right
now," he said. "I feel like I rehabbed and did my
therapy process really well, so I feel like I'll be
ready to compete."
When asked about how Ingram has looked in
practice, DUF assistant coach Dan Mullen couldn't
suppress a smile.
"Oh yeah. Oh yeah," he said. "He can go."
But quickly after, he had a more somber out-
look.
"We were hoping maybe
there'd be a shot for him in this
game," Mullen said. "For his fu-
Football ture, with the doctors, they just
determined that it's better for
him to just keep preparing and
do some things. I watch him run routes and do
things out there. He looks fabulous."
Mullen understands Ingram's frustration, but
the coaches don't want to risk any possible fur-
ther.injury by rushing him back too fast.
"For him, unless the doctors say he's 100-
percent go, we wouldn't put his future at risk,"
Mullen said. "He has a tremendous future in
front of him. I imagine he's going to be a top pick
in the draft.
"That's where his focus needs to be. He's done
a great job. He's part of this team, part of this fam-
ily. He has a big future to worry about."MIKE, from page 14
at a fast pace, Bradford, McCoy
and Harrell are better-suited to
succeed.
Plus, it's not exactly an insult
to rank Tebow below two players
who edged him out in the Heisman
voting and a third who finished a
spot behind him.
I know there are plenty of
things the players are dying to say
about their opponents, but we'll
never hear it.
Desperate to avoid giving teams
"bulletin-board material," coaches
are constantly policing their play-
ers to avoid any statements that
could be considered out of line.
To make matters worse, this
season the Gators have been reeled
in tight by UF's Sports Information
Department, making it evenharder
to get quality smack from players.
Here's an example of how para-
noid people are: After UF topped
Arkansas this season, linebacker
Brandon Spikes told me it wasbecause the Razorbacks weren't
as tough or hardworking as the
Gators.
So, the media didn't see Spikes
again for quite some. time, report-
ers were barred from interviewing
players on the field for the next
game against LSU and I had a UF
staffer follow me all over the field
after the Florida-Georgia game to
make sure I didn't talk to Spikes.
Wow.
First off, the fear over giving a
foe an edge by spouting off to the
media is ridiculous.
Coaches fabricate stories and
trash talk all the time to motivate
players, so whether it's actually
said or not doesn't matter.
Do you really think Tebow is
going to play harder because of
Franks' comments? Do you think
there's anything anyone could say
to make any OU or UF players try
any harder on Thursday?
-My answer is no. Trash talk
doesn't affect the outcome of
games. It's just fun, and sports are
a little less interesting without it.
