UF was deemed one of the best academic bang-for-your-
buck schools in the country by the Princeton Review and Ki-
plinger.
UF landed at No. 7 on the Princeton Review’s list for public 
schools providing solid education with economic value. The 
list, released Tuesday, is based on an evaluation of more than 
30 benchmarks and student opinions.
The company’s criteria examine three factors: academics, 
cost of attendance and financial aid.
UF spokesman Steve Orlando said the ranking is signifi-
cant.
“We are proud of the quality of education and the value of 
the degree our students get,” Orlando said.
To determine academic quality, the company reviews ad-
missions competitiveness and professors’ teaching ability and accessibility, according to the Princeton Review press release.  
UF’s 46.5-percent admissions rate and 21-1 student-faculty 
ratio contribute to competitive academic rankings, Orlando said. The company compiles the financial aid ranking based on the amount of need-based aid given to students and student opinions on satisfaction with that aid.
UF gives about $562 million annually in student financial 
aid. About 60 percent of UF undergraduates graduate with no 
student loan debt, Orlando said.
“That’s almost the opposite of the national trend,” he said.
The Princeton Review calculates the cost of attendance by 
including tuition, required fees and the cost of room and board. The company then subtracts the average amount of scholarship and grant money given to students.
UF followed University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill 
and University of Virginia for the No. 3 spot on Kiplinger’s list, which was published last month. UF has the lowest in-state 
cost on the company’s top 10 best-value public schools list and 
is the largest university represented, according to Kiplinger’s

Santa Fe College Teaching Zoo 
has some cool cats — and lemurs 
and peacocks and other animals coping with the recent freezing temperatures.
The zoo, which is home to more 
than 75 different animal species from around the world, has en-sured all of its animals have access to heat lamps and space heaters in both the outdoor cages and back enclosures. But unlike their human caretak-
ers and visitors, the animals have had very little trouble adjusting to the low temperatures, said Kenny Carawan, a third-semester zoo-keeper in the Santa Fe zoo technol-ogy program.
“For most of them, they deal 
fine with it,” said Carawan, 22. 
“We haven’t seen any changes 
in appearance — the birds keep preening, the primates keep clean-ing themselves.”
The zoo has seen fewer visitors 
since the cold front came to town, but the handful of people who have stopped by have seen their fair share of animal activity.
“We were talking about how 
it’s probably too cold for the ani-mals, and that they’d probably be hiding,” said 33-year-old Kathryn 
King, who visited the zoo Wednes-
day with her family. “We’re sur-prised how many are out.”
Stephanie Panabaker, a 23-year-
old third-semester zookeeper in the Santa Fe zoo technology pro-gram, said the animals didn’t spend all their time near the heat.
“Honestly, we zookeepers are 
more affected by the cold than the animals,” Panabaker said.VOLUME 108 ISSUE 89 WWW.ALLIGATOR.ORG THURSDAY, JANUARY 30, 2014

� FIFTY-SIX CANDIDATES SLATED WITH TACO LIBRE.

The Declaration of Independence guarantees Americans the 
rights to “life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness,” but this 
election season at UF, a new student party is adding the pursuit of tacos to that list.
Taco Libre Party, a party created last week, has joined in the 
student election race with one goal in mind: bringing Taco Bell 
back to UF’s campus.The two co-founders and co-party presidents, Stephanie 
Kreitzer and Micaela Montero Dokser, used to be members of 
the Students Party. They said they decided to splinter off from the party to focus on a single initiative.“We want to bring a brand-new perspective to student 
government — something that has never been done before,” Kreitzer, a 21-year-old UF accounting junior, wrote in an email. “We believe that by having a more established mission, we will be able to get more accomplished than if we were to have a long, vague laundry list of goals.”
Montero Dokser, a 21-year-old UF finance junior, agreed 
and said the party’s single initiative platform should encourage students to get involved with Student Government and show 
them it can be exciting.

While many college students 
fear the dreaded Freshman 15, oth-
ers are more concerned about how they are going to scrape up enough money to pay for their next meal. 
A recent study by Oregon State 
University found that about 60 percent of college students at one Oregon university had been food insecure at some point in 2013.
Food insecurity is defined by the 
U.S. Department of Agriculture as “a household-level economic and social condition of limited or un-certain access to adequate food.”
Two new questions were add-
ed to the Healthy Gator survey in Spring 2013 pertaining to food insecurity, said Natalie Rella, a health promotion specialist at Ga-torWell.
The results of the 2013 survey 
showed that 22 percent of UF stu-dents skipped meals occasionally in the last year to save money. 
“I think it’s a problem if any 
percentage of student is saying that they’re skipping meals to save money very often,” Rella said.The results also showed that 
about 3 percent of students ob-tained emergency help from some sort of food provider like a food pantry or soup kitchen.
Although only a small percent-
age of students said they received emergency help, Rella still finds it scary to think a young person is going to a food pantry.
“They’ve worked hard enough 
to make it into UF, and now they are unable to feed themselves,“ Rella said.
One Gainesville option for stu-
dents in need is Gainesville Har-vest at Santa Fe College, a food pantry on SFC’s campus.
“Anybody of the Santa Fe com-
munity can come each Monday to get a bread and sweet,” said Sarah Stone, a retired professor of SFC and current volunteer at the food pantry.However, only people with 
vouchers issued by a counselor or someone of authority at SFC are permitted to receive nonperishable food items from the pantry. 
Janis Mena, a registered dieti-
tian at the UF Student Health Care Center, thinks the food pantry at SFC is a great way to help students deal with food insecurity.
“Most of them are fulltime 
workers, fulltime parents and fulltime college students,” Mena said. “So they’ve got a lot on their plates, so to speak, and maybe not a whole lot on their plate.”

Pint-sized, caped crusaders 
will dash through campus on 
Sunday, and it’s all for the kids. 
The annual FT5K, a 5K race 
hosted by Dance Marathon, 
will raise money and aware-
ness for the UF Health Shands Children’s Hospital, which is Gainesville’s local Children’s Miracle Network Hospital.
For this year’s superhero-
themed race, a new addition is the Mini K, a short run that is open to children, said Jordan 
Robbins, the DM community 
events overall chair.
“We did not have the Mini 
K last year, so I’m hoping for a good turnout with that,” the 22-year-old UF public relations senior said. 
Preregistration for the “Save 
the Day FT5K Presented by the Collier Companies”  is current-ly open online at floridadm.org/FT5K. Day-of registration will begin at 8 a.m., and the race will start at about 9 a.m. at the Commuter Lot. 
Molly Vazquez, the DM 
public relations overall chair, 
said she believes events like this 
are good occasions for the DM staff to spread the word about the miracles the Children’s Mir-acle Network makes happen.
“It has the opportunity for 
more people to start to love the cause and want to volunteer their time to it,” the 21-year-old

This semester’s collaborative class between 
industrial and systems engineering and the fine 
arts department may be the last of its kind.
Last semester, Elif Akcali, an associate profes-
sor of industrial and systems engineering, cre-
ated a mandatory class that uses fine arts to teach 
engineering students how to communicate their work to a greater audience.
“Unless we can communicate these complex 
projects, the public won’t understand what the engineers do, and it’s a huge opportunity that’s missed,” Akcali said. 
Engineering students taking the class this se-
mester will have to turn in a drawing portfolio, a six- to eight-panel storyboard or comic and a 
four- to six-minute modern dance piece created 
with students from the dance performance pro-gram. 
Akcali collaborated with dance, drawing and 
storytelling professors at UF to create a curricu-lum and offered the class for the first time in Fall 2013.
“It was really a grand experiment,” Akcali 
said. “We told them we might fail but to just come to class and do their best.”
However, due to the limited availability of 
dance professors to teach an interdisciplinary class, the grand experiment may be over. But Akcali remains positive about the impact of the course.
“Even if they’re the only class that gets to do 
this, I know they’re fundamentally changed,” she said.
Students like Rae Knopik, an 18-year-old UF 
dance performance freshman who worked with 
a team of engineering students last semester on 
a project, agreed the course helps promote aca-demic growth outside students’ majors. 
“It was actually a really cool experience be-
cause we were both — engineers and dancers — learning about the same topic and how to repre-sent it in different visual areas,” she said. 
Michelle Gauthreaux, a 22-year-old UF indus-
trial and systems engineering senior, just started 
taking the class and said she thinks it will add the 
human factor to her project. 
“We’re really good at math and the hard sci-
ences, but it’s not always easy to explain that to other people,” she said.Engineering students dance, draw

A new smoke-ring device could 
soon change the dynamic of hookah 
culture in Gainesville.
Monkey O’s was conceived when 
Gene Gamble, a 27-year-old former 
University of South Florida student, 
was watching “The Mask” during the scene where Jim Carrey’s character blew smoke rings to impress a girl.
A couple months later, Gamble 
teamed up with Miraj Patel, a 22-year-old UF marketing graduate, to design the glass device, which is shaped like a cone cut off before the tip with a hole 
in the base.  Monkey O’s will come in a 
variety of colors.
The name was inspired by how the founders recommend using the prod-uct. Gamble and Patel suggested mak-ing the “ooh ooh ah ah” sounds like a monkey through the piece.
Sam Bhattacharjee, the owner of In-
finity Lounge at 12 SW Second St., said he ordered 20 Monkey O’s after Gam-
ble and Patel presented the product.
“Given that hookah lounges in gen-
eral are an upcoming trend, I think it’s 
going to go really well,” Bhattacharjee said.
While the product relies on smok-
ing to produce the rings, Gamble and Patel said they don’t promote tobacco consumption.
Gamble said he’s looking forward 
to adding an element of entertainment to the hookah lounge experience.
“People go sometimes just to blow 
smoke,” he said. “Why can’t you be entertained as well?”New hookah product has

UF’s Student Legal Services will be temporarily relocated 
near Carleton Auditorium due to construction in the Reitz 
Union.
The move from Reitz Union, Room 268, to Walker Hall, 
Room 215, is expected to take place Feb. 10. Legal services is 
expected to remain at the new location for about 18 months.
Layne Prebor, assistant general counsel for Student Legal Services, said the move has been a smooth one so far, except for 
possible confusion about the relocation.
“Students would come to the Reitz Union looking for us,” 
he said. “They wonder where we are at, and they have to trek all the way across campus for it. If we could save them a trip, I thought that would be great.”
Alisha Tabag, legal services assistant director, said the move 
should increase its exposure to students.
“People are closer, and people don’t have to walk across 
campus,” she said. “We’re right in the middle.”
Heather Cooper, a student legal services legal intern, said 
she doesn’t think the students will be affected by the move.

er,” the 26-year-old second-year UF law student said. UF Legal Services relocating amidst Reitz construction

UF uses a background-checking 
service whose parent company’s 
government screening unit is being sued by the U.S. government.
The federal government is suing 
USIS for fraud after the company submitted more than 650,000 incom-plete checks, which the government uses for hiring, Reuters reported.    
UF first began using HireRight, 
Inc., in 2008 to complete criminal background checks on its employ-ees.
Paula Fussell, the vice president 
for human resource services at UF, said UF does not have a contract with HireRight but uses the company for select background checks.
“We’ve had a really good rela-
tionship with HireRight,” she said. “Right now we don’t have plans to change.”
USIS was reportedly used for the 
background check on National Secu-rity Agency whistleblower Edward Snowden, as reported by Reuters. 
“The good thing about criminal 
background checks is you find out if someone has a criminal history,” Fus-sell said. “The bad thing is it doesn’t tell you what people plan to do.”
Criminal background checking at 
UF is done for all new hires in techni-cal, executive, administrative, mana-gerial support and faculty positions. UF uses HireRight for criminal back-ground checking on a national level. 
Fussell said HireRight has been 
helpful in background checking UF faculty.
“We wanted them because they 
were able to process the volume,” she said, “and process them in a timely basis at a reasonable cost.”
HireRight criminal background 
checks cost about $50. The checks search from anything between social security validations to address histo-ries.  
Joe Khan, a 28-year-old UF chemi-
cal engineering graduate student, said because of HireRight’s connec-tion to USIS, UF should look to use other background checking compa-nies.
“They should look into other 
competent competitors,” he said. “I’m sure there are better options out there.”Background-check service

Python invasion has spread from the 
Everglades to the virtual world.
Orlando-based game studio Biggles-
worth Studios announced the development 
of a mobile video game designed to shed 
light on the Burmese python, an invasive 
species slithering through South Florida. 
Players will “control a Burmese python 
with their finger as they go on a virtual expedition through the Everglades,” said Necole Pynn, Bigglesworth Studios spokes-woman.
The educational aspect of the game is in 
line with the evolution of video games, said 
Dennis Frohlich, a 28-year-old UF doctoral 
student and professor of a class called The Cultural Impact of Video Games.“A lot of people are looking into using 
video games for teaching because people learn through all sorts of different means,” he said. 
But Frohlich said it may be difficult to 
engage players. 
“The challenge is: How do you make 
it interactive without too much informa-tion?” he said.
UF biologists and professors have been 
working to promote awareness of the real-world python invasion. Last year, the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission partnered with a UF research center to organize a monthlong event where hunters were encouraged to capture 
the snakes.
For students like Michael Pham, a 20-
year-old UF computer engineering junior, 
the game promotes awareness.
“I don’t even know what a Burmese 
python is,” Pham said. “I’ll go Google it now.”Florida python invasion

Some students dissatisfied with aid
website. 
Karim Hussain, a 21-year-
old in-state UF marketing and 
English senior, said he will graduate with some debt. How-
ever, he said he is satisfied with 
the amount of money he gets from financial aid and Florida Bright Futures Scholarship Pro-gram.“I feel like I’m getting a high-
quality education, especially for universities within Florida,” Hussain said.
Ross Elpren, an 18-year-old UF exploratory freshman, said out-of-state tuition along with housing and other school-relat-ed expenses cost about $40,000 every year. He said he wasn’t satisfied with his financial aid 
disbursement but still considers 
a UF education a good value.
“I’m getting a great educa-
tion here, and that’s the reason I did come to UF,” Elpren said. “Hopefully the value will even itself out when I go for a job.”vAlUe , from page 1
The party was created last week
tion season — and tacos,” she said. “The Taco Li-
bre Party was created to increase student interest in Student Government, not just to claim votes.”
Students Party Spokesperson Alex Klayman 
said because Students Party and Taco Libre Party are both minority parties, he had reached out to them to discuss their future plans but hasn’t re-ceived responses.
“They’re totally separate from us,” he said. 
“We’re both minority parties in a very majority party system.” 
Students Party had a total of 14 candidates slate with them. 
Swamp Party spokesperson Susan Webster 
spoke on behalf of the party and said, “We think 
all competition is healthy competition, and we 
are excited to continue to show the Student Body that the Swamp Party works for the best interest of all students.” 
Swamp Party had about 540 candidates qual-
ify and slate.
During the three-day slating process, 56 
people qualified and slated with the Taco Libre Party. 
Despite the slating turn out, some students are 
not pleased with the fiesta-minded theme Taco Libre Party has in mind for the election.
Sen. Michael Christ, minority party leader, 
said he thinks the third party is “pathetic” and “insulting.” 
“It’s offensive to both parties… the student 
body and the process as a whole,” the 20-year-old junior said. “It appears to be them having jokes at 
the expense of the Student Body. I’m confident 
students will express their discontent with jokes like this at the ballot box.”tACo , from page 1“I’m getting a great

Taglit-Birthright Israel, the free, 10-day 
heritage trip to Israel for young, Jewish 
adults, recently made changes to its eligibil-ity requirements that will now allow more people to apply.
Previously, applicants were not eligible if 
they had been to Israel as part of a touring group, educational trip, study program or extended residential program after age 12. The changes moved this age to 18. 
Arik Maurice, a 19-year-old UF mechani-
cal and aerospace engineering freshman, was previously unable to participate in Birthright because he went on an education-
al trip to Israel in eighth grade.
“I was ecstatic after the rules expanded,” 
he said. “I was born in Israel and still have 
many friends that I rarely get to see because of the exorbitant costs of ﬂ  ights to Israel, so this opportunity is perfect.”
Maurice, who plans to apply to Birthright 
this summer, said he considers the trip a great opportunity for students to experience 
a country with a history and society that im-
pact world news, science and politics on a regular basis.
UF biology sophomore Abby Solomon 
said she took a one-month trip to Israel the summer after her sophomore year of high school and was ineligible for Birthright until now.
Solomon, 19, plans to use the expansion 
as a way to plan a reunion with friends she made on her ﬁ  rst Israel trip.
“Birthright is such a cool opportunity be-
cause trips to Israel are so expensive,” Solo-mon said. “Being able to go anywhere for 10 
days for free is rare, and Israel has so much 
to offer to young Jewish kids like me.”
Rabbi Gail Swedroe, assistant director of 
UF Hillel, said she considers Birthright an opportunity for students to engage with Is-
raelis their own age.
“It is a great cultural exchange,” Swedroe 
said. “It is meant to whet your appetite to 
hope you will go back for a longer time.”
Swedroe said she believes the interest in Birthright is about the same since the expan-
sion, but a greater number of Hillel students 
is now able to apply to the program. Travel-ing with UF allows participants to expand their campus Jewish community, she add-ed.“Having that intense immersion experi-
ence with your peers is really attractive to people,” she said.

If you haven’t heard about it yet, UF is being sued by 
a gun-rights group for not allowing on-campus resi-dents to keep guns in their dorm rooms.
The group, Florida Carry, Inc., successfully sued the 
University of North Florida over its ban on guns in cars on campus. UF amended its policy to reﬂ  ect this ruling, but Florida Carry thinks guns should be allowed elsewhere. 
But it looks like they need some target practice. In spite 
of a press release touting the impending lawsuit, there’s been some delay in serving the court papers to UF be-cause of typos, including a wrong ZIP code, the Alligator reported.
Of course, on-campus residents aren’t prevented from 
having guns in the ﬁ  rst place. Firearm owners can store their weapons safely with the University Police, checking them out when they need them.
However, that defeats the purpose of gun ownership 
— at least in the eyes of gun-rights activists. 
The logic is that, in the event of some violent crime un-
folding, a gun owner may prevent it by killing the perpe-trator. Of course, in this fallacy, the logic makes sense. 
But that’s the problem. It’s unlikely some altruistic 
do-gooder with a concealed carry license will be around the corner every time someone commits a violent crime. Think about it. How many mass shootings ended with the shooter dead at the hands of an armed vigilante?
What’s more disconcerting about this line of thinking 
is the idea that anyone on the street has the wherewithal to discern whether a criminal needs to be met with deadly force in the ﬁ  rst place. 
Police ofﬁ  cers follow guidelines and train to know 
how to deal with criminal activity, and they still make mistakes. In September, police injured two tourists in Times Square while shooting an “emotionally disturbed” suspect after he put his hand in his pocket and pretended to shoot at the ofﬁ  cers. In the end, he was brought down by a Taser.It’s a matter of semantics. 
Gun-rights activists believe ﬁ  re-arms can be a lifesaving tool.  They’re anything but that. 
They are tools designed to 
take lives, whether it’s a riﬂ  e for hunting deer or a revolver for self defense. And that’s what it really comes down to for gun 
rights — the ability to defend yourself. I get that. 
But thinking that more guns will solve the problem of 
violent crime is like thinking you can cure someone ad-dicted to pain pills by giving them more to ease their suf-fering. It only makes the problem worse. 
I’m not saying we should ban guns, but thinking guns 
save lives is like thinking gas can put out a ﬁ  re. It doesn’t work.
The university is right to have such a strong policy 
against guns on campus. Its methods don’t inhibit stu-dents from owning ﬁ  rearms: Instead, they promote safety by having weapons stored securely. 
A few years ago, a ban on tobacco products on campus 
was put in place. Smoking cigarettes is, of course, legal. 
But no one is suing to allow Catherine to smoke a 
Camel on her way to class. It’s understood that cigarettes harm others, too — so they aren’t allowed. Seems pretty logical.
Guns don’t save lives. Guns take lives. Bringing them 
into dorm rooms will do nothing but encourage their use. 
Instead, we should focus on other ways to keep cam-
pus safe. 
Considering the lack of armed conﬂ  ict on school 
grounds, it seems there’s no need for gun-wielding vigi-
lantes.

Florida won’t be-
come ‘Coloradoized’
On Monday, the Florida Supreme Court approved a 
medicinal marijuana bill that will be included on the November 2014 general election ballot. Overall, the 
Orlando Sentinel reported, the marijuana issue is “broadly popular with Florida voters.” The news is a cause for celebra-
tion with groups in the state who have been tirelessly petition-
ing to add medical marijuana to the ballot — including the ever-present pack of petitioners outside the Alachua County Library. 
As more states pass legislation allowing the sale of medical 
marijuana, the country seems to be warming up to the idea. According to a Pew Research Center report from April, a na-tional survey found that 52 percent of Americans support the legalization of marijuana while 45 percent do not. According 
to the report, support for the drug’s legalization has risen 11 
points since 2010. 
Of course, the bill that will appear on the November ballot 
supports medicinal marijuana use — not recreational. So we were surprised when Florida House Speaker Will Weatherford released the following statement to the Orlando Sentinel. 
“Make no mistake,” he said, “this is not about compas-
sionate medical marijuana. This is about the Coloradoﬁ  cation of Florida, where the end game is a pot shop on every street 
corner.”
The medical marijuana debate is murky; many assume that 
its legalization for medicinal purposes will inevitably lead to 
the legalization of its recreational use or that regulation will be minimal and allow for many people to abuse the system. 
In Florida, however, it’s far too early to tell, and the gen-
eral public still has nine months to decide its stance. In that time, advocates for medical marijuana such as Ben Pollara, the campaign manager of United For Care, will be working 
to educate the public on the beneﬁ  ts marijuana has for people 
suffering from debilitating diseases such as cancer, glaucoma, HIV/AIDS, hepatitis C or “other conditions for which a phy-sician believes that the medical use of marijuana would likely outweigh the potential health risks for a patient,” according to the Sentinel. 
Furthermore, comparing Florida to Colorado is like com-
paring apples to oranges — or recreational weed to oranges. Republicans in the Florida Senate are sensing their power is 
slipping; Rick Scott’s approval rating is slipping in favor of 
Charlie Crist, according to the Miami Herald, and politicians like Weatherford are grasping at straws to condemn a bill that’s almost guaranteed to pass. Their scare tactics and sensa-tionalized claims, however, won’t be able to match the aggres-sive efforts of the bill’s champion, John Morgan, an Orlando trial lawyer who has invested heavily in the cause. 
“I think the amendment kind of passes itself. It’s like ‘Are 
you in favor of fresh air?’” Morgan told the Sentinel. “But with 
that said, at Morgan and Morgan we don’t take anything for 
granted. Something that seems obvious might not be, so we 
will play it as if we’re behind. That’s how we will treat this 
campaign.”

Aspiring Gainesville models 
and designers may get their big 
breaks at Gainesville Fashion 
Week’s model casting call on Sat-
urday.
GFW director of social me-
dia  Niko Pifferetti said Christine 
Harris, owner of Premiere Model 
Management, confirmed that her agency will be scouting for a fresh face at GFW.
Models from Premiere have 
been featured in high-fashion runway shows, including Ver-sace.
The casting call, which will 
kick off GFW’s seventh season, will be held at GFW Headquar-ters, 2444 NE First Blvd., Suite 700.
The casting is open to design-
ers from 10 a.m. to noon and to models from noon to 5 p.m. 
Casting call applications for 
models and designers can be 
found on gainesvillefashionweek.
com.
Pifferetti said they will be 
looking for models with perva-sive personality — models whose 
styles show in their walks and 
poses.
Roberta Fiorito, GFW direc-tor of media relations, said this year’s theme is growth and emer-gence. The team is focused on ex-panding the public view of GFW, 
she said.
The theme is fitting as GFW 
has access to a larger audience 
this year. Jacksonville will not be hosting its fashion week this 
year, which opens up the North 
Central Florida market, Fiorito said.
Pifferetti and Fiorito said they 
have been scouting for models at UF on campus and around Gainesville and have reached out to design schools in search of emerging designers.
“We’ve cast the net wide look-
ing for fresh talent,” Pifferetti said.
No modeling experience is nec-
essary to attend the casting call. Pifferetti said for anyone who is apprehensive about walking in 6-inch heels, there will be runway walking clinics and coaching for 
models who are chosen for the 
show. 
Veteran model Kirill Korytov, 
26, was approached by GFW at 
one of its promotional events in 
late 2010. He had never modeled before but always thought about trying to get into the industry.
“They really gave me the push to get started,” Korytov said.
Since 2011, he has been in 
multiple GFW events and has ap-peared in print shoots and other 
fashion weeks around the state.“I love the whole industry, but 
creative photo shoots and high 
fashion are the most fun for me,” he said.
Opposite of what people see on cutthroat reality shows, it’s a supportive environment, Kory-tov said.
“It’s a great group of people 
that I really enjoy working with,” 
Korytov said. “Everyone here is 
super nice and nonjudgmental.”

Whether you don’t have time to read 
the book or can’t wait to see what the big 
screen does with your favorite words, 2014 
is bringing some exciting book-to-movie 
adaptations to life. Here’s a look at what to expect. 
1. “Vampire Academy”
School gets a little more exciting when 
you add supernatural creatures. “Vampire 
Academy” is the story of a half-human, half-vampire girl who is best friends and bodyguard to vampire royalty. Combining 
magical good and evil with “Mean Girls” 
makes this a fun escape from reality.
Perfect for you: If you’re looking for  a 
guilty pleasure to fill the post-“Twilight” 
void in your life.
Hits theatres: Feb. 72. “Divergent”
In this dystopian uni-
verse, your entire life is 
based on which faction 
you choose. 
Kind of like being 
sorted into houses at 
Hogwarts, the different 
factions portray different personalities, from the fearless Dauntless to the selfless Abnegation.
But Tris is different. 
And she finds her life in danger when 
an authoritarian leader wants to end her 
kind.
She doesn’t fit into the cookie cutter 
mold she’s supposed to, and this causes all sorts of trouble. 
Perfect for you: If you’re looking for 
the new “The Hunger Games.”
Hits theatres: Mar. 213. “The Fault in our 
Stars”
Hazel Lancaster and 
Gus Waters both have cancer. 
But more importantly, 
Hazel and Gus fall in 
love at a cancer support 
group. 
Yet again, John Green proves he is the 
master of the teen love story with this 
heartwarming tale of relationships, life 
and loss.
This is sure to be one of the most 
highly anticipated movies with social me-
dia already in a feelings frenzy over the 
heart-wrenching trailer that was released 
Wednesday.
Perfect for you: If you’re OK with shed-
ding a few tears. 
Hits theatres: June 64. “The Giver”Before dystopian societies were cool, 
there was this book. 
Jonas grows up in a deceivingly perfect 
society where everyone is the same, and everything is controlled. There is no war, pain or suffering.
But everything changes when he turns 
12 and is chosen to learn about the beauti-ful and terrible past of the world from the Giver. 
However, we caught a glimpse of Bren-
ton Thwaites,  the actor playing Jonas, and there is nothing pre-teen about him.
But with a cast that also includes Meryl 
Streep, Katie Holmes and Jeff Bridges, this 
movie shouldn’t disappoint. 
Oh, and Taylor Swift is in it, too.
Perfect for you: If you remember loving 
this book in middle school.

Head in the Clouds 
Domenic Henderson, a 21-year-old UF drawing se-
nior, doesn’t use an eraser when he draws with a black colored pencil because he likes the idea that he can’t make a mistake. He said his art tells an autobiographical narrative, and he always starts his work drawing the left eye of his subject. He is inﬂ  u-enced by Chinese symbolism and nephelococcygia — the art of watching shapes in clouds.

Blurred Lines
Dounia Bendris, a 21-year-old UF drawing senior, doesn’t like hard lines in her work, so she uses her ﬁ  ngers to smear her charcoal drawings. With black-stained hands, her ﬁ  ngerprints create a shadow and light effect. She dips her ﬁ  ngers into a water jug to seal the charcoal when she’s satis-ﬁ  ed with an area.

Mad Scientist
Lily King, a 21-year-old UF drawing senior, draws anatomical ﬁ  gures she saw in various medical textbooks. She uses a micron pen to illustrate her mad scientist collages, and her work “Contained” will be featured in Fri-day’s exhibition.

They work with their hands — 10 
ﬁ  ngers smudging, scraping, ﬁ  ling and 
brushing some of their last marks as UF students. These drawing seniors, gradu-ating this Spring from the College of Fine 
Arts, are joining together before they de-
part, pooling their pieces for an art exhi-bition.
As part of their senior projects, the 
artists are supposed to present an indi-vidual gallery by the end of the semester for people to see. On Friday from 7 to 9 p.m., the WAR-
Phaus Gallery, located at 534 SW Fourth Ave., will host the exhibit “Teaser: An Advanced Drawing Group Exhibition.”
“Teaser” is a preview show, which 
aims to get the community excited for the  individual galleries in April. The exhibit 
will run until Feb. 6.
Marla Rosen, the 21-year-old UF 
sculpture senior who is curating the ex-
hibition, said this teaser is somewhat of a tradition in the college. It also provides an avenue for the artists who haven’t shown their work in a gallery to get ad-ditional experience.Each senior in the exhibition is bring-
ing one piece to the preview exhibit, and Rosen is providing zines with an artist Q&A so visitors can ﬂ  ip through them and get a better understanding of the work presented.
Zac Thompson, a 21-year-old UF 
drawing senior in the show, said the exhibition unofﬁ  cially coincides with Art Walk Gainesville. And although the show includes only drawing majors, it’s not a themed show.
“All of our work is really different,” 
he said. “There should be something there for everyone.”

When it comes to Super Bowl Sunday, food is 
more important than football. 
There. We said it. We’ll give the fans — dare we say, Super fans 
— a moment to digest that fact. Having a quality 
menu for your Super Bowl party is crucial to the 
game experience when the Denver Broncos meet the Seattle Seahawks in Super Bowl XLVIII on Sunday. To help with your preparations, we’ve put together a menu that will not only pay hom-age to both teams’ cities  but also keep your guests full.
DrinksDenver and Seattle are both 
renowned for their microbrew-eries, so check out Gator Bever-age, Dorn’s and other micro-breweries in Gainesville for the best in local craft beer. If beer isn’t your drink of choice, stop by Starbucks and grab some coffee. Starbucks sold its ﬁ  rst cup of coffee from the Pike Place Market in Seattle, and with the Seahawks repre-
senting the NFC in the title game, it’s the perfect 
excuse to go for more caffeine.
Appetizers
Chili is classic Super Bowl fare for a reason. 
It’s relatively cheap, easy to make and goes great 
with beer and soda. Splurge on a can of green chili, a famous Denver food Mayor Michael Han-cock wagered in a Super Bowl bet with Seattle Mayor Ed Murray. Even if Denver loses, having leftovers for the rest of the week will take away a little bit of the pain. Serve it with chips and pretzels to munch on before the main meal.
Main courseNo Super Bowl party is complete without 
burgers and hot dogs. Add a Seattle twist to 
your hot dogs by replacing ketchup and mus-
tard with some cream cheese and grilled onions. Broncos’ fans can salute their rivals by serving the Denver sandwich, an omelet with ham, on-ions, green peppers and scrambled eggs served between two pieces of toast. Don’t feel like cooking? Order burritos from Chipotle, which opened its ﬁ  rst restaurant in Denver in 1993.
Desserts
You can’t go wrong with a bowl of M&M’S or 
a tray of brownies to ﬁ  nish off your Super Bowl 
menu. If you’re looking for something a little more substantial, stop by Publix or Trader Joe’s and pick up an apple pie. Not only is Washing-ton responsible for producing 10 to 12 billion ap-ples a year, but apple pie and the Super Bowl are two great American traditions. It seems a shame not to enjoy them together.Dishes to kick off 
your Super BowlTHURSDAY, JANUARY 30, 2014 � ALLIGATOR, 9

“I’m a girl, but I’m not 21. What are good old-
fashioned ways to have fun without drinking?”
— AnonymousI do not know the answer to that because nothing is more fun than drowning 
myself in tequila. So, instead of giving you options without drinking, because that reality sounds 
really s****y, here are some ways to have good, old-fashioned fun with your friends and not be the lame underage kid. 
1. Get a fake. They’re actually depressingly easy to come by in Gainesville. 
2. Be the designated driver. No, you won’t be drinking, but you will be able to watch all of your 
friends act like total idiots, which is never a bad time. 
3. Get super up close and personal with the bouncers of your friends’ favorite bars. Use the barter 
system: Free boob grabs for free entry (or entry at all, because you’re a young’un). 
4. Visit the club bathroom with your friends often. Sharing a stall to sneak sips is something every 
underage guy wishes he could do, so take advantage of it. Every gulp counts.GatoraidLAUREN CRAWFORD

The Grammy Awards brought 
some of music’s biggest stars to-
gether to sing, dance and get a little 
funky — emphasis on the last part.
Beyonce and Jay-Z, the world’s 
biggest power couple, kicked off the 
show with a simple but super sexy 
performance of “Drunk In Love.” 
People were fanning themselves after that opening — and not just because of all that smoke. Seriously, Bey could’ve gotten lost in there.
The dynamic duo also won some 
hardware — Jay-Z took home Best Rap/Sung Collaboration, sweetly thanking the Mrs. and telling his 
daughter Blue that “Daddy got a 
gold sippy cup for you.”
Pop divas took over the stage 
early on in the night. Katy Perry gave a sultry, witchcraft-decorated 
performance of “Dark Horse,” while 
Taylor Swift went softer with “All Too Well.” Pink absolutely owned the arena with an aerial routine to 
“Try” followed by her duet with 
fun.’s Nate Ruess, “Just Give Me A Reason.”  
But the biggest diva of the night 
was Lorde, making her Grammy de-
but with her smash “Royals.” Also 
making their debut were Lorde’s spectacularly terrifying claw nails 
— girl could shred somebody with those. She also won Best Pop Solo 
Performance and Song of the Year.
Best New Artist winners Mack-
lemore and Ryan Lewis performed 
“Same Love,” and they brough 33 
couples together to get married, as officiated by Queen Latifah.
The biggest draw of the night 
came from the collection of big time 
collaborations.  Robin Thicke per-
formed with Chicago, which was weird, but it kind of worked. Me-tallica and pianist Lang Lang came 
together for a hybrid rendition of 
“One.” 
In what is easily the most badass 
performance of the night, Imagine Dragons and Kendrick Lamar sent 
the crowd — and the scrambling 
cameramen — into a frenzy. The rock/hip-hop combo brought a much-needed energy explosion to a 
night full of ballads. 
Icons Paul McCartney and Ringo 
Starr also shared the stage to per-
form “Queenie Eye” from McCart-ney’s latest album, “New.” 
Big winners of the night included 
Bruno Mars for Best Pop Vocal Al-bum and Daft Punk feat. Pharrell Williams, AKA Smokey the Bear,  
for both Record and Album of the 
Year. Daft Punk performed “Get Lucky” later on in the night with a surprise appearance from Stevie 
Wonder. But the best part? The jam sesh literally got the entire crowd on 
its feet dancing — Jay-Z, Beyonce, Paul McCartney, Yoko Ono and Ste-ven Tyler were all showing off their 
sickest moves in one of the best mo-ments of the night.
The supergroup of Nine Inch 
Nails, Queens of the Stone Age, 
Dave Grohl and Lindsey Bucking-
ham closed the show out with a me-gamix of rock and roll tracks — 15 
minutes over time and got cut off by the credits. Regardless, another year of the Grammys closed out an inter-
esting year in music.

Chris Walker has finally been freed.
The NCAA announced Wednesday 
that it will clear the freshman forward 
after a 12-game suspension for No. 3 
Florida’s matchup against Missouri on Tuesday at 9 p.m. in the O’Connell Center.
Since enrolling at UF on Dec. 14, 
2013, after missing the fall semester due to academic eligibility issues, Walker will finish out his 12-game suspen-sion — encompassing 40 percent of the 2013-14 season — because he received preferential treatment from five people, including two agents, the NCAA said in a statement Wednesday afternoon.
The impermissible benefits he re-
ceived while he was a high school pros-
pect ranged from free cell phones and 
service, airfare, lodging, meals and ap-parel. Individuals close to Walker also received airfare and lodging for nine different trips — eight related to Walk-er’s non-scholastic basketball team 
competitions, the statement said.
Walker will be required to donate 
the $270 he received from agents to a 
charity of his choice, according to the NCAA. He must also serve 80 hours of community service as retribution for 
his other received benefits.
According to the NCAA’s state-
ment, UF filed for Walker’s reinstate-ment on Jan. 21 and then worked with

After a tough outing on the No. 1 court against 
Harvard on Sunday, Olivia Janowicz proved she is 
worthy of the top spot on Wednesday.
The Florida 
senior was the first to finish her singles match in 
the Perry Indoor Tennis Facility, defeating Central Florida’s Josephine Haraldson in straight sets (6-3, 6-0) on the top court while the No. 2 Gators swept the Knights 7-0.
“I know I played really well today. I didn’t 
play as well against Harvard and I learned from that,” Janowicz said. “Every player that’s played their first time on Court 1 has had some nerves, and (coach Roland Thornqvist) said it was normal. 
And I knew once I got through that first win, I’d 
be good.”
Thornqvist was pleased with how Janowicz per-
formed in her second attempt at the No. 1 spot.
“She looked so much more comfortable now,” 
he said. 
“I think the No. 1 ghost got her a little bit this 
weekend, just like it did Alex [Cercone on Satur-day], but [Wednesday], both of them looked super 
sharp. They know they belong here. They’ve paid 
their dues and they’re playing at that level, so once they settle down and sort of let the game come to them, they’ll do better.”
In doubles, Thornqvist composed all three of 
his duos of a freshman and a senior while sopho-more Brianna Morgan had a day off.
“They played great,” Thornqvist said. “We 
played at a much higher level today than we did 
this weekend, and it looked like we were more Senior leads UF

National Signing Day is just six days away, and Florida’s 
2014 recruiting class currently has 21 commits. With only 
four scholarships remaining for the class, Florida hopes to fill 
one of the open spots with five-star offensive tackle Damian 
Prince. 
Prince, who hails from Forestville (Md.) Bishop McNa-
mara High, will be taking his official visit to Florida this 
weekend. Prince is also considering Maryland, which he vis-ited in November 2013. 
Social media, year-round coverage of 
recruiting and the pressure put on young prospects can often affect the recruiting 
process. But Bishop McNamara coach Keith Goganious said Prince has handled the madness of the process well. 
“I think he is mature enough and fo-
cused enough to understand that he’s in 
this particular situation because of hard work,” Goganious said. “He has the opportunity to do something that he’s al-ways dreamed about — being able to go to school and get a good education and play football at some of the best college towns in the country.”
Prince’s hometown, Forestville, is only 20 minutes outside 
of the Maryland campus. The Terrapins are moving from the Atlantic Coast Conference to the Big Ten Conference in 2014. The Big Ten has been a hot bed for producing talented of-
fensive linemen, but Goganious says staying close to home is 
not the only thing factoring into Prince’s decision.

UF center“It’s close to home, obviously,” 
Goganious said. 
“The thing about it is he wants 
to be able to compete going into 
any school that he goes to. I think the opportunity to play right away entices him, and I think also the 
opportunity to be a contributor 
to the team is something that he’s looking for.”
Prince could get the opportuni-
ty to contribute early if he chooses 
UF. 
The Gators return just five of-
fensive linemen with starting ex-
perience in 2014. They have four 
offensive linemen in their current 
class, including JUCO transfer Drew Sarvary. Florida is moving from a pro-style offense to an up-tempo, spread scheme. 
In accordance with the new of-
fensive style, the Gators hired new offensive coordinator Kurt Roper from Duke and new offensive-line coach Mike Summers from USC 
during the offseason. 
Goganious said Prince is look-
ing forward to getting familiar 
with the coaching staff and get-ting a feel for where the program is 
headed after an injury-plagued 4-8 
season during the visit.
“He’s going in and seeing where 
the new offensive-line coach is, his techniques and the stuff he teaches (and) how can he make him a bet-ter player,” Goganious said. 
“He’s also going and seeing the 
direction that the program is going, and I’m pretty sure if it’s a win-win type of thing and he feels comfort-
able, then it’ll give him some more 
leverage in trying to make a deci-sion on what he wants to do.”
Goganious stressed the impor-
tance of Prince getting an opportu-
nity to get reps early. Maryland’s 
depth chart along the offensive line featured just one senior. 
Florida has plenty of room 
along the line for Prince. The Bish-op McNamara coach said Prince has both on- and off-the-field as-sets that will translate well to the college level.
“He’s very a very athletic guy 
for his size, runs very well,” Go-ganious said. “He’ll work on get-ting strength and all that stuff, that’s just part of the transition 
from high school to college. I think 
his upswing is so great. He’s just a great personable person to be around, a team-oriented guy.”
Prince will make his decision on 
where to attend school on National Signing Day on Wednesday, just three days after his official visit to 
Gainesville.Prince would add

Olivia Janowicz hits the ball during Florida’s 4-0 win against Harvard on Sunday at the Ring Tennis Complex. Janowicz 
won her first match on the No. 1 court on Wednesday, defeating UCF’s Josephine Haraldson in straight sets.
Gators won third 
straight doubles point
comfortable competing and playing matches.”
Janowicz paired up with freshman Kourtney Keegan for 
the fourth time this season, and the tandem topped UCF’s 
Caroline Eberhart and Annika Hepp 6-1.
“We both enjoy playing together,” Keegan said. “We have 
a great time. We mesh really well and it turned out pretty 
well.”
Cercone and freshman Stefani Stojic clinched the doubles 
point for the Gators (3-0) after defeating the Knights (1-1) pair of Josephine Haraldson and Clare Mendell 6-1.
Even though Florida swept all six singles matches and 
only gave up 13 games in 12 combined sets, the matches were closer than they seemed.
“In the beginning, we had a lot of deuces, some pretty 
long games,” senior Sofie Oyen said. “It’s always good to win 
those long games, and it’s good for my confidence. I got into 
the match after those.”
Added Thornqvist: “I thought we were outstanding be-
cause Central Florida played really well and we just didn’t 
give them any opportunities to get back in the matches.”tenniS , from page 14

the NCAA to gather the facts before its decision 
Wednesday.
“We’re glad there’s a resolution for everyone 
involved, especially for Chris,” coach Billy Dono-van said in a school release. “We appreciate every-one’s participation in this process and are ready to move forward.”
Added Walker in the release: “I appreciate 
all the support from UF, coach Donovan and my teammates, and I’m looking forward to helping the team any way I can.”
When asked about Walker on Monday, Dono-
van’s demeanor seemed more optimistic than usual, pointing to the belief that progress was be-ing made with the situation. But during previous 
weeks, the situation had been a sensitive topic be-
tween Donovan and the media.
On Jan. 21, the day after Orlando’s WFTV 
sports anchor Christian Bruey incorrectly reported 
that Walker would be cleared following Florida’s 
game against Alabama last Thursday, Donovan told reporters to “just listen to us and our school” when pertaining to Walker’s status.
“I’m not going to address it anymore,” he 
said.
Two days later, Donovan began his interview 
with the media by remarking, “No update on 
Chris Walker,” before any reporter asked a ques-
tion.
The situation even became a small distraction 
during home contests. Florida fans have chanted “Free Chris Walker” before and during game 
action. The Gators’ matchup on Tuesday night 
against the Tigers figures to see an even more raucous atmosphere in the O’Connell Center with Walker playing his first game as a Gator.
Before Walker’s much-hyped debut, No. 3 Flor-
ida (17-2, 6-0 SEC) will play without him when it faces Mississippi State in Starkville, Miss., tonight at 7 and hosts Texas A&M on Saturday at 4 p.m.
But after 46 days of waiting in limbo while the 
NCAA reviewed his eligibility, Walker finally knows his fate with the team. 
Donovan said Monday that he would immedi-
ately play Walker, the No. 6 recruit in the Class of 2013 according to Rivals.com, if the Bonifay native were cleared. During the NCAA’s investigation, the 6-foot-10 Walker has practiced with the team.
“He’s playing well and he’s doing well,” Don-
ovan said Monday. “We’ll keep him out there.”
Despite missing a fair share of practice in the 
fall and having to play catch-up, Walker has earned praise from his teammates, who have been 
impressed with his freakish athleticism and will-
ingness to learn. Since arriving at UF weighing 203 pounds, Walker has gained about 7-10 pounds in more than six weeks.
Many Florida fans have envisioned Walker as 
the No. 3 Gators’ top talent, but Donovan has re-peatedly told them to temper their expectations of Walker, who goes by the nickname “Skywalker.”
Walker should come off the bench and join a 
frontcourt rotation of forwards Casey Prather, 
Will Yeguete, Dorian Finney-Smith and center 
Patric Young.
“My biggest fear for Chris is you have a highly 
explosive player and sometimes when the guy’s 
not playing, the legend of Chris Walker grows 
greater than who he really actually is, you know,” Donovan said Monday.
“It’s like, ‘My God, this guy is going to end up 
being Kevin Garnett.’ I mean, he’s not that. And I think if anybody, whenever he gets able to play, if that’s your expectation of Chris Walker, then you’re going to be very, very disappointed be-cause he’s not that.
“I hope that there is at least a level of under-
standing in terms of how much he’s missed com-ing in to where he’s coming in, and if anybody’s expecting him to be a savior, it would really be 
unfair.”wAlker , from page 14“I thought we were outstanding because Central 
Florida played really well and we just didn’t give 
them any opportunities to get back in the matches.”

The surging Crimson Tide is 
rolling into the O’Connell Center 
tonight.
Coming off two hard-fought 
Southeastern Conference victories 
over No. 13 Kentucky and Georgia, 
Alabama and its momentum offer a tough challenge for Florida. 
The Gators will again ﬁ  nd 
themselves on the short end of the height scale, but they are virtually even with the Tide with respect to rebounding. Florida averages 37.6 boards per contest, while Alabama 
averages 37.8. 
“Our goal, rebounding-wise, is 
to neutralize that,” coach Amanda 
Butler said. “It’s something that we don’t feel like we’re weak at, but it’s maybe not a strength ei-ther.”
The same could be said for 
Alabama. Both the Gators and the 
Crimson Tide are outrebounded, 
on average, per game this season. But does that mean each team’s re-bounding effort will neutralize the other’s?
“Not necessarily,” Butler said. 
“That’s what we’re watching and understanding. It’s not all about heights and being similar posi-tionally. They’ve got some kids that are playing really well. Fresh-man of the week Ashley Williams, she’s playing with a ton of heart, a ton of ﬁ  re. That’s what a whole lot of rebounding is. Once you take [6-foot-6] versus 6-foot out of it, what bridges the gap is how hard you’re going to go.”
Florida is hoping for a repeat 
performance from its last game against Auburn — Alabama’s no-torious intrastate rival — in which 
it scored 87 points and went 6 of 
12 from beyond the arc in the ﬁ  rst half. 
However, defense remains the 
top priority for Butler. 
“They’re a team that is very, 
very capable of scoring a lot of points,” she said. “We matchup with each other pretty well. De-
fense is going to factor into the 
game plan probably more, per-centage wise, than offense.”
Just because Alabama is ca-
pable of scoring points does not necessarily mean that it does. Ala-bama is last in the SEC in scoring offense, averaging only 65.8 points per game. Florida’s 78.1 per con-
test is good for fourth best in the 
SEC. However, the Tide allows 69.6 points per contest, while the Gators give up 70.1 — 12th and 13th in the conference, respec-tively. 
“They play a lot of zone, and 
we’re going to be at home,” But-ler said. “Those are two factors 
that we have to make important. 
Alabama’s playing great ball right now. By beating Kentucky at Ken-tucky and then beating Georgia, they’re probably playing as con-ﬁ  dently as anyone in the league right now.”
Because of Alabama’s momen-
tum, the fact that Florida plays at home might be the most crucial 
factor for the Gators’ success to-
night.
“I think their place is incredibly 
hard to play in,” Butler said of Al-abama’s Foster Auditorium. “It’s a very unique building, there’s no other arena like it in the confer-ence. They play very, very well there. I’m very happy that we’re at 
home on Thursday.”
Tonight’s game offers a very 
realistic opportunity for Florida 
to outrebound its opponent. Al-though the Gators have the worst rebounding margin in the SEC (-3.7), the Crimson Tide is a not-much-better 13th in the conference with a margin of -1.9. Florida and 
Alabama are the only schools in 
the SEC with negative rebounding margins. 
“We want to neutralize (the 
rebounding battle) because that’s just the way we play best,” But-ler said. “Is it a rebounding war I think we can win? I do think that we can, but they can just as easily 
win it as well, and we can’t let that 
be a factor.”

A dislocated arm and torn labrum knocked Marquis 
Dendy out of competition last year, and the junior under-
went surgery in September 2013. 
But after months of recovery, Dendy is back and will 
make his season debut this weekend when the UF track and ﬁ  eld team travels to Fayetteville, Ark., for the Razor-back Invitational. 
“I leave my past behind me, and that is one thing my 
dad always tells me to do,” Dendy said. “Right now, I have no marks and no stats for this year, so what I have to (do) is earn all that stuff back.”
Dendy hopes this is the start of another decorated sea-son to add to a career full of honors.
Last year, he earned the NCAA title 
in the long jump, the 2013 Southeastern Conference Men’s Field Athlete of the Year award and the USTFCCCA South Region’s Men’s Field Athlete of the Year award.
Dendy considers the indoor season as 
only a warm-up for outdoor. 
This ﬁ  rst meet of the season will help prepare him 
for the SEC Indoor Championships and carry him to the NCAA Indoor Championships in March.
Throughout weekly practices leading up to the week-
end meet, Dendy has organized himself differently in training for meets. “I’ve been doing stuff like landing on a mat or trying 
to land in a foam pit in the O’Dome,” Dendy said. “Get-ting my sprint speed, running the 60(m) and doing a lot of sprints and taking care of my body. I ran myself into shape a lot and taking care of legs, and other than my arm, my body feels 110 percent.”
After leaping to a world-leading long jump at last 
springs’ SEC Indoor Championships in Fayetteville, Dendy wants to live up to coach Mike Holloway’s high expectations for him.
“I don’t shy from any type of expectations,” Dendy 
said. 
“Can’t is not in my vocabulary, when he says I need 
these points, I need you to do this for me I’m going to do it.” Junior returning from injury after decorated 2013 campaign
