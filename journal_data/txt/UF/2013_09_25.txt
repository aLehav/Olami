As regionally brewed beer 
continues to grow in popu-
larity across the nation, the 
Gainesville area has seen its 
share of success locally.
The craft beer industry in 
the U.S. lept from 1,970 craft 
beer breweries in 2011 to 2,483 
breweries this year, according to data from the Brewers As-sociation.
In keeping with the trend, 
downtown Ocala’s third an-nual Craftoberfest is set for next month, which will feature more than 100 beers.
Brandon Nappy, Swamp 
Head Brewery’s marketing 
manager, said he thinks the 
spike in craft beers can be linked to people paying more attention to what they’re drinking.
“People are paying more at-
tention to what’s in their glass,” he said. “They are paying atten-tion to the product, how it tastes and the whole experience.”
As for the craft beer market 
growing beyond its demand, Nappy said he thinks there is plenty of room to grow because 
there is a time and place for ev-
ery kind of beer.
“I don’t think that people 
will go back to liking ﬂ  avorless, light lager,” he said. “We all 
like lighter, lower-alcohol, easy-drinking beer during a tailgate. 
But for the most part, the main reason craft beer is growing is because people are learning to 
like the real ﬂ  avors of different 
types of beers.”
Lindsey Graetz, a 21-year-
old UF recreation, parks and tourism junior who ﬁ  rst tried 
craft beer at World of Beer in 
Jonesville, agreed. She attri-butes the recent upward trend of new breweries and more 
consumer interest in craft beer 
to the quality of local brews.
“People are willing to spend 
more and enjoy themselves,” she said.”
Steve Smith, product man-
ager at World of Beer, has seen local loyalty to craft beer ﬁ  rst-hand. He’s been in the beer busi-
ness for 12 years, and he said it 
has grown exponentially.
“Our best events always re-
volve around Florida beers be-cause people are really excited 
about them,” he said.
Smith also said beer drink-
ers should stay on the lookout 
because Florida is quickly be-
coming a new home for brew-
eries.
Graetz said the best part of 
local craft beer is that the people behind the beer are personable.
“They share the same inter-
ests,” she said. “They love the Gators. They aren’t some CEO in a factory.”VOLUME 108 ISSUE 25 WWW.ALLIGATOR.ORG WEDNESDAY, SEPTEMBER 25, 2013

The answer to “What Would Ryan Lochte Do?” after star-
ring in a TV series appears to be promoting frozen yogurt ﬂ  a-
vors for charity.
The 11-time Olympic medalist is partnering with Yogurtol-
ogy to raise money for charities he’s been supporting during the past few years, including the Mac Crutchﬁ  eld Foundation and Parent Project Muscular Dystrophy.
Lochte is promoting two new ﬂ  avors — 
Lochte Lemon Drop and Champion Choco-
late Fudge Brownie — that will launch Sat-
urday and will be available in store, 3730 SW Archer Road, for a six-month period.
From the proceeds of the ﬂ  avors, Yogur-
tology has pledged to give at least $10,000 to each of Lochte’s charities.
Jenn Greacen, a Yogurtology spokeswoman, said the part-
nership between Lochte and Yogurtology will both pique cus-tomers’ interest and cater to the needs of the charities.
“We think it will approach a new audience who want to 
give themselves a treat or take their kids out for a sweet treat, 
knowing that it’s going back to support something,” she said.
Will Nolan, a spokesman for Parent Project Muscular Dys-
trophy — one of the charities that will receive funds from the 
partnership — said the awareness Lochte’s name recognition 
will provide is important.
“If they see signage that Yogurtology puts out that’s sup-
porting PPMD and then take a second to look it up, hopefully Ryan Lochte to put the freeze on Gainesville yogurt for charity

University Police arrested a UF student Monday 
night after receiving reports that he made a bomb threat 
during a community service fraternity’s rush event.
According to a UPD report, ofﬁ  cers charged 19-year-
old Carson Ridenhour with threatening to discharge a 
destructive device — a second-degree felony. Ofﬁ  cers 
searched his dorm but did not ﬁ  nd any evidence of im-portance to the case.  Monday evening, ofﬁ  cers responded to the Alpha 
Phi Omega coed service fraternity’s information booth near Turlington Plaza after fraternity members reported that a student made threatening remarks several days 
earlier.
A fraternity member explained to ofﬁ  cers that he in-
terviewed Ridenhour on Sept. 17 at a rush event in the 
Rion Ballroom, according to the report.
The member said he asked Ridenhour why he was 
rushing again after he previously didn’t get a bid. Riden-hour answered, “I have resentment from not getting in UF student threatens fraternityLocals tapping

� THE AD INCREASED SITE 
TRAFFIC.
MARY FRANCIS
Alligator Contributing Writer
A local startup piloted by two UF 
alumni screened its ﬁ  rst national TV 
ad on the DIY Network last week.
Fracture — a digital imaging 
company that prints photos onto 
glass — was picked up by ad agency 
Sandwich Video, which has pro-duced ads for companies like eBay, Zipcar, Yahoo and Square.
Fracture co-founder Abhi Lokesh 
said his team reached out to Sand-wich Video, which is recognized in startup culture for making impact-ing ads.
Last year, Fracture was featured 
on a DIY show, and the exposure generated positive feedback, Lokesh said. That’s why the company de-cided to create an ad for the station, and so far, he said, it’s working.
“It’s still preliminary, and we 
don’t want to jump the gun, but 
trafﬁ  c to the site has gone up, and 
orders are already coming in at a higher pace,” Lokesh said.
Fracture’s marketing director, 
Kay Mitchell, said the video was aimed at showing the personal side of Fracture prints.
“We wanted to show people 
what it was like to hold a Fracture 
and the emotional value of our proj-
ect,” Mitchell said.
The ad depicts a man snapping 
photos at various locations, ordering Fracture prints of them and hanging the prints on his walls.
UF alumna Kelsey Reese, who 
helped choose a design for Fracture prints at her magazine internship, 
said people have responded posi-
tively to the prints, and she thinks the commercial will work well.
“The DIY Network is a good ﬁ  t 
for them,” Reese said.Startup ad carves way

Students and residents will pound the 
pavement Saturday during an event to beneﬁ  t 
children with dietary disorders.
Organized by registered dietitian and UF 
alumna Lindsay Raub, the Children Over-
coming Rare Disorders half marathon/5K will 
help fund UF’s pediatric Division of Genetics and Metabolism. Proceeds will go toward pro-grams to help children and their families learn to live with their dietary needs.
The race begins at 7:30 a.m. on the UF Cul-
tural Plaza parking lot. Anyone can register online at www.chordrace.kintera.org or before the race Saturday morning. The entry fee for the half marathon is $40 and $35 for the 5K.
“These kids require extensive dietary 
work and nutrition management,” Raub said. 
“Cooking demonstrations and nutrition edu-
cation is the only treatment for these individu-als because it’s teaching them lifelong habits.”
Raub said her colleague, who has been 
working in the department for more than 30 years, has been paying out of pocket.
“I know races from being a runner, and 
I thought this would be a great way to raise money,” she said.
Loren Whyte, a registered dietitian, said 
she is running the race in support of programs like cooking demonstrations.
“You get to run around Lake Alice, then 
up Fraternity Row, through the Swamp and down past Century Tower,” Raub said. “Then you get to go on 13th Street, where you’ll see the double helix bridge, then also pass Shands and our medical plaza, where we see our pa-
tients, and back to Lake Alice.”
Currently, 170 runners are registered, and 
more than half are in the half marathon, Raub said. She said she thinks they will raise be-
tween $8,000 and $9,000.
UF pediatric genetic counselor Laura C. 
Fairbrother said it should end at about 11 
a.m.
“We will have an award ceremony where 
we will give awards for the fastest runners and 
the people who raised the most money,” Fair-brother said. “We plan on having some of our patients there for families to talk to, as well as tents and tables from some of our sponsors.”
Raub said she hopes to raise awareness not 
only for her division but also for the patients 
who have obstacles ahead of them.
“It’s just nice that we won’t have to scrap 
pennies to get what they need,” Raub said.Weekend race to raise money for children with dietary needs

ABOUT 1,000 STUDENTS EACH YEAR.

Sigma Alpha Epsilon has become the 
first fraternity to partner with national or-
ganization the Jed Foundation to promote mental health and suicide prevention at universities across the country — includ-
ing through the fraternity’s UF chapter.
The partnership, which launched this 
month, will include training to help frater-
nity members spot symptoms of potential suicide victims, said John MacPhee, execu-tive director of the Jed Foundation.The foundation works with college stu-
dents to promote emotional health and suicide prevention among its nearly 14,000 collegiate members, he said.
“We reached out to SAE some months 
ago and started a conversation about how 
we might be able to work together in the 
interest of promoting a combined initia-tive,” MacPhee said.
Brandon Weghorst, the associate execu-
tive director of communications for Sigma Alpha Epsilon, said the initiative’s goal hits close to home.
“Unfortunately, several of our mem-
bers have taken their lives over the past decade,” Weghorst said. “Our goal is to give our members, advisers and staff the training and resources to understand how 
mental health issues may affect our mem-
bership.”
The first step to suicide prevention, 
MacPhee said, is to trust and act on your instincts.
It’s a conversation that Linda Lewis, a 
mental health counselor at UF’s Counsel-ing and Wellness Center, said is worth be-ing proactive about.
Being straightforward with someone 
will encourage a more open dialogue to address concerns about a friend’s mental health, she said.“To come out and say ‘Are you thinking 
of killing yourself?’ sometimes is the ap-propriate thing to say,” Lewis said. “The person might lie, of course, but at least you’ve opened the door to talk about it.”
The Jed Foundation is discussing the 
possibility of further partnerships with other fraternities and sororities, but Sigma Alpha Epsilon responded to the organiza-tion’s proposal first, MacPhee said.
According to New York’s Office of 
Mental Health, suicide is the second lead-ing cause of death among college students, following accidents. 
College students are estimated to have 
a suicide rate of almost eight per 100,000. At this rate, suicide is estimated to take about 1,100 students each year, according to the office.

The last Student Senate meeting 
before Student Government Fall 
elections next week ended the current 
legislative session with a dull roar.
The Senate proceeded on schedule 
Tuesday night after barely making 
quorum with 56 senators present out 
of a total 100. In order to start official 
business during the meeting, quorum 
must be met.  
In the wake of midterm exams, a 
case of Business Finance exam claimed 
half the seats in the Senate chambers.
Sen. Daniella Saetta, Students 
Party president, said exams, rain and 
errands resulted in her party’s low 
attendance.
“It’s bound to happen with such a 
little caucus,” she said.
The Senate passed allocations bills 
granting funding to Pride Student Union’s trip to the oSTEM conference and the Virgil Hawkins Pre-Law 
Society. 
It also unanimously approved 
Student Body President Christina 
Bonarrigo’s appointment of Bianca 
Lurate as executive athletics and recreation secretary and a Senate crash course on how to be more LGBTQ-sensitive.
A brief debate preceded the 
Senate’s unanimous approval for a reserve transfer of $20,000 to SG for an updated campus Veterans Memorial. 
After the meeting, Swamp Party 
member Davis Bean and Joseph Michaels held an impromptu gathering for their members in the UF College of Law courtyard.
Bean called senator attendance 
both in the Senate and at senator-sponsored events “abysmal.”
“We were the party that had a 
presence today,” Michaels said. Student Senate does little 
at last pre-election meeting
the first time, and I want to destroy you guys from 
the inside,” according to the report.
The member then asked how he would get back 
at the fraternity. Ridenhour replied, “by planting a bomb at chapter.”  
Another fraternity member, who spoke to 
Ridenhour directly after he made the threatening remarks, asked if he liked to prank people. Riden-hour answered that he didn’t like to prank people but said he liked to deceive people, according to the report.
A third brother came forward and referenced a 
Facebook message conversation between she and another member, who was a close friend of Riden-
hour. In the conversation, the member said she was 
concerned the fraternity hadn’t accepted Riden-hour’s bid because “he can be a very unstable per-son,” according to the report.
The third brother also referred to her conversa-
tion with Ridenhour at the event, where she asked him to describe himself in three words. Ridenhour said something to the effect that he’s not a good per-son, according to the report. He also said he “helps for the sake of helping” and is “intelligent, confi-dent and focuses on doing right by others.”
After speaking to the members, officers and a de-
tective drove to Ridenhour’s North Hall residence dorm room and took him to police headquarters for questioning, according to the report.
At the station, Ridenhour admitted to making 
the threat, and officers arrested him.
He was booked into the Alachua County Jail at 
about 2:30 a.m. Tuesday on the charge of threaten-ing to discharge a destructive device. He was later released at about 2:30 p.m. after meeting a $5,000 bond.
Ridenhour’s case wasn’t handled as a standard 
bomb threat case because threateners usually call 
in to say an explosive is already planted, said UPD 
Capt. Jeff Holcomb.
Police consulted with the state attorney’s office 
to determine how to charge Ridenhour, Holcomb said. Often when a student threatens an individual, the incident is treated as an assault. They decided on the bomb threat charge because Ridenhour spe-cifically spoke of using an explosive.
Ridenhour did not return calls for comment 
from the Alligator. The fraternity said it plans to re-lease a statement this week.He admitted to making the threatPublic opinion to improve
that’s something that’s going to help 
educate someone who otherwise might not have known,” he said.
Nolan said having a public fig-
ure on board with the nonprofit’s goals can positively impact public opinion.
“If it makes them that much 
more tolerant, that’s a huge thing for us,” he said.
Some UF students said that al-
though Lochte’s effort to raise mon-
ey for the charities is admirable, the 
positive boost it will give his public image could be an additional mo-tive for the partnership.Sarah Meyer, a 20-year-old UF 
biochemistry junior, said she hopes Lochte’s motivations are unselfish.
“I do think and hope Ryan 
Lochte has genuine intention in helping the charities, although I do think this partnership with Yogur-tology will simultaneously bring 
him more positive publicity,” she 
said. “I definitely would try the fla-vors to help the cause because de-spite the questionable motives, the 
money is still going towards a good 
cause.”
Melissa Blaue, a 20-year-old UF 
health education and behavior ju-nior, said she agreed with Meyer.
Blaue said although the cam-
paign will generate more personal publicity for Lochte, the charities will still benefit regardless.
“Overall, I think Ryan Lochte 
partnering with Yogurtology is a charitable effort and will bring in a lot of support and proceeds to his foundation,” she said.lochtE , from page 1StudEnt govErnmEnt

As the city moves toward establish-
ing a shelter for homeless residents at 
a former jail, a local nonproﬁ  t is plac-ing its bid to become manager of the operation.
The Alachua County Coalition for 
the Homeless and Hungry is in the process of asking the Gainesville City Commission for the chance to operate the planned Gainesville Community Innovation and Empowerment Cen-ter.
The center will be housed at the for-mer location of the Gainesville Correc-tional Institution at 2845 NE 39th Ave.
Theresa Lowe, the coalition’s execu-
tive director, said it has already estab-lished partnerships with organizations that can provide food and counseling.
“We hope to be more of a service 
provider and let our partners do what they do best,” Lowe said.
The city is committed to making the 
center a reality, said city spokesman Bob Woods. The project has a budget of about $150,000 for the ﬁ  rst year. 
He declined to comment on whether 
any other organizations are interested 
in operating the center.

In honor of Hispanic Heritage Month, the 
ﬁ  rst Hispanic to give a keynote speech at the 
Democratic National Convention spoke on 
campus Tuesday night about his career as a politician.
Sponsored by ACCENT Speaker’s Bureau, 
Julián Castro — the current mayor of San Antonio — spoke to about 200 people in the University Auditorium about seeing his fam-ily experience hardships due to their Hispanic ethnicity.
“I never thought of becoming a politician,” 
he said. “I thought it was a joke.”
However, he said he found he could make 
a change through politics.
Génesis Lara, 21, a UF history senior and executive director of this year’s Hispanic Heri-tage Month celebration, said she picked Cas-tro to speak at the event because he is a role 
model for minorities. She said she thought of 
having Cuban-American Sen. Marco Rubio  but did not because of Rubio’s stand on im-migration reform.
José Miranda, 21, a UF political science and 
international studies senior and president of the Hispanic Student Association, said Castro has been a spokesman for the Hispanic com-munity for years.
Castro is an immigration-reform supporter, 
and minorities can relate to him, she said. 
His parents migrated to America and had 
to struggle for Castro to get an education.
“Castro has deﬁ  ed the odds of immi-
grants,” Lara said. “ He never forgot where he came from.”At UF, Texas mayor discusses

helicopter but I do not want that anymore. Kids at school are still picking on Amber [my twin sister] and it is not fair because she does not do anything to them and it makes me mad. I prayed they would stop, but God is busy and I need 
your help. Is it against the rules to give up gifts early?”
To add salt to the wound, his sister suffers from mul-
tiple mental disorders.
Bullying-related suicides and ‘revenge’ shootings at 
schools shock our conscience. Florida, like other states, 
has enacted a tough anti-bullying law to reduce further tragedies.
The legal response to the bullying crisis reveals our re-
active cultural mindset. Instead of dealing with the core issue, we’re lazily patching up the symptom — which is better than nothing.
The root of bullying — a disregard for others’ emotions 
— pervades all our interactions, from kids to adults. The perceived innocence of childhood prevents us from mak-ing sense of this kind of meanness, leading the victims to self-destruction. For the rest of us, we accept that life is unfair and begrudgingly endure interpersonal cruelties. 
We escape the resulting inner sadness by seeking joy else-
where.
Past generations could never dream of the technologi-
cal sophistication we enjoy today: Realize, for example, 
that the processing power in our iPhones exceeds that of 
the Apollo moon missions. No longer are vast amounts of data restricted to the elite few — information equality governs the Internet.
Despite all this progress, we forgot how to be human.
Atheists write skillful critiques on the irrationality of 
organized religion while the faithful lament on airwaves 
about godlessness plaguing society. As advocates of some worldview or the other, we’ve become experts on intellec-tually destroying each other with polysyllabic posturing.But we somehow forgot how 
to be human.
“Compassion is the chief law 
of human existence,” wrote Fyo-dor Dostoyevsky. Our disregard for each other and perpetual neglect of moral truisms — e.g., 
“Do unto others as you would 
have them do unto you” — is wreaking societal havoc.
Take the recent case of the Alligator exposing UF’s rape 
culture and compelling readers to deal with homegrown sexual violence. As pursuers of a gentler world, let’s dig deeper.
The barbarity of rape is lost to many from my gender 
for whom objectifying women is perfectly normal. For many men, a young woman’s worth comes solely from her resemblance to a delicately sculpted chunk of ﬂ  esh. Once again, if we lived by the “treat others as you’d like 
to be treated” line, no self-respecting male could imagine 
reducing others to mere physicality.
Too many lives hang in jeopardy — from pledges at 
fraternities being publicly humiliated under the guise of fostering “brotherhood” to poor American families being 
cut off from food stamps by a callous Congress — for us to 
play the waiting game.
The solution lies within you and me. Compassion be-
gins with increasing empathy and kindness in our inter-
personal dealings and culminates in a nation guided by 
ethical policies.
Imagine the sorrow endured by Amber, the mentally 
ill schoolgirl. Her 8-year-old twin brother is begging Santa for help. The ball is in our court: If you and I decide to lead 
lives considerate of others’ feelings and pain, my faith in 
trickle-down ethics convinces me that little Amber won’t have to wait for Christmas.

when Christian Aguilar went missing? Today’s question: Are you tired of Ryan Lochte?Cheese-spiracy: 
The gov’t is behind 
our dairy obsession
Our national obsession with all things cheese — from 
pizza to Easy Mac to the yellow stuff on stadium 
nachos that forms a skin when not eaten right away 
— has ﬁ  nally caught up with us. On Tuesday, the Center for Science in the Public Interest published a report card grad-ing Americans on their eating habits. In the area of dairy, we 
scored an abysmal C-.
Although consumption of full-fat ice cream is down and 
consumption of yogurt is up, our cheese consumption has 
nearly tripled since the 1970s. Americans used to average eight pounds of cheese per person per year. Now, we’re up to 
23 pounds. Yep, 23 pounds of congealed stadium cheese per 
person. What a time to be alive.
We can attribute this unhealthy increase to a number of 
culprits — the rise of cheesy dips such as Moe’s queso, for ex-ample. However, the biggest inﬂ  uence on our whirlwind love affair with cheese is, believe it or not, the government.
In his 2010 New York Times article “While Warning About 
Fat, U.S. Pushes Cheese Sales,” Michael Moss relayed a story 
about how an organization called Dairy Management part-
nered with Domino’s Pizza to create a pizza with 40 percent 
more cheese after the pizza conglomerate suffered a dip in 
sales.
Moss, the Pulitzer Prize-winning investigative journalist 
behind “Salt Sugar Fat: How the Food Giants Hooked Us,” said the sneaky increase in cheese resulted in skyrocketing 
sales.
However, one slice of the cheesier pizza constitutes more 
than two-thirds of a day’s maximum recommended daily 
amount of saturated fat.
Dairy Management is not a private business consultant, 
Moss wrote. The organization was created by the United 
States Department of Agriculture, and its purpose is to work 
with restaurants and food vendors to pump more cheese into 
their menu items.
“Urged on by government warnings about saturated fat, 
Americans have been moving toward low-fat milk for de-
cades, leaving a surplus of whole milk and milk fat,” Moss wrote. “Yet the government, through Dairy Management, is 
engaged in an effort to ﬁ  nd ways to get dairy back into Amer-
icans’ diets, primarily through cheese.”
How can the Department of Agriculture be both a “mar-
keter of agriculture products and America’s nutrition police,” 
as Moss put it? The two roles just don’t mix, like Sunny De-
light and Oreos.
This presents a horrible ethical dilemma, and it diminishes 
the messages from activists like Michelle Obama who are 
ﬁ  ghting to decrease America’s inﬂ  ated obesity rate. 
The Department of Agriculture’s Dairy Management is 
in bed with junk-food giants like Dominos, McDonald’s and 
Pizza Hut, and we’re willing to bet some kinky stuff goes on 
there — Cheez Whiz is probably involved.

opinions@alligator.org WEDNESDAY, SEPTEMBER 25, 2013  ALLIGATOR, 7
Last month, I wrote a column about Rep. 
Ted Yoho (R-Fla.), the congressman who represents Gainesville, and his support 
for cutting the Supplemental Nutrition As-sistance Program, more commonly known as food stamps. Yoho, along with 216 of his fellow House Republicans, displayed that support on 
Thursday when he voted to cut the SNAP pro-
gram by $40 billion over the next 10 years.
SNAP provides low-income, elderly and 
disabled Americans with monthly subsidies that help them put food on their tables. 
The average monthly SNAP beneﬁ  t was 
about $133 per person in 2012, small but criti-cal subsidies for the nearly 48 million Ameri-cans who currently receive them.
Many supporters of the SNAP cuts argue 
these spending reductions are designed to root out waste and abuse in the program. 
Rep. Tom Cotton (R-Ark.), who also voted 
for the cut to SNAP, said the bill would help 
“get the aid to those who need it most in their 
hour of need, without the kind of rampant waste and abuse that you see.”
However, experts on the SNAP program 
assert that the proposed cuts would have no impact on any waste or fraud in the system but would instead harm millions of Americans who rely on the program to purchase food.
The SNAP cuts proposed by House Repub-
licans would have devastating effects on mil-lions of low-income Americans. 
In 2014 alone, 2.1 million people from low-
income families would lose their SNAP ben-
eﬁ  ts, and their children would also lose access 
to the federally subsidized free school-lunch program. The adult members of these fami-lies are employed but are simply not earning enough income to afford food for themselves 
and their families.
The problem of employed Americans re-
lying on SNAP could be largely solved by 
increasing the minimum wage to a level that 
allows workers to provide for themselves and 
their families. 
Of course, raising the minimum wage is 
universally opposed by congressional Repub-licans.
If the supporters of SNAP cuts are truly 
concerned about waste and overspending in the budget, they might start with the massive subsidies the federal government is currently 
providing to large and highly proﬁ  table facto-ry farms and agribusi-
nesses.
Between 1995 and 
2010, farm subsidies averaged about $52 billion a year. Al-though this amounts 
to signiﬁ  cantly less 
than the $80 billion 
spent on SNAP in 2012, 75 percent of those subsidies went to just 4 percent of the busi-nesses, including large and proﬁ  table corpora-
tions like Archer Daniels Midland Company 
and Monsanto. 
In contrast to the beneﬁ  ts provided by 
SNAP, which go entirely to low-income Amer-
icans who cannot afford food on their own, 
these taxpayer dollars are being provided to massively proﬁ  table corporations that need no assistance from the government.
One explanation for the support in Con-
gress for cutting food stamps while allowing farm subsidies to grow is that some legislators beneﬁ  t directly from the farm subsidies. 
In 2012 alone, 15 members of Congress re-
ceived a total of about $238,000 in farm sub-sidies, including crop insurance and disaster relief payments.
The family of House Committee on Agricul-
ture chairman Frank Lucas (R-Okla.), which  
strongly supported the massive cuts to SNAP, 
has received more than $40,000 in farm subsi-dies from 1995 to 2012.
Fortunately for the millions of Americans 
who rely on SNAP, the bill passing by the House containing the SNAP cuts is considered dead on arrival in the Senate. 
Sen. Debbie Stabenow (D-Mich.), chairwom-
an of the Senate Committee on Agriculture, 
Nutrition and Forestry, called the bill passed 
by the House a “divisive, extremely partisan political exercise” that “is going nowhere.”
Providing massive government beneﬁ  ts to 
large corporations while millions of Ameri-cans go hungry is both immoral and harmful public policy. 
The support among Congressional Republi-
cans for cutting SNAP while maintaining cur-
rent levels of farm subsidies is shameful and 
unconscionable.

Every sitcom 
has a ﬂ  irta-tious male, a 
primary couple and 
characters in messy situations 
with fantastic apartments. But “The Mindy Project” and “New 
Girl,” which run back-to-back 
on Fox, take the same tropes in 
entirely different directions.
In both shows, the main 
character is a young, profes-
sional, single woman with a 
college education and a pen-
chant for awkward situations. 
Her love interests are a series of gorgeous white men with great 
smiles, and she is unlucky with 
almost all of them because she 
has insane amounts of sexual 
tension with the angry-but-sexy guy friend.
“New Girl” highlights the 
actors’ talents with slapstick 
comedy and jokes about rela-
tionships. The characters are stereotyped. The writers built 
satires, not people.
Jess is positive. Nick is gruff. 
Schmidt is, well, Schmidt.
The downside is that the 
writers depend on Zooey De-
schanel remaining quirky. The most notable example is season 2’s “Parents,” in which Jess tries to “Parent Trap” her divorced 
mom and dad back together. 
This woman is 30 years old. No 
amount of adorability should make this an acceptable plot line.
“The Mindy Project” treats 
its characters like people. The viewer sees Mindy for her wants, her desires and her hope-ful cynicism. She is, in many ways, the viewer. But “The Mindy Project” isn’t 
perfect. Just like “Parks and Recreation” did after the ﬁ  rst season, Kaling needs to listen to 
her critics and tweak the parts 
that are failing.
The secondary characters on 
Kaling’s show are not nearly as memorable as the ones in “New 
Girl,” despite the terriﬁ  c actors 
who play them. Viewers don’t 
know Morgan, Jeremy and 
Betsy outside of Mindy. There are too many fascinating minor 
characters — typically played 
by celebrities — to allow for 
character development to hap-
pen. The viewer doesn’t need to care about Seth Rogen or James 
Franco. They need to care about 
the regulars, and often they 
don’t because they are rarely 
given their own storylines. They exist solely to live around 
Mindy and say witty things.
It is unlikely “New Girl” will 
change its formula, because it 
has too many devoted viewers. Luckily, it’s not too late for “The Mindy Project” to reach perfec-tion. Get rid of the guest-star clutter, focus on the friendships and make it an ensemble piece. 
“New Girl” and “The Mindy 
Project” need to learn from each other or combine into one su-percharged lady-sitcom.

A myriad of minerals, dinosaur 
fossils, petrified wood, agatized 
coral and a 4.6-billion-year-old meteorite graced the debut of San-ta Fe College’s newest geological 
collection Tuesday afternoon.
The exhibit includes one of  
the largest collections of minerals 
in North Florida and one of the world’s largest collections of aga-tized coral.
It will be open to the public 
from 7:30 a.m. to 8 p.m. Monday through Saturday. In about two 
weeks, a 14-by-24-foot mural de-
picting a geographic timeline of the last 540 million years will be added to the exhibit.
“Through this exhibit, we can 
provide students education out-side the classroom and even to the community,” said Edward Bo-nahue, provost and vice president 
for academic affairs at SFC.
The college obtained about 80 
percent of the collection from the 
Earth Wonders Geological Mu-seum in Flagler County. To get it, Santa Fe had to present its case to the museum’s board of directors against other competitors in the North Florida area.
Margaret MacDuffie, the presi-
dent of Earth Wonders Geologi-cal Museum, said SFC stood out among the other applicants. The college has a large student popu-lation with a significant educa-tional reach.
“Out of all the offers we had, 
this was the most comprehen-
sive,” MacDuffie said.
Michael Patrick, an SFC natural 
sciences professor, said he thinks 
elements on SFC’s campus helped the school win the donation of the exhibit.
“We have a beautiful lobby in 
front of a planetarium, lots of stu-dents and the publicity to educate 
people,” he said. “We are grate-
ful.”
Patrick said the mural, which 
Harimandir Khalsa will paint, will be a valuable teaching tool.
“The mural is the icing on the 
cake,” he said.
The modification of the exhibit 
is far from done, Patrick said.
Donahue said the exhibit has 
potential to catch on.
“This is going to snowball the 
academic community who are very interested in the natural sci-ences,” he said.8, ALLIGATOR � WEDNESDAY, SEPTEMBER 25, 2013

The tooth fairy is coming to UF.
DenTek will host its second annual Tooth Fairy 
Tour at UF on Sept. 26, offering students free floss samples and compiling a scavenger hunt ending in a $100 prize.
The “tooth fairies” representing DenTek, a com-
pany specializing in oral care products, will hide an oversized plastic tooth in an iconic location on cam-
pus. The winner will receive a $100 prize, according to 
a DenTek news release.
The scavenger hunt will be organized using Twit-
ter under the hashtags #findthetooth and #UF. Stu-dents can also follow @DenTek for clues about the tooth’s location.
“We know that college students are creating their 
own oral care habits when they move away from home, so we thought this was a great idea to encour-age college students to floss early,”  said Rachel Schar-fman, DenTek brand manager.
Franky Lopez, a 20-year-old UF finance junior, said 
oral care awareness among college students is impor-tant and that oral care is “good to know.”
“College students don’t really focus on the effects 
that they’re going to have in 30 years,” Lopez said. “They just brush for good breath.”
As for the impact of the tour, Sara Alterman, a 
19-year-old UF food science and human nutrition sophomore, said she remains hopeful the tour will 
positively impact college students.
“Some people are just not aware of the negative ef-
fects of (not) flossing,” Alterman said. “Even if they 
don’t floss every day — even just a couple of times a week — anything is an improvement.”Find the hidden

After a robotic failure last year, UF’s NASA Robotics 
Mining Competition team is once again facing a simulat-
ed NASA interplanetary mission.
“We’ve learned more from failing than we ever could 
have succeeding,” said Scott Hinton, 21-year-old aero-
space engineering senior and mechanical project head for 
UF’s robotics team. “This year, we’ve got something to prove.”
The goal of NASA’s Robotic Mining Competition is 
to create a robot that can collect at least 10 kilograms of very fine, potentially hazardous sand that simulates what would be found on another planet in 10 minutes, said Eric Schwartz, faculty advisor for the robotics team at UF.
“This is kind of what I want to do with my life, and I want to do it well,” said Kevin French, 20-year-old elec-trical engineering junior and electrical project head for UF’s robotics team.
The winning team receives the Joe Kosmo Award for 
Excellence and a $5,000 team scholarship. Startup fund-ing granted by institutions like the NASA Florida Space Grant Consortium and Student Government has amount-ed to about $7,000 so far, Hinton said.
Improved team communication is key to overcoming 
the major obstacles of the competition, French said.
The electrical team has begun to order materials to 
make the robot autonomous, French said.
“We calculated that if we get it fully autonomous, we 
can win,” he said.Robotics team to try again in NASA mission

UF’s Homecoming recently released 
its finalized schedule for its 90th 
anniversary in November.
The week will have nine events, 
starting Oct. 26 at 4:30 p.m. and ending two hours prior to the Homecoming game kickoff against Vanderbilt 
University on Nov. 9.
Evan Galin, director of public 
relations for UF Homecoming, said 
the theme this year is Footprints of the Swamp, and the meaning behind it is a 
tribute to the Gator greats who continue 
to support the UF community.
Josh Strelzik, Homecoming general 
chairman, said he hopes to bring up 
the numbers in attendance this year by 
showcasing all the events during the week instead of focusing only on Gator Growl, which is Nov. 8.
“We are making these events more 
visible to the public through new 
locations and national sponsors, so 
students will be more informed about all of the entertainment that Homecoming has to offer,” Strelzik said.
The main event, Gator Growl, will 
feature The Fray and Sister Hazel. It will start at 7 p.m.  
However, the day starts at 11:30 
a.m. with the two-mile SunTrust Gator 
Gallop. The Homecoming Parade will 
follow immediately at noon, according to a news release.
Homecoming updates will be posted 
on the official Facebook page at www.facebook.com/GatorGrowlUf and on Twitter @UFGrowlHC and Instagram @ufgatorgrowl.UF Homecoming schedule finalized“We’ve learned more from failing than we ever

Gators in the NFL
Former Florida offensive lineman Xavier Nixon signed 
a contract with the Indianapolis Colts on Tuesday. Nixon was cut by the Pittsburgh Steelers in August.
Redshirt freshman Skyler 
Mornhinweg is Florida’s new No. 2 option at quarterback. Read the story on page 14.ADAM LICHTENSTEIN
Alligator Staff Writer @alichtenstein24
After missing Florida’s season 
opener against Toledo on Aug. 31 
due to a viral infection, Matt Jones 
was expected to boost Florida’s 
running game to the next level upon his return.
But two games into his season, 
Jones has not returned to the form that helped him rush for 275 yards as Mike Gillislee’s backup in 2012.
Because Jones has struggled 
since returning from his illness, No. 20 Florida (2-1) has elected to feature a collection of running 
backs with no one runner domi-
nating the majority of carries.
“Kids think things are going 
to be perfect all the time,” offen-
sive coordinator Brent Pease said. 
“There’s ups and downs, peaks and valleys.”
Jones was expected to garner 
the majority of touches when he returned, but junior Mack Brown 
received 24 carries compared to 
Jones’ 12 against Tennessee on Sat-urday.Both tailbacks struggled to 
break off long runs — each half-back’s longest run was for 13 yards. Brown averaged 3.6 yards per car-
ry, while Jones averaged 4.1.
Brown and Jones both scored 
against the Volunteers, but the two 
touchdowns came from 3 and 4 
yards out, respectively.
Pease said he was unsure 
whether Jones’ illness was still 
affecting the sophomore runner. Jones said last week that he was 
almost back to his original playing 
weight of 226 pounds, but it did not show against Tennessee. Jones had trouble penetrating the Volun-
teers’ defense and only managed 
49 yards on the day. 
 “[Jones is] a bigger back,” coach 
Will Muschamp said, “and some-times it takes those guys a little bit 
longer to get into their rhythm of 
playing.”
When Jones got a chance to 
make a play receiving the ball, he 
cost the Gators a possession. The 
running back caught a pass from quarterback Tyler Murphy and tried to switch ball-carrying hands while turning up the ﬁ  eld. The ball 
popped out of his hands as he was 
tackled and bounced directly to Volunteers defensive back Cam-eron Sutton.
“You can’t switch the hands 
coming across the middle off of a catch,” Muschamp said. “He knows that.
“That was a basic fundamental 
of ball security that you can’t vio-
late, and he did.”
Saturday’s turnover was the 
second in two games for Jones. He fumbled on his third carry of the 
season against Miami on Sept. 7.
To add more spice to Florida’s 
running game, coaches said they 
will look to get freshman Kelvin 
Taylor more involved with the of-fense.“Kelvin needs to continue to 
come on,” Muschamp said. 
How much playing time the son 
of former UF tailback Fred Taylor 
sees will depend on how he per-
forms in practice during the week.
Matt Riva / Alligator Staff
Matt Jones fumbles during Florida’s 31-17 victory against Tennessee on Saturday in Ben Hill Grifﬁ  n Stadium. 
Coach Will Muschamp plans to split carries between Jones and Mack Brown moving forward this season.

Alligator Staff Writer @joe_morgan
Jeff Driskel will undergo season-
ending surgery today to repair a frac-
tured ﬁ  bula in his lower right leg. 
His recovery is expected to take 
4-6 months. 
The procedure will prevent 
Driskel from traveling with the team 
to Lexington, Ky., when it takes on 
Kentucky on Saturday.
But until his health improves 
enough to travel, Driskel will do what he can to contribute in Gainesville. 
Although Driskel will not take the 
ﬁ  eld again in 2013, he remains in-volved with the Gators, attending daily meetings and taking part in game planning.
“I don’t want him to just disap-
pear and not be around,” offensive coordinator Brent Pease said. 
“He’s got to be around. He’s got 
to stay in tune with what we’re doing 
offensively.”
A role Driskel serves in the imme-
diate aftermath of his injury is one of 
support for new starting quarterback Tyler Murphy, who will make his 
ﬁ  rst career start Saturday against the 
Wildcats. 
It began late Saturday, when 
Driskel texted Murphy, “It’s your 
time now.”
“He was very encouraging,” Mur-
phy said of Driskel. Driskel still helping GatorsTHE ADAM BOMB
Chants of “Ty-ler Mur-
phy! Ty-lerMur-phy! Ty-ler Mur-phy!” rippled 
through the student section as quarterback Tyler Murphy had the Gators in the victory forma-tion for a third and 14 at their own 20-yard line.
Murphy Fever infected the 
alumni section as the entire Swamp echoed a name nobody expected to hear when Tennessee and Florida kicked off just hours earlier.
The kid deserved it. After doing the unthinkable and waiting 
his turn, he ﬁ  nally got his shot — albeit at the expense of quarterback Jeff Driskel’s unfor-tunate injury. 
Football can be a cruel game and it reared 
its ugly head Saturday.
Yet, out of the ashes rose an unknown, an 
underdog, an overlooked quarterback ath-letes everywhere could get be-hind. Florida fans loved Murphy on Saturday because he won. His players love him because his hard work got rewarded. 
I loved him — because I was 
also Tyler Murphy. 
I’m not proud of a .214 batting 
average my senior year of high school. But I also played more 
because of a teammate and good friend’s in-jury. 
I had my fair share of Murphy moments.Perhaps Murphy won’t be the savior of 
Florida’s “ﬂ  awed” offense, but there’s no harm in getting behind him. 
Fans never rallied behind Driskel because 
he arrived as the next savior. He was the na-tion’s top-ranked quarterback and Urban Meyer’s handpicked successor to the Tebow Murphy’s success fun to watch

Lauren Silver runs the ball 
wide.
As an outside back, Silver capi-
talizes on her playmaking abilities 
when the Gators use the width of the field.
The junior defender has al-
ready topped her assist record from last season, earning four as-sists within the first seven games — one more than she earned through 24 games in 2012.
Two of her assists came from 
corner-kick opportunities, mak-ing it the first time Silver has as-sisted on goals off the set piece in her career.
She said she owes a great deal 
of her playmaking this season to her experience from the past two years.
“I can’t even describe the 
amount of things I think I’ve learned from UF soccer,” Silver said. 
“As I continue to grow on the 
team, I think I’ve learned a lot and experienced different things, like facing the weather, and experi-encing a lot of adversity. 
“Being able to go into my third 
year and have all these different challenges that we’ve already gone through, kind of gets us pre-pared for what we have to come against this year.”
Silver’s role on Florida’s back-
line will be an important compo-nent facing Southeastern Confer-ence opponents Mississippi and Missouri on the road.
Limiting Mississippi senior for-
ward Rafaelle Souza in the attack-
ing third will be key for Florida.
Souza, a native of Brazil, has 
scored 27 goals in her career at Ole Miss — one of them coming 
against Florida in 2012.
The Gators maintained pos-
session early in last year’s two 
matchups against the Rebels, 
leading them to two victories.
Silver said the team’s ability to control the pace of play early in 
games will help it this weekend.
“To carry that on is really im-
portant because I think the first 
five minutes of any game re-
ally dictates how it’s going to be 
played out,” Silver said. “If we can get the first couple posses-sions and get a couple chances be-fore the game even gets to sit in, I think that’s just going to intimi-
date their team and bring a differ-
ent force towards them.”
The Miami native will also see 
a familiar face going into Sun-
day’s Missouri matchup. Former 
Florida Atlantic soccer coach and 
Team Boca club coach Brian Dool-
ey is Mizzou’s assistant coach this season. Silver played on Dooley’s club team before coming to Flor-
ida, but she said she’s learned 
more playing the Gators’ style of 
soccer.
“If they’re teaching their teams 
based off my team, we all bring 
different things to the table now,” 
Silver said. “I might have learned 
some things [from Dooley], but other people have taught me things as well. We only have one 
style, and I don’t think anyone re-
ally plays like us.” 
Coach Becky Burleigh thinks 
both teams will test Florida with 
an aggressive offense, but she is 
confident in how Silver and Flor-
ida’s defense have developed in 
recent years.
“I think Lauren has embraced 
what she does very well,” Bur-
leigh said. 
“She has some shortcomings, 
but she doesn’t let those short-comings keep her off the field. 
She takes defense very person-
ally, and because of that, she does not like to get beat.”14, ALLIGATOR � WEDNESDAY, SEPTEMBER 25, 2013

Florida, the defending Southeastern Confer-
ence champion, will open its season at the three-
day Pinch A Penny All Florida Invitational on Friday in the O’Connell Center.
The men’s and women’s diving teams are 
looking to improve after having six top-20 performances in the 2013 NCAA Zone Diving Championships.
“We’re looking pretty good,” diving coach 
Donnie Craine said. “I’m very excited about where we are right now.”
The All Florida Invitational — a meet UF 
has won since its debut in October of 2010 — will feature six other schools from the state of 
Florida: Florida State, Florida Atlantic, Florida 
Southern, Miami, Florida International and Nova.
“Miami has one of the best [dive teams] in 
the country,” Craine said. “We’re looking for-
ward to competing with them.”
Florida will be without redshirt senior Chris 
Jones, who suffered a shoulder tear and under-
went surgery in April. Craine expects Jones, who was one of Florida’s best divers last season and is ahead of his scheduled recovery, to re-turn for the SEC Championships in February.
With Jones out, Craine is looking to redshirt sophomore Zach Hernandez to fill the void.
On the women’s side, Craine is confident 
sophomores Emily Mosher and Kahlia Warner will make an impact this season.
“Mosher went into the conference meet last 
year, did not score a point,” he said. “I expect her to score points this year, because she’s im-
proved a lot over the summer and in this fall.” 
“[Warner] is probably the most talented, but she didn’t have as much experience.”
After spending the last 28 years coaching 
at Florida — the longest tenure of any coach on campus — Craine feels confident about his young squad. Most of his team had never per-formed a 10-meter platform dive when they ar-rived at UF, he said.
“To dive off of 35 feet and hit 35 miles an 
hour, it takes a lot of courage,” he said.
Craine is focused on extending his divers’ 
season to the NCAA Championships in March and making an impact on the swimming and diving team’s national title hopes.
“Unfortunately, it does come down to points, 
not just, you know, how they’re doing,” Craine said. “When it comes to the NCAAs, the divers have one meet that we go to. If we dive well, we qualify. If we don’t, we’re sitting at home watching the swimmers leave, and it’s not fun to do that.”
This season’s All-Florida Invitational has 
special meaning for Craine and swimming coach Gregg Troy. UF will be taking donations 
of new and unused items to be sent to deployed 
U.S. troops in all branches. Both coaches have sons in the military.
“It means a lot to us to have the association 
with the military between both of our sons,” Craine said. “We’re excited about being able to help out the military.”Florida opens season Friday

Skyler Mornhinweg is in a position 
he never thought he would find himself 
this season — one snap away from be-coming No. 20 Florida’s starting quar-terback. 
After Jeff Driskel suffered a season-
ending fractured fibula in his lower right leg against Tennessee, backup quarter-back Tyler Murphy became the Gators’ new starting signal-caller.
UF’s new arrangement means Morn-
hinweg will back up Murphy for the rest of the season. The redshirt freshman is next in line if Murphy were to be injured 
at any point in 2013.
“I don’t know if he knows the volume 
of everything yet, because you still have 
the growing pains of learning all of it,” offensive coordinator Brent Pease said. “He’s smart.”
Mornhinweg, who is 6-foot-2 and 214 
pounds, had several scholarship offers coming out of Philadelphia St. Joseph’s 
Prep. He was rated a four-star recruit 
by ESPN, which ranked him the 19th-best quarterback in the Class of 2012. He chose Florida instead of Penn State, Stanford and Tennessee. 
Mornhinweg spent last season work-ing with the Gators’ scout team while redshirting. 
“He’ll be taking about one-fourth 
of the reps, like in most back-up situ-ations,” coach Will Muschamp said. “Skyler will be the backup. Max Staver will move over (from UF’s scout team) and work with our offense for prepara-tion of the game.”
Mornhinweg 
is the son of Mar-ty Mornhinweg, 
who serves as the 
offensive coordinator of the New York 
Jets. A dual-threat quarterback, he fin-ished his high school career with 4,912 passing yards — the most all time at St. Joseph’s — and 1,243 rushing yards.
“He understands football because 
he’s grown up around it,” Pease said. “The thing now that he’s going to lack 
is true game speed and getting in there 
where they actually hit you. That would be a next step we have to take.
“I don’t think anybody in that situ-
ation would be totally ready for what Jeff’s gone through.”
Staver is a true freshman from Brent-
wood, Tenn. Senior receiver Trey Bur-ton, who attempted 12 total passes in 
2010 and 2011, would be another option 
to fill in at quarterback for Florida.Mornhinweg new backup

Donnie Craine
UF coachthrone (sorry, John Brantley). 
He was the untouchable 
player with high expectations 
that came with the lofty terri-tory.
It has not gone as planned. 
Driskel will be back next sea-son and very well could be the starting quarterback again. For the time being, Florida’s own David is about to face a string of Goliaths that include LSU, Georgia, South Carolina and Florida State. 
The redshirt junior looked 
like a poised veteran facing a Southeastern Conference de-fense. He looked more comfort-able than an experienced Driskel hobbled by a sprained knee. 
Murphy’s bursts of speed, 
first downs and Chris Leak-esque spirals invigorated the Florida fan base. His teammates and coaches were happy to see him get the call.
By all accounts, Murphy has 
been the consummate profes-sional in the Orange and Blue. He asked Will Muschamp at one point to work with the scout team to better prepare the Gators and improve as a player.
Take the thoughts of senior 
defensive back Jaylen Watkins, who lived with Murphy on campus last year. From what it sounded like, Murphy spent every waking hour on football. It is his life.
Watching him against the 
Volunteers, I couldn’t help but think back to my Wally Pipp moment. Here one second and gone the next.
Brent Pease brought up a 
great point Tuesday. It’s easy to come into a game as an un-known, but there’s nothing unknown about a quarterback who was trending nationally on Twitter during his debut.
“People will be able to game 
plan for him now that they see the tendencies that he has or what they see that he can hurt defenses with,” Pease said.
Now, Murphy is everybody’s 
favorite quarterback. He’s still the guy who came off the bench and carried his team to victory. He’s still the guy who replaced the President people voted out of office, the guy who replaced the coach who didn’t fulfill expectations, the guy who re-placed the quarterback people wanted more from.It’s about to get real for Mur-
phy. 
For Davids everywhere, 
here’s hoping the honeymoon turns into a happy marriage.“He said he just was just going 
to help me along the way.”
The support continued when 
Florida’s signal-callers met with 
Pease on Monday. Pease said 
Driskel also approached him in addition to reaching out to Mur-phy.
“He told Tyler and said it to 
me, ‘Whatever you need me to do, I’ll be glad to help. I’m there for you,’” Pease said of Driskel. “He’s a supportive teammate.”
Northern native: Dominique 
Easley would never travel to Kentucky for reasons other than football.
Make that any place south of 
the Mason-Dixon Line.
Easley, a Staten Island, N.Y., 
native, said the South feels like a different country. He even ar-
ranges to have Northern food 
mailed to him. 
He just can’t take Southern 
cuisine.
“Me and the South don’t mix,” 
Easley said. “Just don’t mix. If I don’t like to be there, I won’t be 
there.”
Meanwhile, Florida offensive 
coordinator Brent Pease is ex-
cited to visit the northernmost school in the Southeastern Con-
ference. There is one Bluegrass 
State staple he grew to love dur-
ing his two seasons as Kentucky’s offensive coordinator in 2001 and 
2002.
“Horse racing’s awesome,” 
Pease said.Pease attended the Kentucky 
Derby twice and said he has in-deed enjoyed a mint julep. He 
also attended Wildcats basketball games at Rupp Arena, but the 
horses stole his heart.
“I always go back to horse rac-
es,” Pease said.Extending the streak: Florida 
has defeated Kentucky in 26 con-secutive meetings. 
Pease does not want to see the 
Gators’ winning streak snapped on his watch.
“You kind of feel the pres-
sure,” Pease said. 
“You don’t want it to end.  … 
Obviously, there’s tradition there, and you got to continue to carry it on.”
Pease was part of the series 
during his two seasons with the Wildcats. 
Florida defeated Kentucky 
both times during Pease’s stay in 
Lexington, Ky.
The Gators — led then by Steve 
Spurrier — won their first meet-
ing against Pease in a 44-10 blow-out in 2001 but only squeaked 
by the Wildcats 41-34 under Ron 
Zook in 2002.
“It’s something I think that, 
you know, when I was there, and 
I’m sure they have in the past, 
they continued pumping into you,” Pease said of how UK ap-proaches UF each season. “This is the time to do it. Let’s prepare to 
break the streak.”

Second-year offensive coordinator Brent Pease speaks with coach Will Muschamp during warm-ups 
prior to Florida’s 31-17 victory against Tennessee on Saturday in Ben Hill Griffin Stadium.
Taylor got a chance to show off 
his talent against Toledo, running for 
43 yards on five attempts as Florida 
closed out its 24-6 win. 
But since August, Taylor has seen 
only one carry for three yards, which 
came in the middle of the second 
quarter on Saturday. 
Earlier this month, Muschamp 
criticized Taylor’s abilities to per-
form outside of running the ball. Af-ter Florida defeated Toledo, he said 
Taylor needed to continue progress-
ing in other aspects of the position. 
But on Tuesday, Pease compared 
Taylor’s progress to where Jones was 
at this point in his career. Jones hit his 
stride as the season progressed, and a year later, he is a key cog in run-oriented Florida’s running machine.
 “[Taylor] is kind of hitting that

Alex Holston’s career at Florida 
is off to an impressive start.
Holston, a freshman right-side 
hitter for the Gators, is taking op-
ponents’ attention away from 
seniors Chloe Mann and Taylor Brauneis with her play so far this season. 
“It was really nice to see the 
emergence of Alex Holston con-
tinue [in Milwaukee],” assistant 
coach Dave Boos said. “She’s really 
getting more and more opportuni-
ties now.
“Our team is starting to use her 
in situations where we hadn’t ear-lier in the year, and she came out there with [eight] kills and two blocks and had a great match.” 
Holston wasted no time getting 
acclimated to college volleyball.  
She had the best opening-week-
end hitting percentage by a starting freshman in school history with a clip of .436 while playing against New Orleans, LIU-Brooklyn and Duke.
Since then, she has done noth-
ing but improve.  Despite not being Florida’s top 
offensive threat — the freshman is 
behind Mann, outside hitter Ziva 
Recek and middle blocker Simone 
Antwi — Holston ranks third on the team with 94 kills.  
“She sees the game really, really 
well and has a lot of conﬁ  dence right now in that,” Boos said. 
 “So, what you’ll see a lot of, es-
pecially in the tougher situations 
off a dug ball, is throwing the ball 
to her and letting her bail us out a 
little bit.”
Among UF players with a mini-
mum of 175 attacks on the season, 
Holston currently ranks No. 2 on 
the team with a hitting percentage 
of .410, trailing only Mann. 
That clip is fourth best in the 
Southeastern Conference and 31st in the nation. 
Only ﬁ  ve players in the top 50 in 
hitting percentage are freshmen. 
Two of those players — Ala-
bama’s Krystal Rivers and Tu-lane’s Sarah Strasner — rank ahead of Holston. 
With the Maryland native con-
tinuing to adapt to the college 
game, her role could increase.  
“What we’re doing is giving her 
more balls in bad situations,” Boos 
said.  
“Early on it’s like, ‘Okay, come 
on give Alex the good situations and let her get used to the college 
volleyball.’
“Now, it’s, ‘Give Alex any ball 
you want’ because she’s putting it 
away.”Freshman right-side hitter becoming
