IMPEACHMENT
STUDENT BODY PRESIDENT 
IMPEACHMENT FAILED IN 
JUDICIARY COMMITTEE
By Emma McAvoy 
Alligator Staff Writer
The former UF Student Gov-
ernment Senate adviser agreed 
with the role of the judiciary 
committee in failing the Stu-
dent Body president’s impeach-
ment resolution, but students 
who disagree will petition for 
his removal. 
The day after the judiciary 
committee unanimously failed 
the resolution, UF student Al-
fredo Ortiz created a Facebook 
event encouraging students to 
sign a petition today and Tues-
day on Turlington Plaza for 
Student Body President Micahel 
Murphy’s removal.
Ortiz, a 19-year-old UF phi-
losophy sophomore, said 500 
students must sign the petition 
for it to be valid, per the SG 
300 legislation codes, to show 
SG that students want Murphy 
removed. He said this is a re-
call referendum, which allows 
people to remove an elected of-
ﬁ  cial through voting within 60 
days of its initiation. 
“Florida [state] law allows 
for Student Government of-
ﬁ  cials to be removed from of-
ﬁ  ce by a majority vote of the 
students,” the Facebook event 
said. 
Ortiz said he and ﬁ  ve other 
students — Mark Merwitzer, 
Nik Bindi, Dmitry Podobreev, 
William Zelin and Branden Reis 
— formed a committee to create this event because they didn’t 
agree with neither the resolu-
tion nor its failure. 
Emails released on Oct. 30 
showed a conversation be-
tween Murphy and a President 
Donald Trump re-election cam-
paign ofﬁ  cial about bringing 
Trump Jr. to campus Oct. 10. A 
week later, students demanded 
Murphy’s resignation at a Sen-
ate meeting. Two weeks after 
the emails were released, one 
of the authors hand-delivered 
Murphy the impeachment reso-
lution.
Former SG Senate adviser 
James Tyger emailed Ben Lima, 
Inspire party leader and a co-
author of the impeachment res-
olution, saying he wasn’t sure 
if he agreed with Lima’s inter-
pretation of the Student Body 
constitution requiring Senate 
President Emily Dunson to hold 
an impeachment body hearing. 
Tyger suggested that if Lima 
thinks SG laws are ambiguous, 
then he should appeal to the SG 
Supreme Court. The Supreme 
Court members were appointed 
by Murphy and conﬁ  rmed by 
the Senate in Summer. Their 
term lasts from Fall 2019 to 
Spring 2020. 
The resolution failed at the 
judiciary committee meeting on 
Thursday. However, resolution 
authors like Lima insist that 
the impeachment resolution 
shouldn’t have gone through 
the judiciary committee at all 
and instead should have gone 
directly to the impeachment 
body committee.Students petition against

UF EMAILED STUDENTS AFTER 
PROTEST, RACIST SNAP 
VAN INCIDENT
By April Rubin
Alligator Staff Writer
UF administration sent an email 
to students Friday afternoon with 
a statement denouncing “two inci-
dents in the past week related to rac-
ism and anti-Semitism.” 
The email from Win Phillips, 
interim vice president for student 
affairs, ﬁ  rst addressed the situa-
tion in which a white male student 
called black students the N-word 
in a SNAP ride-share van, which is a free transportation service for UF 
students similar to Uber.
The second event the email refer-
enced was Tuesday’s protest against 
Yoni Michanie, an Israel Defense 
Forces sergeant and reserve mem-
ber, who said students held up signs 
calling him a “Nazi,” a “war crimi-
nal” and a “ﬁ  lthy colonialist.” 
Michanie told The Alligator he 
was also verbally called a Nazi and 
declined to comment further. 
Several people who were at the 
event denied or couldn’t conﬁ  rm 
that anyone or any signs called Mi-
chanie a Nazi. First-hand accounts, 
videos and photos of signs at the 
protest published on WUFT News’ Instagram do not corroborate the 
claim.
The Alligator emailed Phillips for 
comment on both incidents, but he 
did not respond as of Saturday night.
“Both incidents illustrate behav-
ior that is directly at odds with our 
campus values,” Phillips wrote in 
the statement. 
Racism and anti-Semitism have 
increased on college campuses, ac-
cording to CNN. The Anti-Defama-
tion League reported that anti-Se-
mitic incidents surged in previous 
years, with 1,879 recorded acts in 
2018.

64 UF STUDENTS RAN MORE 
THAN 75 MILES TO BEN HILL 
GRIFFIN STADIUM
By Ana Escalante
Alligator Staff Writer
Every year, the U.S. Military and 
Naval academies run a relay between 
West Point, New York, and Annapo-
lis, Maryland, in their long-standing 
rivalry during game day weekend.
This year, UF and Florida State 
University ROTC branches joined in a 
similar tradition for the ﬁ  rst time. 
Students from FSU ran from Tal-
lahassee to Buckville, Florida, where 
they met 64 UF students who ran from 
there to Gainesville — the midway 
point between both universities.
The UF runners ﬁ  nished at Gator 
Walk in front of Ben Hill Grifﬁ  n Stadi-
um on Sunday afternoon. Capt. Adam Langley, who also helps run the UF’s 
ROTC Air Force branch, said cadets 
could volunteer for the race. 
“It’s about 150 miles approximate-
ly, and this year is the 150th year of 
college football,” Langley said. “Pride, 
ﬁ  tness and a love for college football 
— those are the reasons why we did 
it.”
UF ROTC Air Force First Lieuten-
ant Cadet Ian White, a 22-year-old UF 
aerospace engineering ﬁ  fth-year, ran 
the ﬁ  rst leg of the race and ﬁ  nished 
the last leg at Ben Hill Grifﬁ  n Stadium. 
He said he enjoyed running through 
Gainesville the most for the last leg, 
as it is his hometown. 
“It’s kind of like a bucket list thing 
to run both representing my country 
through ROTC and my school for the 
Florida Gators,” he said.

made public, controversy struck 
again when students protested Mi-
chanie who was scheduled to speak 
at Little Hall at an event organized 
by several student groups including 
Christians United for Israel at UF.
Taylor Roth, the Christians Unit-
ed for Israel at UF president, said 
Michanie told her a couple students 
whispered to him as they were leav-
ing, calling him a Nazi. Roth was 
standing in the corner, so she did 
not hear or see anyone refer to him 
as such. 
Videos posted on social media 
show the silent protest, organized 
by multiple student organizations 
including Students for Justice in Pal-
estine, with about 100 people stand-
ing up as Michanie was speaking, 
holding up paper signs and walking 
out of the room. 
Michanie posted a video on Twit-
ter of students holding paper signs 
and leaving the room. In the tweet, 
Michanie wrote that students were 
“holding signs that accused me of 
being a Nazi. A war criminal. And 
a ﬁ  lthy colonialist.” 
Orlando said UF administration 
heard about protesters calling him 
a Nazi from a student but could not 
conﬁ  rm if that student attended the 
event. 
“We would never suggest that 
the protest is against campus val-
ues,” Orlando said. “The issue 
comes into play when we’re talk-
ing about divisiveness.”
After the event, in an interview 
with an Alligator reporter, Michanie 
did not mention being called a Nazi 
or any other derogatory terms. He 
expressed discontent with protest-
ers for leaving rather than engaging 
in dialogue with him. Michanie lat-
er wrote a piece for The Daily Wire 
recounting his experience which 
does not mention neither students 
nor signs calling him a Nazi. Michanie told The Alligator that 
the speech was meant to “humanize 
Palestinians.” 
TAMID at Florida, a group that 
promotes business experiences in 
Israel co-sponsored the event. Sara 
Lewittes, the organization’s presi-
dent, said she didn’t hear anyone 
say “Nazi” or other derogatory 
terms. She heard screaming after 
the walkout, but she couldn’t make 
out who it came from or what was 
said. 
“I don’t think there’s proof either 
way, and that’s the issue,” she said.
In an Alligator Letter to the Edi-
tor, Geoffrey Datz, a 21-year-old UF 
international studies junior, wrote 
that protesters called Michanie a 
Nazi and war criminal. Datz did 
not attend the event and told The 
Alligator in an interview Friday he 
got the information from Michanie’s 
writing. 
Datz, who is Jewish, said the 
walkout was part of a rising trend 
of anti-Semitism, and he was happy 
to see the university address it. UF is home to one of the largest Jewish 
undergraduate student populations 
in the country. 
“It’s really important as a campus 
and as a university to address instanc-
es of hate and racism,” Datz said. 
Laila Fakhoury, UF Students for 
Justice in Palestine president, said 
Phillips’ email labeled anti-Zionist 
statements as anti-Semitic. 
“For us to be anti-Semitic goes 
against our values,” she said.
Most protesters held two printed 
signs: One read, “Israel is attacking 
Gaza again. How many more times 
is this OK?” and the other was a fact 
sheet about Gaza, Fakhoury said.
Fakhoury said the protesters 
wanted to bring awareness to recent 
bombings, during which Israeli and 
Palestinian forces exchanged rocket 
ﬁ  re, according to The New York 
Times. 
An Israeli strike in Gaza killed 
Jihad commander Baha Abu al-Ata 
Nov. 12, The Times reported. Pal-
estinian militants retaliated with 
hundreds of rockets. In total, bombs ﬁ  red from both Israel and Gaza left 
34 Palestinians dead and 63 Israelis 
in need of medical treatment, ac-
cording to the BBC. 
Fakhoury said one protester said 
Palestine is not “for sale,” but fel-
low protesters asked him to stop 
speaking. In a video posted on the 
group’s Twitter, another person is 
heard saying something about Pal-
estine.
As a Palestinian student, Fak-
houry said UF does not fulﬁ  ll Phil-
lips’ statement on welcoming di-
versity. She hopes the university 
apologizes for the email.
Orlando also said UF would take 
action against the student who used 
the N-word in the SNAP van if the 
situation was deemed to be a con-
duct violation. UF administration 
has reached several people who 
were in the van. 
Kitan Adeniji, an 18-year-old UF 
business administration freshman, 
tweeted that a white student called 
her and her black friends a racial 
slur. She declined to comment on Phillips’ email. 
Paul Ortiz, a 
UF history pro-
fessor and direc-
tor of the Samuel 
Proctor Oral His-
tory Program, 
participated in 
the protest and 
said he did not hear or see anyone 
or signs refer to Michanie as a Nazi. 
Ortiz, who is a military veteran, 
said he would not have tolerated 
students attacking a veteran for his 
or her service.  
“To send out an email which 
equates that kind of rhetoric with 
the racist incident that occurred in 
the SNAP van is an example of false 
equivalency,” he said.

arubin@alligator.orgSTATEMENT,  from pg. 1‘I don’t think there’s proof either way, and that’s the issue.’
Lima said the resolution authors 
are more focused on getting Dunson to 
schedule an impeachment body hearing 
than appealing to the Supreme Court.  
The authors of the resolution — 
Lima, Claudia Tio, Matthew Diaz, Colin 
Solomon and Zachariah Chou — raised 
points of contention online after SG 
judiciary chairman Branden Pearson 
emailed Lima Wednesday that the ju-
diciary committee would discuss the 
resolution because the authors didn’t 
believe the meeting was valid. 
Pearson wrote in an email that the 
impeachment body won’t hear this res-
olution due to his committee’s decision.   Ortiz said he 
agrees with the judi-
ciary committee on 
its “factual inaccura-
cies.” The committee 
is accusing Murphy of 
misfeasance instead of 
“malfeasance.” 
Murphy is still the 
Student Body president and will con-
tinue his term until the SG Spring 2020 
elections unless appeals are successful.
“We want to make the activist 
groups who call for Michael Murphy’s 
resignation have a direct say in how 
he should be removed from ofﬁ  ce and 
why,” Ortiz said.

HE’S BEEN NOMINATED 
FOR THREE LATIN 
GRAMMYS SINCE 2015
By Jordyn Kalman
Alligator Staff Writer
UF professor José Valentino 
Ruiz sat patiently in his seat at 
the MGM Grand in Las Vegas 
earlier this month. 
When a presenter at the Latin 
Grammys called the name of the 
album he worked on, Ruiz said 
all he could think of was the 
hard work that made this mo-
ment a reality. 
“It was coming full circle, 
and I finally felt like I arrived at 
one of my greatest goals,” Ruiz 
said.
The 31-year-old, whose stage 
name is José Valentino, was the 
flutist and recording engineer on 
the album “Todo Pasa,” winner 
of Best Spanish Language Chris-
tian Album at the 20th Annual 
Latin Grammy Awards ceremo-
ny in Las Vegas on Nov. 14.  
Ruiz said he collaborated on 
this album with his close friend 
and mentor, Juan Delgado. The 
pair, who have known each 
other for five years, worked to-
gether long-distance for a year to 
record and put Delgado’s album 
together.
“You want to try to get nomi-
nated, and after you’ve done 
that, you want to see if you can 
win,” Ruiz said. “But it’s all for 
fun, you know. At the end of 
the day, it doesn’t determine the 
value of the actual album itself 
or the impact that it can have.”
Ruiz is no stranger to the 
spotlight. He was nominated for 
two other Latin Grammys, won 
an Emmy, won a Global Music 
Award and holds the record for 
the most DownBeat Student Mu-
sic Awards, the highest award 
for jazz and commercial music education, he 
said.
In addition 
to singing 
and playing 
instruments, 
Ruiz compos-
es, produces, 
writes film 
scores and makes commercial 
jingles. 
Even with his accolades, Ruiz 
continues to teach “Intro to Mu-
sic Technology” and “Strategic 
Entrepreneurship Development 
for the Arts” because he said he 
cares for his students and wants 
to be a role model for them. 
“I teach because I recognize 
that I had incredible teachers 
and I would not be where I’m 
at today without them,” Ruiz 
said. “I love helping people real-
ize their innate potential. I like 
to teach because I love seeing 
people become set free from any 
inhibition and self doubt.”
Andrea Garcia, a 23-year-old 
UF vocal performances senior, is 
taking Ruiz’s entrepreneurship 
class. She said Ruiz is a great 
professor because he encour-
ages individuality and creates 
a safe learning environment for 
students to freely express them-
selves. 
“He has taught me that with 
determination and wholesome 
desire, it is possible to achieve 
our dreams,” Garcia said. 
When Garcia heard Ruiz 
won a Grammy, she felt excited 
and was proud to be one of his 
students. 
“To be taught by someone 
of his reputation is truly inspir-
ing,” Garcia said. “It makes me 
feel like I am on the right track 
to achieving my own dreams.”

THE INCIDENT IS STILL 
UNDER INVESTIGATION
By Dana Cassidy
Alligator Staff Writer
Gainesville Police are investigating 
the death of a man they believe was 
killed out of self-defense.
Just after midnight Wednesday, po-
lice received a 911 call from a woman 
who said she shot her 42-year-old ex-
boyfriend Daniel Cain Smith, accord-
ing to a press release. The woman’s name has not been released. 
Upon arriving at the scene of the 
6400 block of Southwest 20th Av-
enue, police found Smith unconscious 
on the ground with multiple gunshot 
wounds, the release said. 
Police wrote the woman had mul-
tiple injuries that lined up with her be-
ing attacked. Authorities are reviewing 
evidence and interviewing people who 
have knowledge about their relation-
ship, the report said. 
Earlier this year, police found one 
man dead and two others injured after 
a home invasion robbery this Septem-ber. Later that month, another student 
was arrested after shooting at three 
different people in a Walmart plaza. 
In October,  a man was arrested after 
police say he stabbed his friend.
Atlhough this is the fourth recent 
incident, murder is relatively rare in 
Gainesville, as a 2018 report noted 
that the average is normally two per 
year. This is the most recent spike in 
homicides since 2017, which also saw 
four homicides by its end.

MOTION WAS 
UNANIMOUS
By Lina Ruiz
Alligator Staff Writer
Gainesville city commis-
sioners unanimously passed 
two motions Thursday relating 
to climate change.
The commission first unan-
imously passed a motion to 
work with city staff in creating 
a proclamation and resolution 
declaring a climate emergency 
with a focus on Gainesville’s 
racial disparity and equity poli-
cies. The motion also called for 
the creation of an online dash-
board on the city’s website 
showing its carbon footprint in 
real-time. 
Commissioner Helen War-
ren sponsored this agenda 
item. 
“We are in a position glob-
ally to recognize the impact 
our future actions can have on the planet,” she said. 
District 2 Commissioner 
Harvey Ward suggested direct-
ing the Gainesville Regional 
Utility manager and city man-
ager to develop the online 
dashboard and put it on the 
city website. He also reiterated 
the connection between equity 
and climate change. 
“Equity and the environ-
ment are not separate issues. 
They are all together,” he said. 
“When the environment crash-
es, we know who’s going to be 
affected first — and it’s not go-
ing to be the wealthiest part of 
our population.”
When commissioners re-
turned from recess for the 
meeting’s evening session, a 
resolution “imploring the U.S. 
Congress to pass House Reso-
lution 109 and create a Green 
New Deal” was also unani-
mously passed. 
The Green New Deal, spear-
headed by U.S. Congresswom-an Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez 
(D-NY), highlights the find-
ings of a 2018 report on global 
warming by the Intergov-
ernmental Panel on Climate 
Change. 
The deal states: “human 
activity is the dominant cause 
of observed climate change 
over the past century” and 
“the United States must take a 
leading role in reducing [green-
house gas] emissions through 
economic transformation.”   
District 3 Commissioner 
David Arreola said he recently 
met with Ocasio-Cortez’s staff 
in Washington D.C. to discuss 
the resolution. 
“They were very excited. 
They believe they’re making 
traction in the Congress,” he 
said. “We will actually be the 
first city in Florida to voice our 
support for this legislation.”

PARTIES DISAGREE ON 
INTERPRETING SG LAWS
By Emma McAvoy 
Alligator Staff Writer
Two UF Student Government Sen-
ate meetings in a row were canceled, 
and senators are unsure if this is al-
lowed under the Student Body consti-
tution.
SG Senate President Emily Dunson 
canceled Senate meetings two weeks 
in a row, which may prevent the Sen-
ate from meeting again this semester 
to discuss the resolution to impeach 
Student Body President Michael Mur-
phy. 
Dunson emailed senators that the 
last Senate meeting will be Dec. 3. The 
Student Body constitution says the 
Senate will have the power to “deter-
mine the time and place of its meet-
ings, provided that it meets once every 
two school weeks.” 
Dunson’s email described this 
week as a holiday week, although 
classes are still scheduled for today 
and Tuesday. The constitution doesn’t 
specify holiday exceptions.
Last Fall, the Tuesday meeting on 
Thanksgiving week was canceled as 
well. 
“After reviewing our constitution and codes and sentiments from Sena-
tors in all parties about meeting dur-
ing the holiday week, our next Sen-
ate meeting will be December 3,” the 
email said. 
Ben Lima, a co-author of the im-
peachment resolution and Inspire Par-
ty leader, accused Dunson of avoiding 
accountability because of concern of 
outcry during public comment. This 
outcry would be based on her decision 
to refer the impeachment resolution to 
the judiciary committee and its failure 
of the resolution. 
The Alligator has confirmed that 
some national outlets are interest-
ed in covering the impeachment in 
Gainesville. On Thursday, the New 
York Times published an op-ed by 
Inspire Sen. Zachariah Chou. The 
Alligator’s original coverage on the 
emails was picked up by several na-
tional news outlets, including the New 
York Times, The Washington Post and 
CNN.  
“She knows national press outlets 
would have been coming to the Senate 
meeting and reporting on how what 
she did was wrong,” Lima said. “This 
is what happens when personal biases 
get in the way of serving the Student 
Body.”
Emily Dunson did not respond to 
The Alligator’s calls, texts and emails.  Emails released on Oct. 30 showed 
Murphy and a President Donald 
Trump reelection campaign official 
talking about about bringing Trump 
Jr. to campus Oct. 10. A week later, 
students demanded Murphy’s resigna-
tion at a Senate meeting. Two weeks 
after the emails were released, an au-
thor hand-delivered Murphy the im-
peachment resolution. 
Lately, both sides of the aisle in the 
Senate have interpreted SG laws differ-
ently. Dunson and Judiciary Commit-
tee Chairman Branden Pearson said 
the SG legislation code 306.3 allowed 
Dunson to assign the impeachment 
resolution to a committee, but Lima 
said the constitution requires the im-
peachment body to hold a hearing re-
gardless. 
Murphy is still the Student Body 
president and will continue his term 
until the SG Spring 2020 elections un-
less appeals are successful. 
Lima said that because SG Supreme 
Court justices were Impact-appointed, 
they will interpret the rules in a way 
that favors Murphy. 
The SG Supreme Court would have 
final say on the interpretation of the 
laws if a case were brought before 
them.

UF STUDENTS HOPE TO GET 
1,000 SIGNATURES 
By Priya Dames
Alligator Staff Writer
While the Gainesville City Commission 
waits until Jan. 1 to vote on a plastic straw 
ban, six UF students decided to take matters 
into their own hands with a petition. They 
want a plastic straw policy in Midtown. 
Brianna Barone, a 22-year-old UF tele-
communications senior, and her group 
started the petition on Change.org called 
“Save the Straws Midtown.” With a goal of 
1,000 signatures, the petition has 59 as of 
Sunday night.
The students propose establishments of-
fer straws to customers only if asked, Bar-
one said. She said the group hopes this will 
lead to less straws being wasted by custom-
ers.
Barone said she started the petition with 
a group of students when they were tasked 
with creating a campaign in one of their 
classes. 
The petition defines Midtown as 16th 
Street to 18th Street and University Avenue 
to Northwest First Avenue, she said. The group hopes to convince restaurants and 
bars to implement the straw policy, includ-
ing Tijuana Flats, Fat Daddy’s and Relish. 
The group found inspiration from Satch-
el’s Pizza. Mark Rodriquez, the manager 
at Satchel’s Pizza, said he finds it easier to 
give customers straws only upon request.
“We just feel that straws are pretty 
wasteful and unnecessary 100 percent of 
the time,”  Rodriquez said. 
The petitioners also created an Insta-
gram account called @ufstraws to help 
reach their goal.
Barone said the project made her think 
more about her own plastic consumption 
and the environmental impact of such 
wastefulness. 
Plastic straws can take up to 200 years 
to decompose and are very bad for marine 
life, Barone said. She hopes to further re-
duce plastic waste by encouraging students 
to buy reusable straws, wooden utensils 
and glass containers. 
“I am hoping that we can change more 
than just straw use, but reduce plastic items 
all together,” she said.

We can’t let politics break us apart
We live in a society where politics is 
the root of deep tension and disdain. 
While it is important to have individ-
ual political beliefs, we can’t let them 
ruin us.
Two weeks ago, I lost my 93-year-old grand-
father. My grandpa was the most amicable and 
loving man one could wish to be around. As my 
family frequently says, there is only one man 
papa hated: Donald Trump. While I loved to en-
courage heated political debates with him, I al-
ways learned from those conversations that our differing 
opinions did not impede my respect for his views. 
That is what our country is losing: respect for one an-
other’s beliefs. We must remember that a person chooses 
to afﬁ  liate with a political party because he or she believes 
that the party’s platform encompasses the ideas that will 
make our country better. 
I have heard far too many stories of students losing 
friends over political differences. I know from experience 
that I have lost friends because I am proud to voice my 
political opinions. From unfollows on Instagram to verbal 
confrontations, I have seen the severity of what politics can 
do to people.
Recently, I think that personal identities and political af-
ﬁ  liations have become intertwined. With our current politi-
cal divide, it makes sense because our political beliefs tend 
to stem from our morals and values. Despite this, we must 
remember that we are not solely comprised of our political 
ideologies. 
We are better than this. We must be better than this.  How are we one day supposed to lead a coun-
try when we, as college students, are losing re-
spect for those we disagree with?
We all see the impeachment hearings taking 
place in Washington. We see partisanship in the 
spotlight with a rigid political divide between 
Democrats and Republicans. 
There is no stage being set for how to get 
things done in a mature manner in our political 
system. Elected government ofﬁ  cials are sup-
posed to set the example for what needs to be 
done and show how to collaborate in a respectable and civil 
way, but we must step up too. One day, we will be the ones 
leading this country. It is up to us to decide if we are going 
to let this political circus continue. 
I urge all students to voice what they believe, whether 
related to politics or to something else. But please, let’s all 
restore mutual respect for those around us. 
This article is particularly important heading into 
Thanksgiving.
I recall watching the news at this time last year with a 
headline, “What to do about politics during Thanksgiving 
dinner.” Really? Is this what we are going let it come to? 
None of us should need lessons on how to minimize politi-
cal tension at a dinner table. 
Leave the political conversations for another day. Just 
enjoy and cherish the ability to celebrate Thanksgiving with 
the ones you love most. 
After all, that’s the only thing that really matters.

don’t look for it 
at UF — yet
On Friday, UF student affairs interim vice president Win 
Phillips sent an email to students addressing two inci-
dents he said were related to racism and anti-Semitisim, 
stating UF “places the highest value on creating a di-
verse, inclusive and welcoming environment.” 
If this statement was any further from the truth, it would be 
across the Paciﬁ  c telling us the Chinese government and citizens 
of Hong Kong are getting along just ﬁ  ne.
Clearly, they’re not, and it’s evident the last thing UF cares 
about is creating an inclusive environment. 
UF does not value diversity, it values its reputation. In terms of 
racial advancement, everything had to be fought for by the Student 
Body, and it’s been a slow process. The statement released by vice 
president Phillips not only undermines this struggle but also over-
looks the current issues the university faces today. 
If diversity was really a top priority, we would do more to 
improve diversity on campus. Yet, when the University of South-
ern California released a study on race and equity in 2018, UF 
received an F on race equity. Only 6.1 percent of students at UF 
are black despite 21.5 percent of Florida residents aged 18 to 24 
being black.
At least the university got a B for its ratio of black faculty 
members to students, but with both being in such low amounts, 
that’s anything but impressive. 
The Student Body clearly needs more cultural representation. 
Luckily, people are actually working toward that. On Nov. 17, 
both the Institute of Black Culture and the Institute of Hispanic-
Latino Cultures, also known as La Casita, were ﬁ  nally reopened 
after their demolition in 2017. The two buildings provide a safe 
space for minority UF students and alumni. Of course, these 
buildings had to be fought for too. From the creation of the two 
buildings to ensuring that there were still two buildings after their 
reconstruction, UF minority students had to ﬁ  ght to keep their 
cultures in existence on campus. 
Although we appreciate UF Multicultural and Diversity Af-
fairs, individual cultures should not be grouped together just be-
cause they are part of a minority group. We have all suffered, but 
in different ways, and that needs to be respected. 
Black traditions aren’t even respected at UF. In Spring 2018, 
black students were aggressively rushed off the stage of the com-
mencement ceremony for performing traditional dances from 
their respective fraternities and sororities. 
What was UF’s response to this?They put the marshall on paid 
administrative leave and gave each college its own ceremony.
It seems like the university doesn’t really know what they’re 
doing regarding racial tensions. Phillips thought it was OK to com-
pare an Israel Defense Force soldier who does not have proof of 
signs calling him a Nazi to a black student who provided evidence 
of being called an n***** — right before the IBC opening ceremo-
ny. It’s sad to say the progress happening at UF is just for show, 
but the leaders at UF have a history of only doing things if it makes 
them look good.
Thank you for your well-written letter, vice president Phillips, 
but next time you should leave the problem solving to the indi-
viduals who are actually trying to make a change. 
The views expressed here are not necessarily those of The Alligator.Kelly

opinions@alligator.orgIn the ﬁ  rst week of November, our presi-
dent was ordered by a state judge to pay 
$2 million in damages to nonproﬁ  t groups. 
This came after he admitted to the misuse 
of funds raised by the Donald J. Trump 
Foundation to promote his run for the presi-
dency, pay off business debts and purchase a 
self-portrait for one of his hotels. The award of 
damages marks the end of a legal battle that’s 
been taking place since 2016 when New York’s 
attorney general accused the Trump family of using the 
foundation for business and campaign purposes. The cash 
in question was raised at a fundraiser intended for veter-
ans in Iowa, which Trump later acknowledged as a cam-
paign event.
This is certainly odd behavior for a man who claims 
to possess a fortune “in excess of TEN BILLION DOL-
LARS” on his campaign website. The mismanagement of 
funds can be explained by ignoring the lies and looking 
at the facts — his fortune is nowhere near what he says 
it is. The Federal Election Commission disclosure from 
his campaign has a conservative estimate of $8.7 billion, 
while Forbes put the value at around $4.5 billion, and 
Trump even regularly lobbies the business magazine to 
increase their estimates of his fortune.
We know that Trump started out with a sizable fortune 
inherited from his father, a prominent real estate devel-
oper, so most of his losses are presumably his own. From 
1985 to 1994, he listed $1.2 billion in losses on his tax 
ﬁ  lings, and in 1985, he swindled his way onto the Forbes 
400 list by creating a fake persona to lie about a trans-fer of wealth from his father. This past August, 
Trump claimed that the presidency was cost-
ing him $3 billion to $5 billion, but that can’t 
be right. Forbes judged his fortune to be just 
$4.5 billion in 2015 and $3.1 billion in the pres-
ent day (a drop of $1.4 billion), and even this 
reduction is attributed to deeper reporting on 
his wealth. Apparently, he lied about the size 
of his New York penthouse, which resulted in 
estimates of his wealth being adjusted.
Most of Trump’s various business ventures are also 
marked with failure. Trump Airlines was launched in 1988 
with a $245 million loan that went toward the purchase of 
a failing airline and the installation of golden ﬁ  xtures in the 
planes’ toilets. It ﬂ  opped in two years. In the same year, 
Trump: The Game launched and sold less than half the 
copies prepared and was taken out of circulation in 1990. 
A year after this failure, Trump started a casino in Atlantic 
City called the Trump Taj Mahal which went $3 billion in 
debt after one year of operation.
All of this history comes together to serve one message: 
Trump doesn’t know what he’s doing when it comes to 
ﬁ  nance. This is alarming, as his business history was one 
of his main selling points during his presidential bid. It’s 
not surprising, though. Just take one look at our impending 
ﬁ  nancial insecurity linked to his senseless trade war with 
China. It doesn’t take an economist to see that the most 
powerful person in the world can’t even run a business 
right.

SHUTTLE TO BE 
AVAILABLE IN SPRING 
By Alex DeLuca
Alligator Staff Writer
Students living in Alachua Coun-
ty's rural communities will soon be 
able to grab a free daily ride to Santa 
Fe College’s main campus. 
Beginning in Spring, Santa Fe Col-
lege will offer free round-trip trans-
portation from towns outside of 
Gainesville to its Northwest Campus 
via the EXTRA Shuttle. 
The shuttle will run each morning 
around 8 a.m. and each afternoon 
around 2 p.m. on weekdays while 
classes are in session, serving the 
Archer, Newberry, High Springs and 
Alachua communities, said Naima 
Brown, vice president for student af-
fairs at Santa Fe College.
The EXTRA Shuttle was designed 
to help out students in rural areas 
who, otherwise, may not have the 
opportunity to access or pursue high-
er education, she said. 
“We know that in our rural areas, 
students who don’t have transporta-tion to get to the college or to one of 
our centers are missing out on this 
chance to improve themselves,” she 
said. 
Shellie Banﬁ  eld, director of the 
Santa Fe College Davis Center in Ar-
cher, said the EXTRA Shuttle service 
will also allow rural students to take 
the Davis Center isn’t large enough 
to provide, such as chemistry, micro-
biology and calculus. 
“It’s really gonna be a great oppor-
tunity for folks to get to those classes 
that right now, we cannot provide 
out of the Davis Center just because 
we don’t have a wet lab,” she said.  
A Santa Fe College student origi-
nally inspired the idea for the shuttle, 
Brown said. The student, who lived 
in Alachua at the time, 
approached the col-
lege’s president and 
expressed a need for 
transit from campus to 
the outer reaches of the 
county. 
Brown said the col-
lege partnered with 
their transportation 
committee, MV Trans-
portation, to work on the project. After two years of ap-
plying to receive a grant for the ser-
vice, the Florida Commission for the 
Transportation Disadvantaged ﬁ  nally 
awarded them the money this year. 
Santa Fe representatives have not 
released the cost of the shuttle as of 
Sunday evening. 
“For all those students that don’t 
have transportation, and that’s been 
a barrier for school for them, we’re 
saying that barrier has been re-
moved,” she said. “Come on to Santa 
Fe.”

There has been a constant on Florida’s 
volleyball team since 2011: the presence 
of at least one Monserez sister. 
The oldest sister, Madison, played at 
UF from 2011 to 2014, then Allie trans-
ferred from South Carolina to Florida for 
the 2015 season and graduated after the 
2018 season, which was also Marlie’s 
freshman year. 
It’s easy to look at the name on the 
back of the jersey and forget that all three 
are their own person. 
But Marlie has developed her own 
game. And she wants everyone to know 
it. 
The Monserez family is loaded with 
athletes. 
Their mother, Patty, played three sports in high school. Their father, 
Mathew, played basketball in college, 
uncle Marty and cousin Mike played bas-
ketball at Butler, cousin Nick was at Le-
high also playing basketball and cousin 
Mathew was a quarterback at Purdue, 
just to name a few. 
Madison and Allie are seven and ﬁ  ve 
years older than Marlie, respectively. 
Growing up, Allie says that Marlie was 
the “best little sister.”
“We would come home from school 
when Marlie was still in Pre-K … and 
she would have snacks ready for us,” she 
said. “She was just the nicest human as 
a young child … She just always had a 
smile on her face and just always wanted 
to do anything for anyone.”
Marlie was often seen on the sidelines 
cheering on her sisters at their tourna-
ments. Playing volleyball just seemed like 
a certainty.
“We always joke I got to play ev-
ery sport under the sun,” Madison said. “I was the ﬁ  rst born, so they were like, 
‘Oh, Madison, you know, try horseback 
riding and try dance,’ and I got to do all 
these different things. Then Allie got to try 
a few things, and then by the time it got 
to Marlie, it was like, ‘Sorry, honey, we 
don’t have time to drive you anywhere 
else, you’re going to play volleyball.’ So 
Marlie’s always been the baller in the 
family.”
But Marlie always wanted to play with 
her sisters. Going outside to bump and 
pepper (volleyball’s version of playing 
catch) with her sisters was a common oc-
currence. 
“We would pepper outside, which 
was fun, but I had to beg (Allie) to do 
that because I was the annoying little sis-
ter,” Marlie said. “But when I did get the 
chance to play with her, it was always re-
ally fun.”
In high school, Marlie was in a famil-
iar situation. She came into a program at

Florida’s football team has met 
both unquestioned success and ab-
ject failure over the last four years.
The highs: an SEC Championship 
Game appearance in 2016, a Peach 
Bowl victory in 2018 and a 9-2 re-
cord this year.
The lows: off-the-ﬁ  eld issues, the 
ﬁ  ring of coach Jim McElwain mid-
season and a losing record in 2017, 
plus three losses apiece to Florida 
State and Georgia.
When the Gators host FSU on 
Saturday, their 22 seniors will have 
one last chance to leave their mark 
in Ben Hill Grifﬁ  n Stadium.
“I’ve had a long four years, and 
it’s been good times, bad times, but 
ain’t nothing like running out there 
your last time,” senior running back Lamical Perine said. “That’s the best 
feeling right there.”
As freshmen in 2016, these se-
niors contributed to an Outback 
Bowl win and a No. 14 ranking in 
the ﬁ  nal AP Poll.
In those players’ second season, 
Florida looked poised for a break-
out year, but a preseason credit card 
fraud scandal and a sleep-inducing 
offense led to one of the worst sea-
sons in program history (4-7 record) 
and the hiring of Dan Mullen as 
coach.
As juniors, they helped a UF team 
that began the season unranked re-
turn to national prominence with a 
10-3 season and a No. 6 ranking in 
the ﬁ  nal Coaches Poll. They contin-
ued that momentum into this year, 
and a win against FSU would almost 
certainly lead to another New Year’s Six bowl appearance.
“We’ve got to go out there and 
give it our all for (the seniors). Send 
them out on top,” redshirt senior 
center Nick Buchanan said. “We 
haven’t beat FSU at home in a while, 
so it’s time for us to show up.”
Ten years, to be exact. That’s 
when Tim Tebow accounted for ﬁ  ve 
touchdowns, and the No. 1 Gators 
cruised to a 37-10 victory. UF has 
won just two of the nine games vs. 
FSU this decade, both coming in Tal-
lahassee (2012 and 2018).
“Obviously, growing up a Florida 
fan I never really liked FSU too much. 
Kind of hated them. I wouldn’t say 
there’s a lot of bad blood or anything 
between us. It’s just a great rivalry, 
has always been,” redshirt senior 
punter Tommy Townsend said. “I’m 
just excited to go out there and get 
my ﬁ  nal game in The Swamp and go 
out on a good note.”
One more game in Gainesville. One last chance to get a home win 
over the ‘Noles. One more opportu-
nity to cement their legacy.
“Very emotional, teary-eyed,” 
Perine said on what he expects his 
ﬁ  nal run through the tunnel to be like. “Just knowing it’s going to be 
my last time running out there, man, 
just going to be crazy.”

Down by three with 13 seconds 
left in the game, Xavier forward 
Paul Scruggs launched a desperate 
three-point shot into the air.
The Xavier bench stood up to 
watch. The ball bounced once, 
twice, and fell away from the rim on the third time and landed into 
the hands of the Florida Gators, the 
Musketeers bench fell back to their 
seats in defeat.
UF staved off its second late-
game comeback attempt of the 
Charleston Classic to defeat the 
Xavier Musketeers 70-65 and grab 
its ﬁ  fth win of the season. The Gators are the ﬁ  rst SEC team to ever 
win the Charleston Classic.
Florida played the best basket-
ball it has all season in the ﬁ  rst half 
of the contest.
The Gators went 64 percent from 
the ﬁ  eld, the best they’ve shot in 
the ﬁ  rst 20 minutes all season. UF 
spread the ball around, as the lead-ing scorer for the half was a three-
way tie at nine points between 
graduate transfer Kerry Blackshear 
Jr. and sophomores Keyontae John-
son and Andrew Nembhard. 
Blackshear Jr. — who just two 
games ago was ejected after playing 
only ﬁ  ve minutes — netted four re-
bounds and two assists while going 4 for 7 from the ﬁ  eld.
Florida also capitalized on the 
defensive side of the ball. Xavier 
turned the ball over 10 times in the 
ﬁ  rst half, and the Gators scored 13 
points off those turnovers. UF also 
had 11 defensive rebounds, and the 
combination of improved shooting Gators defeat Xavier Musketeers, win Charleston Classic

VOLLEYBALL

The disparity between the top two 
teams in the SEC and the rest of the 
conference was on full display Sunday 
afternoon. 
Kentucky and Florida currently top 
the conference, with the Wildcats in 
control after sweeping the Gators in 
the season series. 
Georgia came into its match against 
UF sitting at third place in the SEC 
standings with an 11-5 record and the 
31st-best RPI in the country. The Bull-
dogs managed to take a set against the 
Gators in Gainesville in September, so 
a rematch in Athens, Georgia, seemed 
like it would be a good matchup. 
But that was not the case on Sun-
day. 
The No. 15 Gators swept the Bull-
dogs (25-13, 25-14, 25-13) with ease. 
Florida hit .513 in the match, its high-
est mark this season, and ﬁ  nished off Georgia in just an hour and 10 minutes. 
Middle blocker Rachael Kramer 
was unstoppable against the Bulldogs 
(19-9, 11-6 SEC), scoring 14 kills on 20 
attacks with no errors. Redshirt junior 
Holly Carlton was the only other Gator 
with double-digit kills — notching 10 
on 15 attempts — and also didn’t com-
mit any errors. 
Errors were few and far between 
for Florida (23-4, 14-2 SEC). UF had 
only three errors in the entire match, 
and all of them came in the second 
set. On the other hand, Georgia had 
just seven more assists (23) than it 
had attack errors (16). 
Of the four Florida attackers that 
notched at least 10 attacks, outside 
hitter Thayer Hall had the lowest hit-
ting percentage, still at a respectable 
.300.
The Bulldogs didn’t register a sin-
gle block against the Gators, who had 
11 on Sunday. 
Each of the three sets in the match largely played out the same way. The 
sweep featured Florida hitting at a 
high rate (its .367 hitting percentage 
in the second set was its lowest), suf-
focating Georgia defensively (the Bull-
dogs hit .120) and limiting mistakes. 
The Gators’ best frame came in the 
third set when they hit an unfathom-
able .813 on 16 attacks with no errors. 
The defense tacked on three blocks as 
well. 
UF led 9-7 in the frame before scor-
ing 16 of the match’s last 22 points. 
The Gators improved to 48-4 in three-
set matches against the Bulldogs and 
66-9 in the all-time series. 
“This was one of our most com-
plete matches of the season,” coach 
Mary Wise in a release. “We had great 
focus and production from everyone 
— not just in the match, but with the 
preparation leading up to the match.”

WOMEN’S BASKETBALL

Florida’s women’s basketball team was 
undefeated heading into Friday’s battle 
against No. 18 Indiana. Up to that point, 
the Gators had defeated four unranked op-
ponents by an average margin of victory of 
18.5 points per game. 
The Hoosiers, however, were a much 
more difﬁ  cult test for UF, especially with 
starting shooting guard Lavender Briggs 
out of the lineup with a high ankle sprain.
As Briggs watched from the bench — 
wearing a protective boot on her injured 
foot — Indiana overpowered Florida 73-49 
at the O’Connell Center.
“When you have a young bunch, there’s 
a lot of different implications that could af-
fect your team,” coach Cam Newbauer said 
about playing without Briggs. “It’s part of 
the game, and you just have to go play.”
Guard Ariel Johnson stepped up on the offensive side of the ball with the team’s 
second-leading scorer out. The sopho-
more ﬁ  nished with 10 points behind 4-of-
12 shooting from the ﬁ  eld while logging a 
career-high 35 minutes.
The Tracy, California, native has come 
on as of late after scoring a combined ﬁ  ve 
points on 7.1 percent (1-of-14) shooting 
through the team’s ﬁ  rst two games. But 
Johnson has recorded double-digit points 
in each of her last three outings.
“I wouldn’t say it was a slow start, she 
was trying to ﬁ  gure out the mindset of how 
to perform knowing that she may have to 
do a little more here and there,” Newbauer 
said. “As a sophomore and never being in 
that role, for her to ﬁ  gure that out after two 
games and having the last three being what 
they are, it’s just a huge sign of maturity 
for such a young person that kind of got 
thrown into that because of an injury.”
Things won’t get any easier for the 
Gators, as 12th-ranked Florida State comes to Gainesville for the Sunshine Showdown.
The Seminoles are in the midst of a 
ﬁ  ve-game winning streak because of a 
high-octane offense that runs through 
three players: guards Nausia Woolfolk and 
Nicki Ekhomu and forward Kiah Gillespie. 
Woolfolk averages a team-high 16 points 
per game, with Ekhomu and Gillespie con-
tributing 15.6 and 13.2 points per game, 
respectively.
The trio accounts for 55 percent (44.8 
points per game) of the team’s scoring of-
fense, which is ranked 29th in the nation 
with 81.4 points per contest.
UF’s last triumph over a top-25 team 
came in 2016 when it knocked off No. 12 
Texas A&M 83-81 at the O’Dome. So Flori-
da will need good showings from Johnson 
and its defense if it wants to take down a 
surging FSU.

12   ALLIGATOR    MONDAY, NOVEMBER 25, 2019
Bishop Moore Catholic School. Mad-
ison was a two-time all-state selec-
tion there and Allie was a two-time 
MaxPreps First-Team High School 
All-American, winning two state 
championships. 
Marlie ended up leaving a mark 
on the program, as well, matching 
Allie’s two state championships. She 
also earned Florida Miss Volleyball 
and Gatorade Florida Player of the 
Year in 2017, too. 
Marlie’s recruiting process was 
also complicated by her sisters. 
She was in attendance at the 
O’Dome when Allie, then playing 
for South Carolina, faced Madison’s 
Gators on Madison’s Senior Night 
in 2014. The entire family and its 
friends showed up to watch Allie 
walk with Madison during the Se-
nior Night festivities and witness the 
Gators sweep the Gamecocks. 
Following that match, however, 
the sisters started to move in differ-
ent directions. Madison graduated, 
Allie was transferring from South 
Carolina and Marlie was thinking 
about what college she wanted to 
commit to. 
Allie chose the Gators as a trans-
fer. Marlie was already thinking 
about committing to Florida, but her 
sister’s transfer made things more 
complicated. 
“(Before Allie committed) I was 
not worried, but I was thinking ‘Oh 
no, I’m going to be in the shadow 
of my oldest sister who hasn’t been 
here for three years,’” Marlie said. 
“And then right before I committed, 
(Allie) committed, so then it was 
kind of like, well, if I can get over 
being (Madison’s) little sister, then I 
can get over being Allie’s little sister 
as well.” 
Marlie’s decision to commit to UF 
surprised Allie.
“I committed to Florida, we’re all so excited,” Allie said. “And then I 
got there in June, and I remember 
we got into the car after she came 
to Florida camp, and we just were 
in the car, and she said, ‘Oh, by the 
way, I committed.’
“At ﬁ  rst, I was shocked, and 
then it just ended up being the most 
amazing thing.”
The age gap between Allie and 
Marlie meant that they had never 
played with each other in a competi-
tive setting, but because Allie was 
transferring inside of the conference 
and had to redshirt for a year, Marlie 
was ﬁ  nally going to play with her 
older sister for the ﬁ  rst time. 
As it turned out, Marlie would 
be in multiple players’ shadows. In 
addition to playing with her older 
sister, she was joined by the No. 1 
player in her recruiting class: Thayer 
Hall. 
Hall, Marlie, middle blocker 
Lauren Dooley and right side hitter 
Haley Warner were the four signees 
that made up Florida’s 2018 
class that ﬁ  nished second in 
the country. 
Marlie and Hall play differ-
ent positions, but it would still 
be easy to feel overlooked. 
“I think that it’s just an 
amazing opportunity to play 
with (Hall),” Marlie said. “I 
think that having such a high-
ly ranked recruiting class just 
shows that we all want to be 
here and that we’re all good 
coming into this.”
The younger Monserez at-
tacked and set her senior year 
of high school, but she transi-
tioned to  solely playing setter 
for Florida. Which also meant 
that she was behind Allie for 
playing time. 
But rather than being too competitive, Allie was always will-
ing to give her sister feedback. 
“I learned so much from Allie, she 
is just a rock,” Marlie said. “She’s 
just one of the best teammates I’ve 
ever had, not only being my sister, 
but she’s just an amazing teammate 
as well.”
The experience also brought the 
sisters closer than they had ever been 
before. Their relationship strength-
ened when Marlie was a senior in 
high school and knew that they were 
going to be with each other the fol-
lowing year in Gainesville. Allie 
thinks that they spent more time to-
gether during that season than ever 
before. 
“When she actually got (to UF) 
in the summer, from the ﬁ  rst day, it 
was one of the best things that could 
have happened,” she said. “Just the 
way that we bonded on a complete-
ly different level in a way that we 
would have never been able to do in 
any other situation.”
Marlie introduced herself to Flor-
ida fans quickly. She registered 52 
assists, 11 more than Allie, in her ﬁ  rst two collegiate matches against 
then-No. 2 Nebraska and then-No. 
3 Texas. 
Marlie only hit the 20-assist mark 
once the rest of the season, but she 
clearly showed that the talent was 
there. 
But despite a 26-7 season, the 
Gators were bounced in the round of 
16, Allie graduated and soon Marlie 
was the sole Monserez remaining. 
For all the talk about casting 
shadows, Marlie casts the largest 
one. Literally. Standing at 6-foot, the 
youngest Monserez dwarfs her older 
sisters and combines that with a long 
wingspan.
“You can’t say enough about 
the difference in length,” Wise said. 
“Not just how tall she is, but she has 
these really long arms, and so she 
plays taller than she is.
“She’s terriﬁ  c at playing balls that 
are tight to the net because of her 
length, she’s got great footspeed.”
And that’s one of the ways that 
Marlie’s game has been different 
than what her sisters brought to the 
table during their respective tenures. 
Marlie’s ability to play the front row has changed  Florida’s offensive and 
defensive play. She’s amassed 46 
blocks so far this season and ﬁ  nished 
nine matches with at least 10 digs. 
Wise’s conﬁ  dence in Marlie’s de-
fending and setting abilities allowed 
the Gators to move from the 6-2 of-
fense to the 5-1 offense this season. 
“(Last year) she (was) a fresh-
man learning from a senior who just 
happened to be her sister but is only 
playing three rotations in the offense 
we ran,” Wise said. “Now, in the 
5-1 offense, she’s involved in every 
single rotation, every single rally, 
touches the ball, but she could go all 
day.”
Her extra height also gives her ad-
vantages in other parts of the game, 
like having a higher touch point and 
making dumps easier. 
Additionally, Marlie has served 
the ball a lot more this year in the 
5-1 offense, and she has 11 aces this 
season.

,
and solid defense allowed it to enter 
the intermission with a 39-29 lead.
Despite keeping up the pace in 
the second half, UF’s play saw a 
decline.
Whereas three Florida players 
hit the nine-point mark in the ﬁ  rst 
half, the Gators’ leading scorer in 
the second half, freshman Ques 
Glover, could only hit seven. Both 
UF’s second-half ﬁ  eld goal per-
centage (43.5) and three-point percentage (36.4) dropped from 
the ﬁ  rst half.
It was within the last ﬁ  ve min-
utes where the Gators’ lead began 
to waver. Xavier went on a 9-1 run 
that ended when guard Quentin 
Goodin hit a trey with 1:09 remain-
ing that put the Musketeers within 
three in the ﬁ  nal stretch.
After Scruggs’ miss, however, 
two Blackshear Jr. free throws put 
the game out of reach with eight seconds remaining.
Blackshear Jr. was the team’s 
most notable performer, recording 
a double-double with 14 points, 
10 rebounds and two assists. 
The Gators’ leading scorers were 
Nembhard and Johnson, who both 
grabbed 15 points in the contest.
UF will return to the O’Connell 
Center on Friday to face the Mar-
shall Thundering Herd at 9 p.m.
