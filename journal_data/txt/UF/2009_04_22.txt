� STUDENTS PROTESTED CUT 
DIVERSITY, CULTURAL PROGRAMS.
By CHELSEA KEENAN
Alligator Writer
 
About 200 students donned black shirts 
and surgical masks with stickers reading Day of Silence Tuesday, in honor of the vow of silence they took oppose UF budget and 
program cuts.
The twelve-hour muted spectacle was 
part of a Week of Action, where student 
senators and other organizational members 
decided to stand up against the administra-tion’s decision to cut  the center for Multicul-tural Diversity and Affairs, as well as UF’s 
Center for Leadership and Service, which are both housed in the Dean of Student’s Of-fice.  
The idea to keep quiet stemmed from a 
National Day of Silence held 
last Friday, which symbolized 
how the Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual and Transgender community’s 
voice is ignored.
UF women’s studies senior Evan Laut-eria, who is the educational awareness chair 
for the Pride Student Union, said many of 
the group’s members participated in Tues-
day’s silent day as a part of Pride Awareness 
Month and to protest budget cuts. 
“I think, that bearing in mind it was last 
minute and students are studying for exams, 
it was roaring success,” Lauteria said.

Jaime Christian hands Stacy Tuttle her free Oatmeal Cookie Chunk ice cream cone with sprinkles for Free Cone 
Day at the Ben & Jerry’s on West University Avenue on Tuesday afternoon.

Thousands of people flocked 
to two local Ben & Jerry’s ice 
cream shops Tuesday for the company’s 29th annual Free 
Cone Day. 
The giveaway benefited the 
Alachua County Public School Foundation for the fourth con-
secutive year. And on UF’s campus, sweet news traveled 
fast.
At University Avenue loca-
tion, the warm spring weather, 
sugary smells and the prom-ise of a free frozen treat kept a steady line of students spilling 
out of the store and down the 
entire block.“It always gets more crowd-
ed in between classes,” Kelley Kostamo said. “And today is such a beautiful day.”
Kostamo is the partnering 
specialist for Alachua County Public Schools. She and other 
volunteers scooped for tips to 
fund school programs. The ice cream was free, but a $1 dona-
tion bought a topping and $4 
donation granted a waffle-cone upgrade.
Inside the cramped and 
buzzing store, customers could choose between imaginative 
flavors like Whirled Peace, 
Strawberry Kiwi Sorbet and Yellow Brickle Road. Some stu-
dents immediately returned to Free Cone Day

According to details of budget proposals 
obtained this week, UF is considering cuts to 
book and journal purchasing by the libraries as well as financial aid and research awards.
The provost’s office has proposed $4.9 mil-
lion cut, with $2 million coming from the Grad Alumni program, which was scheduled to receive the money from UF’s National Merit Scholars program, UF Provost Joe Glover said.
Since UF has shifted its focus away from re-
cruiting as many National Merit scholars, the program has extra money, which would have been given to the alumni program, Glover said.
He said he also proposed a 10 percent cut 
to financial aid money that comes through his office, though he said it didn’t amount to much and would be more than made up by the extra money that is expected to come in through the differential tuition bill in the state 
Legislature.
The bill requires that the 
equivalent of 30 percent of the funds generated through the extra tuition payments be used for financial aid.
The provost’s proposal 
also eliminates funding for the Employee Education Program, which allows 
UF employees to take classes paid for by the university. Employees will still be able to take classes, but the state wouldn’t reimburse UF for the cost of tuition anymore, Glover said.
The University Scholars Program, in which 
students work with UF faculty on research projects, would also receive a 10 percent cut, which could result in lower stipends for stu-dents.
The proposal also calls for three staff lay-
offs, the elimination of 15 vacant positions and 
Provost’s office proposes $4.9M in cuts

A UF student was arrested Monday and 
charged with six drug-related felonies after offi-
cials found marijuana, crack cocaine and prescrip-tion drugs in his possession.  At about 11 p.m., an Alachua County Sheriff’s officer saw David Janson, 23, standing on the corner near 4500 S.W. 91st St.  According to the ASO arrest report, when Janson saw the ASO officer, he showed signs of nervousness by walking away and looking over his shoulder to see if he was being followed.
When the officer approached Janson, he found a multicolored glass pipe in his front pocket, which Janson admitted to recently smoking mari-juana out of, the report stated. Janson told the officer that he had prescription medication, mari-juana and other narcotics in his apartment.
After Janson signed a Voluntary Consent to 
Search Form, the officer searched his apartment and found marijuana, a straw cocaine and pre-scription pills. He was charged with five mide-meanors and six felonies.

Eyes darting, his fast pace gets 
faster. He’s mumbling. It’s around 
here somewhere, within 12 feet or 
so, he says. Check under the rock. 
Check in the dirt. Check the coordi-nates. Check the rock again. 
“Found it!”With his nearly $250 hand-held 
global positioning system, UF stu-dent Will Dueease uncovered the hidden treasure. It was lodged in a rock near the UF law school.
The treasure itself wasn’t much 
— a tiny metallic monkey pendant and a long list of names inside a photo film canister. But the prize isn’t really the point. After signing his name below the tens of others who came before him, Dueease put the canister back.
It’s a search for the sake of search-
ing.
A couple of times a week, when 
he gets bored, or when it’s a nice day or when he feels like exploring a new place, Dueease goes on one of these high-tech hunts, dubbed “geo-caches.”
He starts online, where others 
log the coordinates of treasures they 
hide, along with clues or sometimes 
cash prizes for the first finder. 
Then Dueease plugs the location 
into his GPS system and hits the streets. According to www.geocach-ing.com, the self-proclaimed official cache site and the one Dueease uses, the activity began in 2000 when for-mer President Bill Clinton discon-tinued an act that forced satellites to weaken their signals. The weakening was meant to beef up national secu-
rity, but Clinton’s administration 
found that it had minimal results. 
Because of that decision, GPS 
systems were able to pinpoint spe-cific locations more accurately, and geocaching was born.
Its name is a combination of 
“geo,” meaning “geography,” and “cache,” a French word for “hiding 
place,” the site states.
There are now more than 780,000 
active geocaches around the world, 
according to the site. That’s up from about 75 when the site started keep-ing track in 2000. About two million 
to three million people are in on the 
game.
“There’s no goal,” Dueease said, 
pausing to take a sip from his Cam-elbak, a water-dispensing backpack, one recent geocaching afternoon. “People just do it because, well, it’s fun. It’s goofy.”
UF grounds superintendent Mar-
ty Werts said his employees find strange items on campus “all the time,” but he can’t recall anybody finding film canisters holding odds and ends or little lists of names.
Still, they’re out there. Duee-
ase guesses there are now about 30 caches on campus and thousands of others in the Gainesville area.
According to online maps, there 
are also caches waiting in France, It-aly, Antarctica, Laos, Zimbabwe and pretty much anywhere in between.
Dueease knows firsthand. On a recent vacation to California, 
he and his dad, Bill Dueease, found a cache hidden on the Golden Gate Bridge. Near the big, white Holly-
wood sign, they found a special coin 
with a serial number to track its lo-cation online. It had traveled all the way from South Carolina. 
“That little sucker had been 
around,” the elder Dueease said in a phone interview.
Dueease owns a life-coaching 
business in Fort Lauderdale called 
The Coach Connection. When his 
son first told him about geocach-ing, he recalled thinking, “What the heck? Why would anybody want to leave something out in the middle of nowhere?”
He changed his mind after giving 
it a try. Besides the quality time with his son, Dueease said the best part of geocaching is the teamwork. 
“It’s a blast. It’s an adventure, 
you know?”
Shauna Maggs, spokeswoman 
for Groundspeak, the company that operates the geocaching site, said-caches should never be buried, in in-terest of preserving natural habitats.
“They should be containers hid-
den in plain sight,” she said. 
The United States is now the most 
popular location for geocaching. 
Other top spots include the United Kingdom, Germany, the Czech Re-
public and Canada. 
“It’s a good way to know a new 
place,” Maggs said. “It’s never about what’s found. It’s more about the ex-perience of the journey.”
Will Dueease agrees.He now explores places he’s nev-
er been and appreciates Florida’s 
outdoors. There’s the adventure 
part, too, and feeling like he’s part of “a weird club or something.”
Of course, there are times when 
he doesn’t find what he came for. Wind and rain can dislodge caches, or non-geocachers, known as “mug-gles,” could find and take the prize without knowing any better.
“It kind of sucks,” Dueease said 
of an unfruitful search. “You’re like, ‘Awww, was it really there, or did it get vandalized, or do I just suck at finding them, or is it a combination of the three?’”
But he said the majority of hunts 
end happily. 
After finding the little metal 
monkey at the Alfred A. Ring Ten-nis Complex, a hunt named “Lord of the Ring” by whoever set it up, Dueease positioned his GPS for another cache. This one was called 
“By Bike or by Hike” and led him to 
an overgrown trail near Fraternity Row. Swatting away mosquitoes and untangling himself from spider webs, Dueease failed to notice the poison ivy brushing his ankles.
“I guess that’s the danger of this 
game,” he said, chuckling.
Finally, from behind the stump 
of a big dead tree, Dueease hoisted a gallon-sized black canister from the dirt. “Sweet!”
Inside the jug, he found a plastic 
toy cow, a frequent-buyer punch card for a restaurant he hadn’t heard of, a pink drink coozie and a little blue notebook. He scrawled a sig-nature and date below the last log, someone who’d been there a month before. Dueease always hunts with friends but thinks it’d be cool to run into one of those mysterious fellow searchers. Then again, maybe not.
Dueease admits that marching 
around campus with his GPS and rooting under rocks for hidden trea-sure is “moderately embarrassing.”
“No girls are like, ‘Wow, that’s 
really hot,’ and I can’t really go to a club and impress people with my geocaching skills,” Dueease said. “It’s nerdy, is it not? This is so 
lame.”
A glance down at the GPS. The 
arrow’s pointing that-a-way. Duee-
ase smiles. 
“Aw, I love it.”

UF students have expressed 
mixed reactions to the possibility 
of an earlier Spring Break, which would go into effect in 2011-2012 if 
the Faculty Senate votes to make the 
change next month.
Bernard Mair, UF’s associate pro-
vost for undergraduate affairs, told faculty at Thursday’s Senate meet-ing that UF is considering moving Spring Break up a week so it falls exactly in the middle of the spring semester.
The Senate is in charge of creat-
ing UF’s academic calendar.
Some students said they’re ex-
cited about the possible change.
Statistics graduate student Dem-
etris Athienitis said an earlier break would make for better skiing.
“In Florida we have plenty of hot 
weather, so I look to go somewhere 
where it’s cold,” he said.
UF freshman Kendall Johnson 
said he likes the idea of having the 
break right in the middle of the se-mester because classes after Spring Break would feel less rushed.
“I like it being even,” he said.But other students were peeved 
by the proposal.
UF freshman Shaniqua Thompo-son said she thinks an earlier break could mean colder weather, which is the opposite of what spring break is about.
“How are you supposed to go 
to the beach and do all your Spring Break activities if it’s cold?” Thomp-son said.
One bonus of having the break 
earlier in the semester, she said, would be that she would have more of her financial aid money left.
“You would have more money to 
spend,” she said. “But what would you spend it on?”
“It’s cold, so where are you go-
ing?” she said.
Other students were indifferent.
“I don’t really do much on spring 
break, so it doesn’t make a differ-
ence,” said UF sophomore Christina Ruiz.
“I don’t care,” said UF statis-
tics graduate student Anestis Tou-loumis. “It’s one week off either way.”ADMINISTRATION
UF debates change

UF’s Counseling Center has noted an increase 
in students seeking and being referred to its ser-
vices in the last year, keeping with a national trend, according an article in the Chronicle of Higher Education.
The nearly two-decade-old counseling system, 
which was implemented after Danny Rolling murdered five students in August of 1990, puts UF “ahead of other universities,” said Sherry Ben-ton, director of the Center.
Benton said the university uses a method 
called “Question, Persuade and Refer,” to educate UF faculty, staff and students on how to identify signs of mental distress. Alongside this method, 
informational folders are given to all faculty and 
staff when they sign on to work at UF.
The folders contain steps for dealing with dis-
tressed or disruptive students and include a list of contacts. The training process is mandatory for UF faculty and staff and free for students.
Faculty are told to look for out-of-the-ordinary 
behavior, including visible anxiety and anger.
According to the 2008 Healthy Gators Student 
Survey, 54.3 percent of student participants cited experiencing extreme anxiety, while 31.3 percent experienced debilitating depression in the last 12 months. However, only 7.7 percent of those stu-dents were professionally diagnosed with anxi-ety, while 6.9 percent of those surveyed were pro-fessionally diagnosed with depression.
In managing their stress, 4.6 percent of stu-
dents surveyed reported having become physi-
cally aggressive with a person, animal or object to reduce stress in the 30 days prior to taking the survey.
The emphasis on mental health at universities 
has risen in the wake of school tragedies, such as 
the 2007 shootings at Virginia Technical Institute in Blacksburg. New programs have been imple-mented to teach faculty and staff how to better identify students who may have mental issues.
One program, called “At-Risk,” was released 
earlier this year by Kognito Interactive.
The online program allows faculty to have 
simulated conversations with virtual students and attempt to identify those with indicators of 
mental distress, according to Ron Goldman, CEO of the company.
When asked about such pro-
grams, Benton said she took issue with their cost and quality.
“I get a little nervous about these things,” she 
said. “They can be slightly over-the-top, especial-ly after Virginia Tech.”
Benton said she fears that when people use 
simulators like these, people may misread certain behaviors and start recommending the wrong people for treatment.
“When you identify people wrongly, you get a 
lot of liability,” she said.
The Virginia Tech shootings also prompted 
some companies to capitalize on a heightened sense of worry, she said.
The cost, which is about $5,000 to teach 500 fac-
ulty and staff members via Kognito Interactive, is expensive, said Benton, who added UF paid of a flat fee of $30 per trainer to certify trainers for its training system.
“There are other avenues to get the same infor-
mation without the money,” she said.Demand up for UF counseling

trusty junk-food drawers (Kit-Kats on the reg) which will re-main fully stocked until the Appliance Direct lady sings.
Somewhere Liz Lemon (oh, so hot) is feeling all warm and 
tingly inside for the shout-out.
Before we “write off” to the big newsroom in the sky, the De-
partment of Darts & Laurels proudly presents this week’s just-when-you-think-you’re-out-they-pull-you-back-in edition of...
Darts & Laurels
Thanks to an economy teetering on utter disaster, the fate of 
public universities across the state of Florida remains in ques-tion, with perhaps none more pressing than our own. For poten-tially ending the careers of talented faculty and forcing students to reconsider their intended course of study, the Department of 
Darts & Laurels tosses a we-don’t-even-want-to-imagine-what-
UF-is-going-to-turn-into DART at budget cuts. With so much 
of what makes UF great hanging by a thread, we can only hope President Bernie Machen can properly remedy the situation while keeping the future in mind.
From securing the BCS national championship to being 
the subject of one of the most hilarious guest columns in the esteemed history of The Independent Florida Alligator (see Page 7), No. 15 has won over the legion of fans who call North 
Central Florida home. The Department of Darts & Laurels 
awards a read-Tuesday’s-editorial-if-you-have-any-doubts-about-this-guy LAUREL to Tim Tebow for everything he has 
accomplished both on and off the field in the name of The Gator Nation. While his prowess on the football field remains unpar-alleled, Tebow’s greatest gift is his drive to help others.
And have you seen “Treebow”?With sorority girls botching beer robberies from medio-
cre grocery stores (rhymes with “meat tray”) and carjackings 
aplenty, the semester has offered a smörgåsbord of the finest 
in after-hours debauchery. From providing us with a hearty chuckle to keeping us up late at night fearing for our Ford Mus-tang, the Department of Darts & Laurels chucks a we’ve-never-been-so-afraid-to-take-a-shower-without-a-baseball-bat-nearby DART at Gainesville crime. What’s a better way to start your 
day than to peruse the latest in Gainesville fine art that magi-cally appeared on your front door overnight?
From correctly selecting the eventual March Madness cham-
pion to rubbing elbows with world big-wigs at the G-20 sum-mit, the new commander in chief certainly has some fans over at the ol’ Alligator newsroom. The Department of Darts & Laurels presents a we-love-what-you-have-done-and-are-confident-you-will-continue-to-wow-us LAUREL to President Barack 
Obama for making a name for himself in fewer than 100 days in the White House. Now if only he could do something about making the day after the Super Bowl a national holiday... 
Hmm, maybe if the Bears make a run?
With shopping malls so quiet you could hear a mouse fart, 
America’s financial crisis has rocked news headlines all semes-
ter long like an awkward phone conversation with a disturbing-ly chatty friend. For leaving MBA-clad professionals jobless and middle-class families on the street, the Department of Darts & Laurels launches a we-may-or-may-not-have-applied-for-food-stamps-this-semester DART at economic downturn. Nothing 
screams broke as a joke more than turning to a brown-bagged bottle of “Big Jug” malt liquor (yum!) to get your drink on.
“A rich, full flavor...a smooth, mellow taste”From the frustrations of a server-on-the-fritz circa day one 
to the joy we shared laughing about the perfect marriage of rap and politics, one constant has remained through and through.
The Department of Darts & Laurels extends a we-are-truly-
nothing-without-your-loyal-support LAUREL to the readers of 
the Alligator for coming along for the journey otherwise known as spring semester 2009. Love us or hate us, you guys and gals sure are swell in our book.
That’s all for this semester. And remember, if you have a 
truck, you are the man.She’s never even heard of YouTube, but the video of

rock for the past couple of weeks, Boyle is a 47-year-old 
Scotswoman who wowed both the judges and a live au-
dience with her rendition of “I Dreamed a Dream” from “Les Miserables.”
Boyle’s voice — albeit skilled — could have come out 
of almost anybody, but it came out of her. She certainly 
isn’t a contender for “America’s Next Top Model,” with 
her frizzy hair, matronly attire and thick eyebrows — but Boyle walked onto that stage with nothing but a prere-corded instrumental track and an audience with very low 
expectations. Needless to say, she blew them all out of the 
water.
She opened her mouth to sing, and it took about three 
seconds before the cheers erupted. Simon Cowell, Mr. Grumpus himself, even replaced his trademark unim-
pressed stare to a soft smile, watching her perform as she 
received a standing ovation from the audience. Wait, does Boyle have magical powers that render Cowell — dare I say it — human?
Someone obviously knew what this woman sounded 
like. Boyle had to audition in front of the show’s produc-ers, but unless the judges were able to feign amazement that well, they had no idea the unassuming woman hold-ing the microphone would shatter their preconceived no-
tions about her.
And while people are being charmed the world over by 
Boyle, her performance was a loud wake-up call.Society has been bombarded 
with a large number of “isms” — 
ageism, sexism and what I’d like 
to call “Plain Jane-ism.” Despite 
all of this, Boyle had the courage to get up on that stage and unabash-edly show the judges just what 
she could do. She’s not a pretty, 
young, slim, cookie-cutter blonde; she’s well over the defined age that 
a starlet should be, and she only shares her bed with her 10-year-old cat, Pebbles.
Can old, celibate and frumpy be talented? Perhaps now 
we’ll be able to pick singers by just that: their ability to sing, and not how young, curvy and manicured they are.
I’ve watched the now-famous YouTube video a hand-
ful of times, and each time, it brings tears to my eyes that I tend to save for “Extreme Makeover: Home Edition.” I’ll admit to not knowing much about music, but it’s not Boyle’s intonation or her range that truly make her per-formance the sensation that it’s become. It’s her boldness 
in how she belted out the lyrics with a smile on her face, 
knowing that she had surprised everyone.
With all the gloom and doom in the world, it’s refresh-
ing to see so much international support for Boyle. Her fan 
club Web site, which warns to “never judge a book by its 
cover,” has more than 13,000 members, culminating in a feel-good site that exudes collective joy.
This “never-been-kissed” church lady is proof that 
sometimes when you least expect it, the underdog does 
triumph.

Well, it seems the Alligator is once 
again on an all Kool-Aid diet. Noth-
ing else would explain the 600-
word fellating this paper gave Tim Tebow on 
Tuesday. See, I like to think most people in 
the communications field are bright enough 
to notice a PR move when they see one.
You think Tim Tebow does charity events 
because that’s the first thing he wants to do on a Saturday afternoon? Sure, it’s possible, 
but how many more jerseys and “The Prom-
ise” T-shirts does UF sell when they can claim to have Gandhi in a helmet walking 
around the campus? How many more na-
tional TV games do the Gators get because America wants to see a great humanitarian playing football instead of the usual collec-
tions of criminals some schools are made out 
to employ?
Either that or St. Timothy of Jacksonville 
had a little conversation with someone in the know about his potential career. Perhaps the 
guy who is his agent-but-not-really-because-
Tim-Tebow-and-Urban-Meyer-never-break-rules-so-it’s-obviously-not-his-agent said, 
“Hey Timmy, right now you are predicted 
to be drafted somewhere in the early fifth round, and the debate now is about whose ca-
reer will be longer, yours or Eric Crouch’s.”
And Timothy said unto him, “Jesus would like to know what 
in the name of Je-
sus I can do to be 
drafted on Jesus’ 
holy first day of the draft? Because I can’t be 
picked on Sunday, that is Jesus’ day.”
“Well, if Warren Sapp can lose half of a 
round for smoking pot, maybe you can pick 
up half of a round for creating charity events for no reason whatsoever. You do one a 
month from now until next April, and you’re 
headed to the Lions in the second round. If not, how do you feel about Saskatchewan?”
I’m sure Tim Tebow is a good enough 
guy, but let’s not anoint him anything more than what he is: a really good college football player. You want a true humanitarian? How 
‘bout Tony Romo? That guy takes bums to 
the movies and doesn’t make a giant public spectacle out of it. 
You wanna create yourself a real humani-
tarian, UF? How about telling “San Timo-
teo” to go out and do good without a camera 
crew around? Then maybe he can get himself picked on Saturday, and ESPN won’t have to 
spend the next morning in church with the 
Tebows waiting to see if he ends up being Mr. Irrelevant.

A Gainesville man was arrested in connection with the 
robbery of a local Walgreens Monday afternoon. 
At about 2:35 p.m., the man walked up to the Walgreens 
counter at 1170 E. University Ave. and demanded money 
from the cashier.
According to the Gainesville Police Department arrest 
report, Hines told the woman at the counter that he had “nothing to lose.”
He then showed the woman a black object in the waist-
band of his pants, the report stated.
Believing that this object was the 
handle of a gun, the cashier told officials she was scared and handed him $100 in cash, the report stated. The report did 
not specify if the money came from the 
register.
According to the report, the man was 
identified as Curtis Hines, 33, by a Wal-greens surveillance photograph.
Hines was arrested at 12:49 a.m. Tuesday, the report 
stated. Records show he was recently released from the De-partment of Corrections on aggravated battery charges.
Hines told officials that while he did not actually have 
a weapon, he wanted the cashier to think he was carrying one. The report did not mention if Hines was actually car-rying a weapon.
Hines was charged with armed robbery with a firearm 
or other deadly weapon.

It is midnight on a Monday, and all of Leah Chap-
man’s roommates are asleep. She walks into her 
room, turns off the light switch and crawls into bed. 
An hour goes by, and Chapman is still wide awake. 
“I have a lot of trouble sleeping sometimes,” the 
UF sophomore said. “I stress out about my school-work, especially around finals.”
Chapman is not alone when it comes to her stress-
induced insomnia. More than 61.6 percent of UF stu-dents suffer from sleeping problems, according to the Healthy Gators Student Survey conducted by the 
Healthy Gators 2010 Coalition in March 2008. 
Stress-induced insomnia can escalate during finals 
week, says Tina Long, a health promotion specialist 
for GatorWell. 
“Your body likes the same consistency,” Long 
said. “You’ll start to feel more rested.”
Steve Arnett, sleep coordinator at the Sleep Dis-
orders Center at Shands, recommends exercising during the day and trying not to cram for finals. If you cannot fall asleep after 15 minutes, get up and do 
something else, he suggests. 
“Don’t lie in bed waiting to fall asleep,” Arnett 
said. “Your mind will just go crazy.”
He suggests getting out of bed and reading a book 
until you begin to feel sleepy. Sleeping in and taking 
naps during the day will just cause a snowball effect of sleeplessness. 
Some sleep “don’ts” include watch-
ing TV before sleeping, exercising be-
fore bedtime and consuming caffeine at 
night, he said.
Long suggests taking a 10- to 15-minute study 
break about every 50 minutes.
When creating an action plan for finals week, in-
corporate some fun activities such as walking or so-cializing. It helps keep the stress from building up, she said. 
Chapman is guilty of sabotaging her own sleep. 
“I tend to fall asleep with the TV on and go for 
late-night runs,” she admits. “And I guess if I laid 
off the Mountain Dew all day, I’d get a better night’s sleep.”Finals week breeds insomniacs

 The carcasses of 15 polo horses 
were delivered to UF’s College of 
Veterinary Medicine early Mon-
day morning for testing to deter-mine the cause of death for 21 of the animals in Wellington, Fla.
The horses, part of a polo team 
from Venezuela, were set to com-
pete in the U.S. Open on Sunday 
afternoon. However, the animals became dizzy, some even falling down. All afﬂ  icted horses died 
within 24 hours.
Six of the carcasses were trans-
ported to the Florida Department 
of Agriculture laboratory in Kis-simmee, Fla.
UF was initially asked to per-
form necropsies on eight of the horses; procedures that include a physical inspection, on-site test-ing under a microscope and off-
site blood and tissue testing.
Each animal was valued at up 
to $200,000.
The horses were insured, and 
testing was required to make a 
death beneﬁ  t claim.
Pathologists were unsure how 
long the testing would take, but the ﬁ  rst tests on eight horses were 
completed by 5:30 p.m. on Monday.
Sarah Carey, a spokeswoman for the college, said that the lab results’ ability to deter-
mine cause of death may de-
pend on how quickly the hors-es died after being stricken.“If the horses died within two hours, it may not show up in the 
organs,” she said.
On Tuesday, testing for the 
additional six horses was re-
quested.
The college charges $1,155 for 
basic in-lab testing of each horse, and additional tests add to the fee. Carey believes that many of the horses will undergo extra 
testing, she wrote in an e-mail.
The college has received signiﬁ  -cant media attention following the arrival of the horse carcasses, 
but care has been taken to shield 
the working pathologists from the media to allow them to focus on their jobs.
“We’re not doing any of it for notoriety,” she said. “Our con-
cern is getting the science right.”
Conﬁ  dentiality laws involv-
ing animals are similar to those 
between a doctor and a human patient; only the parties who commissioned the tests will have 
access to the results unless they 
choose to release the information to the public.

BOSTON (AP) — Prosecutors 
said Tuesday they found a semi-
automatic weapon at the home of a Boston medical student who has been ordered held without bail on 
charges he shot to death a masseuse 
he had lured to a hotel through Craigslist.
Philip Markoff said nothing 
during the brief hearing in Boston Municipal Court. Authorities said they followed a computer trail to Markoff, linking an account used to set up appointments on Craigslist 
with two women who were attacked 
to his address in Quincy.
They say a search of his home 
found the gun, ammunition and ma-terials exactly matching those used in an attack on another masseuse in a Boston hotel.
Markoff is charged with murder 
in the death of Julissa Brisman of 
New York City and kidnapping and 
armed robbery in the other assault.
The second-year Boston Univer-
sity medical student lives with his fiance, who claims police have the wrong man.
“He could not hurt a fly,” Me-
gan McAllister said in an e-mail to ABC’s “Good Morning America. 
“All I have to say is Philip is a beau-
tiful person, inside and out,” she said in the e-mail read on Tuesday’s program.
Markoff’s attorney, John Salsberg, 
did not immediately comment.Authorities have said there could 
be more victims.
“Our top priority is holding 
Philip Markoff accountable. He’s a predator,” Suffolk District Attorney 
Daniel Conley said Monday in an-
nouncing Markoff’s arrest earlier in the day during a traffic stop.
An e-mail message sent to McAl-
lister via her Facebook page was not immediately returned Tuesday. The 
McAllister family did not respond to knocks of the door 
of their Little Silver, 
N.J. home Tues-
day. Shortly after, a police officer emerged from home and said the family did not wish to speak with re-porters, and asked the media respect their privacy.
Michael Bernard, who lives in 
Markoff’s building in Quincy, was 
shocked to recognize his neighbor 
on television reports of the killing.
“He was smart, he carried him-
self well, he was clean, a good look-ing guy,” said Bernard. “He seemed like the type that would have it all. It doesn’t make sense.”
Authorities believe Markoff also 
may be connected to the attempted 
robbery Thursday in Warwick, R.I., 
of a stripper who had posted an ad on Craigslist.
She was held at gunpoint before 
her husband entered the room and her attacker fled.No bail for student

Lindsey Jameson, director of the Women’s Leadership Council at UF, 
discusses reasons why the proposed budget cuts to eliminate the Center for Leadership and Service and Multicultural and Diversity Af-fairs should not be passed, during the Student Senate meeting Tues-day night.

Student Government voted unanimously to 
passed its budget bill, dishing out $583,482 to 87 
student organizations Tuesday night. 
But, before the budget was approved, Orange 
and Blue Sens. Alden Gillespy and Jonathan Ossip 
presented an amendment giving $969 in funds that 
were not accounted for in the budget to Fearless, an anti-discrimination advocacy group.  
The extra money was also used to provide ad-
ditional funds for five other organizations: Heal 
the World, Hindu Student Union, the Intervarsity 
Christian Fellowship, Student Global Aids Cam-paign and VOX: Voices of Planned Parenthood.
The Senate chambers were unusually full Tues-
day night when students stopped by to support two resolutions that were both passed, but not unanimously, later in the meeting.
A resolution is a piece of legislation that states 
the Senate’s opinion but takes no action. 
Skeet Surrency, a representative for the Save 
Our Schools Coalition, urged senators to vote in favor of the first resolution, which was authored by Orange and Blue Sen. Ben Cavataro.The resolution proclaims support of the one-
cent sales tax currently being debated in the State Legislature.
Surrency said the Florida Education Association 
and FSU President T.K. Weatherall both support 
the tax, which would raise money for education. 
A second resolution, authored by Unite Party 
Sen. Gaby Alvarez, Unite Party Sen. Jannise Acosta 
and Progress Party Sen. Dave Schnieder, presented a resolution stating the Senate’s disapproval of the 
administration’s decision to cut the Multicultural 
Affairs Department and the Center for Leadership and Service. 
The department and center house several vol-
unteer, leadership, diversity-related and cultural student organizations including Florida Alterna-tive Breaks, the Women’s Leadership Council, the Office of LGBT Affairs, the Institute of Black Cul-ture and La Casita.
“These two resolutions go in hand perfectly,” 
Schnieder said earlier in the meeting. 
“We don’t want these cut to happen, but we 
don’t have the funds to go forward,” he said add-
ing the one-penny sales tax would generate $3.6 
billion in revenue over the next three years.
The resolutions did meet some opposition. Or-
ange and Blue Sen. Sam Miorelli said it is more important to focus efforts on saving academic pro-
grams instead of crying every time a program is 
eliminated because of budget cuts.
“The sales tax increase would have no effect on 
the current round of budget cuts and might not 
even affect the next round,” he said.STUDENT GOVERNMENTSG passes budget, resolutions

� THE REPRIMAND IS NOW 
ON HIS PERSONNEL FILE.

While the Gainesville Police De-
partment officers involved in the 
egg-throwing incidents have been given warnings, and two have is-sued public apologies, University 
Police Department officer Keith 
Smith has also been punished as a result of his involvement.
UPD Capt. Jeff Holcomb said 
Smith was given an oral reprimand, the lowest form of punishment, and was reassigned from the Combined Drug Task Force back to patrol. The oral reprimand was entered into 
Smith’s personnel file, Holcomb 
said.The reassignment was not a de-
motion, he said, and did not involve 
a pay reduction.
According to 
UPD’s internal affairs investigation, started 
in November and completed in Jan-uary, no evidence was found that Smith solicited a prostitute, used de-rogatory language or threw eggs at 
anyone or any piece of property.
“I said, ‘lets get the hell out of here, this is stupid. Stop yelling at people, it’s childish,’” Smith is quot-
ed as saying in the report.
Nevertheless, the investigation 
concluded that Smith acted inappro-priately by being present not once but three times during the incidents. He was also under the influence of alcohol. The report also chastises him for not stopping the behavior 
he was witnessing.
“He didn’t take actual participa-tion in the throwing of the eggs, as we understand,” Holcomb said, “but 
again, by placing himself in that po-sition it just casts a — you know — a poor light on our agency.”
The investigation found that 
Smith was in the company of GPD officers when they drove through the Porters neighborhood–on Nov. 2, Nov. 8 and Nov. 9, possibly yell-
ing at prostitutes and throwing eggs 
out of the car.

The University of Central Florida is look-
ing at  potentially having to cut $22 million to $57 million off its budget, and like UF President Bernie Machen, UCF’s president said stimulus money is not a long-term solu-tion to cuts.
UCF President John Hitt announced in 
a message to faculty and staff Tuesday that UCF could be looking at “the elimination of hundreds of faculty and staff jobs and 
deny(ing) educational opportunities to thou-
sands of students” in the worst-case scenar-io. More details of the budget proposal will be released soon, he wrote.
Hitt also wrote that UCF would receive 
$18 million in stimulus money in both the Florida House and Senate budget proposals.
“As helpful as the stimulus money is in 
the near-run, it is not a long-term answer,” 
he wrote.“The cuts to UCF’s base budget are per-
manent,” he wrote, “and stimulus money disap-
pears after two years.”
Machen announced last 
week that UF would not be using stimulus money to offset budget cuts, which 
affect recurring costs, costs that must be paid every year, like salaries.
UF is expecting to receive $41 million in stimulus money each year for the next two years, Machen said, but after that time is up, 
UF can’t count on that money. 
“We can’t just assume that that $41 mil-
lion is going to be filled up in two years, so 
we are going to make our cuts,” he said last week.
Instead, the money will be used to pay 
for transitional measures, like paying sala-ries for laid-off employees during their no-tice period, which can be a year long in some 
cases.STATEUPD officer given oral reprimand for misconduct

Come May 1, Student Body Pres-
ident Kevin Reilly will pass more 
than just his torch to Student Body President-elect Jordan Johnson.
With the transition in Student 
Government administrations comes a host of learned lessons from Reil-ly’s sometimes-rocky year in office.
Reilly, a Gator Party member 
and former Student Senate presi-dent, did not return multiple phone calls over the past few days to reflect on his year, saying via text message Tuesday that he is in meetings in 
Washington, D.C., all day.
His reign as UF’s chief executive 
officer included fulfilling some cam-
paign processes, such as  extending library hours through exam week, a measure continued from the previ-ous administration, but it wasn’t al-ways so rosy.
Reilly’s experiences did not go 
unnoted by Johnson, a Unite Party member and former Senate presi-dent himself, who said he doesn’t intend to dwell on his  predecessor’s missteps.
“I want to do my own thing and 
leave my own legacy,” he said.
One of Reilly’s earliest tests came 
last May when Student Body Trea-surer Paul Drayton came under fire by the Orange and Blue Party for fleeing Gainesville to take a summer internship with JP Morgan Chase in New York City. The decision re-sulted in impeachment proceedings, though Drayton kept his office.
Johnson explained that his run-
ning mates will be sticking by his 
side throughout the summer.
“One of the commitments we 
made when we took office was to 
make sacrifices,” he said. 
“I think that by asking to be-
come a representative of the Student Body, you have to understand these sacrifices -- that this is a year-long commitment.”
In January, 
Reilly faced his own impeach-ment proceed-ings by the Sen-
ate minority for his participation in last fall’s private e-mail scandal, where Reilly and three other SG offi-cials discussed via personal, non–SG 
e–mail accounts how to keep Orange 
and Blue Party members out of Sen-ate committees during the summer session.
Six allegations were brought 
against Reilly, including failure to appoint an Image Chair in his ex-ecutive cabinet among other e-mail-related charges, but he was not re-
moved from office.
Johnson was hesitant to address 
Reilly’s role in the scandal.“It’s not an easy question by any 
means,” Johnson said. “And you 
know, when I think about the e-mail situation, I think that President Reil-ly was in the wrong.”However, Johnson said, it’s easy 
to fall down a slippery slope once decisions are made without constit-uents -- fellow students -- in mind. 
“It’s tough these days,” he said. “And you’re a very busy person when you’re Student Body presi-dent. You want your opinion to be heard when you think that what you have to say counts.”

EARTH DAY TUESDAY.

This year, Earth Day will 
leave a permanent mark on Sante Fe College’s campus.
On Monday morning, the 
school dedicated five acres of the northwest campus to con-servation, which signaled the  beginning of its Earth Week 2009 celebrations. 
About 40 people attended 
the ceremony, and guests were given guided tours of the wooded area afterward.
“It was a beautiful day, a 
beautiful event,” spokeswom-an Bennye Alligood said, add-ing that the rain held off just long enough for the day to be a success.
The natural area is part of 
the campus’ North Woods, which contains live oaks, lob-
lolly pines and sinkholes and 
serves as a field laboratory for Santa Fe faculty and students.
Albert “Bud” Mayfield, 
chairman for the Suwannee 
chapter of the Society of Ameri-can Foresters, 
expressed the 
organization’s support of the 
dedication as a teaching tool 
and conservation effort.
The woods are often used 
by Santa Fe’s botany, ecology, geology and art programs be-
cause they’re close by, Alli-
good said.

tat,” she said.ON CAmPuS
UF installs emergency public alert system on campus
By THOmAS STEWART
Alligator Staff Writer
tstewart@alligator.org
 
UF is installing emergency speak-
ers in about 600 locations on campus  — at a cost of about $900,000.
They’re being installed in every 
classroom, most class labs and high-traffic areas around campus, like the Plaza of the Americas and the Reitz Union North Lawn, said Kenneth Allen, UF’s emergency management coordinator.
Almost all of the locations will 
be indoors, Allen said, with about a dozen outdoor locations. 
Some of the indoor locations 
will have telephones with speakers instead of stand-alone speakers, he said.
The system will allow UF to si-multaneously broadcast an emer-gency message all over campus in addition to sending it out via text message and through e-mail with UF’s current emergency alert sys-tem, he said.
The installation should be com-
plete by early 2010, he said, with about 160 locations equipped by the end of May.
The speakers are the main part of a $1-million emergency notifica-tion system. The remaining $100,000 not spent on the speakers will go to other services like text messaging, Allen said.
Students paid for half of the costs 
through the Capital Improvement Trust Fund fee applied to tuition. UF matched the rest of the money.
The project was given the green 
light in August of 2008, Allen said, and in March, Matherly Hall was the first building to have the speak-ers installed.
The system will also have the 
capability to include features like video screens and scrolling signs, he said.
There are no immediate plans to 
include screens or signs. However, as technology changes, the system will be able to adapt, he said.

A new restaurant plans to bring 
Latin flair with a modern edge to 
midtown, directly across from UF on West University Avenue.
101 Cantina is scheduled to 
open in late May or early June, said Alex Thomas, owner of 101 Down-town.
The bar will feature live mu-
sic, which may include a Maria-chi band, a type of Mexican mu-sic group, said Erik Zika, general manager of 101 Downtown and 101 Cantina.
“It’s going to be a really fun at-
mosphere with people dancing on tables, dancing everywhere,” he said. “A free-for-all.”
101 Cantina’s menu will feature 
modern Mexican food, which will 
include “Tex-Mex” and Southwestern in-fluences.
About 50 brands 
of tequila will be offered, as well as 35 types of margaritas, with flavors including chocolate, mint, Jagermeister and assorted fruits.
Zika said Cantina will provide 
the only outdoor bar in Gainesville, which will be in a tiki hut behind the restaurant.
Thomas is comfortable expand-
ing because he feels that Gainesville 
is safe from the recession, he said.
The restaurant’s  owners be-
lieve students aren’t as affected by the recession due to the consistent 
income from loans, grants or schol-arships, and make a good target audience, he said.
The 101 Management Group 
has started hiring for 101 Cantina and is seeking bartenders, servers, 
hostesses and cooks. Applications 
are being accepted at 101 Down-town.16, ALLIGATOR � WEDNESDAY, APRIL 22, 2009

SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico — President Ba-
rack Obama came under fire Tuesday for in-
cluding $80 million to close Guantanamo in a massive funding request to fight America’s 
wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.
The $83.4 billion request to Congress was 
submitted on April 9, when lawmakers were 
on break over the Easter holidays. Tucked into the 99-page bill were a few paragraphs about 
Guantanamo — including a request for funds 
for foreign countries that accept prisoners. U.S. 
efforts to have other countries take in detain-
ees have largely been a flop — stoking fears the men will end up in America.
“The administration needs to tell the Amer-
ican people what it plans to do with these men if they close Guantanamo,” U.S. Senate Re-publican leader Mitch McConnell said on the Senate floor Tuesday. He pointed out that two years ago the Senate voted 94-3 against send-ing detainees to the U.S.
McConnell opposes closing Guantanamo.“Foreign countries have thus far been un-
willing to take them in any significant num-bers. And even if countries were willing to take them, there’s an increasing probability that some of these murderers would return to the battlefield,” he said.
Military Families United, a military family 
advocacy organization, predicted the inclu-sion of money to close Guantanamo in the war-funding request “will significantly delay the passage of this legislation and delay our troops from getting the funding they need and deserve.”“Funding for our troops cannot be made 
contingent on funding for an unrelated and politically divisive issue like the closure of 
Guantanamo Bay,” the group said.
McConnell spokesman Don Stewart said 
Republicans are looking at ways to strip the 
Guantanamo money from the funding bill. 
There is no move afoot to block the entire fund-
ing bill because “this is money for our troops,” 
Stewart said.
Obama seeks $30 million 
in Justice Department fund-
ing to shut down the Guan-
tanamo detention center, 
review U.S. detention and 
interrogation procedures 
and fund future litigation.
Another $50 million in 
Defense Department funds sought by Obama 
would support the relocation of the 240 prison-ers at Guantanamo, which Obama has ordered closed by January, and redeploy military and support forces associated with the detention center on the Navy base.
Some of the $50 million would also “pro-
vide assistance to foreign nations” as detainees are relocated.
The U.S. wants to resettle dozens of Guan-
tanamo prisoners in foreign lands, but coun-tries have been reluctant to take them because of security concerns.
A senior Obama administration official 
indicated Tuesday that some of the funding could be used to help foreign nations pay for rehabilitation programs. The official was not authorized to discuss the issue publicly and spoke on condition of anonymity.Senator criticizes plans to

A student, wearing an oxygen mask with a sticker reading “Day of Silence,” protests the proposed 
budget cuts to eliminate the Center for Leadership and Service and Multicultural and Diversity Affairs at the Student Senate meeting Tuesday night.
The silence was broken during 
Tuesday’s Senate meeting, when the 
students spoke during public debate in favor of a resolution against the administration’s decision to cut both programs. 
Unite Party Sen. Megan Vu, who 
represents District A, showed sena-tors one of the silence masks during the meeting and said they must take an active role in commenting on cuts.  
“This resolution asks simply for 
admin to work with us,” she said. “We want to stand up and have a voice in these budget cuts.”
Unite Party Sen. Naadira Ren-
froe, who represents the sophomore class and helped organize efforts, said the event was intended to show how students are silenced in their majors and career choices through program cuts. The Week of Action will conclude 
today when senators and other or-ganization representatives march to Tigert Hall to present Vice President 
of Student Affiars, Patricia Telles-
Irvin, and UF President Bernie Ma-
chen with a copy of the legislation opposing both program cuts.
Before the march takes place, Vu 
said, Telles-Irvin answer questions about UF’s decision at noon today in the Reitz Union Auditorium.   
“(The rally) is about using your 
voice,” Lauteria said, adding he feels the cut of diversity and lead-ership programs goes against what UF stands for. “It’s inexcusable and shouldn’t be accepted.”Protesters break silence in Senate’s public debate90 fewer graduate assistants.
The UF Libraries budget proposal, which 
would cut about $2.7 million, would result in 
fewer purchases of books, periodicals, journals and e-databases.
About 7,900 fewer books would be bought 
under the proposal. Timely access to academic research publications would also be affected, with the biggest impact in the humanities and social sciences.
On the library’s budget blog, Judy Russell, 
dean of the libraries, has posted an e-mail she sent to Glover informing him that the Univer-sity of Central Florida and the University of 
South Florida are leaving their libraries’ mate-rials budgets untouched in their proposals.
Russell could not be reached for comment.
Under other proposed cuts, outside parties, 
like mortage companies, banks and employers 
would have to pay a fee to another vendor to 
get employment verifications for UF employ-ees.
Human Resource Services currently han-
dles them.
The Joint Service Pass in Review, the once-
a-year parade put on by all four branches of UF’s ROTC program — the Army, Navy, Air Forice and Marines — could be cut. 
The Information Technology Help Desk 
could see its hours and response time affected and UF’s Performing Arts could sponsor few-er performances.
The Latin American Studies Center could see two classes and some summer programs cut as well as lose an adviser for part of the summer. 
The Graduate School could also lose a few 
graduate scholarships. All proposals are worst-case scenarios, in which a college or academic 
unit could see a 10 percent cut to its budget.
Also thrown into the mix are two infor-
mational items: an across-the-board 5 percent pay cut for UF employees that could save UF 
about $40 million and three-week furloughs, or forced vacations, for all employees. There would be one week of furlough each semester. 
The change could save about $40 million.
If the plan was implemented, UF would 
have to increase class sizes and use subtitute 
professor when a professor was on furlough.
UF President Bernie Machen said he’s not 
in favor of either proposal and said they were only included because there has been some discussion about how much they could save. 
Machen said he wanted to put the informa-
tion on the table so the UF community can de-cide if the ideas sound favorable.
“There is some discussion about them, and 
there’s some misinformation about what they are,” he said last week.The UF Libraries cut would allot for 7,900 fewer books, journals

THE ASSOCIATED PRESS
HATFIELD, England — In the 
search for Earth-like planets, astron-
omers zeroed in Tuesday on two places that look awfully familiar to home. One is close to the right size. 
The other is in the right place.
European researchers said they 
not only found the smallest exo-
planet ever, called Gliese 581 e, but realized that a neighboring planet discovered earlier, Gliese 581 d, was in the prime habitable zone for po-tential life.
“The Holy Grail of current exo-
planet research is the detection of a rocky, Earth-like planet in the ‘habit-able zone,’” said Michel Mayor, an astrophysicist at Geneva University in Switzerland.
An American expert called the 
discovery of the tiny planet “ex-traordinary.”
Gliese 581 e is only 1.9 times the 
size of Earth — while previous plan-ets found outside our solar system are closer to the size of massive Ju-piter, which NASA says could swal-low more than 1,000 Earths.
Gliese 581 e sits close to the near-
est star, making it too hot to support life. Still, Mayor said its discovery in a solar system 20½ light years away from Earth is a “good example that we are progressing in the detection of Earth-like planets.”
Scientists also discovered that the 
orbit of planet Gliese 581 d, which was found in 2007, was located 
within the “habitable zone” — a 
region around a sun-like star that would allow water to be liquid on the planet’s surface, Mayor said.
He spoke at a news conference 
Tuesday at the University of Hert-fordshire during the European Week of Astronomy and Space Science.
Gliese 581 d is probably too large 
to be made only of rocky material, fellow astronomer and team mem-
ber Stephane Udry said, adding it 
was possible the planet had a “large and deep” ocean.
“It is the first serious ‘water-
world’ candidate,” Udry said.
Mayor’s main planet-hunting 
competitor, Geoff Marcy of the University of California, Berkeley, praised the find of Gliese 581 e as “the most exciting discovery” so far of exoplanets — planets outside our solar system.
“This discovery is absolutely 
extraordinary,” Marcy told The As-sociated Press by e-mail, calling the 
discoveries a significant step in the 
search for Earth-like planets.
While Gliese 581 e is too hot for 
life “it shows that nature makes such small planets, probably in large numbers,” Marcy commented. “Surely the galaxy contains tens of billions of planets like the small, Earth-mass one announced here.”
Nearly 350 planets have been 
found outside our solar system, but so far nearly every one of them was found to be extremely unlikely to harbor life. Most were too close or too far from their sun, making them too hot or too cold for life. Others were too big and likely to be un-inhabitable gas giants like Jupiter. Those that are too small are highly difficult to detect in the first place.
Both Gliese 581 d and Gliese 581 
e are located in constellation Libra and orbit around Gliese 581.
Like other planets circling that 
star — scientists have discovered four so far — Gliese 581 e was found using the European Southern Obser-vatory’s telescope in La Silla, Chile.
The telescope has a special in-
strument which splits light to find wobbles in different wavelengths. Those wobbles can reveal the exis-
tence of other worlds
“It is great work and shows the 
potential of this detection method,” 
said Lisa Kaltenegger, an astrono-mer at the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics.
UNIVERSEEuropean scientists discover two Earth-like planets
the line for seconds.
“It’s a little bit crazy because the line nev-
er stops,” Kostamo said. “(The event) is al-
ways in spring around finals, hopefully just 
when people need a sugar fix.”
Last year, the foundation raised more than $3,000, according to Kostamo’s re-
cords.
Pete Zimek, the owner of the two 
Gainesville locations, estimated that the 
stores would see anywhere from 6,000 to 
7,000 people take advantage of Tuesday’s 
sweet giveaway.
But Free Cone Day isn’t about making 
money, Zimek said, it’s about giving. Even the regular staff at Ben & Jerry’s volunteered 
its time for the day.  
 “This event happens in almost 800 stores 
in the world,” he said. 
“...It helps our social 
mission come alive in 
Gainesville.”
Much like UF, every department within 
the Alachua County Public Schools was asked to cut 10 percent of its budget. Kosta-
mo said Free Cone Day is one of the largest 
fundraising events that the foundation can 
do with community support.
“Things are tight for some people, but I 
think they are generous. They’ll give what 
they can,” she said. “And we’ll be happy with every cent that we didn’t have yester-day.”Owner of two Gainesville stores expected 6,000 to 7,000 people

■  THE SAINTS CLINCHED THEIR 
CONFERENCE THIS WEEKEND.
By KELSIE HOECHERL
Alligator Writer
The Mid-Florida Conference cham-
pion Santa Fe College softball team split its doubleheader against St. Petersburg College on Tuesday.
The Saints (47-7, 19-5 MFC) beat the 
Titans in Game 1 by a 7-1 margin and lost in Game 2 by a score of 11-1.
“The second game was a tune-up 
game to get ready for states,” SFC coach Chris Ahern said. “We wanted to see how everything worked together. The pressure came off Saturday when we won the conference after beating Cen-tral Florida Community College.”
Freshman Kimberly Squires (26-3) 
picked up the win in the first game, giv-ing up 1 run on three hits. She had two strikeouts.
Squires and freshman outfielder 
Lawna Hunter were responsible for five of the game’s 7 runs with two and three RBIs, respectively.
The Saints put up 2 more runs in the 
bottom of the sixth off RBIs from soph-omore outfielders Brittany Cannon and B.B. Jean-Francois.
“(We) definitely had to battle back 
for the conference title,” sophomore third baseman Kristina Cruz said. “We had a few more losses this season than we did last. It’s a different team and it has great potential. We’re ready to take 
on states.”
In Game 2, SFC struggled to put even 
1 run on the board. An RBI groundout 
from Hunter tied the game at 1-1 in the first inning. 
But the Titans dominated the Saints’ 
pitching, scoring 8 runs in the top of the fourth inning. The game ended in the fifth inning when the game was called on a mercy rule.
Despite the loss, SFC still finished 
the season one game ahead of Semi-nole Community College in the MFC to clinch the conference for the fifth time in a row. The Saints are ranked third in the state and No. 8 in the country.
In addition to being named confer-
ence champions over the weekend, SFC was honored by having substantial rep-resentation on the MFC first and second teams. On the conference’s first team are Cannon, Hunter, Cruz and Squires. Nadirah Nesfield, Erika Garcia, Ashley Schmitt, Maria Gilreath and Morgan Fortson were named to MFC’s second team.
Jean-Francois, Ali Savage, Brittany 
Holick, Yahtea Benton and Carissa Albizu received honorable mentions in their conference, and Cannon was named MFC Player of the Year.
“It’s great,” Cannon said. “I’m glad 
I can help my team out in every way. I plan on continuing that through states, which we are going to win.”SFC splits doubleheader

Hail to the Gators.
The UF football team will travel to 
Washington D.C. on Thursday to be rec-ognized at the White House for its 2008 BCS National Championship.
The Gators will be the first champion-
ship team to be recognized at the White House during President Obama’s three-month reign as U.S. leader.
About 225 players, coaches and staff 
will make the trek to the nation’s capi-tal, according to UF sports information director Steve McClain.
The University Athletic Association 
will pay for the group’s travel, but trip 
planning was not complete as of Monday 
afternoon and therefore final expenses could not be calculated.
The UF football team’s trip to the 
White House two years ago after its 2006 BCS title cost $96,000, according to a De-
cember 2007 Orange County Register re-
port.
“I’ve never been to Washington D.C. 
or anything like that,” soon-to-be-soph-
omore quarterback John Brantley said. 
“I’d love to go see the House. I think it’s going to be a great experience to go up there and meet the president and walk around the House just so I can say I did it.”
It hasn’t always been run-of-the-mill 
for UF teams in D.C.
Former UF forward and current Chi-
cago Bulls starter Joakim Noah caused quite a stir regarding the Gators basket-ball team’s trip to the White House after 
its first NCAA title in 2006. 
Noah almost didn’t go on the trip 
because of disagreements with some of 
then-President George W. Bush’s foreign policies.
“I felt like I didn’t want to go because 
I don’t particularly agree with the presi-
dent and his views and what he stands 
for,” Noah told The New York Times in 
March 2007 regarding the trip. 
“But at the same time, I felt like af-
ter talking with coach Donovan, I didn’t 
want to put that negative publicity on the 
team. And I feel like I love this country. I re-ally do. I don’t want to 
disrespect it. If I was in 
an individual sport or something … maybe I 
wouldn’t have gone.”
Expect this trip to be 
a lot calmer. 
What would Brant-
ley say if he caught President Obama one-on-one in a hallway?
“Shoot, I don’t know. ‘Hi?’” Brantley 
laughed.
UF offensive coordinator Steve Add-
azio also said he was excited to meet the 
president.
“Why wouldn’t I be?” Addazio said. 
“It’s a great experience. … I went two 
years ago and it was a lot of fun.”
Earlier this week, Obama visited with 
golfer Tiger Woods and members of the 
Chicago White Sox while the team was 
in town for a series against the Baltimore Orioles. The White Sox are Obama’s fa-vorite team.UF FOOTBALLGators to visit president

THE ASSOCIATED PRESS
JACKSONVILLE — The Jacksonville Jag-
uars have been searching for Jimmy Smith’s 
replacement for years.
Reggie Williams, Matt Jones and Jerry Por-
ter all failed miserably.
Now, Torry Holt gets a turn.Holt signed a three-year, incentive-laced 
contract with Jacksonville on Monday night, hoping to give the Jaguars the go-to receiver they’ve been looking for since Smith retired after the 2005 season.
And Holt believes he still can perform at a 
high level despite closing in on his 33rd birth-day and being two years removed from knee 
surgery.
“You tell me what guy in his 11th season is 
who he was when he first came into the Na-
tional Football League,” Holt said Tuesday. “I bet you won’t find too many of those guys. Am I the guy I was back then? Absolutely not. I feel like in a lot of ways I’m a lot better and I’m a lot craftier than I was back then.
“Back then I didn’t have the knee surgery 
and I was younger. Those things allowed me to play at a fairly good clip. But I can still play. I feel like I’m anywhere between 80 and 90 percent of that player that I once was, given the right situation and given the opportunities to showcase that. I think I still have the ability to do that.”
Holt, 11th on the NFL’s career list with 869 
receptions, believes he can play six more sea-
sons. He caught 64 passes for 796 yards and 
three touchdowns for St. Louis last season. The Rams released him last month, days before he was due a $1.25 million roster bonus.
Although Holt acknowledged that his best 
days probably were behind him, he made it clear that his drop-off last season had nothing to do with his right knee that plagued him in 2007. Holt had 93 receptions for 1,189 yards and seven touchdowns following surgery and said he felt even better heading into ‘08.
“You never heard me complaining about 
having any knee problems,” he said. “You never saw me miss any games last year. I think it came down to the fact that we were not that good offensively. We fired our coach after the third or fourth game of the season. We had our quarterback, Marc Bulger, benched. There was no chemistry, no continuity within our offense  — period — so everyone struggled, everyone suffered.
“I don’t think my knee had anything to do 
with what people said was a decline in my numbers. It probably was that I played at such a high level for so long. To be able to catch 64 passes and 800-some yards last year with the 
disgruntled origination and a dysfunctional 
team and a not-so-healthy football team I thought was good.”
The Jaguars are counting on Holt staying 
healthy.
Jacksonville parted ways with three of its 
top receivers this off-season, releasing Porter and Jones and declining to re-sign Williams.
Williams and Jones were first-round draft 
picks in 2004 and 2005, respectively, but nei-ther lived up to lofty expectations. The team signed Porter to a six-year, $30 million contract 
last year in hopes of filling the void, but he caught just 11 passes for 181 yards and a touchdown and was blamed for the team’s chemistry issues.
The Jags expect much 
more production from Holt.
“We didn’t just get a 
player with the ability to help us win, but somebody who can be a positive, veteran presence in the locker room,” general manager Gene Smith said. 
“He’s not in his prime years, but he defi-
nitely has a lot left and certainly can come in here and play at a winning level. He’s bring-ing more than just talent, and that’s what was 
very attractive about adding a guy like him to 
the locker room.”
Holt plans to arrive in Jacksonville on 
Thursday to start working out with his new teammates and learning new plays. And the guy nicknamed “Big Game” also has big goals.
“My goal is always 90-plus catches, 1,300-
plus yards and 10-plus touchdowns,” he said. “That’s always been my goal, and those goals won’t change. 
“You have to set them pretty high to give 
yourself something to strive for and reach for.”Jaguars sign veteran wideout Holt to three-year dealWEDNESDAY, APRIL 22, 2009 � ALLIGATOR, 21

TODAY IN UF SPORTS HISTORY ONLINE POLL QUESTIONBy KYLE MAISTRI
Alligator Staff Writer
kmaistri@alligator.org
The Gators have created an unortho-
dox formula for winning baseball games: 
Rocky starting pitching plus strong long-
relief outings plus explosive late-game hit-
ting equals success.
UF (27-14) did little to shake up that 
formula in a 12-3 road win against Florida 
Gulf Coast (22-15) on Tuesday in Fort My-
ers.
Junior Jeff Barfield (2-1, 3.64 ERA), who 
has been one of the Gators’ most reliable starters this season, took the ball in the 
first inning against the Eagles and strug-
gled early. 
Barfield didn’t allow a hit through the 
first two innings, but he gave up 3 runs on 
a home run by FGCU leadoff hitter Josh 
Upchurch in the third inning.
“The 3 runs in the third, we’ve been do-
ing that, and that’s been hurting us the last few weeks,” UF coach Kevin O’Sullivan 
said.
The longball put the Eagles ahead 3-2, 
and Barfield was pulled in favor of junior 
Billy Bullock at the start of the fourth in-
ning. The hard-throwing right hander 
went on to pitch three scoreless innings of one-hit baseball, striking out four while giving his offense the opportunity to take back the lead.
“We went in to this game trying to use 
the best guys we had,” O’Sullivan said. “That’s why we went to Billy in the middle 
there.”
The Gators tied the game at 3-3 in the 
fourth inning, and in the fifth inning, they 
blew the game wide open. 
Catcher Buddy Munroe untied the con-
test with a one-out solo home run, and six batters later, freshman Preston Tucker 
added a 3-run bomb — his ninth of the sea-
son — to put the Gators ahead 9-3.
UF put 3 more runs on the board in the 
eighth inning behind a 2-run single from Munroe and a little help from the FGCU

I was supposed to 
be a sports reporter. It was ev-

what I was called to be. How did I know this? Perhaps it 
was because I started writing

it’s only 11:57 now.
Sorry, professors, but I 
picked Tim Tebow over you 
a long time ago. I’ve been to more press conferences and 
interviews than classes. Dur-
ing my editing days, I cared 
more about how the paper looked the next day than what I got on a quiz. I’d rather have 
used a stronger word in a tiny 
box than get five points high-
er on a test. 
I don’t, however, believe 
you’ll be seeing this byline 
anywhere in the future. When I was applying for journalism 
gigs earlier this spring and 
late last fall, a line in one of 
my cover letters said that if I’m not meant to be a sports re-porter, “God has played some

■ LIKE JOE, JORDAN ALSO PLAYS IN THE SECONDARY.
By TYLER JETT
Alligator Writer
The members of UF’s 2010 
recruiting class have been like a 
long-distance family, texting and 
calling each other weekly.
The class’ newest addition is 
used to that.
Jordan Haden orally commit-
ted to the Gators on Monday, 
becoming the 11th member of the class. If that name sounds famil-iar, it’s because he is the younger brother of current UF cornerback 
Joe Haden.
“Me being here, I think, influ-
enced him, just telling him the 
inside scoop about the school, not just what the coaches and what the recruiting people are telling him,” Joe said. “(Jordan) has his brother, somebody that cares a lot more about him, who can tell him what’s real.”
Jordan, a safety from Ft. Wash-
ington Friendly High, knew he wanted to play for UF even be-fore Joe committed to the Gators. He said he gave other schools a chance so he could see what they had to offer, but ultimately he was Gainesville-bound.
“A lot of people visit a school 
and only see that little bit, they only see the good things. But when I go to Florida, I have a brother there that tells me every-thing,” Jordan said.
Jordan comes to Gainesville 
with realistic expectations, know-ing he will have to compete for playing time.
When Jordan steps foot on 
campus in 2010, the team will be two-deep at the position, assum-ing nobody declares early for the NFL Draft. Safety Ahmad Black 
talked with Jordan over the week-
end while he was 
in town for UF’s Orange and Blue Game and en-couraged him not to fret about the depth chart. 
“(Black) stopped to think for a 
minute and was like, ‘Damn man, as long as you continue to ball, that’s going to make them work hard,’” Jordan said.
Joe will be eligible to declare for 
the NFL Draft after next season. A player’s draft stock depends on a multitude of variables, so it is unclear how likely it is he will leave, but an early declaration by Joe would mean he would miss a chance to play with his younger brother.
“I would definitely enjoy play-
ing with him,” Joe said. “Just like high school. Just like little leagues because when he was younger, he always played up to play on me and Josh’s team. It’d be just like old times.”
With Jordan’s commitment, 
coach Urban Meyer is now 2 for 3 in recruiting Hadens. Josh, the 
brother between Joe and Jordan, 
declined a UF scholarship offer so he could play running back for Boston College. Both Joe and Jordan supported Josh’s decision and insist they would never pres-
CB Haden’s brother to join UF in 2010

me the gifts He has given me. Those gifts 
aren’t supposed to be used in journalism. They’re better used elsewhere, and that elsewhere, I believe, is in seminary.  I’m 
not sure when — it may be in four months 
or it may be in four years, but that’s where I’m supposed to be. I’m going to leave the timing up to the Big Guy upstairs. 
I love people — and even understand 
most of them — and I am called to use those gifts in more ways than just inter-viewing, reporting and writing. 
Wherever God sends me, I’ve had one 
heckuva ride getting there. Anything I 
write here doesn’t do justice or provide 
proper appreciation to those whom I’ve dealt with and have put up with me.
I’ve served what I call the three-semes-
ter alligatorSports sentence, surviving 40- 
to 70-hour work weeks as the Assistant 
Sports Editor, alligatorSports.org Editor and finally the Sports Editor this past fall, a semester filled with some of the greatest editors in the Alligator’s history.
I’ve been around this joint for nine se-
mesters, written hundreds of stories and endured 589 1/2  headaches.
It has all been one unforgettable, crazy, 
intense, blessed ride. 
And holy shnikies, I’ve had a lot of peo-
ple who helped me get on this trip.
Ian Fisher, who for some reason took a 
chance on me with only horrid high school clips, worked with me and forgave my rookie mistakes. If you don’t remember Extra Iannings, that shows you how old I am.
Nobody — and this isn’t close — had 
as big of an impact on my writing as Louis Anastasis. If Louis didn’t take as much time with me as he did, I wouldn’t be writ-ing this today. He pushed me, and when I turned in something that wasn’t horrible, he said how proud he was of me. Thank you so much, friend. 
I learned how to run a sports staff from 
Nick Zaccardi. Nick, you were the ulti-mate sports editor for a college paper, and I was extremely fortunate to be able to sit by you every night. If you guys want to 
talk about a guy doing what he’s meant to 
be doing, Nick is supposed to be a sports-writer. You were not only a colleague, but also a friend. On Nick’s Facebook page, he says he never forgets people who have had an impact on his life. You, my friend, have touched mine.
Even Bryan Jones — who thought be-
ing sports editor was worse than trying to formulate a defensive gameplan for Tim Tebow, Percy Harvin and Jeff Demps — left a mark. You were great where it counted. You were a loyal and true friend and someone who cared more about us as people than about the 300 to 500 words we’d write for you each night.
If you guys want to know somebody 
whose byline you can keep reading, watch out for Evan Drexler. He’s a sports report-ing stud, and he is going to kick some se-rious butt in this business. Plus, he made sense of my incoherent sayings last fall when we worked side-by-side every night. Evan, if you can do that, the rest of this business is a piece of cake.
To the rest of the current staff, there’s so 
much talent here it’s ridiculous. Go break stories and write features that make Sports Illustrated drool. The sports section is in great hands.
Residents of Gainesville and visitors to 
alligatorSports.org, whatever you do with your life, make sure you touch others. That can be in any field, wherever your passion lies. 
I don’t care if you have the emotional 
depth of a cactus, but when anybody gets passionate about something, those around you notice. This is what matters. It’s an awfully lonely world if we go through life alone.
Thank you all so very much for allow-
ing me anywhere from 350 to 2,000 words of your newspaper space on any given day for the last nine semesters. I’ve been far luckier than I deserve.
God bless.

defense. 
The Gators recorded 18 hits 
on their way to a 12-run show-
ing, but 9 of those runs were un-
earned because the Eagles com-mitted five errors.
Throughout the season, UF’s 
offense has been carried primar-ily by its No. 1 through 5 hitters, but the bottom of the order was the key against the Eagles. 
The Gators’ starting No. 6 
through 9 batters — Munroe, Teddy Foster, Jonathan Pigott and Mike Mooney — went 10 for 17, scored 6 runs and drove in 4 
more. 
“When you’re going good 
offensively, you’re getting con-
tributions from everyone from top to bottom,” O’Sullivan said. 
“When you can get multiple hits 
from your nine-hole hitter, it helps everybody in the lineup.”
After Sunday’s loss to Missis-
sippi, O’Sullivan said he thought his team was playing so well that they shouldn’t lose two games in a row anymore. 
The win against an FGCU team 
that came in riding a seven-game win streak proved exactly that. 
UF will try to win two in a row 
tonight at 6:30 when South Flori-
da comes to McKethan Stadium. 
O’Sullivan said he isn’t sure 
who will get the start, but who-
ever it is will be on a pitch count.
A radio broadcast contributed to 
this report.Bottom of order produces
sure each other to go to schools they didn’t like.
“If UF didn’t get Jordan, I wouldn’t try to get 
him to come here,” Joe said. “Josh is not the UF-
style running back, so I would never try to get my brother to come.”
Even without getting Josh to commit, Meyer 
has a well-established relationship with the Ha-den family. When Joe visited Gainesville as a re-cruit, the whole family met Meyer in his office. Jordan — then a high school freshman — let Mey-er know which school was his favorite.
“I always liked Florida, so I would play 
around,” Jordan said. “I would say, ‘I’m going to go grab my jersey.’”
Meyer might want to reserve a couple more 
uniforms: Jonathan Haden is in ninth grade and Jacob is in seventh.CHRISTIAN BECOMES COMMITMENT NO. 12: Hours after Jordan announced he was coming to UF, the Gators received their 12th oral commitment in Gerald Christian. Like Haden, Christian has ties to UF.
Christian, a tight end from West Palm Beach 
William T. Dwyer High, is the teammate of fellow future Gator Matt Elam.
“I wanted to go to a school with one of my 
teammates. I know I can’t base it off just that, but it did help some,” Christian said. “Matt was my biggest recruiter, to tell you the truth. He was tell-ing me like every game I needed to go to Florida with him.”
Christian has received offers from most South-
eastern Conference teams but chose UF because he liked the team’s strong fan base and The Swamp’s atmosphere when he visited during last 
season’s game against Miami.
He said he knew UF was the school for him 
after attending a team practice last week. UF wide 
receivers coach Billy Gonzales took Christian and his mom, Mary Brown, on a tour of the campus and talked to them about the team’s tutoring sys-tem. The 6-foot-3, 220-pound tight end has the op-portunity to watch players similar to him in UF’s offense.
“(The UF coaches) want me to play like Aaron 
Hernandez,” he said. “They see how big I am and, for my size, how athletic I am.”
Oral commitments are non-binding until a nation-
al letter of intent is signed on National Signing Day on Feb. 3, 2010.Tight end Christian newest UF commit

Most average people wish for the 
skill and talent to excel in one sport, 
maybe two if they’re lucky. But for oth-
ers, the possibilities are endless. When a 
person is blessed with the innate talents 
that Christian Taylor is, the sky is the limit.
With an athletic physique, a slender 
build and the speed of a gazelle, Taylor is the archetype of the multi-sport ath-
lete. Growing up, he played soccer and 
football, excelling in both. However, 
after a series of unexpected events, he 
would add another sport to his reper-
toire in his first year of high school.
The newest addition, track and field, 
quickly became his greatest passion.
From Football to Track
Taylor’s journey to track and field 
was an unusual one. Unlike the other sports he played, he got into track and 
field on a whim.
In his first year of high school, Tay-
lor decided to run track as a joke, for high school’s sake, but he began tak-
ing the sport seriously his junior year. 
He started traveling with a club track 
team, which solidified track as his new-
est forte. 
Taylor had little difficulty dropping 
what had long been his favorite sports 
and embarking on a path with his new-
found love. His cousin, a football play-er, made his decision a lot easier, and the early success he had in the sport 
closed the deal.“Football was an easy thing (to drop). 
I’m not a big contact person. I feel like if I can run fast,  the only contact I have is 
just high-fives,” Taylor said. 
His cousin was often injured, so Tay-
lor knew track and field’s non-contact 
environment was better for him. 
The wins rolled in for him through-
out high school. By the end of his four 
years, Taylor had compiled a lengthy 
list of accolades. 
He and his team won back-to-back 
Class-6A track and field state champi-
onships in 2007 and 2008, and he was 
named Georgia’s 2008 Gatorade Athlete 
of the Year.
His legacy includes the Georgia High 
School Athletic Association records for long jump, triple jump and the 400-me-
ter dash.
Of all his accomplishments, there is 
one that stands above the rest to Taylor: 
the 2007 World Youth Championship 
triple-jump crown.
“Winning World Youth (in 2007) 
was pretty big for me because that was the time where track started to become my life, and to be so successful so early 
was pretty good,” Taylor said.
He would carry his high school suc-
cess into the next phase of his life.
From Fayetteville to Gainesville
UF’s coaching staff had Taylor on its 
radar as soon as he entered the sport. The Gators admired his competitive-
ness and natural talents.
“When we were recruiting Christian, 
we knew he was a big-time guy and a big-time talent,” coach Mike Holloway said.
Choosing UF was a fairly simple 
decision for Taylor and his family, es-pecially after his mentor praised Hol-loway.
“Coming in, my old coach was like, 
‘Coach Mouse (Holloway) is gonna take care of you no matter what,’” Taylor 
said. “To have that kind of reference 
was pretty big for me.”
When Taylor arrived in Gainesville, 
he was immediately faced with his first 
taste of college athletic adversity: a 
coaching change.
Growing up, Taylor was accustomed 
to having long-term coaches. So when UF’s field events coach, Rana Reider, — 
who had been at UF since 2006 — left to 
pursue opportunities elsewhere, Taylor couldn’t quite grasp the change.
After Reider’s departure, another 
assistant coach, Brian O’Neal, began working with Taylor. 
Taylor and O’Neal found they shared 
common goals and had high expecta-
tions, so they quickly clicked. 
“Coach O’Neal sets high standards 
out there, which is great because I like 
to step up to the plate,” Taylor said. 
“He’s always telling me what I could 
do, but also he’s been a friend and that’s a big thing. 
“If I don’t want to talk about track, 
he’s been there just to be real. It’s helped a lot.” 
The chemistry between Taylor and 
his coach would set the stage for un-precedented success during his first in-
door season as a Gator.RUNAWAY SUCCESS

Athletically gifted Taylor finds niche in track
SEE TAYLOR, PAGE 3232, ALLIGATOR � WEDNESDAY, APRIL 22, 2009
 A Humble Champion 
 In possibly the most outstanding perfor-
mance by a freshman in UF history, Taylor 
highlighted his ﬁ  rst indoor season by win-
ning the men’s long jump, triple jump and 
4x400-meter relay, earning him the cov-
eted Commissioner’s Cup, given to the top 
point scorer at the Southeastern Conference 
Championships.
“Coach O’Neal was talking about the 
Commissioner’s Trophy for so long,” Tay-lor said. “My main goal was just get as many points as I can for the team. Whether it was second, third, no matter what, I was 
gonna give it my all.”
Taylor’s performance impressed his 
teammates and coaches alike, but he did 
not allow success to affect his behavior to-
ward others or his hardworking approach 
to his craft.
“The best thing about him as an athlete 
and as a person is his caring attitude to-wards his event, his teammates, his desire 
to be the best and to push his teammates to 
be the best,” O’Neal said. “The thing that 
separates Christian from some of the other 
elite guys is that he understands how tal-ented he is and he’s willing to work hard at his craft to be even better.”  
 Family Comes First 
 Taylor’s 14-year-old sister, Kaitlyn, 
laughed. She had no idea how good her 
brother was until she saw him at the SEC 
Indoor Championships. But his mom and dad, Stephanie and Ian, knew it all along.
“My parents and my sister were pretty 
happy. They were like, ‘We knew you had 
it in you,’” Taylor 
said. “My sister was in shock because she didn’t realize. 
My parents have always 
been the ones 
that are like, ‘You 
have so much potential.’”
The close relationship Taylor shares with 
his parents and sister is one of the driving 
forces of his success. He carries with him an 
insatiable need to make the most important people in his life proud.
“I’m a big family person, so I want to 
keep my parents proud (and) be a good 
leader for my sister,” he said. “She’s com-
ing up — she’s involved with track too — so I just want to give her something to look at to see the lifestyle, that if you’re success-
ful, this is how things could be.”Taylor’s desire to please his relatives 
stemmed from his father encouraging both he and his sister to have family pride.  
Ian set a clear path for accomplishing 
just that.
“We’ve always instructed both our kids 
that it is important to have family pride, and 
if they work hard enough to keep their fam-
ily happy, that means they’re doing a good 
job,” Ian said. “The whole driving force be-
hind Christian is always to do the best he can, and if he does the best he can, 
then the family 
is very happy 
with his perfor-mance.” 
 Sleep-Deprived Success 
 For a successful athlete, Taylor doesn’t 
get much sleep.  
“I don’t like to sleep too much,” he said. 
“That’s time where I can’t be thinking, vi-
sualizing what I need to do. But I get the 
rest I need.”
In this case, little sleep translates into big 
results.
Taylor has already won the ﬁ  rst indoor 
NCAA men’s triple jump championship in 
school history, and he will look to continue that success until he moves on from UF.
When that day comes, he hopes to have 
made an impact on his sport and on the 
people around him.
“In the end, I want the coaches and my 
teammates to (say), ‘He got the job done. He’s a funny guy, but when business needs 
to get done, he takes care of it,’” Taylor said.
His teammates have already begun to 
acknowledge this quality.
“He’s a laid-back, goofy type of dude — 
cool to hang with,” junior sprinter Calvin 
Smith said. 
“(On the track), he’s focused, ready to 
get the job done. He won’t quit on you. 
He’s gonna go 110 percent no matter what it is.”
Holloway is sure Taylor will have an im-
pact on the sport, not solely because of his talents, but also because of his personality.
“The thing that is gonna make Christian 
a world-class athlete someday is that he’s a world-class person,” Holloway said. “You 
can’t coach that. Give that credit to his par-
ents for the way he was raised.”
Clearly Stephanie and Ian did their part, 
and they did it well.
The rest is left to the gifted legs of Chris-
tian Taylor. Close-knit family ensures freshman athlete’s success on, off track
