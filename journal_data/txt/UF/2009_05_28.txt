Unﬁ  nished BusinessAfter his team’s historic, record-breaking 
season in 2008, UF coach Tim Walton 
said he didn’t think any other team 
would ever win 70 games, which his squad did en route to a Women’s College World 
Series semiﬁ  nals loss.
But he never said this year’s team 
couldn’t be even better.
It would have been impossible for the 
2009 Gators to rack up as many wins as they 
did last season, and it seemed unthinkable 
that a team could match or improve upon a historical year like 2008.
“We’re deﬁ  nitely a lot deeper and a lot 
more experienced and probably a lot more talented than we were last year,” Walton said. “Last year’s team knew how to play and did some special things, but this year’s team is starting to do a good job of being 
able to embrace that and could potentially 
even be better than we were before.”Now, UF is back in Oklahoma City. De-
spite how little has changed between this year and last year, this is a different team with a different mission.
The WCWS experience was brand new 
for UF in 2008, as it was the ﬁ  rst time in school history the team had reached the ﬁ  -nal leg of the postseason run. 
The Gators now have the beneﬁ  t of ex-
perience on their side, as all but three play-ers have already played on college softball’s biggest stage. 
Kelsey Bruder, the only new starter and 
the only unknown quantity before UF’s ﬁ  rst 
game this year, has proven to be one of the 
surest things on the roster. The sophomore has been dominant at the plate and the only consistent presence in the outﬁ  eld all sea-son.
UF has responded to the challenge of be-
ing the No. 1 team in the nation, a position it has now held for 10 straight weeks.Unlike last season, Walton has developed 
more depth at the plate and in the ﬁ  eld. Ju-nior Francesca Enea’s preseason ACL tear, 
senior Kim Waleszonia’s early season knee 
fracture and sophomore Tiffany DeFelice’s on-again-off-again wrist injury allowed some players to step into starting roles. 
With the injuries behind them, a 12-deep 
group of hitters and Stacey Nelson in the pitching circle, the Gators are even better prepared for a national championship run than they were last year.
No Pain, No Gain
It’s easy to assume that remaining injury-
free is one of the most important aspects of having a successful season. If only it were that simple.
The Gators only sustained one mean-
ingful injury in their miracle run last year, but it came in the WCWS when DeFelice — the ﬁ  ve-hole hitter — in-jured her left wrist. At the time, De-Felice was as hot as any hitter in the country. 
But the injury didn’t just cost UF 
one of its best hitters, it exposed a crack in the armor: The bench play-
ers were relatively inexperienced and 
untested.
“We really didn’t have any depth 
once you got past our starting nine,” Walton said. “This year, we’re going to go probably 10, 11 or 12 deep.”
This season, Walton made a noticeable 
attempt to get more of his players involved, even when everyone was healthy at the be-
ginning of the season. 
Enea’s torn ACL limited the number of 
innings she could play in the ﬁ  rst month or 
so of play, but senior Brooke Johnson proved to be a more-than-capable left ﬁ  elder and pinch runner whenever the need arose.
Despite the injury, Enea jumped out as 
one of hottest hitters in the nation and still had the luxury of resting her knee late in 
games when the Gators had a big lead.“We’re a little bit more experienced this 
year, and we’re able to overcome that adver-
sity and able to pick each other up,” second baseman Aja Paculba said. “One through twenty, we’re solid. With those injuries, we know that there’s someone on the bench who can come through for us.”
Freshman outﬁ  elder Michelle Moultrie 
brings the kind of speed on the basepaths and range in the outﬁ  eld that can prove in-
valuable in the postseason and has experi-
ence after seeing innings early on. 
Nobody could have predicted Waleszo-
nia’s knee injury that sidelined her for three months, but Moultrie’s early season experi-ence allowed UF to not miss a beat without the school’s career hits leader.
Moultrie and fellow freshman outﬁ  elder 
Alicia Sisco, who saw time in right ﬁ  eld as 
a result of Waleszonia’s injury, can now be 
used to mix things up even with Waleszonia back in the lineup.
“Different people are going to be suc-
cessful in different situations, and they’ve 
all gotten a chance to do that,” said student 
coach Mary Ratliff, who started in right ﬁ  eld last year. “Injuries are bad, but some-times they’re a blessing as well. We’ve deﬁ  -nitely gotten the best out of those, and now at the end of the season, people are back and ready to go.”
Ratliff, Walton and the rest of the coach-
ing staff have found themselves in an en-
joyable predicament: How do they ﬁ  ll out 
a lineup card every game with as many op-tions as they have?
The Gators have 12 players batting above 
.250 and nine above .300. They have more power hitting than they know what to do with — even Paculba, the leadoff hitter, has nine home runs with a .626 slugging percent-age. Shortstop Megan Bush, who usually 
bats seventh, has the numbers of a cleanup 
hitter: .338 batting average, 14 home runs, 43 RBIs and a .719 slugging percentage.
“You can’t pitch around anybody,” Wal-
ton said. “You pitch around Ali (Gardiner) and Francesca’s going to get you. You pitch around her, then Kelsey’s going to get you. And it just keeps going on down the road. Just when you think you’ve got it, then Mi-
chelle sneaks a bunt or a double in there.”
Being forced to overcome the adver-
sity has been a blessing in disguise for the 
Gators, but one of the most important ad-ditions to the lineup didn’t come from an injury.
Stepping In, Stepping Up
Ratliff — the starting right ﬁ  elder and 
only senior on last year’s team — consis-tently provided clutch hits when her team needed them and brought the kind of lead-ership one would expect from a senior. 
But if you ask her, someone else probably 
should have been playing her position.
“I tell (Walton) every day he looks dumb 
for not playing that Bruder kid last year,” Ratliff said. “I expected her to have a really good year, but I don’t think you can ex-pect someone to come in and do what she’s done.”
Last year, Bruder batted a meager .133, 
going 6 for 45 with one homer, seven RBIs and 15 strikeouts. Ratliff described the 2008 Bruder as one-dimensional at the plate — a straight, dead-pull hitter. 
“Kelsey’s done the same thing that all 
the great ones have done,” Walton said. 
“You look at Francesca’s freshman year and 
Stacey Nelson’s freshman year and Kelsey Bruder’s freshman year, and they learned how to play at this level. Kelsey’s no excep-tion to that.”
Bruder has done it all for the Gators in 
2009, batting second immediately following Waleszonia’s injury before settling in as the ﬁ  ve-hole hitter. Her stats are comparable to those of Enea — third on the team in bat-
ting average (.385), second in home runs 
(15) and second in RBI (66) — providing an invaluable luxury for the coaching staff and an absolute nightmare for anyone looking to pitch to the middle of UF’s lineup.
Bruder, a natural inﬁ  elder who will like-
ly take over at ﬁ  rst base next season, has bought into her role as an outﬁ  elder. She has been the starter in right for most of the 
season but has also occasionally moved into 
center, allowing Sisco to start in right ﬁ  eld or Waleszonia to take a less strenuous role upon returning from injury.
The sophomore’s performance has 
also made Ratliff’s transition from outﬁ  eld to dugout less stressful. As the right ﬁ  elder in 2008, Ratliff has taken comfort in the fact that her old 
position is in good hands.
“It’s been pretty easy. I take tre-
mendous pride in her,” Ratliff said. 
“It makes me feel like they’re a step better than we were last year. From her being one step better, we’ll see how much that pays off in the end.”
If Bruder’s breakout season puts the 
Gators one step closer to the program’s ﬁ  rst 
national title, then it could be their experi-
ence that pushes them over the edge.
Been There, Done That
Pressure is nothing new for UF.The Gators found themselves in a do-or-die 
situation against Virginia Tech in last year’s WCWS. In a 0-0 game in the bottom of the sev-enth and UF one loss away from elimination, 
the Hokies loaded the bases with no outs. 
Nelson forced a double play and a ground-
out to preserve the shutout and force the game 
into extra innings, and the Gators prevailed in the ninth thanks to some clutch hitting by Gar-diner, Enea and Ratliff.
“The good thing about this team is that 
we’ve been through every scenario,” Walton said. “We’ve had our backs against the wall, 
bases loaded, no outs in the College World Se-
ries with the season on the line. I don’t think there’s going to be a situation that they’re not prepared for.”
UF has seen every team’s best effort this sea-
son, as the team has been ranked No. 1 in the nation nearly all year. The pressure may have been too much in 2008 — and maybe even at the beginning of 2009, as the Gators dropped 
their third game of the year to Baylor.
“Now, I think we’re able to play as opposed 
to worrying about the expectations,” Walton 
said. “Everybody coming into the season was a little bit fearful of the expectations. So we just worried about how to play, and the other stuff just kind of takes care of itself.”
When the Gators once again step on to col-
lege softball’s biggest stage, it will come after 
a season full of dealing with expectations. 
The presence of ESPN cameras won’t have 
an effect on the team like it did last year — 
although the players will likely still pay more attention to their hair and makeup than they would for non-televised games, as Enea said every player does before taking the ﬁ  eld.
“We’re ready to go back, and that expe-
rience has paid off all season,” Ratliff said. 
“We’ve had the advantage of being on TV be-
fore. We just kind of get in a process and play the game. Once the ﬁ  rst pitch is thrown, you forget about those things. Last year’s experi-ence, I think, was key to this year’s team.”
Whether it was a learning experience or 
simply a tournament that last year’s team wasn’t capable of winning, UF has shored up its major ﬂ  aws from 2008, added much-need-
ed depth at the plate, added a talented young 
star and become the most experienced team 
in the ﬁ  eld.
Now, the Gators are ﬁ  ve wins away from 
an astounding two-year record of 135-8 and 
achieving the goal they made after the WCWS 
in 2008: bringing home the national champi-

It was raining late Tuesday after-
noon. Calvin Bryant, 66, sat on his 
porch with his 2-year-old grandson on his lap. 
“If I leave I can’t take them, where 
are they going to go until their moth-er gets situated?” Bryant said, refer-ring to his 2-year-old grandson and 9-month-old granddaughter. 
Bryant lives in Seminary Lane 
Apartments, which will be closed by Friday. Residents have to move out before the subsidized housing project is closed down due to inade-
quate floor plans, development and 
management. The closure was an-nounced earlier this year, and Bry-ant said that he still does not have a place to go. Bryant said that he qualified for 
a Section 8 voucher that would pay rent, but has yet to find anyone that will rent to him at voucher prices. 
He received the voucher a little 
more than two weeks ago.
The public housing project, 1019 
NW 5th Ave., is scheduled to be torn down on an unknown date.
“Hopefully soon,” said Karen 
Godley, vice chairman of Gainesville Florida Housing Corporation, Inc., the nonprofit organization that owns the complex. 
“The construction was not ad-
equate in the very beginning,” God-ley said. “The repair issues cannot be fixed easily.”
 Repair issues included uneven 
floors, lack of insulation and leaky roofs. LOCALSeminary Lane

� ASO HOPES THE GUN 
BOUNTY PROGRAM WILL BE MORE COST EFFECTIVE.

As of today, the Alachua Coun-
ty Sheriff’s Office will pay $1,000 to 
citizens who provide information 
regarding any crime in Alachua 
County when a gun is used.
ASO spokesman Steve Maynard 
said that considering some cases 
rack up a $50,000 budget before 
they are solved, the Gun Bounty Program will hopefully be more cost effective and take less time.
“It will be completely anony-
mous,” Maynard said. “We never have to see or talk to the callers face to face.” 
To ensure anonymity, the caller will receive a PIN and the location of a local bank where he or she can collect the reward money.
“A thousand dollars is a small 
expenditure to receive intelligence that will help us catch a robber or murderer,” Maynard said.
The idea for the program came 
from Deputy Kathy Zedalis who saw a rise in violent crime and began researching how to stop it from climbing.

guns that would interest Crime Stoppers should contact 352-372-7867.Anonymous tipsters

UF art major Sergio A. Castro, 22, is facing 
a felony charge of criminal mischief after be-
ing arrested early Tuesday morning while try-ing to spray-paint a memorial for his friend on the side of The Top restaurant in downtown 
Gainesville.
A Gainesville Police Department officer 
noticed Castro spray-painting the words “RIP 
MUCH” in gold on the side of the building alongside a paper mural of his friend, Barry Bernard, the 25-year-old Gainesville man whose body was found Monday near the Matanzas In-let in St. Johns County.
Bernard was swimming with friends at Sum-
mer Haven Beach on Sunday afternoon when he lost his boogie board and was overtaken by the rough waves.
Castro, wearing a black mask to hide his 
identity, stopped painting and walked away when he noticed the officer, according to a GPD incident report.After the officer caught up with him, Cas-
tro said he was trying to paint the words “RIP MUCH LOVE,” the report stated.
Castro also admitted to pasting a mural of 
his friend on one of the front windows of Amer-ican Apparel, 15 SW 1st Ave., where Bernard 
worked for more than two years.
Castro was arrested on one 
count of third degree felony 
criminal mischief, punishable by up to five years in prison and a $5,000 fine. In addition, 
because the alleged crime in-volved graffiti, it is possible Castro could face an addi-
tional fine of $250, if it is his 
first conviction. He could also 
be required to perform at least 40 hours of com-munity service.
A co-owner of The Top and a manager of 
American Apparel both said they did not wish to press charges against Castro.

TALLAHASSEE, Fla. — Gov. Charlie 
Crist has signed a bill that will make the 
zero-tolerance policies adopted by many Florida schools more tolerant.
Crist signed the bill Wednesday. Chil-
dren will no longer be arrested for insig-nificant violations such as petty theft, bringing plastic butter knives to school, drawing pictures of guns, throwing eras-ers or vandalizing property.
The bill’s sponsor, Jacksonville Re-publican Sen. Stephen Wise, has said it 
will save money and prevent kids from 
unfairly having criminal records.
It also will require schools that al-
low corporal punishment to review their 
policies at public meetings every three 
years.
The bill (SB 1540) passed the Senate 
39-0 on April 29. The House passed it 
119-0 two days later.

 Kansas zoo: Lion escaped after door left open 
GREAT BEND, Kan. (AP) — 
The 150-pound mountain lion that escaped from a central Kansas zoo enclosure before being killed by police went through a door left open by a zookeeper, zoo officials said.
The 14-year-old female was 
shot by police at the Great Bend Zoo on Sunday evening. Visitors were still at the zoo, but were quickly evacuated.
Zoo director Mike Cargill said 
Wednesday he decided to give law enforcement the OK to shoot after the lion became aggressive as they tried to recapture the animal. Cargill said the cat already had a reputation for being aggressive.
“Every animal here has a per-
sonality,” Cargill said.
The big cat, which was the zoo’s 
lone mountain lion, was cornered along a fence about 40 feet from the entrance to her own exhibit.
The lion traced the fence to the 
edge of the zoo’s timber wolf ex-hibit, became frightened, and ran back toward the grizzly bears. Eventually she crouched in some bushes next to the bobcat exhibit.
Cargill said the cat was never 
more than 150 feet from her own enclosure.
Great Bend police shot and 
killed the mountain lion less than 20 minutes after the escape. Car-gill said the cat died instantly.sion charges. In another case, a judge ordered the U.S. to pay a Florida doctor $600,000 for legal expenses after two prosecutors in Acosta’s office improperly ap-proved a secret tape recording of

WWII-era ship becomes sunken reef off Key West 
KEY WEST, Fla. (AP) — A 
13-year project to create a new artificial reef off the Florida Keys for sport divers and anglers cul-minated Wednesday with the scuttling of a 523-foot-long for-mer U.S. Air Force missile track-ing ship.
It took just a minute and 54

Key West City Manager and Vandenberg project admin-istrator Jim Scholl confirmed the ship settled on the bottom of the Florida Keys National Marine Sanctuary in an upright posi-tion.

Docs remove baby’s 2-pound tumor 
MIAMI (AP) — Miami doc-
tors have successfully removed a 2-pound tumor that covered an infant’s face.
The tumor was initially thought 
to be the baby’s undeveloped twin, but was later found to be just a mass.
Ramzi Younis, the pediatric 
surgeon at the University of Mi-ami/Jackson Memorial Medical Center described the surgery at a news conference Wednesday.
The tumor started at the back 
of little Jordan Smith’s mouth, rendering him unable to breathe when he was born in March. Doc-tors inserted a tube into the tumor and into his mouth.
Jordan remains in intensive 
care but is expected to be released next week.

Investigators say they can now

Sweeten called 911 before 2 
p.m. Tuesday in downtown Phil-adelphia, about 20 miles from where she said the abduction took place.

For the first time in UF history, 
the Gator Nation will have a say 
in who entertains the thousands of orange-and-blue clad fans at Gator Growl. 
Unlike years past, UF students 
and Gainesville community mem-bers now have a chance to vote for their favorite musical acts and come-dians to appear at the Oct. 24 event.
Until Friday, voting will take 
place on campus at the Reitz Union and Turlington Plaza and also at Publix and Zaxby’s.
The musical performers on 
the ballot are Sugarland, ZZ Top, O.A.R. and Third Eye Blind, while comedian prospects include Darrell Hammond, Demetri Martin, Dana Carvey and Jimmy Fallon. 
The Growl production team is 
confident that they can match the students’ decision monetarily, but whether the performers with most votes can make it depends on their schedule, said Growl spokesman 
Bryan Griffin.
If they can’t attend, the Growl 
team will ask the runners up to per-
form.
Griffin said the production team 
felt that opening the voting to the public would be more appropriate than basing the decision on its own choice.
“We want the Gator Nation to 
feel as deserving as the football team,” Griffin said.
In past years, the musicians and 
comedians for the show have been decided by “a more closed election process,” Griffin said. 
He said the production team 
may extend voting until Tuesday or Wednesday if it receives positive feedback from the voters.
Prior to the voting, a survey 
asked the public who it would like to perform at the 2009 show.
While it was only scheduled to 
last two weeks beginning on April 20, the production team extended 
the suggestion survey until May 18, 
Griffin said.The committee has been trying 
to announce the voting to students by sending e-mails from the UF List-serv, but it has had technical difficul-ties.
Although Growl is mostly fund-
ed by sponsorships that won’t be re-
ceived until fall, the committee was 
able to come up with a ballpark fig-ure based on last year’s budget. 
Because the production team 
could not determine the cost of po-tential performers, the committee was unable to offer voting until the sumer semester, Griffin said.
He attributed the fact that many 
musicians don’t determine their fall tour dates until the summer as an-other reason for the voting delay.
The committee would have 
loved for the voting to take place in the spring, he said.“We are trying to make it as ac-
cessible as possible,” Griffin said about the voting.
Although an appearance at 
Growl 2009 has not been able to be confirmed as possible by any of the potential performers, the team does 
have a price estimate of what it can 
afford to pay them.
The theme for Growl 2009 is 
“Legends of the Swamp,” honoring the senior class that brought UF two national championship titles. 
Griffin said the Growl team is 
hoping to bring in former football players for the show.
“It’s exciting and kind of bitter-
sweet to say goodbye to the Gators that led us to two national champi-onships,” Griffin said. “We want to honor some of the big names in the Gator Nation.”

After 10 years at Santa Fe College, Anne 
Kress will work her last day Friday before 
leaving to become the next president of Mon-roe Community College in Rochester, N.Y.
On Wednesday, students, faculty and staff 
piled into the Alan J. Robertson Administra-tion Building at SFC’s main campus to give tearful goodbyes and share fond memories of Kress.
“I enjoy watching you work,” SFC Presi-
dent Jackson Sassar told Kress during the fare-well party. 
Sassar said that although Kress’ leaving 
will be a big loss for Santa Fe, he is excited for her future and referred to her as the best aca-demic officer SFC has ever known.Kress joined the SFC staff in 1999 as an 
associate professor of Eng-lish.
Since then, she has 
earned titles such as English department chair, interim vice president and her cur-rent position of provost and 
vice president of academic 
affairs.
One of 32 applicants, 
Kress was named a finalist for the position in 
March and was named president of Monroe Community College on April 27.
While at SFC, Kress proposed the Title 3 
Math Research Grant and led the process for awarding bachelor’s degrees, Sassar said.
The college will start its first two baccalau-
reate degree programs in the fall.
Kress said the bachelor’s degree was her 
last big activity at SFC, and it’s what she would like to be remembered for.
“SFC will always hold a special place in my 
heart,” Kress said. “It is a wonderful asset to the community, and I am going to miss it so much.”SFC provost prepares for new position at NY college“We want the Gator Nation

In a sea of orange and blue, UF 
can now add green and platinum 
to its athletic rainbow.
The Heavener Football Com-
plex, UF’s most recent addition to Ben Hill Griffin Stadium, received a platinum certification from the 
Leadership in Energy and Environ-
mental Design Green Building Rat-ing System. 
Of the nation’s 130 platinum-
certified buildings, the environ-mentally sound Heavener Complex 
is the first in Florida and the first 
athletic facility in the United States to receive platinum certification. 
“We’re pretty excited about 
achieving platinum,” said Carol Walker, the vice president of the 
UF Facilities, Planning and Con-
struction Division, noting that the initial goal was to achieve silver 
certification.
The $28 million building, fund-
ed by the University Athletic As-sociation, has occupancy sensors 
to control lighting, organic carpet and paint and floors made out of 
recycled materials such as tires, 
Walker said.
Although the cost of construc-
tion was high, it will be balanced by lower operating costs thanks to energy efficient equipment that re-duces heating and air conditioning 
costs, she said.
Attention to energy efficiency 
helps the environment and people who use the complex, said Bahar 
Armaghani, the assistant director of UF’s Leadership in Energy and 
Environmental Design program. 
“And since we spend over 90 
percent of time indoors, we need to provide a healthy indoor environ-
ment for the people,” she said.
The complex also features low-
flow water fixtures, water-saving showerheads and touch-free doors to help combat germs. Building 
materials came from within 500 
miles of the complex to reduce transport-related carbon emissions 
and stimulate the local economy. 
The use of a point system can 
hinder the quality of environmen-tally friendly buildings, said David 
Eardley, president of the student-run organization Gators for a Sus-
tainable Campus. The stadium 
earned 52 out of the 69 available points for the certification.
“My main problem with [the 
program] is that, in my under-standing, you can pick and choose 
things,” he said. “You can do really 
well in water conservation and not so well in energy conservation – it’s 
a point system, so it really allows 
you to skimp in some areas.”
Armaghani said the stadium is a testament to who the students, fac-
ulty, administration and staff are at 
UF and where they stand in terms of saving energy and preserving the environment.
“It’s a great achievement for the 
UAA and the Gators, making them No. 1 in this area, too.”4, ALLIGATOR � THURSDAY, MAY 28, 2009

A well-traveled UF professor spoke 
about his experiences in South America to a crowd of 10 people gathered at the Civic 
Media Center Wednesday evening.
Stephen Perz, a UF associate professor 
of Sociology, discussed his work with local people from Bolivia, Brazil and Peru.                                                               
The three countries share common bor-
ders, known as the tri-national frontier, and Perz has been to the area more than 10 times 
during the past seven years to work to help local people more effectively participate in 
regional planning. 
Many local communities 
do not have access to informa-tion about large-scale changes 
such as new roads or climate change, which can still affect 
their lives, Perz said.
This can lead to social problems involv-ing human rights abuses as well as environ-
mental problems such as deforestation, as 
seen in the 1980s and 1990s. 
Unless local people get external support, 
it is very difficult for them to participate in regional planning to avoid these problems, Perz said.
“These things are worth doing because 
they need us and we need them,” he said.UF professor discusses regional planning efforts abroad

Today’s question: Are you a fan of “game night”? 54% YES46% NO
213 TOTAL VOTESTuesday’s question: Does water -
boarding constitute torture?From scrambling retire-
ment nest eggs to mak-ing housing foreclosures 
more prevalent than Starbucks on a Seattle street corner, the 
economic downturn has been 
a real, well, bitch. The latest to feel the wrath of the reces-sion’s iron fist? Student loan forgivingness programs.
According to an article in 
The New York Times, college graduates across the country find themselves financially 
strapped thanks to decreased 
funding of these programs. States such as California and Kentucky have turned to cut-ting student loan forgiveness initiatives to help balance a severely bloated state bud-get. Created as an incentive to lure students to embark in ca-
reers such as a special educa-
tion teacher or public interest lawyer, the programs offer a chance for a highly discount-ed degree for giving back to the community.While states have relied 
on nonprofit organizations to help foot the bill, the federal government continues to offer students a chance at a cheap 
education if they commit to 
teaching for five years in a low-income area. The loan forgiveness from the federal government, however, checks in at $17,500 — a small dent in the ever-rising cost of at-tending a four-year college or university. Simply put, more 
must be done to ensure the 
best and the brightest can be enticed to pursue careers in education and law that serve the interests of the masses. 
Given America’s current 
economic climate, our harsh reality ensures budget cuts will be made. Hell, few know 
better than UF students. But to 
dismiss student loan forgive-ness programs as a money saving cure-all reflects an ar-chaic ideology bound to breed ill-effects in the future.Let’s face it, a summer spent in good ol’ Gainesville is 
sure to include a healthy dose of partying from time to time.
Whether you enjoy drinking straight from the pitcher at 
Gator City or getting your swerve on listening to Notorious B.I.G. upstairs at Sharab, Gainesville offers a multitude of fine boozing establishments all over town.
But with late night bar crawls followed by the requisite 
early morning stop at Pita Pit for the finest in falafel, stu-dents often find themselves stumbling home oblivious to the dangers lurking in the dark.
As a result of increased criminal activity, specifically 
robberies near the UF campus, the UF Police Department released a tip sheet on Wednesday to help students stay safe. Ranging from not walking alone at night to staying in well-lit areas, the list offers a few fairly basic recommenda-
tions on how to avoid falling victim to robbery. Interestingly 
enough, the one tip that caught our eye suggested avoiding a level of intoxication that makes you an easy target.
What they are trying to say is go ahead and enjoy your 
Dos Equis, just don’t keep drinking until you’ve success-
fully convinced yourself you are the most interesting man 
in the world.
We’re not here to preach, nor are we pretending to be 
your parents. The Editorial Board has been known to fre-
quent a fair share of Gainesville’s water holes (OK, more 
like every bar) in our day. Rather, we hope a gentle remind-er of a few things you already know might help prevent an unfortunate situation from dampering your summer fun.
Not long ago, I had a friend, who was recently married, pull me aside in a men’s room when I had brought a date to have dinner with him 
and his wife. The desperation in his eyes told me all I needed to know. “Please tell me you’re going to sleep with this girl,” he told me, “because I can’t. My life is over. Look at me, look me in the eyes: Don’t. Ever. Get. 
Married. You got that? Ever. Don’t get me wrong, she’s 
great, but she’s ALWAYS THERE.” 
Frightening, isn’t it? As school has ended for so many this summer, deci-
sions must have inevitably been made about the future 
of many college relationships. Most will eventually go 
their separate ways, but some of them will end up stay-ing with their college sweethearts in the hopes of get-ting married and living happily ever after. And an idea 
like that is an idea on par with an invasion of China. 
Life together in college may have been fun, but that 
life you knew is over. 
Remember those endless Saturday nights spent clos-
ing down Balls, then adjourning to an off-campus house for a flip-cup tourney? Or those girls/guys trips to Ve-
gas or Miami or New Orleans, where you did things you swore you’d never speak of again? Or the excitement of meeting someone new in a place you never thought you 
would? 
Those are all, for the rest of your life, finished. 
You have doomed yourself to a world of social 
events that only include other couples. While your single friends incessantly drunk dial you with tales of 
their mid-20s, you’re already three hours deep into a so-
ber night’s sleep. The late-night flip-cup party has been replaced by a “party” that consists of you and three other couples sitting on a couch watching “It’s Me or the Dog.” 
That’s if you’re lucky enough 
to avoid “Grey’s Anatomy.”  
The craziest part of your so-
cial calendar becomes “game night,” where you might even 
invite over a few single friends 
for a rousing game of Piction-
ary. Or if things get REALLY out of control, a “couples vs. singles” game of beer pong. But the festivities won’t be lasting much past midnight, and your best case sce-
nario is a few minutes of drunk couple’s sex where the 
guy can’t function and the girl can’t move. 
Meanwhile your single friends have used this as a 
pre-party and won’t be getting home until you are get-
ting up. 
The highlight of your week will be watching playoff 
hockey with a guy you vaguely know from work, just 
so you can get out of the house. It’s not that you like hockey, or that your wife is even that bad. But when 
you spend every hour of every day with someone, you 
look for any, and I mean any, excuse to take a break. TV and movies like to make marriage look like endless love or complete misery. 
But in reality, it is neither. It is a lot of monotony and 
a lot of compromise, with a little resentment thrown in.
Or so I am told. In your 20s, you still have so much to accomplish and 
so much to experience, tying yourself to someone can 
only lead to bad things. There’ll always be other people, 
but you only get one life.

UF budget must include stimulus money
I know many of us are breathing a sigh 
of relief because the worst of the budget 
cuts facing the University of Florida a few months ago have not come to pass. Unfor-tunately, 67 people are still facing the pos-sible loss of their jobs  — many of them are 
the underappreciated staffers who keep the 
school running. 
Worse yet, many of them are facing that 
unnecessarily. At last week’s Faculty Senate meeting, President Bernie Machen revealed UF’s budget for 2009-2010 and explained that he felt he has to make cuts because the budget from the state-used federal stimulus money reflects dollars he is not sure he can rely on in future years. However, the presi-dent’s plan is ignoring that there will be a small increase in permanent dollars in the coming years: increased tuition. 
In 2009-2010, Machen reported tuition in-
creases will bring in $20 million more. 
Additionally, in 2010-2011 there will be 
about $6 to $8 million more even if the school is unable to get any donations for need-based financial aid (by state law 30 percent of new tuition dollars, or the same amount in donations, must go to financial aid). 
Why can’t the UF administration take 
some of the nonreccurring stimulus dollars 
to pay salaries this year until the new tuition 
money arrives next year? 
Surely that is preferable to laying off even 
more already overworked staffers.

Florida legislators guilty of self-interest
The Florida Legislature’s 2009 session 
may be over, but it should not be quickly 
forgotten.
From budget woes to the fall of indicted 
former Speaker Ray Sansom, this year’s ex-
tended session was one of the more memo-rable in recent history. 
Around here, it would be easy to think the 
University of Florida’s budget cuts were the 
worst thing to be debated, but smart voters 
will never forget a proposed bill equally as unnerving as the so-called “election reform” bill (HB 7149) that a group of self-interested legislative leaders attempted to ram through late in the session.
Touted as fraud reform, HB 7149 was 
actually designed to make it more difficult for Floridians to register and cast their vote. Instead of promoting true election reform to ensure that every voter and every vote counts, this proposed legislation was noth-ing more than a naked power grab. 
We should all be thankful that a strong, 
unified response from civil rights and elec-tion protection groups, and an outpouring of public opposition, ultimately thwarted it. Supporters of the bill, including House Speaker and Ocala Rep. Larry Cretul and soon-to-be Senate President and UF lectur-er Mike Haridopolos, made clear that they value their self-interest ahead of the best in-terests of Florida’s voters. Haridopolos and the majority leaders of both houses have al-
ready made it clear that they plan to attempt 
a similar self-serving power grab next year. 
Shame on them, and on all the legislators 
in Tallahassee who supported this bill, for trying to game our electoral system for their benefit.

7LSGinnie Springs needs to go green
I camped at Ginnie Springs two week-
ends ago and, overall, I was satisfied with my experience.
However, my friends and I were dis-
heartened that there were no recycling bins on site. We were disturbed to observe many campers and other visitors drinking and throwing their beer cans throughout the park and into the river.
The fact that Ginnie Springs is privately 
owned would make me believe that a stron-ger effort would be made to put a recycling program in place, but the opposite seems to be the case. 
As far as the river, knowing that this is 
public waterway, I find it unfortunate that there has been so much disrespect that seems to be condoned by a private entity that profits tremendously from its access to 
the river. 
If Ginnie Springs wants its customers to 
take its facility seriously as an “outdoor ad-
venture,” it is critical that it take greater re-sponsibility for its environmental impact.

During Tuesday’s Board of Trustees meeting, I voted to 
approve President Bernie Machen’s budget cut plan because it puts UF in the best financial position going 
forward and serves the interests of the entire student body as 
well as it can during these trying economic times. 
The first reason is that President Machen went about these 
cuts in the most respectful and efficient way possible. He was in constant communication with all of the department 
heads and engaged the Faculty Senate, as well as kept the 
student body informed at all times. I met with President Ma-
chen numerous times before I was convinced of this plan and 
know that this plan was constructed with our best interests 
in mind. 
President Machen did a great job putting off as many cuts 
as he could before he had to cut people, and this is the end result of that mentality. 
Another important reason is that these policies let us plan 
for the future and remain flexible. Some essential measures in this plan include as few cuts to staff and faculty as possible, the elimina-tion of minimal full programs and the postponement of $11.5 million that 
will be cut in the fall to give time to 
adjust for any possible market fluctu-
ations. I personally lobbied for these 
policies because if we were to use all 
of our federal stimulus dollars right 
off the bat to extend layoffs in hopes 
for better times, we would be doing a disservice to students. 
These policies leave UF in a safer place, economically 
speaking.
The combined revenue of these policies, as well as the cut-
ting of vacant positions and the elimination of non-personnel 
lines like travel and conferences, will make up for the budget 
shortfalls while protecting as much the value of every stu-
dent’s education as much as possible. We have to do the best we can with what we have and this plan does just that. Obvi-ously we would want to keep some of these programs and staff, but the path this agreement sets out for us delays layoffs as long as we can while still retaining the tools we need to 
achieve the goals of this great university. 
The way we handle these budget cuts will be one of the 
most important issues our university and my administration will face over the next year. Just as President Machen asked 
for any ideas or plans to help us deal with this issue, I ask for 
the same from my colleagues and from the students at UF. We 
will need the combined force of all of our resources to make 
sure that we go forward from this in a way that retains our 
status as a world-class, higher education institution. 
I know that we can overcome these troubles with the 
wealth of knowledge that we possess as a group and look for-ward to working with anyone with ideas to offer; students, 
faculty, and everyone in between.

� $11.6M IN CUTS STILL 
MUST BE ALLOCATED.
By THOMAS STEWART
Alligator Staff Writer
tstewart@alligator.org
UF’s Board of Trustees, the uni-
versity’s highest governing body, 
voted unanimously to approve $42.2 million in budget cuts Tuesday.
But UF Provost Joe Glover said 
after the meeting that students may not feel the effect on class sizes and offerings until two years from now, when the federal stimulus money being used to cover some of the cuts runs out.
The trustees approved the plan 
presented to them by UF President Bernie Machen. The same plan was sent to the UF community Friday. The plan includes $30.6 million in 
specific cuts and $11.6 million in un-
specified cuts.
The total cut is about 6 percent 
of UF’s $700 million state-allocated budget, said UF’s Chief Financial Officer Matt Fajack, which is smaller than the 10 percent worst-case-sce-nario cut UF was preparing for.Four faculty and 49 staff are slat-
ed to be laid off under the plan, in addition to about 150 positions that will be eliminated. These positions are vacant, will be vacant due to re-
tirement or are held by temporary employees whose contracts will 
not be renewed.
Machen will update 
the Board on the progress of finding 
ways to cut the remaining $11.6 mil-lion from UF’s budget by Oct. 31.
Machen also has until June 30 to 
consider alternate budget cut pro-posals from administrators. After the meeting, Machen said he expects some changes before the final bud-get is implemented.
“I think we’re gonna have some 
additional conversations with sev-eral units,” he said. “I think in IFAS (the Institute of Food and Agricul-tural Sciences) is where you’ll see a 
significant amount of change,” he 
said.
IFAS, which includes the College 
of Agricultural and Life Sciences, will take a $7.7 million cut, the larg-est of any unit at UF. Twenty-three layoffs, in addition to 82 position eliminations, are planned.Glover said after the meeting that 
when stimulus money runs out, it’s possible fewer students will be able to sign up for classes, class sizes might become bigger or that stu-dents will have a smaller selection of classes.
“It remains to be seen in two years 
how we manage this problem if the state hasn’t recovered,” he said.
The impact of the cuts on UF’s 
research is harder to determine, he said, but eliminating about 150 posi-tions will inevitably have an effect.
“That’s a substantial hit to the 
university’s research,” he said.

Student senators were able to find com-
mon ground during Tuesday’s Senate meet-ing after two weeks of fighting and many 
displays of partisanship. 
Beacause there are still many open Senate 
seats and senators approved recommenda-
tions for committees during the meeting, no new legislation was presented. 
However, Student Body President Jordan 
Johnson stopped by to get the approval for his nominations of two Student Government agency directors, Chomp the Vote and Night-life Navigators.
Law student Jenna Stern was approved 
unanimously to take over as the director for Chomp the Vote, an organization in charge of educating, registering and encouraging stu-dents to vote in local and national elections.
Johnson said he wanted to find someone 
with a grassroots personality and who was self-motivated.
Stern was a candidate for Senate during 
the spring election and represented the Or-ange and Blue Party. She also helped mo-bilize UF’s Barack Obama campaign and is currently in California working on another campaign.Law student Philip Erwin was also ap-
proved unanimously to take over as the Nightlife Navigator director, a position John-
son said he’d considered eliminating. 
This agency is in charge 
of promoting safe trans-portation solutions for stu-dents who are out drink-ing. 
Johnson said Erwin will 
act as a middle man be-tween students and club or 
bar owners, educating students on their op-tions when leaving a club after drinking.Johnson said he is also looking into acquir-
ing a Zingo service to prevent drunken driv-ing. The Zingo driver rides a scooter, folds the scooter into the person’s trunk and drives the customer home in his or her own car.
The program is used by the University of 
Georgia and the University of North Carolina Chapel Hill.
Before senators approved Johnson’s nomi-
nations, he lauded UF President Bernie Ma-
chen’s decision on how to allocate $42.2 mil-
lion in budget cuts.  
“We have to do the best we can with what 
we have, and I believe this plan does just that,” Johnson wrote in a press release.

Pedestrians walk by a graffiti tag and poster depicting Barry Bernard on the wall of The Top Restau-
rant Tuesday. Bernard’s body was found Monday near the Matanzas Inlet in St. Johns County.
to the GPD headquarters to see if he 
could help resolve the situation, but was unable to get any information about the case.
“At this point we’re just trying to 
figure out how to get him out,” Shil-lington said.
Castro was released later that 
night without bail on the condition that he’ll have no contact with The Top and that he won’t possess spray 
paint.
He was also given a curfew from 
10 p.m. to 7 a.m.
Shillington said he liked Castro’s 
tribute to Bernard and would not 
remove it.
“We’re gonna leave it up as a 
memorial,” he said. “It’s actually a really beautiful screen print of the 
guy.”
He said although he didn’t know 
Bernard personally, he recognized 
him as someone who regularly pa-tronized The Top.
“He seemed like he was a really 
sweet guy, and it’s just a tragic situ-ation,” he said.
Aurora Brink, manager of Amer-
ican Apparel, said on Wednesday that Castro came by that day to remove the mural of Bernard and apologize.
Brink said she wished she could 
have kept it up, or put up something 
of her own, but it goes against com-
pany policy.
She said there are other ways to 
memorialize Bernard, adding that everyone who works at the store was good friends with him.
“We were lucky to have known 
Barry for so long,” she said.
Castro said Sharab Lounge, 
where he bartends, will hold a si-lent auction Thursday night to help pay for Bernard’s funeral and to pay for his parents to fly from Haiti to Gainesville.

However, Bryant felt that the more than 50 
units at Seminary Lane were habitable, despite 
uneven floors and lack of insulation.
“I think we could live with that,” he said.But after five years of debt, the organiza-
tion that owned the project decided not to re-new its contract with the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development for 2009, which expires this month. 
“We decided to take these buildings down 
and build something simply more usable,” said Godley.
Several residents think that they are being 
evicted to make room for student housing.
“Personally, I think they are going to be an-

Lane resident, agrees. 
“This is prime real estate, five minute walk-ing distance to everything.”
The subsidized housing is located several 
blocks north of the UF campus.
“More student housing is too much,” said 
City Commissioner and UF Assistant Vice President of Student Affairs Jeanna Mastrodi-casa. “Student housing people will say it’s 
a bad idea because they have trouble filling 
them already, that’s why there’s a very large market.”
Although Godley said that the site will not 
be used for student housing, she is not sure what will be built there once it is torn down.
“We’re working in partnership with [the 
Gainesville Housing Authority] and the City,” she said. 
However, there is no record of the organiza-
tion formally asking the city for assistance, ac-cording to Bob Woods, the City of Gainesville spokesman.
City commissioners Mastrodicasa and Jack 
Donovan said that the organization declined help that the city offered. 
Many Seminary Lane residents, however, 
are asking for help.
Bryant, his 19-year-old daughter and his two grandchildren are not the only residents who haven’t found a place to live. Another such resident is Lee Lopez, 35, Bryant said.
“She had three kids, and they put her out, 
boarded up the house this morning,” said Masheria Mitchell, an 18-year-old Seminary 
Lane resident.
Brittany Lopez, 20, came to 
Seminary Lane from Arredondo Farms on Archer Road to look for her mother and 13-, 3- and 
2-year-old siblings. 
“You see what they did,” she said, pointing 
at the boarded up house. “They threw all my mom’s shit out!”
Bryant said he saw the Gainesville Hous-
ing Authority put clothes on the porch that morning.
Lopez did not qualify for a voucher be-
cause of the eviction, Brittany said.
Godley said that those with criminal re-
cords, substantial income or those who haven’t paid rent did not qualify for a voucher.
“They just need to help people,” Lopez said 
of the Gainesville Housing Authority.
Lorenzo Johnson, 50, questioned the Hous-ing Authority’s actions.
“How can you do that, put kids out? Look 
at this weather,” he said, motioning toward the pouring rain. “Ain’t no answer for that, whether you pay rent or not.” 
According to Godley, Housing Authority 
is doing a “stellar job” and has a list of places 
for residents to go. 
Donovan, however, thinks that they did a 
less-than-stellar job.
“They did not handle it well,” he said. “If 
you’re Housing Authority, your job is to get 
people safely into housing and if you’re not doing that, you’re not doing your job.”
But Donovan also said that the blame 
should not all be on Housing Authority. 
“Housing authorities in general don’t have 
enough money for maintenance.” 
Still, Bryant, who has lived in Seminary 
Lane for more than 20 years, feels that if they are kicking them out, “they are supposed to replace us.” 
Johnson wonders “who is going to help 
these people if Housing is not?”

be contacted for comment.Residents have trouble finding landlords who accept voucher prices

 With two BCS 
national football titles in 
three years, it’s unsurpris-
ing that Gainesville’s greatest 
sin is pride. But according to a research group, the sin 
means the college town exhibits diverse debaucheries.
Geographers from Kansas State University mapped 
the seven biblical sins county-by-county across the U.S., re-
vealing that Alachua is one of the most prideful counties in 
Florida.
Pride, the deadliest sin according to some, is mapped by 
combining the data from Envy, Wrath, Lust, Gluttony, Sloth 
and Greed, each of which is determined by a separate statistic, 
or group of statistics. Researchers split each sin into ﬁ  ve levels of 
intensity, and when mapped, the darkest is the most sinful, said 
Mitchel Stimers, co-author of the project.
In Alachua, Lust registered at the highest level of sinfulness, Envy, 
Wrath and Sloth reached the second highest, Greed placed in the mid-
dle level and Gluttony ﬁ  nished at the second lowest level.
Consistently high rates of sin pushed Alachua into the top 14 most 
prideful counties in Florida, even though it only ranked at the highest 
level in one of the six substantiating sins, Stimers said.
Jacob Larson, associate pastor at Vineyard Church of Gainesville, was 
surprised when he found out Alachua was high up on the scale of pride.
“I guess we have the Gator Nation here,” Larson said. “And we’re very 
proud to be Gators.”
However, it’s worth having the pride that develops a sense of individual-
ism and pushes people to give back to humanity, he said. 
“It’s giving credit where credit is due,” Larson said. 
The dangerous part is when pride starts to dehumanize, he said. 
“If you choose to love yourself more than anyone else you.... commit atroc-
ities to another person because you love yourself that much,” he said. “The 
self-love begins to kill you eventually.”
Envy was tied to the number of thefts per capita. 
Although the crime rate decreased in Alachua by 3.3 percent from 2007 to 
2008, larceny has seen a slight increase in the same period, according to Art Forgey, public information ofﬁ  cer for Alachua County Sheriff’s Ofﬁ  ce.
Some of the crime statistics can be blamed on the worsened economy be-
cause people often become desperate under ﬁ  nancial stress, he said Alachua’s 
large student population might also explain some larceny cases, he said. 
The start of the school year shows a noticeable increase in robberies. Scoot-
ers, cars and other personal belongings are often stolen from students. 
“Many students tend to leave their cars and apartments unlocked,” he 
said. “For most of them it’s their ﬁ  rst time on their own.”
Wrath was plotted by the number of violent crimes per capita.
Cities tend to have higher crime rates. But demographics and popula-
tion size are very important when comparing data among counties, ac-
cording to Steve Maynard, 
Alachua County Sheriff’s 
Ofﬁ  ce spokesman.“It’s  
a very tough question,” he said. “In compari-son with huge counties like Broward our crime rate is probably relatively low.”
He doesn’t believe UF con-
tributes to the number of violent crimes. Common crimes, such as bike theft and underage alcohol consumption, are more preva-lent among students, he said. 
The number of violent offens-
es in Alachua, which include rape, assault, threats and stalk-
ing, increased by 6.2 percent 
between 2007 and 2008, accord-ing to the Uniform Crime Report Domestic Violence Data for Alachua County. Stalking and threats made a large part of the increase. 
For Lust, researchers used the number 
of sexually transmitted diseases per capita.  One reason for Alachua’s high rate of STDs 
could be the younger population, according to 
George Gibbs, regional program manager for the Alachua County Health Department. 
The most common sexually transmitted diseases 
in Alachua are gonorrhea and Chlamydia, which are largely carried by people between 15 and 24 year old.
Gluttony was determined by fast food restaurants per 
capita. Alachua’s low score on the Gluttony scale could be be-cause Gainesville is one of the 25 most educated cities in U.S., 
according to Roland Loog, director of Visit Gainesville, which 
provides visitor information. Knowledge generally leads to higher income, and Loog believes educated populations shop for healthier food, he said.
Greed was measured by comparing the ratio between average income 
per capita and the number of individuals below poverty line. A higher ratio meant there is greater separation between social classes. 
Stimers has received some criticism over his team’s choice of sta-
tistics, particularly those tied to Gluttony and Sloth.
Originally, as shown in the maps, Sloth was determined by a com-
parison of money spent on arts, entertainment and recreation against unemployment rates.
Under pressure to have the presentation ready for a geographers’ 
conference in mid-March, the research team had to choose data that not only represented the sin but also was available for analysis, Stimers said.
“You can think of an idea theoretically, but then you have 
to get the scientiﬁ  c data for it,” he said. “It’s art as much 
as science.”
Stimers said the data is in the process of re-
evaluation with a focus on Gluttony and Sloth 
because their distributions didn’t show a 
clear pattern on the maps. Gluttony will 
be re-plotted with child obesity rates 
and Sloth will be updated with 
more detailed information on expenditures from the U.S.

With an inventory of over 5,000 films, Video Rodeo, an independent movie rental store on University Avenue,  has flourished in its five-year history.

PizzaDowntown Gainesville will be swingin’ 
to the sounds of live jazz Friday night.
At 8 p.m., the Gainesville Community 
Jazz Band will perform as part of the Down-
ton Plaza’s “Free Fridays” concert series.
The 17-piece ensemble will play various 
favorites from the 1930s, and ‘40s, includ-
ing pieces from Count Basie and best-selling 
jazz musician Glenn Miller.
“I think it’s going to be a nice evening of the old recognized big band hits and tradi-tional swing,” said David Ballard, direc-tor of events for the Division for Cultural Affairs. 
The Gainesville 
Community Jazz Band was formed in the summer of 2007. The Friday event will mark its first time performing as a part of the “Free Fridays” concert series.
“We are honored 
and privileged that we were asked to perform,” said Marco Thomas, director of the Gainesville Com-munity Jazz Band. “We’re looking for-
ward to providing some really good music.”
Sponsored by the City of Gainesville Department of Parks, Recreation and Cul-tural Affairs, “Free Fridays” is held in the Bo Diddley Community Plaza, located on the corner of Southeast First Street and East University Avenue.
The series runs from 8 p.m. to 10 p.m. ev-
ery Friday night through Oct. 30.
“I think it’s a wonderful opportunity to 
get citizens to come downtown,” Ballard said. “It brings a lot of the local music to-gether with local residents.”

Division of Cultural Affairs event director““STEVE JOHNSON  � AVENUE WRITER“Weather is a great metaphor for 
life — sometimes it’s good, some-
times it’s bad, and there’s nothing 
much you can do about it but carry 
an umbrella.” 
Pepper Giardino probably uttered 
this often-quoted phrase long before 
multicolored rain boots and custom-
print umbrellas hit the scene. Nowa-days, there’s a lot you can do about a rainy situation. And better yet, you can do it with style.
For one reason or another, people 
tend to assume that gloomy skies require gloomy attire. At UF, this is rarely the case. Walking around cam-
pus on a rainy day is almost like go-
ing to an art festival. 
Boots and umbrellas act like can-
vases that display patterns — from zebra prints to polka dot, flowers to 
skulls — it’s all stretched across those 
rambunctious rubber boots. Students bustle across the wet ground shel-tered by a canopy of umbrellas, each its own work of art — florals, stripes, paisleys, Monet’s — they’re all cov-ered. 
The parade of candy-colored rain 
gear is enough to have anyone look-ing forward to the next thunder-storm.
But still some people insist on 
wearing the gloomy weather on their 
sleeves, with baggy sweats and clunky sneakers, when there’s really no 
need for the clothing 
to reflect the atmosphere. It’s fun and 
easy to stay stylish even on the drea-riest days. 
With weather this blue your out-
fit should be a way of changing the mood.  
UF business and advertising stu-
dent, Amanda Freilich knows this. 
Despite the wet streets, she sports 
an outfit that defines fashion-meets-function. With an American Apparel hoodie, leggings and Converse, she stays cute and comfortable. To cop her look, pick up an um-
brella with a playful pattern, (Freil-ich found hers at Publix), and wear it with neutral-colored clothing that 
have some colors found in the um-
brella’s design. Leggings are perfect for the rain; they avoid the heavy drag of wet jeans.
Finally, slip on closed-toe shoes, 
like Sperry Top-Siders, sneakers or flats, so that your feet don’t get cold. 
If wild-patterned boots or um-
brellas can’t be found in your closet, 
don’t fret. You can still turn heads by 
borrowing a color from the rainbow. Bright clothes don’t only stand out against the natural gray backdrop, but the color also provides confidence 
that will help brighten your day. 
The fashion forecast for the rest of 
the summer is sure to include more 
outrageous rain gear to get you ex-
cited for the next drizzly day. But be 
sure to always have your foldable umbrella, because summer weather can be just as spontaneous as you are.THURSDAY, MAY 28, 2009 � ALLIGATOR, 15
MUMBAI, India (AP) — The mak-
ers of “Slumdog Millionaire” met the 
film’s two impoverished child stars on Wednesday and reassured them they will soon have new homes. But the fa-ther of one of the children stormed out, 
saying the filmmakers have not done 
enough to help.
Rubina Ali, 9, and Azharuddin 
Mohammed Ismail, 10, both lost their homes this month after city authori-ties demolished parts of their slum in Mumbai. Rubina has been staying with relatives and Azhar has been living in a 
makeshift shanty of tarps and blankets 
with his parents.
“We’ve been trying for a long time 
to move them into legal accommoda-tion,” director Danny Boyle told report-ers at the Tata Institute of Social Scienc-es on the outskirts of Mumbai, where he and producer Christian Colson met the children and their families.
Relations between the filmmakers and the children’s families have grown tense since the phenomenal success of the film, which grossed more than $326 million.
The filmmakers set up a trust aimed 
at ensuring the children get proper 
homes, a decent ed-ucation, a monthly stipend and a nest egg when they fin-ish high school. They have pledged to 
spend up to $100,000 to buy the two fami-
lies new apartments 
and have donated 
$747,500 to a charity to help slum chil-dren across Mumbai.
Colson has described the trust as 
substantial, but will not tell anyone how much it contains — not even the children’s parents — for fear of making the youngsters vulnerable to exploita-
tion.Nirja Mattoo, who helps oversee the 
children’s trust, said a new home has 
been found for Azhar’s family near to his school and neighborhood. “We are finalizing the deal. Next week it should be done,” she said.
The hunt for Rubina’s house contin-
ues, she added.
But Rafiq Qureshi, Rubina’s father, 
said Boyle has not done enough.
“It’s no big deal for them, this kind 
of money. It’s been five or six months we’ve been living in such difficulty. They should help us,” he said in an in-
terview after he cut the meeting short 
in anger.
“After the Oscars they forgot about 
us,” he added. “For two months we didn’t get any money.”
Mattoo declined to comment on 
Qureshi’s behavior.
“We’re trying our best to get it (a 
house) as soon as possible,” she said by 
phone.

‘Slumdog’ filmmakers meet kid stars
NEW YORK (AP) — Chris Brown tells his fans he’s 
“not a monster” in a video posted on YouTube.
In it, the 20-year-old singer leans in and speaks di-
rectly into the camera, which appears to be positioned 
in front of a bowling lane. He talks about his new al-bum called “Graffiti,” and a single expected this sum-mer.
Then he says: “Everybody that’s haters, they just 
been haters. All my real fans, I love you. I ain’t a mon-ster.”
Brown, who’s been charged with felony assault 
and making criminal threats against Rihanna on the night of the Grammy Awards in February, did not mention his former girlfriend.
It’s not immediately clear when the video was shot.

While most people are still 
renting movies from stores like 
Blockbuster and Movie Gallery,  a small local video store is thriving in the shadow of these corporate 
giants cast. 
Video Rodeo, 1119 W. Univer-
sity Ave., has been able to grow in 
spite of the big wigs in the movie rental business and become a part of the community.
Roger Beebe, an associate pro-
fessor in UF’s  English depart-
ment, started the 
store five years 
ago with 2,000 VHS tapes he had been storing in his house.
“When I opened it, I didn’t 
have any sense of a business plan,” Beebe said. “I didn’t know if we would be able to pay the bills.” 
Now, almost five years later, 
the store has more than 4,000 reg-istered customers and about 5,000 videos.
Not only does the store run suc-
cessfully without a business plan, it also runs without  management as an employment cooperative, where every employee owns an equal share of the business.
The employees meet monthly 
to decide what new movies they will order, and who deserves a bonus for doing extra work like hanging fliers around town.
Unlike other movie rental stores, Beebe said the staff adver-tises as little as possible to save money to buy new DVDs for the store.
What little advertising strategy 
Video Rodeo has consists of mak-ing fliers which are mainly aimed at “sticking it to ‘The Man.’” 
On Video Rodeo’s Web site, 
the staff advertises its popular fish bowl full of shredded Blockbuster cards. Anyone who cuts up his or her card in the store receives a dis-counted video rental.
Although larger corporate 
stores often order every video re-leased in theaters, Video Rodeo is more discerning. 
Which ever video the store’s 
staff likes is what it orders, said Allison Bittiker, a Video Rodeo employee.
“Sometimes I feel like I have 
seen all of the movies in the store,” Bittiker said laughing. “I don’t know exactly how many I‘ve seen; we have over 5,000 rentals, and I have seen almost half.”
With three-day rentals for $3 a 
video, the store may become even more popular in the community, especially with the current econo-
my, she said.
Katie David, a regular custom-
er, said she loves that the store is 
not a huge corporation. She also  enjoys its selection of foreign films and documentaries.As long as Video Rodeo con-
tinues to carry the type of films these customers love, it’s certain 
their customers will come back 
for more.
“We feel kind of communitar-ian,” Beebe said. “We’re a part of the community that a lot of people support.”
No matter how popular the 
store becomes, Beebe said he nev-er wants to franchise it or even open another branch. 
“I think that it would be crazy 
to try to franchise it,” Beebe says. 
“What’s good enough for me is 
just to keep the collection grow-ing.”sex on the avenueMaybe it’s due to the recession, but when 
it comes to sex, corners are being cut.
Full-body massages have been down-
sized to shoulder rubs, dry humping has 
filed for bankruptcy and you can’t find de-
cent oral anywhere.
After a long day at work or in class, all I 
want is some good sex. I can feel the stress build up, but after a slew of sexual medioc-
rity my sexual urge has been doused. I need 
greatness in my life. 
Good sex is more than just the insertion 
of a penis into a vagina. Sex is like a magic stew, it’s about giving and taking, using the right amount of creativity, with the correct dose of spontaneity and an overflow of pas-
sion to produce a recipe you’ll love.
After a little introspection on past experi-
ences, I realized that my top three sexual en-
counters were memorable because of amaz-ing foreplay. Not necessarily hot-body oils 
and tantric massages, but mental foreplay, 
in addition to soft kisses, tight squeezes and passionate nibbles. 
It is well known that foreplay is the “Yel-
low Brick Road” to orgasm. And if we’re on the same ride — then great sex is the desti-nation. So, why isn’t everyone anxious to bring 
out the whips and chains, suck toes or lick the chocolate syrup off of normally con-
cealed body parts? 
The answer: Time. According to the 
most recent Durex survey, the average cou-
ple spent 20 minutes engaging in foreplay. 
Well, I guess I’m way below average 
then. Twenty minutes – already my little head is calculating. I don’t have time for that. If I wanted to be proactive, I guess I could schedule an hour for sex into the 
Blackberry before work, in between study-
ing or during my break. But that’s a little excessive. What I’m saying is that it gets easy to 
get caught up, but foreplay (like sex) gives the bodies a chance to release, unite and ex-
plore. Sex is amazing when done correctly, 
and it shouldn’t be cheapened with half-ass foreplay tactics. It gets easy for two people to get stuck in a repetitive sexual rut, but there’s a way out.
Relax and use every minute necessary 
to get to orgasm number one…two…or three.... Because what else would you rath-er be doing than having great sex? Nothing. 
So, let the clothes slide off and enjoy your 
life – you owe yourself.16, ALLIGATOR � THURSDAY, MAY 28, 2009

For me, there’s no better way to spend those 
long, summer afternoons than with a matinee. 
Especially when mom’s paying.  
When I was filling out a Mother’s Day card 
a few weeks ago, I realized that some of the best moments I’ve shared with my mother have been in empty movie theaters on sum-mer afternoons. Since I was little, my mom would lure me out of the house to see a movie — a subtle tactic to get to know me better. 
I wasn’t the teenager who revealed his emo-
tions in Sharpie ink on his forearm, so these cinema outings were, for her, a good way to make sure her son wasn’t a psychopath. 
It was a challenge. One week I’d want to see “Pokemon: The Movie,” and the next I’d be in a “Moulin Rouge” mood. It’s not easy finding a pattern between two movies that have noth-ing in common besides colorful visuals and killer soundtracks. 
But mom was 
always sweet about giving in to the shal-low interests of a teenager. Not many mothers could sit through three hours of subtitles during “Godzilla 2000,” which turned out to have nothing to do with the awesome 1998 “Godzil-la” with Matthew Broderick. Not many moth-ers would sit through that “Godzilla,” either. What began as a bonding moment be-
tween mother and son transformed into an experiment of Oedipal tensions whenever sex-ual scenes would appear on screen. I’d mutter 
something like, “Here we go” or “Really?” as if I was as morally out-raged by Kate Winslet’s breasts as I assumed my mother was. In reality, our thoughts were more like:
Me: “Boobs!”
Mom: “He’s probably thinking, ‘Boobs!’”And while I predicted the awkwardness 
of movies like “Charlie’s Angels,” other times it snuck up on me. “Pleasantville” wasn’t marketed as a movie featuring a housewife pleasuring herself in a bathtub, but bam — there it is, projected on a 30-foot screen, while my mother offered me a handful of Buncha Crunch. 
But despite it all, I cherish those moments. 
My mother and I may have been the only two people who saw “K-PAX.”
 I doubt even Kevin Spacey took his mother 
to see that. 
So this summer, when you’re seeing 
“Harry Potter and the Books People Re-placed with Twilight” or “Transformers: Toys Blow Up More Stuff” consider taking mom along. 
Otherwise you might have to actually have 
a conversation or something.

Jacob Adams, manager of Spin Cycle on 
West University Avenue, has organized 
three races since April.
He said it usually takes about a month 
to plan the manifest accordingly with the theme of the race and to get the sponsors 
and volunteers ready for the event. 
“Part of the fun of the race comes from 
not knowing the course until you receive 
the manifest,” said Adams as he explained 
why he does not race in the events he or-
ganizes.
In the planning period, Adams also 
advertises for the event with posters and fliers locally and by posting the event on 
www.flfixed.com, a bicycle forum for cy-
clists on fixed-gear bikes*. 
He also designs the spoke cards** used 
during the race.
“A lot of people keep them as a me-
mento to show they’ve participated in the event,” said Adams.
The race he is preparing for now, the 
Postman’s Calling Alley Cat on May 30, is themed after the 1997 Kevin Costner film, 
“The Postman.” The manifest will include 
the four local post offices in Gainesville. Each post office will clue bikers as to where their next location should be.
Using a similar concept, the Easter Cat, 
held on the weekend of April 12, required racers to get off their bikes at each loca-tion and find an Easter egg with their next 
clue. 
Fun and Games
The scavenger hunt feel and the sense of 
community among the cyclists in the Alley 
Cat races allow racers to see the race as fun rather than purely competitive. 
“They aren’t so much about the compe-
tition so much as the community of like-minded cyclists getting together and having a good time,” said Michael Pedron, board member of The Kickstand, Gainesville’s Community Bike Project. “The fun happens before and after the races.” 
Participants are encouraged to dress in 
costume according to the theme of the race and stay after the races for parties hosted by the sponsors. 
For the race on Saturday, participants in 
costume will be eligible to enter both a cos-tume contest and the race itself.
For the Easter race, Adams dressed as the 
Easter bunny for the race, and for another race he participated in, him he and Dave Vollbach, also an employee at Spin Cycle, rode tandem*** in neckties without shirts. 
“At all bike races, there is a very fun at-
mosphere, but Alley Cats is the most fun,” said Vollbach. “It’s just a bunch of people having a good time. You can race hard and you can still have a good time. It’s all about the attitude.” 
Safety first, 
most of the time 
In the spirit of competition, Vollbach 
was stopped by a police officer for weav-ing through traffic and running through a red light. 
“He asked me if it was worth it to risk 
my life for a race,” he said. “I answered, ‘I don’t know, it’s still early.’”
Vollbach’s desire to quickly resolve his 
confrontation with the officer landed him in the back seat of the officer’s patrol car, handcuffed, for 15 minutes before he was allowed back on the course. 
He finished in 18th place, a feat which he 
is still proud of. 
The races are held on the open streets of Gainesville, leaving the decision of wheth-
er or not to follow safe traffic laws up to 
the racers. 
“The races are informal, but it’s not the 
kind of thing I’d encourage kids to do,” said Vollbach. There’s no permission on the 
road to hold these races, the roads are still 
working. The races are more of a party at-
mosphere than a family one.”
Race to help the hungry 
The entry fee to participate in Saturday’s 
30 race is $5 and a non-perishable food item which will be donated to the Bread of the 
Mighty food bank. The food bank will be among the stops on the manifest and the racers will drop off their food item during 
the race. 
Spin Cycle has also been working with 
Mother Earth Market by collecting food 
items all week for the event. 
This is the first time Spin Cycle worked 
with a charity during their races, but Ad-
ams said the volunteers who work each race 
play an important role in the event because the profits from each race are minimal. The Postman Calls 
Registration for the Postman’s Calling 
race will begin at 3 p.m. The race will start in front of Spin Cycle at 4 p.m., and a party with live bands, DJs and food will follow af-
ter the race at the bike shop. 
Adams plans on sponsoring a bike race 
every month of the summer. His biggest 
project is the Labor Day weekend race, dur-ing which he hopes to hold events every day 
of the weekend. 
“I really enjoy Alley Cat racing because 
they are more fun oriented than ordinary rac-
ing. You don’t have to worry about having the right bike or the right clothes,” he said. “Part 
of what we’re doing with Alley Cat racing is 
making people aware that there’s a lot going 
on in Gainesville as far as cycling.”

Alley Cats, a generic term for inner-city bike

The Road to Omaha begins in 
Gainesville.
No. 11 UF (39-20), winners of 
the No. 8 national seed, will begin 
its quest for a College World Series berth this weekend when it hosts a NCAA Regional that includes Miami, Jacksonville and Bethune-Cookman.
The Hurricanes (36-20) will 
open the action Friday with a 1 p.m. matchup with the Dolphins. The Gators will begin their NCAA play at 6:30 p.m. against the Wildcats. 
The winners of Friday’s games will 
meet at 6:30 p.m. Saturday, and the losers will meet at 1 p.m.
“We are very excited for the 
start of Regional play,” coach Kev-
in O’Sullivan said. 
Bethune-Cookman will send 
right-hander Hiram Burgos (6-3, 
3.73 ERA) to the mound while the 
Gators have yet to announce their starter for Friday night’s opener.
UF will hope to improve upon 
its recent failures in the postseason. 
In the two years under O’Sullivan, the Gators are 1-6 in Southeast-ern Conference Tournament and NCAA Tournament play.
Last year UF went to Tallahassee 
for its Regional and was promptly sent home with two straight losses to Tulane and Florida State.
Playing at McKethan Stadium 
should provide a boost for the Gators.  UF is 27-7 at home this season, and the last time it hosted a regional was 2005 when UF swept the Regional and Super Regional rounds in Gainesville en route to a CWS berth Overall, UF is 22-7 at 
home in NCAA play.
UF’s national seed means the 
Gators would host a Super Regional 
if they advance past this weekend. 
The weekend’s biggest challenge 
would seem to be the Hurricanes 
who swept the Gators in a three-game series in Gainesville on Feb. 27 - March 1.

After a nightmarish first day, the 
Gators drastically improved their per-
formance in the second round but could 
only improve their position on the lead-erboard by four spots.
The No. 6 UF men’s golf team still 
finds itself in 25th place with a score of 29 over par as it heads into the third round of the NCAA Championships in Toledo, Ohio. 
Despite the team’s score of 26 over 
par in Tuesday’s first round, the Gators fared a lot better on Wednesday and shot 3 over par for the round.
“We’ve played poorly and even 
though today was a little better, we haven’t played well enough to give our-selves a chance to be successful,” coach Buddy Alexander said.UF might have dug too deep of a hole 
in the first round for it to come back.
“It was an incredibly disappointing 
day and a day we might not be able to recover from,” Alexander said.
After today’s third round, the field of 
teams will be cut to eight. 
The Gators will need 
a miraculous round to make up the 16-shot gap between them and the eighth spot.
Senior Billy Horschel did his part on 
Wednesday with a second round score of 3 under par, pushing his tournament score to 2 over par. He will enter today on a high note after finishing the second round with four straight birdies.

After the then-unranked UF women’s 
track and field team won the Southeast-
ern Conference Outdoor Championships nearly two weeks ago,  its focus shifted from an SEC title to an NCAA title.
The men’s and women’s track and 
field teams are traveling to Greensboro, N.C., to participate in the 2009 NCAA East Regional this weekend. 
According to the U.S. Track and Field 
and Cross Country Coaches Association, the men’s track and field team is still ranked first in the nation and the wom-en’s team rose to number 16 in the polls. 
UF has had a lot of success at NCAA 
Regionals in the past. Both teams won the East Regional in 2003 and 2004.  The men have never placed lower than second at 
the event.This is the first meet since the SEC 
Championship where the women shocked 
LSU and Tennessee and won the SEC ti-
tle, while the men came in second behind Arkansas.
Field events will begin on Friday at 11 
a.m. with the men’s javelin. The week-
end’s meet will wrap up on Saturday 
evening with the men’s 
4x400 meter relay.
“We have to have as 
many scoring opportu-
nities as we can to win NCAA titles,” UF head coach Mike Holloway said.
Following the SEC 
Championships, junior Mariam Kevkh-ishvili, who set a new SEC record in the shot put, felt she could do better than her 
winning throw of 59-2.75/18.05m.
“I will be ready for regionals,” she said 
following the meet.

ORLANDO — Orlando Magic center 
Dwight Howard had his technical foul 
from Game 4 of the Eastern Conference 
Finals rescinded by the NBA.
Howard was given his sixth technical 
of the playoffs for taunting Anderson Varejao after a layup in the third quarter 
of the Magic’s 116-114 overtime victory 
Tuesday night. 
Cleveland’s forward had draped his 
arms around Howard in a failed attempt 
to stop him from scoring.
The NBA announced it was rescind-
ing the foul Wednesday. Under league rules, Howard would 
have been automatically suspended for 
one game if he received a seventh tech-
nical during the play-offs.
The Magic lead the 
Cavaliers 3-1 in the best-of-seven series. 
Game 5 is Thursday 
night in Cleveland.
Howard and Magic 
coach Stan Van Gun-
dy were baffled by 
the technical Tuesday, saying after the game that Howard had simply made a 
big basket and was enthusiastic in the moment.
“I wasn’t taunting Varejao or any-
thing,” Howard said after the game. 
“My thing, it was a tough play. He 
grabbed me around the neck and I made 
the shot.”
Howard already was suspended one 
game in the Magic’s first-round series 
for his elbow on 76ers center Samuel 
Dalembert. 
Howard had joked after receiving his 
fifth technical foul of the postseason that 
he was going to start wearing thick el-
bow pads and duct tape his mouth.
“I might have to get some duct tape 
for real,” Howard said after Game 4.Howard’s technical rescinded by NBA

PARIS — On a day of good-
byes at the French Open, Maria 
Sharapova managed to stick around.
Trailing through most of the 
third set in her toughest test since shoulder surgery, Sharapova pulled out a 6-2, 1-6, 8-6 victory over 11th-seeded Nadia Petrova on Wednesday to reach the third round at Roland Garros, her re-turn to Grand Slam tennis.
“I kind of started stumbling 
away. Things went in the wrong 
direction,” said Sharapova, who 
missed the U.S. Open and Aus-tralian Open. “I was just glad I could pick myself up and keep fighting.”
That she did: Five times, 
Petrova was one point away from serving for the match. But Sharapova didn’t allow her to 
convert those chances.
“She really showed, even 
though she has been out for a 
while, she’s willing to compete ‘til the end,” Petrova acknowl-edged.
Sharapova’s French Open 
continues, as does Rafael Na-dal’s winning streak at Roland Garros — which he extended to a tournament-record 30 matches — but there will be no more trips to the clay-court major for Marat Safin or Fabrice Santoro. 
Both are retiring at sea-
son’s end, and both bowed out Wednesday.
The big-hitting, loud-talking Safin succumbed after a 4½-hour, five-set bit of theater; the spin-mixing, gentlemanly Santoro played all of eight minutes to conclude his loss to Christophe Rochus in a match suspended the night before by darkness.
“My game style was out of 
date when I arrived on the tour. I got on the tour in the ‘90s, and my style dated back to the ‘70s,” said Santoro, who tied a French Open record by playing in his 20th French Open. “So when I ar-rived, I was, you know, 20 years 
late already.”
Safin was beaten by 134th-
ranked Josselin Ouanna of France 
7-6 (2), 7-6 (4), 4-6, 3-6, 10-8. He was done as dusk fell, around the time Venus Williams lost the first set of her match against Lu-cie Safarova. They were told to pack up, because there wasn’t 
enough light.
Winners included No. 3 Andy 
Murray, No. 7 Gilles Simon — 
who eliminated Robert Kendrick, making Andy Roddick the only U.S. man left — No. 8 Fernando Verdasco and Lleyton Hewitt, who faces Nadal next.
Safin’s younger sister, No. 
1-ranked Dinara Safina, won in straight sets, as did defending champion Ana Ivanovic and 16-year-old Michelle Larcher de Brito of Portugal, who upset No. 15 Zheng Jie of China. 
Sharapova had a much longer 
day’s work. But that’s OK with her. The Russian was so disap-
pointed to miss the U.S. Open 
and Olympics last year, she couldn’t bear to watch on TV. 
By the time the Australian 
Open came around in January, Sharapova found herself tuning in, then being inspired to head to the gym late at night.
“I know what I’m capable 
of out there. I know what I’ve done before. And I know I can do it again and even better,” said Sharapova, once ranked No. 1 and now 102nd.
There were moments Wednes-
day when Sharapova looked as if she’d never been away, pushing Petrova this way and that — par-
ticularly while winning the first 
set’s last five games. 
There also were moments 
when Sharapova appeared a step slow — particularly while losing the second set’s last five games. 
So Sharapova found her-
self playing her second straight three-setter, with rain falling and 
the temperature in the low 50s. 
Both women draped towels 
over their legs during change-
overs, and Petrova donned a jacket.
“She didn’t give me any 
chance,” said Petrova, twice a French Open semifinalist.THURSDAY, MAY 28, 2009 � ALLIGATOR, 27

TAMPA — A central Florida man arrested 
with thousands of anabolic steroid pills told 
investigators he sold to professional athletes, including players on the Washington Nationals and Capitals, authorities said Wednesday.
Richard Thomas boasted about selling ste-
roids to professional baseball, hockey and foot-ball players, saying, “You name the sport, and I’ve sold steroids to athletes who play it,” the Polk County Sheriff’s Office said.
Authorities said Thomas didn’t name spe-
cific players, and they have no evidence he sold to members of those teams.
Investigators who searched Thomas’ house 
in Lakeland on Tuesday recovered thousands of anabolic steroid pills, injectable liquids and syringes with an estimated wholesale value of $100,000, said Carrie Eleazer, a spokeswoman with the sheriff’s office. They also found sev-eral weapons, including loaded semiautomatic handguns.
Thomas and his wife, Sandra, were charged 
Tuesday with several counts of possession of illegal steroids, firearms, and maintaining a dwelling for drug use. 
Thomas and his wife were booked into 
the Polk County Jail on $215,000 each. San-dra Thomas posted bond and was released on Wednesday. 
Richard Thomas remained in jail and was 
expected to appear in court Thursday. Sheriff’s records did not list an attorney.Capitals players passed three rounds of drug 
tests during each of the past two seasons, and neither the team nor officials from the National Hockey League had reason to believe Thomas’s claims, the league and the team said in a joint release Wednesday.
A spokesman for Major League Baseball, 
which also randomly tests for steroids, said the organization is looking into the matter. Nation-als president Stan Kasten said he had been in touch with MLB and didn’t have any cause for concern.
“For now, the story is what it is,” he said in 
a conference call. “I don’t know anything more than that.”
Local authorities executed search warrants 
in Lakeland, about 30 miles east of Tampa, after receiving infor-mation from agents with the U.S. Immigration and Customs En-
forcement in Philadelphia.
Thomas told detectives he imported steroids 
from all around the world, including Iran, Paki-stan, Slovakia, Russia, China, Turkey, Spain, Mexico and Germany. The sheriff’s office said both Thomas and his wife were semiprofes-sional body builders, and that he claimed to be the largest steroids dealer in central Florida.
“He was very boastful,” Eleazer said.Thomas’ mother told detectives the suspect 
was introduced to steroids by his father. When asked about steroids, Thomas told investiga-tors, “It’s all I’ve ever known,” according to the sheriff’s office.Couple arrested in steroid bust
� AP POLL VOTES HAVE 
BEEN PUBLIC SINCE 1990.
THE ASSOCIATED PRESS
Beginning in 2010, ballots in the 
final regular-season USA Today 
coaches’ college football poll will be confidential — one of a handful of changes on tap for the poll that 
helps decide who plays in the BCS 
national championship game.
The American Football Coaches 
Association asked Gallup to study its poll and recommend how to make it more accurate and credible. 
The AFCA’s board heard the re-
sults in early May and announced them Wednesday in Waco, Texas.
“Gallup said, ‘Look, why do you 
think they have curtains and booths for voting?’” AFCA executive direc-tor Grant Teaff said. “They said it’s because you get the truest vote from an anonymous vote.”
Teaff said Gallup recommended 
that the organization go back to a policy from decades ago when the 
coaches themselves weren’t identi-
fied. But the changes stopped short of that.
“The coaches’ poll is just that, it’s 
the coaches’ poll,” said Monte Lo-rell, USA Today’s managing editor for sports. “They make determina-tions. Our job is to monitor it, make sure it maintains its integrity. “We’re pleased that the voting 
panel is public. We think that’s im-portant.”
The Associated Press has made 
all votes in its weekly media poll public since 1990. For the past three seasons, ballots have also been post-ed online. 
Other Gallup recommendations 
being considered for the future in-
clude reducing the number of teams 
ranked from 25 to 10 or 15, and eval-
uating the merit of a preseason poll.
Starting this 
year, the poll will also eliminate bo-nus voters given to some confer-
ences based on 
how their teams did the previous 
year.
The most radical change, how-
ever, will be the return to the policy in place before 2005, when coaches didn’t have to reveal their final bal-lots. Coaches will be allowed to re-lease their own ballots.
“When I was a voter, I liked ev-
ery coach putting it out there to see where it stands,” Mississippi coach Houston Nutt said. “I liked being ac-countable.”

Spurrier and Ron Zook took some heat last year when they ranked the

minute goal — his ninth in the Champions League this season — sealed the victory over the defending champions at the Stadio Olim-pico.
The triumph completed a sweep of titles 
for 38-year-old Barcelona coach Josep ‘Pep’ 
Guardiola in his first season, after wins in the 
Spanish league and cup. The former Barce-lona star, who started as a ball boy at Camp Nou, now joins five others who have won the title both as a player and a coach.
“When I won as a player I was young 
and it was magnificent,” Guardiola said of 
his 1992 triumph at Wembley against Samp-
doria. “But now winning the treble at the first attempt is marvelous.”
Guardiola became the youngest coach to 
win European soccer’s top club competition 
since the European Cup became the Cham-
pions League in 1993. Barcelona also won the trophy in 1992 and 2006.
United had been chasing its fourth Euro-
pean Cup title and fourth trophy this season after winning the Premier League, FIFA Club World Cup and League Cup.
But United was thoroughly outplayed by 
the Spanish side as Messi scored his 38th goal 
of an amazing year for Barcelona, which has 
153 league and cup goals this season.
Xavi floated a diagonal ball into the Unit-
ed area to find Messi unmarked, and the 5-foot-7 Argentina striker — renowned for his deft dribbling and shooting — used his 
head to loop the ball over United goalkeeper Edwin van der Sar and into the net.
Messi set off colorful celebrations at one 
end of the stadium, filled with 62,467 fans, 
and left English fans in silence.
The loss left Manchester United manager 
Alex Ferguson at 25 titles in 23 seasons. He failed to match Liverpool’s Bob Paisley’s three titles in the competition.
“We started the game brightly. We were 
confident and we could have been in front,” Ferguson said. “We had the ball but didn’t use it very well. ... We defended fantastically all season but they were two shoddy goals.
“We didn’t play as well as we can, but 
they are a good team. We have to give them 
credit. Xavi (Hernandez) and (Andres) Ini-
esta can keep the ball all night. They made it very difficult.”
South Korean winger Park Ji-Sung be-
came the first Asian to play in a Champions League final. 
He almost scored for United in the open-
ing minute but his shot was deflected wide after Cristiano Ronaldo’s free kick had been 
blocked by the goalkeeper. 
It was the closest United came to scoring 
all night.
The victory also marked the first Champi-
ons League title for Barcelona striker Thierry 
Henry, who was on the losing side when Ar-senal lost to Barcelona in 2006.
“Finally, I’ve been waiting for so long 
to get this title and now finally today,” said 
Henry, who had been doubtful for the final 
because of a knee injury. 
“The last five minutes were the longest of 
my life.”Barcelona downs United
“We started the game brightly. 
We were confident and we could 
have been in front.”

Despite being the top-ranked 
team in the country for the last 10 
weeks and sweeping their way through early postseason play, coach Tim Walton and his team are adopt-
ing the mentality of an underdog.
No. 1 UF (60-3) will continue its 
quest for the program’s first national 
title tonight at 9 against No. 9 Ari-
zona (46-15) in the first round of the Women’s College World Series in 
ASA Hall of Fame Stadium in Okla-
homa City.
The Wildcats are one of the most 
storied programs in college softball, 
having made it to the WCWS 21 out 
of the last 22 years. Arizona first baseman Sam Ban-
nister said her team was taking the role of underdog in stride despite its 
successful history and the fact that she would not have given the Wild-
cats that title in the first place.
Given the fact that anything can 
happen once the tournament starts 
— every team is now effectively 0-0 — Walton was quick to point 
out that his team’s successful season 
does not provide it with any discern-
ible advantage. 
“Facing Arizona in the first 
round, I’ll go with the opposite of 
what Sam said and say that we’re 
the underdog,” Walton said. “They 
have won more national champion-
ship games here than we ever have at this stage. Our kids are embracing 
that role, and we have to do a good 
job at staying focused and staying 
grounded.”
A team as consistently on top of 
the college softball world like Ari-
zona could negate the edge UF has 
in terms of its experience and famil-
iarity with the WCWS, both luxuries 
the Gators did not have last year.
“I feel like our team has a little 
bit more experience coming back for a second year,” catcher Kristina 
Hilberth said. “Obviously playing a 
team like Arizona, who has a lot of experience, in the first round, we’re going to have to battle it out.”
Ever since their loss to Texas 
A&M in the semifinals of last year’s WCWS, the Gators have been look-ing forward to the final tournament of the season. It’s no secret that UF 
set out to win a national champion-
ship after getting a taste of postsea-son success last season.
But after winning the NCAA 
Super Regional in Gainesville last weekend, Hilberth said the team still has the same mindset it has had all year: Every team will give the 
Gators its best shot, 
so they cannot look 
past anyone.
“We’re ready, but 
we’re just going to 
take it one game at a 
time,” Hilberth said. “We’re excited 
to get out to Oklahoma City, but you 
can’t win the whole thing until you win the first game.”
The competition between the 
two teams will be indicative of a 
larger conflict throughout this year’s 
WCWS. 
The Pacific-10 Conference, usual-
ly the powerhouse conference, and Southeastern Conference are repre-
sented by three teams each.
“I said a long time ago that 
when the SEC got serious about 
something, they were going to do it 
right,” Arizona coach Mike Candrea 
said. “I think really when the SEC 
got involved with women’s college softball, the parity kind of spread much quicker, kind of like what 
baseball experienced 20 years ago. 
So it wasn’t a surprise, it was just a 
matter of time.”

Senior pitcher Stacey Nelson received one of 
college softball’s most prestigious awards Tues-
day but fell short of earning another.
Nelson took home the Lowe’s Senior CLASS 
Award at the Party in the Park in Oklahoma 
City, the opening event for the Women’s Col-
lege World Series. The CLASS Award stands 
for Celebrating Loyalty and Achievement for Staying in School and focuses not only 
on the player’s athletic ac-complishments, but her work in the classroom and commu-nity as well.
No other UF athlete had 
ever won the award.
“Just to be considered was 
an honor, and to come out on top is something I never dreamed of,” Nelson said.
However, Nelson did not win the USA 
Softball National Collegiate Player of the Year Award, which went to Washington junior pitch-er Danielle Lawrie.  Lawrie, shut out the Gators 
in a nine-inning, 1-0 win on Feb. 20, handing 
Nelson, a top-three finalist for the award, and UF one of their three losses on the year.3, WOMEN’S COLLEGE WORLD SERIES PREVIEW, ALLIGATOR � THURSDAY, MAY 28, 2009

The top-seeded UF softball team will face ninth-seeded Arizona tonight in the Gators’ opening game of 
the Women’s College World Series. The Wildcats have made it to the WCWS 21 of the last 22 years. 
It appears this story deserves only 
one ending. The plot seems so ap-ropos.
That’s what scares me about the 
chances of the No. 1 UF softball team, which begins play today at the Wom-en’s College World Series.
A year ago, the Gators entered 
Oklahoma City as the top-seeded team, but they were making their first-ever appearance at the final dance. UF dropped its first game against Loui-siana-Lafayette, forcing the Gators to fight their way back through the los-ers’ bracket.
They almost succeeded but ended 
up a game short, falling 1-0 to Texas A&M in 9 innings. It was UF’s fourth game in two days.
Even though this was a 70-5 team, 
there was a feeling of just being hap-py to be there. After all, the Gators had been in unchartered territory throughout 2008. So while the season was a success, it left only one expecta-tion for 2009: win a national title.
UF lost just one starter from last 
year’s squad — right fielder Mary Ratliff, who coincidentally is also back for this run as the team’s student assistant coach.
Impressively, the team never shied 
away from its goal for the season. From day one, the Gators said only one thing would be an acceptable out-come for 2009, and that would include hoisting a trophy out in the Midwest.
It’s hard not to like this team for a 
multitude of reasons.  The storylines are simply end-less.
Stacey Nelson, 
who leads the na-tion with a 0.41 ERA, is one of the most domi-nant athletes on UF’s campus but refuses to get 
sucked up into the hype of athletics.
Hours before Sunday’s Super Re-
gional against California, where she would single-handedly lead her team to its second straight WCWS appear-ance, Nelson was beating her team-mates in Scrabble, according to coach Tim Walton.
She ranks No. 7 on the NCAA’s all-
time wins list but yet she keeps track of not a single record she owns.
“You don’t replace those kids,” Wal-
ton said. “This kid is one of the most special kids you’ll ever have a chance to coach. There isn’t a mean bone in her body but yet she still competes.”
And she is just one of a team full of 
storylines. How about left fielder Fran-cesca Enea who has tore her ACL twice but is still playing through it? What about Kelsey Bruder, the team’s only new starter from a year ago, who hap-pens to be hitting .385 and sits second on the team with 15 home runs?
But even though this team is 130-8 
during the last two seasons, the 8 loss-es tell much more about this team. 
The combined margin of defeat in 
those defeats? Nine runs.Five of them were 1-0 defeats. Not 
coincidentally, five of them also were in extra innings.
Two of this year’s losses came 
against teams (Washington, Alabama) that will be joining UF in Oklahoma City. The Huskies defeated the Gators 1-0 in Palm Springs, Calif. on Feb. 20. While that may seem like ages ago, the key fact is that UF couldn’t scratch out a run against Washington pitcher Dan-ielle Lawrie.
Lawrie won national player of the 
year honors Tuesday, edging out Nel-son.
If UF has any weakness, it has been 
timely hitting. Despite the Gators’ gaudy record for the second straight year, there is not overwhelming evi-dence that this fault has been cor-rected. If third-seeded Washington and UF match up in the champion-ship series, that may spell doom for the Gators.
With seven seniors graduating, 
there is no question that this is the window of opportunity for UF. While Walton is building a quality program in Gainesville, players like Stacey Nelson simply don’t come around ev-ery day. Next year will be comparable to the football team in the post-Tim Tebow era. Likely good but not quite the same.
Now it’s time to sit back and 
watch. The story will finish over the next week. 
The only question is whether it will 
have a happy ending or a sad one.
