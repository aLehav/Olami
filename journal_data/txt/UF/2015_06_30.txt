When Damian Gonzalez woke up to the 
news Friday that the Supreme Court had struck down bans on same-sex marriage, his ﬁ  rst re-action was to call his aunt. 
“My aunt, who is gay herself, never thought 
she would see it (happen) in her lifetime,” the 20-year-old political science and journalism se-nior said. 
The phone conversation was a special mo-
ment for both of them, he said, but the surprise ruling marks more of the beginning of a move-ment rather than the end. 
The LGBTQ+ community still faces more 
issues like homelessness and higher suicide rates, said Gonzalez, the co-president of Pride Student Union. “It’s kind of a realization that 
we still have a lot more to do.” 
Danaya Wright, a UF law professor who 
teaches constitutional law, said the Supreme 
Court could have chosen two paths to justify the decision under the Constitution. 
The ﬁ  rst option was to give those want-
ing to participate in same-sex marriage equal protection under the law, but the court instead decided to justify the decision by holding mar-riage as a fundamental right. 
“The court slightly opened the door for 
(equal protection), but did not go down that path,” Wright said. 
The next step is creating nondiscrimination laws in housing, education and employment, she said. 
“Marriage is one of those issues that’s one 
of the easier goals that could be achieved — it’s something that’s happy and shareable,” said Gabriella Larios, a 20-year-old women’s 
studies junior.
Larios said she didn’t expect the ruling 
would come so quickly. 
“It wasn’t even an issue that was in the pub-
lic conscience in the past ﬁ  ve years,” said Lar- Legalizing same-sex marriage is just the start
MONEY FOR IFAS AND NORMAN

If Bill Overholt doesn’t ﬁ  nd $900,000 by 
July 1, he’ll be out of a job.
Overholt is one of 12 people who works 
at the biological control research and con-tainment laboratory in Fort Pierce, a quar-antine facility associated with UF Institute 
of Food and Agricultural Sciences. Now, their jobs are in jeopardy.
Last Tuesday, Gov. Rick Scott released 
the 2015-2016 veto and budget list. Col-
leges and universities, along with other 
statewide and local programs across Flor-ida, saw budget cuts that totaled just more than $461 million.
UF IFAS saw $1.2 million in budget 
cuts. Of the $1.2 million, $900,000 is need-ed to keep the quarantine facility func-tioning, said Jack Payne, senior vice president for Agriculture and Natural Resources.
“It’s really sad because 
it does good work,” Payne said. 
The $3.9 million facil-
ity received funding to be built in 2002 and opened 
in 2004, he said. Every year since, the Fort Pierce facility has received $720,000 from the government to function.
The budget was increased by $180,000 
by legislators who supported the facility, which saves the state about $5 million a year, Payne said.
But without the state’s funding, the 
state-of-the-art facility will be an empty shell.

Up until today, consumers could only purchase 32- or 
128-ounce growlers, but on Wednesday, Florida will lift its 
ban on 64-ounce growlers, the half-gallon containers for beer typically ﬁ  lled at bars and breweries. 
Gainesville breweries are celebrating this victory for the 
craft beer world with several events. Here’s where you can get deals and specials:
 
 First Magnitude Brewery, 1220 SE Veitch St., will be hosting Sen. Rob Bradley and will be holding brewery tours each hour from 4 to 8 p.m. The brewery will also be allowing half-growler ﬁ  lls on some of the limited-release beers they have on tap.
 Swamp Head Brewery, 3650 SW 42nd Ave., is offering 50 
percent off the new 64-ounce growlers from 4 to 9 p.m.
 Tipple’s Brews, 2440 SW 76th St., Suite 110, will be car-
rying the new 64-ounce size growlers as well.
As of press time, Gainesville House of Beer, 19 W. Univer-
sity Ave., was still in the process of creating its programming for Wednesday.Subscription Rate: Full Year (All Semesters)  $100

THE WATER IS DRAINING 
INTO A DEPLETED 
FLORIDAN AQUIFER 
DURING DROUGHTS.
By Lawrence Chan
Alligator Staff Writer
lchan@alligator.org
North Central Florida’s biggest 
lake is vanishing down a sinkhole.
Stretched like a brown patch be-
tween Marion and Alachua county, 
Orange Lake, near Ocala, is famous 
for its bass ﬁ  shing and wetlands en-
vironment. But now, nature and hu-man inﬂ  uence have created a disqui-eting trend in Orange Lake, whose shores have spent decades draining down a sinkhole into a depleted Flor-idan aquifer during droughts.
“My bait and tackle shop has 
been closed,” said Robert Shidner, 
owner of South Shore Fish Camp on 
the lake.
Shidner, who’s owned his camp 
for the past 15 years, believes Or-ange Lake’s decreasing water levels are due to sinkholes located along the lake bottom. The sinkholes are directly connected to the Floridan aquifer, which is being continuously 
drained for human use.
While Orange Lake’s shores have 
historically shrunk during droughts 
and reﬁ  lled when rain is plentiful, the past quarter century have dem-onstrated extreme water-level drops well below historical trends.
Orange Lake is 12,550 acres in 
size and an average 5.5 feet deep, but the water level ﬂ  uctuates an av-
erage of two feet annually.
Data from the St. John’s Water 
Management District, the agency 
which oversees lake, river and stream management throughout northeast and east central Florida, demonstrates lake levels following rainfall patterns. 
However, in the past quarter cen-
tury, the lake’s water levels have dipped into extreme lows despite rainfall congruent with historic pat-terns.
According to the U.S. Geological 
Survey, when the aquifer’s supply is plentiful and rainfall steady, Orange Lake expands into its normal size, but when the aquifer drops below 
normal, water from Orange Lake 
drains into the aquifer to compen-sate, which lowers lake levels below their natural depth.
The U.S.Geological Survey report-
ed Floridians used about 134 gallons of water per day in 2010. Much of this is drawn from Florida’s aquifers, exasperating water-level problems 
on the lake.
Dan Canﬁ  eld, a professor of lim-
nology in UF’s Department of Fish-
eries and Aquatic Sciences, said he believes Orange Lake will eventu-ally become another Paynes Prairie unless more is done to maintain its water levels.
Ofﬁ  cials have tried to isolate and 
plug Orange Lake’s sinkholes with 
debris since 1964, but the problem 
has worsened due to the overall de-pletion of the aquifer.
In 2003, Marion County ofﬁ  cials 
proposed a way to plug the sinkhole in the lake, but authorities rejected the plan, saying it would interfere with the lake’s natural rhythms.
“Wide ﬂ  uctuations in water lev-
els are important for long-term main-tenance of healthy lake and wetland habitats for ﬁ  sh and wildlife,” said Teresa Monson, a public communi-cations coordinator for the St. Johns River Water Management District.
The lake recently recovered from 
a six-year drought, during which wa-ter levels dropped to the second low-est on record.
Depressed water levels have al-
lowed plant life to grow in dried-up areas of the lake usually covered by water. The foliage ﬂ  oats to the top of the lake and becomes ﬂ  oating is-lands of mud and vegetation, called tussocks, covering hundreds of acres on the lake’s surface.
These drifting rafts of vegetation, 
known as tussocks, are obstacles for 
local ﬁ  sh camps and boating compa-
nies. 
Tussocks prevent boats from tra-
versing Orange Lake due to a fear of clogging engine motors.“Some of them can be up to any-
where from three to 10 feet thick of muck,” Shidner said. “There is roughly 9,500 acres of ﬂ  oating tus-socks and islands on Orange Lake due to the years of drought we’ve had.”
The tussocks have compelled lo-
cal legislators to begin making pre-liminary plans to clean the surface of 
the lake by creating a lake manage-
ment group known as the Orange Creek Basin Interagency Working Group.
While their focus has been pri-
marily on discussing ways to clean the lake’s surface, the plan may only be a short-term solution to the lake’s long-term problems.

While studies have shown over the years 
that genetically modiﬁ  ed organisms are safe 
to consume, the public’s opinion on them is still skeptical. 
The increased debate over GMOs led Kevin 
Folta, the chairman of the horticultural sci-ences department at UF, and two doctoral students to Washington, D.C., on Thursday, where they met with the U.S. House Science 
Committee. 
Along with Folta, students Chris Barbey 
and Alejandra Guevara created a brief presen-
tation to start the meeting with the committee and then opened the ﬂ  oor to questions. The trio answered questions the members had about GMOs, the environment, product label-ing and product safety.
“Regardless of political leanings, I found 
the representatives and their aides to be ex-cited about learning more from someone who 
is not pushing an agenda,” Folta said.
Scientists are more valuable for informing 
government leaders to change their policy on GMOs because scientists do not have a po-
litical agenda like other groups or businesses, Folta said. In addition to the House Science Committee, the group also spoke to the ofﬁ  ces of Rep. Ted Yoho, Rep. Patrick Murphy, Sen. Marco Rubio and Sen. Bill Nelson.
The public perception is in an odd place, 
according to the scientists. Many people lack the prop-er knowledge about GMO science.
From studying genetic 
improvement of potatoes and strawberries to plant breeding sorghum, Barbey 
and Guevara have seen 
how GMO science opens  
doors for the world of agriculture, science and 
the environment. However, the confusion about this science has slowed down the ad-vancement of genetic technologies, with the most recent implementations still being from the late ‘90s, Barbey said.

Folta said, “we lose the opportunities that it 
could have.”UF scientists support

The UF concrete canoe team members 
messaged one another about their workouts 
every single day.
The messages kept one another motivated, 
said Tyler Mokris, the team’s construction and 
paddling captain. And their dedication paid 
off, as the team won the American Society of Civil Engineer’s national competition on June 
22 at Clemson University, beating 21 other 
schools and winning a $5,000 scholarship.
The team’s 22-foot-long canoe is made out 
of a mixture of concrete and tiny glass beads, which ensures that it won’t sink. Members competed in ﬁ  ve endurance races and were also judged on an oral presentation, a design paper and their canoe craftsmanship.
Over the course of the weekend, the team’s 
head captain, Danielle Kennedy, said mem-bers were working for 17 hours each day.
“It was a long day, every day,” the 22-year-
old said.
They spent about 3,000 hours, or 125 full 
days, preparing for their competitions, in-cluding the regional competition they won in March.
The team practiced almost every weekend, 
Mokris said, and while they were apart, they reported their workouts through GroupMe.
Kennedy said their advisers, Robert Thieke 
and Christopher Ferraro, joined them at Clem-son.
Thieke has advised the UF chapter for 23 
years, and Kennedy said he told the team he’d been waiting that long to see them win na-tionals.
Next year’s team captains have been cho-
sen, Mokris said, but he and Kennedy won’t be among them, as they graduated with de-grees in civil engineering in May.
“There were some tears when we got 
back,” he said.
Kennedy said she was conﬁ  dent the team 
would place in the top ﬁ  ve but didn’t expect to win the entire competition. 
“I never thought we were going to get ﬁ  rst 
place, even after they were saying ‘top ﬁ  ve,’ ‘top four,’ ‘top three,’ ‘top two,’” she said. “I still didn’t think we won.”
Mokris said he agrees.“We knew we worked really hard on it,” 
he said.  “And at one point I was thinking, ‘there can’t be schools that are working hard-er than we’re working.’”UF concrete canoe team wins

When Payne gave them a call Tuesday 
to let them know the item was vetoed, 
Overholt said it wasn’t what they expected.
“We were shocked,” Overholt said, 
who’s been at the facility since it opened 
in 2004. 
He’s spent ten years researching how to 
manage the Brazilian peppertree, an inva-
sive tree found in the Everglades.They found a beetle that feeds on the 
tree, but because the facility will no longer be funded, a future project may not hap-
pen.
Among the other items denied was the 
UF Norman Hall remodeling, which asked 
for $8 million to ﬁ  x the roof, restore the electrical and plumbing and renovate the Norman library among other things, ac-cording to a fact sheet prepared for legisla-tors.
Scott vetoed the item because there was no identiﬁ  able statewide impact, according to a prepared letter.
Scott approved $9.5 million for IFAS, 
and $5.5 million of it will restore 40 jobs lost in 2008 from the recession, Payne said.Of the $53.85 million for UF, $19.3 mil-
lion will go to performance funds, which will be used for salary increases. Another 
$5 million will go to preeminence funds, 
which will be used for hiring new faculty.
“We appreciate the Governor’s support 
of the Preeminence and Performance pro-grams,” Janine Sikes, UF spokeswoman, wrote in an email.
Overholt remains optimistic. Although 
he said he plans to retire soon, said he is hopeful the issue can be resolved. BUDGET,  from pg 1UF received $53.85 million in funding from the state budget
ios, who considers herself a member of the LGBTQ+ community. “Now it’s going to be the end of politicizing 
same-sex marriage. There’s going to 
be a new issue for politicians.” 
For the Florida Legislature, the 
ruling has brought up a swarm of is-sues it must now address.  Laws not recognizing same-sex 
marriage were declared void ab ini-tio, or never valid law, by the Su-preme Court, said Lee-Ford Tritt, di-rector of UF Law’s Center for Estate Planning. 
“This leaves Florida in a crazy 
situation,” he said, as the Florida 
Legislature must now decide how to 
look at these marriages, especially in areas of taxes and estates. They must decide whether mar-
riage beneﬁ  ts will take effect in a retrospective manner, accounting for all couples that were denied mar-riage rights in the past, or whether it takes effect proactively, by choosing a speciﬁ  c date the beneﬁ  ts can start to apply. 
“Regardless of the decision,” Tritt 
said, “we’re moving forward.”

Ansley Pentz and Rachel Lo / Alligator StaffWhen Gov. Rick Scott signed the Florida Compassionate Medical Canna-
bis Act of 2014 (SB 1030) into law last June, eligible patients thought they’d have access to medical marijuana by Jan. 1.  
After holdups with the Florida Department of Health, who was assigned 
to regulate the product, patients were told they’d need to wait longer for the medicine.  But at the end of May, Judge David Watkins cleared the way for moving forward with distributing applications to eligible nurseries that want to get medical marijuana licenses. 
Here’s what you should know:
Charlotte’s Web is 
low-THC, high-CBD can-nabis.  Nurseries aren’t limited to just Char-lotte’s Web, which is one of the more popular strains, but they have to produce a plant with a THC level of 0.8 percent or less and a CBD level of more than 10 percent.
THC is what gets you high, but this strain’s low THC won’t 
be concentrated enough to do so.
CBD is what makes medical marijuana medicine.  It can 
combat seizures, nausea and anxiety, among other ailments. 
People who are permanent Florida residents with cancer 
or a physical medical condition where they have chronic sei-zures (like epilepsy) or severe and persistent muscle spasms.
Smoking marijuana will still be illegal, even if you qualify 
for the medicine. 
As of now, 30 doctors have taken the eight-hour , $995 
course that allows them to administer the medicine. There 
are no Gainesville physicians who have taken the course. 
Most eligible physicians are in south and central Florida. Two 
doctors completed the course this month.What kind of marijuana is it?

ColumnBusy news week 
shows good, bad 
of United States
All right, we at the Independent Florida Alliga-
tor leave our posts for a week and the United States decides to up and blow its top with na-tional news and national controversies bub-bling over like some witch’s brew.
A racist guns down and kills nine Charleston 
churchgoers, including a U.S. senator. 
Consequently, the status of the Confederate flag is 
being unravelled throughout the U.S. as major retail-ers drop it from the market in the midst of a spurred initiative to take it down. 
Oh, and the Supreme Court rules 5-4 that same-sex 
marriages are a constitutionally guaranteed right.
So yeah. A lot of stuff happened, and the world 
doesn’t exactly run on the schedules of a few-dozen college journalists.
First off, it’s pretty old hat for Floridians that same-
sex marriage is fairly legal activity considering we tackled the matter about five months ago.
But when the Supreme Court decides to settle the 
question for all 50 states, that’s a fairly monumental deal. 
Like any other legal decision, it’s got its detractors, 
especially considering the choice was made with only a slight majority in the court, but a decision has been made and here’s to hoping that true love prevails.
Meanwhile, in a much foggier state of things, a lot 
of people want to take down the Confederate flag in outrage over the Charleston shootings. 
Not to mention normal outrage over its sometimes-
cited use as an emblem of slavery, racism and gener-ally disagreeable notions of Union traitorhood.
Where do we stand on the matter? Well... it’s true 
that the legacy and ideals of the Confederate flag aren’t always the most innocuous or pure, but is whitewashing a shameful part of American history re-ally an ideal we should strive for? 
Meanwhile, isn’t the controversy just kind of gloss-
ing over broader issues of contemporary discrimina-tion?
What’s the point of bringing down the flag if we 
don’t right the position of the flag pole? 
We’ll leave that to the typical discussions we get in

On June 26, the Supreme Court took a mas-
sive step forward toward equality, making 
marriage equality the law of the land. 
This ruling goes beyond just recognizing 
lesbian, gay, bissexual and transgender re-lationships, making all of the benefits that come with it available to married LGBTQ+ 
couples, whether it’s visiting your significant 
other in the hospital or being able to file taxes together. 
Though it’s easy to get swept up in the celebration, 
the issue of marriage equality is still far from resolved 
for most people, with Obergfell v. Hodges shaping up to 
be much like Roe v. Wade with it’s continued backlash and debate. 
Some believe that the court overstepped its author-
ity, even though the Supreme Court was founded to handle these sorts of disputes. 
The Supreme Court does not have the power to en-
force its rulings, which Mississippi and Alabama are taking advantage of as they decide to stop issuing mar-
riage licenses altogether. 
Republican presidential candidate Mike Huckabee 
invoked Martin Luther King Jr. to call for civil disobedi-
ence of the Supreme Court’s ruling. 
Even though this law would force Republicans to ac-
cept marriage equality, many are still committed to cre-ating a constitutional amendment defining marriage as one man and one woman, or insisting that this should have been decided on a state level. 
Those who insist that the courts are not the right 
way of achieving marriage equality are usually saying it as thinly veiled disregard for LGBTQ+ rights and as an acknowledgement that they thought marriage equality 
would likely not be passed nationwide for quite some 
time. I hoped that if the Supreme Court ruled 
for marriage equality, we could go on to talk about other LGBTQ+ issues, but because 
there isn’t widespread agreement on whether 
the ruling itself is legitimate, who knows how long it will take to discuss other forms of dis-crimination that LGBTQ+ people often face. 
While this ruling should be celebrated, it’s 
not the end of the need to fight for LGBTQ+ rights. 
Many laws that were created to combat discrimina-
tion do not protect sexual orientation or gender identity, 
such as the Fair Housing Act, making it possible to evict 
someone for being LGBTQ+. 
Marriage equality may be the law of the land, but 
antidiscrimination laws are not, allowing people to be fired or evicted for getting married. 
Transgender people are still not officially allowed to 
serve in the military. 
LGBTQ+ teens are still getting kicked out of their 
parents’ houses to live on the streets. 
Transgender people still face more violence than oth-
er groups. Celebrate this win, but recognize that there is still more work to be done.

“While this ruling should be 
celebrated, it’s not the end of 
the need to fight for LGBTQ+  
rights.”TUESDAY, JUNE 30, 2015   ALLIGATOR   7
I agree with the South Carolina governor’s 
position to take down the Confederate ﬂ  ag, as well as the decisions of Wal-Mart, Sears, eBay, the proposal in Mississippi and other such moves. 
The ﬂ  ag was a disgrace in 1861, it was a 
disgrace when it was raised to oppose civil 
rights, and it remains a disgrace today as the South looks to the future.
Yes, I understand the history. I have a de-
gree specializing in American history.
It is critical that we do not forget our past, 
but it’s possible to remember even the dark-est hours of our past without celebrating or honoring them.
I also understand the culture. Where I grew up, it was commonplace to 
see the Confederate ﬂ  ag displayed by private individuals, and I see that ﬂ  ag displayed in fraternity houses as well as in rural areas 
outside the city.
In grade school, I was taught — by per-
verse logic — that the Civil War was fought 
over “states’ rights” rather than states’ rights 
to own slaves. 
I like grits and ﬁ  shing, and I responsibly 
own three guns, two of which were passed 
down to me. I like taking things slow and strive to be gracious and hospitable to oth-
ers.
I believe many of the individuals who ﬂ  y 
this ﬂ  ag mean well. 
One of my favorite expressions I learned 
growing up was, “it is a poor frog who 
doesn’t praise his own pond.” However, many people view 
this ﬂ  ag, I think correctly, as a symbol of white supremacy. It 
does not, nor should it, represent 
what we love about the South.
To me, that ﬂ  ag represents 
elites turning generations of poor 
white folk against black folk. It 
represents treason; poor men and children sent to die so that South-ern elite could own other humans; hundreds of years of oppression that continued well 
after slavery; and politics of comforting poor 
whites so that they would at least be better off than black people economically and so-cially.
Do not misunderstand me: The fact this 
ﬂ  ag is being treated as what it is marks prog-ress, considering that until the 1990s the majority of Americans did not even support interracial marriage, and many of our grand-
parents were adults before basic Civil Rights 
measures were being truthfully upheld in the South — some of them no doubt went to seg-regated schools. 
Similarly, it was not long ago that the 
South used to be solidly Democrat until the passage of Civil Rights legislation led to the party realignment that empowered the charming conservative Republicans the 
South knows today.
However, realize that taking down that 
ﬂ  ag, while a ﬁ  ne symbolic gesture, is just 
that: a symbolic gesture. 
It does not put food on the tables of the poor, create good jobs, expand ac-cess to education or improve up-ward social mobility in any materi-
al way that promotes true equality 
of opportunity. It does not correct a culture of mindless violence and tend to the plague of mental ill-
ness, nor does it implement some 
of the less invasive, common-sense gun measures that the vast 
majority of the country supports. 
This ﬂ  ag issue is superﬁ  cial and easy in 
today’s world, which is why it is playing quite well with the politicians and corpora-tions. 
Do not be fooled into thinking these con-
cessions to the social liberals are much more than a way to put off the day that they have to address real issues that are hurting ordi-nary people. 
Southern Republican elected ofﬁ  cials 
seem to be bowing down to pressure and embracing potential presidential candidate Jeb Bush’s effort to present conservatism with a friendlier, more inclusive face. 
No doubt they believe taking down the 
safety net while giving more tax cuts to the rich is easier for Americans to swallow when done by happy non-racists. 
For them, this is a small price to pay.
Consider Wal-Mart, one of the ﬁ  rst major 
corporations to recently announce they will 
no longer be selling Confederate ﬂ  ag para-phernalia. 
The Walton family alone has more wealth than the bottom 30 percent of all Americans. 
It is a safe bet that the Waltons and the 
rest of the billionaire class are not eager to 
pay the price necessary to secure the bless-
ings of a more equal society. 
Then again, the fact these concessions 
are even being made is a sign that perhaps there are more cracks in the cement than we imagined.
The Confederate ﬂ  ags are coming down 
150 years too late. 
Take this as an encouraging sign that pos-
itive change that would have been unthink-able several years ago can suddenly come to 
fruition. 
But stay ever vigilant, for the major po-
litical battles that lie ahead run deeper than 
symbolism, and their effect will determine 
whether we have what it takes to make 
America the Land of Opportunity for every citizen, regardless of color or the size of his or her pocket book.

The loblolly pines in the Bat 
House Woods conservation area are 
surrounded by smaller trees, shrubs, critters and a growing army of sup-port.
UF originally planned to cut down 
nine of the mature pines to allow more light to ﬁ  lter onto the UF golf course’s seventh green, which bor-ders the trees’ home in the conserva-tion area. UF announced on June 11 it put the tree-removal process on hold, saying the almost-century-old trees would ﬁ  rst be evaluated for disease.
After Kim Tanzer and her hus-
band, Rod McGalliard, heard the news, they called three local tree ex-perts to determine the condition of the trees. The experts unanimously said the trees are healthy, according to written statements from arborists Meg Niederhofer and Erick Smith, and City of Gainesville Tree Advisory 
Board member Joe Durando.  
UF spokeswoman Janine Sikes 
wrote in an email that there is no up-
date on the status of the trees as of press time, and she does not have a timeline for when the university will evaluate them.
Smith, UF’s arborist until 2007, 
examined the trees and found no bac-terial or fungal infection nor signs of beetle infestation. Most fungal infec-tions are only present in very young pine trees, he said. Trees that huddle 
together, like the pines in the con-
servation area, fare better than those that stand alone, Smith said. In a group, the trees can shield and pro-
tect one another from wind. He said 
that while loblolly pines are common, trees of this maturity are not.
Durando said that “even if the 
trees were sick or dead or dying, they should remain standing,” because they are essential to the area’s ecol-ogy.
“It’s not about one tree,” he said. 
“It’s about how it all ﬁ  ts together.”
Tanzer said she and McGalliard 
care about the trees because they care about UF and conservation, not just because of their proximity to the pines. The couple live in Golfview, the community that neighbors the 
golf course and the UF bat houses. 
If they step outside their house and hop over the fence, they can see the trees, which tower over the rest of the woods.
Their dedication to keeping the 
trees is advertised on the “Friends of Bat House Woods at UF” Facebook page, which Tanzer said has likes 
from people all over the state and na-
tion.
“For UF to continue to do anything 
other than let (the trees) live would be extremely foolish,” Tanzer said.
Tree experts: UF golf course pines don’t need to be chopped
Gainesville Throwbacks
July 2, 1974: The publishers of three 
Florida newspapers said they would con-tribute a combined $225,000 toward a new building for UF’s College of Journal-ism and Communications. The school 
received $75,000 from the Sentinel-Star 
Company, which publishes the Orlando Sentinel-Star, and $150,000 from Gore Newspapers, which publishes the Fort Lauderdale News and the Sun-Sentinel. Journalism Dean John Paul Jones said construction would not begin until the school raised the $5.2 million it needed for the building.
July 3, 1986:  Theodore Bundy and 
Gerald Stano, both convicted murderers who were scheduled to die, received stays of execution. Bundy, who was convicted for the murders of Florida State University 
Chi Omega sorority sisters Margaret Bow-
man and Lisa Levy as well as 12-year-old Kimberly Diane Leach, had his stay of ex-ecution approved by a three-panel judge of the 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Atlanta about 16 hours before he was supposed to be put to death. Stano, who confessed to killing 41 people, had his execution postponed until Thursday by a Brevard County Circuit judge.
June 30, 1998: Adam Slipakoff, a 
25-year-old UF law graduate, dropped out of the race for Alachua County Commis-sioner. Slipakoff, a former Honor Court Chancellor who wanted to give students a voice in local government, backed out of the race after a defamation case involv-
ing UF Student Body President John Mc-
Govern resulted in students having little trust in SG. “Student Government is in no position to motivate anybody right now,” Slipakoff said. “We have to get Student Government straightened out before we move to the community.”

Harrison Bader signs with Cardinals
Former Florida outfielder Harrison Bader, selected with the 100th overall 
pick in the 2015 MLB Draft by St. Louis, has signed a contract to play for the Cardinals. THREE FRESHMEN HAVE 
ENROLLED AT UF IN 
SUMMER B. 
By Graham Hall
Alligator Staff Writer
@Graham311
 
With the departure of former 
Florida coach Billy Donovan, who 
built the Gators into a perennial 
contender in not just the South-eastern Conference but the entire country, one would think incom-
ing UF coach Mike White would 
attempt to emulate Donovan’s methods to be successful.
Not so fast, White says.“All of my mentors and people 
who I respect in the business have all given pretty similar advice, and that’s including Jeremy Foley and Billy Donovan” White said, 
“Just be yourself.”
Doing things his own way has 
gotten White this far, at least. 
It’s something he learned from 
a mentor, former Jacksonville State head coach Mike LaPlante, 
while working under the coach at the Alabama-based university.
“You know we’re all differ-
ent. There’s hundreds of different ways to do this,” White said. 
“Every coach has his own 
unique approaches and I have tons of respect and admiration for the last era, but I’m going to do 
what I know.”
Entering his fifth year as a 
head coach, White has developed 
his own methods for developing and running a basketball team.
But that doesn’t mean he won’t listen to those around the pro-gram who, for the time being at 
least, know more about success in 
Gainesville. 
“As we continue to learn from 
other coaches, especially coach Donovan and what has gone on 
here on and off the court as we’ve 
had the privilege to study games and practices, we’ll take a ton of that, trust me,” White said. 
“At the same time we’ll need to 
coach with our own personality.”
New Faces:  Monday marked the start of Summer B at UF, and among those to arrive on campus were the three incoming freshmen 
hoping to make an impact during 
White’s first season: KeVaughn Allen, Kevarrius Hayes and Keith Stone.
“We’ll get back to workouts 
today and continue to evaluate where we’re at, especially with regard to our three freshmen,” White said. 
“Coach Donovan and his staff 
obviously recruited them and signed them. So we just look for-ward to the fall where we can get 
into a full-swing of practices and 
learn more about our team.”
Along with the freshmen, the 
Gators will get contributions from three transfers and Brandone 
Francis, who sat out last season 
with academic issues. 
Redshirt sophomore John Eg-
bunu, who transferred from USF 
and sat out last season due to 
NCAA transfer rules, started 31 games for the Bulls as a freshman, earning a place on the American 
Athletic Conference All-Rookie 
team. 
Schuyler Rimmer announced 
on Dec. 30, 2014 that he would walk-on at Florida from Stanford 
after initially committing to Dono-
van and the Gators in 2013. 
He won’t be eligible until after 
the fall semester, due to the same 
NCAA transfer rules that kept 
Alex Murphy from the court until late December.
The final addition comes from 
JUCO transfer Justin Leon, who 
originally signed for White at Lou-
isiana Tech. 
He’s eligible to play immedi-
ately, but won’t be on campus un-
til the Fall. 
Leon may hold a special place 
in the mind and heart of White, 
as he’s the first official UF com-mit for the 38-year-old Dunedin 
native.
For White, he's eager to find 
out who will be his first Gators. 
The uncertainty is invigorat-
ing, the potential to develop is en-
thralling and the drive to find out is energizing for White.
“Evaluating them in terms of 
their strengths and weaknesses, 
and the best ways to help this pro-
gram, will be first and foremost,” White said. “I’m just excited to watch them.
“This first week or so will be 
more of sitting back. Obviously pushing them to work very, very hard and pay attention to detail. 
"But more than anything eval-
uating exactly who they are as players.”Mike White, Florida excited to establish new identity

When examining Florida baseball’s 
2015 season, the best place to begin is at 
the end.
The Gators went 3-2 in the College 
World Series and nearly made it to the fi-nals, but lost by one run in the semifinals to Virginia, who downed Vanderbilt in a CWS finals rematch.
But over the course of the CWS, UF set 
records.
First baseman Peter Alonso hit the two 
longest home runs in the history of the CWS at TD Ameritrade Park, both over 400 
feet to center field. Florida hit four home runs in a 10-2 
drubbing of Miami in the third round of the CWS — more than were hit in either of 
the last two CWS by all teams combined. 
Over the course of the NCAA Tourna-
ment, Florida outscored its opponents 92-
28.
“There were a lot of positive things, but 
there was only gonna be one team standing 
at the end of the year and that’s the cham-pion,” coach Kevin O’Sullivan said after 
Florida’s 5-4 loss to Virginia on June 20. 
“I’m not gonna lie to you, I felt like if 
we had a chance to play in the champion-
ship round I liked our chances.”
But the Gators never got that chance. 
UF finished third in the Southeastern 
Conference in batting average (.298) and fourth in ERA (3.18). 
They were one of four SEC teams to fin-
ish with 50 or more wins.
Near the beginning of the season, when 
UF struggled with consis-
tency, that outcome may 
have sounded like a best-
case scenario.
On March 20, after los-
ing back-to-back games 
against Ole Miss in UF’s 
first road series of the 
season, the Gators fell to 
fourth place in the SEC East division. 
They went 5-4 over their next nine 
games, but with the mid-season emergence 
of JJ Schwarz against Stetson on April 7, 
Florida found its groove.The Gators finished their remaining 
28 games with a 20-8 record, and after 
dropping the SEC Tournament opener to 
Arkansas, UF rattled off four consecutive victories to claim the SEC Tournament Championship.
During the postseason, the accolades 
began to pile up: Schwarz was named both the SEC Tournament and Most Outstanding Player in the Gainesville Regional. 
He would finish the season as a first-
team freshman All-American by D1Base-ball and the National Freshman Hitter of the Year by the National Collegiate Base-ball Writers Association.

junior left-fielder Harrison Bader were also Season in review: Looking back at Florida baseball in 2015

Seven different players were selected in the draft, 
including shortstop Richie Martin, taken 20th over-
all by the Oakland Athletics, and Bader, taken 100th 
overall by the St. Louis Cardinals.
“It was like yesterday that I was a freshman. It 
ﬂ  ies by,” Bader said following Florida’s 5-4 ousting to 
Virginia in the CWS. “But I’ve enjoyed every second 
of it.” 
But while Florida’s season is over, some of its 
players are still competing.
Seventeen current players are playing in sum-
mer leagues, including Alonso, Ryan Larson, Jeremy Vasquez, and four pitchers: Shaun Anderson, Dane Dunning, Logan Browning and Scott Moss.
In addition, returning pitchers Logan Shore and 
A.J. Puk, outﬁ  elder Buddy Reed and Schwarz were selected to join the USA Baseball Collegiate National team this summer.
Reed went 7-14 with four runs and ﬁ  ve RBIs in 
four games while Schwarz hit 2-14 in ﬁ  ve games.
Shore earned the win for the USA in its ﬁ  rst of a 
three-game series against Chinese Taipei, a 6-4 vic-tory on Saturday, pitching four scoreless innings and striking out ﬁ  ve batters.
“These guys are resilient and we got a great club 
coming back,” O’Sullivan said. 
“Obviously I’m really proud of the seniors and ju-
niors that will be moving on but we got an awfully good bunch coming back. We’re looking forward to 
hopefully getting back to (the CWS) next year.”BASEBALL,  from pg 1317 current players are competing in summer league baseball

Florida's Harrison Bader (8) celebrates with teammates following the Gators' 10-2 victory against Miami in the College 
World Series on June 17 at TD Ameritrade Park in Omaha, Nebraska. 
Alex Rodriguez’s baseball ac-
complishments shouldn’t be celebrated.
Instead, he should be 
shunned and baseball 
should be ashamed to see him reach another undeserved milestone.
Rodriguez joined rariﬁ  ed air on 
June 19 when he hit his 3,000th ca-reer hit, a home run off Detroit Ti-gers pitcher Justin Verlander.
Rodriguez received a standing ovation from 
the home Yankee Stadium crowd.
Shame on you, Yankees fans.
And this is coming from a person who is a 
fan of the Yankees.
Rodriguez, who has repeatedly lied about 
his past steroid use, cast a dark cloud over the 
game and on his team.
Yes, people will say that I’m beating a 
dead horse, and that people deserve second chances, and I agree to a certain extent. But Rodriguez already had his second chance after 
admitting that he used steroids when he was 
with the Texas Rangers from 2001-03.
Rodriguez said he used performance en-
hancing drugs because of the pressure of try-ing to live up to an astronomical $256 million contract.
He seemingly bounced back from that and 
led the Yankees to a World Series title in 2009.
But  injuries and age caught up to the third baseman. 
After struggling to regain his 
form, Rodriguez was caught up in the Biogenesis scandal and was suspended by former MLB com-missioner Bud Selig a record 211 
games.
Eventually his suspension was 
reduced to a single season, 162 
games, but the damage to his repu-tation had been done.
He came into this season within striking 
distance of a number of baseball records and accomplishments including the 3,000 hit club which has members on it that are held in the 
highest esteem in baseball circles.
Players like Roberto Clemente, Tony 
Gwynn, Cal Ripken Jr. and Derek Jeter among 
others.    
With his hit in the third inning on Monday 
night, Rodriguez is tied for 26th on the all-time hits list with 3,011 hits and inching closer to another disgraced baseball player and steroid user: Rafael Palmeiro, who ended his career 
with 3,020 hits.
Rodriguez is a liar. 
Plain and simple. And some will even compare him to Pete 
Rose, who has been banned for life for betting on baseball.
I wouldn’t say he’s the same as Rose, but 
Rodriguez isn’t that far behind him. Rodriguez should cherish what he has left of his career, because once it’s over, I think the majority of people won’t remember him as one of the most talented players to ever play the game.He’ll be remembered for the damage he did 
to the game of baseball and how big of a dis-grace he was to America’s pastime.TUESDAY, JUNE 30, 2015   ALLIGATOR   15

TRACK AND FIELD
By Kyle Brutman
Alligator Writer
@KBrut13
 
Florida track and ﬁ  eld has made 
its mark in recent years in the tri-
ple jump circuit.
This past weekend was no dif-
ferent.
At the USA Track and Field Out-
door Championships in Eugene, Oregon, the Gators were represent-ed in each of the top three spots in the men’s triple jump.
Although the competition 
changed from the best collegiate athletes to the best American ath-letes in the span of a little less than 
two weeks, jumper Marquis Dendy 
had no problem ﬁ  nding success at the event.
At the same venue where he 
became Florida’s all-time triple jump leader at the NCAA Outdoor Championships, Dendy ﬁ  nished in third place with a 17.23-meter jump.
The result trailed only that of 
former Gators Omar Craddock (17.53m) and Will Claye (17.48).
But Dendy’s highlight of the 
weekend took place on the takeoff board of another event — the long jump.
Dendy, now a sponsored Nike athlete, won the event with the 
longest all-conditions jump of 
both his career and in the world at 8.68 meters — one quarter-of-
a-meter better than his national outdoor title-clinching perfor-mance he put on at the NCAA out-
doors earlier this 
month.
The victory 
also earned 
Dendy the right to represent the 
United States in the event at Au-gust’s World Championships, tak-ing place in Beijing, China.Fifteen Gators from this year’s 
men’s and women’s squad com-peted this weekend, and — aside from Dendy — the athlete that made the most noise was rising-freshman jumper KeAndre Bates.
Bates rose to the occasion in 
the men’s long jump junior ﬁ  nals, clinching a victory with a wind-aided 7.91-meter leap — giving 
Florida the men’s long jump sweep 
for the weekend.
Bates ended his weekend with a 
ﬁ  fth-place ﬁ  nish in the men’s triple jump.
Florida’s 15 athletes combined 
for nine top-ﬁ  ve ﬁ  nishes over the course of the meet. Rising-fresh-man Lloydricia Cameron placed 
runner-up in the women’s discus 
junior ﬁ  nals with a 52.01-meter throw, giving herself a personal best as well as landing her a spot on the top-10 all-time list at UF.
The Gators excelled in both the 
men’s and women’s 200-meter se-nior events in Eugene, led by Ded-ric Dukes and Kyra Jefferson.
Each emerged from a ﬁ  eld of at 
least 25 athletes en route to top-six ﬁ  nishes in the ﬁ  nal race. 
Dukes ﬁ  nished ﬁ  fth with a 
20.15-second time, while Jeffer-son ﬁ  nished sixth-overall and third among college athletes with a time of 22.56 seconds.
