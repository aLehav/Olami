� THE HOUSE KILLED A SIMILAR BILL.
HANNA MARCUS
Alligator Staff Writer hmarcus@alligator.org
Big beer bills are continuing to bluster their 
way through state government, leaving local 
breweries, brewpubs and craft beer drinkers still clouded with disappointment.
Although efforts to permit the 64-ounce 
growler were presented in a bill in the House of Representatives previously, the legislation was peppered with unclear language and stipulations that left state breweries severely limited.
The House bill has been squashed for now, but a new bill in the Senate, SB 1714, is present-ing the brew community with similar regula-tions and issues.
The bill allows the sale of half-gallon growl-
ers, but numerous limitations on distribution practices are written into the legislation.
For example, the bill mandates breweries 
sell bottles and cans to distributors. To sell to their own customers, they must buy the stock  back. Most of the time, this includes a signiﬁ  -cant markup in price.
It also prevents brewers from opening win-eries or cideries.
Barron Humphries, owner of Hoggetowne 
Ale Works, said the bill is written this way because some legislators want to ensure the three-tier system stands strong, despite most breweries thinking the system is outdated.
“If you have 10 different breweries in a 
room together talking, they’re all going to say the system is garbage,” he said. “(This bill) means more regulation and more loopholes to jump through.”Senate bill could mark up costs for local craft breweries LIFESTYLE

Tax Day has come and gone. 
But for students who forgot to ap-
ply for a refund, there’s still time.
The same can’t be said for indi-
viduals who owe the IRS money.
UF accounting professor Gary 
McGill said the deadline to ﬁ  le tax returns is strict.
“If you missed the deadline, 
then you’re going to be subject to certain penalties or interests on any unpaid tax liabilities,” he said.
However, McGill said those ap-
plying for tax refunds won’t face any serious problems by missing the deadline.
“The penalty and interest is 
based on what you owe the IRS,” he said. “If they owe you via re-fund, then the base for the penalty is obviously zero.”
McGill said it’s easy to get an 
extension to ﬁ  le a tax return after the deadline. However, he said an extension is simply a way to delay completing the paperwork.
“It does not give you an exten-
sion of time to pay any tax that’s due,” McGill said. “What you’re supposed to do is estimate what your tax liability will be.”
Filers should pay their calcu-
lated tax liability, the estimated amount owed, when they apply for an extension.

The Wednesday release of The New York Times’ story 
about a ﬂ  awed investigation into Florida State University quar-
terback Jameis Winston’s rape allegations is reverberating in Gainesville.
The story asserted the Tallahassee Police 
Department did not follow through in in-vestigating January rape accusations from a female FSU freshman involving the Heis-man Trophy winner. It cited late reports, destroyed video evidence, uncollected DNA and a delayed interview with Winston. The prosecutor said he didn’t have enough evi-
dence to charge Winston, The Times report-ed.
Gainesville Police spokesman Ofﬁ  cer Ben Tobias would not 
comment on the way Tallahassee Police handled the situation. But he said Gainesville has good resources and detailed policies to deal with sexual assault incidents locally. 
Even if a victim doesn’t want to ﬁ  le a formal report, he said, 
GPD offers a conﬁ  dential way to report information through reportrapegainesville.org. Tobias said victims may choose to report information that the department will keep on ﬁ  le in case the victim decides to pursue charges later.
“These victims do deserve justice, and we’re here to help 
them get it,” he said.
According to GPD’s ofﬁ  cial policy for handling sexual as-
sault, “It is the policy of the Gainesville Police Department to thoroughly investigate crimes involving sexual violence ... members’ responses shall not vary on the basis of the charac-teristics, status or profession of, or the nature of the relationship between, the victim and perpetrator.”
If a victim calls to report a sexual assault, the policy indi-
cates the caller will be encouraged to remain calm and to not change clothes, eat or drink, comb hair or disturb anything at the scene. 
Dispatchers are instructed to not allow “any victim’s sus-
pected substance use or impairment to affect the decision to dispatch an ofﬁ  cer,” according to the policy. They are also not allowed to honor any requests to cancel law enforcement dis-patch in response to a sexual assault allegation.
Aside from the way the legal proceedings were handled, FSU assault case
inspires dialogue

UF’s Institute of Food and Agri-
cultural Sciences is celebrating its 
100th anniversary of Florida Exten-sion with guest speakers, free food and a ceremonial cake cutting.
The event will take place today 
on the Plaza of the Americas from 11 a.m. to 2 p.m.
The extension, established by the 
Smith-Lever Act of 1914, has allowed researchers at UF and Florida A&M University to convert their research into usable knowledge to share with millions of Floridians over the past 
100 years, according to the 100th An-
niversary of Florida Extension blog.
Nick Place, dean and director for 
IFAS Extension, said the event is sig-niﬁ  cant for his department because it offers the opportunity to educate the university community on the out-reach mission of the extension.
Place emphasized that the event 
not only celebrates past successes, but it also offers a chance to celebrate what is to come in the future of exten-sion and outreach.
“We have had great success for 
the last 100 years, but really what we want to be focusing on is what we need to be doing for the next 100 years to address some of these big is-
sues we face in this state,” he said.
Candace O’Neill, a 20-year-old UF 
dietetics junior, said she heard about 
the IFAS extension program through guest presenters in her community nutrition classes.
“From what I have learned, I think 
Extension does a great job at ben-eﬁ  tting Floridian citizens by bring-
ing things to the community level to 
people that need it most,” she said.IFAS celebrates 100 yearsKATHERINE BROWN

An undergraduate-run psychology re-
search laboratory at UF is using crowd-
funding to raise money for its studies.
The Life Satisfaction and Excellence 
Lab is currently trying to raise $3,000 on 
GoFundMe.com, a crowdfunding website. 
The money will help pay off the lab’s 
debts.
It will also pay for a website it uses to 
track its research progress and pay people 
for taking surveys.
The lab has trouble raising money through grants because it’s completely run by undergraduate psychology students, said Tiffany Dawson, a research assistant 
in the lab.
Dawson, a 21-year-old UF psychology 
senior, said the lab doesn’t get attention 
from organizations with grant money.
He said that is because graduate and 
doctoral programs receive the money in-stead.
The crowdfunded money will go toward 
two programs the lab currently uses. 
One, Excellence University, is a website 
the lab uses to track progress toward goals for its research.“Everyone in the lab has an account in 
Excellence University,” said Megan Turn-er, a 21-year-old UF psychology junior 
who works in the lab. “It’s really helpful 
for you to make sure you do complete 
your goals.”
The other program is Amazon Mechan-
ical Turk, often called MTurk, which sends out the lab’s surveys to a wide range of 
people to improve survey results. 
The survey participants get paid for 
each one they take.
“It gives us a different sampling base,” 
said Turner, the fundraising chair for the crowdfunding project. With MTurk, the 
lab can send its surveys to a much larger 
population.
“It’s more generalizable as opposed to 
so focused on the UF student population,” 
Turner said.  
Approximately $2,000 from the cam-
paign will help pay off current debts, she 
said. 
The other $1,000 will go toward future 
studies. Psychology lab starts GoFundMe campaign to buy programs

“It’s more generalizable as

student population.”
Megan Turner
UF psychology juniorJoshua Aubuchon, a law-
yer and lobbyist for the Flor-
ida Brewers Guild, summa-rized the bill’s regulations as “punitive.”
He said if breweries want 
to sell their beer and then have to buy it back from distributors, not only is the mark-up price a factor, but also, distributors don’t nec-essarily have to do anything with the beer.
In other words, they just 
pocket the extra money.
“(Distributors) would 
make more money without having to do a thing,” Aubu-chon said. “Under current law, Swamp Head (and other local breweries) doesn’t need to sell bottles to distributors. Why would that be in the bill other than to be punitive?”
He said another issue with 
the bill is unclear language that would make anything not specifically authorized in the legislation prohibited, which could stifle creativity.
At the local level, Neal 
Mackowiak, a brewer for Tall Paul’s Brew House, said he is unhappy about the bill be-cause the brewpub had plans to expand into a brewery in the future.
“Ultimately, the idea was 
to become a brewery … simi-
lar to Swamp Head,” he said. 
“When we were told of what this Senate bill was, we real-ized it was a hugely limiting factor for us.”
Mackowiak said he dis-
likes that beer doesn’t need to switch hands for the distribu-tors to make extra money.
“We basically just write a 
check to the distributor to sell our beer,” he said. “It almost seems like mob-like tactics — that you need the security of (distributors) to be able to run your business.” Bill could stifle 
creativity, expansion4, ALLIGATOR � THURSDAY, APRIL 17, 2014

Gainesville Police arrested a local 
man Tuesday night for threatening a 
group of people with a gun and hiding marijuana in his underwear. 
Officers arrested 22-year-old Tarris 
Cox on charges of aggravated assault, possession of a concealed weapon and possession of marijuana with intent to sell within 1,000 feet of a public place, according to an arrest report. Cox’s friend Travon Stophon Graham was arrested on battery charges. 
At about 10 p.m., Graham, 20, got 
in a fight with another man in the 1900 
block of Southeast Fourth Street. He 
punched the man’s girlfriend while she was trying to break up the fight, ac-cording to the report.After the fight, Cox arrived in a 
pickup truck with a group of men and approached the house. He lifted his sweatshirt to show a silver handgun tucked in his waistband. 
According to the report, Cox then 
said, “I got that fire! … I ain’t gonna let anyone run up on my boys … I’ll shoot you!” 
Cox and Graham went to a nearby 
apartment, where they were later con-fronted by police. During the investiga-tion, Cox consented to a search, and the officer felt an “unfamiliar bulge” near Cox’s crotch, according to the report. 
The officer pulled two bags of mari-
juana from Cox’s underwear. Accord-ing to the report, the bags, containing a total of 19.6 grams, were individually 
packed for sale.
Officers booked Cox and Graham 
into the jail. Graham was released after 
meeting bond, and Cox remained. Another local arrested

Rep. Ted Yoho sat down with 
UF students Wednesday to dis-
cuss a program that offers college opportunities to low-income and first-generation students.
Six student representatives 
from the Ronald E. McNair Post-baccalaureate Achievement Pro-gram joined Yoho.
The program guides 25 stu-
dents from under-represented backgrounds in their pursuit of a Ph.D.
The six McNair Scholars ex-
pressed appreciation toward the program and urged Yoho to sup-
port it. The program is federally funded through 
the Higher Edu-
cation Act, which is up for renewal in the U.S. House of Representa-
tives this year.
Program Di-
rector Samesha 
Barnes said she 
looks for students who are passion-ate about their education but need support to achieve their goals.
She said she is trained to “look for diamonds in the rough” to en-gage in the intensive research pro-gram and provide students with mentorship and academic oppor-tunities.
Yoho said hearing students’ di-
rect experiences helps him guide federal funding. Meeting students lets him see how current programs can serve as solutions for the fu-ture.
Jose Castaneda, a 21-year-old 
UF political science and economics junior and a McNair Scholar, said the program gives students “an edge.”
“It opens up a new world that 
you have never had the chance to see,” he said.
Yoho said he resonates with 
economically disadvantaged stu-dents because he was once in their position.
“I’m one of six brothers … No-
body in our family went to col-lege,” he said. “I know exactly where (they’re) coming from.”

Beer , from page 1City police, university are separate entities
first-year UF law student Josh Gehres said something 
doesn’t seem right. Gehres, a former FSU football play-er, was teammates with Winston for a year and said the allegations seem out of context with what he knew of Winston.
“He’s a guy with great character,” Gehres said. “He 
was a high-class kind of guy.”
In response to The Times’ story, FSU posted an open 
letter online. Part of it read: “FSU does not tolerate sex-ual assault. Even one sexual assault is a problem. Like other colleges and universities that are grappling with this issue, we actively provide programs and educate students on safe behavior, the meaning of consent and how to properly report cases of sexual misconduct.”
Sarah Timoti, a 20-year-old FSU humanities and 
media production sophomore, said the city police de-
partment and the university should be looked at as sep-
arate entities. She said the university did all it could.
“I do think that the Tallahassee Police Department 
could have handled it better, and they admitted that,” she said. “Students were outraged, not just because it was Jameis Winston but because of the way the case was handled.”fsu , from page 1
Students may be considered dependents
pay the correct amount, even af-
ter filing an extension, they will be charged interest and penalties for late payment.
Stephen Bolden, a 21-year-old 
UF finance junior and part-time student assistant for the Heav-ener School of Business, recently learned he is not required to pay taxes.
“Apparently, if you don’t 
work a certain number of hours per week and you’re a full-time student that makes below the minimum amount ... then you don’t get taxed,” he said.
Students under the age of 24 
are considered dependents and are not required to file tax returns if they make less than $6,100 a year. 
If students don’t meet depen-
dency requirements, they must file returns if their annual income is more than $10,000.
Bolden said not paying taxes 
on time would probably be worse for someone with a lot at stake because the government can do things such as foreclose on homes and repossess cars to collect any money owed.
“I don’t think that would ever 
happen to me if I didn’t pay my taxes,” he said. “I don’t really have anything to lose.”

Despite years of warnings, overwhelming evidence 
and changing climate patterns, most of humanity sits idly as our planet continues to warm.
From 2000 to 2010, carbon emissions grew more rapidly 
than in each of the previous three decades, according to a 
new report from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate 
Change.
That means there’s a lot of work to be done. The IPCC operates under the United Nations to assess 
the scientiﬁ  c basis of climate change for policymakers.  Ac-cording to a news release about this latest report, the IPCC evaluated about 1,200 scenarios from scientiﬁ  c literature to see how efforts to combat climate change have been far-ing. 
If nothing changes, temperatures will rise between 3 
and 5 degrees Celsius. That could spell disaster for climate patterns and agricultural yield, meaning worse weather and less food for an ever-growing world population. 
The international goal is to keep global warming within 
2 degrees, but doing that requires “major institutional and technological change” to even come close to meeting that goal, according to an IPCC news release. 
The world must reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 
40 to 70 percent by 2050 and be near zero by the end of the century to be on target. 
One common method of curbing emissions in the sce-
narios modeled by the IPCC is to bring emissions relating to electricity to near zero. That means no more dirty fossil-fueled power plants. Although that may seem impossible, solar power can now compete without subsidy in Germa-ny, Italy and Spain. It’s not as crazy as the talking heads would have you expect. 
Even though the IPCC report released in September 
2013 stated there was 95 percent certainty that humans were the cause of climate change, the U.S. is on track for projects like the Keystone XL Pipeline. That project would move the tar sands, crude oil mixed with clay and dirt, from the Canadian border to an existing pipeline in Ne-braska. 
Of course, supporters say it helps with jobs and energy independence. But they overlook the potential for environmental disaster, which are all too com-monplace. Don’t forget about the chemical spill in West Virginia 
earlier this year related to the 
coal industry. And energy inde-pendence? Companies like Exxon market themselves as “green” by touting natural gas, but they fail 
to mention that it still produces carbon. That’s not even go-ing into the other environmental concerns that come with fracking, such as earthquakes and ﬂ  ammable tap water.  
Don’t expect an answer from the top, especially in the 
U.S. It’s unfortunate, but the oil and gas industry is one of the top lobbying powers in Washington, giving politicians more than $144 million in 2013 alone. 
In the meantime, the government “raises awareness” 
about how citizens can help conserve.  Let’s be honest with ourselves: Remembering to turn out the lights when you leave a room isn’t going to decrease the world’s carbon emissions enough. 
The government needs to get its priorities in order and 
start representing the interests of the people and resist cor-porate donations. Instead of focusing on short-term prof-its, which capitalism forces society to do, society must turn to what will happen in the long run. 
That’s the one drawback of ditching fossil fuels and 
switching to renewable energy — production loss. Accord-ing to the IPCC report, consumption will grow by 1.6 to 3 percent per year if nothing changes. Aggressive attempts to combat climate change would only slow that growth by 
0.06 percent per year. 
That leaves us in a pickle. Either slow global consump-
tion by less than one-tenth of 1 percent or essentially lose 
the world we know. 
Until it gets sorted out, I’ll be lying on the ground with 
all the lights off to do my part to conserve.

mishandled 
Winston case
The New York Times investigation published Wednesday reopened the discussion of the sexual assault allegations ﬁ  led against Florida State University football’s crown jew-
el, Jameis Winston.
The writer, Walt Bogdanich, compiled an extensive timeline 
that answered many questions on what exactly went wrong.
“Records show that Florida State’s athletic department knew 
about the rape accusation early on, in January 2013, when the assistant athletic director called the police to inquire about the case,” Bogdanich wrote. “Even so, the university did nothing about it, allowing Mr. Winston to play the full season without having to answer any questions.”
The takeaway from the Winston case — and all the media 
hype surrounding it and The Times investigation — is that Tal-
lahassee Police and FSU simply did nothing. They didn’t follow 
up with the three strong leads the victim provided. They waited nearly a year to interview a key witness who had admitted to videotaping the alleged assault. And the kicker: Ofﬁ  cer Scott An-gulo, the police investigator who handled the case, previously did private security work for the Seminole Boosters, a nonproﬁ  t organization with nearly $150 million in assets and the primary ﬁ  nancier of Florida State athletics.
FSU released a statement following the article’s publication 
asserting that The Times piece was misleading. Certainly, no one is accusing the university of not taking sexual assault seriously or not providing resources for victims. However, in this case, both TPD and the university failed to take action when present-ed with evidence of a sexual assault, and it appears an attempt to protect a star football player is the culprit.
Campus rape is already a problem; President Barack Obama 
created a task force to combat it, after all. Rabid football culture is also a problem — see Steubenville, Penn State and the fact that 
one in three college sexual assaults are committed by athletes, 
according to a study by the National Coalition Against Violent Athletes. The two issues are fundamentally intertwined.
TPD and FSU’s mishandling is much more than an abstract, 
academic argument that rape culture exists. It’s the result of the protection of special interests — the university’s image, univer-sity athletics and one prominent football player — at the expense of women against whom heinous crimes have been committed.  
As students, we hope the university to which we devote 
our loyalty and — let’s be honest — thousands of dollars annu-ally would stand with us during these times of personal trag-edy. FSU has demonstrated that, despite its vague claims that it “does not tolerate” sexual assault, they prioritize athletes over non-athletes. We hope, in light of this prominent Times inves-tigation, FSU will be held more accountable when it comes to investigating sexual assault and rape claims, and TPD will have a major overhaul.
Beyond FSU, we hope more schools — including UF — will 
give immediate and thorough attention to sexual assault and rape reports as they happen. Only then can the cycle of victim 
blaming and preferential treatment of athletes be broken.

Nothing says Easter Sunday like 
brunch. Check out these local res-
taurants and order a mimosa. After all, brunch is — kind of — the most important meal of the day.
East End Eatery 1202 NE Eighth Ave.Rachel Bouchillon, a 22-year-
old UF interdisciplinary ecology graduate student, said East End Eatery is one of her favorite brunch places.
“I really like the tempeh scram-
ble there, and sometimes I’ll get one of their Eggs Benedict, too,” she said.
She said she likes going there 
with a small group of friends be-cause it’s quaint.
“It has a more Gainesville-resi-
dent feel to it,” she said.
Sandra Carlisi, owner of East 
End Eatery, said the restaurant has specials for brunch every week and tries to cater to different themes. 
Its upcoming focus is Easter.“We’re doing a Black Forest ham 
with roasted potatoes, and peas and carrots,” Carlisi said. “One of the other Easter kind of foods is asparagus and a champagne om-elette.”
The Top
30 N. Main St.
Ana Fajardo, a 21-year-old UF 
women’s studies junior, said she likes eating brunch at The Top be-cause of its vegan options.Fajardo recommends getting 
there early because it gets busy fast.
David Gordon, manager at The 
Top, said he won’t add any special Easter-themed brunch items. 
He said The Top generally has 
an omelette or French toast special.
“We’re a pretty eclectic restau-
rant. We have different kinds of Benedicts, also chicken and bis-cuits, traditional comfort foods,” he said. “You can get anything you 
want, really.”
Brunch at The Top is from 11 
a.m. to 2 p.m., but Gordon said it  
usually runs out of food quickly.
“We have church-goers and ni-
hilists alike. We have all sorts of people that come to the brunch, so we try to cater to that broad stroke,” he said.
The Flying Biscuit Cafe4150 NW 16th Blvd.Amanda Di Lella, a 21-year-old 
UF telecommunication junior, said she and her boyfriend go almost every Sunday to have brunch.
“It’s really good food, and it’s 
not too expensive. There’s a lot of people that go there on Sundays,” she said.
But she said if you plan on go-
ing, call ahead.
“Me and my boyfriend always 
get the grits, biscuits, and the French toast is awesome,” Di Lella said.
The Flying Biscuit Cafe will 
have its normal breakfast menu all day during their Sunday hours from 7 a.m. to 4 p.m.
101 Downtown201 Southeast 2nd Avenue  
“We are doing a very special 
brunch on Easter as a whole be-cause we actually started a brand new brunch menu,” Phillip Hamp-ton, assistant general manager, said. 
A few items on the new brunch 
menu include fried chicken and waffles, a veggie burger and a grilled watermelon salad. 
Hampton said 101 Downtown 
will have brunch on Saturdays as well as Sundays. Brunch on Sun-
day will run from 11 a.m. to 5 p.m.

� TRADE PROTEIN SHAKES 
FOR REAL FOOD, STRETCH AFTER YOUR WORKOUTS AND LAUGH OFTEN — BUT DON’T CALL IT EXERCISE.
TEODORA YORDANOVA
Avenue Writer
Summertime is right around the 
corner, and it might be a good idea 
to sift through some fitness folklore before heading to the gym to prep your beach-ready body. 
Leah Dupuie, coordinator for fit-
ness, strength and conditioning at RecSports, deciphers fact from fic-tion and offers up some advice for the proper workout.Myth: You’ll burn more fat if 
you exercise longer at a lower in-tensity.
Truth: High-intensity exercise 
can be hard to sustain for long peri-ods, even though it does burn more calories than low-intensity work-outs. 
“Regular physical activity and 
a healthy diet will lead to a body composition that fits each individ-ual’s body frame. (The American College of Sports Medicine) rec-ommends 150 minutes of physical activity a week which can include a longer duration at a lower intensity (55-65% of maximum heart rate) or a shorter duration at a higher inten-sity (85% of maximum heart rate),” Dupuie wrote in an email.Myth: You should stretch before 
a workout.
Truth: It is 
more effective to stretch after a 
workout when your joints and 
muscles are still warm, according to an article by 
the MD Anderson Cancer Center. 
Although stretching before a 
workout does little to prep your body for exercise, stretching afterward does more to maintain flexibility, reduce muscle tension and improve circulation. And while you’re doing it, remember to take long, deep breaths. In through your nose, out through your mouth.Myth: Incorporating a sports 
drink or protein shake in a workout regimen gives better results.
Truth: Those might be useful in 
emergencies, but your best protein source is from real food. Studies have been inconsistent regarding high levels of post-workout protein intake with supplements, according to an article by Men’s Health.
“Protein shakes and supple-
ments are not regulated by the FDA and are something to be cautious of as their list of ingredients may not always be factual and the ‘pro-prietary blend’ that is listed could encompass anything. Whole, natu-ral foods provide the nutrition that most individuals need on a daily basis,” Dupuie wrote.Myth: Laughter is a form of 
exercise.
Truth: A 2012 Oxford University 
study showed similarity between laughter and working out in terms of endorphins released during both activities. 
Long story short, laughing and 
exercising both help to release endorphins and boost your mood, but unfortunately the two aren’t interchangeable.
“Laughter can certainly elicit a 
hormone response similar to the benefits of exercise. But if our goal is achieving higher VO2, becoming better at a sport or increasing our 1 repetition maximum, laughter will probably not be in the specific program design,” Dupuie wrote.

“Call Me Maybe” and “I Love College” 
are expecting.
Well, not exactly a baby, but it is time for 
a new Song of the Summer to join their little 
family — you know, those singles that get 
played a million times on the radio but you don’t care because they’re so damn catchy.
The Song of the Summer title is unofﬁ  -
cial but highly coveted, and the single that 
takes this year’s cake will join the ranks of 
classics like “California Gurls” and “I Gotta 
Feeling.”
So, yeah, it’s kind of a big deal.Spring may just be getting in full swing, 
but potential chart-toppers are already emerging. Here’s our breakdown:
1. “Mmm Yeah” — Austin Mahone ft. 
Pitbull
This eloquent song will be perfect to lis-
ten to while getting ready to go out on sum-mer nights. Sure, it’s simple — the words “mmm” and “yeah” comprise at least 70 percent of the lyrics — but that just means you don’t have to focus too hard. No deep feelings, no problem, and that’s exactly what we want in our Song of the Summer.
2. “West Coast” — Lana Del ReyOn the opposite end of the music-emo-
tion spectrum, there’s “West Coast.” This new release is certainly not upbeat but is  deﬁ  nitely passionate. Play this on low vol-ume while you lie in bed with the windows 
open (and fan cranked, let’s be real) reading a romance novel. Although easy on the ears, 
“West Coast” is a little too intense to win Song of the Summer.
3. “G.U.Y.” — Lady 
Gaga
Gaga is back, and she’s 
ready to ﬁ  ght for the Song of the Summer award. “G.U.Y.” has Twitter in-nuendo, a strange music video and a weirdly em-
powering message — “want the power to leave you,” she sings — so it’s bound to be a Song of the Summer hit. We wouldn’t mind hearing this dominate the airwaves, espe-
cially because its chorus is so hypnotizing.
4. “Summer” — Calvin Harris
This song has, like, 30 words total, but it’s 
nice and sweet with a great beat. It’s a solid nominee for Song of the Summer; after all, it’s literally called “Summer.” This single is smooth but unfortunately underwhelming — Harris does better when he’s collaborat-
ing with other artists. It needs at least three 
times more lyrics to win the title.
5. “I Wanna Get Better” — BleachersThrow on your vintage Ray-Bans, and 
tie your hair back with a bandanna because this indie anthem could be your hipster Song of the Summer. fun. musician Jack Antonoff worked on it, and, because it re-
ﬂ  ects his style of overlapping melodies, 
sounds great. It may not be mainstream, but “I Wanna Get Better” conjures fantasies of driving with the windows down.Five early contenders of

It’s the most glorious time of the year. 
The days are hotter, the pools are sparkling, and each studio is releasing its best at-tempt to get your money. Here’s a guide to 
what you should see in theaters, wait for on 
Redbox or just skip altogether. 
SEE:
“X-Men: Days of Future Past” (May 23)  
The sequel to the outstanding “X-Men: First 
Class,” “Days of Future Past” combines the old X-Men franchise with the new in a time-
travel story line that is ambitious and excit-
ing. Add in Halle Berry and Peter Dinklage 
and this is a sure winner. Plus J-Law.
“Maleﬁ  cent” (May 30)  Angelina Jolie 
with horns and an evil smile is enough to draw me in. Disney’s retelling of Sleeping Beauty from the titular villainess’ point of view looks like it has amazing visuals and top-notch fantasy action. The soundtrack looks great too, headlined by an ethereal Lana Del Rey “Once Upon a Dream” cover.
“The Fault in Our Stars” (June 6)  I’m 
not going to lie — I have a huge crush on Shailene Woodley. Fresh off her recent “Di-vergent” success, Woodley plays teenage cancer patient Hazel Grace Lancaster in this adaptation of the popular John Green book. Bring your tissues.REDBOX:
“Godzilla” (May 16)  I admit that I 
was pretty skeptical about this remake, 
but after seeing the trailers, I’m excited. 
It looks to have an intense “Cloverﬁ  eld” 
vibe and is led by “Breaking Bad’s” Bry-an Cranston.
“Snowpiercer” (June 27)  After a cli-
mate experiment goes horribly wrong, most life is wiped off the face of the 
Earth, except for a few hundred safely 
on board a perpetually moving train. Re-freshingly, this is not an apocalypse thrill-er but an ambitious drama about class and survival. Starring “Captain America” 
star Chris Evans and the always-welcome 
Tilda Swinton.
“Guardians of the Galaxy” (Aug. 1)   
Marvel’s next team of action heroes hits the big screen — but this time they’re in 
space, and they’re all wanted criminals. The only reason I won’t see this in the-aters is because I’m not sold on Chris 
Pratt as a dramatic lead. Assuming he 
can pull it off, though, this could be an “Avengers”-level hit. It also stars Zoe Sal-
dana as a green alien woman and Brad-
ley Cooper’s voice as a burly raccoon. Yep, a raccoon.SKIP:
“The Amazing Spider-Man 2” (May 
2) I wasn’t a huge fan of the ﬁ  rst one, 
and nine times out of 10, superhero 
sequels are worse than their originals. 
Not even a blue Jamie Foxx as villain Electro can save this one. Andrew Garﬁ  eld and Emma Stone reprise their 
roles as Peter Parker and Gwen Stacy. 
Am I the only one who thinks Stone can 
do better?
“Transformers: Age of Extinction” 
(June 27)  I would rather watch paint 
dry than watch another “Transformers” ﬁ  lm. I am truly confused by how these movies continue to draw in millions of 
dollars. The only very small glimmer 
of hope comes in the replacement of the insufferable Shia LaBeouf with the marginally less insufferable Mark Wahlberg.
“Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles” 
(Aug. 8) Do I even need to explain why you shouldn’t see this one? I actually 
don’t know what I’m less excited about 
— the fact that this classic children’s 
series is being corrupted by Michael Bay or the return of the oh-so-talented Megan Fox.See, Redbox and skip: A critic’s guide to

Gators add recruit
The UF softball team received a letter of intent from 
St. Cloud native Aleshia Ocasio. Ocasio currently leads her high school with a .492 batting average.UF hurdler Eddie Lovett didn’t always consider a future in track and ﬁ  eld. Read the story on page 16.JORDAN MCPHERSON

Florida surprised many in 
2013.
After the graduation of out-
ﬁ  elder Michelle Moultrie — UF’s 
all-time batting average leader 
with a .385 clip at the plate — and 
the transfers of Cheyenne Coyle and Sami and Kasey Fagan in 2012, the Gators were left with a young team. 
They were projected to ﬁ  n-
ish fourth in the Southeastern Conference Eastern Division and started the season ranked No. 14 
in preseason polls after beginning 
the season in the top 10 for four straight years.
With ﬁ  ve freshmen in the start-
ing lineup, UF proved it was still a contender — taking both the SEC regular-season and tourna-ment titles for the ﬁ  rst time since 2009 and reaching the Women’s 
College World Series for the ﬁ  fth 
time in six years.
Florida returned all but one 
starter from that 2013 team and has only two seniors on its roster — right-handed pitcher Hannah Rogers and third baseman Steph-anie Tofft.
“That’s one thing you overlook 
when you bring back as many starters from the year before when we went to the Women’s College World Series,” coach Tim Walton said. 
“We are young, and at times 
we’ve shown silly mistakes from a team and they are a lot of youthful mistakes. The speed of the game 
sometimes dictates what you can 
kind of make of mistakes.”
Despite returning 12 of its 13 
players who started at least 24 games, Florida is still ﬁ  nding ways to utilize its freshmen in the lineup in 2014.
Outﬁ  elder Justine McLean has 
started 39 games so far this year for UF, accumulating a .316 bat-ting average and a .979 ﬁ  elding percentage. 
The Rancho Cucamonga, Ca-
lif., native is one of three Florida players with at least a .300 batting average, 28 runs and 10 stolen bases on the year.
Left-handed pitcher Delanie 
Gourley has established herself as the No. 2 starter in the rotation behind Rogers, starting 15 games and pitching nearly a third of Florida’s innings this season.

Having a “hot hand” or being “on 
ﬁ  re” is not actually a thing. The same 
goes for being cold or in a slump.
Being able to score multiple times in 
a row is talent. Missing shots multiple 
times in multiple games is the struggle 
to tap into that talent.
This season, Florida’s offensive suc-cess has been largely due to the team’s abil-
ity to access that 
talent across the board and have 10 or 
11 scorers in each game.
However, since Florida (14-2, 5-0 
American Lacrosse Conference) faced Penn State on March 30, its offense has ﬂ  oundered. Freshman aiming to 
continue hot streakEXTRAGORDONARY CIRCUMSTANCES
Hockey is efﬁ  ng great. It’s full of cool 
stuff.
In hockey, you can see a forward 
leading the rush up ice, put his head down for 
an instant, only to get bulldozed by a prowling 
defenseman. 
Goalies make impossible saves regularly, 
haphazardly waving an occasional arm or leg (or even their masked faces) to deﬂ  ect a small, vulcanized rubber disc, which sometimes trav-els at speeds in excess of 100 mph, away from the twine that sits behind them. Skaters bob, weave and spin their ways around defenders 
to make a no-look pass or maybe even score a 
goal, with a deafening goal horn to punctuate the magic. 
And there’s ﬁ  ghting. The bruisers ﬁ  ght each other, mainly. Some-times it’s staged goonery, but other times it’s the boiling over of real frustra-tion, with the out-
come potentially al-
tering the end result of a game, series or even a season. 
Goalies and even 
coaches get in on the ﬁ  sticuffs occasionally, all at the cost of ﬁ  ve minutes in the penalty box. 
And all of that happens in a single game. Hockey also has an incomparable history.
By the 1950s, celebrated ﬁ  gures like Maurice 
“The Rocket” Richard and Mr. Hockey, Gordie Playoff hockey is worth watching

“Feeling very blessed today.. Lady gave me an extra donut at dunkin”
Gabby Mallette (@Gmallette7) 
UF outside hitterScorers such as freshmen Sam-
mi Burgess and Mollie Stevens and 
junior Shannon Gilroy have been essential to the team’s success. 
Having those supporting scor-
ers for Burgess, Stevens and Gil-roy — like sophomores Devon Schneider and Carly Ross — has been an even bigger piece to the of-fense’s puzzle.
Coming into the season, many 
expected Gilroy and junior team-mate Nora Barry would carry the team in goals and assists. Instead, 
Burgess has been Gilroy’s go-to 
player when she is being face-guarded or triple-teamed.
But Burgess has faltered lately.As one of Florida’s biggest scor-
ers behind Gilroy, the freshman’s difficulty connecting with the net forced her teammates to step up when she couldn’t make it hap-
pen.
Heading into Florida’s match 
against Vanderbilt on Sunday, 
Burgess worked hard on refining her accuracy and completing her shots. The Forest Hill, Md., native went as far as upgrading to a lon-ger stick.
“I shot a lot after practice last 
week, just because, you know, they weren’t falling for me,” Burgess said. “But I actually have a longer stick now. I’m just thinking a little 
less when I play.”It seems that with the adjust-
ments since the Penn State game, she has returned to the Burgess that Florida fans know and missed.
Against the Commodores, Bur-
gess was the leading scorer with a total of four goals and one assist. 
Two of her goals came on back-to-
back scores in the first half.
After putting no points on the 
board for the Gators against the 
Nittany Lions and Blue Jays, Bur-gess felt that it was a relief to final-ly get back to her old style of play.
“That little change was like, 
you know, it’s something, give me something,” Burgess said. “I think 
it helped me to get around defend-
ers with my stick more and get a little bit more power behind the ball with my shots.”
Not only was Burgess’ perfor-
mance on Sunday a career-high goal mark, but it was also enough to make the freshman the ALC Rookie of the Week — a title that 
she has received two other times 
this season.
Burgess’ scoring issues weren’t 
a concern for coach Amanda O’Leary. Her work on shooting in the last two weeks is all a part of helping the freshman grow.
“We challenge Sammi to get bet-
ter,” O’Leary said. “She had strug-
gled a little bit. She put in some 
extra work this week. Her mental state was one that she was going to go out and have fun. Sammi’s her harshest critic. She makes a mis-take and it’s world ending. It’s one thing we’ve worked on her with.”THURSDAY, APRIL 17, 2014 � ALLIGATOR, 15

Gators have won six straight games going into final stretch
Chelsea Herndon, a utility 
player, has 24 starts this year — 
14 at second base, one at short-stop and nine in the outfield. The Carrollton, Texas, native has a 
.271 clip at the plate and seven 
extra-base hits.
“I’m really impressed with 
them,” first baseman Taylor Schwarz said. “Even since fall when we had 6 a.m.’s, they were always there, always on time, al-ways working hard. 
“This year, it’s really weird to 
see someone where I was in their position last year — and I still feel like a freshman sometimes — but their composure and their atti-
tude and positivity throughout no 
matter what were going through has really been impressive.”Florida opened 2014 with 22 
straight wins — including victo-ries against top-25 teams in South Florida, Michigan, Minnesota and Oregon — and spent five weeks at the No. 1 spot in the country.
But the Gators went 9-8 in its 
ensuing 17 contests, including dropping four consecutive games 
for the first time since losing six 
straight from March 25, 2011 to April 3, 2011.“I think when we had No. 
1 next to our name, there was a lot of pressure,” Schwarz said. “I think we play better when we’re the underdogs.”
With just 10 games left in the 
regular season and Florida back to its winning ways after claim-ing six straight victories, Walton 
is confident in the capabilities of 
his young team to finish strong heading into postseason play.“I’ve said it from Day 1: I re-
ally like our team,” Walton said. 
“Are we talented enough to 
win the Women’s College World Series? I think yes. Are we capa-ble of that? I think yes. 
“But there’s so many other fac-
tors that go into not only winning the next game, let alone looking 
that far down the road and I think 
we have so many things to still continue to improve on.”

Hockey boasts storied history, exciting postseason upsets
Howe, played their greatest seasons for the 
Montreal Canadiens and Detroit Red Wings, respectively. 
Howe was a real badass. To illustrate 
my point, a hockey colloquialism called a 
“Gordie Howe Hat Trick” happens when a 
player scores a goal, earns an assist and gets into a fight in one game — things Howe used to do regularly.
Howe, a 23-time All-Star, played more 
than 30 years in the NHL, won four Stanley Cups and played until he was 52 years old. 
And this didn’t happen during Ty Cobb’s 
ragtime era, either. This was through 1980. 
In recent years, the level of parity in the 
NHL playoffs has been akin to that of March Madness.
Eight seeds beating one seeds in the first 
round is a fairly common occurrence. 
A Cinderella danced its way to a Stanley 
Cup in 2012 when the Los Angeles Kings, 
the lowest seed in their conference, beat the 
sixth-seeded New Jersey Devils. 
Winning a seven-game series after drop-
ping the first three games — that happens.
The Philadelphia Flyers did it in 2010. Af-
ter being down 3-0 in the conference semifi-nals to the Boston Bruins, the Flyers went on to win the next four games, despite trailing 3-0 in Game 7. 
Sudden-death overtime is also a regular 
affair in the playoffs, coupled with the puck-ering sphincters of the participating teams’ fans. 
All the tangible aspects are there for hock-
ey to sweep a population off its feet. Just look at Canada. 
In the States, however, the exposure is 
paltry at best.
The NHL is the redheaded stepchild of 
the four major sports. 
It’s about as well-known in America — 
particularly Florida — as Karl-Petter Thor-waldsson, president of the Swedish Trade Union Confederation.
Perhaps it’s because the NHL features 
the occasional game on the Food Network or QVC, or whatever the hell network they’re 
showing games and stuff on these days 
(Sources tell me you can find traces of hock-ey on NBC Sports Network, sandwiched be-tween Spike and VH1 on the channel guide here in Gainesville, but that has not yet been confirmed). 
With this season’s installment of the post-
season starting this week (if not on NBCSN, probably on public access television), tune 
in. The NBA playoffs aren’t going to matter 
until the conference finals, anyway.coluMn , from page 14LAWRENCE LAGUNA

Walking onto the UF campus his fresh-
man year, Eddie Lovett didn’t see track 
and ﬁ  eld as his future. 
Lovett was thrilled to run track, but his 
main focus was football. 
But three years later, as a senior, he’s 
the only four-time Southeastern Confer-ence champion in the 60-meter hurdles.  
“Winning four in a row is something 
that I never really thought about,” Lovett said. 
“I never really tried to put that pressure 
on myself. But just these last two years my coach and I really talked about staying un-
defeated, and that is what I did.”…
Before Lovett came to UF, he played 
football with former Gators defensive back 
and current Baltimore Ravens safety Matt Elam at Palm Beach Lakes High in West Palm Beach.
Lovett ﬁ  rst met Elam through his fam-
ily before the two met each other back in high school.
Elam, a second-year NFL player, played 
with Lovett during their freshman and sophomore years at Palm Beach Lakes. The two athletes also ran track together. 
Lovett started as a quarterback but 
switched to wide receiver, where Elam 
thought he was a threat.
Elam said when Lovett switched to 
wide receiver, his speed made him a deep 
threat who could go up and make the tough plays. 
He was one of the top players on the 
team and had several colleges scouting him, including Central Michigan and Western Michigan. 
Lovett was highly interested in both 
Michigan schools that approached him. 
One of the things Elam recognized 
about his high school teammate was his ability to silence the critics.
In the end, scouts thought Lovett wasn’t 
talented enough for Division I football.
Elam said he respects his teammate a 
lot because he overcame a lot of negativity, 
which helped him become the track star he 
is today. 
“A lot of people doubted him,” Elam 
said. 
“He kept on competing and he never 
gave up. He made sure he silenced the people who doubted him. “I just feel like his competitiveness and 
the way he worked helped him overcome that.”
One thing Elam will always remember 
about Lovett was that he was truly an in-tense competitor.
The duo drifted apart after Elam trans-
ferred to West Palm Beach William T. Dw-yer High, but the two reunited at UF on two different teams. 
Lovett said he looked up to Elam dur-
ing their duration at UF, and that both men encouraged and motivated each other as athletes and friends.
…
But what happened with that chance at 
playing college football after being looked at by colleges? 
Lovett’s football career came to an end 
after he suffered a broken arm during his 
senior year of high school. 
Despite the injury, he still competed 
during the track season and won a state 
title.
But deep inside, when the West Palm 
Beach native arrived in Gainesville, he still wanted to strap on football pads and a hel-met. 
“When I ﬁ  rst got here, I was excited to 
run track, but I wanted to play football,” Lovett said. “I even talked to [coach Mike Holloway] about it, and he gave me his 
words and I thought about it, but once 
the (track) season started and after SECs, it was just kind of like, ‘Let me see where this goes.’”
Under Holloway’s guidance, Lovett has 
created an unexpected life path by suc-ceeding in track.
Witnessing the maturation process of 
one of his ﬁ  nest athletes, Holloway knows 
Lovett as well as anyone else. 
“If you look at Eddie’s performances 
over his career here, he’s done a wonder-
ful job of understanding that it’s not about being the best in the country at a meet,” Holloway said. 
“It’s about being the best guy in the 
country at the national championships.”
The same athlete who was intimidated 
as a freshman by other elite hurdlers such as LSU’s Barrett Nugent — a two-time NCAA champion — has overcome those nerves and become that intimidating com-petitor.
The senior hurdler accrued a numerous 
amount of awards throughout his colle-giate career.
Lovett is the Gators’ record-holder in 
the 60-meter hurdles and 55-meter hurdles with times of 7.50 and 7.10, respectively. 
He is only the second Florida athlete to 
attempt a four-peat and the ﬁ  rst to accom-plish it. 
“I pretty much give credit to a lot of 
my ability to a higher power, to God, and just what I believe his purpose is for me and using the abilities I have,” Lovett said. “Before I get on the blocks, I basically say, ‘God, lead my steps.’ “I speak to my dad, I say a prayer to 
him and that’s about it, and just get ready for the race and however it happens, it happens.”
Saying a prayer to his dad, who was 
murdered in July of 2012 in the Virgin Is-lands, has motivated Lovett to be the best. 
…
From being a two-time gold medalist 
for USA and Virgin Islands in separate competitions to being one of UF’s all-time great athletes, is it possible to see Lovett at the Olympic stage come Summer 2016?
Once having dreams of playing on the 
gridiron to becoming a track stud, when it comes to Eddie Lovett, his background speaks for itself. 
“I deﬁ  nitely see myself going to the 
next few worlds and Olympics and (hav-ing) success,” he said, “I don’t know how much success, but I deﬁ  nitely see it and deﬁ  nitely believe that it’s possible.”16, ALLIGATOR � THURSDAY, APRIL 17, 2014
