Thanksgiving travelers may have 
to sit through trafﬁ  c before seeing 
their families and stufﬁ  ng their faces this year. 
A projected 46.3 million Ameri-
cans will travel 50 miles or more during the holiday weekend — the largest number of Thanksgiving travelers since 2007, according to the American Automobile Association. 
About 2.3 million Floridians will travel this week, and the association predicts about 90 percent will do so by car as gas prices are currently be-low $3 per gallon. 
The drop in gas prices is the low-
est AAA spokesman Mark Jenkins 
said the association has seen in four 
years.
“Falling gas prices are helping 
to boost disposable income and consumer spending,” Jenkins said. “People have a little more money in their pockets and that’s probably going to encourage people to travel more and spend more money.”
To compensate for increased 
travelers, Florida Highway Patrol is sending out all of its ofﬁ  cers to mon-itor major interstates throughout the week, said Sergeant Tracy Pace, 
public affairs ofﬁ  cer for Florida De-
partment of Highway Safety and Motor Vehicles, Troop B.
“Everybody needs to get out on 
the road because we know when holidays occur there are obviously more people on the road, and it takes all of us to get out there and keep the roadways safe for the mo-torists,” she said. 
Pace helps monitor her troop’s 
nine counties, which include both Alachua and Marion County. She said Interstate-75 and Interstate-10 
typically have the most problems 
throughout the holidays because of the large amount of trafﬁ  c.
“We pretty much just saturate 
the interstate as much as possible,” she said.
Last year’s Thanksgiving week-
end saw 13 crashes occur on I-75 in Alachua County, which included 15 injuries. None of the accidents between Nov. 28 and Dec. 1 were fatalities, Pace said. 
“I never like to say any crash is 
good but it could always be worse,” 
she said. 
A total of about 4,773 accidents 
were reported statewide during 
last year’s Thanksgiving weekend, and Pace said 29 of those crashes in-volved fatalities.
Pace said holiday travelers 
Thanksgiving weekend travel highest since 2007

Brittany King ﬁ  ddled with the red bandana around 
her head anxiously waiting for an announcement out of 
Ferguson, Missouri.
King and about 25 members of UF Dream Defenders 
gathered at UF Civic Media Center on Monday night to wait for the grand jury decision on whether to indict Darren Wilson, the police ofﬁ  cer who killed the un-
armed 18-year-old Michael Brown in August.
As the verdict of no indictment was read, some 
shook their heads in disbelief while others yelled at the 
screen in anger calling the evidence falsiﬁ  ed.
In the last minutes of the verdict, the room went un-
naturally silent. Some dropped their heads in defeat while others left the center for a smoke.
Before the verdict reached an ending, King walked 
out of the center. King, a 25-year-old Santa Fe College

Gainesville Police arrested an Orlando 
man after ofﬁ  cers said he tried to sexually 
assault and rob another man at an ATM on 
Sunday afternoon.
The victim drew money out of a walk-
up ATM at the Campus USA Credit Union 
on Southwest 34th Street at about 4:30 p.m. Police said 58-year-old Phuc X. Kieu (his real name)  was inside his car with the driver’s seat 
pushed all the way back and began watching 
homosexual pornography on a portable DVD player in the bank parking lot.
When the other man walked by Kieu’s 
green Honda Civic, Kieu got out of the car 
and grabbed him. Kieu then punched the 
man in the mouth, grabbed $220 from him and pulled him into his 
car.
Once inside the car, po-
lice said Kieu straddled the man and started to pull off the victim’s shirt, belt and pants.
The victim managed to 
get Kieu off of him and get out of the car. While he was trying to escape, police said Kieu grabbed the man’s backpack. 
The victim still managed to get away.  
The victim then ran to the nearby 34th 
Street Plaza, yelling “rapist.”
Police found Kieu shortly after and arrest-
ed him on charges of sexual assault, robbery and kidnapping. He is currently being held 
on a $150,000 bond. Police: Phuc Kieu arrested, charged with attempted rape, burglary

Polish town opposes Pooh Bear 
for unclear gender 
WARSAW, Poland — Officials 
in a Polish town have opposed 
a proposition to name a play-
ground after Winnie-the-Pooh 
due to the bear’s unclear gen-der and immodest clothing.The matter was debated in a 
closed-door meeting weeks 
ago in the central Polish town 
of Tuszyn. Recordings of the meeting were leaked in which officials complained that Pooh 
Bear is immodestly dressed 
and lacks a gender. One called 
the bear a “hermaphrodite.”Some said a fully clothed Polish bear named Uszatek 
would be a better choice.
One of the Pooh Bear oppo-
nents told a newspaper that he had been joking at the end of a discussion on a playground 
that had gone on too long.WHAT’S HAPPENING?

FSU SHOOTING
THE ASSOCIATED PRESS
TALLAHASSEE — In the frantic 
moments at the Florida State Uni-
versity campus library last week, bullets struck 21-year-old student Farhan “Ronny” Ahmed three 
times, including a shot that severe-
ly damaged his spine and left him paralyzed from the waist down, his sister said Monday.
“Despite his injuries, he’s alive, 
and we’re so grateful that he’s here with us,” said Farhana Ahmed dur-ing a brief news conference at Talla-hassee Memorial HealthCare.
His status has been upgraded from critical to serious.
He is the only person who re-
mains hospitalized from last week’s shooting. Officers shot and killed the gunman, 31-year-old Myron May, 
outside the front entrance of Strozier 
Library. Library employee Nathan Scott, who was shot in the leg, was released from the hospital last week. Another student, Elijah Velez, was grazed by a bullet and was treated and released at the scene.
May, an attorney and 2005 FSU 
graduate, reloaded at least once and 
tried to enter the library, where at 
least 400 students were studying for midterm exams early Thursday, but was blocked by lobby security bar-riers that permit only students and staff inside. Police responded within two minutes of the first 911 call and fired off a barrage of bullets that killed him. FSU officials noted the security barriers were put in place in late 2008 — or after May had already left the school.
Ronny Ahmed is from Orlando and is studying to be a biomedical engineer. University President John Thrasher, who has met with the family, said the school is “100 per-cent committed to ensuring” it does 
what it can to help Ahmed graduate 
as planned. The student’s friends have already started raising money on his behalf to help with medical expenses.
Classes resumed a day after the 
shooting, and the library reopened. But it could be weeks before the in-vestigation is wrapped up. Police are 
likely to question witnesses again, 
and a grand jury will review the ac-tions of campus police and Tallahas-see police, who killed May.
Videos and a journal obtained by 
police indicate May, who went on to graduate from law school at Texas Tech, thought he was being watched 
and targeted by the government. He 
also complained to police and prop-erty managers in New Mexico that cameras were watching him in his apartment and that he heard voices talking about and laughing at him, according to police reports released last week.

As U.S. colleges and universi-
ties enrolled a record-breaking 
number of international students, UF saw its own numbers increase as well. 
This school year, 886,052 inter-
national students enrolled in col-leges and universities throughout the country.
According to the 2014 Open 
Doors Report on International Educational Exchange, students from all over the globe now make up about 4 percent of all university 
students in the U.S., which hosts 
more international students than any other country. 
The number of international 
students in the U.S. has grown 72 percent since 2000.
This semester, more than 6,100 
international students from 139 different countries are attending 
UF, according to the UF Interna-
tional Center.
These numbers have increased over the years. In Fall 2013, about 4,642 international students were enrolled at UF. 
Franjo Ivankovic, a 20-year-
old UF biology and anthropology sophomore from Mostar, Bosnia-Herzegovina, has been dreaming 
of coming to the U.S. since he was 
a child.
“When I was 6, I walked into 
my aunt’s living room as she was putting up a picture of the New York skyline, and I can remem-ber her telling me about the tallest building in the world and that the city never sleeps,” Ivankovic said. 
“That day I made a promise to 
myself that I would make it to that country, and now I’m here.”
UF’s Navigators program has 
helped students from all over the world, like Ivankovic, settle into UF. 
Samantha Amos, treasurer of 
UF Navigators said there are about 
250 international students in the 
club this semester, and since she started there has been a dramatic increase.International students 
enrolled at all-time high
“Despite his injuries, he’s 
alive, and we’re so grateful 
that he’s here with us.”
Farhana Ahmed
family member“We won’t be silent,” she said.
Organizers around Gainesville pre-
pared to take a stand against oppression 
Monday, no matter the outcome later that 
night.
“We want people to know we’re here, 
and we have no right to be shot in the 
street like an animal,” she said.
Azaari Mason, 19, was at a loss for 
words after the decision. The UF politi-
cal science junior turned his back from the center and watched the cars drive by on 
Main Street in silence.
“Mike Brown could have been me,” he 
said with waterd eyes. “Could have been 
a brother.”
As five Dream Defenders members 
smoked outside, a police car pulled into the driveway of the fire station. 
An officer stood talking with two fire-
fighters.  The five smokers rolled their eyes 
and threw up their hands in frustration.
“Are they really here to monitor us?”  
King said.
Today at 6 p.m. members of the Interna-
tional People’s Uhuru Movement, a world-
wide organization that combats black op-pression, will be joined by local groups at a demonstration in front of the Alachua County Courthouse at 220 S. Main St.
The groups will stand in solidarity with 
victims of police violence like Brown and 
raise awareness of police misconduct, said 
Jesse Nevel, national chair of the Uhuru Solidarity Movement.  
Nevel said no matter the decision, the 
issues at play in Wilson’s shooting of the 
unarmed Brown on Aug. 9 happen around 
the country. 
“This is not just confined to Ferguson,” 
he said. “You can’t sit on the fence. You have to take a stand.” 
Similar rallies are expected in St. Peters-
burg, Houston, San Diego and London. 
UF organization Students for a Demo-
cratic Society will also be participating to 
raise awareness on the flaws in the U.S. 
court system, said Sky Button, a member and a UF wildlife ecology and conserva-tion freshman.
“The decision of this case is basically 
telling us how essentially the courts are responding to systemic oppression of mar-ginalized groups,” Button, 18, said. 
The groups will gather and hold signs, 
including UF’s Dream Defenders and Stu-dents for Justice in Palestine. More than 100 people are expected to attend. 
Nevel said the Wilson case has brought the issue of black targeting by police to people’s TV screens and newspaper head-lines. 
“Ferguson has come to symbolize that reality for a lot of people,” Nevel said. “But it didn’t start with Mike Brown, and it doesn’t end with him.” should make sure their cars are work-
ing properly, familiarize themselves with the roadways and get plenty of sleep before driving long distances. 
Drivers should keep jumper ca-
bles, a flashlight and a tangible map handy in case a GPS or phone doesn’t work, Pace said.
She encouraged drivers to follow 
the speed limit and be patient, calm and courteous when traveling. 
“We don’t need some road rage. 
It’s not going to help anyone get any-where faster,” she said. “Remember 
that everyone has some place they want to get to, and everybody has 
people that love them.”
Weather shouldn’t be an issue 
for travelers driving in Florida, even though a large winter storm is ex-pected to hit northeastern states this 
week, said Miami National Weather 
Service specialist Bob Ebaugh.
But Ebaugh said the storm could 
affect air travel for Floridians. 
“You have a lot of people traveling 
back and forth,” he said. “Depending on the timing of it and the severity of it, you can count on it having some sort of impact on the airlines.”4, ALLIGATOR � TUESDAY, NOVEMBER 25, 2014

The UF Foundation has kickstart-
ed a fundraising campaign to raise 
$100 million for the Machen Florida Opportunity Scholars program.
So far, the foundation has raised 
more than $62 million for the stu-dent scholarship program for those who are the first in their families to attend college.
The organization provides schol-
arships to more than 3,200 students who come from 62 of Florida’s 67 counties.
Leslie Pendleton, the director of 
the Machen Florida Opportunity Scholars program, said the money raised during the campaign will go directly to the student scholarships.“We have more first-generation, 
low-income students at UF than we have the money to support right now,” she said.
The program, named after UF 
President Bernie Machen and First Lady Chris Machen, mainly receives its donation through private invest-ments from certain UF funds, alum-ni and friends.
It’s the most successful univer-
sity-wide fundraising campaign for UF students in the school’s history, according to a press release.
A former Opportunity Scholar 
has even contributed to the new campaign. Brandon White, a 27-year-old Orlando lawyer, donated $1,000 Saturday, said UF spokesman Steve 
Orlando in a press release.
A 15-member volunteer council consisting of alumni and program supporters will be in charge of the 
campaign.
Pendleton said the initiative was 
established in order to help sustain the scholars program for “ideally forever.”
Founded in 2006, the scholar-
ship program gives specifically to students who have lower socioeco-nomic backgrounds. It was estab-lished in part due to national studies 
indicating that these students are less likely to enroll in four-year col-leges or universities because of their 
fear of debt and work getting in the way of school.
The student scholars come from 
families who make an average in-come of $18,292.
Lissie Williams, a 19-year-old 
psychology sophomore, is a scholar-ship recipient. She said she receives 
about $20,000 each semester and 
uses it for her housing, tuition, food and textbooks.
“This scholarship has impacted 
my time at UF in such a positive way,” Williams said. “I am able to fully enjoy my college experience without the stress of how much it is costing me.”
She said people should choose 
UF because they actually want to come here and believe it’s an ex-
ceptional university before thinking 
about the scholarship.
“Everyone deserves to be given 
the chance to go to college, and this scholarship does just that,” she said. “It allows students to really enjoy the college experience without the burden of student loans or being in debt after undergrad.”
Without the scholarship, Wil-
liams  said, she would have had to live farther away from campus to afford cheaper rent, which would have made it difficult for her partici-pate in the many organizations she is involved in.
“This scholarship makes people 
passionate about UF, which makes 
them want to do so much for UF as a 
way to give back,” she said.

THE ASSOCIATED PRESS
WASHINGTON — Michele 
Flournoy, formerly the Penta-
gon’s policy chief and among President Barack Obama’s more hawkish advisers, could be in 
line to become the first woman 
to lead the U.S. military after De-fense Secretary Chuck Hagel’s resignation.
Passed over by Obama for 
the job 20 months ago, Flournoy 
heads a short list of candidates to 
direct the war against the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria and help Afghanistan fight the Taliban in-surgency.
Other contenders include 
Ashton Carter, until last year the Pentagon’s No. 2-ranked official, and Robert Work, Hagel’s cur-rent deputy.
Sen. Jack Reed isn’t interest-
ed in the job, a spokesman said Monday. Obama had mentioned Reed on Monday as he recounted a 2008 trip to Afghanistan with the Rhode Island Democrat and Hagel, then a Republican sena-tor from Nebraska. At the White House, Obama said Hagel would 
stay on until the Senate confirms 
a successor. No timeframe for the transition was given.
Flournoy, among the most se-
nior female officials in Pentagon history, has a long history with Obama. After winning the 2008 election, President-elect Obama asked her to co-lead his transi-
tion team at the Defense Depart-
ment. She then kept a relatively low profile as undersecretary of defense for policy, engaged in efforts to end the war in Iraq, re-invigorate the military campaign 
in Afghanistan and redesign U.S. 
defense strategy to deal with se-vere budget cuts.
Always loyal to the president 
publicly, Flournoy often played the role of principled objector in closed-doors meetings, differing on matters such as the size and scope of the Afghan surge with 
Vice President Joe Biden and

Santa Fe College Police has boost-
ed its presence on campus following 
a shooting at Florida State University late last week.
While additional officers were not 
hired, the department did increase patrols around campus in an effort to be “far more visible,” said Santa Fe Police Chief Ed Book.
The increased patrols began 
Thursday after the FSU shooting at Strozier Library left three wounded — one of whom is still in serious con-dition — and the gunman, Myron 
May, dead.
To prepare for any type of emer-
gency, Book said the department 
trains all year and stays alert.
“At Santa Fe, in general, there is a 
very heightened sense of awareness all the time,” Book said. “We do a tremendous amount of professional development and training with our 
staff and students.”
University Police spokesman Brad 
Barber said the department had not 
increased patrols as of the weekend.
One such way Book said Santa Fe 
Police train for emergency situations is through programs like “Frontline Safety, Front Line Service,” which fo-cuses on protecting staff in confined 
and more vulnerable positions, like 
front desk managers and administra-tive personnel.
During the Association of Florida 
Colleges conference this year, Book said Santa Fe presented on “Front-line Safety” for other college police departments.
“We did the training for them — 
for the other colleges to show what we’re doing here at Santa Fe,” Book said, “so we know we’re a leader in the field in safety and security train-ing.”Santa Fe

Vote or post a message at www.alligator.orgModay’s question: Do you have class 
Tuesday?Today’s question: Do you think the grand jury in the 
Michael Brown shooting made the right decision?Universities need to ﬁ  ght sexual assault
Recently, Rolling Stone magazine published a sto-
ry exposing the University of Virginia’s extreme lack of attention to the dangers of sexual assault 
its students face. 
The article discussed the brutal gang rape of an 18-
year-old freshman that had taken place at a fraternity and 
the lack of care and support the victim received when she 
tried to speak about her attack.
The article seems to have ﬁ  nally gotten UVA to show 
interest in addressing this issue, and it should also bring 
the issue to the attention of other universities with high levels of sexual assault.
Rape is a horrible crime so pervasive on college 
campuses across the U.S. that it seems nobody is even shocked by it anymore, a fact that disgusts me.
UF is not an exception in this case.We were all shocked by the assaults that happened at 
the beginning of this semester. 
However, now that nothing has been reported re-
cently, it appears we have all decided to conveniently forget about the assaults and the fact that the person responsible was never caught.
I see patrol cars parked at Library West and around 
West University Avenue, but I rarely see any ofﬁ  cers.
Is this supposed to make me feel safe?Just because there aren’t assaults being neatly chimed 
to us in UF Alert text messages, it doesn’t mean there are no assaults taking place.
In fact, the opposite is true.As this semester draws to a close, I’d like us all to 
remember that the issues that were serious at the begin-ning of the year are just as serious now. 
UVA isn’t the only college that has been exposed for 
having a weak discipline policy regarding sexual as-sault. 
We’ve all heard about Columbia University’s lax in-difference regarding the “Carry That Weight” anti-sexual as-sault campaign started by stu-
dent Emma Sulkowicz. Recent-
ly, Columbia even attempted to ﬁ  ne the organization formed by Sulkowicz to support victims 
of assault for demonstrating its 
protest on campus.
It seems to me that many universities in the U.S. 
claim to support the victims of rape but only back up this supposed support with concrete action when there 
is an outside push. 
Only now that there is an article published in a na-
tional magazine about a speciﬁ  c instance of rape on 
campus does UVA take steps to end sexual assault at 
its institution. 
One can only hope these actions of support will con-
tinue.
The Thanksgiving holiday is a time to not just give 
thanks for the safety of our family and friends but for the safety and well-being of other human beings around 
the world, including other students attending college. 
When the safety of these individuals is compromised 
or not considered worthy enough to protect by the uni-
versity they attend, we are all threatened.
Universities across the country need to continue to 
show actions of support to victims of sexual assault, as 
well as continue to take preventive measures and main-tain severe policies against rape.
We need to remember, as a student body, that every 
one of us can help to take action.

Be grateful, don’t 
shop, give back
For most people, Thanksgiving is all about the three F’s: 
food, family and football. The image of a family gathered around the table with a large turkey in the middle is one of 
America’s most iconic scenes.
Unfortunately, in recent years, the time-honored tradition of 
Thanksgiving as a time of family reunions has been displaced by the unbridled consumerism and materialism of Black Friday.
Black Friday represents the worst of America’s unrestrained 
greed without any thought given to the economic or social consequences. Furthermore, it embodies the exact opposite of Thanksgiving’s purpose as a time to give thanks for what we already have rather than demanding more.
To make matters worse, many of the nation’s largest busi-
nesses — Wal-Mart, Kmart, Target, Best Buy, CVS and Ra-
dioshack to name a few — are beginning their Black Friday sales 
Thursday night, when shoppers and employees would likely otherwise be home with their families. There’s no question that the materialism represented by Black Friday — and now Black Thursday — has gotten completely out of hand.
This Thanksgiving, rather than rushing out to your nearest 
retail outlet, take some time to think about what you have to be grateful for and about those who do not have as much. As UF students, we have an opportunity to receive a world-class edu-
cation on one of the country’s most beautiful campuses — some-
thing many people, even many Americans, can only dream of.
This holiday weekend, we encourage Gators to avoid shop-
ping at any massive retail chains that are forcing their employ-ees to work on Thanksgiving Day.
If you have the ﬁ  nancial means, consider donating some of 
the money you might spend on a Black Friday deal to an orga-nization that works to provide food for those who would oth-erwise go hungry. Bread of the Mighty Food Bank and the Ala-
chua Coalition for the Homeless and Hungry are two excellent 
nonproﬁ  ts that help provide basic necessities for Gainesville’s most needy residents.
If you are unable to donate money to a worthy cause, spend 
some time on Thanksgiving or during the holiday weekend vol-unteering with a charitable organization in your community. Or-ganizations like Meals on Wheels provide Thanksgiving meals to poor and elderly individuals. Serving dinner at local homeless shelters is another excellent way to help the less fortunate.
DoSomething.org has other suggestions for ways to donate 
your time and money to worthy causes.
Engaging in volunteer work or donating to charity may well 
not be as immediately gratifying as getting a great discount on the newest iPad. However, taking the time to give to those in need makes all the difference in the world for those being helped.
We hope everyone in the UF community has a relaxing, en-
joyable and meaningful Thanksgiving. Fill up on turkey and 
stufﬁ  ng, spend time with your family and show your thanks for 
all you have by giving to those who have less. TUESDAY, NOVEMBER 25, 2014

One summer night two years 
ago, a dog named Lilly lost a leg and saved her owner’s life 
by dragging the unconscious woman off a set of train tracks to avoid an on-coming freight train. 
On Halloween a year later, a dog 
named Chako sustained multiple stab 
wounds after rushing to his owner’s aid 
when her abusive partner assaulted her. Earlier that month, a dog named Jack rescued his family’s cat from a coyote at-
tack.
All these heroic dogs were driven by loyalty and 
unconditional love to save their families from dan-
ger, but they also share another trait: These dogs are pit bulls.
Sadly, some of you might ﬁ  nd it shocking that 
a pit bull is capable of such brave and honorable actions. 
Decades of media bias have fueled misinforma-
tion about pit bulls, causing many Americans to view them as dangerous, unpredictable and inher-ently aggressive.
For many people who have owned, fostered or 
even met a pit bull, these myths could not be further 
from the truth. 
They know pit bulls as they truly are — affec-
tionate, playful, loving and loyal.
They also know that pit bulls used to be consid-
ered not only one of the most popular family dogs 
in the nation, but especially compatible with chil-dren. 
Just Google “nanny dog” and you’ll ﬁ  nd images 
of smiling pit bulls with their tiny human compan-
ions.
But for others, who have never interacted with a 
pit bull or have been too afraid to go near one, pit 
bulls are viewed as monsters that need to be dealt with.
These fear-driven stereotypes inspire support 
for harmful policies and inadvertently contribute to a cycle of pit bull abuse.
In the past 30 years, more than 700 communi-
ties have enacted pit bull bans and other restrictive regulations on pit bull ownership. 
These laws, known as breed-speciﬁ  c legislation, 
may force shelters to automatically euthanize pit 
bulls, require landlords to turn away families with 
pit bulls and even make pit bull owners purchase liability insurance.
Not only do these laws result in extraordinarily 
high pit bull euthanasia rates, an increase in pit bull 
homelessness and overcrowded shelters, but they 
also rely on several fundamentally incorrect as-sumptions.This legislation mistakenly promotes 
the claim that pit bulls are a speciﬁ  c breed of dog.
While certain breeds such as the 
American Staffordshire Terrier and the American Pit Bull Terrier are commonly categorized as pit bulls, the term also 
encompasses dogs with certain physical 
traits.
Under breed-speciﬁ  c legislation, any 
dog with a bulky body, square-shaped head and short coat could be classiﬁ  ed 
as a pit bull and subject to being banned.
Breed-speciﬁ  c legislation also endorses negative 
stigmas about pit bulls that have been consistently disproven by research.
Studies by the American Veterinary Medicine 
Association have shown that pit bulls are not more aggressive compared to other types of dogs.
Additionally, the American Temperament Test 
Society, which evaluates various breeds of dogs to 
test their disposition, consistently gives the Ameri-
can Pit Bull Terrier an above-average score. These results indicate that pit bulls are not aggressive and are especially tolerant. 
Despite the evidence, pit bulls continue to be 
maligned in the media and feared by the public.
This fear and criticism, combined with city-wide 
legislation, creates a self-fulﬁ  lling prophecy in which pit bulls are viewed as more valuable in the 
eyes of irresponsible and cruel owners who want a 
status symbol for power.
Pit bulls are too often horriﬁ  cally mistreated, ac-
counting for the majority of dogs forced into illegal 
dog ﬁ  ghting rings since the 1980s. 
Many people believe that criminals choose pit 
bulls to ﬁ  ght in their rings because the dogs are in-
herently aggressive, but pit bulls are chosen for the opposite reasons: Just like the dogs mentioned in 
the beginning of this column, pit bulls are ﬁ  ercely 
loyal to their owners and especially docile to hu-mans. 
Thankfully, according to USA Today, more than 
100 cities across the nation have started overturning pit bull bans and restrictive legislation.
This is an important step for pit bulls and their 
advocates, and it at least makes the world a little kinder for these stigmatized animals who only want 
to be loved.
Hopefully, as these strides continue, more pit 
bulls will be given the opportunity to em-“bark” on 
their journey for a second chance.

opinions@alligator.org I am an atheist. Admitted-
ly, I don’t know exactly what that means. De-
pending on who you talk to, it could mean a lot of things. 
To some, it means that I 
am amoral at best and I live 
a life of ultimate insigniﬁ  -
cance.
In a 2012 appearance on 
“The Colbert Report,” for-mer chairman of the Texas 
State Board of Education 
Don McLeroy, on the subject of atheists, placed a rock on a table and said, “Nothing is 
what a sleeping rock dreams 
of.” 
So, if you ask McLeroy, 
maybe I, as an atheist, share the philosophy and world-
view of a rock.
Fortunately for me, I am 
not a rock. And, contrary to 
what I hope is not a popular 
opinion, I do not believe in 
“nothing.” In fact, I believe in many things: I believe in the U.S. Constitution. I be-lieve if you give a person a 
chance, they can surprise 
you in some truly extraordi-nary ways.
 I believe the Dallas Cow-
boys will continue to disap-point me so long as Jerry 
Jones operates as general 
manager — that is, until I have evidence to the con-trary.
I also believe in treating 
your neighbor as you would have them treat you. I believe murder is wrong. I believe in being charitable and giving 
back to those who have not 
been as fortunate as I have been. I believe that what I be-lieve is not wholly dissimilar 
to the beliefs of anyone else 
in our country or state.
And yet that different 
term, “atheism,” has been synonymous with notions of 
deviance, anarchy and mal-
ice, connotations that may very well be applicable to 
some atheists (not to men-
tion some religiously orient-ed people), but not to most.
In this day and age, athe-
ists, agnostics and those who don’t afﬁ  liate themselves with a religion come in all shapes and sizes — the ag-nostic grocer at the local gro-
cery store, your religiously 
unafﬁ  liated dentist, the athe-ist veteran who served two tours in Iraq — but there is 
an apparent stigma against these people that they are 
somehow less ﬁ  t to be pro-
ductive members of a com-
munity than those who are “normal” and “religious.”
According to a recent poll 
conducted by the Pew Re-search Center, “religiously unafﬁ  liated” is the largest-growing “religious belief” in the country, yet being an 
atheist is one of the most det-
rimental qualities one could possess in seeking elected ofﬁ  ce, even more detrimen-
tal than being involved in an 
extramarital affair. 
It is not unreasonable to 
conclude the U.S. as a whole is wary of, if not hostile to-
ward, atheists.
There was once a period 
of American history when 
being an atheist was essen-
tially synonymous with be-
ing a Communist.
In fact, it was during the 
era of the Red Scare, in 1956 
to be precise, that the U.S. changed its ofﬁ  cial motto 
from “E Pluribus Unum” — 
meaning, “out of many, one” — to “In God We Trust.”
Today, it seems much of 
that sentiment against athe-
ism is still intact, which is 
truly sad because I, along with many others, am living proof that one can simulta-
neously be proud to be an 
American and also proud to be an atheist.
Yet politicians like McLe-
roy — not to mention the fact 
that some states have laws 
on the books disallowing people from holding public ofﬁ  ce without believing in a 
“supreme being” — make it 
hard for many atheists to stay engaged with the political process, which only perpetu-ates the belief that atheists don’t care about anything. 
Whether we like it or not, 
we live in a constantly chang-ing America, and the sooner we accept and tolerate oth-ers for their differences, the 
sooner we will ﬁ  nd how our 
differences only make us stronger. 
E Pluribus Unum.

A new Florida initiative is work-
ing to increase the number of minor-
ity students participating in cancer research.
The Florida Minority Cancer Re-
search and Training Center will sup-port minority students by provid-ing cancer research and training for African-Americans.
Started in September, the pro-
gram is funded by a $1.3 million award from the National Cancer In-stitute in addition to $320,000 from the UF Health Cancer Center. The 
program is staffed with scientists 
from UF and Florida A&M Univer-sity to provide mentoring and train-ing for minority students.
Every year, for the next four years, 
five underrepresented minority stu-dents from UF and FAMU will get a chance to spend the summer in 
the lab of their assigned mentor at UF, Folakemi Odedina wrote in an email.
Odedina is a 
professor of phar-
maceutical out-
comes at UF’s College of Pharmacy 
and the UF Health Cancer Center associate director for cancer dispari-ties.
Odedina said the goal of the pro-
gram is to involve minority students in cancer research.
“This is important because mi-
norities in general, but particularly in Florida, continue to experience disparities in all phases of the cancer control continuum, including pre-vention, early detection, diagnosis, treatment, survivorship, and end of life,” she wrote.
Through the program, student 
researchers will experience hands-on research and access to mentors and career development guidance.
With the growing number of mi-
nority cancer patients, it has become important to develop an ethnically diverse group of well-trained sci-
entists focused on cancer research, 
Odedina said.
“Minorities are underrepresent-
ed in basic, clinical, and behavioral research, which greatly contributes to the slow progress in eliminating cancer disparities and to the lack of minority populations in clinical tri-als,” she wrote.
Scott Szymanski, the 21-year-old 
president of UF’s Premed Ameri-can Medical Student Association, said it’s important for minorities to gain research experience, especially when applying for medical school.

◗ IT’S CALLED PAWSI-
TIVELY CURING CANCER.
ALEXIA FERNANDEZ
Alligator Staff Writer
afernandez@alligator.org
Two young boys decided 
if their grandmother could 
survive cancer, then their pets could too.
Josh and Bryce Benbasat, 
the sons of two UF alumni, 
launched PAWSitively Curing 
Cancer, a new partner of the UF College of Veterinary Medicine 
to provide funding for pet can-
cer research.
Josh, a 15-year-old West-
ern High School sophomore 
in Davie, Florida, created the 
nonprofit with his 12-year-old 
brother Bryce after their dog, 
Sashi, was diagnosed with can-cer.
“She died of intestinal can-
cer,” Josh said. “My grandma 
also had lung and breast can-
cer, but she survived it.”
After doing some research, 
the Benbasat brothers realized 
there weren’t many founda-
tions dedicated to researching 
pet cancer.
They decided to create one 
of their own.
“I was super proud,” Dena 
Benbasat, the boys’ mother, said. “I knew it would come to fruition, and we all got really excited about it.”
Her husband, Steve, took 
the reins, she said. He applied for permission to launch a tax exempt nonprofit organization, contacted the university’s vet-erinary college and made the connections necessary to part-ner the college with the founda-tion.
“When our sons came up 
with the idea, we naturally went to UF,” Dena said. “We 
wanted the donations to go to 
a place we felt would have a good chance of finding a cure.”
The boys’ grandfather is also 
helping the cause by donating recovery collars that Trimline Manufacturing creates.
The collars provide a bar-
rier from licking, scratching and biting treatment areas on pets. They’re given directly to veterinarians and a portion of the proceeds will go toward PAWSitively Curing Cancer.
The recovery collars are 
made in the U.S. in six sizes, meant to fit all dogs and cats. According to a press release, they are soft collars, water re-pellant and machine washable. The collar trim is pink to repre-sent cancer awareness.
Josh and Bryce plan on at-
tending veterinary conventions where they hope to find corpo-rate sponsors.
Dena said Josh plans to start 
a club at his school.
“They’ll have the opportu-
nity to host events and fund-raise,” she said.
Malique Pye, a 23-year-old 
Sante Fe art education junior, works with dogs at PetSmart and said he’s happy to hear about a new foundation to help cure pet cancer.
“I work with these dogs ev-
ery day, and it’s hard to think of them at the mercy of something that vets can’t cure,” he said. “I think if there’s something on campus that can further re-search toward finding a cure, it’ll go a long way.”Nonprofit to fund pet

DENVER — That’s not mistle-
toe.
From new marijuana strains for 
the holidays to gift sets and pot-
and-pumpkin pies, the burgeoning 
marijuana industry in Colorado is 
scrambling to get a piece of the holi-day shopping dollar. Dispensaries in many states have been offering holiday specials for medical custom-ers for years — but this ﬁ  rst season of open-to-all-adults marijuana sales in some states means pot shops are using more of the tricks used by tra-
ditional retailers to attract holiday 
shoppers.
Here’s a look at how the new rec-
reational marijuana industry is try-ing to attract holiday shoppers:
OLD-FASHIONED DOOR-
BUSTERS
Traditional retailers sell some 
items below cost to drive trafﬁ  c and 
attract sales. Recreational marijuana 
retailers are doing the same.
The Grass Station in Denver is 
selling an ounce of marijuana for $50 — about a ﬁ  fth of the cost of the next-cheapest strain at the Colorado dispensary — to the ﬁ  rst 16 custom-ers in line Friday, Saturday and Sun-day. That works out to less than $1 
a joint for the ambitious early-rising 
pot shopper. Owner Ryan Fox said his Black Friday pot is decent quality, and he’s selling below cost to attract attention and pick up some new cus-tomers. As Colorado dispensaries approach a year of being able to sell weed to all adults over 21, not just card-carrying medical patients, Fox said retailers have to do more than just sell pot to get public attention.
GIFT CARDSFor the shopper who wants to 
give pot but doesn’t know how the 
recipient likes to get high, Colorado’s 
300 or so recreational dispensaries so far have been able to issue only handwritten gift certiﬁ  cates. That’s because banking regulations prohib-it major credit card companies from being able to back marijuana-related gift cards the way they do for other retailers.
Just this month, a Colorado com-
pany started offering pot shops a branded gift card they can sell just 
like other retailers. The cards are in 
eight Denver dispensaries so far, and coming soon will be loyalty cards similar to grocery store loyalty cards that track purchases and can be used to suggest sales or new products to frequent shoppers.
CANNAGIFTS FOR MAILJust because marijuana can’t le-
gally leave Colorado doesn’t mean dispensaries don’t have items for out-of-state friends and family. Some dispensaries are highlighting some non-cannabis gift items — things like T-shirts, rolling papers and lo-tions made with legal herbs. The sets are for shoppers who want to give a taste of Colorado’s new marijuana 
industry without breaking federal 
law by mailing it or taking it out of state.

Merry marijuana: Pot sellers proﬁ  t
Nov. 26, 1980
With students going home to celebrate Thanksgiving 
with their families, local restaurants popular among stu-
dents were concerned with how it could affect business. 
Wuv’s, located in Gator Plaza, received 94 percent of its earnings from students. However, business was expected to pick up on Saturday due to the football game against 
the University of Miami. Unaffected by the lack of people 
in Gainesville, Brown Derby manager Ron Maher said students only make up a quarter of his customers. Some of the restaurant’s best months have been in the summer when students aren’t typically in town. 
Nov. 24, 1997The heated FSU-Florida game that is typically played 
Thanksgiving weekend came a week early. The Gators 
celebrated a 32-29 win against previously unbeaten 
Seminoles. Amid the excitement, a Gator football player smashed his helmet into pieces on the ﬁ  eld, a UF student was pummeled by police ofﬁ  cers for attempting to bring down the goalposts and trafﬁ  c on West University Av-
enue came to a standstill from fans blocking the road. 
Tailback Fred Taylor made the game-winning touch-down with one minute and 50 seconds left on the clock. Because of that play, Florida deterred FSU’s opportunity 
to play for a national title in the Orange Bowl. 
Nov. 26, 2002
A local charitable organization couldn’t distribute 
Thanksgiving dinners to needy families because of a 
lack of funds. The Children’s Table in Bronson, 20 miles

For Will Muschamp, his time is almost 
up.
In just four days, his time as Florida’s 
head football coach will be over.
But Muschamp’s mindset isn’t focused 
on that just yet.
UF (6-4, 4-4 Southeastern Conference) 
heads to Tallahassee to face No. 3 FSU (11-
0, 8-0 Atlantic Coast Conference) on Satur-day.
That’s all Muschamp cares about at this 
point.
And that’s all he wants his players to 
focus on as well.
“Just play the game,” Muschamp said. 
“Talking’s not going to help you make a 
play, that’s for sure. There will be high 
emotions. They need to manage that. They can’t let it overtake them, especially early in the game getting very emotional.”
But for the players, the ones who have 
been coached under Muschamp for the last four years, they want to send their coach out on a high note.
“Let’s go get a W. That’s the outlook,” 
linebacker Mike Taylor said. “Every time you are going to play a team, no matter who you’re playing … we’re going to look to go get a victory. We know what we can do and what we have to make possible this 
week.”
For Taylor, Nov. 24, 2012, is still fresh 
on his mind.
It was the last time Florida traveled to 
Doak Campbell Stadium.
It was the last time the Gators defeat-
ed the Seminoles — a 37-26 road win in a 
game that pitted two top-10 teams against each other.
And it was the last time FSU lost a game 
— a span of 27 contests.Taylor, who had limited playing time in 
that contest two years ago, remembers the night well, down to Florida’s uniforms — its white top, orange bottom combination.
“So let’s go do it again,” Taylor said.Florida State may have a 27-game win streak, but the Seminoles have been any-thing but dominant in 2014, at least from a relative perspective.
In the first 16 games of the win streak 
— from defeating Georgia Tech in the 2012 ACC Championship to winning the 2013 national title against Auburn — Florida 
State had an average margin of victory of 
36.25 points. Just two of those 16 games were decided by six points or fewer.
Fast forward to the 2014 season, and the 
UF travels to Tallahassee in hopes to end FSU’s win streak

With two veteran players sidelined with injuries, Florida 
basketball is taking things one game at a time. 
The next game on the No. 18 Gators’ (2-1) horizon is 
against Georgetown (3-0) on Wednesday, the first of three in 
the Bahamas as part of the Battle 4 Atlantis. 
“I think there’s been a real focus, at least in home games 
for our fans, to have some really good non-conference qual-
ity games, and to try and play a national schedule. The last 
two years, there’s been a real strong feeling from inside the league, the commissioner and during our meetings, to boast non-conference scheduling,” Florida coach Billy Donovan said. “Before Dec. 1, we’re going to know a lot about our team. Of course, we’ve had to deal with some injuries and some suspensions, but I still think we’re finding out things about our team, which is good.”
The team traveled to Paradise Island on Monday and 
Donovan confirmed earlier in the day that both Eli Carter and Dorian Finney-Smith traveled with the team, although Donovan is unsure if either will see any playing time dur-ing the trip as they continue to nurse injuries. Donovan said 
both are not currently cleared to practice, meaning they sat 
out during the Gators’ five practices over the weekend, with three practices coming on Saturday. 
Instead, they have been doing individual workouts. Finney-Smith, who has only played in two of Florida’s 
four games so far this season, injured two fingers in his left hand early in Florida’s win against William & Mary on Nov. 14. 
“I think Dorian’s hand does feel better,” Donovan said. 
“He still has pain. I think a lot of it’s going to come down to, you know, where is he at in terms of what he can actually tolerate. I think it’s very, very difficult right now for him to catch, to dribble. … So where does he get to a point where he feels like the pain is manageable? Because he’s going to Florida to Battle 4 Atlantis on Paradise Island, BahamasKan li / alligator Staff

To the left and slightly above 
Mary Wise’s head, Kelly Murphy 
winds back her left arm, prepar-ing to slam a ball across the net.
To the right, Chloe Mann’s 
full attention is on the block she’s about to make.
Behind her, Taylor Brauneis 
sets a ball. Next is Kristy Jaeckel, her fists pumping, her face the epitome of joy as she screams in celebration.
They hang as posters on the 
walls of the Gale Lemerand gym, 
each portrait a permanent hom-
age to the former Gator it de-picts.
Without turning around, Wise 
pointed to the image of Murphy behind her and made a severe understatement.
“We’ve been very lucky,” she 
said.
Her luck hasn’t run out.

In terms of inches, she’s the 
tallest signee in Florida volley-ball history.
But in terms of her voice, she’s 
rather small.
When 6-foot-4 freshman 
Rhamat Alhassan meets with 
reporters after a match, she’s 
humble, though she doesn’t have much reason to be.
Nearing the end of her first 
season of collegiate volleyball, Alhassan leads the Southeastern Conference and is ranked second in the nation in hitting percent-age (.468). 
She also became the first 
freshman since 2012 to be named AVCA National Volleyball Player 
of the Week.
With her accolades and league-
leading statistics, it’s easy to for-
get Florida’s promising young talent is only in her third year playing the sport.
Wise converted Alhassan 
from a shot-blocker on her high school’s basketball team to a mid-
dle blocker for one of the NCAA’s 
top volleyball programs.
“I was burnt out on it,” she 
said of her short-lived basketball career.
During the recruiting process, 
it was hard for Wise to judge ex-actly where Alhassan’s ceiling was only because there were so few opportunities to scout her.
“When the rest of her (club) 
team was practicing, she was at a basketball tournament,” UF vol-leyball coach Mary Wise said. “So she didn’t even touch a volleyball 
and then she shows up there on a 
weekend and plays.”
But for Wise, Alhassan’s up-
sides were obvious: a rare, ath-letic talent with a strong desire to learn.
Still, there were questions. 
Could Alhassan’s eagerness to learn translate into success on 
the court? How quickly could she 
adjust to the speed of the college game?
A week into the season, Wise 
had her answers.
While reviewing video of an early season practice, Florida’s video coordinator caught Alhas-san leaping chest high above the 7-foot tall net.
“There are so few women in 
the country who can make that 
play,” Wise said. “You could ar-
gue there aren’t that many in the world.”
There’s optimism from her 
coaches that Alhassan could de-velop into one of the nation’s most dominant players before her time at UF is over.
“My guess is there will be a lot 
of people that will be able to say with great enthusiasm that they were in school when Rhamat was here,” Wise said.
UF setter Mackenzie Dagos-
tino agrees.
“Rhamat’s been awesome. 
Coming in as a freshman and having to work with an offense 
she’s never seen before, a fast 
offense,” Dagostino said. “She’s doing a great job. She’s making herself relevant and being there for us.”
Indeed, it seems as if Alhassan 
is always there — at the net and in the air during matches and oc-cupying the topic of conversation 
in press conferences afterwards.
“It never gets old,” Wise said.
Good. She’s got three more 
years.

It was the first round of the 
2012 Maryland State Volleyball Playoffs, and Alex Holston was still on the court.
She was a senior right-side 
hitter at Olney (Md.) Sherwood High, but one glance at her stat line would suggest otherwise.
42 kills, 22 service aces, and 
four sets played.
Her team would win that 
night. 
Four days later, they would 
win it all.That year, Holston was one of 
the most sought after recruits in 
the nation.
Her options included Texas, 
UNC, Kentucky, LSU, Miami and 
42 others. They all came knock-ing.
“But Florida had always been 
my top school,” she said.
The feeling was mutual.Holston had just won three 
straight state championships, re-corded a 71-8 high school record and was named the Maryland Gatorade Player of the Year for the second consecutive year.
As a freshman at Florida, Wise 
set the expectations high.
Holston admitted that she 
struggled with nerves during her first season. 
From time to time, she still 
does today.
“I know when I first start off, 
I’m always nervous,” she said. “How are people going to think I 
play? How are people going to, I guess, judge my play?”
With time, she learned to re-
lax. And then, she said, every-
thing clicked.
“Once I get more comfortable, 
I don’t think twice about making a play,” Holston said.
She finished her first season 
by earning a spot on the All-SEC team and was named an honor-able mention All-American.
As a sophomore, the expecta-
tions were even higher.
Holston is currently fourth in 
the SEC in points per set at 4.24 and fifth in kills per set at 3.51.
“I like the pressure,” Holston 
said. 
“It’s a big change and a big re-
sponsibility… but it’s something that I like to live up to.”
At times, she can single hand-
edly carry Florida offensively, as she’s done in several matches this season.
But after being recruited by 
nearly 50 universities, what drew Holston to Florida?
“It was the coaching,” she 
said. “They take good care of you here.”

In her bright pink zip-up jack-
et, Mary Wise stepped up to the lectern a week before her team would face then-No. 6 USC.
Her next win would be a mile-
stone — the 800th of her career.
“That’s a lot of warm ups,” 
Wise said.
Twenty-four years of them.Although Wise doesn’t keep 
track of her wins, she does keep track of the players she’s re-
cruited throughout her time at 
Florida.
“My favorite (part) of this job 
beyond the wins, which are pret-ty fun, is the relationships that I’m able to develop with the play-ers and sustain long after they’re done,” Wise said. 
Many of her players, the same 
ones featured on the walls of the Lemerand Gym, came to Florida’s match at USC to celebrate the his-toric win.
Karli Klinkenborg, Kim Hale, 
Tangerine Wiggs and Murphy were there. 
Even former All-American set-
ter Heidi Anderson’s dad was in the stands. Anderson graduated in 1992.
“We’ve (said) that it is more 
than a four-year decision,” Wise said. 
“Why was the USC match so 
special? It’s because those players were in the gym and being able to be a part of their families.”
Wise’s recruiting is a process, 
one that takes young, skilled players and maximizes their po-
tential. 
Wise’s next projects are Alhas-
san and Holston.
“I think the college age has 
such growth, to see the young 
girls that we start recruiting — they’re 14 when we start recruit-ing them — and the woman they become when they graduate,” 
Wise said. 
“To see that growth period and 
to be a part of their lives during 
that time, that’s pretty special.”14, ALLIGATOR � TUESDAY, NOVEMBER 25, 2014

After opening the season with 
two wins at home, Florida (2-1) lost its first game of the season on Friday, a 72-66 loss to St. John’s. The team looks to get back to its early winning ways when it takes on Charleston Southern (2-1) tonight at 7 in the O’Connell Center.
Coach Amanda Butler has been 
studying the team’s play throughout the early going, assessing where the team needs to improve as the season progresses.
A week removed from stating 
the team needs to improve the slow starts that have slowed the team’s growth, Butler attributed the team’s most recent slow start against St. John’s to the Red Storm’s defense rather than a lack of urgency from the Gators.
“St. John’s is a great team, it was 
a great challenge for us,” Butler said. “I think…a really important way for us to open our road season.
“We had a chance to really get 
after it in practice hard, make some corrections on Saturday…. and get back at it today with an emphasis on Charleston Southern.”
Sophomore Ronni Williams 
played 20 minutes against St. John’s, her fewest of the season. The Day-tona Beach native has taken her fair share of shots this season, peaking with her absence in the second half of the game on Saturday. The Gators leading scorer in its first two games, Williams has proven to be a consis-tent offensive weapon, a weapon 
the team needs to stay healthy and 
on the court.
Butler was quick to maintain the 
injuries are more likely to happen to a player like Williams because of the physical nature of her play.
“Staying healthy is a challenge,” 
Butler said. “The contact and things that go on, that’s difficult to manage. 
You have to play your game, and if 
you’re going to fall down, hit some-thing or twist something, it’s going to happen.”
After starting January Miller at 
guard for the first game against Jack-sonville, Butler has started fellow junior Antoinette Bannister in her place for the team’s last two games. 
With Miller coming off the bench, 
Butler alluded further changes may be coming if the Gators can’t correct the defensive and pacing issues that have hindered the team early in the season.
“It was two completely different 
sets of 20 minutes,” Butler said, re-ferring to the slow opening against 
St. John’s. “I think we found out that 
we have to make some changes and address some things that need to be better.”Seminoles’ margin of victory 
is just 13.3 points per con-test. 
They won five of their 11 
contests this season by six points or fewer and trailed at halftime in seven matches 
this year.
“They’ve done a really 
nice job and I think a little 
bit of being in the position they’re in, everybody is tak-
ing their shot,” Muschamp 
said. 
“And everybody comes 
out excited in the first half 
and everybody usually gives 
you a different wrinkle in those situations and they are trying to do something a lit-tle different.”
Muschamp attributes the 
Seminoles’ success, in part, to quarterback Jameis Win-ston.
The redshirt sophomore 
and 2013 Heisman winner has been FSU’s starting quar-terback since the start of the 2013 campaign. 
He has played in every 
game except for Florida State’s 23-17 overtime win against Clemson because of a 
suspension for shouting ob-
scenities in a public area on FSU’s campus.
In the last two years, 
Winston has amassed 7,182 
passing yards, 59 passing 
touchdowns and just 23 in-terceptions.
In the last five games, Win-
ston has led the Seminoles to four second-half comebacks.
“With (Winston) on the 
field you’ve got to stay ag-gressive,” Muschamp said. “There are situations in how you possibly could end the 
game. 
“You’ve got to go try and 
win the game when he is on 
the field. That’s the bottom 
line.”
The Gators know they 
need to execute early and 
consistently if they want a chance at pulling off the up-
set.
“You want to get momen-
tum going against a good 
team like that right away,” 
said junior defensive line-
man Jon Bullard. 
“You can’t start slow. You 
can’t end slow like we do sometimes. We have to put it 
all together and play 60 min-
utes.”
And Bullard, who is sec-
ond on Florida’s roster with 
11 quarterback hurries, said 
he is confident the Gators and their 11th-ranked de-fense will bring the pressure to Winston. 
“He’s going to see a pretty 
good defense Saturday,” Bul-lard said.
Added Taylor: “We know 
we have to go out there and execute next week and try to ruin whatever little Cinder-ella thing they want to do. Or Shrek, whatever it is.”TUESDAY, NOVEMBER 25, 2014 � ALLIGATOR, 15
Carter still has an injured foot
be playing with pain for some significant 
time, that’s definitely going to happen. Now how long it takes for him to be to-
tally pain-free I don’t know.” 
Donovan said he expects Finney-Smith 
to continue sporting a brace on his hand 
for a few more weeks. Carter, who has a 
mid-foot sprain in his left foot, has been 
conditioning on the bike and elliptical machines. Since Florida doesn’t take the court until Wednesday, Donovan said he will have a better gauge as to whether 
Carter or Finney-Smith could return after 
practice today. 
“So some of things that happened I re-
ally can’t fault them at all, I think it’s more 
of we kind of got some things exposed 
with that team in that game,” Donovan said of Friday’s performance. “And now I think it’s my job to help them adapt to those changes and what teams are doing against them, and then hopefully we can get a little bit more cohesive and consis-tent.”
Donovan isn’t looking ahead to possi-
bly facing the nation’s No. 2 team, Wis-consin, on Thursday. Though he said he’s concerned with how Florida’s press style 
of play will stand up to three games in 
three days, Donovan is keeping his and his team’s focus off the holiday and off the Hoyas on Wednesday, 
“Really, really good team. They’ve got 
a lot of things on offense that they can do. They can drive it, they can get to the free-throw line, they can throw the ball inside to two frontcourt players. They’re really 
good in transition,” Donovan said, refer-
ring to Georgetown. “ You know, John’s system is always difficult to go against. They can do a variety of different things defensively, so this will be a great test for 
us.”hoops , from page 13

The Gators are one win 
away from the Final Four.
Florida overcame its most 
grueling weekend of the year, 
defeating California and No. 3-seed Texas Tech to advance to the Elite Eight of the NCAA 
Tournament in two physical-
ly and emotionally draining matches.
The team now has a week 
to recuperate before facing 
No. 1-seed Stanford on Fri-
day night, and coach Becky Burleigh said the rest will be essential for the players this 
week.
“We have to make sure we 
take care of our bodies,” she 
said. 
“But I think part of that too 
is you’re being able to mental-ly refresh too — I mean, that was an intense weekend.”
This is the furthest Florida 
has advanced in the NCAA Tournament since making the Elite Eight in 2003, losing 2-1 at home to Florida State.
The last time the Gators 
made the Final Four was 2001, when they lost 3-2 in overtime to Santa Clara.
But Burleigh isn’t focused 
on how big the win would be for the program.
She’s just focused on get-
ting the team to improve ev-ery day.
“I don’t really look at this 
as the magnitude of such a big game,” Burleigh said. “I think 
it’s part of this team’s journey 
as far as looking back at Sun-day’s game, Friday’s game, last Sunday’s game, and see-
ing where we can continue to 
get better.
“And I think when you start looking at it as a really 
big game is probably when 
you put yourself under more pressure than you need to.”
Putting extra pressure on 
themselves is the last thing the Gators need to do leading into Friday’s game — the Cardinal will be looking to give them all the pressure the team can 
handle and more.
Florida and Stanford faced 
off once already this season 
on Sept. 12, when the Cardinal 
shut out Florida’s offense in a 
1-0 overtime loss in Palo Alto, California.
Stanford has only one loss 
this season, which came at the 
hands of No. 1 seed UCLA on 
the road, but Burleigh said the Gators have improved since the teams last met in Septem-
ber.
“I can’t really speak for 
Stanford, but I know for us, 
we have grown so much since 
the last time we played,” Bur-leigh said. 
“It was a long time ago, 
and we’ve had so many expe-
riences since then, and I think a lot of those experiences are 
what have prepared to get to this point.”
Burleigh said making the 
trip to Palo Alto earlier in the season will make it easier to play there the second time around.
The winner of Friday 
night’s contest will advance and play in Boca Raton for the Final Four on Dec. 5.
And, of course, the loser 
will go home.16, ALLIGATOR � TUESDAY, NOVEMBER 25, 2014
