Some leafy greens at Publix may 
put more than a bad taste in your 
mouth.
Publix Super Markets issued 
a voluntary recall Thursday for 10-ounce plastic bags of Publix 
Hearts of Romaine after the U.S. Food and Drug Administration alerted the company that samples of the product contained Listeria monocytogenes, a known pathogen.
Alachua County was listed by a 
FDA press release as one of the af-fected areas, and local stores have 
since removed the bags from their 
shelves.
Soohyoun Ahn, an assistant 
professor of food safety with UF’s Department of Food Science and Human Nutrition, said Listeria monocytogenes is less common to 
ﬁ  nd in food than the salmonella and 
Campylobacter viruses but can be more dangerous.
“There’s something scary about 
Listeria that’s different than other pathogens,” Ahn said.
She said the people who are most at risk are pregnant women, who 
can have miscarriages and stillbirths 
as a result of ingesting Listeria.
“If you’re healthy with a strong 
immune system, the symptoms aren’t that obvious,” Ahn said. “If you’re in a high-risk group, which 
includes children, the elderly and 
pregnant women, it can be very dangerous. That’s what’s scary 
about it.”
While healthy people may not 
experience drastic side effects, they could suffer from ﬂ  u-like symptoms such as fever, headaches, nausea, abdominal pain and diarrhea.
Another factor that sets Listeria 
apart from other foodborne patho-gens is its ability to grow in inhospi-
table environments.
“If you refrigerate most of these 
pathogens, they will stop growing even though they’re there,” Ahn said. “But in the case of Listeria, it 
can still grow in refrigerated tem-
peratures.”Publix’s recalled romaine lettuce could cause nausea, fever

The happiest place on earth has 
joined the political frenzy, and 
despite being two hours away, Gainesville residents are forming divided opinions in response.
About a month out from Elec-
tion Day, contributions from The Walt Disney Co. entities to Florida candidates and committees totaled roughly $2.5 million. The sum in-cludes donations to 70 Republican candidates, 13 Democratic candi-dates, and both the Florida Dem-
ocratic and Republican parties, 
according to Florida Department of State Division of Elections cam-paign contribution reports.
A search for “Disney” in the 
campaign ﬁ  nance database’s con-tributor names for the 2012 gener-al election yielded 490 results as of press time. The giant corporation 
has already given more than four 
times what it did during the 2008 election cycle.
Jordan Sonaglia, a 21-year-old 
agricultural education and com-munication senior at UF, said Dis-
ney’s political involvement lowers 
her perception of the corporation’s integrity.
“I think of Disney as innocent 
– little kids are going there with their families,” she said. “Big in-dustries or companies like this need to have a neutral perspective on politics.”

tor of UF’s Eric Friedheim Tourism Institute, said Disney’s political

UF students and alumni 
will have the chance to form 
connections with hundreds 
of employers at the Stephen 
C. O’Connell Center today and Wednesday.
The Career Resource 
Center will host the Fall Ca-reer Showcase from 9 a.m. to 3 p.m. About 7,000 students total are expected to attend, said CRC Director Heather 
White.
Tuesday is directed at 
candidates interested in 
nontechnical ﬁ  elds such as communications, accounting and health care, said Dana 
McPherson, assistant direc-
tor for marketing and com-munications of the CRC.
Wednesday is the techni-
cal day, and employers will look for candidates with backgrounds in ﬁ  elds such as computer science, con-struction and engineering.
Candidates can stop by 
at any time, and no previous registration is required, but a Gator 1 Card is required 
for entrance.
Jaclyn Simek, a 20-year-old marketing junior, said 
she plans to talk to about 15 different companies.
She said it’s easier for 
some students to attend the career fair than to search on-line for opportunities.
“All your resources are 
just laid out for you,” Simek 
said. “It’s easier to ask ques-
tions be-
cause [al-
t h o u g h ] you can read the internship 
descriptions online, unless you actually talk to someone, you can’t really have a great idea of what you would be 
doing.”
McPherson said she sug-
gests that candidates take a 
look at companies they’re interested in beforehand and 
bring the appropriate num-
ber of resumes.
“Starting early increases 
the likelihood and opportu-
nity of ﬁ  nding those mean-
ingful connections that are mutually beneﬁ  cial,” White said.Career Showcase

The hype of Apple’s release 
of the iPhone 5 and iOS 6 soft-
ware has died down since Ap-ple users discovered technical issues with the latest version of 
Apple’s Maps, which replaced 
Google Maps in the software update.
Users found that the new 
Maps application is missing whole cities, duplicating loca-tions and using incorrect land-mark icons. Apple CEO Tim Cook publicly apologized in an 
open letter on the company’s 
website, recognizing the appli-cation’s kinks.
Chris Dyal, 25-year-old UF 
Computing Help Desk em-ployee, said he hasn’t had any issues with Maps when looking up Gainesville on his iPhone 5. However, he said campus roads 
aren’t as accurate as they were 
with Google Maps.
“It was rolled out way too 
early,” Dyal said.
Despite the kinks, he said he 
doesn’t think the faulty Maps application will affect iPhone 5 sales.
Political science and theater 
freshman Lauren Killer, 18, said she updated her iPhone 4 to the iOS 6 software the week it was released.
Out of all the updates, she 
said she is disappointed with 
the new Maps. Killer said the 
new Maps doesn’t have out-lines or labels for UF campus buildings.She said the malfunction 
wouldn’t have happened un-
der the late Apple CEO Steve 
Jobs’ watch.
“I think Steve Jobs is turning 
in his grave,” Killer said.
Killer said she uses the Maps 
application to track campus buses. She said if the software update took place earlier in the school year, she would have 
trouble finding her way around 
UF.
RTS has a partnership with 
TransLoc, a real-time transpor -
tation information provider, said RTS spokesman Chip Skinner.
Skinner said TransLoc is 
Windows-based, so RTS hasn’t had complaints about Apple Maps and its public transporta-tion directions. TransLoc cur -
rently uses Google Maps as its navigational platform.
Killer said she hasn’t had any 
issues with finding RTS buses on her iPhone, but she typically 
uses the TransLoc app.
Killer, who plans to buy the 
iPhone 5 in December, said the 
Maps update has not led her to rethink her purchase or doubt the company . However, she told family and friends not to update their iPhones’ software.
“It’s just not OK as is,” Killer 
said.iPhone users not OK

A 22-year-old man opened fire at 
a car, then turned the gun on him-
self outside a downtown Gainesville nightclub late Sunday night.
At about 11:40 p.m., Gainesville 
Police officers responded to several calls about gunfire near the Simon’s Nightclub & Entertainment on South Main Street, GPD spokesman Ben Tobias said.
One of the callers said the gun-
man, whose name was not released by police, had shot himself.
Witnesses told Officer Anton Lip-
ski the man shot at a black Nissan Altima, which was headed south.
Police found the man lying in the 
street with a gunshot wound to his 
head. A Glock handgun lay next to 
him and bullet casings were scat-tered around his body.
GPD officers gave the man, who 
was still alive, first aid until an am-bulance took him to Shands at UF.Tobias said officers later found 
the car, which had three bullet holes on the hood and on the passenger’s side fender. Police dogs tracked the car from Southwest Second Street 
back to the original crime scene.
Three witnesses inside the car 
told police the man walked out onto 
the street and started shooting at them, Tobias said.
The man died from his wound 
early Monday morning at the hospi-tal, Tobias said.

found, Publix has pulled all bags of the 
company’s Hearts of Romaine items with 
the UPC code 41415 03886, which can be found on the back right-hand corner of the

Dwaine Stevens, a spokesman for Pub-

“We have a very fluid and reliable sys-
tem in place to assure food is safe for our customers and their families,” Stevens said.
Ahn agreed.“Publix is one of the grocery store chains 
that’s very careful about food safety,” she 
said. “But things like this happen with any 
chain or brand.”
She said it’s always 
important to make sure

The beating of African drums sounded 
across UF’s North Lawn as Agbedidi, an Af-
rican dance group, performed a flash mob  at about noon Monday.
A few hours later, with the sun beating 
down and thunder rumbling in the distance, two dancers from the UF School of Theatre + Dance walked arm in arm onto the North Lawn and proceeded to perform a piece that lasted more than 10 minutes.
These were among roughly a dozen “ran-
dom acts of culture” that happened across campus on Monday. The acts included a ce-ramics sale, a Capoeira dance performance 
and a flash mob by actors from the Hippo-
drome State Theatre on the Reitz Union Col-onnade, said political science sophomore Elizabeth LaRue, a marketing intern with the UF College of Fine Arts.
The college sponsored the 12-hour mara-
thon and its annual Arts and Cultural Op-portunities Fair to kick off National Arts and Humanities Month, according to a release.
Nutritional science freshman Truc Nguy-
en stopped to watch one of the flash mobs.“That’s what I like about this campus,” 
said Nguyen, 18. “You walk around, and then you see all these activities, and every-body’s not afraid to show what they are pas-sionate about.”
Dozens of organizations including the 
Digital Worlds Institute, the University Sing-ers, Theatre Strike Force, the UF Center for Arts in Medicine, Gainesville Ballet Theatre and Yopp! Inc. filled the Reitz Union Colon-nade and nearby sidewalks, offering fliers, candy , pens, buttons and sign-up sheets to students walking by.
Passersby watched, listened and learned 
about local cultural happenings.
Civil engineering freshman Devon Kisze-
nia, 18, paused to listen to a cello player from the UF Symphony Orchestra and speak with students at the table.
“It’s people’s interpretations of things 
that go deeper than words, and it’s wonder -
ful,” Kiszenia said.
Filipe Valle Costa, an actor at the Hippo-
drome, said he and his colleagues came to promote their upcoming musical ”Carrie.”
But on a personal level, Costa said he 
wanted to have a global impact.
“I’m naive enough to think that I do 
this to change people,” Costa said. “Some people think that we can’t. I think that we can change the way people speak, the way people think.”Marathon event, campus fair

Sales probably won’t be hurt
giving is neither odd nor surprising. In 
the past, she said, the company has been bold in vocalizing its discouragement of gambling expansion in Florida.
“Disney has always had a loud voice 
in the tourism market,” Semrad said.
Semrad said because Disney custom-
ers represent a very diverse population, extending political support to either side of the aisle probably won’t hurt Disney sales.
“There will be people who are knowl-
edgeable about this, and they may not agree but others will. And others won’t care,” Semrad said.
Regardless of the financial impact, 
Madison Holfeld, a 19-year-old market-ing sophomore, said she doesn’t believe celebrities or big companies should sup-port political parties or causes.
“It might sway people in a certain way because it’s in the spotlight,” she said. “I feel it’s slightly unethical.”
Thomas Harrington, a Santa Fe Col-
lege political science professor, said Disney’s political interests stem from the inseparable linkage between politics and tourism in Florida.
Because Florida is one of the only 
states without a state income tax, he 
said, state government relies heavily on 
the tourism industry for revenue from sales tax.
Harrington said Disney’s expendi-
tures for political causes stem from self-interest.
“Everyone who does big business in 
the state of Florida wants to have their say in Tallahassee,” he said.DiSNEY , from page 1Stevens

Grooveshark has expanded its 
mobile streaming website to in-
clude all mobile devices, including 
tablets.
The announcement came after 
a series of setbacks for the music 
streaming website including being 
barred from the Apple App Store 
and a shaky existence with the Google app store. Grooveshark re-leased its mobile streaming website earlier this semester and announced 
the expansion last week.
Grooveshark was previous-
ly available on Android devices 
through direct install, but it was not 
available on any Apple products, said Sam Tarantino, CEO and co-
founder of Grooveshark.
“No company that we’ve seen 
has created a fully functioning streaming service that is complete-ly Web-based without the need to 
download an app,” said Tarantino, 
25.
Grooveshark hasn’t been able to 
develop an application for iOS soft-ware because Apple is still blocking 
it from the app store, he said. The 
Web-based streaming system was the site’s way around that.
He said the mobile site is also 
helpful to international Groove-shark users who may use less com-mon devices.
The company has been develop-
ing this method of access by devel-oping the site by using HTML5, the 
ﬁ  fth revised edition of HTML, since 
October 2011, said Nikola Arabad-jiev, a Grooveshark mobile devel-oper.
The developers have worked 
hard in getting a Queue feature and login access for those with Groove-shark accounts implemented in the Web-based system, he said.
Grooveshark’s Web-based stream-
ing is not available in the United Kingdom, France, Italy, Spain, Sin-gapore, Indonesia, Hong Kong, Brazil and Canada. Tarantino said 
Grooveshark is using this launch 
as a base to go global, making sure the technical kinks are worked out and translations are made to beneﬁ  t 
those countries before it launches to 
the rest of the world.
He said Grooveshark’s use of the 
Web browser makes accessing mu-sic even easier for those looking for 
a quick music ﬁ  x.
“Web browsers are still more 
universal than mobile apps,” said 
James Oliverio, executive director 
of the Digital Worlds Institute at UF. 
“They’re convenient for people who want to connect instantly to what they are looking for.”
Using streaming media through 
a Web browser is a good marketing tool for Grooveshark because it cuts down the amount of time needed for the user to get the music, he said.
It can take several minutes just to 
search for any given app and then download it, said Oliverio, a digital arts and sciences professor.
“Apps come with too many start-
up glitches and updates,” said Ster-ling Monroe, a 19-year-old criminol-ogy sophomore. “With Web access, Grooveshark’s music is available in-
stantly. With all the free Wi-Fi avail-
able these days, I’m set.”TUESDAY, OCTOBER 2, 2012 � ALLIGATOR, 5

ernors,” presented by the Florida Law Review, will be on 
Oct. 12 at 10 a.m. at the Phillips Center for the Performing 
Arts. 
The event will last about an hour and a half.
Gov. Reubin Askew, Gov. Charlie Crist, Gov. Bob Gra-
ham, Gov. Buddy MacKay and Gov. Bob Martinez will speak at the event.
The event will be a two-part conversation. The ﬁ  rst part will feature the governors discussing the 
issues they see with Florida such as transportation, water and judicial reform.  
The second part of the conversation will feature a ques-
tion-and-answer opportunity for audience members.
Lauren Beard, 24, coordinator of Florida Law Review’s 
2012 Allen L. Poucher Lecture Series, said the event is im-portant because the governors’ experience spans a total of 30 years, and the issues they faced are still relevant topics now.
“We hope that the audience will be inspired to do good 
things for the state after hearing the governors talk about 
the issues we are faced with,” Beard said.
Blake Murphy, a 19-year-old business administra-
tion freshman, said he plans on attending the event even 
though he is not from Florida.
“It is going to be really informational and great to hear 
from such inﬂ  uential politicians on what direction they think the state is headed in,” he said.   
Doors will open at 9:15 a.m., and the event is free and 
open to the public.Florida governors

Endorsement  
Students Party is best 
choice for students
This probably won’t come as a surprise to you, dear read-
ers. Despite how many times we’re called a “liberal, pinko, commie rag,” we’d like to endorse the Students Party.
In fact, it’s our honor to endorse them.It’s not because they’re the minority party; we don’t always 
want to endorse the minority party , but we don’t feel like we have any other option.
One day, if the system eventually does change, maybe we’ll 
consider the other side. Today is not that day.
They want to ﬁ  x the system, from the executive branch all 
the way through the Student Senate. In order to see changes, compromises or a more proper representation of the UF Student Body, a majority of seats should go to the Students Party. We’re just guessing, but it appears that the Swamp Party only repre-
sents a minority of UF students.
The Students Party will attempt a new level of transparency 
between the government and the students. If you see a broken 
sprinkler, let them know. They want us to hear about our stu-dent government outside of election season. An open dialogue and communication capability is crucial for any relationship to work, especially the one between us and our government.
People with the best ideas should be able to advance more 
than they currently are capable of doing with the way the SG 
system works. If students are timid to present their ideas or 
to even begin running for a position, those ideas will never be heard. The Students Party believes in a meritocracy: a way to let the most qualiﬁ  ed people rise to the top. This would not be based on who you know or what organizations you belong to; it would be based on the best ideas for the UF Student Body. That notion might be radically different from the SG we have right now.
As far as platforms go, the Students Party’s isn’t as hip as 
the Swamp Party’s. It is focused on ﬁ  nding solutions that are reasonable; there’s no need to invent an app when changing the lightbulbs in the blue lights on campus will do the same thing. The Students Party knows that nothing is instant, but some of its goals are deﬁ  nitely achievable. They are willing to stand up for the Student Body if a majority of people disagree with our administration, something that SGs of the past have not done.
We know this decision might seem predictable. It might even 
seem personal, but it’s not. We’re not letting past events color 
our decision this election.
Representatives from both parties came to our ofﬁ  ces to pitch 
themselves, and this is how the chips fell.
Don’t let our choice affect how you will vote; take a look at all 
of the facts ﬁ  rst, and make up your own mind.
And if you enjoyed our coverage of this election, vote “NO” 
on the referendum regarding the distribution racks on campus. 
Less opportunities to pick up our paper equal less opportunities to experience free speech.A recent New York Times article presented the results of an interesting study: It conﬁ  rmed the existence of some preconceived notions about girls, boys and 
their mental capacities in the ﬁ  eld of science.
“Science professors at American universities widely re-
gard female undergraduates as less competent than male students with the same accomplishments and skills,” stated the study conducted by Yale University researchers.
It’s deﬁ  nitely true that in some intricate areas men and 
women rationalize and behave differently; it’s just biology.
However, these differences should be positively recog-
nized rather than used as a basis for discrimination.
Men and women have always struggled to ﬁ  nd peace ac-
cepting their innate differences — especially when in pursuit 
of completing the same tasks.
I once met a female student who started school as an en-
gineering major. After a few semesters, she switched to the 
computer science program.
She said that in her engineering classes, just a handful of 
other female students were sprinkled across the lecture halls. The rest were all males.
Many of those males weren’t very encouraging, kind or 
supportive. She said the learning environment made her so 
uncomfortable, she decided to change her course of study .  
No one should ever have to give up something they’d like 
to pursue simply because of how he or she will be treated by 
peers or viewed by society.
The problems of bias run even deeper than just the issue 
of comparing men and women. People often forget about the biases that exist concerning different ﬁ  elds of study.
“So, what’s your major?” everyone asks students. Some-
times, it doesn’t matter what our answer is.
It surprises me that people are actually bold enough to 
give disapproving looks in response or question others’ per-sonal, academic and preprofessional pursuits.
Every time I visit family and friends at home, someone 
tells me I need to change my undergraduate major — ideally to a health- or science-based ﬁ  eld.
All I can do is try to explain that many sectors make the 
world go ‘round, and those are just not the ones I’ve chosen to focus on at the moment.
Don’t get me wrong, I have 
nothing but respect for those who have chosen them. STEM (sci-ence, technology , engineering and 
mathematics), health and other 
research/technical ﬁ  elds do so much for our society.
But upon taking my grand-
mother to an optometry appoint-
ment, her female doctor told me I should try to become a nurse.
She knew — and asked — nothing else about me after 
ﬁ  nding out I was a college student.
All she had to say was that I should pursue nursing.I respect nurses as well as admire them for the extensive 
patience, skill and training required to do their jobs. I was simply disappointed that this doctor wanted to know noth-ing about what I enjoyed the most and based her career ad-vice for me solely on a large stereotype.
It is true that most students want to be able to ﬁ  nd a well-
paying job postgraduation. However, it is not fair to blatantly say that having a particular degree will completely ruin or 
accomplish that for you.
You never know where you may ﬁ  nd yourself. Earning a 
degree in one ﬁ  eld may get you a job in another.
Believe it or not, there will always be competition and 
somebody better than you. It’s a combination of skills, expe-
riences, determination, personal qualities and a lot more that determine how you ﬁ  nd an opportunity.
Let’s stop comparing people and applaud them for mak-
ing positive strides in the ﬁ  rst place.
Every industry and individual in the world contributes 
something great to society.
By accepting the fact that we’re all pursuing different 
paths, we can then accept that certain paths are better for certain people; you should be free from judgment, no matter which one you choose.

Letter to the Editor
What could you buy with $13.94? You 
could buy a couple of meals at Chipotle for 
one thing, or you could buy a ticket to the 
Jacksonville State University game and still have money left over for a soda.
You could also buy one credit’s worth of 
Student Government fees.
They’re sort of like the taxes you pay to 
keep the gyms open and the buses running, among other things.
But chances are you’re not at UF for one 
credit’s worth of courses. You’re here for at least 120, unless you’re double majoring or 
going to grad school, in which case you’ll be 
buying even more.Some quick arithmetic reveals that, like it 
or not, you will fork over a grand total of at 
least $1,672 to Student Government during 
your time here.
That’s a lot of burritos.
Or maybe a fancy new scooter.
Either way, the money is definitely going 
to come out of your pocket.
But there’s a silver lining: You get to choose 
how it’s spent.
The only catch: You’ve got to vote.
Yes, I know, nobody likes the fliers and 
the banners and the T-shirts and “Have you heard about the (blank) party yet?” but all of 
that is for a reason. The people in the T-shirts want to tell you about what your money is being spent on, and they also want to get 
your input on how you’d like it to be put to 
better use.
Don’t believe me?
Go tell one of them something you’d like 
to see done; it’ll be on their Facebook page and/or website within the hour.
They’re dying to talk to you because they 
really care about Student Government for 
one reason or another, and they want you to 
care, too.
All you have to do is take a few minutes 
out of your day and listen to them. And then 
vote.Vote like crazy.Because voting matters. Because our gen-
eration has the lowest voter turnout of any demographic in the U.S., and we need prac-tice. Because people on the other side of the 
world protest by the thousands when they’re 
not given the chance to vote. And because, 
more than anything, it just makes sense.
They’re spending your money, after all. 
You ought to tell them how they can spend 
it.

I’m sure you’re all devastated about the news of the 
worldwide pork shortage.
Yes, this includes our favorite meat, bacon.
Last Thursday, Britain’s National Pig Association 
warned that the escalating numbers of shrinking herds are going to cause an “unavoidable bacon shortage.”
This “porkapocalypse” is due to the increase in cost 
of feeding these delicious animals, according to the pig industry.
If you’re still reading, let out that breath you’ve been 
holding — bacon will not be extinct as predicted.
The U.S. Department of Agriculture predicts that 
the pork production of next year will be about 23 billion pounds, only a 1.3 percent decline in America.
Worldwide, it’s predicted that the availability will 
only be a 2 to 3 percent decrease per capita. Bacon has become a fad, or obsession, for American food lovers.
In 2010, pork consumption reached an all-time high 
of 33.4 pounds per person a year, according to the De-partment of Agriculture’s Foreign Agricultural Ser -
vice.
Europe may experience a 
lack of bacon within the next few years but only a 10 per -
cent decrease at most.
Do not freak out. There will still be bacon.The bacon crisis has spun into an exaggerated epi-
demic. We can all blame the media, but let’s get serious: If there was a terrible shortage of bacon in our future, we would all want to know about it immediately.
Thankfully, this issue is not as bad as forecasted 
by the United Kingdom, but the word “unavoidable” comes across very serious and scary.
The bacon in the United Kingdom is also different 
from the bacon that Americans eat with scrambled eggs and toast. The bacon in this region is from a different part of the animal — a meat familiar to us as “Canadian bacon.”
YouTube series “EpicMealTime” will be happy to 
know that the price of bacon in Canada, however, will not be raised as high as in the U.S.
This predicted scarcity was due to a recent drought 
and rise of corn price.
This may raise the price of pork per pound within 
the next few years.
Steve Meyer, a consulting economist to the National 
Pork Board, predicts that prices will be raised at most to $3.75 per pound. This price is only 25 cents higher than present costs. If you were freaking out about the loss of bacon — I know I was — rest assured that it will only be raised by a measly quarter, a price us bacon lovers will have to pay.

Speaking OutThe release of the iPhone 5 last month marks five years 
since the launch of Apple’s smartphone back in 2007 that arguably kicked off the smartphone revolution. 
Nowadays, the iPhone faces stiff competition from Android phones, but there is still a quality that is unmatched in the 
iPhone. More than any device in recent years, the iPhone 
single-handedly provided a boost to the economy while cre-ating a smaller economy around itself.
The first and most obvious way the iPhone helps the 
economy is through its sales. Since its introduction, the dif-ferent iterations of the iPhone have sold 244 million units. Those sales numbers look to continue upward with the iP-hone 5. According to JP Morgan, it is reported to increase gross domestic product by 0.3 percent, which is significant 
considering it is a single device from one company.
However, the iPhone and a lot of other devices receive 
criticism for hurting the economy by manufacturing jobs 
overseas. It is a valid point that outsourcing hurts the Ameri-can economy, but critics often overlook the other avenues in which the iPhone creates jobs. One of these avenues is the application store. Apple’s marketplace of mobile apps and games for the smartphone grew exponentially. The company already gave out $1 billion in royalties to their app devel-
opers solely from the sales of apps. This excludes advertis-
ing or in-app purchases. Without the app store, companies like Rovio Games and success stories like Draw Something wouldn’t exist. Although not every app is a booming suc-cess, 90 percent of the current 700,000 available apps are downloaded every month.
Everyone who owns an iPhone has had some interaction 
with the app store, but they’ve also probably had interaction with another facet of the iPhone economy: the accessories. 
Whether it’s just a case or a speaker system, iPhone owners 
made the iPhone accessories market worth $2 billion to $3 billion last year. Like the app store, this allows third parties to enter into the iPhone economy and design different cases, speakers, headphones and other smartphone-compatible products. This facet should continue to grow as analysts 
predict the iPhone accessories mar -
ket will grow to about $5 billion to $6 billion in the next three 
years.
Even the hype of the iPhone helps the economy . It earns 
Apple and any other company related to the phone’s pro-duction free publicity and also the occasional boost in their stock prices. On the other side of things, the iPhone provides plenty of traffic for tech blogs across the web. That in turn brings in traffic revenue. 
At the key of any economy is innovation. Companies like 
Square would have never been started without the iPhone. And while it isn’t the sole source of innovation, the popular crowd-funding site Kickstarter wouldn’t have reached the popularity it has now. The first major successful project for Kickstarter that brought it to the mainstream was the Pebble. The project was a watch that linked to and allowed you to control your iPhone. It received more than $10,000,000 in funding after originally asking for $100,000. This sparked a 
boom of innovative ideas on the platform ranging from new 
iPhone cases, camera lens adapters, foldable keyboards and plenty of other ideas.
Only some of these ideas will go on to create business-
es. The employees of these businesses, the revenue that is brought and the innovative opportunities available all owe their existence to the iPhone. More than any modern device, the iPhone has created multiple means of adding a boost to the economy, and it is a good thing that Apple decided to do 
“one more thing.”

When Ranee Ramaswamy started spilling coarse rice 
flour on the polished black floor of UF professor Joan Fro-
sch’s choreography classroom Monday, no one asked her to 
stop. That’s because the nationally recognized performer and 
teacher wasn’t making a mess — she was making art.
Ramaswamy and her Minneapolis-based dance company, 
Ragamala Dance, came to UF before their show to demon-
strate Indian culture to students. Ragamala Dance will per -
form “Sacred Earth” at 7:30 p.m. today at the Phillips Center 
for the Performing Arts.
Early Monday afternoon, about 20 students watched as 
Ramaswamy, founder and principal dancer of Ragamala 
Dance, pinched some of the white powder from a small metal 
tin and made a grid of dots.
Ramaswamy was showing the first step of Kolam, a spiri-
tual art form practiced by millions of women every morning in India as conscious offerings to Mother Earth, and the first of two cultural traditions she would teach the class.
“As a child, I learned this on the floor of my grandmoth-
er’s kitchen using chalk,” she told onlookers, rolling her thumb and sprinkling the rice flour in loops around the dots 
to make a series of connected geometrical lines resembling 
figure eights.
The performer had come far since she begun practicing art 
at the age of 5 in a concrete-floored building in Kerala, India. 
After moving to America in 1978, she created the Ragamala 
Dance company in 1992 to combine modern dance and music with Bharatanatyam, a traditional Indian dance form.
“I wanted to make this art form accessible to everyone,” 
said Ramaswamy, “to create works that keep our own styles 
without diluting it.”
Utilizing rhythmic foot stomps, struts across stage, and 
windmilling arm and hand movements, the six dancers of 
Ragamala Dance combine Bharatanatyam and Kolam to en-
tertain audiences while exposing them to Indian culture.
“You draw the audience with their eyes, “ dancer Tamara 
Nadel, 39, told the students. “That’s something that ascends 
style, culture and technique.”
Ramaswamy compared the dancers’ physical storytelling 
techniques to poets choosing the correct vocabulary to ex-press themselves.
“Once one has internalized the idiom, she can express the 
story,” Ramaswamy said.
The show also features translated classic Indian poetry 
performed live by two vocalists, a violinist and a percussion-ist.
Frosch, who is also the director of the UF Center for World 
Arts, said the demonstration was part of the organization’s goal to produce not only artists but also global citizens. She 
said her students were learning a culture “from the inside 
out.”
“Dance is a wonderful vehicle to communicate cross-cul-
turally,” she said. “It is not bound by language.”
Kenny Frechette, a 21-year-old dance senior, said he ap-
preciated the combination of mathematics, spirituality and philosophy in Bharatanatyam. He said his Catholic upbring-ing often made religion seem compartmentalized away from dance.
“The spirituality is really integrated in the dance,” 
Frechette said. “It’s really a beautiful thing and a beautiful way to live.”

Rolls ‘n Bowls is getting a 
makeover.
After business faltered, owner 
Hiro Leung decided to shut down 
Rolls ‘n Bowls to transform it into Yume Ume, a Japanese-style res-taurant.
Leung, the owner of Dragonfly 
Sushi & Sake Company, said the 
rebranding was important to boost 
the restaurant’s image.
Rolls ‘n Bowls opened in 2005, 
according to a news release.
“We had to create a new iden-
tity for our restaurant to figure 
out a way to expand our busi-
ness,” Leung said. “We came to a point where we could not expand Rolls ‘n Bowls because our busi-ness was stagnant.”
Yume Ume Japanese Kitchen, 
located at 3117 SW 34th St., plans to open its doors on Oct. 8, pend-ing the completion of construc-
tion. “Yume Ume” is Japanese for 
“yummy dreams.”
“We believe that food express-
es individuality,” Leung said. “We believe that the customers’ 
dreams are edible.”
Customers will be able to pick 
out meats and vegetables from 
a list, and chefs will cook up the 
bowl based on individuals’ pref-
erences, said Song Kim, executive 
director of Dragonfly Sushi & Sake 
Company.
The new restaurant will also 
have a bar area for beer, sake and 
tea, according to the release.
He said Yume Ume will offer 
its customers higher quality food than Rolls ‘n Bowls while keep-ing the fast service. 
He said the food will be afford-
able but did not give specifics on what the prices will be when the 
restaurant opens.
He said chefs will be slow 
cooking food such as braised pork 
and beef hours in advance to get the most flavor out of it and will 
be using fresh and locally grown 
vegetables.
The research team for Yume 
Ume took more than a year to 
develop a new menu, and Le-
ung said that almost all of Yume Ume’s dishes will be gluten-free.
Courtney Miller, a 20-year-old 
psychology junior, has been go-ing to Rolls ‘n Bowls every week 
since her freshman year, and she 
said she is sad that the restaurant is gone.
“I will definitely check out the 
new restaurant, but I’m not sure anything could measure up to Rolls ‘n Bowls,” Miller said.
Yume Ume will be giving its 
customers a 50 percent discount 
on its bowls from Oct. 8 to Oct. 10 
if customers request it.
Leung said that customers will 
be treated to a dining experience 
that was not offered at Rolls ‘n 
Bowls.
“Gainesville deserves great-
tasting fast food,” he said. “We are so confident that our cus-
tomers will love Yume Ume just 
as much as they loved Rolls ‘n Bowls.”Rolls ‘n Bowls closes for upgrade

A Gainesville startup plans to release 
an updated fitness app this month meant 
to remind and encourage users to work out.
With peerFit, people can set and re-
ceive reminders 25 hours prior to a group fitness class they’ve registered for, president Ed Buckley said.
“Everyone has a day where they’re 
feeling lazy,” he said. “Everyone has a day where they need a little push.”
Buckley, a 26-year-old UF doctoral 
student in health education and behav-ior, cofounded the company with three friends and launched the first prototype website in May 2011.
Once the site was up and running, 
Buckley and the peerFit team tested the prototype program at 44 universities across the country to avoid any sam-pling bias, he said. They then updated the site.
Now users can read reviews, search 
for classes and set reminders for future classes they want to attend.
PeerFit reviews classes at several fit-
ness centers within the Gainesville area including the two UF gyms, Body by Bo-ris, LifeStyle Wellness and Tallest Tree Dojo, Buckley said.

nior, also works as a peerFit storyteller.

The architects behind the Re-
itz Union renovations are going to 
bring students’ opinions to their drawing board.
Students can meet with the archi-
tects today from noon to 1:30 p.m. in the Reitz Union first floor lobby. 
They were there at the same time 
Monday.The architects will take student 
opinions into account and begin dia-
gramming the expansions over the next month, said Roland Lemke, an architect with Cannon Design, which is working on the renovations.
Students can also tweet their 
opinions to @MakingItReitz.
The blueprints should be ready 
by January, Lemke said.
“This is when we’re really look-
ing for the students’ voice to come out,” he said.
The architects will be back Oct. 
22 and Oct. 23 to talk with students again and to share ideas students came up with this week, Lemke said.
“We have no preconceptions,” he 
said. “There’s nothing drawn.”
Poster boards will be available 
today for students to explain what they want for the expansion and renovations, which are scheduled to be done by the 2015 school year.
“Quiet space for small groups to 
study — with outlets!” one student wrote.
“Renovate the game room!” 
wrote another.Tourism and hospitality man-
agement sophomore Katie Sbrocco, 19, stopped by Monday to chat with the architects.
She usually only comes to eat at 
the food court, she said. She hopes the renovations will make her want 
to spend more time at the Reitz 
Union.
“We don’t really hang out here,” 
Sbrocco said. “It’s not a place to study.” Architects to talk, tweet with students about Reitz Union plans

Two UF students recently learned they 
were getting a little help from a big name: 
Florida’s governor.
Gov. Rick Scott announced Thursday 
that the Florida Department of Business and Professional Regulation’s Division of Certified Public Accounting would be awarding $99,000 in scholarships to 16 mi-nority accounting students at Florida uni-versities. 
Among those names were Ivan Garcia and Alicia Saint John, both fifth-year ac-counting students at UF.
The 22-year-olds were notified that they 
were recipients on Aug. 24.
“I had an idea that I had a good chance 
of winning it, but I was very, very happy when I did,” Garcia said.
For Saint John, the news was a bit more 
surprising.
“I was ecstatic,” she said. “I honestly 
didn’t think I’d win.”
Garcia and Saint John were each award-
ed $6,387.10, to be disbursed in halves for the Fall 2012 and Spring 2013 semesters, according to a press release.
The scholarships were awarded through 
the CPA Education Minority Assistance Program, which was created in 1999 to 
provide financial support 
to fifth-year minority ac-
counting students, ac-cording to an email from Sandi Poreda, director of 
communications for the 
Florida Department of 
Business and Profession-
al Regulation. A $5 por -
tion of each individual 
and firm license fee in Florida funds the scholarship.
Applicants are considered based on fi-nancial need and academic performance, as well as an essay included in the appli-cation, according to Poreda’s email. The program’s Advisory Council reviews the applications and recommends winners.
“I was lucky enough to find out about 
this opportunity before the deadline,” Garcia said.
Both he and Saint John said the money 
from the scholarship would lessen the bur -
den of student loans. Saint John said she might not have even been able to remain at UF without it.
“I was contemplating going somewhere 
cheaper for grad school,” she said. “With this scholarship, I know I made the right choice to stay here.” Gov. Scott awards two UF accounting students scholarships “This is when we’re really 
looking for the students’ 
voice to come out.”

Florida quarterback Jeff Driskel (6) attempts a pass against the Kentucky defense 
in the Gators’ 38-0 win on Sept. 22 at Ben Hill Grifﬁ  n Stadium.
 �THE SOPHOMORE MISSED LAST 
YEAR’S GAME WITH AN ANKLE INJURY. 
  GREG LUCA
 Alligator Staff Writer
  
  On Saturday, Jeff Driskel will get the 
chance he never got last season. 
  When Florida was preparing to face even-
tual Southeastern Conference champion LSU 
a year ago, Driskel spent most of his time rehabbing an ankle sprain in the training room.
  Florida needed a starter to replace John 
Brantley, who suffered a high ankle sprain against Alabama seven days before UF was slated to play LSU. But Driskel would not be the guy. 
  Instead, Jacoby Brissett started in his 
place. 
Brissett completed 8 of 14 passes for 94 
yards and a touchdown with two intercep-
tions as Florida lost 41-11 in Baton Rouge, 
La. 
  “I was in the training room all day long 
trying to get back, doing whatever I could,” Driskel said. “There was just not enough 
time.”
  Driskel entered UF as the nation’s top-rat-
ed passer and had the advantage of being an 
early enrollee. 
When Brantley went down against the 
Crimson Tide, Driskel got the call, complet-ing 2 of 6 passes for 14 yards. 
  Driskel said he was upset about not being 
able to play against the Tigers, but added that 
his performance was the biggest reason he took a backseat to Brissett for the remainder 
of the season. 
  “A lot of guys in his situation nowadays 
want to point at a situation and say, ‘It’s not fair,’” coach Will Muschamp said. “Instead, he decided to work.”
  After earning rave reviews in summer and 
fall camp, Driskel opened 2012 as the starter at quarterback. 
Through four games he has thrown for 698 
yards and four touchdowns with one inter-
ception while completing 69.6 percent of his 
passes. 
He also has 33 carries for 148 yards and 
a score.
  “He’s a guy that took his circumstances 
and did something about it,” Muschamp said. “It’s a credit to him and his fortitude and his drive.”
  Nearly one year after UF’s 2011 matchup 
with LSU, Driskel will ﬁ  nally get a shot at the Tigers. 
  LSU boasts the nation’s No. 6 pass de-
fense, including a defensive line Muschamp said was “probably as good a front four (as 
there is) in college football.” 
The unit is headed by elite talents Barkevi-
ous Mingo and Sam Montgomery at defen-
sive end. 
Linebacker Kevin Minter and safety Eric 
Reid have also distinguished themselves as two of the nation’s best.
  “They have speed all over the ﬁ  eld, and es-
pecially at the defensive line,” Driskel said. 
“That front four is the best that we’ll see 
all year. It’s loaded with ﬁ  rst-round draft After sitting out 2011 matchup, Driskel gets shot at LSU  
  JOE MORGAN
 Alligator Staff Writer
  
  On Saturday, LSU defensive ends Barkevi-
ous Mingo and Sam Montgomery will go after Florida quarterback Jeff Driskel. Which 
Gators offensive lineman will protect Driskel’s 
blind side has yet to be determined. Either in-jured senior Xavier Nixon or freshman D.J. Humphries is expected to start at left tackle.
  “Whoever practices the best will play,” 
coach Will Muschamp said.
  Nixon, who has started all four games 
this season, has been dealing with what Mus-champ described on Sept. 24 as a “legitimate” 
shoulder injury. Humphries played nearly 
the entire second half in Florida’s 38-0 win against Kentucky on Sept. 22.
  Although Nixon boasts 26 career starts, 
Driskel is not worried about Humphries po-tentially taking over the left tackle spot.  “He’s a guy that’s worked hard ever since 
he’s gotten here,” Driskel said of Humphries. “He came in in the spring a little undersized, but he’s really fast and he’s great in his tech-nique. We have all the conﬁ  dence in the world 
in him. If need be he plays, he’ll be ﬁ  ne.”
  
  Jenkins back, but non-
contact: Linebacker Jelani 
Jenkins returned to prac-
tice in non-contact drills on Monday. Muschamp was 
hopeful Jenkins would be cleared for contact prior 
to Wednesday’s practice. 
Jenkins’ status for Saturday’s game remains 
uncertain, but if he were to play, coaches have said he would do so with a cast.
  “LSU, in most situations offensively, is 
going to give you some things they haven’t Starter at left tackle not set THE ADAM BOMB
  When the Gators and Tigers play on Saturday, it will be the ﬁ  rst top-10 matchup 
in The Swamp in six years. Florida will attempt to knock off its highest-ranked opponent at  home since de-feating then-No. 4 LSU in 2008.
  Winning against the Tigers on Sat-
urday would put the Gators in a po-sition they haven’t been since Urban Meyer retired the ﬁ  rst time — nation-al title contenders.
  Despite the chance to enter the na-
tional title race, UF has been focused from the beginning of the season on reaching Atlanta and playing in the 
Southeastern Conference champion-
ship game — not the BCS title game in Miami. That isn’t a realistic goal right now.   Coach Will 
Muschamp’s message has 
stayed the 
same for the entire season.
  The Gators 
don’t let the highs and 
lows get to them. Tenth-ranked Flori-da is a cool customer. It’s business as usual.
  Florida’s standing amongst na-
tional powers in the ﬁ  fth game of a 12-game regular season doesn’t mat-ter.
  Saturday’s matchup against the Ti-
gers is just another conference game, Win or lose, UF’s game vs. 
LSU won’t deﬁ  ne season  SEE FOOTBALL, PAGE 15

in UF’s 4-0 win on Sunday afternoon at James G. Pressly Stadium.
SOCCER
ADAM LICHTENSTEIN

Sophomore Jillian Graff doesn’t see a lot of time 
on the field. But when she does, she makes the most 
of it.
Graff has been the Gators’ most efficient scorer this 
season. She has appeared in 11 of Florida’s 12 games but has made only two starts. In those 11 games, she took seven shots. Three of them found the back of the 
net.
“I try to make something happen every time I get 
in the game,” Graff said. “Every time I get into the 
game, I have to make it count.”
Graff has a done a good job of making her minutes 
count. 
Graff achieved her biggest goal of the season 
against then-No. 2 Duke on Aug. 26, when she scored to give UF momentum going into halftime. The Gators 
would go on to upset the Blue Devils 3-2 in overtime.
“Once that goal went in, everyone got pumped 
up,” Graff said after the game.
Graff netted her second goal against Georgia on 
Sept. 23, solidifying a 4-1 victory for Florida. 
Last week, coach Becky Burleigh said Graff had 
several things she needed to work on before she 
would see a jump in playing time.“She does a great job of moving off the ball, but 
she’s got to continue to attack the back line,” Burleigh said. “She does create space, but ultimately, someone has to exploit that space.”
Graff displayed enough of those skills in practice, 
so Burleigh penciled her in as a starting forward on Friday against Ole Miss.
Graff did not disappoint.
In a season-high 64 minutes, Graff took two shots 
on goal. In the 52nd minute, she scored the game-
winning goal in the Gators’ 3-1 victory against the 
Rebels.
“She works hard to get in the box and keep the 
box organized,” Burleigh said. “Those are things her 
personality sort of lends itself to. She’s a disciplined 
person.”
Graff’s teammates have also noticed her clutch 
play this season.
“Every time Jill comes off the bench, she somehow 
is able to grasp onto our rhythm and score,” senior Erika Tymrak said.Forward thriving in limited time

picks.”
  Regardless of the challenges ahead, Mus-
champ wants Driskel to focus on playing 
within his limits. 
Driskel needs to get the ball out of his 
hands quickly and ensure UF gets in and 
out of the correct play calls.  
  “Jeff needs to be Jeff,” Muschamp said. 
“We don’t need any super-human effort. … He doesn’t need to do anything more than he’s done in the previous four weeks.”
  Driskel said he plans to prepare for LSU 
with many hours in the ﬁ  lm room — a wel-come upgrade over the training room he was conﬁ  ned to a year ago. 
  “I’m excited to get this opportunity,” 
Driskel said. “That’s why you come to Flor-ida, and that’s why you want to play in the SEC.”
  Contact Greg Luca at gluca@alligator.org. Injured linebacker’s experience could bolster Florida defense
shown before, so him being able to adjust some things out you haven’t prepared for, because 
you can’t prepare for every-
thing,” Muschamp said of how Jenkins’ potential return would help UF. “Certainly, his experi-
ence, maturity, playmaking abil-
ity, being able to make some de-fensive calls and calm some guys down in situations in a game like this — there is no question it will 
be an added boost.”
  Jenkins suffered a fracture in 
his right thumb during Florida’s 
20-17 win against Texas A&M on 
Sept. 8. He underwent surgery 
on Sept. 10.
  If Jenkins is unable to play 
against the Tigers, freshman An-tonio Morrison will likely make his third consecutive start at 
weakside linebacker. Morrison 
has 16 tackles, one tackle for loss and one quarterback hurry in 2012.
  Other injury updates: Mus-champ said Trey Burton (back 
spasms), Dominique Easley 
(swelling in left knee), Shar-
rif Floyd (shoulder) and Jordan 
Reed (undisclosed head injury) 
all returned to practice on Mon-
day.
  Burton and Easley sat out the 
entirety of Florida’s 38-0 win against Kentucky, while Floyd 
and Reed played before exiting 
due to injury.
  Muschamp said Monday 
that Cody Riggs (foot) and Matt 
Patchan (strained pectoral mus-
cle) will not play against LSU. Riggs suffered a fracture in his right foot during the Gators’ win against the Aggies on Sept. 8.
  Patchan has not played since 
Florida lost to Florida State 21-7 last season on Nov. 26. This weekend’s contest against the 
Tigers will mark the 32nd game 
Patchan has missed due to injury during his college career.
  
  Offensive numbers: During the Gators’ bye week, they missed out on the second-highest-scor-ing weekend in college football since 1937, according to the Elias Sports Bureau. The 52 FBS games 
during the weekend produced 
an average of 60.8 points.
  Signiﬁ  cant contributions to 
that total came from West Vir-
ginia’s 70-63 win against Bay-lor and Georgia’s 51-44 victory against Tennessee.
  “I’m glad we were off,” Mus-
champ said. “I think with a lot of the tempo, there are a lot more snaps being taken on both sides for both teams. Everybody is 
into this tempo, getting on the 
ball and snapping it, and going as fast as we can.”
  Wide receiver Frankie Ham-
mond Jr. likes to see a lot of scor-
ing, and he does not think offen-
sive shootouts are bad for college football. However, he said explo-sive offense without good de-
fense is not worth much.
  “If we score 70 and the other 
team scores seven, that’s good,” Hammond said. “If we score 70 
and the other team scores 60, that’s not good.”
  Contact Joe Morgan at joemor-
gan@alligator.org. NOTES , from page 13and the Gators have acted accordingly. 
  “We won’t put any more hours this 
week than three weeks ago,” UF coach 
Will Muschamp said. “I know everybody 
thinks that all of a sudden we’re going to change everything for one game, but we’re not.”
  Jeff Driskel stood at the podium on 
Monday and delivered the same mechani-cal response he, his teammates and the coaching staff have given the entire sea-son.
  “It’s just another day, but it’s deﬁ  nitely 
a big one,” Driskel said. “It’s a really good 
opponent, and we’re excited for the oppor-
tunity to be matched up with one of the best in the country.”
  This from a player who wasn’t on the 
ﬁ  eld in LSU’s 30-point beatdown of Flori-
da last season. A player who has yet to feel 
what it’s like to try to make plays against the NFL breeding ground that is the Ti-gers’ defense.  Sure, LSU represents a huge challenge 
for UF.
  Before the season — on paper — the 
Gators had no business beating the Ti-
gers. 
  But four games in, UF looks very differ-
ent from the overmatched squad that lost 
in Death Valley last season.
  Florida will run out of its locker room 
with a sense of optimism not felt in Gainesville in quite some time. 
  That still doesn’t make this game any 
bigger than any other Saturday in the SEC.
  “These wins are pretty much hard to 
come by,” senior linebacker Jon Bostic said. “Anybody can beat anybody on pret-
ty much any given day. So, we’ve got to 
bring our A game. [The Tigers have] got to bring their A game. We’ve got to try to go out, play smart and limit our mistakes.”
  A loss on Saturday isn’t the end of the 
world. The biggest mistake for Florida would be to treat it as such.

Dana Backlund (2) during UF’s 3-0 win against Jacksonville on Sept. 7.
JONATHAN CZUPRYN

As the Gators lined up for serving prac-
tice in the Lemerand Center, Simone Antwi 
imagined she was somewhere else.
“UCLA vs. Florida, NCAA national 
championship, fifth set, 14-13 us and Simo-ne Antwi to serve” she said, causing grins to appear on her teammates’ faces. 
The ball zipped over the net, dropping 
dead just inside the “opponent’s” corner. The team erupted with laughter and cheers as they mobbed Antwi with hugs and high fives.
Last year, that was as real as it got for 
Antwi.
But today, the redshirt freshman is com-
ing off back-to-back performances with a 
hitting percentage of at least .600. 
She notched two kills in three attacks 
during UF’s 3-1 win on Friday against 
South Carolina and added six kills in 10 attacks with four block assists in Sunday’s 
3-0 win against Mississippi State. 
“I’m still star struck,” she said.After redshirting during the 2011 sea-
son, Antwi has grown into a more com-
plete athlete, coach Mary Wise said.
Wise said she wouldn’t even allow 
Antwi to serve in practice last year, as it was not part of her initial training pro-gram. 
But now the 6-foot-2 middle blocker is 
third on the team with 11 aces. 
Her success rate on serves is nearly 90 
percent, as she has made only nine errors 
in 87 attempts. 
Wise added that Antwi’s quick learning 
and dedication to improve in every area of 
the game are exciting, because Antwi still 
has plenty of time to grow at Florida.
“The fun thing will be is to have Simo-
ne, knowing that she’s just a month into her career and we still have three full years 
left,” she said.
When the Fairfax Station, Va., South 
County High graduate learned she would sit out a year, she was not disappointed. 
Instead, she wanted to work on her 
game so that she could contribute when she returned to the court the following season.
“I was excited because it was another 
opportunity to learn,” Antwi said. 
“Being able to sit out and watch every-
thing was truly good for me. I learned a lot from the middles and the past players and 
the coaches. I had a lot more time to work 
on everything.”
Antwi said she is still working on her 
blocking. 
Although Antwi has only 17 blocks this 
season, Wise said Antwi has the perfect opportunity to improve by playing behind 
junior Chloe Mann and senior Betsy Smith, 
who both redshirted as freshmen.
“Right now she’s playing behind two 
pretty darn good middles,” Wise said. 
“Where she can really help us out is her 
blocking. We think Simone has got a chance to be the best blocker to come through this program when it’s all said and done.”Redshirt freshman finding role for Florida

Thanks to bounce-back performances by 
senior T.J. Vogel and freshman A.J. Crouch, 
Florida is within eight strokes of second place after the second round of the Olym-pia Fields/Illini Invitational. 
Florida shot a 286 (+6) to move into sixth 
place. UF’s second-round total was a nine-stroke improvement on the 295 (+15) the Gators carded in the first round.
Vogel and Crouch rebounded from their 
dismal first rounds to shoot even par. Vogel birdied a team-high four holes — including the final two holes of the day — to finish at 
70 (E). The round was a six-stroke improve-
ment from his Sunday total. Vogel is cur -
rently tied for 23rd after starting the second round of play in 46th.
After bogeying six holes during Sun-
day’s round of play, Crouch recovered to shoot even par en route to a 10-stroke im-provement. Crouch notched three birdies in Round 2 after failing to birdie the previ-
ous day, when blustery conditions caused 
difficulties.  
“The golf course was much easier today than it was yesterday,” coach Buddy Alex-ander said.
Despite the improved 
weather conditions, se-
nior Tyler McCumber and sophomore J.D. Tomlinson were unable to build on the first-round success that pro-pelled them into the top 10 of the individual lea-
derboards. McCumber 
shot a 70 (E) on Sunday, while Tomlinson 
notched a 72 (+2).Both McCumber and Tomlinson carded 
a 73 (+3) in the second round. Tomlinson 
dropped nine spots to 18th, while McCum-
ber is tied for ninth as he sits six strokes behind tournament leader Sebastian Cap-pelen (-3) of Arkansas. 
Redshirt sophomore Santiago Gavino 
continued to struggle early, bogeying or double bogeying his initial six holes. The San Luis Potosi native collected three bird-ies to finish at 80 (+10).
“I believe we still have a good round in 
us and can move up the leaderboard,” Al-exander said.
