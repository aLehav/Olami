VIRGINIA BEACH, Va.  — The owner of 
a Virginia restaurant had to close down this 
weekend when something unusual clogged an exhaust vent over his kitchen stove: A former employee.
Harold Owens, owner of Harold’s Res-
taurant in Virginia Beach, says the man used to work for him. 
He came in to open the restaurant Satur -
day and found the man’s feet dangling from the 18-inch-by-18-inch duct.The Virginian-Pilot reports the man was 
treated for a shoulder injury at a local hos-pital after firefighters managed to free the man.
Fire Battalion Chief Ken Pravetz told the 
newspaper that investigators believe the former employee was trying to get into the restaurant through the vent. Owens says the man apologized to him for trying to climb in.

JACKSONVILLE — As the 
Florida field goal unit huddled, 
Chas Henry appropriately stood to the side.
In a way , Henry’s season 
has been a microcosm of what’s plagued Florida in 2010. He en-
tered the year hyped as one of 
the best punters in the nation. An 
injury to starting kicker Caleb St-urgis thrust Henry into an unfa-miliar, perhaps even unfair role. And after early success, Henry 
had missed his last three field goal 
attempts entering Saturday.
When his potential game-
tying field goal sailed wide right against Mississippi State on Oct. 16, Henry was the lowest player on a downtrodden squad.
But, with Florida in its first 
overtime game since 2005, Henry 
was ready to end what he called 
“redemption week.” His 37-yard field goal split the goalposts, giv-ing Florida a 34-31 win over Geor -
gia (4-5, 3-4 Southeastern Confer -
ence) in front of 84,444 divided 
fans at EverBank Field. 
“That internal family that we 
have is about as strong as you 
can get,” Henry said. “We never break. We’re always behind each other. I let them down one time, and I was never going to let that happen again.”
The successful field goal at-
tempt, Florida’s first walk-off since Arden Czyewski made a 
game-winner in 1989, brought 
redemption not just to Henry but to the entire team. The offense gained 450 yards, about 120 yards more than its season average. And the defense set up a pair of scores with four turnovers. 
The Gators (5-3, 3-3 SEC) 
ended a three-game losing streak, keeping their hope of an SEC Championship Game appearance alive. If Florida beats Vanderbilt on Saturday and South Carolina on Nov . 13, the team will punch a ticket to Atlanta.
“This is the biggest win I can 
remember, and I’ve coached here a long time,” said coach Ur -
ban Meyer, now in his sixth sea-son with the Gators. “That was an emotional locker room now. These guys have been to hell and ALIVE AND KICKIN’

Accused bank robber 
dropped wallet
DESTIN — Investigators knew 
a man accused of stealing $6,000 
from a Florida Panhandle bank didn’t stuff the cash in his wallet. That’s because he somehow left it 
there, making it easy for authori-
ties to find him.
The Okaloosa County Sheriff’s 
Office says the 26-year-old robber brandished a handgun at Destin’s Union State Bank on Thursday, ordering the employees to the floor. Deputies say he fled with $6,000.
While investigators searched 
the bank, a witness found a wallet nearby. Investigators showed the ID photo to bank employees, who thought it might be the robber.
Deputies searched the man’s 
house and say they found cash and a gun that appeared to be the one used by the robber.

DEBATE
By LUKE GAVIN
Alligator Contributing Writer 
High school students duked it out over 
the weekend at UF, but they hit with words 
instead of fists.
About 1,100 students from high schools 
across the country competed in the 27th Blue Key Speech and Debate Tournament on Friday, Saturday and Sunday at various locations across the UF campus.
There were 13 different speech and de-
bate events, as well as three supplemental events for participants not advancing be-yond the preliminary rounds.
The winners of each event were crowned 
in an awards ceremony in the Grand Ball-room on Sunday night in the Reitz Union. Chelsey Campbell, a UF pharmacy grad-
uate student and the tournament chairman, said the tournament drew local students as well as students from as far as California and Minnesota.
“This is a good opportunity for them 
to learn about the debate community and to increase their skills in all the different 
events that we offer,” Camp-bell said.
 Marcos Gonzalez, a junior 
at Trinity Prep in Winter Park, 
Fla., won first place with a teammate in the duo interpretation event.
“We actually took the movie, ‘Big Fish,’ 
and cut it down into 10 minutes and per -
formed it,” Gonzalez said. 
The debates were judged by students.High schoolers debate
� THEY KNITTED FOR EIGHT HOURS.
By MEREDITH RUTLAND
Alligator Contributing Writer
Knitting isn’t just for grandmothers.
That’s what Kelly Korman said she 
wishes people understood about her club.
As president of Close-Knit Gators, a 
knitting and crocheting club, she orga-nized a knit-a-thon to pump out hat after hat for eight hours to donate to Shands’ 
breast cancer patients.
About six club members sat on the 
Plaza of the Americas on Friday with yarn and baked goods to keep them going. 
At the knit-a-thon, the members sat 
next to a tree covered in handmade pink 
scarves, complete with the iconic breast cancer ribbon and a light-pink bikini, dis-cussing tattoos and ways to stretch a col-lege budget.
They passed out self-examination fliers 
that read, “Time to take your breasts into your own hands.”
“We made the club to show that knitting 
can be a powerful craft,” Korman said.
They hope to have about 30 finished 
hats and scarves to donate to Shands with-in the week.Korman said the club initially wanted 
to yarn bomb the campus, which is where people cover monuments with scarves and other items—essentially, removable graf-
fiti. 
They wanted to put the pink bikini on 
an Albert statue in the Emerson Alumni 
Hall courtyard and cover the Turlington potato statue with a giant sweater, but the university administration wouldn’t allow that.
Katherine Artman, vice president of the 
club, said she had to learn to knit when she joined. 
It didn’t go well. Then, she tried to cro-
chet, and it just clicked for her.
Between the two of them, they cover 
both techniques. Korman teaches mem-bers to knit, and Artman teaches them to crochet. 
But they are both out to prove that knit-
ting isn’t for the timid.
“This isn’t your grandmother’s knitting 
circle,” Artman said.Knitting club uses ‘powerful craft’ to help cancer victims

Ishmael Khaldi, the first Bedouin 
Deputy Consul for the State of Israel and 
the nation’s first high-ranking Muslim in the Israeli Foreign Service, will be speak-ing at UF on Monday night. 
Khaldi will discuss the democratic 
government of Israel and give insight into the diversity of Israel, said Claire Miller, co-director of Israel Week 2010. 
As a Bedouin, Khaldi will discuss 
the struggle for the Bedouin minority to achieve full equality in Israel and the efforts Bedouins have been making to graduate high school, attend universities 
and obtain jobs.  
The event is co-sponsored by Accent and the Jewish Student Union and will 
take place in Pugh Hall’s Ocora at 7 p.m. — free and public. 
Khaldi was paid 
$1,000 to speak, said 
Zack Goldstein, Ac-
cent chairman. 
Following the 
event, the Jewish Stu-
dent Union will be holding a Bedouin-themed event at UF Hillel from 9 to 11 
p.m. There will be free food, hookah, a 
band and henna artists at the event.

Welcome to Theatre Santa 
Fe’s “House of Seven.” This 
student-run theater produc-tion group hosted its sixth an-nual haunted house Friday and 
Saturday night at Santa Fe Col-
lege. 
This year’s theme was based 
on the seven deadly sins — 
envy, sloth, gluttony, greed, 
lust, anger and pride — said Gregg Jones, adviser for The-atre Santa Fe.
Jones, dressed in a ghoul-
ish costume with painted black eyes and a chalk-white face, monitored the ticket table. 
Sarah Emmets, president of 
Theatre Santa Fe, represented the deadly sin “lust.”
Dressed in black tights and 
lingerie with dark black eyes and 
blood all over her 
body, Emmets led 
the tours through the haunted house.
Once patrons purchased 
their tickets, they nervously waited in the “graveyard” be-fore entering.
“Welcome to the house of 
seven deadly sins, I will be 
your host tonight,” Emmets an-
nounced in a shrill voice.
The club has been planning 
this fundraiser since early Sep-tember, she said.
The haunted house,  located 
in Building S on the SFC cam-pus, ran from 8 p.m. to mid-night.
On Friday, 160 people at-
tended and the club raised more than $600. 
That is the most that’s ever been raised in one night, Jones 
said.
The haunted house is The-
atre Santa Fe’s biggest fund-
raiser. 
Proceeds from the event go 
to the club. 
 There were two to four peo-
ple in each room, and it was up to them to decorate it according 
to the sin they represent, Em-
mets said.The students enjoy this fund-
raiser and they take it very seri-ously, Jones said. It gives them a chance to understand how to 
execute a theater production.
The haunted house charac-
ters are not allowed to touch 
anyone, Emmets said, but the patrons still get pretty freaked 
out.
She said one of the visitors 
who went through the house 
got so scared he accidentally 
threw a punch.4, ALLIGATOR � MONDAY, NOVEMBER 1, 2010

�THE TWO ARE RUNNING 
AGAINST REPUBLICAN MARCO RUBIO.
THE ASSOCIATED PRESS
RIVIERA BEACH — Inde-
pendent Charlie Crist was look-
ing to convert some Democrats, Democratic Rep. Kendrick Meek was praying for a miracle and 
Republican Marco Rubio was 
preaching to the choir Sunday as the three-way race for Senate neared an end.
Crist, whose embrace of Pres-
ident Barack Obama in February 2009 helped lead to his demise in the Republican Party, was clearly pinning his long-shot chances on 
persuading Democrats to sup-
port him. He was even sounding like Obama at an early morning stop.
“Yes, we can,” Crist told a 
group of seniors after former state Rep. Addie Greene said the election was about moving Obama’s agenda forward.
At the same time, Meek was 
visiting three South Florida churches before going on an overnight campaign marathon across the state. 
He started at his own congre-
gation, Mount Tabor Missionary Baptist Church in Miami’s tough Liberty City neighborhood. 
With a choir swaying and 
humming behind him, the pas-tor offered a special blessing for Meek and his mother, former Congresswoman Carrie Meek, whom he followed into state and 
national politics.
“Lord, we thank you, so that 
somebody from our community, 
somebody that knows the pain that we deal with every day, should have that opportunity to be a candidate for such a po-sition. What a blessing that is,” said the Rev. George McRae as congregants pushed toward his pulpit, holding hands to form a ring around the Meeks.
“Like my grandmother 
would have said, ‘Who would have thunk it?’” Meek asked the cheering congregation. “That I would come from a congrega-
tion, a community, a neighbor -
hood, a part of the state where 
people are going through the muddiness of life, to then run for the United States Senate to give voice to the people who struggle?”
Meek’s path to the Senate, 
though, is made more difficult 
by Crist, who left the GOP after 
falling behind Rubio. 
Since April, Crist has sought 
to win over Democrats by reach-ing out to teacher and labor unions and speaking in support of abortion and gay rights.
After echoing Obama’s cam-
paign slogan, Crist said he 
doesn’t agree with the president 
on everything.
“I certainly could work with 
him when I think he’s right and 
I’ll stand up to him when I think he’s wrong,” Crist said. “I’ll do 
what I think 
is right for the state of Flori-da.”
Meanwhile 
Rubio, with a comfortable lead in the polls, was speaking to crowds he knows he’s already won over, telling a Republican 
group in Tampa that they agree 
on the issues, but he wants to make sure they vote.
The former state House speak-
er remembered being laughed at by many when he entered the GOP primary race against Crist last year. They said he had no chance and, he acknowledged, 
that even he had doubts at times 
that he would be in the position he is now.
But he said that the campaign 
was about something more im-portant than winning and los-ing.
“This upcoming election in 
2010 would be a referendum on 
our identity as a nation and as a 
people,” Rubio said.Meek, Crist vie for Democrats’ votes as Senate race closes

CollegeMONDAY, NOVEMBER 1, 2010 � ALLIGATOR, 5
The restaurant’s founder worked as the cook until he was 97
an 82-year run.
“It’s a sad situation,” Williams 
said. “It’s a deep thing that goes on, 
you know? You grow up with some-thing, and then it’s gone.”
Louis Pennisi, the restaurant’s 
namesake, set up his shop at the corner of Southeast Second Street and Fifth Avenue in 1928. In 1936, he decided to move the restaurant to its current location at 436 SE Second St. 
In the 1950s, he sold the business 
to his son Freddie and continued to work as the cook until age 97. 
Freddie owned the restaurant 
until his death in 1993, when he was shot in the store during a robbery.
Louis died at age 106 in 2003, ex-
actly 10 years after his son’s death.
The restaurant was then turned 
over to Tom Pennisi, who took over the restaurant from Freddie’s widow in 1995. Pennisi said he took over the 
restaurant because he felt as Louis’ 
son, it was his destiny . 
But destiny is carrying Pennisi in 
a different direction – retirement. 
“This past year has been real 
bad,” Pennisi said. “I wasn’t makin’ enough sales. I just got agitated. Old equipment wearing out; expenses getting high.”
Though he said he does not know 
what he will do with himself after the restaurant is gone, Pennisi found purpose in his final day at work. 
He spent most of his time prepar -
ing the restaurant’s signature burg-ers, made of beef and turkey – his grandmother’s meatball recipe. Though he said he was tired 
and found it hard to keep going, he didn’t want to close down the res-taurant, his father’s legacy.
“I’ll be crying all night long,” said 
57-year-old waitress Joyce Philman, who had been working at the restau-
rant with Pennisi, her ex-husband, 
and their daughter, Emily Cheves. “I thought we’d never have to close this store.”
Philman occasionally teared up 
as she bustled around behind the counter. On her final day of work, she helped her daughter take or -
ders and prepare food for the line of 
customers who came to see Gaines-
ville’s oldest restaurant off, which spanned all the way out the door.
It had been a long time since she 
had seen crowds like that.
“It takes something like this for 
people to come back so they can sup-port us,” she said. “If they did sup-port us, we wouldn’t be closing.”
The restaurant, which survived 
the Great Depression and a slew of recessions, could not recover from the economy’s recent downturn. 
Other factors, such as road clo-
sures on Main Street and the occa-sional equipment failure, like the ice machine, helped to sound the death knell for the restaurant.
Chris Baxley , a 59-year-old from 
St. Augustine, was one of the final customers served on Saturday . 
Baxley has a rich family history 
tied to the restaurant. His parents ate there the night they were married in 1949. As a UF student  in the 1960s, he became a regular customer. 
Over the span of eight presiden-
tial administrations, the restaurant became something more than an or -
dinary lunchtime destination. 
Whenever he traveled to 
Gainesville, whether for football games or on business, he made a point to stop at the faded, white res-taurant for a meal. 
There were even times when Bax-
ley would travel to Gainesville just to eat at Louis’ Lunch before driving back to his hometown.
“I just finished my last Louis 
Burger ever, and that’s a pretty sad 
thing,” he said. “It’s really a part of 
all these people. They’re a part of our lives, we’re a part of their lives.” 
 Though Louis’ Lunch will no 
longer be there to serve up burgers reminiscent of 1920s America, those seeking a brief moment of nostalgia only need to drive down the street past the old restaurant and look up 
at the street signs.

Customers gather Saturday to pay their bills during the closing of Louis’ Lunch, which held the title of 
Gainesville’s oldest restaurant.
Some restaurants changed menus or offered Fest discounts  
A meal at Gator Dawgs usually costs less than $5, mak-
ing it an optimal dining spot for Fest fans on a budget. 
Marta Puyana, chef for Flaco’s restaurant, said her 
weekend sales double from $3,000 to $6,000 during the 
annual festival, and customers from out of town often 
comment on Gainesville’s low food prices compared to 
the rest of the states. 
“One girl asked me for a hug because of how much she 
enjoyed my food and how inexpensive it was,” Puyana said. “It’s fresh and it’s cheap, and I think a lot of people are pleasantly surprised by that.” First-time Fest attendee David Hitchcock, of Fort Lau-
derdale, was also pleasantly surprised at Gainesville’s ex-tensive selection of vegan and vegetarian options. 
“A lot of us punks that come down here are vegan or 
vegetarian, and this is the first place in my entire life that 
I’ve seen standard restaurants offer so many vegan options,” he said. “And they’re really cheap, so I eat really well around here in Gainesville.”
Other restaurants like Boca Fiesta and Maude’s Clas-
sic Cafe changed their menus or offered special Fest dis-counts to accommodate the weekend’s large influx of empty stomachs. “For people with Fest wristbands, coffee is only a dol-
lar,” said Ryan Hickey, co-manager at Maude’s Classic Café. “We probably have the cheapest coffee in town right now.”
Jacob Ihde, co-owner of Boca Fiesta, said he hasn’t sat 
down to count profits from The Fest compared to other weekends, but he knows the restaurant gets packed be-cause Fest attendees aren’t looking to grab a quick bite, but instead to stay awhile, to enjoy each other’s conversa-tion and to listen to the live music. 
“It’s not about the money,” Ihde said. “It’s about the music and The Fest. That’s why people 
are here.”

Today’s question: Should the state enforce spending limits on campaigns?
110 TOTAL VOTES35% YES65% NOFriday’s question: Would you dress your pet up for Halloween?
Mo’ money, 
mo’ problems
Spending is too high As candidates across our great land of amber waves of 
grain push full throttle in the final two days of election season, they’re realizing it’s do-or-die time. 
And sometimes the difference between doing or dying is 
$11 million. 
In the final 12 days of the election season, Rick “This-Elec-
tion-Is-About-Jobs” Scott tossed another $11.6 million of vit-riol and 30-second commercials (we can only hope his mom stars in these as well) into his campaign.
That, Floridians, brings Scott’s self-funded campaign tab to 
a paltry $73 million. 
This clearly leaves our only other viable contender, Alex “I-
Cnt-Stp-Txting-During-Debates” Sink at a financial disadvan-tage with her measly job as chief financial officer. 
With a record-shattering wallet and a sole focus on job cre-
ation, Scott has created, along with the help of many large pri-vate corporate donors, the most expensive governor’s race in history. 
The $11.2 million Sink raised throughout the campaign, 
which would seem to be enough to withstand a sizeable po-litical race, is less than Scott has spent in the past 12 days. 
And even $11.2 million is a huge amount of cold, hard cash 
that is dripping with disdain from the middle class for whom 
Sink is fighting. The middle class will never see $11.2 million. 
And the middle class isn’t able to comprehend $73 million.
There’s something wrong there. When politicians can afford to fork over $73 million of 
their own hard (fraudulently) earned money while accepting million-dollar donations from huge corporations, something is wrong.
When $11.2 million just doesn’t cut it anymore, something 
is wrong. 
And while we acknowledge the great American way of 
opening our pocketbooks to the candidates we most agree with, we realize this Who-Wants-To-Elect-A-Multimillionaire game, played out at the ballot, denies the great American way for countless people who want to serve their fellow country-men and women but are too busy paying their mortgages to finance TV ads. 
And while we’re not saying politicians shouldn’t be able 
to spend the money they have — many of us have made cam-
paign contributions in the past — we also realize the impor -
tance of campaign spending limits to even out the playing 
field. 
Because when Floridians are given a candidate to whom 
U.S. Sugar donates 1.7 million
and Blue Cross Blue Shield donates $910,000,  it leaves little 
room for that candidate to say what’s on his mind. It leaves little room for him to say anything besides what U.S. Sugar and Blue Cross Blue Shield want to be said. 
And that makes for very influenced, dirty and biased poli-
tics where the losers are each and every one of us. 
Because the sad truth is money talks. In fact, it shouts. And 
dirty money yells just as loud. 
But perhaps there’s hope that Floridians will see past the 
political money-making machine. In a gubernatorial race that is full of nothing but jobs, money, mortgages and more of Scott’s money, one would think this race should be irrefut-ably one-sided with Scott’s wallet, leaving his opponent in the dust. 
But the race for governor, although financially one-sided, is 
neck and neck down to the wire. 
This is not a partisan issue. This is not about blue versus 
red. It’s about accountability. And it’s about accountability to the people who matter. U.S. Sugar doesn’t matter. We matter.Amendment 4 worth another look
When you go to the voting precinct this week, 
you might notice a group of six amendments waiting for you. Just don’t let the numbering 
confuse you. Two of the amendments were removed, and someone decided not to change the numbering. 
Sometimes I think government officials just like to 
confuse people.
Regardless, there is one amendment that I think 
needs to be given another look: Amendment 4.
Essentially, if passed, Amendment 4 would  al-
low voters to decide on any new local land plans or changes to local land plans rather than city councils.  
The group that put this on the ballot, “Florida Home-town Democracy,” wants to put more power into the voters’ hands when it comes to making community de-cisions. 
At first glance, I will admit I didn’t think this was 
such a bad idea, but then I started to do some research. 
First of all, how many people actually show up to 
midterm elections, even when the ballot contains im-portant issues? Not very many. 
That’s why Florida decided to open its polls weeks 
ahead of time, despite the increased cost. So the likeli-hood that there will be a large turnout, or even a turnout close to being representative of the area’s population is 
extremely unlikely.
Chances are the only people who would show up to 
these elections are those who have a stake in the land-
use plan. 
And often, people who don’t go to city council meet-
ings will not even know the positives of a plan. What’s likely going to happen is all the plans for moderniza-tion and new business construction are going to be shut down before they can ever take off.
With both governer candidates 
having economic plans involving attracting new businesses to Flor -
ida, why would we want to install an amendment that will probably 
just drive them away? 
Those opposed to Amendment 
4 have been saying the amendment will reduce Flori-
da’s economic output by $34 billion. 
While those numbers might be slightly inflated, you 
can be sure that the amendment would decrease our economic output in some respect, hurting our already weak economy. 
I understand the call for a purer democracy. Trust 
me, I do. Especially with the way the national Congress has been acting the past few years. But we have a repre-sentative democracy in America for a reason. The issues on the national stage get a lot of publicity, so we tend to know more about them. 
But there are still those who have no idea about the 
issues surrounding health care. There are even fewer people who can discuss major state issues. With only local publicity and less interest, how many people are 
actually going to understand the pros and cons of a lo-
cal land-use plan?
When an amendment is going to majorly hurt Flori-
da’s economy at a time when it is already fragile, I am at a loss to understand how anyone could vote “Yes” 
on the issue.

I admit — I wept when Jon Stew-
art announced “The Rally to Restore Sanity .” Since entering 
college, this girl, who once thought there were no such things as “stupid 
people,” had grown into the kind 
of person burdened with very real nausea at a glimpse of Fox News. Or any news program, for that matter. Any message board, too. Any pub-lic political dialogue that descended into arrogance and insanity — and so many do. The reaction frustrated me, and when Stewart called for a 
rally to encourage reasonableness 
and respect in public discourse, I felt my anxieties might be soothed.
My boyfriend and I traveled to 
Washington, D.C., for the rally. We arrived home Sunday with alarm-ingly swollen feet and legs. I’d hard-ly slept in three days. My head was throbbing. And for what? The Rally 
to Restore Sanity and/or Fear (as it 
had been re-dubbed after Stewart’s cause joined arms with cohort Ste-phen Colbert’s “March to Keep Fear Alive”) was an utter disappoint-ment. The usual sharp revelry of “The Daily Show” had been replaced with hackneyed sketch comedy and not-so-fresh interplay between Col-
bert and Stewart’s on-air personali-
ties. These scenes were prefaced and punctuated by a stream of throw-away celebrity guests and suddenly made somehow relevant by an hon-estly heartfelt, too-brief speech by Stewart — something I would have been happy to hear states away.
The truth is, I wasn’t even on site 
for Stewart’s address. I was blocks 
away by that time, waddling at top 
speed to the National Press Club where, I’d been informed, my un-canny likeness to MSNBC’s Rachel Maddow had landed me a front row seat for a post-rally Q-and-A with Stewart and Colbert. 
I attempted to devise an appropri-
ate question for at least one of these 
men promoting civility and reason. 
But, for some time, all I could come up with was: “Really, sirs, was it rea-sonable for me to drag my butt all this way from Central Florida, share a cramped bus with the world’s most obnoxious singing/cursing rabbi only to slog through a crowd of what seemed mostly upper-mid-
dle-class and wealthy white folks in 
order to attend this well-intentioned but ultimately sloppy sham of a his-torical event?”
I instead asked Stewart some-
thing about comedic boundaries. And, wonderfully enough, it was his and Colbert’s answers to a hand-ful of other questions that gave me 
what I needed to paint this experi-
ence as something worth my time. Both seemed genuinely fulfilled by their efforts, genuinely committed to what they had attempted to do with this rally and genuinely moved by the fact that so many (estimates are upwards of 250,000 people in atten-dance) chose to follow them on this journey , no matter how ill-planned or ill-fated. At one point during the conference, Stewart said: “I’m really proud that I’m a comedian. I think 
it’s hard. I think it’s hard to distill 
your most valued thoughts into comedy and to let things that you feel strongly about be the subtext for what you create.”
I have always agreed with that 
sentiment, which is why comics like Stewart have always been my rock gods. Comedians carry the muscle 
and charm necessary to get people 
swallowing and processing prickly ideas — it’s the spoonful of sugar making the medicine go down. 
Fact is, nothing like this event had 
been attempted by performers like these, or anyone really . This whole 
shebang was developed and per -
formed by people whose work and 
existence continues to give so many near-cynics (like me) real hope. 
No piece of popular art is perfect 
if and when it first presents contro-versial material to the masses. Lord knows “Uncle Tom’s Cabin” was full of problems. But if we acknowledge these less-than-perfect works as the precursor to real debate, it doesn’t matter how polished they are — just get your foot in that door.I still believe in the idea, as Stew-
art pointed out in his public address, that “these are hard times, not end times” and that if “we amplify ev-erything, we hear nothing.” What’s 
more, I believe in community sup-
port for those brilliant comedians who perform deceptively valuable, challenging snake-charming acts. 
Like in some huge, unnecessarily 
lavish wedding thrown by an oth-erwise lovable couple, there’s good reason to believe that the individu-als who invited me to this rally will never know I was there. But I feel, all in all, that I went because it’s the right thing to do. You support the people you love when they take risks, when they make an effort. 
Ironically enough, that sentiment 
might not always sound pragmatic. But at least I say it genuinely, pur -
posefully , respectfully , softly and without waving around some very big stick.  What more could gurus like Stewart and Colbert ask for?

alligatorSports.org UF SOCCER TEEING OFF WITH TYLER JETTBy JESSE SIMONTON
Alligator Writer
 
In 1995, Becky Burleigh started 
the Florida program not knowing 
what the future held. Flash for -
ward 15 years, and the soccer coach 
has built the Gators into a national powerhouse, winning 11 confer -
ence championships, including five 
straight after a win in Columbia, 
S.C.
While the other football team 
beat its annual rival from the north, 
the No. 8 Gators (15-2-2, 9-1-1 South-
eastern Conference) defeated their newfound adversaries, the No. 17 Gamecocks (14-4-2, 8-2-1 SEC), 1-0 on Friday, clinching the regular sea-
son conference championship and 
the fifth consecutive title for the Gators. 
“We knew it wasn’t going to be 
easy,” Burleigh said. “I think it was a great team win. [Winning the SEC title] is a different experience every single time, and they’re all unique, but it never gets old. Ever, ever.”
Jubilation rang in the postgame 
locker room, but no one was happier than the three seniors. Starters Katie Fraine (goalie), Ashlee Elliott (center 
back) and Nicky Kit (left back) pro-
pelled Florida to victory , insistent on not losing in their final regular-season SEC game.
While all three contributed to the 
team’s ninth shutout of the season, it was Kit who secured the victory in the final seconds of the first half.
After freshman Caroline Triglia 
maintained her composure follow-ing a run, Kit drilled a free kick with just two seconds left in the half for 
the only goal of the game. Following 
a South Carolina foul with less than 10 seconds remaining in the half, Triglia pleaded with the referee to

Gators clinch conference title
By MIKE McCALL
Alligator Staff Writer

JACKSONVILLE — Many things were shouted at Chris 
Rainey from the stands during Florida’s 34-31 win against 
Georgia on Saturday, some good and some bad.
But the reception he got on a postgame victory lap 
around EverBank Field left no doubt as to how Gators 
fans felt about his return.
Rainey received high-fives and plenty of “Welcome 
back” greetings, and when he reached the south end zone, 
a group of UF fans chanted his name, eliciting a bright, mile-wide smile from the junior.
Touchdown runs and that smile 
were Rainey’s trademark prior to recent events, when an aggravated stalking charge landed him a five-game suspen-
sion and the honor of being the butt of 
countless jokes for the “Time to die” text 
message he sent an ex-girlfriend on Sept. 14.
But Rainey took another step toward putting that inci-
dent behind him Saturday, when he ran for 84 yards and 
a touchdown on 16 carries in his return.
Rainey was not available for comment after the game 
and declined to answer questions on the field, but cen-ter Mike Pouncey said Rainey’s attitude was all gratitude when he addressed the team in the locker room.
“He thanked the whole administration                                                          Rainey makes

SEE SOCCER, p AGE 14
Wow, you can take a deep breath 
now. 
With a 37-yard field goal off 
the foot of punter Chas Henry, the Gators avoided a four-game losing steak and any 
possibility of Gainesville burning down. 
OK, I’m just kidding about that last part. 
But it is hard to think of a regular-season 
win bigger than this one in recent Gators history.
This victory didn’t just keep the SEC 
Championship in the realm of possibility, it gives this team something to reference back to in close games. It showed a young Gators 
team that it could escape a nail-biter with 
a win, unlike the losses to LSU and Missis -
sippi State.
Now, it’s important Florida doesn’t get ahead of itself. It still is not good enough to just win on talent alone. Make no mistake about it — Vanderbilt will beat UF if it heads into the game thinking about South Caro-lina. 
But here are three things you can take 
from the win:
 1. Rainey needs to stay at running back: 
The experiment of lining Chris Rainey up at wide receiver looks to be over. 
With running backs Mike Gillislee and 
Emmanuel Moody underperforming this season, the Gators need somebody to help Jeff Demps. Rainey is that guy. 
Running Trey Burton up the middle 
works so much better when defenses have to account for a speedster like Rainey running 
around the edge. Hence, a season-high 110 rushing yards for Bur -
ton against Georgia.
2. Defense can’t do 
it all: The UF defense 
has been looking like the strength of the 
team for much of the season.
And it still might 
be, but it has some holes. The secondary allowed 190 passing 
yards following halftime and cornerback Jeremy Brown was pulled for freshman 
Cody Riggs in the first half after a miserable 
start to the game.
The Gators’ defense is not going to shut-
down South Carolina or FSU, so UF’s offense will have to put on a performance similar to the one it displayed against Georgia.
3. Henry is the unsung hero of this team: 
I know he missed a game-tying field goal against Mississippi State, but you have to understand that is not even his job.
The fact that Henry knocked in a game-
winning field goal is amazing. If he is not 
on the team, freshman kicker Brad Phillips 
from Buchholz High is UF’s field goal kicker right now.
Also, Henry has helped the Gators com-
pete in the field position battle despite the of-fense’s struggles. He is averaging an NCAA-best 48.8 yards per punt this season.
But enjoy this win. This means Gainesville 
is happy again — even if it is just for a week 
or two.UF’s victory keeps Gainesville happy, teaches us three things

Tournament on Wednesday against Vanderbilt.back in the last three weeks.”
Recovery emerged as a theme 
even within the framework of the 
game. Moments before Henry hit 
the defining field goal, Florida’s de-
fense bounced back from a rough second half.
Getting a chance to strike first 
in overtime, Georgia quarterback Aaron Murray overthrew receiver A.J. Green on a post route, and the tipped ball found free safety Will 
Hill at the Florida 7-yard line.
Hill carried the ball deep into 
Georgia territory but was pushed 
out of bounds 4 yards shy of the goal line. Like Hill, most of his team-
mates and Florida fans thought he 
scored.
“I was probably cheering more 
than anybody for him to get in the 
end zone,” Henry said. “That puts 
a lot of pressure off me, off of every-body. That’s game over.”
But up until that point, Florida’s 
defense was reeling. Georgia scored 24 points and gained 254 yards on its first four drives after half time, tying the game on a 15-yard pass to 
Green with 4:36 left in regulation.
Green was for the most part held 
in check, gaining 42 yards on four 
catches. But tight end Orson Charles led all pass catchers with six catches 
for 108 yards, and Murray finished 
with three touchdown passes and a career-best 313 yards.
“That young guy’s going to be a 
really good player,” defensive coor -
dinator Teryl Austin said. “He made some throws, made some plays with his feet and he really jump-started 
them. Obviously, he has some really 
good weapons to throw to.”
But Murray struggled to protect 
the ball in the first half, throwing a 
pair of interceptions and fumbling 
once. And while the offense received 
a boost from Florida’s opportunis-tic defense, it also benefited from a heavy dose of freshman Trey Burton and the returns of juniors Jeff Demps 
(sprained left foot) and Chris Rainey 
(suspension).Burton carried the ball a season-
high 17 times and led all rushers with 110 yards, including a 51-yard touchdown run to give the Gators a 31-24 lead with less than seven min-
utes left.
“I’m so proud of our players,” of-fensive coordinator Steve Addazio said. “They battled. It’s not about 
anything but pulling together. We talk about being a family , staying together and believing it — that’s 
what happened with this group of 
guys.”14, ALLIGATOR � MONDAY, NOVEMBER 1, 2010

RaineyBurton has been the biggest bright spot for Florida’s offense this 
season, and his multifaceted game was on full display Saturday. Burton led all rushers with17 carries, eight more than his previous season high. He was also a consistent intermediate option in the passing game and even connected with receiver Omarius Hines on a 23-yard third-quarter pass. And his biggest run, a 51-yard touchdown in the fourth quarter, set the Gators up for overtime.

Hill’s overtime interception return ended after 89 yards, just 
four short of becoming a signature moment in the Florida-Georgia rivalry. Through the first seven games of the season, Hill had mostly earned headlines for his unofficial two-game suspension and underwhelming play. But the junior snagged his first two interceptions of the season, and both proved valuable. His first pick came on a tipped pass in the second quarter and set up Florida’s third touchdown of the game.

freshest legs on the field Saturday, and the Gators took advantage early. In Florida’s first four drives, Rainey either touched the ball or was the intended receiver on 11 of 23 plays from scrimmage, culminating in a 20-yard run to give the Gators a 7-0 lead. Having the threat of outside runs from Rainey and running back Jeff Demps  prevented the Georgia defense from loading the box.

FOOTBALL , from page 1Kit scored Gators’ only goal of game on free kick to beat Gamecocks
give UF the appropriate 10 yards for a free kick. As time ran 
out, the official stopped the clock to make sure South Carolina was properly set.
With a left-footed strike, Kit ripped the ball inside the front 
right post from about 25 yards away, clipping the white bar in the process. “I talked myself through it,” Kit said. “I thought of every-
thing Coach Vic [Campbell] has ever taught me: use your legs, don’t aim and kick it hard.
“In that moment when everything goes qui-
et, and I just knew it was going in. I just knew 
I was going to score and I think everyone else 
did too.”
The halftime momentum swung in the Gators’ favor, and they didn’t letup in the second half. Despite blowing multiple one-goal leads earlier in the season, Florida refused to have a letdown and never allowed South Carolina to get back into the game.
“We showed a lot of composure in the final few minutes, 
which is something we’ve struggled with obviously,” Burleigh said. “[Friday], we proved to ourselves we can win on the road when we’re holding a 1-0 lead.”SOCCER , from page 13
SoccerHarrison Diamond / Alligator Staff
Junior Chris Rainey ran for 84 yards and a touchdown against 
Georgia. His number was called on 10 of UF’s first 17 plays. 
Rainey rushed for score in second quarter
— [UF athletics director Jeremy Foley and UF Presi-
dent Bernie Machen] — and he thanked God as well,” Pouncey said. “He thanked everyone for giving him a 
second chance because without Jeremy Foley and Presi-
dent Machen, it wouldn’t be possible for him to play right now.”
After sitting out since Florida’s win against South 
Florida on Sept. 11, Rainey was anxious to get back on the field, and it was clear UF’s coaches felt the same way.
Of the Gators’ first 17 plays, 10 were designed for 
Rainey, and he also returned six kickoffs for 148 yards,  
his longest of which came at an opportune time.
After a 69-yard touchdown drive early in the fourth 
quarter cut Florida’s lead to 21-16, Rainey fielded a 
kickoff and bolted down the right sideline.  
The junior was pushed out of bounds a yard shy of 
midfield after a 45-yard return. Eight plays later, senior Chas Henry converted his first of two field goals to ex-
tend the Gators’ lead to 24-16.
After Rainey’s second-quarter touchdown run, a 20-
yard dash for the game’s first score, he knelt in the back of the end zone before being mobbed by teammates. 
Pouncey — whose family took Rainey in during high school — was one of the first to congratulate him.
“He had a great impact. He looked like — like I’ve 
been saying all year — the best player on our team,” 
Pouncey said. “I know that was one of the happiest mo-
ments of his life just to be out there with us playing.”
Rainey’s production dropped in the second half, but 
his presence on the field still made an impact. He most-
ly worked out of the backfield on runs to the outside, 
and UF coach Urban Meyer said that helped the inside 
run game. “The threat of a perimeter issue opens things 
up,” Meyer said. “If you have a threat of [running out-side], it sometimes opens [the middle]. That’s the mix of perimeter and interior rushing.”RAINEY , from page 13 “He had a great impact. He looked like — like 
I’ve been saying all year — the best player on 
our team. I know that was one of the happi -
est moments of his life just to be out there

JACKSONVILLE — Will Hill 
couldn’t breathe. 
He had just intercepted a 
tipped pass from Georgia quar -
terback Aaron Murray in over -
time and returned it 89 yards to 
the 4-yard line.
Laying on top of him was 
a pile of teammates who had 
cleared out Florida’s sideline thinking Hill had just scored to 
end the game. 
“It fell in my lap,” Hill said. 
“I had like 400 pounds on me. I 
thought I was in, I thought the 
game was over.”
The game wasn’t over yet, but 
Hill set the offense up, needing 
just a Chas Henry field goal to win.  
The safety subbed himself in 
and out of the game to stay fresh because he was battling a cold last week and didn’t feel 100 per -
cent. 
Whatever level Hill was oper -
ating on in Saturday’s 34-31 win over the Bulldogs was more than enough for him to anchor the 
Gators’ defense. 
Murray set a career high for passing yards (313) against UF’s 
secondary, which allowed 166.6 passing yards per game — good 
for second in the Southeastern 
Conference — coming into this week. 
UGA also had two receivers 
rack up more than 100 yards and gained 101 yards on the ground behind Washaun Ealey and Caleb King. 
But Hill’s defensive unit made 
just enough big plays to come away with a win. 
Hill’s over -
time intercep-
tion was his 
second of the game, as the ju-nior also picked off Murray on a 
tipped pass in 
the second quar -
ter. He also intercepted a pass on a two-point conversion attempt 
in the fourth, but it did not count 
on the stat sheet because it came on an extra-point scenario.
“We’ve been waiting for that 
all year,” UF coach Urban Meyer said. “We’ve had some fantastic free safeties around here, fantas-tic. From Reggie Nelson and Ma-
jor Wright to now Will Hill, he 
played very well tonight.”Defensive coordinator Teryl 
Austin, who coached the second-
ary for the Arizona Cardinals 
before joining the Gators this season, has been openly critical of Hill many times this season, saying the highly touted pros-
pect had yet to blossom into the 
player he can be.
But Austin had nothing but 
praise for Hill after Saturday’s 
effort. 
“You saw it today, he played 
like a Florida safety plays,” Aus-
tin said. “He did a great job out there today and I’m very proud 
of him.”
Austin and the defense got an-
other big play from a UF safety 
when Ahmad Black, who once 
again led the team in tackles, 
forced a fumble while sacking Murray in the first half. 
Linebacker Jelani Jenkins 
recovered the ball at the UGA 
39-yard line and returned it 10 
yards. The Gators capitalized on the short field with a Jeff Demps touchdown run six plays later to 
take a 14-7 lead.
 “When you start talking about 
short fields and scoring the way 
we scored, a lot of that was where the defense gave the ball to the of-
fense,” Meyer said. “We’ve been 
doing the opposite, we’ve been giving other teams short fields and that’s been awful.”Hill plays best game of season

Freshman point guard Scottie Wilbekin will likely be 
out 7-10 days after suffering a neck strain in Wednesday’s 
92-58 exhibition win against Florida Tech, coach Billy Donovan said Friday.
The injury occurred with about 8:25 remaining in the 
first half, when Wilbekin and a Florida Tech player col-
lided during a scramble for a loose ball. 
“At this time of the year, what we would probably do 
is side on caution because these games are not counting,” 
Donovan said. “I’d like to have him out there, but I don’t 
want to push him too much where if he 
gets hit or banged then all of a sudden 
now we’re in a situation where he’s out another ten days.”
Wilbekin checked in the game at the 
16:33 mark of the first half and notched 
an assist on his opening possession.
Later, Wilbekin forced the second of his two steals and 
found Chandler Parsons with a behind-the-back pass for 
an uncontested dunk.
“His first stint that he came in I could tell that he was 
a little nervous,” Donovan said. “When he came out and then went back in the second time he actually had a really, really good period.”
Wilbekin is expected to miss Florida’s Nov. 3 exhibi-
tion game against Georgetown (Ky.) College, but he is on 
schedule to return for the Nov. 12 season opener against 
UNC-Wilmington.Wilbekin to sit out
