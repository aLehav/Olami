In response to a string of armed robberies, the 
Gainesville Police Department will deploy 25 more 
officers per shift in an attempt to not only catch rob-
bers faster but also deter them from committing the crimes.
The extra officers have been 
taken from almost every depart-ment within the agency, includ-ing personnel, training and ad-ministration.
Interim Chief Tony Jones and 
Maj. Rick Hanna decided this would be the best way to combat 
the recent uptick in robberies, said GPD spokesman 
Keith Kameg
Last weekend there were about 12 robberies in 
Gainesville with six of them occurring Friday night. 
So far this year, there have been about 50 more rob-beries than there were at this time in 2008, Kameg said.
Since Tuesday, there have been 35 to 50 officers 
patrolling per shift instead of the 18 to 25 officers normally on duty, Kameg said.Police up

� SMOKING AT GAMES WILL BE 
PROHIBITED STARTING SEPT. 5.
Football fans will have to find a 
new way to relieve stress when the 
Gators are trailing during a game.
The Ben Hill Griffin Stadium will 
kick off the campus-wide tobacco ban by prohibiting smoking, while all forms of tobacco will be banned 
at UF’s Health Science Center and all 
Shands HealthCare buildings as of Nov. 1.
As of the first home game, where 
the Gators will take on Charleston 
Southern University on Sept. 5, the 
Swamp will no longer offer its current four smoking areas and will become smoke free, said Chip Howard, asso-
ciate athletic director of operations at 
the University Athletic Association.
However, smokeless tobacco will 
still be allowed until July, when all of the UAA’s facilities will ban all forms 
of tobacco in order to adhere with 
UF’s campus-wide tobacco ban which will begin in July, Howard said.
He said the UAA decided to ban 
only smoking for the upcoming foot-ball season and not all forms of tobac-co because there haven’t been many problems with smokeless tobacco products, like chewing tobacco.
“More of the problems are with 
secondhand smoke,” Howard said.

Despite its recent ranking as the na-
tion’s No. 2 party school, UF was one of five 
schools named a 2009 Model of Alcohol or Other Drug Abuse Prevention Program on College Campuses by the U.S. Department of Education.
The College of Health and Human Per-
formance received a $100,000 grant to con-tinue its campus-wide alcohol abuse preven-tion program.
The program was rewarded for its “Less 
is More” campaign, featuring ads on buses that featured funny yet pointed messages like “Sketchy drunk guys… Making girls 
feel uncomfortable since 1853. Warning: 
Avoid guys who drink too much.”
The school’s prevention programs were 
classified as exemplary, effective or promising based partly on the num-ber of years the programs 
have been in place. UF’s program received a “promising” rating.
While the school has had an alcohol and 
drug abuse prevention program for a long time, program leader Virginia Dodd said until they received a $280,000 grant in 2006 from the U.S. Department of Education, they Swamp to ban smokeCollege wins $100K grantHarrison Diamond / Alligator Staff

After girl’s death, Fla. may forbid owning pythons
TALLAHASSEE, Fla. (AP) — Florida wildlife officials are con-
sidering a ban on possessing several large, nonnative reptile spe-
cies after a pet Burmese python killed a 2-year-old girl last month.
Col. Julie Jones, director of law enforcement for the Florida Fish 
and Wildlife Conservation Commission, discussed the option with Gov. Charlie Crist when he visited Wednesday for an update on a python hunt Crist requested following the girl’s death.
Jones said authorities are considering a ban on Internet sales of 
the snakes. The commission can adopt a ban on its own, but state and federal legislators also have talked about passing laws to pro-hibit such reptiles as pets.� Senior wide re -

Ahmadinejad sworn in as 
Iran’s president amid crisis
TEHRAN, Iran (AP) — Mah-
moud Ahmadinejad was sworn 
in to a second presidential term 
Wednesday with a call for the 
divided nation to “join hands,” 
but it was greeted by protests 
in the streets and snubs inside Iran’s parliament.
The oath-taking ceremony 
capped a cycle of outrage over 
claims of massive fraud in the 
June 12 elections and moved Iran into a new phase: A weak-ened leadership facing a wider opposition that includes pow-
erful clerics and internal splits 
among conservatives.
President Barack Obama has 
given Iran until next month to

“We’ve had a lot of ques-

how exactly does it ruin our

Supreme Court Justice Mi-

Yanuck’s comments to explain 
the importance of the act. 
“When you go to law school 
and take constitutional law, the 
right of privacy is one of the 
most fundamental rights we 
have as Americans,” Patrone 
said. “The courts have recog-
nized that, so don’t say FERPA 
is ruining people’s lives. It’s actually protecting them.” 
Several incoming senators 
and Senate meeting attendees 
expressed fond farewells and 
luck for those senators staying

Former Sen. Scott Cutshall

“Students don’t care about 
whether or not they can see an 
applicant’s resume,” he said. 
“They care about getting home safely from bars at night and 
getting a good degree.”
Father John Gillespie spoke

said he has followed the  UF Student Senate since he was a graduate student in 1968.

Car stolen from campus 
parking garage
A car was stolen from a park-
ing garage on the southern edge 
of campus Tuesday.
The car was left on the first 
level of Parking Garage 9, near the intersection of Archer Road and Gale Lemerand Drive, before 7 a.m, according to a University 
Police Department report. 
When the driver of the vehicle 
returned around 5 p.m., the car 
was gone, and there were shards 
of glass in the parking spot, ac-
cording to the report.
The car is a gold 1990 Olds-

STUDENT GOVERNMENT
Senators allot money to 
student organizations
Senators approved $1,971 in 
aid for student organizations in 
the last Student Senate meeting of the summer Tuesday.
The money will go to Shake-
speare in the Park, Gator 
Freethought, Word Up!, the Stu-
dent Safety Research Colloquium 
and UF’s Performing Arts. 
The majority of the money 
went to Shakespeare in the Park, which will feature a performance 
of the bard’s classic, “Much Ado 
About Nothing.” The $635 will go to set-building materials, cos-tumes and advertisements for the play, set for performances in 
March of 2010.
Shakespeare in the Park Pres-
ident Joseph Sweeney attended 
the meeting and performed a 
brief monologue to encourage 
senators to vote in favor of the allocation.
Sweeney said he hopes to 
donate about $3,000 of revenue 
from the play to A Spring of 
Hope, a charity that helps build 
wells in Africa. 
The Student Safety Research 
Colloquium received $256 to help 
continue its research on  health 
and safety issues in Gainesville. 
Upcoming research includes compiling statistics regarding 
the midtown bar area, the effects 
of hookah smoking and drinking behavioral strategies and conse-
quences.
“I’m sure you remember the 
people giving you pizza outside 
the bars and asking you about your blood alcohol level,” Sen. 
Thomas Hilton said. “That was 
these guys.”
The Family Educational 
Rights and Privacy Act has been a theme in several of the past 
meetings. With the passing of 
last week’s bill allowing senators to access applications online and the question of FERPA limita-tions, Sen. Alan Yanuck said he

 A sergeant with the University 
Police Department was asked to 
resign or be ﬁ  red last month after an internal investigation found he 
was guilty of hitting and kicking a 
man while off duty and likely lying about his actions to avoid charges.
Sgt. Christopher Avery, who 
opted to resign, was charged with one count of misdemeanor battery by the State Attorney’s ofﬁ  ce for the incident, which occurred in March.
The internal investigation was 
released last week. 
In June, Avery accepted a de-
ferred prosecution agreement with the state, a type of unsupervised probation that means he must abide by certain restrictions for six months. The charge will be dropped after six months if he has not violat-ed the restrictions. 
Michael Weaver, the other man 
involved in the incident, told inves-tigators he was driving home after work around 5:40 p.m. on March 24 when Avery, not in uniform, pulled up behind him on his motorcycle and began revving his engine to get Weaver to move out of the way.
After he moved out of the way, 
he said he got back into his original lane. Avery noticed this and pulled into the turn lane then got back into trafﬁ  c, pulled up to Weaver’s car and told him to pull over, Weaver said.
After the two pulled over, Weav-
er said, Avery looked like he want-ed to ﬁ  ght.
“It seem[ed] like he wanted me 
to take the ﬁ  rst swing at him,” he said.
Weaver said Avery then kicked 
him in the groin and threw two punches, the ﬁ  rst of which he ducked. The second punch landed between his right eye and temple.
Avery then jogged to his bike 
and drove off, Weaver said.
A witness recorded Avery’s li-
cense plate number, according to case records.
Avery refuted Weaver’s version 
of events, telling investigators that Weaver had been tailgating him, so he pulled into a turn lane and yelled for him to pull over so he could educate him about Florida’s trafﬁ  c laws.
When they pulled over, Avery 
said Weaver was screaming and cussing at him.
“[T]here was literally spit coming 
out of his mouth. He was screaming so loud,” Avery said, adding that he acted in self-defense, kicking the man once in the chest and attempt-ing to strike him two more times with an open hand after Weaver lunged at him.
“I did what I had to do to defend 
myself from this guy’s very aggres-
sive attacks on me,” he said. Avery 
said he then left on his motorcycle in order to avoid further attacks.
But statements from three wit-nesses of the events on the side of the road indicated that Avery was the aggressor.
“The guy on the motorcycle just 
— I just felt he was going to keep 
beating the crap out of him,” one 
witness told investigators.
Avery was placed on paid leave 
in mid-April pending investigation results.
“I think Mr. Avery was a good 
cop and could be a good cop again,” said his lawyer, Huntley Johnson. “I think he used bad judgment that 
day, and he was having a bad day.”
The investigation found that Av-
ery “exercised extremely poor judg-
ment” and took actions that “would lead one to believe that Sergeant Avery attempted to allude detec-tion and then falsify the facts of the incident.”
The investigation also found that 
although Avery notiﬁ  ed three lieu-tenants about the incident, it was not immediately brought to the at-tention of the chief of police. As a result, UPD Lt. Robert Wagner said, the three lieutenants involved were reprimanded.Avery’s is the only case in 2009 
that resulted in sustained charges against a UPD ofﬁ  cer.
There were three in 2008, includ-
ing the case of Ofﬁ  cer Keith Smith, 
who was punished for his involve-
ment in the egg-throwing incidents in the Porters neighborhood with Gainesville Police Department of-ﬁ  cers.
In another case, an ofﬁ  cer was 
found to have made questionable comments to a drunken, underage student at Jennings Hall in Septem-
ber.
The ofﬁ  cer was cited for inap-
propriate comments but was not 
disciplined.  
Another ofﬁ  cer received coun-
seling, but no discipline, for being rude and aggressive during a trafﬁ  c stop.
According to information pro-
vided by Lt. Wagner, complaints against UPD have fallen from 34 in 1995 to nine in 2008. He said the new police chief, Linda Stump, has a lot to do with the drop. 
“This chief expects more,” he 
said, “and she gets more.”

� THE CITY CURRENTLY PROVIDES 
FREE FIRE SERVICES TO UF. 
By THOMAS STEWART

 Hoping to make up for some of the $2.9 
million a year in free ﬁ  re service provided to 
UF, the city will use University Police Depart-ment ofﬁ  cers to help patrol late-night parties 
and the bars along University Avenue.
Maj. Brad Barber said the department will 
likely provide a handful of ofﬁ  cers to help the 
Gainesville Police Department with its Party Patrol unit and to police midtown bars.
The speciﬁ  cs of the arrangement are still 
being worked out, Barber said.
In a June 2008 letter to UF President Bernie 
Machen, Gainesville Mayor Pegeen Hanra-han suggested a ﬁ  re fee that would have been 
phased in over four years.
Machen responded by saying he could not 
agree to the proposal because of budget cuts.
Hanrahan’s letter was written when the 
city was considering a citywide ﬁ  re fee to pre-
vent cuts to the ﬁ  re department. The proposed fee was voted down.
Florida law would’ve exempted UF from 
the fee because the campus is government 
property, but the commission asked if the uni-versity would be willing to pay anyway.
Although the city has provided free ﬁ  re 
service to UF for years, some commissioners 
said they might eventually consider pulling the plug if UF didn’t start repaying the city.
“Ultimately, we may come… to the point 
where we need to say that we can’t do this any longer,” Com-missioner Craig Lowe said at a November commission meeting. 
“I hope that’s a point we never get to.”
According to city documents, UF account-
ed for 10 percent of Gainesville Fire Rescue’s non-medical responses in 2006.
Other state universities, like Florida State 
University and Florida Agricultural and Me-chanical University, pay ﬁ  re fees to their host cities.
City Manager Russ Blackburn said the ar-
rangement between UPD and GPD is a natu-ral one because of the existing cooperation be-tween the two agencies during football games 
and off-campus trafﬁ  c details.
It’s not clear yet how much UPD’s assis-
tance would be worth, he said, or whether it 
would come close to the $2.9 million price tag of its ﬁ  re services, he said, but at this point, the city is not looking at other forms of repay-ment.
He said the city is willing to be forgiving 
because it realizes UF has a signiﬁ  cant positive 
impact on the community.  UPD to offer GPD backup in exchange for ﬁ  re support

Chanel Munezero, a senior at UF, eagerly anticipates his 
annual road trip to Jacksonville for the UF-Georgia game, 
with or without tickets.
“It’s the time to not think about classes, go out and have 
fun. Of course you drink a lot; but it’s about having fun with a big group of people,” Munezero  said.
In July, The Florida Times-Union reported that UF Presi-
dent Bernie Machen, in a letter to the mayor of Jacksonville, called for reduction of the number of alcohol vendors and a 
prohibition of liquor shots.
Some students feel this defeats the point of traveling to 
Jacksonville for the game.
“It’s like going to a huge party and only having club 
soda,” Munezero said.
The UF-Georgia game is a rivalry dating back to 1915. 
In 1933, the game moved to Jacksonville, a middle ground 
for the Gators and Bull Dogs.“No doubt it’s a big piece of history. People think about it 
as an institution,” said Steve Orlando, a UF spokesman.
Some at the University of Georgia agree.Thomas Jackson, Student Affairs spokesman at Georgia, 
has not missed a game since 1973.
“The Georgia-Florida game has a great tradition. It’s a 
great part of being a Georgia student and Georgia fan,” he 
said.
However, the tradition encompasses more than the game 
itself, with nearly 100,000 fans, gathering at The Jacksonville Landing for pre-game tailgating and then again for a post-game party, earning the event the title of “The Largest Cock-tail Party in the World.”
In the past few years, both universities have insisted on 
ditching the title.
“We don’t use that, and we ask that people who are of-
ficially covering it don’t use it too. We would like to see that 
name disassociated with the event.”
Times  change, however, and presidents of both universi-
ties have struggled to reduce alcohol abuse.
Orlando feels that past tragedies require a change in the 
game.
“Sadly, a spate of student deaths that occurred in Jack-
sonville during Florida-Georgia game weekends during the 
past few years illustrate what can happen when alcohol is consumed irresponsibly,” he said.
Jackson agrees with Orlando’s views of alcohol consump-
tion.
“[Alcohol] plays too big of a role, as it generally does in 
college football. Abuse of alcohol is dangerous, and we wish it wasn’t so closely affiliated,” Jackson said.4, ALLIGATOR � THURSDAY, AUGUST 6, 2009

After 140 days of uncertainty, the fate 
of two American journalists has been de-
cided in a carefully orchestrated visit by 
former President Bill Clinton.
Laura Ling, 32, and Euna Lee, 36, left 
North Korea on a private jet with the for-mer president on Tuesday, according to an 
article in The New York Times.
“We were shocked,” Ling said in a 
press conference held Wednesday. “But 
we knew instantly in our heart that the 
nightmare of our lives was finally coming 
to an end, and now we stand here home and free.”
At UF’s College of Journalism and 
Communications, professors and students 
are relieved to know that they have protec-
tion even in foreign countries.
“I feel like it’s incredible that the U.S. 
is taking such initiative in our safety over-
seas,” said Katherine Laguna, a junior tele-
communications major. “I feel comfortable going overseas to report.”
Associate professor of journalism John 
Freeman reacted positively to the outcome 
of the North Korean conflict.
“It’s always scary when people are do-
ing their jobs and get accused of doing 
something else that’s wrong,” Freeman said. “I think it’s thrilling when you see them coming down the steps and thinking 
about what they had to endure for no rea-
sonable reason.”Study-abroad courses at UF are aimed 
to help students gain experience in work-ing outside of their comfort zone.
“Whenever we meet with foreign jour-
nalists in Berlin, they’ve always have a 
broad background in understanding other 
cultures,” Freeman said.
Each spring, Freeman takes 15 students 
to Berlin on a two-week trip to expand their knowledge of photography and learn 
how to work in an international setting.
“Being in Berlin is always exciting be-
cause at one time it was 
communist on one side,” 
Freeman said. “That 
thought is always there about the dangers.”
The College of Jour-
nalism and Communica-
tions offers classes such 
as World Communica-
tions and Problems and Ethics of Journal-ism in Society to help prepare students to 
work outside of the United States.
In an earlier interview, former USA To-
day Baghdad Bureau Chief Rick Jervis said 
the best way to learn how to internation-ally report is “just getting out there.”
The College of Journalism and Com-
munications will continue its study abroad opportunities with a trip to Brazil this fall.
“The whole concept of study abroad is 
something that Florida students should do so they can become global in their think-ing,” Freeman said. “A lot of people are too geared toward the USA only.”UF journalists react to

UF plans to install new cameras after armed robberies
�CAMERAS WILL BE NEAR 
STUDENT HOUSING.
By THOMAS STEWART
Alligator Staff Writer
tstewart@alligator.org
As a result of recent armed rob-
beries, UF plans to install cameras 
at Corry Village and Tanglewood 
Village, two graduate and family housing complexes.
It’s not yet clear how many cameras will be installed and how much they will cost, said Sharon Blansett, UF’s assistant director of 
housing. 
She declined to give estimates 
but said the money for the cameras would come from UF’s Depart-
ment of Housing and Residence Education budget, which generates 
its own revenue, meaning nothing 
will come from UF’s state-funded budget.
Though no installation date is set, Blansett said, they will likely go up after the start of the fall se-mester because the housing staff is 
currently focused on getting ready 
for the flood of fall 
students, she said.
The department 
currently has cameras 
installed at other housing units, 
but Blansett declined to say which 
units had cameras or how many cameras are operational.
“[With] some of the best pro-grams related to surveillance, you don’t necessarily announce the locations of the cameras to every-
one,” she said.
The camera installation follows 
two recent armed robberies at the housing complexes, one at Corry 
Village last month and one at Tan-glewood Village in December.
At Corry Village, located at 
Village Drive and Museum Road, a student was walking from the 
parking lot to his apartment when a man with a gun demanded his 
car keys, according to the Univer-sity Police Department.
The student refused to give up 
his keys, so the man stole cash and a cell phone instead.
At Tanglewood Village, 2901 
SW 13th St., a married couple was robbed at gunpoint moments after 
they returned to their apartment, 
according to UPD. 
Two suspects stole their wallets 
and cell phones.

from Nature for LifeTHE ASSOCIATED PRESS
NEW YORK (AP) — The American 
Psychological Association declared 
Wednesday that mental health profes-sionals should not tell gay clients they can become straight through therapy 
or other treatments.
In a resolution adopted by the 
APA’s governing council, and in an 
accompanying report, the association issued its most comprehensive repudi-ation of “reparative therapy” — a con-cept espoused by a small but persistent group of therapists, often allied with religious conservatives, who maintain 
gays can change.
No solid evidence exists that such 
change is likely, says the resolution, 
adopted by a 125-4 vote. The APA said some research suggests that efforts to produce change could be harmful, inducing depression and suicidal ten-dencies.
Instead of seeking such change, the 
APA urged therapists to consider mul-tiple options — that could range from celibacy to switching churches — for helping clients live spiritually reward-ing lives in instances where their sexual orientation and religious faith conﬂ  ict.
The APA had criticized reparative 
therapy in the past, but a six-member task force added weight to this position 
by examining 83 studies on sexual ori-
entation change conducted since 1960. Its report was endorsed by the APA’s governing council in Toronto, where the 150,000-member association’s an-
nual meeting is being held this week-
end.
The report breaks new ground in 
its detailed and nuanced assessment of how therapists should deal with gay clients struggling to remain loyal to a religious faith that disapproves of ho-mosexuality.
Judith Glassgold, a Highland Park, 
N.J., psychologist who chaired the task force, said she hoped the document could help calm the polarized debate between religious conservatives who believe in the possibility of changing sexual orientation and the many men-tal health professionals who reject that option.
“Both sides have to educate them-
selves better,” Glassgold said in an interview. “The religious psychothera-
pists have to open up their eyes to the 
potential positive aspects of being gay 
or lesbian. Secular therapists have to 
recognize that some people will choose their faith over their sexuality.”
In dealing with gay clients from 
conservative faiths, says the report, 
therapists should be “very cautious” 
about suggesting treatments aimed at altering their same-sex attractions.
“Practitioners can assist clients 
through therapies that do not attempt to change sexual orientation, but rath-er involve acceptance, support and 
identity exploration and development 
without imposing a speciﬁ  c identity outcome,” the report says.
“We have to challenge people to be 
creative,” said Glassgold.
She suggested that devout clients 
could focus on overarching aspects of religion such as hope and forgiveness to transcend negative beliefs about ho-mosexuality, and either remain part of their original faith within its limits — for example, by embracing celibacy — or ﬁ  nd a faith that welcomes gays.
“There’s no evidence to say that 
change therapies work, but these vul-nerable people are tempted to try them, and when they don’t work, they feel doubly terriﬁ  ed,” Glassgold said. “You should be honest with people and say, ‘This is not likely to change your sexual orientation, but we can help explore what options you have.’”

 A new study shows people who witness co-work-
ers being rude to each other experience the same ef-
fect as the people toward whom the rude behavior 
is directed.
Amir Erez, an associate professor of management 
at UF, and Christine Porath, a professor from the 
University of Southern California, conducted three 
experiments that each showed the same result of ob-
servers becoming less able to think creatively and solve problems.
In the study, participants ob-
served a fellow student being repri-
manded for arriving late to class while participants in the control group only saw a tardy student be dis-missed from class.
Those who witnessed the rude behavior toward 
a student were less able to recall information and found less creative uses for a brick.
Michael Lillie, 46, Weimer Hall building super-
visor, said the study is representative of his work-
place.
“[Rudeness] puts you in a bad mood,” he said. 
“It’s not professional.”

Nudity should be embraced, not taboo
69% YES31% NOToday’s question: Would you wear your birthday suit to take out the trash?Monday’s question: Does UF have the right to ban smoking on campus?Sunday nights, trash nights, before I roll the garbage out 
to the curb, I strip off all my clothes and leave them in a little pile on the bench by the front door. Naked, I ap-
proach the street with the garbage can, which smashes the grass under its weight. It’s one of the busiest streets in Akron, 
Ohio, during the day. But come 2 a.m., traffic is sparse. After 
the can is in position on the curb, I don’t hurry back to my pile of clothes. Instead, I pace the dew-soaked grass, and I let the night air touch all the parts of my body it normally can’t.
Normalcy. In psychological terms, this word governs our 
existence in America. It’s the argument-ending phrase every parent employs with a child who is asking nuisance ques-tions, “Because, that’s how it is.” It is the understood way of doing things, and if a person decides to go against those 
societal customs, they are not normal.
Nudity has always been a normal part of humanity. Gen-
erally speaking, art, fashion, literature and documentaries 
about indigenous tribes throughout the world illustrate that point. Not until the Puritans landed in America and founded a country based on a strict moral code has nudity become taboo. That status has held through the centuries. Conse-quently, being naked in America is not normal.
Here we are, living in a polarized America over the topic 
of nudity. In June 2008, The Associated Press reported an up-rising of anti-nudist activity in a Vermont beach town where visitors enjoyed being naked at the beach. The reason for petitioning to have a law enacted that would ban nudity at the beach: It’s “about common public decency,” said Tony Strange, a Vermont man who started the petition. If a cop saw me partake in my Sunday ritual, fines and a night in jail could be a reality because of Ohio’s Public Indecency law, which prohibits me from exposing my private parts.
This summer, children were dragged into the nudity de-
bate. Innocent, naked children hoping to escape the summer heat by stripping down and running through the sprinkler were made objects of parents’ bantering in The New York Times article “When do they need a fig leaf?” The conflict presented in the article pits the be-lief that nudity is a natural expres-sion of freedom that captures the essence of childhood against the 
notion that nudity is an affront to civility, a source of discom-
fort and an invite for pedophilic attention.
The article’s conflict is a great summation of the compet-
ing viewpoints in our society. Nudists and naturists believe 
being naked is a healthy form of expression, allowing oneself to develop a comfort level with his or her body while de-veloping a stronger relationship with the natural world. The proper, clothed folks believe that being naked is a degenera-tive behavior that slaps civility and decency in the face.
Too many problems in our society come from how the 
American public discourse addresses topics like nudity. Porn is rampant. Advertising messages are more provocative ev-ery year. People feel shame and discomfort about their bod-ies. I don’t think this is acceptable.
Because nudity is taboo, it is exploitable. People get off on 
nudity alone. Show the average American man a sculpture of Aphrodite, I’ll bet he gets aroused. That is a problem. Being hush-hush about nudity doesn’t help anything. It only fur-thers the idea that nudity is wrong or purely sexual.
I don’t want to live in a naked society. But, every once in a 
while, people should embrace nudity outside to feel the posi-tive effects nakedness can have. If you’re camping, sit around the fire naked with your friends and just talk. If you’re swim-ming, be the first person to twist your trunks above your head, hollering loudly, and toss them 10 yards away. And if you’re taking out the trash at night, get naked and do it. The air really does feel amazing against every inch of skin.
If a car happens to drive by, maybe the headlights will 
catch a piece of exposed flesh. The driver will pass by think-ing, “Did I just see some nakedness?” And you can walk back to your clothes near the front door wearing only a smile.

Change is afoot in Gainesville right now. All it takes 
is one look at the Alligator parking lot full of cars crammed with clothes, kitchen utensils and random 
boxes to know that summer is coming to an end, and every-one is ready to begin anew in his or her freshly leased pads. 
But, before you get too excited (and crumple up this paper to 
use as packing material), we would like to present you with an are-there-really-only-two-weeks-until-fall edition of...
Darts & Laurels
Despite the fact that Bill O’Reilly, Glenn Beck and Sean 
Hannity all managed to find something wrong with the fact that Bill Clinton saved Laura Ling and Euna Lee from 12 years of hard labor in North Korea, the Department of Darts & Laurels is going to go out on a limb and extend a don’t-
worry-every-sane-person-knows-this-is-a-good-thing LAU-
REL to former President Clinton for taking on the mission. 
Sometimes having dinner with our parents can be a daunting 
task of exchanging forced pleasantries, so it’s hard to imagine having to wine and dine a notorious dictator while pretend-ing to be into it. All we can say is: true American hero.
Speaking of true American heroes, apparently a G.I. Joe 
movie is coming out Friday. We have a hard time imagin-ing to whom this movie is marketed (is it to kids too young 
to ever hear of G.I. Joe or to adults who shouldn’t go see a 
movie that looks like it’s for a 10-year-old? Who are the mar-keting wizards who came up with this one?) But Paramount Pictures has made it clear that the movie certainly isn’t for critics. For trying to protect what it knows is going to be an awful movie by not releasing it for critical review, we would like to throw a couldn’t-you-just-release-a-not-terrible-prod-uct DART at Paramount Pictures. Way to be a bunch of sis-
sies. We’re sure that Joe would disapprove. 
Although it may seem like blasphemy, the Department of 
Darts & Laurels would like to extend a DART at UF for pay-
ing Urban Meyer $4 million per year to continue to coach UF football. At a time fraught with tuition increases and dropped programs, we are forced to question why a football coach is getting a raise. We understand that football brings a lot of money to the university, but wouldn’t it still bring in money if Meyer were only making, say, $1 million per year? If Meyer loved UF as much as he claims, wouldn’t it make 
sense to act in the best interest of its students and faculty? 
Not to mention that getting paid $1 million per year for a job that awesome wouldn’t be so bad…
To address questions about the proposed health care re-
form bill making its way to the Senate, a number of town hall-style meetings have popped up across the country. But, instead of getting Americans’ questions answered (as was the intent), the meetings have turned into a series of disas-ters. For squashing all meaningful debate, the Department 
of Darts & Laurels would like to throw a this-is-nearly-as-
dumb-as-the-”birther”-movement DART at lobbyists who 
have infiltrated the meetings, and according to a leaked memo from the lobbyist-run group FreedomWorks (also known for their Tea Party protests), have been instructed to “artificially inflate their numbers,” to “rattle the speakers” and to not “have an intelligent debate.” When meetings such as these become co-opted by special interest groups and duly elected members of Congress are not allowed to speak, 
meaningful discourse is disrupted. In a country like the U.S., 
that is downright shameful. 
For the students and residents of Gainesville who have 
cowered in terror over the recent string of armed robberies in the area: help is coming. Gainesville Police Department is saturating the areas where the crimes have occurred. For its efforts to protect the residents of Gainesville, the Depart-ment of Darts & Laurels would like to extend a we’ve-been-bashing-you-recently-but-this-is-starting-to-make-up-for-it 
LAUREL to the GPD and, more specifically, to police dog 
Rua, for tracking down a car thief and apprehending him. 
That’s all for now. Enjoy your two-week respite and see 
you in the fall.

 It has been my secret dream for three 
years now to hijack my commence-ment speech. I had the perfect plan. 
There was just one problem; there will be no big-name speaker. When I learned this, 
it hurt. Because, Gators, there are issues we 
must discuss.
We’ve learned things.We know to question authority — un-
less they have Tasers.
We’ve found that nobody can promise 
the impossible, with the exception of Tim Tebow. And we have grown from wide-eyed, impressionable and confused fresh-
men to weathered Titletown veterans. We 
know the hot spots in town, whose couch to crash on and where to get the best any-thing. We’ve seen University Avenue not only from the backs of cars but from the tops of roofs and light poles.
We take with us four national champi-
onships and the dubious distinction of be-ing the top party school. Let the supersti-
tious know — we did our part to keep the 
bricks of Century Tower inviolate (and not much else). Let the prudes know — we’ve banned smoking (and if Bernie Machen has his way, all fun). And let Ohio State know that — well, they know.
We’ve seen some of the most historic changes in our country’s history — foremost, Mr. Two Bits’ retirement, 
with Obama’s election a close second.
We’ve battled Guitar Hero, Halo, late-
night poker and the very world (of War-craft) itself just to get to class each day.
We’ve done big things, as both individ-
uals and as a university.
But that is not our virtue. We are gath-
ered here because of what we will do.
Many of you remember that ridiculous 
advertising campaign for UF back in 2006: 
“Go start a Fortune 500 company!” “Go 
cure cancer!” “Go to Mars!” No pressure.
It’s almost too much responsibility for 
a person to bear. But when looking at the bright, passionate students all around you, it is hard to not be optimistic.
John Donne once wrote, “No man is an 
island.” Perhaps the weight, our charge, is not meant to be borne alone. We are lifted 
here on the support of our loved ones and 
families; we shall rise to the next challenge with the fellowship of our peers.
So, graduates, never send to know for 
whom the Gator growls; it growls for thee. Go class of 2009! Go Gators!

Smokers need to collect their butts
 Thank you for your editorial piece 
“Campus ban removes smokers’ rights.” 
However, it neglects to mention one of the main problems with smokers: the fact that they just throw their butts on the ground 
no matter where they are at. 
Their littering is a constant eyesore (not 
their “right”). Now, many would prefer 
they be given hefty ﬁ  nes (and possible jail time) every time they cavalierly ﬂ  ick their butts onto the ground, but a complete ban seems to be the easiest way to control this form of littering.

Cronyism still permeates SG
 My name is Frank, and I used to be a 
senator. For the past 12 weeks, I served as a replacement senator in the Student Senate, and my term ended last Tuesday at the end of the last Senate summer session meeting.
However, this was not how I wanted 
my term to end.  For the past two weeks, my application 
to ﬁ  ll one of the two vacant permanent seats 
for my district has sat in Senate President 
Pro-Tempore Suzanne Hershman’s box as I waited to be approved as a permanent senator, allowing me to continue to serve until the fall elections.  
For the past two weeks, the seats have 
remained vacant, and I haven’t been inter-viewed to ﬁ  ll them. One week ago, Suzanne assured me I would get an interview this 
week. I still have not been interviewed.
Suzanne was asked Tuesday about why 
the seats are still open. She said there was 
only one applicant (me) and that they were looking for more applicants before ﬁ  lling the seat. As a student senator, I attended countless committee meetings, worked with Gainesville Police Department to keep students safe and orchestrated the 
largest ﬁ  nance reform Student Senate has 
ever seen. I have difﬁ  culty seeing how I am less qualiﬁ  ed than these empty seats. 
It is clear to me now that “Green Means 
Go” cronyism is still present in UF’s Stu-dent Government today, and I was merely a victim of it.

The Harvest of Hope Foundation will host 
its first-ever Vegan Chili Cook-off from 1 to 8 
p.m. at The Kickstand, a community bicycle shop, 722 S Main St. 
More than 20 different vegan chilies will 
be prepared by individuals, teams and local restaurants such as The Top, Jones, Boca Fi-esta, Booklover’s Cafe and Volta, according 
to event organizer Mike Ferrell.
The cook-off will also feature arts, crafts, 
ice cream and acoustic performances. At-
tendees are encouraged to bring their own bowls and spoons to reduce waste. An after-party for the benefit will take place at The Atlantic, 15 N Main St. 
Local bands such as Whiskey and Co., 
New Bruises, Towers of Hanoi and Hot Graves will perform. Tickets are $8 for at-tendees under 21 and $6 for those old enough to drink. The show starts at 9:30 p.m.
The event will raise money for the Har-
vest of Hope Foundation, which provides emergency and educational aid to migrant farm workers. 
After Ferrell and a friend from Harvest of 
Hope judged a vegan chili cook-off a couple of years ago, he decided it would be a great way to raise money for the organization. 
“We thought it was spectacular. We 
thought that we could get more people in-volved and do it for charity,” he said. Chili challenge to benefit 
migrant farm workers
had not had much success curbing 
student drinking.
This year’s $100,000 grant will go 
toward ads around campus, further research to evaluate the program’s efforts and continuing the CORE Drug and Alcohol Survey, which collects data on student drug and al-cohol consumption, Dodd said. “We’re very excited to have this 
opportunity,” she said. “It says to 
other schools, ‘Hey, look at what 
they’re doing.’ Hopefully our efforts 
can help others.”    
Program researchers also plan 
to begin studying the effectiveness 
of the taxi stands in downtown 
Gainesville that provide students 
an alternative to driving drunk and 
examine the alcohol concentration 
levels in underage drinkers using breathalyzers.  
Dodd said the program began 
research in 2006 to find student per-spectives on alcohol consumption, 
and by 2008, the high-risk drinking 
rate had fallen by 7.6 percent. 
The program also evaluated past 
prevention techniques and looked 
at the difference between game-day 
drinking and everyday drinking to 
decide on its student-guided ads.  
“So far, our research has found that the number of UF students who 
are participating in binge drinking is 
low compared to the number of stu-
dents who attend UF,” Dodd said in 
a release. “I think there is a miscon-
ception that UF is a ‘party school.’”
UF advertising sophomore Leah 
Harrison agreed that while UF de-
serves its party school status, its rep-
utation doesn’t mean that students 
are careless about drinking. 
“It’s ironic, I guess,” Harrison said. “But just because we’re a good 
party school doesn’t mean [we drink 
carelessly]. Maybe we’re just smart 
about it.” 
The University of California, 
Santa Barbara and University at Al-bany/State University of New York, 
were named effective programs, 
while the University of North Caro-
lina Wilmington and University of 
West Florida were named promis-
ing programs.AROUND GAINESVILLE

curring on or near Southwest 20th Av-
enue, Kameg said.
Known by police as the Juliet zone, 
the area was annexed to Gainesville on 
June 1. Since then, Kameg said there 
have been about 15 robberies in that zone. Ten of them occurred over the past weekend. 
“We will be in zero-tolerance mode 
in that area,” he said
Most of the newly deployed officers

crease of robbers in that area targeting 
Hispanics.GPD will request $40,000 from the 
Gainesville City Commission for the 
department’s state forfeiture account, 
which is made up of money the depart-ment recovers from drug investiga-tions, Kameg said.
“We do not want to 
use any of the taxpay-er’s dollars to fund this surge,” he said.
Kameg said the incident that 
sparked the surge occurred last week when a 71-year-old man was attacked in his yard, brought into his house and bound to a chair with duct tape. The robbers then rummaged through his belongings.GPD to request $40K for force

 Ashley Tisdale  
“Guilty Pleasure”
Ashley Tisdale 
is all grown up and 
ready to be every-one’s favorite new bad girl. Her new al-
bum opens with a chorus that wails “Set me free. It’s time to get dirt. It’s another side of me, I’m acting out.” However, it’s a far cry from original. Upon ﬁ  rst listen, Tisdale’s latest can easily be mistaken as a release from former teen pop-sensation Ashlee Ni-cole Wentz, aka. Ashlee Simpson.   Modest Mouse   
“No One’s First 
and You’re Next”
 They’ve put out 
three records since “Float On” took over the charts in 2004, 
and it’s a mystery why more people don’t talk about Modest Mouse. Their latest release picks up right where they left off with “We Were Dead Before the Ship Even Sank,” bringing an addicting mixture of country and folk inﬂ  uenced sounds to the table.

 Caitlin Nicole Eadie has more in common with Hannah 
Montana than she’d ever like to admit.
Just like the country music superstar on the hit Disney show, 
16-year-old Eadie is an All-American high school girl. She gets 
good grades, takes advanced placement classes and wants to go to law school one day. She has a high school sweetheart, and she’s on a ﬁ  rst name basis with all her neighbors in her 
hometown of Lake City.
Weekends, however, are a completely different story. 
Then she can be found on any given stage in Florida sing-
ing country songs with her acoustic guitar. 
Eadie said she’s shy and introverted, but all that goes away 
when she steps on stage to sing. 
Her mother has two names for her — The hazel-eyed, 
bleached-blond teenager is Caitlin, and the ﬁ  ery performer with the “old soul” and concrete voice is Nicole.
“It gives me a rush. Whether I’m singing for my parents or 
a bunch of people at a stadium it just gives me the best feel-ing,” she said. “Nothing else I do gives me that feeling. It’s never enough. I’m addicted to singing.”
Eadie doesn’t share the details of her double life with her 
high school friends. She’s worried that they won’t accept her, or they’ll be critical.
“There are really exciting things going on, and I just prefer 
to keep it to myself,” she said. “I just want to do what I do and 
enjoy it and not have everybody telling me what they think 
about it.”Eadie’s popularity as a country singer is rapidly growing. 
Her MySpace music page has 25,437 friends, she’s on the cover of the current issue of Muse Revolution Magazine,  and she re-
cently moonlighted as an anchor for “American Music Video 
Network,” a 24-hour country music channel. 
Even though  Eadie is only 16, her love for country music 
started when she was much younger. 
As a girl, Eadie heard her grandfather play a cassete tape of 
“I Will Always Love You,” by LeAnn Rimes.
She was blown away by the power and range of Rimes 
voice and was inspired to start singing herself.
That Christmas, her father bought her a “an old clunker of 
a karaoke machine. The kind with the speaker on it and the corded microphone.” 
She would lug it around the house and sing her little heart out 
to anyone who would listen. Her parents quickly intervened.    “Basically my mom said, ‘Listen, Caitlin. You can’t be going around the house singing like that. You’re gonna have to get voice lessons or something,’” Eadie said.
She took voice lessons for a month but lost interest when 
her teacher tried to steer her toward Broadway singing.
“My heart was in country music,” she said. “I just wasn’t 
interested in anything else at the time.”
Eadie said singing was not easy at ﬁ  rst, but her desire to get 
better, instilled in her by her parents, drove her to keep trying 
no matter what.
“It was not a natural thing for me,” she said. “It was hard, 
hard work.”
These days, Eadie has a debut CD, “Country Girl,” in 
which she co-wrote four of the 10 songs. She performs about 60 shows per year at various festivals and fairs, and she has 
opened for Tim McGraw and Jason Aldean, two of country music’s biggest superstars. She said being a country girl is all about attitude.  
“I just live in a regular house with a bunch of neighbors. 
But the thing is, I’m country,” she said. “The way I talk. The way I sing. I’ve just been around it for so long. It’s how I carry myself.”
Eadie will bring her particular brand of country music to 
the Gainesville Downtown Plaza, 111 E. University Ave., for the “Free Fridays” concert series where she’ll be playing a mix of cover songs and original material. The show starts at 7 p.m.
Eadie said people can expect some high-octane country ex-
citement, and they should be ready to have some fun.
“I can’t describe it. You have to come see it for yourself,” 
she said.  music

“Gloriana”
Gloriana’s debut 
infuses the elements 
of twangy-traditional country with a hefty dose of booming pop 
hooks and echoing harmonies. “Gloriana” will make Carrie Underwood and Sugar-land fans rejoice while Willie Nelson and Waylon Jennings’ followers are cringe from how far from traditional country this release actually is.  
“Basically my mom said, ‘Listen Caitlin, 
you can’t be going around the house singing like that. You’re gonna have to get voice lessons or something.’” 
CAITLIN NICOLE EADIE
singerThe Sunday afternoon perfor-
mance of “Peter Pan” opened its cur-
tains to a sold-out crowd of children, parents and those young and old who just don’t want to grow up.
The play begins with the Darling 
children, Wendy, John and Michael, getting ready for bed while Mrs. Dar-ling frets to her husband about a dirty little boy she has seen in and around the nursery. 
Mr. Darling dismisses her con-
cerns but is forced to believe her when she shows him the “shadow” 
the little boy left behind — a surpris-
ingly realistic, mesh-looking cutout.
The parents go off to their dinner 
party after making sure Nana, the family dog, the children’s unofficial “nurse” and the only one who seems to actually care about the kids’ safety, is chained up outside, unable to pre-vent any little boy intruders from 
breaking in. 
After the parents are gone, Peter 
Pan, played by UF grad Loren Omer, 
predictably returns to the nursery in search of his shadow. Wendy wakes up, befriends Pan and the story that most of us know and love continues on routinely — flying to Neverland, meeting the Lost Boys and eventually 
defeating Captain Hook.
What is not routine is the way that director Erin Kleim executes J.M. 
Barrie’s classic.
The sets, costumes and acting are 
much better than you would expect from a community theater. The dirty, 
exaggerated outfits of the pirates and 
the Lost Boys are a bit over the top, but it works. Pan’s costume is classic and effectively hides the fact Peter is a woman. Hook’s ensemble is more 
flamboyant, though, and makes it pretty hard to take him seri-ously as a villain. 
I expected to 
wince every time someone spoke in the more-than-two-hour production, but the British accents also exceeded expectations — especially for Omer, who was not only pretending to be British but to be a young boy as well.
Overall, the production is well 
done and “Pan” fans will enjoy the 
retelling. 
Though you should be prepared 
for mildly abrupt booing from the 
children (and some adults) in the crowd each time the pirates or Hook appears on stage. 
“Peter Pan” will be performed at 
the Vam York Theatre, 4039 NW 16th Blvd., through Aug. 9. Showings are 
Wednesday through Saturday at 8 
p.m. and Sundays at 2 p.m.UF continues to lead its students out from 
the Swamp and straight into success. 
From broadcasting on ESPN to winning 
Heisman trophies, Gator students prove their success through athletics, scholarship, and perhaps less recognized, their fashion sense.  
In the New York offices of Hachette Fili-
pacchi Media, the world’s largest magazine publisher, UF alumni Kate Cavanna holds the title to Assistant Managing Editor at Elle.com. 
After graduating from UF in 2006, Ca-
vanna made a quick transition to the city. A former advertising major and retail associate, she searched for a job in the city’s publishing industry, unaware that the opportunity of her dreams would be riding the subway.
What is now a flourishing career for Ca-
vanna began with a fellow subway rider wear-ing a Gators sweatshirt. 
“Go Gators!” said Cavanna, approaching 
the girl who seemed to be about her age. 
True to the Gator Nation’s widespread 
presence and plentiful pride,  the fellow Gators chatted about their beloved community. 
When it could have been the end of the 
conversation, Cavanna asked, “Where do you work?” 
Much to her delight, the woman worked 
in the human resources department of Condé Nast, a major publishing company.
“Lightbulb!” thought Cavanna.An ordinary transit turned into business’, 
when the two exchanged contact information.  Cavanna followed up and stayed in contact 
every week or two, checking for any job open-
ings. 
Shortly after, she snagged a job writing for 
Brides.com, one of Condé Nast’s publications.
“It is all about networking and who you 
know in this marketplace,” Cavanna said. “You can’t be afraid to reach out to people you don’t know.”
Cavanna said one of the most important 
tools job seakers should employ is attending networking events. 
“Go to 20,000 networking meetings,” she 
said. “And never leave without asking for one more contact. Eventually one of them is going to get in touch with you.” It’s no coincidence that Cavanna’s resume 
is loaded with .com jobs. 
“Online is becoming bigger, and people 
want their information right away,” said Ca-vanna. “This generation is about immediate 
gratification, and on-demand information is 
key.” 
Today’s generation is at the cusp of a 
changeover. 
Between the pull of old-fashioned ways and the tug of technological advance, the jour-nalism industry is awkwardly fluttering be-tween print and digital. 
People don’t entirely know what the future 
is going to bring for newspapers and maga-zines. 
Cavanna advises students who face this 
ambiguous reality to learn how to publish on-line.
“You will be ahead of the game,” she said. Although the future of her industry is un-
certain, Cavanna is enjoying the creative and glamorous opportunities her job offers now. 
Cavanna will attend New York Fashion 
Week in September and gets to work with ce-lebrities on a routine basis. 
“It sounds corny, but it’s like what you see 
in movies and are like, ‘Whoa!’” she said. 
But play does not come without hard 
work. 
Working online, time management is a big 
issue. Information has to be continuoulsly dis-semated and updated.   
“Learning the politics for any job is also 
just as challenging. You’re not just answering for the editor in chief. There’s so many more people involved.”
Cavanna offers a final piece of advice to 
anyone searching the job market: “People get very strict about ‘tracks’. If you are really fo-cused on what you want, then do not be afraid to take different paths because you never know 
where that’s going to lead you,” she said. 
Courgae is essential.
“Don’t be afraid to try anything once. Any-
thing you can learn, it’s only going to ben-efit you,” she said. “And then you might find something you love.”
As Cavanna’s story shows, people should 
never underestimate where a ride on the sub-way, or any other seemingly trivial events, might take you.THURSDAY AUGUST 6, 2009 � ALLIGATOR, 11

REBEKAH GEIER  � AVENUE WRITER
‘Peter Pan’ play delights  
MARGARET GRECO  � AVENUE WRITER I step into the dojo quietly and respectfully 
trying not to disturb any of the other classes, 
and I am greeted by immediate chiding from one of the senseis.
“Shoes off! Shoes off!,” he yells — I’m still 
wearing my sandals like some ignorant West-erner.
Sensei Tom Huffman, a wiry, middle-aged 
man clad in a weathered gi tied with a worn-out black belt to match, stands at the other end of the room. He’s holding a broom and has just finished sweeping a large, padded mat.
In addition to Aikido and other weapons 
classes Huffman teaches at the Unified Train-
ing Center, he also teaches Iaido, “the art of 
drawing the sword such that as soon as the sword leaves the scabbard it is on the path of a lethal cut.” Huffman, a fourth degree Akiaki black belt in Aikido, has more than 23 years of Aikido experience, six of them in Japan. 
He opens a duffel bag and hands me a 
bokken, a wooden practice katana. Huffman wields a real one. Although its edge is purpose-
fully dulled, there is no doubt in my mind that 
he could finish me before I even knew he was moving.
Huffman gingerly slides three picture 
frames containing photos of his former senseis, now deceased, from his duffel bag and hangs them on the wall. He says they are more inspi-rational than anything.We stand in the center of the mat, bow toward the front of the dojo 
and hold our swords laterally in our palms, 
presenting them to the spirits of the deceased sensei.
Then it’s down to business. We walk to the 
edge of the mat, and the lesson begins.  Huff-man spends all of five minutes meticulously in-structing me on how to remove the sword from its PVC scabbard, or saya, which he molded in his oven to shape it to the sword. 
We begin on our knees, katana in saya, and 
Huffman leads me through a series of steps in-
volving explicit manipulation of the katana in 
slices, jabs and swings.
 I earned my black belt in karate at age 13, but 
it’s been a long time since I set foot in a dojo. He patiently picks apart all of my clumsy moves with the bokken as he demonstrates his own 
ability. As he glides through all the moves of the kata, a combined 
series of sword moves, 
his sword swishes 
through the air audibly.
“You hear [the sword] singing?” he asks. 
“That’s the old sensei talking to you.”
For a fee of $10 per lesson, this is what any 
first-timer can expect at the dojo. Iaido lessons are held at 6:15 p.m. Mondays and Wednes-days at the Unified Training Center on Univer-
sity Avenue.
Huffman, a Navy and Marine Corps vet-
eran, was stationed in Japan from 1990 to 1997 
and studied under various Aikido and Iaido masters. Framed scrolls of their writings line the walls of the dojo along with the samurai code of conduct.
The “live by the sword, die by the sword” 
idea that most people get from old samurai 
movies is not what Huffman aims to teach. 
Instead, he describes Iaido as a non-aggressive form of defending oneself with dignity and grace.
“The more relaxed you can stay,” Huffman 
said. “The stronger your techniques get.”Defend yourself with dignity

sex on the avenueSelfish sex results in karmic kick
Relationship karma is karma’s lesser-known and 
more sadistic cousin, and I assure you it is not lacking 
at colleges across the nation.  With no shortage of sex-
starved students, immorally themed parties and dollar-pitcher nights at the nearest bar, college is a breeding 
ground for screwing and — often — screwing over.  But 
thanks to relationship karma, you can be sure that what 
goes around in your love life will come back around to bite you in the rear.
Maybe you’ve already become acquainted with re-
lationship karma. At some point during your college 
career, you are likely to give someone the short end of the…err…shaft.  Whether it’s not calling back what’s-
her-name from three nights ago or rushing from a date 
with your significant other to a date with your “on-call-
masseuse,” you’ve become an expert in duping.
Eventually, relationship karma will track you down.  
It could happen days, weeks or years after your deceitful intentions have taken place.  But it will happen before 
you can exclaim, “Why aren’t they calling,  I like my 
partners to lack self-esteem, they’re supposed to come 
crawling back to me,”
But God has already witnessed your selfish ways.  
He’s shaking His head declaring, “I don’t think so,” and next thing you know the tables are turned.
Like most other college students, I’m no one-night-
stand to relationship karma.  Hell, I’ve had it come back to me so many times, it should be a friend on my Face-
book account.
Recently, I’d been casually involved with a girl I’d 
met through friends.  Sparks flew and clothes fell off 
throughout the first few weeks, but gradually I lost in-terest.  Without realizing the 
damage I was doing, I began 
ignoring the girl at parties, tex-
ting throughout the day was 
reduced to an 8 p.m. text and I only kissed her when neces-
sary.  Still, I was rather sur-
prised when she stopped re-turning my calls a week later.
Consulting my friends, 
I discovered what an ass 
I’d been.  My one friend ex-
plained best, “She was at your feet.  She cooked for you, she drove you around when you were too intoxicated to do it yourself.  And you threw her away.  Can you blame 
her for finally getting a shred of dignity and not stick-
ing around to see what happened next?”  And the real 
burner?  “The only reason you miss her is because you 
cannot stand the idea that someone would deny you.”
Such an defamatory statement made me wonder why 
I was upset with the abrupt end to our relationship.  Was it because I actually cared?  Was it because I had wanted 
to be the one with the final say?  Or was it because I was 
so horny that even my couch had a certain allure to it?  I 
have to admit that I still don’t know.
I’ll also admit, in the end, I got my well-deserved 
comeuppance.  It’s best to think twice before acting on your impulses and disregarding the feelings of another.  
And if you’re cold enough to not care about that, at least 
know relationship karma still follows the Golden Rule learned in kindergarten — “Treat others as you want to 
be treated.”  
You can ignore that rule, but trust me, you won’t be 
getting out unscathed.BRANDT WILLIAMS  � AVENUE WRITER

Before Erica Hyatt walks 
through the door, she is a chemi-
cal engineering major. She is a stu-
dent at the UF. She thinks about 
homework and grades and meet-ings for the intramural softball team she is on. But for the hour 
she is in the room, she forgets all 
of that. She throws her arms in the air and sways her hips to the blar-ing music. 
For an hour, she is just a wom-
an, nothing else.
Fifty energetic bodies join 
Hyatt as they twist and shake in unison. Every person dances as 
if no one is watching, though the 
room is full of people. The sweat in the air forms a condensation on the mirrors, slickens the floors, but 
nobody cares. This is the chance to 
let go and just dance.
This is Zumba.The fitness class developed in 
the early 1990s but has only in-fluenced the workouts of gym pa-trons at UF for about a year. The UF Department of Recreational Sports offered the class five times 
a week last fall, and it reached ca-
pacity almost every time. 
Zumba will be offered at the 
Student Recreation and Fitness Center again this fall, according to 
Patricia Figueroa, a group fitness 
instructor and a certified Zumba teacher.
Figueroa described Zumba as a fusion of all kinds of Latin music with easy-to-follow moves that al-lows people to feel more like they 
are at a party than working out.
“It’s a great way to burn a lot of 
calories without even realizing it,” 
Hyatt said. “And when you leave, 
you feel happy.”
Marissa Noelte, a graduate stu-
dent in the Masters of Occupation-
al Therapy program at UF, said that after a long day of studying, 
Zumba classes helps her to relieve 
stress.
Before Zumba, Noelte’s work-
outs consisted of 30 minutes on 
the treadmill or elliptical and some 
strength training. The monotony made her very aware that she was working out.
“When I do Zumba it is fun and 
gives me variety, so an hour goes by very quickly,” she said.
Noelte said that even if you 
aren’t a dancer or very into cho-reography, it doesn’t matter. The moves are easy to follow and al-low you to have fun.
Figueroa said it is an effective 
workout strategy for those want-ing to tone their bodies and burn calories. Zumba is a high-intensi-ty cardio workout, which means it burns calories by bringing the 
heart rate really high and then 
bringing it back down repeatedly. 
She said people that come to 
her class each week see visible re-sults quickly, and she encourages new people to give it a try.
“I think it lets girls break out of 
their shell,” she said. “It lets them be a new person, just for that one hour.”

WR COMES A YEAR EARLY POLL QUESTION IF YOU GOBy PHIL KEGLER
Alligator Staff Writer
pkegler@alligator.org
Riley Cooper will be wearing or-
ange and blue this fall after all.
The senior wide receiver will 
be returning to the Gators to play 
his final season of college football 
despite agreeing to terms with the 
Texas Rangers to sign a pro baseball contract.
Cooper was drafted by the Rang-
ers in the 25th round and has been playing minor league baseball all summer.
NCAA rules allow an athlete to 
become a professional in one sport 
while maintaining their eligibility in 
another, so with the Rangers’ per-mission, the road was paved for the 6-foot-3, 215-pound wideout to re-turn to Gainesville for the fall.
Signing a contract with the Rang-
ers will end his college baseball ca-reer, however.
Coach Urban Meyer’s statement 
regarding Cooper’s return alluded to Meyer’s big expectations for the senior.
“We are excited to have Riley 
back as part of our 2009 team,” Meyer said. “He will be counted on heavily to be one of our go-to receiv-ers. I’ve said numerous times during the offseason that we need someone 
to step up with the departure of Per-
cy Harvin and Louis Murphy. We haven’t had someone step up yet, and Riley can certainly be someone that does.”That wasn’t all. He went on 
to praise Cooper, who started 12 
games in 2008 and finished fifth on 
the team in receiving with 18 catches for 261 yards.
“Riley is an extremely gifted 
athlete,” Meyer said. “His speed, size and strength make him a tough matchup for defenses. Our whole offense is predicated on matchup 
problems for the defense, and Riley 
certainly helps do that for us. He is a big-time playmaker. 
“In all of my years of coaching, 
I don’t know if I’ve ever coached a player that can compete at such a high level in football and baseball. He is a special talent.”
With the loss of Harvin to the 
NFL and an inexperienced receiving corps, Cooper will provide another familiar face for senior quarterback Tim Tebow. Cooper had only three 
touchdown catches last year, but 
Tebow connected with him for a 5-yard score with 2:50 remaining in the SEC Championship Game to put UF up 31-20 and seal the win. 
“I’m glad to hear that Riley is 
coming back,” Tebow said in a state-ment. “He has the ability to stretch the field and give us the ability to 
score from anywhere. He has made 
a bunch of big plays for us, and I’m looking forward to hooking up with him for many more big plays.”
Cooper was originally drafted 
by the Philadelphia Phillies in the 15th round after graduating from high school in 2006, but he elected to come to Gainesville instead of sign-
ing a contract. He was ineligible to 
be drafted again until after his ju-nior year, and the Rangers grabbed him this time around in June’s MLB Draft.
“It was a tough decision, one of 
the hardest I’ve ever had to make, but I’m excited about being part of the Texas Ranger organization and coming back and playing football for my final season,” Cooper said in a statement.

There’s something special about 
pick-up basketball.
What’s great about pick-up 
hoops is the idea that anyone can play. 
People develop their own style. So with that in mind, I’d like to present a few of the most common archetypes 
you’ll see in a pick-up game. 
ThE TIMEBOMB:  These players make 
their presence felt about 3 seconds 
into the game. They thought you 
went over the back when you got that rebound over them. Tick. You 
totally fouled their teammate on that layup. Tick tick. As a teammate, they are greatly offended by your shot se-lection. Tick 
tick tick. They mutter to t h e m s e l v e s t h r o u g h o u t most of the game, notably after every 
foul or instance of excessive contact. Tick tick tick tick. Finally, they explode. Anything could provoke the reaction — from a moving screen on them to Pick-up Basketball ArchetypesHere it is. It all starts today.
Yes, spring practice is important — 
Urban Meyer loves to claim that it is 
where starting jobs are won and lost.
Yes, offseason workouts can tell the strength 
staff a lot about the chemistry of a team.
But the games are played in the fall, and this 
is where the fall truly begins.
You’ve probably been salivating since the 
time you finished celebrating on South Beach.
Now it’s finally here. The next 154 days 
(through the Jan. 7 BCS title game in Pasadena, 
Calif.) will be one of the most riveting stretches in college football, I guarantee this.
I don’t promise a specific outcome, but 
make sure you pay attention.
Go to the 6 a.m. practices today and Friday if 
you want an up-close-and-personal look at the once-in-a-generation Tim Tebow or a defense that will strike fear in every opponent.
Opportunities like this don’t come around 
every day.The last time a team 
was this hyped heading into fall was 2005. USC came off an undefeated 2004 campaign, and the 
Trojans’ 13-0 record al-
lowed them to hold the top spot in the AP poll from preseason to post-season, a distinction only one other team can 
claim (1999 Florida State). Matt Leinart won the 2004 Heisman Trophy, and USC won by an av-erage of 25.2 points per game, including a 55-19 
shellacking of Oklahoma in the BCS National 
Championship Game at Dolphin Stadium.
Hm — a stacked team coming off a win 
over Oklahoma in the BCS title game in Miami. Sound familiar?
For the record, UF’s 2008 comes off as even 
more impressive based on victory margin. The Don’t let title hopes spoil the season

Can Tebow win another Heisman?Top 10 Burning Questions for 2009-10
Will the football team repeat as national champs? By ADAM BERRY 
 Alligator Staff Writer 
 sports@alligator.org 
  
 During his three seasons at UF, Tim Tebow 
has won, in chronological order, a national 
championship, a Heisman Trophy and another 
national championship.
Last year, Tebow ﬁ  nished third in the Heis-
man voting behind winner Sam Bradford and 
runner-up Colt McCoy despite receiving the 
most ﬁ  rst- and third-place votes. 
In 2009, those three quarterbacks will once 
again battle it out for college football’s most prestigious award.
So the question is: Will Tebow become the 
second player ever to win more than one Heis-man Trophy?
Although continuing the alternating pat-
tern of winning a national title and a Heisman would certainly be amusing, it’s impossible to believe it would mean more than a third cham-pionship ring to UF’s senior quarterback.
Last year, the margin from Bradford to 
Tebow (151 points) was the second-closest gap between the winner and third-place ﬁ  nisher. 
Considering the fact Tebow and Bradford 
have already won one each, voters may be 
swayed to put McCoy atop their ballots rather 
than let one of the two previous winners join Archie Grifﬁ  n as the only players with two Heisman Trophies.
In 2007, Tebow became the ﬁ  rst sophomore 
to ever win the award, a feat Bradford matched in 2008. 
If the argument is boiled down to statisti-
cal success, Tebow may not have the strongest 
case. 
First, it’s likely the Gators will open up 
such a big lead on many opponents that the 
ﬁ  rst-string offense won’t even play during the fourth quarter.Second, UF will look to spread the ball 
around and involve many of its other weapons on offense. 
Finally, the ridiculous numbers Tebow put 
up in 2007 may have hurt him last year and could do the same this year, as matching up to his unbelievable Heisman campaign is nearly 
impossible.
Granted, Tebow will likely lead the Gators 
in rushing, as he has done the past two years. 
Although his passing numbers may not be 
as impressive as they were with Percy Harvin and Louis Murphy at receiver, they will still 
compare favorably to McCoy’s. 
If voters favor the best player on the best 
team, as they have done when 
no candidate separates himself as 
Tebow did in 2007, then he could very well lead the pack. 
The Gators are, at this point, 
the front-runners to win the na-
tional title, and if they make it, Tebow will be the one to lead them there.
Two more important issues will weigh on 
Tebow’s mind this season. 
In his last season at UF with his NFL future 
looming in the distance, he will likely be look-ing to become a more complete, all-around quarterback. 
And as selﬂ  ess and team-oriented as he has 
proven himself to be, he will primarily focus on leading his team to an undefeated season and another national championship, cement-ing his already-impressive legacy.
With that in mind, perhaps the two more in-
teresting questions regarding Tebow will not be answered during the course of his senior season. 
Can he become a more NFL-ready quarter-
back? 
And will he be remembered as the greatest 
player in college football history? 
 By PHIL KEGLER 
 Alligator Staff Writer 
 sports@alligator.org 
  
 From the time confetti was falling on 
Dolphin Stadium, people started talk-
ing about the 2009 UF football team.
The Gators had just won their sec-
ond national championship in three years, with a pretty young team to boot.
By the time Tim Tebow announced 
he was coming back (and was joined by Brandon Spikes), college football experts began discussing it.
The question is one that has already 
been asked a thousand times: Can the UF football team repeat as national champions?
There is certainly little doubt sur-
rounding the consensus preseason pick for national champion.
The four major preseason maga-
zines already released — Phil Steele, Lindy’s, Athlon and Sporting News — all peg the Gators as No. 1.
They have been installed as 2-1 fa-
vorites by sportsbooks, according to VegasInsider.com. The next closest team? The school UF defeated in this year’s championship game, Oklahoma, at 9-2.
At SEC Media Days, UF was the ﬁ  rst unanimous selection to win its divi-sion since the league split into East and West in 1992. The Gators also earned 63 of 64 media votes to be predicted as overall SEC champion.
As has been mentioned plenty of 
times before, UF returns its entire two-deep on defense. Tebow is set to go down as one of the best college quarterbacks ever, and Jeff Demps and Chris Rainey showed they can be am-ple home-run threats on any carry last 
season. 
The offensive line 
loses two starters (Jason Watkins and Phil Traut-wein) but has sophomore Matt Patchan switching 
back to the O-line, where he earned All-America honors in high school, and Sam Robey showed he could start at center with a breakout spring.
It should be noted, however, that 
this is a perilous journey. There has not been an undisputed repeat nation-al champion since Nebraska did it in 
1994-95.
Teams easily can become compla-
cent and expect to roll over opponents 
without putting in the work. Certainly UF’s experience and leadership from Tebow and Spikes will help ﬁ  ght that.The Gators tumbled after winning 
the crystal ball in 2006 and ﬁ  nished 9-4 in 2007 with a disappointing 41-35 loss to Michigan in the Capital One Bowl. But that 2007 team was much differ-
ent from the year prior — this time, 
the 2009 team looks an awful like 2008, only with another year more experi-ence.
Besides complacency, the biggest 
factor will be the departure of Percy Harvin to the NFL Draft and the inex-perienced receiving corps.
But even that can’t stop the excite-
ment from fans and analysts alike.
In fact, some people have Tebow 
holding a crystal ball in Pasadena as such a sure thing that they started wondering if UF will lose any games at all.
The Vince Young-led 2005 Texas 
team was the last undefeated national champion.
Lost in the midst of last year’s now-
famous The Promise, Tebow let it slip that an undefeated season was the goal 
— last year.
“We were hoping for an undefeated 
season. That was my goal, something 
Florida has never done here.”
Was he just a year off?Only time will tell.

672-6111Gators’ 13 wins were by an average of 
33.2 points. What about the one loss, you say? Factor in the 1-point defeat to Ole Miss, and UF had an average mar-gin of plus-30.7 points in 14 games.
If you don’t remember the fate of 
the 2005 Trojans, let me quickly remind you. They started the season as every-one’s pick to win it all and repeat (like the Gators are). USC rolled through its first 12 games, winning by an average of 28.7 points. The Trojans would later have 11 players picked in the 2006 NFL Draft.
Analysts slotted USC into their lists 
of all-time great teams before the title game was even played.
The problem was a pesky Texas 
team. The Longhorns were also unde-feated entering the title game, except 
no one really paid attention because 
they were facing the Mighty Trojans.
Texas quarterback Vince Young 
had a different thought, as he passed for 267 yards and ran for another 200 and three scores and Texas won 41-38.
It is the best college football game ever played (sorry, Boise State), but yet “one of the best college football teams of all time” didn’t even win the nation-al championship.
Don’t assume another crystal ball is 
on its way to Gainesville. Don’t build 
yourself up to the point that a single 
loss will make 2009 a complete failure.
Enjoy the ride. Tailgate. Get to 
games early. Keep your ticket stubs. Bemoan every score the defense al-lows, but don’t let the game be a dis-appointment because UF wins by two touchdowns and not four.
If you only enjoy the destination 
and not the ride, what happens if the destination never comes?
Cherish Tebow’s last season. Hold 
onto every defensive stop and the sideline celebrations. Enjoy the special teams plays and Urban’s refusal to ever  give his team a full vote of confidence. 
On Jan. 8, the morning after the 2010 
BCS Championship Game, you might 
be joyous. You could be bitter.
Just do yourself a favor.
Make sure you stop and smell the 
roses, and don’t wait until a possible trip to Pasadena to start.a teammate’s 14th straight missed runner in 
the lane — but you feel the results in their expletive-laden rant. Sometimes it’s just one four-letter word screamed so it could be 
heard from Southwest Rec to the O’Connell 
Center. But The Timebomb always goes off.
The high School ST ar: They’re often marked 
by their jerseys — primarily the fact they still 
wear them. They’re generally running the point or making the paint their home away from home. These players are just out of your league, and they tend to alter the outcome of every game they play. The High School Star probably has a 146-2 record and averages 7 points per 11-point game just because they’re almost always the best players in every game. They’re your favorite and least favorite per-son to play with — you always win, but it’s usually their victory, not yours.
The conduiT : A friend described this type of 
player to be similar to Ben Wallace, just 14 
inches shorter and less talented on defense. The Conduit is, as the name implies, just a means of transmitting the ball between play-ers. In a way, The Conduit may be doing your team a favor by passing up shots and keeping the ball moving. Or maybe they’re just nervous to endure the humiliation of a three that ricochets wildly off the top of the backboard. Then again, maybe they’re just the consummate teammate and enjoy “team” success more than individual accolades. 
The Mad BoMBer:  No shot is out of The Mad 
Bomber’s range, but these players are not 
particularly efficient 3-point shooters. Two for 10 from behind the arc is enough to jus-tify The Mad Bomber’s never-ending barrage of treys. They are the bane of your existence when you’re on their team. You’ve got a wide-open layup, but The Mad Bomber pre-fers the 27-footer with a hand in their face.
The aSSaSSin: They take you by surprise 
with their talent. The Assassin is dressed just 
like you, wears the same off-the-Foot-Locker-shelves shoes as you and jokes around off the court just like you. This generally leads to a mediocre defender picking to guard The As-sassin, a decision the defender will come to regret after one trip down the court. Unlike The High School Star, they don’t call home to their dad after a good night of pick-up hoops to report on their success, but their talent is a welcome surprise. Physically, they tend to be relatively unassuming — probably the third or fourth pick in most games. In extreme cas-es, they’re out of shape but have the basket-ball IQ of Al Horford.
