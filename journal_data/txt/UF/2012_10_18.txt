Users of Amazon’s Kindle 
e-reader may get some cash 
back if a judge approves legal settlements between three major publishers and the at-torneys general of mostof the  United States.
Owners could be entitled 
to refunds for e-books pur-chased from April 1, 2010, to May 21, according to an email sent to customers from the Amazon Kindle Team.
Due to inﬂ  ated prices of 
e-books, customers may re-ceive 30 cents to $1.32 for each eligible purchase.  
Although Hachette Book 
Group, HarperCollins and Simon & Schuster deny do-ing anything wrong, they have settled a lawsuit that makes a $69 million fund to give credit back to consum-ers.
Jonathan Cohen, a UF law 
professor, said a judge has grounds to sign this order because both parties have worked at a settlement, and it is enforceable. In this case, he said, it’s the court’s deci-sion.
If passed, the lawsuit 
would also limit publishers’ ability to set e-book prices.
Brooke Giuliano, a 
20-year-old environmental management in agriculture and natural resources junior, said students probably didn’t realize prices were inﬂ  ated. She said e-books are usually cheaper than in stores, some-times about 40 percent less.
If prices were lower, she 
said, she’d be willing to buy more e-books.
“If ‘Fifty Shades Darker’ 
was cheaper,” she said, “I’d just buy it rather than bor-row it.”
The email said customers 
will receive credit to their Amazon.com accounts, or they can request checks.
The hearing that will de-
termine the outcome of the lawsuit will take place Feb. 8.Kindle users 
could get refunds on e-books
�THE GRANT IS TO HELP 
STRENGTHEN MATH AND SCIENCE 
MIDDLE AND HIGH SCHOOL TEACHERS.

Alligator Contributing Writer
UF received a $2 million grant to de-
velop a pilot program aimed at strength-
ening math and science teachers in Florida middle and high schools.The Florida Department of Education 
awarded the grant to increase the reten-tion rate of these teachers while also pro-viding assistance with teaching strategies in Miami-Dade, Duval and Palm Beach counties.
Grifﬁ  th Jones, a UF clinical associate 
professor in science education, said 30 percent of teachers leave in the ﬁ  rst ﬁ  ve years. The program hopes to help teach-ers go from being novices to experts in that span.
Jones said students will also beneﬁ  t be-cause teachers will receive “expert men-torship” in math and science.
“There is a strong con-
sensus that the teacher matters more than any factor for students to learn and succeed,” he said.
Economics sophomore 
Jimmy Dreyer, 19, said teachers engage students so they can get the best 
out of their education.
“If teachers can instill a sense of passion or desire for a certain subject, it can really make a difference in the kid’s life and a difference in the world overall,” he said.
The program will coordinate with the 
newly created Florida STEM-Teacher In-duction and Professional Support Center created by UF. The center’s faculty will su-pervise teachers and provide professional development and networking opportuni-ties.
“It is nice being involved in giving back 
to the greatest profession in the world — teaching,” Jones said.

Government agents arrested a 
Gainesville man early Wednesday 
morning on accusations of illegally importing and selling dinosaur fos-sils stolen from Asia.
Agents from the U.S. Immigra-
tion and Customs Enforcement’s Homeland Security Investigations unit arrested Eric Prokopi, a 38-year-old self-proclaimed “commercial paleontologist,” at his home in the 5900 block of Southwest 13th Street, according to a news release.
Prokopi was charged with con-
spiracy to smuggle illegal goods, possession of stolen property and providing false information. He was also charged with smuggling items into the U.S., and interstate sale and receipt of stolen goods.
Before the arrest, prosecutors from the U.S. Attorney’s Ofﬁ  ce for the Southern District of New York ﬁ  led a civil lawsuit regarding Proko-pi’s dinosaur fossil scheme. The case is currently pending.
The U.S. attorney for the South-
ern District of New York, Preet Bha-rara, said in a statement the seizure of a 70-million-year-old, “nearly complete” Tyrannosaurus bataar

Prokopi imported the Tyrannosaurus bataar fossil in March 2010
skeleton from Prokopi “was merely 
the tip of the iceberg.”
“Our investigation uncovered a 
one-man black market in prehistoric fossils,” he said.
Prokopi and his wife own Ev-
erything Earth, a Gainesville-based business that buys and sells jewelry, artifacts and fossils.
From 2010 to 2012, Prokopi alleg-
edly lied to United States Customs and Border Protection ofﬁ  cials about the Mongolian fossils’ identity, ori-gin and value, according to the New York State attorney’s complaint.
In March 2010, Prokopi imported 
the Tyrannosaurus bataar fossil to Gainesville, falsely reporting to cus-toms ofﬁ  cials that the skeleton was from Great Britain and worth about $15,000. It was actually from Mon-golia.Between April and May 2010, 
Prokopi directed another person to lie on a customs form to import the remains of a Microraptor, a small, ﬂ  ying dinosaur from China, accord-ing to the release.
Earlier this year, Prokopi listed 
the Tyrannosaurus bataar skeleton for auction through the Dallas-based auction website Heritage Auctions.
On May 20, an anonymous buyer bought the fossil in Manhattan for more than $1 million.
A day later, the U.S. government 
seized the skeleton at the request of Mongolian government ofﬁ  cials, who said it was stolen from their country.

An American cyclist’s controversial decision to 
step down from his position at the Livestrong Foun-
dation sparked mixed reactions in Gainesville on Wednesday.
Lance Armstrong, accused of doping to win his 
seven Tour de France races, shocked many by vacat-ing his chair in his own organization. The founda-tion dedicates itself to “empowering and inspiring people with cancer,” according to its website.
Armstrong was respected for his athleticism, but 
failed to uphold his achievements through the ac-cusations of cheating held against him, said Team Florida Cycling president Dustin White.
“Everyone contests the sport of cycling is so hard 
and it truly is,” said the 21-year-old mechanical en-gineering senior. “He had to overcome immense personal battles, but any edge to overcome the chal-lenges of the sport, any shortcut, is bad.”
White said he agreed with the athlete’s renuncia-
tion of his Livestrong afﬁ  liation.
Virginia Maurer, UF professor of business law 
and director of the Poe Center for Business Ethics, wrote in an email that Armstrong’s choice to walk away from Livestrong was “more than appropri-ate.”
A leader who has been disgraced for ethical or legal reasons should step down from his or her 
position, she said, because it is better for the orga-nization. 
Leadership requires trust — especially when the 
group that leader is representing is a charity , Maurer said.
Brian Ray, UF lecturer for 
leadership and ethics and direc-tor of the Heavener School of Business, agreed. 
His conclusion was Arm-
strong’s reputation was not as important as the mission of the foundation.
Dylan Wade, a cyclist with Tri-
Gators for four years, said he be-
lieves Armstrong’s philanthropy should still be rec-ognized regardless of the allegations against him.
“I don’t think he could’ve been a ﬁ  gurehead as 
far as the media’s concerned, but I don’t think he should just walk away,” said the 21-year-old psy-chology and criminology senior.
Fellow Tri-Gator and acting junior Ryan Oates, 
22, said he’s skeptical of the accusations.
“To me, Lance Armstrong was a superhuman 
that people idolize like UF students idolize Tim Tebow,” he said. “But you don’t hear anyone accus-ing Tim Tebow of using steroids or the football dop-ing equivalent.”Lance Armstrong steps down from

Louis Sacco is used to high-pres-
sure environments. After all, she 
worked as a nurse for 30 years.
But she said little could have pre-
pared her for the stress of the cur -
rent job market.
“Things have changed since I’ve 
been in the workforce,” she said.
Sacco and five other job seek-
ers attended a career fair at Santa Fe College’s Center for Innovation and Economic Development on Wednesday . 
The fair was held to help people 
re-enter the workforce by giving them professional resources and time to chat with potential employ-ers.
Devin Marc, a personal banker 
with Wells Fargo, represented one of five companies at the event.
“I’m usually very blunt,” she said. “You have to make yourself as valuable as possible.”
Enactus, a business service club within UF’s Warrington College of Business Administration, hosted the biannual event and provided resume critiques, mock interviews and presentations about the job market.Melissa Travaglia, a 21-year-old 
UF marketing junior and a member of the business organization, said the fair was designed to be educa-tional and to allow some unem-ployed people to network with city businesses.
Travaglia said she was surprised 
by the small turnout, especially since 
Alachua County’s unemployment rate is 7.1 percent, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics.
“I think it’s a disconnect of being 
aware and going out and actually doing it,” she said.
Sacco has been unemployed for 
about a year after an injury made it 
impossible for her to keep up with her job’s physical demands.
The 59-year-old said she’s ready 
to begin a new career but said she sees a completely different land-scape.
“It’s nice to see what’s new and 
how I can use my skills in a different capacity,” Sacco said.

an electric longboard?Increase in atheism isn’t a bad thing
Atheism is on the rise in this country. 
The Pew Research Center reports that one in 
ﬁ  ve Americans doesn’t ascribe to any religion at 
all. Of the irreligious respondents, 88 percent said they weren’t looking to adopt a faith.
As the number of irreligious people has grown, so has 
the number of atheists.
I would identify myself as an atheist. 
I observe no credible evidence for the existence of any 
god, so I live my life as if there are no gods.
Despite our growing number, atheists are often seen as 
antagonistic. Even I think the word “atheist” sounds dirty . It sounds like we’re the unhappy hedonists who are anti-God.
This is unfortunate because I don’t think that my own 
philosophy conforms to any of that spiteful sentiment.
I don’t hate religion.I do wonder, though, why many within the religious 
community should automatically see atheists — or atheism — as contemptible.
There have been atheists who have done really horrible 
things. Joseph Stalin and Pol Pot killed millions.
However, it was not atheist values that caused such un-
fortunate behavior. The only value inherent in atheism is a lack of belief in a deity.
One could live a life that many of us would recognize as 
good without believing in a god.
Just as there have been atheists who have done horrible 
things, there have been religious people who have done re-ally horrible things, and many of these things were done in the name of their faiths.
For example, during the Crusades, many Muslims and 
Jews needlessly died at the hands of Christians. It is said that during the ﬁ  rst siege of Jerusalem the blood was up to the knees of the conquerors’ horses.
This ghastly mark on human history came directly as a 
result of the crusaders’ particular combination of faithful beliefs.
That’s not to say that, similarly, there aren’t good Chris-tians. There are Christians alive today who love their fellow man and do good works whenever they can.
However, I’m not sure that the 
Crusades ever ought to be cel-ebrated. Interestingly , one group on campus calls itself the Crusade for Christ.
Given what we know about the 
brand of Christianity that many 
practice, the name “Crusade” might make sense. To most Christians, the end times are approaching. To many, the ul-timate battle between good and evil is already underway.
A crusade is a Christian’s holy war. Likewise, a jihad is 
a Muslim’s holy war. Why then wouldn’t it be acceptable if Islam On Campus was instead called “Campus Jihad”?
I think that we ought to take the concept of religiously 
inspired warfare very seriously . 
Last week a 14-year-old Pakistani girl was shot in the 
head by the Taliban for blog posts she made about educat-ing girls.
She’s recovering now, but the Taliban promises to ﬁ  nish 
the job. Is there any doubt that such hatred comes as a direct result of the particular version of faith these people hold?
I understand that not all Muslims share the belief that 
women ought to be shot for going to school. It is, however, an interpretation that 36,000 Taliban ﬁ  ghters ﬁ  nd plausible enough to put their lives on the line for.
With so much conﬂ  ict in the world that has been derived 
and is derived as a result of certain religious beliefs, why should an atheist be, by default, the elephant in the room?
At the end of the day, it isn’t the title of a person’s faith — 
or lack of faith — that deﬁ  nes how terrible he or she is.
Perhaps it can be argued that we ought to praise or con-
demn people according to what they actually believe and not according to an ambiguous label.
Brandon Lee Gagne is an anthropology senior at UF . His 
column appears on Thursdays.Debate Debacle 
Have binder sales 
increased this week? 
Here’s a problem with Mitt Romney: He sees people as 
numbers and commodities.
He said during the debate this week that he ran busi-
nesses for about 25 years — that either means he’s good at run-ning businesses, or he’s good at starting and closing businesses.
Either way, he might be good at simply looking at numbers.Romney is trying to claim credit for a women’s group. What 
else is new?
“I went to my staff, and I said, ‘How come all the people for 
these jobs are all men?’” Romney said during the debate, accord-ing to ABC News. “We took a concerted effort to go out and ﬁ  nd women who had backgrounds that could be qualiﬁ  ed to become members of our cabinet.”
“I went to a number of women’s groups and said, ‘Can you 
help us ﬁ  nd folks,’ and they brought us whole binders full of women,” he said.
Which was a lie. According to CBS News, the collection of 
female candidates “was actually spearheaded by a nonproﬁ  t group called the Massachusetts Government Appointments Project, which was founded under the leadership of the Mas-sachusetts Women’s Political Caucus speciﬁ  cally with that goal in mind.”
He tried to take credit for work that somebody brought him, 
which kind of sounds like someone who’s used to running com-panies. 
Romney’s “binders full of women” is his way of trying to 
convince the American public that he cares about women’s rights, and that’s the biggest joke we’ve ever heard.
Just because you hire a woman, doesn’t automatically sug-
gest that you’re a revolutionary feminist. It means you’re a per-son ... who ... hires ... other people.
But because Romney isn’t a champion of women’s rights by 
any means, and also because he is a robot, he thinks hiring a woman makes him a better person.
We’re here to tell you that it does not, in fact, make you a bet-
ter person just because you hired a woman. 
Hire the person who is the most qualiﬁ  ed for the position. 
That should be regardless of gender, sexuality, race or back-ground.
That being said, if you discover that women are being under-
hired for jobs, then maybe try to counterbalance that by looking at female applicants more seriously. Or, better yet, try to foster an environment that will make more women want to apply in the ﬁ  rst place.
Don’t pull a Bic, though. The pen company recently released 
a pen speciﬁ  cally designed for women, for some reason, and col-ored it pink, of course. It’s “Bic for Her.”
How should a lady use the pen?“When you have an opinion, you write it down on a piece 
of paper, and then crumble it up and throw it away, because no one wants to know our opinion, sweetheart,” said Ellen DeGe-neres, in a fake ad for the product.
Romney having “binders full of women” does not make him 
a hero. It makes him a commodity-interested robot.

There are few things that really , 
really bother me — like trips to the dining hall where no food 
is lying out fresh and ready for me to devour or waiting at a bus stop longer than I am actually on the bus itself —  and Internet classes.
Online learning is a guaranteed way 
to waste a majority of a day.
Even with a long list of things that 
could be more productive, Internet classes take precedence because they count for credits and GPAs.
At ﬁ  rst you think they are avoid-
able, but many classes are only offered online or may be full in classrooms, leaving students with no other option.
However, they may ultimately be a 
grand waste of time.
College is all about self-guidance, 
but that term has morphed into self-education. With laptops at our disposal at all hours, online classes seem like the easy way out to what could potentially be a challenging schedule. Hours in front of a computer viewing lectures is no match for a live lecture hall with an engaging professor and students sur-rounding you also eager to learn.
Without the time restraints on a 
class, having no set hour that students have to learn, work is put off until mul-tiple lectures and assignments have slipped by without notice.
No professor is watching the clock; 
ultimately, in online classes, it is a per-sonal decision to even bother with the lectures and additional coursework.
In classrooms, there are no mute but-
tons that can simply be pushed when a lecture seems too dull to possibly listen to. But there is less motivation to study in online courses and become engaged in a subject.
College classes are meant to be chal-
lenging and intriguing. Online classes take away the thirst for knowledge that degree-seeking students need in or-der to excel, and they instead provide hours for students to question what better things they could be doing.
In my mind, to-do lists never work. 
I need a calendar ﬁ  lled with every loca-tion and time that I need to be some-where. Online courses do not allow for this and offer too much ﬂ  exibility . On to-do lists, they slowly slide to the bot-tom as the day wears on.
After work for other classes has been 
completed each day , it’s nearly time to hit the lights, and not a moment’s thought is given to the online class that technically isn’t “due.”
In my own experience, online class-es go by a weekly basis with assign-ments open-ing in the beginning of the week and closing towards the end. This doesn’t seem 
to be a problem until the week is nearly over, and I have little to show for it.
Beyond time management, online 
courses offer a number of other obsta-cles; online classes are often lonely.
Without knowing who else may be 
taking it, there is no one to turn to with additional questions. Professors of these courses are very limited in helping stu-dents and may even urge students not to contact them unless necessary.
Some of the best learning is done 
through questioning, and eliminating this could potentially damage some-one’s ability to succeed in a class.
There simply are not enough hours 
in the day to spend them glued to a computer screen, even if it is in an aca-demic pursuit.

Column
Online classes: Out of sight, out of mindStudent Government seeks to represent the Student 
Body, right?
When the Student Body voted in the recent elec-
tions to keep the independently owned newspaper racks on campus, senators from the Students Party aimed to reinforce this decision with a resolution in Senate.  
However, the Swamp Party responded to the outcome 
of the election with disregard, killing the resolution.
The heart of the Swamp Party argument against in-
dependent newspaper racks revolved around the publi-cation The Independent Florida Alligator. It would be a shame, they claimed, if this publication got preferential treatment.
However, if they actually read the Senate resolution 
or the referendum that appeared on the student ballot this Fall, they would know this is in defense of all publi-cations, not just the Alligator.  
Why does the Swamp Party side with the adminis-
tration on this issue? Perhaps it has to do with the bad press they received before they changed their name this semester.  
Senate leaders and high proﬁ  le members of the then-
Unite Party were caught throwing away hundreds of copies of newspapers endorsing the Students Party last Spring. Unite standard-bearers responded with denial and accused the Alligator of racism.
Perhaps it has to do with a more general governing 
philosophy. In response to the Students Party nearly securing the student presidency, the other side passed through campaigning reforms that severely restricted political speech and ability to organize.  
The interpretation of the new rules was used to send 
myself and other party members before the Elections Commission to face disqualiﬁ  cation. Clearly, it was not successful.
This is an academic institution, and we are Ameri-
cans. We should protect the free ﬂ  ow of information on campus, not seek to impose restrictions or fees on stu-dent publications.  
We must protect the right of newspapers to remain 
fully independent, resisting any effort of administrators or Student Government to gain leverage over them, and recognize that it was not long ago in our university histo-ry that censorship of student publications was a reality.  
It is easy to become cynical when our leaders disre-
gard our concerns, but I urge students to remember that they wield power. Otherwise, what would be the point of censorship?

A history professor will discuss 
her family’s journey during the 
Holocaust and her recent research about other refugees’ experiences Thursday.
The event, “Remapping Death 
and Survival: Flight, Displacement and International Aid for Jewish Refugees during the Holocaust,” is  today at 7 p.m. at the Thomas Center, 302 NE Sixth Ave.
Atina Grossmann is a history 
professor at the Cooper Union for the Advancement of Science and Art in New York.
She is also a noted scholar of 
women’s and gender studies, and German and modern European history.
“The first thing I’m trying to get 
across is that we need to kind of re-map and rethink our understand-ing of displacement and survival in the Holocaust,” Grossmann said.Her parents, both German Jews, 
were never held captive in Nazi concentration camps. Rather, they were refugees who fled from Ber -
lin to Eastern Europe before World War II began.
“It’s not the standard World War 
II or Holocaust story,” Gross-
mann said.
“Her talk is a 
new reading of the Holocaust. Her reading is very closely related to her family story, which makes it 
even more interesting,”said Anna Muller, a lecturer for the Center for European Studies. 
“Certainly, somebody who sur -
vived the death camps has a mi-raculous story. I want to expand that story and say, ‘Well, that’s a very good story, but that’s not the majority of the survivors,’” Gross-mann said.8, ALLIGATOR � THURSDAY, OCTOBER 18, 2012

UF’s student population might 
reflect the trend of young women on 
hormonal contraceptives being less likely to use condoms, even after they stop using the contraceptives.
The trend was apparent in a re-
cent study of 15- to 24-year-old pa-tients at a California Planned Par -enthood. 
“I don’t know a percentage, but 
I’ve heard of it enough to say that students at UF are affected by this,” GatorWell sexual health educator Samantha Evans said.
GatorWell surveys conducted 
during Spring 2009 and 2010 found the No. 1 reported contraceptive method among students was birth control, followed by the male con-dom, Evans said. No. 3 was the com-bination of both.
She said although it’s safest to 
use both methods to prevent preg-nancies and sexually transmitted infections, students who are consid-ering stopping one method should carefully consider the decision. She encouraged students to talk to their partners and health care providers.
Evans said she thinks students in monogamous relationships often be-gin to trust one another and then feel that condoms are “unnecessary.”
“It’s not a laziness thing. It’s just 
one less thing they have to think about when they’re about to have sex,” she said. 
Phylis Craig, a registered nurse 
practitioner at UF’s Student Health Care Center Women’s Clinic, said she would estimate condom usage is even less than the study suggests.
Craig said more students’ STD 
screenings are coming back positive. She said students should be cautious when not using condoms.
“Birth control is for birth control. 
Condoms are STD protection,” Craig said. “If you’re not using condoms, you’re definitely taking a risk. Using condoms is the only way to protect yourself.”

Reggae’s favorite wander -

to Gainesville.
Matisyahu will play his new 
electronica-reggae songs at the Florida Theater Tuesday.
Doors to the 18-and-older 
concert will open at 8 p.m. Tuesday and the show will be-gin at 8:30 p.m. 
Tickets are available in ad-
vance for $22 at High Tides and Hear Again Music, and online at www.ticketweb.com.
Matthew Paul Miller, who 
performs as Matisyahu, a reggae-rooted hip-hop artist, played a solo acoustic set in Gainesville last year and said he is excited to play here again.
This year, Matisyahu and 
his band are plugged in for a performance unlike his last.
“This is more of a dance 
party,” he said.
Different from his earlier 
reggae-rock music, Matisyahu, 33, adopted electronic sounds fused with sounds from tradi-tional Middle Eastern instru-ments into his latest album, “Spark Seeker.”
“Every time I sit down to 
create music, it isn’t like a sci-ence,” Matisyahu  said. “We do 
a lot of com-
bination,  even live shows.”
“Spark 
S e e k e r ” 
was re-corded in Tel Aviv, Is-rael, shap-ing the 
album’s sound and direction, he said.
“We wanted instrumenta-
tion that was original to that landscape, to that people,” he said. “We went there to get that sound.”
He said he misses Israel, 
where he felt connected to the spirit of the land.

From the colorful mural on the side of the 
wall to the scent of burning incense that seeps 
outside, Wild Iris Books is hard to miss. 
These are just a few things that set the 
store apart from the rest of the businesses that populate West University Avenue. 
Erica Merrell, co-owner of the bookstore, 
believes Wild Iris Books would be missed greatly if the store closed — which is now a possibility.
Wild Iris Books closed for the first week-
end of October after announcing on its web-site earlier in the week that it faced the pos-sibility of closing due to financial reasons.
Wild Iris Books is part of a small number 
of feminist bookstores in the country. The closest feminist bookstore outside Gainesville is in Atlanta.
The store’s merchandise includes bestsell-
ing books, locally published pamphlets, tarot cards, precious rocks and sponge tampons.
Beyond selling a variety of merchandise, 
Wild Iris serves as a community meeting space. Merrell said groups like lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and pagan groups that might have trouble finding places that would allow them to gather, often meet in the space.
“We offer a space where creativeness, 
diversity and anomalies are all celebrated,” Merrell said.
Merrell, who runs the store as a nonprofit, 
said changes in the book industry, increased rent and costs of upkeep were the reasons for the possible closing.
“We put it out there: Does this matter to 
you? And the answer is so loud,” Merrell said of the community’s reaction to the clo-sure.
According to a report from the Associa-
tion of American Publishers, a trade associa-tion that provides advocacy and communi-cations for the book publishing industry, e-book sales were up 117 percent in 2011, while mass-market book sales fell 35.9 per -
cent from 2010.
Von Ruder, 52, owner of Kind Auto Re-
pair, is openly bisexual, Gainesville resident who believes in Wild Iris Books because of its local roots and feminist mission.
“I thought there has got to be something I 
can do to help them,” he said.
After Ruder found out the store was in fi-
nancial trouble, he partnered with the book-store to help. When Wild Iris Books refers customers to Kind Auto Repair, Ruder do-nates 10 percent of every repair cost back to the bookstore.
In an effort to save the store, Merrell and 
co-owner Cheryl Calhoun launched a 20 for 20 campaign, asking store supporters to do-nate $20 for the 20 years Wild Iris Books has been active.
In less than two weeks, the store raised 
about $2,900. As of Tuesday night, it raised $3,029.
That money has created new possibilities for Merrell, who thought she ran out of op-tions.
“I think I hit a wall,” she said. “I thought, 
‘If it can’t be there, it can’t be anywhere.’”
The funds will allow Merrell and Cal-
houn to explore the options of moving to a new space instead of closing.
Merrell and Calhoun hope to come to a 
definite decision before the end of the year. They are looking at smaller spaces down-town that would cost about 60 percent less than what they are currently paying in rent.
If the store moves, Merrell hopes to up-
date the book displays and the general aes-thetic of the merchandise in the store.
“There are some things in here that are 20 
years old,” she said.
Molly Ryan, political science and wom-
en’s studies major, is one of the two Fall se-mester Wild Iris Books interns.  Ryan, 21, has been involved with the store since her first semester at UF.
“There is sort of a stigma of the old les-
bian-witchy store, but people always want to come back once they come in for the first time,” she said.
Merrell describes her store as something 
more than a bookstore.
“We still need a safe space,” Merrell said.

It is time to get your head out of 
your midterm study guides and into 
the music, because the Passion Pit show is seven days away . This is not a concert you can just walk into say-ing, “Man, I really like that one song in the Taco Bell commercial.” No. Passion Pit deserves more than that.
So here is a song-a-day guide 
to get excited for the blood, sweat and tears that will be the Passion Pit show. (OK, maybe not blood, al-though I’ll fight you for the set list.) 
T oday: “I’ve Got Your Number” 
(album: “Chunk of Change EP”)
This song is a study break bet-ter than a Starbucks pumpkin spice latte in the library. The introduc-tion is head-bobbingly catchy and moves into this epic, angsty chorus — “Have you seen me cry/tears like diamonds?” You’ll be vibing hard in Library West, but it’s fine. People around you will be too engrossed in their Study Edge packets to notice.
Friday: “Moth’s Wings” (album: 
“Manners”)
This is a Friday afternoon song. 
It starts out laid back, like you’re walking out of your last class of the week. And then it goes into this huge, happy chorus, and suddenly you’re dancing across campus. You may have failed your chemistry test and went hungover to your 8:30 a.m. class, but it’s OK, because home-work doesn’t exist until Sunday.Saturday: “Little Secrets” (al-
bum: “Manners”)
It’s gameday , so obviously a 
pump-up song is necessary . “Little Secrets” is the perfect sorry-for-partying rave song. So on gameday , rave around campus tailgates, rave 
your way to the stadium and rave your way to Mid-town after we beat South Carolina. 
Alright, maybe 
that was cocky . The game could 
go either way , so for Sunday , I’m providing two song options.
If we win: “It’s Not My Fault, 
I’m Happy” (album: “Gossamer”)
You won’t even be able to hear the haters.
If we lose: “I’ll Be Alright” (al-
bum: “Gossamer”)
You’ll most likely wake up on the 
floor of your bathroom with a vague feeling of regret over what may or may not have happened last night, but don’t worry. You’ll be alright.
Monday: “Sleepyhead” (album: 
“Manners”)
Just another manic Monday? No. 
Because it’s the week of the show, and what better way to start it than a groggy bus ride listening to the band’s most popular song?
T uesday: “Where We Belong” 
(album: “Gossamer”)
It’s Passion Pit Eve. It’s time to 
meditate on the magnitude of the event that you will be attend tomor -
row. Remember all of the moments you’ve shared with the band by your side and smile at the fact that you’ll be reliving it all in only 24 hours. Maybe you’ll cry yourself to sleep later, but it’s OK, because the next day is basically Christmas.
Wednesday: “Carried Away” 
(Album: “Gossamer”)
Let the bubbly-ness of this song 
carry you away to the O’Dome for the most passion-filled, feels-induc-ing, beautiful night of your life.
If you don’t have tickets, there 
are still some tier seats available at the University Box Office, open 12 p.m. to 5 p.m., Monday through Fri-day. Tickets are $15 for students and $25 for the general public. 
Listen up: a Passion Pit song for every day of the week
Dear Mediocre Advice,
I had a friend tell me he would totally bang me if I would let him. While 
I appreciate the honesty, I’m pretty sure I don’t want to bang said friend. 
I’ve had this happen before and ignored it, and we’ve managed to stay pretty good friends. Do you think this is the way I should handle it this time? Or should I be honest and risk hurting his feelings and/or our 
friendship?Dear Friend,
Every being on the planet can turn into a monster 
if his or her sleep is constantly disrupted. Before she goes out or before you go to sleep, tell her that she and her friends need to be quiet if they’re going to hang out all night at your place. If she brings back people and they wake you up, then you get to be angry and tell them to shut up. It’s your house too. You and your roommate need to come to an agreement, so you can get your sleep, and she can socialize at an un-necessary hour. It’s not your fault you have a different lifestyle and choose blessed sleep over hanging out until 2:30 a.m. Maybe she can go to someone else’s place, or they can go to a part of the house, possibly her room, where you can’t hear the chatter. It’s not a lot to ask for — especially if it’s every night of the week. If you have already thought about buying earplugs, this 
has gone on too long, and you’re being too nice.Dear Peter,
Boobs are a valued part of the body as long as 
you’re outside of a strip club. If men and women had topless equality, no one would appreciate boobs. It would lower their value, similar to how no one cares when a dude takes off his shirt (un-less he has the abs of Thor). We’re just covering up our girls, and dudes have nothing to hide. It’s kind of like when a chubby guy doesn’t want to take off his shirt to go in the pool because he has man-boobs. Of course he’s nervous to take his shirt off! He’s got boobs, and everyone is go-ing to look at them — obviously not in the same way you would gaze at a woman’s breasts, but you get the point. Boobs are precious and beau-tiful spots of fat. Also, this doesn’t mean it’s OK for every guy to take off his shirt. I know if I don’t see some kind of proof of an ab workout, I’ll be 
the first to yell, “Put your shirt back on!”Dear Friend,
I appreciate your interest, but Mediocre 
Advice is my baby cub. It’s just me, my lap-top, these questions and no pants. Then the nice people at the Alligator, who have tol-erated this for a surprisingly long time, edit my baby and kindly print it for you to read. Mediocre Advice is my Titanic, and I will sink with this mother if I have to. I solely created and run it. If you want to contribute, ask as many wild questions you can. The questions are half the fun, so I’m counting on readers like you. Also, I’ve been informed that there is a shortage of blow-job related questions, 
so please help.This column is provided by Ariel Barnes, a 21-year-old majoring in international studies. Would 
you like to get some Mediocre Advice? Visit http://mediocreadvicegators.tumblr.com/ask
Ariel BarnesDear Mediocre Advice,
How do I tell my roommate that having a few 
people in the common area and socializing 
every night until 2:30 a.m. deprives me of my beloved sleep? I already block out the bright kitchen light with something. I’m afraid if I buy earplugs to drown out the chatter, I won’t hear my alarm. I don’t want to be that b*tchy room-mate who comes out disgruntled in pajamas 
and says, “HEY, shut the ‘F’ up!”Dear Mediocre Advice,
Why is it OK for men to be topless in pub-
lic, but seriously not OK for women to do the same? When it comes down to it, we are all members of the same human race. We are bags of flesh and meat and, increasingly, fat.Dear Mediocre Advice,
Are you taking anyone to help you out next semester if this keeps going? I give advice 
all the time and would love to be a part!
Dear Friend,
The first option sounds better, it’s less work and doesn’t hurt anyone’s 
feelings — so do that. Your guy friend isn’t going to keep bugging you until 
the beautiful day you agree, so don’t worry about it. Take it as a compliment, and avoid the topic as long as you can — like, forever.  Although you may never take him up on his offer, it’s nice to have friends that want to bone  
you.THURSDAY, OCTOBER 18, 2012 � ALLIGATOR, 11

Good, clean and fair food.  It’s the official 
slogan of the Slow Food Movement. Tempo 
Bistro To Go, a sandwich shop at 1516 NW 13th St., is embracing the mantra in big ways.  
John Drum and Debra Pour opened the 
eatery in November 2010 with a mission to provide the community with artful combina-tions made from simply good, local ingredi-ents.
Almost all of the produce at Tempo Bistro comes from local farms, and the sandwich bread is brought in fresh from local bakeries.
Tempo Bistro has also built a strong re-
lationship with Gainesville Compost and makes an impressive claim of almost no food waste. Even the flatware and packaging is corn-based, compostable and biodegradable.
Behind the restaurant, a pallet herb garden 
hangs artfully on a concrete wall and hosts fresh basil, oregano and rosemary, which go directly into the dishes. Due to an accident in the outdoor compost bin involving a sprout-ing rogue seed, wild calabaza plants domi-nate almost half the yard area. 
In the spirit of fall, Tempo Bistro further 
embraces the Slow Food Movement by incor -
porating local calabaza pumpkins from Pos-sum Hollow Farm into its fare.
One special, the Sweet Corn and Calabaza 
Soup, trades a traditional cream base for veg-
an-friendly coconut milk. Small chunks of sweet yel-low corn permeate the vel-vety broth and mingle with earthy flavors like onion, garlic and cayenne pepper. It fills you to the brim with hearty warmth and finishes 
with the subtle taste of lingering pumpkin.
Another seasonal special is the Aztec 
Tempeh Calabaza Chili, which is thick with slow-cooked black beans, local tempeh from The Tempeh Shop, fresh-cut veggies, co-coa, espresso and a full bottle of Blue Moon pumpkin beer. After an essential four and a half hours in a slow cooker, the chili fully as-sembles to salute autumn’s savory suprema-cy.  
On Nov. 1, Tempo Bistro will introduce 
the Lowcountry, a southern-style sandwich.
It begins with a puree of pumpkin, beets 
and local honey spread on top of wholesome multigrain bread.
Next, vegetarian collard greens, local tem-
peh, fresh tomato and creamy goat cheese are added in  layers to create a balanced sandwich with a morsel of each flavor in every bite.
Tempo Bistro believes slow food takes 
time. But when fresh, local ingredients com-bine with delicious and interesting flavor pro-files, it’s well worth the wait.

Volunteer at an animal shelter, 
be a bridesmaid, visit all 50 states 
and spend a whole day sleeping. These are only a few bucket list items pinned on Pinterest.com.  Bucket lists are a trending topic online and on campus.
Even Kevin Jonas has a bucket 
list. In a recent episode of “Married To Jonas,” Kevin Jonas revealed the items on his baby bucket list. To Jo-nas, a baby bucket list is a list of things to do before he starts push-ing a baby carriage around. His list features camping, a big family trip, going on tour with the Jonas Broth-ers and riding a Jet Ski.
In August, bucket list was add-
ed to the Merriam-Webster Colle-giate Dictionary.
Merriam-Webster defines buck-
et list as “a list of things that one has not done before but wants to do before dying.”
Some UF seniors created bucket 
lists with what to do before gradu-ating.
Gilda Brown, a nutritional sci-
ence major, said she has a bucket list of things to do around Gainesville. Some to-do’s on her list are to go to the Butterfly Rainforest, the Renaissance Fair, Ichetucknee Springs, a trip excursion and to see the bats fly at the bat houses.
Jeseeka Gustave, a nursing ma-
jor, said she would complete her bucket list with all her friends.
“I wouldn’t want to do that 
stuff alone,” Gustave said.
Some graduating seniors al-
ready feel fulfilled with their lists.
“I don’t think there is anything left to do,” said Jorge Gonzalez, a history major. “I’ve done it all.”
However, Gonzalez still has 
things to do on his bucket list for around the world. Gonzalez said he would like like to travel to Eu-rope, Africa and probably Asia.
Are you inspired to create a 
bucket list? Well, there’s an app for that.     
Elliot Darvick, 28, is the co-
founder of www.unbucket.com and the Unbucket Facebook app. On Unbucket, you can create a bucket list of things to do and in-vite people to that list. People can contribute items to the list, which can be public or private, and at-tach photos, videos and notes to capture the memories.  
Darvick said the purpose of Un-
bucket is to bring people closer.
“I love looking at that com-
pleted app and seeing that long list of things of what we’ve done together,” Darvick said. “Also see-ing emails that something has been added to my list. It lets me know people care about me.”
Darvick said it’s important to 
create a bucket list for yourself and to share it.
“At the end of the day, it’s who 
you do things with,” Darvick said. “Grades matter, but it’s all about the moments.”12, ALLIGATOR � THRUSDAY, OCTOBER 18, 2012

Cory Murchy was a young teenager when he 
had the “aha!” moment in life. He heard Nirvana 
for the first time.
That spark caused Murchy to pursue a career 
as a musician, now playing bass in a band from Seattle called Minus The Bear.
Minus The Bear plays Sunday at the Florida 
Theater with opening acts Cursive and Girl In a Coma. Doors open at 6 p.m.
Tickets are available for $18 on TicketWeb.
com.
Murchy said it has been a couple of years since 
the band played in Gainesville, and it looks for-ward to returning.
“Florida has always been a fun place to play, 
and Gainesville is no different,” he said.
Murchy considers Minus The Bear’s genre as 
rock ‘n’ roll.
“We haven’t allowed ourselves to be pigeon-
holed into one genre, which is what lead to us being a band for so long,” he said.
Formed in 2001, Minus The Bear has released 
five albums and four EPs. The most recent album from the group, which came out on Aug. 28, is called “Infinity Overhead.”
Murchy described the album as “soon-to-be 
classics” and said the entire band feels really comfortable and excited about it.
He said the name for the band came from a 
“late-night drunken goof ball thing,” which re-fers to the 1970s television show “B.J. and The 
Bear.”
A friend of the band went 
on a date, and they asked him how it went. He replied that it went pretty well, a lot like “B.J. and The Bear” minus The Bear.
“We thought that was pret-
ty funny at the time, and it just stuck,” Murchy said.
When it comes to guilty pleasure songs that 
the band likes to listen to while on tour, he said they’re into Katy Perry’s “Teenage Dream.”
“That song is pretty damn good,” Murchy 
said, laughing. “I wouldn’t even say it’s a guilty pleasure. It’s just a pleasure.”
The upcoming stop in Gainesville will include 
a mix of old Minus The Bear classics and songs off the new album.

The crowd screamed for Zoe Jakes before 
it could see her.
Jakes, the belly dancer for Beats Antique, 
crouched behind a white sheet hanging across 
the Florida Theater’s stage. Harsh white back-light painted her image across the suspended canvas, a silhouette that resembled a modern-day Shiva: palms tensely faced upward, dis-playing inhumanly long fingernails. A trio of blades spiked from each of her elbows. Even Jakes’ intricate headdress loomed from be-hind the barrier.
The California-based electronic music 
trio Beats Antique played its first show in Gainesville at the Florida Theater last Thurs-day. About 250 tickets were sold.
Behind Jakes, her husband, instrumen-
talist and composer David Satori, plucked at a viola, producing a high-pitched, gypsy-inspired rhythm. Drummer Tommy Cappel pumped a stream of cross-rhythmic notes on his black Tama Starclassic drum set, matching a deeper, synthesized bass line. A raspy trum-pet snaked through the song’s background.
The crowd twisted to the beat, hypnotized 
by Jakes’ shadow.
Finally, the sound climaxed, and the sheet 
plummeted, showing Jakes in full costume.Her visage was like a porcelain doll, eyes 
locked intensely straight ahead. Dark black hair matched the thick charcoal-colored eye-liner around her eyes and her black corset. Scarlet lipstick matched a bright red and gold dress. Tattoos spread down her abdomen and across her shoulder.
She was beautiful and terrifying at the 
same time.
Jakes bared her tongue, and the crowd 
roared in approval. It was the reaction she wanted.
“I’m an entertainer and a performer as 
much as I am a dancer,” Jakes said later back-stage. “I really enjoy connecting with the au-dience and making them freak out.”
The music set her in motion. A wave of 
motion flowed from Jakes’ fingertips, across her arm and transversing through her stom-ach toward her hips. Every muscle seemed to have equal control as even the dancer’s lips swayed back and forth with the rhythm.
Jakes beckoned to the crowd with 3-inch 
golden pointed nails that spired from each of her fingers. Bright stage lights bounced off the sapphire-, emerald- and ruby-colored orna-ments that embellished her gold headdress.
The combination of fluid grace and exotic 
beauty mesmerized the audience. For a mo-ment, she had become one of the most pow-erful women in electronic music, all without making a sound.
“She is the most entrancing woman 
I’ve seen in my life,” said Caleb Herring, a 21-year-old Santa Fe student. “She’s a Hindu deity. It’s just amazing”
� � �
Out in the crowd, glowing neon hula-
hoops and pairs of color-changing poi balls orbited through the air.
The Florida Theater attracted an audience 
more wild than Satori, the band’s instrumen-talist, was used to seeing. It was the 33-year-old musician’s first show in Gainesville, but he was impressed.
“We have an older crowd on the West 
Coast. Kids are here to party, and they’re here to have a good time and freak out. It’s a dif-ferent kind of energy, but it’s fun to see that response,” Satori said. “After playing in your hometown for years and not ever having that many people at a show, coming to a place for your first time and experiencing that many people — you can’t get used to it.”
Audience members wearing animal 
masks dotted the audience. To the unfamil-iar, it looked like a neon National Geographic -themed masquerade. A pair of men in uni-corn masks smoked cigarettes on the venue’s steps. Nearby, a man wearing a mouse-eared beanie and a neon sash made of glow sticks danced next to his friend in a full-body mon-key costume.
Jared Glosser, a 19-year-old history junior, 
was pouring with sweat in the monkey cos-tume near the front of the stage. The monkey suit is a tradition between Glosser and eight friends; everyone takes a turn being the mon-key at a concert. Beats Antique was Glosser’s first night.
“You can’t be the monkey for too long, 
or else it starts getting to you, but tonight is my night,” he said. “I can get away with any monkey business I want.”
Beats Antique fosters the eclectic experi-
ence.
During the show’s 20-minute encore, vol-
unteer belly dancers wearing hippopotamus, deer and mice masks inflated a 20-foot squid on stage.
“All hail the giant squid!” Satori yelled as 
he donned an oversized, fuzzy duck head.
He bought the head on vacation in Hawaii 
before the band formed, Satori said, and Beats Antique was the perfect opportunity to start using it. The band even started selling its own rubber horse masks at shows.
“We just like the bizarre, weird stuff some-
times,” Satori said. “We like to give them more than they thought they were going to get.”

EIGHT MUSICAL ACTS.

Avenue Writer
When Bam Margera comes to 
Gainesville, he drinks PBR and 
brings his best friends.
Fresh off a plane from Los An-
geles for one night only , Margera, best known for “Jackass” and his own show, “Viva la Bam,” made an appearance at High Dive Mon-day night for a crowd of about 30. A number of local and out-of-state bands performed.
Sitting at a table surrounded by 
an entourage of people, not unlike the usual crowd at High Dive, Marg-era signed whatever was requested, took cellphone pictures, undoubted-ly bound for mobile upload albums, and gave his time to anyone who asked for it.
While some people were there 
to support friends in the night’s performing bands, others — a few die-hards — were there solely for a chance to meet Margera.
Stephanie Dowling, a 19-year-
old graphic design major at Santa Fe College, said not only has she seen everything Margera is in, but, “I pretty much own it all too,” she said. As soon as she heard he was coming, she called her friend and headed downtown. Fortunately , it was far from sold out, as she had heard it might be.
Margera was flanked by best 
friend and fellow skateboarder Brandon Novak for most of the night, and, between the two, a bit of Jackass-style antics ensued. 
After explaining to the audi-
ence that Novak had just stolen and crashed his S55 Mercedes into an-other car of nearly equal value, Mar -
gera delivered a fair and solid punch to his right-hand man. The crowd cheered and the two embraced. About $140,000 of damage had not created bad blood between them.
In an upstairs room of High Dive, 
the level of friendship they share be-came clear. When you understand Novak’s entire left arm, which is tat-tooed up and down with ink dedi-cated in its entirety to Margera, you start to get it. 
He recounted the times Margera 
has saved his life in the way that only a best friend can — recognizing lies and being constantly present, even when it is undeserved. 
At 12 years old, they met as 
arch nemeses in the skateboarding world, and by age 15, Margera was calling his bluffs. Novak sometimes said he was going to Baltimore for something odd, and Margera knew Novak sought drugs there.
“Once, he told me he was go-
ing to Baltimore to pick up a pair of jeans he left there,” Margera said. Novak chimed in, “This guy waited for me for hours. This kid saved my life I don’t know how many times.”When asked why he came to 
Gainesville, he said when some-body offers you a chance to party somewhere with your friends, you take it. He further explained he is on a tour of publicity appearances, the first two of which he missed be-cause of filming schedule conflicts for his upcoming show, which will air on TBS. He said they will both be rescheduled.
Though didn’t reveal the name of 
the show, he said it will be similar to “Jackass,” but he and others will serve on a panel, judging viewers’ videos of stunts and rating them.
He explained he has also been 
doing art recently . A blurry picture on his cracked cellphone was the only example he had to offer. The medium? Tempera paint, watercol-or and egg yolk. 
Bam Margera brought high jinks to High Dive, hosted show 
“This guy waited for me 
for hours. This kid saved my 
life I don’t know how many 
times.”

�THE GATORS HAVE SEVEN 
INTERCEPTIONS IN 2012.  
  GREG LUCA
 Alligator Staff Writer
 
  After ﬁ  nishing No. 113 in the 
NCAA with a minus-12 turnover 
margin last season, Florida ranks 14th nationally with a plus-seven margin so far in 2012. 
  Of the many explanations Gators 
players and coaches give for the shift, defensive tackle Omar Hunter’s is the simplest. 
  “Guys are trying extra hard, I 
guess,” Hunter said. 
  If only it were that simple.   “I wish it was,” defensive coordi-
nator Dan Quinn said. “I would have told them to try harder earlier.”
  One thing that hasn’t changed for 
UF is the focus coaches put on turn-overs in practice. 
  Throughout the past two seasons, 
Quinn and coach Will Muschamp have harped on the importance of ball-hawking and using the pass rush to create takeaway opportunities. 
  “We’ve tried to emphasize it ev-
erywhere I’ve been,” Muschamp said. “We certainly didn’t do a good job last year.”
  The Gators forced only 14 turn-
overs in 13 games last season, includ-ing just eight interceptions. 
  Through six games this season, 
Florida has 11 takeaways, including seven interceptions. 
  “We’re doing a little better job 
this year,” Muschamp said. “We’ve just got to continue to emphasize it. We talk about it every day.”
The Gators defense is more com-
fortable during its second season in the same system, leading to more takeaways. 
    Cornerback Jaylen Watkins 
said his second-quarter intercep-tion against Kentucky — when he jumped under Morgan Newton’s at-tempted slant pass and brought the pick back for a touchdown — was a play he would not have made last season. 
  His teammates have seen the 
same type of boost in Year 2.
  “Being that this is our second year 
running this style of defense gave us an edge to play faster,” safety Josh Evans said.  “Now guys know what After down 2011, Gators forcing more turnovers this season 
JURNY DUTY
A    s soon as the Southeastern 
Conference released sta-tistics following last week-
end’s games, the outcry was inevi-table.
  The Gators are last in the SEC in 
passing offense.
  A team that unbalanced can’t 
contend for a national title, right?
  That’s not correct. Balanced is 
overrated.
  Winning a national title while 
throwing for less than 100 yards 
is nearly impossible. And Florida couldn’t even reach triple digits against Vanderbilt and LSU. But the aerial attack the Gators displayed in those games is not the best Jeff Driskel and the rest of the offense have to offer.
  We haven’t seen it the last two 
weeks, but Driskel is capable of throwing down the ﬁ  eld. He showed that when he completed a 39-yard pass to Omarius Hines against Tex-as A&M and a 23-yard touchdown to Jordan Reed against Tennessee. F r a n k i e Hammond Jr. has also shown the ability to turn short comple-tions into long gains 
with touchdowns of 75 and 50 yards.
  Just because the Gators haven’t 
done that consistently doesn’t mean they can’t continue to win. They just need to make enough big passing plays to keep defenses from loading the box.
  Timing issues hindered UF’s 
passing game in the past two con-tests, but Florida will ﬁ  x the prob-lem.
  “It just comes down to, some-
times I feel like I get out of the pocket too early,” Driskel said. “(I) get caught either locking in on a UF’s passing struggles 
not a crucial  problem   JOE MORGAN

  Offensive linemen Jonot-
than Harrison and Xavier Nixon returned to practice on Wednesday. Harrison (right arm) and Nixon (upper-body injury) both left during No. 3 Florida’s 31-17 win against Vanderbilt on Saturday.
  Harrison suffered his inju-
ry during the Gators’ ﬁ  rst of-fensive drive, and Nixon left the game during the second quarter. Sam Robey replaced Harrison at center, and D.J. Humphries came in for Nixon at left tackle.
  Defensive end Dominique 
Easley (knee) and left guard James Wilson (eye) returned to practice on Tuesday. Eas-ley did not play against Van-derbilt on Saturday because of swelling in his knee.
  Despite his injury, Easley 
traveled to Nashville, Tenn., with the team. Wilson, who injured his eye during prac-tice on Oct. 10, did not make the trip. Ian Silberman made his ﬁ  rst career start in Wil-son’s place.
  “It happened in a contract 
drill,” coach Will Muschamp said of Wilson’s injury. “His helmet slipped down and just 
took a pretty good im-pact on the 
eye. I don’t have all of the medi-cal terms for it, but they didn’t 
feel like he needed to be able to have contact through the weekend.”
  Wide receiver Latroy Pitt-
man’s status remains uncer-tain.
  On Monday, Muschamp 
said Pittman (ankle) was questionable for Saturday’s game. Pittman injured his ankle in the second quarter against the Commodores.
  “Not sure about Pittman,” 
Muschamp said. “That would be the one that I would have a question mark on.”
  
  Gamecocks Pox: A hip injury may sideline South Carolina running back Marcus Latti-more against Florida, Game-cocks coach Steve Spurrier said.
  Lattimore did not practice 
on Wednesday, according to South Carolina’s ofﬁ  cial Twit-ter account.
  “There’s probably a good 
chance Kenny (Miles) will end up starting the game,” Spurrier told The Post and Courier. “We’ll see how Mar-cus is by the weekend.”
  Lattimore suffered the in-
jury in No. 9 South Carolina’s 23-21 loss to No. 6 LSU on Saturday in Baton Rouge, La.

The Gators were historically good on 
defense last season.
They held opponents to 60.8 points per 
game — second-fewest in program history. Only the 1983-84 team allowed fewer, giv-
ing up 59.1 points per contest.
In conference play, Florida performed 
even better, allowing 58.6 points per game, fifth in the Southeastern Conference. 
“There were times in the year when our 
defense really carried us and put us in po-sition to win big games,” coach Amanda Butler said. 
Florida’s win against No. 18 Georgia on 
Feb. 19 exemplified her point. Late in the season, the Gators needed to beat a top-25 team to better their chances of making the NCAA Tournament.
Holding the Bulldogs to 38.6 percent 
shooting, the Gators won 61-57. Georgia’s 57 points were nearly 12 fewer than its sea-son average.
Florida’s performance was representa-
tive of the entire season. Opponents shot 
just 38.3 percent from the field — the lowest percentage against a Gators team in more than a decade. 
This season, defense will again be the 
team’s identity.
“When we start teaching and building 
this team, we start with defense,” Butler said. “Our defense allows us to play fast and attack and be athletic.”
With seven freshmen, Butler will be re-
quired to do more teaching than usual. 
Additionally, the Gators lost two of 
their most dynamic defenders from a year ago. 
Lanita Bartley and Deana Allen com-
bined for 106 steals, but both were seniors. Jordan Jones also played a role in Florida’s press before graduating at the end of last season. 
As a team, Florida forced nearly 18 
turnovers per game.
Despite the losses, Butler expects her 
team to have the same mindset. 
“No question that we lost a lot in those 
three, but from the things I have seen thus far, … I really like what I’ve seen,” she said. 
Jaterra Bonds, one of two returning 
starters from last season’s team, said prac-tices have been demanding in the early go-ing. 
Half-court defense has been stressed 
as newcomers learn terminology, spacing and assignments.
When the coaches harp on defense, 
Bonds said, everybody should be paying attention.
“If you don’t play defense for Butler, 
you will not be on the floor,” Bonds said. “If you want to play, you have to play de-fense. No question.”
Butler pushes her team to focus defen-
sively, because the Gators can bring strong defense even when their shots aren’t fall-ing.
“We can count on our defense Nov. 9; 
we can count on our defense March 9,” Butler said. “Regardless of the way our team evolves and regardless of who we are playing, that should be a mainstay for us.”

Since the season began, coach 
Mary Wise has described No. 11 
Florida as a grind-it-out team.
If the Gators are the group 
of “grinders” that Wise claims they are, Holly Pole is the poster child.
The sophomore defensive spe-
cialist out of Ocala has never been asked to get the game-winning kill or assist, but she is the work-house off the bench that serves and scrapes up digs.“Holly has been typical of the 
theme,” Wise said. “She is one of those players who is fine behind the scenes and will just do her job. She’s not going to score the points to help us win, but she’s going to do what we need her to do to keep us from losing.”
Last year, Pole and fellow 
sophomore Madison Monserez were both reserves in the back row. Pole hit two service aces and made 85 digs in 60 sets. 
This year, the Ocala Vanguard 
High grad already has 16 aces and 108 digs — good for second and third on the team — while playing in 57 of UF’s 59 sets.  
She said she has embraced her 
role as the gritty defensive spe-cialist this year, which is why her 
numbers and p r o d u c t i v i t y have increased despite the fact that she plays in only half of UF’s rotations.
“The time I 
do get on the court I try to 
make the most of it and try and make the plays I should make and then go above and beyond and make the ones maybe I shouldn’t make,” Pole said. “It’s just part of my role. I’m not going to get kills. I’m just making sure I can help hold down the back row and take care of the ball when I need to.”
Wise said Pole played her 
breakthrough game Friday against Ole Miss. 
She hit a career-high three ser -
vice aces and racked up a season-high 13 digs in three sets off the bench.
Her performance during the 
weekend leaves Pole trailing only Taylor Unroe and Ziva Recek in digs. She is behind only Unroe for the team lead in aces.
“Holly perhaps had her best 
match of the season,” Wise said of the match against Ole Miss. “She was solid in the back row.”
Unroe, Florida’s libero, leads 
the team with 256 digs but said she is grateful for having Pole to bail her out.
“It’s really nice because Holly 
and I have a really good, trusting relationship in passing and de-fense,” Unroe said.
“It’s nice to know there’s some-
one back there who, if maybe you’re not at the top of your game that day, she can back me up.”

Bask etballan ACL tear in his left knee last 
October, leads the Southeastern Conference with 129 carries in seven games this season.Gamecocks defensive end 
Jadeveon Clowney was limited in practice on Wednesday due to a sore foot, Spurrier said. Clowney ranks third in the SEC with 12 tackles for a loss and 6.5 sacks this season.
South Carolina wide receiver 
Bruce Ellington, offensive tackle Mike Matulis and cornerback Jimmy Legree missed practice on Wednesday due to the flu.
“We’ve had a little bit of a flu 
bug going around,” Spurrier said. “Some guys just been sick the last two or three days.”
Quinn considers Powell elite:  
Defensive coordinator Dan Quinn 
is missing Ronald Powell this sea-son. Quinn said Powell would have likely earned praise similar to that received by South Caroli-na’s Clowney and LSU’s Barkevi-ous Mingo as one of the top defen-sive ends in the SEC this season.
“He would have been men-
tioned with those guys,” Quinn said. “The improvement from the last fall through the spring, it was really significant with Ronald.”
Coaches raved about Powell’s 
performance during spring prac-tices April. Powell suffered an ACL tear in his left knee during the spring game on April 7.
“Each practice, you saw him 
grow and take steps forward,” Quinn said.

South Carolina plays the same brand of 
smash-mouth football that Florida has be-
gun to master. 
Gamecocks coach Steve Spurrier, the man 
who brought the “Fun ‘n’ Gun” offense to the Southeastern Conference, has adjusted his system to suit his players.
South Carolina running back Marcus 
Lattimore leads the SEC in rushing attempts with 129 carries for 584 yards. The Gators’ Mike Gillislee is second with 120 carries. He is also second in rushing yards with 615. 
UF’s Jeff Driskel and USC’s Connor Shaw 
average just 18.5 and 18 pass attempts per game, respectively. They rank last and next to last in the SEC.
“We don’t throw more than 20-25 passes 
a game and try to run the ball and play su-per defense and excellent special teams,” Spurrier said. “I would think both teams are trying to do that.”
Athletic linebackers, a ball-hawking sec-
ondary and increased depth have Florida’s defense ranked 13th in the nation.  
South Carolina ranks No. 12. Since these two teams are so similar, fac-
ing each other in practice might be the best preparation for the Gators. 
“We practice against our defense every 
day, so I feel like they’re going to have a good game because of that,” right guard Jon Halapio said. “[The defense is] pretty much used to a mobile quarterback and a good running back.”
Perhaps the only difference between these 
two is each team’s performance against LSU. The Gators wore down the Tigers with 176 rushing yards and 25-straight runs to close out a 14-6 home victory on Oct. 6. 
South Carolina didn’t fare as well dur-
ing their visit to Baton Rouge, La., last week. LSU pestered Shaw all night and gained 258 
rushing yards. 
Florida’s performance 
against LSU gives the 
Gators confidence going into Saturday’s matchup.
“I feel like we can do 
that against anybody, re-ally,” Halapio said. “Just the way we practice. Just the way our mentality is 
this year. We’re just really relentless, espe-cially up front. Yeah, pretty much, we can wear down anybody. I feel pretty strong about that.”
Florida has dropped its past two games 
in the series with South Carolina, adding motivation to its attempt to beat the Game-cocks at their own game. 
Florida squandered a chance at an SEC ti-
tle game appearance in 2010, when these two teams last faced each other in Gainesville. 
Senior safety Josh Evans called losing 
that game a feeling he’ll never forget.
“It’s definitely revenge, man,” he said. 
“You also want to go out there and just to get this win. It would mean a lot to this team and definitely the roll we’re on this year.”
A win on Saturday puts the Gators two 
games up in the SEC Eastern Division. For the Gamecocks, a win keeps them in nation-al title contention and continues their recent success against Florida.
“We realize it’s an extremely important 
game down there in The Swamp,” Spurrier said. “Hopefully, our guys will be ready to play their best one of the year.”

Florida, South Carolina enter matchup with similar styles 
receiver or watching the rush. 
As a quarterback, you can’t do that.”
The lack of big plays against 
the Commodores can also be at-tributed to drops and the Gators taking advantage of the worst rushing defense in the SEC. Flor -
ida had no reason to throw the ball and risk turnovers if Driskel could keep running wild as Van-derbilt failed to adjust to the read-option.
Despite throwing for just 61 
yards against LSU, Florida won by rushing for 160 yards in the second half.
No one should fault the Gators for sticking to what’s working.
While getting those rushing 
yards might not be as easy on Saturday against South Caroli-na, which fields the 12th-ranked defense in the country, UF will still have opportunities to make plays through the air. 
The Gamecocks have allowed 
20 or more yards on a passing play 20 times this season, tied for 66th in the nation.
LSU showed on Saturday that 
UF won’t need a dominant pass-ing attack to defeat South Caro-lina.

cocks 23-21 and rushed for 258 yards while throwing for only 148. That ratio is a good target for the Gators. But, if they con-tinue to run this effectively, it shouldn’t be a goal.
“Whether [Driskel] ends up 
throwing for 300 or rushing for a record like he does, I don’t re-ally care how it gets done,” of-fensive coordinator Brent Pease said. “As long as we’re produc-tive with what we do and score points.”
Pease is right not to put too 
much on Driskel. Asking him to throw for 300 yards in any game would be a stretch. Driskel just needs to make enough plays to keep defenses honest, which he has shown the ability to do. If he can do that, the offense will be fine.

they’re doing. We can actually 
play quicker in a game.”
Better knowledge of the 
system has also led to im-proved communication in the secondary. Players have a bet-ter understanding of where they have to line up in the for -
mation, which frees them to make plays. 
Evans also credited the 
secondary’s improvement to extra work in the film room. The ability to recognize a pass route as it is developing gives UF’s defensive backs extra time to get in position and make a play, Evans said.  
While the coaches have 
emphasized turnovers since the beginning of last season, Quinn said the players have started to put more focus on generating takeaways. 
“Although we emphasized 
it last year, maybe the players to each other are emphasizing it more,” Quinn said. “When another teammate’s telling you and reminding you, may-be that’s a little different. … When it comes from a player or another teammate, I think that adds value.”
Linebacker Jon Bostic said 
Florida’s opponents also factor in the shift. 
Teams are attempting 35 
passes per game against UF this season, compared to only 26.2 per game last year. 
“Offenses are playing a 
lot more aggressive than they were last year,” Bostic said. “They have to put the ball in the air and do a lot of different things to win games.”
For the second season in a 
row, UF coaches are empha-sizing attacking the ball in the air and going for a strip once the first defender has the ball carrier wrapped up. 
In 2012, the results of that 
work are finally starting to show. 
“We practice every day on 
creating turnovers,” Hunter said. “It’s just carrying over to the game.”

 �COACHES EXPECTED HARRIS TO 
HELP UF’S FRONTCOURT IN PRACTICE.
KATIE AGOSTIN
Alligator Staff Writer
Damontre Harris knew he would have 
to sit out the season when he transferred to 
Florida from South Carolina in May, but he hoped he could at least help the team during practice.
“This is a great year for me to get real bet-
ter so I can have an opportunity to show all my talent next year when I have the oppor -
tunity to play,” Harris said on Oct. 10. “I just love to compete, so I think I’ll be able to help [the team] out a lot.”
However, Harris will no longer bring 
depth to Florida’s practices. Coach Billy Donovan announced on Wednesday that Harris dislocated his shoulder and suffered a labrum tear when a teammate fell on him during a weekend practice.
Harris plans to consult his family and a 
doctor before deciding whether he should have surgery. If he undergoes surgery, the junior would be out of practice until at least March. 
“If he doesn’t have surgery, the likelihood 
of it popping out again is a pretty high per -
centage,” Donovan said. “[Torn labrums], if you do do surgery, are a long, long time to heal. You’re probably talking him being out for four to six months.”
Harris would have sat out this year re-
gardless because of NCAA transfer rules, but he hoped to contribute in practice. The 6-foot-10 center was an ideal opponent 
for junior Patric Young because of his size and talent as a shot-blocker. Last season with the Gamecocks, Harris was second in the South-eastern Conference with 71 blocks, averaging 2.3 per game. He trailed only Kentucky’s An-thony Davis, who made 186 blocks.
As a team, the Gators tallied only 124 
blocks last season. 
“Just offensively playing against Patric, it 
was good for Patric and it was good for [Har -
ris],” Donovan said. “That’s a real significant loss in my opinion to us in practice … because he was doing pretty well in the first couple of practices. Now with him being gone, I think it hurts his development and it hurts our team a little bit.”
