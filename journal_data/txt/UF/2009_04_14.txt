Historic flooding is forcing 
people to evacuate their hous-
es in Alachua County and the 
rest of northern Florida.
Experts say that rainfall 
might cause water levels in rivers such as the Suwannee 
and Santa Fe to rise further af-
ter two weeks of flooding. 
“You’re not going to have 
water running down the streets of Gainesville,” said Karen 
Parker, public information co-ordinator for the Florida Fish 
and Wildlife Conservation Commission. “But folks living by the river will definitely be 
affected.”
Right now the water is re-
ceding, she said, but fallen tree 
branches and trash, combined 
with strong currents, could 
make boating dangerous.
Until conditions improve, the Suwannee and Santa Fe rivers are idle-speed zones.  
Parker said the information 
on how much money will be 
spent on the recovery and the 
extent of the damage won’t be completely assessed until the water recedes, and that may take days depending on the weather, temperature and evaporation speed.
There’s also flooding in 
other parts of north Florida.
As of Monday morning, 
there were two confirmed ca-sualties in Okaloosa County. 
About 125 homes were de-
stroyed and about 100 severe-ly damaged, said Mike Stone, 
spokesman for the Florida Di-Flooding  may persist

Student Government joined the blogosphere 
on Monday. 
The new SG budget-cut blog allows UF 
students to discuss topics and share concerns 
about the round of budget cuts affecting UF’s colleges. 
Jordan Johnson, who will be taking over as 
UF’s Student Body president in May, said the blog was created to ensure that students’ input on the matter is heard.
Johnson said he plans to take student con-
cerns  expressed in the posts to a meeting with UF President Bernie Machen, although the meeting has not been scheduled yet. 
“It makes (Machen’s) job easier when he un-derstands the students’ needs,” Johnson said.
Johnson said he doesn’t feel the Web site 
was launched too late because since the cut proposals were not announced until recently, students have been unaware of what programs 
were in danger of getting sliced. 
“This is the point were 
Student Government has 
to make sure students’ voices are heard,” he said. 
However, Johnson said the blog still needs 
some improvements.
“We still have some kinks that aren’t worked 
out,” he said, adding that categories with sec-tions for each college will make it more user 
UF FACULTYSG launches budget blog

An independent arbitrator has ruled that 
UF did not violate its contract with the faculty union when it increased the teaching load of Florence Babb, professor of women’s studies at UF, according to insidehighered.com.
Babb, an endowed professor and gradu-ate coordinator of UF’s Center for Women’s Studies and Gender Research, challenged the change to her schedule last April. An arbitra-tion hearing was held in February.
According to Alligator archives, Babb 
received a letter in 2004 detailing the terms of her hire. It indicated she would teach one course per semester and would be given a re-search assistant.
Endowed faculty often have lighter teach-ing loads in order to focus on research. 
In March, a letter from 
UF Provost Joe Glover in-formed her she would be teaching two classes per se-
mester because of the state’s financial difficulties and “severe” budget cuts at UF. 
Her research assistant was taken away as well, according to Alligator archives.
John Biro, president of UF’s chapter of the 
United Faculty of Florida, the faculty union, said the decision could diminish the confi-dence that faculty have in their agreements with UF.
Glover could not be reached by e-mail late 
Monday afternoon and Babb declined to com-ment. A copy of the arbitrator’s decision could not be obtained on Monday from UF.

State seeks death penalty in Anthony case
ORLANDO (AP) — Florida prosecutors 
plan to seek to the death penalty against the mother of slain Florida toddler Caylee An-thony.
Prosecutors filed papers Monday of intent 
to seek to have 23-year-old Casey Anthony executed if she is convicted of first-degree murder in her daughter’s death, said Danielle Tavernier, a spokeswoman for the State Attor-ney’s Office in Orlando.
Anthony claims that Caylee, who was 2 years old when she disappeared in June, was kidnapped and has pleaded not guilty. Her trial has been tentatively set for October.
Anthony’s legal team already has lawyers 
who are qualified to defend death penalty cas-es and are prepared “for a vigorous defense,” said Marti Mackenzie, a spokeswoman for An-thony’s attorney, Jose Baez.
“This is not a death penalty case,” Macken-
zie said. “We will do whatever is necessary to defend Casey Anthony from the state trying to take her life.”StudentGovernmentSEE FLOOD, p AGE 5

Mexico slams Burger King 
for ‘whopper’ of insult
MEXICO CITY (AP) — Mex-
ico is protesting what it says is a whopper of an insult.
An advertisement for Burger 
King’s Texican Whopper burger 
that has run in Europe shows a small wrestler dressed in a cape resembling a Mexican flag. The wrestler teams up with a lanky American cowboy almost twice his height to illustrate the cross-border blend of flavors.
“The taste of Texas with a 
little spicy Mexican,” a narrator’s voice says.
The taller cowboy boosts the 
wrestler up to reach high shelves and helps clean tall windows, while the Mexican helps the cow-boy open a jar.
Mexico’s ambassador to Spain 
said Monday he has written a letter to Burger King’s offices in that nation objecting to the ad and asking that it be removed. Jorge Zermeno told Radio For-mula that the ads “improperly use the stereotyped image of a Mexican.”
Press officials at Burger King 
Corp. offices in Miami, Florida, and Madrid, Spain, did not im-mediately respond to requests for comment. Burger King is known for its signature Whopper hamburger.

Policymaker discusses future of health care in U.S.ON CAMPUS
By TATIANA GONZALEZ 
Alligator Contributing Writer
Future health care reform in the United 
States will emphasize cost-effective treatment, 
upping health insurance requirements and healthy habits for citizens, according to Kris-tine Blackwood.   
Blackwood, chief counsel for the U.S. Sen-
ate special committee on aging, spoke to an audience of about 100 in the Pugh Hall Ocora  Monday night about proposed health care re-form initiatives being discussed in Congress.
“These reforms are going to touch your 
life, even if you’re a student,” Blackwood said, citing initiatives such as wellness programs and pushing generic drugs over brand-name counterparts.
According to Blackwood, Congress has 
created broad concepts for health care re-form, such as  requiring all Americans to have health insurance and requiring nearly all busi-
ness owners to provide some sort of coverage, 
based on the size of their work force. 
Congress, along with the Obama admin-
istration, is determined to succeed where the Clinton administration failed, she said. Un-like 1992, Blackwood said, today’s health care reform process will be more transparent and already has private insurance companies in on the discussion. 
“There’s a sense of guarded optimism in 
Washington right now,” she said, adding the 
legislation will likely be cre-ated this summer and fall.
In a 20-minute question-
and-answer session follow-
ing the 40-minute speech, 
one student pointed to the national debt and asked whether the administra-tion was worried about ris-ing inflation, and if citizens 
would have to bring “wheel-barrows of mon-ey” to see their doctor in the coming years.In response, Blackwood said members of 
Congress have to invest money in the health care reforms in order to create a healthy econ-omy in the future. 
“We’ll keep paying more if we don’t fix it 
now,” she said, “We have to take control of the cost monster.”
UF sophomore Matthew Newman, who 
attended the event, said the talk was a little re-dundant given his personal political aptitude. “The stuff I didn’t know was insightful and did give a unique perspective,” he added. 
Blackwood’s speech was sponsored by the 
Bob Graham Center for Public Service and paid for by the U.S. Senate.

In an age when publications are 
struggling to make the switch from 
print to online, one online magazine is working on finally making it to print.
BlackListed, a student-run maga-
zine released only on the Internet, hopes to have its first printed issue by the end of the spring semester. 
The staff hopes the move to print 
will help increase readership on campus, said staff writer and UF freshman Alisa Valentin.
The magazine has been around 
since 2003 and serves as a voice for African-Americans and other minor-ities at UF. Every Tuesday, the staff adds at least five articles to the pub-lication’s Web site, said staff writer and UF freshman Ayana Flewellen.
All 11 staff writers also take pho-
tos and edit, said staff writer Brianti Downing, a UF journalism junior. They’ve tried to keep up with recent technology by introducing video and sound to their Web site.
For now, readership mainly 
consists of Gainesville residents, but there are readers at local high schools, The Florida State Univer-sity and Florida Agricultural and Mechanic University. 
One article about college stu-
dents’ fascination with Greek life reached readers as far as the state of Washington.
“Being online is so useful,” said 
staff writer Cayla Williams, a UF public relations freshman. “It’s easy to update, get access to and reach a larger audience.”
The transition to paper, however, 
has proven to be difficult, Flewellen said, because it’s harder to find will-ing advertisers. 
The staff must also learn to 
change from online writing to print writing. Their articles are not short stories written in Associated Press style, used by most news publica-tions. Flewellen said their articles sometimes reach more than a thou-sand words.
“BlackListed is a way to be cre-
ative,” Valentin said. “It’s fun creat-ing our own style.”
The magazine can be viewed at

� STORE OWNERS HAVING TROUBLE 
FINDING BUSINESS LOCATIONS.
Sexually oriented businesses are having 
trouble finding legal places to open shop in 
Gainesville, which could pose problems for the city.On Monday, the Gainesville City Com-
mission consulted Eric Kelly, a land zoning expert, on how to meet the constitutional re-quirement to provide proper zoning for all types of businesses.
In the past six months, the prospective 
owners of an adult bookstore and a “gentle-man’s club” contacted the city with concerns about a lack of proper zoning, said Ralph Hilliard, the city’s planning manager. 
If a sexually oriented busi-
ness were to challenge the con-stitutionality of Gainesville’s zoning ordinances, they may 
be able to place a shop in areas undesirable to the Gainesville City Commission, Kelly said.
“Essentially, an unconstitutional zoning 
ordinance is like having no ordinance at all in Gainesville,” Kelly said.                               
 The Commission will likely not meet 
on the issue again for several months, said Commissioner Jeanna Mastrodicasa.

will be serving up these flavors of 
vegan ice cream along with seven others starting today.  The shop also serves coffee, baked goods and dairy-based ice cream.
“Gainesville is a pretty progres-
sive place. But it’s hard to find a good vegan dessert place in this 
town,” said Kyle Fick, co-owner of 
Karma Kream. “We just assessed a 
need and filled it.”
Fick and co-owner Payal Pa-
tel,  have been readying the shop for roughly a year. When they 
began renting, they had “watch 
this space” painted on the shop’s 
window, six months later it was changed to “patience, we’re still at 
it.”
The shop is furnished with 100 
percent reused or recycled mate-rial, much of which came from an 
old Baskin Robbins, Patel said.A painting of a tree laden with 
ice-cream cones decorates one 
tabletop, and multi-colored lamp-
shades hang from the ceiling, all hand-painted.
A small cup of ice cream costs 
$3.40 , a medium is $4.20 and a 
large is $4.90.
“I can’t even finish a small,” 
Fick said.
Fick, a vegetarian, and Patel, 
a vegan, both say they have thor-oughly researched foods for their 
own diets, which translates to an awareness of all the ingredients used in Karma Kream’s products.
They are careful to make sure 
their organic milk does not come from factory farming, which is cruel to animals, Fick said.

UF spokeswoman Janine Sikes said the

Sikes said Machen’s budget proposal 
will be posted on SG’s budget blog on Thursday. UF religion senior Tom Reynolds, who 
was the site’s first blogger, said he was glad to see SG take a proactive approach on the issue, but is unsure the impact it will have 
on administration.

ment doesn’t wield any real power, but they can

Today’s question: Could you 
land a plane if your pilot became unconscious during the flight?27% YES73% NO
103 TOTAL VOTESMonday’s question: Did you bite off the head of a chocolate Easter bunny?Justice Served  
Navy SEALs save captain 
from Somali pirates
Flight of Fright Somali pirates up to snuff with Web 2.0Column
The American media worked themselves into such a frenzied pirate orgy over the long Easter week-end that they forgot to check and see if the actual 
pirates had something to say.
During the press conference explaining just how the 
Navy SEALs rescued Capt. Richard Phillips, CNN and Fox spent valuable airtime reading user comments post-ed on their Web sites by random, excited idiots. 
Other than the shadowy newsworthiness of highlight-
ing the plague of grammatical abortions that make up a vast majority of Web 2.0 blogs and posts, this wasted TV 
time only confirmed my sneaking suspicion that abso-
lutely nobody with an active wireless connection has any 
idea that the word “their” is not interchangeable with the word “they’re.”
Instead of reading about how prayerful and happy 
everybody was that the captain was rescued, the news 
stations could have been following the Web 2.0 trail left 
by one of the actual pirates.
Captured pirate Mohamed Abdi is a 16-year-old boy 
with a cell phone. You think he doesn’t have a MySpace account?
Well, Abdi – who prefers to be called “Dirty Mo” or 
by his Twitter handle “pirate_eyes” – reportedly quit us-ing MySpace a few months ago because the site took too long to load pages on his iPhone. His main communica-tion outlet during the hostage standoff was on Twitter, where Mo apparently sent a bunch of Tweets both before and after his capture by U.S. military forces.   
Since I was apparently one of the few American re-
porters who even knew about this invaluable line of communication representing the authentic voice of mod-ern piracy, I thought that I would share with my readers some of the more interesting and potentially eye-opening Tweets Mo sent during this tense time.

we from Somalia!! I stay strapped b4 I put on shoes
Quite obviously, 140 characters or less is all that 
one needs to sum up the myriad concerns surrounding 
the Somali pirate scourge just recently noticed by most Americans. Twitter and other Web 2.0 sites offer such in-sightful and essential inroads into the complex human issues that will come to define our times that they surely have a great deal of social import. However, I cannot stay and Tweet on this right now – I am chatting with Kim Jong-Il about how stupid a name “Bo” is for a Portuguese water dog.
Tommy Maple is an international communications gradu-
ate student. His column appears on Tuesdays.For the typical American, 
Easter Sunday means a rat race of extended 
church services, marathon meals with relatives and or-
ganizing an egg hunt – but 
hardly landing airplanes.
Unless, of course, you 
happen to be a passenger on a flight where your pilot just died.
What started out as a 
typical Sunday trek from Marco Island to Jackson, 
Miss., quickly turned into 
a nightmare once it became apparent Capt. Joe Cabuk was no longer in control of the plane.
Lucky for the passengers 
on board, one individual of-fered them a chance of sur-vival.
While Doug White had 
basic flying experience with single-engine planes, he was forced to quickly learn on the job how to maneuver a much larger King Air plane with the only assistance coming from over a headset
Miraculously White, 
whose name was initially not made available to media, 
defied all logic by landing 
the plane on his first try at Southwest International Air-port in Fort Myers.
The Editorial Board com-
mends passenger-turned-pilot White for managing to escape disaster with his presence of mind in taking 
over the reins of the plane.
Not only does White de-
serve much due credit for his 
heroic efforts in the cockpit, but the air traffic controllers in Miami should be scored with a clutch assist.
Maybe it’s just us, but we 
think White and his fam-
ily will gladly deal with the 
misery of flying commercial on their next plane trip.
The prospects of one inch 
in knee space never sounded so enticing.The most special Easter Sunday of Capt. Richard Phil-lips’ life had nothing to do with the typical holiday fare of oversized chocolate bunnies or a plethora of purple 
Peeps.
He regained his freedom.
Thanks to the heroic efforts of three U.S. Navy SEALs, spe-
cially trained to deal with hostage situations, Phillips man-
aged to escape from the control of three Somali pirates on Sunday evening.
With a shot to the head of each of the pirates, the SEALs 
were able to secure Phillips and bring to an end a particularly tenuous situation that had dragged on for the better part of a week.
According to an article on CNN.com, hostage negotiations 
had come to a standstill between the U.S. military and the pi-rates – forcing the hand of President Barack Obama to autho-rize lethal force if Phillips’ safety became a major concern.
Since the pirates threatened Phillips’ life on numerous 
occasions, even pointing an AK-47 assault rifle at him, the SEALs were forced to seize an opportunity in which the cap-tors exposed parts of their body, making sniper fire a pos-sibility.
The Editorial Board commends the U.S. military, specifi-
cally the U.S. Navy SEALs, for its impressive response to the hostage situation off the coast of Somalia.
Not only did the SEALs manage to save Phillips from a 
possible death--they were able to avoid a bloody massacre through three highly executed sniper shots to the head.
Lest we forget to applaud Phillips, whose mental resolve 
and determination to stay alive exhibited outstanding charac-ter during what we can only imagine was an extraordinarily horrific ordeal.

Letter to the Editor
Farmers must demand right to grow pot
Although I can understand the frustration felt 
by Matthew Vann in his letter to the editor and 
tobacco farmers in general, I also understand the 
reasoning behind taxing a dangerous product 
that creates a huge burden on the state’s health care system. 
Like every other industry, these tobacco farm-
ers need to adapt to the changing political and economic climate. 
Rather than dwell on the numerous negative 
effects of tobacco taxation, these farmers need to be looking at other profitable farming options. 
Fortunately, Florida is ideal for growing hemp, 
and perhaps these struggling tobacco farmers should demand from our government that medi-cal marijuana and hemp farming be legalized. 
These farmers would be able to greatly profit 
from the sale of hemp, which can be used to make rope and paper products among many other things. 
Also, the medicinal purposes of marijuana 
have proven to be highly effective, safe and could possibly benefit millions of Florida’s elderly pa-tients in need of care. 
Furthermore, it costs about $20,000 per year to 
house an inmate in a Florida prison. 
If marijuana were decriminalized, the state 
would be able to save countless millions of dol-lars in prison costs due to a decrease in nonvio-lent marijuana crimes.

The comic featured last week—
concerning the hazing inci-dents that brought the UF 
chapter of Sigma Lambda Gamma to its second suspension for hazing 
violations  — legitimized and down-
played the crimes of which the orga-
nization has been found guilty. 
As someone who was once a vic-
tim of hazing, I can attest that it is no joking matter. The rules commonly used by many of the organizations in the Multicultural Greek Council and National Pan-Hellenic Council 
include: bans on social interaction 
outside of the organization, sleep de-privation, excessive exercising, bans on accessing certain parts of campus (such as Turlington Plaza or the Re-itz Union) bans on online network-ing, bans on any form of interaction with other Greek members, bans on smoking, drinking and sexual in-
tercourse and bans on “shortcuts,” 
which could be interpreted to be just about anything.
How do you think a group of sim-
ilarly aged peers force new members to comply with these absurd rules? Fear. At the almost daily “educa-tion sessions” (which can happen at any time of the day or night and 
may last several hours) it is common 
for new members to be blindfolded, shouted at, pushed, shoved, humili-ated, sometimes beaten and psycho-l o g i c a l l y tormented. New mem-bers are also forced 
to perform excessive push-ups, standing exercises and other physi-cal activities until they have reached muscular failure. New members caught breaking the rules will be “pledged” harder.
There may be certain benefits to 
this — you might build some broth-erhood/sisterhood with the people 
with whom you were hazed, you 
might shed some pounds and you might even gain some muscle tone. But after this “process” you will un-doubtedly have some psychological scars.  
To the Greek organizations that 
are caught up in the ego competi-tion to see which organization hazes 
the hardest: shame on you. Can’t 
you find more innovative and less barbaric means of building broth-erhood/sisterhood? It seems you have forgotten the definition of the terms that supposedly define your existence. 
To any students considering join-
ing a Greek organization: do your 
research. You can usually tell or find 
out if an organization hazes or not. Don’t just ask them up front--any organization will deny it. Talk to people in the community, and you can usually tell. Ask yourself if you really want to be part of an organi-zation that not only hazes but prides itself on it. 
The bruises I gained from my 
time “on-line” (pledging) are gone, but the psychological damage is still there, even after a few semesters. 
It is a shame that Sigma Lambda 
Gamma has been caught twice for hazing, but hopefully its punish-ment will not be in vain, and Greek organizations at UF can mature past 
such behavior.
This column was submitted by 
a fraternity member who wishes to 
remain anonymous.
Antiquated practice of hazing reveals dark side of Greek life
As Earth Day quickly approaches and 
students search for ways to become “green,” it should be stressed that re-
cycling is not the answer. 
Not the answer in the sense that it is un-
known how many bottles and old newspapers in our recycling bins actually find their way to the recycling plant. Too many times your be-loved disposables, hand-selected by you to be reborn into something new, are carried miles and miles away to the nearest landfill, leaving behind contaminating carbon footprints in the process. Not the answer in the sense that recy-cling still consumes energy. 
Recycling alone does not benefit humanity 
as the plan intended. It is in need of its brother and sister, Reduce and Reuse, who have been left behind in this green frenzy. 
With Earth Day on the horizon, help bring 
back the lost siblings. Give yourself a one-up over that I-recycle-but-still-drive-an-SUV neighbor. Make him cringe. 
If you are the SUV-driving neighbor, you now at least have the opportunity to make up for it.
Invest in your very 
own worm compos-
ter. Yes, I said worm 
composter. With one of these babies, you’ll 
be making your own nutrient-rich fertilizer in no time (and be bringing on the competition of the greener summertime lawn). More im-portantly, you will be reducing the amount of garbage that travels to landfills every year and your carbon footprint on the planet. 
Worm composters manufactured by 
Worm Factory consist of about four square plastic bins stacked one on top of another. The top three bins are going to hold your leftover food waste, paper and red wiggler worms. As microbes eat away at your garbage, the red wigglers consume the microbes, producing nutrient-rich worm castings. 
The worm manure can then be disposed of 
in your garden or yard.The Worm Factory composter is compact, 
odor-free (if used correctly) and can be stored under your kitchen sink. It can be found online and is a no-brainer to assemble. The worms can consume about five to eight pounds of 
food a day, providing you with rich compost 
every month. 
You would be reducing your waste and re-
using it as fertilizer. Hopefully, you will con-tinue to recycle all of your non-compostable packaging, making the family of “R”s com-plete and benefitting society to the best of its ability. Much more efficient than letting lonely brother Recycle do all the work, right?
If the idea of having a worm farm in your 
kitchen causes your stomach to churn, have no fear. Hop on the bandwagon; use reusable canvas totes instead of plastic bags for grocery shopping and Bio Bags (biodegradable, com-postable garbage bags) to dispose your waste. 
A big money saver? Stop drinking bottled 
water. America’s tap water is strictly regulat-ed and, unlike bottled water, tested multiple times a day. 
The Gainesville 2008 Water Quality Report 
is available online. 
Don’t like the taste? Invest in a water puri-
fying pitcher. It will save you hundreds if not 
thousands of dollars over a lifetime. 
On your way to grab a cup o’ Joe? Use a 
thermos or traveler’s mug. Many coffee shops 
will offer about a 10 cent discount on your cof-fee if you are sporting a reusable mug. If you were to pay a visit to Starbucks every day for 10 months out of the year, thats an easy $28 back in your pocket to pay for the thermos you invested in. 
Whatever way you choose to participate in 
Earth Day, make sure that you take all facets of the process into account. While recycling is a step toward a more ecologically friendly fu-ture, it does not work as well standing alone. Hopefully, cultivating creepy-crawlies for the production of fresh fertilizer will be at the top of your list.

ALLIGATOR FILE REPORT
You’re getting ready to graduate. The 
family’s coming. You need to show them 
what you’ve been up to for the past four (or five or six) years. So here are a few places to be sure to take the whole crew, or to check out if you never got around to it:
UnIOn STREET FARmERS’ mARkET: 
The market has offered an intimate, vibrant 
setting and a chance to buy goods from lo-cal farmers since 1996. Every Wednesday afternoon, you can browse the organic 
produce, baked goods and handmade 
pottery while listening to live acoustic mu-sic. Products include organic coffee, nuts, vegetables, fruits, soaps and jewelry.
HOmETOwn PIzzA JOInTS: When it 
comes to pizza in Gainesville, there are 
some classics that every student must sam-ple before graduation.  Leonardo’s By The Slice and Mellow Mushroom are near cam-pus and are great options for lunch in the middle of a day full of classes. Satchel’s Pizza is a bit farther, and you might wait a bit for a table. But once you bite into that first slice, it will be well worth the wait.
HARE kRISHnA LUnCH:  Even if veg-
etarianism isn’t your thing, you may be 
surprised to find yourself going back for a 
free second serving of eggplant, rice and coconut cake. Dishes vary daily, but are always “karma-free.” Pick up a $4 plate on the Plaza of the Americas weekday af-ternoons.
HIPPODROmE THEATRE: Founded in 
1973, the Hippodrome Theatre has been 
offering Gainesville residents exposure to artsy shows and films for decades. For an out-of-the-box entertainment experience, check out a play on the upstairs main stage, or a foreign flick in the intimate screening room.STUbbIE’S SHIRT PUb: For internation-
al flavor and great service, head over to Stubbie’s Shirt Pub on University Avenue. The pub features more than 150 types of beer from countries such as Brazil, Can-ada, Israel, Thailand and Namibia — not to mention dozens from across the United States.
OCALA POkER AnD JAI-ALAI: Located 
about 30 miles south of Gainesville in Or-
ange Lake, Ocala Poker and Jai-Alai of-fers a plethora of entertainment options in addition to the popular South Florida sport, from watching and wagering to drinking and eating to catching a sports 
game on one of more than 50 high-defi-
nition screens. The facility recently added poker. Jai-alai is played this spring from early April to April 30, and there are two performances — a matinee and an evening performance — every Tuesday through Sat-urday.
GInnIE SPRInGS: At Ginnie Springs, 
located about 30 miles northwest of Gainesville in High Springs, you can ca-
noe, tube, snorkel and scuba dive in caves amid beautiful natural surroundings. A campground is also on site.
LAkE wAUbURG: At UF’s Lake Wauburg 
— eight miles south of campus on State 
Road 441 — you can relax and enjoy out-door activities, including boating, water skiing, volleyball, picnicking and climbing 
a 55-foot wall. UF faculty and staff have 
free access to the lake, and four guests are allowed per Gator 1 Card.
DEVIL’S mILLHOPPER GEOLOGICAL 
STATE PARk: At Devil’s Millhopper Geo-
logical State Park, you can walk around 
the edge and down to the bottom of a 10,000-year-old, 120-foot deep sinkhole.
GATORS bASEbALL AnD SOFTbALL:  
Though basketball season is over and foot-
ball season is months off, UF’s baseball and softball teams are still competing, so you can still show off your orange-and-blue pride to your family and friends. 
Where to take the family when they’re in Gainesville

Casey Anderson / Alligator Staff10 Lake Wauburg
Lake Wauburg offers UF 
students fun — for free. Just 
bring your Gator 1 Card to Wauburg, and 
you and your friends can go fishing, canoe-ing, kayaking, sailing and swimming. It’s the ultimate Gainesville outdoor experience. Head down Southwest 13th Street toward Micanopy and you’ll see the sign for the lake.
9Become a Globetrotter
Salty Dog Saloon on West Univer-
sity Avenue offers one of the best bar 
experiences in Gainesville, and becoming a Globetrotter is something you shouldn’t miss. To become a Globetrotter you have to drink one beer from each country listed on the beer menu in 60 days — a total of 30 beers. Not only do you get a free T-shirt, but you also get to drink some good beer in a fun atmosphere.
8 Hare Krishna Lunch
It’s not just for vegetarians and hip-
pies. Everyone should try the Krishna 
lunch on the Plaza of the Americas. Not only 
is the food good, it’s cheap. Krishna Lunch has been served on campus since 1971 and draws hundreds of students each day.
7Gator Stompin’
This graduation tradition is a must-
do for graduating seniors. For $25 
you spend the night of April 30 cruising res-
taurants and barhopping to 32 different lo-cations, including Gator City, Fat Tuesday, Dragonfly and Mellow Mushroom. At each bar you get one alcoholic or nonalcoholic drink, and at each restaurant you get a food item. And there’s a free T-shirt. 
6Running of the Bulls
Each Fall, the women of the Panhel-
lenic Council hand out bids for their so-
rorities to excited hopefuls on Norman Field. And each year, hundreds of people show up to watch. Why the big turnout? It’s pure entertainment. Nowhere else in Gainesville will you hear more screaming, witness more excitement and see more tears all in one place. Whether or not you’re a part of the Greek community, sorority bid day, or “the running of the bulls” is something you can’t miss. Note: This event takes place in the Fall, so if you’re graduating, make it a reason to come back and visit next year.
5 Eat at The Swamp
If you didn’t dine at The Swamp with 
your parents during your freshman year, 
it’s something you should probably make hap-
pen before you leave town. It’s not so much about the food as it is about the environment. So stop by with mom and dad, enjoy a pitcher of beer and some food, and enjoy one of Gaines-ville’s most clichéd dining experiences.
4 Orange & Brew
The Orange & Brew may not be the 
No. 1 hot spot for drinking, but how 
can you pass it up? Other than sneaking a 
flask into a football game, this is really your only chance to drink on campus. And drinking here won’t get you into trouble. With a wide range of available beers and late hours (it’s open until 1 a.m. on Fridays), it’s one place on campus you shouldn’t pass up.
3 Celebrate at MarstonMarston Science Library — the library that isn’t. Before leaving, graduates should try to celebrate something (a birthday, good exam grade, graduation, etc.) in the enormous library where no one pays attention to the fact that, yes, this is a library. You aren’t supposed to answer your phone and talk with “outside” voices. People have already been seen celebrating birthdays there with friends and cupcakes, so you won’t be the first obnox-ious person to do it.
2 Ginnie Springs
Only 13 miles north of Gainesville, 
Ginnie Springs is one of the best swim-
ming and diving spots around. There are seven different springs in which to snorkel or dive. It’s also fairly cheap: $10 depending on what you want to do. There’s also a river to tube down with your friends. This spot will make any hot Gainesville day a lot nicer.
1Watch the Gators win a NCAA 
Championship
Soon-to-be graduates, you can 
check this off your list. Thanks to the UF foot-
ball and men’s basketball teams, we were all here for some of the greatest experiences of our college careers. The Gainesville Experience 
The end of the school year is upon us — the time for all the soon-to-be graduates to make the most of their last few weeks in Gainesville. 
To help, here is a list of the top 10 things to do before leaving town.10, ALLIGATOR � TUESDAY, APRIL 14, 2009
Being a senior at the University of Florida is hard 
to sum up in words. It’s the culmination of a lot of hard work and dedication. It’s the realization 
that I’m about to enter the real world and leave a lot of friends and memories behind. I remember when I first got here four years ago, it felt like graduation would never come, but now that it’s staring me right in the face, I have a real sense of accomplishment. I’ve been a gator all of my life; my goal has always been to come here and get my degree. To have achieved that goal is an amaz-ing feeling. I know though that with all great accomplish-ments, it wasn’t solely because of me. I will always be thankful for the people in my life that helped push me and influence me to this point in my life. Whether it was my girlfriend making sure I didn’t forget to sleep in on my early morning exam, or my cousin helping me with business finance when I was utterly confused. I’ve just been blessed with a great group of friends and loved ones. I know though that my parents will be the happiest of all though, because they won’t have any more bills to pay! Of course, I also can’t forget for a second all the wonderful memories I have from our football and basketball teams. When I got here freshman year, I was hoping to see just an SEC championship! The fact that I saw four national championships is ridiculous. My class has honestly been one of the luckiest classes of all time in that regards. Personally, I’m just glad I got to witness Georgia getting stomped by us in Jacksonville this year. I’ll never forget seeing that stadium half full with only gators left cheering on the team. All in all, it has been a great ride. My professors have done a great job prepar-ing me, and while I will always look back with a smile on the crazy nights in midtown or tailgating for a game, I’m ready to leave my mark on the world. One thing will always ring true for me however; it truly was great to be Florida Gator.

Before UF students planning on graduating 
in May send out those fancy graduation an-
nouncements, they should take a look at the university’s checklist to make sure they actually 
get their diplomas:
1Make sure you have met all of your de-
gree requirements with your academic adviser.
2 If you haven’t filled out a degree appli-cation form, you’re late. But you can still get a late application form on ISIS. 
3 Verify your local and home addresses so you’re sure to get your diploma. Your di-ploma will be mailed to your home mailing 
address about 10 weeks after graduation.
4 Clear your academic record. Incomplete grades must be converted to satisfactory letter grades before you can graduate.5 Satisfy all financial obligations (fines, tickets, fees, etc.) with University Financial Services in Criser Hall, Room 113. Outstanding debt 
will delay release of your diploma and transcript.
6 Complete an exit interview with the Of-fice for Student Financial Affairs if you have received financial aid, student 
loans or scholarships.
7 Visit the Career Resource Center for help writ-ing your resume and to consult other career-related materials. In other words, get a job. 
8 Order your regalia at the UF Bookstore. There will be a $10 late fee if you order between today and April 16, and a $15 late fee after that.
9 Consider joining the UF Alumni Association. For recent graduates, a membership costs $25 a year or $600 for a lifetime member-
ship. It gets more expensive down the road: $40 per year or $800 for a lifetime membership.Make sure you will graduate

UF right fielder Daniel Pigott waits for a pitch during the Gators’ 16-3 win against Central Florida on Wednesday night at McKethan Stadium.
� THE TEAMS HAVE SPLIT 
THEIR FIRST TWO GAMES.
By KYLE MAISTRI
Alligator Staff Writer
kmaistri@alligator.org
The Gators are hoping to avoid 
a case of déjà vu in Tallahassee to-
night.
Just like last season, UF (23-12) 
is heading into the final leg of its three-game series with FSU (21-11) having split the first two contests. 
The two meetings this season re-
sulted in a 5-4 win in Gainesville and a 3-2 defeat in Jacksonville for UF.
When the Gators traveled to Tal-
lahassee last season for the third game of the series, they fell 4-2.
Over the weekend, the Gators 
notched their first road SEC se-
ries victory in Auburn, Ala., and 
UF coach Kevin O’Sullivan hopes the momentum will carry his team into the final regular-season meet-ing with the Seminoles without too 
much buildup from the coaching 
staff.
“I hope that I don’t have to say a whole lot. I hope that they get fired up and ready to go,” O’Sullivan said. 
If momentum isn’t enough 
to carry the Gators to a victory, 
O’Sullivan feels confident that his 
well-rested pitching staff will give UF an advantage. 
In the final two games against 
the Tigers, the Gators used a com-bined four pitchers thanks in part to an eight-inning outing by starter 
Stephen Locke on Saturday and a 6 
1/3-inning perfor-
mance by freshman starter Anthony DeSclafani on Sun-
day. 
“We certainly got the num-
bers. We just need to execute,” 
O’Sullivan said.  
Freshman Greg Larson, who 
has yet to start a game in his short college career, finished out Locke’s effort on Saturday and is one of the options to start tonight at 6 p.m. in 
Dick Howser Stadium.
Senior Patrick Keating, who lost 
his spot in the weekend rotation, Gators to play Seminoles in last of three-game series
Summers have usually been 
a rough time for me as far as 
sports go.
There’s no football, except for the 
NFL Draft, which doesn’t get me all 
hot and bothered like it does for oth-
er people. College basketball is done, 
and the NBA doesn’t really hold my 
attention. And I only follow MLB 
when the Atlanta Braves are doing 
well down the stretch (so I haven’t 
watched in a while).
Tennis and golf provide distrac-
tions for a week or so at a time, and 
then I spend the next week trying to 
be Roger Federer or Tiger Woods. 
Still, I could never find anything 
strong enough to make up for the loss of football.
Until last summer, when I did the 
previously unthinkable.
I got into soccer.
Euro 2008 captivated me. I’ll nev-
er forget Turkey’s improbable run to the semifi-
nals, capped 
by a thrilling 
shootout vic-
tory against 
Croatia, where 
the only goals 
were scored in 
the 119th and 
122nd minutes 
in extra time.
Next, I dove 
into the English Premier League and 
got hooked on Arsenal, but I wanted 
to follow a club that I had a realistic 
chance of watching in person.
So I went ten steps past my sacri-
legious decision to follow soccer and chose to give the MLS a chance.
The season started three weeks 
ago and runs through the summer to the MLS Cup on Nov. 22. It cov-MLS great for summer lull

With all the injuries to his team, UF coach 
Urban Meyer joked that he doesn’t know 
how the Gators will even play their spring 
game Saturday.
The Gators’ injury list has seemingly 
grown by the day, and two more starters 
were added to that list Monday. 
Freshman cornerback Janoris Jenkins will 
have finger surgery and is expected to be out for three weeks. Meyer said the injury was “real minor.” 
The news for sophomore offensive line-
man Maurkice Pouncey is less fortunate. Pouncey had successful shoulder surgery Monday and is expected to be out for three months. While he’ll be ready for the start of the fall season, he will miss a majority of the 
summer training program.
UF is already without defensive linemen, 
Justin Trattou (shoulder strain) and Carlos 
Dunlap (abdominal injury), tight end Des-mond Parks (sprained knee) and receiver David Nelson (sprained right foot).
A slew of other players have also nursed 
injuries throughout the spring. 
MEYER DEFENDS HARVIN: Meyer said he has 
received phone calls from NFL personnel asking about former receiver Percy Harvin, who is no longer a lock to be a first-round 
pick in the NFL Draft on April 25. 
Several reports have surfaced question-
ing Harvin’s work ethic and coachability, 
and NFLDraftBible.com reported Harvin 
tested positive for marijuana at the NFL 
Scouting Combine, though that report has not been confirmed elsewhere.
While Meyer did not comment on Har-
vin’s coachability, he quickly elaborated on UF FOOTBALLTwo more starters injuredBaseball

ers my summer dead period, and 
with most games on Saturdays, it 
fills the void of week-to-week ex-
citement that football left behind.
Most importantly, it doesn’t 
suck. If you enjoy watching soccer, 
MLS has enough talent and parity 
to hold your attention. The first 
step is picking a team to follow.
The Eastern Conference has 
been much tougher than the West 
in recent years — think SEC vs. Big 
East — but the wild card slots are 
awarded without regard to confer-ence, so teams aren’t punished for 
playing in a tough division. By this 
rule, New York won the West last 
year.
Compiled with my severely 
limited MLS knowledge and gut 
feeling, here are a few teams to 
start following this year, including 
their current records.
ChiC ago Fire (2-2-0):  Founded 
on the anniversary of the Great Chicago Fire (fun fact), the Fire has a solid developmental system and boasts former U.S. National Team forward Brian McBride. It’s early, but Chicago figures to be one of the top teams in the East. Still, I wouldn’t pick the Fire un-less you’re predisposed to Chicago teams.La gaLaxy (0-2-1):  If you like the 
Lakers, Yankees, Cowboys or any other franchise that picks up band-
wagon fans by name and logo 
alone, these guys are for you. They 
get David Beckham back in June 
and also feature U.S. star Landon Donovan, so sell your soul and jump on board! Just don’t expect a playoff run. If you’re more of a Clippers-type person, check out cross-town rival Chivas U.S.A.SeattLe SounderS (3-0-1):  Simply 
put, the Sounders are awesome. Drew Carey is a part owner. Fans can vote to fire the general man-ager. They have a marching band. They’ve sold out season tickets, impressing the league enough to award Seattle the MLS Cup in its first season. Nearly 30,000 fans show up for each match, more than nine teams the English Premier League draw. They have former Arsenal great Freddie Ljungberg, rising star striker Fredy Montero and Nathan Sturgis, the brother of UF kicker Caleb Sturgis.
I’m sold. Alligator writer Mike 
DiFerdinando and I are flying out 
for their May 30 match against Co-
lumbus.
Maybe being a MLS fan will 
turn out to be a miserable existence, but the time I’ve spent learning the 
intricacies of the league and its dif-
ferent clubs has been very enter-
taining thus far. If nothing else, 
it’ll give me something different to follow this summer.MIKE , from page 19
and freshman Justin Poovey, 
who has made two starts this season, are the other two op-
tions. 
Last season, O’Sullivan 
used six different pitchers to 
complete the third game, and 
he has shown a quick hook 
when his starters begin to struggle this season. 
Having many options in 
relief will only help in that 
respect.
Larson and Poovey are 
just two of the many fresh-
men who have been produc-ing for the Gators lately. 
Preston Tucker was 
named SEC Freshman of the Week for the second time this season after his Ruthian performance against Central 
Florida on 
Wednesday night, and right fielder Daniel Pig-
ott has pro-
vided a ver-satile option in the No. 2 
spot in the lineup.
Pigott, who laid down the 
suicide squeeze with two outs to cap UF’s ninth-inning comeback against Alabama on March 28, hit his second 
home run of the season Sun-
day. 
“He can run. He’s got 
power,” O’Sullivan said of Pigott. “We always thought 
he’d be an exciting offensive 
player for us.”
Avoiding the same fate as 
last season may come down 
to the contributions of the 
freshmen who weren’t on the roster a year ago.
O’Sullivan said growing 
pains are to be expected with 
a young squad, but he feels 
his team is starting to hit its stride.UF gets boost from multiple freshmen
all the former offensive star did while at UF.
“We won two national championships 
around him — some of the greatest years in the 
history of Florida football,” Meyer said. “I was 
on the sideline with a guy that I know exactly the competitive nature of what we’re dealing with. Percy’s an extreme competitor. … I think 
he’ll be a great NFL football player.”
FuLLBa CKS get ‘FunCtionaL’:  To say Meyer 
was disappointed with his fullbacks when 
spring practice started would be an understate-ment. Steven Wilks, Rick Burgess and T.J. Pri-demore did not please the coaching staff when the spring sessions began.
Now, the unit is making Meyer feel much 
more comfortable.
“I made the comment that the fullback po-
sition was bordering on embar-
rassing,” Meyer said. “It’s very 
functional right now.”
Meyer has been especially 
appreciative of walk-on Christo-pher Scott, who has played run-
ning back and fullback. Meyer said Scott could play at either position.
“I have no idea (where he came from),” 
Meyer said. 
“He showed up one day on the practice 
field.”Fullbacks show improvement during springBASE , from page 19
