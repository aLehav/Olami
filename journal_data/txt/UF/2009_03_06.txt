� FRIENDS FOR LIFE OF AMERICA SPONSORED 
THE EVENT.

The Friends for Life of America held their fifth annual 
Chomp Cancer Spring Carnival Thursday afternoon on the 
Reitz Union North Lawn in order to spread cancer awareness among UF students.
The free food and games drew students in, but the cause 
made them stay. Fact sheets hung from the tents with vari-
ous statistics on cancer. There was also a memorial board for 
students to sign in memory of those lost to cancer or in honor of those fighting cancer. The club, which holds fundraisers throughout the year, works with cancer patients.
Alicia Garcia, a UF accounting junior and active member, 
described it as a place where students can get together and talk about how cancer has affected them.
Madison Beerbohm, a UF journalism junior, came to the 
carnival to have her hair cut for Locks of Love.
“My uncle and my grandfather both died of cancer, so it’s a 
way for me to give back,” Beerbohm said.
Brittany Shaara, a hairdresser at the Reitz Union Hair Com-
pany, volunteered to run the Locks of Love booth.
“I am here just to raise cancer awareness and for the the 
cause itself,” Shaara said. “Any little bit helps when you are going through such an extreme process.”Carnival honors

Spring break for college students is al-
ways eagerly awaited, but in tough eco-
nomic times when not everyone can jet off to Colorado for a week in the snow, 
students are finding other options for this 
year’s break.
Some students are staying local, like UF sophomore telecommunications ma-jor Andrew Suarez, who plans to spend Spring Break in his hometown, Tampa, re-laxing and taking advantage of the nearby 
beaches.
“Not only living in Florida, but living 
in the Tampa area is amazing,” he said.
Luckily for Suarez, he doesn’t have to 
go far for a good time. 
In addition to the beach, this year’s Southeastern Conference men’s basketball 
tournament will be held in Tampa, and Su-
arez said his tax refund money will cover his tickets.
“That way, I can treat my-
self and not feel guilty because 
it’s money that’s coming back,” he said.
Other spring break options available to 
students are service trips, where travelers sacrifice their downtime to help others.UF organization Florida Alternative 
Breaks matches students with service trips based on what social issues interest them.
Andrew Perrone, staff adviser for the 
organization, said that more than 200 stu-dents are going on 15 spring break trips.

UF students and faculty said, “Arrive-
derci” to Capeesh Italian Restaurant at the 
Reitz Union and will say, “Hola” to the 
Pollo Tropical restaurant.
Pollo Tropical, a Latin-Caribbean res-
taurant that first opened in Miami, will re-place Capeesh Italian Restaurant on June 
30. Capeesh closed Thursday afternoon.
Pollo Tropical offers marinated chicken, 
pork and ribs with sides like rice, beans, 
yuca and corn.
“Students have expressed an interest 
in bringing Pollo Tropical to campus since late 2007,” said Jill Rodriguez, the market-ing manager for Gator Dining Services.Claudia Murray, a UF law student, 
played a lead role in bringing Pollo Tropi-cal to the Reitz Union.“I can eat at Fritanga [Latin Grill], but 
it’s not the same,” Murray said. “When we ordered food out, we didn’t get pizza, we didn’t get Taco Bell, we got Pollo Tropical — that’s my comfort food.”

Gandhi items auctioned for $1.8M
NEW YORK (AP) — Mohandas Gandhi’s eyeglasses and 
other items sold for $1.8 million Thursday at an auction that 
drew outrage from the Indian government, a last-minute re-versal from the seller and a frenzy of bidding won by an Indian conglomerate that said the pacifist leader’s possessions will be coming home.
The lot included Gandhi’s wire-rim eyeglasses, worn leath-
er sandals, a pocket watch, a plate and the brass bowl from which he ate his final meal. The Indian government protested the sale, saying the items should be returned to the nation and not sold to the highest bidder.

The judge questioned Shep-
pard over the school’s objection to 
the name.
“A Gay-Straight Alliance, that 
covers everybody doesn’t it?” Ad-ams asked.
After the hearing, Page said the 
group doesn’t want to change its name because it represents what the club is about.
“This school is ashamed of us-
ing the word ‘gay’ In this environ-ment,” she said.
School officials had no problem 
with the idea of tolerance and re-jecting bullying, Sheppard said, but they believe the club will be disruptive.
Rosenwald noted that the Fel-
lowship of Christian Athletes meets on campus. He told the judge that an FCA booklet in-
cludes references to sexual issues, 
including a student pledge to re-main sexually pure and an article about dealing with homosexuality in the locker room.
Sheppard said he was unaware 
of the document and Adams said he could have three days to re-spond to it.
Rosenwald asked for the in-
junction, noting that Brock, a ju-nior, and Page, a freshman, might be out of school before the case is decided.
“These students are in a short 
window on this,” he said.
The ACLU recently won a sim-
ilar case in Okeechobee. A judge 
there ruled schools must provide 
for the well-being of gay students and cannot discriminate against a Gay-Straight Alliance.
Rosenwald said the Okeecho-
bee County School Board paid $326,000 in attorneys fees in the case.

2 Fla. students challenge 
school’s gay club ruling
JACKSONVILLE, Fla. (AP) — 
An attorney for two gay students 
at a north Florida high school told a federal judge Thursday they should be allowed to form 
a campus club promoting tol-
erance toward gays, despite a school prohibition.
But a lawyer for the Nassau 
County School Board said the group’s name, Gay-Straight Alli-ance, is against school policy.
Yulee High School students 
Hannah Page and Jacob Brock, 
represented by the American 
Civil Liberties Union, are suing the school board to overturn its decision banning them from forming the club. Yulee is about 25 miles north of Jacksonville, near the Georgia state line.
U.S. District Judge Henry Ad-
ams Jr. said he would issue a rul-
ing on a motion for a preliminary 
injunction “as soon as I can,” but gave Nassau County three days to submit additional written ar-guments. The students want an injunction to allow them to meet until the case goes to trial.
ACLU Attorney Robert F. 
Rosenwald Jr. argued that Page 
and Brock had been the target 
of anti-gay epithets and threats of violence at school and wanted to start the Gay-Straight Alliance to open a discourse among stu-dents.
Attorney Frank Sheppard, 
who represents the school board, said the district’s main complaint 
is the name of the group, saying 
it does not approve of groups dealing with sexual orientation and noted the school has an abstinence-based sex education curriculum.
“If they change the name and 
comply with Nassau County School Board policies they can STATE
Publicist: Robin Williams 
needs heart surgery 
MIAMI (AP) — Robin Williams 
needs heart surgery and must can-
cel the remainder of his one-man comedy show, “Weapons of Self-Destruction,” his publicist said 
Thursday.
The 57-year-old actor needs an 
aortic valve replacement, accord-
ing to a news release issued by his publicist Mara Buxbaum. Wil-liams’ representatives would not give any more information on Wil-liams’ condition.
“I’m so touched by everyone’s 
support and well wishes,” Wil-liams said in the statement. “This tour has been amazing fun and I can’t wait to get back out on the road after a little tune-up.”
Williams was already in Florida 
when he canceled four shows in the state earlier this week after ex-periencing shortness of breath.
Since September, Williams had 
been on the sold-out, 80-city tour, which is expected to resume in the fall, his publicist said. Tickets will be honored once the new dates are scheduled, or people can con-tact their place of purchase for re-funds.
The Academy Award-winning 
actor got his start as a standup comedian in the 1970s. He has ap-peared in dozens of feature films — both comedies and dramas — over nearly three decades.
Williams won an Oscar for Best 
Supporting Actor for his role in the 1997 film “Good Will Hunting.” 
Fla. man gets 30 years in 
murder-for-hire plot 
TAMPA, Fla. (AP) — The own-
er of a central Florida construction 
company is going to prison for 30 years for trying to hire a hit man to kill an IRS agent.
Federal prosecutors say Randy 
Nowak agreed to pay an under-cover FBI agent $20,000 to kill agent Christine Brandt. Brandt was auditing Nowak’s business in Polk County, east of Tampa.
The 50-year-old Nowak was 
sentenced Thursday in federal court. A jury found him guilty in 
December.
Prosecutors say Nowak was 
afraid the government would find 
more than $3 million he stashed in offshore bank accounts. He was ar-rested in July after going to meet

The success of UF’s sports teams 
has led some students and faculty 
members to wonder why the Uni-versity Athletic Association can’t step in and rescue UF’s academic 
programs from big budget cuts next year.
But the UAA, which has donated 
about $48 million to UF since 1990, 
has, in fact, considered making a larger than average contribution to UF this year, UF spokesman Steve 
Orlando said.
“There have been discussions 
about that, but I don’t think they’ve 
reached any final decision on it,” Or-lando said.
Steve McClain, a UAA spokes-
man, said the association usually won’t know how much it will do-nate until the end of the fiscal year, when revenues are tallied.
“Some of it is contingent on li-
censing and royalty fees, so I can’t give you a number right now,” Mc-Clain said.Orlando argued that the UAA 
has been  the subject of some unfair criticism.
“You hear people say, ‘Gee it 
sounds like the athletic association is so successful. They really should 
contribute more to the university,’” 
Orlando said.
The UAA contributes a lot, he 
added.“They’ve been very generous 
with their help,” he said. “More than they get credit for, I think.”
He also said the UAA’s $83 mil-
lion budget is smaller than some people might imagine.
 “People think they’re rolling in 
money,” he said. “The fact of the matter is, they run a very lean op-eration.” SPECIAL REPORT

Students hoping to score tickets in UF’s 
football lottery will need to enter more than just a credit card number this year. 
To be eligible for football tickets, students 
must take the Student Experience in the Re-
search University survey, or SERU, which will 
ask students about their academic experience, social activities and further career goals. 
The survey, which can be taken online 
through ISIS, will begin March 16 and will take about 25 minutes to complete, wrote Ma-rie Zeglen,  assistant provost and director of Institutional Planning and Research, in an e-mail.  
Students can complete SERU in one sitting 
or break it up into sessions.
According to Zeglen, there will also be 
questions about civic engagements, student 
development and student services.
“The survey will help UF leaders and ad-
ministrators learn more about the undergrad-
uate student experience on campus,” Zeglen wrote. “Actions can be taken in areas where students express less satisfaction.”
Unlike other types of surveys, SERU will get feedback from the majority of the UF pop-ulation instead of just a sample, because all un-dergrads will be required to take the survey.
Graduate students and incoming freshmen 
are exempt.
“Academic departments will 
get extensive feedback from their 
student majors,” Zeglen wrote. 
“Many of these colleges and departments have 
not had this type of detailed feedback.”
A similar survey was created by the Uni-
versity of California at Berkeley Center for Studies in Higher Education in 2003 and was used by eight Californian universities, Zeglen wrote.  
In 2008, the University of California invited 
other colleges to administer the survey.
UF, along with five other schools including 
the University of Michigan and Rutgers Uni-versity, took them up on the offer.
“Best practices can be shared among all the 
universities administering the survey,” Zeglen wrote.
Zeglen wrote that students taking the sur-
vey should know there are more benefits than just being eligible for football tickets. 
“SERU is not just a survey,” she wrote. “It’s 
your vote.”Students must take survey to qualify for football tix

The Harn Museum of Art will be hosting 
an international loan exhibition featuring the 
kimono, Japan’s national costume.
“Fashioning Kimono: Art Deco and Mod-
ernism in Japan” will run free of charge to the public starting Sunday through May 17.The exhibit features 97 kimono from the 
1890s to the 1940s and 49 photographs.
The kimono, which are on loan from the 
Montgomery Collection of Lugano, Switzer-land, are free-standing throughout the room categorized by season, gender and style, said Jason Steuber, Cofrin curator of Asian Art at the museum.
Steuber said he designed the exhibit to re-semble how the kimono are worn, instead of  
just hanging them on a wall.
Because the kimono 
was the attire of choice for 
men, women and children in Japan from the late 1800s 
to the mid-1900s, the kimono range from caus-al everyday wear to formal wedding wear.  
Some garments mimic traditional Japanese history and famous Japanese literature, while 
there are some with a modern feel, he said.
One kimono in the exhibit, made for a 
young boy, is decorated with army images of 
guns and planes reflecting the World Wars. 
“The shape of the kimono never changes,” 
Steuber said. “But the design and textural de-tail absorb what is happening in contempo-rary society.”International exhibition to feature 97 Japanese kimono� ONE STUDENT MOVED TO

For many students in Gainesville, 
hearing the news of a bomb explod-
ing inside a Jewish Community Center in Caracas, Venezuela, on Feb. 26 hit too close to home. 
This marked the second anti-Se-
mitic, or anti-Jewish, attack in Cara-cas within a month.
The first attack, vandalization of 
a major synagogue in late January, pushed 19-year-old Samuel Cohen to move to Gainesville two weeks ago. 
“As soon as that happened, my 
mom told me I had to get the hell out of Venezuela,” he said. “That’s why I started really looking to come to a university here.”
Cohen enrolled at Santa Fe Col-
lege and started classes on Monday.
Eduardo Fleischer, a UF indus-
trial and systems engineering junior, moved to the U.S.  from Venezuela in 2006. He said the recent attacks go against the country’s history of tolerance.
“I think it’s a shame because 
Venezuela is a country that has al-ways accepted all people and immi-grants,” he said. 
Fleischer said many speculate 
the government was involved in the attack on the synagogue, and he thinks the attacks are linked to President Hugo Chavez’s anti-Israel sentiments. 
“We don’t say he does the at-
tacks, but it’s his motivational speeches that produce the attacks,” he said. 
Jossie Buzaglu, a UF industrial 
engineering senior who moved from 
Venezuela in 2007,  said it is impor-
tant to understand this was not the first time anti-Semitism had been felt in Venezuela. But he said the situation is worse now than ever. 
“Anti-Semitism always arises 
when there are conflicts in Israel,” he said. “Chavez takes the Pales-tinian side, and he has such good speeches that he convinces every-one the Israelis are wrong.” 
Rabbi Berl Goldman, of the 
Lubavitch-Chabad Jewish Student and Community Center, described 
the situation as not only a Venezu-
elan concern, but a Jewish one as well.
“Thankfully, Chavez has come 
out and said publicly, at least, that he condemns the attacks, and that he will help the situation,” Gold-man said. “Whether or not he does that will be a true testament to his 
role as a political leader.” 
Esther Benchimol, a UF student 
and president of the Venezuelan 
Student Association, said since the conflict in Gaza and the violence in Caracas began, she has worried dai-ly about her family members who still live in Venezuela. “My mom is already nervous be-
cause of the general dangers in Ven-ezuela, and now we have to worry about being Jewish?” Benchimol said.
She found out about the syna-
gogue attack from her mom, who was crying hysterically after hear-ing the news. Benchimol said her family used to attend weekly ser-vices there. 
Benchimol said she wants to help 
the situation by increasing aware-ness about what is happening in Venezuela. 
Goldman said throughout their 
history, Jews have never been able to be unaware of anti-Semitic threats, even in countries like Venezuela.
“Good people everywhere need 
to be aware of what is happening and need to condemn these sense-less acts of violence,” he said.

87 TOTAL VOTES30% YES70% NOThursday’s question: Do you have faith in the two-party sys -
tem?Today’s statement: Have a great Spring Break!
It is no secret to anyone (except maybe Florida State 
economics students) that the economy is in its worst state in years. 
Economists expect the economy to have shed over 
750,000 jobs over the course of February – 400,000 more than in January. 
America’s Insurance Giant, the lifeblood of the Ameri-
can insurance and financial industry, is burning through cash faster than Gator basketball is throwing away its sea-son, losing more than $62 billion of taxpayer money in less than three months. And it’s not just the United States that is experiencing an economic boom. Europe’s unem-
ployment levels are rising to historic highs, and Chinese 
growth has slowed almost 4 percent in the past year and a half. 
Although the problem is easily identified and diverse 
in its causes, the government is taking a one-size-fits-all approach to shoring up our ailing economy – spend, spend, spend and don’t forget more spending. 
Let me premise this by saying that I am a staunch 
Democrat and a believer in the recent economic stimulus 
package, the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act, 
despite the fact that money provisions simply are not go-ing to “stimulate” the economy. But there comes a point at which spending more will fail to fix our economy, and 
we are rapidly approaching that point.
Many easily forget that this is not Congress’ first at-
tempt to shore up the economy via a stimulus bill. Right 
before leaving office, former President George W. Bush pushed through Congress another stimulus package that 
gave American families hundreds of dollars in disposable 
cash, thinking that they would spend it and put it back into the economy. Not only did this bill fail to restore con-sumer confidence, it did nothing to help us as most Americans simply put the money into savings. 
It is time that both President Ba-
rack Obama and Congress took a history lesson – you cannot spend your way to prosperity. 
In the ‘60s,’70s and ‘80s, when 
the economy was booming, presi-dents from Kennedy all the way 
through Nixon and Carter were concerned with expand-ing an already-booming economy. Along with the Fed-
eral Reserve System, they supported fiscal and monetary 
policies that increased the money supply and lowered the interest rates, like the Fed and Congress are doing now. The result? 
Politicians and economists learned very quickly that 
it’s nearly impossible to control the natural boom and bust cycles of the economy, as runaway inflation ram-paged America. It took a federal-induced recession, led by Paul Volcker to whip inflation and bring prices back 
into check. Unfortunately, the laws of economics don’t 
simply change overnight. 
Runaway spending and near-zero interest rates still 
induce hyperinflation, and spending has a limited effect 
on stimulating the economy. Maybe the best solution is 
the easiest, yet the most difficult — let the economy be. Programs like the Troubled Assets Relief Program are a good idea if the proper oversight is in place. 
But increasing spending across the board is a danger-
ous, short-sighted policy that will only leave Americans hurting more later than they are now.

Crashing a car can be an extremely stressful ordeal, but 
when houses are involved, you’ve just opened up a whole new can of worms. The Department of Darts & Laurels launches a why-are-you-driving-around-with-seven-large-pieces-of-crack DART at Eric Wade for causing $5,000 worth

With budget cuts on the horizon at UF, one group of stu-
dents staring down the elimination of their program is taking a stand. For holding a vigil protesting the proposed cut of the undergraduate education program at UF, the Department of Darts & Laurels extends a way-to-stand-up-for-your-field-
of-study LAUREL to students from UF’s College of Educa-
tion. While budget cuts are not going away anytime soon, 
there are better ways to remedy the situation than by cutting

crazy things, one woman from Fort Pierce, Fla., set a new standard for ridiculousness. The Department of Darts & Lau-rels tosses a why-the-hell-didn’t-you-just-go-to-Checkers? DART at Latreasa Goodman for calling 911 three times after 
learning McDonald’s ran out of her beloved chicken nuggets. When hunger pains hit us, you better get out of our way, but we certainly aren’t going to call GPD if Gyros Plus just so happened to run out of hummus (oh no).
News from the world of sports often informs us of the lat-
est slugger suspected of steroid use or a player arrested for off-the-field troubles – unless you’re the Orlando Magic. For building a new playground for the youth of Orlando to en-joy, the Department of Darts & Laurels presents the Orlando 
Magic basketball team a you-guys-are-studs-on-and-off-the-court LAUREL. While the players taking one day out of 
their schedules to lend a helping hand isn’t too much to ask, we’re sure more than one child walked away from meeting Dwight Howard grinning ear to ear.
Working as a mascot is nothing short of back-breaking 
work — especially when dealing with unruly customers. The Department of Darts & Laurels chucks a take-it-easy-on-the-Red-Bull-big-guy DART at Trahan Pires for ripping off the 
head of the Chuck E. Cheese mascot after thinking the giant rat had pinned his son against a video game console. For his absurd reaction, Pires was fined $500 — more than enough to have covered a new Xbox360 and ROCKSTAR for his son who was at the restaurant celebrating his birthday.
Maybe it’s just us, but we can never understand the mys-
tery voice behind the intercom at drive-through restaurants. For manipulating the frequency at a Taco Bell squawk box and greeting customers with vulgar messages, the Depart-
ment of Darts & Laurels laughs as we give two Missouri 
teens a mad-props-for-pranking-unsuspecting-fast-food-
fans-as-they-attempt-to-get-their-grub-on LAUREL. We can 
only imagine the look on the faces of Taco Bell employees as two kids sat in the parking lot transmitting unsavory one-liners over the intercom.

On Wednesday morning, the entire 
editorial staff of the Daily Emerald — the student-produced newspaper at 
the University of Oregon — went on strike in protest of the attempts of its board of direc-
tors to install a publisher with unprecedented 
control over the newsroom.
Today, college newspapers across the 
country stand in solidarity with the editorial staff of the Daily Emerald in support of the independent collegiate press and student-controlled editorial content. We are deeply dismayed by the short-sighted actions of the Emerald’s board of directors and strongly 
support the strike until the staff’s demands 
are met, and independent student journalism can be safeguarded from such attacks at the Emerald and on college campuses nation-wide.
On Thursday the board of directors had 
the audacity to publish their own version of the Oregon Daily Emerald using content from The Associated Press and a front-page 
statement from the board. This move is as of-
fensive as it is unwise.
In November, the board of directors hired 
Emerald alumnus Steven A. Smith as a con-sultant, and he drafted a plan which included a call to hire a publisher. Smith then authored the publisher’s job description as well as his own terms of employment for the position, which the board approved without negotia-
tion.
 On Feb. 24, the board voted to hire Smith 
as the Emerald’s publisher, and to give him 
unprecedented control over the full paper’s operation, including supervising the editor in chief. Smith could also have been concur-rently employed by the university, creating a clear path for the university to control what should be student edi-torial content.
In the face of the 
strike, Smith has de-
cided to withdraw his decision to accept the 
position. Today the Emerald staff demands 
a nationwide search for a new publisher, whose authority would not extend over the editor and who would not be employed by the university.
The Emerald, like many papers across the 
country, is in dire financial straits and faces the possibility of closure. This financial reali-ty, however, should not force the staff to com-
promise their guiding ethics as journalists or 
to sacrifice the paper’s autonomy. The deci-sion seems to be a callous overreaching by the board and the university, and an attempt to take advantage of a financially struggling, but influential student organization.
We are living in a tough time for the 
newspaper business. Now more than ever, we must stand strong and stand together to 
maintain our editorial independence — any 
measure of overarching interference in con-tent undermines our journalistic standards and is unacceptable, no matter the financial situation. 
Practicing journalism under the possibil-
ity of censorship and the meddling influence of an administration undermines the purpose of a free press — we hope that the Emerald’s 
board will recognize this undeniable fact and 
immediately meet the staff’s demands. Until then, we stand with the Oregon Daily Emer-ald.

Columnist stands by satire
For those of you who don’t know me, or for 
those of you who I have offended, I apologize 
if you took the meaning of my column to be anything but satire. As an effective satire only mirrors reality, I stand by what I have written 
for a few reasons.
First, as you’ll notice, I picked on both sides, 
stereotyping both into wild exaggerations, which included picking on the “good” side of 
the room. Second, everything from the Little Rascals to the Boston Tea Party was a joke. 
So for that, Kelly Korman, I wouldn’t 
change the gorilla line for accuracy. If I wrote “a flannel shirt-wearing tomboy” instead of “girl” as I did in a later draft, Emily Congdon would be hurling eggs at my window. 
As for my distinguished rivals, they dis-tinguish themselves only by the amount of mud they sling back. Korman and Congdon churned offhand remarks into cannon fodder and ought to keep their hands from such vil-lainous slander. Rock beats scissors, and jour-nalism beats the English department.
For me, you see, it’s the little things in life 
that are the great injustices. Like having to put up with bad music. If you devote your time to trying to solve the most miniscule of is-sues, the most mundane debates, such as this one, you will be left empty-handed.  There’s a quote that goes: “Analyzing a joke is like dis-secting a frog. Few people are interested, and the frog dies of it.”
The defense rests. I’m going to the gym.

And ignorance claims another vic-
tim — Matthew Meltzer.
In his bashing of Gainesville 
Fashion Week, Meltzer failed to recog-nize the point of the event. He claimed 
that festivals have to do with the city 
they’re located in, and that Gainesville isn’t synonymous with “fashion.”
All right then, let’s test his logic. If 
this isn’t Gainesville, Germany, why do we have a beer festival? If it isn’t the 16th century, and we don’t live in Eastern Eu-rope, why have a Hoggetowne Renais-sance Faire? Sounds to me like Meltzer 
wants to get rid of all the fun.
The purpose of Gainesville Fashion 
Week is not the same as “America’s Next 
Top Model” or “Project Runway.” Mod-els aren’t walking the catwalk to get no-ticed by Vogue, and designers aren’t au-ditioning for Heidi Klum. The purpose of GFW is to provide an outlet for artists to showcase their work.
Besides that, GFW presents an oppor-
tunity for members of the community to come together and celebrate, just as an art show would. Make-up artists paint on dramatic faces; stylists sculpt outrageous hairdos. Professional models and local faces alike strut down the runway. Lo-cal painters and photographers gather to display their artwork around GFW ven-
ues and cheer each other’s hard work. 
While all of this is going on, both stu-
dent and professional photographers are shooting photos. 
Why, you ask? Certainly not for compensation or 
recognition, but just for one common 
goal — the right to express themselves.
The point is that these people who 
are contributing to Gainesville Fashion 
Week are doing something great for the community without any ulterior mo-tives. After all, art and the freedom of expression bring people together and unite the community. GFW is promoting harmony between the people and busi-
nesses involved, and it helps local artists 
gain feedback and experience. 
By stereotyping GFW as “a seven-day 
collection of No. 15 jerseys and Urban Meyer gameday polos,” you are not only cheapening a wonderfully done event, but contributing to the small-minded-ness this town needs to get away from.
Seriously, what ever happened to the 
idea that college towns are supposed to represent the truest marketplace of ideas? After all, Gainesville isn’t just a small town; it’s a collection of people from all walks of life. I challenge you, Matthew Meltzer, and those who think like you, to step outside of your bubble and realize that just because we live in a small town, it doesn’t mean we have to act like we’re 
going to be stuck here forever.

The family of the man who 
was found dead in a car near UF’s 
campus is taking a stand.
Kristina Torres, the daughter 
of John F. Waldo, and Monica 
Kraft, Waldo’s fiancé, addressed city commissioners at Thursday’s 
meeting.
“We can’t bring him back, but 
we can sit here and try to pass a 
law,” Kraft said.
This law, proposed to com-
missioners as a petition, requests that city, county and state police agencies collaborate more with one another.  It also asks that police run the 
vehicle identification number and tag any car that is ticketed.
As Waldo lay dead for 12 days, 
the car he was in was ticketed 
seven times. 
Waldo was reported missing 
Feb. 11. His body was found Feb. 
23.
Waldo’s family said they hope 
that by requiring further mea-sures when ticketing vehicles, situations like the one they expe-rienced could be avoided.
“We would like to see it go 
into effect as soon as possible so no other families suffer,” Kraft said.
The commission referred the matter to the Public Safety Com-mittee. 
The committee will bring back 
a recommendation after review-ing the family’s requests.
After the conclusion of public 
comment, the commission pro-ceeded with other business.
This included an ordinance that allows tow companies to 
boot vehicles parked on private 
property.
The ordinance passed unani-
mously on its first reading with 
Commissioner Jeanna Mastrodi-
casa and Mayor Pegeen Hanra-han absent. 
Similar to the city’s roam 
towing law, the ordinance pro-
vides guidelines for booting in 
Gainesville. The fee to remove the boot is set at $60.
There is currently no city or-
dinance governing booting. To become law, the ordinance must be approved a second time at the March 19 meeting.
If passed at that meeting, the ordinance will be effective im-
mediately. Some commissioners 
expressed concern that booting guidelines would only create more headaches, similar to issues 
surrounding roam towing.
“Roam towing has been a real 
can of worms,” said Commis-
sioner Craig Lowe. “I’m wonder-ing if we’re, without realizing it, 
opening up another can.”
Other commissioners said the 
important thing was that prop-
erty owners be given the right to 
boot vehicles, regardless of their 
opinions of it.
“It’s good public policy to 
have the option,” Commissioner Thomas Hawkins said.

MONTERREY, Mexico — The world’s 
heaviest man still can’t walk, but he will soon be able to roll.
Manuel Uribe said Thursday he is hav-
ing a 1989 Chevrolet Astrovan outfitted to support his record-breaking weight, giv-ing him mobility after more than six years 
of being confined to his bed.Uribe earned the Guinness World Re-
cord as the world’s heaviest man in 2006, when he tipped the scales at 1,230 pounds 
(560 kilograms.) He claims to have since shed more than 500 pounds after making a public call for help. Uribe, known as 
Meme to his friends, even has a name for 
his new ride.
“My friends call it the Meme-Mobile, 
just like the Batmobile,” he said.The minivan is being 
converted into an open-
air, flatbed pickup of 
sorts. Manuel says he will put a bed on the back of the van to drive around 
town, with his new wife at the wheel.
When at home, he will 
hang out in a remodeled garage that will include a forklift to help raise his regular bed up to the level of his car bed, allowing 
him to switch locations from time to time.
Uribe said with the new car he plans 
to start up an auto parts business. And 
Uribe’s wife, Claudia Solis, said the two 
are thinking about making a trip to the 
beach in May. Uribe married Solis in Oc-tober, and the wedding was one of the few times he has left his home in recent years.GAINESVILLE CITY COMMISSIONFamily petitions law to commissioners after tragedy

Powerful music filled the air and the audience sat with 
awestruck expressions as the UF Symphony Orchestra per-
formed Thursday night. 
Under the baton of conductor Matthew Wardell, the UF 
Symphony Orchestra played for about 1,000 people at the 
Phillips Center for the Performing Arts, the best-attended UF 
orchestra concert ever, Wardell said.
The first half of the concert showcased  concerto competi-
tion winners Yefim Romanov and Anastasia Naplekova.
Romanov, the undergraduate winner, performed Tchaik-
ovsky’s Concerto for Violin and Orchestra and Naplekova fol-
lowed on piano with Rachmaninoff’s Rhapsody on a Theme of Paganini. Both pieces resulted in an encore and a standing 
ovation for the soloists.
In her nine years of working for UF, Mutlu Citim-Kepic 
said this was one of the best Symphony Orchestra concerts 
she has been to.
After intermission, the orchestra performed Béla Bartók’s 
Miraculous Mandarin, accompanied by a ballet with the UF 
school of Theater and Dance. 
The Mandarin tells a story of a girl forced to seduce men 
so her thugs could beat them and steal their money. In the 
end, the message that all beings deserve satisfaction was por-trayed through the character of the Mandarin, who repeat-
edly defies death to gain the girl’s acceptance.

Venezuelan journalist, politician and 
economist Teodoro Petkoff spoke about 
the Venezuelan media and Hugo Chávez’s government during an informal discussion Thursday.
About 25 Gainesville residents, stu-
dents, faculty and staff participated in the bilingual discussion. Petkoff, the founder and editor-in-chief 
of the Venezuelan newspaper Tal Cual, which is critical of Chávez, described the Venezuelan media’s history of censorship and violence.
“Between media and governments, al-
ways there are frictions, always, and our country was not an exception,” he said.Petkoff said that freedom of the press 
has gradually increased in Venezuela, but 
the press must remain cau-tious.
He said Chávez is also 
trying to create a block of 
tax-funded state-run TV channels. Private channels still exist, but Chávez aims to dominate the country’s viewpoint, Petkoff said.
He said the government uses his taxes to 
attack him, and Chávez does not have the legal or moral right to do that.
“I am very critical of the government, 
very irreverent even,” he said.

FAB also helps students raise money 
for their trips. The money is distributed 
evenly so that all domestic trips cost the same, regardless of destination.
“That way, someone doesn’t pick a trip based on the cost,” he said. “They choose 
based on what issue they want to work on 
or learn about.” 
Perrone said that the things students 
see when they travel abroad can make 
them aware of issues facing Gainesville, 
such as poverty. 
“There are benefits you get out of this 
type of experience that you wouldn’t get out of other types of spring break,” he 
said.
Florida Alternative Breaks is not the

Jenna Harris, a freshman journalism 
major at UF, is going to Monterrey, Mexico 
with the Theta Alpha Christian sorority to work with Back to Back Ministries helping Mexican children.
Harris said she sent out letters asking 
for financial support from people in her community and local businesses, which helped her pay for the trip.
“If I didn’t have the money, I wasn’t go-ing to be able to go,” she said.
Despite a recent e-mail from the UF 
Division of Student Affairs warning stu-dents to be careful if traveling to Mexico during spring break, Harris said she isn’t 
worried.
The e-mail said that there has been a re-
cent increase in violent attacks.
Harris said she and her friends will 
stick together and use common sense to stay out of danger, and that they won’t let 
the warning stop them from carrying out their plans of helping people and having fun.
“God said go,” she said. “So that’s what 
we’re going to do.”UF Student Affair’s warning about Mexico attacks does not worry travelersnational University and Florida State University campuses that also use Aramark for campus

tioned, she said.
Pollo Tropical’s construction 
is set to begin March 10, Rodri-

Students can still access the 
UF Bookstore from the food court during construction. 
Some students will miss the 
Italian restaurant.
“I’ve been to Capeesh probably a handful of times since I came to UF, and I haven’t had any com-plaints,” said Ethan Kopelman, a telecommunications junior. “It’s

that they’re changing it.”
Nekeshia McInnis, a health 
science sophomore, never found 
Capeesh appealing 
but is excited about 
Pollo Tropical. 
 “I’m so tired of 
eating just fast food on this cam-
pus,” McInnis said. “There needs 
to be more variety.”
Rodriguez didn’t respond to 
an e-mail question about the cost of constructing the new restau-

SAN FRANCISCO (AP) — As thousands 
of demonstrators chanted slogans and waved 
placards outside, California’s highest court on Thursday skeptically grilled lawyers seeking to overturn the state’s ban on gay marriage.
Attorneys for same-sex couples argued 
the public’s right to change the constitution doesn’t extend to depriving an unpopular mi-nority of the right to wed.
But questions and statements from the jus-
tices indicated a wariness to override what Associated Justice Joyce Kennard called the people’s “very, very broad, well-established” authority to amend the state’s governing 
framework at the ballot box.
“What I am picking up from the oral argu-
ments is that this court should willy-nilly dis-
regard the will of the people,” said Kennard, who just 10 months ago voted that prohibiting same-sex marriages violated the civil rights of gays. “The people established the constitution; as judges, our power is very limited.”
The justices heard three hours of arguments 
on the gay marriage ban, known as Proposi-tion 8, which was approved in November with 52 percent of the vote. It effectively reversed a 4-3 Supreme Court decision that legalized gay marriage 4½ months before the election.
Gay rights advocates argued the proposi-
tion is such a sweeping change to the constitu-tion’s equal protection clause that it was a con-stitutional revision, not just an amendment. A 
revision requires legislative approval before it 
lands on the ballot.
Chief Justice Ron George, who also ruled 
last year to strike down a pair of laws that lim-ited marriage to a man and a woman, echoed Kennard’s qualms about denying the public its voice.
George noted that the state constitution has 
been amended at least 500 times compared with the 27 times the U.S. Constitution has been altered, and said it was up to the Legisla-ture or voters — not the court — to make the 
process more difficult.
“It seems what you are saying is, it is just 
too easy to amend the California Constitu-
tion,” George told Raymond Marshall, an at-torney representing the NAACP and other civil rights groups trying to overturn the ban. “Maybe the solution has to be a political one.”
Minutes into Thursday’s proceedings, the 
justices peppered a lawyer representing un-
wed same sex couples with tough questions 
over how the 14 words of Proposition 8 rep-resent a denial of fundamental rights when same-sex couples still have the legal benefits of marriage through domestic partnerships.
“Is it your argument in this proceeding that the passage of Proposition 8 also took away in addition to the label of marriage, the core of substantive rights of marriage this court outlined in its decision last year?” asked Ken-nard.
“One of the core constitutional rights is to 
be treated with equality, dignity and respect,” replied Shannon Minter, legal director of the 
National Center for Lesbian Rights.
Supporters of the gay marriage ban, repre-
sented by former Whitewater prosecutor Ken-
neth Starr, said it would be a reversal of the Supreme Court’s own precedents for the court to overturn the results of a fair election.
“Under our theory the people are sover-
eign and they can do very unwise things that tug at the equality principle,” Starr said.
He also argued that California voters have 
an “inalienable right” to amend the constitu-tion and that taking away rights through the initiative process is not a revision that alters the structure of government.
“There must be far-reaching change in the 
basic structure of government,” said Starr.
The court also heard arguments on how 
the gay marriage ban affects the 18,000 mar-riages of same-sex couples performed before it passed. Many of the justices appeared skepti-
cal that Proposition 8 could be 
applied retroactively.
George suggested the va-
lidity of the earlier marriages 
was purposely omitted from 
the ballot initiative as a campaign strategy to increase the likelihood of its passage.
Starr, dean of Pepperdine law school, said 
the intent of Proposition 8 was to prevent the state from recognizing any same-sex marriag-
es, noting that it was drafted before the high 
court legalized gay marriage on May 15.
The Supreme Court’s seven justices have 
90 days after the oral arguments in which to issue a ruling.
The crowd outside the court grew steadily 
throughout the hearing, with many watching the proceedings on a giant television screen erected across the street in front of City Hall. Demonstrators were evenly split over the gay marriage issue and took turns drowning out each others chants after the hearing.
Dana Tibbits, who drove 400 miles from 
her home in Ventura County to join the crowd of Proposition 8 supporters, said she there for the “approximately 7 million voters whose voices need to be heard.”
“I’m concerned about the justices, the 
weight of our vote and the weight of our deci-sion,” Tibbits said.
Gay marriage supporter Chris Bospuz, 23, 
said after the hearing: “I was pretty disheart-ened at the beginning, but I’m optimistic,” he said. “It’s a civil right and they can’t just strip away civil rights.”14, ALLIGATOR � FRIDAY, MARCH 6, 2009

THE ASSOCIATED PRESS
NEW YORK (AP) — Foreclo-
sures are spreading by epidemic 
proportions, expanding beyond a handful of problem states and now affecting almost 1 in every 8 Ameri-
can homeowners.
It’s an economic role-reversal: 
The economy, driven down by the 
collapse of the housing bubble, is causing the housing crisis to spread.
Figures released Thursday show 
that nearly 12 percent of all Ameri-cans with a mortgage — a record 
5.4 million homeowners — were at 
least one month late or in foreclo-sure at the end of last year.
That’s up from 10 percent at the 
end of the third quarter, and up from 8 percent at the end of 2007. In addition, the numbers now include many once-qualified borrowers who took out fixed-rate loans.
Data from the Mortgage Bank-
ers Association also showed that a stunning 48 percent of homeown-ers who have subprime, adjustable-rate mortgages are behind on their payments or in foreclosure.
The reckless lending and bor-
rowing practices in states like Florida, California and Nevada that 
were the epicenter of the problem 
are no longer driving up the na-tion’s delinquency rate.
Instead, foreclosures are be-
ing fueled by a spike in defaults in places such as Louisiana, New York, Georgia and Texas, where the economy is rapidly deteriorating 
and unemployment is climbing.
“It’s jobs. People are losing their jobs left and right,” said Houston 
real estate agent Michael Weaster.
On Thursday, the Labor De-
partment said new unemployment claims last week totaled 639,000, lower than expected, but still at el-evated levels.
That trend highlights one of the 
biggest challenges confronting the Obama administration’s mortgage-relief plan launched this week. While the $75 billion plan could help change the loan terms or refi-nance up to 9 million homeowners, 
unemployed borrowers will have a hard time qualifying.
The key to the housing market 
is what kind of workers are losing their jobs. Unemployment for peo-
ple with college degrees, some col-lege education or technical training — those most likely to own homes and have prime fixed-rate loans — has nearly doubled over the past six months, according to the bankers association.
To give debt-burdened hom-
eowners a little more muscle to negotiate with their lenders, the House on Thursday passed a bill 234-191 that would to give bank-ruptcy courts the power to reduce mortgage payments.
The legislation would give 
bankruptcy judges — who now can 
modify loans for cars and student 
loans but not for primary residenc-es — new power to cut the interest rate and principle on a home mort-gage.
The Senate is expected to take up 
the measure in a couple of weeks.
The only bright spot in the fore-
closure report was that the devasta-tion wrought by subprime ARMs is waning. Their 30-day delinquency rate continues to fall and is at the lowest point since the first quarter of 2007. 
Most of those types of loans 
have made their way through the system as lenders stopped originat-ing them in the first half of 2007.
That offers little comfort to Flor-
ida, where 60 percent of homeown-ers who have a subprime ARM are at least one payment behind and 1 
in 5 of all mortgage holders are not 
current on their loans.

Between the Gators bedspread, 
the closet full of UF apparel, the 
national championship Wheaties 
boxes and the posters, it’s clear why Trey Burton’s college deci-sion was easy.
Burton, a junior quarterback 
at Venice High, wasted little time orally committing to the Gators last July, almost two years before he was scheduled to graduate 
from high school.
“Ever since I was around 6 
years old, I’ve always loved Flori-
da,” Burton said.
Not only did such an early de-cision keep other coaches off his phone line, it allowed the option quarterback to become the de fac-to head of UF’s recruiting class.
The day he orally committed, 
Burton sent a text to Ian Silber-man, then the only other player in the Gators’ 2010 class. 
Silberman is an offensive line-
man who moves exceptionally well, a characteristic often seen in left tackles — the protector of a quarterback’s blind side. Burton 
estimates that they text three or 
four times a week.
Now, the dual-threat quarter-
back’s attention is more on sway-
ing uncommitted players.
“I’m a big competitor, and I want to win. I’ll do pretty much 
whatever it takes,” Burton said. “I know that bringing some of these kids in, they’re going to make me 
better and I’m going to make them 
better.”
When Burton heard the UF 
coaching staff was looking at Li-
thonia (Ga.) Martin Luther King 
running back Mack Brown, he made it a priority to meet him at the Under Armour All-America Combine in January. 
Burton and Brown became fast 
friends — they text message fre-quently — and Burton let Brown know where he should commit.
“I told him straight up, he’s 
one of the kids I want to play with when I get up there, and that’s it,” Burton said.
Burton said he won’t force 
Brown to make a decision, but he 
knows a backfield consisting of 
him and Brown could make for an exciting offense in the future.
Like any good recruiter, how-
ever, Burton knows not to focus on just one player.
He has been friends with line-
backer Christian Jones for two 
years. 
Burton met Jones at a summer 
basketball tournament and found 
out first-hand what the 6-foot-4, 
220-pounder is capable of doing.
“He dunked on me pretty 
good,” Burton said with a laugh. 
Jones’ flash of athleticism left 
such an impression on Burton that he urged UF coaches to take a look 
at the Winter Park Lake Howell linebacker. The Gators offered Jones a scholarship on Feb. 27.
“Every kid that has a pretty 
good shot, that’s a really good player, I tell them about,” Burton said.
This is not new for UF. Tim 
Tebow’s commitment to UF in December 2005 paved the way for commitments from Percy Harvin 
— who declared six days after 
Tebow — and Brandon Spikes, and the Gators’ 2007 recruiting class featured seven players from 
Lakeland High. That group was 
essentially recruited to Gainesville by running back Chris Rainey, who committed in May 2006. 
The trend of high-profile re-
cruits using text messaging to per-suade other players to join their class began about five years ago. According to the wireless trade association CTIA, 40 percent of teens owned cell phones in 2004.
That is about the time highly 
touted Penn State commitments 
Justin King and Derrick Williams 
started convincing other national-ly ranked recruits to become Nit-tany Lions. The next year, a young 
Penn State team captured a share 
of the Big Ten Conference title.
And as the number of teenag-
ers with cell phones rises (CTIA estimates 80 percent now own 
them), so does the number of sto-
ries of high school players recruit-ing each other. 
“That is what spurred it on 
more than anything, the technol-ogy,” said Rivals.com recruiting analyst Jamie Newberg.
Even with technology, Burton’s 
effort has been extraordinary. In 
addition to Silberman, Brown and 
Jones, the athletic playmaker con-sistently talks with Ocala Trinity Catholic wideout Kadron Boone, 
Royal Palm Beach receiver Chris 
Dunkley and Bradenton Southeast safety Jonathan Dowling, UF’s lat-est oral commit.
The defensive back said Burton 
asked over and over when he was 
going to become a Gator.
“I like to recruit,” Burton said. 
“I definitely want the best class in 
2010.”
Oral commitments are non-bind-
ing until a national letter-of-intent 
is signed on National Signing Day 
on Feb. 3, 2010.FRIDAY, MARCH 6, 2009 � ALLIGATOR, 21

On a night Corey Hartung envisioned 
waving to the crowd after her floor exer-
cise, she instead will face the harsh real-
ity of not competing, waving to the crowd from the floor with her family, dressed up to cheer and coach while wearing a protec-
tive boot.
Hartung, the lone senior on the team, 
will be honored tonight in the O’Connell 
Center as  No. 4 UF (5-3, 3-3 Southeastern Conference) hosts its last home meet of the 
season against No. 14 Michigan (13-3), but 
she won’t be competing because of a tear in her left calf muscle.
UF coach Rhonda Faehn wants to rest 
her until the start of the SEC Champion-ships.
Not only will the night, one focused 
on Hartung, be emotionally tough for the team, it will also impact the team’s line-
up.
Hartung, an all-around competitor, 
performed against Georgia last week on 
uneven bars and balance beam, but has  even been scratched from those two events 
tonight in hopes to get her healthy for the 
postseason.
While looking back on Hartung’s ca-
reer, Faehn said she didn’t remember dual 
meets. Instead, she remembered the big 
meets, such as the national championship and regional meets.
It’s a point she has been trying to stress 
to Hartung, as hard as it’s been for Har-
tung to accept in the heat of the moment.
“Really what I was trying to do was 
just trying to give her some perspective,” 
Faehn said. 
“I really just wanted her to try and fo-
cus on all the unbelievable things she did so far and still all the great things that lie ahead.”
Hartung realizes she is being honored 
for her four years at UF and that, as hard as it will be not to compete, it doesn’t out-weigh the four years of competitions she has been a part of.
“It’s not about one night being able to 
perform, it’s about your experiences you had,” Hartung said. “I’m not 
being honored for com-
peting against Michigan (tonight), it’s just a meet. 
It happens to be Senior Night.”
If the Gators want to 
push their home record to a perfect 5-0, other gymnasts will need to fill the void left by Hartung, something the team has 
had to do all year while battling injuries.
Juniors Ashley Kerr and Courtney 
Gladys will see more duty, with Kerr fill-ing the sixth spot on the vault lineup and Gladys performing in every event.
The team is also welcoming back junior 
Amanda Castillo, who competed on floor 
for the first time this season in Athens, Ga., after recovering from bursitis.
“You don’t want to be pulled out of the 
lineup. You don’t want to be hurt,” Cas-tillo said.
“You know the team is struggling and 
you know you can help. And then when you can’t, it’s one of the worst feelings in the world.”
Castillo, who is familiar with the feel-
ing of being hampered by an injury, said 
she’s dedicating her performance tonight 
to Hartung.
“I’m going to compete from my heart, 
for Corey,” Castillo said. “We need to 
make it fun. We need to go out there and 
get the crowd rowdy and do it for our lone senior.”Uf GYmNaSTIcSHartung to sit on Senior Night with torn calf muscleHarrison Diamond / alligator Staff

Although the UF women’s golf team will be a couple 
hours away from Gainesville, it will feel very much at 
home in this weekend’s tournament.
The No. 28 Gators will make the short drive to Or-
lando and play in the UCF Challenge on Sunday.
The tournament will feature four of the top five 
ranked teams in the country: No. 1 Arizona State, No. 2 UCLA, No. 3 Southern Cal and No. 5 Alabama.
After two inconsistent performances to start the 
spring, coach Jill Briles-Hinton believes the Gators must have a short memory in order to stay consistent and con-tend in this tough field.
“In order to mentally be stronger, you have to take it 
one shot at a time,” Briles-Hinton said. “Forget about the shot you hit, forget about the past and move on.”
One thing UF will have on its side is the advantage of 
playing close to home. 
The previous two events for the team were in dif-
ferent states — one in California and the other in South Carolina.
The Gators are excited to finally play a tournament 
in Florida. “The girls like to play in front of their fans, so that is 
going to be fun,” Briles-Hinton said.
Sophomore Jessica Yadloczky grew up close to Or-
lando and has experience on the tournament’s golf course.
“Jessica has seen the course before, and it’s in her 
backyard,” Briles-Hinton said.
The Gators’ lineup for the tournament will comprise 
Yadloczky, Evan Jensen, Andrea Watts, Lauren Uzelatz and Nicole Schachner.
With four of the five UF golfers being Florida natives, 
playing in the state could work to the team’s advantage.
However, that won’t be the only thing the Gators will 
rely on. 
Hard work and a difficult early schedule have quick-
ly toughened up this young team.
“They’ve been challenged this year, and they’ve been 
working hard,” Briles-Hinton said.
� UF WILL USE ITS SEC 
EXPERIENCE THIS WEEKEND.

In a way, UF was victorious in 
the Southeastern Conference Indoor 
Championships. The team didn’t win the championship trophy in Lexington, Ky., but it got the next 
best thing — experience.
With the NCAA Indoor Champi-
onships coming up on March 13-14, 
UF’s SEC Championship perfor-mance had an impact beyond the final standings. It gave the Gators confidence and a sense of where they stand among some of the elite teams in the country.
To qualify for competition in Col-
lege Station, Texas, next weekend, 15 of UF’s athletes will participate in two last-chance meets this week-end. 
Nine of the 15 athletes will head 
to Blacksburg, Va., for the Virginia Tech Qualifier, while the remaining six will travel to the Alex Wilson In-vitational in South Bend, Ind.
In Kentucky, UF’s men faced 
seven of the top 25 teams in the U.S. Track & Field and Cross Country Coaches Association poll and placed second, while the women went up 
against five of the top 25 and fin-
ished fourth. 
When the 
NCAA Indoor Championships begin in Texas, UF will face some of those SEC teams, and their 
experience at the SEC Champion-ships will prepare them for the most important part of the season.
“The SEC meet is great prepa-
ration for the NCAA meet,” coach Mike Holloway said. “We’re, in my mind, easily the toughest league in America, and if you can get through the SEC, when you get to the NCAA meet, it’s the usual suspects, the same characters that you see all the time.”
When UF faces those familiar 
opponents at the NCAA Champi-onships, the team knows a little bit of what to expect and can focus on the things that prevented them from finishing in first place against SEC teams last weekend.
Holloway said the team is pleased 
but not satisfied with its efforts in Kentucky, so it is “just working on 
the small technical things” before 
the NCAA Championships begin.
When the Gators arrive in Texas 
next weekend, they will shift their attention to the task at hand — the NCAA Championships — but Hol-loway wants them to maintain the same focus that carried them to SEC Championship success. 
“The thing that we have to un-
derstand is that when we get to the NCAA meet, we have to just go there and do what we’ve always done,” Holloway said. “We can’t go there and worry about other teams and what they’re doing.”UF WOMEN’S GOLFGators head to UCF tournament

Following its first road win of the spring, the No. 9 UF 
men’s tennis team returns to Gainesville as the best in the state.
The Gators’ 5-2 victory over FSU on Tuesday was the lat-
est addition to their dominating run against Florida teams. 
The Seminoles joined Central Florida, South Florida and Mi-
ami on UF’s victims list.
Today, the team meets a whole new beast. UF has its 
sights set on the entire southeast as it starts conference play against No. 11 Kentucky at 3 p.m.
The Gators (9-3, 0-0 Southeastern Conference) are one of 
six SEC teams ranked in the top 25. Coach Andy Jackson said any team can win on any given day.
“(Kentucky has) already been to Tennessee, who is No. 
5, and won,” Jackson said. “So it’s going to be a big test, and we’re looking forward to it.”
The Wildcats bring the No. 2 singles 
player, Bruno Agostinelli, with them to Gainesville. UF’s Carlos Cueto will likely meet him on Court 1. Cueto defeated the nation’s No. 2 player — LSU’s Michael Venus — at the SEC Indoor before the 
regular season began.
The Gators will get a day’s rest before hosting Vanderbilt 
at 1 p.m. Sunday. 
WOMEN PREP FOR SEC PLAY: The UF women have had it 
tough recently. In their loss at FSU, the Gators had only five 
scholarship players on the roster.
They’ve been through a brutal schedule and have been 
missing Megan Alexander on Court 3. The junior sat out the 
last four matches with a sore back.
They have lost four of their last six, three of which were at 
a 4-3 final score and all to top 25 opponents on the road.
Now they will have to claw their way back up the rank-
ings after falling 18 spots from 13 to 31. They’ll have to do it against the SEC starting at 1 p.m. today in Kentucky.
The No. 14 Wildcats are followed by Vanderbilt on Sun-
day. UF’s conference schedule has the team playing the 
same opponent as the men on the same day at the opposite 
venue.
“We got a little taste of the indoors playing indoors (on 
Feb. 13-15), and more than likely those two will be indoors,” coach Roland Thornqvist said. 
“Our players are confident now that they can make the 
transition. That was certainly accomplished up in Madi-son.”Tennis teams

� MICHELLE MOULTRIE 
WILL START IN CENTER.

The UF softball team will 
have to face more than just the 
start of its Southeastern Con-
ference season this weekend at 
South Carolina. The Gators will also have to try to fill the hole in their lineup left by injured cen-ter fielder Kim Waleszonia.
No. 2 UF (19-2) will be with-
out Waleszonia, who went down with a tibial plateau frac-ture in her left knee Saturday. Waleszonia had not missed a start in her 234-game career 
before missing two games after 
sustaining the injury.
Waleszonia hit second in the 
lineup and led the outfield from her spot in center field, so mak-ing up for the loss of the senior 
won’t occur overnight.
“I don’t think we can ever 
replace Kim,” second baseman 
Aja Paculba said. “The best thing we can do is just continue to play how we’ve been playing 
and fill the void by doing the 
things we know how to do.”
Fortunately for the Gators, 
they have been doing a lot of things well lately. The team is riding an eight-game winning streak into the three-day, con-
ference-opening series against 
the Gamecocks (12-2) and has 
scored 59 total runs during the 
streak, allowing only 13 com-
bined runs in those games.
For UF coach Tim Walton, 
though, none of that matters, as 
he views Friday as a new begin-
ning for his team.
“19-2 — that’s a good mark, 
but everything’s kind of 0-0 
now as we get ready for the 
SEC,” Walton said.
Walton said he is still un-
sure of a long-term solution 
for replacing Waleszonia, but he plans to start freshman Mi-chelle Moultrie in center field this weekend.
While Walton believes Moul-
trie is talented enough to per-
form at the plate, he still intends 
to take a wait-and-see approach 
on the fielding situation.
The coach is confident that 
Moultrie has the speed and ath-
leticism to get on base, but the 
freshman’s lack of experience 
in the field could be an issue in conference play, leading Wal-ton to consider splitting time 
between Moultrie and senior 
Brooke Johnson.
“(Moultrie’s) super fast. 
Anything that’s on the ground, it’s a hit,” Walton said. “I think 
she’s going to be the piece, and 
where we put her is yet to be determined.”
If Moultrie does move up in 
the lineup, it will allow right fielder Kelsey Bruder to move back to her previous position in the middle of the order.
Bruder, who has four home 
runs this season and is tied for second on the team with 18 RBIs, hit second Sunday in the Gators’ first games without 
Waleszonia.
“I still need to provide pro-
tection for Francesca (Enea),” Walton said. “Kelsey provides 
that home-run power, that 
home-run threat. Whether she’s 
struck out two times before or not, she’s still going to poten-
tially hit the next ball out of the 
ballpark.”
Although Bruder won’t be 
able to look over to center field to see Waleszonia, she thinks the senior’s leadership will still 
help guide the team through 
the season.
“She’ll be in the dugout with 
us, so we’ll still have her loud 
voice and all her cheers and her 
enthusiasm,” Bruder said.FRIDAY, MARCH 6, 2009 � ALLIGATOR, 23

who now bats leadoff, switched spots in the batting order with Kim Waleszonia early this year.
Senior’s injury forces lineup changes
Dotson was the only other 
player in double figures (10).
What stands out to Brooks just 
as much about that game was her 
team’s defensive effort. 
UF  held Tennessee to 57 
points.
“That wasn’t my best perfor-
mance,” Brooks said. “I know I 
missed a lot of free throws, a lot 
of layups. But we’re going to have 
to be really tough on defense and stop their shooters and stop the penetration and stop them from 
scoring in the paint.”
The winner of Friday’s quar-
terfinal will advance to take on 
the winner of No. 1-seed Auburn 
and No. 9-seed Mississippi on Sat-
urday night at 6:30 in a semifinal matchup.
“It’s a big opportunity because 
it’s so wide open,” Brooks said. “Anybody can beat anybody in the 
SEC. Nobody is undefeated. You 
have to look at the teams that are really working hard this year to 
be a champion. That’s what we’re 
working towards this week.

right there. We can literally grab it if we wanted to. We’ve just all got to fight for it.”SEC title within

to finish it the right way.”
While Hodge, a member of both 
of the Gators’ national champion-ship teams, has remained in the starting lineup this season, he has often played fewer minutes than Erving Walker late in games.
“Erving is playing really well 
down the stretch against Tennes-see. And as a senior, he’s sitting there watching and cheering for Erving Walker to do it and help us win,” Donovan said. “He never 
says a word, never cops an attitude, 
doesn’t pout.  He’s always put Flor-
ida above himself.”
Hodge says once his basketball 
career at UF comes to an end he 
hopes to pursue a professional ca-reer overseas.
“I want to go pro and probably 
go to Europe, but that’s all in God’s hands,” he said.That’s months away, however.Right now, Hodge is still focused 
on the task at hand.
“We can still 
do something 
special,” Hodge 
said. “We have to win this game Saturday and get that confidence back.”
The senior 
says a run in next week’s SEC Tour-nament is still not out of the ques-tion either.
“It’s possible,” Hodge said. 
“Georgia did it last year, so why can’t we do it?”
CALATHES’ BENCHING A LEARN -
ING EXPERIENCE:  Nick Calathes 
watched from the bench as his team 
failed to rally from behind against Mississippi State in the game’s closing minutes Wednesday.
Donovan said he wasn’t punish-
ing the point guard, and he thought watching would be a good learning experience for his leading scorer.
“He has an incredible drive to 
make an effort at the end of games, but he has to understand how to in-
corporate other people,” Donovan 
said Thursday. 
“When you’re the best player 
on the team, you feel like you have to do it. But you have to be think-ing about time and score, who has the hot hand, what’s the best situ-ation.”
Guard hopes to pursue professional career in Europe after graduation from UF
it happened tonight.”
Using Keating to finish up the remaining 
innings was a clear sign of the importance of 
the bullpen and its lack of dependability to 
this point in the season. 
The pitchers understand that their re-
sponsibility is to perform when called upon 
whether  as a starter or reliever.
“(O’Sullivan’s) just trying to put things together to where we can win ball games,” 
Keating said. 
Welcoming a winless Duquesne team 
to McKethan Stadium should give UF the chance to do exactly that. 
The Gators have struggled in all aspects 
of the game and have failed to put together a complete showing since romping Eastern Michigan by a combined score of 29-6 over a two-game series last week.
In the last five games, UF has committed 12 errors while scoring just 19 runs. 
“We got to have some older guys step up 
and stop the bleeding, and we got to have 
some younger guys grow up in a hurry,” O’Sullivan said. 
Freshman Nick Maronde 
is scheduled to start Satur-day’s game, and Keating 
will take a few extra days off after his relief appearance, moving to Sunday’s spot in the rotation.
Keating said there won’t be any finger-
pointing after the recent skid and that the entire team has simply “been playing bad lately.” 
“Everybody’s been upset, but you can’t 
focus on bad things all the time,” Keating said. “Baseball is a tough game both men-tally and physically. There’s a lot of games. You’re out here everyday, and that’s where the mental toughness comes in.”Fielding, offense struggling since victories against Eastern Michigan last week

The Gators aren’t exactly used 
to this.
No. 4 seed UF sat and watched 
No. 5 seed Tennessee and No. 
12 seed Alabama duke it out on 
Thursday night in the first round 
of the Southeastern Conference 
Tournament, waiting to see who it 
would play.
The watching and waiting is 
over.
No. 21 UF (23-6, 9-5 SEC) will 
face No. 19 Tennessee (21-9, 9-5 
SEC) tonight at 7:30 in the quar-
terfinals of the SEC Tournament in North Little Rock, Ark.
The Gators held the head-to-
head tiebreaker with the Volun-teers for the first-round bye, hav-ing already defeated Tennessee 
66-57 during the teams’ first meet-
ing this season in Gainesville on 
Feb. 8.
“Being able to earn that bye is a 
big deal,” UF coach Amanda But-
ler said. 
“We’ve got to feel good about 
putting ourselves in the position where on Thursday we get to 
watch and hopefully get an up-
per hand on the team that we’ll be 
playing the next day.”
There won’t be any home-court 
advantage for the Gators this time 
against the Volunteers, but if there 
is anything UF will have an edge 
in, it’s rest and preparation.
“This is a 
great thing be-cause, what is it, four games you 
have to play if 
you don’t (have a bye)?” senior 
forward Marshae 
Dotson said. “That’ll take a toll on you.
“I can remember from last year 
getting in a tub of ice-cold water 
and getting massages and trying 
to get ready and enough sleep for 
the next day. Hopefully we can use that to our advantage when we get in the tournament.”

Even tears couldn’t wash away the 
disappointment.
As time runs out on the Gators’ season, 
and his career, senior Walter Hodge is left to wonder where it all went wrong.
The guard has won more games (113) 
than any player in the history of UF bas-ketball.
“He’s on the bench last night cry-
ing. Like emotionally crying, because he wants to win and he’s trying to implore our guys,” UF coach Billy Donovan said. “When you see someone like him care that much, you want that to be a reflec-tion of what your program is about.”
With their loss to Mississippi State on 
Wednesday night, UF’s (21-9, 8-7 South-eastern Conference) tournament hopes are all but dashed.
For the second time in two years, it’s 
likely that Hodge and the Gators will be watching March Madness in between their own National Invitation Tourna-ment games.“It’s hard when you put everything 
into this program and you don’t get the results you want,” Hodge said. “But that’s life. You have to keep going.”
Hodge will play his last regular-
season home game Saturday when UF finishes up the SEC season against Ken-tucky (19-11, 8-7 SEC) at 2 p.m. 
The Wildcats haven’t fared much bet-
ter in recent weeks, matching the Gators’ loss with one of their own to Georgia on Wednesday night.
The losing team is not likely to receive 
an at-large bid to the NCAA Tourna-ment.
“It’s going to be crazy. I got a lot of 
family coming. It’s going to be a big day,” Hodge said. “A lot of emotions — this is UF MEN’S BASKETBALLHodge nears career’s end

If things continue to go poorly for UF 
in this weekend’s three-game home series 
with Duquesne, it won’t be because coach Kevin O’Sullivan has been unwilling to 
shake up the pitching staff.
The Gators (6-4) have lost four of their 
last five contests, prompting O’Sullivan to 
make some changes with his hurlers.
Junior Jeff Barfield, who was projected 
to be a reliever, made his first start for UF on Tuesday against Stetson, earning a vic-tory in 6 2/3 innings. No. 1 starter Patrick Keating made a relief appearance against Florida Atlantic on Wednesday, picking 
up the loss despite allowing just 1 run 
over the final three innings of the game. 
As a result, freshman left-hander Alex 
Panteliodis (1-1, 3.09 ERA) will take the hill tonight against the Dukes (0-8), mak-
ing the first Friday-night start of his young 
career.“Pitching is pitching,” Panteliodis said. 
“You just have to get out there and do your job.”
The pitching staff has struggled to pro-
duce consistent results, and the bullpen let 
the game slip away against Florida Atlan-
tic after UF built a 4-0 lead through five innings. 
Veterans Tony Davis 
and Billy Bullock were credited with allowing 3 
runs in 2/3 of an inning after starter Anthony 
DeSclafani was taken 
out of the game. In addi-tion, all three inherited runners came across to score for Florida Atlan-
tic, resulting in a 6-run inning that proved 
to be the difference in the contest. 
“It’s frustrating,” O’Sullivan said after 
Wednesday night’s loss. “It’s not what 
you typically see from older pitchers, but O’Sullivan shuffles staffSEE TOURNEY, PAGE 23
