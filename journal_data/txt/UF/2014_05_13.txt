More than 60 Citizens Co-
op member-owners voted 
Sunday to draft a compromise proposal that would appoint four interim members to the co-op’s board of directors and call for two current members to step down.
The proposal will ask the 
current board to appoint three regular members and one worker-owner to a transition-al team that the co-op’s mem-ber body approves of. It will also suggest current board members Lucian Kragiel and Burt Gill resign from their po-sitions.
This motion was passed by 
a majority vote cast at a mem-ber meeting held at the Civic Media Center on Mother’s Day. It follows months of ten-sion between the board and co-op members who are no longer comfortable with its leadership. 
Representatives from the 
board, co-op staff and protest-ing ﬁ  red workers all voiced their opinions at the meeting.  Though the proposal has 
no legal force or backing in the organization’s bylaws, Tim La Combe said it will show the board of directors the mem-bers’ opinions. Because the board didn’t call the vote, the members would have go to court to enforce the proposal, which La Combe said the members aren’t willing to take the time and expense to do. And because members don’t have the authority to appoint board members themselves, the positions have to be ﬁ  lled by the board.
“People don’t often get 
involved unless they feel strongly that something is wrong,” La Combe said, a prospective transition team member. “Through a process of consensus, we are making a compromise proposal to the board about changing the board makeup.”
Members decided on this 
course of action after voting down the terms of Lucian Kragiel’s letter of resigna-tion, which he signed May 9. The members called the terms Citizens Co-op

Internet buffering may soon be a 
thing of the past for select Gainesville 
apartment communities.
Gator Net, the ﬁ  ber-optic-only 
Internet provider already marketed as the fastest Internet in town at 50 megabits per second, recently an-nounced it will offer speeds of up to 100 mbps and 1 gigabit per second as options.
Wayne Wishart, business man-
ager for GRUCom, the telecom-munication branch of Gainesville Regional Utilities that runs Gator Net, said with the increasing use of high-data streaming sites like Netf-lix, “those higher speeds will really help support everyone being able to do whatever they really want to do online without interfering with the other person’s usage.”
Although none of the few dozen 
communities, which include The Es-tates and Cabana Beach, using Gator Net has upgraded to the higher speeds yet, Wishart said about half of them have submitted inquiries. 
Trimark Properties, which owns 
several of the communities that ex-clusively use Gator Net, is especially interested.
“We want to continue to be the 
fastest in town,” said Aubrey Mo-rey, vice president of marketing and sales at Trimark. “You can’t get this quality of service at other apartment complexes.”
Wishart said he thinks this new 
“100 times faster” than average American service will encourage more communities to make the switch from AT&T or Cox. Howev-er, because individuals cannot sub-scribe, he said he doesn’t envision it being a city wide takeover.
Gator Net increases speeds, hopes for first installments� A SEARCH COMMITTEE WAS ALSO CHOSEN

UF’s newly selected presidential search committee 
has begun the process of ﬁ  nding UF’s next president.
In 2012, the university went through a research pro-
cess to ﬁ  nd a set of qualiﬁ  cations to use to ﬁ  nd UF’s 
twelfth president. The search process was derailed when Gov. Rick Scott asked UF President Bernie Ma-chen to remain at UF.
With Machen’s contract set to end in December, the 
search is back on and the qualiﬁ  cations must be updat-ed. At a public meeting held Friday, the presidential search subcommittee of qualiﬁ  cation and criteria made changes related to comments sent to the committee.“The Board of Trustees had requested additional in-
put to determine if those qualiﬁ  cations developed two years ago adequately reﬂ  ected the University of Flor-ida’s designation as the state’s foremost preeminent university,” said UF spokeswoman Janine Sikes.
The subcommittee meeting was one of the ﬁ  rst steps 
taken by the new presidential search committee, an-nounced on May 1.
In an email sent to “UF family and friends,” com-
mittee chairman C. David Brown II announced the 18-member panel, which includes representatives from the UF Board of Trustees, faculty, administration, alumni, donors and a student representative.
“Recruiting an exceptionally well-qualiﬁ  ed leader to 
advance UF’s preeminence goals and future is particu-larly important work in light of the university’s current opportunities,” Brown wrote.UF talks presidental search criteria

Fla. Gov. signs bills triggered by 
Common Core fightTALLAHASSEE — Three measures responding to com-plaints about Florida’s move to Common Core standards have been signed into law by Gov. Rick Scott.On Monday, Scott signed a bill (SB 864) that would al-low parents to object to school textbooks. The governor also signed a bill that would bar school districts from being able to collect student data like fingerprints. The measure (SB 188) would also bar the collec-tion of information on the po-litical or religious affiliation of students and parents.Florida is refusing to jetti-son standards based primar-ily on Common Core despite demands from activists and conservative groups. The bills were meant to address con-cerns that have been raised.

“an ultimatum” and “really unwork-
able.”  The letter stated that upon canceling a vote for a transition team, supporting upcoming board elections and members committing to purchas-ing at least $25 in goods per week from the co-op, he would resign.
Kragiel’s resignation letter came as 
a compromise to members who have been calling for the entire board of di-rectors to step down and be replaced, said secretary of the board Rob Brink-man.
Despite the members passing the 
motion, Brinkman said it could have no lasting effect.
“They can force a vote by submit-
ting petitions to the board of 10 per-cent of the membership,” he said. However, Sunday’s meeting did “not constitute 10 percent of the member-ship.”
Brinkman said the meeting was a 
disappointment and called Kragiel’s resignation a “signiﬁ  cant compro-mise.” 
On May 4, the board passed a mo-
tion to advance the board of directors election date from September to June 24. 
It also put all seven seats up for 
election. Members will have two weeks to cast their votes for new board members starting June 24.
Citizen Co-op general manager 
Lisa McNett said because the board of directors is giving up its seats in June, it allows members to have more com-mon ground.
“I see this as a great opportunity 
to get the membership excited and involved,” she said. “In essence, the board has chosen to leave the future of the store in the hands of the mem-bership as a whole.” 
If the board doesn’t respond to the 
proposal, some members at the meet-ing said they would move forward with a vote of no conﬁ  dence on the current board of directors. 
But based on the way things have 
evolved, Brinkman said he sees all of this culminating to the membership vote in June.
“The proposal will not do any 
good,” Brinkman said. “The June 24 election will go forward, and it will be legally binding.”

Gainesville residents are reacting to the news that 
the Food and Drug Administration will begin regulat-
ing the sale of e-cigarettes.
Smoking-related illnesses are the leading cause 
of preventable deaths in the U.S., and as a result the FDA will start regulating the sale of unchecked tobacco production for the ﬁ  rst time, which includes electronic cigarettes, according to the FDA website.
E-cigarettes, a smoke-free and battery-powered de-
vice that heats up nicotine, ﬂ  avors and other chemicals and is then inhaled, have not been fully studied by sci-entists. The FDA is looking for citizen comment in the next two months about all unregulated tobacco prod-ucts so they may better develop regulations.
Kathy Nichols, associate director of the UF Tobacco-
Free Task Force, said that the regulation doesn’t affect smoking on campus, a ban that includes e-cigarettes. The FDA regulation doesn’t have to do with where people use e-cigarettes, but with the composition of the products, she said. Users may be unaware of the true amount of nicotine in e-cigarettes because the product wasn’t regulated in the past.
“Even if the packaging says the products contain a 
certain amount, inaccurate labels even within the same brand are common,” Nichols said.
However, Tico Regalato, a 20-year-old UF sociology 
senior who quit smoking by using e-cigarettes, said the regulation is unnecessary because the devices already serve their purpose as smoking cessation devices.
E-cigarettes work because you still have the feeling 
of smoking but with a healthier alternative, he said.
“It not only alleviates the use for nicotine, but fulﬁ  lls 
the need to inhale and exhale by smoking,” Regalato said.
Betty Pritchard, a 19-year-old UF chemistry junior, 
said she thinks regulation of e-cigarettes will be good because it will bring the devices to the same level as cigarettes and other tobacco products. But as for health beneﬁ  ts, she said from what she’s seen, e-cigarettes just mean the user smokes more.
“The only beneﬁ  t of letting people have e-cigarettes 
is that there will be less people throwing cigarettes on the ﬂ  oor,” she said. “It will be better for the environ-ment in that way.”FDA will regulate 
sale of electroniccigarettes

“Hey Gainesville, just say 
no. We don’t want our food to glow!” The State Agricultural Commission had to respond to this call of protest to the con-struction of an irradiation facil-ity near the UF campus. The fa-cility would zap fruit and other food with cesium-137, a water-soluble nuclear byproduct, to kill bacteria and insects in order to slow the spoilage process. After public outcry involving a 1,400-signature petition, the commission delayed the con-struction in order to perform more safety studies. 
May 12, 1994A tree put a real damper on 
plans to start construction on a new physics building on UF’s campus. Conservationists, in-cluding some in the Student Senate, protested and debated the removal of the second-oldest and second-largest live oak tree to make room for the new addition. “It’s about want-ing the administration to think twice about bulldozing some-thing over without thinking about the ramiﬁ  cations,” Sen. Pam McNeill said.

On a college student’s budget, 
Chipotle’s recent price increase 
could mean a lot.
The chain restaurant increased 
the price of all of its menu items by about 15 to 50 cents on Tues-day, but 20-year-old Santa Fe College student David Bartek said he doesn’t mind the jump in prices.
Bartek, an emergency medi-
cal technician student, said he already springs for double or triple meat on his burrito bowl – a meal that he orders at least four times a week.
“Paying more is worth it,” 
he said. “Especially now that they’re non-GMO.”
The company recently an-
nounced that its meals are free of genetically modiﬁ  ed foods and cited its commitment to natural-ly raised meat as the reason for the cost increase.
There’s a high demand for 
naturally raised food, said Juby Mammen, employee at the Chipotle closest to campus, lo-cated at 1432 W. University Ave. He said the company needed 
to increase prices “in order to get food like that.”
He remembered last year 
when his store ran out of natu-rally raised steak and had to switch to meat that had been conventionally raised.
“Supply is obviously limited 
because it’s naturally raised,” he said. “And it takes time to get.”
With the added revenue, 
Mammen said he hopes to pre-vent another shortage and pro-vide customers with the food they want.
He said he doesn’t believe the 
price increase will turn custom-ers away.
And in Bartek’s case, it cer-
tainly hasn’t.
“It’s delicious, it’s ﬁ  lling …
and the way I eat, it ﬁ  ts my life-style,” he said. “I’m still ﬁ  ne with the prices.”Chipotle raises prices 
to help pay for non-GMO food
“It’s delicious, it’s ﬁ  lling …
and the way I eat, it ﬁ  ts my 
lifestyle. I’m still ﬁ  ne with 
the prices.”

In a perfect world, more businesses would be operated in a 
worker-owner co-op fashion. 
“We all have childhood memories of parents, teachers 
and others encouraging us to work together,” Stronger To-gether Co-op’s website reads. “A co-op is what “working to-gether” looks like all grown up.” 
Instead of relying on outside investors and rewarding 
those outside investors with proﬁ  t shares, co-ops reward its members with shares of surplus revenue. Each member’s share is calculated based on how much they use the co-op. That way, the people who contribute to the day-to-day opera-tions of the co-op directly beneﬁ  t from its success. 
However, Gainesville’s own food co-op, Citizens Co-op, 
has been struggling for months to right itself after ﬁ  ve co-op workers were ﬁ  red for misusing the company’s email data-base system to send a message to the membership’s email list about the group’s efforts to unionize. Protests from the mem-ber-owners and those who were ﬁ  red have put pressure on the co-op’s board of directors to make changes, and a meeting of co-op members on Sunday culminated in a proposal to the board to take serious action. The proposal called for the resig-nation of two board members and rejected the terms of one of the board member’s resignation.
To say that the members and the board of directors don’t 
see eye-to-eye is, however, an understatement. The compro-mised proposal drafted on Sunday has no legal force or back-ing in the organization’s bylaws — which are not currently available online. 
In short, secretary of the board Rob Brinkman told the Al-
ligator the proposal won’t accomplish anything until the June 24 board of directors election. Brinkman said the members can only force a vote by submitting a petition to the board of directors of 10 percent of the membership, and Sunday’s meeting “did not constitute 10 percent.”
Co-ops exist to beneﬁ  t its members and the community at 
large, but currently, no one is beneﬁ  tting from Citizens Co-op. Furthermore, it hasn’t been running in the democratic fash-ion that co-ops require. Member-owner Davis Hart told The Gainesville Sun, “There is no leader of this beast and it has been difﬁ  cult to make decisions because everybody feels very scared to stand up and say, ‘This is what we are doing.’”
The board of directors budged by moving elections from 
September to the end of June, but the fact remains that work-ers are underrepresented in the board and its bylaws are out-dated. The group of members who gathered on Sunday are driving a hard bargain, but they don’t appear to be supported by the entire Citizens Co-op community, since they represent less than 10 percent of the membership. 
It’s a shame, given Gainesville’s reputation as one of the 
nation’s best small towns in which to live. A city with such a reputation should have a fairly organized food co-op that operates with the community in mind — not one mired in politics and self-interest.
Like, just stop: good speech does matter 
The “L” word. It’s that four-letter word that some 
people hardly use, some people always use, and some people cringe when they hear it spoken out 
loud.
Of course, I’m talking about “like.”Bet you thought I was going to say “love.” Or, for 
those who only read the ﬁ  rst three words and didn’t read anything else, “lesbian.” 
No, I’m referring to the absolutely overused sentence 
ﬁ  ller that we as the millennial generation have come to know and love. Don’t be mistaken: Women are not the only culprits of this offense. Men are just as guilty.
Luckily, I am here to appeal to the UF Student Body: 
Like, it has to stop. 
Now, don’t get me wrong. The word “like” has many 
practical applications. It is useful when comparing one thing to another. 
For example, “The Lakers are playing like garbage.” 
An example of how NOT to use the word “like” would be, “And I just don’t, like, understand anything that he teaches. Like, it’s not fair!” 
Askmen.com, well, asked men what they thought 
the 10 most overused words were, and “like” topped the list. Zoë Triska, associate books editor for the Huff-ington Post, admitted that as a native Californian, she is guilty of using the “overused, ﬁ  ller word” over and over again, yet acknowledges that it makes her sound stupid. 
If you’re thinking about hiring Sarah McLachlan to 
make a sad commercial about the abuse of “like,” and how if you donate only 25 cents per day, you could help someone who suffers from the abuse of “like.”  Just call now. Your donation matters.
But Gators, in all seriousness, not only are we per-
petuating this image of intellectual insecurity to each other, but we are communicating to our younger gen-erations that this is an acceptable way to speak. In the not-so-distant future, 
we will be the ones sitting be-hind the big desks in the corner ofﬁ  ce. 
We will be the ones conduct-
ing interviews and asking some young candidate questions about their work ethic, educa-tion and credentials, and when they start vomiting up the word 
“like,” will you be thinking about inviting them to the next networking meeting? 
They could be very qualiﬁ  ed and very well-read, but 
if they are not well-spoken, would any of it matter?  
So, how can we stop this? Some speech pathologists 
recommend that the “like” user record himself or her-self while telling a story to a friend, perhaps when on the phone. When the person goes back and listens to the recording, they should count the amount of times they said “like.” 
Afterward, he or she would repeat the story without 
saying “like.” With gradual repetition of this process with different stories, speech pathologists believe that one will come to rely less on the word as a ﬁ  ller in con-versation. 
We are UF students. We are intelligent and worthy 
academics, but this verbal ﬂ  uff must come to an end. We are no Paris Hiltons or Kim Kardashians. 
Make sure you represent yourself and your ideas 
properly and intelligently. Our professional lives are just starting, and we will encounter countless meetings, interviews, presentations and conferences where proper language use is essential to success. 
Essentially, just be conscious of the word and how 
often you rely on it because you never know who might, like, be listening.

Most of us will never have a great 
career. 
Good, I have your attention 
now. 
For the moment, let’s entertain this 
contrarian and presumably unpopular opinion. And yes, it is a bit cruel to bring this up weeks after graduation, but it is the unfortunate truth. 
For years, our peers and teachers have 
forced and implanted in our brains the grand delusions of illustrious careers. Add our youthful pretense for invincibil-ity, and you have the stereotypical college mindset: I will be the next great leader/business mogul/author/tech company co-founder/whatever if I think hard enough and believe that I can do it. 
Unfortunately, one can see that this 
mindset leaves a lot to be desired, espe-cially the submitting-to-reality part.
Idealism is not the problem. I am of the 
strong belief that society needs the starry-eyed idealists who can envision what the world should be instead of what the world actually is. Idealism in itself is not the issue, but the starry-eyed idealism is not enough to guarantee a great career. We have to act on our convictions and passions. And that’s when the uphill battle begins. Few of us, however, are willing to embark on the truly difﬁ  cult road that career path requires. Oh yes, the road is hard and soul-crushing. The perky idealism we once had does not quite ﬁ  t in with this daunting road ahead. 
Why though? What’s stopping us from 
achieving it? 
The oh-so-obvious answer is perfectly 
clear: ourselves. We want but are unwill-ing to act. We fail to dedicate ourselves to the consequences of having a great career — the long hours, the sleepless nights, the missed birthdays and perhaps the post-ponement of starting a family. We fear the known uncertainties. We make excuses. We realize that we didn’t want the great career enough. More importantly, we fail to go all in to pursuing our passions.    
This article is not meant to 
ward people off from think-ing grandly or to induce post-graduation stress. This article is meant to empower the fu-ture leaders of the world that we could be. 
We are capable of so many things in our 
modern age. Realize all of the resources and information at our ﬁ  ngertips. Appre-ciate the great education that was granted to you for the past few years. But America does have its perks and hopes. 
The belief that we can achieve great and 
amazing things is still alive and well, but the fear to chase after these passions gets the best of us. But it does not have to be this way. There’s still a chance to have a great career. 
Economist Larry Smith of TedxUW 
echoes the fact that most people will inevi-tably fail to pursue their passions and fail to have a great career.  The talk is blunt and rightfully so. Despite the harshness of his message, Smith ends on an empower-ing and uplifting note. 
After offering a litany of excuses the 
average person makes about pursuing his or her passions, Smith concludes with certainty, “Those are the reasons why you will fail to have a great career.” But then he pauses, looks up at the dimly lit audi-ence and utters the word “unless” before nodding his head and ends hthe speech.  
There is hope in his words. All is not 
lost. You can postpone those graduation nerves for the moment. We do have the ability to pursue our passions because of that “unless.” 
Most people do fail to have a great ca-
reer, but it doesn’t have to be this way. Failing to achieve our passions is not pre-determined. You can beat the odds and have a truly great career. In order to do that you have to ask yourself, “What is my ‘unless’?”

opinions@alligator.orgChloe Finch is a 21-year-old UF journalism senior/Alligator Opinions Editor/
bird enthusiast. Though this is her third semester on the editorial board, she 
still feels weird about writing these bios in third person. She’s pretty sure the only woman who has any business writing in third person is Anna Wintour. When Finch isn’t editing the op-ed pages or responding to reader emails, she’s probably trying to cook (and fail-ing), reading a “Mad Men” A.V. Club recap or watching “Fast Times at Ridgemont High” for the thousandth time. In addition to opinioning at the Alligator, Finch is a PR specialist at UF Information Technology and an acquisitions in-tern at the University Press of Florida. Shoot her letters to the editor, guest column ideas, concerns, complaints and TV recommenda-tions at cﬁ  nch@alliga-tor.org. But please don’t literally shoot her. Alex Harris is a 21-year-old journalism senior and the newest editor-in-chief 
at the Alligator. She prides herself in her cooking, her passport stamps and 
her (low) carbon footprint. Her job at the paper is to come up with stupid punny headlines, edit stories and make sure the newsroom isn’t set on ﬁ  re. In the fu-ture, she hopes to write for NPR, or something like that. The Orlando-native can usually be found eating an un-comfortable amount of Checkers’ fully loaded cheese fries or attempt-ing to educate the Al-ligator staff about the beneﬁ  ts of going out-doors every once in a while. If you want to talk nature, journalism, food or cats, you can reach her at aharris@alliga-tor.org or on Twitter @HarrisAlexC. Just please don’t address it to Mr. Harris. 
Kristan Wiggins is a 19-year-old UF journalism and political science junior and is the new Managing 
Online Editor. She has been working at the Alligator in some way since her ﬁ  rst semester at UF, 
mostly at copy desk preventing readers from seeing “its” when it should be “it’s.” Remember reading “This Week in Gainesville” a year ago? They were probably chosen for your amusement by her. When she isn’t spending hours of her time in the Alligator ofﬁ  ce, she can be found trying out a new cookie recipe in her tiny kitchen while also binge-watching a new show. Hopefully the future holds an editing or web job for her in Wash-ington, D.C., where she’ll be around the politics she gobbles up like a season of “House of Cards” and where she can write the next great American novel in her spare time. Her phone will always be in her hand — probably failing at making a new high score in 2048 — so any email or tweet will most likely be answered at stalker-esque speed. Feel free to reach out about cats or grammar puns at kwiggins@alligator.org or @KristanWiggins.Steven Katona is a 22-year-old UF journalism junior. There has been a running ofﬁ  ce joke 
about this Alligator up-and-comer: People have asked “Who is Steven Katona?” “What does 
he do?” Well, this summer, he is leaving his post on copy desk to be the Alligator’s Managing Print Editor. His job as managing editor is to be the ofﬁ  ce motivator by providing extremely lame jokes — and being the only one to laugh at them. When he goes home for break, he spends ev-ery waking moment with his 13-month-old neph-ew, Aiden. He also shows everyone he knows pictures and videos of adorable things he did, like laughing at puppets. He spends entirely too much money on coffee and Leonardo’s pizza, and he has been known to make more than one late-night stop at Karma Cream to get his ﬁ  x. He’s probably there now.

For those in need of a vampire-slaying 
kit, it’ll run about $300 at the Comanche 
Moon Curios near McIntosh, Fla.The antique shop owner, Jason Miller, 
said he determined the price based on the quality and value of the items inside. For example, kits with only a mallet and a spike inside cost about $50. Miller’s kit has a hammer, spike, communion kit, goggles, bible, candles, and cofﬁ  n nails.
“All good vampire kits have cofﬁ  n 
nails,” he said.
He found all the items himself and as-
sembled the kit. Everything in it, save for the Bible and candles, are from the late 1800s and the turn of the 20th century. 
He likes things from that era, he said. 
His store, located at 17990 NW 77th Ave., right off of Interstate 75, is a representation of that interest. Like the vampire kit, he has put together “exhibits” of related items throughout his store.
Miller, 59, is a retired paramedic and 
ﬁ  reﬁ  ghter from Sarasota. He said he’s al-ways had an interest in theater, arts, his-tory, weapons and the early 20th century. When he retired, he decided to turn his love of the period into his new career. 
Comanche Moon has been open a little 
more than a year, and Miller has lived in McIntosh for about six years. 
Miller started by hunting for speciﬁ  c 
items for people, including vintage Coca-Cola paraphernalia, ﬁ  rearms, antiques and vintage advertising. 
It became fun doing the research, be-
ing historically accurate, ﬁ  tting needs and ﬁ  nding the right things, and that is how his collection and his antique business got started. He said he ﬁ  nds things everywhere  — at yard sales, thrift shops and through internet research. He started collecting old military items, Victorian-period exorcism kits, embalming kits and blacksmith mate-rials.
“It’s a museum where you can take it 
home,” Miller said.
Miller’s love of all things from the late 
1800s to the 1920s comes from his belief that things were “made to last” in that time. There is a real, functioning blacksmith’s forge in his shop, as well as metal hooks and anvils, some of which Miller made.
He said the most popular items he sells 
are the vintage signs. His favorite reads, “Local Escort Service, $39.95.” 
Some of his signs are authentic ﬁ  nds, 
and some are hand-painted by Miller’s wife, Jennifer. He calls her “Xerox” because she can paint any logo.
Jennifer works a full-time job in Ocala, 
but she helps her husband on weekends by painting, repairing and restoring damaged and broken things.
She spends a lot of her free time at the 
store, and although she knows better not to let her husband in a thrift shop if they’re in a hurry, supports her husband and his philosophy behind his business.
“If you’re looking for dishes and vases, 
we aren’t it,” she said.8, ALLIGATOR � TUESDAY, MAY 13, 2014

Block was rescued by Alachua 
County Animal Services after being 
chained outside by his owner and incurring injuries.
A golden brown pit bull with 
piercing bronze eyes, Block watched as families came by the shelter look-ing for a new friend. They passed on him because of the scars on his face and tongue.
He was there for six months be-
fore he was adopted, said shelter supervisor Jane Grantman. She tries to ﬁ  nd the animals homes within a couple of weeks.
Since then, Block’s owner up-
dates Grantman with pictures of the two together, telling her how much joy he has brought her.
It’s those kinds of happy-ending 
stories that Grantman enjoys most about her job, and starting June 1, she’s hoping to hear many more.
Alachua County Animal Services 
was recently selected to take part in the American Society for the Preven-tion of Cruelty to Animals Rachael Ray $100K Challenge.  Through-out June, July and August, ACAS will compete with 49 other shelters across the U.S. to break their own re-cords of adoptions during the same months in 2013. This summer, ACAS hopes to almost double its adoptions by setting a goal of 2,500.
All its dogs and cats will be free 
for adoption to people older than 18 with a valid ID. The animals also come with a package of free services: a microchip, vaccinations, a medical exam, ﬂ  ea and tick treatment, spay or neuter, a license, and one of-ﬁ  ce visit to a supporting veterinary clinic.
“It’s an awesome deal,” Grant-
man said. 
At the shelter, adopting a dog 
usually runs about $30, and it’s around $25 for a cat. ACAS senior ofﬁ  ce assistant Janet Braden said she hopes this money saver will be an incentive for the community to support the shelter’s initiative and help it take home the $100,000 grand prize.
“I’m so psyched about this I can’t 
stand myself,” Braden said.
An additional $25,000 grant will 
be awarded to the shelter that shows the most community involvement on its social media sites. So through-out the summer challenge, animal service workers are encouraging Alachua County residents to take photos of their adoptions and post them on ACAS’s wall. They can also mention the ACAS on Twit-ter or Facebook using the hashtag #100KChallenge.
Adoption coordinator Dory Ro-
sati said the shelter is aiming for 19 adoptions per day, which is about 16 more adoptions than it gets on an average day. And to do that, she needs all the help she can get. Rosati is asking the community to volun-teer and support the cause.
“We’re planning to host one or 
two off-site adoptions per week,” Rosati said, “at different locations across Alachua County.”
Braden said shelters are not re-
quired to give away the animals for free. That’s just something ACAS is doing to get an edge on the comple-tion.  But in the end, the competition is simply a big motivator to help ani-mals in need.
“You’re saving a life, and they’re 
rescuing yours,” she said.

After being homeless for more 
than a year, Gainesville Police of-
ﬁ  cers now have a solid foundation to work with newer technologies and enhance patrol and surveil-lance of the city.  
The Gainesville Police Depart-
ment opened the doors to its head-quarters building, located at 413 NW Eighth Ave., to the public ear-lier this month, allowing all to see the two-story, $11-million facility for the ﬁ  rst time. 
It was paid for through vari-
ous funds, bonds and contraband forfeiture, which is money seized from criminal activities. 
In 2010, the decision was made 
to move department members out of the old building, scattering them to different locations across town, while renovations were be-ing made.
However, due to weak building structure, continuing the project was impractical. The decision was made to demolish the old building and to construct a more modern headquarter, according to GPD’s website. 
The building is outﬁ  tted with 
newer technologies such as key cards and remotes that work in all rooms.
“The technology is simplistic 
and amazing,” GPD spokesman Ofﬁ  cer Ben Tobias said. “It’s a very secure facility.” 
Areas in the facility are locked 
to the public and are only acces-sible with a key card. Even with a key card, only certain areas can be opened with the area’s respec-tive members. This line of security extends to Police Chief Tony Jones, in that he would need a special key card to get into the evidence room.  
Rooms throughout the building are named after key people from the department. 
The patrol room, named after 
Atkins Warren, is dedicated to Gainesville’s ﬁ  rst black police chief who instituted key policies and pushed peace between the depart-ment and the community. Warren was the chief of GPD from 1980 to 1984.   
The chief conference room, also 
known as the Command Center, is dedicated to GPD’s longest ten-ured chief, William D. Joiner, who joined the department in 1936. Joiner also instituted ofﬁ  cial forms for applicants seeking a police of-ﬁ  cer position in the department. Prior to Joiner, there was no pa-perwork required for a position in the GPD,  according to Smathers Library archives.
However, the department is go-
ing through some minor growing pains.
“We experience a few differ-
ent things like ‘Why is this access panel on the left rather than the right?’,” Tobias said.
New high-tech GPD building opens
“It’s a very secure 
facility.”

An 8-year-old Marjorie 
Kinnan Rawlings Elemen-
tary student was bitten by a Gainesville Police dog during a Friday afternoon demon-stration on the school’s play-ground. 
The animal, Roo, and his 
handler ofﬁ  cer, Jeff Kerkau, were performing a search demonstration inside a fenced-in area of the playground when the excited child on the other side opened the gate, ac-cording to a press release from GPD spokesman Ofﬁ  cer Ben Tobias. 
Roo ran toward the gate and bit the child on his upper-right thigh. Ofﬁ  cer Kerkau ran after Roo and pulled it off the child. After the incident, the child had puncture wounds on his thigh, but it didn’t ap-pear severe enough to require stitches, Tobias said.   
“We regret that this inci-
dent occurred and sincerely hope that this child has a speedy recovery from his inju-ries,” he said. 
Alachua County School 
Board spokeswoman Jackie Johnson said the county won’t cancel future demonstrations, but will work with GPD to make changes in how they are presented. 
“We’ve had these presenta-
tions in schools and never had an incident that I’m aware of,” She said. GPD dog bites child

Walton selected by USA Softball
Florida coach Tim Walton was selected as one of 25 
coaches for the 2015-2016 USA Softball Women’s National Team Coaching Pool on Monday.Kurt Roper will have a new offensive weapon this season in transfer Jake McGee. Read story on page 16.Alligator File Photo

Alligator Staff Writer @J_McPherson1126
Thirty-ﬁ  ve cornerbacks were 
selected between Thursday and 
Saturday in the 256-pick NFL draft — Marcus Roberson and Loucheiz Purifoy were not on that list.
After going unselected in the 
2014 NFL Draft, the two former Florida corners ﬁ  nally found their new homes Monday.
Roberson signed an undrafted 
free agent deal with the St. Louis Rams and Purifoy inked a deal with the Indianapolis Colts ac-cording to reports.
The duo played a combined 67 
games during their three years at Florida, and both were considered top-ten defensive back prospects when they declared for the draft. Heading into draft day, ESPN ana-lyst Todd McShay had Roberson and Purifoy ranked as his No. 101 and 184 draft prospects, respec-tively.
But not everyone from UF had 
to wait as long as the duo of early entrants.
Led by ﬁ  rst-round selection Do-
minique Easley, UF saw four of its former players drafted to three dif-ferent NFL teams during the three-day event.
The New England Patriots se-
lected Easley with the 29th pick of the draft, making him the 11th Florida player drafted in the ﬁ  rst round since 2007.
In 32 games with Florida, the 
defensive lineman logged 72 tack-les — 18 of which were for loss — and 5.5 sacks.
Easley played in three games 
in his ﬁ  nal season with the Gators before suffering a torn right ACL in practice on Sept. 26, 2013. The Staten Island, N.Y, native recorded ﬁ  ve tackles in those contests.
Excluding 2012, Florida has had 
at least one player selected in the ﬁ  rst round of the NFL Draft every year since 2007. Two UF players — defensive tackle Sharrif Floyd and safety Matt Elam — were drafted in the ﬁ  rst round of the draft in 2013.
After no one from Florida was 
selected in Rounds 2 or 3 on Fri-day, three heard their names called on the third and ﬁ  nal day of the draft.
Jaylen Watkins was the ﬁ  rst 
player taken off the board on Sat-urday, with the Philadelphia Ea-gles selecting the defensive back with pick No. 101 — the highest pick Philadelphia used on a UF player since selecting cornerback Lito Sheppard with the 26th pick in 2002.

Coach Tim Walton was not wor-
ried about Florida’s postseason fu-
ture after exiting the Southeastern Conference tournament on Thursday after one game.
“This game 
has nothing to do with the next step,” Walton 
said following UF’s 2-0 loss to even-tual tournament champion UGA. “I mean, when you’re playing the SEC teams, it doesn’t have anything to do with the regional approach. We’re just going to go about our business and take this as a midweek loss and get ready for the next step.”
Walton’s words rang true, as the 
Gators earned the No. 5 seed in the NCAA Softball Tournament on Sun-day, marking the seventh straight year that UF has been named a top-ﬁ  ve seed in the tournament.
Florida (45-11, 15-9 SEC) will host 
Florida A&M (24-27, 9-6 MEAC), UCF (41-16, 15-3 American Athletic Conference) and Stetson (38-12, 17-8 Atlantic Sun) in regionals. The Gators begin postseason action against the MEAC tournament champion Rat-tlers on Friday at 6 p.m. at Katie Sea-shole Pressly Stadium.

If you’ve ever watched ESPN 
during the summer, you know that the guys up in Bris-
tol scrape the bottom of the con-tent barrel to ﬁ  ll their one-hour SportsCenter shows every day. 
Yeah, summer means baseball 
season, but ESPN really only cares 
about New York, Boston and Los Angeles. If you aren’t one of them, you can wait until the postseason to get some coverage.
So after the Heat unfortunately run the ta-
ble in the NBA postseason and after the NHL crowns a new Stanley Cup champion, ESPN will resort to airing rehashed clips of Johnny Manziel casually throwing footballs during training camp, footage of Jameis Winston stealing those crab legs (for the love of God, I hope it comes out) and those mind-numbingly dumb remixes by DJ Steve Porter.
To ESPN, summer basically serves as the 
graveyard shift for sports.  
But here at alligatorSports, that couldn’t be 
further from the truth. Summer in Gainesville means sports, sports and more sports.
OK, so football and basket-
ball are in their offseasons. So what? Take a look at the sports schedule for this summer and tell me there’s nothing going on in Florida athletics.
Baseball, softball, lacrosse, 
tennis, track and golf all enter their postseasons in either May 
or June. And if you’re one of those Gators fans that only stay tuned when Will Muschamp or Billy Donovan are involved, then I urge you to stay updated with alligatorSports’ coverage of Florida sports throughout the summer.
The women’s tennis team, which owns 
a UF-record seven national titles, will face Southeastern Conference rival Vanderbilt in the NCAA Tournament Round of 16 on Thursday.
Our own Ian Cohen will keep you updated 
on the Gators’ quest for an eighth champion-ship. Busy summer in UF athletics

Teams aren’t ranked in the top 
five if they have a subpar defense. 
It’s not possible. And it’s why 
Florida (18-2) is No. 4 according to 
NCAA rankings.
Coach Amanda O’Leary’s de-
fense came out with power in its punch not once, not twice, but three times Sunday afternoon.
While the Gators’ defense has 
proven its strengths throughout the season, the team has consistently grown with each game.
This time, Denver (19-2) was at 
the receiving end of Florida’s 19-9 rampage against the Pioneers.
Between UF’s 26 fouls and seven 
forced turnovers, Denver had few opportunities to regroup and hold control over its offensive posses-sion.
“Defensively I think we stepped 
up a little better,” O’Leary said. “We were show-sliding more. Sliding on the double teams more quickly than we were in the beginning. I was real-ly, really pleased with our defense.”After the Gators allowed back-to-
back goals, the Pioneers gained mo-mentum late in the first half. Florida then responded with a change in its gameplan.
When O’Leary saw her defense 
start to falter, she chose to move freshman defender Caroline Fitzger-ald to the crease to provide relief for sophomore goalkeeper Mary-Sean Wilcox.
“We made some personnel ad-
justments that I think worked for us,” O’Leary said. “We stuck Caro-line (Fitzgerald) on a new player and I think she 
did a really nice job with shutting her down. You know, along with some personnel changes, I think they adapted re-ally well.”
Florida’s defense will have to 
continue to grow stronger in the coming weeks if it hopes to continue its journey through the NCAA Fi-nals. 
With the win Sunday, UF ad-vances to face No. 5 Northwestern for the third time this season.
Although the Gators won the 
first two contests against the Wild-cats, Northwestern will be prepared for what the Gators’ stacked offense and aggressive defense can dish out.
“Playing a team three times in 
one season is really difficult,” ju-nior Shannon Gilroy said. “But I think with a week to prepare and playing them on our home field, I think it’s going to be something we will remember.”
Florida’s defense denies Denver, faces familiar challenge next
O’Leary
Lacr OsseWalton said. “This is my ninth 
year here and we’ve hosted all nine years. There hasn’t been one year where it’s been easy.”
UF is 2-0 against its regional 
ﬁ  eld this season — topping UCF 10-6 in Orlando on March 26 and defeating FAMU 9-0 in ﬁ  ve in-nings on April 11. Florida has not played Stetson since 2009, when the Gators blanked the Hatters 8-0 at home.
The winner of the double-
elimination regional will face the winner of the Seattle Regional — which consists of No. 12 seed and host Washington, Iona College, Northwestern and BYU — in the NCAA Super Regionals.
The tournament as a whole 
features a plethora of familiar faces for Florida. UF is one of 11 SEC teams in the tournament and has faced 15 of the teams selected for the tournament.
Florida is 20-10 this season 
against those 15 teams but holds just a 5-9 record against teams in the top 16.
But instead of dwelling on the 
past, Walton is looking at what’s ahead.“This is a new season,” he 
said. “We’re 0-0. Everybody’s batting 1.000. All of our pitchers are 0-0. … Everything we’ve ac-complished to this point in the season is really irrelevant. Now it’s time to play postseason soft-ball.”
lected by the Eagles since 2010, 
when Philadelphia selected wide receiver Riley Cooper with the 159th pick.
In his four years at Florida, 
Watkins started 28 contests, registering 133 tackles, 21 pass breakups and three inter-ceptions. The Cape Coral, Fla., native was third on the team with 52 tackles and second with seven pass breakups in his senior campaign.
The New Orleans Saints 
drafted Ronald Powell in the ﬁ  fth round, taking the line-backer with the 169th overall selection. Powell was the ﬁ  rst Gators player picked by the Saints since 1998.
Powell notched 84 tack-
les and 11 sacks in 36 games for the Gators. He led Florida with four sacks in 2013 while also recording 26 tackles, in-cluding seven behind the line of scrimmage for a loss of 46 yards.
After drafting Easley on 
Day 1, the Patriots took an-other Gator on Saturday when they selected Jon Halapio in the sixth round.
The 6-foot-3 guard, taken 
with the 179th pick, started 43 contests at right guard for UF and can help bolster a New England offensive line that surrendered 40 sacks in 2013 — the most the Patriots gave up since allowing 48 in 2008. 
In addition to Roberson 
and Purifoy, six other former UF players have an opportu-nity to make teams as undraft-ed free agents.
Trey Burton, who played at 
least one game at every offen-sive skill position during his campaign with UF, will join Watkins in Philadelphia after signing with the Eagles. Bur-ton accumulated 1,696 yards and 20 touchdowns in 50 ca-reer games during his tenure at Florida.
Wide receiver Solomon 
Patton — who led UF in re-ceptions (44), receiving yards (556) and touchdowns (six) in 2013 — signed with the Tam-pa Bay Buccaneers.
Offensive lineman Damien 
Jacobs and linebacker Darrin Kitchens inked undrafted free agent deals with the Buffalo Bills. Center Jon Harrison will join Purifoy in Indianapolis, as announced by the Institute for Athletes, a ﬁ  rm that repre-sents him, on Saturday.
Offensive lineman Kyle 
Koehne, while not signed, an-nounced via his Twitter (@KingKone64) on Saturday that he will be trying out for the Atlanta Falcons.TUESDAY, MAY 13, 2014 � ALLIGATOR, 15

The softball squad will host its 12th 
straight NCAA Regional when Florida faces 
off against Florida A&M on Friday night. That’s not a typo people. I said 12 straight years of hosting the ﬁ  rst round of the NCAA Tournament. 
Check the Gators out at Katie Seashole 
Pressly Stadium this weekend and get all the analysis from Jordan McPherson afterward.
Oh yeah, and there’s that lacrosse pro-
gram that lost 13 members of its 2010 inau-gural class to graduation before the season but still found its way to another Elite Eight appearance. 
When Florida takes the ﬁ  eld at Donald R. 
Dizney Stadium on Saturday against North-western, Eden Otero will be there to cover the Gators and you should be there to witness the school’s youngest athletic program continue its run of historic success.

The tight end position at Florida 
has been virtually nonexistent since 
the end of the 2012-2013 season when Jordan Reed declared for the NFL Draft. 
Last year, tight ends Clay Burton 
and Tevin Westbrook combined for just four catches for 42 yards. But a transfer, who announced his deci-sion Friday afternoon, may give the Gators the playmaker they desper-ately need at the position. 
Enter former University of Vir-
ginia tight end Jake McGee. The 6-foot-5, 250-pound redshirt senior announced via Twitter on Friday that he would transfer to UF. The NCAA normally forces regular transfer students to sit out a year before joining their new team, but McGee is eligible this upcoming sea-son because he is pursuing a gradu-ate degree that is not offered at UVA and therefore is covered in the “one-time transfer exception” detailed in NCAA bylaw 14.1.8.1.
McGee plans to get a master’s 
degree in Sports Management. He started classes at UF on Monday. 
“It’s something that I’m pretty 
excited about, and it’s been sort of a quick process but something that I feel really strong about and I’m ex-cited to get to Gainesville,” McGee said in a phone interview Saturday.
He was the Cavalier’s leading 
receiver last season, racking up 395 yards and two touchdowns in 11 games.  The Richmond, Va. native came through in the clutch as well with 14 of his 43 total catches com-ing on third down — including both his scores. 
The Gators’ receiving statistics 
on a whole last year were nothing short of deplorable — UF ﬁ  nished the season ranked 116th in the na-tion in yards per reception.  
But moving to a new up-tempo, 
spread offensive scheme means of-fensive coordinator Kurt Roper will be utilizing tight ends often with the goal of having them make plays in space. 
“He’s a really smart offensive 
coordinator, and (he) puts the guys in the best situations to succeed,” McGee said. “From everything I’ve heard, there’s a lot of talent on this offense, and I think he’ll be able to make the most out of everyone.” 
Roper, who was Duke’s offen-
sive coordinator from 2008 to 2013, helped lead a Blue Devils’ offense to capture their ﬁ  rst 10-win season in school history.
More importantly for McGee, 
Duke’s second leading receiver was tight end Braxton Deaver, who ﬁ  n-ished the year with 46 catches for 600 yards. 
McGee said that Florida pre-
sented the best opportunity to have a successful ﬁ  fth year of eligibility when he was weighing his options following the 2013-2014 season with UVA. He was granted his scholar-ship release from Virginia on April 25. 
“It’s exciting to ﬁ  nd a ﬁ  t that I 
think is really good for me and to have an opportunity to have a good last season and play with a bunch of guys who have the same goal of winning and winning champion-ships,” McGee said.
McGee is all too familiar with 
Roper’s offense — Virginia suffered a 35-22 loss to Duke on October 19. Deaver, playing at tight end for the Blue Devils, was Duke’s leading re-ceiver in the game with two of his team’s three passing touchdowns.
McGee recorded four receptions 
for 32 yards, but the 6-foot-5 target was held without a score. 
During his time at Virginia, he 
was used as more of a hybrid tight end/wide receiver within the Cava-liers’ offense. He said that as a ver-satile tight end he will be able to give more looks offensively for the Gators, and Roper will be able to ﬁ  nd a good ﬁ  t for him in the system. 
“I move around a lot just as the 
type of player I am, whether it’s in the backﬁ  eld, on the line or in the slot,” McGee said, “And coach Roper’s offense does a great job of putting the tight end position in a chance to succeed whether it’s on the line, off the ball or really any-where on the ﬁ  eld.”
Florida quarterback Jeff Driskel 
will be responsible for getting Mc-Gee the ball to make those much needed plays on offense. McGee said that meeting Driskel in person during his visit to UF  him more ex-cited to play with the redshirt junior this fall. 
“I got to know him on my visit 
last weekend,” McGee said. “He’s a great guy, and I’m excited to get to start working with him and get some chemistry. He has a great arm and everything I’ve heard he’s a great leader on the team.”
While McGee didn’t get a chance 
to personally meet some of Florida’s tight ends and receivers, he said he has seen positive things from them in the ﬁ  lm room. 
“I haven’t met many of them 
yet,” he said. “I’ve seen some tape on them, and there are some guys that know them but once I get to know them I hope they take me in with open arms and sort of get to build a connection with them too.”
You may be wondering why McGee — an obviously talented playmaker — chose to come to UF, which is coming off a 4-8 season. But he said there is going to be criticism in every aspect of college sports and it’s his job to not let that affect his decisions. 
“You have negative in every-
thing that you do especially in col-lege sports,” McGee said. “There are people that support you, people that don’t. But I don’t really look at or lis-ten to that type of talk—and I just try to stay with the positive and what’s best for me.”
He added that Florida may sur-
prise some people this season — something that every Gators fan wants to hear. 
“From everything I’ve heard and 
everything I’ve seen, I think a good season is in store for next year and I’m excited to be a part of it.”
